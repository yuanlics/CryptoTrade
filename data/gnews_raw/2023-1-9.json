        "title": "Could Ethereum Hit $3,500 in 2023? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "At a recent price of about $1,270, Ethereum (ETH -0.01%) is down nearly 75% from the all-time high of $4,891.70 it touched in November 2021. That stratospheric level now seems like a distant memory for Ethereum investors, who enter 2023 uncertain of what's next for the second-largest crypto by market capitalization. Is a potential comeback in the making?\n\nAlthough the idea that it could nearly triple in value this year to $3,500 might sound outlandish, Ethereum was actually trading around $3,500 as recently as April 2022. But it will be a long, difficult path for it to regain that level in 2023.\n\nForget about The Merge\n\nIf there was one catalyst that was supposed to send Ethereum's price skyrocketing in 2022, it was The Merge -- the cryptocurrency's much-anticipated transition from a proof-of-work blockchain to a proof-of-stake blockchain. Although The Merge went as planned from a technical standpoint, it didn't from an investment perspective. The meltdown of crypto exchange FTX (FTT 3.89%) occurred about two months after The Merge took place, so we'll never really know what could have been. But we do know what did happen: Ethereum is down by nearly 25% since Sept. 15, the date The Merge took place.\n\nAs a result, investors can basically forget about any price gains driven by that transition this year. Yes, Ethereum has a number of updates planned for the year ahead that will improve the blockchain and increase its efficiency, but none of them will be really earth-shattering. Maybe it's just me, but I can't see Ethereum soaring in price on the basis of hype about \"rollups\" and \"sharding.\" So we're going to have to look elsewhere for catalysts that are capable of driving major gains.\n\nFlight to quality\n\nOne overarching investment trend that could help to buoy the prospects of Ethereum is a flight to quality. If 2022 was the year that investors got burned by holding risky, volatile assets, then 2023 is likely to be the year that they embrace less risky assets. While it might sound crazy to categorize Ethereum as less risky in any way, the fact remains that among cryptocurrencies, there are two that are generally considered to be quality assets on a relative basis: Bitcoin (BTC 0.48%) and Ethereum.\n\nAs a result, we can expect that many investors will continue to move their money out of more speculative tokens and into those two trusted coins. The big picture is that institutional investors increasingly consider crypto to be an asset class all its own, and as such, we can expect a flow of institutional money into Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nEven at the retail investor level, I think we are going to see money flowing into Ethereum as new investment products and trading platforms are created. One good example is the new Fidelity Crypto platform unveiled by Fidelity Investments in late November, which lets investors trade Bitcoin and Ethereum commission-free.\n\nCreation of new market opportunities\n\nEven this flight to quality, however, probably will not be enough to drive a three-fold return for Ethereum in 2023. What would also be needed is the introduction of a brand-new market opportunity that completely changes the game. Given that Ethereum has been a leader when it comes to creating new market categories such as non-fungible tokens (NFTs), decentralized finance (DeFi), and the metaverse, that type of innovation is not out of the question.\n\nOne new market opportunity that has potential involves customer loyalty programs running on the blockchain. Polygon (MATIC -1.32%), a Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum, is at the forefront of this trend. The brand-new Starbucks (SBUX 0.36%) Odyssey loyalty program, running on Polygon, just launched in early December. Through this program, customers can earn extras such as NFTs and Web3 experiences. If other brands follow suit, this could jump-start a larger trend and generate renewed interest in Ethereum as the go-to blockchain for brands and consumer-facing businesses.\n\nAnother market opportunity involves crypto payments. According to Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum, this is where all the work that has been done to increase transaction speeds and improve scalability for the Ethereum blockchain can really pay off. Basically, once blockchains can consistently process large amounts of transactions faster than the Visa (V 1.20%) payments network, we could see a migration of payments to the blockchain. As might be imagined, this would be a huge win for Ethereum. Encouragingly, Visa released a technical paper at the end of 2022 that outlined the possibility of recurring payments being handled via Ethereum one day.\n\nThe outlook for Ethereum\n\nI'm cautiously optimistic about Ethereum in 2023. The overall macroeconomic outlook continues to weigh heavily on all cryptos, and it will be a tough task for Ethereum to surge in value if the economy tips into recession.\n\nHowever, I'm super-bullish on Ethereum for the long term. The blockchain continues to generate fantastic new market opportunities on a regular basis. If any of these new opportunities turn out to be home runs, then Ethereum might just be a three-bagger in 2023."

        "content": "A handful of Ethereum-based layer-2 projects have been on a tear in the past week, with some of the sector\u2019s associated token prices now up considerably in year-to-date (YTD) terms.\n\nTraders are now speculating on a March launch of the next major Ethereum upgrade, dubbed Shanghai, which would enable the withdrawal of staked ether from validators, a planned change that has been anticipated move from industry participants since the Merge.\n\n\u201cVolatility has been at its lowest in the crypto market in the past weeks,\u201d David Cicoria, head of quantitative development at crypto custodian Hex Trust, told Blockworks. \u201cThis coupled with the announcement of lower interest rates, Ethereum\u2019s upcoming Shanghai upgrade, and FOMO from some investors has pushed prices up for layer-2 tokens.\u201d\n\nAs such, several projects built around Ethereum are posting double-digit gains including the open protocol \u2014 aimed at decentralized exchange order books \u2014 Loopring whose token, LRC, is up more than 18% YTD.\n\nOptimism, an EVM-compatible optimistic rollup chain that batch transactions before settling to Ethereum\u2019s mainnet, has seen its OP token rise more than 25% over the same period. Daily transactions for the network hit an all-time high on Monday, etching just below 700,000.\n\nRival optimistic rollup Arbitrum\u2019s daily transaction count has been ranging between 200,000 and 400,000, per data from Nansen.\n\nEthereum liquid staking solution Lido DAO\u2019s token, LDO, is also up an eye-watering 80% since the new year and has continued to post considerable gains in the past week, clocking a 65% gain when viewed over a seven-day period. The project now stands as a top contender for total value locked at $6.5 billion, DeFiLlama data show.\n\nAnd layer-2 scaling solution designed for NFTs using zero-knowledge rollup (zk-rollup) technology, Immutable X, is flashing 23% gains on its token since the new year began.\n\nThe sector seeks to increase the value of Ethereum and related networks by reducing fees, improving scalability and bolstering transaction throughput \u2014 often a gripe levied at blockchain infrastructure that optimizes for security and decentralization.\n\nIt comes as digital assets have continued to struggle under the weight of an industry-wide blowout courtesy of FTX in the fourth quarter of 2022, as well as recent questions hanging over Digital Currency Group and its subsidiaries.\n\nThe spot market for most digital assets also experienced a brief reprieve on Monday, sending the price of bitcoin higher on the day, establishing itself above the pivotal $17,000 level.\n\nNone of this impresses Bitcoin maximalists like Samson Mow, Founder and CEO of Pixelmatic, who instead anticipate a market rebound to finally take shape courtesy of bitcoin\u2019s next halving event.\n\n\u201cEthereum and its layer two tokens are created and tweaked to bring hype and price movement to satiate high-time preference speculators,\u201d Mow told Blockworks. \u201cNone of it is very interesting to Bitcoiners.\u201d\n\nCicoria also remains skeptical of the latest upturn: \u201cThe crypto market remains fragile, with a lot of unknowns still to consider.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "Cryptocurrencies To Watch: Week of January 9 - Investopedia",
        "content": "Keep an Eye on These Coins\n\nIs the crypto market on the verge of breaking out of the doldrums? That\u2019s not certain, but the asset class looks healthier than last week. Most cryptocurrencies are above where they were last week, with green across the board. However, there\u2019s no guarantee that the tokens will continue upward. What is notable is that a handful of assets clearly outperformed the market last week.\n\nThis week we examine Solana (SOL), Ethereum Classic (ETC), The Graph (GRT), Optimism (OP), Decentraland (MANA), and Ethereum (ETH). In selecting these assets, we have considered several factors, including, but not limited to, positive technical developments, significant news events, and noticeable changes in price.\n\n\n\nKey Takeaways The price of Solana (SOL) increased by a massive 45% in the past week as a result of the Solana-based BONK token becoming popular.\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC) saw its token increase by 30% in the past seven days after a favorable turnaround in the network\u2019s hashrate.\n\nThe Graph (GRT) experienced a 22% increase in the past week after news of its ecosystem\u2019s expansion and the number of indexers increased.\n\nThe Optimism (OP) token went up by over 35% in a week as a result of bullish sentiment related to its rollups.\n\nDecentraland\u2019s MANA token increased by approximately 29% in the past seven days, thanks to an increased interest in gaming and metaverse tokens, as well as it is represented in CME\u2019s new reference rates.\n\nEthereum (ETH) also saw a sizable jump of 10% over the week, thanks to the upcoming Shanghai upgrade.\n\n\n\nSolana (SOL)\n\nSolana (SOL) was one of the biggest gainers in the past seven days, with the coin increasing by about 45%. This was partly due to the fact that the Solana-based meme coin, BONK, took the crypto community storm, with its own valuation increasing by 1000% in the last week.Solana\u2019s active user base also increased significantly over the week. The number of daily active wallets increased by 3x from pre-FTX levels.\n\nThe Solona blockchain network made news last week due to its efforts to rebuild itself after the collapse of FTX. The Solana Foundation, which holds approximately 3.24 million shares of FTX Trading LTD common stock, along with about 3.43 million FTT tokens and 134.54 million SRM tokens from the decentralized exchange (DEX), Project Serum, is now trying to move forward without Sam Bankman-Fried's help.\n\nSolana is currently priced at around $16.55 after having started last week at $11.30.\n\nSolona (TradingView).\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC)\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC) saw its price increase by 30% after a critical change in the hash rate of the network. In simple terms, the hash rate refers to how fast a crypto mining machine works.\n\nCurrently, Ethereum Classic's hash rate is 107.58 TH/s, up nearly 10% from its December 2022 low. A faster mining speed means more transactions on the network, and therefore more profitability.\n\nETC is currently trading for around $21.26.\n\n\n\nEthereum Classic (TradingView).\n\nThe Graph (GRT)\n\nThe Graph (GRT) saw its token increase by 22% in price as a result of an increase in the number of projects working on the network. It also saw a rise in the number of indexers, which likely also contributed to the price growth. The token is now priced at around $0.07.\n\nThere are currently over 600 decentralized apps, or DApps, on The Graph, while there are over 300 indexers. Together, this helps boost the ecosystem and increases usability.\n\n\n\nThe Graph (TradingView).\n\nOptimism (OP)\n\nOptimism\u2019s OP token increased by 35% as a result of all the positive sentiment surrounding the rollup technology. The Layer 2 scaling solution is one of the most well-known projects implementing the rollup technology. Through these scaling solutions, blockchain networks are made faster and more secure.\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin also provided some details on rollup scaling, which no doubt added brought some attention to Optimism. It is among those scaling projects which will have an eventful 2023. The OP token is currently valued at around $1.31.\n\nOptimism (TradingView).\n\nDecentraland (MANA)\n\nMetaverses and blockchain-based gaming remain on the radar of investors, and Decentraland\u2019s MANA token is a strong beneficiary of the revival in this niche. The token went up by 29% consequently.\n\nThe CME Group revealed that it would add reference rates and real-time indexes for metaverse crypto assets, with Decentraland being one of them. This might be primarily the reason why the MANA token shot up in value. The token started last week at $0.31. It is currently priced at around $0.40.\n\n\n\nDecentraland (TradingView).\n\nEthereum (ETH)\n\nThe market\u2019s second largest token, Ether, saw its price increase by 10% as the network is about to experience its Shanghai upgrade. The latter will be a major shift for Ethereum, as it will allow staked tokens to be unstaked.\n\nEthereum introduced staking when it switched to the proof-of-stake consensus mechanism last year. However, those who staked could not unlock their tokens until the Shanghai upgrade was introduced. This major upgrade will change that and mark another major moment in Ethereum\u2019s history. ETH started last week at $1,216. It is now hovering at around $1,322.\n\n\n\nEthereum (TradingView).\n\nInvesting in cryptocurrencies and other initial coin offerings (ICOs) is highly risky and speculative, and this article is not a recommendation by Investopedia or the writer to invest in cryptocurrencies or other ICOs.

        "content": "ETH Stakers May Be Able to Initiate Withdrawals in March\n\nBy: Samuel Haig \u2022 Loading...\n\nByte\n\nStakers may soon be able to withdraw Ether from the Beacon chain, with Ethereum\u2019s devs aiming to deliver the long-awaited upgrade this quarter.\n\nOn Jan. 5, Ethereum developers convened for the first All Core Devs (ACD) call of 2023. During the discussion, devs agreed to deploy public testnets for Ethereum\u2019s next upgrades, Shanghai and Capella, next month. They also set March as a tentative target for the highly awaited upgrades to go live on mainnet.\n\nCommitment\n\nEthereum\u2019s devs reaffirmed their commitment to prioritizing withdrawals for the next upgrades. They agreed to remove all unrelated changes or Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIP) from the Shanghai codebase to minimize the risk of delays to rolling out staked ETH withdrawals.\n\nThe Shanghai fork and Capella upgrades will take place on Ethereum\u2019s execution and consensus layers respectively.\n\nStaked ETH withdrawals are being tested on the private dev-only testnet, Shandong.\n\nClient Combinations\n\nBarnabus Busa, a devops engineer with the Ethereum Foundation, said that while all execution and consensus layer clients are currently running on Shandong, a handful of client combinations are experiencing issues.\n\nBusa added that Ethereum\u2019s devs are currently working to launch a new private devnet as soon as possible.\n\nEthereum\u2019s devs will also replace their bi-weekly with monthly ACD Execution and ACD Consensus calls to focus on each layer\u2019s future upgrades separately moving forward.\n\nThe Shanghai fork is the network\u2019s next major upgrade after The Merge unified Ethereum\u2019s Proof of Stake consensus layer, the Beacon Chain, with its existing mainnet execution layer. The Merge booted Proof of Work miners from the network, reducing Ethereum\u2019s energy consumption by more than 99.9% and new Ether issuance by nearly 90%.\n\nThe Merge went live 22 months after the Beacon Chain went live on Dec. 1, 2022. Ethereum detractors recently criticized that Ether stakers are still unable to withdraw staked ETH from the beacon chain more than two years after its launch.\n\nWithdrawals and Layoffs at Huobi Spark Concern Solvency Fears Mount At Yet Another Centralized Exchange\n\n\u201cThe first Shanghai public testnet will go live by the end of February with a mainnet release scheduled for sometime in March, tweeted Anthony Sassano, the host of The Daily Gwei podcast. \u201cBut I was told staking withdrawals were never coming to Ethereum and that Vitalik was holding my ETH hostage forever?\u201d\n\nStakers have deposited 15.9M Ether (worth $20.8B) or around 13% of ETH\u2019s supply on the Beacon Chain to date.\n\nEthereum\u2019s next major upgrade after Shanghai will be the Cancun fork, which may go live later this year. Cancun will include EIP-4844, also known as Proto-Danksharding or The Surge, which is tipped to increase the scalability of Layer 2 rollups by 100 times and prime Ethereum for sharding.\n\nContract Engine\n\nCancun may also introduce a new contract format to the Ethereum Virtual Machine, Ethereum\u2019s core smart contract engine, called the EVM Object Format (EOF). Developers including Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum\u2019s co-founder and chief scientist, and Marius Van der Wijden of Geth expressed concerns about rushing the implementation of EOF.\n\nThe next ACD Execution call will discuss whether EOF should be included in Cancun."

        "title": "Ethereum (ETH) Might Lead New Rally, Start Expected in Q1, 2023: Opinion - U.Today",
        "content": "Advertisement\n\nProminent Bitcoin (BTC) mining entrepreneur Jiang Zhuoer, CEO of BTC.TOP and B.TOP mining firms, shared his forecast on the first phase of the next bullish rally in crypto. While the run might start in a few months, its scenario might be different to what we witnessed in previous cycles.\n\nOptimistic and pessimistic forecasts by industry veteran\n\nMr. Jiang Zhuoer took to Twitter to share his estimations of the prospects of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) in the next bullish rally. He attempts to compare the ongoing cycle with those of 2014 and 2018. As such, he publishes two scenarios for cryptocurrency bulls, an optimistic and a pessimistic one.\n\n1/ I would like to discuss our current position in the Bitcoin market cycle.\n\nStarting from the previous Bitcoin (BTC) all-time high (ATH) and ending with the next halving, #BTC crossed the bear market bottom in 2014 and 2018, respectively. pic.twitter.com/IAq4U7q0iJ \u2014 Jiang Zhuoer BTC.TOP (@JiangZhuoer) January 9, 2023\n\nIf the November 2022 decline triggered by the FTX drama was the ultimate bottom of this cycle, the four-year period remains valid for every major cycle in crypto. As such, the potential collapse of Digital Currency Group, which is being widely discussed in the media, is already priced in and will not affect the price significantly.\n\nThen, while the new upsurge is almost imminent, the market can follow one of two scenarios. If the optimistic one plays out, the rally might start two months after the last phase of \"sideways\" moves.\n\nThe pessimistic scenario, meanwhile, opens the road to an eight-month painful \"sideways\" period. Thus, cryptocurrency capitalization might start its new rally in early Q4, 2023.\n\nFirst Ethereum (ETH), then Bitcoin (BTC)\n\nAlso, Mr. Jiang Zhuoer is fascinated by the prospects of Ethereum (ETH) compared with Bitcoin (BTC). As this is the first time, Ethereum (ETH) meets with EIP-1559 activated and on a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus, Ethereum (ETH) is exposed to trivial inflation:\n\nMore specifically, looking at the data of Ethereum (ETH), the inflation rate was 3.59% when ETH was in Proof-of-Work (POW). Bitcoin's inflation rate is 1.72%. Even after the bear market, with the inactive coin burning, the ETH inflation rate is as low as 0.01%.\n\nBesides that, Ethereum's (ETH) price decline during this bearish cycle is only 80% of that of the largest cryptocurrency, which is yet another indicator of Ether's maturity as an asset.\n\nAs such, Ethereum (ETH) will start rising earlier than Bitcoin (BTC); the first spike can be expected between March and May 2023, Mr. Jiang Zhuoer says.\n\nAs covered by U.Today previously, in March, 2022, Mr. Jiang Zhuoer criticised \"permanent bulls\" for their lack of common sense."

        "title": "Are the Ethereum Killers Still Deadly? - Finance Magnates",
        "content": "Back in 2021, and heading into 2022, there was a dominant crypto narrative around the idea of Ethereum killers.\n\nThis referred to rival Layer 1 blockchains that were geared towards smart contract transactions and could be used for all the things that Ethereum was known for, enabling networks of decentralized applications.\n\nEthereum killers would run DeFi, facilitate NFT creation and trading, and open up new landscapes for web3 development.\n\nWhat made these competitors a supposedly existential threat to Ethereum was that they would be so technically superior, cheaper more efficient and at least equally secure, that, with crypto still in a formative stage, Ethereum itself might become obsolete.\n\nThe Takeover Never Happened\n\nLooking back from the start of 2023, we can see that this proposed takeover, after which Ethereum would be relegated to the sidelines, never occurred.\n\nIn the heat and euphoria of an extended bull run, ambitious proclamations can sound viable, but as sentiment shifted ever downwards throughout 2022, there was a sense that time had run out on the Ethereum killers\u2019 opportunities to take the top spot.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Ethereum successfully, after many delays and amid constant doubt, completed the Merge, a process which saw it switch from a Proof of Work to a Proof of Stake consensus mechanism.\n\nThis shift sets the path for Ethereum to scale better, and, eventually, bring down its unsustainable high transaction costs.\n\nSupporters of alternative blockchains will point out that their preferred networks can already scale better than Ethereum and have lower transaction costs built in, and they\u2019d be right to do so: the entire point of an Ethereum killer is that it has better tech than its rivals.\n\nHowever, with hugely significant network effects already on Ethereum\u2019s side, simply enabling the capacity for future improvements is enough to further embed its dominant position.\n\nAs we tentatively begin to consider the possibilities that might arise in a future bullish period, where does this all leave the Ethereum killers?\n\nSolana\n\nA few weeks ago, Solana looked for the count. Having crashed in price from an all-time high of around $260 down to $8 briefly, the network was suffering partly from having been favored by the disgraced Founder of FTX, Sam Bankman-Fried.\n\nTwo of the network\u2019s top NFT projects, DeGods and y00ts, were migrating to other blockchains, and previous criticisms of the network\u2019s unreliability and lack of robust decentralization remained unresolved.\n\nHowever, since then, there has been a much-needed blast of frivolity (and profit-taking) thanks to airdrops of the ridiculously-named, Solana-based BONK token, a supportive tweet from the Founder of Ethereum Vitalik Buterin, and an upwards jump in the price of SOL.\n\nCrypto is a deeply unpredictable space in which the atmosphere can flip overnight via surreal triggers that seem to come out of nowhere, and that\u2019s exactly what is happening with Solana.\n\nThat said, such shifts are not always superficial, the substance of Vitalik\u2019s tweet, that Solana has a \u2018smart developer community\u2019 and has been cleansed of \u2018awful opportunistic money people\u2019, was well received, and it seems increasingly unlikely that the lights have gone out for good on Solana.\n\nThe network still has a loyal community, particularly (and despite the departures of DeGods and y00ts) when it comes to its NFT ecosystem, and it looks capable of riding out current distress.\n\nCheck out the recent London Summit session on \"To Crypto or Not to Crypto: Will Crypto Fizzle Out or Here To Stay.\"\n\nCardano\n\nUnlike Solana, Cardano is not associated with the collapses and scandals of 2022, but nonetheless saw its price crash dramatically throughout the year just gone. In sync with Solana, January has brought Cardano an outsized price boost.\n\nIt\u2019s striking that both Solana and Cardano prices should break out at the same time, since they are, arguably, the two most prominent Ethereum rivals, and perhaps this coupled competitive action is a shape of things to come.\n\nWhere Cardano is distinct, though, is that it now is looking at tackling some very specific real-world problems, perhaps taking Cardano down a unique path.\n\nMost notably, there are Cardano projects working on using the blockchain to enable self-custodial digital identity solutions, and there is also a strong emphasis on reaching new users in Africa.\n\nAtala Prism and IAMX are examples of the former while World Mobile utilizes Cardano for its work in rural Africa.\n\nThe Layer 2 Factor\n\nThe other alternative option for developers, besides utilizing a so-called Ethereum killer, such as Solana or Cardano, is to build on a Layer 2 solution.\n\nLayer 2 refers to a secondary blockchain built on top of or alongside a main blockchain, which takes transactions off the main network to improve efficiency, before finally settling transactions back to the base layer.\n\nPrime among these is Polygon, which operates alongside Ethereum, and recently partnered with Mastercard to become the network of choice for the finance company\u2019s upcoming artist incubator program.\n\nThis news comes after a period in which a stream of famous brands have opted to use Polygon for their web3 strategies.\n\nLooking around the various Layer 1s and sidechains, a possible scenario now starts to resolve into view, sketching out the direction in which smart contract blockchains may be heading.\n\nEthereum looks firmly placed, but activity relating to incoming brands may take place on Polygon, while Arbitrum is another notable Layer 2 option.\n\nMeanwhile, Solana and Cardano look likely to remain relevant, but rather than superseding Ethereum (which was always a tall order), can instead start to define their own specialties and niche applications.\n\nBeyond these protocols, further alternatives are in the mix too, including Avalanche and BNB Chain, and they should be kept in mind when the market picks up, always remembering that narratives can shift quickly."

        "content": "BitDAO has launched the testnet for its modular Ethereum Layer 2 network project called Mantle with 37,000 developers already signed up for the launch, the DAO stated on Tuesday.\n\nDubbed \u201cWadsley,\u201d the testnet will enable Mantle to test and implement new features for the chain before the mainnet launch scheduled for later in the year. The testnet is available to the public and developers have been urged to sign up to test their apps on the chain.\n\nBitDAO announced Mantle in November as a modular Ethereum Layer 2 network. Modular networks have separate layers for handling network functions such as consensus, transaction execution and settlement. They are a newer take on blockchain design that is different from older monolithic chains where all network functions occurred on the same base layer.\n\nBitDAO\u2019s announcement on Tuesday reiterated that Mantle will deliver faster finality at cheaper transaction costs. The chain will also utilize multi-party computation, the announcement added. This type of computation sees the use of nodes specially designed to handle off-chain transactions correctly. Multi-party computation is one of the ways Layer 2 networks try to minimize the risk involved in transactions executed outside the base layer of a blockchain network.\n\nBitDAO token utility\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nThe Mantle launch is also expected to boost the utility of BitDAO\u2019s governance token, called bit. This is because bit will function as the native token of the Layer 2 network. Improving bit utility has become a major focus for the DAO. The community voted in favor of a $100 million token buyback in December 2022.\n\nA BitDAO spokesperson told The Block that using bit as the native token for Mantle will foster the growth of the DAO\u2019s ecosystem. BitDAO is an outlier in the DAO space as it is set up to support a single DeFi project as is the case with most DAOs. Instead, BitDAO is an investment DAO that seeks to grow its ecosystem by supporting a network of projects. It holds the second-largest treasury among DAOs with $1.9 billion currently in its reserves.\n\n\u201cA large ecosystem of partners already exists and will continue to grow within BitDAO. Mantle is the blockchain that binds all of this together and helps build value for each moving part,\u201d said a BitDAO spokesperson."

        "content": "The sight of a forlorn and dishevelled Sam Bankman-Fried, former CEO of one of the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, being led away in handcuffs in the Bahamas last month aptly embodied the current plight of an entire industry. After numerous scandals and trillions of dollars wiped off its value in 2022, crypto finds itself on its knees with the vultures circling. Systemic change now seems unavoidable, and the industry can either take the bull by the horns or be forced to by the red-tape mafia waiting in the wings.\n\nCryptocurrency mining rigs at a facility in Quebec, Canada. (Photo by James MacDonald/Bloomberg via Getty Images)\n\nA good place to start would be the industry\u2019s outsized environmental footprint, which currently exceeds that of many countries. Yet some within the industry are rising to the challenge. In September 2022, Ethereum, the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency platform (\u2018ether\u2019 is second only to Bitcoin), almost nullified its power demand through an event called the Merge. By replacing the blockchain\u2019s \u201cproof-of-work\u201d (PoW) mining mechanism with an alternative coined \u201cproof-of-stake\u201d (PoS), Ethereum cut its electricity consumption by 99.84% \u2013 a reduction equivalent to the annual power requirements of Ireland or Austria.\n\nAlthough energy consumption is just one part of crypto\u2019s environmental problems, and it would be premature to declare the Merge an outright victory, the move does offer cryptocurrencies everywhere a possible path towards environmental sustainability. Whether they choose to follow it is another matter.\n\nAlthough estimates of the total environmental footprint of all crypto assets vary, it is thought that the electricity demand of Bitcoin alone exceeded 13GW, with an associated carbon footprint of more than 65 million tonnes of CO2 (MtCO2), in 2021. That demand is just over half that of all global data centres combined and represents nearly 0.5% of global electricity consumption. The associated carbon footprint is bigger than the global CO2 reduction created by all electric vehicles. On top of that, other cryptocurrencies were estimated \u2013 prior to the Merge \u2013 to add another 50% to Bitcoin\u2019s energy demand.\n\nOne recent study indicated that Bitcoin has a greater climate impact than gold mining. The research from the University of New Mexico judged the climate cost of various commodities in relation to their overall market capitalisation. The results found that the climate damage from producing Bitcoin has averaged 35% of its market value over the past five years, peaking at 82% in 2020. That is comparable to 33% for beef production or 46% for natural gas extraction.\n\n\u201cSince Ethereum\u2019s Merge, I would hazard an educated guess that Bitcoin now represents 90% of crypto\u2019s environmental footprint,\u201d says Alex de Vries, a digital currencies researcher at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, the Netherlands.\n\nHow well do you really know your competitors?

Crypto also has an issue with electronic waste. The hardware used to mine the various cryptocurrencies regularly becomes obsolete. In fact, the annual electronic waste of Bitcoin is equivalent to that of the Netherlands. \u201cAnd that is just Bitcoin,\u201d says Carmine Russo, formerly a visiting researcher at the Centre for Climate Finance & Investment at Imperial College Business School, UK, and now a PhD researcher at the University of Naples Federico II, Italy. \u201cBut consider that there are more than 20,000 cryptocurrencies out there!\u201d\n\nShifting to green crypto\n\nAs crypto\u2019s climate impact has become ever more apparent, regulators have begun sharpening their knives. In some places, the bloodletting has already started. In spring 2021, the Chinese government cited environmental concerns as it introduced a countrywide ban on crypto mining \u2013 effectively evicting most of Bitcoin\u2019s global mining network.\n\nIn March 2022, the European Parliament toyed with a similar ban but settled instead on additional environmental disclosures for crypto asset service providers from 2024. However, the European Central Bank wrote in a July report that it was \u201chighly unlikely\u201d that European authorities would not pursue crypto mining further \u2013 and potentially ban it outright.\n\nIn the US, the state of New York is poised to introduce new legislation banning cryptocurrency miners from receiving behind-the-meter power from fossil fuel plants. However, mine operators that have already filed paperwork for new or renewal permits are exempt, including the controversial Greenidge Generating Station on the western shore of Seneca Lake. Additionally, a report from the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy released in September 2022 recommended promoting \u201cenvironmentally responsible crypto-asset technologies\u201d. Legislation to \u201climit or eliminate\u201d energy-intensive cryptocurrency mining should be introduced if other measures prove ineffective, it added.\n\nChange is also coming from within. In 2021, a coalition of around 200 cryptocurrencies teamed up with think tank RMI to create the Crypto Climate Accord. The signatories agreed to reduce the carbon emissions from their electricity consumption to net zero by 2030, partly using carbon offsets but also by switching all blockchain technology to renewable energy sources by 2025 and using energy tracking tools such as so-called green hashtags.\n\nArguably the largest shot in the arm for the green crypto agenda, however, has come from Ethereum\u2019s Merge \u2013 a small change in the software that effectively replaces the energy-intensive mining process altogether. Blockchains, the technology underlying cryptocurrency, are literal chains of blocks of data; updates to the network are processed within those blocks, which are then added to the end of the chain. No single party is in charge of that process; instead, anyone can proffer their computer hardware to assist in the block-creation process, with a reward offered for every created block. The difference between Bitcoin\u2019s PoW and Ethereum\u2019s PoS relates to how new blocks are added to the blockchain.\n\nWith PoW, the block-creation process is purposely made computationally challenging. New blocks are added to the blockchain only when a \u201cminer\u201d obtains a valid PoW, which can be achieved only through an iterative process of trial and error that is \u201cbest described as a numeric guessing game\u201d, says de Vries. A correct guess completes a block, allowing the winner to add it to the blockchain and claim the reward. The more guesses the miner can generate, the greater their chance of winning. The process repeats indefinitely after every newly created block. \u201cBefore the Merge, the Ethereum network generated around 900 billion of these guesses every second of the day, non-stop,\u201d says de Vries.\n\nWith PoS, however, the network does not incentivise participants, or \u201cminters\u201d, to compete on computational power to create new blocks. Instead, the block selection process is primarily based on wealth. Minters must buy some of the native currency from a cryptocurrency platform, which is then used as collateral in the \u201cstaking\u201d process \u2013 a minimum of 32 units of Ether, in Ethereum\u2019s case. The software then randomly chooses a \u201cstaker\u201d to create the next block for the blockchain. The larger the amount staked, the greater the chance of being chosen. While minters still need a device with sufficient storage capacity and an active internet connection, the computational power of the device is irrelevant. This negates the need for vast mining networks of electricity-gorging computers. \u201cA laptop will suffice,\u201d says Russo.\n\nEthereum\u2019s transition to PoS has reduced its power demand by between 99.84% and 99.9996%, according to a range of estimates, setting a benchmark for decarbonising the world\u2019s remaining PoW-reliant cryptocurrencies. \u201cThis is the solution to getting rid of the majority of crypto\u2019s energy consumption,\u201d says de Vries. \u201cIt solves almost the entirety of the industry's environmental impact.\u201d\n\nIndirectly, it goes a long way to solving crypto\u2019s e-waste problem, explains Russo. \u201cBecause the participants aren\u2019t competing on computational power, they just need a laptop to confirm a transaction, rather than huge amounts of computer hardware that regularly needs replacing when it becomes obsolete.\u201d\n\nNo panacea\n\nHowever, despite the evident promise of the Merge, the purported 99% reduction of Ethereum\u2019s power demand does not quite tell the whole story. The \u2018ASICS\u2019 devices that used to mine PoW Ethereum can still be used to mine the cryptocurrencies Ethereum Classic and EthereumPoW \u2013 a spinoff that maintains the PoW mechanism. Indeed, days after the Merge, the pair had absorbed a quarter of Ethereum\u2019s hashrate (the marker of its mining activity) \u2013 and it was still around a fifth a month later.\n\nFurthermore, the GPUs (a type of computer hardware) formerly used to mine Ethereum can be repurposed to mine other cryptocurrencies, thereby negating some of the Merge\u2019s saved power consumption. However, that would likely come at a cost to miners. For instance, miners on Ethereum Classic can only earn around $0.5m a day compared with the $22.1m they could make from mining Ethereum \u2013 in turn reducing the power expenses they can afford. \u201cI\u2019m mining at a loss,\u201d TheCrowbill, an Ethereum Classic miner, told The Defiant on 27 September. \u201cProbably will remain that way for some time.\u201d\n\n[Keep up with Energy Monitor: Subscribe to our weekly newsletter]\n\nSimilarly, many of the GPUs may have been repurposed to focus on other energy-intensive activities such as cloud computing, AI and gaming. There is also a suspicion that Bitcoin miners have pounced on the data centre space that has become available as result of the Merge. Between 250,000 and 500,000 Bitcoin mining devices are thought to remain unused for a lack of data centre rack space.\n\nFinally, although the Merge makes Ethereum one of most energy-efficient cryptocurrencies, it still remains less efficient than more centralised alternatives. The underlying blockchain technology replicates data and processes over thousands of participating devices, resulting in more data redundancy and higher associated energy costs from maintaining multiple copies. For example, for the roughly 1.1 million transactions a day that Ethereum processes since the Merge, the average electricity consumed per transaction ranges from 0.8 to 14.7 watt-hours (Wh). A Mastercard transaction, by contrast, consumes just 0.7Wh on average.\n\nConverting Bitcoin\u2019s sceptics\n\nNonetheless, many of these issues would be redundant if all cryptocurrencies switched from PoW to PoS. So, unlike many industries, crypto\u2019s path to decarbonisation appears relatively simple. The very sizeable snag, however, is that the Bitcoin community \u2013 the source of the lion\u2019s share of remaining emissions \u2013 has shown little willingness to make the move.\n\nThe Change the Code campaign launched by Greenpeace in 2022 aimed to convince Bitcoin to ditch PoW, but it was met with outright hostility by much of the community. They see the software\u2019s immutability as one of its foundational strengths and the source of its enduring value, and due to the network\u2019s decentralised structure, it is hard to imagine convincing the entire community to make the jump.\n\n\u201cThe solution is there, but now you need to get this really stubborn community to think about adopting it,\u201d says de Vries. \u201cThat is the hard part, especially since there is nobody in charge who can enforce the decision.\u201d\n\nIt is made even more difficult by the fact that many in that community are notoriously unconcerned by climate change. \u201cA lot of the loudest influencers in the Bitcoin community are climate change deniers, who often make statements like, \u2018we breathe out carbon, so how can it be so bad?\u2019\u201d adds de Vries.\n\nEthereum has, however, proven that it is possible to convince a disparate, doubting community to shift to PoS, without any resulting increase in much-dreaded centralisation. The apparent success of the Merge may convert a fair few of Bitcoin\u2019s doubters. \u201cYou don\u2019t necessarily need to convince the entire Bitcoin community,\u201d notes de Vries. \u201cYou just need a critical mass.\"\n\nA transition to PoS by Bitcoin would likely result in more climate benefits than the Merge, as unlike the GPUs formerly used to mine Ethereum, Bitcoin\u2019s ASIC-based devices cannot easily be repurposed.\n\nNet-zero crypto\n\nThe possibility of crypto ever reaching net-zero emissions is inextricably wedded to Bitcoin\u2019s adoption of PoS or a similarly energy-efficient mining mechanism \u2013 and if and when that will happen depends on who you ask. Much will depend on the direction of the price of Bitcoin going forward. \u201cIf the price goes up again consistently, I don\u2019t see the community considering a change in the software,\u201d says de Vries. \u201cBut if it keeps going down, they will have a serious [financial] concern on their hands and will be much more willing to contemplate changes.\u201d\n\nIf governments were to slam a range of adverse regulations on Bitcoin for continuing to use PoW, de Vries also believes much of the community would soon change its tune. \u201cIn the end, money talks,\u201d he says.\n\nConsidering the Merge reduced Ethereum\u2019s power consumption by 99%, Russo believes that if all the other cryptocurrencies followed suit, the industry could reach net zero \u201cin a few years\u201d. He points out that it took Ethereum five years to complete the transition. \u201cSo let's say that on average, we need ten years to do this with other cryptocurrencies,\u201d he says. \u201cI think in 15 years, if crypto still exists, it will be a much more sustainable environment.\u201d\n\nUltimately, for Bitcoin, the writing is on the wall \u2013 or, more accurately, in the source code. Around 19 million of the planned 21 million Bitcoins have already been created. And when that quota is filled, there will be no incentive for mining left. That will be great news for the environment; the only downside is that is not forecast to happen until 2140. \u201cFor humanity\u2019s sake, let\u2019s hope it doesn\u2019t come down to that,\u201d says de Vries."

        "content": "Arguably the most popular blockchain amongst developers building decentralized applications (dApps), the Ethereum Network is credited with introducing the Web3 community to innovations like smart contracts while maintaining robust security standards.\n\nHowever, in order to solve Ethereum\u2019s scalability issue, a new type of Layer-2 (L2) blockchain was introduced that relies on the Ethereum Mainnet (Layer-1) for its security but processes transactions on separate third-party networks in order to increase throughput speeds.\n\nEVM compatibility for higher transaction speeds\n\nImportantly, developers had to ensure that these L2 blockchains were compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), a run-time environment where Ethereum\u2019s application code and smart contracts are executed, EVM compatibility ensures that smart contracts can be executed in a cross-chain environment, enabling Web3 developers to build dApps that can interact seamlessly with each other.\n\nAs a result, a number of decentralized finance (DeFi), gaming, and social dApps are built and hosted on L2 blockchains, marking a decided shift in Web3 developers\u2019 preferences away from the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nEventually, L2 blockchains started innovating with new solutions and technologies that could reduce transaction fees or gas and ramp up the network\u2019s speed to cater to a wider audience. However, L2 blockchains have found it difficult to achieve hyper-scale without compromising on security standards because of the bridges or sidechains they employ. Therefore, in order to achieve both hyper-scale performance and Ethereum\u2019s unparalleled security, a new kind of modular L2 blockchain had to be envisaged to provide a future-proof building platform for Web3 innovators.\n\nNext-gen Layer 2 solutions\n\nIntroducing Mantle - a high-performance Ethereum Layer-2 network that leverages a separate decentralized data availability layer and combines it with Ethereum roll-ups to open up even more use cases for developers building on the Mantle ecosystem.\n\nBy separating execution, data availability, and transaction finality into separate layers, Mantle offers Ethereum-level security while increasing transaction speeds through reduced inefficiencies. In fact, transaction-related data is solidified on Mantle\u2019s L2 before being broadcasted onto Ethereum, effectively trimming the challenge period and providing faster finality to the end user. In this way, Mantle is able to effectively utilize Ethereum\u2019s massive trust network while eliminating possible blockspace congestion through its modular design.\n\nAs a result of these improvements, game developers can now build more elements on-chain without worrying about high transaction fees or struggling with poor end-user experience. Even advanced DeFi protocols that provide margin trading and other complex DeFi strategies can be developed and operated at a low cost, paving the way for much wider user adoption.\n\nA product of BitDAO, Mantle is one example of how L2 blockchains can make Web3 technology more accessible. Moreover, the project shows how a blockchain built by a community-owned DAO can leverage member feedback and crowdsourced decision-making to constantly upgrade.\n\nAs more users and developers gravitate towards platforms like Mantle, the future of Web3 will focus more on modular L2 blockchains that can offer Ethereum\u2019s trust while delivering lightning-fast speeds.\n\nMaterial is provided in partnership with Mantle"

        "title": "So Gary, are cryptocurrencies securities? - Fintech Nexus",
        "content": "The regulatory context for cryptocurrencies continues to be vague, with many considering it a significant barrier to the mainstream development of the sector.\n\nAt the center of the issue for some jurisdictions (the U.S. specifically) is the definition of whether they are securities.\n\nMike Castiglione, Director of Regulatory Affairs and Digital Assets at Eventus\n\nWhile much of the world has decided on its definitions, the SEC continues to grapple with the idea, caught in endless battles with Ripple and additional cases.\n\n\u201cOne of the big questions is, why do we define this thing? It\u2019s an emergent technology. It\u2019s still being applied to the real world, so what\u2019s the value of defining it?\u201d said Mike Castiglione, Director of Regulatory Affairs for Digital Assets at Eventus. \u201cThe answer is to align incentives better so businesses can understand the rules.\u201d\n\nThe year ahead could bring several defining conclusions on this matter, which could shape the crypto world as we know it.\n\nEurope says, \u2018No\u2019\n\nIn late November 2022, Belgium\u2019s Financial Services and Markets Authority (FSMA) made their conclusive announcement that bitcoin, ethereum, and other decentralized coins are not securities. The opinion was a result of the introduction of a \u201cstepwise plan\u201d applying a series of questions as to the token\u2019s functionality to define them on a case-by-case basis.\n\nAmong other parameters, the report accompanying the announcement stated, \u201cIf there is no issuer, as in cases where a computer code creates instruments and this is not done in execution of an agreement between issuer and investor (for example, bitcoin or Ether), then in principle the Prospectus Regulation, the Prospectus Law and the MiFID rules of conduct do not apply.\u201d\n\nYves Longchamp, Head of Research at SEBA Bank\n\nThis does not leave the tokens exempt from all regulation, but it resolves a defining issue surrounding digital currencies that has the SEC stumped.\n\nBelgium is one of many jurisdictions to come to a similar conclusion.\n\n\u201cIn the Swiss law, you fundamentally have three types of currency,\u201d said Yves Longchamp, Head of Research at SEBA Bank. \u201cYou have a payment token, you have utility tokens, and you have security tokens. We see all these layer one cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ethereum are either payment tokens or utility tokens.\u201d\n\nHe explained that to acquire this definition, the tokens are seen as currencies in a \u201cdigital country.\u201d This extends to the introduction of staking (in the case of ethereum) as they are considered similar to bank deposits gaining interest.\n\n\u201cA lot of these definitions, whether commodity or security, hinge on whether someone has a right to the profits of an entity or profits of the company,\u201d said Castiglione, commenting on the U.S. problem. \u201cAnother part is can you transfer it? Is there a secondary market in the crypto asset?\u201d\n\n\u201cAdditionally, whether something is a security or a commodity, there are rules about how you can treat investors, purchasers, or issuers in the marketplace. However, there are activities, irrespective of the definition, that are illegal and against regulations.\u201d\n\nThe U.S.\u2019s Ongoing Battle\n\nChairman of the SEC, Gary Gensler, among others, continues to debate the definition. On multiple occasions, the SEC has attempted to prove statements that various cryptocurrencies are securities. (Note: Gensler has admitted that bitcoin is not)\n\nHowever, on Dec. 13, 2022, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) of the United States defined bitcoin, ethereum, and Tether, among others, definitively as commodities. This statement was included as part of the filing against FTX.\n\nOne would assume that this settles matters. Alas, this is not the case.\n\nThe thorn in everyone\u2019s side\n\nA conversation on the classification of cryptocurrencies would not be complete without a mention of Ripple.\n\nThe SEC has been caught in a seemingly endless battle following a case filed in December 2020 where they stated that Ripple was selling unregistered securities. A ruling is hoped to be passed in early 2023.\n\nAccording to the SEC, on applying the Howey test to XRP, the coin could be considered a security. They have determined that the business, Ripple Labs, sold the tokens, and investment in the tokens would constitute an investment in a joint enterprise. Due to the marketing efforts and supply manipulation, investors could have expected the value of their investment to rise.\n\nThe case is significant because many consider the ruling to be definitive of a decision on the rest of the digital token industry. Regardless of the verdict, it could provide clarity on which others can base their model. However, many are concerned that an unfavorable ruling may constrict the development of the crypto industry.\n\nThe deadline for judgment is set for late January 2023.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Merge created confusion\n\nBefore the CFTC\u2019s statement, ethereum was also thrust into the SEC\u2019s firing line due to their shift to a Proof of Stake consensus mechanism, an event titled \u201cThe Merge.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere seems to be an agreement that bitcoin is a commodity, therefore not a security. Why? Because we don\u2019t know who the issuer is. It\u2019s fully decentralized right now,\u201d said Castiglione.\n\n\u201cOn the other side, there seems to be an agreement that the ICOs, or initial coin offerings that you saw in 2017, are securities. There\u2019s a regulatory mess that came with that because that looked like organized, defined entities issuing tokens to raise funds to develop their protocol and develop their business. So that looked very much like security.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen there\u2019s a theory from the SEC that a token can morph. It can start as a security. And then, if it\u2019s sufficiently decentralized, it could lose this classification.\u201d\n\nA \u201csecurity\u201d stamp was staved off by apparent decentralization.\n\nEthereum, in its infancy, was wrapped up in the debate due to this ICO issue. The coin prevailed, but due to the Merge in September, their classification was brought back into question. The shift of consensus mechanism found much of the staking activity to reside within the US. This was used in an insider trading lawsuit against Ian Balina to define ethereum, once again, as a security.\n\nRELATED: Merge happened; now what?\n\nUltimately the community has rejected this definition; however, it could mark a deficiency in the definition to date. The Howey test, traditionally used to make the determination, may not be up to the task given the blockchain development.\n\nWhere do we go now?\n\n\u201cThere are many ways this can go,\u201d said Castiglione.\n\n\u201cScenario one is we muddle through still, which is doable but costly. If you don\u2019t know whether there\u2019s a referee on the field or what rules the referee will call, it\u2019s just hard to operate with competence.\u201d\n\n\u201cScenario two is that all of this is adjudicated by the courts, so there is more precedent about how to define a crypto security versus commodity. But that can be lengthy and costly, and confrontational. The court option would probably come in response to an enforcement action that someone decides to fight.\u201d\n\n\u201cScenario three involves better definitions based on legislation. In the current environment, there\u2019s consensus that any legislation should come with better definitions, and getting this right is a key element\u201d.\n\nCastiglione explained that both the Digital Commodities Exchange and the U.S. Token Taxonomy bill attempt to clarify this. He believes 2023 will bring a more structured approach that could assist the mainstream adoption of crypto.\n\n\u201cIn the US, several bipartisan pieces of legislation will be reintroduced in early 2023. The main thrust is how to assign regulatory responsibilities between the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).\u201d\n\n\u201cThe core lesson is that regulation is coming. U.S.-based firms can rebuild trust by proactively being transparent and verifying they are following the hard-learned compliance lessons from other, non-crypto financial crises.\u201d"

        "title": "Research: USDC adoption on Ethereum grows post-FTX collapse; USDT remains flat - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "After a brutal sequence of events led to the collapse of several crypto-related firms in 2022, FTX\u2019s bankruptcy dealt a massive blow to public trust in centralized crypto entities.\n\nDuring this period of heightened market volatility, crypto investors preferred Circle\u2019s USD Coin (USDC) to Tether\u2019s USDT. According to Glassnode\u2019s data, while USDT is the largest stablecoin by market cap, USDC has more transfer volume.\n\nAccording to the data, USDC has a transfer volume of $15 billion, while USDT\u2019s volume is $3 billion. Cumulatively, USDC outpaces USDT by $7 trillion.\n\nMeanwhile, the Glassnode chart below shows that the disparity in transfer volume was not always like this. USDT\u2019s volume outperformed that of USDC in 2020 and early 2021. But that changed in 2022 when the Circle-backed stablecoin\u2019s volume started growing.\n\nAt the time, USDT began to face increased regulatory scrutiny about its reserves coupled with Terra\u2019s LUNA collapse, which birthed fears of whether the stablecoin wouldn\u2019t lose its Dollar peg.\n\nUSDC\u2019s balance on exchanges reach $5 billion\n\nIn terms of exchange balances, Glassnode data shows that USDC is beginning to enjoy more adoption post-FTX collapse. According to the data, the USDC on exchanges is approaching $5 billion.\n\nPreviously, USDC\u2019s adoption in 2022 had declined thanks to Binance\u2019s decision to convert its users\u2019 balances in USDC and other stablecoins to its BUSD. However, with the FTX collapse birthing FUD that led to record withdrawals from Binance, USDC\u2019s adoption began to see an uptrend towards the end of the year.\n\nBesides that, Coinbase also urged its users to convert their USDT to USDC for free.\n\nOn the other hand, USDT\u2019s balance on exchanges stayed flat throughout the period \u2013it even saw a slight decline in early January 2023.\n\nPost FTX\u2019s crash, USDT has seen more questions raised about its reserves, with several hedge funds shorting the stablecoin. However, its issuer said Tether would continue to show resilience even in the face of uncertainty.\n\nWith 2023 set to be a risk-off year, the market could likely see further growth among stablecoins. This could set the stage for a fight for dominance between USDT and USDC.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "content": "Lido\u2019s LDO token surged over 50% in the first week of 2023 Photo: thinkhubstudio / Shutterstock\n\nLido (LDO) emerged as the leading Ether (ETH) staking platform in the world by contributing over 30% of all ETH staked, as of January 2023.\n\nThe staking platform\u2019s governance token LDO gained over 50% in the first week of 2023 on expectations that more users will stake their ETH as Ethereum completes its upcoming ' \u2018Shanghai\u2019\u2019 upgrade in March 2023.\n\nWhat is Lido and how does it work? Here we take a look at LDO coin price history, latest news and risks involved with Lido staking.\n\nWhat is Lido?\n\nLido (LDO) is a crypto staking solution currently available on Ethereum, Solana (SOL), Polkadot (DOT) and Kusama (KSM).\n\nStaking is the process of depositing cryptocurrencies as collateral in order to verify and create blocks on proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchains like Ethereum. Stakers gain the chance to earn rewards by validating blocks.\n\nAs of January 2023, staking on Ethereum requires users to lock up their ETH. Ether stakers can withdraw their tokens after the network upgrade called Shanghai, which is expected in the first half of 2023, according to Ethereum\u2019s website.\n\nLido is managed by the Lido Decentralised Autonomous Organisation (DAO). According to its whitepaper, the Lido DAO is responsible for the following:\n\nWhat is your sentiment on ETH/USD? 4036.60 Bullish or Bearish Vote to see Traders sentiment! Market sentiment: Bullish Bearish 91% 9% You voted bullish. You voted bearish. Give ETH/USD a try Start trading Start trading Start trading or Try demo\n\nDeploying Lido smart contracts\n\nSetting platform fees and protocol parameters\n\nRecruiting node operators and validators\n\nManaging insurance and development funds\n\nManaging withdrawals\n\nHow does Lido work?\n\nLido provides liquid staking solutions to users by issuing stETH tokens for ETH staked on its platform on a 1:1 basis.\n\nStakers can use their stETH tokens like regular ETH for trading on crypto exchanges and for various activities across decentralised finance (DeFi) websites.\n\n\u201cLiquid staking protocols allow users to earn staking rewards without locking assets or maintaining staking infrastructure. Users of these protocols can deposit staking tokens and receive tradable liquid tokens in return,\u201d said Lido.\n\nHowever, stakers will only be able to retrieve their staking rewards and redeem stETH for ETH after the completion of Ethereum\u2019s Shanghai upgrade.\n\nAs of 9 January 2023, ETH stakers using Lido were earning at 4.6% annual percentage rate (APR) compared to 4.8% across the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nThe Lido DAO manages the entire staking fund. The platform charges a 10% fee on the earnings which is split between node operators and the Lido DAO. Lido also supported the staking of SOL, DOT and KSM on their native blockchains. At the time of writing, Lido supported MATIC staking on Ethereum.\n\nThere were 54 node operators on Lido across Ethereum, Solana and Polygon. Lido had 29 permissioned node operators on Ethereum, 11 on Solana and 6 on Polygon. As of 9 January 2023, Lido offered a yield of 7.2% APR on SOL staking, 6.3% APR on MATIC staking, 14.8% on DOT staking and 13.9% on KSM staking.\n\nUsers need web3 wallets to stake on Lido. There is no minimum staking amount on Lido.\n\nWhat is LDO coin?\n\nThe LDO coin is the governance token of the Lido DAO.\n\nWhat is lido coin used for? The main purpose of the LDO coin is for voting on Lido\u2019s key parameters like platform fees and other proposed upgrades.\n\nAccording to its whitepaper, LDO voting weight is equal to the amount of LDP a voter stakes in the voting contract.\n\nThe LDO coin launched in December 2020 with a supply of 1 billion tokens. The initial token distribution was as follows:\n\nDAO Treasury - 36.3%\n\nInvestors - 22.2%\n\nDevelopers - 20%\n\nFounders and future employees - 15%\n\nValidators and withdrawal key signers - 6.5%\n\nAs of 9 January 2023, LDO was the 33rd largest cryptocurrency in the world at a market capitalisation of $1.32bn. The current circulating supply stood at about 824 million tokens representing 82% of the max LDO supply.\n\nAccording to CoinMarketCap, over 52% of LDO supply was held by the top 10 holders, as of 9 January 2023.\n\nLDO coin price history and news\n\nThe earliest data on CoinMarketCap showed lido cryptocurrency trading at about $1.8 in early January 2021.\n\nThe token traded range-bound between $0.50 and $3.28 from January to April 2021. LDO saw its first big break in May 2021 as it rose over $5 amid a broader crypto market rally.\n\nAs ETH surged to an all-time high of over $4,800 in November 2021, LDO posted an all-time high of $11.\n\nThe crypto bear market that followed in 2022 saw LDO slump to an all-time low of $0.406 on 18 June. The fall of Terra in the first half of the year affected Lido \u2013 Terra was one of the blockchains that Lido staking supported.\n\nLido soon after announced that it would shut down its Terra operations.\n\nThe biggest driver for the lido cryptocurrency in 2022 was Ethereum\u2019s transition from the proof-of-work to proof-of-stake consensus in a process commonly known as \u2018The Merge\u2019.\n\nIn July 2022, LDO gained about 375%, its biggest monthly gain ever after Ethereum developers confirmed the September 2022 launch date for The Merge.\n\nHowever, LDO price saw losses again as investor sentiment soured following multiple bankruptcies in the crypto industry. LDO closed the year at $0.95 having posted a yearly loss of nearly 75% in 2022.\n\nLDO started 2023 on a strong note by surging over 50% in the first seven days of the year. Tokens of rival staking platforms StakeWise and Rocket Pool saw similar gains during the period.\n\nAnalysts pointed to the upcoming Ethereum upgrade \u2018Shanghai\u2019 which will allow ETH stakers to withdraw their deposits as the major catalyst for LDO and other staking platform tokens.\n\n\u201cAs withdrawals are enabled, many believe more users will stake their ETH,\u201d tweeted CroissantEth.\n\nMost recently liquid staking derivatives have had a nice uptrend.\n\n\n\nThis is thanks to the Shanghai upgrade expected in a few months which will enable withdrawals of staked ETH.\n\n\n\nAs withdrawals are enabled, many believe more users will stake their ETH.\n\n\n\nLDO +26%\n\nRPL +12%\n\nSWISE +66% pic.twitter.com/tl2d3KSlRC \u2014 ????\u200d????.eth (@CroissantEth) January 2, 2023\n\nAs of 9 January 2023, over 30% of all ETH staked was on Lido making it the most dominant ETH staking platform in the world.\n\nRisks of staking on Lido\n\nAccording to Lido, the risks of staking with Lido are as follows:\n\nDistributed custody : Funds staked on Lido are locked in smart contracts. The keys to enable ETH withdrawals are held by 11 individuals.\n\nSmart contracts : There is a risk that smart contracts used for staking on Lido could contain vulnerabilities and bugs which hackers can exploit.\n\nTechnical risk : ETH staking on Lido is dependent on Ethereum\u2019s proof-of-stake chain. There are no guarantees that it has been developed error-free, said Lido.\n\nAdoption risk : The value of ETH and stETH is dependent on the growth and adoption of Ethereum.\n\nDAO key management risk : Lido said over 600,000 ETH is held across multiple multi-signature accounts. If signatories lose their keys or get hacked or go rogue the funds risk becoming locked, said Lido.\n\nSlashing risk : ETH staking comes with a slashing penalty where 1/32 of a validator\u2019s ETH stake is immediately burned if the validator acts against the protocol rules. Validators risk losing their entire staked balance, said ethereum.org. Validator inactivity can also lead to slashing.\n\nstETH price risk: The price of stETH can trade at a lower value than ETH on the market due to withdrawal restrictions.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nIf you are interested in the Lido (LDO) token, you should always conduct your due diligence by reading the latest news, conducting technical and fundamental analysis, and studying a wide range of commentary.\n\nRemember that your decision to trade or invest in any asset should depend on your attitude to risk, your expertise in the market, the spread of your portfolio, and how comfortable you feel about losing money. You should never trade more than you can afford to lose\n\nFAQs"

        "content": "Vitalik Emphasizes Need For Stability Of Ethereum\u2019s Virtual Machine\n\nBy: Samuel Haig \u2022 Loading...\n\nDeFi News\n\nIn a development that may reduce the costs of scaling up Ethereum, momentum is gathering behind a new plan for improving the interoperability between the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and ZK-powered rollups.\n\nThe proposal, dubbed EIP-5988, plans to make changes to the EVM, Ethereum\u2019s core smart contract engine. This would improve interoperability between the virtual machine and ZK-powered rollups and reduce the costs incurred by zero-knowledge scaling solutions.\n\nThe proposal would implement the same hashing function used by the Poseidon hashing algorithm, which is designed to optimize the efficiency of ZK-proof-based systems. The upgrade would also enable greater interoperability between the EVM and a variety of hashing algorithms.\n\n\u201cPoseidon is one of the most efficient hashing algorithms that can be used in this context,\u201d the proposal said. \u201cMoreover, it is compatible with all major proof systems. This makes it a good candidate for a precompile that can be used by many different ZK-Rollups.\u201d\n\nPoseidon is currently used by several of Ethereum\u2019s top Layer 2 scaling teams, including StarkWare, Polygon, and Loopring.\n\nOver the past two years, Layer 2 rollups have emerged as the leading scaling solution for Ethereum. Rollups work by bundling together transactions on Layer 2 and later submitting them in batches for final verification on the Ethereum mainnet, sharing the associated fees between all of the transactions contained within each batch.\n\nOptimistic Rollups\n\nArbitrum and Optimism, two optimistic rollup networks, currently enjoy a dominant share of Ethereum\u2019s Layer 2 total value locked, representing 81% of TVL combined, according to L2Beat. They are also the fourth and fifth largest smart contract networks, ranking behind Ethereum, BNB Chain, and Tron.\n\nCompared to ZK-based solutions, optimistic rollups trade improved EVM-compatibility ability for diminishing scalability. This means that developers can easily port their code from the Ethereum mainnet to optimistic rollups, unlike with rollups built using zero-knowledge proofs.\n\nHowever, once ZK-based networks unlock greater EVM compatibility, they may surpass optimistic rollups due to their improved scalability, faster settlement, and privacy benefits.\n\nEIP-5988\n\nOn Jan. 5, EIP-5988 was presented during an All Core Devs call for the first time. The ACD call is a bi-weekly meeting where leading developers in the Ethereum ecosystem discuss future upgrades for the protocol.\n\nThe proposal was presented by Abdelhmaid Bakhta, an exploration lead at StarkWare and one of EIP-5988\u2019s authors.\n\n\u201cPoseidon is a ZK-friendly hash function,\u201d Bakhta said. \u201cIt makes it very efficient in ZK contexts and it would enable a bunch of interesting use cases.\u201d\n\nBakhta also emphasized the high expense currently associated with ZK-rollups generating storage proofs, attributing the issue to Ethereum\u2019s failure to offer any ZK-friendly hash functions.\n\nDevelopers Urge Caution\n\nHowever, some researchers believe the proposal should be explored with caution, warning against making hasty tweaks to the EVM.\n\nDankrad Feist, an Ethereum Foundation researcher, warned that research into the proposed hashing function is \u201cpremature\u201d and the code could pose unforeseen security risks.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bit early to enshrine any arithmetic hash functions into the EVM because\u2026 of security concerns,\u201d Feist said. \u201cWe just don\u2019t know enough about them yet.\u201d\n\nWhile speaking on another matter during the call, Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum, urged developers to minimize making changes to Ethereum\u2019s EVM where possible, arguing that Ethereum must provide a stable environment for developers.\n\n\u201cYou have applications that are written in EVM code, and if the EVM changes, then those applications can\u2019t change,\u201d Buterin said.\n\nThe lack of interoperability between ZK-rollups and the Ethereum Virtual Machine sparked a race between top L2 teams to launch the first zkEVM in 2022. Polygon, Matter Labs, and Scroll are all working on private testnet deployments of zkEVM-based rollups."

        "content": "Solana (SOL), one of Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) biggest competitors, has more than doubled in price since it collapsed to $8.30.\n\nSOL\u2019s local low of $8.30 marked a nearly 97% drop from its all-time highs, and created uncertainty surrounding the future of Solana.\n\nSolana Labs and the Solana Foundation both had exposure to FTX, and the close ties between the organizations put significant sell pressure on SOL.\n\nAt time of writing, however, SOL is up 103% in less than two weeks, currently changing hands at $16.91. Earlier today, SOL hit $17.37, a 109% gain from $8.30.\n\nThe Solana ecosystem is generally seeing improved sentiment, as its own Dogecoin (DOGE) competitor makes waves through the markets.\n\nBonk Coin (BONK) is a meme coin built for the Solana community to re-energize itself following the collapse of FTX and its subsequent effect on SOL. 50% of the total supply of BONK tokens was airdropped to Solana holders, and at time of writing, BONK has a market cap of $51 million.\n\nBONK launched at a price of $0.000000086142 and exploded to a high of $0.00000439 on Thursday, a massive 4,838% gain that vastly outperformed DOGE and Shiba Inu (SHIB).

        "content": "Toronto embraced digital assets sooner than most and is home to more crypto projects than anywhere else in Canada.\n\nContents\n\nOverview\n\nCrypto culture in Toronto\n\nWhere can I spend crypto in Toronto?\n\nCrypto projects and companies in Toronto\n\nToronto\u2019s crypto controversies\n\nToronto crypto education and community\n\nNotable crypto figures from Toronto\n\nOverview\n\nThe city lies at the center of the so-called Golden Horseshoe, a large urban area around the shore of Lake Erie that 9.76 million people \u2014 about a quarter of all Canadians \u2014 call home. Consistently rated among the world\u2019s most livable cities, Toronto, much like Vancouver on the west coast, is notable for its ethno-cultural diversity brought on by waves of immigration. It\u2019s within a short flight of the capital Ottawa, as well as Montreal to the north and New York to the south. Toronto is seen as the country\u2019s financial and cultural capital.\n\nToronto was where Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin grew up. Source: Pexels\n\nPlaying home to notable battles between indigenous peoples in the late 1600s, French traders from the mid-1700s and the British later that century, Toronto has seen a lot. In 1834, around the time of a failed rebellion against the British, it was incorporated as Toronto, which was a First Nations name, and the city became a destination for slaves escaping the American South. In the late 1800s, the city became a railway hub. Today, it is served by Pearson International Airport.\n\nAs a global hub of business and culture, Toronto resembles a northern version of New York, to the extent that many movies set in New York are filmed in the city due to their similar appearance. Winter weather can be formidable, with freezing rain in 1999 requiring the army to be called in for road clearing. The city is well-known as the birthplace of Ethereum and today hosts a majority of Canada\u2019s blockchain companies.\n\nCrypto culture in Toronto\n\n\u201cVitalik Buterin, an elongated Toronto young man who looked brainy in a very literal way, had attended Anthony\u2019s first meetup and later brought to him an idea for a blockchain platform he called Ethereum.\u201d\n\nSo writes author Ethan Lou in his memoir, Once A Bitcoin Miner, much of which takes place in Toronto. Anthony Di Iorio, an early Bitcoin investor, started a crypto meetup named after his software company Decentral in a \u201credbrick house in Toronto\u2019s historical fashion district\u201d \u2014 this is where the young Buterin walked in with his idea for Ethereum, which is, of course, another story entirely.\n\nWith the founding of Ethereum, Toronto cemented its position in the crypto canon. By 2018, Canadian startup blog BetaKit wrote there was a divide in Canada between the areas that embraced the cultural aspects of crypto on one side, and the financial aspects on the other.\n\n\u201cWhile Toronto and Waterloo are understood to be lively crypto hubs, Vancouver is known for companies that privilege crypto-collectibles over currency, and blockchain art over tokens.\u201d\n\nThis makes sense, considering Toronto is a city oriented primarily toward finance, while Waterloo, the birthplace of BlackBerry, is a tech hub an hour\u2019s drive away. That\u2019s where Buterin attended university briefly and was the home of the author of this article for nearly 20 years.\n\nToronto\u2019s famous Bitcoin sign at Decentral headquarters. Source: Decentral\n\nIn 2014, Decentral opened a physical location on the prominent Spadina Avenue, making it and its large Bitcoin sign something of an institution and a way in which Bitcoin touched the lives of average Torontonians. Featuring a Bitcoin ATM, the spot became almost a Bitcoin embassy in the city, hosting meetups and other events.\n\nAs a financial hub, Toronto regularly plays host to blockchain conferences including the annual Blockchain Futurist Conference, the largest in the country. In 2022, the event coincided with ETH Toronto. The year also saw the Web3 & Blockchain World summit, AIBC Toronto and the Cardano Summit 2022. A quick browse of Meetup.com will reveal that there are dozens of cryptocurrency-, blockchain- and NFT-themed meetups in the city and surrounding area.\n\nSo excited to be in Toronto for The Blockchain Futurist Conference with The #bettertraders_\n\nPodcast. Come say hi \u263a\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/xk6TRLw88Q \u2014 Rune (@cryptorunes__) October 30, 2022\n\nThe corporate nature of the city means there is more funding available than in most other comparable destinations, explains Charlie Aikenhead, senior vice president of marketing at WonderFi. And unlike south of the border in the United States, there is a general sense of regulatory certainty, which encourages a willingness to bet on the industry.\n\n\u201cCanadian investors and citizens seem to have a more favorable view of the industry and have less worries about customer protections than other countries.\u201d\n\nWhere can I spend crypto in Toronto?\n\nAccording to Coinmaps, there are a number of businesses in the city and surrounding areas that happily accept cryptocurrency as payment. In addition to crypto ATMs and various shopping outlets specializing from sportswear to TV antennas, one can have their teeth repaired at Downtown Dental Hygiene Clinic, with the same service available for their homes at B & B Cleaning Service. Down the street from both, Grossman\u2019s Tavern is happy to exchange beer for bits, while Toronto Brewing will sell you all you need to make drinks at home. Even cryotherapy is available at Vital Cryotherapy Toronto.\n\nIt looks like there are plenty of places to spend crypto around Toronto \ud83d\ude09 Or you can search the whole world on Coinmap! pic.twitter.com/678AsIoU4h \u2014 Coinmap (@thecoinmap) March 22, 2021\n\nCoffee can be purchased at the nearby Snakes and Lattes board game cafe a few blocks away, while Urban Living Suites offers a good night\u2019s rest for crypto tourists roaming the streets without loonies or toonies \u2014 what locals call $1 and $2 dollar coins, featuring a loon and two polar bears, respectively. Online services such as those offered by WebRocker Web Design are also available.\n\nWhile crypto acceptance is by no means the norm, it is notable to say that it appears very reasonable that one could go cashless and survive on cryptocurrency for the majority of their needs by seeking out crypto-friendly businesses in the region.\n\nIf one is determined, just about anything can be purchased with crypto in the Toronto region. Source: Coinflip\n\nCrypto projects and companies in Toronto\n\nToronto has the largest concentration of blockchain startups in the country, to the extent that startupill.com published a list titled 82 Best Toronto Cryptocurrency Startups. Among the biggest ones include exchanges Coinsquare, CoinSmart, Tokens.com, Bitbuy, BitSwap, 3Commas, Coinberry and Coinlet among several others. Angel.co also lists 39 \u201cTop Blockchain / Cryptocurrency Startups in Toronto in 2022,\u201d many of which appear to be actively hiring.\n\nOn the mining side, Hut8 Mining is perhaps the most established player, being listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange with a market cap above $400 million. Bitfarms is also listed at a market cap of just under $200 million. DigiMax, Digihost and Cryptoster are also involved in mining.\n\n#HIVE Blockchain Technologies Ltd\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udd38First publicly traded crypto miner, listing on the Toronto Venture Exchange in 2017\n\n\ud83d\udd38HIVE uses 100% green energy to mine $BTC\n\n\ud83d\udd38In 2022, HIVE mined 2,368 BTC & 32,397 $ETH \u2014 RR2Capital (@RR2Capital) November 1, 2022\n\nAndrew Kiguel, CEO of Tokens.com and former CEO of Hut8 Mining, explains that the mix of crypto companies and several large universities is the secret sauce to the city\u2019s industry success, which, he says, has a \u201cyoung and sophisticated crypto population.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are several large universities, and many crypto companies are headquartered here. As a result, there\u2019s a large, active crypto community,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are regular meetups and businesses that have launched in the city. It has a young and sophisticated crypto population.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe crypto environment is generally cooperative and friendly. There is a large talent pool in Toronto seeking employment in crypto. Many crypto companies were launched in Toronto, and others, such as Galaxy Digital and Hive, were financed out of Toronto.\u201d\n\nIn addition to exchanges and mining, Toronto also hosts many financial services and advisory companies specializing in cryptocurrency. These include Signal, a market intelligence firm, Bitcoinblack, which provides crypto-backed credit cards, and payment transfer company Biquiti.\n\nJaxx Wallet, which allows users to easily manage cryptocurrency holdings via smartphone, is also based in Toronto.\n\nLower cooling costs are one positive note for the crypto mining industry in Canada. Source: Pexels\n\nToronto\u2019s crypto controversies\n\nEarlier in 2022, authorities seized a Lambo and $2 million from local 23-year-old \u201cCrypto King\u201d Aiden Pleterski, whose company AP Private Equity Limited was accused of being a $35-million fraud according to court documents. Pleterski was allegedly renting out a lakeside mansion for $45,000 per month even as some locals say they lost money earmarked for their grandchildren\u2019s education.\n\nIn early 2020, a Los Angeles billionaire named Josh Jones became a victim of a so-called SIM-swap attack, according to Ryk Edelstein, founder of 5-L Technologies, in Montreal. The attacker took $45 million in Bitcoin but was eventually tracked down to nearby Hamilton via a PlayStation username and IP address, where authorities found a teenager who later pleaded guilty. A friend, who witnessed the arrest, later recounted the story to local news:\n\n\u201cHe told me, after the SIM swap, that he thought he got only $1 million. But when he looked at the total amount and saw it was $45 million, he panicked.\u201d\n\nThe city has seen a few crypto crimes from investment scams to SIM-swaps. Image: Pexels\n\nToronto also served as part of the stage for the infamous case of QuadrigaCX, whose late founder, Gerald Cotten, lived in the city while running the exchange. He reportedly died in India in 2018, seemingly taking the private keys to nearly $200 million with him to the grave \u2014 which victims have later fought to exhume in a search for answers. In June 2020, the Ontario Securities Commission officially concluded that QuadrigaCX was a fraud and a Ponzi scheme.\n\nToronto crypto education and community\n\nIf you want to be a blockchain dev, at George Brown University\u2019s Casa Loma campus, you can participate in a one-year full-time Blockchain Development Program, which comes with a mandatory on-the-job training element. Tuition is only about $5,000 per year.\n\nToronto Metropolitan University offers a course called \u201cBlockchain for Business,\u201d which promises to \u201chelp fill a knowledge gap for professionals seeking essential knowledge in the ways in which blockchain technology works and how it can be applied effectively to solve business problems.\u201d York University has a dedicated Blockchain Academy and offers a Certificate in Blockchain Development, which is more geared toward building than understanding, through its School of Continuing Studies.\n\nToronto\u2019s chapter of the International Institute of Business Analysis has provided its members with educational seminars on Blockchain Fundamentals, and Intellipaat provides a 27-hour IBM Blockchain Course. BlockGeeks also offers some free online courses.\n\nThere is also CryptoChicks, a nonprofit that has grown from Toronto to encompass chapters around the world \u201chelping thousands of women around the globe to learn and invest in blockchain, build new careers and businesses.\u201d\n\nNotable crypto figures from Toronto\n\nVitalik Buterin (at least sometimes when he visits family, including father Dmitry Buterin), Ethereum co-founder Anthony Di Iorio; Author of Once A Bitcoin Miner and occasional Magazine contributor Ethan Lou; Tokens.com CEO Andrew Kiguel; Cannabanc founder Paresh Khatri; Bitbuy President and CEO Dean Skurka; Kylin Network co-founder Dylan Dewdney; Newton CEO Dustin Walper; CoinSmart CEO Justin Hartzman."

        "title": "Solidity Programming: The Smart Contract language in Ethereum - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "Know more about Solidity programming which is the smart contract language in Ethereum\n\nThe Solidity programming language was created expressly for use on the Ethereum blockchain network. It is a high-level, contract-oriented language with syntax similar to JavaScript, making it reasonably simple to learn for developers who are familiar with web development. Solidity is used to create smart contracts, which are self-executing agreements with terms which put straight into code. These contracts are subsequently deployed on the Ethereum blockchain, where any Ethereum user can invoke and execute them.\n\nAbout Ethereum:\n\nThe most popular Blockchain is Ethereum, mainly to its adaptability in permitting the development of dApps on the platform. Not only that, but the smart contracts feature within Ethereum, which is the platform\u2019s USP, is the icing on the cake. Smart contracts are designed to make it easier to execute essential business logic or rules on the network. Developing a dApp, like any other app, necessitates programming and executing codes on the system.\n\nHowever, Solidity programming stands out as the most popular and widely used programming language on Ethereum. One of Ethereum\u2019s most important features is its support for smart contracts. A smart contract is a contract that self-executes, with the terms of the agreement written directly into code. Smart contracts can be used to help with contract negotiation, verification, and enforcement. This enables the automation of many types of business transactions, such as asset transfers, financial contract execution, and supply chain logistics management.\n\nBenefits of Solidity:\n\nThe ability to construct decentralized apps (dApps) on the Ethereum network is one of the key advantages of using Solidity. dApps are apps that run on a distributed network rather than a centralized server. Because there is no single point of failure in the system, they are more resistant to censorship, outages, and hacker efforts. Furthermore, because they are built on the blockchain, dApps are transparent and auditable, making them perfect for applications involving financial transactions or other sensitive data.\n\nThe ability to create coins on the Ethereum network is another advantage of utilizing Solidity. Tokens are digital assets that can represent anything from a tangible object, such as a commodity or a stock, to a virtual asset, such as a point or a vote. Tokens can be used to build decentralized exchanges (DEXs), which allow users to purchase and sell digital assets with one another directly. They can also be used to form decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), which allow a group of people to make choices and govern a digital asset collectively.\n\nSolidity supports multiple inheritances via C3 linearization, which uses an algorithm to choose which method to employ in the event of multiple inheritances. The \u2018Natural Language Specification\u2019 is used in Solidity programming to translate user-centric specifications to machine-intelligible language.\n\nWhen working with Solidity, keep in mind that, as a relatively new programming language, there is still a lot of uncertainty and risk associated. Because the Ethereum platform and ecosystem are still in development and change often, compatibility issues may arise, resulting in the breach of the contract and the smart contracts that you\u2019ve created. Furthermore, because smart contracts are self-executing, it is critical to thoroughly test and audit the code before publishing it to the blockchain, as flaws in the code can result in funds being lost or other unforeseen effects.\n\nConclusion: Despite these concerns, many developers are enthusiastic about Solidity and the Ethereum platform. We should expect to see a wide range of new and innovative dApps and tokens established on the Ethereum network utilizing Solidity as blockchain technology evolves and more developers learn how to deal with smart contracts. However, like with any new technology, it comes with its own set of dangers and uncertainties, therefore smart contract code should be extensively tested and audited before being deployed to the blockchain.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Polkadot Powered Another Wave of Innovation in Q4 2022, Surpassing Ethereum and Others in Development Activites - CoinCodex",
        "content": "Polkadot (DOT) is undoubtedly one of the biggest projects in the Web 3 scene. The multichain ecosystem continues to drive innovations and developments within the sector, and the final quarter of 2022 was a particularly busy period. A good number of experienced teams, for instance, are building and launching Polkadot parachains that are use-case specific.\n\nBesides the creation of new, innovative Polkadot blockchains (parachains), a lot is happening within the ecosystem. The barrier of entry for native staking has been significantly lowered by nomination pools. This implies that users can now help to secure the network with minimal upfront cost without going through a third party. Some strategic partnerships have emerged as well, even as impressive developer stats round off a series of landmark achievements for Polkadot.\n\nLandmark Moments within Polkadot Network in Q4 2022\n\nWithout further ado, here are some of the landmark moments in the final quarter of 2022 within the Polkadot ecosystem:\n\nNomination Pools Help Drive Growth\n\nNomination pools went live on 1st November 2022 as a new feature of the Polkadot staking system. This feature allows users to pool DOT tokens together (on-chain) in order to nominate validators and receive accompanying rewards. It lowers the minimum stake for individual users from 200 DOT to 1 DOT token.\n\nIn addition to strengthening the decentralization and security of the Polkadot network, Nomination Pools help improve the system\u2019s scalability. It also improves staking opportunities within the network. Of course, it was an instant hit as about 3,475 pool members participated with 854,495 DOT before the end of 2022.\n\nAstar Partners Japan\u2019s Biggest Mobile Phone Operator\n\nAstar, a Polkadot parachain and smart contract platform, closed a major deal with NTT Docomo, which is one of Japan\u2019s biggest mobile phone operators, towards the end of 2022. The two will, henceforth, collaborate on mass Web3 adoption and its social implementation.\n\nIt is expected that the Japanese company will invest about $4 billion in decentralized technology as the two entities work together to sustain developmental goals. Potentially, the partnership will expedite Web3 adoption through the education and nurturing of Web3 talents.\n\nKILT Becomes the First Parachain to Migrate from Kusama to Polkadot\n\nKILT Protocol is officially the first parachain to achieve a full migration from Kusama to Polkadot. This is the first time a live blockchain will migrate from one network to another, and it is a big win for Polkadot. The parachain, which is a blockchain identity protocol, made the move when large-scale enterprises started using its services. It needed top-of-the-class security and stability as the big players arrived.\n\nDOT Morphs from a Security to a Non-Security\n\nOn the regulatory front, Polkadot\u2019s native token, DOT, has metamorphosed from a security to a non-security. This was announced by Web3 Foundation, which funds development teams within the decentralized web space. This is the fruit of a three-year engagement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nWith the latest announcement, Polkadot has strengthened its value proposition to token holders. It now provides safety, even as the token becomes compliant with the law. It is also setting the pace for other tokens as the Foundation has helped achieve SEC\u2019s vision of token morphing. It should be noted, however, that Polkadot has always been vertical agnostic and use-case agnostic, primarily serving as a base layer where developers can build other blockchains and applications.\n\nPolkadot Ecosystem Leads on Development Activities\n\nIn terms of development activities, Polkadot is the ecosystem to beat in the evolving Web3 scene. Data from Electric Capital indicate that there are about 1,128 weekly active developers on the Polkadot ecosystem, and they produce about 13,934 weekly commits, which is higher than what obtains on other Web3 projects, including the all-mighty Ethereum.\n\nA good number of Polkadot affiliates are doing great too. Manta Network, a Web3 privacy hub built on Polkadot and Kusama, which is Polkadot\u2019s canary network, came out third and fifth, respectively, in Electric Capital\u2019s report. Manta also established the largest Trusted Setup in the history of Zero-Knowledge technology, with more than 13,000 participants from 177 countries.\n\nPolkadot is arguably the biggest winner when it comes to use-case specific layer-1 blockchains and apps. 74 parachains won auctions on either Polkadot or Kusama throughout 2022. They currently support as many as 300 unstoppable applications. The final quarter of the year was obviously the busiest period, but Polkadot was booming throughout the year, in terms of developments. About 550 projects, in total, are either launched or in development within the ecosystem."

        "content": "\n\n\n\nAfter a period of little activity and reduced volatility, the crypto market saw a resurgence on Monday as coins with lower market values experienced strong gains, performing better than the more established currencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\n\n\nSeveral smaller crypto saw significant gains in recent trading, including FTT, the token of a failed crypto exchange, which rose 55 percent in the past 24 hours despite being down 96 percent over the past year.\n\nOther notable performers included Serum (SRM), the token of a decentralised exchange built on the Solana blockchain, which rose 28 percent, Zilliqa's native token ZIL, which gained 37 percent, and APT, the token of the Aptos blockchain project, which rose 30 percent.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe unexpected increase in crypto prices caught many traders betting on crypto prices to fall by surprise. In response, traders closed out $245 million worth of short positions within the past 24 hours. This was the largest daily liquidation of short positions since November 10th, when market volatility was caused by the struggles of the crypto exchange FTX.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe recent surge in crypto prices occurred after the largest crypto by market capitalisation, Bitcoin, regained a value of $17,000 after remaining relatively stable for three weeks, which helped to improve overall market sentiment.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis sudden price action was seen as a relief rally for smaller tokens due to the exhausted sellers and limited buying options. Popular crypto analyst Alex Kruger stated on Twitter that this price action was caused by a combination of factors, including year-end sales of alternative coins and derivative traders anticipating such sales. Additionally, shorts, or bets on price decreases, were also squeezed.\n\n\n\n\n\nHistorically, when small-cap tokens and meme coins experience strong gains, it is a sign of an impending downturn in the market, as traders tend to shift their profits from leading digital assets to these smaller projects and then sell them off.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, crypto analyst Alex Kruger believes that the current recovery in crypto prices will continue and that it is similar to the early days of 2019 when the market bottomed out. He also stated that the exceptional performance of alternative coins in comparison to Bitcoin and Ethereum might come to an end soon because of the funding rate normalising.\n\n\n\n\n\nFurthermore, he pointed out that it is still a bear market, so traders should be cautious.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe writer is the founder at yMedia. He ventured into crypto in 2013 and is an ETH maximalist. Twitter: @bhardwajshash"

        "content": "Summary:\n\nThe Korean division plans to operate on its own and separate from Huobi Global, the parent company of the Singapore-based crypto exchange.\n\nLocal media house News1 reported ongoing negotiations for an equity deal between major shareholders.\n\nThe separation comes on the heels of staff cuts and changes to the company\u2019s operational structure.\n\nHuobi Korea is on the verge of separating from its parent entity amid internal restructuring and staff cuts, local media outlet News1 reported on Monday. According to the report, the Korean division of the major crypto exchange plans to operate a standalone business moving forward.\n\nAs part of the process, major stakeholders within the company will negotiate an equity deal. Huobi Global Founder Leon Lin currently who owns roughly 72% of the platform\u2019s Korean subsidiary, will reportedly split ownership between Chairman Jo Guk-Bong and other majority shareholders at the crypto exchange per New1\u2019s report.\n\nLin founded the crypto exchange over a decade ago in 2013. Since then, the platform has grown into an authority in the digital asset trading ecosystem. According to data pulled from CoinMarketCap, the platform ranks among the top 20 cryptocurrency exchanges by daily trading volume.\n\nHuobi Crisis\n\nMonday\u2019s news came amid a raft of developments at the crypto exchange giant. Similar to other virtual currency trading venues like Coinbase and Gemini, Huobi announced staff layoffs of about 20% at the start of January 2023.\n\nIn addition to reducing the team size, Huobi also restructured the payment method for local employees. According to a company email, employees will receive their salaries in Tether\u2019s USDT, the largest stablecoin currency in crypto at press time.\n\nHuobi Advisor Justin Sun Backs Crypto Exchange Amid Massive Withdrawal\n\nIndeed, Tron Founder Justin Sun transferred $100 million in the stablecoin to the platform as users bombarded the crypto exchange with withdrawal requests. Security firm PeckShield reported that Sun moved 50 million USDT and 50 million in Circle USD Coin (USDC) in a bid to restore confidence in the crypto exchange.\n\nSun\u2019s monster asset transfer happened in the middle of rumors that claimed Huobi might be insolvent."

        "content": "Astar Network \u2013 a smart contract innovation hub that connects the Polkadot ecosystem to all Layer 1 blockchains \u2013 launched its Cross-Virtual Machine (XVM) on the public testnet Shibuya.\n\nIt enables projects building on Astar to interact with other smart contract ecosystems, including the WebAssembly (WASM) and Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).\n\nEnter the XVM\n\nAccording to a document seen by CryptoPotato, Astar Network launched the first major product part of its 2023 strategy \u2013 the Cross-Virtual Machine (XVM).\n\nThe feature is a set of interfaces and a custom pallet that allows smart contracts from one virtual machine to engage with others. The XVM can conduct bi-directional calls between WASM and EVM, regardless of the programming languages the virtual machines employ. Speaking on the development was Hoon Kim \u2013 Chief Technology Officer at Astar Network:\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been working hard to create the foundation of the future, regardless of outside influences that are happening now. And today, I am proud to introduce one of our most important features to achieve the Astar Vision; the Cross-Virtual Machine (XVM). It will be the start of the next wave of innovation for dApps. Astar will not only have interoperability through XCM (Cross-chain Messaging) with other parachains but also have interoperability between different smart contract environments.\u201d\n\nThe XVM enables developers to explore numerous contract environments instead of having just one choice. They are also able to build a variety of complex applications that can provide many use cases, such as proving ownership of digital assets.\n\nThe Previous Developments\n\nAstar Network joined forces with the blockchain company Alchemy in August last year to amplify Web3 development on Polkadot\u2019s ecosystem. Astar\u2019s Founder and CEO \u2013 Sota Watanabe \u2013 explained the potential benefits of the partnership:\n\n\u201cSupporting the developer ecosystem is one of Astar\u2019s core values, and our collaboration with Alchemy will help bring even more incentives and innovation to the community. Our collaboration will provide the resources needed to grow the builder community in web3 on Astar, Polkadot, and beyond.\u201d\n\nAstar, which is Polkadot\u2019s leading parachain, inked another collaboration a week later with the DeFi network Acala. The joint initiative aimed to accelerate decentralized finance by introducing new opportunities to developers and rewarding them for their efforts in the Polkadot ecosystem."

        "title": "Most Popular Programming Languages Used in Blockchain Technology - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "Here are the most popular programming languages that are used in blockchain technology\n\nIt is important to understand how crucial is blockchain programming and its underlying applications in this digital world. This article represents a comprehensive manual for blockchain programming that will bring you a wealth of knowledge about blockchain and blockchain programming since knowledge of programming blockchain systems, smart contracts, and more is gradually becoming essential today as blockchain technology is modernizing business processes.\n\nThe fundamentals of Blockchain programming:\n\nBlockchain is a distributed database that allows a network of computers to reach a consensus on the state of its records. It is often associated with the Bitcoin cryptocurrency, but it can be used for other purposes as well. To start with Blockchain programming, firstly you need to learn about distributed systems and cryptography. Some specific topics that you may want to explore include:\n\nPublic key cryptography: This is used to secure transactions on a blockchain. It involves the use of a public key, which is used to encrypt a message, and a private key, which is used to decrypt it.\n\nHash functions: These are used to create a unique \u201cfingerprint\u201d for each block in the chain. This fingerprint is called a \u201chash,\u201d and it is used to verify the integrity of the block and its contents.\n\nConsensus algorithms: These are used to ensure that all of the computers on the network agree on the state of the blockchain. Different algorithms can be used, such as Proof of Work (used by Bitcoin) or Proof of Stake.\n\nSmart contracts: These are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code. The code and the agreements contained therein are stored and replicated on the blockchain network.\n\nBlockchain Programming:\n\nThe optimal programming language to learn for blockchain development depends on a variety of parameters, most of which change depending on the blockchain project. For those who wish to know what language blockchain is written in, the list below can give us a good idea.\n\nThe most popular programming languages for blockchains are Solidity, C++, Go, Phyton, and JavaScript, among others.\n\nAbout Solidity:\n\nThe Ethereum team created Solidity, a domain-specific, object-oriented, high-level language that is similar to javascript. Solidity is a language for building decentralized applications for the Ethereum platform and Ethereum Virtual Machine that was influenced by C++, Python, and JavaScript (EVM). The EVM is the environment in which smart contracts created on the Ethereum platform are run. Inheritance, libraries, and sophisticated user-defined types are all supported by the statically typed language Solidity. It continues to be the DSL that the Ethereum community and blockchain sector have adapted the most.\n\nOther Blockchain Programming languages:\n\nC++: A blockchain is designed to communicate with many untrusted nodes while still offering everyone speedy service. This quick service is essential to a cryptocurrency\u2019s success. You need total control over CPU and memory utilization to meet all these requirements and operate at the greatest level. This is provided to users of C++.\n\nGo: A key feature needed for blockchain projects is the ability to run several programmes or many parts of a programme asynchronously or in parallel. This capacity is provided by Go programming constructs called goroutines.\n\nPython: Python cannot be omitted from this list no matter what you do because practically every blockchain ecosystem contains at least one publicly available utility built in Python. More people than ever are learning Python as a language.\n\nJavaScript: Javascript excels at handling asynchronous actions, which is one of the primary characteristics that makes it ideal for blockchain operations. The connectivity between all of these various blockchain nodes becomes easier for JavaScript to manage as there are more users using blockchain and doing actions simultaneously.\n\nConclusion: You can learn more about the technical facets of blockchain programming and development by taking online courses and tutorials.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "Don\u2019t invest unless prepared to lose all the money you invest. This is a high-risk investment, you shouldn\u2019t expect to be protected if something goes wrong.\n\nJoin Our Telegram channel to stay up to date on breaking news coverage\n\nEthereum (ETH) struggled most of 2022 after nearing the $5,000 price peg in 2021. The foremost smart contract network\u2019s stunted growth was largely due to yead transition from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS) due to technical difficulties. Despite this, Ethereum maintained a strong presence in non-fungible tokens (NFTs), decentralized finance (DeFi), and even the metaverse ecosystems.\n\nWith this year just beginning, Ethereum seems set for a phenomenal 2023. Below, we consider some of the major fundamental strengths of the ETH token, its technical performance, and alternative projects value-facing investors can key into this year.\n\nShanghai Upgrade Scheduled For 2023\n\n2022 was a tough year for the emerging crypto industry, and the Ethereum development team\u2019s forestalled PoS migration compounded an already poor situation for the ETH token. After making a record rally to the north of $5,000, the Ether price slipped alongside Bitcoin following an industry-wide incident and the pressures of global economic issues.\n\nETH slipped to a 52-week low of $1,148, losing over 57% of its previous record value. This year, the Ether token is starting on a strong footing as the digital asset has already clocked a week\u2019s increase of 10% with a 30-day breakout of 4.5% so far. This change in fortune has largely been due to recent developments in the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nAccording to recent reports, the Ethereum network is expected to launch another upgrade to its PoS protocol called Shanghai. This will allow users who have staked their Ether in the last two years to withdraw their funds come March 2023. With staked ETH now unlocked, users can participate in liquidity-providing platforms, thereby increasing their expected turnouts on investment.\n\nThe rapid pace of these new upgrades will also significantly increase investor confidence in the project. Given its previous slow pace in executing network upgrades, the Shanghai launch could speed things up as the foremost smart contract network looks to boost its transaction speed and cut down on exorbitant high gas fees in the coming months.\n\nEther Posts Decent Gain\n\nAt press time, the ETH network token is trading at $1,321, an uptrend of 4.6% in the last 24 hours. Its weekly growth of 10% and a monthly increase of 4.5% show a possible breakout on the horizon. This is further emphasized by a six-month increase of 27.32% and a year-to-date (YTD) of 10.5%.\n\nThese positive results have positively impacted the technicals of the cryptocurrency, which has so far flipped to a \u201cBuy\u201d signal. Its 50-day simple moving average (SMA) price of $1,247 is significantly below its current price action, and the crypto asset\u2019s moving average convergence and divergence (MACD) is trailing on the green trend line, emphasizing a positive market sentiment.\n\nRegarding its relative strength index (RSI), Ether currently holds a 77 figure, putting it in the overbought region. So far, Ethereum is likely on a trail back to the $2,000 price peg but is it the best investment for value-driven investors? Not entirely.\n\nD2T and FGHT Taking the Industry by Storm\n\nThe crypto space has experienced explosive growth despite a significant drop in value. Some of the new entrants have been the D2T and FGHT tokens. Both are currently in their presale stages and are vastly different crypto projects.\n\nD2T is the network token for the Dash 2 Trade blockchain, a data and social analytics project that gives investors detailed information about crypto projects for better investment decisions.\n\n?HEY D2T COMMUNITY? Don't forget \u2013 for the next 2 days you can still buy $D2T tokens in the over-funding round?? \u2705Currently 1 $D2T = 0.0556 USDT. This is the last chance to buy before the listing!https://t.co/ExvBBjKIU6 pic.twitter.com/izAz0ZIYoi \u2014 Dash 2 Trade (@dash2_trade) January 9, 2023\n\nIt provides exchange liquidity levels for all its users to monitor the trading volume of each crypto asset. Besides this, it also incorporates a crypto trading signal, automation, and backtesting functionalities.\n\nDash 2 Trade also affords users the privilege to access newly launched projects in their presale stage before they get listed on crypto exchanges. This way, they can get in on promising projects early enough before they make a market debut.\n\nAnother impressive token is the FGHT, which powers the revolutionary fitness protocol, Fight Out. The project leans towards the Solana-based move-to-earn (M2E) fitness protocol, Stepn but with a twist. It enables users to also take care of their health by participating in challenges in the metaverse space.\n\nGet fit, have fun, and earn rewards with #FightOut! ?

The D2T token has raised over $14.74 million, while the FGHT token has raised $2.79 million. D2T is about rounding up its presale stage, while FGHT is on its way to its second presale stage.\n\nRelated News"
