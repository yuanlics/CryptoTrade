        "title": "Where Will Ethereum Be in 5 Years? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "The latest crypto winter is thawing out as we speak. From crypto-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs) driving institutional investor interest to planned technology upgrades to many of the leading crypto platforms, investors have found many new reasons to pay close attention to this space again.\n\nAs a result, smart-contract leader Ethereum (ETH 0.76%) has enjoyed a 46% price jump from the most recent market trough in October 2023. Archrivals Cardano (CRYPTO: ADA) and Algorand (CRYPTO: ALGO) nearly tripled over the same time span -- and up-and-comer Avalanche (CRYPTO: AVAX) more than tripled.\n\nDoes Ethereum have the right moves to counter these high-stakes gambits from its competitors on the grand chessboard of public opinion and developer interest? Let's see how the next three years might play out for the world's second-largest cryptocurrency.\n\nHow Ethereum echoes Bitcoin's market melody\n\nFirst, let me point out that Ethereum tends to follow the price trends of sector giant Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) in the long run -- sometimes amplified and sometimes muted in comparison to its larger cousin, but almost always moving in the same direction. In other words, the two charts are strongly correlated.\n\nSo when Bitcoin gears up for halving the rewards handed out to its miners, as it does roughly once every four years, that event is expected to drive both cryptocurrencies higher over the following year or so. That trend played out in 2016 and 2020 although Ethereum lagged behind Bitcoin's big gains in the former cycle. So the Bitcoin halving, scheduled for late April 2024, should pour fresh fuel on the fires of most cryptocurrencies -- Ethereum included.\n\nThe journey ahead: Ethereum's planned upgrades\n\nThe halving event should provide a rising tide to lift all encrypted boats, but how will Ethereum tackle the soaring competition? Would investors be better off in speed-focused rivals like Avalanche, Cardano, and Algorand in the long run?\n\nWell, let's see. Ethereum is in the middle of a multiyear platform upgrade, formerly known as Ethereum 2.0 or Eth2. The switch to a proof-of-stake system is already in the books, to be followed by several stepwise technical boosts over the next five to 10 years. The precise order of these updates will vary depending on many external factors, but the process should look something like this, according to the official Ethereum development roadmap:\n\nSharding will split the workload of validating transactions into smaller, more manageable batches. This speed-boosting upgrade is running ahead of schedule, as one early step turned out to be more helpful than expected.\n\nInstead of waiting 15 minutes for validation, the same processing batch could address both the creation and validation of the same transaction. This may be the next step, and a significant upgrade to Ethereum's transaction speed.\n\nSeveral security updates are in the works, aiming to protect the blockchain from different attack types. For example, hardening the blockchain against quantum computing attacks is currently seen as a low priority, but could move up the chain if quantum hardware makes a sudden performance leap. Stay tuned.\n\nCurrently, Ethereum executes every smart contract by referring to externally owned accounts (EOAs). This architecture helps developers pull in real-world data from so-called oracle networks such as Chainlink (CRYPTO: LINK) , resulting in sophisticated contracts tied to stock prices, currency exchange trends, weather patterns, the moon phase, and so on. But it also adds complexity to the smart-contract system, slowing it down and exposing the platform to more bugs. Therefore, the Ethereum community is exploring different ways to replace this approach with a simpler and faster alternative.\n\n, resulting in sophisticated contracts tied to stock prices, currency exchange trends, weather patterns, the moon phase, and so on. But it also adds complexity to the smart-contract system, slowing it down and exposing the platform to more bugs. Therefore, the Ethereum community is exploring different ways to replace this approach with a simpler and faster alternative. Finally, mastermind Vitalik Buterin wants Ethereum to be a stateless system in the long run. This next-level spin on sharding would allow each processing node to manage just a small slice of the blockchain's total data, lowering the costs of participation while increasing processing speeds dramatically. However, this is a true long-term goal requiring dramatic changes to Ethereum's technical platform, and you shouldn't expect it anytime soon.\n\nSo Ethereum is taking steps to match the ultra-fast transaction processing speed of Avalanche and Cardano while also building a more robust and flexible platform for blockchain-based app development. Only time will tell how closely the Ethereum project will stick to its stated long-term plans, but there have been more positive surprises than unexpected snags so far.\n\nEthereum looks ready to rumble\n\nIn my view, the ball is in the court of so-called \"Ethereum killers.\" The leading smart-contract platform looks ready to meet their challenges over the next few years.\n\nOf course, the upstarts aren't sitting on their digital hands. Cardano, Algorand, and Avalanche are also boosting their already fast processing speeds while aiming for greater stability. Any one of them might come up with a game-changing innovation someday.\n\nThe challengers are fighting an uphill battle, though. Ethereum got a head start on the rest of the field, setting industry standards and gathering developer interest several years before the other names even existed. The sheer inertia of an established developer group's existing preferences makes it hard for other platforms to steal Ethereum's smart-contract throne.\n\nBut the presence of several healthy rivals should also drive Ethereum to greater heights in the long run. I can't wait to see how this Gulliver-vs.-Lilliput battle will play out over the years. All four of these cryptocurrencies may have bright futures, but Ethereum has the clearest path to sustained success. The giant isn't even on its knees yet."

        "title": "Decoding Decentralized Finance: The Ethereum Revolution - USA TODAY",
        "content": "Jon Stojan\n\nContributor\n\nFor hundreds of years, the heartbeat of our global financial systems has pulsed to a centralized rhythm. Those in control were generally the same: banks, governments, and other institutions, who wielded their authority over financial transactions. A potential shift is currently in motion as we witness a possible transition toward decentralized finance (DeFi), with the Ethereum platform playing a pivotal role in this transformative process.\n\nAs we experience a rapid technological evolution, blockchain technology stands out as a potential game-changer, catapulting us into a new phase of financial autonomy, decentralized finance, or DeFi. This innovative model leverages blockchain technology to deliver financial services such as lending, trading, and borrowing, eliminating the need for traditional middlemen like banks or brokerage firms.\n\nEthereum is at the epicenter of the DeFi revolution. Built upon open-source blockchain technology, the platform makes creating self-executing smart contracts and Distributed Applications (dApps) possible, etching its pivotal role in this rapidly expanding industry. With most DeFi applications built on Ethereum's blockchain, its role in this expanding sector is indispensable.\n\nWhat sets Ethereum apart is its programmability. While Bitcoin's blockchain is primarily used for monetary transactions, Ethereum allows developers to create smart contracts. These self-executing pieces of code automatically carry out transactions once predetermined conditions are fulfilled. This unique feature enabled many DeFi applications, each replicating traditional financial services in a decentralized format.\n\nFor example, take lending and borrowing platforms like Aave and Compound. Carved from Ethereum's blockchain, these platforms illustrate a new peer-to-peer lending model that sidesteps conventional banking structures. Users can engage with these platforms, offering collateral in the form of Ethereum-based assets to borrow or accrue interest on their deposits, with all transactions managed by automated smart contracts.\n\nDecentralized exchanges (DEXs), such as Uniswap and SushiSwap, are another testament to Ethereum's central role in DeFi. In contrast to traditional exchanges that rely on order books to pair buyers and sellers, DEXs employ an algorithmic model known as Automated Market Makers. Operating on the Ethereum network, they give users total control over their assets, enabling trades directly from their wallets.\n\nEthereum is also the cornerstone for emerging decentralized insurance platforms like Nexus Mutual, which offer protection against digital risks like smart contract failures. Members pool resources to cover claims in these mutual models, with payouts and premiums managed by Ethereum-based smart contracts.\n\nAddressing the bottlenecks of Ethereum's scalability issues and high transaction expenses, commonly known as 'gas fees\u2019, are projected improvements to the Ethereum network, encapsulated in Ethereum 2.0. These enhancements aim to streamline the network, promoting scalability, and minimizing fees, paving the way for a more efficient DeFi ecosystem. Moreover, DeFi is poised to attract greater regulatory scrutiny globally as it gains traction.\n\nAs the financial landscape evolves, Ethereum's innovative platform has played an instrumental role in the rise of decentralized finance, fundamentally transforming the financial landscape. By facilitating unfettered access to financial services and reducing the dependency on intermediaries, Ethereum is driving the momentum toward a new epoch of financial freedom. As Ethereum evolves, its influence on the DeFi sector is set to amplify, steering us toward a truly decentralized financial ecosystem.\n\nThis article is for informational purposes only.

        "content": "Jon Stojan\n\nContributor\n\nDecentralized finance, commonly known as DeFi, is experiencing a boom and setting the stage for a financial revolution. The catalyst? Not Bitcoin, but none other than Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. It's time to delve deeper into the wonders of DeFi and the driving force behind its rapid growth.\n\nAt its core, DeFi is a collection of blockchain-based financial applications that are decentralized, open, and accessible to anyone with an internet connection. Imagine financial services at your fingertips, devoid of banks or other financial intermediaries. Imagine banking the unbanked and transforming the traditional financial landscape. That\u2019s what DeFi promises, and that's why it matters.\n\nNow, let's understand the technology powering these financial applications. These are built on blockchain networks, with Ethereum at the forefront, and rely heavily on smart contracts. These self-executing contracts, with the terms of agreement directly written into code lines, facilitate, verify, or enforce the negotiation or performance of a transaction. This mechanism is what allows DeFi protocols to offer a myriad of financial services, including lending and borrowing, trading, asset management, and insurance, seamlessly and efficiently.\n\nEthereum\u2019s prominence in DeFi is far from accidental. In fact, it\u2019s the linchpin holding the DeFi sector together. Thanks to Ethereum's smart contract functionality, developers can create intricate financial protocols that execute transactions automatically, eliminating intermediaries and fostering transparency. Uniswap, an Ethereum-based decentralized exchange (DEX), lets users trade Ethereum tokens directly from their wallets without the need for an order book or a central exchange. This automated market maker (AMM) system is a game-changer, redefining cryptocurrency trading practices.\n\nConsider Compound, another flagship Ethereum DeFi protocol that allows users to lend and borrow cryptocurrencies. Using an algorithmic interest rate system, it strikes a balance between supply and demand to provide the best possible returns. In this bustling ecosystem, stablecoins also find their place.\n\nUsers reaping the benefits of the Ethereum DeFi ecosystem enjoy a new level of financial freedom. But like any burgeoning technology, it has its share of challenges. Scalability issues, security vulnerabilities, and regulatory uncertainties are among the major hurdles that Ethereum's DeFi ecosystem has to overcome. True, other blockchains are striving to achieve the same goal. Yet, their progress in DeFi lags behind Ethereum.\n\nIt isn't just about being the second-largest cryptocurrency or having a dedicated team and a roadmap for improvements. Ethereum's enduring allure lies in its capability to reach a wider audience and its potential to drive innovation and experimentation in the financial space.\n\nEthereum 2.0, a highly anticipated upgrade, offers a glimmer of hope. It plans to introduce proof-of-stake consensus and sharding, aiming for better scalability and speed. Layer 2 solutions are also on the horizon, promising to boost the network's capacity. Despite the obstacles, the evolution of Ethereum's DeFi ecosystem is a testament to its resilience and adaptability.\n\nCurrently, Ethereum's position as the powerhouse of the DeFi world is unchallenged. The advent of innovation and upgrades could potentially make it the backbone of a new, globally accepted system for transferring value.\n\nThis article is for informational purposes only.

        "title": "Top 6 Ethereum Facts : All You Need To Know - CoinGape",
        "content": "Ethereum stands as a decentralized blockchain platform driven by the Ether token, offering users a versatile range of capabilities. From facilitating transactions to playing games, engaging in cryptocurrency trading, storing nonfungible tokens (NFTs) earning interest through staking, and even participating in social media activities, the platform presents a comprehensive ecosystem.\n\nMany envision Ethereum as the natural progression of the internet. While centralized platforms like Apple\u2019s App Store embody the era of Web 2.0, Ethereum represents the dawn of Web 3.0\u2014a decentralized, community-driven network. This new phase in internet evolution supports decentralized applications (DApps), decentralized finance (DeFi), and decentralized exchanges (DEXs). It\u2019s crucial to note that Ether, not Ethereum, is the designated crypto unit.\n\nNow, let\u2019s unravel some lesser-known facts that add intriguing dimensions to the Ethereum narrative.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Supply Dynamics\n\nUnlike Bitcoin, Ethereum takes a different stance on token supply. With over 120 million its tokens circulating, a stark contrast emerges\u2014over ten times more tokens than Bitcoin. While Bitcoin\u2019s value is influenced by its approaching finite supply of 21 million coins, Ethereum follows a different trajectory, emphasizing abundance over scarcity.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s imminent scarcity pushes its value higher and poses challclassicenges to mining. The philosophy is straightforward: fewer coins available often translate to higher cryptocurrency value. Once a cryptocurrency reaches its maximum supply, mining stops, and market dynamics revolve around supply and demand.\n\nIn contrast, Ethereum doesn\u2019t impose a fixed supply cap. Instead, it employs a mechanism called \u201cminimum viable issuance\u201d to manage Ether\u2019s inflation rate, ensuring network security and motivating validators.\n\nThe platform\u2019s issuance rate undergoes adjustments through Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) and community consensus. Diverging from Bitcoin\u2019s fixed cap, it introduces a flexible approach, allowing for ongoing adjustments to maintain balance within the network. Notably, EIP-1559 introduces a deflationary element by burning a portion of ETH as a base fee, contributing to the evolving economic dynamics of the cryptocurrency.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Dual Narrative\n\nThe Ethereum community faced a seismic event in 2015\u2014the DAO hack, resulting in a substantial loss of $150 million worth of tokens. To salvage Ethereum from the brink of collapse, a consequential decision was made: a hard fork. However, a faction within the community, guided by the principle of \u201cCode is law,\u201d opted to adhere to the original code. This pivotal moment birthed two chains\u2014the forked chain retaining the name Ethereum, and the original chain christened Ethereum Classic, which continues to follow the Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism, preserving the ethos of the original code.\n\nThe Genesis: Birth and Philosophy\n\nEthereum\u2019s beginnings trace back to 2013, involving a collective effort by eight individuals, including the visionary Vitalik Buterin, who crafted the coin (ETH) in Switzerland. With its official launch in 2015, Ethereum\u2019s origin story bears the imprint of Buterin\u2019s dissatisfaction with centralized services\u2014a sentiment molded by his experiences in the world of World of Warcraft. This critical perspective formed the philosophical foundation of Ethereum, steering its path toward decentralization.\n\nIt\u2019s crucial to avoid confusion between Ethereum and Ether. Ether, the native token, serves as a virtual coin within the Ethereum network, much like other digital currencies. Beyond being a tradable asset, Ether plays various roles\u2014it is used for transactions, runs applications within the Ethereum network, and serves as a means to monetize activities conducted on the platform.\n\nEthereum\u2019s move towards Proof-of-Stake\n\nIn the early days, both Bitcoin and Ethereum relied on a process called \u201cProof-of-Work\u201d (PoW), where individuals could mine new tokens by validating blockchain transactions on their personal computers. However, in September 2022, Ethereum (ETH) underwent a significant transformation, moving away from PoW to embrace Proof-of-Stake.\n\nUnder PoS, new coins are created when crypto owners \u201cstake\u201d their own coins, essentially locking them up to participate in transaction verification and, consequently, earn rewards. While this method was already employed by Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA), Ether swiftly ascended to become the leading cryptocurrency in terms of staked value.\n\nThe primary motivation behind this shift lies in energy efficiency. The energy consumption associated with Ethereum transactions was staggering, equating to over 100,000 VISA transactions in December 2021. However, post the Ethereum Merge, the energy footprint notably decreased. Observers believe that this change not only influences public perceptions of cryptocurrencies but also holds implications for the future development of popular decentralized finance (DeFi) categories within Ethereum, such as crypto lending.\n\nExploring Alternatives to \u201cProof-of-Work\u201d\n\nEthereum encountered a pivotal moment known as the \u201cSplit,\u201d sparking a quest for alternatives to the traditional \u201cProof-of-Work\u201d (PoW) model. As some enthusiasts applaud the reduction in energy costs, not all its formerminers welcomed the Merge, a transition away from the PoW model.\n\nIn September 2022, a revealing graphic displayed a substantial dump of Ethereum (ETH) by miners holding blockchain addresses linked to their mining activities. Expecting a price surge post-Merge, these miners were disappointed, leading to the selling of their ETH holdings.\n\nThe blockchain witnessed a surge in transaction counts, reaching approximately 1.1 million per day in September 2022. This uptick in activity coincided with the aftermath of the Merge and the subsequent dissatisfaction among miners. The dissatisfaction prompted a significant number of miners to part ways, seeking alternative cryptocurrencies for their mining endeavors.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Crowdfunding\n\nEthereum\u2019s inception traces back to a community-driven initiative, spearheaded by its creator, Vitalik Buterin. In 2013, Buterin conceived the idea of decentralized blockchain platform, inspired by a sense of dissatisfaction with the limitations he observed in Bitcoin. His vision extended beyond the constraints of existing blockchain technology, aiming to create a platform capable of supporting intricate and diverse applications.\n\nIn 2014, he initiated a community-backed fundraising effort, selling the initial batch of Ethereum tokens known as Ether (ETH) to the public. This crowdfunding campaign marked a significant milestone, surpassing expectations and raising over $18 million in just 42 days. Notably, this successful endeavour propelled the blockchain into the ranks of the first and largest crowdfunded projects in history.\n\nEthereum\u2019s journey began not only as a technological innovation but as a testament to the power of community support, illustrating how collaborative efforts can pave the way for ground breaking projects in the ever-evolving landscape of blockchain technology.\n\nBonus: Ethereum\u2019s Growing Influence in Tech Boardrooms\n\nBeyond the realm of developers and investors, Ethereum has captured the attention of major corporations. Giants like Microsoft, J.P. Morgan, Intel, and Amazon are exploring itspotential solutions. Enterprise software companies, including IBM and Deloitte, are testing the platform\u2019s networks, signaling a broader acceptance of blockchain technology in corporate landscapes.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn the dynamic landscape of blockchain, Ethereum stands as a pioneer, symbolizing innovation, adaptability, and community-driven progress. Beyond its decentralized framework, the popular platform embodies the essence of Web 3.0, ushering in a new era of user empowerment. From token dynamics to the Proof-of-Stake transition and corporate intrigue, Ethereum\u2019s journey reflects a dynamic intersection of technological evolution and philosophical principles. As it charts the course for decentralized possibilities, it serves as a testament to collective spirit in advancing blockchain technology."

        "content": "History was made on Saturday when the first ever loan against a domain name was executed with a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain. The significance is that the success marks the birth of a new asset class that can be leveraged to unlock capital for business owners or domain name investors in an expeditious and secure manner.\n\ndeBanked founder Sean Murray was the executor of the transaction. The process involved tokenizing a domain name (domainfi.net) into an NFT and then offering that NFT as collateral on an NFT loan marketplace. When a loan was executed on the platform with a smart contract, the domain name was automatically placed into an ethereum address to be held as escrow. If the borrower were to default on the loan, the smart contract would automatically release the domain name to the lender, who would now have full control of it.\n\nThe process involved two parties, the tokenizing registrar and the NFT loan marketplace. The loan, which was consummated for proof of concept, carried a 10% APY and a 7-day term. It took less than 20 minutes combined to complete the tokenization and loan execution process.\n\n\u201cI was guessing that this capability might still be another year away and I had not even dreamed that I would be the very first one to execute this type of loan,\u201d said Murray. \u201cFollowing this space closely probably contributed to that stroke of luck. There is still time until this is ready to be a consumer-facing product in the marketplace, but the tech already exists and transactions of this nature are already viable. It will be fascinating to watch.\u201d\n\nAbout deBanked\n\ndeBanked was launched in 2010.

One common criticism of the PoA method, however, is that a lot of trust must be placed in a smaller number of validators\u2014so it\u2019s less decentralized than other methods.\n\nIn March 2022, the Ronin\u2019s bridge experienced a massive $622 million hack. The bridge connects Ronin to Ethereum. The U.S. Treasury blamed North Korean hackers for the attack\u2014and some of the lost funds were eventually recovered. Affected users were fully refunded by the Ronin network and developer Sky Mavis in June 2022.\n\nIn April 2023, the Ronin blockchain switched to the delegated proof-of-stake mechanism (DPoS), meaning that it no longer operates as a PoA blockchain. DPoS allows for more decentralization, as now any Ronin (RON) token holder with at least 250,000 RON staked on its blockchain can \u201cdelegate\u201d or select validators for the network.\n\nWhat is RON?\n\nThe Ronin token, also known as RON, is the gas token for the Ronin blockchain. Ronin network users need a bit of RON to pay for transactions on the blockchain. RON can also be staked to participate in the blockchain\u2019s aforementioned DPoS mechanism, or can be staked for other decentralized finance (DeFi) purposes.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhat is the Ronin Wallet?\n\nSky Mavis\u2019 Ronin Wallet is a crypto wallet for the Ronin blockchain ecosystem that exists as both a web browser extension and a mobile app for iOS and Android devices.\n\nIn early 2024, the mobile wallet\u2019s developers announced new features in an effort to expand its capabilities, adding support for other blockchains like Ethereum sidechain Polygon and the EVM-compatible BNB Chain. It\u2019s also added Binance Pay as a feature, which allows users to buy some of the Ronin ecosystem's tokens.\n\nWhat is Sky Mavis?\n\nSky Mavis is a crypto tech startup founded in 2018 that created both the Ronin blockchain and its flagship game, Axie Infinity. Sky Mavis has five co-founders: Trung Nguyen, Aleksander Larsen, Jeffrey Zirlin, Viet Anh Ho Sy, and Tu Doan.\n\nAccording to Tracxn data, Sky Mavis has 26 institutional investors, with Animoca Brands and Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) among them. Sky Mavis has raised $311 million in funding at time of writing, per Tracxn, with its latest round a Series B that raised $150 million in April 2022. That round was raised to help refund Ronin users after the aforementioned hack.\n\nHow does Axie Infinity fit into Ronin?\n\nAxie Infinity is a Pok\u00e9mon-inspired play-to-earn game where players can fight each other in battles where they must pit axolotl-inspired creatures called \u201cAxies\u201d against each other. Every Axie is an NFT that can be bought and sold. Thanks to a recent update, some Axies can now be upgraded, too.\n\nWhich tokens are on Ronin?\n\nThe Ronin blockchain\u2019s best-known tokens so far are RON, AXS, and SLP. AXS is Axie Infinity\u2019s governance token. SLP, also known as Smooth Love Potion, is Axie Infinity\u2019s main in-game currency and play-to-earn reward token.\n\nIn early 2024, Sky Mavis announced that SLP would be getting a rework including a capped token supply and a \u201cstability fund\u201d that will automatically buy SLP at specified times in an effort to keep the token\u2019s price within certain target points. SLP can be earned in Axie Infinity by winning matches.\n\nPixels is also set to launch its own PIXEL token soon on Ronin, while other games are likely to debut tokens in the future as they expand and hold airdrop campaigns.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhich games are on Ronin?\n\nWhile Ronin\u2019s most well-known game is Axie Infinity (which consists of Origins, Raylights, and Homeland games), there\u2019s also games like Axie Classic, Project T prototype, and Defenders of Lunacian Land.\n\nBeyond the Axie IP, Sky Mavis has begun to bring external game developers onto the Ronin blockchain, adding Pixels, Zoids Wild Arena, The Machines Arena, Tribesters: Island of Solas, and Civitas, to name a few.\n\nPixels has been credited with helping to renew interest around the Ronin chain after migrating from Polygon in late 2023 and kicking off a play-to-airdrop campaign that concluded in January 2024. The game has driven a dramatic rise in active users on Ronin, arguably benefitting other games on the platform and driving refreshed enthusiasm around its prospects.\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward\n\nEditor's note: This story was updated after publication to note additional Sky Mavis co-founders and to clarify that Ronin users affected by the bridge hack were fully refunded."

        "content": "Ethereum options trading volume has rallied to an all-time high in January.\n\nThe coin has seen a decline in open interest in its futures market.\n\nWith $17.9 billion recorded so far this month, Ethereum [ETH] options trading volume has skyrocketed to an all-time high, according to The Block Data dashboard.\n\nThis represents a 2% uptick from the $17.7 billion recorded in trading volume in the coin\u2019s options market in December.\n\nAn assessment of the coin\u2019s put-call ratio showed that a significant amount of the 932,000 Ether options contracts that expired on the 26th of January were bets in favor of a price rally.\n\nIn a recent post on X (formerly Twitter), GreeksLive noted that Ethereum options open interest had a put-call ratio of 0.31 prior to the expiry of the options contracts.\n\nAn asset\u2019s put-call ratio measures market sentiment regarding that asset. It does this by dividing the number of outstanding put options (bets on the price falling) by the number of outstanding call options (bets on the price rising).\n\nWith a put-call ratio of 0.31, it means that for every 100 ETH call options purchased, only 31 put options were bought. This showed that participants in ETH\u2019s derivatives market expected its price to rise or at least hold steady near expiration.\n\nJan. 26 Options Data\n\n94,000 BTC options are about to expire with a Put Call Ratio of 0.51, a Maxpain point of $41,000 and a notional value of $3.75 billion.\n\n932,000 ETH options are about to expire with a Put Call Ratio of 0.31, Maxpain point of $2,300 and notional value of $2.07\u2026 pic.twitter.com/EifV6kgUBz \u2014 Greeks.live (@GreeksLive) January 26, 2024\n\nETH\u2019s futures market\n\nIn the coin\u2019s futures market, the approach adopted by traders differs. AMBCrypto found that ETH\u2019s futures open interest has declined 11% since the 17th of January. It fell from $8.7 billion to $7 billion at press time, according to data from Coinglass.\n\nWhen an asset\u2019s open interest drops in this manner, it suggests that fewer new futures contracts are being opened due to declining price volatility, waning positive sentiment, or traders simply closing existing positions without opening new ones.\n\nAn assessment of some volatility markers confirmed the decline in price swings since the middle of the month.\n\nFor example, ETH\u2019s Average True Range (ATR) \u2013 which measures market volatility by calculating the average range between high and low prices over a specified number of periods \u2013 was spotted at 100.50 at press time. It has dropped by 15% since the 13th of January.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nWhen ATR witnesses a decline, it suggests that the price swings are becoming less significant. In a similar trend, the coin\u2019s Chaikin Volatility has declined by 160% within the same period.\n\nThis indicator also measures price volatility by tracking the difference between an asset\u2019s high and low prices over a specified period. When it declines, volatility is low."

        "title": "Ethereum Faces Market Tremors As Celsius Offloads $1 Billion in ETH - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) is about witnessing a potential sell-off worth $1 billion. This significant transaction is rooted in actions by Celsius, a bankrupt crypto lender. Reports from on-chain analyst Lookonchain indicate that Celsius initiated the transfer of 459,561 ETH, estimated to be worth around $1.014 billion, to various exchanges.\n\nThe breakdown of this large-scale distribution includes 297,454 ETH ($656.5 million) moved to Coinbase Prime, 146,507 ETH to Paxos Treasury, and smaller sums totaling 7,800 ETH ($17.2 million) sent to FalconX and Coinbase, respectively. Despite this transfer, Lookonchain disclosed that Celsius still maintains a reserve of 62,468 ETH, valued at roughly $139 million.\n\nThis significant transfer carries significant weight in the Ethereum market. It poses a challenge as it exerts considerable pressure on Ethereum\u2019s price, with potential implications for broader market sentiment. Ethereum could see a significant plunge if the $1.014 billion worth of ETH is sold simultaneously.\n\nCelsius\u2019 Previous Ethereum Transactions\n\nCelsius\u2019 latest Ethereum transactions aren\u2019t isolated events. LookonChain has previously spotted significant transfers linked to Celsius, including a deposit of 13,000 ETH ($30 million) on Coinbase and 2,200 ETH ($5 million) to FalconX.\n\nWhile these moves indicate Celsius\u2019 proactive strategy in managing its financial challenges, they also signal potential volatility for Ethereum\u2019s market value.\n\nFurthermore, Arkham Intelligence reports that between January 8 and January 12, Celsius liquidated over $125 million worth of Ethereum. The primary objective of these sales is to fulfill obligations to creditors.\n\nDune Analytics also highlighted the pattern of large-scale Ethereum redemptions, noting redemptions exceeding $1.6 billion. Since last year\u2019s Shanghai update, this figure represents the highest Ethereum redemptions recorded.\n\nAs part of its bankruptcy proceedings, Celsius continues liquidating Ethereum holdings to pay off debts.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Market Reaction\n\nIn the aftermath of Celsius\u2019s Ethereum transactions, the asset has seen a nearly 10% decline in value over the past week, dropping from a high above $2,600 to around $2,186 yesterday. However, Ethereum has slightly recovered, rising by 2.2% in the past 24 hours, with a trading price of $2,258 at the time of writing.\n\nAmid these market developments, Michael van de Poppe, a renowned crypto analyst, has identified three key factors that could signal a bullish phase for ETH. A significant element is Bitcoin\u2019s market behavior, often setting the tone for altcoins.\n\nVan de Poppe notes that Bitcoin\u2019s indications of bottoming out usually precede rallies in altcoins, suggesting a potential upturn for Ethereum. He also emphasizes the increasing excitement around spot Ethereum ETFs, which could catalyze Ethereum\u2019s market value in the coming weeks.\n\nAdditionally, Ethereum\u2019s impending network upgrades, which aim to reduce transaction costs significantly, are expected to enhance the network\u2019s efficiency and scalability, potentially boosting its market appeal.\n\nThe momentum towards $ETH is probably going to come in the next few weeks.

        "content": "Ripple and Ethereum are two of the most popular digital assets in the crypto market. Despite both cryptocurrencies promising to reinvent finance across the globe, ETH and XRP tackle this monumental task from completely different angles.\n\nWhile David Schwartz, Brad Garlinghouse, and the team at Ripple Labs want to facilitate simpler transactions globally, Vitalik Buterin and the wider Ethereum community are reimagining what\u2019s possible on the internet.\n\nIn this article, we\u2019ll pit two of the blockchain industry\u2019s brightest stars against each other to see who comes out on top.\n\nRipple vs. Ethereum: At a Glance\n\nBefore plunging into the nuts and bolts of these protocols, it\u2019s important to understand what Ripple and Ethereum do and why these ecosystems carry so much gravity in the crypto space.\n\nWhat Is Ripple (XRP)?\n\nOriginally designed by Jed McCaleb as the ultimate Bitcoin (BTC) alternative, Ripple is a cross-border payment protocol that aims to streamline international financial transactions.\n\nWith a focus on central banks and other high-powered financial institutions, Ripple Labs envisions a world where lengthy and expensive international payments are executed in seconds, liberating the flow of money worldwide.\n\nThe Ripple Labs team has wasted no time building a powerful network of strategic partnerships. Dozens of banks and financial institutions, including Santander and the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, have joined the RippleNet. With XRP\u2019s legal dramas mostly behind it, Ripple\u2019s expansive partnerships are expected to grow.\n\nStrengths\n\nAffordable \u2013 A transaction on the XRP Ledger costs an average of $0.0002, making the network more affordable than existing cross-border payment platforms.\n\n\u2013 A transaction on the XRP Ledger costs an average of $0.0002, making the network more affordable than existing cross-border payment platforms. Fast \u2013 While current international payment solutions, like SWIFT, can take days to clear, XRPL payments are settled in as little as 3 seconds.\n\n\u2013 While current international payment solutions, like SWIFT, can take days to clear, XRPL payments are settled in as little as 3 seconds. Sustainable \u2013 XRPL transactions are roughly 61,000 times more energy efficient than proof-of-work blockchains like Bitcoin.\n\nWhat Is Ethereum (ETH)?\n\nEthereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization and is responsible for pioneering many of blockchain technology\u2019s greatest innovations.\n\nA fully decentralized, smart contract-capable network, Ethereum reimagined what we knew possible on the internet, giving us remarkable new use cases like decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\n\nToday, Ethereum boasts the greatest diversity of on-chain technologies and applications seen in the space. Vitalik Buterin\u2019s network has given millions of people worldwide greater control over their funds, eliminating the need for costly intermediaries in dozens of industries and sectors.\n\nStrengths\n\nThe Original Layer One \u2013 Ethereum was the first blockchain to support smart contract development, allowing for a virtually endless range of potential use cases.\n\n\u2013 Ethereum was the first blockchain to support smart contract development, allowing for a virtually endless range of potential use cases. Immense TVL and Activity \u2013 Ethereum boasts greater TVL (Total Value Locked) and activity than all other blockchains, implying that it\u2019s the most commonly used and trusted network in crypto.\n\n\u2013 Ethereum boasts greater TVL (Total Value Locked) and activity than all other blockchains, implying that it\u2019s the most commonly used and trusted network in crypto. Central Hub of Crypto Innovation \u2013 Ethereum offers developers greater flexibility and composability than any other chain, making it the first choice for developers and entrepreneurs looking to test revolutionary new ideas.\n\nKey Differences Between Ripple and Ethereum\n\nAs I\u2019m sure you can understand by now, Ripple and Ethereum are fundamentally different on many levels, and each blockchain is better suited to different tasks. What are the main differences to consider when comparing the two blockchains?\n\nUse Cases\n\nRipple, XRP, and the XRP Ledger are primarily used to transfer funds efficiently across borders. That\u2019s not to say there isn\u2019t some semblance of DeFi activity on the network, but the blockchain\u2019s main focus is to provide services to financial institutions globally.\n\nOn the other hand, Ethereum offers a far more diverse range of utilities. While early activity on the network was centered around decentralized finance, Ethereum developers have spread their wings to provide blockchain-based applications in everything from supply chain management and healthcare to legal services and gaming.\n\nScalability\n\nThe XRP Ledger was designed to eclipse Bitcoin\u2019s limitations and provide an unrivaled payment system. With blazing-fast transaction speeds, high transaction throughput, and low fees, the XPRL can support vast amounts of users without breaking a sweat or breaking the bank.\n\nIn this respect, Ethereum falls short. The network has long suffered from astronomical gas fees, with a simple trade, digital currency transfer, or NFT mint costing upwards of $50. Ethereum is also much slower than Ripple, managing only around 15 transactions per second\n\nHowever, all is not lost for Ethereum. The network supports dozens of layer 2 scaling solutions that help shoulder some of the burden, providing Ethereum\u2019s unmatched developer experience on far more scalable platforms.\n\nOn top of that, Vitalik Buterin and the Ethereum community are constantly working to improve the network. Plans are underway to alleviate Ethereum\u2019s issues and help it compete with more modern and performant Layer Ones.\n\nVision\n\nAs mentioned earlier, Ripple\u2019s primary focus is on delivering solutions for some of the world\u2019s largest financial institutions. While most cryptocurrency industry aims to give power and control back to the individual, Ripple is more interested in sticking with the big players.\n\nBeyond that, Ripple faces some centralization issues. While claiming to be fully decentralized, the XRP Ledger is largely operated by Ripple Labs, a private company.\n\nAs if that wasn\u2019t enough, Ripple Labs holds over 50B XRP tokens in its escrow vaults.\n\nI'm still not sure the escrow was such a good idea. I initially oposed it. Later weakly supported it. And today, I'm right on the fence. \u2014 David \"JoelKatz\" Schwartz (@JoelKatz) January 8, 2024\n\nThis staggering figure makes up more than half of XRP\u2019s total supply, a concept that even Ripple CTO David Schwartz has difficulty supporting.\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum\u2019s development and future are firmly held in the hands of its community. On-chain votes manage the protocol\u2019s governance, and anyone can submit new proposals that might dictate the blockchain\u2019s path forward.\n\nLike Bitcoin itself, Ethereum champions the original ethos of blockchain technology. The network aims to give everyone on earth greater control of their assets and provide a secure, anonymous, and permissionless platform for all.\n\nLooking to the Future\n\nHaving shaken the legal monkey off its back, Ripple can finally look ahead unburdened. At the same time, Ethereum\u2019s network effect is growing larger daily, supported by a comprehensive roadmap expected to resolve its issues. What does the future hold for these iconic cryptocurrencies?\n\nWhat\u2019s Next for Ripple?\n\nWhile Ripple Labs\u2019 legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchanges Commission is far from over, Judge Analisa Torres\u2019 declaration that XRP is not a security has been a great boon for the XRP community.\n\nWith that out of the way, Ripple Labs can focus more on expanding the RippleNet work towards more partnerships with large financial institutions.\n\nRumors have been circulating about a potential Ripple IPO. However, Ripple Labs CEO Brad Garlinghouse has denied these claims, suggesting that Ripple is \u2018not in any hurry\u2019 to go public.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next for Ethereum?\n\nFollowing a successful transition to becoming a more energy-efficient, Proof-of-Stake blockchain in 2022, the next steps of Ethereum\u2019s roadmap are dedicated to scaling the network.\n\nCo-founder Vitalik Buterin has updated the Ethereum roadmap, painting a picture of what to expect in 2024 (ignoring the typo in his post). The plan ahead follows the 6-step path to newfound scalability, separated into comically named sections.\n\nBy popular demand, an updated roadmap diagram for 2023! pic.twitter.com/oxo58A2KuG \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) December 30, 2023\n\nWhile it is unlikely that all this will be achieved in 2024 alone, the Ethereum community is largely happy with the proposal, which aims to bring Ethereum to greater heights.\n\nFinal Verdict\n\nComparisons between crypto projects are not always a great measure of their value. The reality is that it\u2019s hard to compare the perks and potential of two fundamentally different protocols with contrasting values and use cases.\n\nOn paper, Ripple is a far more efficient and scalable payment processor. However, Ethereum\u2019s adaptability and scope are far wider, allowing for a more diverse range of utilities and adoption channels.\n\nUltimately, the question shouldn\u2019t be as simple as \u2018Which is better?\u2019. The question is which blockchain is better suited to your individual needs.\n\nRipple is undoubtedly the better option if you want to transfer funds quickly at a low cost. For everything else, Ethereum offers a much more diverse range of tools and services that Ripple and the XRP Ledger cannot match.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nModern blockchains offer the best of both worlds. Newer, more performant blockchains like Solana can have faster transaction speeds and lower gas fees than the XRP Ledger while maintaining Ethereum-equivalent levels of smart contract composability.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nRipple and Ethereum are two of the most important digital assets in the crypto market. It\u2019s essential to understand what both networks are capable of before making any investment decisions.\n\nFAQs"

        "title": "Should You Buy Ethereum While It's Below $2,500? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "After tanking 68% in 2022, Ethereum (ETH 0.76%) experienced a resurgence last year, as the digital asset soared 91% in 2023. This was on the back of renewed optimism in the crypto industry.\n\nHowever, Ethereum remains 49% off its all-time high. And the current dip might be a rare opportunity.\n\nShould investors buy this leading cryptocurrency while it's still below $2,500? Let's look at both the bull and bear cases for Ethereum, so that investors can make an informed decision.\n\nWhat the bulls are saying\n\nEthereum was the first cryptocurrency that incorporated functionality for smart contracts. And this means that it had greater potential to introduce various use cases.\n\nThis includes decentralized applications, in verticals including gaming, social, governance, and even art. But one area that has huge potential is decentralized finance (DeFi). According to coinmarketcap.com, Ethereum has 71% of the $105 billion of total value locked in the entire cryptocurrency industry. This metric measures how much capital is staked or locked up in DeFi applications, indicating Ethereum's dominance.\n\nIn September 2022, Ethereum's network transitioned to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. Supporters had long waited for this upgrade, called The Merge, to make the cryptocurrency better capable of scaling up. This also reduced its energy usage by 99.95%. Furthermore, the hope is that Ethereum can process more transactions at lower costs. And this should continue to make this blockchain network a hotbed when it comes to developer activity.\n\nAnother reason why Ethereum might be on your investing radar has to do with the potential for spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to hit the market. The Securities and Exchange Commission approved Bitcoin spot ETFs recently, and there's optimism this could happen with Ethereum as well. So far, BlackRock and Ark Invest, among other asset managers, have filed applications. This could bring in massive amounts of institutional capital to Ethereum, which could support a higher price over time.\n\nThe bears have compelling arguments\n\nThe entire premise of cryptocurrencies is to take power away from central authorities and give it to the community. The goal is to create decentralized networks where individuals are in control. The issue with Ethereum, though, is that it's still controlled by a small group of people. Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum, has an outsize influence on the direction of the crypto. Some might view this as a huge risk because he can take actions that are more favorable to himself.\n\nBesides The Merge, Ethereum's leaders have a comprehensive roadmap that includes numerous other upgrades to the network, called the Surge, Verge, Purge, and Splurge. While this is encouraging, because it shows how well thought out Ethereum's development pipeline is, it adds tremendous technical risk. Anytime software is changed, a lot can go wrong, thus opening up Ethereum to software bugs that could make it easier for hackers to attack the network and steal people's private keys.\n\nInvestors also can't ignore regulatory concerns. SEC chair Gary Gensler has come out and said before that he views Bitcoin as a commodity, while all other cryptocurrencies are likely securities. This means Ethereum could face a more stringent regulatory framework going forward, which could discourage capital and talent from migrating to it.\n\nShould you buy Ethereum? It depends.\n\n\n\nBoth the bull and bear cases hold a lot of weight. Investors should consider the facts and come to their own conclusion about what to do with this cryptocurrency as it relates to their portfolio composition. Everyone has a different perspective.\n\nIf you're willing to take the risk, accept the uncertainty, and understand that there will be lots of volatility, then initiating a tiny position in Ethereum while it's still below $2,500 might make sense. Of course, it's critical to maintain a long-term mindset of at least five to 10 years if you go this route."

        "content": "Crypto analyst Benjamin Cowen says that he\u2019s expecting Ethereum (ETH) to correct sharply to below the $1,000 level.\n\nIn a new strategy session, Cowen tells his 790,000 YouTube subscribers that historically, ETH often \u201ctests the integrity\u201d of its major cycle lows at least twice before moving into a new bull phase.\n\nThe analyst points out the retests of cycle lows in 2015, 2016 and 2020 and says that another low in 2022 has yet to be retested.\n\nCowen forecasts that Ethereum first breaks down in its Bitcoin pair (ETH/BTC) before ETH/USD follows suit, likely this year.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m suggesting is that sometime in the next few months, ETH/BTC breaks down. After ETH/BTC breaks down, ETH/USD breaks down.\n\nOne of the things about ETH/USD that you might notice is that it doesn\u2019t tend to just put in a low and then never test the integrity of that low. Look at all the prior examples\u2026\n\nSo at some point, I think Ethereum will test the integrity of that low, back down below $1,000. But, history would also suggest that it won\u2019t test it until after ETH/BTC breaks down. And history also suggests that ETH/BTC probably won\u2019t break down in January because normally January is a good month for Ethereum.\n\nIt could still take some time given these narratives that are floating around, given the spot ETF for ETH, given the halving narratives, it could take some time for that to play out.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $2,268.\n\n\n\n\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "title": "Key Levels to Watch As Ethereum Price Sparks New Recovery at $2200 - CoinGape",
        "content": "The Ethereum (ETH) price has recently experienced an uptick in demand, particularly noticeable around the $2200 level. This change is highlighted by distinct long-tail rejection candles observed on its daily chart, indicating a decrease in bearish momentum. This shift comes in tandem with the Bitcoin price stabilization above $40000, alongside a broader uptick in altcoin markets, sparking a new relief rally.\n\nOver the past three days, the Ethereum price has seen a nearly 4% increase, now trading around the $2280 mark. Given this renewed buying pressure, can Ethereum leverage this momentum to surpass the $2500 threshold once again?\n\nadvertisement\n\nBear Trap Reboots Recovery Sentiment in ETH\n\nThe Ethereum Fear and Greed Index at 48% reflects a neutral sentiment among traders.\n\nThe $2200 support backed by several technical levels creates a stoned support region.\n\nThe intraday trading volume in Ether is $6.3 Billion, indicating a 10.3% gain.\n\nOver the recent fortnight, the Ethereum price experienced a pronounced correction, with its value plunging from $2714 to a low of $2168, marking a significant 20% decrease. During this pullback, the coin price broke below the channel pattern\u2019s support trendline, which underpinned a recovery rally for nearly three months.\n\nHowever, as the broader market\u2019s bearish momentum began to fade, the ETH price demonstrated resilience around the $2200 mark, successfully reclaiming the previously breached support trendline. This reversal marked the prior downfall as a \u2018Bear Trap,\u2019 and triggered additional buying orders in the market, evidenced by considerable short liquidation.\n\nCurrently trading at $2280, if Ethereum can maintain its position above this reclaimed support, it could initiate a 6.85% relief rally, aiming for the $2430 level. This immediate resistance aligns with the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the recent correction, highlighting a pivotal barrier that sellers are likely to defend vigorously.\n\nTherefore, for Ether to continue its upward trajectory and potentially retest the $2700 mark, a breakout above this critical resistance level is essential to gain further momentum.\n\nHas Ethereum Price Entered Downtrend Momentum?\n\nExamining Ethereum\u2019s daily time frame chart, it\u2019s evident that corrections are a regular occurrence. In November 2023, the cryptocurrency underwent a 38.2% correction, followed by a 23.6% retracement in December 2023. Such trends suggest that these retracements, particularly around the 38.2% Fibonacci level, are typical for Ether, often serving as a precursor to subsequent upward movements.\n\nExponential Moving Average (EMA): Amid the recent downturn, the 100-day EMA slope at $2200 showcased its sustainability as valid pullback support.\n\nRelative Strength Index (RSI): The daily RSI slope below 45% reflects the market sentiment currently bearish.\n\nRelated Articles:"

        "content": "Along with Bitcoin, institutional investors are willing to gain exposure to some of the top altcoins. As a result, some of the top players like BlackRock are actively pursuing approval for a spot Ethereum ETF from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nSpot Ethereum ETF Holds 60% Approval Chance\n\nBloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffart suggested that there is an estimated 60% likelihood of spot Ethereum ETFs receiving approval in May. However, the recent postponement of decisions on potential ether ETFs from BlackRock and Grayscale by the Securities and Exchange Commission has impacted the outcomes. Other contenders for a spot ether ETF, including Ark 21Shares and VanEck, are also awaiting regulatory decisions.\n\nadvertisement\n\nMay 23 is the upcoming crucial date in the spot ether narrative, according to Seyffart. On this date, the 240-day window for the SEC to make decisions on proposals from Ark/21Shares and VanEck will conclude. Speaking to Blockworks, Seyffart added:\n\n\u201cMy base case is still probably around 60-ish percent that they\u2019ll approve them. But there\u2019s plenty of ways they can delay. So if the SEC wants to get geared up and ready to go and wants everyone to go at the same time, they\u2019ll likely do it on May 23 unless they can figure out some way to deny or delay this whole process and do what they want\u201d.\n\nNevertheless, when the May deadlines approach, the SEC has the option to request potential issuers to withdraw their applications or issue denials. According to Seyffart, if the SEC asks Ark/21Shares or VanEck to withdraw, it could be seen as a positive sign indicating potential approval. He added, \u201cThe SEC might just need more time to get up to speed with Ethereum versus Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nHowever, if the May approval for spot Ethereum ETF doesn\u2019t work out, Seyffart believes that it shall happen next year in 2025.\n\nETF Approval Almost Guaranteed In Long Term\n\nVan Buren Capital general partner Scott Johnsson shared his perspective on the potential roadmap for an ETH ETF in a recent post on X Thursday. While acknowledging the current nuances, he anticipates that, in the long term, the approval of an ETH spot ETF is highly likely.\n\nThe Road Ahead: A View on ETH Spot This is intended to be a deep dive into the current landscape for crypto spot ETFs generally with emphasis on ETH.

However, Seyffart suggested that the SEC might scrutinize spot ether ETFs, claiming the futures market lacks sufficient size, liquidity, or impact.\n\nSEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, in a recent interview, expressed the view that the SEC shouldn\u2019t require a court decision to recognize the arbitrary nature of its approach. She emphasized applying precedent to spot Ethereum ETF decisions."

        "content": "Qadir Ak is the founder of Coinpedia. He has over a decade of experience writing about technology and has been covering the blockchain and cryptocurrency space since 2010. He has also interviewed a few prominent experts within the cryptocurrency space.\n\n\ufeffAnalyst Crypto Jebb has opened up about the reason behind the major drop in Bitcoin\u2019s value over the last 24 hours, attributing it to the filling of the Bitcoin CME Futures Gap. While some may believe that this marks the end of the drop, Jebb argues otherwise, hinting the potential for further decline.\n\nBitcoin experienced an impressive 120-day rally, soaring from $25,000 to $49,000, primarily fueled by the excitement surrounding the launch of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). However, since their introduction about two weeks ago, Bitcoin has entered a downtrend.\n\nJebb points out that the initial support level was quickly breached, leading to a sharp decline back to $44,000 immediately after trading commenced. Predictions were made for a potential drop to $32,500. The size of the previous rally is a crucial factor in Jebb\u2019s analysis, suggesting that larger rallies often precede more substantial drops. With Bitcoin\u2019s $24,000 rally, a 50% correction could result in a $12,000 drop, bringing Bitcoin to approximately $37,000. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $39,700 levels.\n\nJebb points to various indicators supporting his bearish outlook, such as the Fear and Greed Index, which has not fully reset and remains above 50. Additionally, both the three-day and weekly chart indicators like MACD and RSI are signaling strong bearish sentiment.\n\nAlso Read: Breaking Down the Ethereum ETF Approval Roadmap with Finance Expert Scott Johnsson\n\nThe recent shift of Bitcoin from the GBTC trust to exchanges, influenced by the introduction of ETFs and associated fees, has added significant sell pressure. Jebb notes that many bulls, especially those holding the GBTC trust, are now taking profits.\n\nThe analysis extends beyond Bitcoin, anticipating potential drops in various altcoins. Jebb suggests that Ethereum could dip to $1,800, Solana to $48, and Cardano to around $0.40 in the coming bearish trend. Despite the current bearish outlook, Jebb remains optimistic about a future market rally in 2024 and 2025."

However, Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler has provided little clarity on the prospects of such an approval.\n\nDecrypting the SEC Chair\u2019s Vague Ethereum ETF Remarks\n\nDuring an interview with CNBC, Gensler refrained from offering substantial encouragement when questioned about the likelihood of a spot Ethereum ETF gaining SEC approval in the near future.\n\nWhile discussing the recent developments, Gensler emphasized the SEC\u2019s approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, drawing a comparison to previously approved commodity-based exchange-traded products.\n\nGensler declined to provide further insights into the status of an Ethereum ETF specifically. Notably, his choice of words, highlighting Bitcoin as a non-security commodity, suggests a potential distinction between Bitcoin\u2019s status and the prospective status of other cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Regulatory Quandary Still a Puzzle\n\nFor years, Gensler has consistently expressed his view that Bitcoin is the only cryptocurrency definitively categorized as a commodity, placing it outside the SEC\u2019s regulatory purview.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile the SEC has not officially declared Ethereum\u2019s security status, previous legal filings indicate the agency\u2019s consideration of Ethereum transactions falling under its jurisdiction.\n\nThe potential classification of Ethereum as a security could present regulatory challenges for a spot Ethereum ETF, potentially exceeding the scrutiny faced by a Bitcoin ETF.\n\nGensler\u2019s statements come amid changing circumstances and legal judgments, such as the court order in October compelling the SEC to review Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin ETF application.\n\nThe court\u2019s decision, which forced the SEC to approve a Bitcoin futures ETF application, also approved an Ethereum futures ETF in the same month, possibly setting the stage for a parallel legal scenario.\n\nThe unfolding developments surrounding Bitcoin spot ETFs and Gensler\u2019s cautious remarks continue to leave investors in suspense regarding the fate of Ethereum ETF aspirations."

        "content": "A widely followed cryptocurrency analyst and trader believes that one top 15 altcoin project could more than double against Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nMicha\u00ebl van de Poppe tells his 686,300 followers on the social media platform X that the decentralized oracle network Chainlink will likely witness a massive breakout rally against Bitcoin (LINK/BTC) this year.\n\n\u201cChainlink against Bitcoin is still looking for a big breakout later this year. Higher lows are being established, a breakout above 4,500 sats, and it\u2019s going to go to 9,000 sats. I\u2019m buying the dips.\u201d\n\nLINK/BTC is trading for 0.000336 BTC ($14.09) at time of writing, indicating an upside potential of about 167% if the pair hits the analyst\u2019s target.\n\nNext up, the trader says Bitcoin will likely trade within the range of about $49,000 and $39,000 before a breakout after the April halving event, when miners\u2019 rewards are cut in half.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve not posted an update on this chart for Bitcoin in a while. It\u2019s going pretty well as planned. Now, consolidation will likely occur before continuing to new all-time highs.\u201d\n\nThe analyst also believes that the total market capitalization for digital assets is in an uptrend after testing a key support level at $1.547 trillion.\n\n\u201cTotal market capitalization of crypto has taken the liquidity and bounced from the crucial area.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only.\n\nThe crypto market fell following the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs.

Pullix (PLX) is also drawing investor interest, raising over $4.6 million in ongoing presale.\n\nWhales double down on Ethereum\n\nEthereum recently fell. While some investors sold their ETH, whales took advantage of the low prices to buy more.\n\nAccording to Spot On Chain, a single whale bought over $46 million worth of ETH before staking on Lido, a staking liquidity platform.\n\nOver the past 2 days, an entity with 8 wallets withdrew $46.02M in $ETH from #Binance and #Bitfinex at ~$2,419, then staked with #Lido:\n\n\n\n\u2013 5 wallets withdrew 50.15M $USDT from #Aave to CEX for 19,021 $ETH ($46.02M).\n\n\n\n\u2013 3 wallets still hold ~30M $USDT in #Aave and may deposit it\u2026 pic.twitter.com/vqPYTTaWjT \u2014 Spot On Chain (@spotonchain) January 23, 2024\n\nAnother whale spent $7.3 million to purchase ETH.\n\nThe increased whale activity suggests that market participants are bullish on ETH.\n\nYou might also like: Coinbase to address Ethereum client diversity woes\n\nThis optimism is amid the ongoing debate on whether the U.S. SEC will approve a spot Ethereum ETF.\n\nPullix presale draws attention\n\nPullix combines the features of centralized and decentralized exchanges.\n\nIt offers a variety of earning opportunities, including passive interest in liquidity provision and staking.\n\nYou might also like: Aave and VeChain trailing Pullix, PLX\u2019s potential draws investors\n\nPullix also provides investors with liquidity and slippage-based trades for fast and efficient trading.\n\nIn the ongoing presale, PLX is changing hands for $0.10. Analysts expect more growth once it launches later in Q1 2024.\n\nWhales buy more Shiba Inu\n\nOnchain data shows that whales are stacking up more Shiba Inu (SHIB) and ETH.\n\nAccording to Etherscan, an anonymous whale purchased over 606 billion SHIB, bringing their total SHIB holdings to over 1 trillion coins.\n\nSo far, Shibarium, a layer-2 solution, has processed over 300 million transactions, with an average of 1.2 million to 7.8 million transactions per day.\n\nThis uptick might support prices.\n\nClosing thoughts\n\nFalling prices spurred whales to buy more ETH and SHIB.

        "content": "Qadir Ak is the founder of Coinpedia. He has over a decade of experience writing about technology and has been covering the blockchain and cryptocurrency space since 2010. He has also interviewed a few prominent experts within the cryptocurrency space.\n\nStory Highlights Ethereum needs a DCM Futures Listing, then '40 Act and '33 Act Futures ETFs before reaching the final spot ETF stage.\n\nSection 6(b)(5) of the Exchange Act, requiring \"significant size\" and a Surveillance Sharing Agreement.\n\nSEC focused on addressing \"fraud and manipulation\" concerns, sidestepping the \"significant size\" test.\n\nCrypto enthusiasts and investors are anticipating the potential approval of a spot Ethereum ETF, and Scott Johnsson, Van Buren\u2019s General Partner and General Counsel, is here to guide us through the intricacies in a series of Twitter threads titled \u201cThe Road Ahead: A ETH Spot.\u201d\n\nThe Road Ahead: A View on ETH Spot\n\n\n\nThis is intended to be a deep dive into the current landscape for crypto spot ETFs generally with emphasis on ETH.

Read on for a simple breakdown!\n\nPart 1 \u2013 General Roadmap\n\nJohnsson begins with a broad overview, presenting a four-step roadmap for spot ETF approval. Drawing parallels with the successful Bitcoin ETF journey, the process involves securing a DCM Futures Listing, advancing through \u201940 Act Futures ETF, \u201933 Act Futures ETF, and finally achieving the coveted spot approval.\n\nThe journey starts with a historical BTC spot ETF approval timeline, emphasizing milestones like the CME Bitcoin Commodity Futures Listing in December 2017 and the recent spot ETF approval in January 2024. Johnsson underscores the crucial role of a DCM Futures Listing as a prerequisite for any spot ETF.\n\nPart 2 \u2013 Threshold Issue\n\nIn the second section, Johnsson delves into Section 6(b)(5) of the Exchange Act, a hurdle for both BTC and potential ETH spot ETFs. He breaks down the impact of the Grayscale ruling on the SEC\u2019s stance, focusing on the \u201csignificant size\u201d test and the Surveillance Sharing Agreement (SSA).\n\nRead More: BlackRock\u2019s Ethereum ETF: March 10th Deadline Could Be Make-or-Break!\n\nPart 3 \u2013 BTC Spot Approval\n\nThe third part explores in detail the SEC\u2019s approval order for BTC spot ETFs, unraveling the reasoning behind addressing the \u201cpotential fraud and manipulation\u201d concern outlined in Section 6(b)(5). Johnsson analyzes five key points from the order, highlighting the SEC\u2019s sidestepping of the \u201csignificant size\u201d test.\n\nPart 4 \u2013 ETH Analysis\n\nTransitioning to the fourth part, Johnsson applies insights from BTC to speculate on the potential approval of an ETH spot ETF. He highlights an optimistic perspective, emphasizing the SEC\u2019s correlation-based rule for approval. However, he cautions about potential challenges and the impact of ongoing regulatory actions against platforms such as Coinbase and Binance.\n\nDid You Know? SEC Says \u2018No\u2019 to Ethereum ETFs, but Issuers Keep the Faith\n\nResponding to queries about the estimated timeline for spot ETH ETF approval, Johnsson suggests another year, maybe two, anticipating the need for the early period of the ETH futures market to roll off from the sample period.\n\nIf not May, then I'd say another year maybe two from now. My guess is we would need the early period of the ETH futures market to roll off from the sample period. \u2014 Scott Johnsson (@SGJohnsson) January 26, 2024\n\nThe SEC\u2019s path to approving an ETH spot ETF is complex, but far from clear.

        "content": "Bitcoin and Ethereum Price Prediction as BTC Rallies 10% From Recent Bottom and ETH Sees $5 Billion Flood In \u2013 Time to Buy?\n\nIn the dynamic world of cryptocurrency, Bitcoin\u2019s price prediction seems bullish, especially as it experiences a noteworthy upswing, currently trading at $42,220, marking a nearly 1% increase on Sunday.\n\nThis positive trend in Bitcoin\u2019s valuation coincides with a high-ranking representative\u2019s praise of BlackRock\u2019s Bitcoin ETF, hailing it as a \u201chuge success\u201d across various metrics.\n\nSimultaneously, the US dollar is witnessing a decline in the wake of recent inflation figures, setting a critical stage for the upcoming Federal Reserve meeting next week. These developments collectively paint a complex but intriguing picture for Bitcoin\u2019s future in the financial landscape.\n\nBlackRock\u2019s Bitcoin ETF Declared \u2018Huge Success\u2019 by Top Official\n\n\n\nSince its recent inception, BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has seen strong growth, and in an interview with Yahoo Finance, U.S. Head Rachel Aguirre expressed pleasure with the outcome. After receiving permission from the SEC, IBIT\u2019s trading volume increased to an astounding $3 billion in just two weeks, drawing in $1.6 billion in capital.\n\nAguirre highlighted BlackRock\u2019s dedication to giving investor\u2019s access to Bitcoin, praising the product for its three USPs: better accessibility, the removal of hassles related to direct Bitcoin ownership, and offering high-caliber support.\n\nBREAKING: The BlackRock iShares #Bitcoin Trust is a huge success by multiple metrics, according to Rachel Aguirre, U.S. Head of iShares Products. pic.twitter.com/ZOVZEgR3dC \u2014 sunnydecree (@sunnydecree) January 24, 2024\n\nAlthough Aguirre refuted rumors of a spot Ethereum ETF, she praised BlackRock for being ahead of the curve in gauging investor demand. BlackRock currently has 16,361 BTC in order to fund IBIT.\n\nThe favorable reaction highlights the increasing interest of institutions in cryptocurrencies, which is probably pushing up the price of Bitcoin.\n\nUS Dollar Weakens Post-Inflation Data, Ahead of Fed Meeting\n\n\n\nFriday saw a little decline in the value of the US dollar as December inflation statistics confirmed the market\u2019s expectations of a mid-year interest rate drop by the Federal Reserve. Though it might have gained for a fourth week in a row, the dollar index fell 0.1% to 103.41.\n\nIn line with expectations, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index increased by 0.2%, preventing annual inflation from rising above 3%. Analysts say there is no reason for the market to be concerned about inflation anytime soon, which lessens the chance of more tightening.\n\nUS dollar slips after inflation data, Fed meeting looms next week \u2013 The Economic Times https://t.co/o391aoNCWW \u2014 FOMC Alerts (@FOMCAlerts) January 28, 2024\n\nThe dollar\u2019s rise is being restrained by mounting disinflationary pressures globally, even though U.S. rate futures priced in a 47% chance of a rate decrease in March.\n\nThe situation with Bitcoin (BTC) is becoming better, and if investors continue to be concerned about inflation, they may become more interested in inflation-resistant assets like cryptocurrencies.\n\nBitcoin Price Prediction\n\nOn January 28, Bitcoin (BTC/USD) exhibits a steady uptrend, currently trading at $42,401, marking a 0.66% increase. The four-hour chart highlights pivotal price levels that are key to Bitcoin\u2019s immediate trajectory. The pivot point is placed at $42,161, with the asset facing immediate resistance at $43,394, followed by higher resistance levels at $44,372 and $45,581. Conversely, support levels are established at $40,957, $39,644, and $38,618. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 70, indicating a strong buying interest that borders on overbought conditions. The 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) stands at $40,820, offering a significant support level. A notable chart pattern is Bitcoin\u2019s breakthrough above a double top around the $42,160 level. Closing above this could signal a robust buying trend, with potential for further upward movement. The overall trend for Bitcoin is bullish above the $42,160 mark. Ethereum Price Prediction On January 28, Ethereum exhibits a promising uptrend, trading at $2,289.7, a gain of 0.97%. The four-hour chart analysis highlights critical levels influencing Ethereum\u2019s short-term market dynamics. Its pivot point rests at $2,321, with immediate resistance observed at $2,388. Subsequent resistance levels are marked at $2,476 and $2,560. On the downside, Ethereum finds immediate support at $2,241, with further levels at $2,169 and $2,102. Read More: Ethereum Price The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 54, indicating a neutral market momentum. The 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) is at $2,314, closely aligning with the current price trajectory. Chart analysis reveals that Ethereum has completed a 38.2% Fibonacci retracement at $2,313. However, a downward trendline near the $2,300 mark may pose a hurdle for further upward movement. Overall, Ethereum presents a bullish trend above the $2,320 threshold. In the short term, it is expected to test the resistance levels, especially at $2,388, providing traders and investors with key indicators to watch in the coming days."

        "content": "This post is sponsored and not a part of Finbold's editorial content. For a full disclaimer, please click here. If you encounter any issues, kindly report them to [email protected]. Crypto assets/products can be highly risky. Never invest unless you\u2019re prepared to lose all the money you invest.\n\nA new crypto cartoon was just released on YouTube. The 2 minute and 54 second, animated short film explains the importance of a new Bitcoin rival on the Ethereum-Blockchain; A cryptocurrency called Mollars token. It\u2019s an innovative look into the digital asset and the way investors can earn money, in the form of ROI yields, by investing in its initial coin offering today.\n\nThe animated video has received 600 views since its launch on the official Mollars YouTube channel Saturday night. The view count is likely to go much higher as the week progresses and the viral-worthy content is spread about.\n\nWhat does the cartoon short film say about Mollars?\n\n\n\nThe cartoon summarizes many of the biggest key points of the Mollars Project.\n\nThe cryptocurrency is a store-of-value token like Bitcoin It\u2019s\u2019 on the Ethereum blockchain Mollars will offer traders the perks of Bitcoin but with lower transaction fees Buying during the ICO stage, before the token is listed on a public crypto exchange, can generate positive ROI yields for early investors How ICO funds are used aka \u2018tokenomics\u2019\n\n\n\nAfter these key points, the Mollars animation delves deep into how crypto traders make money from token presales. The film breaks down how one token that costs $0.45 cents today will be worth $0.62 cents, as soon as it goes live on a public cryptocurrency exchange.\n\nBeyond initial ROI gains ,the crypto animation also explains how long-term profits are much better on tokens. When the demand is high and a token is offering a solution, as Mollars is, the animation urges users to HODL and wait for much bigger gains that usually parallels how well a brand\u2019s value is built.\n\nHow Token Supply Will Be Sold\n\nThe Total Token Supply [TTS] distribution is also broken down in the cartoon. According to the artsy visual, Mollars TTS will be 10-million tokens. Only 4-million will be sold at discounted prices in the current initial coin offering. Once the ICO is closed, the other 6-million will be sold on a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange [DEX] like Uniswap.\n\nLast, beginning at the 2 minutes and 34 seconds mark, the animated characters elaborate on how investors can acquire the new Bitcoin-alternative. Users can visit the official website, Mollars.cc, and make a purchase by using Ethereum (ETH), Tether (USDT) or a credit card charge.\n\nThe \u201cMollars Cartoon\u201d is a great tool for educating novice investors. It could also attract more money from crypto whales and sharks, who dominate the list of the top 5 single transaction buyers from the $MOLLARS token presale.\n\nBeyond the visual itself, this video continues to show the great leadership and innovative ideas flowing from the creator of this store-of-value token. The launch of this short film was without notice and if there are other surprises to come from Mollars of similar quality, it could further catalyze growth for the initial coin offering, branding value, and demand."

Its distributed nature further bolsters trust and transparency, minimizing the risk of centralized control.\n\nFlexibility and Adaptability: Ethereum\u2019s design prioritizes flexibility and adaptability. Upgradeability mechanisms allow it to evolve and adopt new features to remain relevant and address emerging challenges in the blockchain space.\n\nGlobal Impact and Pioneering Spirit: Ethereum has gone beyond being a mere technological advancement; it has ignited a global conversation about decentralization, ownership, and financial autonomy. Its pioneering spirit continues to inspire innovation and shape the future of our digital world.\n\nHow To Get Started on the Ethereum Network for ERC-20 Tokens.\n\nTo buy/sell ERC-20 Tokens, you\u2019ll need a crypto wallet. There are several crypto wallets to choose from within the Ethereum network and, popular options include software wallets like MetaMask, Trust Wallet, Coinbase Wallet, Binance WAllet, etc.\n\nIf you are using a desktop computer, you can download Google Chrome and install the MetaMask Wallet Chrome extension. If you prefer using your mobile phone, you can download MetaMask wallet via Google Play or the iOS App Store.\n\nJust make sure that you are downloading the official Chrome extension and mobile app by visiting MetaMask Wallet\u2019s website.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve registered and set up your wallet via the Google Chrome Extension or via the mobile app you downloaded, MetaMask wallet allows users to manage their cryptocurrency wallets and interact with decentralized applications (DApps) to execute transactions on supported blockchain networks directly from their browsers. (Write down your seed phrase on a piece of paper and keep it in a safe place!).\n\nNow, you\u2019ll need to connect and add Ethereum to your MetaMask wallet. You may refer to MetaMask support page for reference on their website.\n\nTrading ERC-20 Tokens on the Ethereum Network.\n\nIn order to ERC-20 token trades on the Ethereum network, you will need to buy ETH as your base currency. You can buy ETH on centralized exchanges such as Binance, copy your wallet address from Metamask, and then send the ETH from Binance to your Metamask wallet.\n\nYou can also purchase ETH directly within the Metamask wallet using traditional payment methods such as credit or debit cards, etc.\n\nJust click on the \u201cBuy/Sell\u201d button within Metamask to open the interface. Here, you can put how much ETH (or any other token) you want to buy in terms of dollar terms, pick your payment method, and then click \u201cBuy\u201d.\n\nNote that to buy crypto directly within Metamask, you will need to provide info such as your country and state. However, it is a straightforward process that only takes a minute.\n\nIt\u2019ll only take a couple of minutes at most for your ETH to arrive in your wallet. Once the ETH arrives, you are all set to begin trading ERC-20 tokens on the Ethereum network. So, head over to UniSwap to get started on your trading journey.\n\nHow To Trade ERC-20 Tokens On The Ethereum Network Using UniSwap\n\nUniswap is a decentralized exchange (DEX) protocol built on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows users to trade Ethereum-based tokens directly from their wallets without the need for intermediaries or traditional order books.\n\nUniswap offers users a simple and straightforward way to buy and sell a wide variety of tokens. Be sure you\u2019re on the Uniswap website to protect your wallet.\n\nThe first step is clicking on the \u201cLaunch App\u201d button at the top right corner, as shown in the image below:\n\nThe next step is clicking on the connect wallet option on Uniswap at the top right corner, as shown in the image below:\n\nConnect to your preferred wallet as shown below. (In this case, it\u2019s Metamask):\n\nOnce connected, switch Metamask to the Ethereum network. (If you\u2019re already on the Ethereum network, you do not need to switch):\n\nAfter connecting MetaMask to the Ethereum network, go to Uniswap, and then you can start your ERC-20 Tokens on the Ethereum network using UniSwap.\n\nTrading Ethereum Tokens On Uniswap\n\nThe next step is to select your preferred tokens on the UnsSwap interface and since Uniswap operates on a token to token trading model, click on the \u201cselect token\u201d button to select the trading pair you want to trade against.\n\nFor example, if you want to buy USDT using ETH, select ETH \u2013 USDT, enter the amount, then click on \u201cswap\u201d or \u201ctrade now\u201d and confirm the transaction in your Metamask wallet. You can view the tokens in your wallet\u2019s asset list.\n\nBuying and Selling ERC-20 Tokens with the Metamask Wallet\n\nEthereum Network users can also buy and sell tokens using the Metamask extension wallet already connected to the Ethereum network. To do this, make sure you\u2019re connected to the Ethereum network and have ETH to swap and pay for gas fees. Then, navigate to the \u201cSwap\u201d button as shown below. This will take you to the Swap interface inside Metamask.\n\nUsing the image above as a guide, you can also search for tokens using the name or the contract address, just like on UniSwap. Input the amount of ETH you want to swap, confirm that you have the correct token, and then click \u201cSwap.\u201d Once the transaction is confirmed, the tokens you just bought will be sent to your wallet.\n\nTracking ERC-20 Token Prices on The Ethereum Network\n\nERC-20 token holders and traders can take advantage of on-chain tools like DeFiLama to gain access to comprehensive market insights for specific tokens. These insights include price data and contract information, empowering users to make well-informed trading decisions based on reliable and up-to-date information.\n\nDextools is a comprehensive analytic resource for managing digital assets traded on ERC-20 Decentralized Exchanges. It\u2019s a vibrant analytical cryptocurrency resource that provides statistical information on all leading blockchains and crypto projects.\n\nAmong these features, an exceptional one is the charting functionality, which delivers both real-time and historical price data for a wide range of tokens.\n\nBy utilizing these charts, users gain valuable insights into price trends, trading volumes, and other pertinent metrics. This enables them to pinpoint potential entry or exit points for their trades with precision and confidence. For example, let\u2019s assume you\u2019re $ETH for $LIDO, your trading pair is ETH/LIDO.\n\nNote, Trading pairs serve as bridges between currencies. For example, the ETH/LIDOpair allows you to acquire $LIDO tokens using Ethereum (ETH).\n\nChoose the pair that fits your funding situation and trading strategy. Consider using ETH if you already hold it, or fiat currencies if you\u2019re venturing in fresh.\n\nLet\u2019s track the $LIDO token on Dextools, here\u2019s what we have:\n\nConclusion\n\nBuying, selling, and trading ERC-20 tokens on the Ethereum network can be a thrilling adventure, opening doors to exciting investment opportunities and unlocking the potential of decentralized finance. However, it demands knowledge, caution, and a well-defined strategy.\n\nThis guide serves as your map and compass, but the ultimate treasure lies in your own learning and exploration. Navigate with confidence, trade responsibly, and remember that the most valuable asset in this journey is your knowledge.\n\nFeatured image from CoinMarketCap, chart from Tradingview.com"

        "content": "Disclaimer: The opinions expressed by our writers are their own and do not represent the views of U.Today. The financial and market information provided on U.Today is intended for informational purposes only. U.Today is not liable for any financial losses incurred while trading cryptocurrencies. Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nXRP appears to have begun its market movements earlier than anticipated. The chart shows a notable shift from the recent sideways trading pattern, as XRP starts to carve out a new direction.\n\nAs of the latest trends, XRP has been testing the support level around $0.50, a crucial psychological threshold for the asset. A sustained move below this level could signal further bearish momentum, potentially leading the price to test the next significant support zone around $0.47.\n\nOn the flip side, if XRP manages to stabilize and bounce back from the current support, the initial resistance is likely to be encountered near the $0.54 mark, where the 50-day moving average currently lies. This moving average has historically acted as a dynamic resistance level, and a breakout above could propel XRP toward the $0.56 level, which aligns with the 100-day moving average.\n\nFurther complicating the chart is the downward trendline that has been in play since the local high established in November. This trendline has repeatedly acted as resistance, pushing the price downward each time it has been tested. For a true reversal to be confirmed, XRP would need to break above this trendline with significant volume to validate the move.\n\nSolana is leading pack\n\nSolana is manifesting its strength as the top performer among the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Despite overall market volatility, SOL's price action has been signaling a stronger recovery compared to other assets.\n\nAt the time of analysis, Solana is trading around the $90 mark, having rebounded with considerable momentum from the support level near $78.35. This pivotal point, bolstered by the 100-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), has served as a springboard for the recent bullish trend. The price of SOL has been consistently creating higher lows, indicative of strong buying interest at these levels.\n\nResistance for SOL is currently looming at the $100 psychological level, a breakthrough of which could propel the price toward the next significant resistance at $110.\n\nThe relative strength of Solana is further substantiated by the resurgence of a risk appetite on the market, particularly evidenced by the blossoming of meme coins. This renewed interest in higher-risk assets typically bodes well for ecosystems like Solana that support a variety of decentralized applications and niche crypto projects.\n\nEthereum needs push\n\nThe Ethereum market is currently facing a confluence of challenges as it searches for the momentum to sustain its position. A recent chart analysis reveals an indecisive atmosphere among investors, with Ethereum struggling to find a strong directional move.\n\nAt present, Ethereum is hovering around the $2,200 mark, a level that has seen significant activity and is currently acting as a temporary support. However, the lack of bullish conviction suggests that this support level may not hold if a new wave of selling pressure emerges.\n\nResistance levels are observed near the $2,400 range, where previous attempts to break higher have been met with a firm rejection, indicating a substantial barrier to upward movement.\n\nThe selling pressure is partly attributed to the recent news of Celsius Network liquidating approximately $1 billion worth of Ethereum holdings. This substantial amount has the potential to saturate the market, overwhelming current liquidity and triggering a downturn. As a result, the $2,000 psychological level is eyed as the next critical support zone, a breach of which could see a sharp decline toward the $1,950 region, where the 200-day moving average lies, providing stronger historical support.\n\nOn the flip side, if Ethereum can absorb the selling pressure and gain the necessary \"fuel,\" a push above the $2,400 resistance could open the path toward the $2,500 area before challenging the more formidable resistance at $2,600, which aligns with the 50-day moving average."

It has enabled the submission of batches through EIP-4844 blobs.\n\nThis suggests that once Dencun is activated on the Ethereum mainnet, OP Stack chains will be able to leverage blob space, leading to reductions in transaction fees.\n\nThe state of Optimism L2 and POS network\n\nExamining Total Value Locked (TVL) data on L2 Beats showed that Optimism maintained dominance over other Layer 2 solutions. As of this writing, it held over 25% of the space, amounting to over $5.2 billion.\n\nIn addition, a review of OP mainnet statistics showed that the completed transactions were over 195 million. However, the number of new transactions has experienced a decline after reaching its peak in two months.\n\nThe chart showed a rise in transactions to over 500,000 on 24th January, followed by a slight decrease to around 460,000 at the time of this writing.\n\nFurthermore, an analysis of new accounts also showed a recent downturn. On 24th January, the number of new accounts, similar to transactions, rose to over 13,000.\n\nAs of this writing, this figure has decreased to around 9,000. The anticipated reduction that the Dencun activation might bring could attract more users to the network. This could increase the number of users and transactions.\n\nOP close to breaking immediate resistance\n\nA daily timeframe analysis of Optimism showed a sustained recovery, with the chart showing its third consecutive day of upward movement.\n\nAt the time of this writing, it was trading at around $3, showing a more than 4% increase in value.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 OPs worth today\n\nFurthermore, the continuous rise has positioned it close to breaking the immediate resistance. This resistance level is around $3.1, with its short-moving average (yellow line) marking this level.\n\nOP could be further impacted positively by reduced fees and increased transactions."

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) performance against Bitcoin (BTC) is a leading indicator of market cycles and an altseason. Thus, cryptocurrency traders and investors constantly monitor the ETH/BTC pair for valuable insights.\n\nIn particular, the well-known CrediBULL Crypto has his eyes turned to this pair and warns of a possible Ethereum sell-off. According to him, Ethereum has found a local top against Bitcoin in an expected deviation above previous highs.\n\nCrediBULL Crypto posted this analysis on X (formerly Twitter) on January 25, quoting a previous post where he forecasted the deviation, as happened.\n\nBoom. Beautiful rejection on ETH/BTC as expected. May revisit those local highs but imo a full retrace of ETH/BTC is on the horizon as $BTC recovers from this recent correction and begins it's next impulsive move to the upside, outperforming ETH once again.\n\n\n\nAs I have said before\u2026 https://t.co/HllnRI4Pee pic.twitter.com/uiOqcVvRBO \u2014 CrediBULL Crypto (@CredibleCrypto) January 25, 2024\n\nETH/BTC analysis\n\nNotably, the trader points to a breakout from the current support line at 0.04905 BTC per Ethereum. Furthermore, ETH/BTC should continue its downfall through 0.04624 BTC straight to a range below 0.03800 BTC.\n\nETH/BTC daily price chart. Source: CrediBULL Crypto\n\nCrediBULL Crypto explained ETH/BTC will only find a bottom once Bitcoin makes a new all-time high. Therefore, investors must be aware of \u201cany bounces before that,\u201d as they will most likely fade away, in his words.\n\nSince posting, Bitcoin has already outperformed Ethereum by around 2%, validating the above analysis. However, the economic context is a key factor to consider. Moreover, the cryptocurrency market is unpredictable, and everything could change swiftly.\n\nOn the other hand, institutional investors are turning to Ethereum and showing support for altcoins and tokenization. Recently, Franklin Templeton backed ETH, SOL, and other cryptocurrencies focused on utility. In the meantime, BlackRock\u2019s CEO shared his vision of tokenization while talking about an expected Ethereum spot ETF approval.\n\nAll things considered, it is possible that the ETH/BTC pair surprise technical analysts in the near future, depending on further developments involving institutions and the regulatory landscape. Investors must trade cautiously, keeping themselves updated on the adoption and demand for Ethereum or Bitcoin.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

The data revealed strong competition with Ethereum, and it ranked higher than all other major blockchain networks.\n\nPolygon comes second in the number of acquired users\n\nPolygon delivered an impressive performance that went somewhat unnoticed by many.\n\nHowever, recent data published by Flipside sheds light on the network\u2019s standing, showing that it ranked second only to Ethereum in user metrics. The data showed that the observed networks attracted over 62 million users.\n\nAmong these, Polygon had over 15.2 million acquired users, placing it just behind Ethereum with its over 15.4 million acquired users. In this context, \u201cacquired users\u201d refers to users who conducted at least two transactions on the network.\n\nDigging deeper into the data, Polygon also secured the second position in the number of super users. In this context, super users are those acquired users who conducted over 100 transactions on a specific network.\n\nThe data showed that Polygon had more than 510,000 such users in 2023. Furthermore, the network claimed the second-highest count of super users among NFT buyers and sellers for the year, with over 175,000 buyers and over 120,000 sellers, respectively.\n\nHow transactions trended on Polygon\n\nAn immediate observation in the analysis of Polygon\u2019s transaction trend is the remarkable volume it experienced in 2023.\n\nThe Scanner chart clearly showed that the network reached its peak transaction volume that year. Specifically, the highest daily transaction count recorded was over 16.4 million on 16th November, 2023.\n\nHowever, recent data showed a notable decline, with the current transaction count at over 3.3 million as of this writing.\n\nThe active account chart over the past year showed no significant trends besides a spike around October. However, recent developments showed a shift as the number of active accounts increased.\n\nAt the time of this analysis, the count of active accounts was around 673,000. The network\u2019s highest-ever recorded number of active accounts was 782,186.\n\nMATIC sees more downtrends than uptrends\n\nPolygon showed strong performance towards the end of the previous year. Still, the new year has yet to see a continuation of this impressive trend.\n\nThe daily timeframe chart showed a downward trend for most of the year. However, as of the current assessment, it was trading with an over 2.4% increase in value, reaching around $0.74.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 MATICs worth today\n\nAnalyzing the Relative Strength Index (RSI) showed that Polygon requires additional uptrends to break free from the prevailing bearish trend it currently faces.\n\nThe positive increase in value at present suggests a potential shift, but sustained upward movement will be crucial for a more significant reversal in its overall trend."

According to Tim Beiko, the update will first activate its features on the Sepolia and Holesky testnets, on January 30th and February 7th, respectively.\n\nThese highly anticipated activations on testnets pave the way for a successful deployment of Dencun on the mainnet, after a series of conclusive tests. It\u2019s worth noting that preliminary trials have already taken place on January 17th on Goerli.\n\nThe integration of Dencun into Sepolia and Holesky is critical before its official launch. It aims to validate its robustness and ensure a smooth transition to this new version of Ethereum.\n\nTim Beiko emphasizes: if the tests meet expectations, the launch date of Dencun will be announced on the mainnet. Furthermore, he urges operators to update their nodes for flawless deployment on D-Day.\n\nConcrete changes that crush fees\n\nDencun continues the revolutionary work started by Shapella in 2023, this time by integrating the much anticipated \u201cEIP-4844\u201d update, better known as \u201cProtodanksharding\u201d.\n\nThis fundamental advancement is expected to drastically reduce transaction fees for Ethereum-based layer 2 solutions. We\u2019re talking about a dramatic 90% drop for protocols like Optimism or Arbitrum!\n\nThe implications of Dencun are therefore huge in terms of accessibility and increased use of the Ethereum blockchain, thanks to this radical cost reduction. Its implementation will also undoubtedly stimulate the emergence of new layer 2 innovations.\n\nIn summary, this announcement generates immense interest from both investors and developers. The upcoming activation of Dencun will mark a decisive milestone for Ethereum, thus strengthening its dominant position in the blockchain market. Its rollout is already the talk of the crypto ecosystem!\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program!

Ethereum Classic (ETC) is losing investors and with these figures, who can blame them for leaving? Ethereum Classic (ETC) currently costs 23.27% but this equates to a 2.42% drop in value in the last 7 days. Even looking at a longer time frame, we see that Ethereum Classic (ETC) has had a bad year, with its value being in the red for most of the year.

According to experts, this is not likely. The worth of a Celestia (TIA) token is worrisome, in the last 7 days its value has dropped to $16.66 and this translates to a 2.4% drop in value. In addition to this, Celestia\u2019s (TIA) trading volume is affected, it has pumped by 50% in just 24 hours.

Top analysts have examined the project and have predicted that it will be a top project in 2024 and will be a blue chip company in no time. But what is this project all about? Pushd (PUSHD) is going to be the first decentralized online marketplace. Users will be able to buy and sell items with crypto. Pushd (PUSHD) will have a monopoly of this marketspace and so it is going to be very profitable.

This was a sign that investors trusted ETH and the network enormously, even though it is not evident on the price chart just yet.\n\nEthereum is still underperforming Bitcoin\n\nWhile the total staked ETH measured 24% of the circulating supply, its uptrend has slowed since December. It rose by only 600k ETH in the past two months, compared to the 1.6 million ETH it gained in the two months before then.\n\nAt the same time, the Ethereum on exchanges has declined. This downtrend has been in play since 2020. Combined with the increase in staked ETH, the inference was a strong confidence in ETH 2.0 in the market.\n\nEthereum also has a deflationary nature. The past year saw a -0.28% change in the Ethereum supply, according to data from YCharts. A recent report from AMBCrypto noted that the Bitcoin spot ETF approval news dented the active validators count.\n\nGlassnode data showed that the metric trended downward since the 3rd of January. However, it initiated a recovery on 16th of January. Before this dip, the metric had been in an uptrend since 2021 when Glassnode began gathering data for this metric.\n\nThe active addresses count appeared to plateau\n\nThe combination of falling exchange reserves, rising validators, and rising ETH staked pointed toward robust network security. The active addresses metric has also been in an uptrend since November 2023.\n\nHowever, the 7-day SMA saw a significant dip in the second half of January. This followed the sharp drop in prices ETH suffered, falling from $2.7k to $2.2k. The past five days saw the active addresses count rise once again.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024-25\n\nOverall, the metrics discussed here all point toward a large portion of users having a long-term bullish outlook on Ethereum, given their willingness to stake ETH.\n\nValidators are also incentivized to act positively. The network usage was growing and could drive further demand."

        "content": "Polygon, a layer-2 scaling network, nearly matched Ethereum\u2019s user base in 2023, as reported by blockchain analytics firm Flipside.\n\nPolygon acquired 15.24 million users that year, coming close to Ethereum\u2019s 15.4 million, with a difference of around 160,000 wallets.\n\nPolygon Topped User Acquisition in First Half of 2023\n\nFlipside defines an \u201cacquired\u201d user as someone who engaged in at least two transactions on a specific blockchain, with at least one occurring in 2023. During the first half of 2023, Polygon led the user acquisition race but was later surpassed by Ethereum, maintaining its lead throughout the latter part of the year.\n\nIs the bull is really here? How can we tell? Data. Sentiment isn\u2019t the only thing that\u2019s changed lately. According to the data, user behavior is shifting \u2014 and with it, crypto markets. We cover it all in The Onchain Crypto User Report \ud83e\uddf5\ud83d\udcca\ud83d\udc47 pic.twitter.com/IsclNOZhJk \u2014 Flipside \ud83d\udcca (@flipsidecrypto) January 25, 2024\n\nIn January, Polygon achieved a remarkable milestone with 2.8 million acquired users, constituting over 40% of the total number for 2023, according to Flipside. Ethereum secured the lead for the entire year, while Bitcoin claimed the third position with 10.65 million acquired users. Solana and Arbitrum completed the top five rankings.\n\nThe aggregated data from the eight tracked blockchains, including Optimism (OP), Avalanche (AVAX), and Base (BASE), revealed a total of 62 million acquired users. Flipside observed that user acquisition peaked in May but gradually declined afterward.\n\nNotably, Flipside suggested a connection between the surge in acquired users starting in March and the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank. The event potentially eroded confidence in centralized entities, prompting a shift towards decentralized custody alternatives.\n\nBase, launched in August, also exhibited a strong start, but its user volume dwindled in the final months of 2023. Flipside speculated that the waning user growth for Base might be attributed to renewed enthusiasm for more established chains towards the end of the year.\n\nFlipside Predicts Trends for 2024\n\nIn its predictions for future trends, Flipside observed a decline in NFT-related activities and a shift towards decentralized finance (DeFi) activities during 2023. Anticipating the upcoming cycle, Flipside suggested that DeFi activities would continue to dominate, surpassing the prominence of NFT trading.\n\nSpecifically, it highlighted decentralized exchange (DEX) trading and yield farming as ongoing predominant applications while also forecasting the emergence of new DeFi applications like the Ethereum restaking protocol Eigenlayer.\n\nAccording to Flipside, user behavior in 2024 is expected to involve increased interaction with multiple blockchain networks, although most users will likely stick to engaging with a single chain.\n\nThe prediction further emphasized a growing trend of user interaction with Layer 2 networks in the coming year.\n\nDespite being a minority in 2023, users with more than one blockchain predominantly interacted with Layer 2s. Flipside speculated that rising transaction fees during the next crypto market bull run could lead Layer 2 networks to lower their costs for end users competitively, potentially driving increased interest in associated governance tokens."

        "content": "The NUPL value has not dropped much despite the recent volatility.\n\nThe short-term market sentiment was in favor of the sellers.\n\nEthereum [ETH] prices fell to the $2.2k support level once again after the recent slash in prices. The Bitcoin [BTC] selling pressure meant altcoins suffered too.\n\nYet, AMBCrypto noted that the NUPL metric showed optimism over the past two months.\n\nThe Net Unrealized Profit/Loss is defined as the difference between Relative Unrealized Profit and Relative Unrealized Loss. It has slowly climbed higher since October 2023.\n\nUnderstanding the sentiment behind Ethereum\n\nThe NUPL reached 0.385 on the 11th of January. The last time that the NUPL of ETH was higher was back in May 2022, according to data from Glassnode.\n\nThe Unrealized Profit or Unrealized Loss is calculated by weighting each circulating ETH by the difference between its current price and realized price.\n\nRealized price refers to the price of the ETH when it was last moved.\n\nTheir difference has been useful in gauging the market cycle of Bitcoin and Ethereum in the past. Right now, the 0.385 value is a sign that the sentiment was optimistic in the macrocycle.\n\nA look at the short-term sentiment showed the opposite. The Weighted Sentiment data from Santiment stood near zero to show social media engagement didn\u2019t favor the bears or the bulls.\n\nThe Open Interest slid sharply on the 22nd and the 23rd of January, alongside the price of Ethereum. The OI had not yet recovered at press time.\n\nThe inference was that Futures participants preferred to remain sidelined as ETH traded near its $2.2k support zone.\n\nThe ETF approval caught many participants offside\n\nAfter the 11th of January, ETH has trended downward on the lower timeframe price charts (such as the 1-hour chart). Yet, from the 12th to the 22nd of January, the estimated leverage ratio climbed higher.\n\nHowever, it fell rapidly from 22nd to 24th January as prices nosedived.\n\nThis suggested that, while a good portion of speculators chose to remain sidelined (OI was falling slowly at that time) a large number also sought to increase leverage in the hopes of catching a breakout upward.\n\nAMBCrypto analyzed the estimated liquidation levels of ETH and found that the $2.3k mark was important yet again.\n\nThe Cumulative Liq Levels Delta was negative, meaning that short liquidations outweighed the long ones.\n\nHence, there is a better chance of a bounce in prices to liquidate these short sellers, than a bearish continuation over the next few days.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024-25\n\nTo the north, the $2310 level had close to $100 million in estimated liquidations. Many smaller liquidation levels were clustered around the $2.3k mark.\n\nTherefore, a bounce to the $2310-$2350 area has a good likelihood. Whether Ethereum will face a rejection from there or a bullish recovery remains to be seen."

IntoTheBlock attributed this to drop in market volatility, which made users less eager to have their transactions validated and bid up fees.\n\nAMBCrypto analyzed Santiment\u2019s data and spotted a significant reduction in Bitcoin\u2019s transaction count in the last seven days.\n\nIndeed, the daily transactions plummeted to just about 340,000 on the 25th of January, the lowest in three months, and 30% lower than a week before.\n\nOn top of this, the average transaction fees continued to slide throughout the month. From $15.83 on the 14th of January, the mean fees fell 70% to $4.58 at press time.\n\nThis indicators suggested that the congestion on the network was less, lending credence to the findings made earlier in this piece.\n\nMiners are not really worried\n\nInterestingly, the drop in transaction fees didn\u2019t seem to dent miners\u2019 pockets. The total miner earnings, which includes the fixed block rewards, spiked 35% in the last 10 days, as shown below.\n\nHowever, it should be noted that the daily miner revenue has plummeted significantly since December last year, during which inscriptions craze had taken over blockchains.\n\nWhat to expect from Bitcoin next?\n\nBitcoin ascended to $42,000 as the weekend started, the first such instance in more than a week, according to CoinMarketCap.\n\nWith this, the king coin\u2019s 24-hour gains surged to over 4%, reversing the losses made throughout the week.\n\nRead BTC\u2019s Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nSince the day spot ETFs got regulatory approval to trade in the U.S., Bitcoin, ironically, has lost 14.5% of its value.\n\nWhile much of the blame went to outflows from Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF, a recent report by CoinShares held macroeconomic factors equally responsible for the downturn."

Bitcoin (BTC) owners increased by 33%, rising from 222 million in January to 296 million by December, representing 51% of global cryptocurrency owners. Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) saw an even more significant rise of 39%, growing from 89 million owners at the start of the year to 124 million by the end, accounting for 21% of the global total.\n\nThe report attributes Bitcoin\u2019s adoption growth primarily to Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the introduction of the Bitcoin Ordinals protocol. This protocol has enabled the minting of both non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and fungible tokens directly on the Bitcoin network, marking a significant advancement in the cryptocurrency\u2019s capabilities and appeal.\n\nIt says :\n\n\u201cStrong interest from institutional investors also contributed to the increase in BTC\u2019s adoption.\u201d\n\nEthereum Adoption Boosted by Liquid Staking Post-Shanghai Upgrade\n\nThe report highlights Ethereum\u2019s significant adoption growth , attributing it largely to the advancements in liquid staking following the Shanghai Upgrade. This upgrade enabled the withdrawals of staked ETH, marking Ethereum\u2019s transition to a Proof of Stake (PoS) blockchain. This development has been a key factor in driving Ethereum\u2019s increased adoption.\n\nThe prices of BTC and ETH saw a substantial rise, with BTC momentarily hitting the $44,000 mark and ETH reaching around $2,400. Concurrently, there was a significant surge in popularity for BRC-20 tokens and inscriptions, drawing in a wide variety of investors and crypto enthusiasts.\n\n\ud83d\udea8SOLD OUT!!\ud83d\udea8 Natively Digital: An Ordinal Curated sale smashed the pre sale estimates ! \u2013 Total: $1,097,000 (26 BTC)\n\n(Double the pre sale low estimate)\n\n\u2013 100% of lots sold\n\n\u2013 641 bids\n\n\u2013 95 bidders and buyers\n\n\u2013 Half of the sale sold for over their high estimates Congrats to\u2026 pic.twitter.com/jEMgMUtajl \u2014 Michael Bouhanna (@michaelbouhanna) January 22, 2024\n\nAdditionally, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) gave the green light to 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs on January 10, including a noteworthy conversion of Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin trust (GBTC) into an ETF.

Ethereum (ETH) also clocked significant losses over the week but has now managed to neutralize its position.\n\nOn Saturday, Bitcoin\u2019s price stood at a level close to $42,200, marking a daily increase of 1% as per CoinGlass data. The trading volume in crypto derivatives dropped significantly, down 55% to $21.50 billion. Despite this, Bitcoin\u2019s total market value stayed at $828.78 billion, with open interest (OI) for Bitcoin reported at $17.98 billion. 24-hour liquidations surpassed $13.37 million, indicating sell pressure.\n\nadvertisement\n\nIn comparison, Ethereum was priced close to $2,280, with a modest daily increase. The amount traded fell by nearly 50% to $8.44 billion, while its total market value was $275.03 billion. Ethereum\u2019s OI stood at $7.79 billion, with liquidations totaling $4.35 million.\n\nBTC vs ETH: Key metrics analysis\n\nIntoTheBlock\u2019s metrics reveal insightful details about the two cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin\u2019s large transaction volume decreased by 39.08% to $25.93 billion, indicating a decrease in high-value transactions. Daily active addresses increased by 7.76% to 979,300, reflecting a rise in user activity. The holder\u2019s balance slightly rose to $581.26 billion. Notably, exchange netflows saw a significant drop of 129.87% and touched negative $71.71 million. The whale participation rate stood at 2.31%. Currently, 82.45% of Bitcoin holders are \u2018in the money,\u2019 showing a positive investment return.\n\nFor Ethereum, the large transaction volume also decreased by 49.58% to $2.14 billion. Daily active addresses were at 595,640, up by 9.94%. Ethereum\u2019s holder\u2019s balance increased to $218.04 billion. Exchange netflows showed a dramatic decrease of 405.1% and touched negative $96.24 million. Ethereum whale participation rate was significantly higher at 36.89%, with 71.70% of holders \u2018in the money.\u2019\n\nBoth Bitcoin and Ethereum are experiencing a decline in large transaction volumes, which implies a relatively reduced trading interest from investors. The negative exchange netflows for both suggest that users are moving their holdings out of exchanges.\n\nIntoTheBlock also noted that Bitcoin and Ethereum saw over a 30% decrease in transaction fees, attributed to reduced market volatility and less urgent need for transactions among users.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum fees declined over 30% as market volatility decreased, leading to relatively less urgency amongst users transacting pic.twitter.com/Bk3Wd1SblY \u2014 IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) January 26, 2024\n\nWhat are analysts betting on?\n\nCrypto analyst Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe recently said in a post on X, \u201cI personally believe that #Ethereum is going to outperform #Bitcoin in the upcoming period and it has started since the ETF approval.\u201d\n\nHe pointed out a \u2018massive weekly bullish divergence\u2019 and crucial resistance at 0.06 BTC.

This makes it different from other platforms. With a platform like Binance, you can only trade cryptocurrencies. On Pullix, you can trade all asset classes (Forex, gold, cryptos, etc.) on one account.\n\nBehind the trading services is the PLX native token. Holding this token reduces trading fees and access to specific assets. The remarkable thing about this altcoin is its \u201cTrade-to-Earn\u201d revenue-sharing model. To clarify, just staking PLX will earn users a portion of the daily revenue made by Pullix.\n\nEach PLX token is now valued at $0.10, a 100% ROI if you bought it early. Its long-term growth is excellent thanks to its ties to the OTC derivatives market, which BIS valued at $20.7T in 2022. Market analysts predict that once PLX hits major exchanges in Q1 2024, its value will spike by 100x.\n\nSolana (SOL) Introduces Token Extensions\n\nMeanwhile, Solana (SOL) has introduced token extensions. This is a groundbreaking implementation of complicated pre-built token functionality on the blockchain. Developers can now build their tokens with the extension matching unique needs.\n\nThis exciting Solana news raised interest in this altcoin. On the price charts, SOL has fluctuated between $98.23 and $87.10 in the past week alone. During that time, its market cap has also moved between $42.52B and $37.27B. With the bullish Solana crypto sentiment, market analysts forecast a potential pump to $101.37 before February 2024 ends.\n\nMicha\u00ebl Van De Poppe With a Bullish Ethereum Price Prediction\n\nCrypto analyst Micha\u00ebl Van De Poppe recently predicted a bullish Ethereum (ETH) price. According to his new tweet, Ethereum\u2019s momentum may come in the next few weeks. This rally may be due to the Ethereum ETF hype and Bitcoin\u2019s bottoming out.\n\nThe Ethereum price has fluctuated widely this past week. On both ends, it moved from $2,504 to $2,204. The same goes for market cap, which jumped to $301B just to dip to $264B later. Market analysts foresee the Ethereum crypto soaring to $2,358 within Q1 of 2024.\n\nWill Pullix Outpace Solana and Ethereum?\n\nAt just $20M, Pullix\u2019s early-stage market cap is much smaller than Solana and Ethereum\u2019s. With such a head start, Pullix could surge ahead of them and reach unimaginable heights without needing as much cash. A low market cap plus groundbreaking features make Pullix one of the top altcoins to watch.\n\nFor more information regarding Pullix\u2019s presale see links below:\n\nVisit Pullix\n\nJoin The Pullix Communities\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

Look at all the prior examples\u2026 So at some point, I think Ethereum will test the integrity of that low, back down below $1,000. But, history would also suggest that it won't test it until after ETH/BTC breaks down. And history also suggests that ETH/BTC probably won't break down in January because normally January is a good month for Ethereum.\"\n\nOn-chain analytics firm Santiment reported that Bitcoin has surpassed the $42K mark, while altcoins have not yet followed suit.

        "content": "Polygon Labs is introducing a potential solution to the Ethereum blockchain's fragmentation issues. In February, the L2 Ethereum scaling solution plans to launch AggLayer - a decentralized protocol that relies on zk-proofs to unite different blockchains into one single layer of usability.\n\nAggLayer is central to the development team's vision of making Ethereum as easy to navigate and engage with as the everyday internet, to encourage the general public to get on board with Web3. To achieve this, the user experience has to be greatly improved from its current state.\n\nIn the last couple of years, the fast pace of development in the sector has led to many improvements in UX, but these have also introduced new challenges.\n\nA modular blockchain architecture has allowed the ecosystem to surpass the scalability issues of the first monolithic chains. However, their proliferation has created a deeply fragmented ecosystem, where users and liquidity are separated on their own individual chains.\n\nThe purpose of AggLayer is to create an \"environment that feels like a single chain\" for end users to seamlessly transact and move between dApps built on different chains. As Polygon state, \"There will be no mass adoption with siloed liquidity and users.\"\n\nDevelopers will also benefit, as using the protocol will allow them to attract users regardless of where they choose to build their projects. Additionally, as the proposal eliminates the need for complicated bridging schemes, individual chains will be able to maintain their full sovereignty.\n\nIn this way, the protocol is hoping to enable \"near-instant, atomic transactions, unifies liquidity across the ecosystem, creates capital efficiency, and dramatically improves UX.\"\n\nPolygon Labs is just one of the development teams trying to solve the fragmented liquidity issue. Also this week, Ethereum Layer 2 protocol Polymer announced its plans to integrate the Cosmos Inter Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol into the Ethereum ecosystem to allow for cross-chain dApps on the blockchain.\n\nPolygon's vision will likely gain more traction as the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) chain has a much larger user base. According to blockchain analytics firm Flipside, in 2023, Polygon acquired 15.4 million users.\n\nAlmost 40% of these new users joined the chain in January, followed by a steady decline in monthly user acquisition. However, the L2 solution was still the blockchain that gained the second most users in the industry, just 160,000 users less than Ethereum and almost 5 million more than Bitcoin.\n\n'Aggregation Day', planned for next month, will open the way for more users to join the network and, by doing so, take the vision of a united and uniform Web3 forwards."

        "title": "Spot Bitcoin ETF flows show Negative Trend since launch as Ethereum Options out of Sync with Bullish sentiment - Tekedia",
        "content": "The spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) launched by ProShares in October 2021 has seen its first net outflow of funds since its inception, according to data from ETF.com. The fund, which trades under the ticker BITO, had a net outflow of $12.6 million on January 25, 2024, bringing its total assets under management (AUM) to $1.18 billion.\n\nThis marks the first time that BITO has experienced a negative trend in its daily flows, which measure the net amount of money moving in or out of the fund. Since its launch, BITO has attracted significant investor interest, becoming the fastest ETF to reach $1 billion in AUM in just two days.\n\nBITO tracks the price of Bitcoin using futures contracts traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), which are settled in cash and not in actual Bitcoin.\n\nThe negative flow for BITO coincides with a sharp drop in the price of Bitcoin, which fell below $30,000 for the first time since July 2021 on January 25. The cryptocurrency market has been under pressure from regulatory uncertainty, environmental concerns, and competition from other digital assets.\n\nSome analysts have also suggested that the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs, which allow investors to gain exposure to the actual Bitcoin rather than futures contracts, may have reduced the demand for BITO and other futures-based ETFs.\n\nHowever, not all spot Bitcoin ETFs have fared well either. The Valkyrie Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BTF), which launched on January 3, 2024, as the first spot Bitcoin ETF in the U.S., has also seen a net outflow of $3.4 million on January 25, bringing its AUM to $69.4 million. The fund, which trades under the ticker BTF, holds Bitcoin in a trust and charges a 0.9% expense ratio.\n\nThe only spot Bitcoin ETF that has seen a positive flow on January 25 is the VanEck Bitcoin Trust (XBTF), which launched on January 5, 2024, as the second spot Bitcoin ETF in the U.S. The fund, which trades under the ticker XBTF, had a net inflow of $2.7 million on January 25, increasing its AUM to $32.7 million. The fund also holds Bitcoin in a trust and charges a 0.65% expense ratio.\n\nThe performance of the three spot Bitcoin ETFs may indicate that investors are more sensitive to fees and brand recognition when choosing which fund to invest in. VanEck is a well-known name in the ETF industry, having launched several successful funds in the past, such as the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (GDX) and the VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH). Valkyrie and ProShares are relatively new entrants in the ETF space and may have to compete harder to attract and retain investors.\n\nThe future of Bitcoin ETFs remains uncertain, as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has yet to approve any ETF that directly tracks the price of Bitcoin using physical custody or a decentralized network. The SEC has expressed concerns about the potential for fraud, manipulation, and theft in the Bitcoin market, and has asked for more public input on how to address these issues.\n\nUntil then, investors who want to gain exposure to Bitcoin through an ETF will have to choose between futures-based or trust-based funds, each with their own advantages and disadvantages.\n\nEthereum Options out of Sync with Bullish sentiment\n\nEther, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has been on a tear lately, reaching new all-time highs and outperforming bitcoin in terms of percentage gains. However, the options market seems to be lagging behind the bullish momentum, as implied volatility and skew indicators suggest a lack of enthusiasm among traders.\n\nImplied volatility (IV) is a measure of how much the market expects the price of an asset to move in the future. It is derived from the prices of options contracts, which give the buyer the right but not the obligation to buy or sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price and date. The higher the IV, the more expensive the options and the greater the expected price fluctuations.\n\nSkew is a measure of how much the options market favors one direction over another. It is calculated by comparing the IV of out-of-the-money (OTM) calls and puts, which are options that have strike prices above or below the current market price, respectively. A positive skew means that OTM calls have higher IV than OTM puts, indicating a higher demand for bullish bets. A negative skew means that OTM puts have higher IV than OTM calls, indicating a higher demand for bearish bets.\n\nAccording to data from Skew, the one-month IV for ether options has dropped to 86%, the lowest level since October 2020. This implies that the options market is not expecting any major price movements in ether in the next 30 days, despite the recent rally and the upcoming launch of Ethereum 2.0, which is expected to improve the network\u2019s scalability and security.\n\nMoreover, the one-month skew for ether options has turned negative, reaching -7%, the lowest level since November 2020. This means that OTM puts are more expensive than OTM calls, indicating a higher demand for downside protection than upside speculation.\n\nThese indicators suggest that ether options traders are either taking profits after the rally, hedging their long positions against a possible correction, or simply waiting for more clarity on the direction of the market. In contrast, spot and futures markets are showing more bullish signs, as ether\u2019s price and open interest continue to climb to new highs.\n\nOne possible explanation for this divergence is that options traders are more cautious and rational than spot and futures traders, who may be driven by emotions and FOMO (fear of missing out). Another possibility is that options traders are underestimating the potential of ether and Ethereum 2.0 and are missing out on a rare opportunity to profit from a paradigm shift in the crypto space.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nWhatsApp\n\nLinkedIn\n\nEmail\n\nPrint\n\n"

        "title": "Ethereum Staking Provider Dumps Geth For Besu As Client Decentralization Race Heats Up - CryptoDaily",
        "content": "Table of Contents\n\nIn a move towards a more diversified Ethereum execution client ecosystem, AllNodes, a staking provider, has announced its complete transition from Geth to Besu. With this shift, AllNodes has eliminated the use of Geth across its entire network of 23,895 nodes, marking a milestone in the ongoing efforts to reduce the current centralization around Geth, a majority client.\n\nAllNodes Migrates To Besu\n\nIn a post on X, the non-custodial staking provider said the decision is a testament to the growing recognition of the need for a more robust and decentralized Ethereum ecosystem. Though Geth is the most widely used execution client for Ethereum nodes, analysts are concerned about its dominance and potential security vulnerabilities should it fall prey to a bug.\n\nThe transition to Besu aligns with AllNodes\u2019 commitment to providing its clients with the most secure and reliable staking infrastructure. Besu, developed by ConsenSys, is a highly performant and secure execution client offering several advantages over Geth.\n\nThis development significantly boosts its decentralization efforts for Rocket Pool, an Ethereum staking protocol that utilizes mini pools. Rocket Pool\u2019s mini pool operators are free to leverage AllNodes\u2019 staking and node hosting services. Even if some of Rocket Pool\u2019s mini-pool operators still use Geth, the decision by AllNodes to switch to Besu further strengthens Ethereum\u2019s resilience against potential client-side failures.\n\nThe current landscape of Ethereum validators still heavily favors Geth. Data from Client Diversity shows that over 75% of all validators rely on this client. However, in light of the current realization that client failures can negatively impact the network\u2019s stability, more staking providers will likely diversify their base with others following AllNodes. If more validators are spread across Nethermind, Geth, Besu, and other clients, Ethereum will become more resistant to potential forks and security issues.\n\nNo Bailouts For Ethereum Node Operators If Geth Fails\n\nOne analyst on X, Marius, explained that anyone can use any client, even gravitating to the first and popular Ethereum execution client, Geth. However, the analyst insists there will be no \u201cbailouts\u201d if the network forks.\n\nA buggy Geth will inevitably expose validators to the risk of catastrophic losses, triggering a network fork since it already controls over 66% of nodes needed for finality. Validators running that client could face slashing penalties of up to 32 ETH, effectively wiping out their stake.\n\nThe Ethereum network usually \u201cslashes\u201d the stake of validator nodes should their reliability drop below 100%. The longer they are offline, the higher the slashing penalty."

        "title": "Ethereum Gas Fees: Challenges and Solutions in 2024 - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "Navigating Ethereum Gas Fees: Challenges and Solutions in the Year 2024\n\nEthereum, a pioneering blockchain platform, has long faced challenges with gas fees\u2014the transaction fees required to execute operations on the network. In 2024, the issues surrounding Ethereum gas fees persist, impacting user experience and hindering broader adoption. This article delves into the challenges posed by Ethereum gas fees and explores potential solutions that could shape the landscape of transaction costs on the Ethereum network.\n\nThe Challenge of High Gas Fees:\n\nEthereum\u2019s popularity has led to increased congestion on its network, resulting in elevated gas fees. Users, developers, and businesses face the dilemma of high transaction costs, which can make certain operations economically unfeasible and deter potential users from engaging with decentralized applications (DApps).\n\nImpact on Decentralized Finance (DeFi):\n\nDecentralized Finance, a prominent sector on the Ethereum network, has been significantly impacted by soaring gas fees. DeFi transactions, which include activities like lending, trading, and yield farming, often incur substantial costs, limiting accessibility and participation.\n\nScalability Solutions:\n\nEthereum 2.0, an ambitious upgrade to Ethereum, aims to address scalability challenges through the transition from Proof of Work (PoW) to Proof of Stake (PoS). While this transition is ongoing, layer 2 scaling solutions such as Optimistic Rollups and zk-Rollups are being implemented to alleviate congestion and reduce gas fees.\n\nOptimistic Rollups:\n\nOptimistic Rollups are layer 2 scaling solutions that allow for faster and cheaper transactions by processing most transactions off-chain and then submitting a summary to the Ethereum mainnet. This approach aims to maintain security while significantly reducing gas fees.\n\nzk-Rollups:\n\nZero-Knowledge Rollups, or zk-Rollups, utilize advanced cryptographic techniques to bundle multiple transactions into a single proof, which is then submitted to the Ethereum mainnet. This approach enhances scalability and reduces gas fees while preserving a high level of security.\n\nEIP-1559 and Fee Burn Mechanism:\n\nEthereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 1559 is another significant upgrade designed to improve the user experience and address gas fee concerns. EIP-1559 introduces a fee burn mechanism that aims to make gas fees more predictable by adjusting the supply of Ethereum based on network demand.\n\nUser Education and Optimization:\n\nEducating users on gas fee optimization strategies is crucial. Implementing tools and practices such as choosing optimal transaction times, utilizing gas fee prediction platforms, and leveraging wallet features for fee adjustments can empower users to navigate Ethereum\u2019s fee landscape more effectively.\n\nConclusion:\n\nAs Ethereum continues to evolve, addressing the challenges posed by gas fees remains a top priority. The ongoing development of Ethereum 2.0, the implementation of layer 2 scaling solutions, and the introduction of EIP-1559 are promising steps toward creating a more scalable, efficient, and user-friendly Ethereum network. Navigating the challenges of gas fees in 2024 requires a collaborative effort from developers, users, and the broader Ethereum community to foster a sustainable and inclusive blockchain ecosystem.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Ethereum Price Could Plunge Below $1000 In Coming Months, Warns Crypto Analyst Benjamin Cowen - CryptoGlobe",
        "content": "In a recent video, crypto analyst Benjamin Cowen discussed several key points regarding Ethereum (ETH) and its potential future movements, particularly in relation to Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nHere are the main highlights:\n\nEthereum\u2019s Performance Relative to Bitcoin: Cowen notes that the future direction of Ethereum (ETH) is closely tied to its performance relative to Bitcoin. He points out that if Bitcoin were to experience a significant bounce, it would likely impact Ethereum\u2019s value in USD. However, a key factor to watch is how Ethereum performs against Bitcoin during this period. Historical Price Patterns of Ethereum: Cowen references past cycles to speculate on Ethereum\u2019s potential future movements. He observes that Ethereum has historically followed a pattern of forming a low, then higher lows, before eventually breaking down. This pattern suggests that Ethereum might test the integrity of its previous lows before potentially experiencing a larger drop. Implications of Ethereum-Bitcoin (ETH/BTC) Pair: According to Cowen, the ETH/BTC pair is critical in determining Ethereum\u2019s future. He suggests that if this pair breaks down, it would precede a significant drop in Ethereum\u2019s USD value. This pattern has been observed in previous cycles where a breakdown in the ETH/BTC pair led to substantial corrections in Ethereum\u2019s USD value. Testing of Previous Lows: Cowen speculates that Ethereum will likely test its previous lows below $1,000, but this might not happen until after the ETH/BTC pair breaks down. He emphasizes the historical tendency of Ethereum to retest its low points before any substantial recovery or further decline. Possible Scenarios for Ethereum\u2019s Movement: Cowen discusses various scenarios for Ethereum\u2019s movement in the coming months. He considers the possibility of Ethereum experiencing a slow bleed in value or receiving one more significant push higher, similar to a past movement that saw a substantial increase in its value. Influence of Bitcoin\u2019s Movements: Cowen argues that any significant upward movement in Ethereum\u2019s value is contingent on Bitcoin experiencing a bounce first. He stresses that Ethereum\u2019s future movements are heavily influenced by Bitcoin\u2019s market behavior. Uncertainty and Market Dynamics: Cowen acknowledges the uncertainty in these predictions, highlighting the complexity of market dynamics and the influence of various narratives, such as those around the Ethereum spot ETF and Bitcoin halving.\n\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at around $2,257, down 0.33% in the past 24-hour period.\n\nFeatured Image via Pixabay"

        "title": "Ethereum has a better alternative and it's just $0.09 Now - Cryptopolitan",
        "content": "In the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrency, innovation and progress are constant companions. Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has long been a dominant force in the blockchain space. However, competition and advancement within the crypto industry have led to the emergence of alternatives that challenge Ethereum\u2019s supremacy. One such compelling alternative is Retik Finance (RETIK), and what makes it even more enticing is its incredibly affordable price tag of just $0.09. In this article, we\u2019ll delve into the world of Retik Finance, exploring its features, current status, and why it stands as a promising Ethereum alternative.\n\nRetik Finance: A Closer Look\n\nRetik Finance is not just any cryptocurrency; it represents a new generation of decentralised finance (DeFi) platforms designed to revolutionise the way we think about traditional financial systems. At its core, Retik Finance aims to bridge the gap between digital and fiat finance, providing users with a seamless and efficient platform for conducting financial transactions.\n\nBut what sets Retik Finance apart from its competitors, and why is it being hailed as an Ethereum alternative?\n\n1. Innovative Ecosystem: Retik Finance has created a comprehensive DeFi ecosystem that goes beyond the typical offerings of many cryptocurrencies. This ecosystem includes the Retik Wallet, DeFi Debit Cards, and Retik Pay, all of which are designed to enhance the user experience by facilitating easy and secure transactions. By leveraging the power of blockchain technology, Retik Finance aims to address the shortcomings of traditional financial systems.\n\n2. The $RETIK Token: At the heart of Retik Finance\u2019s ecosystem lies the $RETIK token, a digital currency that serves as the lifeblood of the platform. However, its utility extends beyond the Retik Finance ecosystem, making it a versatile and attractive investment option for crypto enthusiasts. With a limited supply and growing demand, the $RETIK token has the potential for significant price appreciation.\n\n3. Strong Community Support: Like any successful cryptocurrency, Retik Finance has garnered a dedicated community of supporters who believe in its vision. Community engagement and support are crucial in the crypto world, and Retik Finance has demonstrated its ability to rally enthusiasts around its cause.\n\nRetik Finance: Current Status\n\nAs of the time of writing, Retik Finance finds itself in an exciting stage of its development: Retik Presale Stage 7. During this stage, one RETIK token is priced at a mere $0.09, making it incredibly accessible to a wide range of investors. However, the affordability of RETIK does not diminish its potential; quite the opposite.The Retik Presale Stage 7 is 84.57% filled, indicating strong interest and demand within the crypto community. This level of participation underscores the project\u2019s viability and the belief that RETIK Finance has something valuable to offer. In terms of fundraising, the stage has raised an impressive $13,537,209 out of the $17,200,000 target, indicating that there is substantial backing for the project.In terms of token availability, 224,120,023 RETIK tokens have already been sold during this stage, out of a total supply of 265,000,000. This indicates that there is still room for interested investors to participate in the presale and secure their RETIK tokens at the current attractive price.\n\nWhy RETIK Finance Stands Out\n\n1. Affordability: One of the most striking aspects of RETIK Finance is its affordability. With each token priced at just $0.09 during the Retik Presale Stage 7, it opens the door for a broad spectrum of investors, from newcomers to seasoned traders. This accessibility is a stark contrast to Ethereum, which has seen its price rise significantly over the years, potentially pricing out some prospective investors.\n\n2. Innovation: RETIK Finance\u2019s innovative approach to DeFi and its comprehensive ecosystem set it apart from many other cryptocurrencies. While Ethereum laid the foundation for smart contracts and dApps, RETIK Finance takes these concepts to the next level by offering a complete financial solution that can seamlessly integrate with traditional finance.\n\n3. Growing Community: The enthusiastic and growing community supporting RETIK Finance bodes well for its future. A strong and engaged user base can contribute significantly to a project\u2019s success, and RETIK Finance has managed to cultivate just that.\n\nConclusion\n\nEthereum has long been a frontrunner in the cryptocurrency space, but the emergence of alternatives like Retik Finance (RETIK) is a testament to the dynamism and innovation of the crypto industry. With its affordable price of $0.09 during the Retik Presale Stage 7, Retik Finance offers accessibility and potential that could rival Ethereum.As the crypto landscape continues to evolve, it\u2019s essential to keep an eye on projects like RETIK Finance that bring fresh ideas and solutions to the table. While Ethereum has its merits, the allure of an Ethereum alternative that combines affordability, innovation, and a growing community cannot be ignored. As the crypto journey unfolds, RETIK Finance is a name to watch, and its current status in the Retik Presale Stage 7 only adds to its appeal as a promising Ethereum alternative.\n\nClick Here To Take Part In Retik Finance Presale\n\nVisit the links below for more information about Retik Finance (RETIK):\n\nWebsite: https://retik.com\n\nWhitepaper: https://retik.com/retik-whitepaper.pdf\n\nLinktree: https://linktr.ee/retikfinance"

        "title": "U.S. SEC Set to Approve Spot Ethereum ETFs, Predicts Yield App's Lucas Kiely - CryptoGlobe",
        "content": "Lucas Kiely, the Chief Investment Officer for Yield App, shared his insights on the potential approval of spot Ethereum (ETH) Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in an opinion piece published by Cointelegraph on 23 January 2024. His perspective comes from a background of extensive experience in investment portfolio management and a deep understanding of the crypto market.\n\nKiely began by acknowledging the recent approval of a Bitcoin spot ETF, a development that was long-awaited and somewhat unexpected in the industry. He then shifted focus to the next significant milestone for the crypto market: the approval of an Ether spot ETF. Contrary to the prolonged and contentious process that surrounded the Bitcoin ETF, Kiely believes the approval of an ETH spot ETF is not only certain but imminent.\n\nHe criticized the SEC\u2019s past denials of Bitcoin ETF applications, which he attributed to prejudice against Bitcoin. This prejudice, according to Kiely, was finally overcome due to Greyscale\u2019s lawsuit. He referenced Commissioner Hester Peirce\u2019s critique of the SEC\u2019s handling of these approvals, noting that the denials never made sense and eroded trust in the SEC. Peirce\u2019s comments highlighted the unnecessary complexity and \u201ccircus\u201d surrounding crypto products, which Kiely believes will not be the case with an Ether ETF.\n\nKiely said that there are currently seven ETH spot ETF applications on the SEC\u2019s desk, with VanEck\u2019s application being the first in line with a deadline of 23 May 2024. Kiely pointed out that the SEC has already instituted proceedings on VanEck\u2019s applications, making it difficult for the regulator to find a reason for denial without affecting other pending applications. This situation, he argues, is why the market is confident about an approval in May.\n\nKiely also mentioned that the approval of an ETH product would pave the way for a variety of crypto-backed or linked Exchange-Traded Products (ETPs), from spot products to more complex instruments. He acknowledged that liquidity might be the only potential obstacle for an ETH spot ETF approval. He mentioned that Ethereum\u2019s move to proof-of-stake has constrained the supply of ETH, and unlike Bitcoin, which is used mainly as a store of value, ETH is a working currency used for transactions on its chain. However, Kiely views this concern as a long shot and not significantly different from liquidity issues in equity markets.\n\nHe concluded by stating that the delay in approving a Bitcoin ETF was due to politics and the SEC\u2019s uncertainty about embracing this new asset class. With the approval of the spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S., he believes that cryptocurrency has not only entered traditional finance (TradFi) but is now firmly established within it. Kiely anticipates not just the approval of a spot ETH ETF but a full-scale institutional colonization of the cryptocurrency industry.\n\nFeatured Image via Pixabay"

        "title": "Cryptocurrency Market Update: Ethereum, Bitcoin, and Shiba Inu Face Critical Junctures - The Currency Analytics",
        "content": "In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency, investors and enthusiasts are closely monitoring the movements of Ethereum, Bitcoin, and Shiba Inu as these digital assets navigate critical junctures in the market. Recent price fluctuations and technical indicators signal potential shifts in momentum, prompting speculation and caution among traders worldwide.\n\nEthereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, finds itself at a pivotal moment as it grapples with key support levels and market sentiment. The 26-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), a crucial indicator of short-term momentum, is currently under scrutiny. A breach of this level could see Ethereum\u2019s value dip to $2,347, potentially triggering a more pronounced decline. With buying pressure showing signs of weakening, investors are closely monitoring Ethereum\u2019s ability to reclaim bullish momentum and overcome resistance levels, particularly the recent high of $2,547.6.\n\nDespite the rise of layer 2 networks aimed at enhancing scalability and efficiency, Ethereum\u2019s trajectory reflects subdued market energy, contributing to cautious trading sentiments among investors. Additional support and resistance zones provide further insight into potential price movements, with $2,175.2 and $2,000 emerging as critical support levels in the event of a downturn.\n\nBitcoin, the pioneer cryptocurrency, faces its own set of challenges as it hovers near the critical $40,000 mark. The loss of support at the 50-day Exponential Moving Average signals a potential shift in sentiment, with the 100-day EMA offering a tentative foothold for price stability. However, market liquidity remains a concern, hindering Bitcoin\u2019s ability to mount a strong rebound. Resistance at $42,786 presents a significant hurdle for Bitcoin\u2019s recovery, highlighting the importance of monitoring key support levels, notably $35,888, in the event of further downward pressure.\n\nShiba Inu, a meme-inspired token, grapples with its own market dynamics amid a challenging landscape characterized by low liquidity and lack of growth catalysts. Current trading patterns suggest a delicate balance between bullish and bearish sentiment, with support at $0.000027 and $0.000022 offering potential accumulation points for buyers. Resistance at $0.000035 presents a formidable challenge for Shiba Inu\u2019s upward trajectory, emphasizing the need for vigilance and strategic decision-making among investors.\n\nAs the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve and adapt to changing dynamics, staying informed about price movements, technical indicators, and market sentiment is essential for investors and traders alike. Whether Ethereum, Bitcoin, or Shiba Inu, each digital asset faces its own set of challenges and opportunities, shaping the broader landscape of the crypto market.\n\nDespite the challenging market landscape, there\u2019s a glimmer of hope for Shiba Inu. The descending trading volume accompanying its price consolidation hints at a potential waning of bearish momentum. This slowdown often precedes a stabilization or even a reversal if bullish forces take control.\n\nCurrently finding support around $0.000027, Shiba Inu faces a critical test. If this level fails, the next support zone lies near $0.000022, potentially offering a new accumulation point for buyers. On the resistance side, breaking the $0.000035 barrier could pave the way for a retest of higher levels, possibly around $0.000040.\n\nInvestors in Shiba Inu are advised to closely monitor these price levels, as they could provide insights into the token\u2019s short-term trajectory and potential opportunities for traders.\n\nIn conclusion, navigating the cryptocurrency market requires diligence, patience, and a keen understanding of market trends. As Ethereum, Bitcoin, and Shiba Inu navigate critical junctures, investors are advised to exercise caution, conduct thorough research, and stay informed to"

        "content": "SPONSORED POST*\n\nSolana (SOL) was one of the best cryptos to invest in last year, delivering investors over 300% returns. Its prices have dropped considerably since the start of 2024, going from a high of $125 set on Christmas Day to its current price of $86.\n\nHowever, strong support was found at $76 and strong bull patterns have been forming on price charts ever since. A prominent trader who goes by the nickname Bluntz Capital predicts prices will surge by 40% soon.\n\nMeanwhile, an increasing number of Ethereum (ETH) whales are gravitating toward one of the best DeFi altcoins launched on its network: InQubeta (QUBE).\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause InQubeta is on course to earn investors substantially more profits as it opens access to artificial intelligence (AI) investments to people who don\u2019t meet the requisites of traditional avenues and those who don\u2019t have access to them.\n\nQUBE, InQubeta\u2019s governance and native token, has outperformed ETH in the past twelve months, earning investors 220% returns, while ETH only delivered 37% returns to its investors.\n\nAnalysts project InQubeta (QUBE) will be more profitable than investing in BTC ETFs or ETH\n\nThe artificial intelligence industry has passed major milestones in the past couple of decades, taking the technology from a fancy science fiction concept to a reality. Self-driving taxis now exist and humanoid robots are closer than ever to replacing human laborers. InQubeta aims to democratize access to investing in the AI startups that are pushing these changes.\n\nTraditional investing channels usually have income or net worth requirements that disqualify a large portion of the global population from using their services, but InQubeta uses a crowdfunding approach where everyone is welcome.\n\nAI investments have surged considerably in the past several years, from a mere $12 billion in 2015 to more than $120 billion at present. That figure is anticipated to exceed $1.5 trillion by 2030. InQubeta is the first DeFi crypto coin to focus on making AI investments easier to access, which sets it up for exponential growth as it connects AI startups with financiers.\n\nHere\u2019s how the decentralized investment ecosystem works:\n\nAI startups that are eligible to raise capital on the network create ERC20 coins that offer rewards or equity. Rewards might be in the form of discounts on products created or a share of profits made\n\nthat offer rewards or equity. Rewards might be in the form of discounts on products created or a share of profits made ERC20 coins , non-fungible tokens, are split into thousands of smaller pieces that are more affordable for most investors\n\n, non-fungible tokens, are split into thousands of smaller pieces that are more affordable for most investors Investors are provided resources that include information on the different companies seeking capital and expert opinions. They finance companies they find promising with QUBE\n\nThey can resell any tokens they purchase on the marketplace at any time of their choosing\n\nSolana (SOL) prices poised for 40% surge\n\nSOL prices have come down quite a bit since they broke the $125 resistance level, but analysts like Bluntz Capital expect prices to rebound soon. Solana was one of the best DeFi coins in 2023, and it emerged as the Ethereum network\u2019s main competitor after its market cap surpassed rivals like Cardano (ADA).\n\nSolana\u2019s exponential growth has been attributed to its consistent efforts to expand the services it offers and its growing user base. SOL tokens are probably as cheap as they\u2019re going to be right now.\n\nThe improvements made to the Solana blockchain in 2023 earned attention from notable personalities in the investing space, including Franklin Templeton CEO, Jenny Johnson.\n\nSummary\n\nQUBE and SOL are two of the best cryptocurrencies to invest in today. SOL appears poised to surge and it could grow as much as 3x this year. QUBE is set for 37.5% more growth before tokens are released on exchanges, and some projections expect prices to surge as much as 10,000% afterward.\n\nVisit InQubeta Presale\n\nJoin The InQubeta Communities\n\n*This article was paid for.

        "content": "The Ethereum blockchain experienced a moment where something that didn\u2019t go terribly wrong became a hot topic.\n\nA bug in Ethereum\u2019s client software Nethermind, used by blockchain validators to interact with the network, brought down most of the chain\u2019s major operators on January 21st.\n\nWhile a manageable incident, the incident reignited a long-running debate in the Ethereum ecosystem about the need for \u201cclient diversity.\u201d\n\nSome experts took the opportunity to point out how much worse the situation could have been if the Ethereum chain\u2019s most popular execution client software, Geth, had been shut down.\n\nGeth could become a single point of failure for the network, raising questions about Ethereum\u2019s ability to continue.\n\nNethermind is used by about 8% of Ethereum validators, and the recent bug was severe enough to take many of these validators offline.\n\nThe Ethereum blockchain continued to operate despite the issue, and Nethermind developers released a patch within hours.\n\nThe main result of this bug was financial penalties imposed on some Nethermind-based validators, but this incident also affected the client software that powers about 5% of Ethereum validators. This follows a similar outage in early January that affected \u201cBesu.\u201d\n\nRekindling the debate\n\nThe series of failures has reignited a lively debate on X (formerly Twitter) over the Ethereum blockchain\u2019s persistent issues with client software diversity. Networks that rely on a single client software are more vulnerable.\n\nApproximately 85% of Ethereum\u2019s validators currently use Geth, and recent failures with small execution clients indicate that Geth\u2019s dominant position is There are renewed concerns that it could lead to serious consequences.\n\nGeth stands for \u201cGo Ethereum\u201d and is primarily developed and maintained by the Ethereum Foundation, the main non-profit organization supporting the development of Ethereum.\n\nGeth is not bug-free (as any software is), but it has never experienced the kind of catastrophic outages that hit Nethermind and Besu. If that were to happen, the impact would be far more severe for Ethereum.\n\nDepending on the nature of the bug, a glitch in Geth could bring down the entire network, preventing validators from adding new blocks to the blockchain.\n\nEthereum is also programmed to penalize validators who go offline or break the network\u2019s rules, so thousands of Geth-based validators face financial liability if a bug occurs. may be questioned. The penalties could be even greater if the bugs prove difficult to patch.\n\nNotably, some of the major services that stake Ethereum on behalf of their users, effectively allowing many people to become validators effortlessly, rely on Geth.\n\nGeth is an overwhelmingly popular execution client on Ethereum (Clientdiversity.org)\n\nCygaar, which disseminates information on crypto assets (virtual currency), pointed out in a post by \u201cMillions of Ethereum (ETH) held by validators could be destroyed.\u201d\n\nCiting data from the website execution-diversity.info, Cygaar further notes that major crypto exchanges such as Coinbase, Binance, and Kraken all offer staking services. Said it depends on Geth to run.\n\n\u201cUsers staking on protocols running Geth stand to lose their Ethereum in the event of a significant issue.\u201d\n\nDCinvestor, a crypto investor with a large following on social media, posted on X that it would withdraw its staked assets from Coinbase until Coinbase switches its validator operations to a system that is less dependent on Geth clients.\n\n\u201cAt this point, we cannot ignore the risks of what appears to be a single-client staking setup (reliant on Geth),\u201d DCinvestor said, adding that if something goes wrong, \u201cwe could lose a significant portion of our deposited assets. No,\u201d he continued.\n\nValidator negligence\n\nDaniel Hwang, a validator expert who heads the incubator Kintsugi Tech, said Ethereum clients\u2019 interest in diversity is due to the Ethereum blockchain being held to higher standards than rival chains. This is also due to the fact that there are\n\n\u201cAlmost every other chain doesn\u2019t have the same diversity of client software as Ethereum,\u201d Huang told CoinDesk in an interview.\n\n\u201cMost of them operate with just one client. I think the hurdles are probably high because Ethereum is the dominant smart contract chain.\u201d\n\nAlthough Geth boasts a high level of reliability, Huang said many Ethereum validators continue to use Geth by default (rather than alternatives like Nethermind) out of negligence.\n\nIn his experience, validators \u201cdon\u2019t do their own research\u201d on the strengths and weaknesses of competing client software.\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation is urging validators to improve client diversity, with one researcher, Dankrad Feist, saying that in 2022, validators will no longer use only the dominant client software. A blog that urged this was widely cited the other day. Nethermind\u2019s development is supported by a grant from the Ethereum Foundation.\n\nHuang likened Geth\u2019s dominance despite the circumstances to an old business adage:\n\n\u201cNo one buys IBM and gets fired.\u201d\n\nIn other words, if everyone else is using Geth, it\u2019s hard to criticize a budding validator for using it, even if something goes wrong.\n\nHowever, Huang sees a silver lining in recent bugs in Nethermind and Besu.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to say it\u2019s great that a client gets hit by a bug, but if it makes people think about responsibility, I think it\u2019s great,\u201d Huang said.\n\n\u201cValidators should have checked it themselves from the beginning, instead of just picking it off the supermarket shelf and raising their hands when something goes wrong.\u201d\n\n\uff5cTranslation and editing: Akiko Yamaguchi, Takayuki Masuda\n\n\uff5cImage: Shutterstock\n\n\uff5cOriginal text: Bug That Took Down 8% of Ethereum\u2019s Validators Sparks Worries About Even Bigger Outage"
