        "title": "Bitcoin and Ethereum Prices Are Heading to these Levels Next Week! Here\u2019s What Traders can Expect - Coinpedia Fintech News",
        "content": "Shayan is a digital nomad and a professional journalist. He delivers high-quality engaging articles to Coinpedia through his in-depth research and analysis.\n\nThe crypto market is buzzing with excitement as Bitcoin and Ethereum, two of the most popular cryptocurrencies, appear to be poised for significant price momentum in the coming week. As we approach the end of the month, traders are eagerly anticipating a continuation of the recent upward trend in the cryptocurrency market. Over the last few weeks, these two leading cryptos showed massive gains, and investors are now waiting for an extended bullish rally to maximize their gain.\n\nVolatility is Waiting for BTC And ETH Prices\n\nAmid high banking crisis and crypto market\u2019s regulatory concerns, Bitcoin and Ethereum prices are not slowing down to reach new highs. Despite overall bearish market sentiments, investors are still betting on long-term gains on BTC and ETH as there is an astronomical spike in trading volume and buying pressure, creating possibilities of a new bull run next week.\n\nBTC Price Analysis\n\nBitcoin reached a new nine-month high by surging past $29,000 recently, but the celebration was short-lived as the asset experienced a sharp retracement in the hours that followed. Following a loss of $28,000 the previous day, weekend trading remained relatively stable as traders awaited a break before the resumption of traditional finance markets, resulting in a lack of usual volatility.\n\nBitcoin price is currently showing an inside-day candlestick pattern, signifying a state of FUD among buyers and sellers. Although the bulls aim to extend the up-move, the bears remain firm and unwilling to give in, leading to the price remaining within a narrow range.\n\nAs of writing, BTC price trades at $27.5K, with a decline of 2% in the last 24 hours. The weekly price chart indicates Bitcoin price will likely consolidate below $30K for the next few days. However, a breakout above $30K is expected next week, and the BTC will head toward the crucial resistance of $34K-$38K.\n\nETH Price Analysis\n\nOut of all the altcoins in the cryptocurrency space, Ethereum\u2019s price closely mirrors the performance trend of Bitcoin. Multiple successful breaches of the $1,800 level have been achieved by the digital asset, resulting in increased profits and attracting more investors.\n\nEther breached the overhead resistance of $1,800, but the bulls could not maintain the breakout, as evidenced by the long wick on the candlestick.\n\nThe bears are currently attempting to reinforce their position by pushing the price towards the 20-day EMA ($1,698), which is a crucial level to monitor for potential downsides. ETH price is currently trading at $1,753, declining by 1% from yesterday.\n\nThe weekly price chart indicates a minor downward correction for ETH price next week, as the altcoin may drop below the EMA-50 trend line and reach the bottom levels of $1,500 before sparking fresh surges."

        "title": "A Bull Market Is Coming: One Crypto to Buy Now - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "It's no secret that the crypto market has been struggling over the past year. The entire sector has lost nearly two-thirds of its value since late 2021, with its market cap dropping from a staggering $3 trillion to around $1.19 trillion.\n\nMany investors are also concerned that a recession is looming. If that happens, this crypto winter could drag on even longer.\n\nThe good news, though, is that a bull market is coming eventually. And there's one investment you may want to load up on now before prices surge: Ethereum (ETH 1.41%).\n\nWhy Ethereum is well-positioned for a bull market\n\nLaunched in 2015, Ethereum has proven that it can withstand market volatility. It's faced countless downturns over the past several years, including a particularly severe slump in 2018 when its price fell by a whopping 94%.\n\nWhile past performance doesn't predict future returns, Ethereum's long history is more promising than that of many other cryptocurrencies. Currently, its price is down by roughly 64% from its peak, which is far from the worst it's seen.\n\nEthereum's position in the crypto market also gives it a clear advantage. It's the primary blockchain for decentralized applications ranging from NFT marketplaces to DeFi projects to the metaverse. If any of those applications gain widespread usage, Ethereum will be in a great position to benefit from it.\n\nFinally, Ethereum developers have proven that they're committed to improving the blockchain. Last year, The Merge went off without a hitch, successfully moving the network to a proof-of-stake protocol and vastly reducing its energy usage. And future updates will aim to reduce transaction times and fees, making the blockchain faster and more affordable for users.\n\nIs crypto a smart buy right now?\n\nWhen the entire market is shaky, it can be nerve-wracking to invest anywhere -- let alone in an industry that's famous for its volatility. Before investing in Ethereum, it's important to consider whether you're willing to take on the risk involved in buying cryptocurrency.\n\nIt's almost guaranteed that the stock market will recover from this downturn. After all, the market has existed for many decades and recovered from dozens of slumps during that time. Sooner or later, this bear market will give way to a bull market.\n\nBut crypto is still in its infancy, so there are no promises that this sector will survive over the long haul.\n\nIf the crypto market thrives, Ethereum may be a fantastic buy right now. Because prices are lower, you can stock up at a discount and then reap the rewards when the market recovers. But if crypto doesn't succeed over time, even the strongest investments may fail.\n\nBefore you buy, think about whether that's a risk you're willing to take. When in doubt, ask yourself which scenario you'd regret more: investing now and losing money if crypto fails, or not investing and missing out on potentially lucrative returns if crypto succeeds.\n\nThere's no right or wrong answer here, as your risk tolerance is personal. But it's important to understand the potential downsides involved when investing in crypto, as there are never any guarantees in this sector.\n\nWeighing risk versus reward\n\nEthereum is in a unique position, as it's a strong investment in a speculative industry. The blockchain has several distinct advantages and is well-diversified across many different niches within the crypto space -- from NFTs to DeFi to the metaverse, and more.\n\nBut because crypto is still speculative, Ethereum's long-term success may hinge on whether the sector, as a whole, survives. Because nobody knows what the future holds for crypto, Ethereum is still a risky investment.\n\nWhile there are serious risks to consider, it remains one of the strongest players in the field. And if there's one cryptocurrency I'm keeping in my portfolio for the long haul, it's Ethereum."

        "content": "In brief Stealth addresses provide more privacy for transactions on Ethereum.\n\nThe system offers a method of privacy similar to generating a new address for each transaction but without the hassle of manually creating those addresses each time.\n\nA stealth address can be thought of as a wallet address that is cryptographically tied to the recipient's public address, but that is only revealed to the parties transacting.\n\nYour Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nStealth addresses provide privacy for transactions on Ethereum. While it\u2019s impossible to completely hide a blockchain transaction, stealth addresses can, at the very least, conceal the recipient's identity. And in doing so, offer an added layer of protection for anyone who doesn't want the transaction data overtly tied to them.\n\nOn a distributed ledger (a public record of transactions), anyone can view details of a transaction such as the date, the amount, and the wallets or the entities involved. They can search the specific transaction ID or hash on a block explorer, such as etherscan for Ethereum or Blockstream for Bitcoin.\n\nThat said, attempts to enhance privacy in the Ethereum ecosystem aren't without challenges both from a regulatory and technical standpoint. Case in point: the obstacles with Tornado Cash in 2019 (OFAC sanctions aside). Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin noted that the virtual currency mixer is only able to hide ETH or major ERC-20s tokens. This leaves a gap for other widely-used assets native to the Ethereum protocol such as POAPs, NFTs, and ENS names. Hence the reason for stealth addresses.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nStealth addresses can conceal the recipient's identity.\n\nProposed by Buterin in a recent blog post, a \"stealth address system\" would offer enhanced privacy protections for users, regardless of how small the transaction size or the asset in question.\n\nHow do stealth addresses work?\n\nParaphrasing Buterin, this is how stealth addresses work:\n\nEither the recipient (let\u2019s call them \u201cBob\u201d) or the sender (\u201cAlice\u201d) can generate a stealth address for the transaction. However, only the recipient, Bob, can control the transaction. Another way to think of a stealth address is as a wallet address that is cryptographically tied to Bob\u2019s public address, but that is only revealed to the parties transacting.\n\nTo conceal their identity, Bob first needs to generate a secret \u201cspending key,\u201d which is then used to create a stealth \"meta-address.\" The meta-address is then shared with the sender (Alice), who performs a computation to generate a stealth address that belongs to Bob.\n\nAlice can then send any assets she wants to Bob. When Alice sends assets to the stealth address, she also publishes some extra cryptographic data on-chain (called an ephemeral pubkey) that helps Bob find the assets. Bob scans the chain for this cryptographic data; if he finds any, he uses his spending key to claim the assets.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOverall, this system offers a method of privacy similar to that of generating a new address for each transaction, but without the hassle of manually create those addresses each time. Along with sharing the meta-address with Alice, Bob can register it on ENS (Ethereum Name Service) as the stealth meta-address for something like bob.eth. In that scenario, and assuming Alice knows Bob owns bob.eth, Alice can then look up his stealth meta-address on ENS.\n\nChallenges and limitations with stealth addresses\n\nWhile the idea is still fairly embryonic, Buterin stated that the technology would be fairly easy to implement. But there are still several issues to solve; most notably, gas fees. As a newly-generated stealth address would contain no ETH, the owner of said address wouldn't be able to send any assets from it (to pay for gas fees) without first transferring ETH from another address. But by doing so, the transaction data would reflect on-chain data, thus defeating the purpose of it being anonymous.\n\nAnother long-term solution that Buterin proposed would be to use Zero-Knowledge Proofs, despite also being somewhat costly due to the extra gas required. Other potential pathways would be to use specialized transaction aggregators\u2014something where users can pay for multiple transactions at once and then spend these prepaid transactions whenever necessary.\n\nIn his closing thoughts, Buterin stated that supporting stealth addresses would also require significant changes to the functionality of Ethereum-based wallets, and suggests that wallet developers should start working towards a multi-address model that is able to properly encrypt and decrypt transaction data along with create a new address for each application or new addresses for privacy-related reasons as well.\n\nAnd while not perfect, stealth addresses are another tool to help increase the overall privacy in the Ethereum network and thus solve one of the bigger remaining challenges for the ecosystem to scale."

        "content": "Ethereum exchange balance hit a five-year low as more holders moved their assets to self-custody options and DeFi platforms.\n\nThe decline in exchange balance can be attributed to factors such as the rise of DeFi, the switch to PoS, and the downturn in the crypto market.\n\nThe beginning of the year ushered in a whirlwind of events that significantly influenced the crypto industry, with Ethereum being (ETH) no exception.\n\nThe current state of affairs, including the SEC\u2019s regulatory crackdown and potential bank runs, has undoubtedly left ETH holders feeling disillusioned. However, other factors might be responsible for the dwindling ETH exchange balance.\n\nRead Ethereum [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nEthereum exchange balance declines\n\nIn 2022, the FTX crash sent shockwaves through the crypto world, causing many holders to question the safety of keeping their assets on exchanges.\n\nThe incident sparked a renewed interest in self-custody to secure crypto holdings. However, while Ethereum experienced a decrease in exchange balances in the months following the crash, this trend can be attributed to other factors beyond fear of exchange insecurity.\n\nEthereum exchange netflow flashes negative\n\nAccording to a recent Glassnode chart from Glassnode alerts, the balance of Ethereum held on exchanges has been steadily decreasing.\n\nAs of this writing, the exchange balance had reached a five-year low, hovering just above $18 million. This trend indicates that more ETH holders are opting for alternative storage methods rather than leaving their assets on exchanges.\n\nIn addition, a closer examination of Ethereum\u2019s exchange netflow reveals that the outflow of ETH from exchanges has exceeded the inflow, with few exceptions of inflow spikes.\n\nCurrently, the netflow of ETH on exchanges remains negative, with outflow continuing to dominate. At the time of writing, the netflow had surpassed 11,000 ETH already, highlighting the ongoing trend of ETH holders moving their assets away from exchanges.\n\nPossible reasons for declining exchange balance\n\nOne possible factor is the rise of decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms built on the Ethereum network. Many holders have moved their funds from centralized exchanges to DeFi protocols to earn higher yields.\n\nThe yields come through liquidity provision, staking, or other forms of participation in decentralized finance. Also, ETH stakes account for 15% of the coins in circulation per staking rewards.\n\nIt is also possible that some holders took a more long-term investment approach by holding their assets in personal wallets. It is a means of storing value and avoiding short-term trading risks.\n\nAlso, the crypto market experienced a downturn in the latter half of 2022. The downturn may have led some holders to move their assets off exchanges and into personal wallets.\n\nDaily timeframe move and 365-day MVRV\n\nDespite experiencing a decent price run, Ethereum (ETH) had yet to regain the price zone it dropped back in May. As of this writing, it was trading at approximately $1,740 and had sustained losses for two consecutive days. However, ETH had maintained a support level of around $1,732 and $1,630, previously resistance levels.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nThe 365-day Market Value to Realized Value ratio (MVRV) revealed that for most of the period being analyzed, ETH was trading below zero.\n\nHowever, as of this writing, the MVRV had surpassed the zero line and currently sat at 13.60%. This indicated that, on average, the holders of ETH were now profitable, given the price at which they acquired their coins."

        "content": "The cryptocurrency market is constantly evolving, and 2023 is shaping up to be a year of significant developments.\n\nEthereum (ETH), Polygon (MATIC), and RenQ Finance (RENQ) are three cryptocurrencies that have been making waves recently. In this article, we will take a closer look at these projects and what they have in store for investors in 2023.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Shanghai upgrade is almost ready\n\nEthereum is a blockchain platform that allows developers to create decentralized applications. The platform has been around since 2015 and has grown to become the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. However, one of the biggest issues with Ethereum has been its slow transaction times and high gas fees.\n\nThe upcoming hard fork for the Ethereum blockchain, known as the Shanghai upgrade, is set to be launched in March of 2023. In 2022, a test net called Shandong was conducted in preparation for the launch.\n\nThe Shanghai upgrade aims to address these issues by making Ethereum more efficient and scalable. The upgrade will introduce several new features, including a new consensus algorithm called Proof of Stake (PoS) and sharding. These changes will help Ethereum process more transactions and reduce gas fees, making it more accessible to a wider audience.\n\nThe Shanghai upgrade includes multiple improvements, but one of the most significant is the ability for Ethereum stakers to withdraw both their staked ETH and earned rewards. This has been a highly desired feature among Ethereum users and the wider cryptocurrency community, and it is outlined in the EIP-4895 proposal.\n\nPolygon (MATIC) making big strides in the metaverse\n\nPolygon is a layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum that allows for faster and cheaper transactions. It is a platform for building decentralized applications and has been gaining popularity in the metaverse. Polygon\u2019s infrastructure enables seamless interoperability between different blockchain networks, making it an attractive option for developers looking to create cross-chain applications.\n\nPolygon has made significant strides in the metaverse space, with several high-profile projects already using its infrastructure. One example is the virtual world Decentraland, which has integrated Polygon for faster and cheaper transactions. This partnership has helped Decentraland attract more users and increased its popularity.\n\nRenQ Finance (RENQ) crosses the $3M milestone with ease\n\nRenQ Finance is a decentralized exchange that operates on multiple chains and offers non-custodial trading directly through its wallet app. Its goal is to establish a cross-chain network that enables the seamless and affordable exchange of assets between previously isolated blockchains.\n\nRenQ has been making waves in the cryptocurrency market with its impressive ongoing presale stages. In just three stages, RenQ has raised over $3 million, showing the high demand for its unique approach to interoperability and scalability.\n\nRenQ\u2019s user-friendly DeFi platform and verified security, fast and secure network, and limited token supply make it an attractive investment option for both short-term and long-term investors.\n\nAs always, investors should conduct thorough research and exercise caution before investing in any cryptocurrency.\n\nSummary\n\nThe cryptocurrency market is always changing, and Ethereum, Polygon, and RenQ Finance are three projects to watch out for in 2023.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Shanghai upgrade aims to make the platform more efficient and scalable, while Polygon is making significant strides in the metaverse space. RenQ Finance\u2019s unique approach to interoperability and scalability makes it an attractive investment option for both short-term and long-term investors.\n\nIn conclusion, it is important to do your research and understand the risks involved before making any investment decisions.\n\nClick Here to Buy RenQ Finance (RENQ) Tokens.\n\nVisit the links below for more information about RenQ Finance (RENQ):\n\nWebsite: https://renq.io\n\nWhitepaper: https://renq.io/whitepaper.pdf\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "The hacker behind the largest DeFi exploit of 2023 continues to demonstrate controversial behavior, as this time, they returned the majority of the funds stolen from Euler Finance.\n\nIn two separate transactions, the perpetrator sent back over $100 million worth of ETH to the protocol.\n\nCryptoPotato reported the flash loan attack, which took place earlier in March, that saw $198 million worth of USDC, staked ether, wrapped BTC, and DAI siphoned off the DeFi lending protocol. Later reports suggested that this vulnerability was evident for over eight months before the exploit.\n\nThe team behind the project offered the attacker a $20 million bounty, which they rejected, and started laundering portions of the proceeds via TornadoCash.\n\nInterestingly, the perpetrator returned some funds to an Euler user who complained on Twitter. Shortly after, the attacker also sent back some ether to the DeFi protocol, while reports suggested that they could be linked to the notorious Lazarus Group.\n\nFurther on-chain data from this weekend show that the hacker made two separate transactions returning over $104 million worth of ETH to Euler Finance.\n\nThe first was carried out on March 25, in which they sent back 51,000 ETH. The second, which happened hours later, saw the return of another 7,737 ETH.\n\nThe decision to return the majority of the funds positively affected the protocol\u2019s native EUL token, which is up by more than 35% on a 24-hour scale."

        "title": "Analyst Predicts Ethereum Rival Will Explode by Over 90%, Updates Outlook on XRP, Cardano and Solana - The Daily Hodl",
        "content": "A top crypto analyst is mapping the path forward for four crypto assets that have witnessed bullish price action in the last seven days.\n\nIn a new strategy session, pseudonymous analyst Cred tells his 49,200 YouTube subscribers that XRP could witness bullish continuation as long as it is above the previous resistance at $0.414.\n\n\u201cIf this breakout sticks and XRP does its sort of trend wiping candles where it just moons and sort of retraces weeks and weeks and weeks of selling in a much smaller number of weeks, if that is the case, I think the bigger magnet if you will, or the clearer level for price is about $0.50 to $0.60.\u201d\n\nXRP, which is up by nearly 10% in the past week, is trading at $0.425 at time of writing.\n\nNext up is smart contract protocol Cardano (ADA). Cred says the seventh largest crypto asset by market cap is \u201crespecting technicals\u201d and could revisit its 2023 high of $0.42, which it hit in February.\n\n\u201cI think as long as you\u2019re not getting daily acceptance below sort of $0.35 and this more recent flip level [of around $0.35]\u2026 I think if this reclaims sticks, the next high timeframe trouble area is this big support resistance flip range high thing at around $0.41.That makes sense to me.\n\nAnd then if that breaks, we can just carve out a range of this thing with $0.40, $0.60-ish and $0.50 is the mid. But I think in the short term, we have pretty clear trading levels between $0.35 and $0.42-ish\u201d\n\nCardano is trading at $0.361 at time of writing.\n\nTurning to Solana (SOL), the pseudonymous analyst says that the 12th-largest crypto by market cap is forming a double bottom pattern after managing to hold support at $20 According to Cred, Solana is still range bound with support at $20, range midpoint at $23 and resistance at $26.\n\n\u201cWe essentially have a double bottom forming just above a high timeframe level of support [at $20]\u2026\n\nSort of range low reclaim as long as you don\u2019t get daily closes back below $20 \u2013 $21. That looks like it\u2019s trading back within the range.\n\nWhen markets do that, we like to look at the mid and the other side of the range, which I think for this [Solana daily timeframe] chart would be something akin to $22 is the range midpoint, $24-ish is the range high.\n\nYou could be a bit more charitable and use something closer to the extremities, the sort of same range local at around $20 and then the $26 range high, giving you a $23, $24 mid.\u201d\n\nSolana is worth $20.89 at time of writing.\n\nThe last coin on the trader\u2019s radar is Ethereum (ETH) rival Fantom (FTM). According to Cred, FTM looks bullish provided it stays above its previous resistance at $0.43.\n\n\u201cAs long as that\u2019s the case, then you\u2019d expect the high [around $0.65] to be traded and then the next big trouble area, if we get a really meaty rotation, is the former range high at like $0.70 to $0.90.\u201d\n\nFantom is trading at $0.46 at time of writing. A move toward the upper bounds of the analyst\u2019s target suggests a rally of over 90% for the Ethereum competitor.\n\nI\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "title": "Are the winds of change blowing for cryptos as Bitcoin spikes 65% this year, ETH 46%? - MintGenie",
        "content": "Despite a high rate of tax on crypto , declining trading volumes and recently imposed money laundering provisions , India\u2019s crypto sector still manages to garner an increasing interest of investors.\n\nThere are a number of reasons that explain this conundrum. This Calendar year is turning out to be relatively good for cryptocurrencies. Investors heaved a sigh of relief after bitcoin's price hit a 9-month high recently after the Silicon Valley Bank's collapse.\n\n\u201cThe collapse fuelled the rise in crypto prices because the belief in centralised banking systems was affected. As the flaws in the existing systems become more evident, the crypto sector will continue to have a revival,\u201d says Avinash Shekhar, Founder & CEO, TaxNodes.\n\nSome experts have called this trend an affirmation of \u2018reverse relationship\u2019 between fiat currencies and blockchain-generated currencies.\n\nTo explain in simpler words: while banking system is undergoing a turmoil with the collapse of two US-based regional banks (Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank), blockchain- generated currencies are getting a much-needed boost at the same time.\n\n\u201cIn a truly remarkable decoupling from traditional finance, Bitcoin price has been soaring since the banking crisis started unfolding. Medium-size and regional banks in the US are under pressure due to fast rising interest rates and a run-on deposits, while industry observers are of the view that Bitcoin\u2019s fixed supply schedule offers a unique hedge against the current macro environment,\u201d says Parth Chaturvedi, Crypto Ecosystem Lead, CoinSwitch.\n\nBitcoin has been rising considerably since the start of this year. Bitcoins prices rose from $16,625 (on Jan 1) to $27,493 (on Mar 24), reporting an increase of 65.37 percent in fewer than three months. Trading volumes spiked by 182 percent during this period.\n\nEthereum prices also rose considerably from $1,201 (on Jan 1) to $1,752 (Mar 24), reporting an increase of 45.87 percent. The ETH trading volumes during this period rose by 356 percent, CoinMarketCap data shows.\n\nBTC trading Volume\n\n(Source: CoinMarketCap)\n\nCoinswitch\u2019s Parth Chaturvedi also confirms a similar trend. \u201cTrading volumes across asset classes is a function of prices and usually increasing prices attract more trading volume. We have witnessed a similar trend in crypto trading volumes, since the beginning of the year, when prices started moving higher. We continue to onboard new domestic users and are also seeing existing users come back with renewed interest as crypto as an asset class is helping in portfolio diversification,\u201d says Mr Chaturvedi.\n\n\u201cThe rally in bitcoin and other crypto prices will certainly add a positive outlook for cryptos for long-term investors,\u201d adds Shekhar from TaxNodes.\n\nPolkadot conference\n\nNow since cryptocurrencies are made on blockchain technology, India\u2019s large IT population and ever-growing tech infrastructure can turn things to its advantage, assert industry experts.\n\n\u201cDue to government policies and increased market awareness, there has been a decoupling of cryptocurrency from blockchain. This shift in focus presents India with a unique opportunity to become a powerhouse of blockchain innovation, given its large IT competent population. This trend is a testimony to the shifting interests in the technology, and we can expect to witness more eastward movement of blockchains in the near future,\u201d says Gaurav Mehta, Founder of Catax \u2014 Simple Crypto Taxes.\n\nAn upcoming global blockchain conference next month by Polkadot blockchain platform is seen as a validation of India\u2019s growing importance in the blockchain technology.\n\nPolkadot blockchain platform is hosting first global conference in India in the first week of April in run up to its foray into India.\n\nWhile talking about the conference, Rishant (Rish) Kumar, Growth Lead, APAC, KILT Protocol said that India is an important hub for blockchain innovation.\n\nThis global conference can be seen by crypto optimists as one of the key events in the annals of blockchain industry and its growing significance in India.\n\nIt\u2019s technology, stupid!\n\nExperts argue that the blockchain technology is revolutionary and its innovative use cases and implications continue to unfold. And the confusion happens when the entire focus of investors revolves around crypto prices instead of viewing blockchain in its entirety.\n\n\u201cDespite its immense potential, the public at large has predominantly focused on the oasis of cryptocurrency, attracted by the promise of quick returns and libertarian ideals. As a result, blockchain technology has received less attention and remained outside of mainstream discourse and implementation,\u201d says Mr Mehta from Catax.\n\nHowever, in view of the extreme volatility witnessed in the past, investors are advised to be wary before getting too bullish on cryptocurrencies.\n\nAfter all, despite the recently reported increase in bitcoin prices, this cryptocurrency still trades nearly 60 percent lower than its all-time high of $68,789.\n\n\u201cInvestors are finding merit in Bitcoin\u2019s function as a store of value against monetary debasement, and the next few months will be crucial in supporting this narrative,\u201d Parth Chaturvedi signs off.\n\nSo far, it may be a good year for cryptocurrencies, but what does the future hold for them \u2014 only a crystal ball reader can predict."

        "content": "Solana\u2019s Nakamoto Coefficient stood at 31 as compared to Ethereum\u2019s 1.\n\nSolana was well-distributed across geographies with no country controlling 33% of the active stake.\n\nThe Solana [SOL] Foundation published its latest Validator Health Report wherein it disclosed vital stats like the number of validator nodes and their distribution across the network.\n\nAccording to the report, the network boasted more than 3,400 nodes out of which over 2,400 were nodes that participated in validating transactions on the chain, also called consensus nodes.\n\n1/ The March 2023 Validator Health Report is out. Today, @Solana is one of the largest proof of stake networks in the world by node count, and one of the most distributed by Nakamoto Coefficient. https://t.co/NlxHZqHnV5 pic.twitter.com/1AcDtQK7p2 \u2014 Solana Foundation (@SolanaFndn) March 23, 2023\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Solana Profit Calculator\n\nSolana scores over Ethereum?\n\nThe Nakamoto Coefficient, created by former Coinbase CTO Balaji Srinivasan, is a widely-used measure of the decentralization of a blockchain.\n\nThe Nakamoto coefficient measures decentralization and represents the minimum number of nodes required to disrupt the blockchain\u2019s network.\n\nA higher Nakamoto Coefficient indicates that the network has a large number of nodes and is thus more decentralized and safe.\n\nOne of the major takeaways of the report was the reading of the Nakamoto Coefficient. For the Solana chain, it stood at 31 as compared to just 1 for the biggest proof-of-stake network, Ethereum [ETH].\n\nA look at Ethereum\u2019s validator distribution will most likely sum this up. More than 44% of the staked ETH was held by just four participants.\n\nFurthermore, the report highlighted that Solana was well-distributed across geographies with no country controlling 33% of the active stake. However, in the case of Ethereum, more than 45% of the nodes were concentrated in only one country, the U.S.\n\nSolana\u2019s safety precautions\n\nA bug in a validator client has the potential to shut an entire network down if there\u2019s no backup. Solana stated that it had two validator clients at its disposal to help during exigencies. A third client was under development.\n\nIt should be noted that the network was hit by a major outage on 25 February, which lasted for nearly 20 hours. Tech disruptions for Solana aren\u2019t a new phenomenon. It was hit by several network glitches in 2022 as well.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s SOL market cap in BTC\u2019s terms\n\nIt was clear that Solana was focusing on network enhancements as indicated by the increasing development activity. The investors\u2019 sentiment stayed in the positive terrain as well, which in part was fueled by improving market conditions.\n\nThe transaction volume for SOL declined by over 50% since hitting $1.14 billion on 20 March. Consequently, the price fell by more than 8% until press time, per CoinMarketCap data."

He believes it is a historic milestone that indicates massive upside potential in the ADA price to $15.\n\nCardano influencer Dan Gambardello in a tweet on March 25 shared the interesting news of the number of wallets on the Cardano network breaching the 4 million \u201chistoric milestone.\u201d In a new YouTube video, he revealed why it is such a crucial number and predicted the ADA price.\n\nadvertisement\n\nCARDANO JUST BROKE HISTORIC MILESTONE! (ADA PREDICTION HERE!)https://t.co/nioIbnykQM \u2014 Dan Gambardello (@cryptorecruitr) March 25, 2023\n\nAfter his earlier analysis of accurately predicting the ADA high of $3 when the price was trading at $0.08 in June 2020, based on Ethereum events. Dan Gambardello has once again used Ethereum data to predict ADA price.\n\nAccording to his analysis, Ethereum hit 4 million wallets in 2017 at a market cap of $21 billion and Cardano reached the 4 million wallet milestone at a $12 billion market cap. In the bull run, Ethereum went on to hit 125 billion market cap and Cardano hit a $91 billion market cap.\n\nHe predicts ADA price will hit a high of $15 in the next bull market, with the market cap reaching nearly $500 billion. He believes developments related to Cardano are in line with Ethereum and considers Cardano a better blockchain.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not even discussing the fundamentals here.

        "title": "Will Bitcoin (BTC) reach new ATH in 2023? Here's why Ethereum (ETH) and RenQ Finance (RENQ) will follow the suit - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "Bitcoin, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency, has had an unprecedented year in 2021. From its low of around $4,000 in March 2020, Bitcoin reached its all-time high (ATH) of over $69,000 in November 2021.\n\nHowever, since then, Bitcoin\u2019s price has been fluctuating, and it has failed to reach a new ATH. This has left many investors wondering if Bitcoin will ever reach new ATH in 2023.\n\nIn this article, we will explore the factors that may contribute to Bitcoin reaching new ATH in 2023 and how Ethereum and RenQ Finance may follow the suit.\n\nThe Bitcoin Market Cap\n\nThe first factor that may contribute to Bitcoin reaching a new ATH in 2023 is the Bitcoin market cap. As of writing, Bitcoin holds the top position in the cryptocurrency market capitalization rankings, with a value of more than $534 billion.\n\nWhile this may seem like a lot, it\u2019s important to note that the total market cap of all cryptocurrencies is around $1.16 trillion according to coinmarketcap. This means that Bitcoin accounts for less than half of the total cryptocurrency market cap.\n\nWith the increasing adoption of cryptocurrencies by institutional investors and corporations, we may see a significant increase in the Bitcoin market cap. This increase in the market cap may push Bitcoin\u2019s price to a new ATH in 2023.\n\nInstitutional Adoption\n\nThe second factor that may contribute to Bitcoin reaching new ATH in 2023 is institutional adoption. Over the past year, we have seen a significant increase in institutional adoption of Bitcoin.\n\nCompanies like MicroStrategy, Tesla, and Square have all invested billions of dollars in Bitcoin. In addition, we have seen the launch of Bitcoin futures on major exchanges like CME Group and the launch of Bitcoin ETFs in Canada.\n\nWith more institutions investing in Bitcoin, we may see a significant increase in demand for Bitcoin, which may push its price to a new ATH in 2023.\n\nEthereum and RenQ Finance\n\nWhile Bitcoin may be the focus of many investors, it\u2019s important to note that other cryptocurrencies may follow the suit. Ethereum and RenQ Finance are two cryptocurrencies that may see significant growth in the coming years.\n\nEthereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, and it\u2019s often referred to as the \u201cworld computer.\u201d Ethereum is the backbone of the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem and is used to build decentralized applications (dApps). Ethereum\u2019s value proposition is that it can do everything that Bitcoin can do, but it can also execute smart contracts. With the increasing adoption of DeFi and the launch of Ethereum 2.0, we may see a significant increase in the demand for Ethereum, which may push its price to a new ATH in 2023.\n\nRenQ Finance is a relatively new cryptocurrency that has gained significant attention in the crypto space. RenQ Finance is a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform built on the Ethereum blockchain. It aims to provide a one-stop solution for all kinds of traders under one platform in the DeFi world. RenQ Finance aims to connect all isolated blockchains and establish a cross-chain asset exchange network, providing all necessary underlying support for the DeFi ecosystem. With the increasing adoption of DeFi and the unique value proposition of RenQ Finance, we may see a significant increase in the demand for RenQ Finance, which may push its price to a new ATH in 2023.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, while Bitcoin may be the focus of many investors, it\u2019s important to note that other cryptocurrencies may follow the suit.\n\nEthereum and RenQ Finance are among the cryptocurrencies that show potential for significant growth in the coming years. As more institutional investors and corporations adopt cryptocurrencies, there is a possibility of a significant increase in their value.\n\nRenQ Finance, in particular, has been gaining attention from investors as experts predict 100x gains soon, making it an attractive option for those looking to boost their investment portfolio.\n\nClick Here to Buy RenQ Finance (RENQ) Tokens.\n\nVisit the links below for more information about RenQ Finance (RENQ):\n\nWebsite: https://renq.io\n\nWhitepaper: https://renq.io/whitepaper.pdf\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nAn NFT trader was devastated Friday to discover that a CryptoPunk he purchased for 77 Ethereum went up in smoke after he accidentally sent the pricy piece of digital art to a burn address.\n\nToday I accidentally burned a @cryptopunksnfts trying to wrap punk 685. I was so focused on following the instructions exactly, that I slipped up, destroying a third of of my net worth in a single transaction. @yugalabs please sell me the @v1punks 685 as a consolation. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc pic.twitter.com/jHoTGvlc7j \u2014 Brandon Riley (@vitalitygrowth) March 25, 2023\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBurn addresses, which are digital wallets that don\u2019t have a private key, are one-way gateways that can only receive assets like cryptocurrencies and NFTs. As a result, the NFT was permanently removed from circulation, preventing it from ever being traded or owned again.\n\nBrandon Riley, who purchased CryptoPunk #685 two weeks ago, said he made an error when attempting to wrap the NFT to take a loan against it on Twitter. He told Decrypt he planned on posting CryptoPunk #685 to NFTfi.com, where he could earn a yield of around 7% per year.\n\nI would just like to make one thing clear. I was not wrapping this punk to sell it on Blur. It was to be my \u201cforever punk\u201d. The number is exact reverse of my ape. I was only wrapping it because I needed to borrow some liquidity from it. \u2014 Brandon Riley (@vitalitygrowth) March 24, 2023\n\nCryptoPunk #685 was worth approximately $129,000 in Ethereum when it was acquired by Riley, according to the Ethereum block explorer Etherscan.\n\nOriginally created in 2017, CryptoPunks is widely viewed as a \u201cblue chip\u201d collection, on par with the likes of Yuga Labs\u2019 Bored Ape Yacht Club. With a market capitalization of over $1 billion, the cheapest CryptoPunk is worth just over $109,000, according to NFT Price Floor.\n\nHowever, CryptoPunks were created before ERC-721 was established as a token standard for NFTs, making them incompatible with some marketplaces and applications designed for decentralized finance\u2014such as NFTfi.com.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nUsing a guide he found online, Riley tried to wrap his punk as an ERC-721 token, creating a new digital token that proved he owned CryptoPunk #685 but would be compatible with NFTfi.com. But by inputting the wrong address, CryptoPunk #685 is now forever gone.\n\nThis is truly a devastating mistake for me.\ud83d\udc94 But I did this myself, and it is no one\u2019s fault but my own. Both the beauty and the curse of self-custody. Stay safe out there everyone, and please be way more careful than I was. Thank you to so many of you for the kind words. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc \u2014 Brandon Riley (@vitalitygrowth) March 25, 2023\n\nRiley\u2019s unfavorable situation is indicative of issues that many face in the digital assets industry due to the often complex and irreversible nature of transactions. And because there are no financial intermediaries involved, there\u2019s nothing Riley can do to get his lost CryptoPunk back, which he described as \u201cboth the beauty and the curse of self-custody.\u201d\n\nOne Twitter user named NFToga pointed out that the guide used by Riley has since been updated, including language that specifically warns people not to send CryptoPunks to wallets formatted as burn addresses.\n\nAsking for some form of a reprieve, Riley asked Yuga Labs\u2014which purchased the IP to CryptoPunks from Larva Labs last year\u2014if he could buy the v1 version of CryptoPunk #685. CryptoPunks v2 was released after a bug was found in the original collection's smart contract.\n\nIn the original Cryptopunks smart contract, there was a code error that caused Ethereum to be allocated to the buyer instead of the seller when a purchase was made. In other words, a buyer was immediately refunded for their purchase and was able to keep the Punk. /2 \u2014 CryptoPunks \u1d5b\u00b9 (@v1punks) March 28, 2022\n\nRiley said that he has not yet from Yuga Labs after tagging them in his posts on Twitter, and Yuga Labs did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Decrypt.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSometimes, NFTs aren\u2019t burned by accident, but rather as a way of making a statement. Last month, Jason Williams burned BAYC # 1626\u2014worth $169,000 at the time\u2014to symbolically shift the asset\u2019s underlying network from Ethereum to Bitcoin in the form of an Inscription made through Ordinals."

        "title": "Rise Of Meme Coins - Can Dogetti Outperform Bitcoin & Ethereum? - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "The crypto world owes its existence to the founding of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin & Ethereum. The advent of Bitcoin and the crypto world as a whole changed the narrative of the global economy and how investments are perceived. This revolutionary concept paved the way for many more cryptos to surface which led to multiplicity and with multiplicity came diversity. Today, the crypto world is not just limited to Bitcoin or Ethereum; instead, it has many more interesting investment options like NFTs, DAOs, meme coins, etc. The genre of meme coins particularly has gained much traction as investors are loving the collaborative concept of entertainment and investment. One particular meme coin that\u2019s currently trending for the right reasons is Dogetti; a dog-based meme coin, and investors are hoarding this new crypto coin. Let\u2019s learn more about Dogetti and how it is following the footsteps of the crypto king and queen; Bitcoin & Ethereum.\n\nBitcoin \u2013 All Hail The Crypto King\n\nBitcoin\u2019s birth was a revolutionary moment in the history of global economics. As aforementioned, the crypto world owes its existence to Bitcoin. Initially, no one believed in the concept of digital currency so naturally many eyebrows were raised and this newly born concept faced immense backlash. However, hardships are exactly what turn a cadet into a warrior and Bitcoin soon proved everyone wrong by showing its true worth. Today, Bitcoin sits at the top of the crypto chain and holds a value of over $1 trillion! Bitcoin uses blockchain technology to secure its transactions and since it is decentralised, it is independent of all external controlling authorities which makes it a dream come true for all investors!\n\nEthereum \u2013 The Crypto Queen!\n\nJust like every king needs a queen, Bitcoin also needed a companion to support it in the cause of revolutionising the global economy. That is when Ethereum came into existence \u2013 not as a companion though, more like a sweet competitor. Ethereum quickly gained a market cap of $250 billion and soon became the second-strongest cryptocurrency in the entire crypto ecosystem. Just like Bitcoin, Ethereum is also decentralised, however, unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum is not merely a currency. Instead, it is a platform that\u2019s built to create dapps and create the path for other cryptos to come!\n\nDogetti \u2013 The Upcoming Meme Coin Sensation\n\nAlthough Dogetti is not the first crypto that\u2019s based on a dog, it certainly is the first one to gain massive love even before its official release in the crypto-verse. Dogetti is a Shiba Inu dog breed-based meme coin that has a spicy touch to its attire. This innocent-looking dog is draped in a mafia getup which makes him super distinctive and adorable at the same time. The purpose of creating this gangster-themed coin is not to intimidate investors but to let them know that the top dog has finally arrived! If there was an award for being the most community-centred crypto, Dogetti would definitely win it.\n\nDogetti aka Don Eloni likes to call his community his family just to give them a sense of belonging and to let them know that they are valued. Dogetti is extremely cautious about his family and takes great pride in treating them now and then. Dogetti recently launched a 50% bonus code for its family members just so they get to make the most of their money! As a result of Dogetti\u2019s generosity, its family has already managed to generate a 300% ROI! Since this coin is still in its presale stage and is already generating massive ROIs, it is only fair to say that this coin will certainly do wonders once it is officially launched. The Dogetti family is growing by leaps and bounds which is a sign that this coin is off to a great start and based on its current presale progress, it can be said that Dogetti might achieve the greatness that Bitcoin and Ethereum achieved in the crypto-verse!\n\nTo know more about Dogetti (DETI):\n\nPresale: https://dogetti.io/how-to-buy\n\nWebsite: https://dogetti.io/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/Dogetti\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/_Dogetti\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "Two of the world\u2019s largest investment funds, Blackrock and Fidelity Investments, embrace cryptocurrency. Are they eyeing a bull run?\n\nMajor cryptocurrencies are now trading far below their all-time high since late 2022. Bitcoin investors saw their investment drop by more than 60%. However, the news of trillion-dollar giants like Blackrock and Fidelity offering top cryptocurrencies is definitely a sign of something big.\n\nAfter all, they have access to information that is not available to commoners.\n\nNow, the million-dollar question: Is it the right time to invest in cryptos, and what to invest in? Here, we discuss the best cryptocurrencies of 2023, including Bitcoin (BTC). Ethereum (ETH) and Dogetti (DETI).\n\nBitcoin \u2013 Invest in the World\u2019s Largest Digital Currency\n\nBitcoin (BTC) was in a bad shape at the beginning of the year, and the cryptocurrency market witnessed bankruptcies, company scandals, and a huge blood bath. But in the last three months, Bitcoin has regained its lost luster, has outperformed several asset classes this year with more than 70% gains, and was trading close to its highest level in the past nine months.\n\nThe first and largest cryptocurrency has been through this before; over its 15-year history, it has experienced both dizzying price surges and losses. Interest rates are driving the increases. Another reason for the recent price hike can be pointed to the Bitcoin halving event that is scheduled for early 2024. Throughout the history of Bitcoin, the post-halving money flows have always led the price to recover, even though the dollar worth of mined BTC originally decreased after each halving.\n\nInvesting in top cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin in 2023 will likely double your investment in a year.\n\nDogetti \u2013 A Meme Coin You Should Know About in 2023\n\nMeme coins are considered a joke across the crypto industry. But even these so-called jokes returned 1,000 times for average investors during their peak in 2021. Those early investors in Dogecoin and Shiba Inu are now multi-millionaires.\n\nDogetti (DETI) is a refined approach to meme coin investing. The DETI creators have a community-first approach \u2013 they prioritize the Dogetti family over anything and the whole token is built in such a way that the community members earn well. With reflection protocols and NFT breeding mechanisms embedded, the coin promises huge future potential.\n\nMaking the news consistently in the meme coin ecosystem is a tough job however this mafia-themed coin seems to have cracked the matrix with its style and charisma. Dogetti is making rounds across social media now for its recent bonus that welcomes new members with a bonus code \u2013 DON50.\n\nIt is wise to invest in meme coins during their presale season to truly unlock their potential. Dogetti promises a return of 900% when the coin launches in the next few months.\n\nEthereum \u2013 Circling the $2000 Skies\n\nIn addition to Bitcoin, Ethereum (ETH) has also been shattering records and reaching new heights. The largest altcoin has increased by about 15% during the past week. In reality, ETH reached highs of approximately $1841. ( 7-month high)\n\nMoreover, Ethereum has been able to convert its downtrend resistance into a support level on the daily timescale chart. In reality, ETH quickly rose and registered a 30% inclination after breaking above the downtrend.\n\nInterestingly, Microsoft testing an Ethereum-based non-custodial wallet for its Edge browser is another reason for the price soar. Screenshots from various sources indicate functionality for NFTs and crypto swaps, even if the project is still in its early testing stages and is confidential.\n\nTakeaway\n\nInteresting times await the world of crypto. Early adopters are likely to get multifold returns on their investments. Jump into the crypto pool before mammoth institutional investors enter the market and drive the prices to the moon.\n\nDogetti (DETI)\n\nPresale: https://dogetti.io/how-to-buy\n\nWebsite: https://dogetti.io/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/Dogetti\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/_Dogetti_x\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "The cryptocurrency market rebounded to $1.18 trillion after an overnight growth of 2.18%, following a sharp dip to $1.12 trillion the previous day in the aftermath of the US Federal Reserve raising interest rates by 0.25% for the ninth consecutive time.\n\nThe latest hike in interest rates has drawn concerns among traders that it could add to the current financial turmoil triggered by a string of bank closures and acquisitions in the US and Europe.\n\nThe crisis around the banking sector, however, has benefited the cryptocurrency industry with prices of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) rallying toward new highs as depositors were switching to digital assets from traditional banking.\n\nIn the meme coin space, Big Eyes Coin (BIG) joined the latest bull run with its latest bonus code which offers traders and BIG holders heavy returns ahead of its live launch.\n\nBitcoin \u2013 Pushback to $30,000 After Brief Drop\n\nBitcoin (BTC) resumed its pushback toward the $30,000 mark after the hike in interest rates by the US Federal Reserve caused a dip in BTC\u2019s price to as low as $26,760. However, a fightback by investors pushed Bitcoin\u2019s price above the $28,000 mark once again to continue its 70% upward movement experienced since the beginning of 2023.\n\nAt the time of writing, Bitcoin had risen by 2.24% in the past 24 hours to trade at $28,268.25, a slight downward correction from its 24-hour high of $28,729.84.\n\nEthereum \u2013 The Surge to August 2022 High\n\nEthereum (ETH) outperformed Bitcoin for a second straight day in terms of percentage points after ETH surged to its highest price since August last year after posting $1,853.89. Similar to Bitcoin, Ethereum\u2019s price dipped to $1,717.77 following the interest rate hikes but made a far better reversal than BTC after a 4% rise ensured ETH traded above the $1,800 mark once again.\n\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum was trading $1,818.04 with a weekly upward movement of 5.73% while holding a market capitalization of $222 billion, and a 24-hour trading volume of $10.8 billion.\n\nBig Eyes Coin \u2013 New 250% Bonus Code as the Bull Market Returns\n\nBig Eyes Coin (BIG) is the latest cryptocurrency in the meme coin space with the goal of shifting wealth into the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) ecosystem. Built on the Ethereum blockchain, the ERC-20 meme token is owned by its community and self-propagates using Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), which offer its holders access to more content and events.\n\nThe project launched its Initial Coin Offer (ICO) in August last year and has so far raised over $32 million in presale tokens and plans to go live on the market after stage 15 and reaches its $50 million presale target.\n\nAfter a series of successful giveaways, Big Eyes Coin has joined the bull market with the launch of its latest bonus code, BULLRUN250 which offers crypto users a massive 250% bonus for a purchase of BIG tokens or Loot Boxes. For example, if a user enters the BULLRUN250 bonus code when purchasing a Cute Box loot box, the user gets a potential return of $5,000 and $250 in BIG tokens. The 250% bonus code will run for a limited time only as the project nears its live launch.\n\nBig Eyes Coin Loot Boxes offers its community a maximum ROI of 5000% per loot box and features the Saver Tin, Cute Box, Kitty Vault, Super Saiyan Box, and Excali-Paw Master Chest. Each loot box carries a maximum return of $500, $5000, $25,000, $100,000, and $1,000,000 worth of BIG tokens, respectively.\n\nFind out more about Big Eyes Coin (BIG):\n\nPresale: https://buy.bigeyes.space/\n\nWebsite: https://bigeyes.space/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/BIGEYESOFFICIAL\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

This digital wallet, built upon the Ethereum blockchain, will allow users to store and hold Ether tokens and other Ethereum-based cryptocurrencies.\n\nAs part of its functionality, Microsoft has rolled out a trial version of this wallet, cautioning testers against putting in big amounts for now since the feature is still under development.\n\nSocial media has been abuzz with screenshots of Microsoft\u2019s wallet test, revealing that the digital wallet appears to be non-custodial. This means users will own their private keys and have full control of their funds. The software giant has accelerated its exploration of Web3 elements, and this digital wallet is a part of that exploration\n\nNewest in the gauntlet of questionable upcoming Microsoft Edge features, a crypto wallet ????\n\nNot really sure how to feel about this kind of thing being baked into the default browser, what are your thoughts?\n\nMore screenshots of the UI in the next tweet \u27a1\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/GAUPiZGLIY \u2014 Albacore (@thebookisclosed) March 17, 2023\n\nAfter finally releasing, the new native crypto wallet included natively with Edge would rival the most used Web3 wallet addon, Metamask. Bleeping Computer, a tech portal that had the opportunity to test the wallet, reported that the wallet supports different Ethereum accounts, allowing users to switch between them as desired.\n\nFurthermore, the wallet can be used with existing Web3 apps and includes a built-in Ethereum exchange that supports ETH, DAI, UNI, USDC, and USDT. Although the software contains strings that hint at the future inclusion of a Bitcoin wallet, this functionality is not yet available. Microsoft has not confirmed the existence of the crypto wallet.\n\nAt Microsoft, we regularly test new features to explore new experiences for our customers. We look forward to learning and collecting feedback from customers but have nothing further to share at this time.\n\nA firm representative said:\n\n\u201cAt Microsoft, we regularly test new features to explore new experiences for our customers. We look forward to learning and collecting feedback from customers but have nothing further to share at this time\u201d\n\nMicrosoft has been actively involved in supporting Web3-related projects. In particular, the company has played a significant role in establishing standards for the metaverse. Moreover, Microsoft has introduced metaverse features in its Teams app, which has helped users to experience the virtual world in a more engaging and immersive way.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s exploration of Web3 elements like the metaverse and the recent testing of a crypto wallet on its Edge browser, built upon the Ethereum blockchain, marks a significant step towards the mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies. While cautioning testers against putting in big amounts due to the feature being still under development, the digital wallet appears to be non-custodial, giving users full control of their funds."
