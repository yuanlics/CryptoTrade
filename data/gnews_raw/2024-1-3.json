Our opinions are always our own.\n\nCryptocurrencies are digital assets that are created and run on a blockchain.\n\nBitcoin and ether are two popular cryptocurrencies, but there are many others.\n\nInvesting in cryptocurrency can be extremely risky, and the underlying technology is very new.\n\nNEW LOOK Sign up to get the inside scoop on today\u2019s biggest stories in markets, tech, and business \u2014 delivered daily.

Unlike banknotes or minted coins that have a tangible physical form, cryptocurrencies can only be accessed using computers and other electronic devices.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA decentralized currency is a currency not issued by a government or financial institution. In fact, no single person, company, or government controls a crypto's blockchain. Instead, it's run by a decentralized network of computers worldwide. Anyone with advanced technology skills and coding experience can create a cryptocurrency.\n\nThe lack of a central authority can also make cryptocurrencies more secure. \"It's hack-proof because there's no one central point of failure,\" explains David Donovan, executive vice president at Publicis Sapient.\n\nHow do cryptocurrencies work?\n\nWhile there are thousands of cryptocurrencies, many with unique traits, they all tend to work in similar ways. It's hard to avoid some jargon when discussing cryptos, but the concepts can be relatively easy to understand.\n\nBlockchain technology\n\nA cryptocurrency's blockchain is a digital record of all the transactions involving that crypto. Copies of the blockchain are stored and maintained by computers around the world. They're often compared to general ledgers, part of traditional double-entry bookkeeping systems where each transaction leads to debit and credit in different sections of the books.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"It works like a general ledger \u2014 it's that simple,\" says Donovan. Perhaps you start with two coins and send one to someone. \"On the blockchain, it would say I'm sending you one coin, and I now have one coin, and you have one coin.\"\n\nEach grouping of transactions is turned into a block and chained to the existing ledger. Once a block is added it can't be reversed or altered \u2014 which is why people describe blockchains as \"immutable.\"\n\nSome cryptos have their own blockchain. For example, there are Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains. But there are also cryptos that are built on top of an existing blockchain rather than starting from zero.\n\nEther is the cryptocurrency native to the Ethereum blockchain, but is also available for trading on other exchanges like Coinbase, Binance.US, and Robinhood.\n\nPublic transactions under pseudonymous\n\nCryptocurrencies have another defining feature. The blockchains are public ledgers, which means anyone can see and review the transactions that occurred. However, they can also provide a degree of anonymity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"You have a private key, which is how you initiate transactions, and a public key, which is how someone identifies you in the market,\" says Donovan.\n\nA blockchain's transactions are tied to a crypto wallet's public key, but nobody necessarily knows who controls that wallet. This is why cryptos are often described as pseudonymous \u2014 the public key is a person's pseudonym.\n\nComing to consensus Cryptocurrencies commonly use one of two mechanisms to create a system of trust and determine which transactions are valid and added to their blockchain:\n\n\n\nProof of work . This relies on people around the world, known as miners, competing to be first to solve complex cryptographic puzzles and add the next block to the blockchain. The winners are paid after the other members of the network confirm that the required amount of computing power was used to find the solution. \"The way you make sure all the participants are validating the transactions is the hard work, effort, and money they're spending solving the problem,\" says Donna Parisi, global head of financial services and FinTech at Shearman & Sterling. However, proof-of-work systems require a lot of energy to power.\n\n.

However, proof-of-work systems require a lot of energy to power. Proof of stake. This is a newer and less energy-intensive mechanism. \"Proof of stake is they validate transactions on the blockchain by people putting value on the line,\" explains Parisi. \"They stake some of the currency they own to make sure they only validate true transactions.\"\n\nTypes of cryptocurrencies\n\nAccording to CoinMarketCap, there were more than 25,149 different cryptocurrencies with a global market value of about $1.16 trillion as of May 30, 2023. Some of the most popular cryptocurrencies include:\n\nBitcoin\n\nDogecoin\n\nEther\n\nLitecoin\n\nTether\n\nBinance coin\n\nDai\n\nTRON\n\nCronos\n\nUSD coin\n\nBitcoin cash\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBitcoin, the first cryptocurrency, was launched in 2009 as an alternative type of decentralized and digital money. Since then, people have also created cryptocurrencies that serve other functions or are designed for specific types of transactions.\n\n\"Cryptocurrencies can have many different uses,\" says Parisi. \"Some are used in gaming environments to earn rewards in a game, while others facilitate payments. Some are designed for cross-border remittances \u2026 some are designed for micro payments.\"\n\nFor example, stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency that try to maintain a steady and fixed exchange rate with another asset, such as the US dollar. Governance tokens are another example of a specialized cryptocurrency. They give token holders voting power in a corresponding crypto project.\n\nInsider's Featured Crypto Apps Public Investing\n\nWealthfront Investing Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options.

This money has no physical equivalent, unlike tangible forms of currency like banknotes or minted coins. But just like physical money, digital currencies can be used to purchase goods and services.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, you'll be limited to online platforms and communities, such as investing platforms, gaming sites, and gambling portals. Some of the most popular forms of digital currency include cryptocurrencies, central bank digital currencies (CBDC), and stablecoins.\n\n\"There's a strive toward decentralization,\" says Nisa Amoils, a managing partner at A100xx Ventures. \"Digital currencies like cryptocurrencies continue to be a worthwhile investment for many investors.\"\n\nDigital currencies come in two forms:\n\nCentralized currency: Currencies issued by governments or financial institutions as part of the commercial banking system that are available to the general public.\n\nCurrencies issued by governments or financial institutions as part of the commercial banking system that are available to the general public. Decentralized currency: Currencies not issued by governments or financial institutions. Instead, decentralized currencies operate through peer-to-peer financial networks to eliminate the middleman (aka banks) and allow lending, trading, and borrowing directly with merchants.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDigital currencies like crypto are often appealing to investors who are wary of government-issued funds and are that are seeking alternatives.\n\n\"Some people who had been excluded from the traditional financial system, or have had their currencies devalued, are seeking an opportunity to participate in the markets, and this is a retail-driven phenomenon first,\" says Amoils. \"There's this crisis of trust, and people want wealth creation for themselves. And so that spurred this whole kind of trading speculative movement.\"\n\nHow to invest in cryptocurrency\n\nYou can start investing in cryptocurrencies through existing crypto exchanges and investing platforms. Some of the best cryptocurrency exchanges (such as Kraken and Coinbase) offer assets like staking rewards, goal-planning features, low fees, and more.\n\nSome of the best investment apps that offer cryptocurrencies (such as Robinhood Investing) include a range of investment types, low fees, market access, and more.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou can create your own crypto\n\nAnyone with coding skills and/or advanced technical knowledge can create their own cryptocurrencies \u2014 although this is not always an easy feat and isn't recommended for beginners. The three ways to create crypto are:\n\nBuilding a new blockchain: The most advanced way to create crypto, but offers the most flexibility of nodes, architecture, tokenomics, and more.\n\nThe most advanced way to create crypto, but offers the most flexibility of nodes, architecture, tokenomics, and more.

Still, this method requires expansive technical knowledge.\n\nIf you can't create your own blockchain, you can modify an existing blockchain's open-source code to your liking. Still, this method requires expansive technical knowledge. Building upon a blockchain: The simplest way to make your own coins or tokens is by expanding upon an already existing blockchain. But keep in mind that the success of your cryptocurrency will be reliant on the success of the original blockchain. Some blockchains that allow this are Binance and Ethereum.\n\nAre cryptocurrencies secure?\n\nThe blockchain technology behind cryptocurrencies can help ensure that the coins and systems remain secure. \"What's never been refuted is the value of blockchain,\" says Donovan. \"The way the ledger system is set up and every transaction is recorded. And the fact that it's immutable.\"\n\nHowever, that doesn't mean you don't need to worry about security. The crypto world is rife with scams. Of course, that's also true of traditional financial systems and currencies. Someone asking you to pay with a gift card or wire transfer is a red flag that you're dealing with a scammer. But several factors could make crypto scams especially worrisome.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor example, cryptocurrency transactions can't be reversed. There's also less regulation of cryptocurrencies and platforms than of traditional financial services in the US. Plus, some people may feel pressure to act quickly and send or invest their money because they're worried about missing out on an opportunity.\n\n\"One way to avoid a scam is to invest in more well-established cryptocurrencies,\" says Parisi. \"You still may be subject to scams or fraud in terms of how you hold it, send it, or receive it.\" But you can have some certainty that the cryptocurrency itself isn't a scam.\n\nAre cryptocurrencies a good investment?\n\nCryptocurrencies may present a good investment opportunity, and there are many ways to invest in the crypto world.\n\nYou could buy a coin (or coins) and hold onto them, hoping they'll increase in value. Or you could use your coins in a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform to earn interest through staking or lending. You also might take a more traditional route, such as an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that is tied to cryptocurrencies. There could even be opportunities to invest in projects or supporting industries rather than in the cryptocurrencies themselves.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"From an investment perspective, crypto is rapidly evolving,\" says Parisi. \"You shouldn't put an amount of assets you're not willing to lose. It should be, relatively speaking, a small portion of your portfolio.\"\n\nBefore making any investment, consider the potential pros and cons:\n\nPros Cons Easy to invest\n\nDiversify your portfolio\n\nThere is a lot of opportunity\n\nFaster and cost-effective transactions\n\nDecentralized currency\n\nSecurity and transparency through the blockchain Cryptocurrencies can be very volatile\n\nSome crypto projects may fail\n\nThe investment may be a scam\n\nEnvironmental impact due to excessive power consumption through ASIC computers\n\nLacking refund and cancellation policies\n\nShould you invest in crypto?\n\nWhile cryptocurrency investing is a hotly debated topic, it's worth understanding what's going on so you can make an informed decision. If you decide to get started, you could fully jump in or just dip your toe.\n\n\"Learn about crypto by opening up wallets, accounts, trading currencies, and learning more about the use cases,\" says Parisi. \"But do it in a reasonable way. We're still in the early days, and regulation of crypto is still evolving.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDonovan suggests opening an account with a regulated and publicly traded company like Coinbase. But, he says, \"It's really about being smart and using the system to take baby steps.\"\n\nCrypto FAQs\n\nWhat is Bitcoin? Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options. Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency, an electronic version of money that verifies transactions using cryptography (the science of encoding and decoding information). As Bitcoin educator, developer, and entrepreneur Jimmy Song says, Bitcoin is \"decentralized, digital, and scarce money.\" Bitcoin is decentralized because this code is run by thousands of computers (i.e., 'nodes') spread across the globe, digital because it exists as a set of code that determines how it operates, and scarce because its code caps its overall volume to 21 million bitcoins. When you use bitcoin to buy something, it records the transaction on a blockchain, which is essentially a ledger or database whose entries can't be modified or erased.\n\nWhat is Ethereum? Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options. Ethereum is an open-source, decentralized computing platform network. The Ethereum network works like the Bitcoin network in that it's built on blockchain technology, essentially a digital public ledger where financial agreements can be verified and stored entirely by software \u2014 without the intervention of a third party.\n\nWhat are privacy coins? Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options. Privacy coins are cryptocurrencies that obscure transactions on their blockchain to maintain the anonymity of users and their activity. Participants in a transaction will know the amount transacted and the parties involved. However, the same information will be unobtainable to any outside observer. The anonymity that privacy coins provide offers a potentially appealing outlet for money laundering or other criminal transactions. As such, privacy coins are a point of contention in the ongoing debate around cryptocurrency privacy and regulation.\n\nWhat is a crypto wallet? Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options. A crypto wallet is a software program or physical device that allows you to store your crypto and allow for the sending and receiving of crypto transactions. A crypto wallet consists of two key pairs: private keys and public keys. A public key is derived from the private key and serves as the address used to send crypto to the wallet. The important part of a wallet \u2014 and the part where new users often find themselves getting into trouble \u2014 is the private key. A private key is like the key to a safe deposit box. Anyone who has access to the private key of a wallet can take control of the balance held there. But unlike a safe deposit box, crypto users who hold their own private keys and make transactions using non-custodial wallets (i.e., a wallet not hosted by an exchange or other third-party) become their own bank.\n\nWhat is hash rate? Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options. Hash rate is a measure of the total computational power being used by a proof-of-work cryptocurrency network to process transactions in a blockchain. It can also be a measure of how fast a cryptocurrency miner's machines complete these computations. Miners use computers to run computations on complex mathematical puzzles based on transaction data. These systems generate millions or trillions of guesses per second as to what the solutions to these puzzles could be. These are hashes, alphanumeric codes randomized to identify a single, unique piece of data.\n\nWhat is yield farming? Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options. Yield farming is a means of earning interest on your cryptocurrency, similar to how you'd earn interest on any money in your savings account. And similarly to depositing money in a bank, yield farming involves locking up your cryptocurrency, called \"staking,\" for a period of time in exchange for interest or other rewards, such as more cryptocurrency.\n\nWhat is crypto staking? Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options. Crypto staking is similar to depositing money in a bank, in that an investor locks up their assets, and in exchange, earns rewards, or \"interest.\" \"Staking is a term used to refer to the delegating of a certain number of tokens to the governance model of the blockchain and thus locking them out of circulation for a specified length of time,\" says Nicole DeCicco, the owner and founder of CryptoConsultz, a cryptocurrency consultancy in the Portland, Oregon area. A particular network's protocol locks up an investor's holdings \u2014 similar to depositing money in a bank, and agreeing not to withdraw it for a set time period, which benefits the network in a couple of ways, according to DeCicco. First, this can increase the value of a token by limiting the supply. Second, the tokens can be used to govern the blockchain if the network uses a proof-of-stake (PoS) system. A PoS system \u2014 as opposed to a proof-of-work (PoW) one, which incorporates \"mining\" \u2014 can be fairly complicated, especially for crypto newcomers."

        "content": "Solana NFT Sales Overtake Ethereum for the First Time Ever in December\n\nSolana's NFT sales volume surpassed that of Ethereum in December 2023, marking the first time this has occurred. According to data from CryptoSlam, Solana's NFT sales reached approximately $366.5 million, while Ethereum's sales totaled $353.2 million.\n\nWhen excluding wash trades, Solana's sales remained strong at $366.5 million, nearly matching its all-time high of $373.5 million set in October 2021. In contrast, Ethereum's sales were relatively flat, with December's total being comparable to November's $350 million.\n\nFurthermore, Solana saw an increased number of unique traders, with around 218,000 unique sellers and 279,000 buyers. That is nearly double the number of unique traders compared to Ethereum.\n\nThe surge in Solana's NFT sales may be attributed to the significant rise in the value of its native token, SOL, which has more than quadrupled in price over the past three months. This has also led to the resurgence of the Solana ecosystem, coupled with a memecoin frenzy led by Bonk (BONK).\n\nThe influx of users and transactions on Solana may be driven by broader momentum around the network and the hype surrounding specific projects offering potential airdrops and other perks. Projects like Tensorians and Mad Lads generated substantial trading volume in December, contributing to Solana's overall success.\n\nLet us know what you loved about this article, what could be improved, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form."

        "title": "Does Ethereum's flash crash to $2K mean ETH's bullish momentum is gone? - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Ether (ETH) price faced a substantial 14% correction on Jan. 3, as the price dropped from $2,380 to $2,050 in less than 2 hours. This price level had not been seen since Dec. 1, 2023 and the unexpected swing led to the liquidation of $100 million worth of ETH long future contracts, which were leveraged bets on the price increase.\n\nTraders are now questioning the significance of this price correction and whether it signals the end of the bullish momentum following three unsuccessful attempts to break above $2,400 in the past month. Coincidentally, this was also the third time that Ether's price dropped below $2,150 during the same period, making it hard to argue that the bullish momentum is over.\n\nEther (ETH) price index, 12-hour, USD. Source: TradingView\n\nThe first noteworthy observation from the price chart is the swift recovery to $2,230 on Jan. 3, suggesting that whatever triggered the panic selling and derivatives liquidations has weakened. Some argue that the trigger was a market analysis released on Jan. 3 pointing to the denial of the spot Bitcoin ETF, published by Matrixport. Notably, the digital assets platform Matrixport was co-founded by Jihan Wu, who is known for his highly successful venture in the ASIC miner business at Bitmain.\n\nMore importantly, investors are factoring in the latest comments from Eric Balchunas, a senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg. Balchunas stated in an interview with Cointelegraph that approval odds remain at 90%. However, he reiterated that it might take longer for the final decision from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to be reached. In essence, the markets have reacted excessively in both directions: showing excessive confidence in the Jan. 10 deadline and failing to differentiate Matrixport analysts' opinions from actual news and events.\n\nAttorney and commercial litigator Joe Carlasare perfectly encapsulated the situation in a social network post.\n\nI know people are desperate for a narrative, but Bitcoin didn\u2019t sell off because of some silly report about ETF denial.\n\n\n\nIt sold off because nothing goes straight up and it\u2019s an easy grab for liquidity to do a long squeeze. In short, the market was overbought. \u2014 Joe Carlasare (@JoeCarlasare) January 3, 2024\n\nAccording to Carlasare, \"the market was overbought,\" indicating that buyers were using excessive leverage, making bulls an easy target for whales and market makers. This conclusion can be drawn from an analysis of the ETH monthly futures annualized premium, which should typically range between 5% and 10% in healthy markets.\n\nEther 1-month futures annualized futures premium. Source: Laevitas.ch\n\nThe data indicates a growing demand for leveraged ETH long positions, as the futures contract premium surged from 11% on Dec. 18, 2023, to 27% on Jan. 2, 2024. However, sustaining such positions for longer periods became costly for buyers. This surge in the metric followed a 15% rally in ETH's price during that period.\n\nThe last time Ether bulls experienced such a significant loss in the futures markets was on August 17, 2023, when $170 million worth of long positions were liquidated. A similar intraday 15% correction occurred, dropping the price from $1,800 to $1,530, but ETH quickly rebounded to $1,680 within two hours. However, the price recovery did not hold in the medium term, as ETH revisited the $1,530 bottom on Sept. 11, 2023.\n\nRelated: Matrixport founder says dissemination of Bitcoin ETF report was \u2018beyond our control\u2019\n\nTo better gauge the exposure of whales and arbitrage desks using derivatives, one must assess Ether options volume. By examining the put (sell) and call (buy) options, we can estimate the prevailing bullish or bearish sentiment.\n\nETH options put-to-call volume ratio at Deribit. Source: Laevitas\n\nWith the exception of a brief period on Dec. 19, 2023, ETH put options have consistently lagged behind call options in terms of volume, approximately by a factor of two. This suggests reduced demand for protective strategies, reinforcing the confidence and excessive optimism observed in the Ether futures markets.\n\nThe cause of the 14% flash crash on Jan. 3 may never be definitively determined. However, judging by Ether derivatives markets, it appears that investors became overconfident and relied heavily on excessive leverage. This does not necessarily invalidate Ether's bull run or make gains above the $2,400 resistance less likely before the ETF decision. Data indicates that the market is healthier, at least from a derivatives perspective.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "title": "Ethereum, Solana, and XRP Are Slumping Today. Here's Why. - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Well, that rally to end 2023 and into early 2024 had to end at some point.\n\nMany of the top cryptocurrencies in the market are reeling today, as risk assets across the board decline on a variety of headwinds. Ethereum (ETH 1.28%), Solana (SOL -1.43%), and XRP (XRP 4.57%) are among the tokens to watch for crypto investors, having declined 6.7%, 9.2%, and 8.4%, respectively, over the past 24 hours at 3 p.m. ET.\n\nA number of macro forces are driving most long-duration assets lower today. A strengthening U.S. dollar, a decline in long bonds (and corresponding surge in yields), and a widespread rotation to more defensive assets has plagued more speculative asset classes such as crypto over the past 24 to 48 hours.\n\nAdditionally, these three tokens have their own set of headwinds investors appear to be pricing in today. Let's dive into what's driving this move in these three top-10 digital assets right now.\n\nI thought this was a crypto bull market -- what gives?\n\nA good portion of the recent rise in crypto assets over the past few months can be attributed to expectations about a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) approval. Expected by Jan. 10, such an ETF could pave the way for similar products for Ethereum (given there are proposals already underway) and potentially other major tokens such as Solana and XRP to follow.\n\nAccordingly, a narrative shift among many in the crypto market over the past day or so is wreaking havoc on investors relying on this catalyst. Some analysts and experts, such as Matrixport's Markus Thielen, believe that an ultimate approval for a spot Bitcoin ETF may still be a \"long shot.\"\n\nThis view appears to be spreading, with an increase in bearish bets on top cryptocurrencies driving some of the accelerated downside move today. Additionally, nearly $100 million in bullish perpetual contracts placed on Ethereum have been liquidated over the past 24 hours, as per Coinglass. XRP and Solana are also among the top five crypto tokens in terms of long liquidations today, suggesting leveraged upside bets on these tokens are turning sour.\n\nFundamentals weakening\n\nIn addition to the leveraged derivatives market, another key fundamental factor many investors consider when gauging the health of the crypto market over a specific time frame is total value locked (TVL). TVL generally reflects the amount of capital existing within specific crypto ecosystems. When times are good, capital flows into the crypto sector, and this number rises.\n\nUnfortunately, since the beginning of the year, the total TVL for all crypto projects has dropped 5.8% to $52.49 billion. Ethereum, Solana, and XRP saw similar declines in their TVL values, though these three projects have still seen their cumulative TVL numbers rally nicely off of last year's lows.\n\nWhile many still expect that a spot Bitcoin ETF could be approved in short order (partly due to various meetings between Wall Street companies and the SEC in recent days), investors and users appear to be taking a cautious approach with their capital right now.\n\nBottom line\n\nOverall, the crypto sector, and many of its top tokens, appear to be feeling the effects of uncertainty today. At the end of the day, investing is about assessing probabilities. And up until a couple of days ago, the market seemed to be pretty certain that spot ETFs are coming in short order, leading to risk-on trades across this sector in projects that may follow Bitcoin's lead.\n\nThe expected decision date is now about a week away. Until then, I expect more volatility on the horizon, as additional leaks filter into the overall narrative for this sector."

        "content": "Pectra is set to bolster decentralization by introducing statelessness through Verkle Trees\n\nBy: Samuel Haig \u2022 Loading...\n\nDeFi News\n\nOn Jan. 4, Ethereum developers wrapped up the first All Core Devs Execution (ACDE) call for 2024.\n\nDates for Dencun\u2019s testnet deployments were locked in during the meeting, starting with a Goerli deployment on Jan. 17. Follow-up deployments are set to go live on Sepolia and Holesky on Jan. 30 and Feb. 7 respectively.\n\nDissenters argued that 13 days may not provide sufficient time for any requisite changes to be made based on observations from the Goerli launch. However, the next ACDE call is slated for Jan. 18, meaning the scheduling could be adjusted should developers encounter any issues during the 24 hours proceeding the Goerli fork.\n\n\u201cMost other clients felt the timeline, albeit somewhat aggressive, was acceptable,\u201d tweeted Go Ethereum, an Ethereum client provider. \u201cAssuming all goes well, expect client releases for Goerli next week and for Sepolia/Holesky the week of Jan. 22.\u201d\n\nDencun will usher a significant reduction in transaction fees for Layer 2 rollups by replacing calldata with less gas-intensive blobs via EIP-4844, also known as proto-danksharding, improving data availability on Layer 2.\n\nThe Verge\n\nThe meeting then discussed what measures should be prioritized in Ethereum\u2019s following upgrade, Pectra. Go Ethereum noted that all client teams are in favor of focusing on introducing Verkle Trees \u2014 a data structure enabling the network to become stateless, meaning clients will not need to store Ethereum\u2019s entire state history in order to validate blocks.\n\nSpeaking at the Ethereum Community Conference in July 2022, Vitalik Buterin said instituting Verkle Trees, also called \u201cThe Verge\u201d, will bolster the network\u2019s decentralization by reducing the hardware requirements associated with becoming a validator.\n\n\u201cYou will be able to verify Ethereum blocks and even be a validator without having hundreds of gigabytes on your disc, which is great for decentralization,\u201d Buterin said.\n\nGo Ethereum tweeted that the introduction of Verkle Trees will likely require more than 12 months for development at minimum, meaning Pectra is unlikely to go live in 2024. Lightclient estimated Verkle Trees could take between 18 and 24 months to realize.\n\nOther Ethereum Improvement Proposals may also be included in Pectra."

This is Milk Road, the newsletter that drops crypto insights faster than you can say Worcestershire Sauce.\n\nHere\u2019s what\u2019s on the menu today:\n\nEthereum\u2019s new roadmap \ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f\n\nThese NFT holders just got airdropped some company equity \ud83d\udcb0\n\n\u201cBitcoin can\u2019t be killed\u201d \u2013 Jim Cramer \ud83d\udde3\ufe0f\n\nCrypto exchange volume cracks $1T for the first time since 2022 \ud83c\udf6a\n\nETHEREUM\u2019S 2024 ROADMAP \ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f\n\nEthereum\u2019s latest roadmap dropped last week.\n\nIt\u2019s broken up into 6 parts\u2026 The Merge, The Surge, The Scourge, The Verge, The Purge, and The Splurge. (Is this a roadmap or Dr. Seuss\u2019 long-lost book?)\n\nWithout further adieu, here\u2019s what it looks like:\n\nNow, if you\u2019re anything like me (average IQ and proud), your reaction to seeing the image above was probably something along the lines of\u2026\n\n\u2026 but don\u2019t you worry. This is Milk Road. We help you get smarter about crypto, without ever making you feel dumb.\n\nSo here\u2019s the Ethereum Roadmap for Dummies:\n\n1/ The Merge. Goal = move to a decentralized proof-of-stake consensus.\n\nThis makes ETH more environmentally friendly, deflationary, and introduces a sustainable staking yield. (Btw, this happened back in Sept. 2022).\n\n2/ The Surge. Goal = Increase transactions per second (TPS) to over 100,000.\n\nThis makes Layer 2s faster and cheaper for users and opens up unique use cases that depend on high TPS. (Many projects have been waiting for this upgrade to launch on L2s).\n\n3/ The Scourge. Goal = mitigate centralization concerns in the Ethereum PoS design (particularly around MEV and liquid staking).\n\nL2s and liquid staking have gotten a lot of heat for \u201ctaking away\u201d from Ethereum\u2019s decentralization lately. The Scourge is aimed at solving this.\n\n4/ The Verge. Goal = make verifying blocks easier (i.e. download data, perform a few basic computations, verify, and you\u2019re done).\n\nThis leads to more efficient data and node structure.\n\nMore efficient data causes less congestion on the network and allows it to scale more easily.\n\nA more efficient node structure allows easier participation for the average user. Right now you need 32 ETH to run a node, or you need to pay a service fee to a liquid staking provider.\n\n5/ The Purge. Goal = to simplify the protocol, eliminate technical debt, and limit costs of participating in the network by cleaning old history.\n\nThis purifies old network data and makes the network more efficient overall.\n\n6/ The Splurge. Goal = fix everything else.\n\nThis is where smaller updates will be made to ensure everything runs smoothly from previous updates. Vitalik calls this \u201cthe fun stuff\u201d since all the hard work is done by this stage.\n\nThis roadmap will likely take several years to complete, but it\u2019s still pretty cool to see where Ethereum has been, where it is today, and where it\u2019s headed in the future.\n\nP.S. \u2013 if you want to see what other Ethereum improvements are happening this year, you can check \u2018em out here.\n\nTHE BEST DEFI APP YOU\u2019VE NEVER HEARD OF What happens when you combine the power and speed of the XPR Network and the expertise of Metallicus?

Side note: The NFTs will also remain CC0, a way for creators to give up their copyright.\n\nPretty cool. But, I know what you\u2019re thinking\u2026 is this legal?\n\nShort answer: Yes. (And if you want a longer answer, check out this Q&A thread).\n\nThe key \u201cloophole\u201d is that no one knew about it. It was a surprise. (And one helluva surprise at that).\n\nThis means\u2026 holders didn\u2019t buy the NFTs with any anticipation of receiving any company equity.\n\nMilk Road Take: Many NFT collections sold out with hopes of turning into businesses or brands that are \u201cowned by the community\u201d, but that hasn\u2019t really panned out\u2026 until now.\n\nIt\u2019ll be interesting to see if other NFT collections (finally) do it and follow in The Plague and Rektguys\u2019 footsteps.\n\n\u201cBITCOIN CAN\u2019T BE KILLED\u201d \u2013 JIM CRAMER \ud83d\udde3\ufe0f\n\nJim Cramer is back at it. He\u2019s talking about Bitcoin on TV again.\n\nExcept this time, he said it can\u2019t be killed and it\u2019s \u201chere to stay\u201d\u2026\n\nNow, usually, people talking about Bitcoin on national TV is a good thing\u2026 but not in this case. This is an investor\u2019s worst nightmare.\n\nThat\u2019s because Jimbo here is known for having the Anti-Midas Touch\u2122\u2026\n\nEverything he touches turns into gold sh*t.\n\nIn 2008, Jim famously said: \u201cBear Stearns is fine! Do not take your money out.\u201d A week later, it collapsed and kicked off a financial crisis. Bear Stearns was indeed not fine.\n\nIn 2012, Jim predicted companies like Best Buy and Netflix would crash. They both jumped over 120% within 6 months.\n\nLast year, Jim defended Silicon Valley Bank and said concerns about it were \u201cnot justified.\u201d A month later, it collapsed and became the biggest banking failure since 2008.\n\nWell, looks like this is might end of the road for Bitcoin. It was fun while it lasted. R.I.P.\n\nIt\u2019s survived attacks from the media, hackers, government, and grandmas all calling it \u201cthe devil\u2019s tech\u201d.\n\nBut it now faces its toughest battle yet\u2026 Jim Cramer\u2019s bullishness. *gulp*\n\nBITE-SIZED COOKIES FOR THE ROAD \ud83c\udf6a\n\nAlternative Assets are hot right now.

ETH is up for three consecutive days and is currently hovering around the $2,376 mark. The leading altcoin is gearing up for a breakout and another leg-up could take it to the $2,500 level.\n\nAlso Read: 25 New Countries Ready To Join BRICS in 2024\n\nWhile 2024 started positively for Bitcoin and the larger cryptocurrency market, will the momentum hold strong throughout the year? In this article, we will highlight how high Ethereum could trade in the indices this year in 2024.\n\nEthereum: How High Could ETH Trade In 2024?\n\nSource: CNN\n\nLeading on-chain metrics and price prediction firm Changelly has painted a rosy picture for Ethereum in 2024. The forecast estimates that ETH might sustainably scale up in the indices in the next 12 months.\n\nAlso Read: 5 U.S. Sectors To Be Affected If BRICS Ditches the Dollar For Trade\n\nAccording to the price prediction, ETH could reach a new yearly high of $3,988 in 2024. That\u2019s an uptick and return on investment of about 65% from its current price of $2,376. Therefore, an investment of $10,000 today could turn into $16,500 if the prediction becomes accurate.\n\nSource: Changelly\n\nThe positive prediction has taken into consideration the upcoming Bitcoin ETH, which could soon be approved by the SEC. However, if the Bitcoin ETF fails to make a debut, then the prices of BTC and ETH could head south.\n\nAlso Read: Shiba Inu, Bitcoin & Ethereum: 3 Boldest Price Predictions For 2024\n\nMost importantly, the cryptocurrency markets are subjected to extreme volatility and cuts both ways delivering losses to investors. There is no guarantee that ETH could rise 65% and reach $3,988 this year in 2024. It is advised to do thorough research before taking an entry position into ETH at the moment.\n\nAt press time, Ethereum was trading at $2,376 and is up close to 0.5% in the 24-hours day trade. ETH is down nearly 51% from its all-time high of $4,878, which it reached in November 2021."

Values are highly volatile. Never invest more than you can afford to lose. This site does not provide financial advice. Act based on your own research and consult with a financial professional before making decisions. Don\u2019t invest unless you\u2019re prepared to lose all the money you invest.\n\nChoosing the Right Platform\n\nFirst things first, to buy Ethereum, you\u2019ll need a reliable Ethereum exchange to facilitate your transactions. There are various options available, each with its pros and cons. Here are three common methods:\n\nExchanges\n\nCrypto exchanges are digital platforms where you can buy, sell, and trade cryptocurrencies. They offer user-friendly interfaces, providing access to a wide range of digital assets, including Ethereum. Some popular exchanges include Coinbase, Binance, and Kraken.\n\nPeer-to-Peer (P2P) Transactions\n\nP2P platforms connect buyers and sellers directly, allowing you to negotiate the terms of the trade. This method often provides more privacy and flexibility but requires extra caution to avoid scams. Paxful is one of the popular P2P platforms.\n\nGift Cards\n\nBelieve it or not, you can even buy Ethereum using gift cards! Some platforms allow you to exchange gift cards for Ethereum. While it might be a less conventional method, it can be useful if you have unused gift cards lying around.\n\nChoosing a Payment Method\n\nOnce you\u2019ve selected a platform, it\u2019s time to select a payment method. Different platforms offer various options, including credit cards and e-Wallets.\n\nCredit/Debit Cards\n\nMany trading apps accept credit and debit card payments for instant Ethereum purchases. Bank cards are quick and convenient for beginners, but keep in mind that fees may be higher than other payment options. Visa and Mastercard are the top acceptable bank cards. Luckily, these are known for their stringent security measures.\n\nBank Transfers\n\nWith lower fees, bank transfers are a more cost-effective way to buy Ethereum. However, the process might take a bit longer, usually a few business days. If credit cards are not available in your region, bank transfer is an excellent option. Since this payment method asks you for your bank account details, we recommend you only use it at licensed cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nE-Wallets\n\nSome exchanges allow payments through third-party payment processors like PayPal, Skrill, or Neteller. These are convenient banking options since your deposits and withdrawals are processed fast. Also, you don\u2019t have to share your bank details with the exchange. In this sense, your financial data are guaranteed to remain private and safe.\n\nSetting Up a Payment Method\n\nOnce you\u2019ve decided on a payment method, you\u2019ll need to set it up on your chosen platform. Here\u2019s how:\n\nCredit/Debit Cards: Simply enter your card details as prompted on the platform. Some ETH trading sites may require additional verification for security purposes.\n\nSimply enter your card details as prompted on the platform.

The crypto trading site will likely make a small deposit to verify your account, which you\u2019ll need to confirm. E-Wallet: Link your payment processor account to the platform and follow any verification steps required.\n\nPlacing an Order\n\nWith your payment method set up, you\u2019re now ready to place an order for Ethereum. The process may vary slightly depending on the platform, but generally, it involves the following steps:\n\nStep 1: Enter the amount.

But before you start crypto-gambling or using Ethereum for other purposes, it\u2019s crucial to store it securely. Consider these secure storage options:\n\nHardware Wallets: Hardware wallets are physical devices that store your Ethereum offline, providing high security. Examples include Ledger and Trezor wallets.\n\nHardware wallets are physical devices that store your Ethereum offline, providing high security. Examples include Ledger and Trezor wallets.

        "content": "With Ethereum\u2019s price reaching $2,400, what factors drive the market? Let\u2019s analyze Ethereum (ETH) price predictions for 2024.\n\nEthereum (ETH) has been in the spotlight due to its quick price jumps since late Oct. 2023. On Jan. 2, ETH\u2019s price soared to $2,400, with market sentiment remaining strongly positive.\n\nA key development contributing to this surge is the highly anticipated EIP-4844 upgrade, enhancing Protodanksharding and scaling for layer-two networks.\n\nMoreover, analysts, including those from JPMorgan, are optimistic about Ethereum\u2019s capacity to outperform Bitcoin in 2024.\n\nAs we delve into Ethereum\u2019s evolving landscape, it\u2019s essential to consider these factors and their implications on the Ethereum forecast.\n\nFactors affecting ETH price\n\nSeveral key factors have influenced the recent performance of Ethereum, each contributing to its price trajectory in distinct ways:\n\nUnique addresses and long-term holders\n\nAs of Jan. 3, Ethereum\u2019s network has seen a continuous increase in unique addresses, now exceeding 250 million, a strong indicator of Ethereum\u2019s expanding user base.\n\nAdditionally, of the more than 120 million circulating supply of ETH, over 73% are held by long-term holders who have retained their holdings for a year or more, underscoring Ethereum\u2019s potential.\n\nYou might also like: Ethereum among major blockchains, dominating with 92.5% of total TVL\n\nFresh capital influx\n\nThe Ethereum market witnessed a shift in capital flows during the second week of December, with an influx of nearly $20 billion in capital in both ETH and Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nOver $19.7 billion are flowing into #Bitcoin and #Ethereum today! This is around the same capital inflow we saw back in December 2020 before $BTC surged from $18,000 to $65,000! pic.twitter.com/pBALVN0C2c \u2014 Ali (@ali_charts) December 14, 2023\n\nMoreover, the year-to-date fund flow for ETH went positive in Dec. 2023, showing renewed interest from fund managers.\n\nThis change suggests investors are increasingly looking towards Ethereum for investment opportunities\u200b\u200b, adding to the bullish ETH outlook.\n\nTechnological developments and upgrades\n\nEthereum\u2019s anticipated network upgrade in 2024, known as the Dencun Upgrade, is set to introduce enhancements aimed at boosting network efficiency, such as reducing transaction fees on the mainnet.\n\nThis upgrade is essential to the future of Ethereum, potentially easing congestion issues and optimizing the ecosystem for users and developers alike\u200b\u200b.\n\nRegulatory environment and ETF potential\n\nPost the approval of a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), the potential approval of an Ethereum-based spot ETF could be a game-changer for the Ethereum price forecast.\n\nThe approval of a spot ETF for Ethereum could boost investor confidence and market liquidity and contribute to Ethereum\u2019s growth trajectory\u200b.\n\nETH price action and analysis\n\nAs of Jan. 3, Ethereum is trading at about $2,380. Over the last year, its price has seen an impressive 95% increase, a strong indicator of its bullish Ethereum potential.\n\nEthereum price | Source: TradingView\n\nFurthermore, Ethereum is trading above its 200-day simple moving average (SMA) of $1,860, suggesting a bullish or positive trend.\n\nIn the short term, Ethereum shows a balance of power slightly in favor of the bulls. The price has not dropped below the 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of $2,270.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s crucial to note that selling pressure may intensify if the price doesn\u2019t ascend above the channel soon.\n\nIf the price breaks below this 20-day EMA, we could see it decline toward the 50-day SMA at $2,177 and potentially to the support level near $2,000.\n\nLooking at Ethereum\u2019s future, if Ethereum manages to break and close above its current channel, it will signal that the bulls are still in control.\n\nThis could lead the buyers to attempt pushing the price over $2,446 resistance levels, targeting a longer-term uptrend towards the $3,000 mark.\n\nETH price prediction\n\nEthereum\u2019s price forecasts are drawing significant attention from various industry analysts.\n\nVanEck, a notable investment firm, projects a substantial increase in Ethereum\u2019s network revenues, suggesting they could rise from $2.6 billion to $51 billion by 2030.\n\nBased on the premise that Ethereum might secure a 70% market share in smart contract protocols, VanEck\u2019s analysis points to an ethereum future price of approximately $11.8k in 2030.\n\nCrypto analyst Lark Davis provides a more bullish stance in his ETH price prediction. He speculates that if Ethereum mirrors or slightly underperforms its previous cycle\u2019s gains, the price could soar to about $15,000 per coin, considering a potential 200% gain from its high of $4,880 in November 2021.\n\nEthereum Will Make Millionaires In 2024, BUT Not How You Think pic.twitter.com/00YCLPyGCl \u2014 Lark Davis (@TheCryptoLark) December 25, 2023\n\nFor a nearer-term outlook, DigitalCoinPrice estimates Ethereum\u2019s price at around $5,149 in 2024, reflecting optimistic Ether projections.\n\nFAQs\n\nWill Ethereum go up or down in the short term? Given Ethereum\u2019s recent performance, including a price jump to $2,400 levels and a bullish market sentiment, there\u2019s a cautious optimism for a short-term rise. However, the crypto market is notoriously volatile, and you should always exercise caution. What are the long-term prospects for Ethereum? In the long run, the Ethereum future looks promising, especially with the anticipated Dencun Upgrade in 2024, which is expected to enhance network efficiency. If Ethereum breaks and holds above its current channel, it might attempt to cross the $2,446 resistance, aiming towards $3,000. However, you should never invest more than you can afford to lose, as the crypto market is extremely volatile. Is Ethereum a good investment now? Considering Ethereum\u2019s continuous growth in unique addresses, the influx of fresh capital, and technological upgrades, it presents as a potentially good investment. However, factors such as regulatory changes and market volatility should be considered, making it essential to approach with informed caution. Should I buy Ethereum? Whether to buy Ethereum should be based on your investment strategy and risk appetite. With its price above the 200-day SMA and positive ETH price prediction from analysts, there seems to be a bullish ETH outlook. But as with any investment, especially in volatile markets like crypto, it\u2019s advisable to conduct thorough research or consult with a financial expert.\n\nDisclosure: This article does not represent investment advice.

        "title": "Ethereum Price Momentum Reignites: Technical Signals Potential Surge To $2,600 - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Ethereum price retested the $2,440 resistance zone. ETH is consolidating gains and might soon attempt a fresh increase toward the $2,600 level.\n\nEthereum gained strength for a move above the $2,350 level.\n\nThe price is trading above $2,350 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere is a key bullish trend line forming with support near $2,360 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair could continue to rise if there is a clear move above $2,430 and $2,440.\n\nEthereum Price Remains Supported\n\nEthereum price started a decent increase above the $2,300 level, like Bitcoin. ETH gained pace for a move above the $2,350 level to move into a positive zone.\n\nThe price even climbed above the $2,400 level. However, the bears appeared near the $2,440 resistance zone. A high was formed near $2,430 and the price is now correcting gains. There was a move below the $2,400 level. The price declined below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2,260 swing low to the $2,430 high.\n\nHowever, Ethereum is still above $2,350 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is also a key bullish trend line forming with support near $2,360 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nOn the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $2,390 level. The first major resistance is now near $2,440. A close above the $2,440 resistance could send the price toward $2,500. The next key resistance is near $2,550. If there is a clear move above $2,550, there could be a drift toward $2,620. The next resistance sits at $2,650, above which Ethereum might rally and test the $2,800 zone.\n\nMore Downsides in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $2,440 resistance, it could continue to move down.

Excluding suspicious activities such as \u201cwash trading\u201d, this data underscores Solana\u2019s escalating influence in the NFT market.\n\nA notable rise in user engagement on the platform is evident, marked by an increase in both sellers and buyers. Sales volume nearly hit a record-breaking level, closely matching its all-time high during the bull run in October 2021.\n\nComparative Dynamics and Emerging Trends\n\nIn December, Ethereum\u2019s NFT sales remained stable, while Solana experienced a dramatic increase from its performance the previous month.\n\nA surge in Solana\u2019s price is credited to this upswing. As are the projects of Tensorians and Mad Lads. Meanwhile, Ethereum\u2019s flagship NFT collections, such as Bored Apes and Pudgy Penguins, continue to bolster the blockchain\u2019s sales statistics. And let\u2019s not forget Bitcoin Ordinals\u2019 rise, remarkably generating more trading volume than both Ethereum and Solana combined.\n\nStill, Solana\u2019s landmark achievement \u2014 surpassing Ethereum in NFT sales volume for the world\u2019s first time \u2014 signifies a pivotal moment in the evolution of Solana NFTs.\n\nWant more?

        "content": "Solana has continued its bullish sentiment in its ecosystem to flip Ethereum in the stablecoin market for the second week in a row, according to on-chain data. SOL\u2019s price gain has slowed in the past week, showing a negative 2.3% in a 7-day timeframe at the time of writing. However, stablecoin transfers on the Solana chain reveal the blockchain retaining its reputation as an Ethereum killer, registering more than $10.3 billion more trading volume in the last week.\n\nStablecoins Growing On Solana\n\nEthereum has mostly dominated the stablecoin market since the inception of Tether USDT. However, according to data from the crypto analytics platform Artemis, stablecoin trading volume on Solana surpassed Ethereum last week for the second week in a row, showing how quickly Solana is gaining traction. Solana registered $40.86 billion in stablecoin volume, compared to Ethereum\u2019s trading volume of $30.31 billion.\n\nOn-chain numbers since December demonstrate that SOL is quickly becoming the chain of choice for stablecoin usage and transactions. Solana surpassed Ethereum in stablecoin volume for the first time in the week leading to December 25. During this period, SOL registered a weekly stablecoin trading volume of $103.01 billion, $12.14 billion more than Ethereum\u2019s volume of $90.87 billion.\n\nSolana also went on a crazy surge last year, registering over a 950% gain as it reached a yearly high of $121. During this period, we saw Solana compete vigorously with Ethereum across various metrics.\n\nStablecoin trading volume, in particular, is at a 2,213% gain in a 3-month timeframe. The chain also witnessed 27.17 million stablecoin transactions in the same timeframe, compared to Ethereum\u2019s 1.17 million transactions.\n\nDeFi aggregator DeFiLlama also shows DEX trading volume on SOL soared to $28.13 billion in December, surpassing Ethereum L2 chains Arbitrum and Polygon. Solana also overtook Ethereum in NFT trading volume in early December.\n\n\n\nSOL Price To $200?\n\nThe Solana ecosystem is expanding quickly, as evidenced by price surges and on-chain metrics. The price surge can also be attributed to various airdrops and the hype surrounding BONK, the first meme coin on the Solana chain. As more people buy and trade SOL and other assets on the blockchain, demand for the SOL coin is likely to increase.\n\nRelated Reading: Is A Bitcoin Spot ETF Approval A Sell The News Event? Experts Respond\n\nAt the time of writing, SOL is trading at $107, down by 5.74% and 3.44% in the past 24 hours and seven days respectively. It is now facing resistance at around $115, and a failure to rally above this price point could lead to a continued consolation toward support at $100.\n\nWhile there are never any guarantees, SOL\u2019s strong fundamentals point to a potential price appreciation throughout the year and SOL\u2019s path to revisiting the $200 price level and beyond.\n\nIf Solana continues to also outpace Ethereum and Ethereum L2 chains on key metrics and grows its real-world utility, $200 could be on the horizon sooner than most investors would expect.\n\nSOL at $107 | Source: SOLUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nFeatured image from Securities.io, chart from Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "An Ethereum (ETH)-based altcoin is exploding in value after ETH founder Vitalik Buterin said the project is vital to the crypto ecosystem.\n\nButerin tells his five million followers on the social media platform X that all layer-2 (L2) projects should integrate with Ethereum Name Service (ENS), a platform that lets users buy a \u201cdomain name\u201d on the Ethereum blockchain rather than using default addresses.\n\nThe domain names on ENS can be used to transfer and receive funds instead of using alphanumeric wallet addresses.\n\nSays Buterin,\n\n\u201cAll L2s should be working on (trustless, merkle-proof-based) CCIP resolvers, so that we can have ENS subdomains registerable, updateable and readable directly on L2s.

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nVitalik Buterin has shared an updated Ethereum roadmap, highlighting plans for the platform\u2019s progress.\n\nIn 2023, Buterin noted that Ethereum\u2019s transition to proof-of-stake was a success, but added that it is yet to realize its full potential.\n\nThe updated roadmap reflects Ethereum\u2019s evolving needs and the current state of research and development.\n\nAlongside the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s official roadmap, which organizes the platform\u2019s development plans along four goal-oriented themes, since 2021, founder Vitalik Buterin has published his own annual road map in parallel.\n\nContinuing the tradition, on December 30 Buterin published the latest version of his Ethereum Roadmap, highlighting upgrades slated to transform the network in 2024 and beyond.\n\nDifferences Between Buterin\u2019s Roadmap and the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s\n\nAlthough they differ in form and function, alternative roadmaps proposed by Buterin and the Ethereum Foundation are aligned on their general purpose: outlining Ethereum\u2019s technical progress and plans for the future.\n\nBy popular demand, an updated roadmap diagram for 2023! pic.twitter.com/oxo58A2KuG \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) December 30, 2023\n\nThe Foundation\u2019s schema features four themes: improving user experience, enhancing security, driving down transaction costs and future-proofing the Ethereum (ETH) network. Meanwhile, Buterin\u2019s model is based around five overarching development goals. These are dubbed The Merge, The Surge, The Verge, The Scourge and The Purge.\n\nBecause the Foundation\u2019s approach is open-ended, pointing to abstract goals rather than specific targets, measuring progress can be difficult. The community may agree that a given upgrade has enhanced Ethereum\u2019s user experience or security, for example. But such improvements are better conceptualized as a journey than a destination.\n\nOn the other hand, Buterin\u2019s roadmap identifies key stages in Ethereum\u2019s development, making it easier to assess how far the platform has come and how far it still has to go before each one is complete.\n\nProof-of-Stake After The Merge\n\nAccording to one interpretation, The Merge was a single event that occurred on September 15, 2022. It was then that the Ethereum mainnet linked with the proof-of-stake Beacon Chain consensus layer.\n\nHowever, Buterin\u2019s roadmap sees the Merge as a more extensive change to Ethereum. It now embodies network participants\u2019 collective adoption of a new consensus mechanism. It also represents the ensuing changes needed to overcome current challenges and to realize the full potential of proof-of-stake.\n\nIn 2023, Ethereum\u2019s Shanghai/Capella upgrade enabled users to withdraw staked ETH for the first time.\n\nThe next Proof-of-Stake milestone identified by Buterin is the development of single slot finality (SSF). This should reduce the number of 12-second slots it takes to finalize each transaction from between 64 and 95 to just one.\n\nWriting that \u201cSSF is the easiest path to resolving a lot of the Ethereum PoS design\u2019s current weaknesses\u201d, Buterin also highlighted the technology\u2019s security benefits. He often touts it as the best way to grow Ethereum\u2019s validator count.\n\nEthereum Roadmap Adjusts Priorities\n\nMany of the ongoing Ethereum upgrades identified in Buterin\u2019s roadmap have remained the same since 2022. However, the network has reprioritized some areas to reflect it\u2019s evolving needs and the current state of research.\n\nFor instance, Buterin has reduced the emphasis on Variable Delay Function (VDF) and State Expiry. These are two concepts Ethereum researchers are working on but may still be years away from realizing.\n\nSystems gravitate towards being more centralized, because that's just more efficient. But here's the good news: Alongside fighting for decentralization, we have another tool in the toolset for censorship resistance and base layer neutrality: encryption. Encryption can disarm\u2026 https://t.co/crzux8G5NU \u2014 Shutter (@project_shutter) January 2, 2024\n\nMeanwhile, new priorities have been added to the roadmap. For example, Buterin highlighted \u201cdeep crypto\u201d and delay-encrypted mempools as two areas for exploration that could help advance Ethereum\u2019s long-term progress."

Historically, this has been viewed as a bullish signal.\n\nBut the party may just be starting. Noted technical analyst Ali Martinez pinned hopes on Ethereum to make further gains. He stated,\n\n\u201cThe path ahead of ETH is clear, with no significant supply barriers in sight, suggesting a potential rise to $2,700 or beyond. Additionally, a robust demand wall at $2,000 provides solid support, potentially cushioning any corrections.\u201d\n\nAMBCrypto\u2019s reading of Hyblock Capital\u2019s data echoed this sentiment somewhat. The market sentiment was one of greed, implying that there was a likelihood of more accumulation, and hence, a price increase.\n\nWhales weren\u2019t the drivers\n\nIn a rather surprising observation, the latest rally was not carried by whale investors. The number of large transactions stayed muted on the first of January, AMBCrypto detected using Santiment\u2019s data.\n\nSimilarly, no noticeable spike was observed in the holdings of user cohorts having more than 1,000 ETH.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nSpeculative bets on ETH jump\n\nAs ETH rallied, the eyes of derivatives traders lit up. The Open Interest (OI) in ETH futures contracts surged to $8.16 billion, representing an increase of 7.41% in the last 24 hours, AMBCrypto observed using Coinglass\u2019 data.\n\nMoreover, the number of individuals holding long positions exceeded those betting on price declines in the last 24 hours. The Long/Short Ratio went above 1 for the first time since the 27th of December."

The call for ENS integration is a move to help the protocol maintain its dominance in the smart contract world."

        "content": "Despite a delay in the Ethereum ETF decision, ETH\u2019s price may rally.\n\nOn-chain data showed that the altcoin may rise above $3,600.\n\nEthereum [ETH] could be one of the best performers of this year\u2019s first quarter, according to a recent revelation by Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe. The founder of MN Trading noted that altcoins would outperform Bitcoin [BTC] in Q1.\n\nHowever, that was not the main reason he opined that ETH would lead the charge.\n\nInstead, he focused on the ETF filings involving Bitcoin and Ethereum. In defense of his opinion, the analyst mentioned that the optimism around an Ethereum spot ETF would have a positive impact.\n\nvan de Poppe did not exclusively address what impact the Bitcoin spot ETF could have on ETH. Instead, he said,\n\n\u201cMy thesis is that Ethereum is likely going to outperform Bitcoin in the upcoming period and that\u2019s why I want to allocate more towards ETH. Spot Ethereum ETF after the approval of the Bitcoin ETF is one of the examples.\u201d\n\nIs Bitcoin\u2019s season gone?\n\nHowever, it is important to mention that the U.S. SEC has pushed its decision regarding the Ethereum ETF to May. Furthermore, many analysts believe that a decision in favor of Bitcoin will happen in January.\n\nAt press time, ETH\u2019s value was $2,425, marking a bullish start to the year. Indications from the daily chart showed that buyers were able to take advantage of the sellers\u2019 exhaustion at $2,272.\n\nThis was also instrumental to the flight above the $2,375 resistance level.\n\nFor the mid to long-term potential, the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) showed that ETH might be undervalued. As of this writing, the 50 EMA (blue) had jumped above the 200 EMA (yellow).\n\nThis position is a sign that a major uptrend could be established much later.\n\nSome time ago, AMBCrypto discussed how ETH could hit $2,500. At press time, the altcoin showed signals of moving closer to that point. However, the Average Directional Index (ADX) needs to trend higher to confirm the bias.\n\nThe ADX (yellow), as of this writing, was 15.67. If the reading hits 25 or above, it could support the +DMI (green) rise and help ETH hit $2,500 within a short period.\n\nETH has the top on its mind\n\nAnother metric that AMBCrypto considers vital to ETH\u2019s potential is the Pi Cycle Top. The Pi Cycle Top shows when a cryptocurrency becomes significantly overheated.\n\nIn this instance, the 111 SMA (green) reaches the level of the 350 SMA (purple).\n\nBut, an analysis of Glassnode\u2019s data showed that the 111 SMA was far below the 350 SMA. This means that Ethereum is not yet close to its top.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s ETH\u2019s market cap in BTC\u2019s terms\n\nA further assessment of the metric at press time showed that the 111 SMA was at $1,921. On the other hand, the 350 SMA was at $3,631. This implied that ETH has the potential to hit $3,631 in a few months if all goes well.\n\nBut if the altcoin does not attain that height, $1,921 could be a good support level. Apart from Ethereum, van de Poppe also asked his followers to keep an eye on Chainlink [LINK], Arbitrum [ARB], and Optimism [OP]."

        "title": "Ether ETF likely coming, as SEC 'implicitly' nodded ETH as commodity: Analyst - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The United States Securities and Exchange Commission implicitly accepted Ether (ETH) as a commodity when it approved ETH futures exchange-traded funds (ETFs) last year \u2014 meaning a spot ETF variant is likely set for this year \u2014 according to Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart.\n\nSpeaking during CryptoQuant\u2019s private webinar on Jan. 4, Seyffart alluded to the approval of Ether futures ETFs in October 2023, noting that the SEC did not challenge the coin\u2019s classification through the ETF registration process with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).\n\n\u201cThe CFTC is blatantly calling Ethereum a commodity. They do not call them securities. [...] The SEC has approved Ethereum futures ETFs. So again, Gary Gensler will not explicitly say whether Ethereum is a security or a commodity, but in their action, by approving those Ethereum futures ETFs, they\u2019re implicitly accepting those Ethereum futures as commodities futures.\u201d\n\nSeyffart said the SEC likely had no bandwidth to dispute the classification.\n\nThe first Ether futures ETFs in the U.S. were listed for trading on Oct. 2, with several investment firms launching a total of nine funds on the Chicago Board Options Exchange, including ProShares, VanEck, Bitwise, Valkyrie, Kelly and Volshares. According to Seyffart, the SEC could find itself in court and have to unlist futures ETFs if it were to deem Ether a security.\n\nThe classification matters since securities and commodities ETFs face different legal requirements, with different taxes and regulatory burdens attached to securities.\n\nHere we go \u2026 expect more spot #ethereum ETFs filings in the coming days.\n\n\n\nNOTE: this is an S-1 and not a 19b-4. Which means it does not start a clock in any way \u2026 yet. Expect 19b-4\u2019s soon. https://t.co/sNus2vr5qV \u2014 James Seyffart (@JSeyff) September 6, 2023\n\n\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t just be the SEC going against the crypto industry. If they call Ethereum a security, it\u2019ll be going against their sister regulator, CFTC. [...] That\u2019s why I think we could see potential Ethereum ETFs approved this year as well,\u201d the analyst noted.\n\nThe SEC recently lost a court case under a similar dispute in which it exempted the Spikes Index \u2014 a stock volatility index \u2014 from the definition of security futures under claims of promoting competition among such indexes. \u201cThere\u2019sr precedent here to say it matters how these things are registered,\u201d said Seyffart.\n\nThe SEC has a final decision deadline for VanEck, ARK 21Shares and Hashdex\u2019s spot Ether ETF in May 2024, with other decision deadlines coming in the months following.\n\nBefore then, however, the regulator must disclose its verdict on spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs. Seyfartt predicts an approval by Jan. 10, with $10 billion flowing into Bitcoin ETFs within 12 months.\n\nMagazine: Are DAOs overhyped and unworkable? Lessons from the front lines"

        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction: Ethereum (ETH), the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency, has been experiencing a lateral trading pattern for over a month, fluctuating between two key levels at $2400 and $2137. The appearance of daily candles with rejection wicks at both ends signifies a prevailing uncertainty among investors. Recently, a sharp market downturn, partly attributed to speculated rejections of spot Bitcoin ETFs by the US SEC as reported by Matrixport, a digital asset financial services firm, resulted in a notable 6.5% drop in the ETH price. This decline led to the breach of a crucial support trendline, hinting at the risk of further corrections.\n\nIs Ethereum Headed for a Steeper Slide?\n\nA bearish breakdown below the support trendline hints at an early upcoming correction.\n\nA healthy retracement in ETH price should bolter buyers to revive exhausted bullish momentum,\n\nThe intraday trading volume in Ether is $19.3 Billion, indicating a 53% gain.\n\nOver the past eight weeks, the Ethereum price has shown signs of recovery, evident from an ascending trendline on the daily chart. This trendline has historically served as a strategic buying point for investors during market dips, indicative of a robust recovery.\n\nadvertisement\n\nHowever, during the current period of consolidation, Ether has been facing substantial resistance at the $2400 mark. The recent downturn, coinciding with the broader market sell-off, pushed the price below both the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level and the established support trendline.\n\nIf the daily candlestick closes beneath this critical threshold, it could pave the way for sellers to exert additional downward pressure, potentially triggering a further 20% price decline, bringing the ETH price down to approximately $1750.\n\nEthereum Long-Term Holder Ratio Surpasses Bitcoin\n\nWhile current short-term trends suggest a cautious or downward trajectory for the Ethereum price, an analysis of the \u201cHolder Ratio\u201d chart presents a promising outlook for the cryptocurrency. In a retrospective of 2023, on-chain data from Intotheblock showcased on the X-platform, revealed that the proportion of long-term Ethereum holders exceeded that of Bitcoin for the second time. This vital statistic underscores a growing trend of Ethereum investors committing to hold their assets for extended periods, outpacing similar commitments among Bitcoin investors. This increase in long-term holding is significant as it reflects deepening confidence in Ethereum\u2019s prospects and stability\n\nRelative Strength Index (RSI): The daily RSI slope drops below the midline reflecting the sellers are strengthening their group over\n\nExponential Moving Average (EMA): The ETH price above daily EMAs(50, 100, and 200) hints the broader market is strongly bullish.\n\nRelated Articles:"

        "content": "Disclaimer: The opinions expressed by our writers are their own and do not represent the views of U.Today. The financial and market information provided on U.Today is intended for informational purposes only. U.Today is not liable for any financial losses incurred while trading cryptocurrencies. Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEthereum is showing a steady performance on the market, approaching a critical resistance level at $2,400. Breaking this resistance level should push the asset closer to $2,500, especially if investors avoid a sell-off.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index is providing hints that the current trend could continue. The RSI, positioned above the median line but not yet in overbought territory, suggests that there might be more room for upward movement before the asset becomes overextended.\n\nAs Ethereum tests this local resistance, the cryptocurrency community is eagerly anticipating regulatory decisions that could impact the broader market. One of the main catalysts for Ethereum, and indeed the wider cryptocurrency market, is the potential approval of a spot Ethereum ETF or a Bitcoin spot ETF.\n\nThe approval of a spot ETF has been a long-awaited event within the sector. An ETF, or Exchange-Traded Fund, allows investors to buy shares that represent the value of the underlying asset, in this case, Ethereum, without the need to hold the cryptocurrency itself. This eases entry for investors who are interested in the asset class but are hesitant to deal with the complexities of cryptocurrency ownership, storage and security.\n\nAs Ethereum hovers near this resistance level, market observers are monitoring the asset's ability to maintain its upward trajectory and break through the $2,400 price point. A successful breach of this level could pave the way for further gains, possibly leading toward the $2,500 mark.\n\nCardano finally broke through\n\nCardano has often been described as a project that moves cautiously, lagging behind the market, but the most recent breakthrough could be an indication of an upcoming disruptive performance.\n\nThe chart suggests that Cardano has reached a pivotal point. After a period of consolidation, ADA's price appears to be making a decisive move. The formation of a converging pattern, typically indicative of a price breakout, can be seen. Notably, the price has pushed above the upper trend line of this pattern, hinting at a potential continuation of the rally.\n\nAnalyzing the moving averages, we notice a bullish setup, with the price trading above the 50-day and 200-day moving averages. This is often interpreted as a positive signal, as it reflects a strong underlying trend with sustained buying interest. The gap between the moving averages and the current price also adds to this bullish narrative.\n\nThe volume bars do not show a substantial increase, suggesting that the breakout might not have fully captured the market's attention yet. A rise in trading volume would typically confirm a breakout, indicating increased conviction among traders.\n\nSolana's ability to continue\n\nSolana (SOL) has experienced a remarkable market run, capturing the attention of the cryptocurrency community. As the asset continues to gain traction, analysts and investors closely observe its price action for signs of sustainability or reversal. Currently, Solana shows signs that the tide may be turning, with a critical pattern emerging on its chart.\n\nThe price movement has recently formed what is known as a lower high, often interpreted as one of the initial indicators of a potential correction. This technical pattern occurs when the price peaks at a level lower than the previous high, signaling a decrease in the momentum that has been driving the bull market.\n\nThe significance of the lower high is underscored when placed within the context of the asset's recent performance. While the overall trajectory for Solana has been upward, this development suggests that traders and investors might be becoming more cautious, potentially leading to a shift in market sentiment.\n\nVolume, a key factor in confirming trend reversals, appears to have lessened as the lower high formed, which may indicate a reduction in buying pressure. Additionally, the Relative Strength Index (RSI), while still at a relatively high level, has begun to show divergence, indicating a weakening in the current trend's strength."

        "content": "Ethereum Foundation Announces Devcon 7 Conference in Bangkok, Thailand, November 12-15, 2024\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation has announced that Devcon 7, the Ethereum developer conference, will be hosted in Bangkok, Thailand, from November 12 to 15, 2024. The decision reflects an expansion of the event\u2019s vision, with a focus on embracing the entire Southeast Asia region as the stage for the community gathering.\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation expressed its excitement about the potential and rapid growth of the Ethereum community in Southeast Asia. The decision to schedule Devcon 7 for 2024 allows for a more significant impact on regional Ethereum communities. The Foundation aims to engage more deeply with local communities, providing support and empowerment in a meaningful way.\n\nAccording to the announcement, Devcon 7 will be a more inclusive and regionally focused event, and to reflect this vision, it will be called \u201cDevcon Southeast Asia\u201d rather than being named after the host city. The event is expected to resonate across Southeast Asia, showcasing the vibrant Ethereum community in the region.\n\nThe choice of Bangkok, Thailand, as the host city aligns with the region\u2019s significant potential and rapid growth in cryptocurrency adoption. The Ethereum community in countries like Vietnam, the Philippines, Indonesia, and Thailand ranks highly in the Global Crypto Adoption Index, underscoring the pivotal role of Southeast Asia in the global Ethereum landscape.\n\nThe decision to focus on Southeast Asia is driven not only by the region\u2019s significant potential and rapid cryptocurrency adoption but also by its diverse cultures, rich histories, and vibrant communities.\n\n\u201cDevcon Southeast Asia\u201d aims to resonate across the region, showcasing the vibrant Ethereum community and enveloping the diverse cultures and energy of Southeast Asia. The chosen host city, Bangkok, Thailand, with its unique blend of tradition and modernity, is considered an ideal location in terms of venue suitability and global accessibility. The event is expected to provide a platform for meaningful engagement with local communities and further empower the Ethereum ecosystem in Southeast Asia.\n\nAs of the latest update, the live Ethereum (ETH) price is $2,218.64 USD, reflecting a 5.78% decrease in the last 24 hours.\n\nEthereum Foundation\u2019s Road to Devcon Grants Foster Community Growth in Southeast Asia\n\n\n\nIn a bid to support and nurture Ethereum events, grassroots communities, and educational initiatives in Southeast Asia, the Ethereum Foundation (EF) initiated the Road to Devcon (RTD) Grants round on June 29, 2023. The grant round is specifically aimed at individuals based in Southeast Asia who are actively building communities, developing educational activities, and contributing to the growth of the Ethereum ecosystem in the region.\n\nThe EF encouraged applicants to propose smaller meet-ups instead of large events, with the maximum grant awarded being $1,000. The initiative aims to empower the Southeast Asian Ethereum community by providing support along the Road to Devcon. The application deadline for the grants was set for November 30, 2023, at 23:59 UTC.\n\nAccording to the recent announcement, the EF expressed satisfaction with the enthusiastic response and innovative proposals received from countries such as Indonesia, Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore, the Philippines, Vietnam, and other neighboring Southeast Asian nations. The grants serve as a means to recognize and support the efforts of individuals and projects that contribute to shaping the Ethereum ecosystem in the region.\n\nVietnam Tops Southeast Asia in Global Crypto Adoption Index\n\n\n\nAccording to recent research by Chainalysis, Vietnam has emerged as a leader in cryptocurrency adoption within Southeast Asia, securing the top spot in the region and claiming the third position globally in the Global Crypto Adoption Index for 2023. This index is determined based on transaction volumes and protocols, taking into account web traffic patterns and weighting factors such as population size and purchasing power.\n\nVietnam\u2019s robust performance in the Global Crypto Adoption Index highlights the country\u2019s growing enthusiasm for cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. The research places other Southeast Asian nations in varying positions, with the Philippines, Indonesia, and Thailand securing the 6th, 7th, and 10th spots, respectively. Notably, Singapore lags at the 77th position.\n\nThe competition among Southeast Asian countries to establish themselves as crypto hubs is evident, with each nation adopting different regulatory approaches to balance the potential of Web3 with safe and efficient practices. While Singapore and Thailand have implemented stricter measures, Vietnam\u2019s favorable ranking suggests its positive reception and adoption of cryptocurrencies within the region."

From Dec 14 to Jan 3, Bitcoin consistently surpassed Ethereum regarding transaction fees, marking three weeks.\n\nWhile not unprecedented, this phenomenon was noteworthy given the typically lower Bitcoin transaction fees. Interestingly, a similar trend surfaced briefly in November when Bitcoin transaction fees outpaced Ethereum\u2019s for three days.\n\nHowever, this recent streak fell short of the record set in 2017, when Bitcoin transaction fees outperformed Ethereum\u2019s for roughly a year. While the recent trend has concluded, the fluctuation in transaction fees between the two digital assets remains a point of interest.\n\nStakeholders are urged to monitor these trends as they could have significant implications for mining profitability and the broader digital asset market dynamics."

        "content": "Quick Take\n\nBitcoin has maintained a notable ascendancy over Ethereum throughout 2023, sustaining a performance that outstripped Ethereum each quarter. In Q1, Bitcoin\u2019s value surge of 72% significantly overshadowed Ethereum\u2019s 52% increase. The trend continued into Q2, with Bitcoin and Ethereum growing at 7% and 6% respectively. While both experienced a downturn in Q3, Bitcoin\u2019s dip of -12% was less severe than Ethereum\u2019s -14%. Q4 saw a rebound, with Bitcoin surging 57%, outpacing Ethereum\u2019s 37% rise.\n\nInterestingly, this dominance of Bitcoin did not spring up in 2023 alone; it actually extends back into 2022, meaning Bitcoin has outperformed Ethereum for six out of the past eight quarters.\n\nThis performance differential is evident in the Ethereum to Bitcoin ratio. Ethereum had previously gained significant ground on Bitcoin throughout 2021, rising from a low of 0.02 in Jan. 2021 to gain 284% by December, peaking at 0.088. However, since then, the ratio has fallen significantly to 0.52, though notably it remains 127% higher than the 2021 low.\n\nOver the course of 2023, Ethereum\u2019s value relative to Bitcoin declined by roughly 28%. With Bitcoin\u2019s market cap dominance standing at approximately 52%, it leads us to ponder whether Bitcoin\u2019s market supremacy will persist.\n\nBitcoin Quarterly returns(%)\n\nTime Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 2024 +6.93% \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 2023 +71.17% +7.19% -11.54% +56.9% 2022 -1.46% -56.2% -2.57% -14.75%\n\nSource: Coinglass\n\nEthereum Quarterly returns(%)\n\nTime Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 2024 +3.25% \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 2023 +52.15% +6.29% -13.64% +36.66% 2022 -10.75% -67.34% +24.09% -9.94%\n\nSource: Coinglass"

        "title": "Ethereum Insider Says XRP Will Shine, Plans to Become XRP Investor - The Crypto Basic",
        "content": "As the crypto community anticipates the bull market\u2019s peak, early Ethereum advisor Steven Nerayoff has made favorable predictions for XRP.\n\nNerayoff speculated that XRP will shine in the bull market. According to the crypto advisor, the current bull market started after Ripple secured a legal victory against the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nThe Ethereum advisor explained that Ripple\u2019s legal victory helped clear concerns about uncertainty, leading to the commencement of a bull market.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nRecall that Ripple recorded a partial victory against the SEC last year, where a federal judge declared that XRP in itself does not constitute a security as alleged by the regulator.\n\nInterestingly, Nerayoff noted that the current bull market is a catch-up time for XRP, as the coin missed out on the previous bull market due to the SEC v. Ripple legal tussle.\n\nYes, arguably Ripple\u2019s legal victory started this bull run! It\u2019s catch-up time for the last bull run. \u2014 Steven Nerayoff (@StevenNerayoff) January 1, 2024\n\nHow the SEC Lawsuit Affected XRP Performance in the 2021 Bull Market\n\nFor context, the SEC charged Ripple with offering XRP as an unregistered security in December 2020. The regulator introduced the lawsuit shortly before most crypto assets, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, recorded new all-time highs (ATHs).\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nWhile several crypto assets registered new ATHs in 2021, XRP traded at $1.96 on April 2021, 50% below its previous ATH of $3.4 set on January 4, 2018.\n\nWith a federal judge declaring XRP to be a non-security, Nerayoff believed that this bull run was XRP\u2019s turn to shine. Although he did not give any price prediction for XRP, he speculated that the asset would make up for its low performance in the previous bull market.\n\nNerayoff Plans to Invest in XRP\n\nIn the meantime, Nerayoff has disclosed plans to invest an undisclosed amount in XRP. He made this known after a crypto enthusiast asked him whether he owned XRP.\n\nResponding, Nerayoff said he has not invested in XRP but hopes to do so soon. However, he did not provide any hint about when he plans on investing in the sixth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.\n\nNo. I\u2019m not invested in Ether or XRP as I didn\u2019t want anyone to say I was biased. I would be an investor in XRP & have publicly spoken about my belief in them since 2014. (I have a tiny amount of Ether bc I need to pay the ETH Cabal for their exorbitant gas fees). \u2014 Steven Nerayoff (@StevenNerayoff) January 1, 2024\n\nCan XRP Surpass Its Previous ATH?\n\nMeanwhile, despite many analysts emphasizing that the bull market has already started, XRP was trading at $0.58, down 82.9% from its previous ATH of $3.4.\n\nThese analysts predict that the bull market will reach its peak after the upcoming Bitcoin Halving, which is expected to occur in April 2024.\n\nHistorically, the prices of various crypto assets, including BTC and XRP, usually skyrocket several months after every Bitcoin Halving. Whether the same pattern will repeat itself in the coming months remains to be seen.\n\nXRP Community Predicts XRP Price in Bull Market\n\nIn the meantime, XRP community members participated in an X survey to predict the final price of the digital asset in this bull market.\n\nOut of the 533 X accounts that participated in the survey, the majority of them, representing 38.1%, projected that XRP could surge to $12 and above in the bull market.\n\nIn addition, 23.5% of the participants forecast that XRP could surge and end the bull market at around $8 \u2013 $12. Notably, a number of participants, representing 18.4%, predict that XRP will trade below $2.\n\nWhat\u2019s Your $XRP Peak Price Prediction in 2024? ??

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nVitalik Buterin, the cofounder of Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has recently made a significant transfer of USD Coin (USDC), a stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to PeckShield Alert, the Vitalik Buterin-labeled address made a move of 3,300 USDC in the early hours of today.\n\nThe reason for the transfer is not far-fetched: the Ethereum cofounder was merely reshuffling funds as the said 3,300 USDC were moved to a new address.\n\nThe Ethereum price is dipping alongside the rest of the crypto market, down 5.71% in the last 24 hours to $2,246. The crypto market witnessed a slump after speculations arose about MatrixPort's bearish prediction for Bitcoin spot ETF approval.\n\nAmid the current slump seen on the ETH price, crypto analyst Michael van de Poppe believes that Ethereum is still showing momentum but has a big gap to traverse to be at the same level as Bitcoin. Ethereum might see a bit of consolidation before continuing toward $3,000\u2013$3,500 during Q1, 2024.\n\nExpectations for Ethereum in 2024\n\nStarting with the Dencun hard fork, 2024 is shaping up to be an exciting year for the Ethereum network.\n\nAt the end of 2023, Ethereum cofounder Vitalik Buterin published the Ethereum roadmap going forward, conceding that there are only small differences from the previous year.\n\nButerin stated in a series of posts on X (previously Twitter) that Ethereum's sustained focus in 2024 will be on six essential components. Buterin expounded on these six parts \u2014 Merge, Surge, Scourge, Verge, Purge and Splurge \u2014 in a thorough chart with commentaries and graphics.\n\nButerin already indicated his intention to revive the original vision of the \"cypherpunk\" revolution for the Ethereum blockchain, as previously reported."

In 2021, 20% of his followers were sure that this \"flippening\" would never happen.\n\nEthereum (ETH) L2s accomplished historic milestone\n\nIn the first days of 2024, the aggregated sum of value locked in Ethereum-based L2 protocols exceeded that of all non-Ethereum blockchains. While Ethereum L2s are responsible for $20.7 billion in equivalent, the rest of blockchains amassed $19.6 billion, as noticed by Stark today, Jan. 4, 2024.\n\nit happened \ud83c\udf89\n\n\n\n- Ethereum L2s = $20.7 billion\n\n- Other L1s = $19.67 billionhttps://t.co/o38jqwnHJC pic.twitter.com/uqWAqWkJUC \u2014 Josh Stark (@0xstark) January 4, 2024\n\nMeanwhile, he stressed that the metrics cannot be treated as exactly similar: For second-layer networks, the indicator refers to the sum of assets on L2, including native tokens. For L1s, the metrics reflect the sum of assets locked in dApps on this or that blockchain.\n\nThe analyst used L2Beat's data for tracking second-layer blockchains and DefiLlama to analyze what is happening on non-Ethereum L1s.\n\nIt is interesting that back in September 2021, he asked his audience about the date of this \"L2-over-L1\" flippening. While the majority of his followers were sure that this fact could take place in 2022, 20% answered that it would never happen.\n\nThe L2s ecosystem was 20 times smaller than the L1s one, as of the date of the first voting. During the crypto winter, this gap became even more dramatic; its peak was reached amid the Terra/Luna collapse in Q1, 2022.\n\nArbitrum (ARB) dominance inches closer to 50% again\n\nAs demonstrated by L2Beat, the ecosystem of Ethereum's L2s registered an all-time high in TVL on Jan. 2, 2024. The metric jumped above $20.78 billion in equivalent, adding over 330% in just one year.\n\nThe L2s scene remains heavily \"concentrated\": Only five networks \u2014 Arbitrum (ARB), OP Mainnet (Optimism, OP), Base, Metis Andromeda and Manta Pacific \u2014 are responsible for over 90% of its TVL.\n\nArbitrum (ARB), the largest Ethereum-based L1, is rebuilding its dominance after a small decline. As of printing time, it is one step away from the 50% barrier.\n\nFor the closest competitor, OP Mainnet, this indicator equals 28.65%, L2Beat data says."

The upgrade's testing phase is scheduled to commence on January 17, 2024, on the Goerli network, followed by tests on the Sepolia and Holesky networks. The Dencun upgrade, marking a considerable progression since the Shapella hard fork, aims to enhance Ethereum's scalability and operational efficiency, particularly in data storage capacity. A key feature of this upgrade is the introduction of \"proto-danksharding,\" expected to substantially increase the network's bandwidth and optimize performance.\n\nThis upgrade is expected to address key challenges of scalability and efficiency, potentially marking a landmark achievement in Ethereum's evolution towards a more scalable and efficient blockchain ecosystem.\n\nIn 2023, Ethereum remained in the shadow of Bitcoin, recording a lower rate of return. However, many indications suggest that this trend may reverse this year. From a technical perspective, maintaining the support zone around 2130 USD will be crucial for Ethereum in the short term. This level was tested yesterday during a brief panic caused by heated emotions.\n\nSource: xStation 5"

        "content": "E Key Takeaways\n\nVitalik Buterin has called Ethereum Name Service (ENS) \u201csuper important\u201d triggering a spike in the market price of the protocol\u2019s governance token.\n\nIn the past 24 hours, ENS has pumped over 40%.\n\nMeanwhile, the overall crypto market is down over 5% in the same period.\n\nIn the past 24 hours, Bitcoin has led a crypto market crash after Matrixport struck a blow to traders\u2019 confidence that the Securities and Exchange Commission will approve spot Bitcoin ETFs next week. But one token \u2013 Ethereum Name Service (ENS) \u2013 has bucked the wider market trend.\n\nAt a time when BTC and other leading cryptocurrencies fell between 5% and 10% in 24 hours, ENS surged more than 40% after Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin endorsed it.\n\nButerin Backs More Affordable ENS\n\nIn a recent post on Twitter, Buterin discussed upgrades to the Ethereum ecosystem that could promote the use of ENS.\n\nArguing that ENS \u201cneeds to be affordable,\u201d he endorsed the use of Chainlink\u2019s cross-chain interoperability protocol (CCIP) to make ENS subdomains registerable, updateable and readable directly on Ethereum layer 2 scaling solutions. In line with the renewed interest in L2 scaling incorporated in Buterin\u2019s latest Ethereum roadmap, this approach could significantly boost ENS adoption by driving down the costs associated with registering and managing Web3 domains on the blockchain.\n\nAll L2s should be working on (trustless, merkle-proof-based) CCIP resolvers, so that we can have ENS subdomains registerable, updateable and readable directly on L2s. ENS is super-important, it needs to be affordable!https://t.co/Ice1lTttFE \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) January 3, 2024\n\nThe costs associated with ENS are typically paid in ETH. However, the eponymous governance token is an important feature of the technology. It can influence the protocol\u2019s management and future development.\n\nWhat are ENS Subdomains?\n\nEthereum Naming Service is a decentralized domain name system that can link Ethereum addresses with human-readable domains. When combined with IPFS, the ENS protocol can even support fully decentralized web hosting, with domains referencing entire websites.\n\nENS is not just for Ethereum L1. It\u2019s cross-chain and works especially well on L2s that post their state roots to L1. It\u2019s also a permissionless public good that all L2s should be using and can be building on without needing to ask ENS. But we\u2019re here to help if you are! https://t.co/udHqOx3cB6 \u2014 jefflau.eth (@_jefflau) January 3, 2024\n\nMost ENS domains consist of a top-level and a second-level domain. For example, in vitalik.eth, eth is the top-level domain and vitalik is the second-level domain.\n\nBy adding a third level, however, each domain can be divided into subdomains. This could drive adoption by approximating the Web2 domain name system in which a small number of domain owners administer services for a much larger base of end users, without needing to pay gas fees for each subdomain."

We\u2019ll be going through key moving averages and oscillators that will allow us to get a better idea of how Ethereum is positioned in the market right now.\n\nPeriod Daily Simple Daily Exponential Weekly Simple Weekly Exponential MA3 $ 2,399.46 (SELL) $ 2,307.03 (SELL) - - MA5 $ 2,326.80 (SELL) $ 2,303.33 (SELL) - - MA10 $ 2,284.52 (SELL) $ 2,270.91 (SELL) - - MA21 $ 2,259.45 (SELL) $ 2,193.20 (BUY) $ 2,292.59 (SELL) $ 1,954.29 (BUY) MA50 $ 2,168.15 (BUY) $ 2,046.74 (BUY) $ 2,175.67 (BUY) $ 1,858.16 (BUY) MA100 $ 1,951.80 (BUY) $ 1,926.32 (BUY) $ 1,706.86 (BUY) $ 1,854.68 (BUY) MA200 $ 1,862.22 (BUY) $ 1,843.45 (BUY) $ 1,771.24 (BUY) $ 1,642.27 (BUY)\n\nPeriod Value Action RSI (14) 58.23 NEUTRAL Stoch RSI (14) 100.00 SELL Stochastic Fast (14) 69.00 NEUTRAL Commodity Channel Index (20) 66.67 NEUTRAL Average Directional Index (14) 22.54 NEUTRAL Awesome Oscillator (5, 34) 69.10 NEUTRAL Momentum (10) 38.17 NEUTRAL MACD (12, 26) 0.14 NEUTRAL Williams Percent Range (14) -31.00 NEUTRAL Ultimate Oscillator (7, 14, 28) 49.64 NEUTRAL VWMA (10) 2,320.86 BUY Hull Moving Average (9) 2,328.84 BUY Ichimoku Cloud B/L (9, 26, 52, 26) 2,290.16 NEUTRAL\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI 14) is a widely used indicator that helps inform investors whether an asset is currently overbought or oversold. The RSI 14 for Ethereum is at 58.23, suggesting that ETH is currently neutral.\n\nThe 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA 50) takes into account the closing price of Ethereum over the last 50 days. Currently, Ethereum is trading below the SMA 50 trendline, which is a bearish signal.\n\nMeanwhile, the 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA 200) is a long-term trendline that\u2019s calculated by taking an average of the ETH closing price for the last 200 days. ETH is now trading below the SMA 200, signaling that the market is currently bearish.\n\nThe bottom line about this Ethereum prediction\n\nAfter considering the above factors, we can conclude that the current forecast for Ethereum price prediction is Neutral. ETH would have to increase by 8.08% to hit our $ 2,416.36 target within the next five days. Moving forward, it will be important to monitor the ETH market sentiment, the key support and resistance levels, and other metrics. However, we have to keep in mind that the cryptocurrency markets are unpredictable, and even the largest crypto assets display a lot of price volatility.

        "content": "With the majority of assets in the cryptocurrency sector pausing the gains they accumulated in the past weeks, Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is no exception, having dropped below the previous price level of above $2,300.\n\nIndeed, according to the renowned crypto trading expert Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe, Ethereum \u201chas a big gap to gain in order to be at the same level as Bitcoin (BTC),\u201d and he expects some consolidation before it would continue towards the area between $3,000 and $3,500.\n\nIn his words, this bullish continuation, following the consolidation currently at work, could occur sometime during the first three months of 2024, as van de Poppe explained using a chart pattern analysis in an X post he published on January 3.\n\nEthereum price action analysis and prediction. Source: Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe\n\nAt the same time, it is worth noting that the investment banking, securities and investment management giant Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS) expects that the possible approval of spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for Bitcoin and Ethereum in early 2024 could bring in more institutional investors.\n\nSpecifically, Mathew McDermott, head of digital assets at Goldman Sachs, told Fox Business in an interview that the approval of a Bitcoin and/or Ethereum ETF in 2024 could bring more institutional investors into the crypto market even if they are not necessarily directly investing in crypto assets:\n\n\u201cOne, it broadens and deepens the liquidity in the market. And why does it do that? It does that because you\u2019re actually creating institutional products that can be traded by institutions that don\u2019t need to touch the bare asset. And I think that, to me, that opens up the universe of the pensions, insurers, etc.\u201d\n\nEthereum price analysis\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum was at press time trading at the price of $2,218.23, recording a 7.48% drop in the last 24 hours, adding up to a decline of 2.89% across the previous seven days and a 1.72% loss accumulated on its monthly chart, as per the most recent data on January 3.\n\nEthereum 7-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nAll things considered, Ethereum could, indeed, hit the projected price target of $3,500 in the first quarter of 2024, or even higher, particularly if the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approves the first spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund in the coming weeks.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "content": "Arbitrum One\u2019s Total Value Locked (TVL) witnessed a remarkable increase of 15.9%, reaching a milestone of $10.22 billion in the past seven days, making it the first Layer 2 (L2) network to surpass the $10 billion TVL mark.\n\nThe achievement follows an incident on December 15, where Arbitrum One faced a two-hour partial outage due to a surge of Bitcoin Ordinals-inspired inscriptions that led to the triggering of a sequencer stop.\n\nArbitrum One Dominates Ethereum Layer 2 TVL\n\nAccording to data by L2Beat, the total TVL for Ethereum Layer 2 networks has reached $20.82 billion, with Arbitrum One contributing significantly by accounting for 48.03% of the total.\n\nArbitrum currently holds a diversified asset portfolio with 30.9% in Ethereum (ETH), 23.68% in its native governance token ARB, 29.66% allocated to stablecoins, and the remaining 15.76% spread across various other assets. Notably, the ARB token has registered a 14.3% increase in value over the past 24 hours, according to Coingecko data.\n\nThe success of Arbitrum One can be attributed to its ability to replicate the Ethereum experience while offering substantially lower transaction costs. This cost-effectiveness has attracted a considerable number of decentralized applications (dApps), with approximately 470 currently deployed on the network.\n\nThe implementation of the ARB token, serving as a governance token, has significantly contributed to the platform\u2019s growth. Governance tokens empower holders to actively participate in decision-making processes concerning the platform\u2019s development and policies, thereby incentivizing greater user engagement within the ecosystem.\n\nFurthermore, the Arbitrum One network boasts a well-established Security Council, a deployed and operational proof system, and accepts fraud proofs from a minimum of five external actors. Moreover, the platform offers a 7-day exit window without relying on a permissioned operator in the event of an unpopular upgrade by actors with more centralization than a security council.\n\nArbitrum One on Upward Trajectory After Outage\n\nArbitrum One faced downtime on December 15, which was categorized as a \u201cmajor outage\u201d on the dashboard. An investigation was initiated to identify the root cause and implement a fix.\n\nBefore the interruption, Arbitrum\u2019s layer-2 network had processed over 22.29 million transactions, as reported by l2beat, and boasted a total value locked of $2.3 billion, according to DefiLlama data.\n\nThe incident on December 15 was not the first time Arbitrum faced disruptions. In June 2023, the DeFi Layer 2 network experienced a standstill for over an hour due to a bug in its sequencer. The bug caused the sequencer to revert batches on-chain, leading to the depletion of Ether (ETH) from the sequencer. Developers intervened by manually replenishing the sequencer, addressing the bug, and restoring normalcy to the Layer 2 network."

Solana ranked second in monthly DEX volume, trailing behind Ethereum\u2019s $42.4 billion.\n\nSolana Sees an Influx of New Tokens\n\n\n\nAs reported, the Solana blockchain network has experienced an unprecedented influx of new tokens this month, surpassing any previous records by a significant margin.\n\nOver the last two weeks alone, a staggering 72,202 new tokens have been minted on Solana using the SPL token standard.\n\nThis number is more than 71 times the amount of tokens created during a comparable period in October.\n\nThe daily statistics for new token creation on Solana are now consistently four times higher than ever before since the network\u2019s launch in 2020."

This comes as the blockchain aims to tap the growing crypto adoption in Asian markets.\n\nEthereum Foundation turns to Asia\n\nAs the Ethereum Foundation turns to Asia for its next conferences, the event is marked to place between November 12 and 15 in Bangkok. It notes that the conference aims to increase Devcon\u2019s impact on regional Ethereum communities.\n\nadvertisement\n\nBased on the release, the Ethereum community is rapidly growing in Southeast Asia and holds significant potential. Meanwhile, crypto adoption is on a steady rise in the part of the globe as well. Vietnam, the Philippines, Indonesia, and Thailand are leading in the Global Crypto Adoption Index, underscoring the region\u2019s pivotal role in the global Ethereum landscape.\n\nHosting Devcons, which is a conference for developers, and researchers, aims to bring the community across the entire region on a global platform.\n\nThe Ethereum boom in Southeast Asia since 2022\n\nAccording to research company Statista, the Asia-Pacific region is emerging as a leader in the field of digital assets. Thanks to higher institutional acceptance of cryptocurrencies, it has become one of the most widely owned and used virtual currencies in Southeast Asia.\n\nAround 78% of users in the region claim to own Ethereum-based digital assets, making it the most popular blockchain technology in the Asian region.\n\nRegulatory ease in Asia\n\nRegulations in Asian countries have been easing in the past couple of years, opening them to broader adoption. Therefore, emerging as a potential market expansion for Ethereum-based chains and applications.\n\nAccording to an OECD report, Southeast Asia is highly suitable for a rise in digital asset use. This has paved the way for governments to lay out regulatory frameworks to safeguard retail users. The trend has also slowly provided for regulations around digital assets to help mitigate consumer concerns.\n\nAlso, the report highlights possible international cooperation from governments in the region to come close to formulate laws surrounding virtual currencies for a steady and smooth rise in the customer base."

Behind all that is Dirk Lueth, Co-Founder of Upland, who is also Chairperson of OMA3, the Open Metaverse Alliance. He understands the need for collaboration, seamless user onboarding and the challenges facing the metaverse as a whole.\n\nhttps://x.com/UplandMe/status/1742304764933615850?s=20\n\nGaming sector continues to drive adoption\n\nAfter a stream of interesting posts from Upland on platform X users are beginning to understand the adoption rate of the platform. In 2023, over 1.5 million NFTs were minted and there were over 227 million total transactions. Despite the bear market, Upland has capitalized on the gaming sector by launching highly engaging features, easy onboarding and being a mobile-driven application.\n\nThe Open Metaverse is on the right track\n\nLaunched in 2020, Upland has transitioned from a property trading game to become a driving force in the development of the world\u2019s most expansive digital economy.

One significant release was a feature called Metamask Snaps, allowing users to choose from a wide range of dApps or add-ons for their Metamask browser extension. This adds to their commitment to permissionless technology. The fact that developers maintain ownership over the creations and their code is a significant feature of Web3. It offers more user centric control and is a departure from traditional app store processes.\n\nTowards the end of last year Metamask announced a Stripe integration to expand crypto on-ramp options. As one of the most popular Ethereum and alt-coin wallets servicing over 30 million users, this was a major feature update."

Source: Validator Queue.\n\nAnalysts have attributed the move to Celsius, the failed CeFi lender, announcing it will unstake all of its existing Ether holdings on the same day. Celsius said it is in the process of recalling and rebalancing assets in preparation to distribute assets to creditors. In August, Celsius said it plans to distribute nearly $2B worth of BTC and possibly ETH to creditors.\n\n\u201cThe significant unstaking activity in the next few days will unlock ETH to ensure timely distributions to creditors,\u201d Celsius tweeted.\n\nCelsius filed for bankruptcy in July 2022 after halting user withdrawals one month earlier.

        "content": "Share this article URL Copied\n\nWith Ordinals taking center stage, Bitcoin dominated the NFT market last month, accounting for more than half of the overall monthly NFT sales.\n\nAccording to data from CryptoSlam, Bitcoin NFT sales surged to a record high of over $880 million in December, outpacing major platforms like Ethereum, Solana, and Polygon. The number of buyers and sellers skyrocketed by 140%, with over 9,000 buyers and 10,000 sellers joining the market.\n\nWhile Bitcoin dominated, Ethereum experienced a decline in NFT sales, dropping by 15.57% to reach $350 million. In contrast, Solana also saw a remarkable 250% growth, though its total sales still trailed those of Bitcoin and Ethereum. Arbitrum also showcased significant growth, with a 180% surge in NFT sales.\n\nThe most valuable NFT sold was Van Gogh\u2019s Painting #216, fetching $1.19 million. This NFT is part of a Bitcoin-powered NFT collection created to pay tribute to the renowned artist. Two other artworks from the same collection, #132 and #283, were sold earlier for $1.3 million and $1.27 million, respectively.\n\nOverall, while global NFT sales surpassed $1.7 billion last month, this volume remains significantly below its peak of $5.5 billion back in August 2021.\n\nOrdinals have played an essential role in the recent surge in Bitcoin\u2019s NFT sales. Introduced in September 2022, this new technology allows users to inscribe digital items, including images, videos, and music, directly onto the Bitcoin blockchain. BitMEX reported over 13,000 Ordinals transactions were processed within the first two months, consuming 526MB of Bitcoin blockspace.\n\nAdvocates such as Bitcoin developer Udi Wertheimer or MicroStrategy\u2019s co-founder Michael Saylor champion Ordinals for boosting Bitcoin\u2019s sustainability. However, not all Bitcoin community members agree. Luke Dashjr, a Bitcoin Core developer, argues that these inscriptions exploit a vulnerability in the data size limit, potentially leading to network spam."

        "content": "There seems to be a tug-of-war between the two leading cryptocurrencies \u2013 Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). While both have been posting strong growth consistently, there\u2019s a lot of speculation about which one is the best cryptocurrency to buy.\n\nA recent set of predictions by analysts seems to be tipping the scale in Ethereum\u2019s favor. Multiple analysts have said that Ethereum can potentially outperform Bitcoin in 2024.\n\nMeanwhile, InQubeta (QUBE) has been topping analysts\u2019 best cryptocurrency ICO lists with its steady performance. The decentralized platform for raising funds for AI startups was released in 2023 and it has carved a niche for itself in a dynamic market like the crypto sector. Its presale funding currently stands at $7.6 million.\n\nInQubeta: Making AI startups\u2019 wishes come true\n\nInQubeta is no ordinary cryptocurrency. It\u2019s a blockchain-powered project which has the potential to catalyze the startup ecosystem with readily available funding. The QUBE presale has attracted many buyers and could reach the $10M figure soon.\n\nInQubeta runs on a no-frills investment model where AI startups connect with investors through an NFT marketplace and raise funds. The payments and taxes are paid in terms of InQubeta\u2019s native cryptocurrency, the QUBE token.\n\nHaving a currency for the entire ecosystem enables InQubeta to streamline transactions and ensure that they are processed quickly. The QUBE token is also for the governance of the platform. Its owners are given special voting privileges to participate in decisions.\n\nWhenever there is a proposal from the InQubeta community for a change in protocol, the suggestions are put to a vote. Token holders exercise these exclusive rights to decide if a proposal is worth implementing.\n\nAn important use case of this token is its staking feature. Owners can lock their tokens in InQubeta\u2019s liquidity pool and contribute to the platform\u2019s balanced growth. In return, they are rewarded with cryptocurrencies. These rewards are given from a pool that\u2019s funded by tax collections.\n\nWhat adds to the charm of the QUBE token is its deflationary character. The feature tweaks token supply to guard its returns against inflation or market volatility.\n\nIt\u2019s because of this feature that QUBE token holders can sit relaxed while the rest of the investors are reeling under inflation-induced losses. When inflation rises, the token\u2019s availability is reduced.\n\nBy making the supply less than the demand, a deflationary model promotes asset value and curbs its fluctuation. Any additional tokens found in circulation are promptly burned to keep the supply scarce.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Dencun upgrade to go live on the Goerli testnet\n\nEthereum is among the first altcoins that the world experimented with what blockchain technology can do, and ever since it has maintained its hold over the market. The decentralized technology today powers multiple cryptocurrencies, NFTs, blockchains, dApps, and other Web 3.0 solutions.\n\nThe ETH network leverages the proof-of-stake consensus algorithm for confirming transactions and keeping its network secure. Ethereum\u2019s native token is ETH. Experts have predicted that Ethereum could finally surpass Bitcoin in 2024.\n\nThe platform was recently in the news following reports that Ethereum\u2019s Dencun upgrade would go live on the Goerli testnet on January 17. After Goerli, the upgrade will be tested on the Sepolia and Holesky networks on January 30 and February 7, respectively.\n\nBitcoin is among the most preferred cryptocurrencies in India: Report\n\nBitcoin is among the altcoins to watch out for in 2024 due to its impressive performance. According to analysts, being one of the first cryptocurrencies to hit the market has helped Bitcoin massively.

        "content": "Radiant Capital Reports Exploit of $4.5 Million Ethereum Loss\n\nRadiant Capital has confirmed a security breach in its network, leading to the theft of Ethereum valued at approximately $4.5 million.\n\nAccording to the blockchain security company PeckShield Inc., the hacker drained 1,900 Ethereum tokens within six seconds after a new market was activated on the decentralized platform. To analyze what exactly happened during the exploitation, PeckShield published a post to explain.\n\n\u201cThe root cause is not new: It basically exploits a time window when a new market is activated in a lending market (forked from the popular Compound/Aave),\u201d wrote the post. \u201cThe exploitation also relies on a known rounding issue in current Compound/Aave codebase.\u201d\n\n\u201cSpecifically, today\u2019s actor \u2026 sniped the new USDC market deployment and exploited it *6 seconds* after the activation,\u201d wrote PeckShield.\n\nRadiant Capital Acknowledges Exploitation\n\n\n\nRadiant Capital also confirmed the hack in their official post, confirming the details of the exploit. \u201cToday, we received a report of an issue with the newly created native USDC market on Arbitrum,\u201d said the company.\n\nToday, we received a report of an issue with the newly created native USDC market on Arbitrum. After validation by Radiant developers and the wider Web 3 security community, the Radiant DAO Council paused lending/borrowing markets on Arbitrum temporarily while this is\u2026 \u2014 Radiant Capital (@RDNTCapital) January 3, 2024\n\nIn the meantime, the Arbitrum markets have been temporarily closed. \u201cAfter validation by Radiant developers and the wider Web 3 security community, the Radiant DAO Council paused lending/borrowing markets on Arbitrum temporarily while this is investigated further,\u201d said Radiant Capital.\n\nAccording to the platform, no funds are at risk. At the moment, \u201cno action can be taken until the markets are unpaused on Arbitrum.\u201d\n\nOrbit Chain Hit by $82 Million Hack in Cross-Chain Bridge Exploit\n\n\n\nOrbit Chain\u2019s Orbit Bridge service has also experienced a significant security breach, resulting in an $82 million loss. The hack, which occurred just before New Year\u2019s, prompted the suspension of the cross-chain bridge contract.\n\nInitial reports of unusual activity on Orbit Chain Bridge came from a social media user on Dec. 31. The hackers carried out five transactions, transferring substantial amounts of USDT, USDC, Ethereum, WBTC, and DAI into new wallets, as detailed by Arkham Intelligence.\n\nIn response to the exploit, Orbit Chain suspended the bridge contract and began on-chain negotiations with the hackers. Investigations are ongoing to understand more about the breach and track the stolen assets."

On December 12, Ethereum Classic highlighted that its Spiral Network Upgrade will be completed by January 31, 2024. This upgrade will help bring the network up to date and introduce parity to Ethereum Classic with the Shanghai Upgrade implemented on Ethereum (ETH).\n\nAs Ethereum Classic waits for the upgrade to be completed, analysts have turned bearish on the price of ETC. They project that ETC will trade sideways and even plunge in the coming weeks before surging again after the upgrade is completed. Nonetheless, the crypto seems resilient and has remained stable amid the recent meltdown in the market.\n\nOn December 31, ETC was trading at $22.20. Analysts expect ETC to rise to $25.50 in January 2024, supported by the Spiral Network Upgrade. Hence, ETC is a good crypto to buy today.\n\nVisit NuggetRush Presale Website"

        "content": "Wed 03 Jan 2024 \u25aa 3 min of reading \u25aa by Fenelon L.\n\nFor the second time in the history of crypto, Ethereum (ETH) has surpassed Bitcoin (BTC) in the percentage of long-term holders. This crucial measure demonstrates the growing confidence of investors in the future of the Ethereum network. Let\u2019s examine the reasons for this promising development.\n\nEthereum Holders More Loyal Than Bitcoin\u2019s\n\nThis new dominance of Ethereum confirms the trend observed in recent months of an increasing share of long-term holders, despite a sluggish market. According to U.Today, investors continue to accumulate ether, convinced of Ethereum\u2019s potential.\n\nSeveral factors are motivating this sustained interest. First, the rapid development of the network is promising. The migration to Proof-Of-Stake and the advent of layer 2 solutions strengthen confidence in the network\u2019s ability to scale.\n\nFurthermore, the Ethereum ecosystem continues to welcome innovative projects in DeFi, NFTs, and the metaverse, attracting new users. This virtuous dynamic encourages long-term investment.\n\nMost importantly, many believe that Ethereum has not yet fully expressed its potential, unlike mature Bitcoin. While the latter kicked off 2024 with a bang, Ethereum is still lagging 50% below its record. A clear opportunity for some patient investors, convinced of massive long-term gains.\n\nThese enticing long-term prospects are motivating an increasing number of holders to keep their tokens for several years.\n\nRisks to Watch For\n\nAlthough it is generally good news for Ethereum, this growing loyalty also presents a short-term risk. Indeed, a larger portion of the ETH supply being locked up for the very long term can reduce the available liquidity and negatively affect price dynamics.\n\nFor now, this doesn\u2019t seem to be a problem as sentiment remains positive for Ethereum. However, this potential excess must be monitored in the future.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program!

        "content": "Sei Blockchain Unveils V2 Advancements with Ethereum Compatibility and Optimistic Parallelization Jan 3, 2024\n\nSei Blockchain Unveils V2 Advancements with Ethereum Compatibility and Optimistic Parallelization\n\nThe Sei blockchain, led by the forward-thinking co-founder Jay Jog, is poised to achieve new heights as it announces the completion of foundational code for Sei V2. This significant milestone, accomplished in collaboration with renowned blockchain security firms Zellic and OtterSec, coincides with the remarkable surge of SEI, the platform\u2019s native cryptocurrency. In a span of just four months since its inception in August, SEI has reached unprecedented all-time highs.\n\nSei V2\u2019s Revolutionary Features:\n\nThe imminent launch of Sei V2 in the first quarter of 2024 brings forth a groundbreaking development\u2014the introduction of a parallelized Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Crafted by the visionary minds at Sei, this innovation amalgamates the strengths of Solana and Ethereum, potentially propelling Sei\u2019s adoption and influencing the ongoing elevation of SEI\u2019s market value.\n\nThree Key Enhancements:\n\nThe Sei V2 overhaul encompasses three crucial enhancements. Foremost is the newfound Ethereum compatibility, providing support for EVM within the Sei Network. With the aim of capitalizing on Ethereum\u2019s widespread popularity across the development community, tooling landscape, and wallet services, Sei\u2019s innovative strides aim for harmonious interoperability.\n\nOptimistic Parallelization and Efficiency Measures:\n\nSei V2 introduces Optimistic Parallelization, a monumental stride that liberates developers from transaction dependency constraints, enabling more versatile and agile development processes. The blockchain itself takes charge of parallelization, promising unparalleled efficiency and cost-effectiveness in transaction processing.\n\nAddressing concerns related to full node efficiency and state bloat, Sei V2 introduces SeiDB\u2014a novel storage method designed to fortify the robustness of the Sei Network and enhance overall system performance, ensuring the network\u2019s resilience.\n\nImplications for Ethereum Layer-2 Alternatives:\n\nSei V2 presents groundbreaking implications for Ethereum layer-2 alternatives like Base and Arbitrum. With the potential to match or even surpass these solutions in transaction processing speed, Jay Jog, in a statement from November, projected an awe-inspiring theoretical throughput of 12,500 transactions per second for Sei V2.\n\nSEI\u2019s Market Trajectory:\n\nAmid these remarkable developments, SEI\u2019s market trajectory remains resolutely positive, experiencing significant price escalations. Since its introduction in August 2023, SEI\u2019s value has multiplied impressively by 11, consistently reaching new highest figures.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThe advancements introduced by Sei V2 underscore the platform\u2019s commitment to innovation and interoperability. With Ethereum compatibility, Optimistic Parallelization, and efficiency measures, Sei is poised to redefine transaction processing speed and system resilience. The concurrent surge in SEI\u2019s market value reflects the market\u2019s recognition of Sei\u2019s strategic advancements, setting the stage for continued growth and influence in the blockchain landscape."

However, competition for block space quickly picked back up amid a flurry of memecoin trading amid the increasing popularity of Telegram trading bots, with 86,825.5 ($206.5M) coins removed from supply between the start of November and Dec. 30.\n\nMore than 337,333 ETH have been removed from supply since Ethereum\u2019s Shanghai upgrade, also known as The Merge, was activated in September 2022. The upgrade booted Proof of Work miners from the network, reducing the rate of new Ether issuance by roughly 90% and paving the way for Ethereum\u2019s burn mechanism to offset newly minted ETH in the form of staking rewards.\n\nEthereum burn rate since The Merge. Source: Ultra Sound Money.\n\nFor comparison, 4.94M ETH ($11.7B) worth of Ether would have entered supply under Proof of Work consensus.\n\nGas fees fall post-merge\n\nDespite Ethereum largely making good on its deflationary promise so far, the increasing migration of users to Ethereum\u2019s Layer 2 ecosystem has resulted in mainnet fee volumes far dropping compared to before The Merge was activated. The trend has also been exacerbated by the extended NFT downtrend coupled with upgrades reducing the gas intensiveness of interacting with non-fungible tokens.\n\nAccording to a Jan. 2 blog post from Evan Van Ness, an investor in Starbloom Ventures and author of Week In Ethereum, transaction fees were 2.5 times higher prior to The Merge.\n\nVan Ness estimated that 2,700 ETH has been burned on average each day since The Merge, compared to 6,500 on average from the introduction of Ethereum\u2019s burn mechanism in August 2021 until the Shanghai upgrade was activated.\n\n\u201cWith gas fees reverting to pre-merge levels, average daily burn will be approximately 8-10x higher,\u201d Van Ness said. However, the analyst noted that the growing adoption of Layer 2 rollups \u201cmay keep gas fees from going crazy."

As of 18th December, AMBCrypto found that activity around inscriptions accounted for 39% of the virtual blockspace on the network.\n\nInterestingly, while Ethereum witnessed a lesser sales volume than the Bitcoin network, it recorded a higher transaction count in December. AMBCrypto found that the total count of NFT transactions completed on Ethereum during the 31-day period totaled 698,201.\n\nOn the other hand, the Bitcoin network registered only 493,516 transactions.\n\nThe market so far this month\n\nWith four days into the new trading year, the Bitcoin network remains in the lead regarding NFT sales transactions. So far this year, the chain has recorded a sales volume of $61.08 million.\n\nHowever, Ethereum has seen an NFT sales volume of $27 million, according to data from CryptoSlam.\n\nDespite the high activity on the Bitcoin network, the general market has witnessed a retracement in NFT sales activity in the last week. Data from NFTGo showed a decline in NFT sales volume and market capitalization in the last seven days.\n\nInformation from the data provider showed that NFT sales volume in the general market had totaled $116 million in the last week, dropping by 10%.\n\nLikewise, the NFT market capitalization had reduced by 3% during the same period."

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nA recent plummet in the value of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) has caught the attention of whales who were looking for good entries. Notably, two whale wallets have seized this dip as an opportunity, making substantial purchases of WBTC and ETH at what many are considering \"the bottom.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe wallet designated as 0x8B20 took a bullish stance, deploying a total of $3 million USD in stablecoins to acquire 35.18 WBTC at $42,641 each and 674.18 ETH at $2,225 each.\n\nThis strategic action by cryptocurrency whales is a significant indicator of strong market sentiment. Such movements often suggest a belief among experienced investors that any forthcoming dips in price will be short-lived, offering quick recovery and providing upward momentum. Following the whales' lead, the crypto market has recouped over 5% of its value, suggesting resilience and a possible trend reversal on the horizon.\n\nThe potential approval of a Bitcoin ETF is a critical factor that could catalyze a market turnaround. Despite the common \"sell the news\" events that often follow such announcements, the approval of a Bitcoin ETF would likely boost investor confidence, attracting institutional money.\n\nAs the market navigates through these turbulent waters, the actions of whale investors offer a glimmer of optimism. The significant investments from these large-scale holders suggest a belief in the enduring value of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. If the ETF receives the green light, we may well witness a significant rally, affirming the whales' bullish maneuvers and potentially leading to a market reversal that could reshape the investment landscape."

        "content": "The governance token of the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) surged by 72% on Jan. 3 after the domain platform received praise from Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin.\n\nIn a Jan. 3 post to X (formerly Twitter), Buterin lauded the Ethereum Name Service as \u201csuper important\u201d and reiterated that the platform should remain accessible and affordable to all users of the Ethereum network, especially those on layer-2 networks.\n\nAll L2s should be working on (trustless, merkle-proof-based) CCIP resolvers, so that we can have ENS subdomains registerable, updateable and readable directly on L2s.\n\n\n\nENS is super-important, it needs to be affordable!https://t.co/Ice1lTttFE \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) January 3, 2024\n\n\u201cAll L2s should be working on (trustless, merkle-proof-based) CCIP resolvers, so that we can have ENS subdomains registerable, updateable and readable directly on L2s,\u201d said Buterin.\n\nButerin believes that layer-2 networks such as Optimism, Arbitrum and Polygon \u2014 which form an essential part of the Ethereum networks\u2019 long-term scalability \u2014 should be able to register ENS addresses to further their ease of use.\n\nThe ENS token surged 72% after an X post from Buterin. Source: CoinMarketCap\n\nShortly following Buterin\u2019s X post, the price of the ENS token surged from a yearly low of $8.50, climbing more than 72% to reach an eight-month high of $14.70, per CoinMarketCap data. The price of ENS has since leveled out and is currently trading at $12.90 at the time of publication.\n\nENS notched an all-time high of $74.25 on Nov. 28, 2021, around the same time the broader crypto market began to tumble and rapidly descended into an enduring industry-wide bear market.\n\nRelated: ENS developers urge Unstoppable Domains to drop patents or face lawsuit\n\nThe Ethereum Name Service allows crypto users to purchase a \u201c.eth\u201d domain name. This can replace the complex string of letters and numbers that typically comprise a user\u2019s wallet address, making it easier to transfer and receive funds between parties on the Ethereum network.\n\nIn September 2022, Buterin proposed introducing a 3% tax on ENS domain names, dubbed the \u201cHarberger\u201d tax proposal. Buterin said this would prevent the hoarding of domain names among early users looking to maximize profits, enabling wider adoption and more decentralized ownership of ENS addresses.\n\nMagazine: Which gaming guild positioned itself best for the bull market?"

        "content": "Goldstation, the first-ever gold DeFi platform on a public mainnet outside of Ethereum, combines Klaytn's low fees and latency to offer more efficient gold investments through $GPC, a gold-pegged token 1:1 backed by physical gold.\n\nSouth Korean residents will be able to convert their physical gold holdings into NFTs via The Mining Club, then using the NFT as collateral to mint $GPC. A global launch for Goldstation is planned.\n\nKlaytn Foundation and CREDER intend to expand beyond gold to tokenize more precious metals for the domestic and global markets.\n\nSINGAPORE, Jan. 2, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Klaytn Foundation, established to build and decentralize the ecosystem of South Korea's leading Layer 1 blockchain Klaytn, announced today that Klaytn Governance Council (GC) member CREDER has launched $GPC (Gold-Pegged Coin), a digital asset pegged to the real-time market price of gold; and Goldstation, a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform for $GPC, on Klaytn.\n\nKlaytn Onboards Goldstation and $GPC, Launching the First Gold RWA DeFi Platform Outside of Ethereum\n\n$GPC marks two firsts in the RWA tokenization industry \u2014 it is the first tokenized gold to be available on DeFi outside of the Ethereum ecosystem, and also the first gold-pegged token that does not charge a percentage-based commission for transactions. These two attributes allow $GPC to truly deliver on the benefits of real-world asset tokenization, with Klaytn's low gas fees allowing individuals with small investment capital to add gold to their portfolios without gas fees eating a significant portion of their investment, and the lack of percentage-based fees ensuring that trading gold on-chain remains cost-effective regardless of the amount one wishes to transact.\n\nGoldstation also marks the first-ever gold real-world asset (RWA) token DeFi platform powered by a public mainnet other than Ethereum. It will commence its services, which includes $GPC staking and more, on 24 January 2024. Goldstation will transform gold investments from conventionally relying only on market profits, into DeFi interest revenue generation opportunities. In addition, Goldstation will serve as a hyper-efficient and more profitable gold investment destination, thanks to Klaytn's low transaction fees, high TPS capabilities, and support for the ERC-3643 tokenization standard.\n\nTo mint $GPC, users will need to first convert their gold assets into NFTs via The Mining Club, which is a platform operated by CREDER that proves users' unique digital ownership of real gold assets using blockchain technology. Once a user's gold assets are recorded as an NFT, they will be able to issue $GPC at Goldstation by placing their gold NFT as collateral. This entire physical gold to $GPC tokenization process can be easily carried out with a few clicks by connecting their crypto wallets that support Klaytn, such as Kaikas, Metamask, and Kakao KLIP.\n\nGoldstation is currently only available for South Korean residents, with plans for a global launch in the future.\n\nLeading up to the launch, Klaytn Foundation worked closely with CREDER, sharing its business network of leading domestic and foreign partners while cooperating for regulatory compliance, platform optimization, and domestic and global marketing. In addition, as Klaytn recently integrated support for the ERC-3643 tokenization standard, Klaytn Foundation and CREDER plan to comprehensively expand precious metals RWA tokenization beyond gold in the future.\n\n\"Gold NFTs and $GPC can be ledgered on-chain for anyone through Oracle Network's Proof of Reserve (POR),\" said James Lim, CEO of CREDER, \"we will create a new standard for RWA with Klaytn based on the power of transparency and trust that Web 3.0 finance will deliver.\"\n\n\"We are very pleased that Klaytn is the mainnet of choice for CREDER's Goldstation, the first gold RWA token DeFi platform outside of the Ethereum ecosystem,\" said Sam Seo, Representative Director of Klaytn Foundation. \"Klaytn Foundation has been working together with CREDER's meticulous preparation for $GPC and Goldstation. Moving forward, we will closely cooperate with them to deliver more diverse metal RWA tokenization projects for the domestic and global markets.\"\n\nAbout CREDER, Blockchain Financial Platform\n\nFounded in 2022, CREDER (CEO James Im) is a digital transformation (DX) company that is conducting Korea's first 100% real gold-based RWA (Real World Asset) tokenization business. It has developed a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform that can utilize the issuance of gold NFTs and tokens linked to real gold. CREDER is currently the governance council (hereinafter referred to as GC) of Korea's leading global Layer 1 blockchain platform, Klaytn. More information about CREDER can be found at https://www.creder.biz.\n\nAbout Klaytn Foundation\n\nKlaytn Foundation was established in 2020 to expand the ecosystem of Klaytn, a global Layer 1 blockchain platform, and has since been actively collaborating with its Governance Council members worldwide. Klaytn Foundation facilitates the adoption and development of new technologies to ensure that Klaytn fulfills its role as an open, trusted, and sustainable blockchain platform for developers and users alike. It also facilitates decision-making to ensure that the ecosystem continues to expand optimally in the rapidly changing blockchain landscape. In line with its long-term Governance Roadmap, Klaytn Foundation plans to fully implement the Decentralization Phase of the Klaytn blockchain in 2023 and beyond.\n\nPhoto - https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2309464/Klaytn.jpg\n\nLogo - https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2309465/Klaytn_final_Logo.jpg"

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nRaoul Pal warns of potential crypto bubble cycle.\n\nPal predicts a 20% year-on-year increase for NASDAQ by May 2024\n\nHe also thinks a Ethereum will be bullish in the first half of 2024.\n\nHe foresees sustained growth for Bitcoin beyond 2025 and the emergence of an altcoin season due to rising liquidity.\n\nFormer Goldman Sachs executive Raoul Pal recently suggested that the crypto markets might be approaching a colossal bubble cycle.\n\nIn a recent discussion with crypto enthusiast Scott Melker, the macroeconomics expert and CEO of Real Vision expressed that although he perceives the current market cycle as typical, there\u2019s a 20% probability it could escalate into an enormous bubble cycle.\n\nMassive Bubble Scenario Possible\n\nRaoul Pal outlined his assessment of the probable future of crypto market cycles, attributing a 60% chance to a regular cycle akin to the last one or perhaps more reminiscent of the 2017 cycle, which witnessed some frenzy. He considers there to be a 20% likelihood that the current cycle might be compressed in time due to overwhelming retail demand, potentially leading to a shorter cycle than anticipated.\n\nPal reflected on the possibility that, similar to previous cycles, this one might also fall short of expectations in terms of duration. Additionally, he allocated another 20% probability to the scenario of a massive bubble cycle, comparable to those seen in 2012-2013 and 2015, driven by the now widespread ability for participation, potentially leading to extreme market behavior.\n\nPal expressed uncertainty about which of these three scenarios will materialize, but believes each holds a substantial chance of unfolding.\n\nPal observed that the prevailing investor sentiment leans towards a shorter market cycle. However, he noted that, while investors might be correct about the rising prices, they are likely mistaken about the actual duration of the cycle being shorter.\n\nHe said: \u201cEveryone was a little shocked we didn\u2019t have a final leg the last time around, so they\u2019ve now got that imprint\u2026 so now they\u2019re all expecting it to be a smaller cycle. And I always look for where the crowd can be wrong but still be right, which is [that] it goes up, but it goes up more [than they think].\u201d\n\nEthereum Poised for Bullish Start\n\nCurrent projections for the NASDAQ suggest a possible increase of 20% year-on-year, potentially climbing to $175,000 by May 2024. In tandem, Ethereum\u2019s trajectory, which aligns with the global liquidity index, shows a bullish trend for the first half of 2024. Predictions say it could reach around $5,300.\n\nPal revisits his \u201ceverything code\u201d theory, highlighting the strategies of central banks in balancing the devaluation of currency to manage interest payments on burgeoning debts. This concept offers a lens to understand the recurring patterns in economic cycles.\n\nThrough an analysis of major trends since 1990, Pal identified Bitcoin and the NASDAQ as key influencers. He notes the consistent superior performance of the NASDAQ, which is expected to potentially reach between $25,000 to $30,000 by the end of the current cycle. His analysis provides a historical context to the evolving trajectories of these major financial assets.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Long-Term Growth and Altcoin Season Potential\n\nPal delved into Bitcoin\u2019s cyclical nature and foresaw continued growth for the digital asset beyond 2025. He also explored the possibility of an altcoin season, fueled by increasing liquidity, indicating a broader uptrend in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nA few insights from .@RaoulGMI on the current crypto market: 1. \u201cDon\u2019t f*ck this up\u201d. pic.twitter.com/1JJNx5w3Qo \u2014 Real Vision (@RealVision) November 30, 2023\n\nPal advocated for a focused approach, recommending Bitcoin and Solana as core holdings. He stressed the importance of adopting a structured strategy and allocating a small portion of investments for speculative bets.\n\nNavigating Correction and Identifying Key Trends\n\nDespite the current market correction in crypto, Pal maintained a long-term perspective, emphasizing the importance of capturing the overall trend. He suggested a potential shift in focus from Bitcoin to Ethereum, driven by upcoming events and reduced Ethereum supply.\n\nPal explained his decision to shift Ethereum holdings to Solana, citing breakout patterns on price charts and network activity. He expressed immense optimism towards the Exponential Age, urging viewers to appreciate its transformative potential."

Discover SCENE\n\nA new Solana project called \u201cLess Fn Gas\u201d captured the attention of Crypto Twitter earlier this week when it airdropped 40% of its LFG token supply to Ethereum users.\n\nIt was a ploy to entice Ethereum maxis to give Solana a try\u2014hop over the proverbial fence, see that the grass on the SOL DeFi field might actually be greener, and, well, spend less f\u2019n gas. (That is, of course, spend less on transaction fees, which can be quite expensive on Ethereum.)\n\nAnd despite soaring to a $129 million fully diluted market cap, and then crashing down to around $25 million once the hype began to fade, the team behind the project isn\u2019t stopping there. They\u2019re now planning a second airdrop\u2014one that will be even more inclusive than the first\u2014and establish a grants program for Ethereum devs who make the switch to Solana, a pseudonymous core team member of LFG tells Decrypt.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOver 50,000 ETH users claimed the LFG airdrop within the first 24 hours of the token launching on Monday. Wormhole, a popular bridge between Ethereum and Solana saw $35 million in volume the same day\u2014the first time it\u2019s seen an increase since Solana meme coins started cooling down last week. It apparently burned too hot too fast, though, and the token is now down roughly 80% from its peak on Tuesday.\n\nOne of the pseudonymous devs behind LFG, who goes by Bobby Axelrod (borrowing the name and likeness of the character from the Showtime series \u201cBillions\u201d), told Decrypt that he\u2019s spoken with high-profile members of the Solana community about building a project to bring Ethereum users over to Solana.\n\n\u201cI don't know how many of the 50,000 users that claimed are genuinely new to Solana, but judging by how many DMs I have asking how to set up a damn Phantom wallet, I\u2019d guess there\u2019s a lot,\u201d he said, referring to the popular Solana wallet Phantom.\n\nThe project got the attention of some of the key thought leaders from the Solana community, including Kyle Salmani, Multicoin Capital founder, and even Solana\u2019s co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko.\n\n\ud83d\udc09\ud83d\udc09\ud83d\udc32 check all links and always use a burner wallet https://t.co/BCUOZp3VOy \u2014 toly \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@aeyakovenko) January 2, 2024\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEth people This is a good reason to try solana.

But this one managed to fool the CEO and co-founder of Nest Wallet, Bill Lou, who fell victim to the wallet-draining scam.\n\nI'm devastated guys...

The next one will target a wider audience\u2014users only will have to have spent $1,000 in gas to be eligible.

        "content": "The Ethereum price is exchanging hands at $2,237 as of 1:30 a.m., down 5.78% over the last 24 hours.\n\nETH experienced a 13% drop on Jan. 3 as its price dropped from a high of $2,385 to $2,100 within two hours, levels last seen in early December 2023.\n\nThe flash downswing resulted in liquidations of more than $100,000 worth of ETH futures, which were leveraged bets on the price increase.\n\nThe downswing has left traders debating the significance of the price correction with the Decilizer crypto community acknowledging that ETH had the most losses.\n\nBIG DAY FOR $BTC \ud83d\udd25\n\nGrayscale is in talks with JPMorgan & Goldman Sachs for its Bitcoin ETF. Meanwhile, #Crypto hack losses dropped 51% in 2023, but Ethereum $ETH saw the most losses.\n\nSecurity measures are improving, but the industry must stay vigilant. \ud83d\udea8#Bitcoin #BitcoinETF pic.twitter.com/ZCFafTZTFG \u2014 Decilizer (@decilizer) January 4, 2024\n\nIs this the end of the bullish momentum for the largest altcoin by market capitalization? Note that Ether has tried without success to break above the $2,400 thrice over the last month alone. This is also the third time the smart contract\u2019s token dropped toward the $2,000 zone over the same period.\n\nThe Jan. 3 marketwide sell-off appears to be triggered by an analysis report published by the digital assets platform Matrixport. The firm asserted that the SEC plans to reject the spot Bitcoin ETFs. Crypto prices crashed within an hour of the report\u2019s release.\n\nCan ETH reclaim the $2,300 Level?\n\nThe cause of the 13% flash crash on Jan. 3 may never be definitively determined. This does not necessarily invalidate Ether\u2019s bull run or make gains above the $2,400 resistance less likely before the ETF decision.\n\nFor now, the bulls have to focus on reclaiming the $2,300 level. The long lower wick on Wednesday\u2019s candlestick suggests that the buyers are aggressively defending teh $2,000 support level.\n\nIncreased buying from the current level could see ETH scale higher with the first target being a return to $2,300 and later the equal highs around $2,300. If this happens, it will indicate the ability of the buyers to confront resistance from the $2,400 major resistance.\n\nETH/USD Daily Chart\n\nSupporting this bullish outlook was the upward-facing moving averages. Ether also sat on strong support on the downside. These were areas defined by the 50-day exponential moving average (EMA) at $2,182, the $2,000 psychological level, embraced by the 100-day EMA, and the 200-day EMA at $1,930.\n\nThe relative strength index (RSI) was also facing upwards, a suggestion that day traders had begun re-entering the market.\n\nOn the downside, failure to climb back above $2,300 would imply the inability of the buyers to sustain the uptrend. The bears would then pull the price toward the 50-day with the downside probably being capped around the $2,000 buyer congestion zone.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "If interest rates continue to decline, it will likely boost the appeal of cryptocurrencies, given their higher risk profile compared to most other assets.\n\nEthereum encountered some turbulence earlier today, dropping below the $2,100 mark, only to swiftly rebound and exhibit renewed strength.\n\nThis suggests that some investors reacted nervously, while others seized the opportunity to make purchases.\n\nThis pattern will likely persist since easy access to funds tends to push cryptocurrency prices higher.\n\nLooking ahead, it seems only a matter of time before buyers drive this market to higher levels, possibly targeting the $2,500 range and even extending towards $2,750. However, it's important to acknowledge that the cryptocurrency market, in general, is known for its volatility. Be cautious with your position sizing because of this, but at the end of the day it looks like each of these pullbacks are going to end up being nice buying opportunities.\n\nBuying dips in this market\n\nConsidering this, it's prudent to consider buying during price dips, but exercising caution and not committing all of your capital immediately. The ongoing activities of institutional investors as they establish new positions for the upcoming year will likely contribute to market fluctuations. Additionally, monitoring the U.S. bond market and interest rates is essential, as rising interest rates can negatively impact cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum. As you go further along the risk spectrum, things get even more volatile.\n\nIf interest rates continue to decline, it will likely boost the appeal of cryptocurrencies, given their higher risk profile compared to most other assets. In light of these factors, it appears that buying opportunities during price dips are still viable, as demonstrated earlier today when the market swiftly turned around at approximately $1,950. However, it's crucial to be prepared for the inherent volatility that characterizes this situation.\n\nForex Brokers We Recommend in Your Region See full brokers list\n\nAt the end of the day, Ethereum experienced a dip below $2,100 followed by a rapid recovery, highlighting the market's resilience. The potential for easy access to funds is expected to keep driving cryptocurrency prices higher. Buyers are likely to push Ethereum towards the $2,500 and $2,750 levels in the near future. Nevertheless, it's essential to exercise caution and not rush to invest all your capital. Institutional activities for the new year and developments in U.S. interest rates should be monitored closely, as they can impact the cryptocurrency market. Overall, buying opportunities during price dips remain a viable strategy, but investors must be prepared for the accompanying volatility.\n\nReady to trade our Ethereum forecast?

        "title": "ERC-20 Token Standard Explained - LCX",
        "content": "What Is the ERC-20 Standard?\n\nERC-20 is a technical standard used on the Ethereum Blockchain for smart contracts. It is an acronym for \u201cEthereum Request for Comment 20\u201d and was proposed in 2015 by Fabian Vogelsteller. Developers can establish their own tokens on this blockchain by adhering to the ERC-20 standard. This standard facilitates the creation and deployment of tokens by providing a common set of interfaces and functions that can be used by various token contracts. This implies that ERC-20 tokens are interoperable and can be traded on Ethereum-based decentralized exchanges (DEXs).\n\nThe Ethereum Blockchain is a decentralized platform that enables developers to construct and deploy decentralized applications (dApps), smart contracts, and digital tokens. Developers must adhere to the ERC-20 standard in order to establish their own digital tokens on the Ethereum Blockchain. These tokens represent numerous assets, including utility tokens, security tokens, and stablecoins. ERC-20 tokens are fungible, meaning that they can be exchanged for other tokens of the same type and value. For instance, a single ERC-20 token for a specific project has the same value as any other token of that project. This is due to the fact that all ERC-20 tokens share the same properties, such as a name, symbol, and decimals, as well as functions, such as transferring tokens between addresses and verifying an address\u2019s balance.\n\nERC-20 tokens can represent any type of asset, including utility tokens, security tokens, and stablecoins such as Tether (USDT) or USD Coin (USDC). They can be used for fundraising for a new project, creating a loyalty programme for a business, or granting access to a specific service or product.\n\nThe ERC-20 standard specifies six required and three optional functions that developers must include in their smart contract code in order to generate an ERC-20 token. These functions include:\n\nTotalSupply: This function returns the entire number of tokens that have been generated for a specific project.\n\nBalanceOf: This function returns the token balance held by a specified address.\n\nTransfer: This function enables an address to transmit tokens to another address.\n\nApprove: With this function, an address can authorize another address to spend tokens on its behalf.\n\nTransferFrom: This function enables an address to receive tokens from another address that has granted permission for the transfer.\n\nAllowance: This function returns the number of tokens an authorized address is permitted to spend on behalf of another address.\n\nThe three optional functions that developers can add to the contract code for ERC-20 tokens are:\n\nName: The function returns the token\u2019s name.\n\nSymbol: This function returns the token\u2019s emblem (typically a few letters or characters representing the token).\n\nDecimals: This function returns the number of decimal digits that the token can be divided into.\n\nIn addition to the six required and three optional functions, developers can add additional functions and features to ERC-20 token contracts. Time-based restrictions on token transfers or special incentive structures for early adopters are examples of additional features.\n\nNotably, while ERC-20 has become the most prominent standard for creating tokens on Ethereum, there are other token standards, such as ERC-721 and ERC-1155. Each of these standards has its own distinct characteristics and use cases, but ERC-20 remains the most popular and widely adopted standard.\n\nNotably, ERC-20 tokens require the Ethereum network in order to function. When you send an ERC-20 token from one address to another, you will be required to pay a small quantity of ETH (in the form of gas fees) to cover the cost of processing the transaction on the network.\n\nHow Does ERC20 Work?\n\nERC20 is a standard protocol, not a piece of software or a program. The ERC20 protocol governs the creation of new tokens, ensuring that they conform to the necessary technical requirements. If a token does not adhere to the technical specifications specified by ERC20, it will not meet the definition of an ERC20 token and will not be issued on the network.\n\nIt may be useful to compare ERC20 to HTTP, the Hypertext Transfer Protocol used by websites. HTTP specifies how internet messages are formatted and transmitted, as well as how servers and web browsers should respond to various commands.\n\nSimilarly, ERC20 specifies the essential characteristics and functionality of tokens based on Ethereum. Uncompliant tokens cannot be issued, transferred, or listed on exchanges.\n\nThe ERC20 Standard\n\nTo utilise ERC20 tokens, smart contracts must adhere to the applicable ERC standards. Currently, there are nine laws, and six of them are mandatory. The remaining three are optional. These consist of:\n\nMandatory Rules Optional Rules Allowance Token Name Approve Decimal (MAX:18) TransferFrom Symbol Transfer BalanceOf TotalSupply\n\nThese principles must be incorporated into a token\u2019s code for it to qualify as ERC20. Without explicit instructions for these rules or standards, the token would not be able to interact with smart contracts effectively, which could result in a variety of problems.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe ERC-20 token standard has played a pivotal role in the evolution of blockchain technology and the Ethereum ecosystem. Its simplicity, interoperability, and flexibility have enabled the creation of diverse tokens that power a wide array of decentralized applications. As the blockchain space continues to grow and evolve, the ERC-20 standard will remain a fundamental building block, and its influence will extend beyond this network into other blockchain networks. Understanding ERC-20 tokens is crucial for anyone interested in the world of blockchain and cryptocurrency, as they continue to shape the future of finance, gaming, and digital asset ownership."

Meanwhile, Meme Moguls (MGLS) has launched a $10,000 mega giveaway. This new ICO, currently in Stage 3 of its presale, is also making headlines as experts foresee it becoming the next 100x meme coin. Keep on reading and find out why.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction\n\nRenowned for insightful analysis, Micha\u00ebl Van De Poppe recently shared an optimistic Ethereum (ETH) forecast. According to him, the Ethereum crypto is showing signs of a bottom and may soon start to take over.\n\nThe Ethereum price movement increased from $2,298 on December 23 to $2,320 on December 30. The technical analysis for this altcoin also paints a bullish picture, as 24 technical indicators are showing green. Moreover, its Fear & Greed index rating shows a 68 (Greed) \u2013 good bullish signs.\n\nExperts in the crypto field have taken note of all these factors when making their price forecasts. Therefore, they predict that the Ethereum price will reach $2,437 before January 2024 ends \u2013 making it one of the top altcoins.\n\nMeme Moguls (MGLS): The Best Cryptocurrency To Invest in\n\nMeme Moguls (MGLS) made waves in the DeFi market by launching a substantial $10,000 in MGLS tokens giveaway. To participate in this event, you must own the MGLS token, actively submit on Zealy, and increase your participation. The key here is to hold more MGLS tokens since the more you hold, the higher the chances of larger rewards. This giveaway has further increased interest in this DeFi project, which aims to dominate the meme industry.\n\n\ud83c\udf89 Exciting News!

For more info:\u2026 pic.twitter.com/FTjGFDo9Zt \u2014 Meme Moguls (@meme_moguls) December 30, 2023\n\nMeme Moguls will accomplish this by creating a unique play-to-earn (P2E) game where you can learn all there is to know about wealth-building and investments. You may even try to \u201cBear the Market\u201d and compete against an established index such as S&P 500. To beat it, your total return must exceed the S&P 500\u2019s by the end of the game\u2019s duration.\n\nAll these exciting features are powered by the MGLS native token, which serves as an in-game currency and a governance token. Holding it will enable you to vote on Meme Moguls\u2019s future and earn staking rewards. These benefits have attracted countless global investors \u2013 helping Meme Moguls raise $1.1M in Stage 3 of its presale.\n\nCurrently, one MGLS costs only $0.0025, and those who bought it early are experiencing a 31% ROI. But, this percentage will go up as the presale progresses. Experts foresee a potential surge to $0.19 once a major Tier-1 CEX lists MGLS in 2024.\n\nThis price prediction seems possible, with Decrypt reporting that a Pepe holder has turned $250 into $1.02M in just four days. Unlike Pepe, MGLS has actual utility and will gain mass adoption quicker \u2013 meaning it can provide the same growth potential. Therefore, follow the links below to purchase this game-changing meme coin while obtaining a 15% deposit bonus.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nWhile Micha\u00ebl Van De Poppe\u2019s Ethereum forecast is encouraging, its high market cap of $276B may hinder its growth. In other words, ETH would need substantial new funds for its value to experience notable surges. Even with increased adoption, this may prove difficult.\n\nOn the other hand, Meme Moguls does not have this issue, as its market cap sits at $7.5M. This means only $7.5M is needed for its current price (and returns) to double. Because of this competitive advantage, MGLS is one of the best altcoins to watch.\n\nVisit Meme Moguls\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "The turn of the new year brings new milestones for several tokens in the crypto industry. Projects like Polygon (MATIC) and Ethereum Classic (ETC) are some of the assets that reached new milestones in the last few months, making them some of the best coins to invest in this year. Meanwhile, the Everlodge (ELDG) project is rising in reputation and popularity due to several valuable factors. Find out more.\n\nPolygon (MATIC) Looking Set Resistance Level Above the $1 Threshold\n\nThe data from Coinmarketcap shows that Polygon (MATIC) has reached the $1 price value for the first time since May 2023. Based on the Polygon price chart, the coin has gained over 28% in the last month. The coins trading volume has risen by over 23% in the last few days, which means more increased trading activity.\n\nIn the meantime, the price of the Polygon token may fluctuate back below the $1 mark. Nonetheless, there are high hopes that the coin will maintain a steady growth that will see Polygon reach $2 before the end of Q1 of 2024.\n\nPositive Price Turn for Ethereum Classic (ETC)\n\nIn the crypto market, stats show that Ethereum Classic (ETC) has gained over 17% in price value within the last month. Also, the Ethereum Classic trading volume has risen by more than 20% in the last few days, with more investors joining to benefit from the ongoing rally. Although the ETC token has crossed the $20 benchmark, there is still a higher chance of a downturn in the coming weeks if it drops under $20.\n\nEthereum Classic has wallowed below the $20 mark for eight months before eventually reaching the milestone last December. As it stands, Ethereum Classic will be looking to maintain its bullish sentiment, which may propel it towards $30 within the next few months. With the anticipated bull run, Ethereum Classic is one of the best cryptos to buy for long-term gains.\n\nEverlodge (ELDG) Soars as it Synergizes Blockchain and Real Estate Investment\n\nAs a property marketplace, Everlodge (ELDG) is attracting investors due to the cutting-edge innovation that the project has kick-started.

In September 2023, JPM stated that its retail bank, Chase, in the U.K. had decided to restrict customers\u2019 access to cryptocurrency-related transactions due to increased scams and fraud cases. Nonetheless, it has been exploring the concept of launching a blockchain-based deposit token for customers, provided it receives the required regulatory approval.\n\nJPMorgan and Goldman as APs for spot Bitcoin ETF would be entrusted with the responsibility of tracking the ETF share price with underlying assets of fund. The companies will be required to create and redeem the shares of ETF, thus supplying the required liquidity.\n\nBeside this, Goldman has been focusing on growth in its core strengths of investment banking and trading since it has been pulling back from its consumer lending business. Such growth moves by GS are necessary to support its top-line expansion.\n\nStory continues\n\nPer an internal memo circulated last year, GS had disclosed changes in its senior executives\u2019 positions as it intended to expand its operations in the private credit space. It further aims to double the size of business targeting assets worth $110 billion under management over the medium term.\n\nFurther, it has been aiming to expand its offerings across the high growth countries. In December 2023, Bloomberg reported that GS was planning to enhance its credit business in India as it is one of the fastest-growing economies in the world. Per Sonjoy Chatterjee, chairman and chief executive officer of Goldman in India, the bank intends to broaden the range of its loan offerings in this country.\n\nThe firm also desires to obtain a license to boost its currency trading that would permit it to deal with counterparties like financial investors, equity customers or a corporate customer. This apart, GS believes that deal-making activity in the country is likely to receive a boost.\n\nGoldman\u2019s shares have gained 16.9% over the past six months compared with the industry\u2019s 11.3% growth.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nGS presently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).\n\nYou can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Bitcoin Cash To Hit USD 100K, Says Roger Ver (Bullish on Ethereum Too) - Cryptonews",
        "content": "Bitcoin Cash To Hit USD 100K, Says Roger Ver (Bullish on Ethereum Too)\n\nNow the third worst-performing major cryptoasset, bitcoin cash (BCH), in 2030, will be worth almost 229 times its current price, according to Roger Ver, tech entrepreneur and investor and Bitcoin Cash evangelist, who said is also bullish on ethereum (ETH).\n\nRoger Ver. Source: a video screenshot.\n\n\u201cThe more useful something is, the more people will use it,\u201d Ver told Cryptonews.com, estimating a sharp increase in bitcoin cash holders and users in 2021. He also keeps claiming that \u201cBCH is far more useful than BTC for everything except for speculation so far.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt does have far more potential upside as well,\u201d continued Ver, estimating that BCH might reach USD 100,000 by the end of this decade. According to his estimations, the price might hit USD 800 next year and USD 10,000 in 2027.\n\nIn November 2019, when BCH was trading at around USD 290, Ver said that this cryptoasset, forked from BTC, could go up by 99,900% \u201csome day.\u201d\n\nToday, the 8th largest cryptoasset by market capitalization trades at USD 435 (14:38 UTC) and is up by 7% in a day and 24% in a week. The price rallied by almost 53% in a month and 83% in a year.\n\nHowever, compared with other cryptoassets from the top 10 club, during the past 12 months, BCH is outperformed by six tokens (excluding stablecoin tether), which are up by 260%-756% in the same period of time.\n\nMeanwhile, Nexo Co-founder and Managing Partner Antoni Trenchev previously told Cryptonews.com that BCH\u2019s fundamentals will support its price into 2021, despite recent controversies surrounding its November hard fork.\n\n\u201cBCH has a string of aces up its sleeve: a well-educated community, loyal investors, retail distribution, and actual real-life use cases. We believe that these benefits could change BCH from an underdog to a medal-winner in 2021 if only Bitcoin Cash gets its act together,\u201d said Trenchev.\n\nIn either case, as for the near-term plans, specifically for 2021, Ver said that the Tor-integrated, decentralized privacy protocol that obscures real spending Cash Fusion \u201cenables super strong privacy for Bitcoin Cash,\u201d and that \u201cintegrating it into the Bitcoin.com wallet will be a big deal for BCH.\u201d\n\nHe claimed that \u201c2021 will be the best year for BCH yet,\u201c adding that it now has fully functioning crowdfunding thanks to Flipstarter which is built on Bitcoin Cash, the public DeFi product also built on this network called AnyHedge, tokens thanks to Simple Ledger Protocol (SLP) for issuing tokens on this blockchain, instant tipping on every platform via Bitcoin.com wallet, as well as acceptance at more than 100,000 websites via crypto payments provider Bitpay and at \u201csoon to be over\u201d 100,000 physical merchants via crypto payments network GoCrypto, said Ver.\n\nAs for other projects, inside the top 10 coins by market capitalization, \u201cEthereum has an amazing community and development team, so I\u2019m very bullish on them for the future,\u201d said Ver.\n\nOutside the top 10, the Avalanche (AVAX) developer AVA Labs team \u201chas attracted amazing talent,\u201d he added, while ZANO is \u201calso building an interesting platform for a privacy coin focused on commerce.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Ver finds interest-bearing stablecoins \u201care a big deal.\u201d Cryptocurrency exchange CoinFlex was first with their FlexUSD, he said, commenting that \u201cwe will see this model copied more in 2021.\u201d Coinflex announced the launch of this interest-bearing stablecoin on the Bitcoin Cash and the Ethereum networks last November.\n\nMeanwhile, the new year will bring further effort at regulating the space, finds the entrepreneur."

        "title": "Ethereum: NFT winter carries on as Bitcoin, Solana take the stage - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s NFT trading activity plummeted sharply in December 2023.\n\nA major chunk of the volumes was scooped up by Bitcoin and Solana NFTs.\n\nThe worst of the non-fungible token (NFT) market might be behind us, as the last quarter of 2023 witnessed a significant surge in sales volume after months of progressive declines.\n\nTrades worth $1.75 billion were settled in December, AMBCrypto discovered using CryptoSlam\u2019s data, the most prolific month for NFT activity since June 2022. Noticeable spikes in the number of unique buyers and sellers were also observed.\n\nAll these developments gave a strong indication that the NFT winter may have thawed.\n\nEthereum loses sheen\n\nHowever, the same cannot be said for Ethereum [ETH], which was once the largest home for world-beating NFTs but now finds itself losing a big chunk of its market dominance.\n\nAlthough data scanned by AMBCrypto revealed a notable surge in ETH NFT sales in the initial part, the momentum soon plateaued during the November to mid-December period.\n\nWorse, in the latter half of December, the trading activity plummeted sharply. In the last 30 days, the total number of NFT transactions fell 42% while the sales value dipped by 19.85%.\n\nEven a cursory look at CryptoSlam\u2019s website was enough to highlight how lackluster Ethereum has been lately in its NFT game.\n\nNone of the top 10 NFT collections by sales volume over the last month belonged to the traditional powerhouse, which birthed hugely popular brands like CryptoPunks and Bored Ape Yacht Club [BAYC].\n\nA passionate NFT proponent also emphasized Ethereum\u2019s thinning grip on the NFT market. The user Beanie took to social platform X and remarked,\n\n\u201cLiterally no volume outside of some of the top pfp projects. 1/1 and generative art down bad. I expect this market trend of new chains to continue this year and projects to migrate away.\u201d\n\nSo, who did it cede its dominance to?\n\nBitcoin takes the charge\n\nThe growth driver of the NFT industry in recent months has been Bitcoin [BTC]. In fact, BTC clocked the highest NFT sales in the last 30 days, totaling $869 million, more than doubling from the previous month.\n\nIn comparison, Ethereum generated sales of just $343 million.\n\nBitcoin-based collections were topping the charts and accounted for the bulk of the space in the top 1o collections list over the last month.\n\nThe primary driver of Bitcoin\u2019s burgeoning NFT ecosystem, as it has become pretty obvious by now, was the Ordinals protocol.\n\nNotice the two dramatic spikes in Bitcoin\u2019s NFT activity on two occasions in the past year. The first was in May, and the second was towards the tail end. Both these periods were a result of strong demand for Ordinals.\n\nFor the curious, Ordinals work by embedding images or other data directly on the chain. They can be used to create digital assets like non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\n\nOne of the biggest advantages of Ordinals is that they are cheaper to mint and transact on the chain.\n\nSolana emerges as another success story\n\nApart from Bitcoin, Solana made rapid gains in the NFT industry in the last few months. The blockchain processed trades worth $328 million over the last 30 days, within touching distance of Ethereum\u2019s numbers.\n\nIn fact, Solana\u2019s NFT sales more than tripled in December, with similar surges observed for the number of transactions, buyers, and sellers.\n\nSolana\u2019s marquee collection Mad Lads played a key role in boosting Solana\u2019s NFT market. A collection of 10,000 unique profile picture (PFP) NFTs, Mad Lads saw a 6% increase in NFT sales over the last month.\n\nHowever, the growth was led by Tensorians, the NFT collection launched by Solana\u2019s newly thriving NFT marketplace Tensor.\n\nIndeed, Tensorians registered trade volumes worth $27.7 million over the last month, marking an increase of 267%. It was the fifth-largest collection in terms of sales in the same period."

        "title": "The 19 best decentralized exchanges in 2024 - OKX",
        "content": "During the early stages of cryptocurrency, centralization was still a significant aspect of the sector. While crypto projects sought decentralization, users could only trade assets on centralized exchanges (CEXs). Over the years, developers tried to build decentralized exchanges (DEXs), but these attempts were largely unsuccessful. The main issue with DEXs back then was the need for more liquidity.\n\nThis changed with the launch of Uniswap, which started using Automated Market Maker (AMM) to build up liquidity. Suddenly, a new era of DEXs started, and today, there's a wide selection of DEXs. This guide will explain what DEXs are and how they work. It will also include a list of some of the best decentralized exchanges available.\n\nWhat is a decentralized exchange?\n\nDecentralized exchanges are peer-to-peer (P2P) swapping platforms not run by a centralized entity. DEXs are similar to centralized platforms in some ways but, for the most part, are significantly different. Some of the major differences include that they are not owned and operated by a single entity. They do not require you to deposit funds into their wallet to trade. In other words, they are non-custodial trading platforms.\n\nDEXs also only offer assets that run on the same blockchain as the exchange. However, cross-chain DEXs can also use assets from different chains. Decentralized exchanges are run via smart contracts and do not require order books to match traders. Instead, they use AMMs and liquidity pools from where they draw the funds offered by other users. DEXs also tend to provide significantly lower trading fees and greater security.\n\nThe 19 best decentralized exchanges available right now\n\n1. Uniswap\n\nThe first on the list of the best decentralized exchanges is Uniswap \u2014 Ethereum's first and largest DEX. Uniswap is a strong choice for those who wish to grow their assets. The platform is extremely popular; its average daily volume often exceeds $4 billion. As an AMM DEX, Uniswap manages its decentralized liquidity pool through an algorithm. Its purpose is to determine the best swap rate for each trading pair.Customers can use established liquidity pools or even create their own. Those who provide liquidity \u2014 liquidity providers \u2014 earn by receiving a portion of the trading fees. The platform is entirely governed by a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), meaning its users are in control.\n\nPros:\n\nOffers more than 400 tokens\n\nA large, reputable, and established exchange platform\n\nHigh trading volume\n\nDAO-governed\n\nUsers can generate passive earnings through staking\n\nTransaction fees from 0.1% to 1%\n\nCons:\n\nNo fiat transactions\n\nThe risk of impermanent loss is always present\n\nGas fees\n\n2. OKX DEX\n\nNext, we have OKX DEX \u2014 a cross-chain, multi-chain DEX aggregator that aims to provide users with the optimal transaction from across 20+ chains, 300+ DEX and 200,000+ coins. OKX's DEX features a decentralized, borderless trading platform that is secure and non-custodial.\n\nThe OKX DEX can offer a seamless trading experience and relatively low trading fees. Its chain focuses on providing a better, more dedicated infrastructure than Ethereum. This makes it an attractive option for DApps, DEXs, and other blockchain products.\n\nPros:\n\nHigh security\n\nNon-custodial platform\n\nGreat exchange rates\n\nOrder matching through a call auction mechanism\n\nUser-friendly design\n\nDecentralized governance\n\nApproval-free listing\n\nCross-chain gateway\n\nCons:\n\nLow liquidity for certain cryptocurrencies\n\nCommissions are not displayed until the order is created\n\n3. ApeX Pro\n\nApeX Pro is known as one of the best decentralized exchanges due to its elastic AMM model. This model improves capital efficiency and makes transactions feel like spot trading. It also features an order book interface, which makes it easier for beginners to use. The platform integrates StarkWare's layer 2 scalability engine, contributing to the exchange's security. If the DEX is ever out of service, traders can use the engine to retrieve their funds. It even features up to 20x leverage for any token on the derivatives market.\n\nPros:\n\nHigh performance\n\nSecurity and privacy\n\nLow fees\n\nHigh leverage\n\nOrder book model\n\nCons:\n\nLimited trading instruments\n\nIt doesn't have tiered fees\n\n4. Curve\n\nCurve is one of the best DEXs for traders worried about volatility. Curve is another AMM DEX, and like Uniswap, it uses Ethereum's decentralized network. However, it's also unique in some aspects. It features its token, CRV, which is used for governance by granting voting rights to its holders.\n\nPros:\n\nOffers over 45 tokens\n\nTransaction fees are at around 0.04%\n\nToken holders get to vote on important decisions\n\nCons:\n\nA steep learning curve due to complex interface\n\nHigh gas fees\n\n5. KyberSwap\n\nFifth on the list of the best DEXs is KyberSwap. This is the flagship product of the Kyber Network. Commonly compared to Uniswap, this is also an AMM DEX, although it has some features that make it stand out. The exchange platform operates with multiple liquidity pools. Furthermore, its pools are more profound than most other DEXs. This is why numerous DeFi applications use KyberSwap as their underlying protocol. The platform rewards each liquidity provider with a 0.3% fee when a specific pair is traded. All rewards and trading fees are paid in KNC, the exchange platform's native token.\n\nPros:\n\nSupports over 1,500 tokens\n\nThousands of available swap pairs\n\nLiquidity providers receive a 0.3% fee\n\nOffers staking, farming, and DApp solutions\n\nCons:\n\nNo fiat deposits\n\nNo mobile app\n\nMay be difficult for new traders to use\n\n6. dYdX\n\nUnlike most other DEXs, dYdX is an order book DEX. As such, it offers a more traditional crypto market trading experience. However, it does still have some unique features. One is leveraged trading up to 5x the invested amount if users go long or short on ETH. The platform is also known as lending platform . It features cross-margin lending and borrowing. This lets users earn passively if they leave their funds on the platform. Assets that are actively used in trading can also generate interest. Also, dYdX's trading volume is second only to Uniswap.\n\nPros:\n\nUser-friendly\n\nSecond-highest trading volume among DEXs\n\nIt has a mobile app\n\nThe trading fee is only 0.1%\n\nOffers trading with leverage\n\nIt lets you generate passive earnings in multiple ways\n\nCons:\n\nNo fiat deposits\n\nLimited trading options\n\n7. 1inch\n\nThe seventh platform on the list is 1inch, which offers effortless crypto trading. This is also the best DEX aggregator on the list. The platform scans multiple DEXs before each transaction, allowing users to use the lowest prices when buying tokens. Its liquidity pool allows users to stake tokens and earn rewards in 1INCH token. By holding onto these native tokens, users also gain voting rights.\n\nPros:\n\nMore than 400 tokens on offer\n\nZero transaction fees\n\n1INCH holders can participate in governance\n\nExcellent exchange rates\n\nCons:\n\nOther DEXs might charge transaction fees\n\nMay be difficult for new traders to use\n\n8. Balancer\n\nNext, we have another Ethereum-based DEX called Balancer. This is a platform that executes quick trades by using smart contracts and liquidity pools. It's an AMM and provides users with several liquidity pools. Users can even build their own pools and select one of three types. These include smart pools, private pools, and shared pools.\n\nPros:\n\nGas-free payments despite being on Ethereum\n\nMultiple pool types to choose from when creating your own pool\n\nQuick and easy to use\n\nIt lets you generate passive earnings\n\nCons:\n\nTransaction fees can vary depending on pool owners, going from 0.0001% to 10%\n\n9. Bancor\n\nNext up is Bancor \u2014 another credible DEX. Bancor was among the first AMMs to emerge on Ethereum back in 2017. The platform finalizes trades immediately with automatic liquidity. This feature makes Bancor one of the best decentralized exchanges for many traders. Apart from that, the platform's native token, BNT, facilitates fast, effortless payments. The exchange prevents impermanent loss through staking, which is possible via multiple pools. Both staking rewards and BNT contributions return excellent rewards. However, the best rewards come to those who simultaneously stake BNT and other cryptos.\n\nPros:\n\nIt's a trustworthy and established platform\n\nProtects users from impermanent loss\n\nExchange fees vary but remain low\n\nCons:\n\nNo fiat support\n\nUsers must keep their assets in Bancor wallet\n\n10. Slingshot\n\nSlingshot is a popular Ethereum-based swapping protocol that features 0% fees. Founded in 2020, the platform can search for, send, receive, or swap crypto. The platform is available on both mobile and desktop. It features multi-chain and bridging support for several networks. Those include Canto, Polygon, Arbitrum, Binance BNB Chain, Arbitrum Nova, and Optimism.\n\nPros:\n\nIntuitive interface\n\nAdvanced trading tools\n\nIt lets you compare prices across multiple exchanges\n\nStop loss and limit orders are available\n\nCons:\n\nNeeds verification\n\nYou must meet a minimum deposit requirement to participate\n\n11. CowSwap\n\nThe eleventh DEX on the list is CowSwap, a DEX that facilitates the trade of Ethereum-based tokens. It does this by matching supply and demand. It also prevents slippage and fees. However, orders that fail to find a Peer-to-Peer match are sent to the underlying AMM. CowSwap, therefore, allows users to experience both approaches. Users get to execute trades with the best price on-chain across all aggregators and exchanges.\n\nPros:\n\nFully permissionless Meta DEX aggregator\n\nHigh security and privacy to protect trades\n\nMaximized liquidity\n\nNumerous token pairs\n\nGas-less trading for off-chain order submissions\n\nCons:\n\nExploited in a hacking attack\n\nStill relatively new\n\n12. IDEX\n\nNext up, we have IDEX, which also runs on Ethereum's network. This is the perfect platform for active traders with high trading volume, as they can complete multiple trades simultaneously. Cancellations are also possible with no gas fees. Also, the platform features both market orders and limit orders. Security is also high due to advanced protection mechanisms. It's also worth noting that IDEX uses CEXs and DEXs to support trades and improve security.\n\nPros:\n\nIt supports around 26 tokens\n\nStaking is available\n\nGas-free cancellations of trades\n\nMinimal risk of security breaches\n\nTransaction fees are only 0.1%\n\nCons:\n\nComplex interface\n\nNo fiat support\n\nUsers must confirm trades with private keys\n\n13. DEX.AG\n\nNext on the list is DEX.AG, which is an aggregator that gets liquidity from other DEXs. Some of them are even on this list. Combing these platforms before executing trades allows users to get some of the best prices. Not only that, but users can save time and energy.\n\nPros:\n\nZero fees\n\nSuperior UI\n\nSaves time and energy\n\nOffers the best prices\n\nCons:\n\nYou might have to pay fees from other DEXs\n\n14. AirSwap\n\nIn the next spot we have AirSwap, which operates on Ethereum, so users must pay ETH gas fees. Other than that, there are no fees charged by the platform. The exchange has its native token, AST, which can be swapped with any ERC-20 token. Deposits and withdrawals are instant, so the user experience is excellent.\n\nPros:\n\nZero fees\n\nMinimal risk of security breaches\n\nMultiple tokens supported\n\nCons:\n\nPeer-to-Peer trading is only completed when a suitable trader has been located\n\n15. SushiSwap\n\nSushiSwap is one of the best-known DEXs in the crypto industry. It evolved from Uniswap and deserves to be on the list of the best decentralized exchanges for several reasons. Its native token, SUSHI, allows users to generate passive earnings through staking. Various governance benefits are gained, and SushiSwap also has a unique DEX architecture that reduces the centralization of the market.\n\nPros:\n\nLow transaction fees\n\nWorks with most ERC-20 tokens\n\nHighly intuitive interface\n\nCons:\n\nComplicated rewards structure\n\nLimited in cutting-edge technology\n\n16. PancakeSwap\n\nPancakeSwap is next on our list. This is the largest DEX on the Binance Smart Chain, known for its very low-cost liquidity pools. The platform also features minimal risk of slippage. This non-custodial DEX offers automatic trading thanks to its liquidity pools. The pools run via smart contracts on the BSC. Meanwhile, the exchange's native token, CAKE, is used in staking, yield farming, or governance.\n\nPros:\n\nMore than 50 supported DeFi tokens\n\nLow transaction fees\n\nSlippage risks are significantly reduced\n\nCons:\n\nPossibility of impermanent loss\n\n17 WX. Network\n\nNext on the list is WX.Network. This DEX, formerly known as Waves, uses digital assets such as BTC and LTC. The platform also offers an initial coin offering feature, which enables crowdfunding. Its interface has been designed to be easy to use and has a unique design. It can also reduce slippage by combining centralized and decentralized functions.\n\nPros:\n\nLow risk of slippage\n\nIt uses its own blockchain\n\nExtremely low trading fees (0.03%)\n\nIntuitive UI\n\nMultiple supported assets\n\nCons:\n\nNo fiat support\n\nIt is not regulated\n\n18. Xfai\n\nNext up is Xfai, a unique DEX that adopts an automated market maker model to create entangled liquidity pools. The DEX uses a system of on-chain constant function market maker (CFMM) smart contracts, rather than the token-pair-based constant product market maker approach. This aims to address the challenges of liquidity fragmentation (where liquidity is fragmented across different platforms, making price discovery difficult) and high slippage. Hosted on both the Ethereum and Linea chain, Xfai also offers 'Infinity Staking' to users \u2014 a unique form of liquidity provisioning.\n\nPros:\n\nCustom built to avoid liquidity fragmentation and minimize slippage\n\nAllows users to trade any digital asset\n\nSimple dashboard for managing all assets in one place\n\nCons:\n\nRisk of impermanent loss from AMMs\n\nRelatively high swap fee of 0.4%\n\n19. ParaSwap\n\nFinally, ParaSwap is a popular multi-chain DeFi aggregator that aims to give traders and DApps access to the best prices, high liquidity, and fast transactions. ParaSwap achieves this by curating the liquidity of DEXs and lending protocols into a single and secure interface and API for intuitive usability. The platform combines a yield optimizer, independent smart contract audits, and advanced charts with its API functionality to help users find the most favorable prices with little effort.\n\nPros:\n\nAggregator functionality presents users with the best prices\n\nSimple access to fragmented liquidity pools\n\nHigh liquidity\n\nCons:\n\nUnable to purchase cryptocurrencies directly\n\nCannot use fiat currency to make trades\n\nShould you trade cryptocurrency on DEXs?\n\nDEXs have grown to be a massive part of the crypto trading scene. Thanks to their non-custodial nature, your funds are never put in danger during trading. The trades are instant, and everything is done through smart contracts. With that being said, even the best decentralized exchanges have their downsides. This is why it's essential to research any platform before you begin to use it.\n\nFAQs\n\nWhich is the best decentralized exchange?\n\nEach DEX has its pros and cons, so none can be described as the best. It all depends on what qualities are more important to each trader.\n\nWhat is the biggest DEX?\n\nThe largest DEX in the crypto industry is Ethereum-based Uniswap. Uniswap has the largest trading volume, the metric we used to decide the largest DEX.\n\nIs Binance a decentralized exchange?\n\nBinance is not a decentralized exchange. Quite the opposite, it is a fully-centralized crypto exchange, with custody and other services offered by similar platforms.\n\nIs Coinbase a decentralized exchange?\n\nNo, Coinbase is not a DEX either. Like Binance, Coinbase is also a regulated, centralized platform. It is the largest regulated exchange in the US."

Etherscan announced details of the acquisition on X, saying that it hopes to continue providing \u201ccredibly neutral and equitable access to blockchain data.\u201d\n\n\ud83d\udce2 We're excited to share that Solscan has now joined Etherscan! With the addition of @solscanofficial to the team, we hope to continue executing on our vision of providing credibly neutral and equitable access to blockchain data. pic.twitter.com/N8TcxQHFLi \u2014 Etherscan (@etherscan) January 3, 2024\n\nAccording to Etherscan, the integration aims to improve access and experience for the over 3 million monthly Solscan users by leveraging synergies in features and capabilities between the Ethereum and Solana explorers.\n\nEtherscan explores Ethereum data including wallet transactions and token details, offering insights into individual wallets and tokens. Solscan is a blockchain explorer specifically for Solana, featuring comprehensive analytics and user-friendly access to transactions, addresses, contracts, blocks, and tokens. Though these features are not mutually exclusive and can be found in both, Solscan has a simpler interface and provides more intuitive visualizations.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that through this acquisition, Solscan will likely be included in Etherscan\u2019s suite of products for its Explorer-as-a-Service (EaaS) offering, which includes explorers for major chains like Optimism, Arbitrum, Polygon, Linea, Scroll, and Base, among others.\n\n\u201cThe Solscan team has proven their expertise over the years by offering detailed insights and analytics. Their expertise in making blockchain data accessible and user-friendly also aligns perfectly with our mission at Etherscan,\u201d shares Matthew Tan, CEO and founder of Etherscan.\n\nEtherscan claims that the broader goal of the acquisition is to \u201cmake on-chain data easy to access, driving mainstream blockchain adoption.\u201d\n\nBlockchain explorers serve a vital purpose \u2014 they allow anyone to easily monitor activity on public ledgers. Services like Etherscan and Solscan help decode dense on-chain data into readable insight, helping contextualize information on transactions, tokens, NFTs, addresses, and more.\n\nThe acquisition can be seen as a response to demand for on-chain data as Solana\u2018s native cryptocurrency, SOL, experienced a sharp surge in 2023. Etherscan has not provided public information on the acquisition\u2019s price and terms.\n\nData from CoinGecko indicates that SOL ranks as the fifth largest cryptocurrency by market cap ($47 billion), with its spot price trading at $110, down 3.4% in the past 24-hour cycle. Using the same indicators and cycle, Ethereum\u2019s ether (ETH) has a market cap of $283.8 billion, with the token trading at $2,360, down by -1.1%."

        "content": "ENS Token Spikes by 70% After Vitalik Buterin\u2019s Post Calling it \u201cSuper Important\u201d\n\nThe governance token of the Ethereum Name Service (ENS), ENS, surged by as much as 72% on January 3 after Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin mentioned it in a post on X. Buterin wrote that ENS is \"super important\" and emphasized the need for the service to remain accessible and affordable to all users of the Ethereum network, especially those on layer-2 networks.\n\nButerin said:\n\n\"All L2s should be working on (trustless, merkle-proof-based) CCIP resolvers, so that we can have ENS subdomains registerable, updateable and readable directly on L2s.\"\n\nButerin's comments highlight the importance of ENS in the Ethereum ecosystem, as it provides a user-friendly way to interact with the network. ENS allows users to purchase a \".eth\" domain name, which can replace the complex string of letters and numbers that typically comprise a user's wallet address.\n\nShortly after Buterin's tweet, the price of ENS surged from a yearly low of $8.50 to reach an eight-month high of $14.69, according to CoinMarketCap data. The price has since leveled out and is currently trading at around $13. The ENS token has been on a downward trend since reaching an all-time high of $74.25 in November 2021.\n\nENS is an essential part of the Ethereum ecosystem, and Buterin's support is a major boost for the project. His comments underscore the importance of making ENS accessible and affordable to all users, particularly those on layer-2 networks.\n\nLet us know what you loved about this article, what could be improved, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form."

        "content": "Ethereum price failed to recover further above the $2,300 resistance. ETH is showing a few bearish signs and might revisit the $2,080 support.\n\nEthereum is struggling to clear the $2,280 and $2,300 resistance levels.\n\nThe price is trading below $2,300 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere is a major bearish trend line forming with resistance near $2,280 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair could start a fresh decline if it stays below the $2,300 resistance zone.\n\nEthereum Price Faces Rejection\n\nEthereum price started a recovery wave above the $2,120 level, like Bitcoin. ETH was able to clear the $2,200 and $2,220 resistance levels. However, the bears were active near $2,300 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThe price failed to clear the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2,430 swing high to the $1,860 low. It is now struggling to clear the $2,280 and $2,300 resistance levels. There is also a major bearish trend line forming with resistance near $2,280 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.\n\nEthereum is now below $2,300 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average, but it is still above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $1,860 swing low to the $2,289 high.\n\nOn the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $2,280 level and the trend line. The first major resistance is now near $2,300. A close above the $2,300 resistance could start a decent upward move. The next key resistance is near $2,400.\n\nNewsBTC\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nIf there is a clear move above $2,400, there could be a drift toward $2,500. The next resistance sits at $2,500, above which Ethereum might rally and test the $2,620 zone.\n\nFresh Decline in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $2,300 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,185 level.\n\nThe first key support could be the $2,075 zone or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $1,860 swing low to the $2,289 high. A downside break and a close below $2,075 might start another steady decline. In the stated case, Ether could test the $2,000 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $1,860 level.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bullish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $2,185\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $2,300"

        "content": "On January 3, a significant development led to an impressive 80% surge in the value of the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) token.\n\nThis sudden increase, which marked an eight-month high, can be attributed to the public recognition and praise given by Ethereum\u2019s co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, highlighting the importance and value of this service.\n\nVitalik Buterin\u2019s Endorsement of ENS\n\nOn Jan. 3, Buterin took to X (formerly Twitter) to express his views on the Ethereum Name Service, deeming it \u201csuper important.\u201d\n\nHe emphasized the necessity for the service to remain accessible and affordable for all Ethereum network users, particularly those on layer-2 (L2) networks.\n\nAll L2s should be working on (trustless, merkle-proof-based) CCIP resolvers, so that we can have ENS subdomains registerable, updateable and readable directly on L2s. ENS is super-important, it needs to be affordable!https://t.co/Ice1lTttFE \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) January 3, 2024\n\nButerin highlighted the need for all L2s to work on CCIP resolvers based on trustless, merkle-proof technology. This move would enable the registration, updating, and reading of ENS subdomains directly on L2 networks.\n\nAccording to Buterin, integrating ENS addresses with layer-2 networks like Optimism (OP), Arbitrum (ARB), and Polygon enhances user-friendliness and is crucial for Ethereum\u2019s long-term scalability plans.\n\nThis integration is expected to streamline operations as ENS domains replace the complex alphanumeric wallet addresses traditionally used in transactions.\n\nENS Token Surges by Over 80%\n\nAfter the influential tweet by Buterin, the ENS token experienced a significant increase from its yearly low of $8.50. According to CoinGecko data, it has surged by 85% to reach its highest value in eight months at $15.8.\n\nThe ENS token is being traded at $14.8 at the time of writing. This reflects a 45.1% price increase in the last 24 hours and a 42.7% rise over the past seven days.\n\nThe Ethereum Name Service is a domain platform on the Ethereum blockchain that allows users to acquire domain names. The decentralized naming system was meant to facilitate users in obtaining user-friendly names such as \u201cbob.eth,\u201d linked with identifiers such as addresses, content hashes, and metadata.\n\nAccording to Dune Analytics, the Ethereum Name Service currently boasts over 2.1 million registered domains and 800,000 unique participants.\n\nShould there be demand-based recurring fees on ENS domains?https://t.co/s22CY0PyYd \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) September 9, 2022\n\nIn September 2022, Buterin proposed a novel taxation approach for ENS domain names. The \u201cHarberger\u201d tax, set at 3%, aimed to discourage the hoarding of domain names by early adopters, promoting a more equitable and decentralized ownership of ENS addresses."

        "content": "In the dynamic arena of cryptocurrencies, Ethereum (ETH) is poised to potentially outshine Bitcoin (BTC) in 2024, while the emerging memecoin, Rebel Satoshi (RBLZ), is quickly gaining market recognition.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Rising Potential\n\nEthereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, is on track to possibly outperform Bitcoin in the coming year. Andr\u00e9 Dragosch, Head of Research at ETC Group, has highlighted Ethereum\u2019s advanced technological capabilities and its dominant position as a smart contract platform as key drivers of this potential trend reversal.\n\nDespite a period of underperformance relative to Bitcoin, Ethereum\u2019s future looks bright. Key to this optimism is the deflationary \u201cburn mechanism\u201d introduced with Ethereum Improvement Proposal EIP-1559. This mechanism has effectively reduced Ethereum\u2019s supply, which, when combined with attractive ETH staking yields, could significantly boost its market performance. Traditional investors, according to Dragosch, can view these developments as akin to equity dividends and buyback yields.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Enduring Appeal\n\nDespite Ethereum\u2019s promising outlook, Bitcoin\u2019s established role and stability cannot be overlooked. As David Schwed, COO at Holborn, points out, Bitcoin\u2019s longstanding position might enable it to maintain its performance edge over Ethereum in the long run. Bitcoin continues to be a top crypto to buy for those seeking stability and a proven track record in the digital currency space.\n\nRebel Satoshi (RBLZ): A New Memecoin on the Rise\n\nAmidst these developments, Rebel Satoshi (RBLZ) is making waves as a new and exciting memecoin. Rebel Satoshi distinguishes itself from typical memecoins by offering both humor and utility, attracting a growing audience in the crypto market.\n\nRebel Satoshi\u2018s unique approach combines the fun and viral nature of memecoins with real-world applications, including an NFT marketplace and staking options. This blend of entertainment and functionality is earning Rebel Satoshi a spot as one of the best memecoins and a top altcoin to buy for forward-thinking investors.\n\nThe Rebel Satoshi Presale: A Unique Investment Opportunity\n\nThe Rebel Satoshi presale has become a focal point for those eager to participate in the memecoin\u2019s growth. Currently in its Citizens Round 3 phase, the presale has successfully sold over 85,441,785 $RBLZ tokens, totaling more than $1,000,000. This impressive milestone is a testament to the growing interest and potential of Rebel Satoshi.\n\nInvesting in the Rebel Satoshi presale is not just about acquiring tokens; it\u2019s about being part of a promising project that combines innovation with a strong community spirit. With its increasing popularity and potential for significant returns, Rebel Satoshi is quickly establishing itself as a top crypto to buy.\n\nConclusion: A Diverse Crypto Landscape\n\nThe cryptocurrency market is entering an exciting phase, with Ethereum\u2019s potential to outperform Bitcoin and the rise of innovative memecoins like Rebel Satoshi. This diverse landscape offers a range of investment opportunities, each with its unique appeal. For those looking to engage with this vibrant space, the Rebel Satoshi presale presents an opportunity to invest in a project set for significant growth in the digital currency world.\n\nFor the latest updates and more information, be sure to visit the official Rebel Satoshi Presale Website or contact Rebel Red via Telegram\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "Crypto Trader Satoshi Flipper Says Ethereum (ETH) Is Set For ATH Comeback \u2013 Everlodge (ELDG) and Fantom (FTM) Fall in Line for Massive Gains\n\nFor the past week, Ethereum has traded below its support level, leaving many ETH holders worried about the stagnant decline. Some even considered selling their Ethereum stock in hope to HODL other altcoins before it gets too late. However, According to Satoshi Flipper, Ethereum is on a path to surmounting its previous all-time highs, and truly, Ethereum has regained a bullish momentum.\n\nOn the other hand, investors also shared their interests with Fantom and Everlodge, two unique tokens that are set to gain massive returns.\n\nNothing Will Hold Ethereum (ETH) Back From Hitting Previous ATHs\u2014 Says Satoshi Flipper\n\n\n\nEthereum price has been trading below its support level of $2,241, along with some fluctuations allowing it to peek above this level a few times. However, the peeking stopped as Ethereum made a big bullish move today December 22, around 4:00 am UTC.\n\nThis bullish sentiment was sustained by Ethereum and its price is finally nearing a new resistance level, with a current range of $2,310 to $2,340. This impressive little comeback above its support level has investors hopeful again as some are rooting for a continued rise.\n\nA major futures trader, Satoshi Flipper, went further to say in his tweet that, nothing can stop Ethereum price from reaching its previous all-time highs. And from the recent sentiment Ethereum is getting a possible mooning is imminent in 2024.\n\nWith Increasing Trading Activity, Fantom (FTM) is Maintaining a Good Momentum\n\n\n\nFantom is on a good streak as of today and as of the past ome month. A lot of investors are optimistic about Fantom as it gained over 68.53% in the past 30 days.\n\nAt the beginning of December, Fantom price was around $0.3118, but it has risen to a significant range of $0.4800 to $0.4847 as at when this article was written. Fantom price even managed to hit a daily peak of $0.5132 at 3:30 am today, December 22.\n\nIt\u2019s safe to say Fantom is successfully riding the positive wave of this altcoin season. Let\u2019s watch and see where this Fantom craze takes FTM token.\n\nEverlodge (ELDG) Has All it Takes to Attract Massive Gains\n\n\n\nAmid Fantom and Ethereum\u2019s positive momentum, Everlodge (ELDG) emerges as a revolutionary crypto investment. Everlodge comes as the first crypto project that has successfully merged AirBnb concept with Web3.\n\nEnvisioned as the pioneer in integrating real-world property development onto the blockchain, Everlodge embarks on its stage 8 presale, offering $ELDG at $0.027 per token.\n\nEverlodge distinguishes itself by democratizing real estate, and transforming properties into NFTs, allowing fractional ownership starting at just $100. Essentially one could invest in a $1million villa by paying for a fraction of it, thereby co-owning it with other investors. This innovative approach opens new investment avenues and passive income potential as property values appreciate.\n\nAs the presale progresses, $ELDG could see a rise to $0.038. Holders of the token enjoy perks such as discounts, participation in giveaways, and timely returns through staking, making it one of the best crypto investment for utility token rewards.\n\nThe token\u2019s utility and other features like liquidity pools and membership right to free nightly stays, bonuses and exciting holiday giveaways solidifies Everlodge\u2019s position as the best crypto investment for real estate enthusiasts.\n\nVisit Everlodge"

        "title": "Why $ETH Could 2x in January 2024, and This Presale Token Is Poised to Hit $5 Million - Finbold - Finance in Bold",
        "content": "Press Releases are sponsored content and not a part of Finbold's editorial content. For a full disclaimer, please click here. If you encounter any issues, kindly report them to [email protected]. Crypto assets/products can be highly risky. Never invest unless you\u2019re prepared to lose all the money you invest.\n\n2024 started on a very positive note for crypto investors. Bitcoin surpassed the $45K support level, and Ethereum is trading at around $2.4K. The reveal of a new roadmap mainly drives the positive development around Ethereum, with many anticipating its 2x growth in January.\n\nSimilarly, the new ICO crypto Galaxy Fox ($GFOX) has shown a powerful performance. During the presale, it quickly reached its first milestone \u2013 $500k raised \u2013 and hit its first million just ten days later. Soon after, $GFOX hit its second million. This accelerating growth will likely see Galaxy Fox reaching the $5 million mark before the end of January.\n\nSo, are $ETH and $GFOX the best altcoins to buy in 2024? Let\u2019s find out.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Upward Trajectory\n\nWith gains of 6.5% this week and 13.6% for the month, Ethereum is now trading at over $2,400. Given this increasing tendency, Ethereum may potentially reach $5,000 or more in the near future. Optimism among investors started to grow after December\u2019s spike and BlackRock\u2019s entry into the Ethereum ETF market, and it intensified by the latest roadmap updates introduced by Vitalik Buterin.\n\nSingle Slot Finality (SSF) is one of the major roadmap changes the co-founder of Ethereum has implemented to make the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) system more efficient. This is anticipated to result in more secure transactions being completed more quickly.\n\nThe focus on scalability, through Surge and rollup enhancements, highlights Ethereum\u2019s dedication to continuous improvement and lets it remain the spot among the best altcoins to buy in 2024.\n\nThe Rise of Galaxy Fox\n\nA huge $2.2 million has been raised for Galaxy Fox so far in the presale. The main reason for this fantastic success is big investments from influential figures. So, the project, seen as undervalued right now, is catching the eye of smart investors.\n\nAdapting to demand, the pricing scheme for the Galaxy Fox presale phases sees prices rise with each new phase. This approach has led to a notable 165% jump in price from the first to the current sixth stage.\n\nIn addition to being an investment, Galaxy Fox provides a staking platform where users may lock up their tokens to receive incentives. The Stargate feature, which takes a small cut from each $GFOX transaction, builds up a significant reward pool.\n\nGalaxy Fox will also expand into physical products, offering investors one-of-a-kind clothes and collectibles, moving beyond the usual digital focus of crypto companies. This merchandise is believed to increase community engagement, loyalty, and trust. Additionally, $GFOX will create a unique 3,000-piece NFT collection based on the Galaxy Fox world. This will provide buyers with another way to get a passive income.\n\nAnother important part of Galaxy Fox\u2019s approach is the token burn policy. Consistent reductions in the token supply help keep the token value stable in bearish trends and increase in bullish trends.\n\nOf the 5 billion $GFOX tokens that were available, 2 billion were sold during the presale in a matter of 2 months.

        "content": "Starknet\u2019s upgrade aims to substantially reduce transaction fees and lays the groundwork for users to pay for their gas consumption with the zero-knowledge rollup\u2019s native token STRK.\n\nStarknetDAO's mostly symbolic vote is expected to approve the deployment of its protocol upgrade.\n\nThe decentralized autonomous organization for Starknet, a layer-2 blockchain built on Ethereum, started voting Thursday on whether to approve its latest protocol upgrade for mainnet deployment.\n\nThe vote ends on Jan. 8 at 12 p.m. UTC and at press time, all votes cast have been in favor of deploying Starknet Alpha v0.13.0.\n\nThe upgrade has two key elements: substantially reducing transaction fees and laying the groundwork for users to use Starknet\u2019s native token STRK as payments for their gas consumption, according to a community forum post.\n\nThe deployment would be an exciting new step for the layer-2 blockchain, Carlos Mercado, a data scientist at blockchain analytics firm Flipside Crypto, said to Unchained over Telegram, but noted that the vote \u201cis mostly symbolic.\u201d The upgrade \u201cis a closed vote, as the STRK token launched in 2022 and only has around 430 holders (per Etherscan), many of which are delegating to key ecosystem players.\u201d\n\nThe vote comes less than a month after Starknet deployed the upgrade on the Goerli and Sepolia testnets. The total value locked in Starknet\u2019s smart contracts currently stands at $141 million, according to data from layer-2 watchdog, L2Beat.\n\nStarknet is a rollup designed to scale the Ethereum blockchain without compromising on security and composability. It uses zero-knowledge proofs, which are \u201ccryptographic proofs that verify data without revealing any information about the data itself,\u201d wrote head of research Christine Kim in a Galaxy report.\n\n\u201cThe crypto space is at the frontier of very powerful technologies like zero-knowledge proofs,\u201d wrote Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin in a Dec. 28 blog post. \u201cZero-knowledge proofs, a technology we thought was decades away, are now here, are increasingly developer-friendly, and are on the cusp of being usable for consumer applications.\u201d"

If you encounter any issues, kindly report them to [email protected]. Crypto assets/products can be highly risky. Never invest unless you\u2019re prepared to lose all the money you invest.\n\nThe crypto landscape witnessed a substantial uptick in 2023, with notable price surges in Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and the advent of innovative newcomers like the Boost-to-Earn token, ApeMax.\n\nAs we step into 2024, the crypto market is gearing up for what could be a transformative year. The impending Bitcoin halving event in 2024 is a significant catalyst, historically associated with surges in crypto coin prices.\n\nAfter surfing the web to gather information from reputable Web3 sources and official coin websites, we will outline the top coins to consider for the upcoming crypto bull run.\n\nList of Top Coins to Buy for the Bull Run\n\nApeMax (APEMAX)\n\nApeMax has emerged as a frontrunner among new meme coins, carving out its space in the crypto space with distinctive features. The coin introduces an innovative \u201cBoost\u201d staking protocol, enabling token holders to \u201cboost\u201d their preferred entities and potentially earn rewards.\n\nApeMax\u2019s standout feature also includes instant token access for eligible presale buyers, making room for immediate staking. With an ongoing presale, ApeMax continues its popularity in the market as anticipation grows for a potential bull run.\n\nSolana (SOL)\n\nSolana, a third-generation blockchain platform, employs PoS and PoH mechanisms to deliver smart contract functionality. Positioned as a potential \u201cEthereum rival,\u201d SOL stands out for its high speeds, low costs, and overall efficiency.\n\nEthereum (ETH)\n\nMaintaining its prominence as the second-largest coin based on market capitalization, Ethereum continues to lead the smart contract revolution. The platform\u2019s robust infrastructure empowers decentralized applications (DApps) and smart contracts, with the rise of NFTs and Web3 gaming sustaining Ethereum\u2019s relevance.\n\nSei (SEI)\n\nSEI, a Layer 1 blockchain tailored for digital asset exchange, introduces its native utility token with various functions, covering transaction fees, DPoS validator staking, governance participation, and collateral for applications on the Sei blockchain.\n\nCelestia (TIA)\n\nLaunched in 2023, Celestia prides itself on being the world\u2019s first modular blockchain network with a focus on scalability. Celestia is a layer-1 blockchain, emphasizing transaction arrangement and ensuring transaction data accessibility without engaging in smart contracts or computational processes.\n\nBonk (BONK)\n\nThough not a newcomer, Bonk gained traction on the Solana blockchain for its association with Solana meme culture. Bonk operates on the cost-efficient Solana blockchain with a market cap of $898 million.\n\nCoq Inu (COQ)\n\nOperating on the Avalanche C-Chain, Coq Inu boasts a total supply exceeding 69 trillion tokens. Established by the community in 2023, COQ stands as the 9th largest meme token by market capitalization, with a market cap of $139 million.\n\nInjective (INJ)\n\nInjective focuses on making DeFi and Web3 accessible. With user-friendly architecture, it allows easy creation of DeFi and Web3 apps, ensuring lightning-fast transactions and instant finality through its PoS consensus.\n\nIs a Crypto Bull Run Coming?\n\nRecent market movements in 2023, such as Bitcoin surging to $44,000, suggest the potential for a bull run. However, as bull runs are typically identified after they occur, crypto enthusiasts are closely monitoring the market for signs of a sustained optimistic trend in the coming weeks and months.\n\nWill ApeMax Surge in 2024?\n\nThe ApeMax presale continues into 2024, steadily gaining momentum. ApeMax\u2019s distinct features and playful identity have garnered attention as the market anticipates a potential bull run. Given the inherent volatility of the crypto space, predicting future token surges remains uncertain.\n\nCan ApeMax Achieve the $1 Milestone?\n\nApeMax\u2019s value trajectory remains speculative, influenced by factors like market demand and circulating supply. Despite uncertainties, the ongoing presale momentum and innovative tokenomics position ApeMax as a unique player in the crypto market.\n\nClosing Thoughts\n\n2024 holds the promise of being a dynamic year for the crypto market, fueled by bullish sentiment. Ethereum, Solana, ApeMax, and other innovative coins showcase the industry\u2019s continuous creativity.\n\nHowever, thorough and independent research remains crucial, and crypto enthusiasts must also consider the associated risks and volatility of the crypto space. This article does not offer financial advice.\n\nFor readers interested in ApeMax, there are geographical purchase restrictions, particularly in the US, Canada, and other restricted regions. Please refer to the official ApeMax website for up-to-date information."

        "title": "Vitalik Buterin Wants Ethereum to go Back to Cybherpunk, Ethereum Classic Records 24% Spike, Pullix Stage 5 Begins - CryptoDaily",
        "content": "Table of Contents\n\nEthereum (ETH) continues to solidify its position as a leading decentralized ecosystem, while Ethereum Classic (ETC) shows potential for a good return on investment. In another development, Pullix (PLX) has reached stage 5 of its presale in rapid time, raising over $2.5 million. Given its distinctive qualities and growing investor enthusiasm, experts foresee Pullix as a prospective 10X token with bright prospects ahead.\n\nPullix Exchange Climbs to Stage 5 of Presale Looking to 10X in Coming Months\n\nThanks to its hybrid infrastructure that seeks to bridge the gap between decentralized and centralized exchanges, Pullix exchange anticipates a user base of 990 million crypto enthusiasts by 2028, making it a significant player in the market.\n\nThe platform allows users to trade cryptocurrencies and global assets in a unified space, bridging the gap between digital and traditional trade. This includes the exchange of goods, stocks, digital assets, enhancing liquidity. Users also have access to decentralized services, empowering them to approve or disapprove assets and development proposals.\n\nAdditionally, Pullix facilitates using cryptocurrencies as security for trading in over-the-counter(OTC) derivatives, simplifying the sign-up process by eliminating the need for KYC verification.\n\nThe native token, PLX, has the potential to become one of the best DeFi coins in the market, offering access to \"Trade-to-Earn.\" Users can buy, sell, and swap various assets while earning passive income through token staking.\n\nPullix Exchange caters to a diverse range of investors, and currently, the token is available at just $0.07 in stage 5 of its presale. Experts suggest a potential tenfold increase in value within a few months, presenting an opportunity for significant returns. Pullix could be one of the best coins to invest in 2024.\n\nVitalik Buterin Wants Ethereum to go Back to Cypherpunk\n\nIn a shift from its financial focus in 2017, Ethereum's (ETH) co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, plans to return the platform to its original 'Cypherpunk' vision. On December 28, 2023, Buterin expressed the intention to steer Ethereum back to being a 'public decentralized shared hard drive,' emphasizing the roots of the Cypherpunk revolution.\n\nEthereum's initial goal was to create a platform for decentralized file storage and peer-to-peer messaging. However, in 2017, the focus shifted towards financial applications. The move back to the Cypherpunk model is expected to enhance Ethereum's privacy and security, strengthening the network.\n\nCypherpunk principles emphasize freedom of expression, allowing Ethereum users to communicate and transact freely without external interference. Despite Ethereum's price dip to $2.2k there might be some optimism that it could rebound in the new year's bull run. Currently, Ethereum still ranks as one of the best coins to invest in if you are seeking utility-driven tokens.\n\nEthereum Classic Drags Behind and Records 24% Spike in 30 Days\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC) holds significant value by facilitating transactions and securing block space on the Ethereum Classic platform. Unlike staking, Ethereum Classic operates as a PoWasset, meaning investors don't receive rewards for securing the network. However, they can earn rewards through the Savings feature on centralized crypto exchanges, allowing variable interest over specific time frames.\n\nDespite the overall bullish trend in the crypto market, Ethereum Classic price has shown modest performance since October but in the past 30 days Ethereum Classic price has climbed up 24% which might be low in comparison to other altcoins in the market right now.\n\nConclusion\n\nUltimately, Pullix shines as a promising investment with user-friendly features and a no KYC approach. Its potential for substantial growth becomes evident when compared to Ethereum's prices which might lose ground to Solana, and Ethereum Classic's slower performance further highlights Pullix as the better crypto to buy.\n\nFor more information on Pullix\u2019s presale, see the links below:\n\nVisit Pullix\n\nJoin The Pullix Communities\n\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored press release and is for informational purposes only.
