        "content": "U.S. asset managers Grayscale, VanEck, Bitwise, Volatility Shares, ProShares and Round Hill Capital have submitted new applications to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch exchange traded funds (ETFs) that track Ether (ETH) futures contracts.\n\nKey Takeaways Six asset managers have sent applications to the SEC for the creation of ETH futures ETFs.\n\nAll of the proposed ETFs will allow holders of the assets to go long ETH with the exception of the ProShares offering, which is intended to enable investors to short the crypto asset.\n\nIf approved, the various ETH ETF offerings could go live as soon as October.\n\nVolatility Shares was the first one to kick off the most recent round of ETH ETF applications, as their proposal was filed on Friday. By Tuesday, five others had joined the fray. If approved, the funds would not hold any ETH directly. Instead, they would follow the price movements of the futures contracts on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME).\n\n\n\nNotably, Grayscale has applied for two ETFs in their filing: one for Bitcoin-related assets and one for Ether futures contracts. The first bitcoin futures ETFs launched in October 2021. In June 2023, Volatility Shares enabled the first leveraged bitcoin ETF through its 2x Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITX).\n\n\n\nProShares has taken a different approach and filed for a short ETH strategy ETF that would profit from the losses of the S&P CME Ether Futures index. The fund would invest in daily contracts that inverse the performance of the index. This means the fund would gain as much as the index loses on a given day and vice versa. In other words, the ETF would effectively act as a mechanism to short the price of ETH.\n\n\n\nThe SEC has not yet approved any ETH ETFs in the U.S. If approved, these ETH ETFs could launch as early as October.\n\nIt should be noted that this new round of ETH ETF applications differs from the recent bitcoin ETF proposals from Blackrock and others in that those potential bitcoin ETFs are backed by spot bitcoin rather than futures contracts."

        "content": "As the recent fever surrounding Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) somewhat subdued, with the issuers and investors still eagerly awaiting the regulatory approval for this investment vehicle in the U.S., Ethereum futures ETFs have suddenly taken center stage.\n\nAt least five applications from different firms were filed within 24 hours on August 1, and another was one submitted last week.\n\nAn ETF tracking Ethereum futures would essentially invest in futures contracts of the industry\u2019s second largest cryptocurrency that are traded on the CFTC-regulated Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) rather than directly holding the underlying asset.\n\nHow these efforts pan out and whether the SEC greenlights any of the current filings remains an open question, especially in the light of the regulator\u2019s recent clampdown on the crypto industry and the barely disguised attempts to classify almost every cryptocurrency\u2014except for Bitcoin\u2014as a security.\n\nVolatility Shares: Ether Strategy ETF\n\nFiled: 07/27/2023\n\nSEC Response: 10/11/2023\n\nListing Exchange: CBOE BZX Exchange\n\nVolatility Shares, which manages $173.5 million across four exchange-traded funds, could become the first issuer of the ETF with the focus on Ether after outlining its plans in a July 28 filing with the SEC.\n\nThe company\u2019s proposed Ether Strategy ETF (ETHU) complies with the provisions of the 1940 Act governing investment policies and capital structure and would invest up to 25% of its assets in cash-settled Ether futures contracts traded on the CFTC-regulated Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME).\n\nAdditionally, the fund may invest in reverse purchase agreements and shares of other investment companies, but not directly in Ethereum, per the filing.\n\nThe fund intends to list and principally trade its shares on CBOE BZX Exchange.\n\nThe proposed ETHU application follows the introduction of the Volatility Shares 2x Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITX)\u2014the first leveraged Bitcoin futures ETF\u2014launched by the Mt. Kisco, NY-based firm in June.\n\nStory continues\n\nBitwise: Ethereum Strategy ETF\n\nFiled: 08/01/2023\n\nSEC Response: 10/16/2023\n\nListing Exchange: NYSE Arca\n\nAfter withdrawing its initial filing in May, Bitwise re-applied for its Ethereum Strategy ETF (ETHG) on August 1. According to the filing, ETHG intends to invest in cash-settled, front-month, i.e. with the shortest time to maturity, ETH futures contracts, without seeking direct exposure to the current spot price of Ethereum.\n\nThe fund is classified as \u201cnon-diversified\u201d under the Investment Company Act of 1940, meaning it is able to invest a relatively high percentage of its assets in financial instruments with a single counterparty or a few counterparties.\n\nThe filing details that the fund will not invest in ETH futures contracts directly; instead, the investments will be channeled through a wholly-owned subsidiary operating under the laws of the Cayman Islands.\n\nFurthermore, since the Bitwise Ethereum Strategy ETF intends to qualify for treatment as a regulated investment company, the size of the fund\u2019s investment in that subsidiary will not exceed 25% of its total assets at each quarter end of the fiscal year.\n\nDespite such a low allocation, the fund seeks to achieve its investment objective primarily through its investment in ETH Futures Contracts, whereas the remaining 75% of assets are expected to be invested in U.S. Treasuries and other U.S. government obligations, as well as money market funds, cash and cashlike equivalents such as high quality commercial paper.\n\nRoundhill: Roundhill Ether Strategy ETF\n\nFiled: 08/01/2023\n\nSEC Response: 10/16/2023\n\nListing Exchange: Not specified\n\nNew York-based Roundhill Investments is a SEC-registered investment adviser focused on offering innovative financial products designed to offer exposure to investment themes that appeal to the next generation of investors.\n\nThe firm currently has a total of $662 million of assets under management across eight ETF and is seeking to expand the offering with the launch of the Roundhill Ether Strategy ETF.\n\nAccording to the August 1 filing, the Roundhill Ether Strategy ETF is an actively managed fund that seeks capital appreciation by investing in CME-listed front-month Ether futures contracts.\n\nSimilar to Bitwise, the fund plans to invest up to 25% of its assets in a wholly owned subsidiary organized under the laws of the Cayman Islands.\n\nVanEck: VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF\n\nFiled: 08/01/2023\n\nSEC Response: 10/16/2023\n\nListing Exchange: Not specified\n\nVanEck, which is also among the spot Bitcoin ETF hopefuls, appears to be going big on Ethereum: according to the August 1 filing, the total value of the ETH to which the VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF is planning to have economic exposure is approximately 100% of its total assets.\n\nIf for any reason such as exceeded position limits or liquidity constraints, the fund is unable to achieve the target exposure, it may invest in equity securities of ETH-related companies, i.e. companies listed on a U.S. stock exchange that the fund\u2019s adviser believes provide returns that generally correspond, or are closely related, to the performance of ETH or ETH futures.\n\n\u201cFor example, the Fund may invest in U.S. listed companies offering digital asset trading platforms,\u201d reads the filing\n\nIn addition to ETH futures, the VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF expects to have \u201csignificant holdings\u201d of cash and fixed income investments, which are intended to provide liquidity and serve as collateral for the fund\u2019s ETH futures, as well as to engage in \u201cactive and frequent trading of portfolio holdings.\u201d\n\nProshares: Short Ether Strategy ETF and ProShares Ether Strategy ETF\n\nFiled: 08/01/2023\n\nSEC Response: 10/16/2023\n\nListing Exchange: Not specified\n\nOn August 1, ETF-issuer ProShares filed for two different Ethereum-focused ETFs: Short Ether Strategy ETF and ProShares Ether Strategy ETF.\n\nThe former seeks daily investment results that correspond to the inverse (-1x) of the daily performance of the S&P CME Ether Futures Index, whereas the latter seeks to provide capital appreciation primarily through managed exposure to CME-listed Ether futures contracts, with the investment objective being \u201cnon-fundamental,\u201d meaning it may be altered by the Board of Trustees without the approval of the fund\u2019s shareholders.\n\nSimilar to the Bitwise Ethereum Strategy ETF, both Proshares\u2019 Ethereum futures ETF seek to to qualify as regulated investment companies, meaning that the size of the fund\u2019s investment in their corresponding subsidiaries, which will also be based in the Cayman Islands, will not exceed 25% of the total assets at each quarter end of the fiscal year.\n\nGrayscale Investments: Grayscale Ethereum Futures ETF\n\nFiled: 08/01/2023\n\nSEC Response: 10/16/2023\n\nListing Exchange: Not specified\n\nOn May 9, Grayscale Investments, best known as as the sponsor of the troubled Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), announced the formation of Grayscale Funds Trust\u2014a Delaware statutory trust structure that encompasses three new funds: Grayscale Ethereum Futures ETF, Grayscale Global Bitcoin Composite ETF, and Grayscale Privacy ETF.\n\nJust a week later, the firm submitted amendments to its SEC filing to remove mentions of the Ethereum Futures ETF though, only to re-apply for the offering on August 1.\n\nThe updated filing states that the Ethereum Futures ETF is an actively-managed fund that seeks to achieve its investment objective primarily through exposure to Ethereum futures contracts, purchased via a Cayman Islands-based subsidiary.\n\nThe fund is also planning to hold approximately 100% of its net assets in Ethere futures contracts, however, it may also have significant holdings of cash and cash equivalent investments, such as U.S. Treasury Bills or repurchase agreements."

Six Ethereum ETFs might be approved by October\n\nBitwise, Roundhill, VanEck, ProShares and Grayscale submitted their Ethereum Futures ETF filings with the SEC yesterday, Aug. 1, 2023. Volatility Shares filed with the regulator on July 28. Thus, six packages of Ether Futures ETF documents are being processed by the watchdog.\n\nHere's fresh update of the Ether Futures ETF Race, which now has SIX in the running.. nice job by @JSeyff for putting together so quickly pic.twitter.com/G1rwwfaFoS \u2014 Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) August 1, 2023\n\nProShares even filed with SEC for two products: ProShares Short Ether Strategy ETF and ProShares Ether Strategy ETF.\n\n\n\nThese statistics were shared by Bloomberg's Eric Balchunas in his Twitter account. All requests are labeled with \"Awaiting Approval\" status. The deadline for the SEC to declare its verdicts is in mid-October 2023.\n\nThe commentators below the announcement are also waiting for $9 trillion asset management giant Blackrock to join the club of six Ethereum Futures ETF pioneers in the U.S.\n\nAs covered by U.Today previously, the world's first exchange traded fund backed by \"physical\" Ethereum (ETH) was launched in Canada in April 2021.\n\nLocal asset manager Purpose Investments with $15 billion in AUM released this ETF on Toronto Stock Exchange.\n\nExperts are optimistic about ETFs outside Bitcoin (BTC)\n\nFutures and spot ETFs on cryptocurrencies are considered as game-changers for the investment world. They will eliminate the necessity for companies to store Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) physically in digital custody.\n\nAs such, wealth managers will be able to invest in crypto just like they do with \"regular\" exchange-traded products. This, in turn, might trigger the injection of capital into the sphere and can be a possible catalyst for a cryptocurrency bull run.\n\nAs covered by U.Today, seasoned crypto VC Vance Spencer stressed that the launch of a spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETF would result in many other crypto-based products being greenlighted.\n\nThese major announcements might land as soon as this year, he opines."

        "content": "The crypto industry collectively celebrated when the world\u2019s largest asset manager, BlackRock, applied for a spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETF (exchange-traded fund). The move led to a rally for BTC with other major assets following suit soon after. However, there are also several Ethereum (ETH) futures ETFs currently awaiting approval. The race for ETH ETFs is equally contested by major financial players.\n\nAlso Read: BlackRock Bitcoin ETF Has 50% Chance For SEC Approval?\n\nCurrently, six ETH futures ETF filings await approval. These include Ether Strategy ETF, Bitwise Ethereum Strategy ETF, Roundhill Ether Strategy ETF, VanEck\u2019s Ethereum Strategy ETF, Proshares Short Ether Strategy ETF, and the Grayscale Ethereum Futures ETF. It should be noted that BlackRock has not applied for an ETH ETF as of yet.\n\nWhy are firms interested in an Ethereum futures ETF?\n\nSource: Redot.com\n\nFutures ETFs provide exposure to futures contracts for ETH, unlike spot ETFs. The SEC\u2019s concerns about investor protection and market manipulation have so far prevented the approval of a spot ETF. The Ethereum network houses a lot of projects. Many of these projects deal with metaverse initiatives and web3 developments. As such, the ETH ecosystem has a lot of potential for future growth. Therefore, financial institutions may have a lot to gain, without actually holding the asset.\n\nRoundhill, which was founded in 2018, follows an innovative strategy for its investments. The firm focuses on thematic funds like Metaverse and generative AI ETFs.\n\nVolatility Shares, founded in 2019, manages about $173.6 million in funds. The firm offers four ETFs, including the 2x Bitcoin Strategy ETF and others tied to long and short VIX futures indices.\n\nAlso Read: HSBC Enables Bitcoin, Ethereum ETF Trading in Hong Kong\n\nEarlier, Grayscale and Bitwise withdrew their filings due to SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) concerns, but they have since re-entered the race. Grayscale had filed an amendment to remove the mention of any Ether futures ETF. Moreover, the SEC also asked the firm to reverse the Filecoin Trust application, considering its security. On the other hand, Bitwise had completely removed its ETH ETF application, however, it re-applied recently.\n\nThere is no confirmation on when these applications will be approved, if at all. However, considering that these are futures ETFs and not spot ETFs, the SEC should ideally not contest the applications."

        "title": "Ethereum Denied Non-Security Status In Latest Court Battle Against SEC - NewsBTC",
        "content": "In a recent court ruling, Ethereum (ETH) was denied non-security status in a case against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nThe court granted the SEC\u2019s motion to dismiss the complaint for declaratory relief on whether Ethereum and the Ethereum Network are securities. While the ruling was a procedural one and not on the merits, it confirmed that there is no protection for Ethereum as a non-security.\n\nEthereum And Other Cryptocurrencies Left In Legal Limbo\n\nAt this point in the US, only Bitcoin (BTC) and XRP are large-cap tokens that have legal clarity. The court\u2019s decision highlights the regulatory uncertainty surrounding cryptocurrencies and the need for the SEC to issue definitive guidance rather than approaching the issue in piecemeal litigation.\n\nAccording to the Law Firm Dedicated to unique issues of digital assets and cryptocurrency, Hodl Law, the court emphasized that the SEC has not investigated the plaintiff or threatened to investigate, and there is no imminent threat based on its unclear Ethereum position and enforcement-by-litigation approach.\n\nHowever, the SEC\u2019s recent refusals to comment on Ethereum, combined with the position it was forced to take in this briefing, clearly demonstrate that it views Ethereum as a security and is waiting for the most opportune time to strike.\n\nWhile there are appellate options and constitutional grounds available, the ruling underscores the need for greater regulatory clarity in the cryptocurrency space. Businesses and individuals operating in the crypto industry need expert legal counsel to navigate the complex legal landscape and ensure compliance with applicable regulations.\n\nETH\u2019s Fate As A Security\n\nIf the SEC were to classify Ethereum as a security, it could have significant consequences for the cryptocurrency and the broader industry.\n\nFirst and foremost, if Ethereum were classified as a security, it would be subject to the same regulations as traditional securities, such as stocks and bonds. This would mean that Ethereum would have to comply with securities laws and regulations, including registration requirements, disclosure requirements, and other compliance obligations.\n\nThis would likely increase the cost and complexity of operating the ETH network and could potentially stifle innovation.\n\nAdditionally, it could impact the value and liquidity of the cryptocurrency. The SEC\u2019s classification would create uncertainty and potentially undermine investor confidence in Ethereum, leading to a decline in its value and potentially reducing demand for the cryptocurrency.\n\nFurthermore, this case could potentially lead to legal action against the platform and its developers. If the SEC were to determine that Ethereum was sold in violation of securities laws, it could result in penalties and fines for the platform\u2019s founders and developers.\n\nAs the crypto industry continues to evolve, regulators must provide clear guidance on the status and treatment of cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe ongoing confusion and uncertainty surrounding the legal status of Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies pose significant challenges for businesses and investors in the space. While the court\u2019s ruling, in this case, maybe disappointing for some, it underscores the need for greater clarity and regulatory certainty in the cryptocurrency industry.\n\nAs of the time of writing, ETH is in the process of recovering from a significant decline experienced over the past few days. Currently, the second-largest token in the nascent industry is trading at $1,850, which represents a 0.7% decrease in the last 24 hours.\n\nFeatured image from iStock, chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Buy and sell Bitcoin the easy way Start your crypto portfolio today! Get started\n\nBitcoin (BTC) is the biggest cryptocurrency in the world. Ethereum (ETH) is another major blockchain, so investors think it is one of the most lucrative investments in the current cryptocurrency market. However, investors believe VC Spectra (SPCT) can become a strong challenger to Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) and Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) dominance. VC Spectra (SPCT) already raised $2.4 million in its private sale, showing strong signs of what will come.\n\n>>BUY SPCT TOKENS NOW<<\n\nBitcoin (BTC) Has Been On A Roller Coaster\n\nTesla billionaire Elon Musk has rebranded Twitter to X. Musk favored Dogecoin over Bitcoin (BTC) as the official cryptocurrency for transactions on the social media platform. That decision hurt Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) market sentiment, resulting in investors leaving Bitcoin for Dogecoin .\n\nOn that note, a lot of uncertainty is affecting the Bitcoin (BTC) market, pushing traders to look for alternative investment options that guarantee huge profits like VC Spectra (SPCT).\n\nThe current challenge to surge above the $31,100 level shows that the Bitcoin (BTC) market is facing a critical moment. If the risk sentiment in the market turns negative, Bitcoin (BTC) might see a severe selloff.\n\nCurrently, Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at $29,300, up 0.34% in the past 24 hours. Over the past week, Bitcoin (BTC) lost 2.5% of its value, and over 3.6% on the monthly chart. Analysts expect Bitcoin (BTC) to rise to $40,000 by the end of 2023 as the halving event approaches.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s (BTC) recent price trajectory resembled a rollercoaster ride, soaring to $31,500 in mid-July before dropping to $29,000. Despite the recent drop in Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) price, experts say it is a normal market adjustment. They view Bitcoin (BTC) as potentially primed for a potential price breakout since it is currently in a consolidation phase.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Investors Shifting To VC Spectra\n\nIn June, an Ethereum (ETH) whale withdrew 50,100 ETH, translating to $91.2 million, from their Binance wallet. Interestingly, the same investor withdrew another 8,500 Ethereum (ETH) on June 8 while staking another 34,560 Ethereum (ETH). All the huge Ethereum (ETH) withdrawals resulted in a major dip in the market between June 28 and July 2.\n\nDespite all these withdrawals, Ethereum (ETH) has shown signs of stability, limiting losses. While the crypto whales have always favored Ethereum (ETH), a massive surge in profits is expected from VC Spectra (SPCT). In that context, Ethereum whales are already shifting to the upcoming project. The exit by these whales is affecting the price of Ethereum (ETH) negatively.\n\nEthereum (ETH) is currently trading at $1,860.05 down 2.12% in the last week. Analysts expect it to stabilize to end the year around $1,905.55.\n\nVC Spectra (SPCT) Attracts Crypto Whales with Its Huge Profits\n\nThe VC Spectra (SPCT) blockchain offers holders robust risk management strategies and a group of experienced capitalists dedicated to reducing investment risks. VC Spectra (SPCT) is committed to utilizing the power of AI to create viable income opportunities.\n\nVC Spectra (SPCT) employs a decentralized authority network, integrating active participation from its investors in important functions within the platform. This active participation by VC Spectra (SPCT) investors is fundamental to this platform\u2019s operational structure.\n\nFurthermore, VC Spectra (SPCT) gives SPCT token holders exclusive voting rights, enabling them to shape their participation in the project. Interestingly, VC Spectra (SPCT) guarantees a streamlined experience for trading on its platform by removing intermediaries, making the process straightforward.\n\nOn that note, VC Spectra (SPCT) lets investors participate in the decision-making process about investment strategies. They also help in assessing the credibility of ICOs on the blockchain, which increases asset retention and offers many investment opportunities.\n\nCurrently, VC Spectra\u2019s (SPCT) Stage 2 public presale is ongoing for $0.011, a 37.5% rise from its Stage 1 price of $0.008. Those who purchase VC Spectra (SPCT) tokens in Stage 2 will get a 627% profit once SPCT reaches $0.08 at the end of the presale.\n\nLearn more about VC Spectra (SPCT) and its presale:\n\nBuy Presale: https://invest.vcspectra.io/login\n\nWebsite: https://vcspectra.io\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/VCSpectra\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/spectravcfund\n\nDisclaimer: The views and opinions expressed by the author should not be considered as financial advice.

        "content": "Fixed-term lending protocol Term Finance is slated to launch on the Ethereum mainnet today.\n\nThe protocol enables non-custodial, fixed-rate lending with collateral using the tri-party repurchase, or repo, model commonly used in traditional banking.\n\nTri-party repo is a repurchase transaction involving three parties. In TradFi, security dealers will find short-term repos to manage both their own assets and their client\u2019s assets. In the case of Term Finance, the security dealer will be replaced by smart contracts.\n\nBilly Welch, the co-founder of Term Labs, the team behind Term Finance, told Blockworks its ability to scale fixed-term lending sets it apart from other fixed-term lending protocols.\n\nMany existing fixed-term lending protocols today utilize automated market makers and liquidity pools to originate fixed-term loans.\n\n\u201cFrom a borrower\u2019s perspective, when you\u2019re trying to borrow (for example) $500,000, $1 million, $2 million, there is significant slippage,\u201d Welch said. \u201cIt\u2019s not scalable for an institutional level user, then from [a liquidity provider] or lender\u2019s perspective, you only make returns as borrowers interact against that pool. So your real returns are half a percent per year.\u201d\n\nTerm Finance, on the other hand, uses a double-sided blind auction process where the protocol matches borrowers and lenders depending on how much they are willing to bid, Welch said.\n\n\u201cWe conduct these auctions where borrowers and lenders can submit their bids and offers to borrow and lend over a period of time, and once the auction closes, we take the bids and offers and create a supply-demand curve,\u201d Welch said. \u201cAny borrower that\u2019s willing to bid at or above the clearing rate gets a loan, and any lender willing to receive the clearing rate or less makes a loan.\u201d\n\nWith this model, liquidity providers will not have to trap their liquidity in an automated market maker for an indefinite amount of time.\n\n\u201cAll you have to do is lock it up for the period of when you submit your bid, if you get done in an auction you get a loan, and if you don\u2019t you can take your tokens back and send it to another DeFi lending protocol and get variable rate lending in that capacity,\u201d Welch said.\n\nThe first public auction on Ethereum mainnet will be a one-month loan maturing Aug. 31 on wstETH collateral borrowing USDC. The auction will begin at 11 am ET today, and interested participants will have 48 hours before Thursday at 11 am ET to place their bids.\n\n\u201cThe long-term vision is we have a repo token maturing every week, every month, going out to one year. This can serve as a basis for a DeFi native benchmark yield curve,\u201d Welch said.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "The crypto market started the early hours of August in red, following the significant downtrend in July. Amid this sell-off, the ETH sellers tried to take advantage by breaking below the support trendline of the megaphone pattern. However, by the day\u2019s end, the buyers stepped in and pushed the price higher evidenced by the daily candle printed on August 1st. Will this fake breakdown bolster buyers for a bullish recovery?\n\nAlso Read: After Bitcoin, Financial Giants Rush to Apply for Ethereum Futures ETFs\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum Price Daily Chart\n\nThe megaphone pattern is characterized by two diverging trend lines that produce progressive higher swing and violate market sentiment.\n\nBy the press time, the Ethereum price trades at $1845, with an intraday of 1.02%.\n\nThe intraday trading volume in Ether is $6.93 Billion, indicating a 17% gain.\n\nSource- Tradingview\n\nFor the past two weeks, the Ethereum price has wavered sideways above the support trendline of the megaphone pattern. Amid the pattern formation, the coin price action resonates between two diverging trendlines until it gives a significant breakout from either one.\n\nThus, a retest to the support trendline was expected to provide strong support, but the observed long consolidation indicates the bulls need to build enough momentum. Having said that, the long-tail rejection candle in August indicates the buyers still defending the bottom support, preserving the potential of a bullish reversal.\n\nIf the buying pressure rises, an upside breakout from the immediate resistance will offer buyers a higher footing to kickstart a new recovery within the megaphone pattern. The potential upswing could lead to a rally to $2140.\n\nIs Ethereum Poised for Extended Correction?\n\nIn case the overhead supply pressure persists, the ETH sellers may give another attempt to break down the lower trendline. For better confirmation, the potential short-sellers must wait for a daily candle closing below the trendline. The possible breakdown will prolong the correction fall to $1800.\n\nMoving average convergence divergence: A narrow spread between the MACD (blue) and signal(orange) slope near the midline indicates a neutral sentiment in the market.\n\nSuper Trend: the green film projected in the daily chart reflects the short-term trend that remains bullish."

        "content": "Six major asset managers, including Grayscale and VanEck, have filed fresh applications in a bid to launch Ether (ETH) futures exchange-traded funds (ETF) to United States customers.\n\nSeparate filings submitted to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission reviewed by Cointelegraph outline respective applications from the likes of Grayscale, VanEck, Bitwise, Volatility Shares, ProShares and Round Hill Capital.\n\nWe officially have 5 different #Ethereum futures ETF filings submitted to the SEC.

ProShares went straight for the inverse/short ETF. https://t.co/Qi8he0OwrU pic.twitter.com/qVVUwrUjOI \u2014 James Seyffart (@JSeyff) August 1, 2023\n\nGrayscale\u2019s filing includes two applications: a proposed Grayscale Global Bitcoin Composite ETF and a Grayscale Ethereum Futures ETF. Grayscale\u2019s Ether ETF will invest in futures contracts that are set to be traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.\n\nThe SEC filing notes that Grayscale\u2019s fund will primarily invest \u201cfront-month\u201d Ether futures, which are contracts with \u201cthe shortest time to maturity.\u201d Grayscale added that it intends to \u201croll\u201d Ether futures contracts before they expire.\n\nVolatility Shares also outlined plans to list an Ether futures ETF, investing its assets in cash-settled contracts referencing ETH trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. It\u2019s noted that the fund will not invest directly in Ether.\n\nVolatility\u2019s filing also notes that it intends to enter into cash-settled Ether futures contracts as the buyer. Cash-settled futures markets typically see a counterparty pay cash to the buyer if the price of a futures contract goes up, while the buyer would pay the counterparty if the price of the futures contract goes down.\n\nRelated: BlackRock Bitcoin ETF could unlock $30 trillion worth of wealth, Bloomberg analyst says\n\nVanEck\u2019s filing also indicates that its investment strategy will look to invest in ETH futures contracts so that the value of ETH that the fund has exposure to is equal to 100% of the total assets of the fund.\n\nThe filing notes that any changes in the value of ETH would result in larger changes to VanEck\u2019s Ether ETF fund. This would include the potential for \u201cgreater losses than if the Fund\u2019s exposure to the value of ETH were unleveraged.\u201d\n\nProShares gave an overview of their Short Ether Strategy ETF, which will invest in daily contracts that look to profit on losses of the S&P CME Ether Futures index. As explained, the ProShares fund would gain as much as the index loses on a given day, while the converse would apply.\n\nThese applications come in the wake of recent applications from various mainstream asset management firms looking to launch Bitcoin ETFs. The world\u2019s largest asset manager, BlackRock, is among those looking to offer what would be the first Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs offered in the country.\n\nCollect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space.\n\nMagazine: \u2018Elegant and ass-backward\u2019: Jameson Lopp\u2019s first impression of Bitcoin"

        "content": "The latest sign of crypto going mainstream among traditional investors is the race heating up to launch the first exchange-traded fund (ETF) tied to Ethereum futures. In recent weeks, six companies have filed proposals with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch Ethereum futures ETFs.\n\nThe Race To Launch An Ethereum Futures ETF\n\nCryptocurrency ETFs track the price of the digital currencies they are tied to and they are not a new thing in the crypto industry. Bitcoin futures have gained popularity in recent years and are already being offered by popular investment companies.\n\nHowever, with bitcoin futures ETFs now established, it is only natural for the next hot product to be an Ethereum futures ETF. So far, more than 10 Ethereum futures ETFs have been filed in the past, but none have been approved by the SEC.\n\nVolatility Shares Ether Strategy ETF was the first to be filed on July 28. Since then, Bitwise Ethereum Strategy ETF, Roundhill Ether Strategy ETF, VanEck\u2019s Ethereum Strategy ETF, and Proshares Short Ether Strategy ETF have been filed and are awaiting clearance, as reported by Bloomberg Intelligence.\n\nNow, Grayscale Investments is also looking to join the pack with its new Ethereum Futures ETF filing. After withdrawing its filing earlier due to SEC concerns, the digital currency asset management company is now back with a better application. Bitwise, another crypto index fund manager, also withdrew its previous filing at the same time.\n\nETH price jumps to $1,839 | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nAccording to the filing, the majority of the Grayscale Investments fund\u2019s assets would be placed in Ether futures contracts with \u201cfront-month\u201d maturities, which have \u201cthe shortest time to maturity.\u201d The company also intends to diversify into other Ethereum contracts in the coming future.\n\nWhy Ethereum Futures ETFs Are Gaining Traction\n\nThe buzz around crypto ETFs was recently ignited by the news of BlackRock and other investment companies filing applications with the SEC for Spot Bitcoin ETFs. However, the SEC is still yet to give the go-ahead, citing failure to meet anti-fraud and investor protection standards in past applications.\n\nAnalysts report that BlackRock\u2019s Bitcoin ETF could unlock $30 trillion worth of wealth. Of course, there\u2019s no guarantee if or when they may get the green light.\n\nFor crypto investors and the industry, an Ethereum futures ETF would no doubt be a game changer. If approved, Ethereum futures would become available to investors 75 days after the application date. It would provide an easy, low-cost way for investors of these investment companies to gain exposure to the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap.\n\nAs for ETH\u2019s spot price, it has been struggling to break above $2,000 this year. At the time of writing, ETH is trading at $1,843.96. But if the filings are approved by the SEC, it may signal the beginning of the next Ethereum bull run.\n\nFeatured image from iStock, chart from Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Charles Hoskinson, the founder of Cardano, has recently emphasized the financial advantage of Cardano over Ethereum when it comes to transaction costs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe crypto mogul pointed to a tweet claiming a transaction of 56 assets on the Cardano network cost just $0.14, a fee he claims could never be matched by Ethereum.\n\nIn his tweet, he hints that the lower costs may be attributed to the unique features of Cardano's blockchain architecture including extended UTXO (Eutxo), native assets, and its smart contract language Plutus.\n\nExtended UTXO refers to the underlying ledger model of Cardano. Meanwhile, Plutus is the platform\u2019s smart contract language, which powers decentralized applications (DApps). These elements are designed to ensure secure and cost-efficient transactions, which is key to the overall utility and adoption of a blockchain network.\n\nThe lower transaction cost is a major point of contention between Cardano and Ethereum, the latter of which has faced criticism for its high transaction fees, particularly during periods of network congestion. Cardano, which is known as the \"Japanese Ethereum,\" is aiming to offer a more accessible, affordable, and permissionless blockchain.\n\nHoskinson's comments align with his previous criticisms of Ethereum, where he notably challenged the staking mechanism of the blockchain he once helped to create.\n\nHe has been known to contrast the approaches of the two platforms, suggesting that Cardano's proof-of-stake protocol is designed more effectively, contributing to its superiority over Ethereum.\n\nIn a series of critical remarks, Hoskinson has also described Ethereum as \"a dumpster fire\" and suggested that it could become obsolete."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nTerm Labs today launches its fixed-rate lending protocol on Ethereum. Term Finance is a milestone towards the development of a more mature crypto market, one with rules more familiar to TradFi lenders and borrowers than current Decentralized Finance (DeFi) protocols.\n\nVariable rates are the current rule in DeFi, making it riskier for large professional portfolios to get on board.\n\nInterest rates on protocols like Aave and Compound are calculated according to supply and demand. So, if a crypto whale deposits a boatload of funds into a lending pool, rates across the board will plummet in accordance with the abundance of supply, and vice versa.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Term team channeled the U.S. Treasury for inspiration, specifically its auction calendar model, which matches borrowers and lenders who have set predetermined rates. The collateral is then locked up in a smart contract for the duration of the auction, aka the loan\u2019s term.\n\nTerm Finance promises zero slippage\u2014an occurrence where the expected price of a trade is different from the final price after the trade has been executed. It also promises no spread, which is when two listed prices (commonly buy and sell) are different.\n\nIn addition, the team hopes investors and traders will be lured by low fees and high-quality blue chip collateral like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and stablecoins by Circle and Tether\n\nBack in February, Term Labs raised $2.5 million to build the lending platform. The funding round was led by Electric Capital and included contributions from Coinbase Ventures, Circle Ventures, Robot Ventures, and Mexc Ventures.\n\nTerm Labs turns to the future\n\nBilly Welch, Term Labs\u2019 co-founder confirmed with Decrypt that Term Finance will branch out into other blockchains and layer-2 solutions \u201cshortly after\u201d the first launch on Ethereum. While no dates were given, Welch said the protocol \u201cwill be multi-chain soon.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe \u201cmost popular\u201d lending and borrowing activities among the 2,000 testnet users and private mainnet beta was, according to Welch, borrowing stablecoins against liquid staking tokens (LSTs), in particular Lido Finance\u2019s wrapped stETH.\n\nPeople also borrowed Tether against USDC \u201cas the borrowing rate on Tether can be very volatile\u201d and, Welch says, borrowing ETH against LSTs will be a popular transaction \u201cto enhance staking yields.\u201d\n\nThe shortest duration of loan will be four weeks, but Welch envisions the 1- and 3-month loans will be the most popular, although the protocol hopes to eventually host terms of a year or more.\n\n\u201cWe are focused on borrowing and lending in the highest quality blue chip on an overcollateralized basis or a loan-to-value ratio in line with Aave and Compound,\" Welch said. \"The rates in our Beta ranged from low-to-mid 3% for borrowing stables against high-quality crypto assets. We expect other collateral types like wBTC to be popular. Over time, the protocol may expand to other assets as collateral or to supply and borrow but for now, we\u2019re sticking to the majors.\u201d"

        "title": "Ethereum Name Service: Whale causes flurry amidst July dip - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "ENS whale reclaimed ETH worth 44.14 million on 31 July.\n\nMost traders did not seem too keen about trading ENS at press time.\n\nAmid last month\u2019s decline in .eth domain registrations on Ethereum Name Service [ENS], crypto user darkmarket.eth reclaimed 39,712 Ether [ETH] worth $74.17 million on 31 July, blockchain sleuth Lookonchain found.\n\nAfter 2.7 years of dormancy, darkmarket.eth reclaimed 39,712 $ETH ($74.17M) locked in the ENS auction just now. And transferred 63,734 $ETH($119M) out to a new wallet.https://t.co/OtXYRpcOhn \u2014 Lookonchain (@lookonchain) July 31, 2023\n\nThe whale, after that, transferred over $119 million in ETH to a new wallet.\n\nThe owner of the darkmarket.eth domain reclaimed their ETH two years after ENS founder and lead developer Nick Johnson reminded them that the funds were locked up in ENS deposits from the first two years of the service.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s ENS\u2019s market cap in BTC\u2019s terms\n\nInvestors chorused \u201cno,\u201d to .eth name registrations in July\n\nThe whale\u2019s decision to reclaim its long-held ENS tokens came at a time when the platform recorded a monthly decline in name registrations. According to a Dune Analytics dashboard, ENS name registrations totaled 31,029 in July. This represented a 14% fall from the 35,963 recorded in .eth registrations in June.\n\nOn a year-to-date, monthly ENS name registrations have plummeted by 45%. Since its monthly all-time high of 437,365 name registrations in September 2021, this has trended downward.\n\nFurther, data from Dune Analytics showed that the count of new addresses created on the ENS network experienced a decline in July. The protocol saw a mere 25,115 new addresses created within the 31-day period. This was an 18% decrease from June\u2019s count of 30,722 addresses.\n\nAfter closing June at a high of 30,099 names, primary ENS name registrations dropped by 19% by July ending. A primary ENS name is a unique, human-readable name used to identify and locate a specific Ethereum address.\n\nRegarding monthly revenue made by the protocol from new name registrations and renewals, there has been a steady decline since January. According to Dune Analytics, monthly revenue from new registrations fell by 52% between January and July.\n\nLikewise, the monthly revenue made from name renewals plummeted by 2% within the same period.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ENS Profit Calculator\n\nLook elsewhere for gains\n\nSharing a statistically significant positive correlation with leading coin Bitcoin [BTC], ENS has also traded within a tight range in the past few weeks. At press time, the alt exchanged hands at $9.50, per data from CoinMarketCap.\n\nWith many unsure of the altcoin\u2019s next direction, an assessment of its price movements on the daily chart revealed that day traders have stayed their hands from aggressive token accumulation. At press time, key momentum indicators lay flat.\n\nThe Money Flow Index (MFI) rested below its center line at 35.14, suggesting that selling momentum exceeded accumulation. While the Relative Strength Index (RSI) was above the center line at 51.77, it moved sideways, signaling a rather unenthusiastic trading activity."

        "content": "Asset managers catering to investors in the digital currency ecosystem have gone on the offensive with troves of filings for Ethereum (ETH) Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) products in the United States.\n\nInsights into the Ethereum ETF Filing\n\nAccording to reports, a total of 7 new Ethereum-based ETFs have been filed including that from pioneer Volatility Shares.\n\nadvertisement\n\nSome of the big names that have joined the race to list Ethereum ETFs include Bitwise which filed its application for the Bitwise Ethereum Strategy ETF; Roundhill with Roundhill Ether Strategy ETF; VanEck with Ethereum Strategy ETF; Grayscale with the Grayscale Ethereum Futures ETF (ETHG), and; ProShares which filed two different applications including Short Ether Strategy ETF and Ether Strategy ETF respectively.\n\nThe quest for Ethereum ETF is quite justified considering the fact that the industry stakeholders are now currently anticipating the verdict on the first probable Bitcoin ETF product from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nA few months back, asset management behemoth BlackRock broke the stalemate when it applied to list a spot Bitcoin ETF product. The move came as a shock to key stakeholders in the space but also re-ignited the interest of other investment firms who also re-applied to list related products in the country.\n\nMany believe the time is ripe for the US to welcome its own Bitcoin ETF product considering the fact that its key allies including Germany, Brazil, and Switzerland have Bitcoin ETFs trading on national bourses.\n\nWill the US SEC Approve Ether ETF?\n\nWhile the United States SEC has approved a Futures-based Bitcoin ETF product from ProShares and a couple of other asset managers, a full-blown spot Bitcoin ETF is yet to be approved. This has notably dampened the sentiment in the community.\n\nHowever, considering the claims of Eric Balchunas, a Senior ETF Analyst for Bloomberg, there is \u201ca very good chance of getting approved, and likely all of them launching on the same day, right around Oct 16th.\u201d\n\nHere's a look at the seven Ether Futures ETFs that have been filed, which we think have a very good chance of getting approved, and likely all of them launching on the same day, right around Oct 16th. https://t.co/kEnXpWwNps \u2014 Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) August 2, 2023\n\nWhile the community is questioning the rationale for this claim, there are a number of visible triggers that might help bolster or fast track their broad approvals. The presence of BlackRock which many believe has a good market and political foothold and the forthcoming election year might change the stance of the SEC and the Biden administration at large."

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.\n\nLatest Prices\n\nTop Stories\n\nAs many as six asset managers have filed applications with the U.S. Securities and Exchange (SEC) for ether (ETH) futures-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs). First off the block on July 28 was the Volatility Shares Ether Strategy ETF. That filing was quickly followed by five other applications: the Bitwise Ethereum Strategy ETF, VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF, Roundhill Ether Strategy ETF, ProShares Short Ether Strategy ETF, and Grayscale Ethereum Futures ETF all were submitted to the SEC by August 1. Grayscale currently operates the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) with just more than $3 billion in assets under management. It\u2019s suffered from a long period of trading at a substantial discount to net asset value \u2013 41.5% as of yesterday.\n\nMicroStrategy (MSTR), the software developer that\u2019s amassed a giant bitcoin stash in recent years, filed to raise up to $750 million in share sales, with plans to use the proceeds to in part buy more bitcoin. The news came just after the company announced its second quarter results late Tuesday afternoon. Including some small bitcoin purchases made last month, MicroStrategy\u2019s holdings as of July 31 amounted to 152,800 tokens worth about $4.5 billion at current prices. The news seemingly gave a lift to bitcoin, which quickly rose about 3% and briefly breached $30,000. The price has since pulled back to the current $29,500.\n\nBinance counts China as its largest market, followed by South Korea, Turkey, Vietnam, and the British Virgin Islands, according to documents reviewed by the Wall Street Journal. The Journal reports that despite the ban on crypto within China, teams from Binance regularly collaborate with Chinese law enforcement to detect potential criminal activity. It also has 900,000 active users in-country, according to the report. A spokesperson for the exchange did not immediately respond to CoinDesk's request for comment. Data from the Journal shows that China is a $80.6 billion futures market and a $9.4 billion spot market for Binance. Second place South Korea provides $56.9 billion in futures volume and $1.39 billion in spot volume, and fifth place British Virgin Islands is responsible for $12.82 billion in spot volume and $5 billion in futures volume.\n\nStory continues\n\nChart of the Day\n\nThe chart shows the number of addresses with a non-zero bitcoin balance has increased to a new record high of 47.9 million.\n\nPer Glassnode, it's a sign of continued bitcoin adoption.\n\nDisclaimer: This article was written and edited by CoinDesk journalists with the sole purpose of informing the reader with accurate information.

        "content": "Bitcoin and other top crypto tokens were trading higher on Wednesday after Fitch's action. The global rating agency downgraded the US long-term ratings to AA+ from AAA. This downgrade comes at a time when companies are reporting relatively positive earnings.\n\n\n\nBitcoin was back in action on Wednesday as the largest crypto token gained as much as 3 per cent to regain the 29,000-mark. However, its largest peer, Ethereum, was trading higher as it gained more than 2 per cent and it climbed above the $1,850-levels. Altcoins were trading mostly up.\n\n\n\nBitcoin has surged above $29,000 in the past 24 hours . This rise could be attributed to MicroStrategy's decision to sell $750 million in stocks and utilize the funds to acquire more bitcoin. Another potential factor could be the recent downgrade of the US dollar by Fitch, indicating concerns about debt and fiscal deterioration, said Edul Patel, co-founder and CEO at Mudrex.\n\n\n\n\"Interestingly, this situation stands in stark contrast to the reaction seen in 2012 when companies reacted nervously to S&P's downgrade of US debt. Investors are now eagerly anticipating the Litecoin hardening event. Meanwhile, Ethereum has been trading within a range of $1,800 to $1,900 for the past week and is currently trading around $1,867,\" he said.\n\n\n\nBarring the US dollar pegged Tether, all top crypto tokens were trading higher on Wednesday. Polygon surged about 4 per cent while Litecoin and BNB gained 3 per cent each. Cardano, XRP, Dogecoil and Polkadot were trading 2 per cent up each during the early day.\n\n\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market cap was trading significantly higher, rising up to $1.19 trillion-mark as it jumped more than 2 per cent in the last 24 hours. However, the total trading volumes surged about 32 per cent to $39.93 billion.\n\n\n\n\n\nImage: Crypto-chart-price\n\n\n\nTech View by Giottus Crypto Platform\n\nBitcoin (BTC) has reversed its bearish momentum after hitting a low of $28,500 overnight. It is currently trading near $30,000 which is an important resistance level to flip for bullish price action. BTC dominance has hit 50% again indicating that Bitcoin will lead the market in terms of volatility and movement in the near term.\n\n\n\nChart-BTC\n\n\n\nBTC is currently consolidating in the $28,500 - $31,500 range which will intersect a long-term support line at the bottom mid-month. Price is likely to revisit these lows to test as support. Its14-day RSI (at 46) indicates a neutral sentiment. If BTC breaches $30,400 after testing support, momentum will likely lead the asset to its $31,500 resistance.\n\nMajor Levels:\n\nSupport: $28,800, $28,200\n\nResistance: $30,400, $31,500\n\n\n\n\n\n(Views and recommendations given in this section are the analysts' own and do not represent those of Business Today.

        "content": "Amidst the bustling crypto world, particularly in the Ethereum ecosystem, there\u2019s growing optimism about Ethereum\u2019s price. Many wonder if it will reach $2000 in August. Should you invest in Ethereum (ETH) now, or explore other rising projects like Pikamoon (PIKA)?\n\nThere\u2019s only one way to find answers. And that\u2019s through the expert analysis in this article.\n\nLatest Ethereum News: Hike in Rate, Trading Activities, and a Bullish Momentum\n\nOn July 26, the US Fed declared a 25% rate hike. Past data indicates that Ethereum (ETH) experienced notable gains in the weeks and months after the last two rate hikes on March 22 and May 3, 2023. Additionally, Ethereum\u2019s transaction volumes have been increasing in recent days.\n\nOn July 22, 1.14 million Ethereum (ETH) were transacted on the network and the daily transaction volume gradually rose to 1.88 million ETH on July 27. That is a 65% increase in only a week, confirming the positive potential the Fed rate hike could have on ETH.\n\nOverall, this rise in activity coinciding with the rate hike could push ETH to break the $2000 mark in August. This chance is certain should Ethereum (ETH) enter a 5% to 10% rise as it did during the previous rate hikes in March and May 2023. However, a dip toward $1,750 is still possible if the present support level fails to hold.\n\nExperts Recommend a More Likely Alternative in Pikamoon (PIKA)\n\nWhile Ethereum\u2019s growth chances might be speculative, experts have found a more promising and likely opportunity in Pikamoon (PIKA).\n\nPikamoon (PIKA) is an ambitious and disruptive GameFi project powered by a play-to-earn game called the Pikamoon Adventure set in the four worlds of the Pikaverse.\n\nHere, gamers get PIKA and NFTs as rewards for building empires, adventure contest triumphs, and treasure discovery. To better their chances, Pikamoon\u2019s marketplace allows gamers to increase their avatars\u2019 ability by buying boosts using PIKA.\n\nThe following features among others make this project\u2019s growth more likely:\n\nHigh Demand and Growth Potential\n\nNothing better affirms the potential of a project like demand and consistent growth. Pikamoon enjoys this as every feature requires $PIKA. These use cases bring ceaseless demand, propelling PIKA to fast growth. It is the reward token for gamers, the payment token on the marketplace, and more.\n\nSupported by the Best\n\nThe project\u2019s potential and the successes so far have drawn in support from users, top investors, and whales. They believe PIKA will be one of the most profitable investments in the GameFi market this year with a 10,000% ROI on the horizon this year. PIKA can be your ticket to millions in profits as a new or experienced investor.\n\nBuilt to Enjoy Two Blockchains Support\n\nPikamoon (PIKA) gets technical support from the two top NFT and Metaverse blockchains it builds on: MultiversX (Elrond) and Ethereum. With these two networks as its roots, Pikamoon and PIKA have enough to scale seamlessly, record explosive profits, and handle the massive influx that comes with this growth.\n\nPikamoon Presale is Another Sign of the Project\u2019s Convincing Potential\n\nThe ongoing Pikamoon presale again asserts the bullish sentiments of expert crypto analysts as it amasses nearly $4 million in sales in addition to delivering 300% in profits to early investors. These successes all happened while still in its third and final phase, meaning there\u2019s more to come for PIKA holders.\n\nPlus, with experts predicting a 10,000% increase before the end of the year, accumulating $PIKA is a no-brainer.\n\nFind out more about Pikamoon (PIKA):\n\nBuy Now: https://pikamoon.io/buy\n\nWebsite: https://pikamoon.io\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Pikamooncoin\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/pikamoonofficial\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

Despite Bitcoin\u2019s price declining by 5.5% and Ethereum\u2019s by 4.7%, Ethereum has shown resilience, gaining 4.9% against Bitcoin over the past month, according to the Santiment report.\n\nadvertisement\n\nXRP Comes Out As Winner\n\nEthereum\u2019s utility numbers by the end of July were reminiscent of those in May when its price dominance against Bitcoin was more significant. This could be an indicator of Ethereum\u2019s robust network utility playing a part in its market resilience.\n\nSantiment report also revealed that in contrast, Ripple\u2019s XRP emerged as one of the biggest winners of the month, posting a 42% return. The positive performance was largely attributed to the landmark ruling in the SEC lawsuit, which established that XRP is not a security. This unexpected verdict sparked significant buying activity, elevating XRP even as other crypto assets witnessed declining market caps. Other digital assets that saw gains in July included Stellar, Maker, and XinFin.\n\nOn the negative side, Santiment\u2019s statistics showed a worrisomely low amount of whale transactions, implying that important stakeholders are not interested in purchasing the dip. The market capitalization of Bitcoin has been steadily falling and is currently hovering around the $29k price point. Even though the price of Bitcoin has dropped below $30k, large investors have exhibited reluctance, possibly indicating doubt about the near-term prospects of the market.\n\nAlso Read: Top DeFi Tokens Crash Following Curve Event, Will the Domino Spread Further?\n\nHow Is The Market Doing?\n\nThe general mood of the cryptocurrency market has changed from \u201cgreed\u201d to \u201cneutral\u201d. The most popular cryptocurrency in the world, Bitcoin, is currently trading at a much more constrained level of $29,500 after reaching $31,000 on July 4, 2023. The U.S. Federal Reserve increased its benchmark lending rate by 25 basis points to a range between 5.25% and 5.50%, as the market had anticipated, which helped to support Bitcoin a little bit.\n\nAlso Read: Will XRP Price Gains Come Undone As Federal Court Rejects Ripple Ruling?"

        "content": "ETH price has spent the last few months within the $1800 and $2,000 price ranges.\n\nDespite this, the majority of its investors continue to hold at a profit.\n\nIn the last month, the price of leading altcoin Ethereum [ETH] has lingered between $1800 and $2,000. While its price faces significant resistance at $1,900, ETH remains a profitable investment for many holders, on-chain data shows.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nAccording to a recent tweet from on-chain analytics platform IntoTheBlock, 64% of current ETH holders hold at a profit. Above 50%, this showed that most ETH holders are currently experiencing a gain in the value of their holdings.\n\n63.9% of ETH holders are currently in profit.\n\nThe bubbles below show important potential resistance/support levels for $ETH. smaller bubbles are easier to surpass when price starts moving. pic.twitter.com/guf4n5PKKH \u2014 IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) July 31, 2023\n\nETH bag-holders have a reason to smile\n\nDespite the coin\u2019s sideways movements, transactions involving ETH have mostly returned profits, data from Santiment revealed. A look at the ratio of daily on-chain transaction volume in profit to loss confirmed this.\n\nThis metric shows the ratio between transaction volume in profit and transaction volume in loss. When it returns a positive value, profit-taking transactions exceed loss-taking ones. Conversely, when the metric is negative, it suggests that losses overwhelm profits during a specified time frame.\n\nOn a 30-day moving average, ETH\u2019s ratio of daily on-chain transaction volume in profit to loss has remained positive. At press time, this stood at 1.2, meaning ETH profit-taking transactions happened almost twice as fast as loss-taking transactions.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ETHs worth today\n\nLikewise, ETH\u2019s Market Value to Realized Value ratio (MVRV) remains above the zero line. This metric track whether an asset is overvalued or undervalued. It shows the ratio between the current price and the average price of every coin/token acquired.\n\nThe more the ratio increases, the more people will be willing to sell as the potential profits increase. At 22% on a 30-day moving average, more traders might be willing to let go of their ETH holdings to book gains.\n\nAs profitable transactions count rally, ETH has seen a significant uptick in network activity, data from Santiment revealed. According to the data provider, \u201cEthereum\u2019s market price has gained +4.9% against Bitcoin over the past month, and rebounding network growth has had a lot to do with this.\u201d\n\nTo end July\u2019s trading session, ETH recorded a two-week high of 450,000 daily active address count during the intraday trading session on 31 July. On the same day, over 80,000 new addresses were created to trade the altcoin. This represented the highest daily count in the last ten days, data from Santiment revealed."

The post mentioned that the Indian sweet ghevar was the \u2018crypto birthday cake\u2019.

        "content": "Bitcoin and other top crypto tokens were trading lower on Tuesday, with altcoin falling sharply. Chaos is looming in the market on the back of pessimistic news flow. Also, lack of macroeconomic events is unable to support the movement in the digital token market.\n\n\n\nBitcoin was back in the red zone on Tuesday as the largest crypto token dropped about 2 per cent and breached below 29,000-mark. However, its largest peer, Ethereum also posted similar declines, falling more than 2 per cent and it slipped below $1,850-levels. Altcoins were mostly bleeding.\n\n\n\nThe crypto market has undergone some selling pressure in the last 24 hours. Contrastingly, the crypto fear and greed index has climbed 3 points since yesterday and continues to remain in the neutral zone with a score of 53/100, said Shubham Hudda, Senior Manager, CoinSwitch Markets Desk.\n\n\n\n\"Bitcoin continues to make new lows in the daily chart as it traded at its lowest price in 40 days in the early trading hours for the day. From a purely technical analysis lens, not a lot of downside remains in it if the bullish trend line were to be respected and we could see a reversal from the trend line support which sits at around $27,000 for the day,\" he said.\n\n\n\nAll top crypto tokens were trading lower on Tuesday. Bitcoin Cash dropped more than 5 per cent, while Solana and Polygon declined about 5 per cent each. Cardano and Litecoin tumbled 4 per cent each. Polkadot, Dogecoin, Tron and XRP shed 3 per cent each.\n\n\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market cap was trading sharply lower, falling down to $1.16 trillion-mark as it dropped more than 2 per cent in the last 24 hours. However, the total trading volumes surged about 17 per cent to $30.15 billion.\n\n\n\nThe crypto market is currently in a consolidation phase, with Bitcoin trading in a narrow range. This is likely due to a lack of major macroeconomic news, which has made it difficult for investors to make directional bets, said CoinDCX Research Team.\n\n\n\nImage: Crypto-chart-price\n\n\n\nTech View by WazirX Trade Desk\n\nStormX (STMX) stands out as a pioneering global cryptocurrency-based solution that has successfully expanded its reach to worldwide markets.

In 2021, he made an unprecedented donation to support India's fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. He donated $1 billion worth of Shiba Inu cryptocurrency coins to CryptoRelief, a Covid relief fund established by Sandeep Nailwal, co-founder of crypto organization Polygon.\n\nHowever, it was later reported that only 5 percent of Mr Buterin's original donation was utilized for Covid relief efforts in India. This was due to the volatile nature of the meme coins, which saw their value fluctuate dramatically following the donation. CryptoRelief, therefore, returned $100 million in cryptocurrency to Mr Buterin to avoid conflict with Indian laws and the distribution of relief funds.\n\n\"CryptoRelief sending $100m of the $SHIBA funds back to me. I plan to personally deploy these funds with the help of science advisors to complement CryptoRelief's existing excellent work with some higher-risk higher-reward COVID science and relief projects worldwide,\" Mr Buterin said in a tweet."

        "content": "The XRP20 crypto project announced the launch of its presale today, August 1st, at xrp20coin.com.\n\nBuilt as an ERC20 token on the Ethereum blockchain, XRP20 aims to be a more user focused and accessible token \u2013 adding stake to earn utility, a burn mechanism making it deflationary, and a low price point even cheaper than the all-time low XRP price, currently available on presale at a single stage price of 1 XRP20 = $0.000092.\n\nXRP20 Presale Tokenomics\n\n$XRP20 has a 100 billion total supply modelled on XRP\u2019s tokenomics.\n\nOf that total supply, 40% is allocated to the presale, 40% to staking rewards, 10% to exchange liquidity and 10% to its scheduled token burn. 0.1% of every XRP20 transaction is automatically burnt.\n\nThe XRP20 presale soft cap is $1.85 million, and its hard cap $3.68 million.\n\nWhy Buy XRP20 Token?\n\nThe XRP20 website states that putting its community first, the retail investor, is the focus of the project:\n\n\u2018No retail buyer had the chance to buy XRP during any ICO back in 2012 when the company was formed. But today you can buy XRP20 in presale at an even lower price than $0.01 when the original token entered the market. The original XRP was designed for legacy financial institutions and has always lacked utility for retail investors. XRP20 changes this by introducing on-chain staking. Now anybody holding XRP20 can stake their tokens to earn passive income.\u2019\n\nThe XRP20 price is approximately 30 times cheaper than the XRP price at its all-time low of $0.0028.\n\nThe decision to launch on ETH also provides additional benefits \u2013 Ethereum is the most used and secure chain with the widest range of decentralized wallet providers, making it simple for buyers to trade, track and store XRP20.\n\nNot affiliated with Ripple, $XRP20 is also a vehicle for speculation with its low market cap, aiming to capitalize on the recent crypto trend of community-focused \u20182.0\u2019 and \u201820\u2019 themed coins that outperformed the market, such as Pepe 2.0.\n\nFollowing Pepe 2.0, a range of meme coins and \u20182.0 tokens\u2019 centred around Bitcoin, Ethereum and other big caps have launched, favored by traders for their high upside potential. XRP20 aims to combine both a high ROI potential at its IDO on Uniswap with its low market cap, and a long term roadmap \u2013 including its staking rewards and burn mechanism.\n\nXRP20 Token Trending\n\nCurrently attracting the attention of several crypto influencers, XRP20 was reviewed today by the CryptoNews YouTube channel and a range of crypto news sites, who noted its fair launch structure without incremental price rounds or team tokens.\n\nJoin the XRP20 Telegram at t.me/XRP20_coin \u2013 admins will not DM you first, beware of impersonators \u2013 and follow its official Twitter account @XRP20_coin to stay upto date on the project\u2019s progress.\n\nVisit XRP20 Presale"

In the recent crypto market rally, the price of Ethereum Classic rallied as high as $23. Although the price of the coin has now retraced back to the $19 level, many crypto analysts are still bullish about Ethereum Classic.\n\nIn the last couple of weeks, the Ethereum Classic price has tested the resistance level near $23.00 (200 EMA) three times.

Despite being a new DeFi project, Tradecurve has been able to command as much attention as it has because of its unique use case. Tradecurve is building what will become the first hybrid trading platform where users will be able to access and trade financial instruments from the global derivatives market.\n\nOn the platform, users will be able to trade stocks, options, forex, crypto, and commodities with only one account. This will actively solve the problem traders face in managing multiple accounts.\n\nIn addition, it will link Tradecurve to one of the biggest markets in the world. In June 2022, the Bank for International Settlement estimated that the global derivatives market was worth $632 trillion. This will give Tradecurve more liquidity than every other DeFi project.\n\nBy solving a major problem with DeFi, Tradecurve has earned a frontrunner seat in the next major expansion. Crypto analysts have predicted that the utility token of Tradecurve, TCRV, will also be positively impacted by its market.\n\nAt press time, TCRV trades at $0.025 per token in its fifth presale stage but is expected to hit a high of $0.029 in the coming week. Long-term predictions peg the price of TCRV at $1.5 before the end of this year, making it one of 2023\u2019s biggest gainers.\n\nVisit the links below to get more information about Tradecurve and the TCRV token:\n\nClick Here For the Website\n\nClick Here To Buy TCRV Presale Tokens\n\nFollow Us Twitter\n\nJoin Our Community on Telegram"

The transactions were reportedly part of OTC deals with investors like Tron founder Justin Sun, market maker DWF Labs, crypto trader DCFGod, and DeFi platform Cream Finance.\n\nAccording to reports, Egorov and the buyers agreed on lock-up periods ranging from three to six months. These investors can also sell their CRV should the price rise to $0.80.\n\nEgorov\u2019s flurry of OTC deals is purportedly a move to cushion his $60 million on Aave collateralized by $175 million in CRV tokens. Liquidation of the founder\u2019s Aave loan could trigger a domino effect of bad debt across several DeFi lending services, potentially plunging the decentralized lending ecosystem into disarray.\n\nThis scenario only plays out should CRV\u2019s price plunge significantly below $0.3 thus liquidating Egorov\u2019s massive Aave loan. Concerns regarding the possibility were raised after factory exploits on Curve Finance liquidity pools and the ensuing CRV price decline."

        "content": "TAIPEI, Aug. 1, 2023 /CNW/ -- Unitas Foundation announced that Unitas Protocol mainnet is live on 31 July.\n\nUnitas Foundation announced that Unitas Protocol mainnet is live and allows anyone to mint unitized stablecoins with USDT.\n\nUnitas Protocol is the first DeFi protocol offering unitized stablecoins, a new stablecoin category that functions as Units of Account for different emerging market currencies. It mitigates emerging market dollar shortages by opening access to global USD liquidity for businesses and individuals needing safe and affordable cross-border transactions.\n\nUnitas Protocol allows anyone to mint unitized stablecoins with USDT. It \"unitizes\" a USD stablecoin (e.g., USDT) into one local currency unit.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe first unitized stablecoins open to minting are USD91 (INR-pegged), USD971 (AED-pegged), USD84 (VND-pegged), and USD1 (USD-pegged). Unitas' naming convention prefixes its stablecoin names with the Store of Value (e.g., \"USD\") and suffixes them with country codes (e.g., \"91\" for INR) that indicate Units of Account of emerging market currencies.\n\nA unitized stablecoin reflects the value of one unit of emerging market currency (e.g., INR) denominated in some USD stablecoin (e.g., USDT).\n\nUnitas Protocol allows anyone to mint unitized stablecoins with USDT. It \u201cunitizes\u201d a USD stablecoin (e.g., USDT) into one local currency unit.\n\n\"Today is a significant milestone for Unitas and the global financial and digital asset ecosystems,\" said Wayne Huang, co-founder and board member of Unitas Foundation. \"Unitas Protocol unlocks stablecoin real-world business and individual applications.\"\n\nAs emerging market small medium enterprises (SMEs) continue to face US Dollar liquidity shortages, stablecoins pegged to USD (especially USDT) have been widely adopted among merchants, importers and exporters in their domestic and cross-border transactions.\n\nDespite USD stablecoins' convenience, each country has its sovereign currency unit that is the primary denomination in domestic quotations, transactions, and communication. Unitized stablecoins bridge this gap by providing users with guaranteed, on-chain USD liquidity while still allowing them to quote, transact, and communicate using their respective countries' primary Units of Account.\n\nStory continues\n\nCurrently, an Indian importer must buy USDT with INR cash via a peer-to-peer transaction and pay the USDT to its supplier. The importer then sells its received goods to local distributors and gets paid in INR cash. The exchange rate, profit, and cost calculations are always complicated.\n\nUSD91 solves this by maintaining competitive rates and guaranteeing USD stablecoin (e.g., USDT) liquidity, which is over-reserved on-chain for anyone to audit. The same solution framework applies to USD stablecoin liquidity in countries such as Vietnam (via USD84) and UAE (via USD971).\n\nIn short, while holding a unitized stablecoin (e.g., USD91) is equivalent to holding a USD stablecoin (e.g., USDT), unitized stablecoins enable local currency-denominated, stablecoin-based transactions that allow more straightforward quotation and communication in users' familiar Units of Account.\n\nUnitas Protocol is essentially a value translator between USD and other currencies and guarantees that its stablecoin can unconditionally convert back to a USD stablecoin. With unitized stablecoins, each country can have its own best version of USDT, acting as a common denomination for all kinds of transactions.\n\nAbout Unitas Foundation\n\nUnitas Foundation is a non-profit organization founded in 2022. Unitas Protocol operates exogenously over-reserved stablecoins pegged to emerging market currencies. These stablecoins unleash emerging market potentials by facilitating foreign investment, cross-border payment, global market access, DeFi participation, efficient USD liquidity, and more.\n\nTo learn more about Unitas Foundation, visit its official website ( https://unitas.foundation ), Wiki , Telegram , Twitter, blog , or email team@unitas.foundation .\n\n\u2014\n\nDisclaimer:\n\nThe press release is only for informative purposes.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nSince the arrival of CryptoKitties in 2017 and DeFi Summer in 2020, the industry is still grappling with how to make blockchains better, cheaper, and faster.\n\nAnd this is precisely where Offchain Labs\u2019 chief strategy officer A.J. Warner and his team are setting up camp: solving the famed blockchain trilemma.\n\nThe blockchain trilemma refers to the three core challenges developers face when building a blockchain: scalability, security, and decentralization. Gains made in one of these areas are concessions in another.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWith so many options for trade-offs, there have been several experiments across the layer-1 space, ranging from Ethereum to Solana, Algorand, and Celestia.\n\n\u201cEthereum solves that by focusing on security, decentralization, and outsourcing throughput to rollups, that\u2019s their version,\u201d Warner told Decrypt.\n\nAs for a network like Solana, it's attempting to have \u201call of this throughput exist in a single environment, and make sure that the thing is also secure and decentralized,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not even sure if this might defy the law of physics.\u201d\n\nAs for a solution to the trilemma, the developer team at Offchain Labs is working hard to scale Ethereum with its rollup-based network called Arbitrum.\n\nAt $5.68 billion in total value locked, a measure of how much money is sloshing around a protocol or dapp, Arbitrum is head and shoulders above the competition. In terms of speed, it\u2019s certainly an improvement, too, with a measured daily seven transactions per second over the last week.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCompared to payment heavyweights, like Mastercard or Visa, however, it\u2019s still far from replacing the traditional competition.\n\n\u201cIf somebody solves the trilemma in a more efficient way, that would be the big breakthrough,\u201d said Warner. \u201cBut, I don't think we're so close.\u201d\n\nAlongside solving one of the industry\u2019s trickiest problems, such a solution would also have to earn the mindshare of the developer masses.\n\n\u201cYou don't have to just solve it,\u201d he told Decrypt at EthCC Paris this year. \u201cIt has to be a huge order of magnitude, an experience that will inspire confidence in both users and developers.\n\nArbitrum\u2019s \u2018holy grail\u2019\n\nWarner says that one of the areas the Arbitrum team is \u201creally excited\u201d to be working on is permissionless validation, which he describes as \u201cpretty close to the holy grail of rollup technology.\u201d\n\nRollups are a type of scaling solution that \u201crolls\u201d multiple transactions together. The final transaction is presented to the blockchain as a single transaction.\n\nThere are two main types of rollups: Optimistic and zero knowledge.\n\nOptimistic rollups assume the rolled-up data is valid, thus speeding things up. To protect against fraud and error, optimistic rollup protocols allow users to contest transactions. The flagged transaction is submitted directly to the Ethereum network to check its legitimacy and settle the dispute.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nZero-knowledge rollups\u2013 zk-rollups\u2013rely on zero-knowledge proof cryptography, which allows a key detail, such as how old someone is, to be mathematically proven without disclosing additional information, like that person\u2019s nationality without disclosing their passport.\n\nOf the two rollup flavors, Arbitrum falls into the optimistic category.\n\nWarner says permissionless validation is the holy grail of rollup tech \u201cbecause the fundamental security properties of a rollup, which distinguish it from alternative L1s and Ethereum, is you only need to trust one honest validator. And if it's permissionless, that\u2019s another way of saying you only need to trust yourself.\u201d\n\nAccording to Warner, there are fifteen external validators on Arbitrum, which gives users some level of confidence.\n\nNow, if one of them submitted an invalid state transition, then in a permissionless system, users can challenge it themselves and have the confidence that they can protect their assets in real-time.\n\nContrast this with the current system where, as Warner says, \u201cyou'd have to raise a red flag and one of the 15 validators would be incentivized to challenge anyways because they would want to defend the protocol, but then you rely on them to do it.\u201d He adds: \u201cSo, this is pretty close to the Holy Grail.\u201d\n\nPermissionless validation thus enables the community to assess the quality of its validators, bringing the network one step closer to full accountability and transparency.\n\nAnd, another step closer to adequately solving the industry\u2019s trilemma.\n\nAD\n\nAD"

        "content": "The Securities and Exchange Commission declared HEX and two other crypto projects led by Richard Heart as unregistered securities in a lawsuit.\n\nHeart allegedly raised $1 billion from HEX, PulseChain, and PulseX since 2019, per the SEC\u2019s claims in an Eastern District of New York court.\n\nThe token is now delisted on Uniswap\u2019s front-end interface, though the token is still tradeable on crypto\u2019s largest decentralized exchange.\n\nRichard Heart\u2019s HEX token is now delisted on leading decentralized exchange HEX days after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) alleged that the token is an unregistered security in a lawsuit filed on July 31.\n\nThe move does not mean that Uniswap users cannot trade the token. Rather, the crypto is removed from Uniswap\u2019s front-end user interface and appears with a warning note. Traders can still swap HEX on the DEX by directly calling up the token\u2019s smart contract.\n\nUniswap added HEX to its list of unsupported tokens found here. Cryptos in this list include coins delisted based on legal consideration and tokens that have proven to be scams or violate trademarks.\n\nSEC Sues Richard Heart\u2019s HEX And Pulse Projects\n\nOn July 31, the SEC sued Richard Heart whose government name is Richard Schueler. Heart was accused of raising at least $1 billion since 2019 from three crypto projects \u2013 HEX, PulseChain (PLS), and PulseX (PLSX).\n\nThe complaint filed at a District Court in Eastern New York also named Uniswap as a trading venue for Heart\u2019s tokens. According to the lawsuit, PulseX was launched as a Uniswap fork, and transactions of unregistered securities issued by Heart occurred on the DEX.\n\nVenue is proper in this District because many of the crypto asset transactions described herein took place on Uniswap, a so-called decentralized crypto asset trading platform whose developers are headquartered in Brooklyn.\n\nIncluded in the lawsuit are claims that Heart funneled cash invested in his crypto offerings toward funding a lavish personal lifestyle, thus defrauding investors of their money. The SEC has several cases against crypto founders including Alex Mashinsky, Changpeng Zhao, and Do Kwon."

        "content": "Mining is a complex process that crypto ecosystems utilize to validate transactions and add new blocks to their respective ledger networks. Mining is closely associated with the proof-of-work (PoW) consensus model that cryptographic projects like Bitcoin capitalize on. Other projects, including Ethereum, once validated transactions using the PoW method but later reverted to the proof of stake (PoS) validation method. While PoW and PoS remain the leading consensus mechanisms in the crypto world, a new blockchain tech reform called proof-of-process has emerged through Bitcoin Spark, with the potential to disrupt these two processes.\n\nEthereum and Bitcoin Mining are Outdated\n\nBitcoin uses the PoW consensus model to verify transactions on its network. The project involves using sophisticated computers and mining equipment that consume a lot of electrical energy to solve complex mathematical algorithms. In exchange, these computers earn rewards in the form of bitcoin (BTC). The participants who verify these transactions on the network are called miners. The mining process consumes a lot of energy and is typically expensive to set up and maintain the \u2018mines.\u2019\n\nOn the other hand, Ethereum uses PoS to validate transactions on its network. Participants lock their Ethereum (ETH) to gain validation rights that yield ETH in return. Ethereum staking may occur in two ways: solo staking and pooled staking. For solo staking, participants need to deposit a minimum of 32 ETH. The other alternative is pooled staking, where investors can stake on large crypto exchanges such as Coinbase and Binance.\n\nBitcoin Spark is revolutionizing Cryptocurrency Mining\n\nBitcoin Spark is a new decentralized project that leverages blockchain technology to revolutionize the crypto arena. The project is a major Bitcoin hard fork upgrade that solves the major challenges that the Bitcoin network faces. The project uses a proof-of-process (PoP) consensus model to verify transactions and maintain the network\u2019s operations. PoP combines the PoW mining method, the PoS validation method, and a special complex mathematical blueprint that undermines linear rewards in the form of BTCS tokens that are attributed to the computing power of mining devices or staking sizes. BTCS is the native token of Bitcoin Spark\u2019s ecology.\n\nThe blueprint algorithm is designed to maintain a standard in reward distribution for the validators and miners in the ecosystem. This way, there is a fair distribution of BTCS earnings regardless of the staking size or the type of mining device used. The Bitcoin Spark team is developing remote mining programs for Windows, Mac OS, iOS, as well as Android that will allow users to mine in the comfort of their homes.\n\nThe rewards will be calculated from a direct comparison of the stake an individual has locked as well as mining remotely done on the network in various devices of different computing power. In other words, this complex statement translates to: the higher the staking size and the more mining, the more the rewards an individual will get, but in a non-linear way. More rewards will be allocated to more work done by miners than larger stake sizes.\n\nLike the first-generation Bitcoin, Bitcoin Spark has a maximum supply of 21 million, from which 16.45 million have been allocated to mining rewards that will be distributed to users in more than 120 years. The remaining 4.55 million will be the launch supply, where 4 million BTCS have been delegated to the Initial Coin Offering (ICO) set to begin on 1st August. During the ICO\u2019s phase 1 duration, Bitcoin Spark will distribute BTCS tokens to interested parties at a discounted price of $1.50. Moreover, each purchase will automatically qualify for a 20% bonus from the team as a token of appreciation to early investors.\n\nOut of the launch supply, 500,000 BTCS tokens have been allocated to liquidity pools and exchanges ahead of the project\u2019s network launch. The remaining 50,000 tokens will be awarded to the team behind the project\u2019s development.\n\nBitcoin Spark\u2019s official launch price is $10. However, enterprising investors can purchase BTCS tokens at a discounted price of as little as $1.50 during the project\u2019s ICO phases. Once the project is fully launched, its tokenomics, utility, and functionalities support a steady price increase that will heavily reward early investors. Can you imagine purchasing Bitcoin at just $1? How much of it would you buy knowing its future prices will hit headlines?\n\nFor more information:\n\nWebsite: https://bitcoinspark.org/\n\nBuy BTCS: https://network.bitcoinspark.org/register\n\nThis publication is sponsored.

        "content": "On-chain data shows that Ethereum network-related indicators have turned green, something that could be constructive for the asset this month.\n\nEthereum Active Addresses & Network Growth Have Registered A Rise\n\nAccording to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, ETH has closed the month of July seeing positive developments in its underlying metrics. There are mainly two indicators of relevance here: the daily active addresses and the network growth.\n\nThe former of these keeps track of the daily total amount of addresses on the Ethereum network that are coming online and taking part in some transaction activity. The latter, on the other hand, measures the total number of new addresses that are being created by users every day.\n\nThe daily active addresses can be considered analogous to the number of unique users, whether new or existing ones, that are making use of the blockchain, while the network growth specifically only contains information about the new users that are coming to the network.\n\nHere is a chart that shows the trend in these two indicators for Ethereum over the last few months:\n\nLooks like both of these metrics have observed a surge in recent days | Source: Santiment on Twitter\n\nAs displayed in the above graph, the Ethereum daily active addresses and the network growth, both, have registered an uptick to head into the month of August.\n\nCurrently, the former metric has a value of 450,000, which means that 450,000 addresses are participating in transaction activity on the ETH blockchain daily. This level is the highest that the indicator has been in around two weeks.\n\nGenerally, whenever the chain is witnessing a high number of active addresses, it\u2019s a sign that a large amount of traders are interested in the cryptocurrency right now.\n\nSince ETH is receiving a large amount of traffic at the moment, it\u2019s possible that the price could soon register some volatility, although its direction could go either way.\n\nNew addresses on the network are also being created at a rate of more than 80,000 right now, suggesting that new users are constantly picking up the cryptocurrency.\n\nAdoption is always a constructive sign for any coin, as any sustainable growth in the price is only possible when the user base is also observing sufficient growth.\n\nIn the chart, the data for the ETH vs BTC price is also shown. It would appear that back in May, Ethereum had been rallying against Bitcoin, and while this had been happening, both the active addresses and the network growth had been at values similar to now.\n\nEthereum could potentially display similar strength against the top-ranking assets in the coming month if the network can keep up this new trend of elevated user activity.\n\nETH Price\n\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum is trading around $1,800, down 1% in the last week.\n\nETH has observed a plunge recently | Source: ETHUSD on TradingView\n\nFeatured image from Kanchanara on Unsplash.com, charts from TradingView.com, Santiment.net"

        "content": "As 2023 unveils more surprises in the crypto world, Bitcoin Spark and Worldcoin are poised to make a significant impact. Sam Altman\u2019s Worldcoin and Bitcoin Spark have emerged as formidable contenders, likely to outpace well-established giants like Solana (SOL) and Ethereum (ETH). These innovative projects shine due to their cutting-edge technologies and unique solutions to the crypto industry\u2019s challenges.\n\nWhat Is Bitcoin Spark?\n\nBitcoin Spark (BTCS) is a new fork from the Bitcoin family, striving to address speed, scalability, and access to the mining process. Bitcoin Spark appreciates that mining Bitcoin has become a preserve of a few, contrary to Satoshi\u2019s vision. As a result, BTCS introduces radical changes to the mining process and reward distribution. Whereas Bitcoin sticks to the proof-of-work system, Bitcoin Spark uses an all-new blockchain technology called \u201cProof-Of-Process\u201d (PoP). Under PoP, users needing computation power can rent and operate in a virtual environment. The project rewards miners with BTCS using an algorithmically-generated figure. The essence is to distribute rewards fairly, in a manner those with computing resources get more, but not to the extent of compromising security.\n\nMining will be available in an easy-to-use app compatible with Windows, iOS, Linux, and Mac OS. The Bitcoin Spark application operates in a virtual environment, ensuring secure transaction processing while limiting access to files and other phone capabilities to prevent interference during app usage. The software is designed to self-adjust its processing power based on user needs and battery capacity. Additionally, the app serves as a wallet, and users can create independent mining applications once launched.\n\nBTCS has its ICO commencing Aug 1 with a debut price of $1.50, and you can imagine being able to buy Bitcoin when it was only 1$. Bitcoin Spark allows for a 20 % bonus to early adopters and a chance to more than 10x gains on their investment when BTCS launches at $10.\n\nWorldcoin (WLD)\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman has unveiled Worldcoin, a new cryptocurrency requiring users to scan their eyes using \u201corb\u201d to establish a unique digital identity. The project, in development, aims to create \u201ca new identity and financial network owned by everyone.\u201d Altman believes Worldcoin could offer economic opportunities and serve as a solution to distinguish humans from AI-generated content online. To register, users download the World App and visit a Worldcoin operator for iris scanning. Altman hopes people will prove their real identity while maintaining privacy. The cryptocurrency offers a free token to users upon sign-up, with its value expected to rise. However, WLD faces serious privacy probes as authorities place caution. Worldcoin also faces ethical issues, as analysts point out its lack of sustainability.\n\nWill Ethereum go up?\n\nThe world\u2019s second-largest digital asset is more than just a crypto token and is famous for its powerful features and blockchain solutions. Experts believe Ethereum could recover and rise again after the 2022 slump due to its unique model, scalability solutions, and leadership in dApps. Ethereum is a darling for DeFi, smart contracts, DAOs, NFTs, and DApps. ETH\u2019s recent transition to a PoS with Ethereum 2.0 is expected to reduce energy consumption and improve scalability. As Ethereum continues to strengthen and innovate, it is likely to thrive in the long term and attract investors seeking to optimize their wealth.\n\nSolana Price Prediction\n\nSolana, a relatively young cryptocurrency launched in 2020, has quickly gained recognition as one of the most advanced blockchains and a potential \u201cEthereum Killer.\u201d It has already achieved a spot in the top ten cryptocurrencies by market cap. In November 2021, Solana\u2019s token achieved a remarkable milestone, reaching an all-time high of $259.96. However, the overall market experienced a slowdown, leading to SOL price decline. Despite the short-term fluctuations, Solana\u2019s price prediction is optimistic, indicating that the value of the Solana coin is expected to appreciate over time to become a worthwhile investment in the years to come.\n\nWrap Up\n\nAs the year surges through the third quarter, all eyes are on Worldcoin and Bitcoin Spark to see how they will reshape the landscape and potentially disrupt the dominance of the current market leaders. Bitcoin Spark\u2019s radical revolutionary approach is expected to carry the day as Worldcoin face ethical and privacy breaches.\n\nLearn more on Bitcoin Spark here:\n\nMore on Bitcoin Spark here:\n\nWebsite: https://bitcoinspark.org/\n\nBuy BTCS: https://network.bitcoinspark.org/register\n\nDisclaimer: This is a paid release.

This means that digital currencies can also be used to make zakat payments. How do Layer 2 solutions ensure security\u2753 They incorporate validity proofs, fraud proofs, and other cryptographic mechanisms to verify transactions processed off-chain are correct before committing data to Layer 1. These proofs provide security assurances so users can trust L2 solutions. What Is The Best Ethereum L2\u2753 The best Ethereum L2 solutions connect to Ethereum while offloading transactions off-chain. Projects like Polygon, Optimistic Rollups, Arbitrum, and zkSync provide faster and cheaper transactions, enhancing scalability. What are some key benefits of Layer 2 solutions\u2753 Layer 2 solutions provide faster transaction speeds, lower fees, and the ability to scale blockchain networks to handle higher throughput. They enhance usability without sacrificing decentralization. Additionally, L2 solutions enable use cases like micropayments which are infeasible on Layer 1 chains due to congestion and costs. Can DApps operate solely on Layer 2\u2753 In most cases DApps need to utilize both Layer 1 and Layer 2 solutions to optimize performance and costs. Purely operating on L2 can limit functionality in some cases. The combination of Layer 1 and 2 is optimal for DApps to balance capabilities and scalability. What rollup type is best \u2013 optimistic or ZK rollups\u2753 Both optimistic and ZK rollups have tradeoffs. Optimistic rollups have lower friction to get started but withdrawals take longer. ZK rollups offer faster finality but require more complex setup. The best solution depends on the specific use case priorities. How do users transfer assets between L1 and L2\u2753 Users can leverage bridging mechanisms to move assets between Layer 1 and Layer 2 chains. These bridges allow users to deposit to L2 from L1, use the funds on L2, and withdraw back to the L1 chain when needed. This provides flexibility to harness Layer 2 speeds and cost savings."
