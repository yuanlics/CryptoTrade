        "content": "Charles Guillemet, CTO at Ledger, reflects on the future of Ethereum and the protocol\u2019s potential to support Web3\u2019s mainstream adoption.\n\n\n\nThings to know:\n\n\n\n\u2013 Ethereum, the world\u2019s second-largest blockchain by market cap, recently underwent a significant software upgrade called The Merge, shifting from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake consensus.\n\n\n\n\u2013 While a successful transition, questions remain about Ethereum\u2019s scalability and readiness for the next stage of Web3\u2019s development.\n\n\n\n\u2013 This article delves into Ethereum\u2019s scaling challenges and evaluates its ability to meet mainstream adoption needs. It argues that, while a flawless scaling solution does not exist yet, Layer 2s including Optimistic and Validity Rollups hold the most potential for increased scalability with a good tradeoff for the blockchain trilemma.\n\n\n\n\u2013 More precisely, optimistic and Validity Rollups, using ZKP technology, will be key in shaping the future of Ethereum by enabling trustless, complex, and permissionless transactions at scale.\n\n\n\n\n\nScaling Ethereum: The Quest For A Solution\n\nEthereum, like many blockchains, currently faces limited transaction processing capacity. Despite supporting ETH transfers and thousands of DApps, increased usage has resulted in slower and more expensive transactions.\n\nTo mitigate high fees, this situation drove insecure design decisions such as off-chain centralized services for NFT marketplaces. The introduction of EIP-1559 improved fee estimation and incentivization, but hasn\u2019t significantly improved scalability. The scalability challenge is well understood within the popular blockchain trilemma of Scalability, Decentralization, and Security.\n\nThe blockchain trilemma asserts that it\u2019s not possible to simultaneously achieve three properties: decentralization, security, and scalability. Sacrifice on decentralization, it\u2019s much easier to build a scalable and secure system, as Web2 has already proven. Prioritize scalability by sacrificing on your consensus mechanism and you have a pointless, unsafe, decentralized blockchain. Solving the Blockchain trilemma is incredibly complex and has been an ongoing challenge for the last decade.\n\nBoosting Throughput: Multiple Approaches\n\nOver the years, many solutions have been addressed to solve the Ethereum blockchain trilemma. A popular suggestion is to build bigger blocks or blocks per second. While it may seem like a good idea, it intensifies demands on blockchain nodes and validators/miners for consensus, leading to increased centralization. It also slows reorgs, increasing security risks.\n\nAn alternative is creating a side-chain to reduce the load of the main chain, as seen with the Polygon network. This system involves security tradeoffs as it relies on a weaker consensus than Ethereum (less market cap). While it may suit specific use cases, it often leads to centralization and does not fully address Ethereum\u2019s scalability issues. And anyway, it\u2019s still far away from the tens of thousands requests needed to run a Visa-like system.\n\nLayer 2s & Sharding: Solutions To Ethereum\u2019s Scalability Challenges?\n\nSharding and Layer 2s are widely seen as the best options for Ethereum to scale while preserving the blockchain trilemma.\n\nOn the one hand, blockchain sharding has long been considered as the key to scalability in the blockchain world. It was the main feature of Eth2.0 in 2019 with the move to the BLS signature scheme, PoS consensus mechanism, and the implementation of eWASM. On the other hand, Layer 2s have seen rapid advancement through ongoing research in roll-up mechanisms. Let\u2019s explore the current state of these two competing approaches and what their future may hold.\n\nHow Does Blockchain Sharding Work?\n\nThe term sharding stems from database science where we partition horizontally a database into smaller, manageable pieces called shards. Each shard is a separate database that contains a data subset. Sharding is used to scale databases by distributing data and queries across multiple servers, allowing the database to handle a larger volume of data without needing a single, powerful server.\n\nThis idea of leveraging sharding on blockchains quickly became popular among developers. Blockchain sharding divides the network into smaller sub-networks called shards, and shards enable processing transactions in parallel. In a sharded blockchain, each shard is a separate chain that operates independently. This means that each node, miner/validator can focus on a given shard to create a local consensus. First, it allows transactions to be processed in parallel. Second, each shard has fewer transactions to manage. Sounds perfect, so what\u2019s the catch?\n\nSharding Challenges: Consensus, Cross-Shard Communication & Security\n\nWith blockchain sharding, it\u2019s not easy to define the overall consensus. What is the network\u2019s global consensus? Is it the union of each local consensus? How and where do you anchor these local consensus to create a global one that anyone can trust? Such questions are not easy to answer.\n\nAnother significant challenge to implementing sharding is cross-shard communication. When it comes to databases, you don\u2019t have this issue since data is split over different shards, enabling you to read or write them independently without real problems. When it comes to blockchain shards executing code, this is much more complex. Each shard must be able to run its own code, consult the state of a different shard, and execute code on another. This is not trivial.\n\nThis sharding difficulty also relates to the problem of security. This issue has been studied by experts and different sharding schemes have been considered prone to many new forms of attacks. First of all, it simply questions the consensus mechanism. If you have 10 shards, and miners are distributed per shard, taking over one shard is 10 times less costly than taking over the overall blockchain. Schematically, the 51% attack translates into 5.1%. One solution to this is to change the consensus mechanism from Proof of Work to Proof Of Stake. This was the primary motivation for Ethereum\u2019s transition to Proof Of Stake.\n\nOn the security front, the effect of The Merge has been largely debated. On the decentralization front, the updated Ethereum consensus favored centralization, given that token ownership determines network control.\n\nRegarding Ethereum\u2019s new consensus, several parameters incentivized centralization:\n\nRunning your Ethereum node is not straightforward, requiring resources and uptime. It simply prevents your wallet from implementing it and running on your laptop or even your mobile.\n\nThe 32 ETH threshold and the fact it\u2019s not possible to unstake until an unknown date created a Pooling and liquid staking where Lido and exchanges took most of the market. Today 4 actors are controlling more than 55% of the coins staked on the Ethereum blockchain (Lido 29.2%, Coinbase 13.1%, Kraken 7.6%, and Binance 6.2%).\n\nAll in all, blockchain sharding is an interesting idea for increasing scalability, but requires complex architecture, specifically when it comes to defining the overall consensus and implementing an efficient cross-shard protocol. A lot of work has been done toward these goals, but we\u2019re still far from implementing them and seizing the impacts on the blockchain trilemma.\n\nRollups to the rescue\n\nRollups compress multiple transactions into a single transaction for Ethereum to execute, enabling off-chain execution of many transactions with Ethereum\u2019s security for settlements. There are two main implementations of this idea:\n\nOptimistic Rollups, allowing users to issue fraud proofs in case of dispute\n\nZK-Rollups where the L2 network issues validity proofs.\n\nOptimistic Rollups and finality issue:\n\nOptimistic Rollups have been designed as the most EVM-looking Rollups. They are optimistic since they assume that users are not submitting fraudulent transactions, allowing direct blockchain writing.\n\nThere is a mechanism using fraud proofs that L2 validators can initialize to check the off-chain transactions made within a few days (7 days on Optimism). A valid fraud-proof identifies fraudulent steps in the transaction process, leading to the reversal of the transaction and a penalty for the approving validator. This improves transaction throughput while preserving Ethereum\u2019s mainchain security.\n\nHowever, Optimistic Rollups bring a new challenge: finality. With blockchains, confirmed transactions are considered permanent and irreversible, but this depends on the consensus mechanism. For instance, PoW chains consider transactions final when the probability of a reorg is low, and Bitcoin transactions are final after 6 confirmations. With optimistic rollups, transactions can be reversed after several days, which creates a finality challenge and a different tradeoff.\n\nAnother kind of rollup: ZK-Rollups\n\nZK-Rollups, named for their use of Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) technology such as SNARKs or STARKs, are another type of Rollup. Since the Zero-knowledge property is not actually useful, calling them Validity Rollups could be more accurate.\n\nThe Rollup executes a batch of transactions and produces a validity proof, verified by a smart contract on Ethereum blockchain, that confirms the final outcome of the transactions. The cryptographic proof is generated using Zero Knowledge cryptographic primitives.\n\nMore broadly, zero-knowledge proofs allow one party (verifier) to demonstrate possession of certain information to another party (verifier) without revealing the actual information. The verifier can be confident in the truth of the verifier\u2019s statement without learning its content.\n\nOriginally designed for confidentiality, ZKRollups use zero-knowledge proofs for a very different purpose: compression and trusted computing. The two leading zero-knowledge technologies are zk-STARKs (stands for a zero-knowledge scalable transparent argument of knowledge) and zk-SNARKs (stands for a zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive argument of knowledge).\n\nData availability problem for L2:\n\nAs we\u2019ve seen, ZKP technologies ensure the validity of the L2 state, but the proof alone doesn\u2019t provide access to the state. To increase throughput, execution is moved off-chain, but data must still be readily accessible for reconstruction. To achieve this, transactional data is submitted as calldata on Ethereum to ensure that the data is available for future reconstruction. This data could also be stored in trusted decentralized storage such as IPFS or Arweave allowing anyone to reconstruct the L2 and leveraging the inner incentives of decentralized storage.\n\nIt would be even better to have the capability to store this data on-chain, but the data only serves to reconstruct the state/truth of the L2 and isn\u2019t executed, making it an inefficient and expensive use of blockchain capacity.\n\nTo address this hurdle, Ethereum devs proposed two EIPs: EIP-4488 and EIP-4844 (good luck avoiding confusion). The first lowers the gas cost for calldata while the second creates a new transaction type for L2 data storage. This data is immutable and read-only, and cannot be accessed by the EVM and therefore cannot be executed.\n\nThese EIPs are exactly where the ZKRollup roadmap meets the Execution Sharding roadmap, both proposing the same concept for different purposes. EIP-4488 aims to store essential L2 data while EIP-4844, also known as Proto-Danksharding, is a step towards implementing Danksharding and execution sharding.\n\nDanksharding:\n\nDanksharding involves dividing large datasets into smaller parts for separation and processing, often in parallel. This method is used in big data and AI fields where training sets can be very large.\n\nProto-danksharding (EIP-4844) does not implement sharding but offers cheaper calldata storage that could be sharded. This cheaper calldata storage will greatly improve scalability for Ethereum on L2, potentially making sharding redundant.\n\nProto-danksharding:\n\nWith Proto-danksharding, the Ethereum blockchain will have non-scalable computation and scalable data. And ZkRollups essentially convert this scalable data and non-scalable but trusted computation into scalable computation.\n\nZKRollups in the blockchain trilemma:\n\nZKRollups have strong scalability benefits without changing underlying blockchain properties. To verify Zero-Knowledge proof on-chain is the main requirement, while data availability can be implemented off-chain. In the long run, one can expect that Layer-1s will become simple, secure, hopefully decentralized while Layer-2s will provide scalability.\n\nWhere\u2019s the catch?\n\nL2 can indeed scale a lot. Nonetheless, to be settled on-chain (on L1), one needs to produce a proof of validity for the overall state of the L2, causing centralization issues. Currently, L2 designs have only one prover, meaning that they can censor your transactions. They couldn\u2019t really freeze your L1 assets since native bridges are built. The research is ongoing to tackle this challenge, allowing other parties to be able to emit proofs, but some difficult questions remain for the arbitration between these proofs. In all cases this is an important problem to solve for the future.\n\nStarknet has identified this as an important topic on the roadmap, while Arbitrum divides responsibility between the sequencer inbox and the delayed inbox to ensure funds can be retrieved in case of censorship.\n\nClosing Thoughts\n\nAs we\u2019ve examined, scalability can come at a cost to security and decentralization, while Layer 2 solutions are seen as the most promising ways to increase scalability without compromising the other aspects of the blockchain trilemma.\n\nOptimistic and Validity Rollups, using ZKP technology, will be vital in shaping the future of Ethereum by enabling trustless, complex, and permissionless transactions at scale. Validity Rollups have a significant advantage over Optimistic Rollups: short finality. Ethereum\u2019s roadmap has recently shifted to support these rollups at the blockchain level.\n\nThe future of blockchain scalability includes complex DApps running on Layer 2s (or recursive rollups), allowing virtually infinite scalability, with decentralized and secure layer-1 being given. In the long-term, Layer 1 could become settlement layers, with the complexity of DApps moved to Layer 2s."

        "content": "An audited version of the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s ERC-4337 account abstraction standard is now available on Ethereum mainnet.\n\nThe standard has been implemented through the smart contract EntryPoint, which has been running for a few weeks already \u2014 and is designed to change how users interact with wallet services.\n\nMost of Ethereum\u2019s existing wallets are externally owned accounts (EOA). The list, which makes up a majority of wallets now in the Ethereum ecosystem, includes providers like MetaMask and imToken.\n\nAnd it even extends to hardware wallets such as Ledger Nano, where only one key controls an account \u2014 meaning that if its key is compromised or lost, any tokens within the wallet would be, too.\n\nWith account abstraction, the idea would be to make the account flexible to match users needs, according to Yoav Weiss, a security fellow at the Ethereum Foundation.\n\nThe foundation is a nonprofit dedicated to supporting the development of the Ethereum ecosystem, including its native token, ether (ETH).\n\n\u201cFor some users, this may simply mean getting the user experience of a bank \u2014 where someone can always help recover your bank account even if you lose your password,\u201d Weiss, an author of the ERC-4337 proposal, told Blockworks. \u201cFor more sophisticated users, it could mean adding more controls or features to your account.\u201d\n\nAn example? Adding two-factor authentication to spend more than $5,000 dollars, Weiss said. The measure also allows users to use the cryptographic signature of their choosing, and it also authorizes transactions securely through cell phones.\n\nUnlike EOAs, account abstraction enables users to use smart contract wallets with arbitrary verification logic.\n\n\u201cSo now, users don\u2019t need to think about writing down 12 words on a piece of paper, but instead, they are able to add and remove devices and include recovery options with a friend or a lawyer,\u201d Weiss said.\n\nImplementing an ERC-4337 standard\n\nAccount abstraction has been in the works for over nine years. It\u2019s been difficult to reach a consensus and change an entire protocol to support it.\n\n\u201cWe needed to better understand security and better understand usability, but you can\u2019t [take] action for something that requires a protocol change because there is no input, and that\u2019s where ERC-4337 comes in,\u201d Weiss said.\n\nERC \u2014 short for Ethereum request for comment \u2014 is an opt-in standard that no one is obligated to use. Instead of changing consensus rules, ERC ensures everyone agrees to a standard before they begin using it on-chain.\n\nOne prevalent example: the ERC-20 token standard. ERC-20 doesn\u2019t alter Ethereum at its protocol level. But, because developers have agreed tokens should follow ERC-20 rules, it has set a standard.\n\n\u201cHaving a standard creates an ecosystem,\u201d Weiss said. \u201cAnd what ERC-4337 does is it will create a standard for account abstraction.\u201d\n\nExisting products such as Gnosis Safe and Argent have already implemented features such as social recovery. But in order to maintain them, they would have to connect to a centralized relayer.\n\nIf a centralized relayer is attacked, users would not be able to access their accounts.\n\nERC-4337 will introduce a new mempool for user operations.\n\nThis mempool is serviced by \u201cbundlers\u201d \u2014 similar to validators and miners \u2014 but on an accounts function level. So rather than submitting a transaction, a user would submit a user operation to the mempool, and bundlers will take it from the mempool and include it in blocks on Ethereum or any other EVM chain, Weiss said.\n\nOne of the first protocols to comply with the ERC-4337 standard for bundlers is Stackup.\n\n\u201cWe have a test for bundlers to make sure they are ready, and stackup was one of the first ones to be ready,\u201d Weiss said.\n\nThe company will allow developers to build customized Web3 transaction flows and wallets using the latest ERC-4337 smart contract.\n\n\u201cDevelopers won\u2019t need to think about how each blockchain works, the wallet only needs to support ERC-4337, and it can be deployed and used on any EVM chain,\u201d Weiss said.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "Repeated outages of one of the most popular blockchains believed to have the potential to dethrone the Ethereum network sparked a conversation among community members about the future of those carrying the burden of being called an \u201cEthereum killer.\u201d\n\nA member of a cryptocurrency forum on Reddit opened a conversation on Ethereum killers and questioned their ability to succeed in the current crypto space. According to the community member, those dubbed as Ethereum killers are unlikely to succeed because they do not get the same adoption that Ethereum does.\n\nIn addition, the community member argued that even if a chain becomes faster than Ethereum, the market capitalization of Ether (ETH) is very high. Therefore, the crypto user believes that \u201cno ETH killer will actually kill ETH.\u201d\n\nVarious members of the community chimed in and gave their thoughts on the issue. From pointing out that the so-called ETH killers did not deliver on promises to suggesting dropping the term \u201cETH killer\u201d altogether, crypto community members discussed the future of ETH killers.\n\nCommunity member commenting on the topic. Source: Reddit\n\nOne community member argued that \u201cthere\u2019s no such thing as an Ethereum killer.\u201d The Reddit user believes that there\u2019s only Ethereum, and then there\u2019s the rest of the layer-1 networks that fight for the remaining market share of the layer-1 market.\n\nRedditor comparing 2018 to the recent cycle. Source: Reddit\n\nOne Redditor argued that the term ETH killer should be dropped because at this point, \u201cETH has become entrenched.\u201d The community member believes that while ETH can still be dethroned, it cannot be killed. \u201cAt that stage, the whole market would have to be wiped out which is also a statistical unlikelihood,\u201d they wrote.\n\nRelated: Solana Labs co-founder: We don\u2019t want to kill \u2018beautiful\u2019 Ethereum\n\nWhile many of the arguments are pro-Ethereum, some still believe that things can still go south for the network. A community member said that the idea that ETH \u201cwill never fail is ridiculous.\u201d The Reddit user argued that ETH\u2019s adoption doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s a done deal, as many argued that the space is still in its early stages. They added:\n\n\u201cWe are either early and it\u2019s way too premature to call absolute certainties or it\u2019s done and we are no longer early.\u201d\n\nAs others contributed serious arguments to the discussion, some joined in to add a touch of humor to the somehow heated online debate. One community member posted, \u201cEthereum is the true Ethereum killer killer,\u201d while another said, \u201cWhat doesn\u2019t kill ETH makes ETH stronger.\u201d\n\nThe discussion came a few days after Solana, one of the most recognized Ethereum killer blockchains, suffered another issue on its network. On Feb. 25, Solana faced a slowdown in block production, leading to a network restart. The incident led to various disruptions in user transactions. The issue also sparked outrage on Twitter, with some mocking the network and calling it a \u201ctransaction killer.\u201d"

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nEthereum\u2019s eagerly anticipated Shanghai upgrade, which will enable the withdrawal of staked ETH, will likely occur in the first two weeks of April, the network\u2019s core developers determined on a call Thursday.\n\nThough the upgrade had been firmly slated for a March release, some Ethereum developers began doubting that timeline would stick as early as January, as previously reported by Decrypt.\n\nEthereum\u2019s developers now plan to launch the Goerli testnet, essentially a comprehensive dress rehearsal of the Shanghai upgrade, on or around March 14. About a month later, should everything proceed smoothly, the actual Shanghai software update will go live mid-April.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe exact timing of Shanghai\u2019s implementation has been particularly closely watched due to the upgrade\u2019s seismic financial implications. Ever since Ethereum began transitioning to a proof-of-stake model\u2014in which Ethereum transactions are validated by users who have staked ETH with the network\u2014those same users have accumulated rewards for their network participation in the form of newly generated ETH. Since ETH staking began in December 2020, a whopping $28.7 billion worth of ETH (and counting) has been deposited with Ethereum. That\u2019s about 14.5% of all ETH in circulation.\n\nThose funds and the rewards they\u2019ve spawned, however, are not yet available for withdrawal. Making it possible for Ethereum users to withdraw their staked ETH is the core component of Shanghai.\n\nBy far the largest entities currently staking with Ethereum are intermediary staking services like Lido and crypto exchanges such as Coinbase, Kraken, and Binance. Those four companies, which pool together customers\u2019 ETH to stake them and earn passive rewards, currently account for 56% of all ETH staked with the network, according to Dune Analytics.\n\nThose firms\u2014many of which have sagged in the current crypto winter\u2014have a clear incentive to start churning out staked ETH rewards to customers and skimming fees off the top. JP Morgan analysts predicted in January that the Shanghai upgrade alone could \u201cusher in a new era\u201d for struggling crypto exchange Coinbase. The investment bank estimates that staking could earn Coinbase between $225 million and $545 million in revenue per year.\n\nWith so much riding on the upgrade, Ethereum\u2019s core developers have scrambled to get Shanghai out the door as quickly as possible. The network\u2019s developers removed other anticipated and much-need improvements to the Ethereum network from Shanghai to hasten its release, and even avoided adding minor technical tweaks to Ethereum\u2019s encoding methods to the upgrade, in a decision that could create technical debt for the network in years to come.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt feels like we\u2019re not thinking about the long-term health of Ethereum,\u201d said core developer Micah Zoltu, who protested those decisions, during a developers\u2019 meeting on the subject in January. \u201cWe\u2019re thinking, \u2018How do we do what the public wants, today?\u2019\u201d\n\nSacrifices made to speed up Shanghai\u2019s release, however, may have been in vain\u2014now that the upgrade is slipping, even if slightly, from its original release schedule."

        "content": "Ethereum developer Yoav Weiss announced ERC-4337, or \u201csmart accounts,\u201d at WalletCon in Denver, Colorado, on March 1.\n\nERC-4337 (formerly EIP-4337) is also known as account abstraction. It provides a basis for various features such as account recovery and group-access wallets. Other possible applications include bundled and sponsored transactions for reduced transaction fees.\n\nIt will also allow platforms to provide crypto services without requiring users to set up a traditional wallet and manually store their seed phrase or private key. Account abstraction stores keys locally on the user\u2019s hardware security module (HSM) \u2060\u2014 not with any service provider \u2060\u2014 and therefore is as secure as a self-custodied crypto wallet.\n\nERC-4337 was added to Ethereum through a smart contract, which was introduced without forking the entire blockchain. The relevant smart contract was deployed on Feb. 28, several hours before the feature was officially announced.\n\nThe feature can also be introduced on any EVM-compatible blockchain, including BNB Smart Chain (BNB), Polygon (MATIC), Avalanche (AVAX), and many others.\n\nERC-4337 was notably endorsed by Visa last December. The company recognized account abstraction as a possible way for users to auto-schedule crypto payments.\n\nOther, more extensive Ethereum upgrades are also underway. The blockchain is preparing for its Shanghai upgrade, allowing validators to withdraw staked ETH. That feature was activated on a testnet this week and should be fully introduced this month."

        "title": "How to Stake Ethereum With Liquid Staking - Unchained - Unchained",
        "content": "Discover the easy and secure way to stake Ethereum and earn rewards while supporting the network\u2019s security.\n\nIn 2022, the Ethereum blockchain transitioned from proof of work to proof of stake.\n\nProof of stake is common in crypto and involves validators \u201cstaking\u201d \u2014 or depositing \u2014 their cryptocurrency on a blockchain to help secure the network. In return, they\u2019re eligible to receive a share of newly minted coins. The sticking point in Ethereum, however, is that each individual can only deposit Ethereum tokens (ETH) in 32-ETH increments (around $52,000 as of February 2023) to participate. That is a lot of capital to lock up indefinitely!\n\nThat\u2019s where liquid staking comes in. Essentially, liquid staking services give you derivative tokens in exchange for your ETH. The service stakes the ETH on your behalf and generates a yield; it takes a percentage of any rewards as a commission. In the meantime, you can use the derivative tokens, which simulate ETH, to generate additional income through decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. Thus, you have the best of both worlds. Or, you might say, you can have your stake and ETH it too!\n\nStep 1: Choose Your Liquid Staking Platform\n\nLiquid staking is popular. Here are the most-used liquid staking platforms:\n\nName of Platform Tokens APR* Market Share** Lido stETH 4.8% 75% Coinbase cbETH 3.89% 16% Rocket Pool rETH 7.4% or 4.86% 5.5% Stakewise sETH2, reTH 5.68% 1.3% Frax Finance frxETH, sfrxETH 7.39% 1.1%\n\n*Annual Percentage Rate: As of Monday, Feb. 6. Note that these values change frequently.\n\n**Sourced from Dune Analytics and @ThorHartvigsen\n\nLido : Built by Ethereum veterans, Lido has become by far the most popular liquid staking platform, capturing nearly 75% of the market. While its liquidity is an attractive feature, its popularity poses centralization risks . Lido\u2019s stETH token tracks ETH 1:1 and offers an APR of 4.8% before charging a relatively standard commission of 10% on your earnings. (For example, if you stake 100 ETH, you can hypothetically earn 4.8 ETH and pay 0.48 ETH in commission for a net yield of 4.32 ETH. )\n\nCoinbase : As the largest crypto exchange, it is little surprise that Coinbase quickly shot up to second position despite being a newer entrant into liquid ETH staking. It offers the lowest reward (3.89% APR) and the highest commission (25%) on this list. Moreover, unlike many competitors, it takes custody of users\u2019 private keys during the staking process. Despite these issues for individuals, Coinbase is well-placed to capitalize on any increase in institutional capital in the space.\n\nRocket Pool : The ability for users to run their own nodes makes Rocket Pool arguably the most decentralized option on this list. For those willing to put up 16 ETH, it offers a high 7.4% APR, but you can also get started with just 0.01 ETH for a 4.86% APR. At 15%, its commission is on the higher side.\n\nStakewise : What distinguishes Stakewise is its dual-token model. It offers sETH in exchange for the staked token and rETH for staking rewards. The model has interesting applications, such as easily utilizing your rewards without affecting the principal, but the accompanying complexity is often challenging for new users. It offers 5.68% APR with a 10% commission.\n\nFrax Finance: Frax has recently enjoyed rapid growth thanks to its high APR (7.39%). The catch? It uses a complicated mechanism that newcomers to DeFi might find challenging. The process also involves two tokens \u2014 users first need to deposit ETH to mint the stablecoin frxETH and then swap it for sfrxETH.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 2: Set Up Your Ethereum Wallet\n\nOnce you\u2019ve zeroed in on your choice of platform, the next step is hooking up an Ethereum wallet. If you don\u2019t have one yet, we recommend MetaMask, the most widely used Ethereum wallet in the world (30 million users as of March 2022), which works across both smartphones and home computers.\n\nTo get started, download the app for Android, iOS, or Chrome, and follow the instructions to set up an account. Then load up your wallet with some ETH by pressing \u201cBuy ETH\u201d on the home screen of your wallet.\n\nSource\n\nThis will open a screen where you must select your region, the token you wish to buy (select Ethereum), the amount, and your payment method, which will vary depending on where you live. After you fill in these details, you will be asked to select a provider. If you have never used one, you must complete a KYC process.\n\nUpon completing the transaction, your MetaMask wallet should display an updated balance.\n\nNow let\u2019s get to the good part.\n\nStep 3: Use Liquid Staking to Put Your ETH to Work\n\nFor this article, we will be completing the process with Lido. Even if you choose a different provider, you should find the steps below helpful.\n\na) Go to the Ethereum Section of the Lido website, and click \u201cStake Ethereum.\u201d\n\nb) Go to \u201cConnect Wallet\u201d and select your wallet. For this article, we\u2019ll assume it\u2019s MetaMask.\n\nc) Your wallet will prompt you to connect to the Lido website. Select your wallet and click \u201cNext.\u201d\n\nd) Select the amount of ETH you want to stake and click \u201cSubmit.\u201d (Note: You will have to keep a small amount of ETH to cover gas fees.)\n\ne) Click \u201cConfirm.\u201d The confirmation screen should appear after a few seconds.\n\nSuccess!\n\nStep 4: Use Your Liquid Tokens\n\nIf you complete these transactions, you can put these tokens to work and earn an additional yield, which can exceed 4% APR. There are various DeFi applications for your liquid tokens, such as using them as collateral to get loans on Aave or lending them on Maker. If the exchange rate for your liquid token suddenly shoots up in value, you can even sell it, although you\u2019d give up your claim on the staked ETH and lose your deposit. According to Lido, the most popular way of utilizing stETH is by providing liquidity on Curve. You can read more about possible use cases here.\n\nStep 5: Exchange Your Liquid Tokens for ETH\n\nRedeeming your ETH is usually a straightforward process. Aside from Lido, the other platforms host a mechanism to convert your liquid token back into ETH. Lido recommends you do the exchange on Curve or Balancer. Remember that the amount you get depends on the exchange rate!\n\nConclusion\n\nIf you are bullish on Ethereum, liquid staking seems like a no-brainer. It allows you to get paid while you wait for the price to (perhaps) increase. However, there are several complexities here to consider. For instance, the exchange rate of your liquidity token could increase or decrease significantly. Moreover, these are also largely unregulated markets, so you need to carefully study the underlying structure and the team before committing significant amounts of your capital."

        "content": "What does Ethereum need to be better? According to its founder, it\u2019s all about the user experience. And on February 28th, Vitalik Buterin talked about the many issues in the Ethereum network that need to be fixed before truly solving that particular one.\n\nVitalik explained in his blog that he faced many inconveniences while using the Ethereum network to process payments due to high transaction fees, which sometimes ended up costing more than the product he wanted to pay for.\n\nVitalik\u2019s Issues with ETH Date Back to 2021\n\nVitalik recalled that his troubles with Ethereum payments date back to 2021 when he visited Argentina and tried to pay for tea. To his surprise, the 0.003 ETH transaction was not accepted, perhaps because it was below the exchange\u2019s minimum deposit of 0.01 ETH.\n\nDespite this, Vitalik decided to send the 0.007 ETH needed to complete this transaction. This represented a three-fold overpayment of the product\u2019s price, but he did not give importance to that fee and chose to think about it as a simple tip, realizing that it was an error that needed to be worked on to improve the user experience.\n\nIn 2022, he learned that things didn\u2019t change that much. Vitalik tried to pay for tea again at another place. Gas fees prevented him from using his ETH this time, as the transaction was not processed because the receiving contract \u201crequired extra gas to process the transfer.\u201d\n\nThose bad experiences served as a lesson for him to understand that \u201csimple-and-robust UIs are better than fancy-and-sleek ones.\u201d He also learned that many users do not even know what gas limits they need to process their transactions, so default values should be improved.\n\nPayment Delays Can Be Irritating for Many Users\n\nVitalik also complained about the \u201csurprisingly long time delay between my transactions,\u201d which has been irritating, as there is always the doubt of who is to blame when transactions are not confirmed quickly.\n\n\u201cSometimes, a transaction would get accepted in a few seconds, but other times, it would take minutes or even hours.\u201d\n\nHe added that although the team has worked to improve these issues with the EIP-1559 update, which ensures that most transactions are accepted in the next block, there is always the risk of things not working perfectly because \u201coutliers still remain.\u201d\n\nFor example, if many people make transactions at the same time, there is a risk that the network will experience a spike in fees, resulting in the rejection of many transactions. This problem can cause significant money losses even for the most expert users, as \u201cwallet UIs suck at showing this.\u201d\n\nBrave wallet deployed a workaround for this problem. The team listened to his suggestions and increased the maximum base fee from 12.5% to 33%, improving both the interface and the user experience.\n\nButerin ended his statement by indicating that, especially in Southern countries, many people choose centralized solutions instead of decentralized alternatives because of how outdated the applications are regarding user experience.\n\nAlthough the Ethereum Merge helped speed up the average time to process transactions, there is still a lot to correct to achieve the global adoption that crypto enthusiasts dream of."

        "content": "The price of Ethereum\u2019s native token, Ether (ETH), shows a growing conflict among traders about the market direction for March. This uncertainty has resulted in ETH price consolidating inside a narrow sideways range between $1,600 and $1,700 since Feb. 15.\n\n25% ETH price correction on the table in March\n\nThe uncertainty stems from Ethereum\u2019s long-awaited Shanghai upgrade going live sometime in March.\n\nSeveral analysts predict the upgrade, which will enable stakers to withdraw their vested tokens from Ethereum\u2019s proof-of-stake (PoS) smart contract, will trigger a short-term sell-off event.\n\nThe Ethereum PoS smart contract has attracted more than 17.4 million ETH (~$28.35 billion at the current exchange rate) since its introduction in December 2020, per Etherscan.\n\nIn addition, Ether is finding it difficult to break above the technical resistance range. The Ethereum token has attempted to flip the $1,650\u20131,700 area to support multiple times since August 2022, as shown by the red bar in the chart below.\n\nETH/USD daily price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nInterestingly, each failed breakout attempt has resulted in a strong pullback toward a common support line \u2014 a multimonth ascending trendline (black).\n\nTherefore, if history is any indication, ETH\u2019s next correction could potentially land its price near $1,250, down 25% from the current levels. Conversely, a break above $1,650\u20131,700 positions ETH for the $1,925\u20132,000 range (purple) as its next upside target.\n\nFuture ETH selloffs will be limited \u2014 data trackers\n\nFrom an on-chain perspective, an extended Ether price crash appears less likely.\n\nNotably, there\u2019s been a massive drop in ETH supplies on exchanges since September 2022 \u2014 falling from around 30% to 11%. Theoretically, this reduces the immediate sell pressure as capital moves to the sidelines.\n\n\u201cThe trend in crypto, particularly since September, has been quickly moving self-custody,\u201d Santiment noted, adding:\n\n\u201cThis trend picked up after the FTX collapse. Regardless, with both BTC and ETH around 5-year low exchange supplies, future sell-offs will be limited.\u201c\n\nIn addition, data analytics firm CryptoQuant has reached a similar conclusion about potential Ether selloffs in the future, primarily in the wake of the Shanghai hard fork.\n\nRelated: 3 tips for trading Ethereum this year\n\nCryptoQuant notes that 60% of the staked ETH supply \u2014 about 10.3 million ETH \u2014 is currently at a loss. Meanwhile, Lido DAO, the largest Ethereum staking provider, holds 30% of all staked ETH at an average loss of $1,000, or 24%.\n\n\u201cTypically, selling pressure arises when participants have extreme profits, which is not the case for staked ETH currently,\u201c CryptoQuant wrote:\n\n\u201cAdditionally, the most profitable staked ETH was staked less than a year ago and has not seen significant profit-taking events in the past.\u201c\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "The price of Ether (ETH) declined 9.8% between Feb. 19 and Feb. 25 after the price resistance at $1,725 proved stronger than expected. Still, the correction was insufficient to break the six-week-long ascending channel and did not cause Ether derivatives metrics to turn bearish.\n\nEther (ETH) price index in USD, 1-day. Source: TradingView\n\nEther\u2019s price resilience can be partially explained by the operational failure of some of its smart contract blockchain competitors. For instance, Solana (SOL) faced a 20-hour-long outage on Feb. 25, which was only resolved after a network upgrade coordinated by validators. The network restart also involved purging some of the latest slots, although Solana developers said that \"no confirmed user transactions were rolled back or impacted.\"\n\nNEM (XEM) experienced a \u201cchain halt\u201d on Feb. 27 that lasted for 15 hours, causing multiple exchanges to halt deposits and withdrawals, and developers promised to release an update to prevent further misbehavior. Curiously, the latest post from the official NEM account on Twitter, excluding a Merry Christmas greeting, was a \u201cPlease Stand By\u201d image posted in July.\n\nThe regulatory environment remains shady for cryptocurrencies, and the latest victims were global payment processing companies Visa and Mastercard. According to a Feb. 28 Reuters report, the firms are delaying the launch of new partnerships with crypto companies until market conditions improve and a more transparent regulatory framework is established.\n\nIn more positive news, Ethereum's Sepolia testnet was successfully hard forked on Feb. 28 in preparation for the Shanghai upgrade. The much-anticipated mainnet update expected for March should finally allow validators to withdraw their staked Ether from the Beacon Chain. Developers are now prepping the Goerli testnet to enter a similar stage.\n\nLet's look at Ether derivatives data to understand if the $1,560 support retest on Feb. 25 has impacted crypto investors' sentiment.\n\nETH futures show increased demand for leverage longs\n\nThe annualized two-month futures premium should trade between 5% and 10% in healthy markets to cover costs and associated risks. However, when the contract trades at a discount (backwardation) versus traditional spot markets, it shows a lack of confidence from traders and is deemed a bearish indicator.\n\nEther 2-month futures annualized premium. Source: Laevitas\n\nThe chart above shows that derivatives traders became slightly bullish as the Ether futures premium (on average) flirted with the 5% threshold on Feb. 26. More importantly, it shows resilience even as Ether price declined by nearly 10% between Feb. 19 and Feb. 25.\n\nThe increased demand for leverage longs (bulls) does not necessarily translate to an expectation of positive price action. Consequently, traders should analyze Ether\u2019s options markets to understand how whales and market makers are pricing the odds of future price movements.\n\nOptions risk metrics show resilience despite a 10% price slide\n\nThe 25% delta skew is a telling sign when market makers and arbitrage desks are overcharging for upside or downside protection.\n\nIn bear markets, options investors give higher odds for a price dump, causing the skew indicator to rise above 10%. On the other hand, bullish markets tend to drive the skew metric below -10%, meaning the bearish put options are in less demand.\n\nRelated: Vitalik Buterin says 'more still needs to be done' over high Ethereum txn fees\n\nEther 60-day options 25% delta skew: Source: Laevitas\n\nThe delta skew flirted with the bearish 9% level on Feb. 27, signaling stress from professional traders. However, the situation improved on Feb. 28 as the index moved to 5 \u2014 indicating a similar upside and downside risk appetite.\n\nIt makes sense for fundamental analysts to avoid adding bullish positions ahead of the Shanghai upgrade, especially since Ethereum developers have a history of delaying significant network changes.\n\nDespite the range of concerning factors, options and futures markets signal that pro traders are conservatively bullish and trust that the ascending pattern will hold. From a technical analysis standpoint, investors appear to believe that the bullish trend will continue unless Ether breaks below the channel support at $1,520.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "For years, Bitcoiners have repeated the mantra \u201cbe your own bank.\u201d But in truth, storing any type of crypto in a wallet has been a lot closer to stuffing cash under your mattress than to a complex financial institution like a bank.\n\nAdmittedly, it\u2019s an improvement in that crypto can be transferred across the globe in minutes and it\u2019s secured with cryptography \u2014 but it\u2019s also a lot less user-friendly than a bank and doesn\u2019t offer anywhere near as many features.\n\nYour crypto could be stolen in a $5 wrench attack. You could lose the seed phrase and your funds forever. And that\u2019s if you were technically minded enough to even figure out the complicated process of setting up a wallet in the first place.\n\nThat\u2019s all set to change with the surprise announcement at WalletCon in Denver this week of \u201csmart accounts,\u201d also known as \u201caccount abstraction,\u201d on Ethereum \u2014 and every other chain compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (the EVM is the software responsible for executing Ethereum-based smart contracts).\n\n\n\nChains that can now take advantage of smart accounts include Polygon, Optimism, Arbitrum, BNB Smart Chain, Avalanche and Gnosis Chain.\n\nYears in the making, the new ERC-4337 standard transforms a crypto wallet into something with all the features of a real bank.\n\n\u201cIt gives you the same features a bank would without having to trust a bank,\u201d says Ethereum Foundation security researcher Yoav Weiss, who was one of the co-authors of the Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) alongside Vitalik Buterin.\n\n\n\n\u201cAccount abstraction is a way to appeal to the next billion users.\u201d\n\nThe benefits include two-factor authentication, signing transactions on your phone, the setting of monthly spending limits on an account, the use of session keys to play blockchain games without constantly having to approve transactions, decentralized recovery of wallets; smart accounts can be configured to autopay bills and subscriptions \u2014 the list goes on.\n\n\n\nLedger co-founder Nicolas Bacca tells Magazine he\u2019s hugely impressed with the technology\u2019s potential.\n\n\u201cAccount abstraction will completely change the crypto user experience,\u201d he says.\n\nTimeline of Account Abstraction (Yoav Weiss)\n\nWhat does account abstraction mean?\n\nAccount abstraction is a complicated technical term for something that is actually incredibly user-friendly. Weiss and zkSync hope to replace it with the more descriptive term \u201csmart accounts.\u201d\n\n\u201cAccount abstraction is a confusing term,\u201d says Weiss. \u201cThe accounts are abstracted from the network; they are not abstracted from the user. The user is using a very concrete wallet that does very specific things. From the user\u2019s perspective, it\u2019s not account abstraction \u2014 it\u2019s more like using a smart account.\u201d\n\n\n\nAlex Jupiter, senior product manager at MetaMask, says \u201caccount abstraction\u201d means different things to different developers.\n\n\n\nIn part, that\u2019s due to the fact that non-EVM scaling solutions, including StarkWare and zkSync, have implemented a modified version of ERC-4337 in the protocol itself, while Ethereum implements the standard on top of it.\n\n\n\n\u201cI would\u2019t say Ethereum came up with a workaround that\u2019s not quite as good,\u201d Weiss explains. \u201cWe came up with a standard that can work everywhere, focusing on interoperability and defragmentation, and it can be implemented more efficiently at the protocol level, for example, by rollups.\u201d\n\n\n\nA variety of EIPs to add smart accounts to the protocol have been suggested but would have required a hard fork and did not get enough support, as they\u2019d take attention away from more important upgrades, such as the Merge.\n\nThe native implementations upgrade all user accounts to smart accounts, while Ethereum\u2019s new standard requires users to set up a new account. Weiss explains there will inevitably be a hard fork in future to enable the upgrading of all accounts, but \u201cit\u2019ll take a long time to get there.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nAccount abstraction is extremely powerful.\n\n\n\nHere are a few of the things you can do to make the most of it: pic.twitter.com/jWavGLzBhE \u2014 John Rising (@johnrising_) February 25, 2023\n\nWhat are the benefits of smart accounts?\n\nOne of the biggest benefits for adoption is that it allows new users to onboard into the decentralized world of crypto without ever having to worry about complicated seed phrases or understand the technical process of setting up a wallet.\n\n\n\nThey can simply open a smart account via a smartphone app using a fingerprint or face scanner.\n\nWhile there are plenty of crypto wallets currently available as smartphone apps, they come with numerous security risks and are unsuitable for holding larger amounts of cryptocurrency due to the risk of hacks. But because smart accounts enable the cryptographic keys to be stored on the phone\u2019s hardware security module, phone wallets can now be almost as safe as a hardware wallet.\n\nMagazine tries out the onboarding process for noobs at StarkWare Sessions in Tel Aviv, Israel where gaming wallet Cartridge is handing out limited edition Briq NFTs.\n\n\n\nThe whole process takes less than 30 seconds and is completely intuitive. Users scan a QR code, choose a username, and then create a passkey using the phone\u2019s fingerprint scanner.\n\nExisting crypto users will need to reconceptualize what they thought a crypto wallet was and how to access it. The noncustodial Cartridge Controller is actually a web-based wallet that interacts with StarkNet. Instead of private keys, it makes use of Android or Apple \u201cPasskeys,\u201d which are both based on the WebAuthn standard, an intiative to standardize user authentication for web apps using public-key crytography.\n\nThe Cartridge stand at StarkWare Sessions. Source: Twitter\n\nWhile a web wallet sounds like a scary proposition to long-term crypto users, Bacca is impressed with Cartridge\u2019s implementation and says Ledger is building a similar web-based wallet that he says is secure thanks to WebAuthn.\n\nUsing a smartphone as a hardware wallet\n\nThere are a couple of catches to using a smartphone as a hardware wallet. The larger screen on a smartphone still presents a security risk, as it can be hacked to trick users into approving transactions.\n\n\n\nHowever, this risk can be mitigated, as smart accounts enable users to set permissions requiring two-factor authentication for higher value transactions (using a hardware wallet, for example) or to set a daily, monthly or yearly spending limit from the account.\n\nBacca says Ledger is experimenting with this functionality now. \u201cSo, for example, you could use your phone when you only want to do a small purchase or you could use your hardware wallet when you want to do a bigger purchase, and this can be scripted in the account,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are prototyping a web application for that.\u201d\n\n\n\nA bigger problem for using a smartphone wallet on Ethereum is that the security module uses a different cryptographic signing system (elliptic curve) than crypto. With smart accounts, the two systems can finally talk to each other, but it requires a lot of work and a lot of gas.\n\nMotty Lavie, founder of StarkNet\u2019s smartphone-based Braavos Wallet, explains it takes 240,000 computational steps to take advantage of the smartphone security module:\n\n\n\n\u201cOn Ethereum, to implement that, each transaction would be very, very costly. On StarkNet, this is a marginal cost that\u2019ll add a few cents to the transaction, which makes it viable.\u201d\n\n\n\nLudicrously high gas fees are a problem unique to Ethereum, however, and gas costs are more than low enough on all the other EVM blockchains and layer 2s for smartphone wallets to work just fine. Various teams are also working on gas-optimized versions of the process and, longer term, a precompile could be added to Ethereum, making the process a cheap EVM operation rather than a smart contract. (A precompiled contract carries out common cryptographic functions without using a lot of bandwidth.)\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen these wallets gain traction and users get used to this great usability, it\u2019ll be easier to promote this change in Ethereum itself,\u201d says Weiss. \u201cIf we can add this precompile, it\u2019ll be a game-changer for the ecosystem.\u201d\n\nTimeline of Account Abstraction (Yoav Weiss)\n\nHow to recover your account\n\nFor crypto users who don\u2019t trust the cloud, smart accounts also provide other recovery options than a seed phrase.\n\n\n\nIf a user loses their phone, time-locked social recovery means a group of trusted friends or even a commercial service can help them recover it without putting the enclosed funds at risk.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t ever expect to lose access [to a bank account] because if you lose your password you can always call your bank, they will verify your identity and reset your password,\u201d Weiss explains.\n\n\n\n\u201cSo, you can actually use a recovery service that lets you reset the password for your mobile phone \u2014 your wallet \u2014 but they cannot steal your wallet; they can only help you recover it.\u201d\n\nMotty Lavie, co-founder of Braavos Wallet at StarkWare Sessions. Source: Twitter\n\nBraavos employs a version of a time-locked recovery process that involves creating a seed phrase. Unlike normal seed phrases, this one can only put in a request to regain access to the account after four days.\n\n\n\n\u201cNow the benefit here is that if your phone indeed gets lost or wrecked or whatever, then, you can get control on your account back in four days.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut if an attacker stole your seed, then you would automatically get notified that someone has got control over your account,\u201d he adds, noting that\u2019s plenty of time to withdraw the funds before the hacker can get them.\n\n\n\nBraavos is also working toward using zero-knowledge proofs to put the seed phrase \u201cunder the hood\u201d so that the user can just interact with a decentralized \u201cforgot password\u201d-style prompt.\n\n\n\n\u201cI think that will be a major move in terms of UX [user experience],\u201d he says.\n\nBlockchain gaming smart wallet\n\nBacca explains that Ledger is already working along with Argent and Cartridge on \u201cplugins\u201d that enable gamers in StarkWare to set a session key, enabling numerous low-value transactions to go through automatically so they don\u2019t have to painstakingly approve each one.\n\n\u201cYou could load a small piece of code to your account so it will modify the way it\u2019s acting with a specific game. So, you could say, \u2018If I am going to play that game\u2026\u2019 actions can be signed automatically for one hour,\u201d he says.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m thinking that account abstraction will completely change the crypto user experience.\u201d\n\nHappy to join the builders' council with chief strangeness officer @sylvechv and team \u2013 let's get this party open, decentralized and secure for all. More details https://t.co/7WUCrgCDwZ https://t.co/CNPNa1dLtM \u2014 Nicolas Bacca (@BTChip) December 14, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\nAs an added bonus, smart accounts mean the game developer could decide to become the \u201cpaymaster\u201d and cover the cost of the transaction fees to encourage use.\n\n\n\nTransactions can also be bundled together to save on gas fees, explains Jupiter. \u201cLike a shopping cart scenario, I\u2019m going to reserve these 10 items and then pay for them all at once,\u201d he says.\n\n\n\nMetaMask is building a new addition called Snaps that will crowdsource development of new features for the wallet. This will likely enable innovative uses of smart accounts that nobody\u2019s even thought of yet. A Snap that enables smart accounts was built at ETH India where it won \u201cBest ERC-4337 Tool.\u201d\n\n\n\nSmart accounts make crypto subscriptions possible\n\nBack in December, Visa\u2019s crypto research team published a paper demonstrating how smart accounts on StarkWare can be used to pay \u0430 mortgage, TV subscription and utility bills automatically from self-custodial crypto wallets.\n\n\n\nThey gave a hypothetical example of someone who wants to go on holidays and have their bills paid automatically from their crypto wallet, after they get paid in two weeks\u2019 time.\n\n\n\nYou can already do this from bank accounts of course, or via a custodial wallet, but both require trusting a centralized service. The paper explains that the difficulty doing it on Ethereum is because it has two types of accounts: user accounts (also known as externally owned accounts, or EOAs) and smart contract accounts.\n\n\n\n\u201cA user account, controlled by a private key, can send transactions,\u201d explains Visa Crypto. \u201cA smart contract has associated code that can be executed, however, a smart contract cannot initiate transactions on its own. Transactions must always originate from a user account and be signed by the user.\u201d\n\nVisa Crypto designed a method to autopay bills from crypto accounts. Source: Visa\n\n\n\nSo, if you get paid in crypto every two weeks, you have to manually initiate \u201cpush\u201d transactions to pay each bill after funds are deposited into your wallet.\n\n\n\nSmart accounts make \u201cpull\u201d payments, initiated by a biller, possible. So, for example, an electricity company could set up an auto payment smart contract on its website and list out its functions \u2014 e.g., it will only initiate one transaction per month and set a maximum amount that it will charge. The user can then approve these conditional pull payments via their smart account, enabling automated bill payments after their bi-weekly pay comes in.\n\n\n\nSuddenly, crypto becomes useful for a whole host of new payment applications.\n\nBacca created the world\u2019s first Bitcoin wallet and argues that Bitcoin already lets you be your own bank. But he adds, \u201cThe problem is the lack of things you can do with your money.\u201d That\u2019s one reason he\u2019s excited about recurring payments.\n\n\n\n\u201cBasically, saying \u2018Okay, so I am buying a subscription for a service,\u2019 and then the wallet will start sending money directly matching the subscription for a given period of time,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cIf you can script your account, there are a lot more use cases that come to mind and that are similar to what we do in Web2.\u201d\n\nTimeline of Account Abstraction (Yoav Weiss)\n\nHow ERC-4337 works\n\nSome of the functionality that smart accounts enable was already available via smart contract wallets from Gnosis and Argent; however, these solutions require centralized components called relays to pay transaction fees for the operations.\n\n\n\nThe new ERC-4337 standard on Ethereum decentralizes that part as well with new decentralized infrastructure called \u201cbundlers.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe process works like this: A smart wallet signs a \u201cuser operation,\u201d which gets fired to a special mempool, which is basically just an organized queue of transactions (albeit a different queue to Ethereum\u2019s normal mempool).\n\n\n\nBundlers are like miners or validators and take user operations from the mempool and deliver the desired result back to the wallet. The bundlers also pay for the gas (transaction fee) required and are compensated by the user\u2019s contract account, or by a third party known as a \u201cpaymaster.\u201d This could be a decentralized app or it could be a wallet provider.\n\n\n\nThe first production grade bundler to be deployed on mainnet is from wallet and infrastructure provider Stackup, but more will be available soon. As it\u2019s decentralized and permissionless, anyone can run a bundler."

        "content": "Smart accounts, enabled by the launch of the new ERC-4337 standard, are now available on Ethereum and are expected to help mainstream adoption by finally making crypto user friendly.\n\nEthereum Foundation security researcher Yoav Weiss will make the surprise announcement at WalletCon in Denver today that the core contracts for ERC-4337 \u2014 known by blockchain developers as \u201caccount abstraction\u201d \u2014 have passed an audit by Open Zeppelin and will be made available on every Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible network including Polygon, Optimism, Arbitrum, BNB Smart Chain, Avalanche and Gnosis Chain.\n\nNew users will no longer need to learn about complicated seed phrases or the technical process of setting up a wallet to onboard into the decentralized world of crypto, Weiss told Cointelegraph.\n\n\u201cThe next billion users are not going to write 12 words on a piece of paper. Normal people don\u2019t do that,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to give them better usability, they shouldn\u2019t need to think about cryptographic keys.\u201d\n\n\"EIP-4337 is going to take a year or whatever\" - @sashaaldrick of @gelatonetwork\n\n\n\nYou're in for a big surprise \u2014 John Rising (@johnrising_) February 25, 2023\n\nAccount abstraction also enables the unique cryptographic keys used for cryptocurrency to be stored on standard smartphone security modules, upgrading them to de facto hardware wallets. However the screen remains a security issue compared with traditional hardware wallets and gas costs could be prohibitive on mainnet initially \u2014 although other EVM chains and Layer 2s have low enough fees to make it viable.\n\nIt also enables the use of two-factor authentication; signing transactions on your phone using a fingerprint or face-scan; the setting of monthly spending limits on an account; and the use of session keys to play blockchain games without constantly having to approve transactions.\n\nUsers who lose their phone or device can use time-locked social recovery of their account via a group of trusted friends or even a commercial service. Weiss said:\n\n\u201cIt gives you the same features a bank would without having to trust a bank.\u201d\n\nThe standard has been in development for two years with the team funded via grants from the Ethereum Foundation. While similar functionality is available on smart contract wallets from Argent and Gnosis, these solutions require centralized components called relays to pay gas fees whereas ERC-4337 decentralizes the entire system.\n\nWeiss was one of the lead authors of Etherum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 4337 alongside Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin and five others. He said Buterin had first posted about the concept nine years ago \"before Ethereum even launched, it has taken us this long to get here.\"\n\nThere have been numerous proposals to enable account abstraction prior to this but all required a difficult hard fork of Ethereum, and took a back seat to more pressing upgrades like the Merge. ERC-4337 is an alternate approach that makes use of decentralized infrastructure called \u201cbundlers.\u201d\n\nYour guide to why 'smart accounts' are the hottest thing in crypto right now and will help bring about mainstream adoption.\n\n\n\nThey are the key upgrade enabled by Ethereum's new 'account abstraction' ERC-4337 standard that's being launched today. https://t.co/vFoKhdv4Cl \u2014 Cointelegraph Magazine (@CointelegraphZN) March 1, 2023\n\nIn very simple terms, the process works like this: a smart wallet signs a \u201cuser operation\u201d which gets fired to a special mempool, which is basically just an organized queue of transactions (albeit a different queue than Ethereum\u2019s normal mempool).\n\nBundlers are like miners or validators, taking user operations from the mempool and delivering the desired result back to the wallet. The bundlers also pay for the gas (transaction fee) required and are compensated by the user\u2019s contract account or by a third party known as a \u201cpaymaster.\u201d This could be a decentralized application (DApp) or it could be a wallet provider.\n\nThe first production grade bundler to be deployed on mainnet is from wallet and infrastructure provider Stackup, but more will be available soon. \u201cIt\u2019s permissionless; anyone can run a bundler,\u201d says Weiss. \u201cIt\u2019s not censorable.\u201d\n\nSmart accounts, or account abstraction, is shaping up as a key theme for crypto in 2023. The technology has already been incorporated natively into zk-Rollup layer 2 solutions from StarkWare and zkSync and Visa designed an automated crypto bill payment system that makes use of it.\n\nRelated: \u2018Account abstraction\u2019 supercharges Ethereum wallets: Dummies guide\n\nJohn Rising, the co-founder of Stackup, tweeted this week that an added advantage of account abstraction is that projects can use plain and easily understood language to onboard new users rather than arcane technical terms.\n\n\u201cBecause the contract handles the esoteric blockchain stuff, you don\u2019t have to use words like \u2018gas\u2019 or \u2018nonce\u2019 to accurately describe what\u2019s happening. This is a huge win for crypto adoption and security.\u201d"

        "content": "Gas Prices Rise as NFTs Make a Resurgence on Ethereum\n\nEthereum network transaction volumes have begun to soar, bringing with them a rise in their relative gas prices. Data from on-chain analytics firm Glassnode indicates that the fees have more than tripled in size since the end of 2022.\n\nOver the past nine months, Ethereum transactions have cost an average of 10-20 gwei. However, due to large transactional volumes, this figure has now grown to 38 gwei. According to Glassnode, \u201cthe incremental nature of the gas demand suggests an early resurgence of network activity may be underway.\u201d\n\nEthereum gas fees normally rise and fall depending on network demand. Therefore, as more users attempt to add a transaction on the next block, the fees/cost will rise.\n\nNFT Trading Activity Has Helped Grow Ethereum Gas Fees\n\nUnlike previous spikes in Ethereum gas fees, the new figures are not the result of new wallets joining the Ethereum ecosystem. Data shows that the number of new addresses generated on the network is still 40% below what it was a year ago. Therefore, indicating that existing traders are the driving force behind the recent surge in transaction volumes.\n\nSpecifically, a new drive from Blur with its various incentives to attract users, as well as Yuga Labs\u2019 launch of a highly engaging and rewarding Dookey Dash game have spurred on collectors. In addition, prominent collections announcing the launch of new projects such as Doodles 2 have played a key role.\n\nGlassnode notes, \u201cThe recent attention surrounding Blur has led to a surge in demand for block space, resulting in increased fees for validators, and more ETH being burnt via EIP1559.\u201d\n\nBlur\u2019s rise to the top is proving controversial, as Julian Holguin, CEO of Doodle, highlights. The competition between the two leading NFT marketplaces has constricted the cash available to many NFT projects that have relied on secondary royalties for revenue.\n\nThat said, NFT transactions on Ethereum have risen by 97% for the past two consecutive months. They are approaching levels last seen during the NFT boom from mid-2021 to mid-2022.\n\nWant more?

        "title": "What We Need To Scale Blockchain Technology Into the Future - Blockworks",
        "content": "Scalability is a major roadblock on the path toward bringing blockchains to mainstream audiences. The ultimate goal of providing low-cost access to blockchain-based applications while guaranteeingsecurity and decentralization is based on the blockchain trilemma.\n\nThe blockchain trilemma is premised on the idea that we can only achieve two of the following three aims: decentralization, security, and/or scalability. This has led to countless blockchains sacrificing decentralization or security to achieve scalability, an undesirable tradeoff to say the least.\n\nDespite this challenge, the blockchain industry has seen remarkable growth in its first decade, with a $1 trillion valuation and over 420 million users. The next few years could bring even greater milestones, with the number of crypto users on track to breach the one billion mark within six years.\n\nThe industry\u2019s future undoubtedly lies in building high-performance scalable blockchains, and the need for such solutions has never been as pressing as now. This piece dives deeper into crypto\u2019s scaling problem and how it affects users and developers.\n\nCrypto\u2019s scaling problem\n\nThe cryptocurrency ecosystem faces severe limitations and bottlenecks impeding adoption. The most largely-used blockchains routinely suffer from high transaction fees, congestion, and downtimes during peak periods. And of course, these limitations remain even for projects that sacrifice a degree of decentralization to prioritize speed and low network fees.\n\nCrypto\u2019s scaling problem is further evident in the fragmentation of developers and users on different blockchains. DefiLlama shows there are 170 chains with thousands of additional decentralized applications (dApps) for multiple use cases. The current multi-chain approach results in fragmented liquidity and increased security risks as users bridge assets across chains. It poses an even greater challenge for developers who must jump through hoops to build dApps on different chains.\n\nDevelopers must adopt a common standard for blockchain technology to truly go mainstream. The current approach to development is widely fragmented with vastly different approaches being adopted. Most unfortunately, this fragmented approach trickles down to the end user and results in widely different onboarding and adoption processes.\n\nBuilding a scalable Web3 with Ethereum as a backbone\n\nEthereum\u2019s position as the leading public blockchain in terms of development makes it the ideal foundation for building scalable networks. This article will map out a future where Ethereum is the backbone of Web3 and will provide the necessary tooling for developers to onboard the first billion users to the blockchain industry.\n\nIt is easy to envision such a future given the wide adoption of Solidity, Ethereum\u2019s native programming language. Solidity is the preferred language for blockchain developers because it is easy to learn and unlocks access to the largest community of Web3 users.\n\nSolidity complements the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and provides excellent tooling for building truly decentralized applications with reduced development time and increased interoperability. The number of Ethereum developers has risen by over 400% in the past year to 5,000, which is more than two times higher than competing smart contract blockchains. Ethereum also boasts the industry\u2019s largest DeFi ecosystem, with a significant portion of non-ETH-based TVL still attributed to EVM-compatible networks.\n\nDeFi chains by TVL | Source: DeFiLlama\n\nRather than competing with it, leveraging Ethereum\u2019s powerful network effects is the ultimate solution to a scalable Web3 environment. A recent study by Dartmouth Blockchain, an independent blockchain research team based out of Dartmouth College, served as a third-party benchmark for developers to evaluate transaction speed and finality on eight leading blockchains including SKALE, Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche, Polygon, Fantom Network, Flow, and Near.\n\nThe study revealed that the Ethereum-native SKALE Network is the fastest blockchain based on transactions per second and finality. SKALE posted a TPS value of 397.7 transactions per second, with 1.4 seconds finality, overtaking Solana and Fantom Network.\n\nHow SKALE truly scales Web3 for mainstream adoption\n\nLaunched in 2020, SKALE provides a compelling answer to Web3 scalability through its modular blockchain design native to Ethereum. On SKALE, developers deploy applications on interoperable app-specific chains called SKALE Chains or on shared hubs called SKALE Hubs. Hubs are dedicated chains for games, NFTs, and DeFi protocols and are best thought of as \u201cservice stations\u201d for a collection of dApp chains by providing them liquidity as well as swapping and marketplace services. The Hubs are a key tool to ensure proper token mapping and standarization within the SKALE ecosystem and they\u2019re a huge unlock for developers who now only need to concentrate on integrating with a few chains rather than all the other SKALE Chains.\n\nEach SKALE Chain, both Hubs and dApp chains, are able to scale infinitely since they are dedicated to different categories of blockchain applications. Games, after all, are much different from NFTs or DeFi. That\u2019s why SKALE\u2019s model enables each chain to scale much more easily and economically than on the Ethereum mainnet, where everything lives on the same network and is often clogged during peak periods.\n\nSKALE taps Ethereum for security by hosting its core smart contracts called the SKALE Manager on the Ethereum network. These contracts control functionalities such as validator nodes, staking delegation, and SKALE chain deployment. Instead of competing with Ethereum, SKALE further builds on the legacy network\u2019s success by allowing developers to build with Solidity and full EVM-compatibility.\n\nSKALE\u2019s novel approach to Web3 scalability brings unprecedented benefits. For example, it introduces increased interoperability and standardization of blockchain applications. Different SKALE chains implement the same fundamental features and developer standards, ensuring that users can, among other things, seamlessly transfer assets between chains.\n\nAnother benefit is that developers can offer zero gas fees to users through a unique subscription fee model developed by SKALE. The applications hosted on each SKALE chain pay the gas fee in advance to validators, enabling end users to enjoy a seamless gasless experience currently unavailable on other blockchain networks. SKALE has saved users over $700 million in gas fees across more than 55 million transactions processed since launch. The gas fees that users avoid is another example of SKALE\u2019s overarching commitment to help create invisible Web3 experiences. Put simply, they believe if we want to see the next wave of mass adoption into Web3, the user experience should feel more like Web2.\n\nAnd this commitment is proven by the blockchain projects that are already building mainstream-ready applications on the SKALE Network. For instance, Ruby is a SKALE-based decentralized exchange protocol that incentivizes users with high yield and lower swap fees for holding NFTs. Another project, NFTrade, supports the trading of SKALE-based NFTs through integration with SKALE\u2019s NFT community hub chain, Calypso. Yet another project named Exorde has taken on the formidable task of helping identify and limit the spread of misinformation through blockchain technology. Exorde must process massive amounts of data to provide a result that is reliable, useful, and unbiased, and it\u2019s no surprise they\u2019ve leaned on SKALE\u2019s infrastructure to make it happen.\n\nThe SKALE developer ecosystem is not resting on its laurels and is continually exploring newer ways to bring even greater scalability to Web3 applications. SKALE recently launched its Zero-Knowledge (ZK) Proofs initiative. ZK technology enables users to verify ownership of certain assets or information without disclosing their identity or further details about the owned items. An adaptation of the technology for blockchains will significantly improve user privacy and increase scalability as it compresses data requirements on applications.\n\nZK technology is still in its infancy and faces limitations such as centralization and high implementation costs. Yet, developers are optimistic that further development of ZK technology will prove instrumental to further adoption by mainstream audiences.\n\nIn a real-world example, DeFi users can interact with protocols with improved security and privacy. ZK technology primarily benefits end users and will likely garner interest as the latest generation of crypto-native ZK products launches in the coming months and years.\n\nThe future of blockchain scaling\n\nThe smart players in the cryptocurrency industry are building the infrastructure to onboard the next billion users. A key way they\u2019re doing this is by standardizing blockchain applications and cutting-edge scalability solutions. SKALE\u2019s mainstream-ready infrastructure underpinned by Ethereum delivers these solutions and is already gaining traction within the EVM-developer community.\n\nSKALE envisions a highly interoperable multichain future where developers adopt the same standards and tooling to build apps on specific chains and for diverse use cases. This model is vastly superior to the current state of blockchains, where the developer and user growth is fragmented.\n\nThe upcoming release of SKALE ZK adds to SKALE\u2019s other innovations, including full-EVM compatibility, multi-chain technology, developer-friendly SDKs, and zero gas fees. These solutions combine to position SKALE as an innovator that\u2019s helping Web3 applications enjoy unprecedented scalability.\n\nThis content is sponsored by SKALE.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

(That role is fulfilled by order books and market markers on centralized exchanges, but that\u2019s a different story.)\n\nWhen someone sells token A to buy token B on a decentralized exchange, they rely on tokens in the A/B liquidity pool provided by other users. When they buy B tokens, there will now be fewer B tokens in the pool, and the price of B will go up. That\u2019s simple supply/demand economics.\n\nLiquidity pools are smart contracts containing locked crypto tokens that have been supplied by the platform's users. They\u2019re self-executing and don\u2019t need intermediaries to make them work. They are supported by other pieces of code, such as automated market makers (AMMs), which help maintain the balance in liquidity pools through mathematical formulas.\n\nDid you know? Bancor pioneered the underlying concept of AMMs in 2017. And in 2018, Uniswap, now one of the largest decentralized exchanges, popularized the overall concept of liquidity pools.\n\nWhy is low liquidity a problem?\n\nLow liquidity leads to high slippage\u2014a large difference between the expected price of a token trade and the price at which it is actually executed. Low liquidity results in high slippage because token changes in a pool, as a result of a swap or any other activity, causes greater imbalances when there are so few tokens locked up in pools. When the pool is highly liquid, traders won\u2019t experience much slippage.\n\nBut high slippage isn\u2019t the worst possible scenario. If there's not enough liquidity for a given trading pair (say ETH to COMP) on all protocols, then users will be stuck with tokens they can\u2019t sell. This is pretty much what happens with rug pulls, but it can also happen naturally if the market doesn\u2019t provide enough liquidity.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHow much liquidity is there in DeFi?\n\nLiquidity in DeFi is typically expressed in terms of \u201ctotal value locked,\u201d which measures how much crypto is entrusted into protocols. As of March 2023, the TVL in all of DeFi was $50 billion, according to metrics site DeFi Llama.\n\nTVL also helps capture the fast growth of DeFi: In early 2020, Ethereum-based protocols recorded a TVL of only $1 billion.\n\nWhy provide liquidity to a pool?\n\nFor investors, liquidity provision can be lucrative. Protocols incentivize liquidity providers through token rewards.\n\nThis incentive structure has given rise to a crypto investment strategy known as yield farming, where users move assets across different protocols to benefit from yields before they dry up.\n\nMost liquidity pools also provide LP tokens, a sort of receipt, which can later be exchanged for rewards from the pool\u2014proportionate to the liquidity provided. Investors can sometimes stake LP tokens on other protocols to generate even more yields.\n\nBeware of risks, however. Liquidity pools are prone to impermanent loss, a term for when the ratio of tokens in a liquidity pool (for example, 50:50 split of ETH/USDT) becomes uneven due to significant price changes. That could result in losing your invested funds.\n\nWho's using liquidity pools?\n\n\ud83d\udccf 1inch - a decentralized exchange aggregator that works across multiple chains\n\n- a decentralized exchange aggregator that works across multiple chains \ud83d\udcb0 Aave - a decentralized lending platform\n\n- a decentralized lending platform \ud83d\udd04 Uniswap - a decentralized exchange for swapping Ethereum-based tokens\n\nHow can you add liquidity?\n\nBroadly, there are two ways of adding liquidity.\n\nIf you want to add funds directly to a liquidity pool, such as the ETH/USDC liquidity pool on SushiSwap, you will need to have equal amounts of ETH and USDC, which you can swap using any decentralized exchange.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nYou generally need an equal pair of tokens because trading, borrowing, and most other DeFi activities are almost always two-sided\u2014you exchange ETH for USDC, you borrow DAI against ETH, and so on. As a result, most protocols require liquidity providers to pledge the equivalent value (50/50) of two crypto assets to available pools so that a balanced pair can be maintained. (Balancer has taken an innovative approach, allowing as many as eight tokens in a liquidity pool.)\n\nBut there\u2019s also a less cumbersome way.\n\nYou can \u201czap\u201d into a liquidity pool\u2014adding liquidity in just one transaction through platforms like Zapper, which invented the concept in 2020. Just go to zapper.fi and connect your wallet. Click \u201cpools\u201d to list the liquidity pools available for zapping in and out. Add liquidity to the pool using whatever asset you have. Zapper will exchange them into equal splits of the relevant pair. That saves a couple of separate transactions!\n\nHowever, Zapper doesn\u2019t list all liquidity pools on DeFi, restricting your options to the biggest ones.\n\nThe future of liquidity pools\n\nLiquidity pools operate in a competitive environment, and attracting liquidity is a tough game when investors constantly chase high yields elsewhere and take the liquidity.\n\nNansen, a blockchain analytics platform, found that 42% of yield farmers who provide liquidity to a pool on the launch day exit the pool within 24 hours. By the third day, 70% will be gone.\n\nTo tackle this problem, known as \u201cmercenary capital,\u201d OlympusDAO has experimented with \u201cprotocol-owned liquidity.\u201d Instead of setting up a liquidity pool, the protocol lets users sell their crypto into its treasury in exchange for its discounted protocol token, OHM. Users could stake OHM for high yields.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut the model has run into a similar problem\u2014investors who just want to cash out the token and leave for other opportunities, diminishing the confidence in the protocol\u2019s sustainability.\n\nUntil DeFi solves the transactional nature of liquidity, there isn't much change on the horizon for liquidity pools."

        "content": "The bear market rolls on with no signs of slowing down. But don\u2019t worry, there are still some gems in the crypto market to be found. Collateral Network (COLT), Ethereum (ETH), and VeChain (VET) are three such gems. With COLT available at $0.01 during phase 1 of the presale, this could be the perfect time to get involved.\n\n>>BUY COLT TOKENS NOW<<\n\nCollateral Network (COLT)\n\nCollateral Network (COLT) is pioneering the crowdlending industry with a platform that uses non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to represent digital assets. These NFTs are used as collateral to secure loans. Finally, borrowers can get the cash they need without having to beg banks for a loan.\n\nBy minting NFTs as collateral, Collateral Network (COLT) allows for fractional lending that expands the loan market. Collateral Network (COLT) also helps to create a more secure, transparent and efficient lending system that bridges traditional and digital economies.\n\nThe arrival of Collateral Network (COLT) means that anyone can become a lender, even if they have a small amount of capital. For borrowers, it means they can access funds quickly and without all the hassle of traditional financial institutions. In fact, they should receive cash within 24 hours of approval.\n\nCOLT is the fuel that drives the Collateral Network (COLT) platform, and Collateral Network (COLT) tokens are available at discounted prices during phase 1 of the presale. With the chance to flip the crowdlending market on its head, now\u2019s the perfect time to get involved, as experts predict a 35x price surge for Collateral Network (COLT) during the presale.\n\n>>BUY COLT TOKENS NOW<<\n\nEthereum (ETH)\n\nCreated by Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum (ETH) is a decentralized open-source blockchain platform with smart contract functionality. It acts as the backbone of most crypto projects, hence why it has a market cap of over $140 billion.\n\nDespite losing 75% of its value since its peak in 2021, Ethereum (ETH) remains the go-to blockchain for developers and organizations. The recent launch of Ethereum (ETH) 2.0 should further improve scalability and performance, making it the leading blockchain for the future.\n\nIf Ethereum (ETH) can implement its sharding scaling solution, Plasma, it's expected that more traditional institutions will look to the Ethereum (ETH) platform for their blockchain-based solutions. Purchasing Ethereum (ETH) around the $1000 level could prove wise, especially with analysts predicting that Ethereum (ETH) will hit $10,000 within five years.\n\n>>BUY COLT TOKENS NOW<<\n\nVeChain (VET)\n\nVeChain (VET) is a layer-1 blockchain platform built for enterprise use cases. It is powered by a Proof of Authority (PoA) consensus algorithm and provides advanced smart contract functionality with the VeChainThor blockchain.\n\nVeChain (VET) is already being used by a number of enterprise organizations, including BMW and Walmart China. This is indicative of the VeChain (VET) platform\u2019s ability to provide real-world solutions to businesses in a variety of industries. With its ambitious roadmap and partnership with DNV GL, VeChain (VET) could be one of the top performers when the bear market subsides.\n\nVeChain (VET) is currently priced at $0.016 - 94% down from the all-time high of $0.2782 in April 2021. As such, even a 1000% gain from current prices would not take VeChain (VET) to an all-time high, which translates to this being an excellent time to invest in VeChain (VET).\n\nFind out more about the Collateral Network presale here:\n\nWebsite: https://www.collateralnetwork.io/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/collateralnwk\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Collateralnwk"

        "content": "This allows QuickSwap users to enjoy the security benefit of Uniswap\u2019s audited code while also gaining from the high-speed transactions and near-zero gas fees offered by the Polygon Network.\n\nQuickSwap is a fork of Uniswap since it uses the same liquidity pool model. It has emerged as a quick, affordable and Ethereum-compatible alternative to Uniswap. The difference lies in the fact that QuickSwap is built on Polygon, while UniSwap is on Ethereum.\n\nQUICK (ERC-20 token) is the native cryptocurrency of QuickSwap.It has two use cases: governance and staking. QuickSwap\u2019s governance model grants QUICK tokenholders the power to propose changes to the protocol and cast votes on numerous issues affecting how it functions.\n\nQuickSwap is similar to Uniswap, the originator of AMMs , and provides the same functionality with similar liquidity protocols but a small cosmetic change: It is built on a layer-2 scaling solution (Polygon) unlike Uniswap, which is built on an layer 1, the Ethereum blockchain .\n\nBy supplying a token pair, anyone can launch a new liquidity pool and begin collecting transaction fees from other participants. This makes QuickSwap permissionless; anyone can launch a new pool without requiring permission.\n\nIt functions as an automated DeFi liquidity protocol where users add token pairs to the liquidity pool and earn transaction fees from those who use the pool for swapping tokens. Users can seamlessly exchange any combination of ERC-20 tokens without an order book. As long as there is a liquidity pool for it, users can trade any pair via QuickSwap.\n\nThe QuickSwap DEX uses an automated market maker (AMM) model for users to swap tokens. It was founded by Sameep Singhania in 2020 as a layer-2 DEX on the Polygon network . It fosters the decentralization ethos by ensuring trustless, permissionless and censorship-resistant cryptocurrency trading.\n\nQuickSwap is a layer-2 decentralized application built on the Polygon blockchain allowing users to swap ERC-20 tokens. Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) are blockchain-based applications that form the fundamental cornerstones of the growing suite of decentralized finance (DeFi) tools.\n\nHow does QuickSwap work?\n\nQuickSwap uses an AMM model to provide token pools for users to swap, stake and supply liquidity for token assets.\n\nThe following key features of QuickSwap make up its DEX infrastructure:\n\nLiquidity pools\n\nLiquidity pools are a collection of digital assets that enable trading on a DEX. They are a crucial component in DeFi since they supply the much-needed liquidity required for traders to operate on DEXs.\n\nTo create liquidity pools on QuickSwap, users lock their cryptocurrency into the protocol\u2019s smart contracts, enabling others to use the locked assets. Consider it akin to a publicly accessible cryptocurrency reservoir. Those who fund this reservoir \u2014 aka liquidity providers \u2014 receive a portion of the transaction costs for each user interaction in exchange for supplying liquidity.\n\nOn QuickSwap, liquidity providers receive 0.25% of the trade fees proportional to their share of the pool.\n\nAnother interesting feature of QuickSwap is the change from the order book trade method. Traditionally, exchanges used order books for swap trades. Order books are a real-time collection of buy and sell orders where buyers decide the price that they are willing to pay, place their order price, and then wait for their order to be fulfilled. When a seller matches that price, the order is executed.\n\nThis order book method often creates a sub-optimal user experience with sometimes long wait times, low liquidity or lack of order execution, reliance on a third party to help fulfill orders, and higher chances of scams and hacks.\n\nQuickSwap automates this through smart contracts allowing users to swap ERC-20 tokens. When a user wants to exchange one token with another, they send their chosen tokens to the QuickSwap smart contract. The smart contract then calculates the amount of the second token that the user will receive based on the current market price without relying on third-party buy/sell requests for the token being traded. The price determination is done by QuickSwap\u2019s AMM model.\n\nAutomated market maker\n\nThe QuickSwap AMM model determines the asset prices and provides instant liquidity. It essentially democratizes access to liquidity through its algorithmic code. The QuickSwap AMM is like a financial robot or code that can propose a price between two assets. Instead of the traditional order book, it uses the assets in the liquidity pool to determine the price based on the percentage of tokens in the pool at that time.\n\nThis process is programmatic, allowing rapid access to liquidity since the algorithm can always quote a price for a user. With this approach, a transaction can be completed without waiting for the other side to show up. As long as there is sufficient liquidity in the specific pool, trades can be executed.\n\nThe formula for calculating each token\u2019s price is x*y=k, where \u201cx\u201d represents the financial quantity of Token A and \u201cy\u201d represents the financial quantity of Token B, with \u201ck\u201d being a constant value. QuickSwap uses an AMM called constant product market maker where \u201cx\u201d and \u201cy\u201d multiply to create \u201ck,\u201d which cannot change in value.\n\nFor example, Alice wants to trade Dai (DAI) for Ether (ETH) using the QuickSwap DAI-ETH pool. She added her Dai tokens to the pool for ETH. This increases the ratio of Dai in the pool, resulting in a rise in the price of ETH. But why? Because there is now less ETH in the pool after the transaction, and as per QuickSwap\u2019s AMM formula above, the total pool liquidity (k) must remain constant. To maintain \u201ck,\u201d ETH\u2019s price will rise.\n\nThis mechanism is what determines the pricing. So, the more Dai Alice puts in, the less ETH she gets in return because the price of ETH increases. Ultimately, the price paid for this ETH is based on how much a given trade shifts the ratio between the token pool.\n\nToken swapping\n\nWithout the need for a crypto-to-fiat exchange, cryptocurrency swapping enables users to instantaneously exchange one cryptocurrency for another. While saving time and money are clear advantages, they are by no means the only reasons users swap.\n\nSometimes, traders exchange tokens in an effort to profit from a market movement they anticipate. Other times, swaps are occasionally required to pay transaction fees that can only be paid in a particular blockchain\u2019s native coin. As a result, a user of The Sandbox (SAND) may need to make a swap for ETH or Polygon (MATIC) to access the Polygon network.\n\nQuickSwap charges a small transaction fee of 0.3% for every trade that takes place on the platform and near-zero gas fees. The liquidity providers receive payments from the swap-generated fees.\n\nImpermanent loss\n\nImpermanent loss is a possible risk faced by liquidity providers of AMMs like QuickSwap, Uniswap and other such DeFi platforms. Impermanent loss happens when a liquidity provider provides tokens to a liquidity pool, and the price of the deposited token changes compared to when they deposited them.\n\nLiquidity providers are required to place both assets of the trading pair into a liquidity pool. For instance, in an ETH-DAI pool, when trades lower the amount of ETH in the pool and its price rises, the liquidity provider suffers an impermanent loss, as they now hold less ETH since its value went up.\n\nThe loss is called impermanent, as the price of ETH may move back up to the original deposited value, and trading fees received may even outstrip the loss. Therefore, it is not permanent. However, it is a risk to be considered."

The Shanghai upgrade will be marking the complete transition to a fully functional PoS (Proof of Stake) network, said Parth Chaturvedi, Crypto Ecosystem Lead, CoinSwitch.\n\nCrypto updates\n\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia has revealed a set of projects that will develop use cases for a digital dollar, the eAUD, during its testing phase, currently underway.\n\nPolygon said it launched a new Polygon ID product based on Zero-Knowledge (ZK) technology that will allow users to verify their identities or credentials without revealing sensitive information.\n\nCoinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said the exchange decided to suspend trading of Binance USD (BUSD) because the company had concerns about its liquidity.\n\nTech View By WazirX Trade Desk\n\nSynthetix (SNX) is building a decentralised liquidity provisioning protocol that any protocol can tap into for various purposes. Its deep liquidity and low fees serve as a backend for many exciting protocols on both Optimism and Ethereum.\n\nThe current price of SNX token is 2.9USDT. The price chart has broken out of a descending trendline on a weekly time frame, moreover it is trading above 20-week exponential moving average and has recently formed a Pin Candle which indicates the dip has been bought.\n\nIt is up by more than 29 per cent for the day in comparison to BTC which is up by 1.27 per cent in a day. The immediate support could be expected around 1.7USDT and the next resistance is expected around 4.3USDT\n\n(Views and recommendations given in this section are the analysts' own and do not represent those of Business Today.

        "title": "Vitalik Buterin Shares His Experience on Crypto Payments - Crypto Times",
        "content": "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin publishes a blog post to share his experience of trying to use crypto payments, how crypto wallet UI posed difficulties and the problem of high transaction fees due to scaling issues.\n\nAccording to the blog post, Vitalik Buterin tried crypto payments at various places but faced issues multiple times due to technical glitches.\n\nButerin gave the example of trying to make a payment using bitcoin in 2013, at a sushi restaurant in San Francisco. Although it looked to have been transmitted and received by the restaurant, the transaction did not complete.\n\nThe lesson he learned from this event is that \u201cthe internet is not 100% reliable, and customer internet is less reliable than merchant internet. We need in-person payment systems to have some functionality to allow customers to transfer their transaction data directly to the merchant if that\u2019s the best way to get it broadcasted.\u201d\n\nButerin gave another instance of purchasing tea in 2021 in an Argentine shop with ETH. According to him, the initial transaction was declined because it was below exchange\u2019s minimum payment limit.\n\nThe second one was successful, although the Ethereum co-founder ended up paying three times as much as the beverage\u2019s cost.\n\nA transaction was unsuccessful when Buterin tried again in 2022 at a different location because the gas limits were too low.\n\nAlso, a user interface (UI) error in his phone wallet caused the second transaction to also fail as it made it not possible to scroll down and edit the field that contained the gas limit.\n\nThe lessons he learned through these incidents are \u201csimple-and-robust UIs are better than fancy-and-sleek ones. But also, most users don\u2019t even know what gas limits are, so we really just need to have better defaults.\u201d\n\nDelays between transactions being accepted and recognized by the recipient, and confirmation timeframes are further concerns. Buterin pointed out that the Merge and EIP-1559 had made this better.\n\nButerin also stated UX around transaction inclusion needs to be improved to explore ways to make stuck transactions more obvious in the UI because current wallet UIs suck at showing the risks when the base fee goes too high and transactions do not get accepted.\n\nThe Ethereum co-founder concluded that \u201cGood user experience is not about the average case, it is about the worst case. A UI that is clean and sleek, but does some weird and unexplainable thing 0.723% of the time that causes big problems, is worse than a UI that exposes more gritty details to the user but at least makes it easier to understand what\u2019s going on and fix any problem that does arise.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Ethereum network is getting closer to another major upgrade \u2018Shanghai\u2019 as the Shapella upgrade was successfully rolled out on the Sepolia testnet on Feb 28. The next step in this development will be an upgrade on Goerli public testnet, which will enable developers to write a smart contract and open withdrawal for staked tokens."

        "title": "Everything you need know about Base, the newly launched layer-2 blockchain by Coinbase - CNBCTV18",
        "content": "On February 23, Coinbase, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world, announced the testnet launch of its Ethereum layer-2 network, Base. The main goal of Base is to offer a secure, low-cost, and developer-friendly way for anyone to build decentralised apps (DApps) on-chain.\n\n\"Today, we\u2019re excited to announce the testnet launch of Base, an Ethereum layer 2 (L2) network offering a secure, low-cost, developer-friendly way for anyone, anywhere, to build decentralised apps or \u2018DApps\u2019 on-chain, said Will Robinson, VP of Engineering at Coinbase.\n\nThrough the launch of its L2, Coinbase aims to bring phase 4 of its roadmap to fruition, which is to onboard one billion or more users into the crypto-economy. For now, Base is an Ethereum L2 that is internally controlled and operated by Coinbase. However, going forward, the plan is to achieve complete decentralisation and interoperability with other blockchain networks.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re incubating Base inside of Coinbase, leveraging the last decade of our experience building crypto products, and plan to progressively decentralise the chain over time,\u201d Robinson added.\n\nProjects that build on Base will also be able to leverage the benefits of Coinbase\u2019s existing ecosystem. This includes its several product integrations, easy fiat onramps, 110M+ verified users and the $80 billion worth of assets on the exchange.\n\nIn this regard, Base has already held preliminary discussions with several renowned web3 projects that are looking to come on board. According to the project lead and the head of protocols at Coinbase, Jesse Pollack, some of these projects include Chainlink, Etherscan, Aave, Dune, Nansen, Magic Eden, The Graph, Wormhole, Blockdaemon and so on.\n\nInteroperability is also a big part of the Base roadmap. To begin with, Base will be integrated with the Coinbase exchange and wallet. This will be followed up by support for Coinbase NFT. Eventually, Base aims to be interoperable with other blockchains in the ecosystem beyond Ethereum. In fact, the Base team has already held talks with several leading L1 and L2 protocols, including Polygon, Solana and Avalanche.\n\nBase is built using Optimism's OP Stack. This will allow the L2 to leverage Optimistic Rollups. Through this technology, Base will verify and roll-up transactions off-chain (and in huge batches) before submitting them to Ethereum. This will reduce congestion on Ethereum. It will also help Base users avoid the high, gas-heavy transaction fees on Ethereum.\n\nAs such, Base intends to charge an initial fee of just around $0.10 or $0.20, which is similar to other Ethereum Layer 2 counterparts, such as Arbitrum and Optimism itself. However, in the future, Base aims to reduce its transaction fees to $0.01, depending on the success and adoption of Base.\n\nMoreover, Base is designed to be fully open-source and freely available. By making Base open source, anyone can contribute to it, making it more decentralised and permissionless. In this regard, the project has already set up an ecosystem fund in collaboration with Coinbase Ventures. This fund will be used to incentivize and support project developers looking to build on Base. As per finding from Analytics Insight, Coinbase Ventures is one of the most active VC firms in crypto, with more than 240 investments to date.\n\nMainnet launch and token plans\n\nThe Base testnet went live on Feb 23. The team behind the project is now working on the mainnet, which is expected to launch in Q2 of 2023. However, the team does not have any plans of launching a native token for the network. \u201cWe do not plan to issue a new network token for Base and will use ETH as the native gas token,\u201d Coinbase said in a February 23 tweet.\n\nHowever, it must be noted that even Optimism and Arbitrum launched without native tokens or any plans of launching one. However, 3 years after its launch, Optimism airdropped 200 million OP tokens to 250,000 of its early supporters. There have also been plenty of reports that Arbitrum is working on its token launch. So, while Base has no plans of launching a token as of now, future needs may necessitate one in the future.\n\nBase lights a fire under the Coinbase and Optimism ecosystems\n\nThe news of the launch of Base has already positively impacted the share price of Coinbase, which went up by 10 percent. $COIN jumped from $58.44 on Feb 24 to $64.83 at the time of writing. It has also spelt good news for the Optimism Ecosystem. For instance, the platform\u2019s native token, OP, rallied 16 percent after Coinbase announced the launch of its L2 platform on the OP stack.\n\nBase has also propped up the native token of Velodrome Finance, VELO. The token jumped 21 percent following the launch of the Base testnet. For the unacquainted, Velodrome is an Optimism-based decentralised exchange (DEX). It is also the ninth-largest DEX in the world, with 2.5 percent of the total market volume.\n\nConclusion\n\nIt makes sense for crypto exchanges to launch their own blockchain networks. The Binance Smart Chain is a prime example of this. Launched in July 2017, the chain\u2019s native cryptocurrency, BNB, has already notched up a market capitalisation of nearly $48 billion.\n\nCoinbase has already made significant progress on the trading and exchange front. As such, the launch of Base could help develop and further the utility side of the exchange. It will also go a long way in helping the network achieve its goal of onboarding 1 billion users in the crypto economy."

        "title": "Ethereum vs Ethereum Classic: Comparison Between ETH And ETC - ClearTax",
        "content": "The Ethereum blockchain came into existence in 2014. However, a massive hack forced the developers to go for a hard fork, resulting in a rollback of its DAO-related transactions. This led to the creation of the Ethereum and Ethereum Classic.\n\nThey are separate from each other and have their features and goals.\n\nHere's a detailed guide on Ethereum's history and the major differences between Ethereum and Ethereum Classic.\n\nBackground to Ethereum's creation\n\nIn July 2014, Vitalik Buterin decided to raise funds for Ethereum via a crowd sale. He created the DAO (Decentralised Autonomous Organisation) that allowed probable investors to pitch and discuss ideas and reap the rewards when they got successful. In April 2016, this campaign raised over $150 million, making itself one of the world's largest crowdfunding campaigns.\n\nOne had to buy DAO tokens using Ether to invest in DAO. All was going well, except DAO had a major flaw in its coding. A 'Split Function' allows investors to withdraw their support from a project. Once withdrawn, the investor would get back Ether and have the option to create a 'Child DAO'. Also, the withdrawn funds can be accessed only after 28 days, and the public ledger will be updated by then.\n\nSome users found a loophole in DAO's code. The system refunded the same DAO tokens upon withdrawing their support without registering the transaction on the public ledger. The flaw was that the DAO smart contract returned the Ether before the public ledger got updated. Hackers drained 11.5 million Ether amounting to $50 million at that time.\n\nDue to the 28-day rule, the exploiters failed to get away with the money. To rectify this situation, Ethereum had to undergo a hard fork. Thus it was divided into two different coins. Ethereum and Ethereum Classic.\n\nEthereum aimed to return all the Ether that investors had lost. It has a lot of similarities and a few major differences that set them apart.\n\nEthereum vs Ethereum Classic: Parameters\n\nYou can understand the difference between these blockchains based on the following parameters. They are:\n\n1. Mining process\n\nEthereum Classic uses the Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism for mining. In this process, miners use high-powered ASIC computers to find valid hashes to mine a block. The miners themselves act as validators of a block. The miner gets cryptocurrency and other fees as block rewards upon mining the block.\n\nEthereum currently uses Proof-of-Work (PoW) but plans to shift to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. This will make the network faster and more efficient and increase its scalability.\n\n2. Limit\n\nEthereum Classic has a total supply limit of approximately 210.70 million ETC. After mining all the tokens on the network is done, the miners will get transaction fees as rewards.\n\nEthereum, on the other hand, has an unlimited supply. However, the growth rate is limited to 4.5% per year.\n\n3. Immutability\n\nOn the Ethereum Classic network, you cannot change data after it is logged into the system. This system of immutability helps prevent the tampering of data on the blockchain.\n\nEthereum allows you to replace or cancel a pending transaction for a fee. This helps you when the transaction does not enter the block even after a long time has passed since its initiation.\n\n4. Value\n\nIf you consider market cap and individual token value, Ethereum is far ahead of Ethereum Classic. Ethereum's value is also based on the fact that investors trust it as a safe place to invest, and it is also because it offers a wide range of investment opportunities.\n\n5. Smart contracts\n\nEthereum and Ethereum Classic both use smart contracts. The former uses an advanced token called ERC-20 for creating and issuing smart contracts. Many digital currencies follow this standard, like Maker (MKR), Basic Attention Token (BAT), Augur (REP), OMG Network (OMG) and many more. You can use them to operate smart contracts on the Ethereum network.\n\n6. Wallets supported\n\nThe list of crypto wallets that supports Ethereum are:\n\nMetaMask\n\nLedger Nano S\n\nLedger Nano X\n\nRainbow Wallet\n\nTrezor\n\nArgent\n\nGuarda\n\nAtomic Wallet\n\nExodus\n\nMyEtherWallet and many more\n\nKeepKey\n\nJaxx\n\nThe list of crypto wallets that supports Ethereum Classic are:\n\nABRA\n\nAToken\n\nAtomic Wallet\n\nAlpha Wallet\n\nButton Wallet\n\nKobo\n\nCoin Wallet\n\nCoinomi\n\nEdge\n\nEmerald Wallet\n\nOwnbit\n\nTokenview and many more\n\n7. Supported exchange platforms\n\nThe following exchange platforms support Ethereum:\n\nCoinbase\n\nCrypto.com\n\nBinance\n\nShakepay\n\nKraken\n\nKuCoin\n\nBitpanda\n\nHuobi\n\nCoinmama and many more\n\nThe following exchange platforms support Ethereum Classic:\n\neToro\n\nCrypto.com\n\nCoinbase\n\nBinance and many more\n\n8. Decentralised applications\n\nWhen it comes to decentralised applications, Ethereum is the clear winner. It has the largest collection of dApps in the current market.\n\nSome dApps on Ethereum are:\n\nUniswap\n\nMatcha\n\n1inch\n\nAave\n\nCompound\n\nOasis\n\nDark Forest\n\nFoundation\n\nPoolTogether\n\nZapper\n\nRotki and many more\n\nA few dApps Of Ethereum Classic are:\n\nMultichain\n\nETC Swap\n\nNFT List\n\nCoinRabbit\n\nLazy Lions\n\nCelsius Network\n\nCryptwerk\n\nETC-to-wETC and many more\n\nThe future of Ethereum and Ethereum Classic\n\nThere are many similarities between these two blockchains. It is not something uncommon, as Ethereum originated from Ethereum Classic only. However, these two platforms' current scenarios and prospects are very different.\n\nEthereum is a very popular blockchain, and as Ethereum 2.0 is incoming, its popularity has reached new heights. Ethereum Classic, on the other hand, has lost popularity due to various factors. One was the 51% attacks on the network in July and August 2020. It is less likely that investors would like to put their money on Ethereum Classic.\n\nAlso, Ethereum has Layer-2 scaling that allows it to transfer its network load to other blockchains. Polygon is a good example in this regard.\n\nSo, whether you invest in Ethereum or Ethereum Classic, it's best to analyse the current market trends before you hatch your plan. Conducting research from credible sources is also essential.\n\nAlso, understanding the differences between these blockchains will help you make better investment-related decisions."

        "content": "Unlock Leadership Excellence with a Range of CXO Courses Offering College Course Website IIM Lucknow IIML Chief Operations Officer Programme Visit IIM Lucknow IIML Chief Executive Officer Programme Visit IIM Kozhikode IIMK Chief Product Officer Programme Visit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAccording to me, the crypto winter is far from being over. We should once again be testing lower prices if not lower bottoms. We have seen some relief because money came into the market in hopes that there will be no further interest rate hikes. Also, the FTX crisis and before that the Luna crisis has now started getting forgotten and in the absence of any more new fraudulent activity coming up, people are feeling confident again,\u201d says, Founder,Crypto prices are determined by three things -- one, which has nothing to do with crypto which is macroeconomics. US interest rates are 19 times higher than they were one year ago so 0.25 to 4.75, this has been the biggest driver of the crash but this has also been the driver of some relief we saw recently. The other two problems are very crypto centric. One is there are a lot of protocols and tokens that came out in the market and could only survive in the bull market. One by one they are crashing and then, of course, the ever persistent scams and frauds that may come up. This is the buzz in the crypto market.It would require me to have astrological ability to answer that with precision. In the absence of that I will give you my guess with a disclaimer that I am not a financial advisor. According to me, the crypto winter is far from being over. We should once again be testing lower prices if not lower bottoms. We have seen some relief because money came into the market in hopes that there will be no further interest rate hikes. Also, the FTX crisis and before that the Luna crisis has now started getting forgotten and in the absence of any more new fraudulent activity coming up, people are feeling confident again.Unlike the stock market which has such a long track record, in crypto we have had only four bull markets so far. So, we do not have too much of a track record. What we have seen is that in all cases, when the bear market ended, it was preceded by much more than one year of sideways movement of prices.In the previous bear market, the sideways movement was around the $10,000 mark. This time it is around the $20,000 mark. So even if we are looking at new players coming in or we are looking at money coming into the market. There are lots of people just waiting to sell at even slightly improved prices. So, prices going up is very unlikely in the near future or substantially up. There are some reasons why it might go down. I am clenching my teeth and even preparing for Q1 25 kind of revival though I suspect it will happen much earlier, maybe in early 24.One very interesting statistic which your viewers may not know is that only Bitcoin and Ethereum are two tokens which have survived more than one bull market and that is very interesting. That means when the bear market comes, the previous heroes do not remain heroes anymore. This time, barring Luna and FTT, that is a FTX token called FTT, we have not seen the demise of any major tokens and that worries me. Some of them might be coming up especially because crypto projects actually use their own tokens as if it is a currency and when the value of these tokens and currencies go down, their ability to buy and perform operations go down. Currently they are only firing people. We have not seen worse action than that. My worry is if some of that happens, prices could go down further.If you are looking at a global level, roughly 1% of the people who participate in all asset markets, real estate, forex, equity, mutual funds, etc, participate in crypto markets. The fact is that sentiment of this 1% is very different from the sentiment of the remaining 99% who have not yet come in. The remaining 99% still remain sceptical. They are not even sure that Bitcoin would not go down to zero for instance, but that is not the sentiment of people within the crypto markets. They are trying to be selective and look for companies that may have some more survival, some are going for the major tokens which is Bitcoin and Ethereum. The sentiment amongst crypto investors is pretty decent. Non-crypto investors are staying away.I always have buy orders at various prices and based on the percentage, not on amounts. I have bought all the way down to 15,700 on Bitcoin and my highest purchase has been around the 21,500 marks which was on the way down, not on the way up, which is very important. At present, I fear that all my buy orders which are much lower than present prices may not get fulfilled.Yesterday, one of the Emirates in the United Arab Emirates called Ras Al Khaimah actually opened a crypto free zone. In the last one week, Hong Kong has announced favourable crypto regulations. What we are finding is that there are several pockets around the world where more and more favourable regulations are happening. Even in the US, in the state of Wyoming, in the last one year, we have seen some very positive regulation.On the India front, while they may not officially agree to it, I always sense that there is a difference of opinion between the Reserve Bank of India and the Finance Ministry. Even in the G20, the Finance Minister continued her repeated mention that she would work with international collaboration while the Reserve Bank of India governor actually talked about the fact that we should consider a ban. Since the next discussion in G20 is only in October, it is fair to say that we have a little break and a respite of at least the next 10 months before this topic of ban comes up again.Let us consider two scenarios; one, eventually the whole world will ban crypto, in which case India will look like a visionary. I think the world is headed in the opposite direction and that is regulation. If that happens, given India's tech talent, given India's English speaking population and young population, I fear we are going to miss the bus.I fear that like we have done in the internet, e-commerce and social media, where we had to play catch up and by the way, we caught up pretty well, even here we are going to be condemned to do that. So I would require some visionary thinking from the central bank and finance ministry, recognize the direction in which the winds are blowing globally and align India to maximize its benefit from that.Regrettably, yes, and scams arise for three reasons; one is people come up with fraudulent activity as they literally are fly-by-night operators. If regulations come in, that should reduce.The second one is technological failures such as the one we saw in Luna. Now in this situation, we are just too early, pretty much like when debit cards came here. Debit cards had all the time. Despite more debit cards today, we are seeing that less. I think that is the industry that we are going up.The third one is that today the people who are in the crypto industry and I am talking of the likes of exchanges as well as other start-ups, are focused fundamentally on customer acquisition and not customer education. As a result, the customers, even the ones who are making profits are actually doing it by ignorance. When the audience is ignorant, there will be people who will prey upon that ignorance.If you look at India versus the rest of the world, we have a distinction. In India, the conservative financial investor is largely staying away from crypto markets. The people who invest in mutual funds, the people who have been investing in the stock market for decades, most of them have not touched crypto. It is the people who are in the 18-32 age group that accounts for 85% of crypto investors. Now, these people are investing despite hearing once every two or three months from the RBI that there should be a ban. So that means these people are the wild risk takers. So if a policy comes in, we bring in a new breed of larger relatively more conservative investors. At that point of time, we should see a reduction in the sort of speculative activity you see and hence a reduction in scams.There are two different categories although it sounded like one. The ones who have made severe losses are not necessarily the ones who have lost all hope. So here is the thing. Pretty much like any asset class, just because you may have lost 50%, 80% does not mean that you will have to hold it because it has to go up. Though it can go up, that does not mean it will not go down first.Second, those who are considering swapping between one token and another, may have a very interesting strategy. Please move to bigger, larger cap, more established tokens. The really bad tokens that some of us may have purchased hoping to become rich overnight have shown that they have no future. To believe that they will come up is a little far-fetched.Finally, please do as much research as possible before you enter into this. This is definitely a high-risk asset class. I think it is a very promising asset class. This is all that I invest in but still lots of research is required."

        "title": "Post-Shanghai upgrade; How will Ethereum's price react? - Finbold - Finance in Bold",
        "content": "The cryptocurrency market is looking forward to the Shanghai upgrade on the Ethereum (ETH) network that would allow investors to withdraw their staked ETH. Ahead of the historical event, concerns have been raised over the possibility of the withdrawn ETH flooding the market, a factor that would likely impact the value of Ethereum.\n\nHowever, a review by crypto analysis platform CryptoQuant on March 1 indicates that based on onchain data, the possibility of Ethereum recording a surge in selling pressure after the upgrade is minimal.\n\nAccording to the platform, the analysis is backed by the fact that 60% of staked ETH, or 10.3 million ETH, remains at a loss, and investors are likely to hold on to the asset until market conditions improve. The staked Ether represents about 13% of the total Ethereum supply. Secondly, the analysis indicates that Lido Dao (LDO), the largest Ethereum staking pool at 30%, is also at a loss, while the staked ETH has an average loss of 24%.\n\n\u201cTypically, selling pressure arises when participants have extreme profits, which is not the case for staked ETH currently. Additionally, the most profitable staked ETH was staked less than a year ago and has not seen significant profit-taking events in the past,\u201d CryptoQuant said.\n\nStaked Ethereum price. Source: CryptoQuant\n\nPreparations for withdrawing staked ETH\n\nThe Shanghai upgrade remains among the highly anticipated Ethereum blockchain events after the Merge upgrade transitioned the network to the proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol. Ahead of the upgrade, investors simulated the withdrawal process after the Zhejiang testnet went live on February 1. Another test for the Shanghai upgrade on the Sepolia testnet also went live at the end of last month.\n\nAs different players continue to look forward to the staking withdrawal, the United States regulators are also increasing their crackdown on the space, a factor likely to influence the value of Ethereum.\n\nEthereum price analysis\n\nOverall, the network upgrade has been touted to have a positive implication for the value of Ethereum in the long term. At the moment, Etheruem\u2019s price has been weighed by the overall market downturn. By press time, Ethereum was trading at $1,644 with weekly losses of about 2%.\n\nEhereum seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nBased on the outcome of the upgrade, if investors hold their ETH, it will give the second-ranked crypto by market cap a chance to break the $1,700 resistance and push for $2,000. Alternatively, Ethereum could drop below the $1,500 support level if high selling pressure is realized.\n\nThe decentralized finance (DeFi) asset also controls a market cap of about $200.8 billion.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "content": "The Ethereum Foundation has announced that Devcon 7, the Ethereum developer conference, will be held in Southeast Asia in 2024. The decision was made to have a greater impact on the regional Ethereum community and to allow more time for it to mature and develop.\n\nThe event will bring together the community, bridge with outside communities, and welcome newcomers to Ethereum. Southeast Asia has a growing and untapped Ethereum community.\n\nFour countries in the region rank in the top 20 of the Global Crypto Adoption Index, with Vietnam and the Philippines at the top two. Devcon 7 in Southeast Asia will provide a platform for this new, active, diverse, and large community to showcase their work on the world Ethereum stage.\n\nThe announcement stated that the decision to hold the event in 2024 was made to allow more time for projects and the protocol to advance and improve, so speakers can share something truly significant. This will also give the organizers more time to plan and make the event top-notch again.\n\nThe long wait for the event will create higher anticipation and make it more accessible for those who want to participate but cannot travel to Devcon every year.\n\nEthereum Community To Take Center Stage At Devcon 7\n\nEthereum events and communities are emerging globally, and the Foundation is subtracting so that others can add. The Foundation is giving room for local community events to grow further and become more diverse participants in the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nSpecific locations within Southeast Asia are still being evaluated, and the final decision will be based on a number of factors, including venue availability. The Foundation accepts proposals from Southeast Asian communities until March 15, 2023.\n\nThe different places in the region, from the bustling streets of Bangkok and Kuala Lumpur to the beautiful beaches of Bali and Phuket, the majestic mountains of Vietnam, and more, offer exciting possibilities for the venue.\n\nThe Ethereum community is still western-dominated, despite the practical use of crypto in Southeast Asia. The Foundation\u2019s decision to bring Devcon to Southeast Asia is in line with its goal of increasing diversity within the ETH community and reaching more local communities.\n\nThe Foundation invites everyone to be part of their journey and help shape the future of Devcon by submitting Devcon Improvement Proposals (DIPs). They encourage attendance at other community-driven events and sponsorships to strengthen the builder ecosystem of local communities.\n\nHowever, scheduling Devcon 7 for 2024 in Southeast Asia is expected to have a significant impact on each attendee and the ETH community as a whole.\n\nRelated Reading | Shiba Inu\u2019s Project Lead Reacts To MetaMask SDK Feature"

        "content": "An unknown Ethereum address has transferred almost 25 trillion Shiba Inu tokens worth over $250 million from a top crypto exchange to a self-custody wallet, according to on-chain data reported by crypto analytics firm Santiment.\n\nThe SHIB tokens were moved from an Ethereum address categorized by Etherscan as belonging to US crypto exchange Crypto.com to a new wallet.\n\nThe transfer was made in six different transactions and the whale has been amassing ETH rapidly since March 1st, possessing 992 ETH alongside its now 25 trillion SHIB.\n\nShiba Inu Transfer Is 3rd Largest In The World\n\nAccording to The Daily Hodl, the massive transfer to the cold storage makes it the third largest Shiba Inu wallet in the world and the biggest that has not been identified as belonging to an exchange.\n\nStatistics collected by WhaleAlert shows that the largest transaction it recorded involved the transfer of 4.1 trillion SHIB tokens to an unidentified wallet for around $45 million.\n\nIt is not clear whether the transactions are being carried out by Crypto.com, which is moving its SHIB to a new wallet, or whether they are being made by another whale who is relocating their tokens.\n\nIn a 24-hour span from Monday and Tuesday, the Shiba Inu burn tracking site Shibburn witnessed an explosion in SHIB\u2019s burn rate, with the dog-inspired token incinerating a whopping 453 million coins \u2013 marking an unprecedented 1,317% surge.\n\nImage: Gfinity\n\nSHIB Burning: Community-Driven Initiative\n\nThe act of \u201cburning\u201d Shiba Inu tokens refers to the process of sending them to an address without any retrievable private key, making them effectively unusable and removing them from circulation permanently.\n\nThis is often done to help control inflation and increase the value of the remaining tokens by reducing the total supply in circulation. In the case of Shiba Inu \u2013 the world\u2019s second largest meme coin \u2013 burning tokens is a community-driven initiative aimed at increasing the value of the cryptocurrency.\n\nAdditionally, it is also believed to be a nod to the tradition of burning paper money as a form of offering to ancestors in some Asian cultures.\n\nExcitement On Shibarium Launch\n\nMeanwhile, the Shiba Inu community is also excited about the beta launch of Shibarium, the ecosystem\u2019s layer-2 protocol built on top of Ethereum, similar to Polygon.\n\nThe Shiba Inu community is on the rise as they continue to explore new avenues for growth. Last week, SHIB\u2019s beta version was released, providing an opportunity for beta testers to get a glimpse of the testnet.\n\nSHIB total market cap now a little over $6 billion on the daily chart at TradingView.com\n\nShytoshi Kusama: Hunting For \u2018Bugs\u2019\n\nThe highly anticipated Shibarium, a layer-2 protocol built on top of Ethereum (ETH), similar to Polygon (MATIC), is still in beta, and according to the pseudonymous SHIB developer Shytoshi Kusama, it may remain so for two to four months as the team focuses on building more effective systems and tracking for \u201cbugs.\u201d\n\nThese developments have sparked a new wave of enthusiasm and curiosity amongst the Shiba Inu community.\n\nThe launch of Shibarium and the recent transfer of SHIB tokens reflect the community\u2019s sustained interest and growing importance in the cryptocurrency world.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how these developments impact the future of Shiba Inu and its adoption rate.\n\n-Featured image from The Market Periodical"
