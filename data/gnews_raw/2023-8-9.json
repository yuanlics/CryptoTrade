        "title": "Retrieve Bitcoin and Ethereum Public Blockchain Data with Amazon Managed Blockchain Query | Amazon Web Services - AWS Blog",
        "content": "Over the past two years, public blockchain adoption has been driven by three primary use cases:\n\ndecentralized finance (DeFi), which provides an open financial system built using smart contracts on public blockchains\n\nnon-fungible tokens (NFTs) that certify ownership of digital assets and enable broad transferability of those digital assets\n\ndigital currency payments that enable value transfer without intermediate institutions\n\nIn addition to the adoption driven by the early Web3 innovators, regulated enterprises are also increasing their use of public blockchains. For example, financial institutions such as Ita\u00fa Bank and Fidelity are entering into the cryptocurrency space as trusted, regulated custodians and exchanges. Other institutions, such as Nasdaq, are enabling cryptocurrency for traditional finance as technology providers. Media companies such as Warner Music Group and consumer companies such as Nike continue to incorporate NFTs into their event ticketing and loyalty programs. Payment processors such as Visa and Mastercard are offering cryptocurrency debit cards and solutions for merchants.\n\nHowever, the growing adoption has also highlighted one of the growing challenges of building with blockchain, which is data. The immutability of blockchain transactions, a strength of the technology, means that the data can only grow with time. And although this data is stored publicly and can be accessed by everyone, transforming this information into a performant and accurate format that can be accessed efficiently at scale by applications is a challenge for many customers.\n\nIn this post, we describe the general challenges of working with blockchain data and introduce how Amazon Managed Blockchain Query, a feature of Amazon Managed Blockchain, can help you access blockchain data quickly so you can focus on building differentiators for the mainstream businesses and consumers.\n\nChallenges of blockchain data\n\nAt a high level, the challenges of preparing blockchain data is similar to many other big data problems: complicated ETL (extract, transform, and load) processes, disparate sources of information, and expensive storage.\n\nFirst, the method in which blockchain data is stored poses challenges for application use. Blockchain data is essentially stored as a ledger of state transformations between each block. That is, the information captures what changed from block n to block n+1, such as balance changes in addresses or new smart contracts being deployed. This structure, although well-suited for ensuring data integrity and security on a decentralized network, isn\u2019t ideally suited for tasks like data analysis or developing applications that need to run complex queries. There are no simple data views that can serve commonly requested data in a performant manner that application builders are used to. Take for example a wallet developer, who needs to load the historical wallet balance of a user in seconds. To run the queries efficiently, they would first need to download the entire blockchain ledger (which could be several hundreds of gigabytes in size and requires connecting to blockchain nodes) from multiple blockchains such as Ethereum, Arbitrum, and Polygon. Following this, the data would need to be indexed in a database system that allows efficient queries\u2014a task that presents a significant computational challenge, especially when dealing with larger blockchains.\n\nSecond, in order to provide real-time data, developers have to adapt their system for blockchain finality, which is the assurance that that past transactions can never change. Because blockchains are global and decentralized, it takes a certain time (or number of blocks) for the network to reach an agreement, or consensus, about the blockchain\u2019s legitimate state. During this time, which could range from minutes to hours, data received by a blockchain node may be replaced by another dataset that is recognized by the network as legitimate. In busy times with many transactions being submitted to different nodes, blockchains may revert transactions from multiple blocks. This characteristic of eventual finality is challenging for developers because in such cases, they have to correct the data they have already processed and calculated (such as balances), while still keeping up to date with the streaming information from the blockchain. This also causes problems in situations demanding real-time data for decision-making processes. Take for example a financial application interacting with public blockchains. A high-value trade could potentially be run based on a confirmed transaction in the system. However, this transaction could be later reversed if the network acknowledges another chain as the true one. The financial implications of such a reversal could be significant, demonstrating the inherent risk and complexity associated with streaming real-time data from the blockchain.\n\nThird, developers must assimilate data from multiple sources to construct a complete picture of transactions and interactions in a manner that is easy for humans to understand. With applications now expected to be deployed across multiple blockchains, developers have to process information from different blockchains with potentially different standards. Data stored on the blockchain includes critical information such as the from address, to address, transaction amount, and address of the token smart contract. Blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum both store data in completely different structures, and as such, developers who wish to access data from these blockchains must navigate these differences in data structure and JSON-RPC API options to extract that data in a usable manner.\n\nFourth, developers sometimes have to rerun smart contracts to understand the fine-grained details of their operations. This is one of the most resource-intensive challenges when working with blockchain data. Smart contracts are self-running contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into lines of code. However, the current flexibility in how different smart contract developers code their functions and emit events on the blockchain makes tracking vital information such as balances or transaction details an arduous task. To interact with the distributed applications on the blockchain, such as decentralized lending platforms or decentralized exchanges, transactions often involve calling multiple smart contracts. Smart contracts often interact with each other and their behavior can vary based on the blockchain\u2019s state. Consequently, obtaining an accurate understanding of what a smart contract was doing at a specific point in time often entails recreating the entire state of the blockchain at that moment and tracing the transactions. For example, consider a music artist offers a token-gated event where only holders of that artist\u2019s Non-Fungible Token (NFT) collection on a given date would be admitted to a live concert. To verify the exact conditions under which an individual may be granted access to the event \u2014such as the token balance of a given user\u2019s wallet at a historical point in time or the exact NFT that user owned\u2014a developer might have to recreate the entire state of the blockchain at a given time to determine who should and should not be granted access to the event, depending on smart contract design. This process is computationally expensive and time-consuming, presenting considerable challenges in terms of efficiency and scalability.\n\nAMB Query \u2013 Key Features\n\nIn this section, we discuss key features of Managed Blockchain Query and how it supports builders\u2019 blockchain data needs.\n\nCost-efficient public blockchain data\n\nManaged Blockchain Query provides standardized APIs to retrieve blockchain data from multiple public blockchains, starting with Bitcoin and Ethereum, without requiring you to provision or manage infrastructure for blockchain nodes nor maintain indexing infrastructure to extract, transform, and load blockchain data for use in your applications. Managed Blockchain Query APIs offer predictable pricing by allowing you to pay only for the API requests you make, paying per million requests based on pricing buckets that are priced according to the compute and data resources required to render the result for the API request.\n\nTo illustrate the cost-efficiency of Managed Blockchain Query, imagine you operate a custodial digital asset wallet that interacts with the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains. Imagine the monthly demand for this wallet requires 20 million requests for token balances for user addresses on Bitcoin and .5 million requests to get transaction events (for example, transaction inputs and outputs) for Bitcoin. Additionally, the wallet must accommodate 5 million requests for token balances for Ethereum assets and 2.5 million requests for Ethereum transaction events. The cost for this request traffic is calculated in the following table (in the us-east-1 Region).\n\nReliable and highly available\n\nWith REST APIs available in the supported Regions backed by robust data indexing infrastructure and ETL pipelines, Managed Blockchain Query provides reliable and highly available access to public blockchain data across multiple chains. Managed Blockchain Query follows the AWS high standard for reliability, so you can build your application to use Managed Blockchain Query with confidence. Furthermore, you no longer have to guess about capacity, because Managed Blockchain Query APIs scale with your request volume to service your requests at subsecond latency. Managed Blockchain Query also provides high availability, and you can expect 99.9% availability from the service.\n\nRegardless of whether you are building a proof of concept or a high-scale production workload, Managed Blockchain Query can support your blockchain data query needs.\n\nAccelerate development of Web3 applications with developer-friendly REST APIs\n\nManaged Blockchain Query offers APIs that reduce the time and complexity involved in rendering public blockchain data insights to your applications and your users. For example, with a single API call, you can retrieve a list of transactions sent and received from a given wallet address on Ethereum, which makes it easy to populate a user interface with historical transaction details. Furthermore, you can use Managed Blockchain Query to get the current finalized and historical balance for native coins (such as ETH and BTC) and non-native tokens (such as ERC20) with subsecond latency. You can use this API to retrieve individual tokens as well as to retrieve a full list of token balances for a given wallet address. Managed Blockchain Query APIs make common blockchain data insights readily available to developers to use within a myriad of applications, such as web and mobile wallets, analytics pipelines, trading applications, and more, helping developers with dependencies on blockchain data launch products faster.\n\nUse cases for Managed Blockchain Query\n\nManaged Blockchain Query delivers common public blockchain data in a simple way to developers, without requiring custom data indexing and query infrastructure. For example, imagine a digital wallet that needs to display a list of historical transactions and current balances for Ethereum tokens (ERC20, ERC721, ERC1155 and native Ether (ETH). With Managed Blockchain Query APIs, this data is available with a simple REST API call. You can learn more about each API in the Managed Blockchain Query collection in Managed Blockchain Query Developer Guide.\n\nIn this section, we discuss a variety of lower-level use cases that Managed Blockchain Query APIs can address.\n\nQuery current and historical token balances on public blockchains\n\nThe GetTokenBalance API provides a way to get the balance of native coins (ETH, BTC) and various tokens (ERC20, ERC721, ERC1155), which can be used to get the current balance of an externally owned account (EOA) or a historical balance using a universal timestamp (Unix timestamp, in seconds). For example, you can use the GetTokenBalance API to get an address\u2019s balance of an ERC20 token, USDC, on the Ethereum mainnet. You can also retrieve balances of tokens in a batch by providing a list of coins or tokens for which to get balances using the BatchGetTokenBalance API.\n\nRetrieve historical transaction data for a given address\n\nWith Managed Blockchain Query, you can easily retrieve historical data from public blockchains such as Ethereum. This enables several use cases, like populating transaction history on a mobile or desktop crypto wallet or providing contextual information about a transaction based on its transaction hash. In this example, you can use the ListTransactions and GetTransaction APIs to first get a list of all transactions for a given externally owned address (EOA) on the Ethereum mainnet, and then retrieve transaction details for a single transaction in the list.\n\nGet all token balances for a given address\n\nThe ListTokenBalances API is a powerful tool for wallets, user interfaces, Web3 utilities, and more, because it returns a list of all balances for an address across both tokens (ERC20, ERC721, ERC1155) and native coins (ETH, BTC) on a given public blockchain in a single API call. In this example, you can provide an EOA and a network on the Ethereum mainnet, and receive a list of token and native coin balances on Ethereum in the response.\n\nGet all tokens minted by a smart contract\n\nThe ListTokenBalances API can also return a list of all tokens (ERC20, ERC721, ERC1155) minted by a smart contract when passed the smart contract address as input. For example, you can retrieve information related to NFTs minted by an ERC721 smart contract on Ethereum in a single API call.\n\nList events emitted by a given transaction\n\nThe ListTransactionEvents API allows you to retrieve a list of smart contract standard events that are emitted as a result of a given transaction, identified by its hash (transaction identifier). For example, you can use ListTransactionEvents to inspect the resulting events of a transaction that calls a function of an ERC20 token smart contract on Ethereum, such as a Transfer event.\n\nUsing AMB Query in the AWS Management Console\n\nThe AWS Management Console experience for Amazon Managed Blockchain Query offers a graphical user interface query editor that allows you to test Query APIs straight from your browser via your AWS account. To illustrate how to use the query editor, this example details how to use the ListTransactions API to retrieve a full list of transactions an EOA has been party to.\n\nNavigate to the AWS Management Console and sign into your AWS account. Then navigate to the Amazon Managed Blockchain service using the search bar and select the \u201cQuery public blockchains\u201d radio button on the right-hand side of the screen. Finally, select \u201cLaunch AMB Query\u201d.\n\nOnce on the query editor page, you must select between the Bitcoin network or Ethereum mainnet as the target for your query. For this example, select \u201cETHERUM_MAINNET\u201d from the \u201cBlockchain network\u201d dropdown.\n\nThen, select the AMB Query API you wish to run from the \u201cQuery type\u201d dropdown, which in this case will be \u201cListTokenBalances\u201d.\n\nThen, fill in both required and/or optional query parameters to finalize your request for blockchain data. In this example, provide an Ethereum externally owned account (EOA) address and any filters by date/time that are relevant.\n\nAfter adding all necessary details to your request, select \u201cRun query\u201d to receive results for your request. If no results are returned, verify that you are using an EOA that has transactions occurring within any date/time filters you have set for your request.\n\nYou may use the AMB Query editor in the AWS Management Console to test all supported AMB Query APIs and explore the Bitcoin and Ethereum data these APIs offer. AMB Query is a pay-as-you-go service billed based on your usage of APIs, thus no resources have been provisioned in your account as part of this hands-on example that need to be deleted.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn this post, we addressed the common challenges builders face when working with blockchain data, as well as how Managed Blockchain Query can address many of those challenges.

        "title": "3 Stocks to Watch as Ethereum Builds Base on PayPal Boost - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) has always showcased its competency as an open-ended decentralized software platform. It is one of the selling points of the world\u2019s second most-used cryptocurrency. However, PayPal Holdings, Inc.\u2019s (PYPL) announcment on Monday that it would be introducing its own U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin, PayPal USD (PYUSD), could spark some serious debate.\n\nPYUSD is an Ethereum-based stablecoin, which would, after introduction, be pegged to the value of the U.S. dollar. It has been designed for digital payments and the web, and will soon be available for U.S. customers. But even as this is bound to push Ethereum stocks up by establishing its place as the money layer on the Internet, it will also hit the crypto coin\u2019s core value of decentralizing.\n\nCentralization issues are the most common attack areas within the gamut of decentralized finance or DeFi, one of the crypto world\u2019s main differentiating features. In 2021 alone, DeFi hacks amounted to no less than $10 billion, revealing patterns of how the transactions are classified and tracked. Now, with around 430 million accounts actively using PayPal, the chances of cluster attacks would go up.\n\nMany smart contract auditors have highlighted that the PYUSD algo contains \u201cfreezefunds\u201d and \u201cwipefrozenfunds\u201d functions, which are textbook examples of centralization attack vectors. Concerns have also been raised about the digital contract that users would sign, and that these contracts resemble censorship-enabled central bank digital currency.\n\nDespite this, Ethereum would get a massive boost once the project goes live. It would finally give Ethereum the mainstream push that it has been seeking all these years in its competition with Bitcoin (BTC). Coupled with the Shanghai Upgrade, under which it shifted its blockchain validation system from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake, this might be ETH\u2019s year.\n\nPowered by these developments and what has largely been hailed as a crypto rebound, the price of Ethereum has soared 53.9% this year as of Aug 8. So, with Ethereum getting this push, it might be prudent to keep a watch on stocks exposed to this open-source blockchain platform, decentralized or not.\n\nStory continues\n\nAccenture plc ACN is a global system integrator that provides consulting, technology and other services, and markets Ethereum-based blockchain solutions to businesses to make it easier to process payments.\n\nAccenture\u2019s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 8.2%.

As a relatively new conception, many Americans are unaware of the myriad diversification benefits that a cryptocurrency IRA can offer them.\n\nWhile Gold IRAs and Silver IRAs are common avenues for people to protect their nest eggs with tangible assets, IRAs containing Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other digital currencies are only now starting to gain traction among retirement investors. However, in today\u2019s age of generational inflation and interest rates at 5.5%, we\u2019re seeing more and more investors turn to alternative assets such as cryptocurrencies in their IRAs in order to hedge against systemic market risks and stock market volatility.\n\nWhile newer to the scene, Crypto IRAs offer some of these same qualities as Precious Metals IRAs but with more potential long-term and short-term upsides.\n\nAccording to Bank of America, digital currencies could have a $2 trillion+ market value with 200 million+ users and spearhead the new age of global finance. Crypto makes international financial transactions borderless, efficient, and seamless while offering attributes akin to \u201cdigital gold.\u201d As MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor says, \u201cIt is pretty clear digital gold is going to replace gold this decade.\u201d\n\nBitcoin IRAs are the more established choice for crypto IRA enthusiasts. As the largest and most established cryptocurrency, they offer digital asset exposure to investors\u2019 retirement accounts while maintaining a degree of stability with long-term upside. These IRAs have been around for roughly seven years, with the first Bitcoin IRA launching in 2016 by the aptly named company, BitcoinIRA.\n\nMainstream adoption of Bitcoin is increasing, too, with Colorado recently becoming the first U.S. state to accept crypto for tax payments. Abroad, central banks such as the European Central Bank are set to begin pilot projects for their own digital currencies that operate like Bitcoin. In fact, 11 central banks have already launched their own.\n\nThere\u2019s clearly something to cryptocurrencies if even the world\u2019s largest financial institutions are getting on board with these new technologies.\n\nFurthermore, Bitcoin outperformed gold and the stock market between 2019 and 2021, and is currently on pace to do the same in 2023. A CNBC report also showed that Bitcoin IRAs surged in popularity in 2021 as a vehicle for building long-term wealth while reaping the tax benefits of IRA accounts.\n\nBitcoin IRA accounts, however, don\u2019t exclusively contain Bitcoin. While Bitcoin is the primary crypto holding, these IRA accounts often possess several other cryptocurrencies and altcoins.\n\nRecently, many savvy investors have shifted their Crypto IRA accounts to Ethereum IRAs. Although Bitcoin IRAs, to date, are better known, Ethereum provides investors with a whole new avenue of exposure to a different segment of the crypto universe and long-term potential.\n\nWhat is Ethereum, and How Does it Differ From Bitcoin?\n\nComparisons between Bitcoin and Ethereum, especially when it comes to IRA accounts, are inevitable. Bitcoin remains the largest and most established cryptocurrency. Ethereum has rapidly gained ground as the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap over the last few years. As of Q3 2023, Ethereum has a token price of US$1,848 and a total market volume of $6.9 billion.\n\n(IronMonk Solutions via CoinMarketCap, sponsored) Ethereum has rapidly gained ground as the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap over the last few years.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) have inherent similarities. Both are investable cryptocurrencies, decentralized, and deregulated. Each is on the blockchain, stored in digital wallets, and powered by distributed ledgers and cryptography. This means that they cannot be changed, hacked, or controlled by any single centralized entity.\n\nHowever, that is about where the similarities end.\n\nPrimary Purposes\n\nBitcoin, as the world\u2019s first cryptocurrency, was created in 2009 by an anonymous computer programmed who goes by the name of Satoshi Nakomoto. This came on the heels of the financial crisis recession, which necessitated new financial technologies to prevent future financial crises. Its purpose was to compete with fiat currencies as an electronic P2P currency system, medium of exchange, and store of value comparable to digital gold. Whether or not it has accomplished all of those goals is a matter of public debate.\n\nOn the other hand, Ethereum is the next-most-popular cryptocurrency, and it was built with a different purpose. It\u2019s an avenue for developers to monetize smart contracts, create decentralized apps (\u201cdApps\u201d), and build on top of existing programming languages. Vitalik Buterin, a young mathematic and computer science prodigy, co-created Ethereum in 2013 to facilitate immutable, programmatic contracts. Chances are, it\u2019s served its initial purpose more than Bitcoin has. Since its emergence, it has spawned a revolution in blockchain technology, leading to the creation of thousands of cryptocurrencies that run on its framework.\n\nNumerous surging areas in the crypto ecosystem, such as Decentralized Finance (DeFi), exchanges, NFTs, crypto gaming, and more, were built and monetized on the Ethereum blockchain. According to USA Today, the current price target for Ethereum in 2023 is about $2,900 per ETH token.\n\nIn many ways, Bitcoin and Ethereum are not direct competitors but rather cohabitors in the same universe. Yet the Ethereum ecosystem, especially as it upgrades to Ethereum 2.0, is growing exponentially. It is \u201copen-sourced\u201d and decentralized and offers smart contracts, making it fully programmable. Ethereum, more so than Bitcoin, has revolutionized the crypto ecosystem for developers as a medium to build real-world, fully customizable applications.\n\nPerhaps that\u2019s why, from 2020 to 2022, Ethereum\u2019s skyrocketing value dwarfed that of Bitcoin. Since mid-2022, however, Bitcoin and Ethereum have followed similar growth trajectories, as indicated in the charts below.\n\n(IronMonk Solutions via WalletInvestor, sponsored) Bitcoin Charts.\n\n(IronMonk Solutions via WalletInvestor, sponsored) Ethereum Charts.\n\n\u201cDigital Gold vs. Digital Silver\u201d\n\nGold and silver are precious metals that naturally compete, especially when it comes to IRA accounts. Gold is considered a store of value and inflation hedge because of limited supply and stability. Silver has similar attributes while offering more widespread industrial uses, affordability, and liquidity. Russ Koesterich of BlackRock notes that silver has more industrial uses than gold, such as electronic devices, electrical systems, and solar panels. Silver is also integral to an EV industry that could be a potential $46 trillion juggernaut industry by 2050, notably for \u201cthe electric engine, battery pack, and battery management system.\u201d According to Morgan Stanley, silver is significantly cheaper than gold and more accessible to small retail investors. Moreover, silver is liquid, ubiquitous, and versatile in trading.\n\nOf course, similar to Bitcoin and Ethereum, gold and silver are 1 and 2 regarding precious metal market value.\n\nBitcoin is often compared to digital gold because it was the first cryptocurrency. It also has the largest market cap and is in limited supply, making it a digital store of value. Ethereum is often compared to digital silver because it is the second-largest cryptocurrency. Like silver, it serves various purposes for a wide range of applications. It is also cheaper than Bitcoin and more liquid.\n\nTransactions\n\nWhen it comes to transaction fees, Bitcoin remains significantly cheaper than Ethereum. Bitcoin\u2019s transactions are also monetary, with notes and messages affixed and encoded within data fields in its transactions. In contrast, Ethereum transactions contain executable code for creating smart contracts or self-executing contracts and applications built on top of them.\n\n(IronMonk Solutions via TheBlock, sponsored) Transaction Fees.\n\nIn 2021, Ethereum underwent a \u201chard fork\u201d where its underlying blockchain system was upgraded to smoothen out how transaction fees are calculated and make them less volatile. In 2023. After successfully forking, the Ethereum token saw an immediate +3.9% price surge.\n\nBitcoin is ready to do the same. After numerous hard fork events in its past, Bitcoin is headed for another sometime in the next few years\u2014after which, we could see large-scale price action.\n\nWith Ethereum, you often get what you pay for. Ethereum\u2019s transaction speed is infinitely faster than Bitcoin\u2019s. The block time, which determines how long it takes for transactions to get confirmed, takes roughly 10 minutes for Bitcoin and 15 seconds for Ethereum. Bitcoin\u2019s transaction throughput is only about 7 per second, compared to Ethereum\u2019s 30 per second.\n\nFor this reason, Ethereum is a faster and more practical peer-to-peer payment system than Bitcoin according to many analysts and observers in the industry.\n\nEnergy Consumption/Staking\n\nBoth Bitcoin and Ethereum use proof of work (PoW) protocol. Proof of Work is a mechanism for networks to validate information recorded on their blockchains and is used widely in cryptocurrency mining for new tokens.\n\nOutside of congestion and lag times with proof of work protocols, proof of stake consumes enormous energy. While Ethereum plans to move to proof of stake (PoS) technology, Bitcoin will remain with PoW. PoS substitutes computational power with staking\u2014making it less energy-intensive\u2014and replaces miners with validators.\n\nCurrently, machines performing the \u201cwork\u201d for Bitcoin consume vast amounts of energy primarily sourced from fossil fuels.\n\nBitcoin Energy Consumption Worldwide, 2017 to 2023 (Source: Statista)\n\nPer year, Bitcoin\u2019s carbon footprint is comparable to the carbon footprint of the Czech Republic. Its power consumption compares to Thailand, and its small IT equipment waste is on par with the Netherlands.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t even take into account what one single Bitcoin transaction wastes. One transaction is equivalent to the carbon footprint of 2,645,939 VISA transactions or 198,972 hours of watching YouTube, wastes about as much power as an average U.S. household over 73.36 days, and wastes about as much electricity as the weight of 2.18 iPhones 12 or 0.73 iPads. In short, Bitcoin is undeniably wasteful and can be seen as an ecological hazard.\n\nBy contrast, Ethereum is said to be \u201cvirtually unrecognizable in energy consumption\u201d after numerous hard forks that have made transactions less power-intensive. As seen in the graphic below, Ethereum\u2019s new Proof-of-Stake system utilizes fewer energy resources than PayPal, Netflix, and Airbnb.\n\n(IronMonk Solutions via Ethereum.org, sponsored) Annual Energy Consumption in TWh/yr.\n\nHow to Add Ethereum to Your IRA Account\n\nNow that we\u2019ve gone through how Ethereum differs from Bitcoin let\u2019s go through how you can add Ethereum to your IRA account. With more and more people realizing the widespread benefits of Ethereum, especially with how DeFi, NFTs, and the blockchain space continue evolving and growing, many are starting to see the long-term benefits of Ethereum and are opting to add it to their IRA accounts.\n\nBitcoin IRAs are still a new phenomenon, and Ethereum IRAs are even more recent. So it\u2019s essential to understand what to do from start to finish, especially considering how traditional brokerage accounts typically do not support crypto IRAs.\n\nIt\u2019s a simple process and takes only 4 steps.\n\nStep 1: Choose the type of IRA account you want\n\nEthereum IRA accounts, like Bitcoin IRAs or Gold and Silver IRAs, are self-managed or self-directed accounts. As the account holder, you are entirely in charge of selecting the assets in the IRA account.\n\nYou will have the option to choose between two types of self-directed retirement accounts:\n\nRoth Ethereum IRA\n\nAfter-tax retirement savings account that works just like any Roth IRA.\n\nNo upfront tax deduction with contributions.\n\nZero requirements to pay taxes later on when you retire and begin to take distributions.\n\nTraditional Ethereum IRA\n\nTax-deferred retirement savings account.\n\nContributions and gains will not be taxed.\n\nTypically tax-deductible contributions.\n\nFor 2023, annual contribution limits are $6,500 if under age 50 and $7,500 if age 50 or above (add an additional $500 to each for 2024)\n\nMust pay taxes on distributions during retirement.\n\nBeyond account type, you have to consider storage solutions and exchange solutions. Storage solutions digitally store and encrypt your crypto assets to protect them from theft or loss. Exchange solutions facilitate live crypto trading.\n\nStep 2: Use a reputable Ethereum IRA company to set up your account\n\nEthereum IRA accounts are self-managed; however, it\u2019s essential to partner with a trusted third-party custodian to help set up your account. In reality, though, a reputable custodian does so much more. They provide FDIC insurance and technical support, ensure full IRS compliance, and handle all storage and exchange solutions.\n\nWhen choosing a provider, make sure to exercise discretion and go with one that provides all the required services. They must also understand crypto just as much as retirement accounts. Most importantly, they must have a sterling reputation from multiple sources and a strong track record.\n\nStep 3: Fund your account\n\nThere are several ways you can choose to fund your IRA account. You can do a direct bank transfer, IRA rollover, or direct IRA-to-IRA transfer. A top-notch IRA custodian can help facilitate any of these if you want to start an Ethereum IRA.\n\nCustodians are especially useful when it comes to rollovers, aka transferring funds from an existing IRA or any employer-sponsored account (barring restrictions) to a new Ethereum IRA.\n\nStep 4: Choose your assets\n\nJust because it\u2019s called an Ethereum IRA doesn\u2019t mean you have to limit yourself to only owning Ethereum. Working with your IRA provider can help you select a basket of crypto assets to hold in your retirement account and store it in secure digital wallets.\n\nThe Benefits of an Ethereum IRA\n\nThere are several benefits that an Ethereum IRA can offer you.\n\n1. Diversification\n\nWhether or not you are a crypto bull, crypto is now an asset class, just as any equity sector or commodity. In today\u2019s economic and geopolitical environment, diversifying with multiple asset classes, including crypto, is paramount.\n\nYou can see it first hand too, when you compare the returns of Ethereum to those of Bitcoin, Gold, Silver, Copper, and Dow Jones, S&P 500, and Nasdaq ETFs. When Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24, 2022, Ethereum was the biggest gainer among these assets, dwarfing the others with a 33% rally all the way into April.\n\n(IronMonk Solutions via Stockcharts, sponsored) Returns of Ethereum to those of Bitcoin, Gold, Silver, Copper, and Dow Jones, S&P 500, and Nasdaq ETFs.\n\nMany reputable financial sources recommend allocating a portion of your portfolio to crypto assets. Fidelity\u2019s Bitcoin Investment Thesis suggests dedicating 5% of a multi-asset portfolio to Bitcoin. Other studies, however, say to allocate assets into other cryptos, namely a 2019 Yale study that recommended allocating 4% to 6% towards a basket of cryptos. Many other financial advisors, CFPs, and financial experts are beginning to adopt a roughly 1% to 5% asset allocation recommendation. Within one\u2019s crypto portfolio, a more recent 2023 report indicated that a 50-50 or 60-40 Bitcoin and Ethereum split may help maximize one\u2019s returns.\n\n2. IRS-Compliant\n\nEthereum IRA accounts are fully IRS-compliant for one simple reason. The IRS sees crypto as a capital asset, like any other security. Therefore, it is fully acceptable under IRS guidelines to hold cryptocurrencies in an IRA.\n\nYou should be fine as long as you aren\u2019t purchasing life insurance, a collectible, or directly violating the Internal Revenue Code Section 4975(c).\n\n3. Tax benefits\n\nThe tax benefits of an IRA account are their strongest selling point over a regular bank account, or in this case, a crypto wallet. Tax benefits work the same way for Ethereum IRA accounts as with any traditional IRA account. You need to make sure you pick the right one, though.\n\nLike other types of IRA accounts, Ethereum in an IRA is a capital gains tax shelter. Depending on the type of IRA you choose, you can have tax deductions for deposits or tax-deferred or tax-free growth on earnings.\n\nHowever, what makes an Ethereum IRA especially attractive is that dealing with crypto taxes is a headache. Not only do you have to account for capital gains any time you sell crypto at a profit for USD or any other fiat currency. To ensure tax compliance, you must physically record every trade and document precisely what each trade gained. With an Ethereum IRA, you don\u2019t have to worry about that nonsense.\n\n4. Exposure to Ethereum\u2019s rise and Web3\n\nEthereum is one of the most exciting investible digital assets today. The short-term rise of Ethereum has been more apparent when compared to Bitcoin and the broader equity markets.\n\nLong term, Ethereum has a robust development roadmap that can offer enormous potential, significantly as it upgrades to Ethereum 2.0. Moreover, because of Ethereum\u2019s programmability, it not only gives you exposure to booming DeFi and dApp spaces. It powers an NFT space that\u2019s more than just pricey animations. Digital Journal says the global NFT market could multiply by nearly 5x at a 23.3% CAGR by 2028 and could power the next iteration of the internet: Web 3.0.\n\nUnderstanding the Cons\n\nEthereum\u2019s long-term potential is clear. Yet, before adding it to your IRA, understand some of the cons and drawbacks first.\n\nFirst and foremost, there are significant volatility risks. Ethereum\u2019s volatility even compared to Bitcoin, is high. Yes, Ethereum has massive return potential and has crushed other asset classes ever since its inception and recently. Yet, with significant returns come big risks and instability.\n\nFor instance, we discussed how well Ethereum had performed ever since the Ukraine invasion. However, if you backtrack and look at its 1-year chart, you can see violent price swings and distinct peaks and valleys in 2022 and 2023. Don\u2019t be alarmed by this, as such price movements are typical of crypto assets and newer assets perceived as riskier. While price actions such as these are capitalized upon by traders, these assets have trended upward in value since they were first introduced.\n\n(IronMonk Solutions via YCharts, sponsored) ETH-USD price chart August 2022 to 2023.\n\nOpportunity costs are another issue. Allocating a certain amount of funds in your IRA to a particular asset, such as Ethereum, uses up precious, limited contribution space ($6,500-7,000 per year) that could go towards other assets. Crypto IRAs typically come with higher minimum investment requirements than other IRAs. That doesn\u2019t even include recurring management, custodial, and maintenance fees, which, mind you, are typically higher. Not to mention the complex fee structures that most Ethereum IRA providers possess.\n\nSigns also look like increased regulation for crypto is inevitable, as President Biden signed an executive order in March 2022 calling for a broader federal strategy for regulating digital assets.\n\nTop 5 Ethereum IRA Companies\n\nIf you want to start an Ethereum IRA, choosing a high-quality Ethereum IRA provider is easily the most critical step. Ensure your due diligence and go with a provider that offers the following characteristics:\n\nLongevity\n\nEase of Use\n\nRatings and Customer Reviews\n\nFees\n\nStorage Capabilities\n\nFounder and Executive Team\n\nData Security and Customer Safety\n\nCustomer Service\n\nConsidering these characteristics, we made your research a little bit easier with this list of our exclusive list of the top 5 Ethereum IRA companies.

        "title": "3 reasons why Ether price is still pinned below $1,900 - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Ether's price has been locked within a tight trading range spanning from $1,800 to $1,900 since July 21. This remarkable lack of volatility has instilled a sense of uncertainty and skepticism among investors, despite recent positive developments, which include the launch of PayPal\u2019s Ethereum-based stablecoin and a surge in requests for Ether-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\n\nPayPal\u2019s entrance into the world of cryptocurrencies could signify a major step toward mainstream adoption for Ethereum. However, this move also raises concerns about centralization and the potential loss of control over personal assets.\n\nAt the same time, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission has recently witnessed a surge in applications for Ether (ETH) ETFs, which mirrors a trend of major asset management firms seeking to establish spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs.\n\nETH\u2019s drop in DApp deposits and active users is concerning\n\nThe Ethereum network is having problems because of high gas fees, which are the costs for transactions, including those done with smart contracts. For the past two months, the average transaction fee has been more than $4, which limited the demand for its decentralized apps (DApps).\n\nEthereum network applications' total deposits in ETH. Source: DefiLlama\n\nThere has been a noticeable decline in the total value locked (TVL) of deposits on the Ethereum network. This decrease marked the lowest TVL level observed over the past three years, as reported by DefiLlama.\n\nWhile there may have been some shifts in this trend over the past week, the current scenario still reflects a substantial reduction in Ether deposits, specifically around 12.9 million, in contrast to the 14.75 million recorded three months ago.\n\nTo ascertain whether the decline in Ethereum\u2019s TVL correlates with a decline in its user base, investors should monitor the utilization of DApps. It\u2019s important to note that certain DApps, such as gaming platforms and marketplaces, do not require substantial deposits.\n\nEthereum's 30-day DApp activity. Source: DappRadar\n\nThe number of active addresses using DApps is down, which is concerning. In the last 30 days, the main DApps on Ethereum had 25% fewer active users. This might reflect that investors aren\u2019t satisfied with how much it costs to transact on the network.\n\nExamining Ether derivatives can help to figure out whether the $1,800 level could actually prove a reliable support level based on how ETH investors are positioned.\n\nDerivatives metrics show balanced demand between bulls and bears\n\nEther quarterly futures are popular among whales and arbitrage desks. However, these fixed-month contracts typically trade at a slight premium to spot markets, indicating that sellers are asking for more money to delay settlement. As a result, ETH futures contracts in healthy markets should trade at a 5 to 10% annualized premium \u2014 a situation known as contango, which is not unique to crypto markets.\n\nEther 3-month futures annualized premium. Source: Laevitas\n\nAs per the futures premium, also referred to as the basis indicator, professional traders in the Ether market have remained unable to adopt a bullish stance since July 16. The current level of 5% hovers on the brink of a neutral-to-bearish threshold, indicating a state of equilibrium in demand between leveraged long and short positions.\n\nRelated: NFT project y00ts to return $3M grant as it ditches Polygon for Ethereum\n\nThe unveiling of Coinbase's Base network on Aug. 9 could contribute to Ether\u2019s challenge of surpassing the $1,900 mark. Several development teams within the ecosystem have announced their offerings for the Base network, which presently incorporates a version of the decentralized exchange Uniswap.\n\nWhile Ether\u2019s bullish prospects are fueled by the potential approval of an ETF and the substantial user base facilitated by PayPal\u2019s stablecoin, the network finds itself confronted by competition from existing smart contract platforms and challengers with ample resources. Such a scenario introduces an element of uncertainty surrounding the resilience of the $1,800 support level.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

        "content": "Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong says that the scaling solutions for Ethereum (ETH) have a better adoption rate than Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) Lightning Network.\n\nIn a recent earnings call, Armstrong says that Ethereum\u2019s scaling solutions, such as Polygon (MATIC), Optimism (OP) and Arbitrum (ARB), are seeing heavy adoption.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been taking a fresh look at it [Lightning Network], and there\u2019s been a number of really great teams from different companies working on open source solutions and some proprietary ones that are trying to help advance the state of technology there.

They just want to pay for something and it \u2018just works.\u2019\n\nI think what needs to happen, and this is something Coinbase can really help with is we can make this seamless in the background.\n\nIf somebody goes to pay for something online or a friend or a remittance payment or something like that, it should really negotiate \u2014 almost do a handshake underneath that would say, OK, what types of cryptocurrencies on what chains and is this recipient accepting, and which ones do I have? And it would basically do the bridge or the conversion in real time for you underneath. And so, you would just see the amount of dollars or something like that going over the wire, and it arrives in one second with $0.01\u2026\n\nAnd you don\u2019t have to worry about Layer 2 and all these kinds of things.

        "content": "The number of Ethereum non-zero addresses, meaning addresses that hold at least some amount of Ether, just reached an all-time high. According to data from Glassnode, this metric which counts only externally owned addresses just reached an all-time high of 104,127,318. But what does this mean for the price of Ethereum?\n\nEthereum Non-Zero Addresses Reach New All-Time High\n\nMore addresses mean more people are using the network and Ethereum is in the driver\u2019s seat when it comes to most application aspects of the crypto industry. As a result, the Ethereum blockchain has seen the highest growth rate in new addresses in recent years.\n\nThis growth has been particularly high as more people flock to decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), the majority of which are built on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nAs of the time of writing, there are now 104,127,318 Ethereum addresses holding at least one wei, the smallest unit of ETH. Just around two years ago in 2021, this metric was around 50 million addresses, showing a 100% jump during this time.\n\nAlthough only a fraction of these wallets are active, the high number of non-zero addresses shows the sheer increase in ETH adoption. In the same vein, the number of non-zero Bitcoin addresses only recently reached an all-time high of 47.8 million addresses.\n\nMore Addresses Means Increased Network Activity and Adoption\n\nThe growing interest in trading, smart contracts, DeFi, and NFTs will continue to boost the number of Ethereum users and non-zero addresses, especially now that the industry sits on the cusp of a possible bull run.\n\nETH bulls continue to hold above $1,800 | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nAccording to a similar metric by Glassnode Alerts, the amount of Ethereum supply last active within a seven to 10-year timeframe also just reached n new all-time high of 4.312 million ETH. This extended state of inactivity is suggestive of HODLing and long-term faith on the part of investors.\n\nBullish For The Price Of ETH\n\nIn the past, major rallies in Ether\u2019s price have coincided with a surge in new addresses on the network. During the 2021 bull run, Ethereum saw a flurry of new addresses and non-zero addresses, as its price reached an all-time high of $4,810.\n\nAs mainstream interest and adoption of Ethereum grow, the value and price of Ether (ETH) are likely to increase. Non-zero addresses mean activity on many addresses is increasing, which can create buy pressure in addition to other factors that should push ETH\u2019s price higher.\n\nAdditionally, investment companies are looking to launch exchange-traded funds (ETFs) tied to Ethereum futures, which could propel a spike in ETH\u2019s price.\n\nRight now, ETH is currently trading at $1,852 and is looking to break above the resistance being mounted at $2,000 by the bears.\n\nFeatured image from iStock, chart from Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Base, the Ethereum layer-2 network built with Optimism\u2019s OP stack, is officially opening its doors today.\n\nCoinbase first revealed its intention to build Base in February, when CEO Brian Armstrong detailed what he was calling \u201cThe Coinbase Secret Master Plan.\u201d\n\nThe launch of Base\u2019s mainnet marks an important milestone of this plan, Jesse Pollak, head of protocols at Coinbase, told Blockworks.\n\nDevelopers have had access to Base since July 13, and a number of users have already bridged their ETH to the layer-2 network through a portal proxy contract. Members of crypto\u2019s \u201cdegen\u201d community also moved to make themselves at home on Base once the doors were ostensibly opened.\n\nAt launch, more than 100 decentralized apps (dapps) and service providers will operate on the network.\n\n\u200b\u200bIn the first week of what Base is calling \u201con-chain summer,\u201d users can mint multiple NFT designs and artworks to celebrate the launch. A handful of ecosystems and dapps will also be publicly available for users, including prominent players such as Uniswap, Aave and Compound.\n\n\u201cWe really see Base as the place to bring the next billion people on-chain,\u201d Pollak said. \u201cA lot of that is because of our ability to integrate that into those consumer experiences and make everything really easy to use.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s next for Base?\n\nBase\u2019s developers are working with Optimism and actively looking into ways to continue decentralizing.\n\nA Leader Election proposal is currently in the works, which Pollak describes as a first milestone to decentralized sequencing.\n\nThe team is also in touch with Espresso Systems, who has recently revealed a testnet version of the Espresso Sequencer.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a great illustration of the approach we\u2019re taking with the OP stack and Base,\u201d Pollak said. \u201cRather than trying to do it all ourselves, we\u2019re leveraging the magic of decentralization and saying: Hey, we have this open-source technology stack, it\u2019s customizable, it\u2019s modular, it\u2019s built to be pluggable.\u201d\n\nThe Base and Optimism teams are also working with other ecosystem contributors to explore zkEVM technology and how it could be incorporated into the OP stack.\n\n\u201cI feel pretty blessed and lucky that we are in a position where there are all these incredible teams that are seeing the OP stack as a shelling point and are contributing to it in a really meaningful way,\u201d Pollak said.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nDeLabs\u2019 NFT profile picture (PFP) project y00ts has already made one migration, from Solana to Ethereum scaling network Polygon earlier this year\u2014and it\u2019s about to take another trip, migrating over to Ethereum mainnet to live alongside the startup\u2019s more prominent DeGods collection.\n\nThe news was announced late Wednesday afternoon in the run-up to the reveal of DeGods' \u201cSeason 3\u201d content. DeGods is a valuable PFP collection that also previously migrated over from Solana this past spring. DeLabs has yet to reveal a date for the migration, which was a surprise move given all of the buzz around the original shift away from Solana.\n\n\u201cPolygon Labs has been a truly incredible partner for y00ts,\u201d said DeLabs founder Rohun \u201cFrank\u201d Vora, in a press release. \u201cBut ultimately, we believe it makes the most sense for y00ts to be on the same chain as DeGods.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n3. The migration date will be announced shortly. pic.twitter.com/5YVgyCg2cV \u2014 y00ts (@y00tsNFT) August 9, 2023\n\nPolygon Labs, a company that supports the development of the Polygon blockchain and projects built on it, had given DeLabs a $3 million grant as part of the agreement to move from Solana. The funds were going to be used to expand the DeLabs team, which had agreed to help incubate and support other Polygon projects.\n\nToday, DeLabs said that the entire grant will be returned to Polygon Labs as the project departs the Polygon ecosystem. Polygon Labs, for its part, said that $1 million of the returned funds will be put towards supporting \u201cPolygon-native builders and creators,\u201d with details to be revealed at a later date.\n\n\u201cWe tried our best to make it work, but we just need to bring our two communities together,\u201d Frank added in a tweet. \u201cI would appreciate it if everyone remains respectful of all parties involved. It\u2019s all love.\u201d\n\nIn a press release, Polygon co-founder Sandeep Nailwal pointed to what he says is significant growth for the Polygon PFP ecosystem, noting that DeLabs \u201cplayed a huge role\u201d in driving that.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe will continue to nurture this community that\u2019s tripled in size this year by redeploying the y00ts funds,\u201d said Nailwal, \u201cand more to support our native creators and projects we believe have the vision and conviction to help evolve NFTs, both as an artform and as a key to boundless utility.\u201d\n\nThe market has reacted positively to the news, apparently, with the floor price\u2014or the price of the cheapest listed NFT in the project\u2014on the OpenSea marketplace jumping from 1.7 ETH (about $3,150) earlier today to about 2.09 ETH ($3,880) shortly after the news broke, although it has settled slightly to about 2 ETH ($3,710).\n\nDeGods is one of the most valuable NFT projects on the market. According to data from NFT Price Floor, it\u2019s the third-most valuable PFP project on the market for a collection with at least 10,000 pieces, at an entry price of 8.75 ETH\u2014about $16,240 worth as of this writing."

        "content": "On August 9th, the NFT community eagerly tuned in to witness the unfolding of Frank DeGods\u2019 pivotal announcements regarding his NFT projects, DeGods and y00ts. While the anticipated revelations did not disappoint, they also sparked a compelling conversation about the potential impact on y00ts\u2019 value and status within the NFT realm.\n\nTransitioning to Ethereum: The Big Step for y00ts\n\nAt approximately 5:30 pm ET, the first announcement reverberated across the NFT landscape: y00ts would be migrating from Polygon to Ethereum. This migration, though fraught with promise, has raised valid concerns within the community. The timing of the migration, while yet to be confirmed, marks a significant shift for y00ts, raising questions about its perceived value in relation to other NFTs.\n\nPolygon y00ts\n\nThis strategic shift in migrating y00ts from Polygon to Ethereum, while laden with potential benefits, carries implications that extend beyond the immediate NFT landscape. The decision to depart from Polygon, a platform that had provided a substantial grant as part of the original move, could be perceived as a nuanced challenge for the Polygon ecosystem. The return of the grant funds, which were initially intended to incentivize growth, marks an unexpected turn in the relationship between y00ts and Polygon. This move could be interpreted as a momentary black eye for Polygon, raising questions about its ability to retain high-profile projects and ensure the longevity of partnerships in the rapidly evolving world of blockchain and NFTs.\n\n1. y00ts will be migrating to Ethereum. \u2014 y00ts (@y00tsNFT) August 9, 2023\n\nValue Dilution and the Second-Tier Conundrum\n\nThe announcement of y00ts\u2019 migration has brought forth a mixed sentiment within the NFT sphere. While Ethereum\u2019s broader liquidity and reach are undeniably appealing, some stakeholders worry that this move could potentially lead to a dilution of y00ts\u2019 value. The transition to the Ethereum mainnet begs the question: will y00ts maintain their standing as a unique and valuable NFT collection, or will they be relegated to a second-tier status in the broader Ethereum NFT landscape?\n\nMarket Dynamics and Response: Uncertainty Breeds Volatility\n\nIn response to the announcement, the subsequent overnight volatility signaled a more nuanced narrative. A portion of holders exhibited caution, resulting in a decline of the floor price to 1.7 ETH. This downturn, equating to an 8% reduction on the day and a staggering 23% decline from a recent local peak, underscores the market\u2019s uncertainty and the delicate balance that the y00ts migration seeks to navigate.\n\nIn Search of Balance: Innovating without Compromising\n\nFrank DeGods\u2019 announcements on August 9th have ushered in a period of introspection and contemplation within the NFT community. The move to Ethereum is undoubtedly a testament to the project\u2019s commitment to embracing technology and innovation. However, the potential implications for y00ts\u2019 value have also ignited an essential conversation about maintaining uniqueness and desirability within a broader, more expansive ecosystem.\n\nTL;DR: Frank DeGods\u2019 decision to migrate y00ts to Ethereum has sparked discussions about the potential impact on y00ts\u2019 value and position within the NFT space. While the move offers access to Ethereum\u2019s liquidity, concerns have arisen about the potential dilution of y00ts\u2019 value and whether they might become second-tier NFTs within the Ethereum ecosystem."

        "content": "Coinbase, a leading U.S. crypto exchange, officially launched Base, its Ethereum layer 2 network, to the general public on August 9, 2023.\n\nThe Base testnet launched in February, followed by a developer-specific release in July. Built on Optimism\u2019s software stack known as the OP Stack, Base operates as a rollup network, a scaling solution that processes transactions off the main Ethereum (ETH) blockchain, providing a more efficient and affordable network for decentralized applications (dApps).\n\nBetting on Base\n\nSince its inception, Base has integrated with a wide array of crypto projects, including DeFi protocols, wallets, bridges, oracles, analytics, and infrastructure providers.\n\nUnlike other layer-2 networks like Arbitrum and Optimism, Coinbase has confirmed that it has no plans to introduce any native tokens to Base. Pollak insisted that tokens \u201cdistort\u201d what is being done on a network, something Coinbase would rather avoid in favor of focusing on incubating developers.\n\nThe launch of Base aligns with Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong\u2019s vision for the fourth phase of the company\u2019s development, aimed at mass adoption through decentralized apps. The new network is anticipated to become the default network for Coinbase\u2019s on-chain products.\n\nIn connection with the Base launch, Coinbase announced plans for corporate partnerships, including with Coca-Cola, to showcase the new project\u2019s capabilities, and it emphasizes integration into daily life rather than mere speculation.\n\nThe launch of Base represents a significant step forward in the evolution of blockchain technology, opening new opportunities for developers, users, and the broader crypto ecosystem."

        "content": "PayPal has long been interested in the evolving crypto landscape, but with its recent stablecoin announcement, the payments giant is taking its involvement to the next level.\n\nPayPal, one of the world\u2019s largest online payment systems, has introduced its own stablecoin, called PayPal USD (PYUSD). The ERC-20 stablecoin will be pegged by the \u201cdollar deposits, US treasuries, and cash equivalents.\u201d Upon the rollout, PYUSD is set to launch on Ethereum and is worth $1.\n\nPayPal\u2019s Stablecoin Could be Huge\n\nThe stablecoin is a collaborative effort of PayPal and Paxos to revolutionize the digital payment landscape and Web3. According to PayPal, it is designed to be compatible with popular exchanges, Web3 apps, and wallets.\n\nUsers can register for the initial $PYUSD distribution by connecting their crypto wallets, such as MetaMask, Ronin Wallet, Coinbase, and Ledger Live.\n\nUsers can buy, sell, send, and receive PayPal USD in the app or on the website with zero transaction fee. PayPal also enables customers to convert the stablecoin into other cryptos for a fee.\n\nIn the initial phase, buying, selling, holding, and transferring PYUSD are accessible exclusively to eligible US PayPal Balance accounts. But there are plans to extend its remittance support to the Venmo app in the near future.\n\nThe introduction of PYUSD is projected to boost its appeal within the cryptocurrency and Web3 sectors, with functionalities like facilitating shopping and crypto token trading. The long-term vision for PYUSD, as expressed by PayPal CEO Dan Schulman in a conversation with Bloomberg, is for it to become an integral part of the broader payments infrastructure.\n\nSchulman is confident that PYUSD will further solidify PayPal\u2019s market dominance in the electronic payments realm by offering users a speedy blockchain-based transfer option that bypasses intermediaries. This ambitious initiative by PayPal and Paxos is poised to shape the future of financial transactions and foster greater convenience for users in the digital age.\n\nPaxos and PayPal announced their partnership in 2020. Back at that time, the two entities reportedly aimed to build innovative crypto products. It appears that the issuance of PayPal\u2019s stablecoin is part of the collaborative efforts.\n\nAccording to the original plan, the stablecoin was set to launch in February 2023. However, the project faced hurdles and delays due to Paxos\u2019 run-ins with U.S. authorities.\n\nPrior to PayPal USD, Paxos is widely known as an issuer of another stablecoin \u2013 Binance USD (BUSD). However, this stablecoin and the company fell under the radar of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nOn February 13, 2023, Wall Street Journal reported that the SEC was prepared to sue Paxos for issuing an unregistered security, in that case, BUSD.\n\nIn response to the allegations, Paxos issued a statement to voice disagreement with the SEC. The firm clarified that BUSD was not a security under federal securities laws and segregated from one another and in bankruptcy-protected bank accounts.\n\nCentralization Concern\n\nThe news that PayPal would launch a stablecoin was first revealed on August 7, 2023, on the company\u2019s official Twitter account.\n\nThe announcement quickly drew a lot of attention from the crypto community, with some people expressing excitement about the potential for the move to boost crypto adoption, while others expressed concerns about the centralization of the project.\n\nThose who favor PayPal\u2019s move argue that it will make it easier for people to buy and use cryptocurrencies.\n\nPayPal has a large user base and that the company\u2019s integration with the traditional financial system will make it easier for people to convert their fiat currency into cryptocurrencies and vice versa. Some also argue that the launch of a PayPal-backed stablecoin will help to legitimize cryptocurrencies and make them more attractive to mainstream investors.\n\nOn the other hand, some people have expressed concerns about the centralization of the project. They argue that PayPal is a centralized entity and that the company\u2019s control over the stablecoin could pose a risk to its users."

        "content": "New data from IntoTheBlock suggests there exists a huge imbalance in the distribution of wealth for the Ethereum (ETH) and Dogecoin (DOGE) ecosystems.\n\nThe firm says that about 80% of the supply of both ETH and DOGE are owned by just about 0.01% of the total addresses holding the tokens.\n\nBy comparison, 0.32% of Bitcoin (BTC) addresses own 80% of the BTC supply, according to IntoTheBlock.\n\n\u201cEver wondered about the distribution of wealth in different cryptocurrencies? Here\u2019s a snapshot:\n\nBitcoin: ~80% owned by 0.32% of addresses, including Satoshi\u2019s wallets.\n\nDogecoin: ~80% held by a mere 0.014% of addresses.\n\nEthereum: ~80% in the hands of just over 0.01%, closely resembling DOGE\u2019s pattern.\n\nThese stats are important to consider when planning your strategy, especially when dealing with assets that have a smaller market cap and/or liquidity.\u201d\n\nThe firm warns that when just a few addresses have a huge amount of a blockchain project\u2019s tokens those holders can have an outsized influence on that crypto project\u2019s ecosystem.\n\nIntoTheBlock also looks more closely at the disbursement of Bitcoin across holding wallets.\n\n\u201cWe offer a comprehensive holder composition matrix for all assets listed on our platform. Analyzing the supply concentration is essential in assessing the potential dominance of large holders within a network.\u201d\n\nAccording to the firm\u2019s chart, just four addresses have more than 100,000 Bitcoin in their wallets for a combined 660,000 BTC, worth about $19.3 billion at time of writing. That sum represents about 3.39% of the total BTC supply.\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum, about 52% of total BTC addresses, or about 25.13 million, own up to 0.001 BTC for a total of 5,120 Bitcoin, which have a combined value of $149.3 million and are about 0.03% of the total supply.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Polygon-based (MATIC) NFT collection y00ts said it would migrate to Ethereum (ETH) and return the $3 million grant it previously received from the layer2 network, according to an Aug. 10 tweet.\n\ny00ts did not provide additional information on when the migration would occur. It said:\n\n\u201cThe migration date will be announced shortly.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the NFT collection explained that it was migrating to the layer1 blockchain network because it was \u201ctime to unite the DeGods & y00ts communities.\u201d\n\nThe founder of the projects, Rohun Vora, aka Frank DeGods, further stated that the move was necessary to unite the communities on one network. He said:\n\n\u201cWe tried our best to make it work but we just need to bring our 2 communities together. I would appreciate it if everyone remains respectful of all parties involved.\u201d\n\nDeGods and y00ts NFT collections were launched by DeLabs originally on Solana (SOL).

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nCoinbase has launched the mainnet for Base, its Ethereum layer-2 network, as part of its bid to spur the development of millions of new decentralized apps.\n\nAfter months in development, Coinbase is launching its Base through a month-long launch event called Onchain Summer. Since it was announced last week, the enthusiasm around Base has been strong with just over $142 million in total value locked in the ecosystem, an almost 52% increase in total value locked from the week leading up to the launch, according to Dune Analytics.\n\n\"I think it's incredibly exciting that there's been so much energy and appetite for folks to come and use Base, even before we publicly launched,\" said Jesse Pollak, Coinbase\u2019s senior director of engineering, in an interview with Decrypt.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPollak characterized Base's launch as part of a more ambitious plan of bringing millions of more users on-chain, and doing that means showcasing more of what can be done with the technology than just focusing around cryptocurrencies.\n\nPart of this effort is being demonstrated with the more than 100 decentralized apps (dapp) that will be available with Base\u2019s launch, a portion of which were created by developers who received early access to the blockchain last month.\n\nUnlike other layer-2 networks, like Arbitrum and Optimism, Pollak insists that Coinbase has no plans to introduce any native tokens to Base. He said tokens \"distort\" what is being done on a network, something Coinbase would rather avoid in favor of focusing on incubating developers.\n\n\"We want folks to see Base as kind of an opportunity for growth and expansion,\" explained Pollak. \"But we also think it's really important that we incubate, and curate a Base native community where folks who are really building base first, and creating for this new kind of world.\"\n\nBy not issuing a token, Coinbase may also be avoiding a regulatory minefield at a time when it is already facing serious legal pressure. On June 6, Coinbase was sued by the Securities and Exchange Commission for allegedly operating as an unlicensed securities exchange. The agency also accused Coinbase of dealing in unregistered securities, among which it said were popular tokens like Solana, Polygon and Cardano.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPollak said the SEC's lawsuit is unlikely to derail work on Base, because it is aimed at areas of Coinbase\u2019s business that are not directly related to the ecosystem that it is trying to foster.\n\n\"That pursuit is something that is pretty separate and distinct from the questions that the SEC is asking around tokens and regulating them,\" said Pollak, adding that Coinbase has been \"really encouraged\" by recent legislative and judicial changes around crypto regulation that he hopes will mean clearer regulatory clarity is forthcoming."

Discover SCENE\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin said the crypto community had reservations about Sam Bankman-Fried and FTX from the beginning, despite Bankman-Fried's high profile in the mainstream media as an industry leader.\n\n\"I think a lot of people have this misconception that everybody deeply respected Sam and that he caught the entire ecosystem by surprise,\" Buterin said in a podcast interview with Sriram Krishnan and Aarthi Ramamurthy. \u201cI think it is true that nobody expected a literal $8 billion blow up, but if you're looking at Ethereum influencers like Anthony Sassano, a lot of them disrespected him and FTX from the beginning.\"\n\nKrishnan and Aarthi interview founders, CEOs, and film makers on their eponymous podcast, which featured Buterin last month.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nButerin went on to explain that many in the crypto ecosystem were suspicious of Bankman-Fried because he seemed unable to articulate a coherent vision for why cryptocurrency technology was valuable.\n\n\"He was just not able to articulate a vision of why crypto was good\u2014he just clearly saw it as purely a business opportunity,\" Buterin recalled. \"It's like, 'Oh, hey, crypto is this thing where you can make money.'\"\n\nButerin contrasted Bankman-Fried's outlook with the cypherpunk values and decentralization goals that initially animated Bitcoin, Ethereum and other blockchain projects, saying the disgraced entrepreneur was just \"regurgitating other people's perspectives of 'disintermediation is good, creating more open markets is good'\u2014things that have been said by influencers for years.\"\n\n\"He just, I think, never really struck the community as a person who deeply believed it,\" he said. \"That more than anything else might really be the cause of the mistrust that existed already.\"\n\nThe Ethereum founder also touched on the rapid progress of artificial intelligence systems like ChatGPT, expressing optimism about their potential to augment human creativity rather than fully replace human jobs and talents.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\"I think one of the positive aspects of this is that I think it's a good example of how, instead of AI killing 30% of the jobs, which would be catastrophic and terrible, it's like, AI is killing 30% of your job, which is like actually an amazing time saver,\" Buterin said.\n\nHe acknowledged that more jobs will be lost as AI approaches full human capabilities, but that for now, AI is something to be embraced.\n\n\"At this stage one, the last section of the sprint's to human level AI, that aspect of things is interesting\u2014it's empowering people with more than replacing people, at least so far,\" Buterin said.\n\nHe also suggested that powerful AI tools like image generators could help individual creators make films and other artistic works without the need for an expensive Hollywood-style production.\n\n\"The thing happening that we don't want to see is artists getting replaced; the thing that I wants to see is an author, instead of just being able to write a novel, also being able to personally make a movie,\" Buterin said. \"I would want to see the cost of making a movie go down from $100,000 to one person with basically just his creativity and a couple of months with an AI platform.\"\n\nIn his view, disrupting Hollywood would be a good thing.\n\n\"We get away from all of these horrible remixes, like, Marvel fights King Kong with a touch of Star Trek versus Star Wars on the side, \" he said. \"Get to actual real stories reflecting different people's values.\"\n\n\"That enhancement of existing individual creativity, that excites me,\" Buterin told his hosts.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIndeed, the Ethereum founder positioned AI as one of the most significant developments in all of history.\n\n\"This human to superhuman AI transition, that level of transition, I would argue has only happened basically three or four times in the history of the Earth,\" he said.\n\nBut Buterin also acknowledged the need for more research and potentially some limited regulation around advanced AI to address possible risks down the line. He emphasized that any rules should be narrowly targeted rather than sweeping bans that would hinder innovation.\n\n\"I see these really compelling arguments from the AI risk people. But then, like, we have a yet a long, multi 100 year history of people predicting all kinds of really awful consequences to the next wave of technology. What's happened, over and over again, for centuries, is we adapt.\"\n\nEditor\u2019s note: This article was written with the assistance of AI. Edited and fact-checked by Ryan Ozawa."

        "content": "On the back of Ripple\u2019s partial win over the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), activity on the blockchain has ramped up quickly. This increase has now seen XRP beat out market leader Ethereum when it comes to the number of daily transactions carried out on the blockchain.\n\nRipple Leading The Pack\n\nWhile the euphoria from Judge Analisa Torres\u2019s ruling has been waning, there is still enough left to continue to drive new milestones on Ripple\u2019s XRP Ledger. The most prominent of these has been the number of transactions that are being carried out on the Ledger since the ruling.\n\nDespite ending the month of July on a low note, the transactions have picked up in August. According to data from BitInfoCharts, daily transactions on the Ripple Ledger have consistently crossed 1 million since the start of August.\n\nThis puts XRPL ahead of leading blockchains such as Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC), both of which have seen daily transaction figures come out below 1 million this month. On August 2, which has been the best day of the month so far for Ripple, transaction figures crossed 1.3 million, compared to 1.04 million for Ethereum and 390,000 for Bitcoin.\n\nXRP daily transactions rise above Ethereum | Source: BitInfoCharts\n\nThe new milestone comes after XRP first experienced a sharp drop in July. But since then, the blockchain has been on an upward trajectory. According to the present data, the XRP Network carried out 1.1173 million transactions on Thursday, August 9, almost double the number of its July 29 low of 612,000.\n\nHowever, despite the rise in transaction numbers, XRP continues to lag behind Bitcoin and Ethereum in terms of volume. Coinmarketcap data shows Bitcoin\u2019s volume over the last day was $14 billion, Ethereum was in second with $4.2 billion, while XRP volume came in at $1.7 billion.\n\nToken price falls from local peak following court ruling | Source: XRPUDST on Tradingview.com\n\nSEC\u2019s Appeal Brings Down The XRP Momentum\n\nXRP had undoubtedly enjoyed a huge boost following Judge Analisa Torres\u2019 partial summary judgment in favor of Ripple in its ongoing case against the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nXRP experienced a massive spike from $0.47 to $0.81 (+72%) on the 13th of July (the day the partial summary judgment was given). However, it has since then retracted to the present zone. The token has maintained its current price range since the start of August with no significant movement upwards since then.\n\nFurthermore, the SEC\u2019s intention to file an interlocutory appeal may also draw down XRP\u2019s momentum. In fact, XRP has reacted negatively to the aforementioned news as it is trading at around $0.6293, down 2.24% in the last 24 hours.\n\nFeatured image from iStock, chart from Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "Why an Ethereum ETF could be on the cards - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "The launch of PYUSD had little to no impact on the market.\n\nAnalysts opined that regulators would approve several Ethereum futures ETFs.\n\nThis year, the evolution of the cryptocurrency market has been marked by various milestones. First, it was the approval of a leveraged Bitcoin [BTC] Exchange Traded Fund (ETF). Now, payment giant PayPal has confirmed the integration of stablecoins into its platform with the launch of PayPal USD [PYUSD].\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s ETH\u2019s market cap in BTC\u2019s terms\n\nThe success of these developments signaled the growing acceptance of cryptocurrencies in mainstream finance. For a while, the ecosystem has been evolving and converging with traditional financial systems.\n\nBut the question on many minds now is whether the regulatory landscape and market demand are aligning to pave the way for co-participation in the traditional and blockchain sectors. Could an Ethereum [ETH] ETF be the next logical step?\n\nPYUSD fails to impact the market\n\nAs of this period, the crypto market had slipped a bit from the highs registered in Q1. Fortunately, the development would prove to have a positive impact on BTC\u2019s price and the broader market.\n\nBeyond the approved leveraged ETFs, the U.S. SEC could also be in line to approve multiple Bitcoin Spot ETFs, according to Cathie Wood.\n\nWood, the CEO of asset management firm ARK Invest, said in an interview with Bloomberg on 7 August,\n\n\u201cI think the SEC, if it\u2019s going to approve a Bitcoin ETF, will approve more than one at once.\u201d\n\nHowever, the launch of PYUSD did not follow a similar market reaction to ETF acceptance. Over the last 24 hours, prices of many cryptocurrencies have either remained the same or hovered around the same point.\n\nA good day for stablecoins?\n\nOne reason for this neutrality could be the fact that stablecoins generally have a 1:1 peg to the U.S. dollar. Besides the fact that these assets are not as volatile as their other counterparts, the stablecoin market has been prone to sudden changes and challenges.\n\nFor instance, the market cap of Circle [USDC] fell as a result of the challenges banks faced by U.S. bank sometime banks. Binance USD [BUSD], on the other hand, has been increasingly decreasing as per market cap since regulators ordered a stop to its minting.\n\nThe challenges faced by these stablecoins have helped Tether [USDT] extend its dominance in the market. It also gave rise to the attention TrueUSD [TUSD] gained.\n\nAMBCrypto spoke to Harman Singh, Director at Cyphere, a security firm whose mission is to protect the digital assets of investors in the UK and the U.S. about the matter. Singh opined that PYUSD was a good move for the ecosystem, noting,\n\n\u201cThis move could also encourage other major companies to follow suit, consequently driving further growth and acceptance of digital currencies. Additionally, the introduction of a PayPal stablecoin could enhance the usability and accessibility of cryptocurrencies for everyday transactions.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the introduction of PYUSD has led to the launch of several imposters on several chains. Typically, degenerates in the ecosystem are known to deploy new tokens based on trending narratives.\n\nAnd according to information from DEX Screener, chains including Ethereum, BNB Chain, and Coinbase\u2019s L2 Base have not been left out. For example, the PYUSD/WETH pair on the Ethereum blockchain rallied as much as 22,237% 18 hours after launch with a 24-hour volume of $2.9 million.\n\nOpening the way for Ethereum ETF approval\n\nAway from Ponzis and memes, there has been speculation that the PYUSD deployment could give way to the approval of Ethereum futures ETF. One reason this speculation thrived was that PayPal decided to launch PYUSD as an ERC-20 token.\n\nAnd a few days back, Bloomberg Intelligence analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas confirmed that there have been about 12 different futures ETF applications. The duo also opined that the applications have a 75% chance of approval.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ETHs worth today?\n\nBut when asked about the chance of an Ethereum spot ETF, Seyffart said it could take some time. He said,\n\n\u201cTime will tell. But if we get spot Bitcoin ETFs AND Ether futures ETFs, it would only be a matter of time before spot Ether. Absolute utter soonest would be ~260 days from Eth futures launch if i had to guess. All becomes irrelevant if spot btc dont launch or eth futures dont launch or if SEC files a suit somewhere claiming ETH to be a security. There are A LOT of \u2018ifs\u2019\u201d\n\nSingh also commented on the Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF applications. Accoridng to him, the approval of the ETFs could foster increased institutional demand for both cryptocurrencies. He said,"

        "content": "Bitcoin and other top crypto tokens were mostly higher on Wednesday ahead of the key economic data due later this week. The entire narrative for Bitcoin has shifted towards the Bitcoin ETF, which is less volatile of late as the $30,000-mark is a critical threshold. But macros continue to weigh.\n\n\n\nBitcoin was back in action on Wednesday as the largest crypto token gained more than 2 per cent to regain 29,500-mark. However, its largest peer, Ethereum was trading higher, rising more than a per cent but could not race past $1,850-levels. Price action in the major altcoins was on the higher side.\n\n\n\nBitcoin\u2019s prices crossed $30,000 before settling at trading above the $29,500 level. This shift might be because of China's reduced trade figures for July and the US 10-year Treasury yield dropped. Over the past 24 hours, Solana, Shiba Inu, Hedera, and TonCoin gained Ethereum continuing trading between the $1,800-$1,900 range, said Edul Patel, CEO & Co-founder at Mudrex.\n\n\n\nBarring a few exceptions, all top crypto tokens were trading higher on Wednesday. Shiba Inu and Solana gained more than 5 per cent each, while Polygon gained 4 per cent. XRP rose 3 per cent, whereas Cardano, Polkadot and Litecoin added 2 per cent each. Among the losers, Bitcoin Cash and Tron were about a per cent each.\n\n\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market cap was trading significantly higher, rising up to $1.19 trillion-mark as it rose as much as 2 per cent in the last 24 hours. However, the total trading volumes surged about 13 per cent to $36.67 billion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTech View by Giottus Crypto Platform\n\nPolygon (MATIC) is experiencing a positive break following wider sentiment in the market postPaypal\u2019s new stablecoin news. The asset is showing signs of recovery suggesting a breakout from the descending channel.If successful, MATIC could hit the key 100-day moving average around the $0.80 area.\n\n\n\n\n\nIts RSI reading is currently at 45.7 and has started moving sideways, indicating that the asset may recover towards neutral territory. However, if MATIC is unable to break through the $0.75 barrier, price may fall. The most recent low (about $0.65) serves as an early support level.\n\nMajor Levels:\n\nSupport: $0.65, $0.55\n\nResistance: $0.75, $0.80, $0.90\n\n\n\n\n\n(Views and recommendations given in this section are the analysts' own and do not represent those of Business Today.

        "content": "DeLabs\u2019 NFT project, y00ts, has taken a surprising step by migrating back to the Ethereum mainnet from the Polygon scaling network. This is just ahead of the highly anticipated unveiling of DeGods\u2019 \u201cSeason 3\u201d content. While the exact migration date remains undisclosed, this move has sparked interest, debates, and discussions within the NFT community.\n\nTL;DR:\n\nDeLabs\u2019 NFT project y00ts shifts from Polygon back to Ethereum mainnet ahead of DeGods\u2019 \u201cSeason 3\u201d reveal.\n\nThe return has raised questions about project motives after migrating from Solana to Polygon with a $3 million grant.\n\nDeLabs\u2019 decision to return the grant and allocate $1 million to Polygon-native builders adds complexity to the shifting NFT landscape.\n\ny00ts \u2013 All Around The Blockchain\n\nInitially, y00ts garnered attention when it shifted from Solana to Polygon, supported by a substantial $3 million grant from Polygon Labs. This grant aimed to empower DeLabs, fostering team growth and Polygon ecosystem contributions. However, the unexpected return of y00ts to Ethereum raises questions regarding the project\u2019s motivations behind this transition.\n\nThis move comes paired with a noteworthy decision. DeLabs has opted to return the entire $3 million grant to Polygon Labs. Meanwhile, the brand allocates $1 million to support \u201cPolygon-native builders and creators.\u201d This strategic redistribution highlights the intricacies of navigating the blockchain landscape. But it also prompts responses from the NFT market.\n\nThe floor price of y00ts NFTs on OpenSea experienced a significant increase in this time. This indicates investors and collectors are closely monitoring the project\u2019s unfolding developments. In parallel, DeGods, another DeLabs creation, retains its position as a valuable NFT project in the market.\n\nThe Heavy Question: Is DeGods Rugging?\n\nAmid these strategic shifts, the NFT ecosystem eagerly anticipates the outcomes of DeLabs\u2018 decisions. The journey from Solana to Polygon and back to Ethereum underscores a willingness to explore and adapt to various blockchain environments. While the y00ts migration offers intriguing prospects, questions linger about potential synergies between y00ts and the esteemed DeGods collection on the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nThe dynamic NFT landscape thrives on continuous innovation and exploration. DeLabs\u2019 strategic choices mirror the fluidity of the ecosystem, where creators actively seek optimal platforms to showcase their collections. As DeLabs navigates these migrations, the broader NFT community observes with keen interest, eager to witness how these choices will shape both the y00ts and DeGods projects\u2019 trajectories. These moves contribute to the ongoing evolution of the NFT realm, reaffirming its status as a dynamic and ever-changing space."

        "title": "Ethereum: Historical Playbook Points To $3,800 In Coming Months - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Renowned analyst Josh Olszewicz has shared some compelling insights on Ethereum\u2019s price trajectory. Drawing parallels from historical patterns, Olszewicz\u2019s analysis suggests that Ethereum might be gearing up for a significant rally in the coming months.\n\nHistorical Pattern: Ethereum Forms Ascending Triangle\n\nOlszewicz starts by highlighting Ethereum\u2019s current price pattern, jokingly stating, \u201cEthereum: ascending triangle 450 million years in the making w/fib extensions to $3k.\u201d This ascending triangle, characterized by a flat top and rising bottom, has been forming since May 2022, and if history is any guide, it could be a bullish sign for Ethereum.\n\nDescending volume, another feature of this pattern, further strengthens the bullish bias. However, Olszewicz cautions that the \u201cbias remains bullish until price breaks below diagonal support.\u201d He also points out the psychological resistance at $2,000, noting it as an \u201cextremely obvious signal that it\u2019s go time, which should help the breakout.\u201d\n\nTo bolster his analysis, Olszewicz draws parallels from Bitcoin\u2019s past. He recalls, \u201ctake BTC in 2015/2016 [the price formed an ascending triangle for 210 days with descending volume] and BTC in 2018/2019 [ascending triangle for 130 days with descending volume] as examples.\u201d In both instances, Bitcoin surged towards the Fibonacci extension levels post the breakout.\n\nEthereum itself isn\u2019t a stranger to such patterns. Olszewicz cites, \u201cETH has also had previous examples in 2017 (bullish continuation) and 2019 (bullish reversal).\u201d Each ascending triangle pattern lasted 180 days. Both times ETH surged towards the 2.618 Fibonacci extension level.\n\nDrawing from these historical patterns, Olszewicz suggests that Ethereum is currently holding the potential to overshoot the 1.618 Fibonacci level and possibly reach the 2.618 level, which translates to a price of $3,800. However, he wisely advises, \u201cbut don\u2019t get out the imaginary profit calculator just yet, let\u2019s break $2k first.\u201d\n\nETH vs. BTC: Which One Is The Better Trade?\n\nWhile Ethereum\u2019s potential rally is intriguing, Olszewicz also delves into its performance relative to Bitcoin. He observes that Ethereum has underperformed Bitcoin year-to-date, attributing this to the ETF narrative and Bitcoin\u2019s dominance as hard money. He speculates, \u201cthe better trade may continue to be BTC/USD, especially with initial spot ETF inflows favoring BTC.\u201d\n\nHowever, if the ETH/BTC pair can break and sustain new highs, it might hint at a runaway trade for Ethereum. But Olszewicz remains skeptical, stating it\u2019s \u201cunlikely based on ETF flows.\u201d\n\nOlszewicz also doesn\u2019t shy away from discussing potential bearish scenarios. He\u2019s closely watching certain bearish ETH/BTC levels, including the current local low at 0.050 and the previous inverse head and shoulders neckline at 0.039.\n\nFor Bitcoin, he suggests a potential move to $42,000, provided it maintains certain bullish conditions. He notes, \u201cas long as we can maintain prices above the midline of the PF & stay in the cloud, we have a decent shot at reaching $42k before halving.\u201d\n\nWrapping up his analysis, Olszewicz envisions a dream trade where Bitcoin breaks bullish first, possibly due to technicals or a spot ETF approval. In this scenario, Ethereum breaks $2,000 but lags behind Bitcoin, leading to ETH/BTC getting \u201ccrushed, allowing for an eventual profit taking rotation from Bitcoin to Ethereum\u201d. However, he concludes with a word of caution: \u201cwithout inflows, we ain\u2019t movin.\u201d\n\nAt press time, ETH traded at $1,860.\n\nFeatured image from iStock, chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Image: Shutterstock\n\nPayPal's entrance into the stablecoin arena with the unveiling of the PayPal USD (PYUSD) stablecoin has sparked both excitement and scepticism within the crypto landscape. This move positions PayPal as a major player in the digital assets space, and has triggered discussions about the potential impact on the broader financial ecosystem.The Ethereum-based token would be available to PayPal users in the US, and users would be able to transfer the PYUSD tokens from their PayPal accounts to supported external wallets. As PayPal claims, the tokens can be used to make payments and convert any of the supported crypto on PayPal into or from PYUSD. The partnership between PayPal and Paxos Trust Co., the issuer of PYUSD, underscores the collaboration between traditional financial institutions and the crypto space. As PayPal gradually rolls out access to PYUSD for its U.S. customers, the stablecoin's integration with the platform may lead to increased adoption and utilisation.PayPal's stablecoin initiative has sparked comparisons to BlackRock's endorsement of Bitcoin, indicating its perceived significance within the industry. The stability and backing of PYUSD could attract broader adoption and usage, extending beyond speculative trading. Industry experts suggest that PayPal's move could inspire other major companies to explore digital asset integration.However, PayPal's entrance into the stablecoin space also raises regulatory considerations. Despite regulations in the European Union and other regions, concerns over stablecoins' systemic influence continue. The U.S. lawmakers strive to create a stablecoin regulatory structure, and PayPal's PYUSD introduction will undoubtedly engage regulators, including the Federal Reserve and the Securities and Exchange Commission. On this development, Shivam Thakral, CEO of BuyUcoin, India's second-longest-running virtual digital asset exchange, stated, \"PayPal's entry into the stablecoin market highlights the growing acceptance and usage of cryptocurrencies within conventional financial institutions and may pave the way for additional market innovation. We can expect more fintech giants to make [their] foray into the digital asset market by leveraging the combined strength of digital and traditional finance.\u201dIn light of the ongoing discussions surrounding stablecoins and their role in the future financial landscape, PayPal's PYUSD launch represents a significant step toward the mainstream acceptance of digital assets. With regulatory scrutiny and evolving legislative efforts, the stablecoin's potential impact sets the stage for a dynamic period of exploration and innovation in the crypto world."

        "title": "APY forecast: what will happen to Ethereum's staking yield? - CoinJournal",
        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nEthereum completed its long-awaited Merge upgrade in September 2022\n\nStakers are currently earning approximately 4% APY from their Ether tokens\n\n19% of the total Ether supply is staked, the lowest ratio of any of the leading coins\n\nStaking rewards are divided among stakers, meaning the APY earned decreases as more users stake\n\nDemand on the network increases gas fees and ultimately contributes to more APY, meaning there are several factors at play when trying to assess where the yield may land\n\nAll in all, it remains up for debate as to where the yield is headed, despite many analysts predicting basement-level yields of 1%-2% are inevitable\n\nThe fundamentals of Ethereum were entirely transformed in September 2022 when the Merge went live, the blockchain officially becoming a proof-of-stake consensus. The implications for this are many, however one of the more fascinating aspects is that investors can now earn a yield from staking their Ether tokens.\n\nLet\u2019s dive into how popular staking has been, where it\u2019s trending going forward, and speculate about where the all-important APY may land.\n\nEthereum stakers are increasing\n\nEthereum staking has proved wildly popular. There is currently almost 18.75% of the total supply staked. The below chart from CryptoQuant shows that not only has the increase been consistent, but the rate of increase has steepened noticeably since the Shapella upgrade in April.\n\nShapella finally allowed staked Ether to be withdrawn, with some early stakers having had tokens locked up since Q4 of 2020. There was hence some concern that Ether would be withdrawn en masse once the Shapella upgrade went live, the subsequent sell pressure bound to dent the price. Not only has this happened, but staking has only become more popular since the upgrade.\n\nDespite the popularity of Ethereum staking, and the lack of withdrawals sparked by Shapella, the network\u2019s staked tokens as a percent of the total supply still pale in comparison to other proof-of-stake blockchains.\n\nThe chart below highlights Ethereum in yellow, its 19% ratio far below the other major proof-of-stake coins. Assessing the rest of the top 10 by staked market cap, these coins average a 53% stake ratio, with only BNB Chain remotely close to Ethereum, sitting at 15%.\n\nIf we then shift the chart to assess the total market cap of the staked portion of coins, Ethereum\u2019s dominance is clear. Its 19% staked tokens carry a value of $43 billion \u2013 more than the other nine cryptos\u2019 staked market caps combined.\n\nEthereum\u2019s low staked ratio implies that it should have more, at least if other coins can be used as a benchmark. This is especially true when considering recent bullish developments on the Ethereum network which suggest it may be solidifying its place as the market-leading smart contract platform. Most notable of these could be discussion around potential Ether futures ETFs, as well as the announcement that PayPal is launching a stablecoin on the network this week.\n\nSo, what happens to the staking yield if the amount of staked Ether does indeed continue to increase? Remember, the total annual yield paid out to stakers is calculated as follows:\n\n[(gross annual ETH issuance + annual fees*(1-% of fees burned)]\n\nThese total staking rewards are then divided by the average ETH staked over the year to commute the APY.\n\nIn other words: The amount of ether staked is in the denominator of the fraction. So as the amount staked gets bigger, the APY shrinks. This effect can already be seen in what has happened to date. Analysts had predicted a yield of 10%-12% ahead of the Merge, however today it is closer to 4%. And that is 4% with its staking ratio completely out of whack compared to other proof-of-stake coins, as mentioned above.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nWith the amount of Ether staked increasing incessantly, is the yield therefore primed to collapse?\n\nSome analysts believe it is headed towards 1%-2%; some even think less. The reality is that nobody really knows because, as always, demand relies on a variety of factors.\n\nWe need to remember, as we often say in these columns, that speculating on the future of crypto is so difficult because we have such little data to work with. This is true for Ethereum as a whole, which only launched in 2015, but especially so regarding the yield, as the Merge has only been live since September (or since April if you count the \u201ctrue\u201d completion date as post-Shapella).\n\nHence, it is a challenge to forecast the staking yield going forward. We have focused on the impressive growth of staking thus far, and while this will drive the yield down, demand on the network will increase the numerator of the aforementioned formula and kick the yield up.\n\nIndeed, looking at total transactions, the rate has been quite resilient throughout the last eighteen months, despite the bloodbath in the sector last year.\n\nThen again, crypto is changing quickly. It remains difficult to foresee how regulation, infrastructural development (restaking and Eigeanlayer spring to mind as an example) and the macro landscape, just to name a few factors, will affect the climate going forward.\n\nSpeaking of macro, there is also the matter of trad-fi yields. Currently, the Fed funds rate is 5.25%-5.5%, having been near-zero prior to March 2022. Backing out probabilities from Fed futures implies the market is expecting the end of the cycle is near. Not to mention, with the mammoth amount of debt in the current system, rates cannot stay high forever.\n\nCould falling trad-fi yields affect demand for staking yield? Perhaps \u2013 while it is hard to separate the overall liquidity drain and suppressing of risk assets that occurs out of hiked rates, the superior (and risk-free) return is definitely a key reason why capital has flooded out of DeFi in the last year. While previously-dizzying DeFi yields have collapsed, trad-fi yields have rocketed as the Federal Reserve has scrambled to rein in rampant inflation.\n\nFurthermore, if yield does fall down towards 1%-2%, stakers could begin to pull out and search elsewhere for income. This would therefore create a reflexive relationship with regard to the yield.\n\nAll in all, it remains too early to speculate about where the Ethereum staking yield is ultimately headed, at least with any degree of confidence; it depends on too many factors and the sample space is too brief to date. It does seem likely, if not inevitable, that the yield will decline to some degree, but the question of how much is a difficult one to answer. While many are adamant the APY will cascade downwards to uber-thin levels \u2013 and for the avoidance of doubt, it may do \u2013 we have presented here at least some points of consideration as to why the situation may not be as clear cut."

The uptick comes after inflation slowed to 3% annually in June.\n\nOn a month-to-month basis, consumer prices rose 0.2% in July, the same as a 0.2% increase the month before. The BLS said the index\u2019s monthly increase was largely fueled by shelter prices, which rose 0.4% during the month and accounted for 90% of CPI\u2019s overall increase.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum were largely unaffected by the report\u2019s release, holding steady at around $29,600 and $1850, respectively, according to CoinGecko. Other Coins, such as Dogecoin and Solana, were also flat, edging up less than 1%.\n\nAs the Fed draws closer to a so-called soft landing, where it\u2019s able to reign in inflation without tipping the economy into a recession, IntoTheBlock\u2019s Head of Research Lucas Outumuro said each month\u2019s CPI report is steadily becoming less of an impact in crypto markets.\n\n\u201cCPI prints are becoming less and less relevant for crypto and even markets in general,\u201d he told Decrypt. \u201cI think that we're seeing the worst of inflation is behind us.\u201d\n\nFor example, after annual inflation came in at a multi-decade high of 9.1% last June, Bitcoin and Ethereum dropped 4% and 6%, respectively, in the hour after the CPI report\u2019s release. That was back when traders weren\u2019t sure the Fed could clamp down on rampant inflation without effectively putting the economy into a coma.\n\n\u201cPeople didn't think soft landing was possible at the beginning of this year,\u201d Outumuro said. \u201cNow they're close to pulling it off\u2014it's a positive surprise for markets and hence why stocks are up so much this year.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nJuly\u2019s CPI report will be one of several factors weighed by the Federal Reserve at its next Federal Open Markets Committee meeting in September, as its fight against inflation soldiers on.\n\nThe U.S. central bank has tried to tame soaring prices by raising interest rates, which cool the economy by making it more expensive to borrow.\n\nHigher interest rates have weighed on crypto prices and stocks alike, as so-called risk assets become less attractive in the eyes of investors compared to short-term U.S. Treasuries and cash reserves, which see their yields increase as the Fed tightens.\n\nThe Fed began its fight against inflation 18 months ago when it lifted rates from near zero last March. And while inflation has trended down from a sweltering 9.1% clip last summer, the Fed\u2019s ultimate goal is 2%, which Fed Chair Powell said last month he doesn\u2019t expect until at least 2025.\n\nThe Fed officially adopted its target of 2% in 2012 under former Fed chair Ben Bernanke. And while the U.S. central bank has been laser-focused on getting there, there\u2019s also the possibility that its mandate changes down the line, Edward Moya, Chief Market Analyst at OANDA, told Decrypt.\n\n\u201cI think that [the Fed] might be able to live with inflation that\u2019s slightly above their target,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have policy reviews, and they might change what they have to do with inflation.\u201d\n\nFor the Fed, Moya said the strength of the U.S. consumer is also quite important. And a spike in energy prices over the past month could put a dent in American\u2019s wallets while pushing up inflation in the coming CPI report as well.\n\n\u201cThe next inflation report will definitely feel the impact of the surge in energy prices,\u201d Moya said. \u201cThe risks of a reacceleration a few months down the road, remain on the table.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe national average price for a gallon of gasoline reached $3.82 on Wednesday, up over 7% from $3.53 a month ago, according to AAA. Experts have attributed the spike to extreme heat and oil production cuts, per ABC News.\n\nThe Federal Reserve delivered a 25-basis-point rate hike last month that pushed its benchmark interest rate to the highest level in 22 years. At a range of 5.25% and 5.5%, Powell said future rate hikes will be a meeting-by-meeting decision.\n\nStripping out food and energy prices, which are known to be volatile, so-called core inflation rose 4.7% in the twelve months through July. It represented a slight decrease from 4.8% in June.\n\nThe Fed considers core CPI a more accurate indicator of where inflation might be headed. It also looks closely at the Personal Consumption Index, set to be released on Aug. 31. It\u2019s considered to be the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation measure.\n\nIn terms of what could lie ahead, traders think the most likely outcome is that the Fed holds interest rates steady until at least January 2024, according to the CME Group\u2019s FedWatch Tool on Thursday.\n\nAt their meeting in September, traders currently have an 86% chance penciled in that rates remain where they currently are."

Additionally, all client funds are protected and segregated through Fireblocks\u2019 multi-party computation solution.\n\n\n\nThe service also minimises risks around legal and compliance issues through an anti-money laundering compliance system.\n\n\n\nJesper Johansen, founder and CEO of Northstake, says: \u201cThe launch of this fund unlocks a new opportunity for institutional investors to generate yield from Ethereum, without having to hold crypto directly in their portfolios. Despite typically high barriers to entry for newcomers, we\u2019re seeing that traditional investors want exposure to crypto assets.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn order to get involved with digital assets, institutional investors need to be sure of their providers\u2019 risk profile, anti-money laundering standards and regulatory status.

        "content": "Ethereum Co-founder Vitalik Buterin Shares Insights on Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s Reputation\n\nSource: ShutterStock\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has revealed that a larger section of the crypto community did not respect Sam Bankman-Fried as depicted by the mainstream media.\n\nButerin has been a long critic of Bankman Fried since the collapse of the latter\u2019s digital asset exchange, FTX, and has made new revelations concerning the matter.\n\nSpeaking in a podcast interview with Sriram Krishnan and Aarthi Ramamurthy, Buterin spoke on the reputation of SBF, how the sector continues to recover from the infamous scandal, and the growth of Artificial Intelligence (AI).\n\nAccording to Buterin, the crypto industry had reservations about SBF from the beginning although no one expected $8 billion to go into thin air.\n\n\u201cI think a lot of people have this misconception that everybody deeply respected Sam and that he caught the entire ecosystem by surprise \u2026 but if you\u2019re looking at Ethereum influencers like Anthony Sassano, a lot of them disrespected him and FTX from the beginning.\u201d\n\nThe main reason for Buterin\u2019s judgment was SBF\u2019s inability to project the cause of cryptocurrencies and related technologies without financial benefits.\n\n\u201cHe was just not able to articulate a vision of why crypto was good\u2014he just clearly saw it as purely a business opportunity. It\u2019s like, \u2018Oh, hey, crypto is this thing where you can make money,\u201d he added.\n\nRecall that after the collapse of FTX, Buterin noted that people were mostly drawn to the marketing of FTX which he compared to the \u201c1930 dictators\u201d adding that cryptocurrencies are more than the lifestyle and brands of the company.\n\nAI will augment human power\n\nButerin also spoke on the rapid development of AI in several industries including cryptocurrencies hailing the level of adoption so far.\n\nAccording to him, AI would help human capabilities in the workspace and should be embraced at this stage citing the example of ChatGPT .\n\n\u201cI think one of the positive aspects of this is that I think it\u2019s a good example of how, instead of AI killing 30% of the jobs, which would be catastrophic and terrible, it\u2019s like, AI is killing 30% of your job, which is an amazing time saver.\u201d\n\nHe touched on the ability of AI to disrupt the creative space including the production of movies in Hollywood. Although he stated that he doesn\u2019t want to see artists get replaced, he added that he would love to see an author easily produce a movie with the numerous tools provided by AI.\n\n\u201cI would want to see the cost of making a movie go down from $100,000 to one person with basically just his creativity and a couple of months with an AI platform.\u201d"

The network is now ready to onboard users, according to an Aug. 9 announcement from the team.\n\nSeveral Web3 development teams have simultaneously announced that they are releasing apps for Base, and the network\u2019s team has released a schedule of upcoming events to celebrate its launch.\n\nBase is open and Onchain Summer is here\n\n\n\nBecome a part of Base history by minting \u201cBase Day One\u201d to join the story of bringing the world onchain\n\n\n\nOur story.https://t.co/qaDj7CBCMd pic.twitter.com/9PZCLQQV7p \u2014 Base \ufe0f (@BuildOnBase) August 9, 2023\n\nBase initially launched in beta version on Feb. 23. As soon as it was announced, many in the crypto community speculated that it could help to onboard more users into Web3 protocols, thanks to Coinbase\u2019s large user base. The network launched its mainnet version \u201cfor builders\u201d on July 13, but the team warned that it wasn\u2019t ready for users yet. On Aug. 9, the network became available for all users.\n\nHere are a few things users can do on Base right now.\n\nBridge tokens\n\nUsers can bridge Ether (ETH) from mainnet to Base using the official Base bridge, which launched a user interface on Aug. 3. On Aug. 9, the cross-chain bridging protocol Wormhole announced it is available on Base.\n\nSwap tokens and provide liquidity\n\nAt least two decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges (DEXs) have announced they are running on Base, and a third may relaunch soon. Uniswap, one of the first decentralized exchanges on Ethereum, declared its Base version was running on Aug. 7.\n\nMaverick Protocol announced its Base version on Aug. 8. Maverick claims to provide greater capital efficiency and allow for greater customization than its competitors.\n\nA third DEX on Base, LeetSwap, was previously running during the \u201cbuilders only\u201d phase but is currently shut down due to an Aug. 1 exploit. The team intends to relaunch the project at some point in the future. LeetSwap claims to be a DEX for \u201cleet degens\" and offers \u201cdual-token farm rewards\u201d to maximize yield.\n\nThese three apps provide options for users who want to swap tokens or become liquidity providers.\n\nMake payments\n\nAt least one payment app for Base is available.\n\nBeam is a web-based app that allows users to make payments using either U.S. Dollar Coin (USDC) or the app\u2019s native coin, Eco. According to the app\u2019s developers, users aren\u2019t required to store seed words or possess Ether to pay for gas fees. They can log in with their Twitter accounts and pay for gas using USDC or Eco. The app also features a built-in fiat-to-crypto and crypto-to-fiat gateway.\n\nBase announced Beam\u2019s launch for the network on July 27.\n\nRegister a username\n\nMasa Finance has released its soulbound token protocol for Base. On Aug. 8, the protocol announced that users can now register \".base\" Masa usernames on the new network. These usernames may later be used for credit underwriting and other Know Your Customer-compliant services.\n\nIn its announcement, Masa claimed to have minted over 280,000 usernames on Base since the builder phase began.\n\nLaunch a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO)\n\nDecentralized autonomous organization creation protocol Aragon has launched its \u201cno-code Aragon app\u201d and \u201cmodular Aragon OSx\u201d on Base to allow for DAOs to be easily created on the new network. Although it\u2019s mostly developers who will use this function, end users can also establish DAOs on Base through Aragon.\n\nMint and collect nonfungible tokens (NFTs)\n\nOnchain Summer user interface. Source: Base\n\nMultiple brands and projects will allow users to mint NFTs exclusively on Base throughout August and early September. These include Coca-Cola, Coinbase\u2019s Stand With Crypto campaign, Showtime, Atari, Optimism, OpenSea and others. Each NFT launches on a different day of the Onchain Summer festival. For example, the Showtime NFT becomes available on Aug. 18, while the Atari one launches on Aug. 25.\n\nSome investors lost during Base's phased launch\n\nDespite Base\u2019s initial success in attracting app developers, its launch hasn\u2019t been without problems. The network was up and running between July 13 and Aug. 2 but didn\u2019t have a bridge UI. As a result, some users attempted to get an early lead by using developer tools to transfer ETH to the network and buy memecoins that were expected to rise in value after the network\u2019s official launch. However, many investors lost money in these projects due to various launch issues.\n\nAn estimated $2.2 million was lost by investors in the July 28 Pond0x memecoin launch due to confusion surrounding how the token was supposed to be distributed. Another $1.9 million was lost during the July 31 BALD token launch on Base when the developer pulled some of its liquidity."

        "content": "Ethereum is currently dominating the DeFi and smart contract niches when it comes to the Total Value Locked (TVL). However, while Ethereum is still the king, other chains like Solana, Avalanche, and Polkadot compete to prove themselves worthy contenders to the throne.\n\nSolana, in particular, has seen some massive growth recently in terms of its total value locked (TVL). According to on-chain data from Messari, Solana outperformed other chains by achieving a total value-locked (TVL) gain of 14% over the course of the previous month.\n\nSolana Sees Massive Growth in Total Value Locked\n\nThe aggregated TVL of the entire DeFi sector has been in a freefall since November 2022, and Solana hasn\u2019t been exempted. However, Solana\u2019s growth during the past month was driven in significant part by an increase in the TVL of protocols for staking and yielding based on Solana.\n\nTVL refers to the total amount of assets deposited in a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol and is used as a metric to rank platforms. On-chain reports show that Solana grew its TVL by $45 million in July, corresponding to a 14.4% growth.\n\nAccording to DeFi Llama, Solana currently sits at the 9th position in terms of TVL locked in all chains. Solana is now at a TVL of $320.07 million, representing a massive growth from its $205.11 million TVL at the beginning of the year.\n\nWhile Ethereum still has the highest value with a TVL of $23.3 billion, it saw its TVL decline by 13% over the past month. Binance Smart Chain (BSC) also posted a monthly loss in TVL, dropping by 4.6% to $3.3 billion.\n\nSOL price recovers to $24.75 as TVL grows | Source: SOLUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nHow Far Can SOL Go In 2023?\n\nWhile the increase in TVL is due in part to an increase in the TVL of protocols, Solana also witnessed a surge in price at the beginning of July. Data from Coinmarketcap shows the price of Solana shot up from $18.9 on July 1 to $27.4 on July 16 to reach a market cap of $11.81 billion.\n\nSolana, along with Bitcoin, led the surge in the crypto market around this time period. As a consequence, the surge in Solana\u2019s price led to a direct proportion in the value of the total assets locked in DeFi protocols on the chain.\n\nDespite having a TVL growth in the last month, user activity on the chain dropped toward the end of the month. Its market cap also dropped to $9.7 billion at the end of July, demonstrating the volatility of the crypto market.\n\nAt the time of writing, Solana is trading at $24.85 and is up by 14.93% in a monthly timeframe. Although experts predict Solana can surge above $30 before the end of the year.\n\nFeatured image from Analytics Insight, chart from Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

Whilst there have been periods where cryptos appear to have been used as an inflation hedge, these are not consistent enough and too often contradicted to offer a robust correlation.\n\nThat said, if Thursday\u2019s CPI reading causes market volatility it will probably spill over into crypto as there is evidence of a correlation with broader market volatility (as measured by the VIX). A big miss, therefore, could impact the big crypto. Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP), meanwhile, are both riding on this optimism, but it remains to be seen whether this is sustainable."

        "content": "PancakeSwap has deployed its decentralised exchange protocol on Arbitrum.\n\nThe move marks the fourth Ethereum scaling blockchain to play host to PancakeSwap.\n\nIt comes as Ethereum layer 2 chains are attracting increasing attention from DeFi users.\n\nDecentralised exchange PancakeSwap deployed on Arbitrum, an Ethereum layer 2 blockchain, on August 10 as it looks to expand beyond the BNB Chain, the layer 1 blockchain backed by Binance.\n\nPancakeSwap said the move was part of efforts to \u201cconnect users and projects wherever they might be\u201d as it sees Ethereum layer 2 networks as a \u201chigh-potential area.\u201d\n\nLayer 2 blockchains are built to improve the scalability of layer 1 chains like Ethereum.\n\nThursday\u2019s Arbitrum deployment marks the fourth time PancakeSwap will launch its DEX on an Ethereum scaling blockchain having already deployed on Linea, zkSync, and Polygon zkEVM networks.\n\nStay ahead of the game with our weekly newsletters Subscribe\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking forward to working with projects and users on many chains, as PancakeSwap strongly believes that the future is chain-agnostic for both users and projects,\u201d Chef Mochi, PancakeSwap\u2019s head chef, told DL News.\n\nNOW READ: Why Ethereum is so dominant \u2014 and why it\u2019s not going anywhere\n\nThe Arbitrum deployment comes amidst the growing popularity of Ethereum layer 2 networks.\n\nThese Ethereum scaling blockchains offer fast transactions at lower costs \u2014 the same value proposition claimed by alternate layer 1 blockchains like BNB Chain.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nBNB Chain, and by extension PancakeSwap, was supposed to be a cheaper alternative to the high fees that frequently plague Ethereum when the former launched in April 2020.\n\nThe Binance-backed blockchain originated as a fork of Ethereum and PancakeSwap was itself a copy of Uniswap, the largest DEX protocol on Ethereum.\n\nThe apparent success of Ethereum scaling blockchains has begun to cast doubt over the ability of these alternate networks, often called Ethereum-killers by promoters, to compete with Ethereum and its layer 2 chains.\n\nArbitrum launched its network last year and has already achieved $1.95 billion in total value locked \u2014 a DeFi metric for the volume of investor deposits locked in a blockchain.\n\nPancakeSwap TVL\n\nArbitrum\u2019s TVL is almost two-thirds of BNB Chain, with the former having dropped from its peak of $21 billion in May 2021 to $3 billion currently, according to DefiLlama data.\n\nSome of these alternate blockchains have even abandoned efforts to exist as independent layer 1 networks in favour of becoming Ethereum layer 2 chains.\n\nCelo is an example of such a pivot. The so-called carbon-negative blockchain developed by CLabs voted to become an Ethereum scaling network in July.\n\nBNB Chain is also impacted by the success of Ethereum layer 2 networks as its community has been considering ways to lower transaction fees on the network to remain competitive.\n\nThe blockchain also has a layer 2 network called opBNB, which is currently in its testnet phase.\n\nOsato Avan-Nomayo is our Nigeria-based DeFi correspondent.

        "content": "Pepe Coin became the most discussed cryptocurrency on social media in July, beating Bitcoin and Ethereum. The meme currency is the darling of investors, as they believe it could replicate Dogecoin and Shiba Inu\u2019s success. However, the social media mentions for July could most likely be negative, as the token relentlessly dipped last month. Nonetheless, any promotion is good promotion for meme coins, as it reaches a broader set of audiences on digital media platforms.

Bitcoin came in a close second at 9.3% while Ethereum came third at 8.2% of all digital media mentions.\n\nAlso Read: Dogecoin: How High Could DOGE Rise by December 2023?\n\nNew entrants made it to the top 5 with Arbitrum (ARB) taking the fourth place at 6.2% while XRP grabbed the fifth spot at 6.1%.

        "content": "y00ts is ditching Polygon for Ethereum.\n\nThe move has raised questions about the Polygon NFT ecosystem.\n\nThe data tells a different story.\n\nThe migration of DeLabs\u2019 NFT project y00ts to Polygon in April 2023 was met with significant fanfare due to the project\u2019s success on the Solana network. But just four months later, y00ts is now bidding farewell to Polygon.\n\nOn Wednesday, August 9, DeLabs announced that y00ts would migrate to the Ethereum network. The team also revealed they would return $3 million in grants from Polygon Labs.\n\nFollowing DeLabs\u2019 decision, questions about Polygon\u2019s NFT ecosystem have arisen.\n\ny00ts Exit a Blow to Polygon?\n\nSeveral crypto community members have asserted that y00ts\u2019 planned exit from the Polygon network is a blow to the network. \u201cSucks for polygon,\u201d one user tweeted in response. Prominent Cardano influencer Chris O simply stated, \u201cRip Polygon.\u201d\n\nDespite the negative views, it is worth noting that not all are pessimistic about the move. zkPhantazm suggested that y00ts had ended up giving Polygon free promotion, framing it as a win for Polygon Labs. Additionally, the user claimed that y00ts was bailing because it had failed to meet the KPI for the grant. zkPhantazm received a retweet from Polygon Labs Executive Chairman Sandeep Nailwal for his efforts.\n\nSo just to understand, @y00tsNFT helped @0xPolygonLabs for 0 dollars.\n\n\n\n\u2705 Basically got polygon free marketing\n\n\u2705 Free added volume, free exposure\n\n\u2705Free added activity, and free increased users?\n\nContrary to people spamming L in comments, see this as an absolute W for Polygon.\u2026 https://t.co/9cLPgN3J3R \u2014 zkPhantazm (@zkPhantazm) August 10, 2023\n\nSo how much of an impact will y00ts\u2019 exit have on Polygon\u2019s NFT ecosystem?\n\nPolygon\u2019s NFT Ecosystem\n\nPolygon has processed over $30.8 million in NFT sales in the past 30 days, behind only Solana and Ethereum per data from CryptoSlam at the time of writing. For clarity, y00ts only accounts for about 8% of Polygon\u2019s NFT sales within the period with $2.5 million.\n\nIn comparison, collections like Draft Kings and Misfits by Pluto are garnering notoriety within the Polygon community. Draft Kings, for example, saw over $10 million in sales in the last 30 days, representing more than half of what y00ts has generated during its four-month stint at Polygon, with $3 million of those sales processed in 24 hours on Wednesday, August 9.\n\nNearly 3 million dollars in sales in 24 hours for @DraftKings NFTs. On many days, it is the largest volume product across the whole NFT space.\n\n\n\nThis is the mainstream adoption @0xPolygon ecosystem has been working relentlessly on.\n\n\n\nMany such big apps alone will do larger volumes\u2026 pic.twitter.com/DyYMT5gGrg \u2014 Sandeep Nailwal | sandeep. polygon \ud83d\udc9c (@sandeepnailwal) August 9, 2023\n\nResponding to y00ts exit, Polygon Labs CEO Marc Boiron asserted that while he was disappointed by the decision, he was not worried due to Polygon\u2019s NFT ecosystem, which he hailed for its infrastructure and growing number of marketplaces.\n\nBig thank you to @frankdegods and the @y00tsNFT community.

        "content": "In the vast world of cryptocurrencies, two giants stand out in the realm of smart contracts and dApps (that\u2019s short for decentralised applications, by the way!): Solana and Ethereum. Imagine these two blockchain networks different brands of smartphones, each with its own cool features, user base, and unique quirks. While Ethereum has been around for a while and is like the OG iPhone of the crypto world, Solana is like the sleek new competitor that\u2019s turning heads. So, if you\u2019ve ever wondered how these two compare or which one might be better for your needs, you\u2019ve come to the right place!\n\nShort Summary\n\nSolana vs Ethereum : Ethereum is like the legendary band with a massive following and long-standing reputation, while Solana is the breakout star impressing everyone with speed and affordability.\n\nConsensus Mechanisms : Both cryptocurrencies have adopted the \u201cproof of stake\u201d system, a greener and more efficient method of confirming transactions, moving away from the energy-intensive \u201cproof of work.\u201d\n\n: Both cryptocurrencies have adopted the \u201cproof of stake\u201d system, a greener and more efficient method of confirming transactions, moving away from the energy-intensive \u201cproof of work.\u201d Costs, Speed, and Security: While the Solana network boasts faster speeds and lower fees, Ethereum takes the lead in decentralisation and security, offering a more tried-and-true system that\u2019s earned users\u2019 trust over the years.\n\nContents\n\nUnderstanding the Ethereum Blockchain\n\nEthereum is like this super cool digital playground where developers can create and run their own games (or apps) using something called \u201csmart contracts.\u201d Think of these smart contracts as self-executing rules\u2014like if you do A, then B will automatically happen. The Ethereum network has been around since 2015, making it one of the OGs in the crypto scene. It\u2019s not just about trading coins; it\u2019s more about building a whole new digital universe. And, just like any popular game, it has tons of players (users) and developers adding new stuff all the time!\n\nUnderstanding the Solana Blockchain\n\nImagine if Ethereum was the classic video game everyone knew and loved, and then Solana comes in like the hot new sequel with faster levels and cooler graphics. Solana is also a place where developers can build games (or, you know, apps) using smart contracts, just like Ethereum. But here\u2019s the kicker: the Solana network claims to be super speedy and can handle loads of transactions in a jiffy without slowing down or costing you a ton in fees. Think of it like playing a game with zero lag, even if everyone in school is playing at the same time. It\u2019s newer to the scene than Ethereum, but it\u2019s quickly gaining fans because of its performance perks.\n\nComparing Consensus Mechanisms\n\n\u201cConsensus mechanisms\u201d is just a fancy term for how cryptocurrencies like Solana and Ethereum agree on stuff (like confirming transactions). Think of it like a classroom vote on where to go for a field trip. In the early days, Ethereum used something called \u201cproof of work,\u201d which is kind of like everyone in class doing a ton of math problems to vote (yeah, super energy-consuming!). But now, both Ethereum and Solana use \u201cproof of stake\u201d to process transactions. In this method, instead of doing math problems, it\u2019s like the kids with the most candy (or coins) get a bigger say in the vote. It\u2019s way less energy-hungry and faster. Both systems have their pros and cons, but proof of stake is seen as the greener, more efficient choice, and that\u2019s what both our crypto stars are rocking now!\n\nSpeed and Scalability\n\nWhen we talk about \u201cSpeed and Scalability,\u201d think about it like the difference between a regular skateboard and a high-speed electric one. Both can get you around, but one\u2019s going to do it faster and can handle more bumps in the road. In the crypto world, speed means how quickly transactions happen (transaction speed), and scalability is about how a system deals when tons of people start using it at once. Even though both Ethereum and Solana use \u201cproof of stake\u201d (remember, that\u2019s the cool new voting system with the candy), Solana is often praised for being the speedier skateboard. It\u2019s designed to have very fast transaction speeds without getting clogged up. Ethereum\u2019s no slouch, but there have been times when it got overwhelmed and slowed down, like a popular game server on launch day. Both are working hard to improve, but for now, Solana\u2019s got the edge in the speed department.\n\nDecentralisation and Security\n\nImagine a school project: if the whole grade participates, no one person can dominate or mess things up, right? This is kinda how Ethereum rolls. It\u2019s like a big group project where loads of participants (called nodes) make sure everything\u2019s legit. This means no single person or group has too much power. Now, Solana, on the other hand, has had instances where a smaller group (around 30 validators) held a big chunk (like 35%) of the influence. Think of it as if just a few kids in class had most of the markers and paper. There\u2019ve been times when Solana\u2019s system has had hiccups or outages, kind of like a game crashing unexpectedly. While Ethereum has been more like that reliable old game that rarely glitches. So, even if Solana might save you some digital coins with its lower fees, Ethereum\u2019s been around the block and has that trusty, decentralised vibe which adds an extra layer of safety for folks investing their cash. Always good to remember: cheaper isn\u2019t always better if you\u2019re skipping out on some key safety features!\n\nCosts and Fees\n\nThink of this like choosing between two streaming services. One might have all the top shows and is super popular, but man, the monthly fee is kinda steep. The other is newer, has some cool features, and is easier on your wallet. Ethereum, being the popular kid on the block, has had moments where its transaction costs (they call them \u201cgas fees\u201d) shoot up like crazy, especially when everyone\u2019s trying to use it at the same time. On the flip side, Solana tends to be the budget-friendly option with low transaction fees. It\u2019s kinda like getting a decent streaming service for half the price. Both use \u201cproof of stake\u201d, which should help with costs in the long run, but for now, if you\u2019re looking to save some digital dough, Solana might be your go-to. But, as with any deal, always check what you\u2019re getting for the price!\n\nMarket Capitalisation and Adoption\n\n\u201cMarket Capitalisation and Adoption\u201d might sound super fancy, but let\u2019s break it down. Imagine two bands: one\u2019s been on the charts for years, has tons of loyal fans, and sells out stadiums. The other is the breakout star of the year, super hot right now, but still building its fan base. Ethereum is like that legendary band. It\u2019s been around, has a massive value (that\u2019s the \u201cmarket capitalisation\u201d part), and loads of people and businesses use it. Solana, the new hitmaker, is gaining fans fast and has a growing value, but it\u2019s not quite at Ethereum\u2019s superstar level yet. Both being on \u201cproof of stake\u201d means they\u2019re keeping up with the modern beats, but in terms of sheer sise and popularity, Ethereum\u2019s still got the bigger fan club. However, as with any new sensation, Solana\u2019s making waves and might just surprise everyone in the future.\n\nSummary\n\nLet\u2019s wrap this up! Ethereum\u2019s been a big player in the crypto world for a while, known for its strong decentralisation, security, and huge market value. But its fees can sometimes be a bummer. On the other hand, Solana\u2019s the newer kid on the block, impressing everyone with its speed and lower costs. However, it\u2019s had a few hiccups with reliability. Both are using the \u201cproof of stake\u201d method, which is like a green, efficient way to run things. As for what the future holds? Well, both are cooking up cool upgrades to get even better. At the end of the day, they\u2019ve both got their strengths and challenges, so it really comes down to what you value most in your crypto adventure!\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nWill Solana surpass Ethereum?\n\nIt\u2019s a hot topic! The crypto world is ever-evolving, and while Ethereum has held a dominant position for a while, Solana\u2019s been making waves with its features and performance. Predicting the future of cryptocurrencies is always tricky, so it\u2019s hard to say definitively. What\u2019s for sure is that both have unique strengths and are pushing boundaries in their own ways.\n\nWhy use Solana instead of Ethereum?\n\nThere are several reasons one might lean towards Solana. It boasts faster transaction speeds and generally has lower transaction fees compared to Ethereum, especially during peak times. If you\u2019re into developing applications or just making transactions, and speed and cost are your top priorities, then Solana might be a good fit for you. But, as always, it\u2019s essential to research and figure out what suits your needs best.\n\nWhat are the main differences between Ethereum and Solana?\n\nAt their core, both Ethereum and Solana allow for decentralised apps and smart contracts. But here\u2019s a quick breakdown:\n\nSpeed: Solana often has faster transaction speeds. Fees: Solana typically offers lower transaction fees. Decentralisation & Security: Ethereum has a more decentralised network, which some argue provides better security. Adoption: Ethereum, being older, has a wider user base and more applications built on its platform. Solana, while newer, is growing rapidly. Consensus Mechanism: As of this writing, both use proof of stake, but they arrived there differently with Ethereum transitioning from proof of work.\n\nWhich platform has lower transaction fees?\n\nSolana usually has lower transaction fees compared to Ethereum, especially during high-traffic times. This can be a significant advantage for those looking to minimise costs during transactions or when deploying applications. However, as the crypto landscape is dynamic, it\u2019s a good idea to stay updated on fee structures and trends."

        "content": "Popular NFT project y00ts has announced that it will migrate from the Polygon (MATIC) blockchain to Ethereum (ETH). The project had only moved to the Polygon ecosystem earlier this year from Solana (SOL). y00ts mentioned that it will also repay the $3 million grant that Polygon gave as part of the change.\n\ny00ts will join the DeGods library on Ethereum once the migration is complete. Both projects were created by Rohun Vora, aka Frank, in October 2021. In April, the company had already moved DeGods to Ethereum. Frank stated via a tweet that,\n\n\u201cWe tried our best to make it work, but we just need to bring our 2 communities together.\u201d\n\n1. We tried our best to make it work but we just need to bring our 2 communities together.\n\n\n\nI would appreciate it if everyone remains respectful of all parties involved.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s all love. https://t.co/6AT4SMUT76 August 9, 2023\n\nThe project tweeted that they still love Polygon (MATIC), but it\u2019s time to unite DeGods and y00ts on Ethereum (ETH). The project also reaffirmed that the grant, which will be returned, will be redeployed for NFT ecosystem growth.\n\n2. We're returning 100% of the grant provided by Polygon.\n\n\n\nThe funds will be re-deployed for NFT ecosystem growth to empower builders and creators.\n\n\n\nWe still love Polygon. It's just time to unite the DeGods & y00ts communities. \u2014 y00ts (@y00tsNFT) August 9, 2023\n\nHowever, the move to Ethereum was announced all the way back in December 2022. Back then, Frank said that the decision had been made to \u201cexplore new opportunities.\u201d Additionally, he had claimed that this would enable the collections to expand.\n\nAlso Read: Top 2 NFT Projects on Solana are Jumping to Ethereum, Polygon: Why?\n\nAfter the FTX collapse in November 2022, many projects began to abandon the Solana (SOL) network, as it was one of the worst affected networks due to the collapse.\n\nWill the move from Polygon to Ethereum affect prices?\n\nSource: PYMNTS.com\n\ny00ts\u2019 migration to Ethereum is yet to be announced. However, the news about the move has already had an effect on the floor prices of each NFT collection. According to CoinGecko data, the floor price of y00ts increased 7.2% in the last day to 1.88 ETH. Meanwhile, the floor price of DeGods decreased by 4.9% to 8.9 ETH. As per the 24-hour volume, DeGods is presently the third-most traded NFT collection. On the other hand, y00ts is the eighth most traded, according to CoinGecko data.\n\nAlso Read: Gucci and a 256 Years Old Auction House Partners For NFT Collection"

        "title": "Mixed Performance for Bitcoin and Ethereum after XRP Rally Calms: Analyst Eyes 1500% Growth For DigiToads Presale - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "The recent XRP rally showed that even though much of the market is in a slight downturn, gains can still be made in this space. And such movement is especially remarkable when you consider all the issues XRP itself has faced in recent years. But what if you could invest in a crypto newcomer that has many experts licking their lips, and doesn\u2019t have any of the downsides associated with Ripple? You can: by investing in the DigiToads (TOADS) presale before it\u2019s too late. It\u2019s regarded by many as the best crypto to buy right now by a considerable margin. Here\u2019s why:\n\nDigiToads (TOADS) beats out any other altcoin in the space thanks to an incredible range of features that are unmatched by any other memecoin. While other ERC20 coins and meme tokens might offer social media popularity: TOADS has that alongside tons of other actual, definable benefits. These benefits include the unmatched NFT staking protocol, which puts real passive income potential in the palm of your hands. With the TOADS NFT staking pool, 2% of transactions are funneled into a staking rewards system that will pay out those who stake their own popular NFTs for the longest intervals. It\u2019s the easiest way to earn hands-off income from any crypto project on the planet.\n\nAnd momentum into the TOADS presale is already surging, having already surpassed huge sales milestones that get smashed every single day. There are still discounts available at prices of $0.5. But remember: these prices will NOT be available for much longer. They\u2019re set to go up a level to $0.055 when it officially launches onto mainstream exchanges like Uniswap and BitMart in just a couple of weeks\u2019 time. So jump at your chance to make automatic gains by joining the remarkable TOADS presale while there\u2019s still a bit of time left.\n\nRipple (XRP)\n\nRipple stunned analysts and onlookers by actually making solid gains over the past couple of months. This was remarkably bullish for the token when you consider how many issues it faced in recent years, including being delisted on mainstream exchanges and struggling with legal battles. So there is still upside for this altcoin, and it could surge even higher once these issues are firmly put in the past.\n\nWhat about Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC)?\n\nRipple\u2019s recent movement was expected by some to pour a new lease of life into more established cryptos like BTC and ETH. While a couple of mini-rallied occurred, these failed to live up to expectations. Both these tokens are still the mainstays of the crypto investment world, and they are absolutely here to stay, but if you want gains over the coming months: there might be better options out there. Options like TOADS.\n\nConclusion\n\nXRP still has potential, even after its recent rally has slowed somewhat. And you should probably always have space for stalwarts like BTC and ETH in your portfolio: but you should have more space for TOADS. That\u2019s because it leads the way with potential for the next few months, and could be the best thing ever for your portfolio. Join the TOADS presale and snap up discounts before it\u2019s too late.\n\nVisit DigiToads Presale\n\nMint DigiToads NFTs Here\n\nBuy DigiToads NFTs on OpenSea\n\nJoin the community\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "In a surprising turn of events, Tron has emerged as the leader in daily transactions, outperforming Ethereum by a considerable margin.\n\nAccording to a tweet from Tron DAO, the platform recorded over 5 million daily transactions, while Ethereum managed just over 1 million transactions. This milestone indicates Tron\u2019s growing popularity and its ability to handle a high volume of transactions effectively.\n\nWhile Tron\u2019s achievement in daily transactions is commendable, the platform\u2019s overall performance has experienced a dip from its peak in 2021.

        "content": "The Consumer Price Index (CPI) data release may profoundly impact the Bitcoin and crypto market, potentially leading to an unexpected boost if it aligns with Fundstrat\u2019s predictions of a more dovish Federal Reserve stance.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum\u2019s price stability ahead of the CPI data underscores the ongoing tension in the market, with key support and resistance levels reflecting anticipation around the impact of inflation metrics on the digital asset market.\n\nOur latest update brings thrilling insights into the cryptocurrency market, where Bitcoin and Ethereum are holding their ground as the world braces for today\u2019s Consumer Price Index (CPI) data release at 8:30 am EST!\n\nInflation and Market Anticipation\n\nThe digital asset market is perched on the edge of anticipation as traditional markets and central banks await the ripple effects of the July CPI data. Wall Street expects a 0.2% rise from June, leading to a 12-month core CPI of 4.7%, while the headline index is predicted to ascend to 3.3%.\n\nFundstrat Global Advisors\u2019 Thomas Lee took to social media to highlight the significance, stating, \u201cJuly CPI going to be revelatory.\u201d He further illustrated potential outcomes, creating a heightened sense of intrigue and concern.\n\nInflation Projections and Influencing Factors\n\nMost experts forecast that inflation will pick up in the coming months. The Cleveland Fed\u2019s projections suggest a steady climb in headline CPI inflation YoY, while JP Morgan\u2019s projections indicate a re-acceleration in the US CPI.\n\nHowever, Fundstrat\u2019s recent analysis might provide a pleasant surprise. The report suggests a Core CPI of +0.15% or better MoM, notably below the consensus estimates of +0.22%. This prediction hinges on disinflationary pressures from falling used car prices and a cooling housing market, which have accounted for a substantial 66% of core price increases since the end of 2019.\n\nImpact on Bitcoin and Crypto\n\nIf the CPI data aligns with Fundstrat\u2019s predictions, the Federal Reserve may take a more dovish stance, potentially weakening the US dollar and boosting Bitcoin and crypto.\n\nMarket analysts also highlight the importance of liquidity in the market, especially during significant data releases like the CPI. The key areas of support and resistance remain critical to watch, with potential for rapid price movements in the crypto market.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum\u2019s Current Position\n\nAt the moment, Bitcoin\u2019s price stands at $29,565, holding strong support around 28500. The interim trend remains up, suggesting the overall bullish bias. Ethereum\u2019s uptrend has momentarily stalled but maintains major support, reflecting an intact upward bias since the end of 2022.\n\nDaily Updates and Observations\n\nOn the daily charts, BTC/USD shows resilience, while ETH/USD finds support at crucial barriers. The tension in the market ahead of the CPI release indicates that the ongoing debate between bulls and bears in the Bitcoin and crypto sector may soon find an unexpected turn.\n\nThis article is provided for informational purposes only and is not intended as investment advice.

        "content": "Solana outperforms the likes of Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain in Total Value Lock (TVL) while maintaining 100 percent average uptime for six straight months.\n\nIts active user count has, however, declined by 5 percent in the last 30 days.\n\nSolana (SOL) makes incredible progress in the crypto-sphere as its network activities boom and outperform industry giants. According to data, Solana recorded a 14 percent surge in its Total Value Locked (TVL) last month. This signifies a bounce back from the severe decline recorded last year following several downtimes and the seven major exploits that hit the chain.\n\nThe TVL of Solana started the year with $209.25 million. Since then, there has been an increase of 217 percent to hit $664 million as of press time. Interestingly, the heavyweight L1 networks like Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and Avalanche declined by 13 percent, 6 percent, and 10 percent respectively when Solana recorded an uptick last month.\n\nThe negative growth of TVL is not limited to layer 1 solutions as Arbitrum, a Layer 2 scaling solution also fell by 7 percent last month. Optimism, however, defied the odds to make a 10 percent surge in its TVL last month.\n\nA careful observation of the Solana network shows a contradictory movement of its users\u2019 activity within the period.\n\nSolana Active User Count and SOL Price Performance\n\nAccording to Token Terminal, there was a 5 percent decline in active user count in the past 30 days. This means no major improvement has been recorded since last year\u2019s downtimes and exploits. In the past 180 days, the daily active user count has fallen by 15 percent.\n\nIn the last 12 months, it has recorded a whopping 50 percent fall. Just last week, the number of active user activity reduced by 1.6 percent due to the declined trading volume across the decentralized exchanges on the chain. It was also observed that zkSync, which has very low TVL, surpassed Solana in Decentralized Exchange (DEX) trading Volume in the period under review.\n\nSolana, however, had other surges apart from TVL. It\u2019s transaction fee and network revenue recorded a surge. According to Solscan, network fees imposed on successful non-vote transactions moved to a high of 53.06 SOL on August 2. Compared to 31.64 SOL recorded last month, this is a significant growth in network fees. This is said to be a general issue as all network fees spiked by 50 percent last month. On a year-on-year basis, L1\u2019s revenue surged by 21 percent.\n\nSolana recorded a 100 percent average uptime each month in the past six straight months and is said to be a contributing factor to the growth. Since this was a major issue last year as it eroded trust and raised concerns about the stability of the network, the current development appears as good news.\n\nIn other areas, Solana recorded an impressive $24.7 million in daily transactions as of June, surpassing Ethereum which only got half of Solana\u2019s numbers.\n\nThe native token (SOL ) is doing equally well; it surged by 19 percent in the last 30 days and recorded a 5.5 percent surge in the last seven days. Its 24-hour growth is also 5.6 percent, pushing the price to $24.75 as of press time. Regardless, Solana is still down by 90 percent from its all-time high of $259.96.\n\nThis article is provided for informational purposes only and is not intended as investment advice.

It suggests buyers are active at lower levels and short-term bounce back is possible.\n\nETC price is stuck in the narrow range between $16.00 to $20.00. Buyers and sellers both tried to break the range on either side but got rejected. It shows that prices lacked direction and are likely to consolidate for some more time.\n\nEthereum Classic price faced rejection from the 200-day EMA and also dropped below the 50-day EMA. It indicates that the positional, as well as the short-term trend, is down.\n\nAt the beginning of July, ETC crypto witnessed a massive spike in buying volume. The price also reacted positively and attempted to break the $20.00 hurdle.\n\nSadly, the attempt failed and prices again reverted down. It formed a long-tail bearish rejection candle which created fear and triggered the supply zone.\n\nEthereum Classic price is trading at $17.718 with an intraday decline of -0.79%. The 24-hour volume to market cap is 3.63%. The pair of ETC/BTC is trading at 0.000600 with an intraday decline of -0.33%.\n\nEthereum Classic Price at attractive levels\n\nETC/USDT daily chart by TradingView\n\nEthereum Classic price prediction suggests a short-term pullback is possible in the coming months. ETC price is near to the demand zone and downside risk is low. The overall crypto market is recovering which might positively impact the prices of ETC in the coming weeks.\n\nTill the Ethereum Classic price sustains above $16.00 the possibility of bounce back remains high. However, the price will pick up momentum when buyers will be able to break the $20.00 hurdle.\n\nThe technical analysis suggests ETC crypto price is at attractive levels and buyers will become active soon.\n\nETC crypto is in a short-term correction mode\n\nETC crypto price is in short-term correction mode and buyers are trying their best to rebound. If the BTC and ETH price recovers then ETC crypto might also get positively impacted.\n\nThe MACD curve slopes down and slips below the zero line indicating mild bearishness. The RSI at 41 denotes bulls losing strength and might reach the oversold territory. However, the ETC price sustained above the super trend buy line shows buyers are also active.\n\nConclusion\n\nEthereum Classic price prediction is bullish for the short term as well as for the long term. ETC crypto price is near to the demand zone so the possibility of bounce back remains high.\n\nTechnical levels\n\nResistance levels: $20.284 and $22.934\n\n$20.284 and $22.934 Support levels: $16.623 and $14.359\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe views and opinions stated by the author, or any people named in this article, are for informational purposes only.

        "content": "Both the XRP Network (XRP) and the Ethereum Network (ETH) are among the most used crypto networks, considering the daily number of transactions being carried out in Ripple\u2019s public ledger and Ethereum\u2019s blockchain. A metric that reflects the demand for their technologies.\n\nOn August 8, data retrieved by Finbold from BitInfoCharts shows that there were close to 1.28 million daily transactions on XRP Ledger, as opposed to 1.09 million for Ethereum. Bitcoin (BTC), the leading cryptocurrency, lies far behind with circa 0.33 million transactions taking place on its blockchain.\n\nThe competition for \u2018the most used network\u2019 in the number of transactions is fierce \u2014 coming from a long date. Both XRP and Ethereum have their shining moments, but the first saw a drop in July that is now mostly recovered.\n\nBitcoin, Ethereum, XRP Transactions historical chart. Source: BitInfoCharts\n\nStill, according to current data, the XRP Network has done an average of 53,330 transactions per hour in the last 24 hours, while the Ethereum Network accomplished an average of 45,900 transactions per hour. The Bitcoin Network gets an average of 17,288 per hour.\n\nTransactions volume for XRP, ETH, and BTC\n\nHowever, the situation reverses for the volume being sent in the same period:\n\nBitcoin: 280,266 BTC ($8.35 billion) \u2014 1.44% market cap\n\nEthereum: 992,507 ETH ($1,84 billion) \u2014 0.7812% market cap\n\nXRP: 749,743,000 XRP ($0.48 billion) \u2014 1.41% market cap\n\nBitcoin is the leader both in US dollar (USD) volume and percentage of the market cap; while XRP loses to Ethereum in USD volume, but gets really close to BTC when weighted by market value. The 24-hour transactions volume for the XRP Ledger was gathered from Blockchair, as BitInfoCharts didn\u2019t provide this metric.\n\nXRP price analysis\n\nMeanwhile, XRP is, by press time, changing hands at the price of $0.64, registering an increase of 4.60% on the day.\n\nThis is a price range that has been kept since the beginning of August. On July 13, XRP saw a massive pump from $0.47 to $0.81 (+72%) but is steadily retracing to the current zone.\n\nTaking into account a similar demand for the number of transactions, and a superior demand for transaction volume weighted by market cap, 1 XRP would be worth $2.24 if its network had the same fully diluted market capitalization as Ethereum.\n\nAll things considered, the digital asset\u2019s ability to meet these expectations will depend on further developments related to XRP and Ethereum, as well as the general sentiment on the wider crypto and macroeconomic landscape.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "title": "Crypto: Fantom explores optimistic rollups - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "The Fantom Foundation, a prominent player in this space, recently caught the attention of the crypto community with its intention to integrate optimistic rollups to establish a connection between Fantom and Ethereum blockchains.\n\nThis move has ignited debate about the nature of Layer 2 solutions, with co-founder and architect Andre Cronje offering a unique perspective that challenges conventional understanding.\n\nFantom tries to bridge Ethereum new modalities for the crypto community\n\nLast month, the Celo network grabbed headlines by unveiling a plan to transform its tier 1 blockchain into a layer 2 solution on the Ethereum network through the use of optimistic rollups.\n\nThis strategic maneuver not only attracted considerable attention, but also led to an impressive 18% surge in the value of its native token after the announcement.\n\nIt demonstrated the market\u2019s enthusiasm for layer-scaling solutions that leverage the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nIn a recent interview with The Scoop, Fantom Foundation co-founder and architect Andre Cronje revealed that his team is actively exploring the integration of optimistic rollups to establish a link between Fantom and Ethereum.\n\nThis investigation includes various implementations, including Optimistic Stack and Arbitrum Stack, to understand how these canonical bridges use cryptographic evidence to increase security guarantees.\n\nCronje confirmed that it is seriously considering adopting one of these solutions as its canonical bridge.\n\nIf Fantom were to implement optimistic rollups and offer a complete transaction history on the Ethereum network, it would have to pay transaction fees to record these snapshots on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nThe benefits of the new layer 2 implementation idea\n\nFantom Foundation CEO Michael Kong outlined the potential benefits of implementing Layer 2 technology in this way, noting how it would allow the Fantom network to tap into a larger pool of liquidity from the burgeoning Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nThis strategic move could open up new avenues for decentralized applications and financial instruments, as greater liquidity often leads to greater functionality and a better experience for users.\n\nHowever, the crux of the issue lies in how Layer 2 solutions are defined. Cronje challenges conventional terminology and offers an analysis of Layer 1 solutions. Cronje challenges conventional terminology by arguing for a different perspective.\n\nIn his view, so-called Layer 2 solutions are essentially sidechains, and the technology behind optimistic rollups acts as a bridge between distinct blockchains rather than falling into the traditional pattern of a Layer 2 solution.\n\nHe recognizes that this distinction could be useful in improving functionality and user experiences. Cronje acknowledges that this distinction might seem semantic, but he is resolute in his position.\n\nThe crypto universe is full of innovations and technological experiments such as Fantom\n\nCronje argues that technologies such as optimistic rollups function as linking mechanisms that facilitate the secure movement of native assets between different blockchains.\n\nHowever, he introduces a critical nuance: this security is compromised when multiple bridges connect the affected blockchains.\n\nIn essence, the enhanced security of optimistic rollups primarily benefits canonical assets within a specific blockchain, but loses its effectiveness when numerous bridge connections exist.\n\nCronje argues that such solutions are effective only when the blockchain is completely blocked, when other bridging mechanisms cease to function.\n\nIn an industry characterized by rapid innovation and evolving terminologies, debates such as the one sparked by Fantom\u2019s potential integration of optimistic rollups are not uncommon.\n\nThe nuances of these discussions are not merely semantic, but reflect the ever-expanding horizons of blockchain technology.\n\nFantom\u2019s exploration of this frontier indicates a willingness to experiment and push boundaries, even as it leads to conceptual debates that challenge established norms.\n\nConclusions\n\nIn conclusion, Fantom Foundation\u2019s ongoing investigation of integrating optimistic rollups as a bridge between its blockchain and Ethereum shows the dynamic nature of the blockchain ecosystem.\n\nThe potential benefits of increased security and liquidity are undoubtedly enticing, but the semantic debate over whether such solutions qualify as layer 2 networks or rather serve as a bridge offers a fresh perspective that could influence future discussions in the blockchain community.\n\nAs the field continues to evolve, the adoption of different viewpoints and the reevaluation of established concepts will undoubtedly contribute to its growth and maturation."

        "title": "Ethereum's Vitalik Buterin: \"AI does not replace human work, but enhances it\" - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum, is optimistic about Artificial Intelligence (AI), saying that rather than taking away 30% of jobs, it should save 30% of human labor.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Vitalik Buterin: Artificial Intelligence (AI) does not replace human labor\n\nAccording to reports, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin seems to be quite optimistic about Artificial Intelligence (AI).\n\nSpecifically, Buterin argues that instead of taking away jobs, AI should save human labor. Here are his words:\n\n\u201cI think one of the positive aspects of this is that I think it\u2019s a good example of how, instead of AI killing 30% of the jobs, which would be catastrophic and terrible, it\u2019s like, AI is killing 30% of your job, which is like actually an amazing time saver.\u201d\n\nIn essence, the co-founder of Ethereum does not see emerging technology as a substitute for human labor, but rather that it complements it. In other words, it is a matter of enhancing people\u2019s talents, rather than replacing them.\n\nAs an example, Buterin talked about AI-based image generators and individual content creators. For the Russian computer scientist, AI platforms can help creators make films and artistic works without the need for Hollywood-style high production costs.\n\nHere are his words:\n\n\u201cThe thing happening that we don\u2019t want to see is artists getting replaced; the thing that I wants to see is an author, instead of just being able to write a novel, also being able to personally make a movie. I would want to see the cost of making a movie go down from $100,000 to one person with basically just his creativity and a couple of months with an AI platform.\u201d\n\nVitalik Buterin from Ethereum and AI: the most significant development and the regulation\n\nMoving on with his speech, Buterin also called AI one of the most significant developments in all of history.\n\nHere are his words:\n\n\u201cThis human to superhuman AI transition, that level of transition, I would argue has only happened basically three or four times in the history of the Earth.\u201d\n\nAs technology advances, Buterin also notes that regulation remains limited in being able to deal with future risks.\n\nIn this regard, the Ethereum co-founder suggests that regulations should be case-targeted, rather than across-the-board bans that hinder innovation.\n\nNot coincidentally, the very chairman of the US Securities and Exchange Commission, Gary Gensler, recently spoke out on the issue, saying that AI will be the cause of future financial crises.\n\nSpecifically, Gensler\u2019s biggest fears relate precisely to generative AI tools such as ChatGPT that want to transform businesses and companies, perhaps creating new and potential conflicts of interest between companies and investors.\n\nThe price of ETH and Ethereum futures ETFs\n\nAs Ethereum\u2019s co-founder shares his views on AI, its crypto ETH continues to hover around the $1850 price point.\n\nETH\u2019s trend seems to have been fairly stable for a while now, with its annual peaks occurring last month at a price of over $2,000 and in April at a price of $2135. Otherwise, from March to the present, ETH has remained between $1800 and $1900, touching $1650 in May.\n\nRecently, news emerged that the SEC is to evaluate four new applications related to Ethereum futures ETFs.\n\nThese are the four applications submitted by VanEck, ProShares, Bitwise and Roundhill, which came after the application that seems to have launched the Volatility Shares initiative.\n\nGiven that the SEC has long since approved ETFs based upon futures contracts on the price of BTC, there should be no problem in approving those on Ethereum as well. If that were the case, perhaps the price of ETH might be able to get a more significant pump."

        "content": "Decentralized trading platform PancakeSwap has announced a partnership with software development company BloXroute to implement protection against the unwanted presence of Mev bots on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nMev bots play a key role in Ethereum\u2019s transaction architecture by creating a homogeneous marketplace at the price level, yet they are often the root cause of front-run attacks against the end user.\n\nWith this new feature, the user experience should take a huge step forward, going to make the DeFi world more efficient and transparent.\n\nEthereum: What are Mev bots?\n\nWhen talking about the internal structure of Ethereum block validation we cannot avoid mentioning the so-called Mev bots, which play a very important role nowadays.\n\nWithout falling into complex terminologies, we can describe these bots as a state-of-the-art technique that exploits the sorting of transactions during the process of block verification by a validator to go speculating on price slippage during trading on DEXs such as PancakeSwap.\n\nThe term \u201cMEV\u201d stands for \u201cMaximum Extractable Value\u201d and is intended to represent all those techniques aimed at maximizing the profit of these individuals (who run specialized bots and software) involved in handling transactions on Ethereum from the mempool to the final inclusion within a block.\n\nFront-run attacks are where mev bots are able to profit most: by choosing to include, omit, or reorder certain TXs in a block, the mev can place OWN ORDERS in advance of others and gain from the impact generated on prices at the expense of other users.\n\nOther instances of gain for mevs involve arbitraging the value of an asset across different decentralized markets and liquidating borrows in lending platforms.\n\nAll of this harms the experience of the end user who will have to deal with high price slippage and the risk of being frontrunners.\n\nAt the same time, the presence of these bots helps marketplaces based on AMM mechanisms to level asset prices across different platforms, avoiding price discrepancies and enabling more efficient lending activity on DeFi.\n\nPancakeSwap and the partnership with bloXroute: a protection against Ethereum mev bots\n\nThe decentralized exchange PancakeSwap has found a solution by partnering with the technology company bloXroute to prevent Mev bots from practicing front run attacks against its users on the Ethereum blockchain and BNB chain.\n\n\ud83e\udd1dbloXroute is excited to partner with @pancakeswap to help DeFi traders on #BSC and #Ethereum.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\ude03bloXroute\u2019s Protect RPC integration into PancakeSwap will give users free access to private transactions and industry leading inclusion rates for secure and efficient trading.\n\n\n\n1/4 pic.twitter.com/QdYxB48cL0 \u2014 bloXroute Labs (@bloXrouteLabs) August 8, 2023\n\nIn particular, those who trade cryptocurrencies on the DEX will be able to access bloXroute\u2019s RPCs for free, helping them to get better price execution on their swaps.\n\nThese RPCs ensure that TXs sent through them are not visible in the mempool, thus preventing a Mev bot from identifying a profit opportunity and swapping the sorting of a block at will.\n\nIn the previous version of MEV Protect RPC on BNB Chain, the protection rate offered by bloXroute on PancakeSwap was 85% while with the latest update, full coverage will be possible.\n\nThe feature requires less than a minimum to be enabled on a non-custodial wallet like Metamask and can generate large economic benefits for the end user.\n\nRegarding the news, PancakeSwap\u2019s head chef Mochi stated that:\n\n\u201cPancakeSwap is pleased to work with a leading industry partner bloXroute, to protect our users from MEV activities such as front-running and sandwich attacks. This collaboration aims to maximize the value our users receive.\u201d\n\nFor the DeFi world to compete with centralized crypto service providers, it is critical that when a user performs a swap, the process is easy, fast, inexpensive, and with real-time pricing reference.\n\nIn and of itself, this niche market presents significant risks related to hacks and exploits of decentralized platforms: if there are not constant improvements in the way individuals approach executing transactions it is safe to assume that decentralized finance will never reach mass adoption.\n\nThis partnership between Pancakeswap and bloXroute is precisely aimed at improving the efficiency of DeFi environments and making the user experience more enjoyable.\n\nBloXroute Labs and research in the crypto space\n\nBloXroute represents one of the most prominent blockchain software development companies in the crypto industry with a very strong presence and commitment to the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nThe Chicago-based tech startup aims to take trading on decentralized exchange platforms to another level.\n\nThrough its blockchain distribution (BDN) and hyper-connectivity on Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polygon and Solana, the BloXroute team is able to offer low-latency DeFi with protection against Mev and price manipulation.\n\nAbout 350 trading firms in the decentralized finance world take advantage of BDN infrastructure to get faster and more efficient data that can offer a high inclusion rate and more competitive transaction propagation.\n\nOf note, about 40% of the volume running on Ethereum travels through BloXroute\u2019s relayers and more than 500,000 validators connected to it.\n\nIn recent months the company has focused on the world of Mev-bots and devising a solution to prevent sandwich/front-run attacks without damaging the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nIn this regard, during the last ECC in Paris, the Chicago-based company\u2019s CEO, Uri Klarman, presented a solution called \u201cInstant Inclusion Ethereum\u201d (iiETH) that allows for real-time blockchain inclusions of transactions with protection against Mev-attacks.\n\nBelow you can find his speech during the conference explaining this innovation:"
