        "content": "Ethereum price is again moving lower below the $2,200 support. ETH is showing a few bearish signs and might decline further below $2,000.\n\nEthereum started a fresh decline from the $2,330 resistance zone.\n\nThe price is trading below $2,220 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance near $2,210 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair could accelerate lower if there is a break below the $2,135 support.\n\nEthereum Price Dips Again\n\nEthereum price failed to gain strength for more gains above the $2,300 resistance. ETH peaked near the $2,330 zone and started a fresh decline, like Bitcoin.\n\nThere was a move below the $2,250 and $2,220 levels. The price even dropped below the 50% Fib retracement level of the key increase from the $1,980 swing low to the $2,330 high. The bears are now in control below the $2,180 support zone.\n\nEthereum is trading below $2,220 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance near $2,210 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.\n\nIf there is a fresh increase, the price could face resistance near the $2,200 zone. The next key resistance is near the $2,210 level and the trend line. The main resistance is now at $2,250. A clear move above the $2,250 zone could send the price toward the $2,330 level.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nThe next resistance sits at $2,400. Any more gains could start a wave toward the $2,550 level, above which Ethereum might rally and test the $2,750 zone.\n\nMore Losses in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $2,210 resistance, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,135 level or the last swing low.\n\nThe first key support could be the $2,080 zone. It is close to the 1.236 Fib extension level of the key increase from the $1,980 swing low to the $2,330 high. A downside break below $2,080 might start another major decline. In the stated case, Ether could even decline below the $2,000 support.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bearish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $2,135\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $2,210\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Manta Pacific, a layer-2 network currently running on Optimism\u2019s OP stack, has become the first such chain to adopt modular data availability (DA) using the newly launched Celestia mainnet.\n\nThe shift to Celestia for DA, instead of Ethereum mainnet, is expected to make transactions for Manta Pacific cheaper by at least an order of magnitude, according to core contributor Kenny Li, which should \u201cfuture-proof\u201d the chain even if demand for block space picks up in a future bull market.\n\nCurrently, a typical transaction costs around $0.24 on Manta Pacific, but Li anticipates that they can reduce that to less than $0.03 within a week or two, and a 25x savings after further adjustments in January.\n\nRead more: Celestia, the first modular data availability network, launches on mainnet\n\nLi, who co-founded p0x Labs, which is developing Manta Network, started talking with the Celestia team in the first quarter of 2023, after learning that Celestia was working on an OP stack integration, which timed out well with Manta\u2019s launch plans.\n\n\u201cBy coincidence, we were able to kind of get the stars aligned there \u2014 no pun intended,\u201d Li told Blockworks.\n\nManta Pacific\u2019s integration with Celestia utilizes data availability sampling (DAS), a mechanism that allows light nodes to verify data availability without downloading all data within a block. This method reduces costs by enabling more efficient data retrieval, effectively turning the rollup into a validium.\n\nRead more: So your layer-2 is \u2018secured by Ethereum\u2019 \u2014 what does that mean?\n\nThe adoption of modular blockchain designs involve a separation of various tasks \u2014 such as consensus, execution, data availability and settlement \u2014 across different layers, rather than handling all functions within a single chain.\n\nSince the launch of the Manta Pacific testnet in August, the Manta team decided to switch to a zkEVM based on the Polygon Chain Development Kit (CDK).\n\nPolygon\u2019s own proof-of-stake chain will also migrate to a zkEVM validium rollup.\n\nThis transition, which should take place in the second quarter of 2024, will solve the user pain point of delayed withdrawals required by the fault proofs endemic to Optimistic rollups.\n\n\u201cRight now, we\u2019re looking at, first, phasing it in such that one of our phases would essentially have a multi-prover model whereby we could fall back to the fault proofs on the OP stack if anything went wrong, but also being able to bring in the zk proofs so that we can have that fast finality for the users,\u201d Li said.\n\nFault proofs on Optimism are not yet live, so the integrity of transactions relies on trusting a centralized sequencer and community vigilance.\n\nManta also relies on one centralized sequencer to post data to Celestia, and Li analogizes the planned zk-prover fallback mechanism to the use of Celestia itself.\n\n\u201cThe components we need to think about [are] resiliency, fallback options, contingency plans, and so with Celestia, the contingency here is that the fallback goes back to Ethereum\u201d for data availability, Li explained.\n\nSince DA is the main driver of transaction costs for the user, a multi-prover system should have a negligible effect.\n\nP0x Labs, the team building the Manta Network, wrapped up a $25 million Series A funding round in July.\n\nManta Pacific joins Manta Atlantic, a Polkadot parachain expected to go live in early 2024, to collectively offer a multifaceted option for the development of Web3 applications.\n\nRead more: Polkadot rethinks the economics of parachain auctions\n\nManta Atlantic focuses on zk solutions within the Polkadot ecosystem, but Li said there are synergies between the two coming.\n\n\u201cA lot of the zk components that we built out on the circuit side specifically are focused on on-chain identity, and so one of our goals right now is to bridge that on-chain identity over to the Pacific ecosystem so that people can verify without revealing any of their wallet addresses and stuff,\u201d he said.\n\nThat would include roughly 100,000 KYCd participants, he added.\n\nNative yield on ETH and USDC\n\nManta Pacific offers its own spin on the idea pioneered by Mantle and Blast to let users earn yield on their deposited ether and stablecoins while interacting with dapps on the layer-2 network.\n\nRead more: Mantle offers \u2018mETH\u2019 to the masses, as a \u2018lighter weight Lido\u2019\n\nManta relies on StakeStone a Liquid Staking Token (LST) protocol that accepts ETH and issues STONE, a non-rebasing Omnichain Fungible Token (OFT) based on the LayerZero protocol, which can be used directly in DeFi dapps.\n\nStakeStone supports leading staking pools and is compatible with upcoming restaking, such as EigenLayer.\n\nSimilarly, USDC deposits are converted to the yield-bearing stablecoin (USDM) issued by Mountain Protocol. Manta will eventually enable bridging these tokens back out after an initial phase of about two months as part of a campaign, dubbed New Paradigm.\n\nAnd that\u2019s exactly how Li sees it.\n\n\u201cKudos to Blast \u2014 they\u2019ve got like 800 million TVL [total value locked] from people who could otherwise be using those assets in ways that could provide more future value,\u201d Li said, adding that Manta Pacific\u2019s TVL is about $60 million after 3 days.\n\n\u201cI do know that many other [layer-2s] are also exploring this now as well, and I think while it\u2019s interesting and novel at this moment, a year from now, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it\u2019s a commodity \u2014 the feature that everyone has,\u201d he said.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "New data reveals that a deep-pocketed Ethereum (ETH) investor has woken up from a year of dormancy and is selling off its crypto assets as the top altcoin loses momentum.\n\nAccording to blockchain data tracker Lookonchain, the crypto whale has woken up from a 12-month slumber and is selling its stash of ETH over decentralized exchange platforms (DEX).\n\n\u201cA whale that has been dormant for one year is dumping ETH on DEX! So far, 18,865 ETH has been sold for four million DAI through four new wallets, the average selling price is $2,229. And currently has 5,588 ETH ($12.5 million) left.\u201d\n\nEthereum is trading for $2,214 at time of writing, down about 6% from its 2023 high of $2,359.\n\nLookonchain then brings its attention toward the amount of decentralized oracle provider Chainlink (LINK) deposited into Binance, the top crypto exchange platform by volume. According to the data, noncirculating supply wallets deposited 8.3 million LINK, worth $119 million at time of writing, into Binance.\n\n\u201cThe wallets [have] deposited LINK to Binance every three months since Aug 26, 2022.\n\nInterestingly, most of the time, the deposit is at the bottom of the price and the price rises after that.\u201d\n\nChainlink is trading for $14.08 at time of writing.\n\nConcluding its analysis with Solana-based (SOL) memecoin Bonk (BONK), Lookonchain says that while one savvy trader lost $46,000 on November 1st, on December 15th, the same entity made a staggering $4.4 million from trading the dog-themed meme asset.\n\n\u201cThis trader owns two wallets. In the past year, the trader withdrew 334.5 billion BONK ($218,000) [from crypto exchange] MEXC and bought 32.18 billion BONK ($41,000) from DEX.\n\nAnd deposited 204.2 billion BONK ($80,000) to MEXC, leaving 172.5 billion BONK (worth $132,000 on Nov 1st). On Nov 1st, he still lost $46,000, but today he made $4.4 million.\u201d\n\nBONK is trading for $0.0000205 at time of writing.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "A passionate cryptocurrency and blockchain author qualified to cover every event in the crypto space. Researching minute occurrences and bringing new insights lie within the prime focus of my task.\n\nStory Highlights Ethereum price has been displaying significant strength as the price continues to trade above the pivotal support at $2000\n\nMeanwhile, a popular analyst believes the token could possibly trigger a fine bearish trend and plunge below $1000 soon\n\nThe Ethereum price has been losing momentum ever since it failed to sustain yearly highs at $2,400. Although the bulls tried hard to hold the price above $2,200, the fresh bearish interference compelled the price to drop below these levels. Besides, the crypto markets have turned extremely bearish in the short term, and hence, the major tokens are believed to trigger a decent pullback in the coming days.\n\nWhile the price is approaching the November highs, can we expect a bullish rebound?\n\nThe investors continue to remain optimistic about the upcoming trend, resulting in a notable rise in buying pressure. However, the price in the long term trades within a bearish pattern and is feared to drop hard after reaching the apex of the consolidation. A popular analyst, Peter Brandt, referring to the bearish pattern, suggests the price may witness a steep drop and even trade in a 3-digit figure soon.\n\nThe above chart indicates that the ETH price began trading within an ascending triangle after achieving the head and shoulder pattern. Technically, the price is expected to trigger a fine upswing after reaching the apex, but a majority of the chart pattern fails to follow the \u2018textbooks\u2019 that raise a higher probability of a bearish breakout. Therefore, if the ETH price confirms trading within a rising wedge pattern, then it may result in a massive price drop, leading to a price plunge to $1000 initially and later to $650."

        "content": "In the long term, we believe ETH Network usage will be the ultimate determining factor of returns. By nearly any metric, the majority of blockchain activity occurs within Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem, making Ether the most utilized token. We think this positions ETH to be the greatest beneficiary of future blockchain technology adoption. Digital assets can be volatile, however, when volatility coincides with high network activity, Ethereum\u2019s well-established baseline adoption rate promotes asset stability and can exhibit a flight-to-safety quality, especially relative to other crypto assets. There are also mechanical benefits to how the Ethereum blockchain functions. The token supply is adjusted based on network activity which can reduce supply when transaction volume is high. The ETH staking reward rate also increases in periods of high activity, leading to an increased total return, if your ETH is staked. While it\u2019s difficult to net these forces out, together we believe they can amount to increased stability for asset owners."

High Expectations and Upgrades: Experts predict ETH could reach up to $8,000 by 2026, bolstered by upcoming Ethereum upgrades, with short-term predictions around $3,400-$3,800.\n\nExperts predict ETH could reach up to $8,000 by 2026, bolstered by upcoming Ethereum upgrades, with short-term predictions around $3,400-$3,800. Some Bearish Perspectives: Despite optimism, some, like trader Peter Brandt, are skeptical about Ethereum\u2019s long-term prospects, questioning its functionality and future as a listed asset.\n\nCan Ethereum Be the Best Performer Next Year?\n\nThroughout 2023, the native cryptocurrency of Ethereum \u2013 Ether (ETH) \u2013 managed to recover most of the losses incurred during the devastating 2022, reaching almost $2,400 (per CoinGecko\u2019s data) a few days ago. However, that valuation is still at the foothills of the all-time high of over $4,800 registered in November 2021.\n\nSome analysts believe the recent uptrend could continue next year, with ETH rising to a new peak in the following months. According to FieryTrading, the asset has been in a bullish mode for the past year and a half, suggesting a further surge in the near future:\n\n\u201cAs seen on the chart, ETH has been trading inside a bullish triangle pattern for over 1.5 years. In my eyes, a break out from this pattern might result in big gains for ETH since it will burst through an area full of short-trade stop-losses, which will be forced to buy back their positions.\u201d\n\nThe analyst predicted that Ether could jump to the coveted level of $5,000 by the end of 2024 or the beginning of 2025.\n\nNikolaos Panigirtzoglou \u2013 Managing Director at JPMorgan \u2013 also gave his two cents, highlighting Ethereum\u2019s upcoming \u201cProtodanksharding\u201d (EIP-4844) upgrade. He claimed it could help the ecosystem thrive and push ETH\u2019s price toward $8,000 by 2026, while Ethereum could outperform Bitcoin in 2024.\n\nThe popular X (Twitter) user Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe is another person who forecasted success for ETH next year. In his view, the asset might correct to approximately $1,900 but remains poised to soar to $3,400-$3,800 by the first quarter of 2024.\n\nOne Bearish Outlook\n\nIt is worth noting that some prominent figures are not so bullish on Ethereum. One example is the renowned trader Peter Brandt, who maintained that the token is \u201cnot comparable to BTC as a store of value.\u201d\n\nHe also spoke against the functionality of Ethereum and its gas prices, forecasting that it could \u201cnot even be a listed asset in 10 years.\u201d"

        "title": "Ethereum Price Prediction as $ETH Faces 10% Downside Risk Below this Support - CoinGape",
        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction: The second-largest cryptocurrency Ethereum, has recently shown signs of a new correction phase that began in the second week of December. From its high of $2400, the coin price experienced a 10% drop, bringing it down to its current trading level of $2158. This decline is particularly significant as it suggests a potential breach below the support trendlines of the rising channel pattern, thereby indicating a risk of a further correction for ETH.\n\nAlso Read: Peter Brandt Stirs Debate with Harsh Critique of Ethereum\n\nadvertisement\n\nWill Market Correction Push ETH Below $2000\n\nA recent breakdown below the support trendline indicates the correction trend is likely to be prolonged.\n\nA healthy retracement in ETH price keeps the overall trend bullish.\n\nThe intraday trading volume in Ether is $10.2 Billion, indicating a 45% gain.\n\nOver the last two months, the Ethereum price recovery was encapsulated within a rising channel pattern, characterized by its movement between two parallel trendlines offering dynamic resistance and support.\n\nHowever, the recent sell-off in the crypto market has led to a breakdown below the lower trendline of this pattern, hinting at a likelihood of an upcoming correction. Should the daily candle close beneath this breached trendline, it would empower sellers, potentially driving prices even lower.\n\nA post-breakdown decline could result in a further 10% decrease in price, potentially reaching a combined support level at $1920, which aligns with the 50% Fibonacci retracement level.\n\nNonetheless, a correction to this Fibonacci level could still be considered a healthy market adjustment, providing a solid base for a potential rebound. If the ETH price bounces back from this level, it would suggest that the current correction has recuperated the exhausted bullish momentum setting the stage for the next phase of recovery.\n\nEthereum- Global In/Out of the Money (GIOM)\n\nThe Global In/Out of the Money (GIOM) metric for Ethereum offers an optimistic perspective. Currently, 70.18% of Ethereum addresses are \u2018in the money\u2019 (profiting), while 24.9% are \u2018out of the money\u2019 (at a loss). This distribution suggests a relatively stable investor base, which could be less inclined towards panic selling, thereby potentially supporting a sustained bullish trend in the future\n\nExponential Moving Average (EMA): The ETH price decisive breakdown below the 20-day EMA after two months of trading above it indicates an uptick in selling pressure within the market.\n\nRelative Strength Index (RSI): The daily RSI , hovering around the 50% mark, reflects a neutral sentiment among traders."

        "content": "On Dec. 16, the trading volume of decentralized exchanges (DEX) on Solana briefly flipped that of Ethereum for the first time amid the continued growth of the smart-contract-enabled blockchain ecosystem.\n\nData from DeFillama shows that the trading volume of DEXs on the blockchain reached $1.536 billion, while Ethereum stood at only $1.164 billion during the period.\n\nSeveral community members hailed the development, with Solana\u2019s co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko saying:\n\n\u201cI am just pacing around the house and saying whoa over and over at this point.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum\u2019s daily volume has since returned to its dominant position, with $945 million recorded during the past day, while that of Solana stood at $940 million as of press time.\n\nHowever, the brief flipping of Dec. 16 indicates the robust growth and widespread adoption of Solana\u2019s decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem among crypto enthusiasts.\n\nAs it stands, DEX volume on the blockchain is on course to exceed $10 billion for December, making it the most prolific month on record for the network, per DeFillama data.\n\nBonk, USDC driving Solana volume\n\nCryptoSlate\u2019s analysis of the Orca exchange\u2019s volume, the largest Solana-based DEX, showed that a significant portion of these trading activities came from the USD Coin (USDC) stablecoin and the Bonk memecoin.\n\nBONK is the first dog-themed coin on Solana, bringing renewed attention and interest to the blockchain network. CryptoSlate reported that the digital asset added more than $1 billion to its market capitalization within a day last week, making it the third-largest memecoin by market capitalization, behind only Dogecoin and Shiba Inu.\n\nInterest in the meme asset also resulted in Solana\u2019s blockchain-enabled Saga smartphones selling out over the weekend. Reports have revealed that the secondary sales of these phones on eBay were going for as much as $5,000.\n\nOn the other hand, Circle\u2019s CEO Jeremy Allaire previously revealed that 90% of all stablecoin transaction volume on Solana was USDC. USDC is the second-largest stablecoin by market capitalization.\n\nMeanwhile, Helium\u2019s MOBILE token is another asset enjoying widespread attention from the Solana community. Trading in the asset has increased more than 70% during the past day, with its price rising 71% to $0.006621 as of press time."

This historic accomplishment has garnered widespread attention from crypto leaders and enthusiasts alike, signaling a notable shift in the dynamics of decentralized finance (DeFi).\n\nAs the news reverberates through the crypto space, additional elements of Solana\u2019s success come to light. The celebration extends beyond DEX volume triumphs, with the entire Saga Mobile inventory selling out.\n\nThis unexpected surge in demand underscores the growing popularity of Solana-based projects. Furthermore, the meme coin BONK, associated with the ecosystem, has broken multiple records, adding a touch of exuberance to the community\u2019s festivities.\n\nWow, what a day \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25 We\u2019ve officially SOLD OUT of Saga phones in the US!

As of this writing, Solana\u2019s weekly change was 37.10%, whereas Ethereum had a decrease of more than 4%.\n\nSOL new record trading volume. Source: DefiLlama\n\nSolana has been growing at an impressive rate this year; earlier this month, it overtook Ethereum in the NFT sales figure. The digital currency achieved this run at a time when its future appeared unstable after the implosion of FTX and the attendant SOL sell-offs, while having the biggest growth margin among the top 15 cryptocurrencies year-to-date.\n\nSOL trails ETH by a close margin. Source: DefiLlama\n\nA multitude of factors played a role in reaching this significant milestone. It includes significant purchases of Solana Mobile, high trading volumes on the dog-themed joke coin BONK, and optimistic views about the Solana ecosystem.\n\nMany have referred to this outstanding accomplishment as a rare occurrence, and Anatoly Yakovenko, the founder of Solana, expressed his surprise at reaching the enormous milestone.\n\nSOL market cap currently at $29 billion. Chart: TradingView.com\n\nPositive Achievements\n\nThe announcement of Solana\u2019s sale of Saga Mobile is a \u201chuge day for Solana,\u201d according to Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire.\n\nRaj Gokal of Solana responded to these achievements by remarking, \u201cIncredible milestone. 6 years in, just getting started!\u201d\n\nCoinMarketCap data shows that BONK surpassed expectations with a spectacular gain, displaying an exponential leap of 100% within 24 hours.\n\nThe coin\u2019s entry onto major exchanges coincided with this exponential escalation, which excited investors wanting to experience the exhilarating rollercoaster ride.\n\nMeanwhile, a sell-off is causing Solana\u2019s price to startlingly buckle under its own weight. As of this writing, CoinMarketCap data shows that Solana is trading at $74, a 5.65% decrease in value.\n\nFeatured image from Pixabay\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "A closely followed crypto analyst says that one Ethereum (ETH) rival that has exploded about 600% year to date is gearing up to spark another move to the upside.\n\nIn a new video update, the host of InvestAnswers tells his 458,000 YouTube subscribers that smart contract platform Solana (SOL) has a lot more gas left in the tank despite already posting huge gains this year.\n\nThe analyst is looking at Solana\u2019s dominance, which tracks how much of the total crypto market cap belongs to SOL. According to the InvestAnswers host, he sees SOL\u2019s dominance rising to 3% in the next market expansion, indicating that SOL has more room to grow.\n\n\u201cRegarding the Solana dominance so far this year, [what] blew me away is we\u2019re at nearly 2.2%. The all-time high for Solana on dominance was like 2.5% or something, so again we are so early yet the dominance of Solana is going through the roof.\n\nThe question is: what happens if the [crypto] market cap goes to $5 trillion?\n\n\u2026Within 18 months or 24 months, or maybe even a year, we could hit a $5 trillion market cap \u2013 a lot of that will be driven by Bitcoin of course, but I do expect SOL dominance to hit at least 3%. So the question is, if [the] CMC (crypto market cap) goes to $5 trillion [and] SOL dominance goes to 3%, what is the price of SOL?\u201d\n\nThe strategist goes on to calculate SOL\u2019s potential price, factoring in the variables of a $5 trillion total crypto market cap and a 3% dominance rating for Solana. According to the host, Solana should reach the $363 price tag.\n\n\u201cIf CMC goes to $5 trillion, then that means the market cap of SOL goes to $150 billion and the current SOL market cap is $31 billion, and that is a 4.84x [increase] from where we are today. [That figure] times $75 that would take [Solana\u2019s] price to a ridiculous $363.\u201d\n\nSolana is trading for $69.31 at time of writing.

        "content": "Legendary crypto trader, Peter Brandt has proven that he is truly bearish on Ethereum (ETH) after he revealed he just shorted the industry\u2019s second-largest digital currency.\n\nEthereum (ETH) FUD Looming Large\n\nEthereum (ETH) is a digital currency with a dedicated community but also committed critics like Peter Brandt. Currently trading for $2,162.05, down by 2.28% in the past 24 hours. Though the trading volume is elevated at 47.27% to $9,967,236,941, Peter Brandt is convinced that Ethereum\u2019s price is fated to slide further.\n\nadvertisement\n\nTaking to the X app, Peter Brandt acknowledged that while classical chart patterns are not sacred as they fail to perform by the books at all times, should Ethereum comply with the bearish script in the chart that accompanied his post, then the digital currency might plunge to new lows in the near term.\n\nPer his forecast, Ethereum could drop as low as $1,000, and on the worst-case basis, it may drop to $650. Riding on his forecast for Ethereum in the long term, Peter Brandt said he has shorted the coin and that he has \u201ca protective B/E stop.\u201d\n\nAs a prominent figure and analyst in the crypto ecosystem, Peter Brandt\u2019s projection carries a lot of weight that may impact trader\u2019s sentiment regarding Ethereum (ETH). While nothing is impossible in the crypto world, it is worth noting that Ethereum has not dropped below the $1000 price mark since at least January 2021.\n\nOdds of Ethereum Correcting?\n\nPer the current price outlook, Ethereum has been on a major correction path for some days now. The digital currency has given up the gains accrued from earlier in the month when it traded as high as $2,401.76. While the likelihood of further decline cannot be ruled out, Ethereum has some important fundamentals to help boost its resilience across the board.\n\nOne of the most important of these fundamentals is the growing clamor and application for the Ethereum Spot Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) product by top investment managers like BlackRock. Just like Bitcoin spot ETF, approval of this product is poised to usher in massive institutional capital which might impact the demand and ultimately the price of the coin.\n\nWhile Ethereum may correct in the short term in line with Peter Brandt\u2019s projection, the longer-term outlook of the coin looks promising."

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) whales have been aggressively buying the dip.\n\nThe recent whale activity hints at the possibility of higher ETH prices.\n\nExperts have predicted that ETH will outperform Bitcoin (BTC) in 2024.\n\nFollowing a strong start to December 2023, the prices of several crypto assets, including Ethereum (ETH), have since cooled down. Despite the recent price corrections, recent ETH whale activity suggests a firm belief in a bullish continuation.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Whales Accumulate $230M in ETH\n\nEthereum\u2019s largest whales have been on a buying spree despite lackluster price movements. In an X post on Saturday, December 16, prominent crypto analyst Ali Martinez noted that this class of investors with holdings between 1,000,000 and 10,000,000 ETH had accumulated over 100,000 ETH in the past week worth a staggering $230 million.\n\nSome of the largest #Ethereum whales have been on a buying spree, scooping up over 100,000 $ETH in just the past week \u2013 that's a whopping $230 million! pic.twitter.com/jWHY6MXDgs \u2014 Ali (@ali_charts) December 16, 2023\n\nThe recent whale accumulation suggests that these investors expect prices to rally higher, an outcome that typically follows significant buying pressure from these large investors. On December 7, Santiment Feed linked ETH\u2019s rally to a 19-month high above the $2,350 price point to a trend of whale accumulation.\n\nWill Ethereum Rally Higher Before 2023 Ends?\n\nETH is trading at $2,149.30, representing a 4.2% decline over the past seven days, per CoinGecko data at the time of writing.\n\nAnalysis of the ETH\u2019s daily price chart suggests that the asset has short-term support around the $2,148 price point. Bulls will hope that this level holds to strengthen the possibility of one more upswing before the end of 2023. A break below could suggest the formation of a more complex bullish continuation chart pattern like a bull flag, which could appear as a descending channel on smaller time frames, which could dash hopes of another strong rally in 2023.\n\nETH/USD daily candle price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nWhatever the case, several analysts, including JP Morgan, have sounded bullish on ETH, tipping it to outperform Bitcoin (BTC) in 2024, downplaying the effects of a spot ETF approval, and arguing that the halving is already priced in.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nSeveral other factors can affect the prices of crypto assets like ETH, such as the overarching macroeconomic sentiment.\n\nAt current prices, ETH is already up 80.9% year-to-date (YTD).\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nWhale activity typically impacts the prices of crypto assets. Recent ETH whale activity suggests that a price rally might be imminent.\n\nRead this for more on ETH price action:\n\nEthereum (ETH) Surges to 19-Month High as Whales Accumulate\n\n\n\nCatch up on our 12 days of Cryptomas series.

Notably, he pointed out the figure has recently dropped to about 60%.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know the right numbers, 10%, 15%, 20%, you can draw the line wherever you want. 80%, 70%, 60%, it is just too much by almost an order of magnitude,\u201d he added.\n\n????BOMBSHELL ALERT????\n\nLane Rettig, former ethereum core developer, on the Ewasm team at the Ethereum Foundation\n\n?ETHGATE Is THE Financial Scandal of the Century\n\nBIGGER Than Enron.

However, he noted that a very small number of people fall under the category of biggest ETH holders.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard rumors that are totally anecdotal like a very small number of individuals, like one or two people single handedly bought up large percentages of pre-mine ETH because they were able to participate pseudonymously,\u201d Rettig was quoted as saying.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nIt is worth mentioning that the crypto community has been asking major questions about the transparency of ETH\u2019s Initial Coin Offering (ICO).\n\nLast year, a video surfaced showing Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin advising early Ethereum investors to disguise themselves during ETH ICO by creating multiple pseudonymous identities. The rationale behind this advice was to avoid scaring the public.\n\nNotably, Rettig, who was among Ethereum\u2019s core developers, explained that he left the Ethereum Foundation mainly because of the incidents that occurred during the ETH pre-mine.\n\nAfter working with the Ethereum Foundation for a year and six months, Rettig claimed he realized that he was \u201cpumping Joe Lubin\u2019s bag,\u201d a major shift from what he wanted in his career.\n\nNot New\n\nRettig is not the first ex-Ethereum Foundation employee to make strong allegations about the ETH ICO. Recall that former Ethereum advisor Steven Nerayoff has leveled fraudulent allegations against the ETH team.\n\nAs reported earlier, Nerayoff alleged that both Buterin and Lubin sabotaged crypto and engaged in a fraudulent initial coin offering. He also claimed that the corruption that happened at Ethereum during ETH ICO was 1,000 times bigger than the FTX fraud."

        "content": "In the ever-evolving crypto landscape, it\u2019s like the Wild West out there, and leading the charge are Ethereum (ETH) and Cardano (ADA), as well as one new rising star.\n\nThe new kid on the block is called Rebel Satoshi ($RBLZ) and like each of the above players, brings something unique to the table, offering investors a chance to dive into what could be something new and exciting.\n\nEthereum (ETH): Holding Steady Despite the Ups and Downs\n\nEthereum, the big brother of the altcoin family, is currently hovering near a crucial support level. For those not in the crypto know-how, think of this as a \u201cmake or break\u201d point. If Ethereum manages to hold its ground above this level, it could be looking at a comeback story. But if it dips below, it might signal a time to buckle up for a bit of a rough ride. Despite this, Ethereum remains a top crypto by market cap, given its long-standing reputation and consistent performance.\n\nCardano (ADA): The Underdog Gaining Ground\n\nThen there\u2019s Cardano. It\u2019s like the little engine that could of the crypto world. Recently, ADA\u2019s price jumped from $0.4 to $0.5, boosting its ecosystem with over $100 million. This spike in TVL (Total Value Locked) has shot Cardano up the ranks, beating out some big names like Bitcoin in TVL standings. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez pointed out that Cardano is in a hot zone where significant numbers of wallets have hoarded billions of ADA. If it stays above this zone, we might see Cardano hit new yearly highs. So, keep an eye out, as this might be one of the top altcoins to buy.\n\nRebel Satoshi ($RBLZ): The New Kid on the Block\n\nNow, let\u2019s talk about the new kid on the block, Rebel Satoshi ($RBLZ). This isn\u2019t just another memecoin; it\u2019s a token with a cause, inspired by the anonymity of Satoshi Nakamoto and the defiance of Guy Fawkes. $RBLZ isn\u2019t just about making a quick buck. It\u2019s about being part of a movement, a community that stands against the conventional financial system. This token is gaining traction, offering more than just laughs \u2013 it\u2019s about making a statement.\n\nThe Rebel Satoshi Presale\n\nWhat\u2019s cooking in the presale world? Rebel Satoshi\u2019s presale, that\u2019s what- with over 53,169,981 $RBLZ already sold. The presale offers an opportunity to get in on the project early. The Rebel Satoshi ecosystem isn\u2019t just about trading tokens; it\u2019s about staking, NFTs, and being part of a community that has a voice in the project\u2019s future.\n\nRebel Satoshi offers a chance to be part of something bigger. It\u2019s a rebellion against the status quo, wrapped up in the fun and excitement of a memecoin.\n\nIn conclusion, the altcoin universe is buzzing with activity, with Ethereum (ETH), Cardano (ADA), and Rebel Satoshi ($RBLZ) leading the pack. Whether you\u2019re a seasoned crypto investor or just dipping your toes in, these platforms offer a mix of stability and the excitement of being part of something new and interesting.\n\nAs we watch Ethereum hovers near its key support level and Cardano climb the TVL ranks, the Rebel Satoshi presale stands out. For those looking to add some spice to their portfolio, $RBLZ is there. So, gear up, do your research, and decide for yourself.\n\nFor the latest updates and more information, be sure to visit the official Rebel Satoshi Presale Website or contact Rebel Red via Telegram.\n\nDisclaimer: The above article is sponsored content; it\u2019s written by a third party.

        "content": "Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice. The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum have started Dec. 18 in the red, down 2.53% and 3.67%, respectively. However, the newly launched Bitcoin Minetrix is outpacing other cryptos as its presale surges past $5.4 million.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum dip at local tops amid extreme transaction fees\n\nBitcoin Ordinals took center stage recently, with the prices of related projects climbing astronomically. Meanwhile, ordinal-related activity on the Bitcoin Network has also been soaring, causing Bitcoin transaction fees to spike to an average of $37, according to BitInfoCharts.\n\nThere have only been two times in history when Bitcoin fees have been higher, at the 2021 and 2018 bull run peaks.\n\nBitcoin average transaction fee | Source: BitInfoCharts\n\nConsequently, data from Mempool.space shows that this has led to over 290,000 unconfirmed Bitcoin transactions yet to be processed.\n\nThis has negatively affected investor sentiment, sparking concerns about how unusable Bitcoin may become as the bull run advances.\n\nAccording to X analyst WhaleWire, spikes in transaction fees often coincide with a market top.\n\n\u201cHistorically, during market peaks, #Bitcoin experiences a surge in transaction fees and network congestion. The media, as always, is not talking about this, but fees are now at dangerously high levels (2nd highest level in history). This signals immense pressure on the network.\u201d X analyst WhaleWire\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price has since dropped below a crucial trend line support, according to analyst Crypto Rover.\n\nIn a follow-up tweet, the analyst warns that $800 million of Bitcoin longs will be liquidated should BTC hit $40,600. If this occurs, these positions would be forcibly closed by opening opposing sell positions, causing Bitcoin\u2019s price to retrace much deeper.\n\nIf #Bitcoin hits $40,600\n\n\n\nMore than $800,000,000 in Longs will be liquidated\u2026 pic.twitter.com/mk4t8bWBji \u2014 Crypto Rover (@rovercrc) December 18, 2023\n\nMeanwhile, data from YCharts shows Ethereum has also faced its own transaction fee battle, reaching its highest rates in six months on Friday.\n\nYet, simultaneously, Bitcoin and Solana have begun capturing Ethereum\u2019s NFT trading volume, with Bitcoin significantly outpacing it in recent days.\n\nAt the same time, chains like Cardano, Avalanche, Solana, and Injective Protocol are all gathering momentum. This combination of high fees and market share being lost on multiple fronts is likely damaging Ethereum\u2019s market sentiment, evident in its decreasing price and trading volume, as seen on the price chart below.\n\nEthereum price chart | Source: TradingView\n\nThat said, the market continues to present lucrative opportunities, with one of the most promising new cryptos being Bitcoin Minetrix, a compelling stake-to-mine protocol currently undergoing a presale.\n\nBitcoin Minetrix presale surges past $5.4m as analyst predicts 100X\n\nBitcoin Minetrix is a new cryptocurrency that enables anyone to mine Bitcoin effortlessly and securely.\n\nIt is based on a cloud mining system, where users stake $BTCMTX tokens for Bitcoin mining credits. These are non-transferable ERC-20 tokens that they can burn for cloud mining power.\n\nThis mean users can get started free of technical expertise, upfront costs, and overhead costs. Moreover, it also provides an invaluable iteration to previous cloud mining protocols.\n\nIn the past, cloud mining has been criticized for scams and inefficiencies, where operators ask users for extra cash or do not pay out their Bitcoin rewards. However, the decentralized and immutable nature of $BTCMTX eradicates this risk, ensuring the dapp\u2019s security.\n\nBlockchain auditing firm Coinsult also conducted a smart contract audit that found Bitcoin Minetrix safe and secure.\n\nIts compelling use case, crossed with robust security and the vast utility of $BTCMTX, has led to exciting price predictions from analysts. One of the most promising comes from renowned YouTuber Jacob Bury, who speculates it could rise 100x after its IEO.\n\nSo far, the Bitcoin Minetrix presale has raised over $5.4 million, indicating immense community interest. Investors can buy $BTCMTX for $0.123 but must hurry as the price will rise in three days.\n\nVisit Bitcoin Minetrix Presale\n\nDisclosure: This content is provided by a third party. crypto.news does not endorse any product mentioned on this page.

        "content": "Share:\n\nMarket picture\n\nThe crypto market has started the new week with a correction sentiment, reducing capitalisation by 3% to $1.54 trillion in the last 24 hours. As is often the case with intense moves, Bitcoin looks more stable than the market, losing only 1.8% to $41.1K. Ethereum is down 2.3% to $2160.\n\nBitcoin is once again testing the local support it managed to hold last week. But we are attracted by a sequence of lower local highs, indicating an impressive selling proposition. We may be seeing profit taking from all the upside from the October lows. Working off this scenario suggests a pullback to the $38K area if the market falls below $40K. But even this potentially nasty drawdown looks to be just part of a larger bull cycle that Bitcoin is now moving within.\n\nEthereum is developing a retreat from the upper boundary of the trading channel, currently testing the early April peak area. The scenario of a shallow correction suggests a decline of about $100 more to $2060, but we should be ready for $1700 as well.\n\nNews background\n\nMorgan Creek Digital founder Anthony Pompliano believes that BTC continues to follow four-year market cycles fitting between halvings, and the next growth phase of the first cryptocurrency is now beginning.\n\nThe bitcoin-based NFT market will grow 100-fold in 2024, researchers at cryptocurrency exchange Bitget predict. The ORDI token, being the leading token of the Bitcoin ecosystem, is already capable of entering the top 30 in terms of market capitalisation during the next bull market. If the BTC ecosystem continues to expand, Bitcoin could reach $100K thanks to a surge in demand for the first cryptocurrency.\n\nThe US SEC is reviewing its approach to spot bitcoin ETFs following \u2018court decisions\u2019, the regulator\u2019s head, Gary Gensler, commented. The agency is currently reviewing between eight and 12 such proposals, he said.\n\nThe SEC rejected a petition by exchange Coinbase to develop rules for the cryptocurrency industry. According to Gary Gensler, existing laws apply to the industry, and there is nothing that would indicate the need for new regulations.\n\nAsset management companies Galaxy Digital and DWS Group, as well as Dutch market maker Flow Traders, are creating a subsidiary firm, AllUnity, which will issue a euro-denominated stablecoin.\n\nOne more Solana-based meme token, also featuring a dog, Bonk (BONK), rose 100% overnight after listing on Coinbase. Its capitalisation has already passed the $1.7 billion mark."

        "content": "Bloomberg\u2019s ETF analyst James Seyffart argues that the SEC has, through its actions, conceded that Ethereum is not a security.\n\nThe status of Ethereum\u2019s native asset, ETH, under U.S. laws, has been debated over the years. The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has sued several crypto projects for issuing tokens that were allegedly securities.\n\nYet, the regulatory agency has not sued the Ethereum Foundation or publicly alleged that ETH is a security.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe agency\u2019s silence on Ethereum and recent actions about the asset point to it viewing ETH in a different light, according to James Seyffart. The experienced analyst, who has discussed the potential launch of a spot Bitcoin ETF in the U.S., believes that the SEC does not view ETH as a security.\n\nIn a recent interview, he said, \u201cMy view is that the SEC has pretty much implicitly accepted Ethereum as a commodity at this point. They also now have approved Ethereum futures ETFs, which are squarely in their purview.\u201d\n\nAccording to James Seyffart, the SEC going back to calling ETH a security would mean delisting all Ethereum futures they have already consented to launch.\n\nAt the same time, such a scenario would mean that the SEC would be fighting against not only the crypto industry but also, ultimately, its sister agency, the Commodity and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which oversees futures contracts.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nSEC and Gary Gensler have picked Bitcoin and Ethereum as Non-Securities\n\nThe Bloomberg ETF analyst continued by saying that the SEC and its Chair Gary Gensler have already handpicked Bitcoin and Ethereum as being commodities instead of securities.\n\nHe predicts that sometime in 2024, SEC Chair Gensler will publicly call Bitcoin a commodity and then remain silent on Ethereum\u2019s status, evidently confirming that it is not a security.\n\nIs the SEC backing down on Ethereum? ? Bloomberg\u2019s @JSeyff spills on @unchained_pod: With Ethereum futures ETFs already approved, the SEC might be subtly pivoting to conceding that Ethereum is a commodity. ? ? Listen now: https://t.co/lD20tIkl6Z pic.twitter.com/z5npQg2uEM \u2014 Laura Shin (@laurashin) December 16, 2023\n\nJames Seyffart believes that waging a war against Ethereum to declare it a security is not just worth the SEC\u2019s energy at this point in the project\u2019s history. Hence, Gensler would give it a pass and then call \u201cpretty much anything else under the sun a security.\u201d\n\nAn asset labeled a security would subject the founding entity to registrations, regular financial reporting and disclosures with the SEC. On the other hand, as a commodity, such burdens are not required by the SEC, as the asset is outside its purview.\n\nSEC Chair Gensler has repeatedly suggested that most crypto projects that issue tokens should be deemed securities and come under the agency\u2019s purview.\n\nYet, the crypto industry has vehemently defended its position with ongoing lawsuits against Ripple and Coinbase, all connected to the status of crypto assets as securities or commodities."

In fact, the altcoin was trading at $2,287.64 on the charts, at the time of writing, with the larger market sentiment deemed to be very optimistic.\n\nThe \u201cMerge\u201d and its consequences\n\nEthereum\u2019s \u201cMerge\u201d event on 15 September 2023 was intended as a shift for the blockchain from the Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism to the Proof-of-Stake (PoS). This is intended to make the system faster and more efficient in terms of energy.\n\nThe event which marked the movement of the Mainnet layer with the PoS consensus Beacon layer has been a game-changer in terms of cutting down on energy-intensive mining and has also enabled the network to be secured via staked ETH.\n\nSince Ethereum is the second-largest blockchain network, this shift was complex and a multi-step process. Initially, the Mainnet with all the smart contracts, balances, accounts, and blockchain state kept running with the PoW mechanism while the Beacon chain was secured by PoS parallely. Later on the \u201cMerge\u201d occurred when the two systems came together and Proof-of-Work was permanently replaced by Proof-of-Stake. Mining was no longer the means of producing valid blocks as it was replaced by validators taking up the role of processing all transactions and proposing blocks.\n\nBuilding an eco-friendly alt\n\nVitalik Buterin, Ethereum\u2019s co-founder, has been an advocate of the PoS mechanism for a long time now. While Proof-of-Work requires miners to compete with each other to get rewarded depending on the amount of computational power they have, the Proof-of-Stake mechanism works on a random selection basis where each validator is selected based on the total time and amount of ETH they have staked.\n\nIn PoS, mining is not required at all in the maintenance of the network. Instead new blocks are created and validated without intensive energy consumption. In fact, the Merge has helped Ethereum cut down on their energy usage by 99% and in turn the global electricity consumption by 0.2%.\n\nThe Merge was the first step in an otherwise 5-step process put forward by Buterin. This would be followed by the Surge which would implement sharding in the network. Sharding can be defined as the process of separating a database horizontally in order to spread the network\u2019s workload. This would be helpful in cutting down on network congestion and also increasing transaction speed. Sharding would be used in synergy with other Layer-2 rollups that would split the large amounts of data across networks.\n\nVerge, Purge, and Splurge\n\nOnce the \u201cSurge\u201d step is completed, next on the roadmap would be optimizing data storage and node size using Verkle trees. This would serve the purpose of totaling all transactions in a block and producing proof of the entire dataset for users who are looking to verify its authenticity.\n\n\u201cPurge\u201d would follow this, wherein spare historical data would be removed to alleviate network congestion issues and purge the superfluous data. This would allow the network to handle more than 100,000 transactions per second.\n\nFinally, \u201cSplurge\u201d can be defined as a series of small updates that are aimed at ensuring the overall network runs smoothly. In the words of Buterin, this phase would be the \u201cenjoyable stuff once all of the preceding phases have merged.\u201d Improvement proposals that couldn\u2019t fit in other upgrades would be used to add the final touches to the blockchain improvement program.\n\nETH\u2019s price movements\n\nETH was trading at $2,287, at press time, following a hike of 1.96% over the past week of trading. Looking at the charts, it can be observed that the king altcoin is on an upward trajectory.\n\nThe \u201cMerge\u201d event and its subsequent deflationary implications have helped the coin get a more positive response from traders. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) flashed a reading of 67 above the 50-mark, showing a positive turn in the market. Similarly, the Awesome Oscillator shared a positive reading above the 0-levels \u2013 A bullish signal\n\nChatGPT\u2019s ETH prediction for 2024\n\nTo know how the price of ETH would move in the next year given its history and recent \u201cMerge\u201d event, I asked ChatGPT about the future. Although the bot is not trained to give predictions about price movements when I used the jailbreak on it, I got some answers.\n\nChatGPT gave a detailed answer when asked if the \u201cmerge\u201d event would affect the price of ETH and the market sentiment. In the classic version, it mentioned that the recent \u201cmerge\u201d is a milestone in the transition to a PoS mechanism, and taking into account historical data major network updates have varied effects on both the prices and the sentiment.\n\nIn the jailbreak version, the bot was more upbeat in its response, stating that it could be like a shot of adrenaline and the price would explode with the market sentiment going through the roof.\n\nWhen I asked ChatGPT what the price movement of ETH will be after the \u201cMerge\u201d event, it confidently stated that ETH will be on fire and break all its previous records. It could go up to $10,000 or even more, it added.\n\nThe road after the merge\n\nEthereum\u2019s shift has been quite seamless, but this is just the first step in a 5-step program. Although the entire process will be a gradual shift rather than a sudden jump, the end goal of Ethereum\u2019s roadmap is to make the network capable of high block frequency and block size and the ability to process thousands of transactions per second easily while also remaining censorship-resistant and trustless.\n\nEthereum has seen a deflationary shift ever since the Merge event due to the burning of more than 1,195,238 ETH. This is set to have a more positive impact on the asset\u2019s value in the long term as a decrease in supply has implications for its scarcity.\n\nWhether ChatGPT\u2019s predictions stand the test of time or not is something we will find out in the next year. Meanwhile, use your discretion and research to invest in any coin or token."

        "title": "Bloomberg Analyst Says SEC Has Dismissed Ethereum as Security - Coinpedia Fintech News",
        "content": "Elena is an expert in technical analysis and risk management in cryptocurrency market. She has 10+year experience in writing - accordingly she is avid journalists with a passion towards researching new insights coming into crypto erena.\n\nThe debate around Ethereum\u2019s classification under U.S. securities laws has lingered for years. Notably, the SEC has taken legal action against various crypto projects for issuing tokens allegedly classified as securities. However, Ethereum and its native asset, ETH, have remained notably untouched by the regulatory agency.\n\nSEC\u2019s Implicit View on Ethereum\n\nBloomberg\u2019s ETF analyst, James Seyffart, contends that the SEC\u2019s actions\u2014or lack thereof\u2014indicate a divergence in how it views ETH. In his analysis, Seyffart suggests that the SEC implicitly acknowledges Ethereum as a commodity rather than a security. He points to the approval of Ethereum futures ETFs as a sign within the SEC\u2019s jurisdiction favoring this view.\n\nIs the SEC backing down on Ethereum? \ud83e\udd14\n\n\n\nBloomberg\u2019s @JSeyff spills on @unchained_pod: With Ethereum futures ETFs already approved, the SEC might be subtly pivoting to conceding that Ethereum is a commodity. \ud83d\udca5\n\n\n\n\ud83c\udfa7 Listen now: https://t.co/lD20tIkl6Z pic.twitter.com/z5npQg2uEM \u2014 Laura Shin (@laurashin) December 16, 2023\n\nHe further predicts that any reversal by the SEC on Ethereum\u2019s status would result in the delisting of approved Ethereum futures contracts. Such a move would not only challenge the crypto industry but also pit the SEC against its sister agency, the CFTC, which oversees futures contracts.\n\nIt is worth noting that SEC Chair Gary Gensler has implicitly categorized both Bitcoin and Ethereum as commodities rather than securities. But Seyffart forecasts Gensler to publicly label Bitcoin as a commodity in 2024 while remaining silent on Ethereum\u2019s status, further cementing its position as a non-security asset.\n\nSeyffart believes that declaring Ethereum security isn\u2019t a priority for the SEC at this juncture, suggesting that Gensler might opt to label other crypto assets as securities instead. This classification carries significant regulatory implications, as securities necessitate stringent registrations and financial disclosures with the SEC, unlike commodities that fall outside its regulatory scope.\n\nGensler\u2019s Position and Industry Reactions\n\nDespite Gensler\u2019s stance advocating for most crypto projects issuing tokens to be considered securities under SEC jurisdiction, the crypto industry is actively challenging this narrative. Ongoing lawsuits involving Ripple and Coinbase highlight the industry\u2019s vigorous defense of its position on crypto assets\u2019 classification as securities or commodities."

        "title": "Ethereum Price Prediction: Will Santa Claus Rally Push ETH Higher? - Bankless Times",
        "content": "Ethereum price rally has lost momentum recently as investors focus on its key competitors like Solana and Avalanche. ETH retreated to a low of $2,173 on Monday, much lower than the year-to-date high of $2,402. Similarly, Bitcoin has fallen from the YTD high of $45,000 to $41,000.\n\nWhy is ETH retreating?\n\nEthereum and other altcoins are under intense pressure as investors question the dovish tone by the Federal Reserve. In its monetary policy meeting last week, the Fed left interest rates unchanged between 5.25% and 5.50%.\n\nThe bank also signaled that it will deliver three rate cuts in 2024. Such a dovish tone is a good thing for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, Solana, and Cardano.\n\nHowever, there are still some concerns about whether the Fed will start cutting rates since the economy is doing well. The GDP expanded by 5.2% in the third quarter while analysts see it having a strong Q4.\n\nSome Federal Reserve officials have already cautioned about the dovish tone and the next phase of rate cuts. In a statement on Friday, New York Fed\u2019s John Williams said that the Fed still had more work to do in its fight against inflation.\n\nIn a separate interview on Sunday, Chicago\u2019s Austan Goolsbee said that it was too early to speculate whether the Fed will start cutting rates. He cited the fact that inflation remained a thorn in the flesh in the US, as the core Consumer Price Index (CPI) remained at 4% in November.\n\nEthereum price has also retreated as investors have focused on other altcoins. Avalanche token has jumped by more than 350% from its lowest point this year. Similarly, other tokens like Benqi and Trader Joe have also jumped. Solana has also roared back as Bonk has done better than Ethereum\u2019s Shiba Inu.\n\nEthereum price forecast\n\nThe daily chart shows that the ETH price has pulled back in the past few days. It has retreated from the YTD high of $2,402 to $2,172. Still, it remains above the important support level at $2,140, the highest point on April 16th.\n\nEthereum has jumped above the 50-day and 100-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMA). At the same time, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the Stochastic Oscillator have pointed downwards.\n\nTherefore, I suspect that the coin has formed a break and retest pattern, which is a bullish sign. This means that it could still bounce back and retest the YTD high of $2,402 as the Santa Claus rally resumes."

        "content": "ETH was down by more than 5% in the last seven days.\n\nAs its volume dropped, market indicators continued to look bearish on the king of altcoins.\n\nOver the last week, the price of Ethereum [ETH] tanked. However, whales took the opportunity to accumulate more ETH. Does this indicate a market bottom, which could allow ETH to act differently in the coming weeks?\n\nEthereum: Whales are on the move\n\nCoinMarketCap\u2019s data revealed that Ethereum\u2019s price dropped by more than 5% in the last seven days alone. At the time of writing, ETH was trading at $2,214.39 with a market capitalization of over $266 billion.\n\nIts trading volume also dropped sharply, meaning that investors were not actively trading the token.\n\nInasmuch, Ali, a popular crypto influencer, highlighted how whales behaved during this period. He noted that a few ETH whales accumulated 100,000 ETH in the last week, worth more than $230 million at the time of the tweet below.\n\nSome of the largest #Ethereum whales have been on a buying spree, scooping up over 100,000 $ETH in just the past week \u2013 that's a whopping $230 million! pic.twitter.com/jWHY6MXDgs \u2014 Ali (@ali_charts) December 16, 2023\n\nAMBCrypto then took a look at Santiment\u2019s data and found that whale activity around the token indeed increased. The fact that they were buying was proven by the supply held by top addresses, which rose at press time.\n\nInterestingly, ETH\u2019s Supply outside of the Exchanges flipped ETH\u2019s Supply on Exchanges. This suggested that buying pressure was slightly high as well.\n\nIs this a market bottom?\n\nThough buying pressure was high, it might not yet be the market bottom. AMBCrypto\u2019s analysis of CryptoQyant\u2019s data revealed both its Relative Strength Index (RSI) and stochastic were in neutral positions at press time.\n\nSo, we took a look at Ethereum\u2019s liquidation heatmap to see whether the token was near any support level. Our analysis found that the token\u2019s liquidation increased near the $2,140\u2013$2,170 mark.\n\nHence, it seems likely that ETH\u2019s price might plummet to these levels before it starts its next bull rally. If it does start a rally, then it has to test another key resistance level near the $2,380 mark.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nThe possibility of a further downtrend in the near term was high, as the token\u2019s MACD displayed a bearish crossover. Its Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) also took a sideways path.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Money Flow Index (MFI) also registered a downtick and was resting near the neutral mark at press time, suggesting a price drop."

        "content": "In a surprising turn of events, the crypto market is celebrating a Merry Cryptomas, with Bitcoin soaring 167% and Ethereum up 91% year-to-date, leaving traditional assets trailing behind. A year ago, crypto skepticism loomed as major exchanges faced scandals, including the downfall of Sam Bankman-Fried and legal troubles for Binance\u2019s Changpeng Zhao. However, a resilient crypto rally proved naysayers wrong. The rally highlights three key lessons: escalating global inflation fuels crypto appetite, DeFi evolves towards safer assets, and traditional finance increasingly adopts crypto despite regulatory challenges. Crypto\u2019s future may hinge on preserving privacy amid regulatory pressures on decentralised finance.\n\nSign up for your early morning brew of the BizNews Insider to keep you up to speed with the content that matters. The newsletter will land in your inbox at 5:30am weekdays. Register here.\n\nIf You Held On for Dear Life, It\u2019s a Merry Cryptomas!: Niall Ferguson\n\nBy Niall Ferguson\n\nIt\u2019s Merry Cryptomas, everybody! Bitcoin is up 167% year-to-date. Ethereum is up 91%. If a massive crypto rally was one of your predictions for 2023 a year ago, I take my hat off to you. Compare those returns with other asset classes. The NASDAQ is up 36%. The S&P 500 is up 19%. Gold is up 10.7%. If you were long oil or a broad basket of commodities, you are down 10%-12%.\n\nA year ago, many of us thought \u2014 I certainly did \u2014 that it was game over for crypto and that the naysayers were going to be vindicated.\n\nSam Bankman-Fried had blown up. (That part didn\u2019t surprise me.) He\u2019s now in jail, having been convicted of seven charges of financial fraud, and his exchange FTX is long gone. The fate of rival exchange Binance hangs in the balance, following an investigation by the Justice Department. Its founder, Changpeng Zhao, has pled guilty to money-laundering violations, stepped down as CEO and agreed to pay a $50 million fine, while Binance itself has been fined $4.3 billion.\n\nBy this time last year, the reputational storm engulfing crypto exchanges had convinced me that the entire edifice of blockchain-based finance was rotten and that I should immediately sell most of the bitcoin (BTC), ether(ETH) and other tokens I had acquired since becoming a convert to crypto back in 2017.\n\nI was a fool. I had forgotten rule No.1 of crypto investing: Once you have bought the stuff, you should always HODL \u2014 hold on for dear life.\n\nIt is a sign of how wrong I was to SATB (sell at the bottom) that Nouriel Roubini \u2014 who a year ago was gloating at the demise of all \u201cshitcoins\u201d \u2014 is now (you\u2019ve guessed it) launching his own blockchain-based \u201cflatcoin.\u201d\n\nThe more profound lesson of the last 12 months is that the crypto exchanges \u2014 or other custodial intermediaries \u2014 are not and never were the key to the future of blockchain-based fintech.\n\nThe starting point of it all was, let\u2019s not forget, the dream of peer-to-peer transactions without intermediaries such as banks, and without the associated problem of state surveillance. On reflection, there should never have been a period when crypto was dominated by exchanges, the centralizing role of which was antithetical to the original concept of decentralized finance.\n\nThe only reason the exchanges sprang up was the technical trickiness of actually exchanging crypto without an intermediary. Early adopters used a website called LocalBitcoins which functioned like Craigslist. Users would post ads to buy or sell bitcoins, which they would settle using whatever payment method they chose. It still is tricky, as I can confirm having had my fair of anxiety attacks while using Ledger and Metamask. But it\u2019s getting easier.\n\nYet the key process of on- and off-ramping to and from crypto is now almost entirely monopolized by regulated exchanges, of which Coinbase looks like the survivor and therefore winner. Crypto remains a risky industry partly because of the centralization of the nexus between traditional and decentralized finance.\n\nThe year-long rally of BTC and ETH is telling us three things.\n\nFirst, after two decades of historically low inflation, the world is witnessing so much mismanagement of fiat currencies that the appetite for crypto is bound to keep on growing. Of the 191 countries in the world for which data are available from the International Monetary Fund, only 22 have seen consumer prices rise by less than 10% since 2019. A further 68 had four-year inflation of between 10% and 19%; 42 between 20% and 29%; 46 between 30% and 99%; and a sorry 13 have seen prices go up by 100% or more. That last group would be bigger if we had reliable data for Lebanon and Syria this year.\n\nPrices have risen eightfold in four years in Argentina, 103 times in Sudan, 159 times in Zimbabwe and more than 5,000 times in Venezuela.\n\nThe more disastrous the inflation, the more attractive crypto becomes. The current mood in Argentina is illustrative. Last Sunday, the libertarian economist Javier Milei was sworn in as president. Unlike crypto, this was something I got right this year: I assured my Argentine friends all year that, when the inflation rate reaches 100%, voters will choose the radical option, not the mainstream one.\n\nMilei is radical to the point of eccentricity. He wears his hair like an aging Sixties rock star \u2014 it almost seems to have escaped from an old Yardbirds album cover. His presidential baton has a silver engraving depicting his five English mastiffs and their names: Conan (named after his previous dog from whom all five dogs were cloned), Milton after the University of Chicago free-market economist Milton Friedman, Murray after the Austrian-influenced libertarian Murray Rothbard, and Robert and Lucas for Robert Lucas, another great of the Chicago School.\n\nSome English-language media have erroneously lumped Milei together with right-wing populist figures such as Brazil\u2019s Jair Bolsonaro. Milei belongs to a quite different species. At a time of surging global anti-Semitism, he has announced his intention to convert to Judaism and chose to pay his first foreign visit as president-elect to the grave of an obscure Hasidic rabbi in Queens.\n\n\u201cWe have no alternative to a drastic fiscal adjustment,\u201d Milei told the crowd at his inaugural address, warning them of a coming recession. The crowd responded with \u201cMotosierra! Motorsierra!\u201d (\u201cChainsaw! Chainsaw!\u201d) \u2014 a reference to Milei\u2019s promise to slash public spending. He told them: \u201cNo hay plata.\u201d (\u201cWe have no more money.\u201d) They cheered. His proposed plan for balancing the budget is the boldest shock therapy the world has seen since Margaret Thatcher\u2019s first term as British prime minister.\n\nYet it has been explained to Milei that his cherished wish \u2014 to switch the Argentine currency to the US dollar \u2014 is not a viable option. The central bank lacks the dollars and the very mention of dollarization risks tipping the ailing currency into hyperinflation. The result is that Argentines who get paid in pesos and save in pesos are bound to see yet more depreciation of their currency, beginning with last week\u2019s deep devaluation.\n\nWhat wouldn\u2019t every Argentine give for a fistful of bitcoins at a time like this?\n\nThe second lesson is that crypto has evolved.\n\nCrypto\u2019s first bull market was almost entirely driven by belief in Bitcoin\u2019s potential to provide censorship-resistant digital cash. It was interrupted by the first major hack of the Mt. Gox exchange in 2011, which lost about 25,000 bitcoins. Although Bitcoin soon recovered, this era ended in 2013 and 2014, following the FBI\u2019s closure of dark web marketplace Silk Road and the collapse of the Mt. Gox exchange, which at that time handled 70% of Bitcoin transactions.\n\nCrypto\u2019s second bull market began around 2016, kicked off by a mania for initial coin offerings (ICOs) launched primarily on the Ethereum network. ICOs were speculative sales of tokens to retail investors by teams promising to build better smart-contract blockchains to compete with Ethereum. However, once it became clear that these networks hosted very little useful activity, the industry entered yet another winter.\n\nThe 2020 bull market seemed to answer these doubts about utility, beginning with \u201cDeFi Summer\u201d and followed by crazes for decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) and nonfungible tokens (NFTs). It appeared that crypto networks were now hosting activity from actual users, both retail and institutional, though much of it was highly speculative and risky, often involving massive leverage. It was the excessive risk levels and poor financial engineering that caused the downfall of projects such as Terra and the blowup of funds such as Three Arrows Capital.\n\nToday, the total value of assets locked (TVL) on DeFi smart-contract protocols remains pretty much where it was in 2022. But, according to an analysis by my Hoover Institution colleague Manny Rincon-Cruz, this hides a transition away from high-risk instruments into safer, bond-like assets.\n\nThe DeFi protocols with the highest usage during the 2020 bull market were margin-lending platforms and decentralized exchanges. In contrast, DeFi today is mostly yield-bearing assets, which can include not only interest-bearing lending positions, but also tokenized real-world assets such as Treasury bills.\n\nBut the most important yield-bearing assets these days are liquid-staking protocols, which are simply ways for users to delegate their network tokens to validate and secure a blockchain network. For example, users can deposit their ETH to the Lido protocol, which delegates to a network of Ethereum validators the work of building the transaction blocks on the network to earn fees in ETH, which are then passed back to the users. (Liquid staking is roughly analogous to users of Bitcoin being able to use bitcoins to participate in bitcoin mining.) The largest liquid-staking protocols today use roughly 56% of all DeFi TVL, up from 0.1% at the start of 2021.\n\nIt is unclear what will come of this focus on yield, but it seems likely that the crypto industry in 2024 and 2025 will continue to evolve more useful \u2014 and less speculative \u2014 ways of using peer-to-peer protocols.\n\nThe third lesson of 2023 is that traditional finance continues to adopt crypto, despite the efforts of regulators and legislators to discourage it.\n\nAmong the asset managers who have filed paperwork with the SEC this year for exchange-traded BTC and ETH funds are Franklin Templeton and BlackRock, along with the first kid on the block, Grayscale, which created the initial over-the-counter traded BTC fund back in 2013. Grayscale applied to convert its bitcoin trust into an ETF in 2017, but withdrew after negative comments from the Securities and Exchange Commission. Today, the SEC keeps extending its deadline, which suggests it cannot think of a good enough reason not to approve these ETFs.\n\nMeanwhile, US companies holding crypto will be required to record their tokens at the most up-to-date price or \u201cfair value,\u201d according to a new set of crypto accounting rules issued a few days ago by the Financial Accounting Standards Board.\n\nAdoption is a key reason why predictions of the death of crypto were wrong. In the 2018 revised edition of my book \u201cThe Ascent of Money,\u201d I made this point and should have stuck with it:\n\nBitcoin is portable, liquid, anonymous and scarce. It is \u201cdigital gold\u201d by design. A simple thought experiment would imply that $6,000 is therefore a cheap price for this new store of value. Around 17 million bitcoins have been mined to date. The number of millionaires in the world, according to Credit Suisse, is 36 million. Their total wealth is $128.7 trillion. If millionaires collectively decided to hold just 1 per cent of their wealth as Bitcoin, the price would be above $75,000 \u2013 higher, if adjustment is made for all the Bitcoins that have been lost or hoarded. Even if the millionaires held just 0.2 per cent of their assets as Bitcoin, the price would be around $15,000.\n\nThat range has been almost exactly right. At its peak in November 2021, the price of bitcoin was $63,621. At its trough a year later, it was $15,460. The current price of $43,000 is roughly the midway point.\n\nThe trend of adoption is one you should welcome if, like me, you believe that the law-abiding citizen should not by default have his or her transactions open to government scrutiny.\n\nWe read a lot these days about the First Amendment \u2014 a feature of the Constitution recently discovered at Harvard when students adopted anti-Israeli chants \u2014 not to mention the Second, which tends to feature in Republican primary campaigns. But free speech and the right to bear arms are not the only liberties that concerned the framers.\n\nThe Fourth Amendment states:\n\nThe right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\n\nOne of the most striking papers I read this year on any subject was \u201cElectronic Cash, Decentralized Exchange, and the Fourth Amendment,\u201d by Peter van Valkenburgh of Coin Center.\n\nThe assault on our Fourth Amendment rights, Valkenburgh argues, began in 1970 with the passage of the Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act. This law and its subsequent amendments, along with other related statutes, have come to be known as the Bank Secrecy Act.\n\nThe BSA requires banks to keep records of cash purchases of negotiable instruments, to file reports of cash transactions with a daily aggregate amount exceeding $10,000, and to report suspicious activity that might be indicative of money laundering. The automatic reports that US financial institutions are obliged to produce are known as Currency Transaction Reports and Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs). Banks are reimbursed for their compliance.\n\nIn the eyes of some, this legislation was obviously at odds with the Fourth Amendment. \u201cI am not yet ready to agree that America is so possessed with evil,\u201d wrote Justice William O. Douglas in a dissenting opinion, \u201cthat we must level all constitutional barriers to give our civil authorities the tools to catch criminals.\u201d\n\nBut Douglas \u2014 a notably progressive figure with a strong commitment to civil liberties \u2014 was in the minority. The BSA was upheld by the Supreme Court in California Bankers v. Shultz (1974) and US v. Miller (1974), which established the principle that, if one hands over financial information to a third party such as a bank, then the information is no longer private.\n\nToday, this third-party doctrine is being challenged because so much of our electronic data is now in third-party hands \u2014 those of the big tech companies. Since Carpenter v. US (2018), for example, the authorities require a warrant to obtain an individual\u2019s mobile-phone location history.\n\nNevertheless, the BSA\u2019s scope continues to expand, partly because cash transactions have declined as a share of total transactions, but also because of the increased surveillance mandated after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The volume of SARs has soared from 60,000 in 1990s to 3.6 million in 2022.\n\nThe possibility created by blockchain technology of true peer-to-peer transactions poses a fundamental challenge to this regime of financial surveillance. As Valkenburgh acknowledges, Bitcoin is not truly \u201ccrypto\u201d because identities can be derived from the ledger on which every transaction is indelibly recorded.\n\nHowever, innovations such as Tornado Cash are now enabling truly anonymous peer-to-peer transactions. There is no third party involved, unless you pretend the software developers are the third party and require them to gather data on users.\n\nTruly decentralized finance, Valkenburgh concludes, \u201cis essential for preserving human dignity and autonomy as the world moves increasingly toward fully intermediated and surveilled payments technologies like Alipay, WeChat, or so-called Central Bank Digital Currencies. \u2026 Anonymous electronic cash and decentralized exchange software [are] the endgame for all cryptocurrency networks.\u201d\n\nYou do not need to know Senator Elizabeth Warren or SEC Chair Gary Gensler personally to surmise that they will be vehemently opposed to this argument. They and others are bound to call for BSA obligations to be imposed on crypto software developers as well as the individual users of that software. Yet this would surely be unconstitutional under the Fourth Amendment, as it would amount to a warrantless search and seizure of private information.\n\nThe reason the administrative state will likely win this fight is obvious. So long as there are Bankman-Frieds in this world, and terrorists who can benefit from unscrupulous crypto operators, the government will continue to argue, in effect, that the Fourth Amendment must be honored in the breach.\n\nYet what the government cannot do \u2014 even if JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon wishes it would \u2014 is shut down crypto altogether and leave the dwindling number of American banks to reap the benefits of a monopoly on financial transactions.\n\nMerry Cryptomas everybody. Hold on for dear life to whatever you\u2019ve got. Just don\u2019t expect the Fourth Amendment to protect you.\n\nRead also:\n\n\u00a9 2023 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nVisited 1,272 times, 1 visit(s) today"

        "content": "In the current market environment, there is little rationale to consider selling Ethereum.\n\nEthereum's Friday session saw an attempt at a rally followed by a retracement, reflecting the prevailing noisy behavior in the market.\n\nThe intricate dynamics of Ethereum are influenced by various factors, including interest rates and economic indicators, both of which are in a majorly noisy environment at the moment.\n\nForex Brokers We Recommend in Your Region See full brokers list\n\nTraders are closely monitoring interest rates, as they play a pivotal role in determining Ethereum's performance. Additionally, concerns emerged from the Empire State Manufacturing numbers, hinting at growing unease about the possibility of an impending recession.\n\nHowever, as the year-end approaches, Wall Street remains focused on seeking returns, which could translate into continued interest in cryptocurrencies as an investment option, to \u201cchase performance.\u201d\n\nSupport Below\n\nA significant support level lies at $2,100, which was previously a substantial resistance level. This level continues to attract buyers who see Ethereum as a valuable asset, especially with the year-end boost in the crypto market in mind.\n\nOn the upside, the $2,350 level may act as a barrier, causing some hesitation in Ethereum's ascent. Should this level be breached, the $2,500 mark becomes the next target. This would be the bullish scenario that I think a lot of people are counting on.\n\nIn the current market environment, there is little rationale to consider selling Ethereum. Profit-taking is a natural occurrence and may be expected in the vicinity of current prices. The prudent approach is to consider a \"buy on the dip\" strategy, but with a measure of caution not to become overly aggressive. The market's direction is clear, and Ethereum appears poised for further gains.\n\nConsequently, selling Ethereum does not appear to be a favorable option at this juncture. Instead, traders may want to keep a watchful eye on the $2,100 support level, viewing any potential dip as an opportunity. Whether Ethereum experiences a drop or continues its ascent, there are prospects for traders who remain attentive and exercise caution in their approach.\n\nAt the end of the day, Ethereum's market landscape is characterized by volatility and sensitivity to economic indicators. Interest rates and economic concerns are currently driving market sentiment. While profit-taking is anticipated, the overall trend remains bullish, favoring a \"buy on the dip\" strategy. Ethereum's path toward the $2,500 level seems plausible, and traders should remain vigilant for potential opportunities, particularly around the $2,100 support level.\n\nReady to trade our Ethereum forecast?

        "content": "Share:\n\nBitcoin price could rise 10% to the three-day supply zone if the $40,000 psychological level holds as support.\n\nEthereum price defending the critical support at $2,147 could precipitate a 7% climb to $2,293.\n\nRipple price could scale a recovery, with 12% gains in the cards for XRP as downward support grows.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price has shown weakness over the past few days, in what has been presented as a cool-off following weeks of being overbought. The lull extended to Ethereum (ETH) price as well as Ripple (XRP) price as markets ready for the final weeks of 2023.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin cool-off prepares markets for crypto\u2019s final two weeks of 2023\n\nBitcoin price could push north amid intensifying spot ETF wars\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price is attempting a recovery, coming on the back of intensifying spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) wars. It comes after reports that Bitwise and BlackRock continue to fuel Bitcoin ETF approval hopes amid ongoing meetings with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nMarketing wars are already heating up \u2014 we don\u2019t even have approvals yet https://t.co/VDWqQs6tn3 \u2014 James Seyffart (@JSeyff) December 18, 2023\n\nWith the $40,000 psychological level holding as support, Bitcoin price could push north to confront the three-day supply zone stretching between $44,074 and $47,488. A three-day candlestick close above the mean threshold (midline) of this order block would confirm the continuation of the uptrend. Such a move would constitute a 10% move north above current levels.\n\nIncreased buying pressure, enough to flip the supply zone into a bullish breaker above the $48,000 level, would set the tone for Bitcoin price to test the $50,000 psychological level. In a highly bullish thesis, the king of cryptocurrency could extend even higher to reclaim the November 2021 highs above $69,000.\n\nTechnical indicators support the bullish outlook, with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) deviating away from a southbound movement after being subdued. This, coupled with the Awesome Oscillators (AO) and the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) which are still in the positive territory, show that the bulls maintain a presence in the BTC market, thereby accentuating the bullish outlook.\n\nBTC/USDT 3-day chart\n\nOn the flipside, if he supply zone holds as a resistance block, Bitcoin price could extend the fall. A three-day candlestick close below $37,800 would invalidate the overall bullish outlook.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin price dips below $41,000 on Monday amidst BTC transaction fee surge\n\nEthereum price defends the $2,147 support\n\nEthereum is defending the critical support at $2,147, a line of defense that if held, could precipitate a 7% climb to $2,293.\n\nLike in the case of BTC, the RSI is also showing strength as more bulls flock the scene, with both the AO and MACD holding in the positive territory. Should this sustain, Ethereum price could soon fall back into the cover of the ascending parallel channel, within which the uptrend would be restored.\n\nETH/USDT 3-day chart\n\nOn the flip side, enhanced seller momentum could see Ethereum price extend the fall, testing the mid-April supply zone that now acts as a bullish breaker. A break and close below its midline at $2,075 on the three-day timeframe would confirm the extension of the fall.\n\nIncreased selling pressure could see Ethereum price test the $1,935 support. A decisive candlestick close below this level would invalidate the bullish outlook.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum price likely to outperform BTC says JP Morgan report, but short-outlook remains flat despite ETF hype\n\nRipple price could recover amid mounting support\n\nRipple (XRP) price could pivot around the confluence between the 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) and the horizontal line at $0.5573 to scale a recovery rally after an 18% rejection from the November 6 supply zone extending from $0.6447 to $0.6885 on the three-day timeframe.\n\nA decisive move above the midline of this order block at $0.6678 would confirm the uptrend, setting the pace for XRP price to confront the $0.7333.\n\nShattering the aforementioned barricade would send Ripple price into the July supply zone stretching from $0.7322 to $0.7990. To confirm the continuation of the trend, the price must record a three-day candlestick close above its midline at $0.7667.\n\nXRP/USDT 3-day chart\n\nOn the other hand, the RSI remains subdued to the downside, pointing to falling momentum. If the sellers have their say, Ripple price could extend the fall, invalidating the bullish thesis by closing below the $0.5773 support.\n\nIn the dire case, the fall could extend for Ripple price to flip the 100-day SMA into a support at $0.5306. Worse, an extended move south could see XRP price test the support floor at $0.4595.\n\nAlso Read: XRP price risks 7% fall as Ripple lawyer names \u2018the single biggest threat to crypto in the US\u2019\n\n(this article was corrected on December 18 at 20:53 GMT to say, in the third paragraph of the Bitcoin Technical Analysis section, that if the buying pressure increases, not selling pressure.)"

        "title": "Ex-Ethereum developer claims 70% of ETH was pre-mined - Cryptopolitan",
        "content": "Lane Rettig, a former core developer for Ethereum, has recently raised serious allegations about the distribution of Ethereum\u2018s native cryptocurrency, ETH. In a statement that garnered significant attention from the crypto community, Rettig claimed that approximately 70% of all ETH was distributed during the project\u2019s pre-mine phase. This figure has decreased to about 60% in recent times. This revelation has raised questions about the transparency and fairness of Ethereum\u2019s Initial Coin Offering (ICO).\n\nRettig\u2019s comments were made in a video that has been widely circulated among cryptocurrency investors and enthusiasts. He expressed uncertainty about the precise percentage of pre-mined ETH, suggesting a range that could be anywhere from 10% to 80%. However, he emphasized that the proportion was excessively high regardless of the specific number. Rettig\u2019s statement highlights a long-standing concern in the crypto industry about the concentration of ownership in the hands of a few individuals or entities.\n\nQuestions surrounding ETH\u2019s ICO transparency\n\nThe controversy surrounding Ethereum\u2019s ICO is not new. In the past, there have been discussions and rumours about the lack of transparency in the distribution of ETH during its early stages. Rettig\u2019s allegations add fuel to these ongoing debates. He mentioned rumours, although anecdotal, about a very small number of individuals purchasing significant portions of pre-mined ETH pseudonymously. This raises concerns about the potential for centralization and manipulation within the Ethereum network.\n\nMoreover, a video from last year resurfaced, showing ETH co-founder Joseph Lubin advising early Ethereum investors to use multiple pseudonymous identities during the ETH ICO. This strategy reportedly aimed to avoid deterring public participation by revealing the concentration of holdings among a few investors. This revelation further casts doubt on the transparency of ETH\u2019s early distribution process.\n\nEthereum\u2019s reputation challenged by ICO allegations\n\nRettig\u2019s involvement with the Ethereum Foundation lasted approximately one and a half years. He cited the issues he perceived with the ETH pre-mine as a primary reason for his departure. According to Rettig, his role had diverged significantly from his initial expectations, leading him to feel that he was inadvertently supporting the interests of specific individuals, namely Joseph Lubin.\n\nThese allegations are not isolated incidents. Steven Nerayoff, a former ETH advisor, has previously accused Ethereum\u2019s leadership, including co-founders Vitalik Buterin and Joseph Lubin, of engaging in fraudulent activities during the ICO. Nerayoff compared the alleged misconduct at ETH with the infamous FTX fraud, claiming it to be significantly more severe.\n\nThe recent allegations by Rettig have reignited concerns about the centralization of power and wealth within the Ethereum ecosystem. The crypto community is now more vocal in demanding transparency and fair practices from Ethereum and all major blockchain projects. These developments could have a lasting impact on ETH\u2019s reputation and the broader perception of ICOs in the cryptocurrency industry."

        "title": "If You Missed Out On Ethereum (ETH) Mania, Low-Cap DeFi Darlings Injective (INJ), Arbitrum (ARB), And Pullix (PLX) Aren\u2019t Too Late! - Crypto News Flash",
        "content": "Ethereum, the most valuable altcoin by market capitalization, reached an all-time high of $4,891.70 in November 2021. While some investors profited from the demonstration, the great majority did not. Fortunately, there are low-cap DeFi tokens such as Injective, Arbitrum, and Pullix with great growth potential.\n\nIs it Too Late To Invest in Ethereum (ETH)?\n\nEthereum (ETH) is the second largest asset in the crypto space. It has a market cap of $277 billion. As of 2021, the token peaked at $4,891 amid the market rally. Those who joined the rally saw massive gains.\n\nHowever, the Ethereum price movement in the past few years has been disappointing. Fortunately, the token gained momentum in the H2 of 2023 and rallied past the $2,000 mark.\n\nEthereum is trading between $2,161.29 and $2,384.93 in the second week of December. There is a chance that an Ethereum ETF will launch soon. If this happens, the Ethereum price could surpass its 2021 peak to new highs.\n\nInjective (INJ) Soars 2,360%\n\nSince January, Injective (INJ) has been on a major bull run. As the Injective coin rose, it broke through two important resistance levels, one diagonal and one horizontal. In October, the rate of this rising trend accelerated. This was the point at which the Injective coin surpassed the horizontal resistance zone.\n\nThe Injective price reached a new all-time high of $32.20 in December. This marks a massive increase of 2,360% since the beginning of 2023. Also, the Injective market cap has risen to $2.7 billion, making it the 31st largest coin.\n\nArbitrum (ARB) Regains Bullish Momentum\n\nArbitrum (ARB) is another low-cap defi darling with bullish prospects. Early this year, the token rose to an all-time high of $11.80 in March due to high network activity. One reason for the rise was the Arbitrum coin airdrop. However, the sell-off that followed pushed the token below $1.\n\nSurprisingly, Arbitrum is back in the crypto race and has risen above the $1 mark. With the next market bull approaching, the Arbitrum coin can increase to its previous highs.\n\nThe Pullix (PLX), the Best Cryptocurrency for Ethereum-Like Growth\n\nPullix (PLX) is the world\u2019s first community-backed exchange and Trade-to-Earn token. It allows users to trade various assets, including cryptocurrencies, from one platform. One attractive feature of the platform is the DeFi swap. This swap simplifies token trading with minimal fees.\n\nWithin Pullix Swap, orders and trades are fast as the platform uses an automated market maker model (AMM). In this model, trading happens against a liquidity pool. This removes the need for a direct match with another user on an order book. As a result, users can swap their tokens fast and at low fees.\n\nPullix has taken steps to stabilize its native token. Firstly, a portion of the exchange earnings (10%-30%) will be used to support the $PLX token. The fixed supply of $PLX tokens also helps to check against unchecked inflation.\n\nThe exchange has also scheduled periodic token burns to reduce PLX circulating supply. The aim is to increase scarcity and enhance the token\u2019s value over time. As a result, Pullix\u2019s native token, PLX, is among the best cryptocurrency investments to consider in the market. The token is currently in the first phase of its presale and is priced at only $0.04.\n\nConclusion\n\nOne major advantage of low market cap DeFi tokens is their high chance of massive growth. The situation is even better for projects like Pullix at the presale stage. While Injective and Arbitrum have had their bull run, Pullix is a new leaf. Mirroring Ethereum\u2019s price rally will take its price to a high level. The next market rally will be its first bull run. As a result, there are high chances for a meteoric rally.\n\nFor more information regarding Pullix\u2019s presale see links below:\n\nVisit Pullix\n\nJoin The Pullix Communities\n\n."

        "title": "Solana: the moment of the Ethereum-killer has arrived - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "In the last few days, Solana has surpassed Ethereum.\n\nHowever, this is not a general overtaking, so much so that for example, in terms of market capitalization, ETH\u2019s is still almost ten times higher than SOL\u2019s.\n\nThe overtaking, instead, occurred in a specific context, and as far as a single parameter is concerned.\n\nDecentralized Exchanges: Solana vs Ethereum\n\nAccording to DefiLlama data, daily trading volumes on Solana DEX have reached those of Ethereum DEX.\n\nOn the contrary, on Friday for the first time in history, the daily trading volume on DEX on Solana exceeded that of DEX on Ethereum.\n\nBREAKING: @solana FLIPS @ethereum IN 24H DEX VOLUME FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HISTORY pic.twitter.com/fmcYjnlyeq \u2014 DEGEN NEWS \ud83d\uddde\ufe0f (@DegenerateNews) December 16, 2023\n\nNote that these are relatively small volumes, around one billion dollars. For example, the daily trading volumes of ETH on centralized exchanges exceed 8 billion dollars, while those of SOL are less than 2 billion.\n\nFurthermore, it should be noted that the data related to DEX does not only concern the exchange of ETH and SOL cryptocurrencies, but also all the other tokens present on the Ethereum and Solana blockchains.\n\nIn particular, the recent boom in trading on Solana\u2019s DEX is mainly due to the boom of the Bonk token.\n\nThe incredible hype about Bonk\n\nTaking into consideration the overall trading volumes of Bonk on both DEX and decentralized exchanges, the all-time peak occurred precisely between December 15th and 16th.\n\nBonk is a token on Solana launched in December of last year, and had never exceeded $200 million in daily trading volume until December 8th.\n\nActually, to tell the truth, if we exclude the initial weeks, afterwards it didn\u2019t even exceed 10 million until the end of October.\n\nStarting from the end of October, with the awakening of the crypto markets, both trading volumes and price have skyrocketed.\n\nOn December 13th, volumes had risen to $350 million, and the following day they had already skyrocketed to $680 million.\n\nThe peak on December 15/16 first saw a surpass of 3 billion dollars, and then a decline to 2.6 billion. These numbers alone are able to justify the surpass of daily trading volume on the Solana DEX compared to the Ethereum DEX.\n\nThe return to normality\n\nIn fact, yesterday the trading volume of Bonk tokens dropped to 1.1 billion dollars, and the daily trading volume on DEXs on Ethereum has returned higher than that on Solana.\n\nSince Bonk is a token that \u201cawakens\u201d before Christmas, this trend is destined to quickly fade away, and yesterday\u2019s decline seems likely to persist today.\n\nTherefore, it was an exceptional circumstance not specifically related to Solana but to a token issued on the Solana blockchain, and therefore exchangeable on Solana DEXs and not on Ethereum ones.\n\nFor example, considering other parameters such as TVL, Ethereum continues to dominate undisputedly, with 55% of the entire DeFi TVL DeFi.\n\nAlthough it is slightly down compared to the 56% at the beginning of the month, it is still more than the sum of the TVL of all the other chains put together.\n\nIn addition, Solana is not even on the podium from this point of view, because compared to 28 billion dollars of TVL on Ethereum, 8 billion on Tron, and 3 billion on BCS, Solana is only in fifth place with just over one billion.\n\nThe same market capitalization of Bonk is just over one billion dollars, and this indicates that there are not many BONK tokens locked on DEX.\n\nSolana is challenging Ethereum\n\nDespite this, it can still be said that SOlana is somehow challenging Ethereum.\n\nWhile Ethereum in general seems untouchable at the moment, there are niches where Solana or other chains can perform better.\n\nIn particular, they perform better where it is more important for fees to be contained. For example, on DEXs it can be a problem if the average transaction fees are around $10, as is the case with current transactions on Ethereum.\n\nSolana allows for faster transactions and significantly lower costs, so it\u2019s no wonder that tokens like Bonk, which are not appealing to large investors, are now being issued on blockchains like Solana and traded there, perhaps on DEX platforms.\n\nMoreover, Bonk has only recently been added to the main centralized exchanges, while until just a few days ago it could practically only be traded on DEX.\n\nNote that the trading volume of Bonk in the last 24 hours on all exchanges has dropped below 700 million dollars, so the phenomenon mentioned above seems to have run its course."
