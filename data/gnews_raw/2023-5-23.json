        "title": "Ethereum price pinned below $1.9K, and data suggests it's unlikely to change in short\u2013term - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Ether\u2019s price has been stuck below $1,920 for the past 16 days, which is especially concerning since the latest breakout attempt on May 6 lasted less than 24 hours. Excluding this brief price pump, Ether\u2019s (ETH) journey below $1,920 was initiated on April 21, over 30 days ago.\n\nOne can likely blame the Ethereum network\u2019s $8.80 average transaction fee for investors\u2019 diminished appetite, but the macroeconomic environment has also played an important role. On May 22, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said it is impossible to predict the outcome of the Federal Reserve\u2019s monetary policy, designed to curb inflation.\n\nAs CNN reported, Dimon added:\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re already seeing credit tighten up because the easiest way for a bank to retain capital is not to make the next loan.\"\n\nThe uncertainty surrounding the United States debt ceiling standoff between Joe Biden\u2019s administration and the U.S. Congress is the probable cause for the worsening sentiment among institutional investors toward cryptocurrencies. According to CoinShares\u2019 latest \u201cDigital Asset Fund Flows Report,\" outflows across digital asset investment products hit $232 million over the past five weeks.\n\nFurthermore, there are two indicators that impact Ether\u2019s price and signal reduced demand for its decentralized finance ecosystem, in addition to weak leverage buying activity from professional traders.\n\nTotal Ethereum deposits are stable, but there\u2019s a catch\n\nThe Ethereum network\u2019s limited processing capabilities have been causing high gas fees, which greatly reduces the demand for smart contract usage. For the past five weeks, the average transaction fee has remained above $8, although at first sight, no impact was felt.\n\nEthereum network applications' total deposits in ETH. Source: DefiLlama\n\nThe total value locked (TVL) in the network remained stable at 15.1 million ETH versus four weeks prior, but it is nearing the lowest levels since August 2020. As a comparison, the TVL on the BNB Smart Chain in BNB (BNB) terms was essentially flat in the same period, while TRX (TRX) deposits on the Tron network declined by 12%.\n\nBNB Smart Chain flips Ethereum\u2019s lead in DEX volume\n\nEthereum has historically been the absolute leader in decentralized exchange (DEX) volumes, but it all changed in the week ending May 21.\n\nWeekly DEX volume by chain. Source: DefiLlama\n\nThe Ethereum network\u2019s DEX market share drastically dropped from a 75.5% peak on March 5 to 22.3% on May 21. Meanwhile, BNB Smart Chain was the biggest beneficiary, growing to 61.1% from 5.6%.\n\nThe number of active addresses interacting with decentralized applications (DApps) is also in a slump. Over the last 30 days, the top 12 DApps running on the Ethereum network saw an 11% drop in active addresses, possibly reflecting investor dissatisfaction with the high transaction costs.\n\n30-day Ethereum DApp activity. Source: DappRadar\n\nData shows drop leverage traders using derivatives\n\nEther quarterly futures are popular among whales and arbitrage desks. However, these fixed-month contracts typically trade at a slight premium to spot markets, indicating that sellers are asking for more money to delay settlement.\n\nAs a result, ETH futures contracts in healthy markets should trade at a 4 to 8% annualized premium \u2014 a situation known as contango, which is not unique to crypto markets.\n\nEther 2-month futures annualized premium. Source: Laevitas\n\nAccording to the futures premium, known as the basis indicator, Ether professional traders have avoided leveraged longs (bullish bets) for the past four weeks. Moreover, not even the brief rally toward $2,000 on May 6 was enough to flip those whales and market makers into bullish sentiment.\n\nIn short, these three indicators signal bearishness \u2014 namely, the record-low DEX market share, the declining addresses engaging with DApps and a lack of leveraged buying demand.\n\nMaybe investors were expecting some kind of announcement out of Ethereum inventor Vitalik Buterin\u2019s appearance at Edcon 2023 in Montenegro, which wasn\u2019t the case \u2014 the fact is there\u2019s no imminent driver to justify a sustainable rally above $1,920 in the short term.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

        "content": "Bram Berkowitz\n\nThe Motley Fool\n\nWhat happened with cryptocurrencies today?\n\nSeveral of the largest cryptocurrencies fell today in what appeared to be a move driven by macro fears, uncertainty about the debt ceiling, and ahead of the release of the Federal Reserve's May meeting minutes today.\n\nSince late afternoon yesterday, the price of the world's largest cryptocurrency Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) traded 3% lower as of 11:45 a.m. ET today. Meanwhile, the price of the world's second-largest cryptocurrency Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) traded 3.2% lower, while the price of Litecoin (CRYPTO: LTC) was down 5.3%.\n\nSo what\n\nPart of what's been dogging cryptocurrencies today is the constant tug-of-war investors are having about their view on the Fed and interest rates and whether on not the Fed will pause its rate-hiking campaign at its next meeting. Currently, roughly 72% of investors are betting on a pause but that's a smaller percentage than it had been recently.\n\nFast-rising interest rates over the last year have crushed the likes of crypto and Bitcoin because they make riskier assets less appealing. Crypto has rallied this year largely on the belief that the Fed is preparing to end its rate-hiking campaign.\n\nWill they raise them again?Powell says Fed interest rates may not need to rise as much amid banking stress\n\nInflation has slowed a good amount this year but is still far away from the Fed's 2% target and the job market still looks extremely strong, which has investors questioning whether or not the Fed has seen enough data to end its rate-hiking campaign.\n\n\"Most developed markets are grappling with a shared problem. Core inflation is proving more stubborn than expected and remains well above central banks' 2 per cent targets,\" BlackRock analysts wrote in a recent research note. \"We think that means central banks can't undo any of their inflation-fighting rate hikes any time soon, even if financial markets think the Federal Reserve will start cutting rates before the end of the year.\"\n\nOn top of all of this, U.S. lawmakers still haven't reached an agreement to raise the debt ceiling, and the June 1 deadline when the U.S. could potentially default on its debt is rapidly approaching. Treasury yields have risen as a result of the uncertainty, which usually leads investors to take a risk-off approach.\n\nNow what\n\nCryptocurrencies have been rising all year on the belief that a Fed pause is near, but now investors are less sure that a pause and the rate cuts the market had been pricing in will actually materialize.\n\nAt 2 p.m. ET today, the Fed will release the minutes from its meeting earlier this month, which could shed light on whether or not the Fed will pause rates at its June meeting. The fact that we still don't have an agreement to raise the debt ceiling is concerning, but I'm hopeful lawmakers will eventually come to their senses. Cryptocurrencies tend to do well when the traditional financial system struggles, but if the U.S. defaults on its debt it's hard to know exactly what would happen.\n\nWhat happens if the US defaults?What you need to know as the debt ceiling deadline nears.\n\nI continue to believe Bitcoin and Ethereum are here to stay long term and like them as long-term investments. I own a little bit of Litecoin and there's talk that the altcoin may benefit from its upcoming halving event, but I really prefer Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nBram Berkowitz has positions in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin.

        "title": "Ethereum Staking Demand Skyrockets Following Network Upgrade - Blockworks",
        "content": "Ether (ETH) is witnessing its highest levels of staking activity following a critical update earlier this year.\n\nThe network\u2019s transition to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) late last year, coupled with Ethereum\u2019s \u201cShapella\u201d network upgrade in April, which enabled withdrawals of staked ETH as well as rewards, has led demand for new validators to reach its highest level in two and a half years.\n\nPreviously, users could stake their ETH to the Beacon Chain as early as December 2020, but it wasn\u2019t until Shapella was fully implemented that it became possible to withdraw.\n\nAs a result, over 1 million ETH was withdrawn shortly after the upgrade, sparking temporary concerns as to whether demand would simply rush to the exit indefinitely and cause the price of ETH to dip.\n\nYet, this rush has been balanced by an influx of eager validators waiting for activation, indicating a sustained demand for Ethereum staking, an analysis by Coin Metrics shows.\n\n\u201cThe entry queue has reached its highest level since the Beacon Chain\u2019s genesis in December 2020, with a total of 64,000 validators eagerly waiting to participate,\u201d Coin Metrics said.\n\nIn contrast, there are effectively zero validators wishing to withdraw, that are stuck in the queue. That\u2019s a stark contrast to withdrawal queues just last month, which stood at roughly 17,500.\n\nThe surge of new validators has helped drive the active validator count to a new high of nearly 584,000, data shows. This number has more than made up for the transient decrease in complete withdrawals that occurred when withdrawals were initially introduced.\n\nAs the number of active validators approaches the 589,000 mark, an internal protocol parameter, known as the Churn Limit, will rise, allowing for the daily activation of an extra 225 validators.\n\nHowever, even with this increased pace, individuals or staking pools spinning up new validators to join the queue today would still need just over a month to become active, Coin Metrics noted.\n\nLiquid staking tokens predicted to fuel staking value\n\nA budding narrative in the decentralized finance (DeFi) world underscores the escalating demand for Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs).\n\nThese tokens, representative of staked assets, bring a new level of liquidity to the traditionally illiquid PoS model by allowing staked assets to participate in DeFi applications while still contributing to the network\u2019s security.\n\nThey provide a bridge between staking and DeFi by offering liquid tokens that represent staked ETH, allowing holders to freely interact with DeFi protocols while still earning staking rewards.\n\nThe growing prominence of LSTs within DeFi is intricately linked to Ethereum\u2019s staking ecosystem. Behind every LST, there is a staking operation, providing the required security and validation for the Ethereum network.\n\nSome of the established decentralized players are jockeying for market share, such as Lido DAO (LDO), Frax (FXS) and Rocket Pool (RPL), alongside centralized staking providers such as Coinbase, and a slew of others, with new offerings cropping up regularly post-Shapella.\n\nIn essence, the explosion of LSTs within DeFi implies a parallel increase in Ethereum staking activity. As the role of LSTs becomes more integral to DeFi\u2019s future, it may inadvertently fuel the demand for ETH, Blockworks was previously told.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "Ethereum Co-founder Believes Such Projects Threaten Network\u2019s Neutrality\n\nBy: Owen Fernau \u2022 Loading...\n\nDeFi News\n\nVitalik Buterin, Ethereum\u2019s creator, is sounding the alarm about the potential of other blockchain projects using the chain\u2019s validators to resolve their own conflicts. The concern comes as re-staking emerges as a hot new trend.\n\nButerin said in a May 21 post on his website that while using staked ETH \u201cis fundamentally fine,\u201d attempting to influence Ethereum validators to take actions such as forking the Ethereum blockchain to favor a certain party, is not.\n\n\u201cWe should be wary of application-layer projects taking actions that risk increasing the \u2018scope\u2019 of blockchain consensus to anything other than verifying the core Ethereum protocol rules,\u201d Buterin wrote.\n\nButerin differentiated between using Ethereum\u2019s economic consensus and its social consensus. Economic consensus would come from making decisions purely based on the 18M ETH ($34 billion) worth of validators\u2019 stake, while social consensus means allowing off-chain events to influence validators\u2019 decisions.\n\nThe post uses a theoretical example of a currency price oracle for the Brazilian real that needs to decide on the correct price feed if the country were to split into two factions. In the case that validators are also split between the two camps, Ethereum cannot be expected to update its software, also known as implementing a hard fork, to kick one of the two validators off the network.\n\nWhile the example was set in 2034, there could be some near-term practical implications. Projects like Eigenlayer and Ether.fi are seeking to create a market for staked ETH to be reused to provide security to other projects. Buterin sees a real threat that those projects could become powerful enough to pressure the Ethereum community to make decisions which favor a certain group.\n\nThis runs counter to the core ethos of Ethereum as a \u201ccredibly neutral\u201d network which doesn\u2019t discriminate for or against any group of users.\n\nDan Elitzer, co-founder at Nascent, a crypto venture fund, said Buterin\u2019s concerns are legitimate.\n\n\u201cVitalik is right, there are ways that this can be done that are very safe, very reasonable,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd there are ways that this can be done that are a lot more risky.\u201d\n\nDeFi Alpha Premium Content DeFi Daily | Weekdays\n\nDeFi Alpha Letter | Weekly\n\nDefiant Podcast Transcript | Weekly\n\nInbox Dump | Saturday\n\nWeekly Recap | Sunday Looking for Alpha? Become a premium member of The Defiant and join our DeFi Alpha community. Start for free\n\nElitzer has been thinking about reusing yielding accruing tokens like Lido Finance\u2019s stETH, and DeFi tokens like those which represent deposits in lending protocols or automated market makers (AMMs), since 2019 when he wrote an article called \u201cSuperfluid Collateral in Open Finance.\u201d\n\nThe investor thinks the concerns about dependence on Ethereum\u2019s social consensus are very important, but not immediately pressing, nor entirely new.\n\n\u201cThe question is, not what will happen now, when this is kind of a new emergent dynamic in the ecosystem when we're in a relatively calm spot,\u201d he said.\n\nElitzer thinks that when the next bull market comes, and new users come pouring into crypto in search of yield, \u201cpeople tend to relax some of the social consensus things and just get a little wild as they try to grab market share.\u201d\n\nElitzer wrote as much in his 2019 article, which addressed the potentially adverse effects of rehypothocating tokens collateralized in DeFi protocols \u2014 \u201cgiven what we know of human nature, do you really think we\u2019ll show restraint when the possibility exists to earn an extra point of yield or pay a slightly lower rate on a loan?\u201d\n\nA similar dynamic is emerging with projects like Eigenlayer. Holders of liquid staking tokens like stETH, rETH, or an upstart competitor, could be incentivized to reuse their stake to bootstrap the security of another venture. Theoretically, this venture could also incentivize stakers with additional rewards, bringing them into a potentially socially contentious situation in exchange for increased yield.\n\nAn example of this would be a debate over the \u2018true\u2019 value of an Ethereum-secured price feed \u2014 if two parties have differing opinions about the value of a given asset, the Ethereum community could be roped into picking a side. And this is exactly the kind of social issue many of Ethereum\u2019s supporters hope the blockchain can remain neutral on.\n\nAnother example would be a Layer 2 scaling solution for the Ethereum blockchain depending on the Ethereum community to rescue it through a hard fork in case of a major hack. Again, this would involve judgement calls by the community, something that Ethereum wasn\u2019t designed to involve its validators in.\n\nElitzer thinks that Sreeram Kannan, the founder of the Eigenlayer, is similar to Buterin in that both take a measured approach to building blockchain-based products. Kannan released a response to Buterin\u2019s post on Twitter, where the Eigenlayer founder also discouraged depending on Ethereum to fork if an error happens in another application.\n\nElitzer added that for crypto enthusiasts in the industry for the long run, concerns like the ones Buterin raised are inevitable.\n\n\u201cIf Ethereum and other kinds of generalized blockchains become increasingly large economic and social and political forces in the world, this is just going to be more and more likely to come up in a very, very big way from more and more potential angles.\u201d"

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s Death Sentence: Fact or Fiction?\n\nCryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors alike have been buzzing with rumors that Ethereum, the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency, is on the verge of collapse.\n\nSome skeptics claim that the Ethereum network\u2019s high gas fees and scalability issues have rendered it obsolete, while others believe that Ethereum\u2019s future remains bright.\n\nIn this article, we\u2019ll look closer at Ethereum\u2019s current state and its potential for long-term growth.\n\nSource: Pixabay\n\nThe Controversy Surrounding Ethereum\u2019s Future\n\nEthereum has been a hot topic of discussion in the cryptocurrency community lately. The network\u2019s scalability issues have resulted in high gas fees, making it difficult for small investors to participate.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism has also been criticized for inefficiency. On the other hand, Ethereum\u2019s supporters argue that the network\u2019s transition to Proof of Stake (PoS) will address these issues and ensure its longevity.\n\nDuring the cryptocurrency frenzy, skeptics are raising eyebrows and questioning the future of Ethereum and Bitcoin.\n\nThe debate heats up with critics voicing concerns about their viability, potential manipulation, environmental impact, and outdated technology.\n\nDiscover the eight reasons why some experts believe these digital assets may become relics and explore the emerging alternatives that could reshape the investment landscape.\n\nUnderstanding Ethereum: Proof of Work vs. Proof of Stake\n\nEthereum\u2019s PoW algorithm requires miners to solve complex mathematical problems to validate transactions and create new blocks. This process consumes significant energy and has been criticized for contributing to climate change.\n\nEthereum 2.0, the network\u2019s upcoming upgrade, will transition to PoS, eliminating the need for miners and reducing energy consumption. PoS allows network participants to secure the network by staking their cryptocurrency, with rewards proportional to their stake.\n\nIs Ethereum dead?\n\nDespite the criticism surrounding Ethereum, the network remains the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. The Ethereum network\u2019s decentralization and its role as a platform for decentralized applications (dapps) have contributed to its popularity.\n\nHowever, Ethereum\u2019s high gas fees have made it difficult for small investors and dapp developers to use the network. The network\u2019s scalability issues have also resulted in slower transaction times, further hindering its adoption.\n\nWhat the Experts Say About Ethereum\u2019s Future\n\nSource: Business Today\n\nMany experts believe that Ethereum\u2019s future is bright, despite its current challenges.\n\nThe network\u2019s transition to PoS will improve its scalability and energy efficiency.\n\nAdditionally, Ethereum\u2019s role as a platform for dapps and decentralized finance (DeFi) has attracted significant investment and development. Some experts predict that Ethereum\u2019s market capitalization could exceed that of Bitcoin in the future.\n\nThe Relationship Between Bitcoin and Ethereum\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum are the two largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. While Bitcoin is primarily used as a store of value and a medium of exchange, Ethereum\u2019s platform enables the creation of decentralized applications and smart contracts.\n\nEthereum\u2019s supporters argue that its versatility and potential for innovation make it a more valuable asset than Bitcoin.\n\nHowever, Bitcoin\u2019s first-mover advantage and wider adoption have contributed to its dominance in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nEthereum vs. Competitors: Where Does Ethereum Stand?\n\nEthereum faces competition from other blockchain platforms, including Binance Smart Chain, Polkadot, and Cardano.\n\nWhile these platforms offer similar functionality to Ethereum, they have different approaches to scalability and consensus.\n\nBinance Smart Chain, for example, uses a delegated proof of stake (DPoS) consensus mechanism, while Cardano uses a proof of stake (PoS) mechanism. Ethereum\u2019s supporters argue that its established network effect and development community give it an advantage over its competitors.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Potential for long-term growth\n\nDespite its current challenges, Ethereum\u2019s potential for long-term growth remains strong. The network\u2019s transition to PoS is expected to improve its energy efficiency and scalability, making it more accessible to small investors and dapp developers.\n\nAdditionally, Ethereum\u2019s role as a platform for DeFi and NFTs (non-fungible tokens) has attracted significant investment and development. Some experts predict that Ethereum\u2019s market capitalization could exceed that of Bitcoin in the future.\n\nWill Ethereum recover in 2023? Examining the Possibilities\n\nPredicting the future of any cryptocurrency is challenging, and Ethereum is no exception.\n\nHowever, many experts believe that Ethereum\u2019s transition to PoS and the continued development of the network\u2019s infrastructure could lead to a significant recovery in the coming years.\n\nAdditionally, the growing adoption of DeFi and NFTs could drive demand for Ethereum and its associated tokens. While there are no guarantees in the cryptocurrency market, Ethereum\u2019s potential for growth remains strong.\n\nThe Role of Ethereum in the Crypto Market\n\nEthereum is pivotal in the cryptocurrency market, serving as a platform for decentralized applications and smart contracts. The network\u2019s versatility and potential for innovation have attracted significant investment and development, making it a valuable asset for investors.\n\nAdditionally, Ethereum\u2019s transition to PoS and its role in DeFi and NFTs could drive demand for the network\u2019s associated tokens, further increasing their value.\n\nConclusion: Is Ethereum Dead?\n\nIn conclusion, are Ethereum and Bitcoin dead? Not really.\n\nWhile Ethereum faces challenges, its potential for long-term growth remains strong. The network\u2019s transition to PoS and its role in developing DeFi and NFTs could significantly increase demand for Ethereum and its associated tokens.\n\nWhile there are no guarantees in the cryptocurrency market, Ethereum\u2019s established network effect and development community give it an advantage over its competitors.\n\nAs such, ETH\u2019s future remains bright despite the rumors of Ethereum being dead."

        "content": "As artificial intelligence (AI) technology is witnessing renewed worldwide and cross-industry interest sparked by the release of ChatGPT, the text-based AI platform has proven its worth in analyzing the cryptocurrency market to provide insights into the future price trends of assets such as Ethereum (ETH).\n\nIn this context, Finbold has asked ChatGPT to share its predictions on the potential trading range of Ethereum by the end of 2023, and after dutifully stating that it could not predict future prices, it has provided multiple factors that could affect ETH price by the year\u2019s end.\n\nFactors affecting ETH price\n\nSpecifically, as for some of these factors, ChatGPT has singled out the overall sentiment and perception of Ethereum within the crypto community and general market, arguing that \u201cpositive sentiment, increased adoption, and growing interest from investors may potentially drive the price higher.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, the AI chatbot explained that \u201cthe development and implementation of new features, upgrades, and improvements to the Ethereum network can impact its price,\u201d such as the Ethereum 2.0 update, as well as highlighted the influence of the flagship decentralized finance (DeFi) asset, Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nChatGPT on Bitcoin affecting Ethereum price. Source: ChatGPT\n\nOn top of that, ChatGPT said that Ethereum had \u201ca large and active community of developers, users, and supporters,\u201d the growth of which, along with the continued development of decentralized applications (dApps) on the platform, could also positively impact the price.\n\nAccording to the AI language model, other influential factors include regulatory changes and government policies related to cryptocurrencies, economic conditions and geopolitical events, as well as social media platforms, news articles, and influential figures within the crypto space.\n\nAI ETH price prediction\n\nMeanwhile, the crypto price prediction platform CoinPriceForecast has been able to deliver specific figures on the possible price of Ethereum for the coming years, including by the end of 2023, with the current projection standing at $2,142, which would represent an increase of 15% to the price of the digital asset as of May 23.\n\nEthereum 2023 price projection. Source: CoinPriceForecast\n\nInterestingly, the latest year-end numbers are close to the earlier long-term forecast from February 2023, when the same platform placed the price of Ethereum at $2,146 by the end of 2023, although the mid-year figures were a lot more bullish, as Finbold reported on February 23.\n\nMore recently, in April, a poll of 32 fintech and crypto experts projected that the price of Ethereum could reach its peak in 2023 at around $2,758. However, after that, they expect the price to start dropping again in the second half of 2023, sinking to the still bullish $2,342 by the end of the year.\n\nEthereum price analysis\n\nAs things stand, Ethereum is currently trading hands at the price of $1,856, recording an increase of 2.18% in the last 24 hours and a 2.13% gain over the previous seven days, as it moves to reverse the 0.84% decline on its monthly chart. Since the year\u2019s start, ETH has grown 54.56%.\n\nEthereum year-to-date (YTD) price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nWhether Ethereum truly manages to push toward the projected price by the end of 2023 will, indeed, depend on the factors enumerated by ChatGPT, particularly the positive sentiment that could be driven by developments such as record-breaking staking returns after the recent \u2018Shapella\u2019 upgrade.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

He got bored of that idea and started a food delivery business, which he says \u201cwas a great and horrific experience.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis was before Uber Eats and before the whole food delivery craze started. It was an exciting business.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty convinced I would be divorced today and probably have no children if I had stayed in food delivery,\u201d he jokes.\n\nSeeking new challenges, DeFi Dad transitioned to software startups and then unexpectedly found himself selling \u201call sorts of camera equipment\u201d in a camera shop.\n\n\u201cI definitely have a lot of experience hopping different industries, which is probably why I ended up in crypto at one point in my life.\u201d\n\nIt was during yet another role as a project manager at an events company in New York, where he was assigned to blockchain events, that DD discovered his passion for crypto, and he hasn\u2019t looked back since.\n\nWho knows? In five years\u2019 time, we might catch up with him only to find out he has become an astronaut.\n\nWhat led to Twitter fame?\n\nDeFi Dad exudes the vibe of a hustler determined to ensure his kids have a full plate every night.\n\n\u201cNo doubt it\u2019s the typical combination of a lot of focus, really hard work, grinding it out and being present across as many different parts of Crypto Twitter at the same time,\u201d he explains.\n\nHis early DeFi videos began amassing over 10,000 views during the first surge of interest in the topic in the lead-up to \u201cDeFi Summer\u201d in 2020.\n\n\u201cI was very lucky with the timing that I was into DeFi in, like mid-early 2019, and obviously, it took off within a year\u2019s time.

I\u2019m more of a long-term investor, but I\u2019m super happy for folks making money off it,\u201d he says.\n\nEvery now and then, you might be lucky enough to catch DD throwing out a cheeky price prediction.\n\nI think ARB goes to near $5-$10\n\n\n\nMid take: But that would put FDV at $100B! And that's absurd if you compare it to Optimism, Polygon, and others.\n\n\n\nI think the ARB price could shock people. \u2014 DeFi Dad \u27e0 defidad.eth \ud83e\udd87\ud83d\udd0a\ud83d\udc3c (@DeFi_Dad) March 21, 2023\n\nWhat do you enjoy on Crypto Twitter?\n\nDD is an unashamed fanboy of Guy Turner, the founder and face of Coin Bureau, whose ethics he admires.\n\n\u201cHe has a team that acts with a lot of integrity, at least in my experience, and they are such great storytellers,\u201d he says.\n\nDD admits he is \u201cdefinitely trying to emulate\u201d what Guy is doing by being very objective and creating content that is \u201cgoing to onboard as many folks in the space as possible.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is a really fine line to ensuring that you don\u2019t compromise on your ethics and become something of a shill.\u201d\n\nTwitter Beef\n\nDD proudly states that he holds no grudges against anyone and jokes that his lack of Crypto Twitter beefs is \u201cnot going to be good for engagement on this article.\u201d\n\nHowever, he doesn\u2019t shy away from throwing some shade every now and then.

        "content": "Ethereum has remained a revered name in the digital asset sector and a widely used blockchain network. As the growth of the market continues and people gravitate toward the development, we break down some commonly asked questions related to these programs. Now, let\u2019s delve into whether or not Ethereum addresses are case-sensitive.\n\nThere are few networks as adopted as Ethereum, and as such, addresses Subsequently, ensuring that you have the correct address is a vital part of transferring digital assets. Thus, knowing the case sensitivity of the addresses is a crucial aspect of it.\n\nEthereum Addresses\n\nSource: Redot.com\n\nNow, before we delve into case sensitivity, let\u2019s understand these indicators a little more. An ETH address is kind of like your own ID on the blockchain. Moreover, this identifiable marker is how you are differentiated from every other entity operating within the network. Additionally, it allows the program to identify if the address is related to a wallet address, a smart contract, or a transaction.\n\nA wallet address is your own public account that holds your digital assets. Moreover, this is only accessible with private keys. Alternatively, your Ethereum address is derived from the last 20 bytes of the public key that controls that specific account.\n\nSpecifically, Ethereum addresses are indicated by a 42-character string of hexadecimal (HEX) figures. These can be both letters and numbers, and all represent sixteen values per individual character.\n\nThe address uses 0\u20139 to represent their sum value while using a\u2013f to indicate the numbers 10\u201316. Moreover, these addresses typically start with 0x, which shows that the subsequent string is HEX.\n\nThese values are vital to get correct when inputting them into the Ethereum network. Moreover, sending ETH to a specific wallet relies on the correct input of the specific HEX string to maintain the correct address. Yet, does that mean that the letters of the string are case-sensitive?\n\nCase Sensitivity\n\nSource: Tech Republic\n\nEthereum addresses are not case-sensitive. Moreover, the string figures that represent the ETH address will only rely on the correct delineation of characters. Thus, the Ethereum network will not ensure that some figures are captured because it cannot differentiate between the two.\n\nIf you are sending ETH to an address that begins \u201c0xJFJ754\u2026\u201d The system will not alter the destination if that is articulated as \u201c0xjfj754\u201d because the network identifies them as the same. Conversely, although the address in capital or lowercase letters is the same, there are addresses with potentially one character difference. Subsequently, to prevent withdrawals to a misspelled address, a checksum is displayed.\n\nMoreover, if you observe an Ethereum address with different case letters, it is an optional checksum. This cryptographic feature ensures that individual assets are being transferred to the correct addresses, as transfers to the wrong address are irreversible.\n\nConversely, although your Ethereum address is not case-sensitive, it is important to understand what funds you can or cannot receive on your network. Consequently, the Ethereum network can only support specific funds. Thus, it\u2019s vital to know which those are and transfer them accordingly.\n\nConclusion\n\nLike most other networks, Ethereum addresses are not case-sensitive. However, there may be some letters capitalized in a specific address that represents a checksum. Ultimately, this is a way of ensuring that the address is valid and the transferred funds are arriving at the intended location."

But it\u2019s also expected to become useful in other contexts, thanks to bleeding edge tech, such as the restaking primitive from Eigenlayer, which will allow staked ETH to serve a dual function.\n\nIn his first blog post about Ethereum since March, Buterin extended the credible neutrality imperative to any attempt to leverage the Ethereum validator set \u2014 including, but not limited to restaking \u2014 warning against efforts to \u201crecruit Ethereum social consensus for [an] application\u2019s own purposes.\u201d\n\nIn the form of a cautionary thought experiment using Harry Potter characters, Buterin outlined certain risks that could arise if proposals to rehypothecate staked ether are not carefully thought through.\n\nRe-using validators\u2019 stake can be done safely, he argues, so long as the social consensus isn\u2019t relied upon as a backstop.\n\n\u201cIf [\u2026] you have the intent to rope in the broader Ethereum ecosystem social consensus to fork or reorg to solve your problems, this is high-risk, and I argue that we should strongly resist all attempts to create such expectations,\u201d Buterin wrote.\n\nAs an example of a \u201chigh-risk\u201d gamble, Buterin pictured a layer-2 created by \u201cHermione\u201d that grows to become the dominant scaling solution. The fictional Ethereum wizard claims that her layer-2 is thus the most secure, \u201cbecause if there is a bug that causes funds to be stolen, the losses will be so large that the community will have no choice but to fork to recover the users\u2019 funds.\u201d\n\nArbitrum One currently has $5.77 billion in total value locked (TVL) according to L2Beat, more than triple the size of the next largest scaling solution, Optimism.\n\nRight now, there is no indication that a catastrophic bug in Arbitrum would prompt calls for Ethereum mainnet operators to take action. But since Arbitrum\u2019s developer, Offchain Labs, also owns Prysmatic Labs \u2014 the company behind the second-largest Prysm consensus client \u2014 it\u2019s not an absurd proposition, either.\n\nButerin doesn\u2019t want a repeat of The Dao, or the Parity bug, both of which challenged Ethereum\u2019s social consensus at a time when the network was much smaller.\n\nIn the former case, the network forked, leaving behind Ethereum Classic (ETC), which continues to operate at a $2.5 billion market cap to this day. In the latter, the network did not fork, and 513,774 ether were locked forever. That was a painful choice, but it set a precedent for the future: Ethereum transactions are immutable, what Buterin refers to in his post as the blockchain\u2019s \u201cpurity.\u201d\n\n\u201cA blockchain\u2019s \u2018purity\u2019 in the sense of it being a purely mathematical construct that attempts to come to consensus only on purely mathematical things, is a huge advantage,\u201d he wrote.\n\nHe urged avoidance of \u201cperverse too-big-to-fail mechanics,\u201d to \u201cpreserve the chain\u2019s minimalism, support uses of re-staking that do not look like slippery slopes to extending the role of Ethereum consensus, and help developers find alternate strategies to achieve their security goals.\u201d\n\nEigenlayer co-founder Sreeram Kannan, was quick to agree, in a Twitter thread:\n\n\u201ca) don\u2019t build complex financial primitives on restaking \u2014 they can spiral out\n\nb) don\u2019t rely on Ethereum to fork for application layer errors \u2014 this is a super important principle\n\nc) do not use subjective slashing \u2014 as it is subject to tyranny of the dishonest majority.\u201d\n\nThere are \u201cthree underlying trust models underpinning Eigenlayer,\u201d according to Kannan. These are economic trust, decentralization trust and ETH validator commitments, and each with their own potential use cases.\n\nBut it remains to be seen which, if any, will be embraced by Ethereum validators.\n\nBlockworks Research analyst Ren Yu Kong is skeptical that there will be a wide variety of restaking applications that will pass muster with Ethereum validators.\n\n\u201cI believe that there won\u2019t be many projects out there that are worth a validator to restake with given the additional risks incurred for a small marginal return, and now Vitalik has highlighted an important additional \u2018social consensus\u2019 risk,\u201d he said.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

A decentralized application is called a Dapp (also spelled DAPP, dApp or DApp) for short. Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs): Ethereum allows you to create these for democratic decision-making.\n\nThese are the most important features of Ethereum and before going deep into the Ethereum tutorial, let\u2019s discuss each of these features in more detail.\n\nEther\n\nEther (ETH) is Ethereum\u2019s cryptocurrency. Basically it is the fuel that runs the network. It is used to pay for the computational resources and the transaction fees for any transaction executed on the Ethereum network. Like Bitcoins, ether is a peer-to-peer currency. Apart from being used to pay for transactions, ether is also used to buy gas, which is used to pay for the computation of any transaction made on the Ethereum network.\n\nAlso, if you want to deploy a contract on Ethereum, you will need gas, and you would have to pay for that gas in ether. So gas is the execution fee paid by a user for running a transaction in Ethereum. Ether can be utilized for building decentralized applications, building smart contracts and making standard peer-to-peer payments.\n\nSmart Contracts\n\nSmart contracts are revolutionizing the way how traditional contracts worked, which is why it is important for you to know about them in this Ethereum tutorial. A smart contract is a simple computer program that facilitates the exchange of any valuable asset between two parties. It could be money, shares, property or any other digital asset that you want to exchange. These contracts can be created by anyone on the Ethereum network. The contract consists primarily of the terms and conditions mutually agreed on between the parties (peers).\n\nThe primary feature of a smart contract is that once it is executed, it cannot be altered, and any transaction done on top of a smart contract is registered permanently\u2014it is immutable. So even if you modify the smart contract in the future, the transactions correlated with the original contract will not get altered; you cannot modify them.\n\nThe verification process for the smart contracts is carried out by anonymous parties of the network without the need for a centralized authority, and that\u2019s what makes any smart contract execution on Ethereum a decentralized execution.\n\nThe transfer of any asset or currency is done in a transparent and trustworthy manner, and the identities of the two entities are secure on the Ethereum network. Once the transaction is successfully done, the accounts of the sender and receiver are updated accordingly, and in this way it generates a trust between the parties.\n\nSmart Contracts vs. Traditional Contract Systems\n\nIn traditional contract systems, you sign an agreement, then you trust and hire a third party for its execution. The problem is that in this type of process, data tampering is possible. With smart contracts, the agreement is coded in a program. The result is not verified by a centralized authority; it is verified by the participants on the Ethereum blockchain-based network. Once a contract is executed, the transaction is registered and cannot be altered or tampered, so it removes the risk of any data manipulation or alteration.\n\nLet\u2019s take an example in which someone named Zack has given a contract of $500 to someone named Elsa for developing his company\u2019s website. The developers code the agreement of the smart contract using Ethereum\u2019s programming language. The smart contract has all the conditions (requirements) for building the website. Once the code is written, it is uploaded and deployed on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).\n\nEVM is a runtime compiler to execute a smart contract. Once the code is deployed on the EVM, every participant on the network has a copy of the contract. When Elsa submits the work on Ethereum for evaluation, each node on the Ethereum network will evaluate and confirm whether the result given by Elsa has been done as per the coding requirements, and once the result is approved and verified, the contract worth $500 will be self-executed and the payment will be paid to Elsa in ether. Zack\u2019s account will be automatically debited, and Elsa will be credited with $500 in ether.\n\nThe Ethereum tutorial video includes a demo on the deployment of a Ethereum smart contract.\n\nEthereum Virtual Machine\n\nEVM, as mentioned above in this Ethereum tutorial, is designed to operate as a runtime environment for compiling and deploying Ethereum-based smart contracts. Basically, EVM is the engine that understands the language of smart contracts, which are written in the Solidity language for Ethereum. EVM is operated in a sandbox environment\u2014basically, you can deploy your own stand-alone environment, which can act as a testing and development environment, and you can test your smart contract (deploy it) \u201cn\u201d number of times, verify it, and then once you are satisfied with the performance and the functionality of the smart contract, you can deploy it on the Ethereum main network.\n\nAny programming language in the smart contract is compiled into the bytecode, which the EVM understands. This bytecode can be read and executed using the EVM. One of the most popular languages for writing a smart contract is Solidity. Once you write your smart contract in Solidity, that contract gets converted into the bytecode and gets deployed on the EVM. And thereby EVM guarantees security from cyberattacks.\n\nHow Does EVM Work?\n\nSuppose person A wants to pay person B 10 ethers. The transaction will be sent to the EVM using a smart contract for a fund transfer from A to B. In order to validate the transaction, the Ethereum network will perform the proof-of-work consensus algorithm.\n\nThe miner nodes on Ethereum will validate this transaction\u2014whether the identity of A exists or not, and if A has the requested amount to transfer. Once the transaction is validated, the ether will be debited from A\u2019s wallet and will be credited to B\u2019s wallet, and during this process, the miners will charge a fee to validate this transaction and will earn a reward.\n\nAll the nodes on the Ethereum network execute smart contracts using their respective EVMs.\n\nProof of Work\n\nEvery node in the Ethereum network has:\n\nThe entire history of all the transactions\u2014the entire chain\n\nThe history of the smart contract, which is basically the address at which the smart contract is deployed, along with the transactions associated with the smart contract\n\nThe handle to the current state of the smart contract\n\nThe goal of the miners on the Ethereum network is to validate the blocks. For each block of transaction, miners use their computational power and resources to get the appropriate hash value by varying the nonce. The miners will vary the nonce and pass it through a hashing algorithm\u2014in Ethereum, it is the Ethash algorithm.\n\nThis produces a hash value that should be less than the predefined target as per the proof-of-work consensus. If the hash value generated is less than the target value, then the block is considered to be verified and the miner gets rewarded.\n\nWhen the proof of work is solved, the result is broadcast and shared with all the other nodes in order to update their ledger. If other nodes accept the hashed block as valid, then the block gets added to the Ethereum main blockchain, and as a result the miner receives a reward, which as of today stands at 3 ethers. Plus the miner receives the transaction fees that have been generated for verifying the block. All the transactions that are aggregated in the block\u2014the cumulative transaction fees associated with all the transactions\u2014are also given as a reward to the miner.\n\nProof of Stake\n\nIn Ethereum, a process called proof of stake is also under development. It is an alternative to proof of work, and is meant to be a solution to minimize the use of expensive resources spent for mining using proof of work. In proof of stake, the miner\u2014who is actually the validator\u2014can validate the transactions based on the amount of cryptocoins he or she holds before actually starting the mining. So based on the accumulation of cryptocoins the miner has beforehand, he or she has a higher probability of mining the block. However, proof of stake is not widely used as of now compared to proof of work.\n\nGas\n\nJust like we need fuel to run a car, we need gas to run applications on the Ethereum network. To perform any transaction within the Ethereum network, a user has to make a payment\u2014shell out ethers\u2014in order to get a transaction done, and the intermediary monetary value is called gas. On the Ethereum network, gas is a unit that measures the computational power required to run a smart contract or a transaction. So if you have to do a transaction that updates the blockchain, you would have to shell out gas, and that gas costs ethers.\n\nIn Ethereum, the transaction fees are calculated using a formula (see screenshot below). For every transaction, there is gas and its correlated gas price. The amount of gas required to execute a transaction multiplied by the gas price equals the transaction fees. \u201cGas limit\u201d refers to the amount of gas used for the computation and the amount of ether a user is required to pay for the gas.\n\nBelow is a screenshot from the Ethereum network showing the transaction cost. You can see for this particular transaction, the gas limit was 21,000, the gas used by the transaction was 21,000, and the gas price was 21 Gwei, which is the lowest denomination of ether. So 21 Gwei * 21,000 gave the actual transaction fees: 0.000441 ethers, or about 21 cents as of today. As mentioned, the transaction fee goes to the miner who has validated the transaction.\n\nTo understand the gas limit and the gas price, let\u2019s consider an example using a car. Suppose your car has a mileage of 10 kilometers per liter and the price of petrol is $1 per liter. Then driving a car for 50 kilometers would cost you five liters of petrol, which is worth $5. Similarly, to perform an operation or to run code on Ethereum, you need to obtain a certain amount of gas, like the petrol, and the gas has a per-unit price, called gas price.\n\nIf the user provides less than the amount of gas to run a particular operation, then the process will fail and the user will be given the message \u201cout of gas.\u201d And Gwei, as noted above, is the lowest denomination of ether used for measuring a unit of a gas price.\n\nEthereum Mining vs. Bitcoin Mining\n\nThe hashing algorithm is the primary difference between Ethereum mining and Bitcoin mining.\n\nBitcoin uses SHA-256, and Ethereum uses Ethash. The average time taken on Bitcoin for mining a block is 10 minutes, whereas on Ethereum it is 12 to 15 seconds. As of today, the mining reward for Bitcoin is 12.5 bitcoins; for Ethereum it\u2019s 3 ethers plus the transaction fee\u2014the cumulative transaction fees of all the transactions of a block. As of April 10, 2019, the value of 1 bitcoin is $5249.03, whereas 1 ether is $180.89.\n\nHow is Ethereum mining different from Bitcoin mining?\n\nBitcoin Ethereum Hashing Algorithm SHA-256 Ethash Time taken to mine a block An average of 10 minutes An average of 12-15 seconds Reward 12.5 BTC 3 ETH USD - 04/10/2019 1 Bitcoin = 5249.03 1 Ether = 180.89\n\nBelow is a screenshot of an Ethereum reward that has been given to the miner of the block. As you can see, the reward is 3 ethers plus the total accumulated transaction fees of all the underlying transactions in this block, which are 0.0666 ethers.\n\nDecentralized Applications (Dapps)\n\nLet\u2019s compare decentralized applications with traditional applications. When you log in to Twitter, for example, a web application gets displayed that is rendered using HTML. The page will call an API to access your personal data (your information), which is centrally hosted. It\u2019s a simple process: your front end executes the backend API, and the API goes and fetches your information from a centralized database.\n\nIf we transform this application into a decentralized application, when you log in, the same web application gets rendered, but it calls a smart contract-based API to fetch the information from the blockchain network. So the API is replaced by a smart contract interface, and the smart contract will fetch the information from the blockchain network, which is its backend.\n\nThat blockchain network is not a centralized database; it\u2019s a decentralized network in which the participants of the network (the miners) validate (verify) all the transactions that are happening using the smart contract on the blockchain network. So any transaction or action happening on a Twitter-type application that has now been transformed will be a decentralized transaction.\n\nA Dapp consists of backing code that runs on a distributed peer-to-peer network. It is a software designed to work in the Ethereum network without being controlled by a centralized system, as mentioned, and that is the primary difference: it provides direct interaction between the end users and the decentralized application providers.\n\nAn application qualifies as a Dapp when it is open-source (its code is on Github) and it uses a public blockchain-based token in order to run its applications. A token acts as fuel for the decentralized application to run. Dapp allows the backend code and data to be decentralized, and that is the primary architecture of any Dapp.\n\nEquip yourself with the structure and mechanism of Ethereum and Hyperledger with the Blockchain Certification Training! Enroll now!\n\nDecentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)\n\nA DAO is a digital organization that operates without a hierarchical management; it operates in a decentralized and democratic fashion. So basically a DAO is an organization in which the decision-making is not in the hands of a centralized authority but rather in the hands of certain designated authorities or a group or designated people as a part of an authority. It exists on a blockchain network, where it is governed by the protocols embedded in a smart contract, and thereby, DAOs rely on smart contracts for decision-making\u2014or, we can say, decentralized voting systems\u2014within the organization. So before any organizational decision can be made, it has to go through the voting system, which runs on a decentralized application.\n\nHere\u2019s how it works. People add funds through the DAO, because the DAO requires funding in order to execute and make decisions. Based on that, each member is given a token that represents that person\u2019s percentage of shares in the DAO. Those tokens are used to vote in the DAO, and the proposal status is decided based on the maximum votes. Every decision within the organization has to go through this voting process."

Source: YouTube\n\nThe ongoing confusion over Ether\u2019s legal status stems in large part from conflicting statements from the CFTC and the SEC. Over the course of the last six months, the CFTC has repeatedly called Ether, along with a number of other cryptocurrencies, a commodity.\n\nMeanwhile, the Gary Gensler-led SEC hasn\u2019t explicitly provided Ether with a designated legal category. Gensler said at an oversight hearing in April that everything but Bitcoin (BTC) should be deemed a security and has refused to further elaborate.\n\nWhile the claim that Ether could be simultaneously a security and commodity may strike many as a contradiction, Berkovitz said that due to the overlapping legal definitions of commodities and securities it\u2019s possible for an asset to be classified as both.\n\n\u201cThe law is clear. Something can actually be both a commodity and a security.\u201d\n\nBerkovitz explained the confusion arises because commodities aren\u2019t purely physical items like \u201cwheat\u201d or \u201coats\u201d and that anything that falls under the purview of a \u201cfutures contract\u201d can technically be defined as a commodity. This explains why the term \u201cfutures\u201d is a part of the name of the CFTC itself.\n\nAlternatively, Berkovtiz said that a security, which is defined by the Securities Act and the Exchange Act \u2014 and includes things like notes and investment contracts \u2014 can also be the subject of a futures contract, which then places it under the purview of the CFTC as well.\n\nThe CFTC\u2019s main regulatory purview captures the regulation of futures and swaps on commodities, while the SEC solely regulates securities. However, if something is a commodity in the eyes of the CFTC as well as a security under the SEC\u2019s definition, it\u2019s entirely possible for both regulatory bodies to have jurisdiction over it.\n\nOn the podcast, Collin Lloyd, a partner at multinational law firm Sullivan & Cromwell, took aim at the SEC\u2019s claim that everything excluding Bitcoin should be designated a \u201csecurity\u201d status under federal ecurities law.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see anything in the case law that tells me that some string of digits that operates on a blockchain can natively just be a security,\u201d said Lloyd.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of a weird question to be asking, \u2018Is this digital asset a security or not?\u2019 I think you should be asking, \u2018Is this digital asset being sold as part of a securities transaction?\u2019 That depends on the facts and circumstances.\u201d\n\nNotably, Sullivan & Cromwell is currently working on the FTX bankruptcy case and was hired by Coinbase on April 29 to aid the crypto exchange in its battle over opaque regulation with the SEC.\n\nMagazine: \u2018Moral responsibility\u2019 \u2014 Can blockchain really improve trust in AI?"

        "content": "Lurking in what is sometimes referred to as the \u201cDark Forest,\u201d programmed predators seize value from unknowing victims as they attempt to perform blockchain transactions.\n\nThe concept of a \u201cDark Forest\u201d originates from a novel written by Cixin Liu, describing a setting in which the discovery of someone\u2019s location portends their inevitable doom at the hands of sophisticated predators. It is often compared to Ethereum\u2019s hostile and murky block-building environment.\n\nHunting for victims in Ethereum\u2019s public mempool, automated searchers prey on transaction orders as they are discovered in a practice called MEV, extracting value from their targets\u2019 activities through frontruns and sandwich attacks.\n\nIn an interview with Blockworks on a recent Bell Curve podcast, Hasu, strategy lead at Flashbots, spoke with host Mike Ippolito about the necessity of building privacy mechanisms to protect users from MEV exploits.\n\nThe quest for privacy\n\n\u201cI would say there are three different camps in crypto, when it comes to privacy, that have very different motivations,\u201d Hasu says. First on his list is the \u201cideologically-driven crowd,\u201d motivated primarily by the principle of privacy as a human right.\n\nSecondly, Hasu says, a more \u201cacademic camp\u201d of curious, privacy-focused crypto researchers study zero knowledge, cryptography, and trusted execution environments in their quest for improving privacy.\n\n\u201cThey are in it,\u201d he says, \u201cfor the intellectual challenge.\u201d\n\nThe third camp consists of mechanism and market structure designers, Hasu explains, who strive for privacy to build \u201ccredible mechanisms that work.\u201d As strategy lead at Flashbots, Hasu identifies himself as one such builder.\n\nPrivacy, Hasu says, is \u201cextremely important when you want to build a good market structure.\u201d This is especially the case in the MEV supply chain, he says. \u201cPrivacy is very important because there\u2019s a lot of informational value in the bids.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust seeing the intent of a person, what they want to do,\u201d he says, gives the searcher \u201ca financial edge because you can frontrun them\u201d and \u201cdo harm to them.\u201d\n\nHasu believes that privacy is also crucial for successful collaboration in the building process. \u201cWe want validation and block production to be decentralized.\u201d\n\nCentralized actors who could monopolize the MEV supply chain would wield extraordinary power, he says. Instead, he advocates for a broader distribution of smaller searchers and block builders to collaborate in the block-building process.\n\n\u201cThis collaboration doesn\u2019t work without strong privacy because you always have to be very aware that others can steal your bundles and steal money from you.\u201d\n\n\u201cPrivacy is of fundamental importance for the MEV supply chain,\u201d Hasu says, noting, \u201cWe couldn\u2019t achieve our goals\u201d without solving \u201cthe privacy puzzle.\u201d\n\nMEV-Share\n\nIppolito mentions the privacy innovations of Flashbots\u2019 MEV-Share tool as an example, which enables users to \u201cdirectly control which parts of their transaction they wish to share with searchers.\u201d\n\nHasu explains that with MEV-Share, searchers are limited in their ability to see information about user orders, protecting the transactions from MEV exploitation.\n\n\u201cWe reveal some amount of information, not enough to frontrun, but just enough to constrain the search space, so that searchers are not completely blind.\u201d\n\nThe block builders in this system, Hasu explains, are in charge of \u201crunning this simulation and matching the orders.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor searchers, it\u2019s a completely new paradigm,\u201d he says. \u201cSearching on private data is not what they\u2019re used to, but we think it yields fundamentally better outcomes for users.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "Trading volumes and investor deposits on zero-knowledge blockchains have soared over the past week.\n\nBut some attribute the increased activity to users attempting to game potential token airdrops.\n\nDeFi users are flocking to Ethereum-based blockchains that use \u201czero-knowledge proofs.\u201d Their likely motive? The possibility of striking gold with lucrative airdrops worth thousands of dollars, all by being early adopters of these cutting-edge chains.\n\nData from DefiLlama shows that activity on these buzzy blockchains \u2014 zkSync Era, Starknet, and Polygon zkEVM \u2014spiked considerably over the past week.\n\nZero-knowledge proofs are a cryptographic technique gaining popularity in the crypto industry. They allow blockchains to process information while maintaining privacy and security by not revealing the actual data.\n\nNOW READ: \u2018Not over yet\u2019: Tornado Cash attack rages on with $1m in jeopardy\n\nStay ahead of the game with our weekly newsletters Subscribe\n\nOver the past year, blockchain projects Optimism and Arbitrum \u2014 which do not use zero-knowledge proofs \u2014 both airdropped tokens to early and frequent users. As a result, speculation has soared regarding the potential for upcoming projects to follow suit and unleash a similar flurry of rewards for those who get in early.\n\nNumbers go up\n\nThe prevailing speculation has led to a substantial increase in investor deposits and attracted a growing number of traders.\n\nDecentralised exchanges on ZkSync Era, currently the biggest zero-knowledge blockchain with over $120 million deposited onto it, have registered an 88% increase in trading volume over the past week. Earlier this month, however, developers of one of the chain\u2019s five decentralised exchanges \u201cpulled the rug\u201d on investors by stealing over $1.8 million worth of deposits.\n\nSyncSwap is the largest decentralised exchange on zkSync Era by total value locked, a metric for investor deposits in DeFi\n\nStarknet, another zero-knowledge chain, was not far behind, with a 48% increase in trading volume on its decentralised exchanges. But the biggest growth happened on Polygon zkEVM, a relatively new chain, which launched on March 27. The trading volume on its decentralised exchanges is up 230% this week.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nIn addition to the increase in trading volume, more DeFi users are moving their assets over to these new chains.\n\nThe total value locked, a measure of the assets deposited in a blockchain network\u2019s DeFi protocols, increased 16% on Starknet this week, while zkSync Era is up 13%. But as with exchange volumes, Polygon zkEVM is the standout winner with a 219% boost to its total value locked.\n\nJediSwap is the largest decentralised exchange on Starknet by total value locked, a metric for investor deposits in DeFi\n\nAirdrop farming\n\nMany in the DeFi community have pointed out that the primary driver behind the heightened activity on zero-knowledge-based blockchains may be attributed to the practice known as \u201cairdrop farming,\u201d where users create multiple wallets and engage in small transactions to register activity, all in the anticipation of securing valuable token airdrops as a future reward.\n\nNOW READ: MakerDAO members set to approve controversial \u2018whistleblower bounty\u2019 to enforce anonymity\n\n\u201cAirdrop and token speculation is always something protocols and application development teams have to be aware of,\u201d Anthony Rose, senior vice president of technology at Matter Labs, the company behind the zkSync Era blockchain, told DL News.\n\nRecent hints have also helped reignite speculation. In a May 10 tweet, Polygon co-founder Sandeep Nailwal, winked at the possibility of a token airdrop for early users of Polygon zkEVM.\n\nSer I think its more an insight on impact of airdrop anticipation on adoption than anything related to zk.\n\nI guess you overlooked another prominent zkL2 which has 250mn tvl cuz of the airdrop expectation.\n\n\n\nAlso good things take time. Remember Arbitrum one took 1 year+ to fully\u2026 \u2014 Sandeep Nailwal | sandeep. polygon \ud83d\udc9c (@sandeepnailwal) May 10, 2023\n\nSince then Twitter has been a buzz with talk of farming the possible airdrop, which may help account for the network\u2019s dramatic uptick in usage.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just Polygon zkEVM that\u2019s become a target for airdrop farmers. There are also dozens of recent Twitter threads dedicated to gaming potential token airdrops on zkSync and Starknet, too.\n\nBut Rose isn\u2019t concerned about a potential influx of inorganic activity from airdrop farmers. \u201cAs much traffic as we see today, it isn\u2019t even a rounding error on what we will see on the system if we are successful,\u201d he said.\n\nTricky measurement\n\nBut some say DeFi\u2019s conventional metrics may not do justice to reality.\n\nUri Kolodny, co-founder and CEO of Starkware, the company behind Starknet, said he was sceptical about metrics like exchange trading volume and total value locked, which can become artificially inflated due to airdrop farmers.\n\n\u201cI think that total value locked is, in a way, open to misinterpretation,\u201d Kolodny told DL News in an interview. Instead, Kolodny said, he prefers metrics that highlight developer activity \u2014 such as Electric Capital\u2019s Developer Report platform \u2014 as a better gauge of how well a blockchain is doing.\n\nAccording to the Developer Report, as of April 1, Starknet had 6,784 monthly commits \u2014 developer-speak for changes and updates to code. In comparison, zkSync registered 2,533. Although Starknet has more monthly commits, zkSync has approximately 20% more commits overall.\n\nBut they all have increasingly more airdrop farmers."

With approximately 18 million ETH, equivalent to around $34 billion, held by validators, blocks are successfully finalized every 6.4 minutes.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s ETH market cap in BTC\u2019s terms\n\nShould Ethereum\u2019s technology be multipurpose?\n\nDue to the robustness of this technology, many have suggested alternative uses of Ethereum\u2019s blockchain.\n\nVarious ideas have surfaced over time to leverage the Ethereum validator set and social consensus for different purposes. One such idea is the ultimate oracle, where users can vote on facts using ETH.\n\nRe-staking is another concept employed by protocols like EigenLayer, allowing Ethereum stakers to use their stake as a deposit in another protocol, potentially facing penalties for misbehavior.\n\nAdditionally, the notion of L1-driven recovery of L2 projects suggests forking the Ethereum blockchain to address bugs or failures in Layer 2 solutions was also suggested.\n\nVitalik Buterin, in a recent post, has stated how the reuse of validators for different purposes like the ones mentioned above may compromise the security of the Ethereum network.\n\nCriticisms ahead\n\nAccording to Vitalik, allowing Ethereum stakers to simultaneously use their stake as a deposit in another protocol, creates a scenario where stakers can be challenged or penalized for violating the rules of the other protocol.\n\nThis introduces a potential avenue for manipulation or exploitation of the staking mechanism, which could undermine the security and integrity of the Ethereum network.\n\nIs your portfolio green?

At press time alone, the gains stood at 2.2% on a daily basis, with Bitcoin [BTC] comfortably back at $27k.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check ETH Profit Calculator\n\nIn a recent development, Vitalik echoed concern about pushing Ethereum on a multi-purpose path. Although the price didn\u2019t react to his concerns, here is the state of ETH\u2019s short-term prospects.\n\nThe rally eased at the short-term range high\n\nSince 8 May, ETH has been oscillating between $1740 \u2013 $1873. At press time, it retested the range of $1873 but left behind an FVG (fair value gap) of $1825 \u2013 $1846 (white).\n\nThe FVG could hold further drop, giving bulls a chance to retest or smash the range high. A bullish breakout could set ETH to reclaim the $1900 and $2000 psychological levels.\n\nHowever, a drop below the FVG zone could ease at the mid-range of $1807. A session close below the mid-range could tip sellers to drag ETH to $1784 or range low of $1740.\n\nMeanwhile, the RSI value was 67, highlighting an increased buying pressure in the past few hours. Similarly, the OBV increased confirming improved ETH volume and demand.\n\nLongs discouraged\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nAs per Coinglass, longs suffered more liquidations at press time, with about $300k worth of positions wrecked. The trend could undermine a strong retest of the range high as the data paints a bearish outlook in the futures market.\n\nSimilarly, ETH long/short ratio showed sellers had a little upper hand at press time, commanding a dominance at 52.98% on the 4-hour timeframe.\n\nAs such, more upside moves could delay for a while before ETH attempts to break above the range high.

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, appears to be on the verge of a potential reversal.\n\nTechnical analysis shows a compelling case for Ethereum\u2019s potential reversal toward the $1,900 mark. The coin has shown signs of finding support at its current levels, and with mounting buying pressure, a bullish trend could be on the horizon.\n\nAs the crypto market continues to evolve, all eyes are now on Ethereum and its potential reversal.\n\nDecreasing Volatility, Trading Volume Indicate Potential Reversal For Ethereum\n\nEthereum\u2019s price charts reveal a notable decline in volatility, indicating a potential shift in market sentiment. Volatility, which measures the frequency and magnitude of price fluctuations, is on the decline, suggesting that the bearish sentiment surrounding Ethereum may be losing steam.\n\nThis drop in volatility often precedes trend reversals and signifies a market that is maturing and finding consensus among investors.\n\nAccompanying the decreasing volatility, Ethereum has also experienced a decline in trading volume, a crucial indicator of market activity and investor interest. The reduced trading volume is significant as it signifies a decrease in selling pressure, creating an environment conducive to potential price spikes.\n\nFor Ethereum, the diminishing trading volume sets the stage for a bullish reversal and hints at the possibility of an upward price surge.\n\nSource: Coingecko\n\nAmidst these positive indicators, Ethereum continues to ride the wave of success, with CoinGecko reporting an impressive price of $1,862, reflecting a remarkable 3.1% rally in the past 24 hours alone. Furthermore, the cryptocurrency demonstrates a promising seven-day increase of 2.8%, adding to its growing momentum.\n\nSource: CryptoQuant\n\nMixed Signals: Staking Inflows Down\n\nDespite Ethereum\u2019s positive price momentum and decreasing volatility, recent data from CryptoQuant reveals a decline in staking inflows. On Sunday, staking inflows stood at 93,952 ETH but dropped to 71,648 ETH on Monday. Although still higher compared to recent dips, the decrease in staking inflows suggests a potential shift in investor behavior.\n\nOn the other hand, the total value staked continues to climb. This indicates that while the rate of increase has slowed down, there is still ongoing interest in staking Ethereum, potentially driven by the prospect of earning passive income through staking rewards.\n\nETHUSD currently at $1,861 on the daily chart at TradingView.com\n\nAnother aspect to consider is the withdrawal profile, which has presented mixed signals. Overnight, there was a notable spike in principal withdrawals, indicating a bearish sentiment. However, projections for the morning session suggest a more bullish outlook, with expectations of principal ETH withdrawals falling to below-normal levels.\n\nThese withdrawal patterns contribute to the overall uncertainty surrounding Ethereum\u2019s short-term market outlook. While staking inflows decrease and withdrawal activity remains inconsistent, investors and analysts are closely monitoring these indicators to gauge the direction of the market and the sentiment of Ethereum holders.\n\n-Featured image from WSJ\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

I couldn\u2019t deduce it from the paper.\u201d\n\nThe Ongoing Decentralization Debate\n\nSchwartz\u2019s inquiry emerges amidst a broader ongoing debate within the cryptocurrency community, specifically regarding the essence of decentralization, particularly within decentralized finance (DeFi) projects.\n\nFormer Ripple Director Speaks Out\n\nRecently, Matt Hamilton, former Director of Developer Relations at ripple ripple m***[email protected] Crypto / Blockchain SolutionPayment solution , came to the defense of XRP\u2019s decentralization status. In response to a crypto enthusiast\u2019s claim that XRP lacked decentralization and was merely a payment network, Hamilton refuted the statement.\n\nThree weeks ago, while defending XRP\u2019s decentralization, Hamilton revealed an intriguing detail about the XRP Ledger\u2019s creation. He disclosed a unique early association between the XRP Ledger and vitalik buterin vitalik buterin co-founder at Ethereum Vitalik Buterin is a professional programmer and writer who is famous as the Co-Founder of Ethereum. Buterin along with Gavin Wood, Charles Hoskinson, Joseph Lubin, and Anthony Di launched Ethereum in 2014. He co-created Ethereum when he understood that he could construct a new, possibly enhanced version by iterating on the Bitcoin blockchain. He has been involved in the Bitcoin community since 2011, writing and co-founding articles for Bitcoin magazine. Vitalik linked Bitcoin to a calculator and a future blockchain to a smartphone and used the same method of improving the system\u2019s strength by making it more general purpose to blockchain network space. He was honored with the Thiel Fellowship Award in 2014 for bringing his innovative scientific and technical projects to reality, won the World Technology Network prize, Fortune 40 under 40 lists, and appeared on the Under 30 list of Forbes at the age of 23. EntrepreneurCrypto and Blockchain Expert , co-founder of Ethereum. In an interesting anecdote, Hamilton shared that Buterin had once stayed at David Schwartz\u2019s home while striving to secure an internship with Ripple.\n\nAlso Read: Ripple To Spend $250,000 For Transparency, But Will It Pay Off? \u2013 Coinpedia Fintech News\n\nSchwartz\u2019s Voice in the Debate\n\nDavid Schwartz, whose couch played a role in Vitalik Buterin\u2019s early career, has been an active participant in this ongoing decentralization debate. He has emphasized how the XRP Ledger\u2019s consensus mechanism ensures a genuine level of decentralization, surpassing even the celebrated proof-of-work blockchains like Bitcoin.\n\nSchwartz\u2019s recent interest in the legal protections proposed by Buterin adds another layer to this ongoing conversation. The exploration of these protections could significantly impact the understanding and implementation of blockchain technology in the future. The outcome of this discussion will be worth following closely."

        "content": "Ethereum price is eyeing an upside break above the $1,850 resistance against the US Dollar.\n\nETH price is now trading above $1,750 and the 55 simple moving average (4 hours).\n\nThere was a break above a key contracting triangle with resistance near $1,820 on the 4-hour chart (data feed from Coinbase).\n\nThe pair could climb further if it stays above the $1,800 support zone.\n\nEthereum price is rising above the $1,820 level against the US Dollar. ETH/USD could rise further if it clears the $1,880 resistance zone.\n\nEthereum Price Analysis\n\nIn the past few days, Ethereum saw a downside correction from the $2,020 zone against the US Dollar. ETH price declined below the $1,850 level and the 55 simple moving average (4 hours).\n\nThe bears even pushed the price below the $1,750 level. A low was formed near $1,737 and the price is now attempting a fresh increase. There was a move above the $1,800 resistance level. The price broke the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2,020 swing high to the $1,737 low.\n\nThere was also a break above a key contracting triangle with resistance near $1,820 on the 4-hours chart. It is now trading above $1,750 and the 55 simple moving average (4 hours).\n\nImmediate resistance on the upside is near the $1,880 level. It is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2,020 swing high to the $1,737 low. The next major resistance is near the $1,920 zone. A clear move above the $1,920 level could send the price toward $2,000.\n\nAny more gains could even send the price toward the $2,150 resistance zone or $2,200 in the near term. On the downside, initial support is near the $1,800 level. The next major support is now near the $1,750 level.\n\nA break below the $1,750 support could push the price to $1,600. Any more losses could lead the price toward $1,550 or even $1,500 in the coming days.\n\nLooking at the chart, Ethereum price is clearly trading above the $1,750 zone and the 55 simple moving average (4 hours). Overall, Ether price could climb further if it stays above the $1,800 support zone.\n\nTechnical indicators\n\n4 hours MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is now losing momentum in the bullish zone.\n\n4 hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now above the 50 level.\n\nKey Support Levels \u2013 $1,600, followed by the $1,570 zone.\n\nKey Resistance$ Levels \u2013 $1,660 and $1,740."

        "title": "Arbitrum Bridge Beginner's Guide - Part 2 - Altcoin Buzz",
        "content": "Arbitrum, a layer-two scaling solution for Ethereum, is an excellent way to solve speed, cost, and scalability problems with Ethereum.\n\nIn Part 1 of the Beginner\u2019s Guide to the Arbitrum Bridge, we discussed what Arbitrum is and how the Arbitrum Bridge works. In Part 2, we take a look at cross-chain transfers and how to connect Arbitrum to other well-known blockchain networks. Whether you want to connect Arbitrum to Ethereum, Avalanche, Optimism, or zkSync, this detailed guide will show you how.\n\n1) Using the Arbitrum Bridge to Transfer Tokens to Ethereum\n\nTransferring ERC-20 tokens from the Ethereum blockchain to Arbitrum can provide numerous advantages. Firstly, the scalability allows for faster transaction times, with the capacity to handle 4500 TPS (Transactions Per Second).\n\nFurthermore, implementing \u201coptimistic roll-ups\u201d has resulted in lower transaction fees, making it a cost-effective scaling solution. On the Ethereum mainnet, the standard gas fee is $10 (on a normal day). While on Arbitrum, the typical gas fee is only about $0.10. So, Bridging tokens to Arbitrum allows token issuers to expand their user base and improve the overall user experience through enhanced scalability and reduced fees.\n\nHow to Usethe Aribtrum Bridge with Ethereum\n\nGo to the Arbitrum Bridge website. Connect your wallet to the platform. (Several wallets, including Ledger Live, Coinbase Wallet, and MetaMask, are available.) Select the asset ($ETH, $USDC, $USDT, and $DAI) you want to bridge. Input the number of tokens. Follow the prompts to finish the transaction.\n\nThe gas fee is paid in $ETH. So ensure your wallet has enough ETH to pay the gas fee.\n\n2) Using the Arbitrum Bridge to Transfer Tokens to Avalanche\n\nThe bridge between Arbitrum and Avalanche provides users with multiple advantages. The main advantage is lower gas fees compared to Ethereum mainnet. For instance, Gas fees on Arbitrum average around $0.10, while on Avalanche, they are even lower at approximately $0.05.\n\nArbitrum and Avalanche offer faster transaction speeds than Ethereum mainnet. In addition, Arbitrum and Avalanche offer faster transaction processing with average times of 2 seconds and 1 second, respectively.\n\nSo, using the Arbitrum bridge with Avalanche provides access to a broader selection of DeFi applications on Avalanche. According to DeFillama, Avalanche has more than 200 dApps, providing users with more options for yield farming and trading. However, Arbitrum also has more than 200 dApps. Moreover, Avalanche has better liquidity. As of May 2023, DeFi on Avalanche has surpassed $10B in total value locked, while Arbitrum has around $5B.\n\nHow to Use the Aribtrum Bridge with Avalanche\n\nUsers can transfer assets from one network to another by using a bridge service, such as Avalanche Bridge, to connect Arbitrum to Avalanche using the following steps:\n\nGo to the Synapse Protocol website. Connect your wallet to the platform. Select the asset you want to transfer. Input the number of tokens. Follow the prompts to finish the transaction.\n\nWhen it comes to bridging between Avalanche and Arbitrum, the Synapse protocol is one of the safest and most cost-effective options.\n\nSo, the costs of using Synapse for the bridge are about $10. This fee structure is noticeably less expensive than other platforms, which frequently charge between $20 and $35. Using $SYN, the Synapse native token, users can benefit from 0% slippage and lower transaction fees.\n\n3) Using the Arbitrum Bridge to Transfer Tokens to Optimism\n\nOptimism, a layer-two scaling solution for Ethereum, employs Optimistic Rollups to boost throughput and lower fees. This architecture lets Optimism handle transactions faster and cheaper than Ethereum.\n\nSo, using the arbitrum bridge with Optimism with lower gas fees than Ethereum mainnet, averaging around $0.10 and $0.05, respectively. Also, Optimism offers faster transactions in 1 second.\n\nHow to Use the Aribtrum Bridge with Optimism\n\nGo to the Across Protocol. Connect your wallet to the platform. Select the asset you want to transfer. Input the number of tokens. Follow the prompts to finish the transaction.\n\nSynapse, Hop, Anyswap, and Multichain protocols are all solid options for transferring assets from Arbitrum to Optimism. However, the Across protocol, a trusted Layer-2 cross-chain bridge, is the best way to connect Optimism and Arbitrum. The platform is the go-to bridge for layer 2 protocols on Ethereum, such as Optimism, Arbitrum, Boba, Polygon, and many others.\n\n4) Using the Arbitrum Bridge to Transfer Tokens to zkSync\n\nzkSync is an L2 scaling solution that utilizes zero-knowledge roll-up technology to enhance transaction throughput and reduce fees. As a result, zkSync makes transactions faster and cheaper. So, the Arbitrum bridge with zkSync provides several advantages for users, such as reduced gas fees, quicker transaction processing, enhanced security, and ease of use.\n\nHow to Use the Aribtrum Bridge with zkSync\n\nGo to the Orbiter Finance. Connect your wallet. Choose the token you want to bridge. Select the zkSync network as the destination network. Enter the number of tokens you wish to bridge and follow the instructions to complete the transaction.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Arbitrum Bridge\u2019s simplicity and security make it a valuable tool for exploring opportunities in layer-2 and layer-1 networks. Also, It enables users to navigate and bridge between different chains, including Ethereum, Polygon, Optimism, Avalanche, ZKSync, and more.\n\n\u2b06\ufe0f For more cryptocurrency news, check out the Altcoin Buzz YouTube channel.\n\n\u2b06\ufe0f Our popular Altcoin Buzz Access group generates tons of alpha for our subscribers.

        "content": "The monthly trading volume of nonfungible tokens (NFTs) and memecoins on Bitcoin in May surpassed Solana\u2019s volume, according to data from CryptoSlam.\n\nBitcoin ordinals trading volume currently stands in second place behind Ethereum, which did $393 million in NFT volume, more than twice that of ordinals on Bitcoin (BTC) in 30-days starting April 23. Bitcoin gained a significant lead over popular blockchains like Polygon, ImmutableX, BNB Chain and Solana during this period.\n\nAccording to a Dune dashboard by BRC-20 token standard creator Domo, BRC-20 token transactions accounted for the majority of ordinals activity on Bitcoin.\n\nThe BRC-20 token standard is an experimental fungible token standard built using ordinals. It has harbored hype for memecoin, speculative cryptocurrencies whose price action is fueled by certain enthusiastic communities.\n\nThe total market capitalization of BRC-20 memecoins breached the $1 billion mark during the first half of May as the hype around it picked up. The current market capitalization of BRC-20 tokens is $447 million.\n\nPercentage share of Bitcoin transactions by activity. Source: Dune\n\nThe popular BRC-20 tokens like ORDI, PEPE and MEME have no utility attached to them and were primarily issued for experimental purposes. For instance, Twitter user Domo created ORDI to showcase the BRC-20 functionality that Ordinals provided.\n\nThe primary driver of BRC-20 volumes appears to be coming from traders who are looking to benefit from the newfound craze. However, as gains subside, the trading activity around BRC-20 tokens will likely fall as well.\n\nBitcoin NFT trading picks up\n\nBesides BRC-20 tokens, the market is witnessing a shift from BRC-20 tokens to media-based ordinals, aka Bitcoin NFTs. Magic Eden, a popular Bitcoin NFT marketplace, has started to eat into UniSat\u2019s volume, which primarily trades in BRC-20 tokens.\n\nPercentage share of volume by marketplace. Source: Dune\n\nPopular collections like Bitcoin Frogs did around one-fourth the volume of top collections on Ethereum like Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), which did just over $40 million in trading volume between April 23 and May 23.\n\nNFT traders will hope to replicate the success of Ethereum NFTs on Bitcoin with collections forming exclusive groups of ordinals holders.\n\nSo far, the Bitcoin NFT ecosystem appears miles behind Ethereum, which can support decentralized autonomous organizations and has other advantages like integration with the $27.5 billion strong decentralized finance ecosystem.\n\nFor instance, BAYC and Azuki have metaverse projects built around them, which provide exclusive advantages to NFT holders. On the other hand, CryptoPunks and Milady Maker enjoy popularity due to their scarcity and early mover advantage.\n\nRelated: Milady NFT floor price surges after Elon Musk tweet\n\nIt remains to be seen how successful Bitcoin NFT collections are in forming loyal communities like that of CryptoPunks, Milady Maker, Azuki or BAYC. While the trading volume of NFTs and memecoins on Bitcoin attained the second spot in May, the NFT collections have yet to provide utility or build a loyal community of holders.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "Cryptoassets: Intrinsic Value Matters Value investing in cryptoassets - How do I separate the wheat from the chaff, or scam from substance?\n\nToday, \u201ccrypto\u201d is hardly understood as an investment instrument. Crypto is obviously not crypto, and the positions on what is valid sometimes diverge diametrically, even between proven authorities. This leads to great uncertainty among experts, and even more so among the general public. This article aims to shed some light through the fog onto crypto and help distinguish crypto-scam from crypto-value. It will show which cryptoassets and crypto tokens have intrinsic value and how this could be measured in the future using fundamental value analysis methods. The two largest and oldest cryptos, BTC (of the Bitcoin network) and ETH (of the Ethereum network), serve as reference points and examples.\n\n1. Cryptoassets: Light and shade\n\n\u201cA cryptocurrency is not a currency, not a commodity, and not a security, \u2026 It\u2019s a gambling contract with a nearly 100% edge for the house\u201d It\u2019s \u201ccrazy, stupid, gambling,\u201d and \u201cpeople who oppose my position are idiots\u201d, so Charlie Munger in February 2023.[1]\n\nThis cryptocurrency is \u201c\u2026 misunderstood \u2026\u201d. It can provide \u201can insurance policy against financiel disaster,\u2026\u201d because it is \u201cnot connected to the rest of the financial system,\u201d so Bill Miller about Bitcoin in October 2022.[2]\n\nThese contrasting positions roughly cover the spectrum of opinion on cryptocurrencies as an investment vehicle. Both come from experienced investors who have been successful for decades and who follow the same value-oriented, long-term investment philosophy that was largely coined by Warren Buffet: \u201cvalue investing.\u201d\n\nHowever, they also clearly show a problem: crypto is quite obviously not crypto; positions sometimes diverge diametrically. This in turn leads to great uncertainty among experts, and even more so among the general public. Especially when authorities, who are considered to be experts and responsible in their actions, make such contradictory statements, it is no longer understood what is valid, or whether and whom one can believe. Pointed statements like those of Charlie Munger lead to \u201cFUD\u201d (Fear-Uncertainty-Doubt) among the general public: A subject that is beneficial in many areas, but complex, is no longer understood.\n\nThis article aims to shed some light into the crypto fog and help distinguish crypto-scam from crypto-value. It will show which cryptocurrencies have intrinsic value and how this could be measured in the future using fundamental value analysis approaches. The two largest and oldest cryptos, BTC (of the Bitcoin network) and ETH (of the Ethereum network), serve as reference points and examples.\n\n2. Cryptos with and without intrinsic value\n\nThe term \u201ccrypto\u201d is part of this fog, diffuse and vague. It was coined with the introduction of the first and still largest cryptocurrency: Bitcoin. Today, crypto amongst others stands for cryptocurrency, cryptoasset, or crypto token. Since the first BTC token was issued in 2009, thousands of cryptos have been released, creating a flood of terminology along with it. A clarification of terms is therefore helpful.\n\n2.1. Cryptoassets and token\n\nAs a possible investment instrument with intrinsic value, the term cryptoasset is central and as a definition, the following, own, may be appropriate:\n\nA cryptoasset is a digital asset that serves as a medium of exchange, a store of value, or an investment vehicle and uses cryptography to secure transactions and control the creation of new entities. It enables peer-to-peer transactions by using distributed ledger technology (\u201cDLT\u201d) with blockchain technology and operates without central authorities such as government agencies or financial intermediaries.\n\nCryptoasset is often used synonymously with cryptocurrency, but is the umbrella term. Cryptocurrency is a specialty term used to describe the case where a cryptoasset functions primarily as a medium of exchange.\n\nThus, CBDCs (Central Bank Digital Currency) pushed by national banks fall out of consideration as cryptoassets. While they first emerged in response to cryptocurrencies, they are issued centrally by central banks. They also do not necessarily use blockchain technology.\n\nCryptoassets are often also referred to as (crypto) tokens. Crypto token describes an information on a DLT system that can represent rights of any kind and can be assigned to one or more public keys. Against a regulatory background, such tokens were further subdivided early on into payment tokens, utility tokens and asset tokens in order to regulate the applicability of money laundering regulations or securities legislation.[3] However, nothing can be derived from these regulatory terms for the valuation of an intrinsic value, which is exemplified by asset tokens. These represent asset-pegged rights mapped on the blockchain. The right is embodied, but never the real asset. This always remains together with the intrinsic value outside the token or the DLT system.\n\nFor the assessment of intrinsic values, another token concept is in the focus here.\n\n2.2. Native token with intrinsic value\n\nAt the center of the valuation method for an intrinsic value presented here is the so-called \u201cnative token\u201d.\n\nNative Token:\n\nNative tokens emerge from the blockchain itself, either originally with their creation or later through minting. Both the issuance procedure is codified in the blockchain\u2019s own protocol or smart contract as well as the so-called consensus procedure, which determines how native tokens are to be minted later on the blockchain, for example via PoW for BTC and via PoS for ETH (more on this below). Native tokens, sometimes also referred to as \u201cnative currency\u201d or \u201ccoin\u201d for short, do not compete with the regulatory token types described above but can also fall under them. For example, BTC as a native token is simultaneously qualified by regulators as a currency token.\n\nBy contrast, not a native token is an NFT (non-fungible token). An NFT represents a unique asset such as a real or virtual work of art. Unlike native tokens, it is created through so-called tokenization. This involves creating a crypto token that embodies a physical or intangible good, which can then be stored, transferred or traded on a blockchain (more on tokenization of real goods in another article).\n\nIntrinsic value:\n\nIn traditional stock valuation, which we borrow from here, intrinsic value is the value of the company that issued the stock. The valuation is based on an analysis of the fundamentals and characteristics of the company.[4] The intrinsic value of a stock thus reflects the actual value and not a market price, which is based on supply and demand and may be undervalued or overvalued. The terms fundamental value, fair value or floor value are also used for intrinsic value.\n\nWith the native token, an intrinsic value is derived directly from its own underlying blockchain network. The native token draws this from its network function as the primary medium of exchange and store of value. The two most prominent and largest cryptoassets as native tokens are BTC and ETH.\n\n2.3. BTC and ETH: Native cryptoassets with intrinsic value\n\nBTC and ETH (\u201cEther\u201d) denote the (native) tokens and are to be distinguished from Bitcoin and Ethereum as their respective blockchain networks. Both tokens can be traded via exchanges or peer-to-peer, i.e. directly between individuals, with trading via an exchange resulting in a market price. In contrast, the fundamental value is derived from the benefit of the network platform for its participants. As a valuation object, BTC and ETH furthermore differ in some essential aspects.\n\n2.3.1. Bitcoin \u2013 A decentralized payment network\n\nThe white paper, published in 2008 under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, describes Bitcoin as \u201ca purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash [that would] allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution\u201d For the first time, ownership of virtual property is possible without the need for a central authority such as a bank.\n\nThrough the network currency BTC, the network is operated, esp. the miners are compensated. In addition, the coin serves as a store of value and as a medium of exchange, which is why it is attributed the characteristics of a currency. In contrast to state currencies, whose monetary amounts are constantly being expanded, the amount of Bitcoins is limited to 21 million from the start, making BTC a scarce commodity, similar to gold, which is why it is also called \u201cdigital gold\u201d.\n\nPut simply, then, Bitcoin can be described as a peer-to-peer electronic payment system that operates in a fully decentralized manner, and whose value is directly reflected in BTC as its own (private) and limited-quantity cryptocurrency.\n\n2.3.2. Ethereum \u2013 A decentralized multipurpose network\n\nEthereum has existed since mid-2015 and was described by its co-founder Vitalik Buterin in a whitepaper in 2013. The Swiss-domiciled Ethereum Foundation defines the network as follows:\n\n\u201cEthereum is a technology that serves the common good. It is a worldwide system, an open-source platform to write computer code that stores and automates digital databases using smart contracts without relying upon a central intermediary, solving trust with cryptographic techniques.\u201d\n\nDesigned as a multipurpose platform, dApps (\u201cdecentralized applications\u201d) can be programmed on Ethereum via smart contracts by anyone, creating a wide variety of applications and business models. Its multipurpose capability sets Ethereum apart from Bitcoin (exclusively a payment network). It is its unique selling point and brand essence (more on this in an earlier article). Further, since the protocol upgrade in September 2022 (also referred to as the \u201cMerge\u201d), the network uses a Proof-of-Stake (\u201cPoS\u201d) consensus process, rather than an energy-intensive PoW (Proof-of-Work) like Bitcoin.\n\nThe two native tokens, BTC and ETH, thus derive their respective intrinsic value from different uses: BTC from the utility of its peer-to-peer payment platform and its potential as a currency, whereas ETH from its multipurpose capability and utility as a growing ecosystem around the applications that thrive within it.\n\n3. Valuation methods\n\n3.1. Traditional fundamental value analysis \u2013 The counter concept to speculation\n\nValuation methods have long been established in stock analysis. Traditionally, a distinction is made between the following two. Increasingly, such methods are also used for cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe technical analysis method aims at forecasting short-term price trends or entry and exit points by means of statistical analysis of price and volume data, exploiting price fluctuations and thus achieving price gains. Fundamental values are not taken into account. For both traditional securities and crypto investments, the application requires a lot of experience, expertise and skill to avoid remaining pure speculation.\n\nIn contrast, the method of \u201cvalue investing\u201d aims at the intrinsic value of an investment. Value investors look for assets that are significantly undervalued relative to the traded market price and assume that their valuation will be reflected in the market (price) over the long term. Value-based investing focuses on intrinsic value and is designed for the long term, not price and speculative short-term gains.\n\nApproaches to this fundamental value analysis are also increasingly emerging for crypto investments. For example, it can be used to hide the enormous market volatility, and there is no need to keep an eye on positions 24/7. An idea of what a fundamental value analysis tool for crypto stocks might look like can be found at Coinfairvalue, for example. However, its model differs significantly from the one presented here.\n\n3.2. Crypto \u2013 Arrived in the traditional financial analysis\n\nRecently, the renowned CFA Institute, which awards the CFA Charter and is considered the gold standard of investment analysis, has also been looking into the valuation of cryptoassets; it issued a research paper on the subject in January 2023. This is remarkable, it means that crypto has now fully arrived in the traditional financial world. Just 2 years ago, the debate was whether cryptoassets had any quality as an asset class at all. Today, the answer is largely in the affirmative: Cryptoassets are seen as an alternative asset class, comparable to commodities, for example.\n\nIn equity analysis, their intrinsic value is calculated based on 1) present value or discounted-cashflow, 2) multiplier models, and 3) asset-based valuation models or a combination thereof. The difficulty for cryptoassets, however, is that the valuation parameters required depending on the nature of the asset in question, such as cashflow, earnings, or balance sheet assets, are not available or not sufficiently available, so they largely lead nowhere.[5] For example, cryptocurrencies with a primary function as a medium of exchange, such as Bitcoin, lack data points like interest rate differentials or measurement techniques for purchasing power of goods and services.\n\n4. Crypto: Intrinsic value from own network\n\nFor the above reasons, the CFA Institute proposes an approach adapted for the crypto world that makes native tokens the valuation object for fundamental intrinsic value analysis.\n\n4.1. The use case oriented network approach\n\nThe so-called use case oriented network approach is based on a demand oriented view and ignores supply oriented aspects.[6]\n\nThe network approach builds on the so-called Metcalfe\u2019s law, according to which the value of a network grows exponentially with the growth of its users.[7] The number of active users of a network is thus its central measurement parameter.\n\nThe other aspect of the model comes from an analysis of the main economic use cases of the native cryptoasset and its specific measurement points: Intrinsic value is underpinned by these base use cases regardless of economic or market conditions, thereby determining how its participants actually use the instrument:\n\nValue-creating factors for the intrinsic value of the native token are thus the number of permanent users of its use cases, or at least for these users.[8]\n\nThis also helps explain why even at the low point of a crypto winter, investment instruments such as Bitcoin or Ether do not fall to zero. The underlying base use cases ensure sustained demand even in the most adverse market conditions and guarantee a minimum value equal to the intrinsic token value at the time. The last time such floor values were observed was from November 2022 to January 2023. BTC never fell below the USD 16,000 mark, ETH never below USD 1,000.\n\n4.2. The economic use cases of the network\n\nSo, in addition to the number of active users (network idea), the various economic use cases of a blockchain network and their measurement parameters need to be understood. A list has emerged of use cases that have the potential to be an enduring source of demand for cryptoassets and contribute to its intrinsic value.[9] It is not considered exhaustive and will also change over time.\n\nStore of value (BTC + ETH) Cryptocurrency as an alternative form of money or currency (BTC + ETH) Investment and speculation (BTC + ETH) Source of funding for illegal activities (BTC + ETH) Other uses (BTC + ETH). DeFi, including lending and borrowing (ETH) Smart contract applications (ETH) Tokenization of real-world assets and processes (ETH)\n\nThe cryptoassets BTC and ETH both host several enduring economic use cases. We shed light on the more robust of them here.\n\n4.2.1. Store of value (BTC + ETH)\n\nBitcoin is digital gold. It is often claimed that Bitcoin is a hedge against inflation, similar to gold. However, especially in the past months when inflation was and still is experiencing highs worldwide, this effect could not be proven as the chart below shows. Only time will tell whether Bitcoin will be able to establish itself permanently as a store of value and inflation protection and as an alternative to physical gold.\n\nThe same can be said of ETH, which is also often referred to as digital silver. Unlike BTC, however, ETH has had an additional deflationary effect since its protocol change last September, and this could have a positive impact on its demand in the future.\n\n4.2.2. Alternative form of money or currency (BTC + ETH)\n\nBitcoin is the purest of all cryptocurrencies and form of money. Nevertheless, even it does not (yet) meet all three formal qualifying requirements for money:\n\nBTC is not yet a store of value (see above). BTC is not yet a unit of account. If it were, its value would not always be expressed and measured in its fiat equivalent (usually USD). However, with more widespread mass adoption of BTC, this criterion could be met in the future. Consider, for example, countries like El Salvador, which have already approved BTC as an official alternative currency. BTC is unquestionably a medium of exchange\n\nRegardless of this formal consideration, Bitcoin or even ETH have already achieved money-like status outside of El Salvador. How else can it be explained that central banks are experimenting with CDBCs, would they not see private cryptocurrencies as a threat to their own state currency? It can be assumed today that the usage as money will become permanently established, driven in particular by mass adoption in countries in the southern hemisphere, most of whose unbanked inhabitants.\n\n4.2.3. Investment and speculation (BTC + ETH)\n\nThere is undoubtedly a high demand for this economic use case, which results from speculation and short-term trading, but also \u201cbuy-and-hold\u201d strategies (called \u201chodling\u201d for short among crypto investors). While the crypto market is not yet maturely developed and the data available from crypto exchanges is also still unreliable, there are some indicators that are already taking hold. Cryptoassets are now seen as alternative investment instruments. They can thus be part of a diversification strategy of a financial portfolio and their addition can have a positive impact on its performance (measurable via Sharpe ratio, for example). Furthermore, especially for BTC and ETH, another indicator for long-term investments is the average holding period of a token. The chart below shows that this is around 150 weeks (just under 3 years) for BTC and just under 70 weeks (1 year and 4 months) for ETH. However, for other coins, this use case is not likely to materialize yet.\n\nFor ETH, the aforementioned \u201cMerge\u201d last year and the switch to the PoS consensus process results in yet another long-term investment case, so-called \u201cstaking\u201d. In this case, participants use their cryptocurrency as collateral to validate transactions and create new blocks, and receive compensation for doing so, comparable to interest on a savings account. This creates an incentive to keep ETH locked in for as long as possible. This should extend the average holding period, reduce the volatility of the currency and have an overall positive impact on the ETH investment purpose.\n\n4.2.4. DeFi\n\nDeFi (\u201cDecentralized Finance\u201d) is currently perhaps the most robust and well-known of the Ethereum network\u2019s own economic use cases: DeFi stands for the decentralization of financial activities such as lending and borrowing through the use of (public) blockchain protocols. Corresponding financial transactions are thus conducted without central entities such as banks or (central) exchanges. The DeFi sector originally emerged from the Ethereum network. Currently, the Ethereum share of the DeFi sector is still > 58%. This corresponds to approximately $28 billion in TVL (Total Value Locked), the measurement indicator for the DeFi sector, which corresponds to the total value of tokens deposited in a DeFi protocol.\n\nDemand is stable despite the current crypto winter, but the breakthrough to sustained demand has not yet been achieved, and institutional investors in particular are still cautious. This could change, however, if the gaps in crypto investment regulation were closed; the EU, the UK and Switzerland have already made progress in this regard, while the U.S. is yet to do so. DeFi therefore already represents a significant economic use case for the ETH token today, and even more so in the future, should the breakthrough actually take place.\n\n4.2.5. And financing illegal activities?\n\nThis use case is largely fog and FUD. Yes, it exists, but it is overstated: The fact is that in 2021, it is estimated that around $14 billion was transacted via crypto as part of illicit activities,[10] a marginal fraction of what is achieved within the existing traditional financial system, 2-5% of global GDP, between USD 800 billion and 2 trillion[11].\n\n5. Conclusion\n\nWe have seen that native tokens can have intrinsic value that they derive directly from their own blockchain network. NFTs do not fall into this category, CBDCs are not crypto tokens, and regulatory token terms do not qualify for a corresponding statement.\n\nIntrinsic value can be derived using approaches already known from traditional fundamental value analysis for equity securities and adapted for cryptoassets, first and foremost the use case oriented network approach. According to this method, both BTC and ETH undoubtedly have an intrinsic value. However, its amount can currently only be roughly estimated. Cryptoassets as an alternative investment instrument and valuation object are still in their infancy; the method investigated, together with the effective measurement parameters, still needs to be refined and a sound database to be built. In any case, however, the intrinsic value \u2013 as we have seen \u2013 has a value that is far from zero even in times of greatest market turbulence. So the foundation has been laid.\n\nPerhaps a crypto investment is not a currency, not a commodity, and not a security in the traditional sense. But by no means is it a gambling contract with a nearly 100% edge for the house as Charlie Munger, a 99-year-old star investor of the old school puts it. Fundamental value analysis methods of the modern era adapted to blockchain ecosystems and their native tokens point in the opposite direction. Perhaps that\u2019s why it is now time to put a Munger opinion in the FUD drawer for good, too.\n\nSources\n\n[1] Wall Street Journal, 01.02.2023\n\n[2] Forbes/SHOOK Top Advisor Summit, 13.10.2022\n\n[3] The typology for these (fungible) crypto tokens goes back to the ICO guidance developed by the Swiss financial market regulator in 2018, which also gained international acceptance.\n\n[4] S.

        "content": "Digital dreams collide with digital memes in the crypto space! Learning the language of cryptocurrencies unlocks the secrets of a digital treasure chest. Every phrase in this space carries a special meaning \u2013 from hodling (holding onto your coins for dear life) to moonshots (price surges that shoot the coin to the moon).\n\nMeme coins in particular have brought a whole other type of language to the crypto industry. These quirky tokens, inspired by viral memes and pop culture, bring a fun, light-hearted punch to the otherwise dull and confusing cryptocurrency lingo.\n\nIn this article, we\u2019ll go through the classic \u2018lingo\u2019 of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, as well as the new, cool \u2018lingo\u2019 of meme coins like DogeMiyagi.\n\nThe Language of Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin (BTC) is a pioneering cryptocurrency that has captivated the world with its revolutionary concepts and mysterious origins. It is a virtual currency designed to be a decentralised form of money and payment, removing the need for intermediaries in financial transactions.\n\nCreated in 2009 by an enigmatic figure known as Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin has become a household name and the world\u2019s most prominent cryptocurrency. What sets Bitcoin apart? It has a secret language known to its dedicated followers.\n\nFirst, we have the blockchain, the foundation of Bitcoin\u2019s power. A blockchain is a distributed ledger, a secure database that stores information. Transactions are recorded on the blockchain, with each new block linking to the previous one, creating an unbreakable chain. This process is made possible by the hard work of miners, the valiant warriors of the network who verify transactions and ensure their legitimacy.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s unique lingo continues beyond there. HODL, a term born from a typo, has become an anthem for Bitcoin enthusiasts. It stands for \u201cHold On for Dear Life,\u201d embodying the steadfast belief in the long-term value of Bitcoin, even during turbulent times.\n\nThe Verbiage of Ethereum\n\nEthereum is the second-largest player in the cryptocurrency arena. Ethereum\u2019s claim to fame lies in its introduction of smart contract functionality, which has paved the way for decentralised apps (dApps) and decentralised finance (DeFi).\n\nEthereum operates on its own native token Ether (ETH). ETH serves as the fuel for all network transactions, known as gas fees.\n\nThe advent of smart contracts has propelled Ethereum\u2019s growth, enabling the flourishing ecosystem of dApps and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). These self-executing software programs operate autonomously, revolutionising how digital assets are created, traded, and managed.\n\nIn terms of Ethereum\u2019s unique lingo, it embraces concepts like gas fees, smart contracts, dApps, and the transition from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS). These terms reflect the intricacies of Ethereum\u2019s infrastructure and the potential it offers for decentralised applications, revolutionary financial systems, and the future of blockchain technology.\n\nThe Lingo of DogeMiyagi\n\nDogecoin and Shiba Inu dominate the meme coin world, but a formidable contender is on the horizon \u2013 DogeMiyagi (MIYAGI). Meme coins are cryptocurrencies based on viral internet jokes, and MIYAGI is no exception. DogeMiyagi is in its presale phase, which is the initial phase of a cryptocurrency launch where tokens are sold at a significant discount. So far, MIYAGI has raised $145,726.\n\nDogeMiyagi merges the wisdom of Mr Miyagi from The Karate Kid with the ever-popular \u2018doge\u2019 meme. Fostering a vibrant and supportive community, DogeMiyagi embodies the principles of energy efficiency and resourcefulness, echoing Miyagi-sensei\u2019s teachings of fighting opponents intelligently.\n\nBy selecting a blockchain that prioritises energy efficiency, DogeMiyagi proves its dedication to energy conservation is genuine and sets an example for other cryptocurrencies.\n\nFind out more about DogeMiyagi:\n\nWebsite: https://dogemiyagi.com\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/_Dogemiyagi_\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/dogemiyagi\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Ethereum Founder Vitalik Buterin Cautions Against Overloading Consensus | Bitcoinist.com - Bitcoinist",
        "content": "In a recent blog post, Vitalik Buterin warned against overloading the network\u2019s consensus. While Ethereum\u2019s consensus is highly secure, Buterin said overloading it would expose the ecosystem to high systemic risks.\n\nButerin\u2019s post follows massive congestion on the Bitcoin network, which led to a surge in transaction fees.\n\nPossible Risks of Consensus Overload\n\nCrypto assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum use the consensus mechanism to validate transaction authenticity and maintain the security of the underlying blockchain.\n\nThis consensus mechanism influences how a blockchain network verifies transactions while determining network fees, transaction speed, and more.\n\nAmid surging transaction fees on the Bitcoin network due to congestion, Buterin asked users not to overload Ethereum validators to preserve the consensus mechanism.\n\nIn his blog post, the co-founder warned against the dangers of overworking Ethereum\u2019s consensus. He said some proposals suggested using Ethereum consensus for other purposes, such as price oracles and re-staking. And some even suggested using layer-1 forks to recover layer-2 projects in the event of unexpected occurrences.\n\nWhile the urge to expand the blockchain\u2019s core functionality is high, Buterin said such an extension would render it fragile. He pointed out that a certain subset of these techniques brings high systemic risks to the ecosystem and should be resisted and discouraged.\n\nIf validators get overloaded, the ecosystem could face such risks as bugs or 51% intentional attacks initiated by actors who advocate for a fork to protect their deposits. These risks include creating ETH/USD price oracles where ETH holders or validators could receive bribes to vote.\n\nAccording to Buterin, a case scenario where participants receive money to offer the wrong answer would cause honest people to lose money. In that case, Ethereum can only fork to recover users\u2019 funds, which is a high risk.\n\nHowever, while Buterin disagrees with price oracles, he acknowledged the need for better Oracles amid high bug risks. Buterin believes various problems are inherently different and should have unique approaches.\n\nButerin Advices Against Extending Ethereum Consensus Functionality\n\nOverall, Buterin\u2019s article kicks against the expansion of Ethereum consensus functionality as that would cause increased costs, complexities, and risks in running a validator.\n\nIn addition, he advises the community to be cautious of application-layer projects that may increase the scope of blockchain consensus outside core Ethereum protocol rules.\n\nHe urged the Ethereum community to preserve the blockchain\u2019s minimalism and support re-staking without slippery slopes that could extend the roles of Ethereum consensus. The founder asked users to help developers find alternative strategies to achieve their security goals.\n\nAfter transitioning from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake consensus last year, Ethereum recently witnessed the Shapella upgrade on April 12.\n\nThe upgrade commissioned a phased release of staked Ether, increasing activities and transactions on the network. That explains the increased concern for security and validator risks on the network.\n\nFeatured image from YouTube and chart from Tradingview"

        "title": "Ethereum Traders Scrambling For The Exits After Price Crash - Bitcoinist",
        "content": "Ethereum prices unexpectedly crashed on May 24, sending the coin below last week\u2019s lows towards the $1,800 psychological level.\n\nFollowing this dump, on-chain data from Coinanalyze reveals that there has been a sharp drop in open interest, suggesting that some traders were caught unaware and had to exit their positions.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Open Interest Dropping\n\nOn May 24, ETH\u2019s open interest stood at $5.2 billion across all major cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance and OKX. Out of this, $4.7 billion were from perpetual futures, while less than $450 million from futures.\n\n\n\nIn cryptocurrency derivatives trading, open interest is the total number of open positions. These positions can be long or short and drawn from perpetual futures and futures of leading platforms.\n\nBeing derivatives, open interest positions are often leveraged, meaning the trader borrows funds from the exchange to trade a bigger lot size. In this way, traders have to allocate collateral, which is margin, to fund the trade.\n\nDepending on the lot size of the trade and the leverage used, there can be \u201cmargin calls\u201d. Here, when the underlying asset\u2019s price moves against their predicated direction, the exchange can sell the collateral to protect itself if the trader doesn\u2019t top up their margin.\n\n\n\nOn May 24, ETH prices, aligning with the general trend across the crypto markets, fell roughly 5%, dropping from highs of $1,875 to as low as $1,775. This reversed gains of the past two weeks, forcing the coin lower in sync with losses from late April and early May 2023.\n\nAs a result of this correction, Coinalyze data shows that the open interest in Ethereum positions crashed by 7.3%.\n\nThere is now $5.2 billion worth of ETH derivatives positions, most of which is in Binance, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchange.\n\nBinance has $2.1 billion of ETH positions as of writing on May 24, while OKX and Bybit each have $1.1 billion and $1 billion, respectively.\n\nThere are roughly $189 million of ETH open positions on dYdX, a decentralized exchange (DEX).\n\nBased on available data, traders still prefer custodial cryptocurrency exchanges when trading ETH derivatives. There are non-custodial options like dYdX that are gaining momentum.\n\nMillions Worth Of ETH Longs Liquidated\n\nCoinalyze data also shows that only $18.7 million of \u201clong\u201d ETH positions have been liquidated by exchanges in the last 24 hours.\n\nIn total, there were $22.4 million in liquidations indicating that most traders were bullish, expecting prices to edge higher in the days ahead.\n\nEthereum prices are bearish, contracting in the past day and extending losses from late April when the coin soared to $2,100 despite positive on-chain data flow.\n\nAs of May 25, the total amount of ETH staked, securing the proof-of-stake network, is at record highs of over $41 billion.\n\nFeature Image From Canva, Chart From TradingView"

        "content": "Cardano co-founder Charles Hoskinson has made some comments on Twitter about Ethereum Classic (ETC), defining it as a scam.\n\nCardano\u2019s Charles Hoskinson calls the Ethereum Classic crypto project a scam\n\nDirectly on the social network of crypto-lovers, Twitter, Charles Hoskinson, co-founder of Cardano, said that the Ethereum Classic crypto project is now a scam.\n\nETC is now a scam and it's only purpose is for insiders to dump on those they recruit with blind hope of some magical future that will never come. There is no roadmap, innovation, team, or vision. It's just anger and toxicity. The Twitter account was built up from years of effort\u2026 \u2014 Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) May 19, 2023\n\nHoskinson\u2019s remarks come in response to the release of a new \u201cPoW Summit\u201d event to be presented in September in Prague by the Litecoin Foundation and the Ethereum Classic Cooperative.\n\nNot only that, Hoskinson also intervenes after Ergo\u2019s platform was mentioned in the comments, which was denied attendance by Bob Summerwill, executive director of the ETC Cooperative.\n\nApparently, Hoskinson\u2019s claims referring to ETC are indirectly aimed at Summerwill.\n\nThe founder of ADA thus called the ETC crypto project a scam, which allows participants to make money from those they recruit, and which now has no roadmap, innovation, or a single vision.\n\nMoreover, Hoskinson added that what moves ETC is just \u201canger and toxicity.\u201d\n\nCardano\u2019s Hoskinson and the rant against the Ethereum Classic project in favor of Ergo\n\nHoskinson\u2019s rant then also names Ergo, a next-generation PoW smart contract platform that enables new models of financial interaction.\n\nAnd indeed, in the eyes of Cardano\u2019s founder, Ergo is what Ethereum Classic should have been, with plenty of purpose, willingness to innovate, good ethical leadership, and with funding for the future.\n\nThus, who knows whether the present outburst was intended to make Ethereum Classic look bad, or also to highlight the Ergo crypto project.\n\nIn any case, at the PoW Summit in Prague, other big crypto industry names such as Charlie Shrem, Jameson Lopp, Litecoin founder Charlie Lee, and Caitlin Long of Custodia Bank will also be present.\n\nADA vs ETC\n\nTrying to compare the two crypto assets Cardano (ADA) and Ethereum Classic (ETC), here is the situation.\n\nCardano (ADA) ranks 7th in market capitalization, which currently exceeds $12.7 billion. Ethereum Classic (ETC), on the other hand, is in the 25th position, with a market cap of above $2.5 billion.\n\nAt the time of writing, the price of ADA is $0.37, a 6% drop from last month. ETC\u2019s price, on the other hand, is $18, with a 8% drop from last month.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that in terms of daily trading volume, ADA is trading for twice as much as ETC. And indeed, while ADA has a last 24-hour trading volume of nearly $150 million, ETC stands at $77.5 million."

        "content": "During the EDCON 2023 conference, Vitalik Buterin called the The Internet Computernetwork Ethereum\u2019s sister network refuting competition claims. In the world of blockchain technology and crypto, Ethereum has emerged as a prominent player, revolutionizing the way we think about decentralized applications and smart contracts.\n\nHowever, another platform has recently gained significant attention in the crypto community, positioning itself as Ethereum\u2019s sister network: the DFINITY project. DFINITY is a groundbreaking blockchain platform that aims to provide a highly scalable and efficient decentralized computing network. Created by a team of visionary developers, DFINITY offers a unique approach to blockchain technology.\n\nVitalik sees DFINITY as Ethereum\u2019s sister network rather than a competition\n\nEthereum and DFINITY both strive to create a decentralized future, empowering individuals and businesses with the ability to interact directly, securely, and without intermediaries. While Ethereum has established itself as a leader in the field, DFINITY aims to complement its capabilities by addressing some of the scalability challenges that Ethereum currently faces.\n\nWhen it comes to Layer 1s that allow smart contracts, Ethereum is without a doubt the most popular. With a market valuation of approximately 216 billion dollars and 70 billion dollars in multiple DeFi protocols, Ethereum\u2019s success has surely given door to many technical advances that other cryptocurrencies employ today.\n\nDFINITY, the future public blockchain-based cloud computing network that will seed a decentralized internet known as cloud 3.0. It is also completely compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and significantly reduces the cost of IT systems and business applications.\n\nIt\u2019s incredible that DFINITY\u2019s \u201cBlockchain Nervous System\u201d can mechanically adjust economic conditions as well as specific network settings to suit capacity needs. In brief, this network can evolve and address real-time issues, making it far more adaptable than present systems.\n\nDFINITY vs Ethereum VS\n\nEthereum is unquestionably the dominant decentralized public blockchain platform for running smart contracts. The Ethereum smart contract and EVM components added credibility to the technology. In addition, it possesses all the fundamental advantages that the conventional blockchain lacks. Here are the top 5 differences between Ethereum and Dfinity.\n\n1. On-chain governance VS off-chain governance \u2013 The The Internet Computer BNS is a built-in on-chain governance structure, whereas Ethereum discussions and decisions must be conducted off-chain.\n\n2. Proof of Stake (PoS) VS Proof of Work (PoW) \u2013 PoW is the requirement that block creators solve cryptographic riddles to earn the right to create a new block. PoS is a system that allows you to become the next bookmaker based on the stake fraction you own or deposit into the system.\n\nIn comparison to PoS, the PoW system requires more costly computations. Therefore, individuals produce evidence of their stake, which DFINITY will use. In certain circumstances, Ethereum uses both the PoW and the PoS. Note that Ethereum has transitioned to PoS.\n\n3. Security over Lifeness VS Lifeness over Security \u2013 Typically, DFINITY is so-called threshold groups, in which a random selection of 400 IDs manifest blocks and generate unique threshold signatures. When the threshold is not met, the entire system fails. In such circumstances, Ethereum takes a different approach using the proof of work architecture, which prioritizes life over security. The The Internet Computer, on the other hand, favors security over lifeness.\n\n4. Fixed-sized deposits VS variably sized deposits \u2013 There is a fixed sized deposit at DFINITY where the quantity of stake that you must deposit is fixed by the system and there is a requirement to create more than one ID. There are variously sized deposits in Ethereum where you can design the system with diverse affects.\n\nAs a result, in the never-ending war between The Internet Computer and Ethereum, both win according to different standards. It is also important to note that both are roughly equivalent in terms of their distinct individual characteristics.\n\n5. Actor model VS serialized contract execution \u2013 DFINITY, in general, follows the Actor Model because it allows for the execution of applications. This represents the fact that it provides both parallel contract execution and asynchronous message passing. On the other side, everything happens on Ethereum one after the other, and you need to store a lot of data in your memory, which puts a pressure on your machine\u2019s memory."
