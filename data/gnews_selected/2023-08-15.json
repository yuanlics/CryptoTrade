        "title": "The Rise of Bitcoin Spark: Is It The New Ethereum In The Making? - Benzinga",
        "content": "Bitcoin Spark is rapidly gaining traction in the crypto domain, challenging the dominance of established cryptocurrencies like Ethereum. This article explores the intricacies of Bitcoin Spark, its comparison with Ethereum, and the reasons behind its rising prominence.\n\nEthereum: A Brief Overview\n\nEthereum has long been a major player in the crypto world, known for its versatility and the unique functionalities it offers. It extends the blockchain applications beyond just cryptocurrency, enabling developers to build and deploy decentralized applications (dApps) powered by smart contracts. Ethereum's native token, ETH, facilitates transactions within these smart contracts and acts as a security measure against inefficient code and malicious activities.\n\nOn the contrary, Bitcoin's primary purpose has been as a digital currency and a store of value. Ethereum's broad application scope and dynamic platform have attracted a significant number of investors who see it as a promising avenue for long-term growth.\n\nBitcoin Spark: A New Contender\n\nBitcoin Spark, or BTCS, is a novel cryptocurrency project aiming to improve upon the limitations of Bitcoin and, in some aspects, Ethereum. It uses a radical blockchain technology known as Proof-Of-Process (PoP), which is a hybrid of Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS) models. This unique consensus model enhances the transaction capacity and reduces transaction fees, making BTCS more efficient for everyday transactions.\n\nMoreover, the Bitcoin Spark network includes a separate layer for smart contracts, which can use different programming languages. This layer reaches consensus on the main network but allows innovative dApps to be developed without causing transaction congestion.\n\nDeciphering Proof-of-Process\n\nThe PoP model is a novel concept introduced by Bitcoin Spark. It combines the principles of PoW and PoS with a unique algorithm that restricts linear rewards based on stake size or raw processing power. This innovative approach prevents the concentration of power among large-scale miners.\n\nBTCS mining requires an easy-to-use mining program that can be installed on any device. This program automatically limits the device's processing power usage, thereby controlling the mining capability. The rewards for miners are proportional to the processing power they rent out to the network, fostering a fair distribution of BTCS tokens.\n\nA New Era of Mining\n\nBitcoin Spark's mining approach is a significant departure from traditional methods. Bitcoin's PoW model involves solving complex mathematical problems using high-end computers, consuming a lot of energy. In contrast, Ethereum's PoS model requires participants to lock a certain amount of ETH to earn validation rights.\n\nBitcoin Spark, with its PoP model, simplifies this process. It allows users to mine using any device, making mining more accessible and promoting decentralization. This method also ensures a fair distribution of BTCS tokens regardless of the size of the stake or the computing power of the mining device.\n\nRewarding Network Participants\n\nBitcoin Spark has devised innovative ways to reward network participants. The primary source of revenue comes from a decentralized CPU rental system. Users pay with BTCS tokens to access processing power, which then goes into the mining rewards pool.\n\nThe project also earns revenue from advertising. Half of the revenue from advertisements on the Bitcoin Spark application and website is distributed among network participants and miners. The community actively polices the advertising content, ensuring a clean and trustworthy platform.\n\nBitcoin Spark's Tokenomics\n\nBitcoin Spark's tokenomics closely mirror that of Bitcoin, with a maximum supply of 21 million tokens. However, the time to reach this maximum supply is significantly longer for BTCS, allowing for a prolonged period of mining rewards distribution.\n\nDuring the ICO phase, BTCS was offered at $1.50, with an additional 20% bonus. This presented an excellent opportunity for investors to participate in the project's growth.\n\nThe Future of Bitcoin Spark\n\nBitcoin Spark's unique features and solutions looks to stir interest among investors and crypto enthusiasts. Its potential for disrupting the crypto space makes it an intriguing project to watch.\n\nWhile Ethereum continues to maintain its stronghold with its unique offerings, Bitcoin Spark is rapidly emerging as a strong contender. As both platforms continue to evolve, the competition for dominance in the crypto world is heating up.\n\nFind out more about Bitcoin Spark on:\n\nWebsite: https://bitcoinspark.org/\n\nBuy BTCS: https://network.bitcoinspark.org/register\n\nThis post was authored by an external contributor and does not represent Benzinga's opinions and has not been edited for content.

        "content": "Why are Ethereum Network Fees so High?: Learn more in this guide\n\n\u200dIf you have ever found yourself scratching your head, wondering why a minor transaction on the Ethereum blockchain leaves your wallet considerably lighter, then you\u2019re not alone.\n\nWith the ever-increasing traffic on the Ethereum blockchain, transaction fees have skyrocketed, leaving many to ponder whether using the network is worth it.\n\nIn this article, we will address why Ethereum network fees are so high, explore the factors contributing to these high fees, and provide practical tips on reducing and avoiding them.\n\nSo buckle up, because today we will unravel some useful information on Ethereum and its fees!\n\nAlso read: Ethereum Is Turning Deflationary, But Price Remains Stagnant\n\nA Quick Look at Ethereum\n\nEthereum\u2019s debut in cryptocurrency was a turning point for the entire blockchain industry. It was the first blockchain to challenge and match the dominance of the Bitcoin network.\n\nEthereum is a decentralized platform that allows developers to create, publish, and distribute applications and smart contracts.\n\nWith its innovative features and services, and a community-run ecosystem that supports thousands of decentralized applications, it quickly gained popularity among investors and users worldwide.\n\nPerhaps its most notable feature is the ability to deploy smart contracts, which accelerated the development of the crypto industry.\n\nAlso read: Ethereum Investors Await Rally as Addresses in Profits Hit Monthly Low\n\nUnderstanding Ethereum Transaction Fees\n\nTransaction fees, or gas fees, are incurred when executing a transaction on the Ethereum network.\n\nEvery network action, whether sending Ether (ETH) or interacting with a smart contract, requires computational power. Miners, who validate transactions and maintain the network, are compensated with gas fees for their efforts.\n\nGas fees are denominated in Gwei, a tiny fraction of an ETH.\n\nOne Gwei is equivalent to 0.000000001 ETH. When you initiate a transaction, you specify a gas limit, the maximum amount of computational work you are willing to pay for.\n\nAdditionally, you set a gas price, the amount of Gwei you are willing to pay per unit of gas. The total transaction fee is calculated by multiplying the gas limit by the gas price.\n\nFactors Contributing to High Ethereum Fees\n\nSource: CNN\n\nSeveral factors have contributed to the high fees on the Ethereum network:\n\n1. Network Congestion\n\nAs the popularity of Ethereum has soared, the number of transactions on the network has increased dramatically. This surge in demand has led to network congestion, causing delays and driving up transaction fees.\n\nDuring peak hours, when the network is crowded with users, gas prices tend to skyrocket as users compete to process their transactions.\n\n2. Gas Limit and Gas Price\n\nThe gas limit and gas price you set for your transactions can significantly impact the fees you pay. You will pay more for your transactions if you set a high gas limit or a high gas price.\n\nFinding a balance and optimizing these parameters to minimize fees while ensuring your transactions are processed promptly is important.\n\n3. Smart Contract Complexity\n\nThe complexity of smart contracts also plays a role in determining transaction fees. More complex smart contracts require more computational resources, resulting in higher gas fees.\n\nAs decentralized applications (dApps) and their functionalities become more intricate, the network experiences increased congestion, leading to higher gas prices.\n\n4. Ethereum Network Upgrades\n\nThe Ethereum network has undergone several upgrades to improve scalability and address the issue of high fees. One such upgrade is EIP-1559, which introduced a base fee mechanism to make gas prices more predictable and reduce fee volatility.\n\nHowever, these upgrades take time to implement and may not immediately alleviate the problem of high fees.\n\nHow to Reduce and Avoid High Ethereum Fees\n\nSource: CNBC\n\nNow that we understand the factors contributing to high Ethereum fees let\u2019s explore some practical tips to reduce and avoid them:\n\n1. Optimize Gas Limit and Gas Price\n\nTo minimize transaction fees, optimizing the gas limit and gas price for each transaction is crucial.\n\nTo decrease fees, you can set a lower gas limit and gas price, but avoid setting them too low to prevent transaction delays.\n\nExperiment with different values and find the optimal cost and transaction speed balance.\n\n2. Use Layer-2 Scaling Solutions\n\nLayer-2 scaling solutions encompass technologies constructed on the Ethereum network to boost transaction throughput and cut fees.\n\nThese solutions, such as Optimistic Rollups and zkSync, process transactions off-chain or more optimally, alleviating the burden on the Ethereum mainnet. By utilizing layer-2 solutions, you can benefit from faster and cheaper transactions.\n\n3. Choose Off-Peak Times\n\nGas fees tend to be lower during off-peak times with less network congestion.\n\nYou can take advantage of lower fees by scheduling your transactions during these periods, such as late at night or on weekends.\n\nMonitoring gas price charts or using tools like Gas Now can help you identify the optimal transaction times.\n\n4. Consider Gas Tokens\n\nGas tokens, such as CHI or GST2, allow you to pre-purchase gas at a lower price and use it to pay transaction fees in the future.\n\nYou can effectively reduce your overall gas costs by acquiring gas tokens when gas prices are low and redeeming them when fees are high.\n\nHowever, remember that gas tokens might have limitations and some wallets and platforms might not support them.\n\n5. Choose the Priority Fee Option\n\nSome wallets and platforms offer a priority fee option that allows you to pay a slightly higher fee to process your transaction faster. If time is of the essence, opting for a priority fee can ensure your transaction is prioritized by miners and confirmed more quickly.\n\nSource: Comparic\n\n6. Explore Alternative Blockchains\n\nIf high Ethereum fees persist or if you require faster and cheaper transactions, consider exploring alternative blockchains.\n\nBlockchains like Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, and Solana offer lower fees and faster transaction speeds.\n\nHowever, keep in mind that these blockchains may have different functionalities and may not support all Ethereum-based tokens and applications.\n\n7. Stay Informed and Adapt\n\nThe Ethereum network keeps evolving, and developers are actively creating new solutions to tackle high fees.\n\nStay informed about network upgrades, improvements, and emerging technologies that aim to reduce fees. B\n\ny adapting to the changing landscape, you can leverage the latest tools and innovations to minimize your transaction costs.\n\nConclusion\n\nHigh Ethereum network fees can be a barrier for users looking to transact on the blockchain. However, by understanding the factors contributing to these fees and implementing the tips mentioned above, you can reduce and avoid high fees on the Ethereum network.\n\nRemember to optimize your gas limit and gas price, explore layer-2 scaling solutions, transact during off-peak times, consider gas tokens, choose priority fees when necessary, explore alternative blockchains, and stay informed about advancements in the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nWith these strategies, you can navigate the world of Ethereum transactions more cost-effectively.\n\nDisclaimer: The information provided in this article is for informational purposes only and should not be considered financial or investment advice.
