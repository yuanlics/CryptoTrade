        "title": "Ethereum Uptober on Hold Despite ETH Futures Launch: Is $2000 Possible? - CCN.com",
        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nETH ETF launch was unsuccessful as low trading volume\n\nPrice makes a downturn, decreasing by 6.7%.\n\nChart analysis shows bearish signs.\n\nOn Monday, September 2, three U.S. investment firms, ProShares, VanEck, and Bitwise Asset Management, introduced futures-based ETFs linked to Ether, the world\u2019s second most valuable cryptocurrency. These six newly launched funds offered investors their first opportunity to invest in Ether-based exchange-traded products.\n\nHowever, the launch of these ETFs didn\u2019t seem to generate significant investor interest, and the ETH spot price has declined by 6.77% since then. While these ETH futures ETFs were expected to fuel a substantial price increase, they instead had a negative impact on the price.\n\nNevertheless, ETH has been in an uptrend since September 11. So, was this decline just a minor setback with $2,000 in its sights, or is it an early indicator that it lacks the strength to sustain its upward trajectory?\n\nETH Futures ETF\u2019s botch\n\nOn the debut day, the combined trading volumes of these ETFs reached $1.92 million. Notably, the ProShares Ether Strategy ETF had the highest trading volume at $878,560, according to data from LSEG .\n\nIn an informative X thread , Vetle Lunde, a Senior Analyst at K33Research, shared some statistics about the underwhelming launch day for futures-based ETH ETFs.\n\nHe focused on trading volumes and made comparisons with similar product launches, particularly BITI and BITO, which are ProShares Bitcoin ETF products.\n\nIn his initial chart, he highlighted that ProShares dominated the trading volume, accounting for the majority of the first-day trading volume, which totaled $1.96 million across EETH (Ether Strategy ETF) and BETE (Bitcoin & Ether Equal Weight Strategy ETF). VanEck\u2019s EFUT, which launched slightly ahead of its competitors, followed suit.\n\nIn his following chart, Vetle Lunde compared the day-one volumes of ETH ETFs with ProShares\u2019 Bitcoin Future ETF products. The initial volumes for the ETH ETFs were considerably lower than those of BITO ($1.01B) and BITI ($7.21M) at their respective launches. The ETH ETFs\u2019 day-one volumes represented only 0.19% of BITO\u2019s launch volume and 27% of BITI\u2019s launch volume.\n\nIn summary, he acknowledged the differences in market conditions during the BITO and BITI launches but still characterized the launch of ETH ETFs as uneventful.\n\nETH Price Analysis\n\nIn our previous analysis of ETH, we discussed the macro view, highlighting two potential scenarios. One possibility was that the price had initiated a new uptrend by breaking out from the descending resistance level.\n\nThe alternative scenario considered the increase from September 11 as a corrective move, suggesting that a new downturn might commence as the price faced rejection at the $1,760 resistance level.\n\nToday, we witnessed a 6.7% decline, measuring from yesterday\u2019s high to today\u2019s lowest point of $1,641. To support a potential move towards $2,000, the price needs to form a complete five-wave pattern starting from September 11.\n\nDespite briefly achieving a higher high yesterday, it faced a sharp rejection and is currently testing the September 18 high, which is considered to be the first wave of this pattern.\n\nCurrent Pattern May Be Invalid\n\nAccording to the Elliott Wave theory, it appears that the current pattern may be invalid. First, the assumed wave 3 fell slightly short of its optimum length, but it is still somewhat longer than wave 1, which adheres to Elliott Wave rules.\n\nWave 4 is typically a consolidative correction, often observed as a sideways movement and should not overlap with wave 2 territory. While it did produce a minor wick on the 4-hour chart, the candle close remained above wave 2. However, given that all three rules are currently stretched, it increasingly resembles a corrective move from September 11.\n\nThis could suggest that another downward trend has begun, with the price of ETH potentially heading below its September 11 low and below $1,500. The key determinant of the future outlook is how the price behaves around the $1,660 level. If it manages to stay above and starts moving upward, it could signal the start of an impulse wave.\n\nOn the other hand, if the descending move continues, it would indicate that sellers have regained control, potentially leading to a lower low.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nPlease note that the contents of this article are not financial or investing advice.

This was a pale shadow of the $1bn of assets that the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) garnered on its first two days of trading in October 2021 when it became the first US ETF trading in futures contracts linked to bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency.\n\n\u201cThe ether futures ETFs opened to a rather tame start on Monday. Total trading volume was $6.6mn which was a disappointing start,\u201d said Gautam Chhugani, senior analyst, global digital assets at Bernstein, who believed media attention was focused on the impending trial of FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried in New York.\n\nChhugani believed the lacklustre launch was \u201cnot surprising, given the continued weak retail sentiment\u201d towards cryptocurrencies, whereas BITO launched at the peak of a digital bull market.\n\n\u201cLike any listed security, success or failure cannot be measured on the first days of trading with market sentiment and the macro environment all having a bearing on performance,\u201d said Bradley Duke, chief strategist at ETC Group, a provider of crypto exchange traded products.\n\nDespite rallying 10 per cent last week in anticipation of the wave of launches, the price of ether is still down 64 per cent from its peak in November 2021.\n\nIt fell 4 per cent to $1,663 on Monday as the launches underwhelmed \u2014 although as the ETFs are futures products, rather than investing in the \u201cphysical\u201d spot cryptocurrency, purchases do not have any direct impact on the price.\n\nBitcoin is also down by 57 per cent from the highs it briefly touched in November 2021 as cryptocurrencies have proved to be procyclical \u201chigh beta\u201d assets.\n\nThe bulk of the trading that did take place was in the pre-existing Valkyrie Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BTF), which changed its name to add \u201cand Ether\u201d on Tuesday, when it broadened out to incorporate both cryptocurrencies.\n\nBTF traded $4.6mn, according to Bernstein. The liveliest of the newly launched ETFs was the ProShares Ether Strategy ETF (EETH), which saw turnover of $879,000, ahead of the VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF (EFUT), at $516,000.\n\nNevertheless, Chhugani argued that, if and when more retail investors do return to crypto there will be \u201cwide availability of fair, secure and regulated products that help them attain crypto exposure without worrying about losing their savings from fraudulent exchanges\u201d.\n\nDave Weisberger, chief executive and co-founder of CoinRoutes, an algorithmic trading platform for the digital asset industry, believed the funds would be popular with financial advisers, who cannot invest client money in crypto itself, but can do so via ETFs.\n\nEther is reasonably popular in Europe, where ETPs investing in both crypto futures and the physical spot currencies are permitted in many jurisdictions. The 13 pure ether ETPs available on the continent have combined assets of \u20ac1.1bn, according to data from TrackInsight, compared to \u20ac2.6bn in 20 bitcoin ETPs.\n\nOverall, ether has a market capitalisation of $200bn, compared to $535bn for bitcoin and $83bn for tether, the third-largest cryptocurrency.\n\nThe launches come as the US ETF industry remains barred from what is sees as the crown jewel of the crypto firmament \u2014 spot bitcoin funds.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission has refused to allow the launch of spot bitcoin ETFs, citing fears of fraud and manipulation on the unregulated exchanges on which the digital tokens trade, concerns that it does not have about futures contracts listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, a regulated venue.\n\nThe SEC has thus far maintained this stance despite losing a court case to crypto manager Grayscale, which sued over the regulator\u2019s refusal to let it convert its $17.4bn Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), a private fund, into an ETF, in August.\n\nAfter that defeat, one school of thought was that the SEC might satisfy the court\u2019s ruling \u2014 and equalise its treatment of spot and futures bitcoin ETFs \u2014 by retroactively axing BITO and its sister bitcoin futures ETFs.\n\nThe regulator\u2019s willingness to allow ether futures ETFs would appear to have put that idea to bed.\n\nAlongside Grayscale, 10 other managers, including BlackRock, Fidelity, Ark Invest, WisdomTree, VanEck and Valkyrie, have outstanding filings in place to launch spot bitcoin ETFs.\n\nChhugani believed a \u201cdistinct shift\u201d was now evident in the SEC\u2019s stance towards crypto ETFs, with applicants \u201cseeing a more engaged SEC being responsive, unlike the past\u201d.\n\nHe believed the first such bitcoin ETFs would be approved sometime around early January.\n\nSpot ether ETFs may follow not long after, with Ark and VanEck among the groups to have filed to launch products. Grayscale has also filed to convert its existing $5bn Ethereum Trust (ETHE) into an ETF.\n\n\u201cWhat is clear is that, like bitcoin, the listing of these ethereum futures ETFs is ultimately paving the way for a spot ethereum ETF in the US,\u201d said Duke."
