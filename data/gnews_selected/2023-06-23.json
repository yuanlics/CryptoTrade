        "title": "Casa launches multisignature Ethereum self-custody vault - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Cryptocurrency self-custody platform Casa has rolled out support for Ether (ETH) storage, touting its support for multisignature Bitcoin (BTC) and ETH self-storage as a first in the industry.\n\nSince its inception in 2016, Casa has promoted multisignature self-custody in the crypto industry. Its flagship Bitcoin vault allows users to store the cryptocurrency using up to five keys for more distributed security.\n\nCasa\u2019s service originally catered to Bitcoin \u201cwhales\u201d willing to spend $10,000 a year on custody before opening its service to a broader base of users. The company has now added an Ether vault to its platform, with ETH holders also able to use up to five keys to secure their holdings.\n\nAccording to Casa CEO Nick Neuman, with Bitcoin and Ethereum operating as entirely different protocols, the industry had not yet built a security solution that accommodates both on the same platform, aside from various hardware wallet models.\n\nThe firm is also engaging with users over the potential of adding self-custody support for various ETH-related assets, including nonfungible tokens, stablecoins and ERC-20 tokens.\n\nAs Cointelegraph previously reported, Casa co-founder and chief technical officer Jameson Lopp highlighted increasing calls for a multisignature ETH self-custody from its users and the wider cryptocurrency community.\n\nCasa announced its intent to launch an ETH storage solution amid several high-profile collapses of custodians like FTX, as many users not only lost access to ETH, but also to their Ethereum-based stablecoins and other ERC tokens.\n\nRelated: Ledger CEO says crypto key recovery service makes self-custody easier\n\nHackers also wrought havoc within the Web3 space in 2022, with billions of dollars stolen through decentralized finance bridge hacks and smart contract exploits. It\u2019s a point Neuman highlighted when Casa announced its plans for ETH storage on its platform, with many hacks across the \u201cWeb3/crypto space due to poor private key management.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with Cointelegraph journalist Joe Hall, cypherpunk Jameson Lopp stressed the importance of making self-custody solutions more accessible and easier to give users complete control of their assets and peace of mind managing the associated responsibilities.\n\nIndustry experts have also suggested that its difficult to estimate the amount of BTC currently held in self-custody wallets.\n\nMagazine: Ordinals turned Bitcoin into a worse version of Ethereum: Can we fix it?"

        "title": "Ethereum Rainbow chart sets ETH price for Jan 1, 2024 - Finbold - Finance in Bold",
        "content": "Although Ethereum (ETH) has been struggling to regain the psychological threshold of $2,000 despite the recent positive momentum on the wider cryptocurrency market, its outlook might not look as bearish by the year\u2019s turn if BlockchainCenter\u2019s rainbow price chart for Ethereum is any indicator.\n\nSpecifically, some crypto traders and investors use Ethereum\u2019s rainbow chart to observe the historical movements of the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization in relation to various moving averages (MAs) and find patterns that could help them make better investment decisions.\n\nAs it happens, this chart suggests that Ethereum is currently still in the \u2018Fire Sale\u2019 phase, indicated by the color purple, and ranges between $0 and $2,593, below the \u2018Undervalued\u2019 blue zone between $2,593 and $3,668, as per data seen by Finbold on June 23.\n\nEthereum rainbow price chart. Source: BlockchainCenter\n\nProjection for January 1, 2024\n\nSpecifically, Ethereum has been stuck in the \u2018Fire Sale\u2019 area since early October 2022, which, judging by the previous behavior, it might get out of in a matter of weeks, as the same had happened in July 20202, when ETH moved into the \u2018Undervalued\u2019 zone after a period of eight months in the \u2018Fire Sale.\u2019\n\nFurther crunching the numbers, it took Ethereum 10 months to peak at the \u2018But have we *earned* it?\u2019 level at $4,336. If the same trend occurs this time around, it would mean that the crypto asset would end up in the same zone \u2013 currently between $16,353 \u2013 $23,742, by April 2024.\n\nIn other words, seven months from now, around January 1, 2024, Ethereum could be changing hands in the \u2018Still cheap\u2019 price area on the rainbow chart, which currently stands between $5,290 and $7,705, taking into consideration the exact same pattern.\n\nBefore that action, Ethereum was in the \u2018Fire Sale\u2019 area only one time \u2013 in October 2015 \u2013 soaring to the \u2018Go back to BTC?\u2019 price level four months later, followed by a subsequent drop to the \u2018Undervalued\u2019 zone in January 2017, where it stuck around very shortly until moving up again and beyond the \u2018Maximum Bubble Territory.\u2019\n\nShould this pattern repeat itself instead, it would mean that Ethereum could skyrocket to the \u2018Go back to BTC?\u2019 area in October 2023, at a price between $23,742 and $34,283, before dropping to the \u2018Undervalued\u2019 zone at $2,593 and $3,668 once again in January 2024.\n\nAlternatively, another Ethereum Rainbow Chart tool developed by CoinCodex estimates that under the same scenario, the asset\u2019s price would hover around $778 per token if ETH remained inside the \u2018Undervalued\u2019 (or \u2018BUY!\u2019) zone in January 2024.\n\nEthereum rainbow price chart. Source: CoinCodex.com\n\nEthereum price analysis\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum was at press time changing hands at the price of $1,872.40, recording a decline of 1.31% on the day but still an increase of 12.48% across the previous week and a 3.21% gain on its monthly chart, as per the latest data.\n\nEthereum 30-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nAll things considered, whether Ethereum moves in either of the two rainbow chart patterns will depend on further developments surrounding the Ethereum network, as well as the overall sentiment on the general crypto and macroeconomic landscape.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "title": "Bitcoin ETFs are all the rage \u2014 why not Ethereum? - Blockworks",
        "content": "As optimism grows regarding the potential approval of a bitcoin ETF in the United States, industry watchers suggest that fund issuers may soon apply to launch products holding crypto\u2019s second-largest asset.\n\nYet the fate of such yet-to-be-filed ether funds would likely hinge on how the SEC treats the latest wave of filings from spot bitcoin ETF hopefuls.\n\nThe recent effort by asset management titan BlackRock to launch an ETF that would hold bitcoin directly has reinvigorated a decade-long attempt by a range of firms to get such an offering past the SEC.\n\nThe $9 trillion asset manager\u2019s filing was followed by renewed attempts by Bitwise, WisdomTree, Invesco and Valkyrie to launch similar products.\n\nThe latest rush of spot bitcoin ETF proposals indicates prospective issuers believe \u201cnow is the time,\u201d according to Neena Mishra, director of ETF research at Zacks Investment Research.\n\n\u201cI would not be surprised to see an application to launch a spot ether ETF in the coming weeks,\u201d she told Blockworks. \u201cIf one issuer starts the process, others would quickly join the race, not wanting to be left behind.\u201d\n\nBut Townsend Lansing, head of product at crypto asset manager CoinShares, said ether ETF filings likely don\u2019t make much sense right now \u2014 beyond being a publicity stunt.\n\n\u201cThe SEC would react the same way it has reacted to all the BTC filings,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would analyze the filing, seek public comments, look at the underlying market and presumably reject it for a failure to evidence a proper surveillance-sharing agreement.\u201d\n\nRead more: How \u2018surveillance-sharing\u2019 is designed to deter bitcoin ETF manipulation\n\nBut a spot bitcoin ETF approval would further add interest from fund issuers to try ether (ETH) next, some said.\n\n\u201cIt would indicate that the new proposed surveillance arrangement is enough to address their concerns and the same would apply to the second largest cryptocurrency,\u201d Mishra said.\n\nLansing agreed, in the case of the SEC greenlighting a spot bitcoin ETF, that fund issuers looking to launch an ether ETF next is \u201ca reasonable assumption.\u201d\n\nBut the potential for such a product to be approved would depend on the SEC\u2019s reasoning for permitting a spot bitcoin ETF, \u201cand the extent to which the ether market exhibits similar characteristics,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cDespite the recent press and surge of filings, we continue to believe approval of any spot crypto ETF remains a difficult proposition,\u201d Lansing said.\n\nAndra Nicolau, head of business development and strategy at Origin Protocol, believes that it might still be premature to expect a spot ether ETF based on the demand for such a product.\n\nShe noted that institutional investors who hold bitcoin understand the asset\u2019s scarcity and the need for it as a store of value amid inflation.\n\n\u201cEthereum is better understood by those who understand technology and rebuilding the internet from the ground up,\u201d Nicolau said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean that ETH is not ETF worthy. It just means it may take a little while longer.\u201d\n\nAn ether futures ETF first?\n\nThe SEC greenlit bitcoin futures ETFs in 2021 after Chair Gary Gensler said earlier that year the regulator would prefer reviewing filings limited to such contracts traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME).\n\nBitcoin futures are cash-settled and are regulated by the CFTC \u2014 attributes some have said offer the SEC an additional layer of comfort.\n\nGrayscale Investments and Bitwise were among several firms in May to file for ETFs that would hold ether futures contracts. But these firms quickly halted plans to do so.\n\nTwo sources directly familiar with the matter told Blockworks those moves came after the SEC asked the firms to pull the plans \u2014 telling them the regulator is not yet ready to approve such products. A spokesperson for the regulator did not return a request for comment at the time.\n\nIndustry participants have labeled concerns around current ether futures liquidity levels, as well as a lack of clarity on whether ether is considered a security or a commodity, as possible rationales.\n\nBut concerns over the liquidity of the ether futures market would not apply to spot ether ETFs, Mishra argued.\n\n\u201cThe approval of a spot bitcoin ETF would mean that the SEC\u2019s main concerns regarding fraud and manipulation, which many thought were inconsistent, have been addressed,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think there would be any need for the agency to experiment with a futures-based ether ETF first.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."
