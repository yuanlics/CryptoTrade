        "content": "Blockchain sleuths have flagged the transfer of $1 million of Ether (ETH) belonging to a wallet controlled by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin as cryptocurrency markets remain depressed after widespread weekend losses.\n\nThe publicly labeled Ethereum wallet address vitalik.eth transferred 600 ETH on Aug. 21, with the address still holding over 3,900 ETH valued at $6.5 million as per data from Etherscan.\n\nBlockchain data analysis from Lookonchain also revealed that vitalik.eth repaid 251,000 Rai Reflex Index (RAI) tokens on Maker and withdrew 1,000 ETH, worth $1,67 million, hours before the movement of ETH to Coinbase.\n\nCointelegraph also had confirmation from blockchain analytics firm Nansen that Buterin had transfered the large sum after a test transaction of 0.1 ETH two days prior, while their analysts noted that the exchange Buterin used in the latest movement differed from previous instances on record:\n\n\"Based on the wallet\u2019s history, ETH transfers in the past have typically been to Kraken. However, it\u2019s hard to say what\u2019s the purpose of the transfer so we aren\u2019t able to offer much more insight.\"\n\nA number of prominent blockchain data aggregators and publications shared insights into the transfer of 600 ETH to United States-based cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase. The move caused a stir on social media in the hours after the transfer, with speculation around the transaction rife.\n\nButerin\u2019s transaction comes as wider cryptocurrency markets remain fragile following a sharp correction over the weekend. Bitcoin (BTC) and ETH saw losses of 11% and 8%, respectively.\n\nRelated: Vitalik dumps $700K worth of shitcoins that he never asked for\n\nAs Cointelegraph has previously reported, Buterin has admitted to selling portions of his ETH holdings on separate occasions over the past five years and has also publicly dumped tokens he has received in unsolicited alt coin airdrops.\n\nCollect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space.\n\nMagazine: Deposit risk: What do crypto exchanges really do with your money?"

        "content": "Activity across Layer 2 networks is booming, with combined L2 throughput outpacing the Ethereum mainnet by 400%.\n\nThe weekly average scaling throughput of Ethereum\u2019s Layer 2 ecosystem surpassed 50 transactions per second (TPS) for the first time on Aug 15, hitting an all-time high of 50.83 TPS two days later, according to L2beat.\n\nEthereum Layer 2 Throughput Hits Record High\n\nThe milestone comes as zkSync Era has overtaken the Ethereum mainnet, with daily activity sitting at 12.2 TPS compared to 10.9 TPSfor Ethereum. Era processed a record high 13.44 TPS on Aug. 19.\n\nEmerging Layer 2 Networks\n\nA new breed of L2s is challenging the dominance of incumbents Arbitrum and Optimism.\n\nBase, the freshly launched L2 from the top U.S. exchange, Coinbase, is the second-most active layer 2 with 9.93 TPS after growing 50% over the past week. Activity on Base has been buoyed by the surging popularity of friend.tech, an app allowing users to trade tokens associated with public Twitter profiles.\n\nArbitrum ranks third with 6.2 TPS, followed by Starknet with 4.8 TPS, and Optimism with 4.2 TPS.\n\nHowever, Arbitrum and Optimism still command more than 80% of the nearly $10B in total value locked in Layer 2s, with $5.6B and $2.6B, respectively. zkSync comes in third with $408M, followed by dYdX with $339M, and Base with $237M.\n\nArbitrum Grants Program\n\nFacing new competition, the Arbitrum Foundation responded by launching its first grants program last month. The foundation said the new initiative is not intended to replace the grants programs operated by the Arbitrum DAO.\n\nThe first round of Foundation Grants will distribute funding to \u201cdecentralized applications and infrastructure\u201d for both its flagship Arbitrum One and gaming-focused Arbitrum Nova networks. The categories include DeFi, gaming, NFT, social dApps, or user interface tooling and backend application infrastructure.\n\nThe foundation will progressively distribute funding based on key performance indicators and other milestones arranged with each applicant individually.\n\n\u201cAll grants issued through this program will serve to improve adoption, create stronger technical structures, and build amazing sustainable communities,\u201d said the Arbitrum Foundation.\n\nRead the original post on The Defiant"

        "content": "Ethereum price is attempting a recovery wave above the $1,620 level against the US Dollar. ETH could start a fresh decline if it stays below the 100 hourly SMA.\n\nEthereum is struggling to recover above the $1,690 and $1,700 levels.\n\nThe price is trading below $1,700 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere was a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance near $1,670 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair could resume its decline if it stays below the $1,700 level in the near term.\n\nEthereum Price Faces Hurdles\n\nEthereum\u2019s price declined heavily below the $1,700 level. ETH tested the $1,520 zone and recently started a decent recovery wave, similar to Bitcoin.\n\nThere was a move above the $1,550 and $1,600 levels. The price climbed above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1,825 swing high to the $1,518 low. Besides, there was a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance near $1,670 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.\n\nHowever, the bears are still active below the $1,680 level. Ether is also trading below $1,700 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $1,690 level. The next resistance is near $1,700 or the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nThe 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1,825 swing high to the $1,518 low is also near the $1,700 zone. A close above the $1,700 level could start a decent increase in the near term. The next major resistance is near the $1,750 level. Any more gains might send the price toward the $1,820 resistance, above which the price could rise toward the $1,880 zone.\n\nFresh Decline in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $1,700 resistance, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,640 level.\n\nThe first major support is near the $1,600 zone. If the bulls fail to protect the $1,600 support, there could be more losses. The next major support is near the $1,550 support level. Any more losses might send the price toward the $1,520 level in the near term.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bearish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now near the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $1,600\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $1,700\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin moved 600 ETH to Coinbase\n\nHis action follows a general market downturn as Ether\u2019s value dropped by 10%\n\nETH price usually drops after a transfer by Buterin or the Ethereum Foundation\n\nThere is a chance that Buterin will attempt a significant sell off\n\nOn-chain data and blockchain security platform PeckShield showed that a wallet related to an Ethereum (ETH) co-founder Vitalik Buterin transmitted 600 ETH, worth $1 million, to Coinbase earlier today, August 21.\n\nThe reason for the transaction is still unknown, but transfers to exchange are typically understood to indicate a desire to sell.\n\nButerin\u2019s transaction may increase selling pressure on Ethereum, whose price has recently declined.\n\nOn-chain detective Lookonchain revealed that on August 20, Vitalik.eth wallet withdrew 1,000 ETH \u2013 about $1.67 million \u2013 and refunded 251,000 RAI on the DeFi platform Maker.\n\nDubbed \u201cvitalik.eth\u201d wallet, which contains 3,993 ETH valued at $6.5 million as of publication time, was made seven years ago. According to the Arkham Intelligence dashboard , this wallet belonged to the co-founder of Ethereum.\n\nThere are also $84,000 worth of USD Coin (USDC) and $58,000 worth of Wrapped Ethereum (WETH) in the wallet.\n\nButerin has previously transferred assets to a cryptocurrency exchange as he sent 200 ETH to Kraken in March. Buterin also sold a number of unwanted altcoins (sh*tcoins) for 439.25 ETH.\n\nButerin\u2019s Transaction Coincides with Crypto Market\u2019s Recent Decline\n\nButerin\u2019s move followed last week\u2019s (August 17) flash fall in the cryptocurrency market, when the price of ETH dropped below $1700 for the first time since June and it\u2019s still trading below that threshold.\n\nData from the blockchain analysis company Glassnode show that Ethereum owners fiercely hold their positions even as they quickly transfer assets among cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nThe data aggregator reports that 14.88 million ETH are currently held on exchanges, a figure not seen since 2018.\n\nExchange outflows are typically interpreted as a positive sign that the asset is being retained for the long term.\n\n\u201cEthereum\u2019s Transitions Vital For Success\u201d \u2013 Buterin\n\nIn June, Buterin explained that the Ethereum blockchain \u201cfails\u201d outright in the absence of an adequate scaling infrastructure to lower transaction costs.\n\n\u201cEthereum fails because each transaction costs $3.75 ($82.48 if we have another bull run) and every product aiming for the mass market inevitably forgets about the chain and adopts centralized workarounds for everything,\u201d he claimed .\n\nButerin then said that smart contract wallets represent another area of failure.\n\nHe explained that switching to smart contract wallets had certain drawbacks because managing several addresses at once presents challenges from the user experience perspective.\n\nTo effectively shift into an on-chain world with zero-knowledge rollups, Buterin said that wallets would need to secure data in addition to cryptographic assets.\n\n\u201cIn a ZK world, this is no longer true: the wallet is not just protecting authentication credentials, it\u2019s also holding your data,\u201d he added .\n\nFor the third and final shift, privacy, new identification, reputation, and social recovery mechanisms will be required.\n\nWithout the third shift, he claimed , \u201cEthereum fails because making all transactions (and POAPs, etc.) publicly visible for anyone to see is far too high a privacy sacrifice for many users and everyone moves onto centralized solutions that at least somewhat hide your data.\u201d\n\nEthereum\u2019s co-founder proposed using stealth addresses to alleviate this problem.\n\nA Turning Point for ETH\n\nEthereum is at a turning moment because the chart structure is so fragile. ETH price is expected to drop sharply if it brokes through the $1,600\u2013$1,550 level.\n\nThe monthly average of Ethereum ($ETH) addresses that are currently active is lower than the annual average, indicating little on-chain activity.\n\nAccording to CoinMarketCap , at the time of writing, ETH was trading at $1,667.56, that represents a 0.36% fall over the last 24 hours."

        "title": "Why Did Ethereum Co-Founder Vitalik Buterin Send $1M Worth of Ether to Coinbase? - CoinDesk",
        "content": "Vital has moved some Ethereum about a $1 million worth Ethereum to coin base. What does this mean? Well, might indicate that he's willing to sell a little bit. He moved about 600 to coin base over the weekend. Vitals, public addresses for his Ethereum holdings are out there. Most people know where they are. They're visible on most uh either scans or like Blockchain explorers out there. And for good reason, right? He's probably the most central figure head in all crypto because he's uh the front man or the image of Ethereum ecosystem, which is the largest smart contract ecosystem and the second largest coin by market cap behind Bitcoin. So when people see vital or anyone else moving money uh with that big of a name out there, they start paying attention. Of course, we don't know if he sold this Ethereum and we also don't know the reasons behind it. Maybe he just wanted to get some more cushion for uh his US D bank account. Who knows Zach? I'll throw this one up to you. I don't look at this story and be like, oh, this is like a, a big ominous bad dark cloud story. I just think our boy is, you know, he's traveling all over around the world, he needs some money. Hey, man, I'm with you. I think big picture like this is the funny thing about crypto, right? You get to watch this stuff happen, you just get to see it. You're like, oh we know that this is a wallet associative of tal and you know, he chose to keep that in the public domain essentially. And now we can sort of see the the flows of money across uh the world into these exchange addresses, right? So it is just kind of a funny feature of crypto and I never, it never, it never gets dull to me that we can have these conversations based on, on chain activity and unchain activity alone, right? We don't know his intent. We don't know why we don't know what's, what's happening. We just know that we can watch this thing move from point A to point B and deduce, maybe that there's something uh animating that, right? And I think that's a really funny feature of crypto that we can talk about these things. Um without any other knowledge, aside from the fact that we just know one wallet interacted with another, and therefore we know this one happens to be vital and we can speculate on whatever the million dollars is gonna be for if it's for, you know, I don't know, getting more travel luggage. So he can go to different places around the world or not. But, yeah, I don't know. There's not much to say here. I don't know, is gonna, like, change people's price project like projections for Ethereum. Right? Or if it change, I don't think this indicates that like, vital is any less bullish on his creation. But it is just kind of a funny thing. Um, least blotter section of like Ethereum Daily News that you can, uh, I don't know, read with your morning coffee. Well, I say really quick before I hand it over to Wendy. Uh, the funny part about this is the Ethereum Foundation, which of course is a steward of a lot that happens in Ethereum does sell the top almost every single cycle. They have like successfully sold the top on Eth and they put that money back into the Treasury to support grants for Ethereum ecosystem. So it ends up, I think being a net positive. But a lot of people look at when the Ethereum Foundation sells and then sort of make a note about that. And this one, people, obviously not at the top. We're down about, you know, 50 plus percent from the top in 2021 2022. But people might be looking at this and be like, oh, maybe we're looking at like another lower point in the future. If Italic is selling Wendy, it's a one, it's one, literally $1 million. It's really not a lot of money, especially when you're looking at Crypto Whale Wall. It's like there's so many people that are moving around a lot more capital that are loaning it out doing things. I also want to reference a story from coin desk back in March or excuse me, May 17th of 2021 vital 6 billion in ship token says he doesn't want the power so vital has kind of been infamous of doing different things with his funds and wallets that have been tracked. So I don't think it's necessarily a big deal that he moved 1 million of worth to coin base. I think if it was going to be a very, very large amount, it probably would be done. OTC. Um but maybe he just wanted the, hey, maybe he wanted to bridge the funds over to base or to um friend who knows, who knows? Yeah, Wendy, this isn't the first time Vital has sold either. So I don't think this is gonna like do anything to the markets, but I wanted to ask all of you a question based on what said, what do we think if, if vital does cash out a million dollars here, what do we think he's gonna buy? What luxury luggage does vital buy. I love his luggage post. That's one of the better blogs out there is how vital lives out of a 40 liter backpack and here's how he does it. That one is a good piece of content. A lot of 40 liter backpacks. If we're talking a million dollars, I don't think it's that hungry. Maybe he's hungry. He gotta buy snacks. A lot of backpack. All right. Don't know. Don't know."
