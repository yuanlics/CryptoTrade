        "title": "Fidelity files for spot Ethereum ETF, trailing BlackRock's lead by two days - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "Fidelity Investments has filed for a spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF), as seen in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Nov. 17.\n\nCboe BZX submitted a 19b-4 filing describing a proposed rule change that would allow it to list and trade shares of Fidelity\u2019s planned fund. The new Ethereum proposal closely resembles Fidelity\u2019s spot Bitcoin ETF proposal, submitted to the SEC in late June.\n\nBoth Fidelity filings follow similar applications from the company\u2019s main competitor, BlackRock. BlackRock submitted an S-1 filing for its spot Ethereum ETF just days ago, on Nov. 15, and applied for its spot Bitcoin ETF months earlier in June.\n\nThe close timing between the competing filings may be explained by each asset manager\u2019s exceptionally high standing. BlackRock is the largest asset manager in the world, with $9 trillion in assets under management. Fidelity, on the other hand, is the third largest asset manager in the world, with $4.2 trillion in assets under management.\n\nOther firms have pending applications\n\nSeveral other asset managers have also applied for their own spot Bitcoin ETFs and spot Ethereum ETFs following the above high-profile filings.\n\nThe SEC is expected to approve or reject a Bitcoin ETF by Jan. 10, 2024. That decision concerns a spot Bitcoin application from ARK Invest, which submitted its application in May \u2014 about one month before BlackRock submitted its more influential filing. The SEC could apply its decision to other pending ETF applications, many of which are intentionally similar to one another, in order to meet expected requirements.\n\nThough the SEC will evaluate any spot Ethereum ETFs separately from spot Bitcoin ETFs, the approval of one type of fund may pave the way for the other.\n\nIt should be noted that although the SEC has not yet approved any Bitcoin or Ethereum spot ETF, it has approved futures ETFs of both types in recent months and years."

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nIn Ethereum (ETH) mainnet, account abstraction is designed to blur the line between on-chain accounts and smart contracts. A similar groundbreaking development is to arrive to EVM rollups as a detailed rollup improvement proposal is out.\n\nThis proposal might change game in Ethereum-based rollups\n\nAlexander Forshtat, a software developer of Ethereum Foundation, published a proposal dubbed Roadmap for Native Account Abstraction Introduction or RIP-7560: Native Account Abstraction. It is the first attempt to employ the concept of AA within the ecosystem of rollups, i.e., second-layer scaling solutions for Ethereum (ETH).\n\nLet 'er RIP! \u2728\n\n\n\nNative Account Abstraction for rollups standardization that is https://t.co/hR0MU6inuh \u2014 erc4337 (@erc4337) November 18, 2023\n\nThe activation of AA in EVM rollups is a crucial step for the Ethereum (ETH) segment of Web3. Its L1 and L2s should have similar AA designs to establish a \"continuous ecosystem.\"\n\nThe implementation of AA in rollups would require three changes in smart contract accounts: EntryPoint address adjustment, validateUserOp function rewrite and some advances in transaction logics.\n\nSome changes are also required to adjust Paymaster operations and the signature aggregation process. Validation code rules, staking and reputation systems in rollups will look like in the post-ERC 4337 Ethereum (ETH) mainnet.\n\nIn the last two days, Ethereum (ETH) enthusiasts have already submitted a number of comments in the project's GitHub repository.\n\nNative account abstraction standard to land in all L1s and L2s\n\nThe author of the proposal is optimistic about the prospects of its development and adoption as well as its potential role in Ethereum's (ETH) evolution:\n\nWe believe standardization and network effect are critical to the success of any Account Abstraction initiatives, so we are inviting everyone to participate in the creation of the Native Account Abstraction standard that can be adopted by all Layer-2 and Layer-1 networks.\n\nAs covered by U.Today previously, ERC 4337 \"Account Abstraction\" was activated on the Ethereum (ETH) mainnet in March 2023.\n\nWith account abstraction, Ethereum (ETH) on-chain wallets (externally-owned accounts) can be equipped with smart contracts functionality.\n\nThe new class of accounts \u2014 smart contract accounts \u2014 unlocks new opportunities for real-world applications on Ethereum (ETH)."

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAccording to the on-chain analytics firm IntoTheBlock, Ethereum, the second largest cryptocurrency by market value, has seen significant outflows from exchanges in recent weeks. Over $1 billion in ETH has been removed from crypto exchanges within this said period.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nETH recorded $320M in exchange outflows this week, and over $1B through the last three weeks! pic.twitter.com/g1xJfh5p9U \u2014 IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) November 17, 2023\n\nEthereum has seen $320 million in exchange outflows this week and more than $1 billion in the previous three weeks. Exchange outflows frequently indicate that investors are moving funds from centralized exchanges to private wallets.\n\nOne prominent argument for increased exchange outflows is that long-term investors are removing assets to keep them for a longer period. This can be viewed as a vote of confidence in the long-term prospects of the cryptocurrency.\n\nETH was down 1.39% in the last 24 hours to $1,938 at the time of writing. According to IntoTheBlock, Ethereum fees have risen in tandem with market volatility and DeFi volumes.\n\nFidelity files for Ethereum ETF\n\nAccording to Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart, money management behemoth Fidelity has entered the spot Ethereum ETF competition by filing a 19b-4 with CBOE.\n\nFidelity will be the seventh entity to file for an Ethereum spot ETF, according to Seyffart.\n\nAccording to a Friday filing, Fidelity is looking to launch an exchange-traded fund that owns Ethereum's ETH, joining rival BlackRock in the crypto adoption push.\n\nThe Fidelity Ethereum Fund would be listed on a Cboe Global Markets exchange, but the SEC must decide whether to authorize the Ethereum ETF, as it would for others, including one from BlackRock.\n\nIn the latest development, the Securities and Exchange Commission delayed making a decision this week on whether to approve the Hashdex Nasdaq Ethereum ETF, which seeks to hold both spot Ethereum and futures contracts.\n\nThe SEC stated that it needed additional time to act and that it would make a decision by Jan. 1, 2024."

        "title": "Solana-Ethereum Interoperability: The Best of Both Worlds for Web3 dApps - CCN.com",
        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nAdvanced developer tools and a thriving community make Ethereum an attractive option for building dApps.\n\nMeanwhile, Solana offers lower fees and faster transactions.\n\nNeon EVM enables Ethereum dApps to settle transactions on Solana.\n\nInteroperability promises to remove friction for users.\n\nWhen Solana was first conceived, supporters expected it to usurp Ethereum\u2019s throne as the world\u2019s preeminent smart contract platform. But these days, the Ethereum-killer narrative has given way to a focus on blockchain interoperability.\n\nMore than just a buzzword, interoperability is central to a Web3 philosophy committed to the free flow of information and value. It is also the driving force behind an increasingly connected ecosystem of decentralized apps (dApps) and services.\n\nThe dApp Developers Dilemma\n\nWith a headstart of several years, by the time the Solana mainnet launched, Ethereum already benefited from a strong network effect. Today, not only does it boast the most active developer community, but a powerful suite of dev tools and an established user base make Ethereum the go-to choice for most dApp builders.\n\nThat being said, the blockchain still has its drawbacks.\n\nCompared to Solana, Ethereum is slow, clunky and expensive. Sidechains and Layer 2s can scale capacity, but each has its trade-offs.\n\nIn 2023, rising interest in Solana\u2019s potential has even seen its native token SOL significantly outperform ETH. As Ark Invest CEO Cathie Woods put it recently, \u201cEther was faster and cheaper than Bitcoin in the day \u2014 that\u2019s how we got Ether. Solana is even faster and [more] cost-effective.\u201d\n\nBringing Solana\u2019s Power To Ethereum Developers\n\nLooking to create an Ethereum-like development environment on Solana, NeonEVM beta-launch occurred earlier this year, allowing Ethereum smart contracts to run on Solana for the first time.\n\n\u201cRight now, Ethereum is the biggest ecosystem in the market,\u201d CTO Andrey Falaleev said in an interview. \u201cBut without efficiency, it will not grow \u2013 there will be no evolution.\u201d\n\nFrom a developer\u2019s perspective, NeonEVM approximates the native Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). But the efficiency boost comes from Solana, with its superior transaction speed and lower gas fees.\n\nNeonEVM was designed to combine the best of Solana and Ethereum\n\nBy creating what Falaleev called \u201cone world of communication,\u201d the new platform allows two otherwise disconnected ecosystems can grow together.\n\nYet, if interoperability was just a matter of translation, a code compiler like Solang would be sufficient. To realize the full potential of Ethereum compatibility, NeonEVM needs a way to bridge assets from one blockchain to the other.\n\nInteroperability For A Frictionless User Experience\n\nTo port tokens from Ethereum, NeonEVM tapped deBridge. The latter is a decentralized interoperability layer that can transfer data and all manner of different tokens between various blockchains.\n\nThe most simple model for cross-chain bridges sees assets locked at one end while minting their wrapped equivalent at the other. But deBridge\u2019s solution is a far more dynamic and general-purpose protocol for cross-chain transport and messaging.\n\nAs CEO Alex Smirnov explained to CCN, deBridge \u201callows any projects or any token holders to bridge any asset from other ecosystems to Neon.\u201d For NeonEVM-based dApps, that means users don\u2019t need to hold the network\u2019s native token \u2013 NEON \u2013 but can pay gas fees in the transaction token.\n\nThe deBridge ecosystem is now seeing its highest daily volumes ever, much of it being passed between Ethereum and @Solana . It's only natural we should have Spaces with @ZetaMarkets and @SquadsProtocol \ud83d\udd25 See you there in an hour\ud83d\udc4bhttps://t.co/gR2yPNSl1A \u2014 deBridge (@deBridgeFinance) November 16, 2023\n\nBecause solutions like NeonEVM and DeBridge increasingly abstract away the moving parts, \u201cusers can interact with any new data without the need to think about the underlying infrastructure, and even without the need to think about switching wallets or switching networks,\u201d Smirnov observed.\n\nWith Web3 technologies seemingly on the cusp of mainstream adoption, this emerging multichain environment demonstrates the true power of interoperability: its potential to transform the experience of everyday dApp users."
