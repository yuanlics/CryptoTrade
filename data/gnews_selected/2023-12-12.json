        "content": "SSV.Network Introduces Permissionless DVT on Ethereum\n\nTel-Aviv, Israel --News Direct-- SSV\n\nEthereum Distributed Validator Technology (DVT) staking infrastructure SSV.Network has announced its permissionless launch. The milestone is a major breakthrough in creating a new standard for ETH staking by delivering greater security for Ethereum validators and strengthening the network by decentralizing its validation layer.\n\nThe permissionless launch is the product of three years of intensive development in making staking more accessible for all staking participants. The achievement unites the entire Ethereum staking ecosystem, which can benefit from the many uses that DVT allows. SSV Network breaks down entry barriers to Ethereum staking, offering a robust and permissionless infrastructure, enabling seamless building, staking, and zero-collateral node operations through one holistic solution.\n\nThe permissionless launch will enable public validators and node operators to join the network and participate in a first-of-its-kind DVT infrastructure. By going permissionless, anyone will be able to stake and contribute to the overall health of the Ethereum network. To celebrate the launch, the SSV Core Team will host an online event for those who want to learn more about the launch and how to join.\n\nTo support DVT adoption, the SSV DAO initiated a year-long incentivization program which has been earmarked for 1 million $SSV (Current market price - $25 million) and will reward users for registering validators to the network. This can be done by staking directly on SSV.Network or via staking services that embed the DVT infrastructure. This also means that node operators running on other protocols can double up on rewards by also operating on ssv.network.\n\nDVT helps decentralize ETH validators - and by extension, Ethereum as a whole - by increasing client diversity, location distribution, and extending infrastructure diversity, resulting in greater uptime and rewards. Its implementation through SSV.Network will strengthen the Ethereum ecosystem and allow seamless staking for diverse staking use cases.\n\nStory continues\n\nSSV.Network commenced gradual rollout in September 2023 with a selection of permissioned node operators. Having ensured network stability and conducting audits, a broader rollout followed, ensuring security and battle testing before becoming fully permissionless with various staking applications built on the infrastructure. From today, SSV\u2019s community-owned open protocol can be used by the entire Ethereum community to stake, build applications, and run an operator node that utilizes its framework.\n\nIn just over two months, more than $160M was staked through SSV.Network by 74 node operators. In addition, over 2,200 validators are now using SSV\u2019s DVT-based infrastructure. The permissionless launch of the SSV.Network mainnet will accelerate diverse node operators and TVL while establishing the protocol as the preeminent solution for Ethereum staking.\n\nAbout SSV.Network\n\nSSV.Network creates easy-to-use and scalable infrastructure for developers. SSV is powered by DVT technology, a pioneering architectural framework designed specifically for Ethereum staking. Thanks to its permissionless design, SSV empowers staking operators and validators to join the network and participate in Ethereum staking.\n\nContact Details\n\nSSV.Network\n\nRobert Drage\n\ninfo@ssv.network\n\nCompany Website\n\nhttps://ssv.network/\n\nView source version on newsdirect.com: https://newsdirect.com/news/ssv-network-launches-permissionless-dvt-powered-ethereum-staking-778265295"

In the latest development, the company has raised the bar with the introduction of an innovative market cycle structure on the Ethereum blockchain. This development empowers the trading behavior and enhances project stability.\n\nDeFiBitcoin's unique Market Cycle Mastery structure operates on a weekly basis, comprising two distinct phases:\n\nBull Market (4 days): An upward price movement fostering market growth.\n\nBear Market (3 days): A phase characterized by downward price movement, allowing for corrections and adjustments.\n\nA pivotal halving event occurs between these markets, where half of the remaining supply is mined. This not only reduces the total reward pool of 5,250,000 BTC with each cycle but also increases the value of tokens. The tax remains at 0/0 in both market cycles, creating an environment conducive to healthy trading.\n\nWith the new developments, DeFiBitcoin places an emphasis on security, implementing a series of robust measures. To safeguard the integrity of the ecosystem, the developer's functionality is judiciously restricted, limiting actions to essential tasks such as adjusting tax rates, whitelisting wallets, distributing rewards, and minting supply for distribution.\n\nNotably, the supply minted during each halving event is hardcoded to the connected software, reinforcing the predictability and reliability of the platform. Furthermore, it has fortified user's security posture by renouncing the contract, a strategic move that adds an extra layer of protection, ensuring security even without relying on renounce-safe methods. These measures underscore the commitment to fostering a secure and resilient decentralized finance environment for community.\n\nIn tandem with market cycle, DeFiBitcoin has also developed the DeFi Bitcoin Bot - a smart companion specifically crafted for user convenience. Seamlessly integrating with the ecosystem, this intelligent bot aims to enhance the trading experience. Users can effortlessly navigate the DeFi Bitcoin Bot using simple commands like /status and /reward. These commands empower users to swiftly verify their wallet eligibility for rewards and bonuses, whether in the official Telegram group or through direct messaging.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoving forward, the bot goes beyond mere confirmation, providing valuable insights such as eligibility notifications based on trading behavior, token analysis for maintaining reward qualifications, and trade suggestions for optimizing bonuses. Operating in real-time, the bot ensures users stay informed with the latest updates on eligibility status and potential rewards, accessible seamlessly across official Telegram channels and direct messaging.
