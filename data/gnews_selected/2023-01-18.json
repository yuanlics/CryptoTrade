        "content": "New data from crypto analytics firm Santiment suggests that traders may believe the top two leading digital assets by market cap are about to find their local tops.\n\nAccording to Santiment, crypto traders are taking profits on Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) at the highest levels seen since 2021.\n\n\u201cAre crypto markets seeing a top? Traders are behaving like they believe so, taking this opportunity to profit take while given the chance. Bitcoin is seeing its highest profit ratio since Feb 2021. For Ethereum, it\u2019s the highest since Oct 2021.\u201d\n\nCrypto analytics firm Glassnode also notes that the king crypto has seen a greater volume of profits realized on-chain compared to losses for the first time since June.\n\n\u201cDuring bear cycles, this tends to act as a psychological level where investors sell at, or near break-even, creating resistance.\u201d\n\nGlassnode further says Bitcoin is in the process of retesting a value of 1.0 on the adjusted spent output profit ratio (aSOPR), which reflects the ratio between selling and purchase prices.\n\nIt would mark the first retest of that line, which has thus far served as the key resistance level throughout the current bear market, since the collapse of FTX, according to the analytics firm.\n\n\u201cA convincing break above 1.0 for realized [profit/loss] ratio, or aSOPR has historically signaled a cycle regime shift is underway. A successful retest and bounce of aSOPR from 1.0 is often observed near cycle turning points.\u201d\n\nBTC is trading at $21,374 at time of writing and is up 0.39% in the past 24 hours while ETH is changing hands for $1,592 and is up 0.22%.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Crypto-focused early-stage VC firm Electric Capital has found that while Ethereum has the most developers in total, a majority of monthly active developers are working on other ecosystems.\n\nDespite a bear crypto market in 2022, developers continued to create and progress towards mass adoption of decentralized applications (dApps). The crypto industry added 5% more developers in 2022 year-on-year, despite a 70% plunge in cryptoasset prices, the report released on Tuesday showed.\n\nThe year was a rocky one for cryptoassets, given the tightening monetary policy and a string of bankruptcies, stirring fears of liquidity due to contagion. Yet, the industry captured over 61,000 first-time developers \u2014 an all-time high. Since the creation of Bitcoin in 2009, there are now more than 23,000 developers in the industry.\n\nTotal monthly active developers based on crypto ecosystems GitHub; Source: Electric Capital\n\nCore blockchain developers focus on designing the front-end and back-end of a proposed blockchain network, which will then be used as a foundation by others. Even after a blockchain is built, they continue to develop new features and technology to improvise or activate upgrades for better functionality.\n\nElectric Capital found that developer activity in 2022 was far busier than the previous crypto winter of 2018, when bitcoin plunged 65%\n\nSince 2018, the number of monthly active developers rose nearly 300% for Bitcoin. For Ethereum, developer count quintupled from 1,084 to 5,819 in that time period.\n\nSome devs opt for emerging blockchains\n\nThe year of the Merge was significant for Ethereum, and its share of new developers for the stands at 16%.\n\nBut developers working on the Solana, NEAR and Polygon protocols rose 40% year-on-year, and added more than 500 total monthly active developers combined.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nSui, Aptos, Starknet, Mina, Osmosis, Hedera, Optimism and Arbitrum were other blockchains that absorbed developer activity.\n\nThose working on software for non-fungible tokens saw a 300% jump since 2021.\n\nDeveloper engagement is an \u201cearly and leading indicator of value creation,\u201d according to the VC firm. \u201cDevelopers build killer applications that deliver value to end users, which attracts more customers, which then draws more developers,\u201d it added.\n\nAnd what about Bitcoin, recently?

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s native token, Ether (ETH), could grow by 35% versus Bitcoin (BTC) this year to hit 0.1 BTC for the first time since 2018 as it forms a classic bullish continuation pattern.\n\nEthereum price must first break key resistance\n\nDubbed an ascending triangle, the pattern forms when the price fluctuates inside a range defined by rising trendline support and horizontal trendline resistance. It typically resolves after the price breaks out in the direction of its previous trend.\n\nOn a weekly chart, the ETH/BTC pair has been painting an ascending pattern since May 2021. The Ethereum token eyes a breakout above the pattern's horizontal trendline resistance near 0.0776 BTC. Breaking this level could then see the price rally by as much as the triangle's maximum height.\n\nIn other words, the ETH/BTC pair could reach the next big resistance level at 0.1 BTC in 2023, or 35% from the current price levels.\n\nETH/BTC weekly price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nNonetheless, it is important to mention that ETH/BTC has attempted to break above the triangle's resistance trendline eight times since May 2021. The attempts included two major breakouts in November 2021 and September 2022, which saw the pair rallying 14% and 9%, respectively.\n\nBoth rallies fizzled out inside the 0.082 to 0.085 BTC area, followed by extreme price corrections that took ETH/BTC back inside the triangle range. Given this multi-year hurdle, the pair could face stiff resistance inside the 0.082 to 0.085 BTC range, even if it breaks above the triangle.\n\nSuch a move would risk crashing ETH toward the triangle support, which coincides with its 50-week exponential moving average (50-week EMA), represented by the red line in the chart above, near 0.070 BTC, down nearly 6% from the current price levels.\n\nETH \"deflation\" narrative\n\nEther\u2019s bullish setup versus Bitcoin appears as ETH dominance has doubled versus other crypto assets in the past few years.\n\nNotably, ETH\u2019s market capitalization has risen to nearly 20.5% of the entire crypto market valuation in January 2023, from about 10% in December 2020, when the Ethereum network started its transition from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS) with the launch of a dedicated staking smart contract.\n\nETH.D weekly performance chart. Source: TradingView\n\nBecoming a PoS blockchain has brought two key changes to Ethereum\u2019s economy. First, users temporarily lock away a portion of their Ether holdings into Ethereum\u2019s PoS smart contract to earn yield. And second, the Ethereum network has started burning some transaction fees.\n\nRelated: Ethereum \u2018shark\u2019 accumulation, Shanghai hard fork put $2K ETH price in play\n\nBoth changes have had a deflationary impact on overall supply. As a result, the Ethereum network now regularly produces fewer Ether tokens than are taken out of circulation, which theoretically makes ETH a \u201cdeflationary\u201d asset.\n\nETH supply change since the Ethereum PoS upgrade in September 2022. Source: UltraSound.Money\n\nThe ETH/BTC price has grown nearly 250% since December 2020 despite still being down roughly 50% from its all-time highs witnessed in 2017.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.
