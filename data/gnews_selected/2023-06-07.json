        "content": "In the wake of Ethereum\u2019s recent hard fork, which introduced the ability to withdraw staked ETH and presented a significant new competitor to US T-bills, VanEck revisits its Ethereum estimates with a robust valuation model. VanEck\u2019s analysis predicts that Ethereum\u2019s annual revenue will rise from $2.6 billion to $51 billion by 2030, potentially leading to a token price of $11.8k.\n\nVanEck Evaluates Ethereum\n\nVanEck values Ethereum by projecting cash flows for the year ending on April 30, 2030. In their Base Case scenario, they anticipate Ethereum achieving $51 billion in annual revenue by that time.\n\nadvertisement\n\nVanEck\u2019s analysis incorporates various factors such as transaction fees, MEV (Maximal Extractable Value), and the concept of \u201cSecurity as a Service\u201d to provide a comprehensive valuation methodology.\n\nDeducting a validator fee of 1% and applying a global tax rate of 15%, the projected cash flows to Ethereum amount to $42.90 billion. Utilizing a free cash flow (FCF) multiple of 33x and considering a token supply of 120.7 million, VanEck arrives at a Base Case 2030 Price Target of $11,848 per token.\n\nRead CoinGape\u2019s ETH Price Prediction..\n\nKey Takeaways- Ethereum Price:\n\nEthereum\u2019s valuation is projected to rise from $2.6 billion to $51 billion in annual revenue by 2030. Assuming a 70% market share among smart contract protocols, a token price of $11.8k is predicted for Ethereum by 2030. The valuation methodology includes cash flow projections, deductions for validator fees and taxes, and the use of an FCF multiple. Market capture analysis reveals Ethereum\u2019s dominance in key sectors such as transactions, finance, banking, payments, metaverse, social and gaming, and infrastructure. Ethereum\u2019s potential as a store-of-value asset is explored, considering its programmability, cross-chain capabilities, and the concept of \u201cSecurity as a Service\u201d.\n\nAccording to CoinMarketCap data, the live Ethereum price today is $1,875.79 USD with a 24-hour trading volume of $9,361,683,038 USD. Ethereum is up 3.32% in the last 24 hours.\n\nAs Ethereum continues to evolve and capture market share, its role as a leading smart contract platform and a potential store-of-value asset becomes increasingly prominent in the crypto landscape."

        "title": "Security or not, Ether looks poised to hold the $1.8K level based on 3 key metrics - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Ether\u2019s price retested $1,780 after the news of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) suing cryptocurrency exchanges Binance and Coinbase, but it\u2019s not preposterous to suggest that Ether bulls should be more than happy that its price did not break below the 67-day support.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s actions are actually a double-edged sword for Ether (ETH), and on Crypto Twitter, some analysts attributed the bounce in Ether to its not being listed as a security in either of the cases brought against Binance and Coinbase. For instance, the SEC explicitly mentioned BNB (BNB), Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA), which are direct competitors to Ethereum\u2019s smart contract-processing capabilities.\n\nHowever, as noted by analyst Jevgenijs Kazanins, Ether\u2019s omission does not mean that it has the green light from the SEC.\n\nSEC did not mention #ETH in the list of tokens that it considers to be securities when suing Coinbase and Binance. Could it be that the SEC is working on a separate lawsuit targeting Ethereum Foundation? \u2014 Jevgenijs Kazanins (@jevgenijs) June 6, 2023\n\nKazanins raises the question of whether the SEC could be targeting the Ethereum Foundation in a separate lawsuit. For now, the idea is a mere unfounded speculation, but it certainly has merit given that SEC Chairman Gary Gensler refused to answer questions about Ether\u2019s status before the U.S. House Financial Services Committee in April 2023.\n\nIn the meantime, what traders can focus on is Ether\u2019s price action, network data and other data that impacts investor sentiment and price in the short term.\n\nEthereum DApps get a slight boost\n\nTotal value locked (TVL) measures the deposits locked in Ethereum\u2019s decentralized applications (DApps), which have been in a downtrend since mid-March. The indicator reached a 14.35 million ETH bottom on June 3 but bounced back to 14.6 million ETH by June 6, according to DefiLlama.\n\nThe number of active addresses interacting with DApps is also in a slump. Over the last 30 days, the top 12 DApps running on the Ethereum network saw a 4% increase in active addresses, even though the average transaction gas fee remained above $6.50.\n\nEthereum's 30-day DApp activity. Source: DappRadar\n\nIf investors fear that Ether has higher odds of breaking below the $1,800 support, it should be reflected in the ETH futures contract premium and increased costs for protective put options.\n\nEther derivatives metrics neutral as regulations ramped up\n\nEther quarterly futures are popular among whales and arbitrage desks. However, these fixed-month contracts typically trade at a slight premium to spot markets, indicating that sellers are asking for more money to delay settlement.\n\nAs a result, ETH futures contracts in healthy markets should trade at a 4 to 8% annualized premium \u2014 a situation known as contango, which is not unique to crypto markets.\n\nEther 2-month futures annualized premium. Source: Laevitas\n\nAccording to the futures premium, known as the basis indicator, professional traders have been avoiding leveraged longs (bullish bets). Still, not even the retest of the $1,780 level on June 6 was enough to flip those whales and market makers into bearish sentiment.\n\nTo exclude externalities that might have solely impacted the Ether futures, one should analyze the ETH options markets. The 25% delta skew indicator compares similar call (buy) and put (sell) options and will turn positive when fear is prevalent because the protective put option premium is higher than the call options.\n\nEther 30-day 25% skew. Source: Laevitas\n\nThe skew indicator will move above 8% if traders fear an Ether price crash. On the other hand, generalized excitement reflects a negative 8% skew. As displayed above, the 25% delta skew moved above the positive 8% threshold on June 5, indicating bearishness. However, the subsequent bounce to $1,880 on June 6 has moved the metric back to a neutral state.\n\nRelated: Coinbase reminds world it tried to \u2018embrace regulation\u2019 as SEC sues for violations\n\nEther\u2019s price looks poised to hold above $1,800\n\nIn short, these three indicators signal resilience \u2014 namely, the TVL bounce to 14.6 million ETH, the 4% increase in DApps\u2019 active addresses and a meager impact on Ether derivatives markets, despite the retest of the $1,800 level.\n\nEthereum network usage data remains healthy, and the recent retest of the 67-day support was not enough to scare professional traders, according to derivatives metrics.\n\nConsequently, bulls seem to have dodged a bullet, greatly reducing the risk of an imminent price crash.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.
