        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s highly anticipated tech update, often referred to as the Shanghai or Shapella upgrade, starting April 12 enabled withdrawals of some 18 million tokens, worth $35 billion, previously locked up in staking contracts. After the upgrade, ETH\u2019s price rallied to $2,100, its highest level in 11 months, defying earlier concerns the unlocking could lead to significant selling pressure and a price crash. The token recently has dropped below $1,900, aligning with a broader crypto market decline."

        "content": "The cryptocurrency market is preparing for a significant event as a considerable number of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) options are set to expire.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to data shared by Greeks.live on Twitter, 25,000 BTC options will expire with a put-call ratio of 0.7, a max pain point of $29,000, and a notional value of $0.72 billion.\n\nAdditionally, 217,000 ETH options will expire, featuring a put-call ratio of 0.83, a max pain point of $1,950, and a notional value of $0.42 billion.\n\nCrypto options, similar to traditional options, make it possible for investors to hedge their positions, speculate on price movements, or even generate income by selling options.\n\nOption expiries refer to the end of an option contract's life, at which point the option either gets exercised or becomes worthless.\n\nIn the context of the cryptocurrency market, an option is a financial instrument that provides traders the opportunity to buy or sell an underlying asset, such as Bitcoin or Ethereum , at a predetermined price before a specific expiration date.\n\nThe put-call ratio, meanwhile, is an indicator that measures the balance of put options (contracts that grant the right to sell) to call options (contracts that grant the right to buy) in the market. A high put-call ratio usually signals bearish sentiment, while a lower ratio implies bullish sentiment.\n\nThe max pain point, also known as the max pain level, is the point where option owners (buyers) feel the most financial pain, i.e., the price at which the greatest number of options will expire worthless."

        "content": "The Merge represented the Ethereum network\u2019s transition from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake. 218 days later, more than 103,092 ETH has been eliminated from the supply of the world\u2019s largest altcoin.\n\nAt current prices, this amounts to a little over $197 million. Deflation on the network is on the rise as the supply declined by 0.146% per year.\n\nAccording to the latest data from the Ethereum monitoring site \u2018ultrasound.money,\u2019 the current supply of ether stands at nearly 120,416,113 million coins.\n\nThe currency burn rate over the last 30 days was found to be at 1,125k ETH and a supply growth of -0.37%.\n\nAt this pace, the Ethereum supply is expected to reach 118.1 million by the year 2025.\n\nIssuance rewards for stakers, on the other hand, will be at 3.9% per year, while the burn rate for the non-stakers will stand at 1.8% per year.\n\nContrastingly, if Ethereum had not undergone the Merge and instead continued to rely on miners to secure the network, the supply of the token would have increased by more than 2.5 million ETH, which translates to an astonishing $4.9 billion in the current market value.\n\nETH\u2019s supply, for one, would have increased by 3.53% every year.\n\nWhile the Merge was indeed responsible for the reduction in ETH supply by a considerable amount, the aspect of burning ether can be attributed to the Ethereum Improvement Proposal 1559, which was implemented via the London upgrade in August 2021. Its main purpose is to slash inflation on the Ethereum network and exert deflationary pressure on the token\u2019s supply.\n\nMeanwhile, the Shapella upgrade on April 12 enabled stakers to unlock their staked Ether. The exodus of tokens following the event slowed down.\n\nWithin a week, the amount of staked ether trumped the number of ETH being withdrawn for the very first time."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) could be facing resistance at key round number levels of $30,000 and $2,000, with the potential for a stock market downturn with the Federal Reserve tightening into a recession that could affect all risk assets.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum have had a pivotal status since 2020, with definable diminishing supply and low but increasing adoption making a strong case for long-term bullishness.\n\nOn April 21, Bloomberg senior commodity strategist Mike McGlone stated that the yield curve\u2019s highest probability since 1982 suggests a growing consensus that the worst of a US recession may be over. However, this could potentially lead to large pullback risks, according to McGlone.\n\nMcGlone tweeted: \u201cBitcoin and Ethereum \u2014 may be running into a wall of resistance at the key round number levels of $30,000 and $2,000. Our bias is bullish in the long term for the top cryptos, but an overwhelming force of the stock market going down with the Fed tightening into a recession has the potential to lower the tide for all risk assets, and Bitcoin and Ethereum are among the riskiest.\u201d\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum are among high-risk assets. Source: Mike McGlone\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum\n\nThe future of Bitcoin and Ethereum is closely tied to technological advancements and increasing adoption. Many experts believe that these cryptocurrencies will continue to gain mainstream acceptance as more businesses and individuals recognize the benefits of decentralized financial systems.\n\nSince the turn of the year, Bitcoin has experienced a notable increase of approximately 70%, while Ethereum has climbed just above 60%. Interestingly, a recent historical pattern has emerged as the value of Bitcoin has again reached 15 ETH after six years.\n\nDespite the impressive performance of these digital assets and surpassing key price levels of $30,000 and $2,000 in April, both have experienced significant pullbacks in the last week. At present, Bitcoin is trading at $28,077, down 1.88% on the day and 8.91% over the previous week. Meanwhile, Ethereum, the second-largest asset by market cap, is currently trading at $1,908, down 1.75% in the last 24 hours and 9.86% in the last week.\n\nWhile Bitcoin and Ethereum\u2019s recent pullbacks may cause temporary concern, their overall upward trend and potential for long-term growth remain. Investors should remain vigilant of potential downside risks, especially in light of broader market conditions.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.
