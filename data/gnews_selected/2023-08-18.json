        "content": "The price of Ether (ETH) surged around 11% to $1,700 following news that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission is set to allow the first exchange-traded funds (ETFs) based on Ether Futures.\n\nAccording to an Aug. 17 report from Bloomberg \u2014 which cited anonymous sources familiar with the matter \u2014 the regulator does not look as though it will block the applications of nearly twelve companies, including ProShares, Volatility Shares, Bitwise and Roundhill, that have filed to launch Ether (ETH) futures ETFs in recent weeks.\n\nBreaking\n\n\n\nThe SEC is expected to green light an ETH futures ETF\n\n\n\nThe beginning of something potentially massive here\u2026 pic.twitter.com/x9KtOpCqei \u2014 Bankless (@BanklessHQ) August 17, 2023\n\nIt remains unclear which ETF applications would be approved by the SEC; however, officials indicated that several of the filings may be approved by as soon as October.\n\nETF analyst Eric Balchunas said he wasn't surprised by the SEC's move to approve Ether futures ETFs, adding that the decision shows how the regulator's views on different products, such as a spot Bitcoin ETF can change over time.\n\nThis not surprising to us, we had said they would approve Ether Futures early on in race. Nice to be validated. Now what does it mean for spot? Hard to say beyond it shows that their views/policy/tolerance can change. https://t.co/JXCxNUpj2U \u2014 Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) August 17, 2023\n\nThe SEC has been inundated with applications for Ether futures ETFs, with more than 12 filings for such products being submitted to the regulator since late July.\n\nRelated: Donald Trump\u2019s Ethereum wallet holds $2.8M, new statement shows\n\nThe news pushed ETH's price back up 11% to $1,717 just 20 minutes after the market took a tumble two hours earlier.\n\nThe price of Ether jumped 11% following the news that the SEC would approve Ether futures ETFs.

After releasing its OP Stack, a variety of builders have spun up their very own networks including the Coinbase-incubated Base network.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe continued influx of new participants also points to \u201cthe resilience and thriving ecosystem that Arbitrum has built,\u201d said Nansen analysts\n\nThe launch of Arbitrum Orbit, a permissionless framework for deploying Orbit Chains, or so-called layer-3 chains, atop Arbitrum One or Arbitrum Nova, also appears to have helped boost user activity.\n\nUnpacking Arbitrum Orbit\n\nLaunched on June 21, Arbitrum Orbit lets users create their own Arbitrum-based rollup.\n\nOrbit is similar to Optimism\u2019s OP Stack in enabling the creation of new blockchains with its own privacy, permissions, fee token, and governance specifications.\n\n\u201cThese solutions collectively aim to offer faster, more cost-effective, and secure transactions, fostering innovation and supporting Ethereum\u2019s growth as a sustainable and scalable blockchain,\u201d said the analysts.\n\nThe main difference between the two designs is that Optimism chains are \u201cgeared towards the layer-2 market,\u201d whereas Arbitrum\u2019s design is more application-specific.\n\nNansen analysts added, \u201cBy having less congestion on the base layer, removing app-specific transactions to an L3. Arbitrum Orbit might be able to further aggregate transactions and optimize computation, significantly increasing the transaction throughput.\u201d"

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nCardano founder Charles Hoskinson says Ethereum has terrible programming\n\nThe CEO highlights the power of his layer-2 solution Hydra\n\nADA survives despite removal from key exchanges\n\nIf Elon Musk was right about one thing when it comes to Twitter it would be about its potential as a town square. No other social media platform allows everyday folk to interact with celebrities, CEOs, and multi-millionaires/billionaires the way Twitter does. For that reason, one may find several instances where influential figures on the platform voice their opinions in a candid non-corporate-like manner.\n\nOn August 17th, Twitter became home to a daring statement by Charles Hoskinson, CEO of Cardano. Hoskinson quote-retweeted a user who outright mocked Cardano, Hydra, and Hoskinson. The CEO then responded by highlighting key advantages Cardano has over Ethereum, the blockchain the user seemingly preferred.\n\nCool, let\u2019s make a bet. My prediction is that within six months time, Charles will: Stop talking about Hydra \u201cWe never actually said that was a viable solution for everything, it\u2019s only good for a few specific things\u201d, has level set on Input Endorsers \u201cThat\u2019s the long term\u2026 \u2014 0xNLY.arf (@0xNLYFANS) August 17, 2023\n\nCardano: A Better Way Of Handling Transactions\n\nHoskinson\u2019s response focused both on criticizing Ethereum, and on highlighting the capabilities of his technology.\n\n\u201cHydra is live on mainnet and evolving fast. Mithril is live as well and the first step towards a rich DA and light client strategy. We already designed a significantly better way of handling transactions via tiered pricing and Babel fees.\n\nThere\u2019s been a roll-up strategy since Midnight was conceived 4 years ago. The protocols and primitives had to catch up and are getting there,\u201d tweeted Hoskinson.\n\nHydra refers to the layer-2 scaling solution that uses sidechains to offload transactions from the main chain. This allows Cardano to process more transactions per second at a lower cost.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile Ethereum has a dumpster fire of a consensus layer, has a terrible programming model that they can\u2019t change, and are getting eaten alive by their own layer 2 ecosystem.\u201c\n\nIt's getting delusion town now. Hydra is live on mainnet and evolving fast. Mithril is live as well and the first step towards a rich DA and light client strategy. We already designed a significantly better way of handling transactions via tiered pricing and Babel fees. There's\u2026 https://t.co/2cJa8ivJGu \u2014 Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) August 17, 2023\n\nIn a 2020 video, Hoskinson changed up the trend on his Youtube channel from updates about his personal life to a talk about his company\u2019s innovations.\n\n\u201cSimulations have shown that each \u2018Hydra head\u2019 can currently process about 1,000 transactions per second (TPS). With 1,000 stacking pools, each of which processes 1,000 TPS, Cardano could achieve a throughput of up to one million transactions per second,\u201d said Hoskinson in his video.\n\nHydra was first revealed during an AMA video on Hoskinson\u2019s Youtube channel in 2020. When asked about updates on the layer-2 solution his company has been working on, he had this to say:\n\n\u201cWe are going to keep adding resources to Hydra, and we\u2019ve been trying to identify some teams so we can parallelize the workstream because it\u2019s such a high commercial priority. And it\u2019s going to be very important that we\u2019ll be able to offload a large number of the transaction traffic that\u2019s going to come from all of the apps that are coming.\u201d\n\nHoskinson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nCardano\u2019s ADA Token Thrives Despite Outcasting\n\nCardano\u2019s native token ADA has been subject to several attacks due to its status in the eyes of the US Securities and Exchange Commission and its leader, Gary Gensler. Gensler sees any token besides Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, and Litecoin as a security. Accordingly, the SEC is willing to sue any exchange that trades in significant sums of these supposed \u2018unregistered securities.\u2019\n\nAs a result, many exchanges, such as Revolut, have been seen suspending trading of tokens such as ADA, SOL, and MATIC.\n\nHowever, Cardano and Hoskinson look at the application of ADA and its corresponding blockchain as technologies beyond the simple potential of financial investment.\n\nFor example, in 2021, Hoskinson tweeted his celebration of Cardano technology being used in Ethiopian schools as a form of encrypted credentials for five million students.\n\nDropped by the MOE today to discuss the digital transformation of Ethiopia's educational credentials. Five million students on schedule pic.twitter.com/FGhguPDW2q \u2014 Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) October 28, 2021\n\nOn top of that, Cardano\u2019s ADA is doing relatively well. Reports show that ADA is on an upward price trajectory and that bulls might be holding ADA in anticipation of a price increase."
