        "title": "Ethereum Now Has More \"Hodlers\" Than Bitcoin Thanks to Staking - The Defiant - DeFi News",
        "content": "ETH held by addresses for longer than 12 months is at the highest since at least 2018, with the ratio surpassing Bitcoin's for the first time ever.\n\nBy: Camila Russo \u2022 Loading...\n\nDeFi News\n\nEthereum staking is minting a record amount of \"hodlers,\" with the ratio of long-term owners surpassing Bitcoin's.\n\nETH held by addresses for longer than 12 months -- or what IntoTheBlock calls the \"Hodler Ratio\"-- is at almost 72% of total ETH holders, the highest since at least October 2018, the data show.\n\nEthereum's \"Hodler Ratio\" crossed Bitcoin's in October, after surpassing it for the first time ever in August.\n\nLong-term investors are important for the health of a Layer 1 chain. So-called \"hodlers\" provide stability and mitigate market volatility as they are less likely to sell in response to short-term market fluctuations.\n\nHodler Ratio\n\nEthereum beating Bitcoin \"hodlers\" comes even as Bitcoin long-term investors increase. The Bitcoin ecosystem is observing the largest disparity on record between its long-term and short-term holders, according to Glassnode.\n\nRead More: Disparity Between Bitcoin HODLers and Daytraders Hits Record\n\nStaking Rewards\n\nEthereum's staking rewards are incentivizing ETH holders to own the chain's native currency for longer and to accumulate more of it.\n\n\"The increase [of long-term holders] is most likely related to the growth in staking this year,\" said Lucas Outumuro, head of research at IntoTheBlock.\n\nThe amount of ETH staked has nearly doubled in 2023 with about 24% of all supply being staked, Outumuro said. The average duration of funds held there is over one year, so this drives the \"Hodler Ratio\" higher, he said.\n\nDeFi Alpha Premium Content DeFi Daily | Weekdays\n\nDeFi Alpha Letter | Weekly\n\nDefiant Podcast Transcript | Weekly\n\nInbox Dump | Saturday\n\nWeekly Recap | Sunday Looking for Alpha?

The rate is equivalent to the network's \"risk free\" rate, analogous to the yield on a 10-year U.S. Treasury note.\n\nEthereum Whales\n\nEthereum whales are also on the rise, though that number is more nuanced. Addresses owning more than 1% of the circulating ETH supply increased by 12 percentage points this year to 34.6%, according to IntoTheBlock. But the number includes staking contracts, which include many individual holders.\n\nOut of eight Layer 1 chains tracked, only Ethereum and Cardano whales increased this year relative to the rest of holders, while whales in chains including Bitcoin and Avalanche declined."

        "content": "Elena is an expert in technical analysis and risk management in cryptocurrency market. She has 10+year experience in writing - accordingly she is avid journalists with a passion towards researching new insights coming into crypto erena.\n\nStory Highlights Ethereum is reaching new highs with a 2.9% surge.\n\nAnalysts forecast a potential climb to $3,500 in the first quarter of 2024.\n\nEthereum outpaced Bitcoin in price growth in November, surging by 13%.\n\nThe world of cryptocurrency is as exciting as ever and this time it\u2019s Ethereum that is taking the stage.\n\nEthereum isn\u2019t just holding its own; it\u2019s reaching new highs. Currently at $2,099 with a 2.9% surge, Ethereum has enthusiasts and investors buzzing about the potential climb to $3,500. What\u2019s driving this upward trend? Let\u2019s explore the intriguing developments shaping Ethereum\u2019s journey.\n\nETH Price\n\nRenowned crypto analyst Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe has shared an optimistic outlook for Ethereum, especially in light of recent developments such as Fidelity\u2019s filing. Van de Poppe forecasts a potential climb to $3,500 in the first quarter of 2024, aligning this projection with the upward trajectory witnessed in Bitcoin.\n\n#Ethereum Spot ETF filing by Fidelity!\n\n\n\nConfirms my thesis that after #Bitcoin gets its shine, we\u2019ll see Ethereum running to $3,500 in Q1 2024. \u2014 Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) November 30, 2023\n\nRead More: Whales Activated: A Massive Breakout in the Ethereum (ETH) Price is on the Horizon\n\nWhales in Action\n\nA recent surge in Ethereum whale accumulation has caught market attention. On-chain data shows a shift: major exchange wallet holdings dropped to 8.03 million ETH, while non-exchange wallets surged to a record 41.03 million ETH, as reported by Coinpedia News. This shift suggests a growing preference for self-custody among investors, with significant Ethereum amounts moving away from centralized exchanges.\n\nNovember\u2019s Win\n\nIn a surprise move, Ethereum outpaced Bitcoin in price growth in November, surging by 13% compared to Bitcoin\u2019s 8%. A key catalyst was BlackRock\u2019s official filing of a spot ETH ETF. Despite less buzz around ETFs, on-chain data suggests Ethereum\u2019s price volatility now exceeds Bitcoin\u2019s, possibly drawing short-term traders to invest more in ETH than BTC in December.\n\nEthereum Takes the Lead\n\nAccording to IntoTheBlock\u2019s recent report, Ethereum\u2019s 30-day Average Intra-Day Volatility score stands at an impressive 0.45%, beating Bitcoin\u2019s 0.32%. This shift in volatility dynamics could reshape investment strategies, drawing more attention to the dynamic opportunities within the Ethereum market.\n\nDespite facing hurdles in November, Ethereum\u2019s price showed a positive pattern known as a Double Bottom on the chart. As we navigate the unpredictable crypto market, the burning question remains: Can Ethereum reach $3,000 by the end of 2023?\n\nAlso Read: Is the SEC Playing Favorites with Bitcoin and Ethereum?\n\nThe excitement continues as Ethereum\u2019s journey unfolds, and the crypto community eagerly awaits the next chapter in its compelling story."

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nCrypto analyst Ali highlights the possibility of a return toward $2,000 for the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, Ethereum (ETH), if a scenario presented by the TD sequential validates.\n\n\n\nAccording to Ali, the TD sequential, known for its accuracy in predicting ETH's price movements on the four-hour chart, has flashed a sell signal at a key resistance level. Should this signal hold, ETH may retrace and head toward the $2,000 price point.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n#Ethereum | The TD Sequential's track record speaks volumes! Its accuracy in predicting $ETH's price movements on the 4hr chart is noteworthy.\n\n\n\nCurrently, it's flashing a sell signal at a key resistance level. Should this signal hold true, we may see #ETH retracting and heading\u2026 pic.twitter.com/b6oAUws8E3 \u2014 Ali (@ali_charts) December 1, 2023\n\nAt the time of writing, ETH was up 2.22% in the last 24 hours to $2,076. A trip toward $2,000 would mean a 5% drop for ETH in the short term.\n\nThe largest Ethereum wallets, however, continue to form an encouraging pattern, according to Santiment. The ten largest exchange wallet holdings have reached a six-month low at 8.03 million ETH, while nonexchange wallet holdings have soared to an all-time high at 41.03 million ETH as more coins move to self-custody.\n\nEthereum developers announce important update on Goerli\n\nGoerli, Ethereum's first multiclient testnet, will no longer be supported by client and EF testing teams in the next few months.\n\nThe Dencun network update will be the network's final upgrade. The above-mentioned teams will begin exiting their validators three months after the Goerli Dencun activation or one month after the Dencun mainnet activation, whichever comes later.\n\nUsers of Goerli as a stable testnet should migrate elsewhere before this.\n\nWhile Goerli staking is permissionless, validators from the client and testing teams constitute the vast majority of the stake. As a result, their exits will have an impact on the network's stability.\n\nFurthermore, teams intend to take the opportunity to test delayed finality, inactivity leaks and mass slashings.\n\nSepolia is encouraged to be used by application and tool developers to test decentralized applications, smart contracts and other EVM features.\n\nStakers and infrastructure providers interested in protocol-level testing should use the recently released Holesky testnet. Stakeholders should also consider the Ephemery testnet for validator setup testing. Goerli is currently expected to be the first testnet to activate the Dencun upgrade."

        "content": "The Ethereum network\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions have dropped by an estimated 99.97% since its shift to proof-of-stake, despite a big rise in node count.\n\nThat\u2019s according to new research by the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance. The organization has upped its crypto research effort after in April launching the Cambridge Blockchain Network Sustainability Index (CBNSI) \u2014 a measure that detailed Ethereum\u2019s electricity consumption pre- and post-Merge.\n\nThe Ethereum network currently is responsible for 2.8 kilotonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (KtCO 2 e) on an annualized basis, the CCAF said in a Friday report.\n\n\u201cTo contextualize, this would equate to the emissions from five round-trip airplane flights from London to New York, the annual energy consumption-related emissions of 450 UK households, or the annual carbon sequestration capacity of 270 acres of forest,\u201d the report states.\n\nEthereum switched to a proof-of-stake consensus model in September 2022. The Ethereum Foundation had estimated the Merge would reduce the blockchain\u2019s power consumption by 99.95%.\n\nRead more: Ethereum switches to proof-of-stake after 7 years of work\n\nBut electricity usage is only one piece of an environmental impact assessment, according to the Friday report.\n\nAdditional data was required to convert electricity consumption to greenhouse gas emissions. The CCAF used off-chain data from the peer-to-peer communication of Ethereum nodes to gather both electricity usage and the geolocational distribution of nodes.\n\nThe number of Ethereum validators has grown 57% since April 1, reaching 880,822. Ethereum nodes have grown to 14,072, reflecting a 23.2% increase over that span.\n\nThe network\u2019s annual electricity consumption increased by 21.2% in those eight months, from 6.19 GWh to 7.50 GWh \u2014 roughly the annual electricity use of 2,000 English households, the Cambridge data shows.\n\nAs for where the nodes are, Europe and North America are home to 43.3% and 40.5% of them, respectively, following the Merge.\n\nSource: Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance (CCAF)\n\nThe CCAF estimates pre-Merge greenhouse gas emissions were about 10.3 MCO 2 e. The latest post-Merge figure of 2.8 KtCO 2 e reflects a 99.97% drop despite a substantial increase in the number of Ethereum nodes, the report notes.\n\nThe network is now powered by nearly 48% sustainable energy \u2014 including 32% renewables and 16% nuclear \u2014 the CCAF estimates, with the remaining 52% coming from natural gas, coal-fired power, and oil.\n\nThe CCAF said it next looks to enhance its Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index (CBECI). Despite Ethereum\u2019s shift to proof-of-stake, bitcoin\u2019s proof-of-work consensus model is a cornerstone of its identity, the report acknowledges \u2014 making a similar transition \u201cnot as straightforward as it might appear at first glance.\u201d\n\nThe research institute adds: \u201cThe narrative of Ethereum and Bitcoin\u2019s different paths is not just a tale of technological advancements but also reflects different ideologies and priorities of their communities, highlighting the multifaceted complexity inherent in the evolution of leading blockchain networks.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "Ethereum price rallies toward key resistance but is ETH's strength sustainable? - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Ether (ETH) is trading higher on Dec. 1, despite its inability to breach the $2,100 resistance. This level has prompted several rejections in the past three weeks, which is especially concerning given Ether\u2019s 16.2% gains in November.\n\nEther 12-hour price index, USD. Source: TradingView\n\nHowever, the current positive momentum is supported by several factors, including applications for spot ETFs and the expansion of Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem, driven by layer-2 solutions.\n\nETH benefits from ETF expectations and negative news related to competing blockchains\n\nA pivotal development occurred on Nov. 30, with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) initiating the review process for Fidelity\u2019s spot Ether ETF proposal, filed on Nov. 17. This move, along with similar applications from firms like BlackRock, awaits regulatory green light. If approved, these ETFs would bolster Ether's status as a digital commodity, reducing the likelihood of it being treated as a security.\n\nDespite analysts predicting the SEC might delay its decision to early 2024, interim deadlines for applications by VanEck and ARK 21Shares on Dec. 25 and Dec. 26, respectively, have kept the market engaged. The mounting interest from large mutual funds in Ether products is creating a favorable impact on its price.\n\nThe Ethereum network's growth, especially in transaction activity and layer-2 development, is noteworthy. The Ethereum layer-2 ecosystem has become increasingly important as the average transaction fee held above $4 for the last couple of months. These layer-2 solutions offer more cost-effective and flexible options than the base layer.\n\nThis growth is reflected in Ethereum's total value locked (TVL), which recently hit a two-month high of 13 million ETH, spurred by a 13% weekly gain in Spark and a 60% increase in Blast user deposits.\n\nEthereum network top DApps by TVL. Source: DefiLlama\n\nIn contrast, Tron, another leading blockchain in TVL terms, witnessed a 12% decline over the past ten days. Recent high-profile hacks linked to Tron's founder Justin Sun have also swayed investor confidence toward Ethereum.\n\nTVL growth is based on Ethereum layer-2 innovations\n\nBlast, an Ethereum layer-2 project, has impressively accumulated $647 million in TVL, a testament to the vibrant development within this space. Despite facing criticism over centralization issues and smart contract flexibility, Blast's self-promoted features like auto-compounding and stablecoin yields are attracting significant attention. On the flip side, Blast has suffered criticism for centralization and the flexibility to upgrade its smart contracts.\n\nNotably, Blast is just one part of a larger ecosystem. Ethereum's leading scaling solutions, Arbitrum and Optimism, hold a combined TVL of $2.94 billion. In the context of TVL, it's insightful to compare Ethereum's robust layer-2 ecosystem with other blockchains. Although these solutions are still subject to significant base layer settlement fees, there's no denying the impressive growth and increased activity they've experienced over time.\n\nRelated: Why is the crypto market up today?\n\nTake Solana (SOL) as an example: its entire TVL, encompassing projects like Marinade Finance, Jito, marginfi, Solend, and Orca, is currently valued at $671 million. This stark contrast highlights the edge Ethereum's layer-2 solutions have over its competitors, such as Cardano (ADA), BSC Chain (BNB), and Avalanche (AVAX), blockchains primarily focused on native scaling solutions. However, Ethereum's approach, leveraging layer-2 technologies, seems to have gained more traction and user trust, as evidenced by its growing activity.\n\nIn essence, Ether's recent push towards the $2,100 resistance level is largely influenced by the anticipated approval of spot ETFs in the U.S. and the increased market share in decentralized applications.\n\nThe ongoing evolution and appeal of Ethereum's layer-2 solutions, which mitigate high transaction costs, are also playing a crucial role in attracting users and sustaining Ether's positive market trajectory.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.
