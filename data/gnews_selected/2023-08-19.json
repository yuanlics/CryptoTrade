        "content": "On Aug. 15, the Ethereum Foundation listed projects and community events that received funding in Q2.\n\nFurthermore, the Foundation spent a total of $9.2 million supporting projects, conferences, and industry research.\n\nThe largest number of recipients were community and education projects which included more than ten summits and conferences.\n\nTime to round up all the projects that received funding last quarter \ud83e\udd20 Read all about \u2018em in our Allocation Update: Q2 2023 blogpost! https://t.co/fjgkXXAiod \u2014 EF Ecosystem Support Program (@EF_ESP) August 15, 2023\n\nEthereum Foundation Promoting Education\n\nConferences and hackathons across the world, including ETH Barcelona, ETH Belgrade, ETH Prague, Ethereum Singapore, and ETH Rome, were funded.\n\nConsensus Layer research on data availability sampling, distributed systems, and staking infrastructure tools received grants. There was also continued development of Nimbus and Lighthouse Ethereum clients.\n\nCryptography and zero-knowledge proofs were a big category for funding. Toolings like Chiquito and Hypernova to build zk circuits more easily and privacy-preserving protocols like Lambdadelta, Isokratia, and zkEmail were included.\n\nFurthermore, continued work on foundational protocols like halo2, Semaphore, and others was mentioned.\n\nThere was also funding for developer experience and tooling, such as Recovery Pulse for smart contract recovery.\n\nExecution Layer projects such as Fluffy light client were supported, as were Nethermind internships.\n\nFinally, there was funding for the Nimbus execution layer development and layer-2 Beacon Chain blockchain explorer.\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation ecosystem support program (ESP) continues to back the growing environment on crypto\u2019s largest smart contract network despite the ongoing bear market.\n\nETH Price Outlook\n\nIn related news, it was recently reported that former U.S. President Donald Trump holds between $250,000 and $500,000 worth of ETH. The content of his crypto wallet is likely to be tied to the sale of his self-themed NFT collection.\n\nUnfortunately for traders, there has been very little activity on Ethereum markets for the past few weeks.\n\nETH has dipped marginally on the day to trade at $1,826 at the time of writing. The asset is currently sitting at support levels in a sideways channel that it has been stuck in for almost two months.\n\nMoreover, ETH has not been below $1,800 since a brief dip in mid-June when the SEC unleashed its barrage of lawsuits targeting crypto exchanges. There is further support at $1,740 should the markets dip further this week.\n\nAnalysts have highlighted a number of bullish fundamentals for Ethereum, but markets have yet to respond."

        "title": "Should You Buy Ethereum While It's Still Below $2,000? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "For the year, Ethereum (ETH 0.59%) is up 45%. While that recent performance is impressive, there are still plenty of skeptics out there. After all, a a recent price of about $1,730, Ethereum is 64% below its all-time high of $4,892 from two years ago, and hasn't had the type of monster rally many investors were expecting when it completed The Merge, a system upgrade, last September.\n\nIn fact, Ethereum is trading at almost exactly the same price it was one year ago. And it has had unexpected difficulty breaking through the $2,000 price level. So is Ethereum undervalued or not? To answer that question, there are three important factors to consider.\n\nInnovation leader\n\nEthereum recently celebrated its eighth birthday, and it's fascinating to look back and see how far Ethereum has come in such a relatively short time. Ethereum has become the de facto benchmark standard that all other Layer-1 blockchains measure themselves against. There have been a large number of blockchains that have attempted to become \"the next Ethereum\" and failed -- and that list includes Cardano, Avalanche, and Solana.\n\nBy investing in Ethereum, you are investing in the innovation leader with a clear competitive advantage. Ethereum pioneered the concept of smart contracts for the blockchain and has consistently been first to market with new innovations. That includes the launch of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), new decentralized finance exchanges, and new gaming and metaverse experiences. Given Ethereum's track record of innovation, I'm confident that there's plenty of upside potential ahead.\n\nDiversification benefits\n\nAll of that innovation happening on the Ethereum blockchain means that the size and scope of the Ethereum ecosystem continues to grow. Ethereum still has the largest community of blockchain developers in the world, and the number of use cases for Ethereum continues to grow. For example, Wall Street firms are experimenting with Ethereum as a new form of payment network, while manufacturing companies are experimenting with Ethereum's blockchain technology to improve their supply chains.\n\nFrom my perspective, Ethereum is simply the most diversified crypto that you can own in your portfolio. You're not investing in a one-trick pony, and that is really the key to Ethereum's allure for both retail and institutional investors. That's an important consideration during volatile and uncertain market conditions, when diversification is the key to riding out the tough times.\n\nRoadmap for success\n\nOne other key consideration is that Ethereum has a roadmap for success, so you can see exactly where Ethereum has been, and where it's headed. After The Merge, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin unveiled an updated roadmap that includes five new distinct stages, known as the Surge, Scourge, Verge, Purge, and Splurge. Even if each of those stages only lasts six months, that's still a three-year strategic vision. If you're a buy-and-hold investor, that's exactly what you want to see: a long-term plan for success.\n\nWhen you dig into the specific milestones on Ethereum's roadmap, that's when things get really interesting. For example, the current phase of development (\"The Surge\") has a goal of boosting Ethereum's transaction processing abilities to 100,000 transactions per second. That's blazingly fast speed, even faster than the theoretical maximum speed of the Visa card payment network (65,000 transactions per second). Eventually, says Buterin, the goal is to hit 1 million transactions per second.\n\nWhat could possibly go wrong?\n\nInvesting in crypto can be risky and speculative, and it's no different with Ethereum. So, yes, there's actually quite a bit that could go wrong for Ethereum. The Securities and Exchange Commission, for example, might decide that Ethereum is actually a security, thereby sending it to crypto purgatory and upending future plans for development. There's also a risk that an upstart \"Ethereum killer\" might truly emerge, dooming Ethereum to the dustbin of history.\n\nBut, as noted above, Ethereum has a strong track record of innovation, growth, and diversification. At recent prices it seems remarkably undervalued. Just two years ago, Ethereum was trading for nearly $5,000. So I'm very confident buying Ethereum now, while it still seems to be trading at a discount. Over the long haul, Ethereum's upside potential is just too high to ignore."

        "content": "Is Ether the Same as Ethereum?\n\nCryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors often come across the terms Ethereum and Ether.\n\nHowever, there is a common misconception that these two terms are interchangeable.\n\nIn reality, Ethereum and Ether are distinct entities within the realm of digital currency.\n\nThis article aims to clarify the differences between Ethereum and Ether, providing a comprehensive understanding of their roles and functionalities in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.\n\nAlso read: Why are Ethereum Network Fees so High?\n\nSource: Forbes\n\nUnderstanding Ethereum\n\nWhat is Ethereum?\n\nEthereum is a blockchain-based platform that revolutionizes the way we interact with digital assets and decentralized applications (dApps).\n\nIt serves as a decentralized global platform for developers to create smart contracts and dApps without the need for intermediaries.\n\nEthereum\u2019s blockchain technology allows for secure, transparent, and tamper-proof transactions and operations.\n\nFeatures and Benefits of Ethereum\n\nDecentralization: Ethereum operates on a decentralized network of nodes, eliminating the need for a central authority or third-party intermediaries. This decentralized approach ensures transparency and reduces the risk of censorship or manipulation. Smart Contracts: Ethereum introduced the concept of smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. These contracts automatically execute transactions and enforce agreements without the need for intermediaries, offering efficiency and automation in various industries. Decentralized Applications (dApps): Ethereum provides a platform for developers to build decentralized applications that operate on the blockchain. These dApps leverage the security, transparency, and immutability of the Ethereum network while offering a wide range of functionalities and use cases. Interoperability: Ethereum allows for interoperability with other blockchain networks, enabling seamless integration and communication between different decentralized platforms. This interoperability expands the potential for collaboration and innovation within the cryptocurrency ecosystem.\n\nUnderstanding Ether\n\nSource: CNN\n\nWhat is Ether?\n\nEther (ETH) is the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum network.\n\nWhile Ethereum is the platform, Ether serves as the fuel that powers transactions and operations within the network.\n\nEther stands as a digital asset that is purchasable, tradable, and usable for investment, payments, and exchange trading.\n\nAlso read: Ethereum: Donald Trump Holds Up To $500k ETH\n\nFunctions and Uses of Ether\n\nPayment Method: Ether is used as a means of payment for on-chain transactions within the Ethereum network.\n\n\n\nWhen users initiate transactions or execute smart contracts on Ethereum, they need to pay gas fees, which are calculated in Ether. These gas fees compensate the network participants, including miners, for their computational resources and effort in securing the blockchain. Investment: Ether can be seen as a digital asset that individuals can invest in for potential capital appreciation. Similar to other cryptocurrencies, the value of Ether is subject to market fluctuations and can provide opportunities for investors to generate profits.\n\n\n\nYet, remember that engaging in cryptocurrency investments involves risks and requires prudent consideration. Trading: Ether is listed and traded on various cryptocurrency exchanges, allowing users to buy, sell, and trade the digital asset. Traders can take advantage of price movements and volatility in the cryptocurrency market to potentially profit from their trading activities. Medium of Exchange: Some merchants and online retailers accept Ether as a form of payment for goods and services.\n\n\n\nThe use of Ether as a medium of exchange provides an alternative to traditional fiat currency transactions, offering faster and more secure transactions, especially for cross-border payments.\n\nEther vs. Ethereum: The Differences\n\nIt is crucial to understand the distinction between Ethereum and Ether to avoid confusion. Ethereum refers to the blockchain-based platform that enables the creation of decentralized applications and smart contracts.\n\nOn the other hand, Ether is the specific cryptocurrency that operates within the Ethereum network.\n\nWhile Ethereum is the infrastructure, it also serves as the digital asset and means of value exchange within that infrastructure.\n\nConclusion: Is Ether the Same as Ethereum?\n\nIn summary, Ethereum and Ether are integral components of the cryptocurrency ecosystem, but they are not interchangeable terms.\n\nFurthermore, Ethereum is a blockchain-based platform that facilitates the development and deployment of decentralized applications and smart contracts. Ether, on the other hand, is the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum network, serving as a digital asset and payment method within the ecosystem.\n\nUnderstanding the distinctions between Ethereum and Ether is essential for anyone navigating the world of cryptocurrencies, enabling informed decision-making and participation in this evolving digital landscape."
