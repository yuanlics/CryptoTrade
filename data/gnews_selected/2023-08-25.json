        "content": "The total staked ETH was almost 28 million.\n\nStaked ETH currently makes up 21.8% of the total ETH supply.\n\nEthereum [ETH] staking has developed a distinct trajectory, separate from the price trends. As more of the circulating supply gets locked up in staking, one particular metric is experiencing a decline.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nEthereum staking on the rise\n\nRecent data from CryptoQuant indicated a steady upward trajectory in Ethereum\u2019s total staked value. As of this writing, nearly 28 million ETH were staked, in sharp contrast to the approximately 16 million ETH staked in January. This signified a substantial increase in staking volume.\n\nAccording to CryptoMarketCap, the total circulating supply of ETH had surpassed 120 million as of this writing. Additionally, data from Dune Analytics revealed that the staked portion constituted more than 21.8% of the total supply, implying that nearly 22% of the entire ETH supply was staked at press time.\n\nConsidering the daily staking rate, this proportion is anticipated to rise further. However, it\u2019s worth noting that while staking potential was on the rise, there was an opposing trend in the supply of ETH on exchanges.\n\nExchanges see less and less Ethereum\n\nIn January, the proportion of the entire Ethereum supply held on exchanges exceeded 11%. Nonetheless, this metric has undergone a substantial reduction in recent months.\n\nAs of this writing, the percentage of the circulating supply residing on exchanges hovered around 8.5%. Also, this shift signified a decrease from the January figure of over 13 million to approximately 10.7 million on exchanges.\n\nAdditionally, this reflected a scenario where an increasing number of holders were inclined to stake their ETH. Furthermore, it demonstrated that a smaller proportion opted to retain their holdings on exchanges.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ETHs worth today?\n\nETH volume sees a slight decline\n\nThe decline in Ethereum\u2019s supply on exchanges has had repercussions on its trading volume, as highlighted by Santiment. The volume chart revealed that while ETH was still experiencing a respectable trading volume, it paled compared to the volume recorded at the start of the year.\n\nAs of this writing, the trading volume was approximately 5 billion. Furthermore, this figure falls several billion short of the average volume exceeding 7 billion observed around January."

        "content": "Vitalik Buterin Confirms Post-Merge Ethereum Centralization Concerns, Urges Not to \u2018Overly Catastrophize\u2019 It\n\nVitalik Buterin. Source: a video screenshot, Lex Fridman / YouTube\n\nEthereum (ETH) co-founder Vitalik Buterin has said he is \u201cdefinitely\u201d worried about centralization risks following The Merge, the event when the current Ethereum Mainnet merges with the beacon chain proof-of-stake (PoS) system.\n\nThe Ethereum mastermind noted that Lido Finance, the largest provider of staking services for Ethereum, where around a third of staked ETH (stETH) has been deposited, could theoretically disturb the Ethereum network post-Merge.\n\n\u201cBut I also think it\u2019s important to not overly catastrophize the issue,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, if you have a third [of staked Ether deposits on the Beacon chain], you can\u2019t revert the chain or whatever,\u201d Buterin said in an interview with Fortune, adding:\n\n\u201cBut realistically, the worst that you could do is make finality stop happening for about a day or so, which is inconvenient, but it\u2019s not that terrible.\u201d\n\nButerin also mentioned that Lido does not act as a single entity but that \u201cthey have something like 21 delegates and nodes that are running these validators that are inside of Lido,\u201d he said, claiming that \u201cthere\u2019s a lot of good decentralization between them.\u201d\n\nLido is the largest provider of staking services for Ethereum. Generally, users who want to become Ethereum 2.0 validators and earn rewards need to stake a minimum of ETH 32, which is a high price.\n\nHowever, Lido enables users to pool their ETH and participate in staking even if they don\u2019t have the required ETH 32. The protocol distributes stETH tokens to users in return for their staked coins, which can be redeemed for ETH in the future or traded for other coins.\n\nThe Merge is Ethereum\u2019s long-anticipated update expected to happen by the end of the year.\n\nThe upgrade has several benefits, Buterin said, noting that it makes Ethereum more environmentally friendly compared to the current proof-of-work (PoW) mechanism. According to last year\u2019s estimate by a researcher at the Ethereum Foundation, this upgrade can cut the energy used by the Ethereum network by at least 99.95%.\n\n\u201cAlso, proof of stake can increase the safety of the system. It makes it more expensive to attack,\u201d Buterin told Fortune. \u201cIt makes it easier to recover from an attack, which is something people don\u2019t think about.\u201d\n\nAnother benefit is that PoS is more censorship-resistant. That is because, Buterin says, \u201cminers are easier to detect and easier to shut down than just computers that are running validator nodes.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, at 10:33 UTC, ETH is trading at USD 1,156, up by 3% over the past 24 hours and down 4% over the past 7 days. The coin is also down by more than 76% compared to its all-time high of USD 4,878 recorded in November last year.\n\n____\n\nLearn more:\n\n\u2013 Dominant Staking Pool Lido Causing \u2018Long Lasting\u2019 Damage to Ethereum, But Aims to Improve\n\n\u2013 Ethereum\u2019s Ropsten Test is \u2018Almost\u2019 Bug-Free, Two More Testnets to Go Before the Merge\n\n\n\n\u2013 Major Bitcoin & Crypto Companies Warn of \u2018Extreme\u2019 Risk in Proof-of-Stake Systems\n\n\u2013 The Compromises and Benefits of Ethereum Switching to a Proof-of-Stake Network\n\n\n\n\u2013 Contradictory Vitalik Buterin Says He Wants a More Bitcoin-like Ethereum\n\n\u2013 Top Blockchain Non-Financial Applications According to Vitalik Buterin\n\n\n\n\u2013 Ethereum Beacon Chain Experienced a 7-block Reorg, More Work Needed Ahead of The Merge\n\n\u2013 Ethereum\u2019s Merge Could Lower Demand for Bitcoin but Regulatory & Technical Challenges Persist"

        "title": "Is Ethereum (ETH) A Security Under US Law? - CCN.com",
        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nDetermining Ethereum\u2019s legal classification as a security will impact the cryptocurrency space, influence trading, issuance, and investment regulations.\n\nThe Howey Test defines asset security. Debate continues on Ethereum\u2019s classification.\n\nLegal clarity is vital to avoid regulatory uncertainty and to guide industry growth.\n\nEthereum\u2019s journey from ICO to decentralization has shaped its status.\n\nImportance Of Determining Ethereum\u2019s Legal Classification As A Security\n\nDetermining Ethereum\u2019s legal classification as a security is considered to be an important regulatory decision that would impact the cryptocurrency space. The reason is because securities laws affect regulations with trading laws, issuance laws, and investment practices.\n\nThe Howey Test, referenced by the Securities and Exchange Commision (SEC), defines whether an asset is a security. The outcome of this decision will also influence investor protection, market stability, and innovation in the crypto space.\n\nBackground On Securities And How Securities Are Regulated Under US Law\n\nThe regulation of crypto-assets, particularly in relation to securities is a complex issue. In general, securities sold or traded in the U.S. must be registered, and the registration process involves providing essential facts about the company\u2019s or cryptos properties, business, and the security itself.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s role includes minimizing compliance while ensuring investor protection. These regulations are designed to provide investors with access to relevant information about investments before and after investing, and to prevent conflicts of interest in the securities industry.\n\nDefinition Of Securities\n\nSecurities are fungible and tradable financial instruments to raise capital in both the public and private markets. Securities can include notes, stocks, bonds, certificates of interest, collateral trust certificates, and more. These instruments then serve as a means for individuals and entities to invest, speculate, and manage risk within the financial markets.\n\nThe term \u201csecurity\u201d covers a broad range of investments, and its definition can vary based on jurisdiction and context. Securities play a pivotal role in capital markets, enabling companies and governments to access funding while offering investors opportunities for potential returns and income.\n\nWhat Is The Howey Test? Explanation Of The Howey Test\n\nThe SEC is a U.S. government oversight agency responsible for regulating the securities markets and safeguarding investors. The SEC\u2019s jurisdiction extends to various aspects of financial markets, including investment banks, trading, financial dealings, product offerings, advertising, and fiduciary responsibilities.\n\nThe Howey Test is a legal framework used in the United States to determine whether a transaction qualifies as an investment contract and thus falls under securities regulations. The test originates from the landmark Supreme Court case SEC v. W.J. Howey Co in 1946.\n\nThe test consists of three main elements:\n\nAn investment of money,\n\nIn a common enterprise,\n\nWith an expectation of profits primarily from the efforts of others.\n\nIf these three elements are met, the transaction is considered a security, subject to the regulations set forth by SEC. The Howey Test serves as a fundamental guideline for classifying various financial arrangements and offerings in terms of whether they require compliance with securities laws and regulations, ensuring investor protection and transparency in financial markets.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Characteristics And SEC\u2019s Perspective On Ethereum\n\nEthereum is a decentralized blockchain platform known for its programmable smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps). It enables developers to build and deploy decentralized applications on its network, offering features like transparency, immutability, and trustlessness. Ethereum\u2019s native cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH), is used for transactions and to incentivize network participants.\n\nThe U.S. SEC has indicated that whether a particular cryptocurrency, like Ether, constitutes a security depends on its specific characteristics and how it is marketed and sold. The SEC has noted that if a cryptocurrency operates as a security , it falls under its regulatory jurisdiction, subject to applicable securities laws. The classification of cryptocurrencies like Ethereum is based on the Howey Test and other legal considerations to determine their status as securities or commodities, impacting their regulatory oversight and legal compliance.\n\nSEC\u2019s Statements and Actions Regarding Cryptocurrencies And Tokens\n\nThe U.S. SEC has actively engaged with the evolving landscape of cryptocurrencies and tokens through its statements and actions. The SEC\u2019s emphasis on investor protection and market integrity has led to a series of public statements clarifying its position on digital assets. It has consistently emphasized that whether a particular cryptocurrency or token qualifies as a security depends on the underlying facts and circumstances, with the Howey Test being a pivotal framework.\n\nOn July 25, 2017, the SEC released an investigative report addressing the treatment of digital assets, specifically tokens offered by \u201cvirtual\u201d organizations through distributed ledger or blockchain technology. The report emphasized that these assets, often marketed as \u201cInitial Coin Offerings\u201d (ICOs) or \u201cToken Sales,\u201d could fall under the scope of federal securities laws. The SEC\u2019s stance was whether an asset is a security depends on the factual and economic nature of the transaction rather than the terminology or technology employed.\n\nThe investigative report on the case of \u201cThe DAO,\u201d a virtual organization that offered and sold tokens. The SEC concluded that these tokens were securities, thereby subject to federal securities laws. The report underscored that entities issuing securities via distributed ledger or blockchain technology must adhere to registration requirements, unless a valid exemption applies.\n\nAdditionally, unregistered offerings and securities exchanges facilitating trading in these securities could face liabilities.While the SEC is open to innovative technologies, its measured approach underscores the need to balance innovation with the protection of investors and the integrity of the markets.\n\nExamination Of SEC\u2019s Stance On Ethereum\u2019s Status As A Security\n\nThe position on whether Ethereum\u2019s status is a security or not is not so well defined. While Ethereum initially launched through a token sale, the SEC\u2019s perspective has evolved over time. Former Chairman Jay Clayton highlighted that as Ethereum decentralized and its network matured, it might not fit the traditional definition of a security subject to securities regulations.\n\nThe determination hinges on whether the sale of Ether, Ethereum\u2019s native cryptocurrency, involved the investment of money in a common enterprise with an expectation of profits primarily from the efforts of others, the key elements of the Howey Test. The SEC\u2019s cautious and nuanced approach reflects its commitment to balance innovation and investor protection in the rapidly evolving digital asset landscape.\n\nContrary to initial concerns, Gary Gensler, head of the SEC, reportedly indicated in 2018, that he also doesn\u2019t view Ethereum as a security based on his interpretation of its historical issuance and network distribution. He referenced his earlier remarks from a 2018 lecture at MIT, where he emphasized that Ethereum was likely offered and sold as a security during its initial coin offering (ICO) phase.\n\nGensler\u2019s statement aligns with the idea that the initial sale of a token could be considered a security offering, but over time, if the token\u2019s network becomes sufficiently decentralized, it may no longer meet the criteria of a security. This view holds significance for Ethereum\u2019s regulatory treatment and could impact how other cryptocurrencies are evaluated by the SEC.\n\nAnalysis Of Speeches, Regulations, And Enforcement Actions Relevant To Ethereum\n\nThe analysis of speeches, regulations, and enforcement actions relevant to Ethereum, offers insight into the SEC\u2019s evolving stance. Various officials\u2019 speeches have indicated the importance of evaluating the underlying characteristics of a cryptocurrency and its manner of distribution to determine its regulatory status. The issuance of guidance, the establishment of a framework, and subsequent statements by SEC officials have further clarified its position.\n\nConclusion\n\nDetermining Ethereum\u2019s legal status as security is key for cryptocurrency regulation and market prices. The SEC\u2019s approach using the Howey Test emphasizes investor protection, market stability, and innovation. While Bitcoin is often seen as a commodity, Ethereum\u2019s classification remains debated.\n\nClarity is crucial to alleviate regulatory ambiguity, fostering industry growth. Understanding securities and the SEC\u2019s role is essential; they govern investment instruments and ensure market fairness. Ethereum\u2019s evolving journey from ICO issuance to a decentralized network shapes its status. Former and current SEC chairs, Clayton and Gensler, offer nuanced perspectives on the definition of Ethereum.\n\nFAQs\n\nWhat is the significance of determining Ethereum\u2019s legal classification?\n\nEthereum\u2019s classification impacts its regulatory treatment, influencing trading, issuance, and investment practices in the cryptocurrency space.\n\nHow does the Howey Test affect cryptocurrency regulation?\n\nThe Howey Test helps determine if a transaction qualifies as an investment contract, potentially subjecting it to securities regulations for investor protection.\n\nWhat is the SEC\u2019s role in regulating securities?\n\nThe SEC safeguards investors and maintains market fairness by overseeing securities markets, ensuring transparency, and preventing insider advantages.\n\nWhy is legal clarity important for cryptocurrencies like Ethereum?\n\nClear classification mitigates regulatory uncertainty, fostering industry development while balancing innovation and investor safeguarding in the digital asset landscape."
