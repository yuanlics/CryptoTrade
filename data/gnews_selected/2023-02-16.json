        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s native token, Ether (ETH), has printed a death cross technical pattern versus Bitcoin (BTC) for the first time since May, suggesting more pain ahead for ETH/BTC in the coming weeks.\n\nPrevious ETH price death cross preceded 27.5% drop\n\nA death cross appears when an asset\u2019s short-term 50-day moving average moves below its long-term 200-day moving average. Such a chart pattern was seen in December 2007, ahead of the global economic crisis.\n\nSimilarly, the ETH/BTC\u2019s previous death cross, in May, preceded an approximately 27.5% price correction, dropping in part as investors reduced exposure to altcoins and sought safety in Bitcoin amid the Terra collapse.\n\nETH/BTC daily price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe latest ETH/BTC death cross could lead to a similar short-term sell-off, primarily due to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s crackdown on crypto staking services. Staking is a key feature of many blockchains, including Ethereum.\n\nRelated: Why is Bitcoin price up today?\n\nMeanwhile, capital flows to and from Bitcoin and Ethereum-based funds also reveal BTC gaining the upper hand. Interestingly, Bitcoin-based investment funds have attracted $183 million in 2023 compared to Ethereum\u2019s $15 million, according to CoinShares\u2019 latest weekly report.\n\nNext targets for ETH/BTC\n\nThe next potential targets to watch for ETH/BTC are best visible on the weekly chart.\n\nNamely, the 0.067-0.065 BTC area, which has served as a strong support level in recent history. A successful rebound here could have ETH price rebound toward its multi-month descending trendline resistance (black) near 0.075 BTC.\n\nETH/BTC weekly price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nConversely, a decisive break below the 0.067-0.065 BTC range could have ETH enter an extended selloff toward the 200-week exponential moving average (200-week EMA; the blue wave) near 0.055 BTC, down about 20% from current price levels.\n\nNotably, the 200-week EMA served as a bottom to the November 2021-June 2022 bear cycle.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "A top analyst and trader is detailing the path forward for the two leading crypto assets, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH).\n\nStarting with Bitcoin, pseudonymous crypto analyst Altcoin Sherpa tells his 10,700 YouTube subscribers in a new video that if the flagship digital asset rises above the 2023 high of around $24,200, it would indicate that it is in a bullish phase.\n\n\u201cSo we consider this high around $24,000: if it breaks that area cleanly\u2026 like a solid break to like $26,000 or something at that point I think that we can see it coming back down, going higher and just continuing up\u2026 That, in my opinion, would be a clear bullish market structure at this point.\u201d\n\nThe pseudonymous crypto analyst and trader, however, says that a lower high would be a bearish indicator for Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cYou know, there\u2019s some bearish indicators where you know, if we hit a lower high, comes back up to say $22,000, $23,000 and then just brings us down or just breaks down here, obviously at that point we\u2019re just going to go down to $20,000.\u201d\n\nAccording to Altcoin Sherpa, Bitcoin could rally by over 30% from the current levels and then collapse to the 2022 low of under $16,000.\n\n\u201cTo be clear I actually don\u2019t really necessarily think the bottom is totally in. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if price continues higher, maybe to $25,000. I have always expected it going to $25,000 \u2013 $30,000 and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it goes to $30,000 eventually.\n\nBut it would make a lot of sense to me if price trades up to $25,000 to $30,000 and then comes back all the way down to $20,000 or something like that. Or $17,000. Or even $15,000.\u201d\n\nBitcoin is trading at $22,568 at time of writing.\n\nTurning to ETH, Altcoin Sherpa says that depending on Bitcoin\u2019s behavior, the second-largest crypto asset by market cap could surge by over 25% from the current levels.\n\n\u201cEthereum looks pretty strong overall. I really still am shooting for the highs around $2,000\u2026 I do believe personally that the $2,000 areas will come through as long as Bitcoin is steady.\u201d\n\nAccording to the pseudonymous crypto analyst, traders should wait for Ethereum to rise above the $1,700 resistance level before considering a long entry.\n\n\u201cBut still, would wait for a break of $1,600 \u2013 $1,700 before really considering the $2,000 area.\u201d\n\nEthereum is trading at $1,577 at time of writing.\n\nI\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.
