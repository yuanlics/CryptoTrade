At the moment, traders should focus on the bar's closure. If it happens around that area, the breakout may lead to a blast to the $1,870 zone shortly.\n\nImage by TradingView\n\nOn the bigger time frame, the price of ETH remains bearish as the rate has not bounced off far from the support level. In addition, the buying volume is low, which means that bulls are not ready yet to buy the coin.\n\nIn this regard, sideways trading between $1,850 and $1,870 is the more likely scenario until the end of the week.\n\nImage by TradingView\n\nA positive picture can be seen on the daily chart against BTC as the rate is closer to the resistance than to the support. If the price reaches the 0.064 mark and fixes there, one can expect a quicker test of the upper level of 0.06435.\n\nEthereum is trading at $1,859 at press time."

        "title": "Ethereum (ETH) Price Prediction: Buy Signal With 78% Accuracy Flashes - NewsBTC",
        "content": "After Ethereum (ETH) once again failed to break the $2,000 level in the 1-day chart, the price has been on a downward slide in recent days. However, this could now change, as a historically accurate trend indicator shows.\n\nCrypto traders and analysts constantly seek reliable indicators to navigate the turbulent market. One such indicator gaining attention is the Tom Demark 9 (TD9), which has flashed a buy signal for Ethereum (ETH) on the daily chart. Renowned analyst Joe McCann shared his insights via Twitter, revealing an intriguing success rate of 78% for ETH\u2019s historical TD9 buy signals.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Buy Signal\n\nJoe McCann\u2019s tweet brought the spotlight on ETHUSD\u2019s TD9 buy signal, which occurred after the asset dropped 8.7% from its recent high. The TD9 indicator, an indicator that also measures whether an asset is overbought or oversold, similar to the RSI, aims to identify potential trend reversals. According to McCann, historical data showcases the TD9 buy signal\u2019s remarkable accuracy for ETH, with a win rate of nearly 78%.\n\nPossible price targets include the July open at $1,933, the August 2022 bear market rally high at $2,031, and the year-to-date 2021 high at $2,142, according to the analyst.\n\nDigging deeper into the data, McCann highlights the impressive performance of ETH following TD9 buy signals. The statistics reveal that, on average, the asset surged by over 2.6% in the seven days following the signal, with a median return of almost 5%. These figures alone could pique the interest of traders looking for an edge in the crypto market.\n\nTo provide a more nuanced picture, McCann narrowed the data to examine the year 2019, a period he deems analogous to the 2023 crypto market cycle. The results are even more captivating, showing a remarkable win rate of nearly 90% for TD9 buy signals during this period.\n\nHowever, if we trim the data back to starting in 2019 (a year very similar to 2023 in terms of crypto market cycles), ETH has a win rate of nearly 90% with the average return over +7%.\n\nBut, as with any indicator, there are exceptions and occasional inaccuracies. McCann\u2019s data shows several instances where the TD9 buy signal failed to predict ETH\u2019s price movement accurately.\n\nNoteworthy is March 13, 2018, when the ETH price slid massively after the buy signal. The ETH price plummeted by 19.3% within seven days and by as much as 34.8% within the next 14 days. The signal was similarly bad on May 8, 2018, after which ETH fell by 22.1% in the following seven days and 26.7% in the following 14 days.\n\nOn the other hand, the TD9 buy signal has predicted some massive rallies. For example, on December 10, 2018, following the signal, ETH initially rose by 3.7% in the first seven days, but then came a fabulous 53.0% rise in 14 days and 64.5% in 30 days. The most recent TD9 buy signal on March 11, 20223 delivered a price increase of 18.8% in the first seven days and 29.9% after 30 days.\n\nIn general, it can be seen that the accuracy of the TD9 indicator decreases over time. While the indicator has a success rate of 78% in the first seven days with an average 7-day forward return of +2.65% and a median return of almost 5%, the success rate falls in the subsequent period of time. After 14 days, the TD9 indicator has a success rate of only 55.5% (mean 3.8%, median 5.7%), after 30 days of 63.0% (mean 6.9%, median 3.8%) since 2018.\n\nFederal Reserve Meeting Looms\n\nWhile the TD9 buy signal paints a positive picture for ETH, the crypto market remains vulnerable to external factors, including the upcoming FOMC meeting today. There is a 98.9% probability that there will be a 25 basis point rate hike. But the big question is whether this will be the last hike in this cycle. McCann writes:\n\nJuly 26th is the latest meeting of the Federal Reserve and Jerome Powell is expected to hike rates another 25 bps. Will Jerome Powell ruin the party for the ETH bulls at the press conference?\n\nAt press time, the Ether (ETH) price stood at $1,859.\n\nFeatured image from iStock, chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.
