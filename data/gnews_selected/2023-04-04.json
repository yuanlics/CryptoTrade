        "title": "Satellite orbiting Earth participates in the Ethereum KZG ceremony - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The Ethereum KZG ceremony, which aims to provide a cryptographic foundation for Ethereum scaling, has already had over 83,000 contributions of randomness from users all over the world. Now it\u2019s receiving a contributor from outer space.\n\nCryptosat, a blockchain-powered satellite orbiting Earth, announced its contribution of entropy from space on April 4 at 6 a.m. UTC. The contribution will be deployed from the Crypto2 satellite.\n\nAccording to the announcement from Cryptosat, the satellite orbits Earth every 90 minutes following a remote course 550 km above ground, which makes it difficult for outside actors to gain access during the KZG contribution.\n\nYan Michalevsky, the co-founder of Cryptosat, explained to Cointelegraph that the ceremony needs parties that can generate \u201ccryptographic parameters\u201d that don\u2019t leak what is called \"toxic waste,\u201d or intermediate computation artifacts that are discarded and inaccessible after being generated.\n\nMichalevsky continued that if leaked, this \u201ctoxic waste\u201d could compromise \u201cthe integrity of the cryptographic scheme\u201d on which the next version of Ethereum is based.\n\n\u201cThis is why generating those parameters in a completely physically isolated environment from which data cannot be extracted has a lot of merit.\"\n\nCryptosat has a Verifiable Random Beacon service, which will generate entropy for its contribution. Beacons from this service are signed by the satellite itself and can be verified using the public key of Crypto2, which was also generated in space.\n\n\u201cApart from using the API to it, we don't access the internals of the satellite or the data that is generated as part of the intermediate steps, and is kept secret on the satellite.\u201d\n\nThe commitment of entropy from Cryptostat\u2019s space satellite will be viewable in real-time via a dashboard monitoring the satellite\u2019s trajectory and latest status.\n\nRelated: Ethereum bulls ignore regulatory action against exchanges by preparing for the Shapella hard fork\n\nCryptosat is one of the thousands to participate in supplying randomness to the KZG ceremony, as requested by the Ethereum Foundation to strengthen security.\n\nThe satellite, Crypto2, was launched into space on Jan. 3 aboard the SpaceX Falcon 9. It was the successor to the first satellite launch of Crypto1 back in May. According to Cryptosat, the second satellite has 30x the computing power of the first one.\n\nPreviously the company said that blockchain-powered satellites are part of the effort to make outer space a \u201cnew battleground in the quest for bulletproof cryptography.\u201d\n\nThe Ethereum Shanghai upgrade to the mainnet, for which the entropy by Crypto2 is generated, is scheduled for April 12.\n\nMagazine: Blockchain fail-safes in space: SpaceChain, Blockstream and Cryptosat"

In May 2021, the British Virgin Islands High Court (Commercial Division) granted a worldwide freezing order prohibiting Svirsky and Donin from dealing with the assets of Tensigma Limited up to the value of $23 million.
