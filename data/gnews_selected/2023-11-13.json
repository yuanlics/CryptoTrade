        "title": "Solana Overtakes Ethereum By Active Users After 70% Spike - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "The number of daily active users on Solana overtook the Ethereum mainnet on Nov. 11 following a sharp uptick in activity.\n\nAccording to data to Artemix, Solana hosted 356,300 unique users on Saturday, surpassing Ethereum\u2019s nearly 330,000 by 10%. The milestone was driven by a sharp uptick in activity on Solana, with the network hosting only 208,000 active addresses on Nov. 7.\n\nFor comparison, Ethereum consistently hosted between 290,000 and 350,000 users daily over the majority of the past three months, with two brief spikes above 400,000 and a surge to more than 1M wallets.\n\nSolana Overtakes Ethereum By Active Users After 70% Spike\n\nThe milestone is the latest sign of Solana\u2019s recovery following last year\u2019s brutal bear and the fallout from the collapse of its major investor, FTX.\n\nThe price of SOL plummeted more than 96% from its November 2021 all-time high of $250 to less than $10 in January, according to CoinGecko. Active addresses on the network shrank 85% from 1.28M in May 2022 to around 200,000 this September, according to The Block.\n\nBut Solana refused to stay down, with the network outperforming the broader markets amid the recent cryptocurrency rally as evidenced by the recent surge in active addresses.\n\nThe price of SOL is up 145% in four weeks, beating out many rival digital assets by at least double. The total value locked in Solana-based DeFi protocols is up 62% over the same period, according to DeFi Llama, while NFT sales volume grew 35% in the past 30 days, according to Crypto Slam.\n\nThe move followed progress towards Solana's firedancer upgrade in the form of a testnet, and dissipating expectations that the FTX bankruptcy estate would soon offload large sums of SOL on the markets.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Layer 2s\n\nWhile some analysts have been quick to pronounce that Solana has flipped Ethereum by active users in response to the recent uptick in activity. However, the Ethereum ecosystem has expanded beyond its base-layer, with the majority of activity now taking place on Layer 2.\n\nAccording to data from Token Terminal, more than 800,000 users were active on the top seven Layer 2 networks over the past day combined. Coupled with the Ethereum mainnet, the data suggests more than 1M wallets were active across the Ethereum ecosystem. However, said data does not account for users operating the same wallet across multiple networks.\n\nAccording to L2beat, Layer 2 networks are driving 80% of activity in Ethereum\u2019s broader ecosystem, which is driving roughly 60 transactions per second.\n\nTo continue reading this as well as other DeFi and Web3 news, visit us at thedefiant.io"

        "title": "Cryptos surge as BlackRock Ethereum ETF plan is confirmed - Nasdaq",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) has again been making headlines and capturing the attention of crypto enthusiasts and traders. The popular digital currency has recently surged to levels not seen in almost eighteen months.\n\nSince taking out the $32,000 level of resistance near the end of October, the price of one bitcoin has surged to $38,000. The last time the bitcoin price traded near this level was over a year ago, in May 2022.\n\nBitcoin and another leading, popular digital currency, Ethereum (ETH), have also been in the headlines for reasons other than price surges. The world's largest asset manager, BlackRock, recently filed for an Ether exchange-traded fund. This move created further optimism that the crypto markets could see greater access, more significant institutional involvement, and liquidity.\n\nSo, as the price leading cryptocurrency\u2019s trade higher in part due to the potential of a regulated exchange-traded product tied to the spot price of Ethereum, it\u2019s worth looking closer at some individual stocks tied to digital currency and also noting where the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) stands with regards to approving a Bitcoin ETF.\n\nBlackRock takes steps toward launching Ethereum ETF\n\nBlackRock has officially confirmed its plans for a spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) through a filing with the SEC. The filing, submitted by Nasdaq on behalf of BlackRock, proposes an ETF named the \"iShares Ethereum Trust.\" This move signifies BlackRock's intention to expand its ETF offerings beyond Bitcoin, marking a significant step in its cryptocurrency investment strategy.\n\nThe filing comes after BlackRock registered the corporate entity \"iShares Ethereum Trust\" in Delaware, hinting at the imminent submission of a spot Ether ETF filing. Several financial firms, including BlackRock, have shown interest in cryptocurrency-backed ETFs, with at least five firms vying for SEC approval for a spot Ethereum ETF, according to Bloomberg\u2019s James Seyffart.\n\nSpeculation grows about the SEC approving a spot Bitcoin ETF\n\nSpeculation is growing about the SEC approving a spot Bitcoin ETF. Analysts have estimated a January approval at the earliest, emphasizing the SEC's cautious stance. Recent speculation suggests potential decisions on applications from BlackRock and Fidelity, but the SEC extended the timeline for the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF to Jan. 10.\n\nSo, as speculation grows and the price for several popular digital currencies surges, here\u2019s a list of four crypto-related stocks that could see rapid price appreciation should breaking news occur.\n\nFour crypto-related stocks to keep an eye on\n\nMarathon Digital (NASDAQ: MARA)\n\nMara is a Las Vegas-based digital asset technology company. The company specializes in blockchain-based mining and produces digital assets such as Bitcoin. Shares of the crypto company have skyrocketed this year, up about 180%. However, the stock has failed to join the latest crypto uptrend and, over the previous three months, fell almost 36%.\n\nMicroStrategy (NASDAQ: MSTR)\n\nMicroStrategy is a global provider of enterprise analytics software and services. MicroStrategy is actively involved with Bitcoin, holding and acquiring the cryptocurrency as part of its strategic investment strategy. As of November 1, 2023, MicroStrategy possesses 158,400 bitcoins, acquired at an average purchase price of $29,609.65 per bitcoin, resulting in a total investment of $4.69 billion.\n\nCoinbase Global (NASDAQ: COIN)\n\nCoinbase Global is a major cryptocurrency exchange offering tools for trading over 200 cryptocurrencies. COIN shares have performed exceptionally on the year by any standard, up almost 163% and recently rallying double-digits off key support in the $70s. However, analysts are not bullish on the stock, with a consensus Hold rating and a price target of $75.64, predicting almost 19% downside.\n\nRiot Platforms (NASDAQ: RIOT)\n\nRiot is a U.S. blockchain technology company that strives to be the premier provider of Bitcoin mining services in North America. The company offers cryptocurrency mining hardware, hosting services, and proprietary software. Shares of RIOT have impressed this year, to say the least, up 205%. However, the stock has failed to catch a bid off the recent sector headlines and has fallen almost 32% over the previous three months.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "title": "Tokenum Unveils Innovative Gasless Platform for the Ethereum Blockchain - A Game-Changer for the World of ... - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Tokenum\n\nTOKYO, JAPAN, Nov. 13, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --\n\nTokenum, a pioneering cryptocurrency platform, is proud to introduce its groundbreaking \"gasless technology.\" This revolutionary innovation simplifies cryptocurrency transactions and token offerings on the Ethereum blockchain, ushering in a new era of user-friendly accessibility.\n\nThe platform has already embarked on alpha testing, with an accelerated beta version scheduled for release within a week.\n\nRevolutionary Technology\n\nTokenum's gasless technology marks a significant advancement in the cryptocurrency landscape for several compelling reasons.\n\n1) Innovative Gas-free Transactions\n\nIn traditional banking, transaction fees are paid using the same currency that is being transacted. However, in the world of cryptocurrency, fees are often paid in another, blockchain-specific digital currencies. Such fees are referred to as \"gas.\" Tokenum's gasless technology eliminates the need for users to grapple with this complex concept, making cryptocurrency more accessible to a broader audience.\n\n2) Supercharged Token Sales\n\nNew cryptocurrency projects face various challenges, including scheduling, legal compliance, compatible wallets, and sale regulations. Additionally, for users to participate in project sales, users must first acquire specific coins to cover blockchain gas fees. Tokenum's gasless technology simplifies this process, making it easier for crypto projects to attract users and maximize revenue from each sale.\n\n3) NFT Industry Transformation\n\nTokenum's gasless technology presents an opportunity to reshape the NFT industry. NFT creators and owners can now prepay for NFT transfers, removing the burden of gas payments for users. This opens the door to entirely new audiences and streamlines the process, making it as effortless as managing digital art on Instagram or Pinterest.\n\n4) Removal of Entry Barriers for New Ecosystems\n\nTokenum also benefits new blockchains by allowing users to leverage the tokens they already have, eliminating the need to acquire blockchain-specialized coins for different networks and ecosystems. This significantly simplifies the sophisticated process of navigating and using new blockchains, platforms, or even metaverses.\n\nStory continues\n\nAll Gas No Brakes and Light-Years Ahead\n\nOne of the most notable aspects of Tokenum is its current full-fledged operational status. While other industry players, such as Circle Inc., Auros, 0xGasless, Open Zeppelin, and more, are still in the developmental stages, Tokenum is live and fully functional on the Ethereum network. The platform's future plans include expanding its support to encompass additional networks.\n\nThe AI-Powered CEO Behind Tokenum\n\nTokenum's powerful technology is spearheaded by a distinctive team, represented by Takeshi Tokenai, an AI-powered CEO. Notably, Takeshi was formally appointed as the leader on July 1, 2021, making him the world's first AI CEO. Conversely, Tokenum's technological prowess is underpinned by the collective expertise of its international team, boasting two decades of experience in the realms of cybersecurity, high technology, and blockchain. When asked to share their comments on the matter, Takeshi Tokenai's only statement was: \"Tokenum is here to take the crypto world by storm.\"\n\nWhat Lies Ahead\n\nIn summary, Tokenum's gasless technology is reshaping the cryptocurrency landscape by simplifying transactions, facilitating token sales, and supporting the growth of new blockchains. Now the project is already integrated with CyberWallet, the one of the most secure wallets at the market, and HyperID, the single identity solution. Together, they creates seamless entrance to any web3 project, space or activity for any user, regardless of their crypto skills. Tokenum is poised to become a major player in the future of cryptocurrency.\n\nCurrently, the company is offering giveaways and opportunities on its X channel (formerly Twitter), as well as on Zealy and QuestN, prominent crypto-community platforms. In the cryptocurrency world, such initiatives often signal preparations for rapid expansion and the potential launch of their own token.\n\nFor further updates and insights, please visit Tokenum's official website: https://tokenum.net\n\n\n\nJoin the conversation on Tokenum's X channel (formerly Twitter) by following @tokenum\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor more information, press inquiries, or collaboration opportunities, please contact:\n\nTakeshi Tokenai at info (at) tokenum.net\n\nDisclaimer: The information provided in this press release is not a solicitation for investment, or intended as investment advice, financial advice, or trading advice. It is strongly recommended that you practice due diligence (including consultation with a professional financial advisor) before investing in or trading securities and cryptocurrency.\n\nCONTACT: Takeshi Tokenai info at tokenum.net\n\n\n\n"
