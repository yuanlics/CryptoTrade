        "content": "As the photography business increases its footprint in the Web3 space, Canon USA is preparing to launch a brand-new NFT marketplace, \u201cCadabra,\u201d focused on photography. Following a successful NFT drop in 2022, this is Canon\u2019s first significant entry into the Web3 market.\n\nVarious kinds of tokenized photographs will be available on the Cadabra marketplace. Participating artists can sell tangible prints of their work, giving them new sources of income. Canon will fill orders for these prints, and the market will accept payments made with credit/debit cards and cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe Cadabra marketplace will offer initial drops of photo collections and a secondary resale market. Additionally, it makes priceless and one-of-a-kind digital artworks available to collectors.\n\nCanon will debut the marketplace later in 2023 after previewing it at the NFT NYC conference this week. The Cadabra marketplace will compete with Other photographic NFT marketplaces like Quantum Art and Sloika.\n\nBoth Isaac \u201cDrift\u201d Wright (\u201cWhere My Vans Go?\u201d) and Justin Aversano (\u201cTwin Flames\u201d) have produced significant photo NFT collections which can help them get featured on Cadabra.\n\nThe photographers that Canon will showcase on the site are still a mystery. However, the corporation has promised various genres, such as landscapes, sports, animals, and lifestyle. The growth of NFTs has offered collectors access to rare and valuable digital artworks and new money streams for artists."

        "content": "A widely followed crypto analyst says that an Ethereum-based (ETH) altcoin looks set to hit new all-time highs after rising 190% in 2023.\n\nPseudonymous trader Smart Contracter tells his 222,300 Twitter followers that layer-2 scaling solution Optimism (OP) will likely end up making all-time highs after breaking out from weeks of consolidation inside an ascending triangle pattern.\n\n\u201cBeautiful ascending triangle breakout on OP after weeks of sideways/accumulation.\n\nAlso like how all the moves down from the highs are corrective three-wave moves.\n\nI think this one ends up making all-time highs.\u201d\n\nOP is trading for $2.64 at time of writing, an 8.16% gain on the day and about a 190% increase since the start of the year.\n\nThe crypto strategist then turns his sights on the peer-to-peer payments network Litecoin (LTC).\n\nSmart Contracter says that he missed out on the opportunity to capitalize on the latest Bitcoin (BTC) rally because he made an error and sold during a period of low volatility, but now he\u2019s looking to accumulate Litecoin as he believes the altcoin is flashing a bullish signal against the crypto king (LTC/BTC).\n\n\u201cMissed this most recent BTC impulse as I got shook out during low [volatility] Easter break (rookie mistake). Now looking to chase alts with good BTC pair setups, and I think LTC is one of them. I think LTC/BTC is very close to a reversal and higher low on daily.\u201d\n\nThe LTC/BTC pair is currently trading at 0.003148 ($95.64).\n\nSmart Contracter then turns his attention toward the leading smart contract platform Ethereum. According to the trader, the fear surrounding the platform\u2019s new Shanghai update, which now allows users to withdraw their staked ETH, is not warranted. He also believes the top altcoin is flashing vibes of Bitcoin\u2019s price action in 2019 when the crypto king surged by about 300% in a few months.\n\n\u201cStill think people are completely overreacting about the ETH Shanghai unlock and all I\u2019m getting is 2019 vibes.\u201d\n\nETH is trading for $2,095 at time of writing, a nearly 1.5% decrease during the last 24 hours.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Blockchain security tech firm BlockSec has launched a new toolkit that enables collaborative testing on private chains \u201cforked from arbitrary (transaction) positions\u201d and block numbers on the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nThe developer and security researcher-focused toolkit is dubbed the \u201cPhalcon Fork\u201d and launched on April 14.\n\nWe're thrilled to introduce Phalcon Fork, a cutting-edge toolkit for Web3 developers & security researchers! It enables collaborative testing with private mainnet states, creating private chains forked from any mainnet position. #Web3 #DeFi pic.twitter.com/TlK169GeLP \u2014 BlockSec (@BlockSecTeam) April 14, 2023\n\nPhalcon Fork aims to provide greater control over work being conducted on testnets, such as transaction testing, analysis and debugging.\n\nIn the user manual, BlockSec touts that this extra control comes from being able to easily \u201cfork arbitrary (transaction) positions and block numbers,\u201d and retain certain \u201cservices and states\u201d from the Ethereum mainnet.\n\n\u201cCompared with traditional solutions like Goerli [...], Phalcon Fork has the following advantages: retain services and states from the mainnet, facilitating rapid integration and debugging with other DeFi contracts. [And maintain] full control over block information (e.g., Timestamp, BaseFee, MixDigest),\u201d the Phalcon Fork user manual reads.\n\nWith the toolkit, users can also utilize features such as snapshots, enabling them to save certain blockchain positions and revert back to them at will during their testing processes. The snapshots essentially record the transactions being executed and deployed by the user at a given time.\n\n\u201cThe snapshot feature is particularly useful in the following two scenarios: When a user wants to run multiple times of a testing script, he/she just needs to revert to the original snapshot and rerun the script. [Or] When a user wants to save some states and return to them later, he/she can create a snapshot and then revert to this snapshot later,\u201d the manual reads.\n\nPhalcon Fork also has an integrated faucet so users can acquire free fork network Ether (ETH) to conduct transactions on the private chains.\n\nTo directly interact with the chains and execute transactions, Phalcon Fork provides a remote procedure call node called Fork RPC, which can be integrated with Ethereum Virtual Machine-compatible development frameworks such as Hardhat, Foundry and Remix or added to MetaMask.\n\nAs it stands, users can only fork from the Ethereum mainnet; however, future support for additional blockchains, such as the BNB Smart Chain and Arbitrum, has been teased.\n\nTeased blockchain support additions. Source: Twitter\n\nApril has been a significant month for Ethereum developers, given that the highly anticipated Shapella hard fork went live on the Ethereum mainnet without a hitch on April 12. A major feature of the upgrade enables Ethereum validators to withdraw staked ETH from the Beacon Chain.\n\nRelated: Less than 1% of staked ETH estimated to be sold after Shapella: Finance Redefined\n\nThe move has been met with positive price action from Ether (ETH), with the asset gaining roughly 12% since April 12, to sit at $2,092 at the time of writing.\n\nSeven-day ETH price chart.

        "title": "Testnets in Crypto: How To Use Test Networks to Earn Cryptocurrency - DailyCoin",
        "content": "Testnets are the unsung heroes of the crypto world. Every time a shiny new blockchain, cryptocurrency, or dApp goes live, it\u2019s almost guaranteed that it has already existed for months on a test network.\n\nLike a shadowy vigilante, testnets expose hidden vulnerabilities and protect the cryptocurrency ecosystem. What many people don\u2019t know about testnets is that there is a litany of benefits to using and exploring them, even if you\u2019re not a developer.\n\nHow is something designed to be valueless so valuable?\n\nWhat are blockchain testnets? Why should everyone use them, and how can I get started?\n\nWhat are Testnets?\n\nA testnet is a valueless, low-risk sandbox environment similar to a main network. Blockchain engineers and smart contract developers use testnets to trial the functionality of their protocols and decentralized applications before deploying them on a mainnet or live blockchain.\n\nBecause a testnet is a separate ledger from its main network, all coins and tokens have no value. Regardless of the market price of Bitcoin (BTC), testnet bitcoin should always be worth $0. As a result, all transaction fees on a testnet are essentially free.\n\nThis is important for DeFi developers on networks like Ethereum (ETH), infamous for expensive gas fees. The Ethereum testnet enables developers to send thousands of transactions for free, which would normally cost tens of thousands of dollars.\n\nWhat Is the Purpose of Test Networks?\n\nThe main purpose of a testnet is to trail contracts and applications in a free environment. This helps developers ensure their applications run smoothly but also helps expose vulnerabilities and potential security issues.\n\nCybersecurity attacks in the crypto space are commonplace, with the on-chain world of DeFi and NFTs being particularly hazardous. White-hat hackers and security auditors use blockchain testnets to find potential faults before contracts get deployed on the mainnet, where an exploit could cost developers, and users like you and me, millions of dollars.\n\nThe cost of failure of a main network like Ethereum or XRP could be devastating. Hence, developers need a secure, valueless environment to make mistakes and break things safely before the public uses them.\n\nDo Testnet Coins Have Any Value?\n\nRemember when I said earlier that testnet coins have no value? The truth is, it\u2019s not so black and white.\n\nDevelopers still need testnet coins, like Goerli Ethereum (gETH), to pay \u2018transaction fees\u2019 on the testnet. That means they still have some demand from developers testing decentralized applications.\n\nTestnet coins are collected from faucets, or free sites that \u2018drip\u2019 small amounts of test cryptocurrency into a testnet wallet. During periods of high demand, these faucets actually empty their supply of testnet coins, making them a hot commodity on the crypto market. For a brief moment, gETH was trading at over $1.\n\nIn February, a bridge opened between the Goerli Ethereum Testnet and the Ethereum Mainnet. Developers needing gETH can buy testnet Ethereum if the faucets are empty or unavailable.\n\nYou can\u2019t trade gETH on a crypto exchange like Binance or Coinbase, but decentralized exchanges like UniSwap aren\u2019t bound by the same restrictions as their centralized alternatives.\n\nThis was great news for developers and testnet faucet farmers who\u2019ve been collecting gETH for free over time. In fact, one savvy player could even play a Cryptopunk NFT worth over $100,000 with gETH they accumulated for free.\n\nUltimately, testnet coins are intended to be free for everyone and have zero value on the market. That doesn\u2019t mean that there is no demand and that testnet crypto is worthless.\n\nWhy You Should Use a Testnet, Even If You\u2019re Not a Blockchain Developer\n\nEven if buying a Cryptopunk for free isn\u2019t enough of an incentive, the non-developers out there might be thinking:\n\n\u2018That\u2019s all very interesting, but what does that mean for me, a humble crypto enthusiast?\u2019\n\nThere are plenty of benefits to using a testnet, even if you aren\u2019t building dApps or designing blockchains. Many emerging crypto projects ask community members to trial products on a testnet in exchange for rewards, like token airdrops.\n\nFor example, the Aptos Incentivized Testnet gave anywhere between 150-300 APT tokens to selected users who operated a node validator or minted an NFT on their testnet. These tasks didn\u2019t take long to complete, and participants could claim an airdrop worth over $5,000 at Aptos\u2019 all-time high price.\n\nHow Do I Access A Testnet?\n\nThe good news is that accessing a blockchain testnet is easy. Metamask is a great open-source testnet wallet for any EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) network, like Polygon.\n\nAll you need to do is visit a trusted site like Chainlist and connect your wallet. Then, check the box to \u2018Include Testnets\u2019 and search for your chosen network, and the site will automatically configure your testnet account for you.\n\nWhich Blockchain Networks Have a Testnet?\n\nAlmost every blockchain in the cryptocurrency industry uses a testnet of some description. That includes leading Layer-1 networks like Solana and Cardano.\n\nSome networks, like Ethereum, have multiple different test networks for different areas of development. You must make sure you\u2019re connecting to the right network for your specific testing requirements, or else you might run into some errors.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nBlockchain testnets are an obscure area of the crypto industry. As a result, you may find the occasional scammer who will try and confuse you into sending your real crypto for valueless testnet coins.\n\nAs always, take extra care when exploring the possibilities of a blockchain testnet and never give anyone your crypto or seed phrase.\n\nWhy You Should Care\n\nEven if you\u2019re not a developer, using a blockchain testnet can make you eligible for generous airdrops and give you a better understanding of how certain blockchains and decentralized applications work for free.\n\nFAQs"
