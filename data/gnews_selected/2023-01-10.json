        "content": "A leading analytics firm says that crypto trader sentiment surrounding Cardano (ADA) and Binance Coin (BNB) suggests that both assets could be poised for rallies.\n\nSantiment notes that the crypto community has a bearish sentiment regarding both Ethereum (ETH) competitors, compared to a bullish crowd outlook on ETH and payments network XRP.\n\n\u201cWith crypto market caps bouncing very much in independent directions, we\u2019re seeing notably euphoric crowd sentiment on XRP and ETH. Traders are less interested in BTC, BNB, and ADA. Historically, bearish sentiment projects perform better on average.\u201d\n\nADA is trading at $0.311 at time of writing. The eighth-ranked crypto asset by market cap is down more than 6% in the past 24 hours.\n\nBNB is changing hands at $272.49 at time of writing. The fourth-ranked crypto asset by market cap is down over 2% in the past day.\n\nSantiment says the altcoin price rallies that happened over the weekend went against crowd expectations, which the firm says is a common occurrence.\n\n\u201cAs we have seen time and time again, markets move in the direction of the crowd\u2019s unlikeliest expectation.\u201d\n\nSantiment also notes that crypto trading volume has hit its lowest level in over two years.\n\nExplains the analytics firm,\n\n\u201cThere are two ways of looking at crypto\u2019s 2.5-year low level of trading volume:\n\nLess resistance and sell walls, leading to whales pumping prices easily\n\nUtility is limited with less order book activity, which could cap long-term bull run potential.\u201d\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Ethereum layer-2 rollups Arbitrum and Optimism have seen an uptick in their daily transactions over the past few months. Ethereum, meanwhile, is seeing a slight downtrend.\n\nArbitrum and Optimism are optimistic rollups designed to reduce the cost of transactions for the use of Ethereum dapps.\n\nBoth platforms have seen an uptick in daily active users recently, data compiled by Blockworks Research shows, with Optimism recently overtaking Arbitrum for daily active addresses and transactions per day.\u200b\u200b\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nMartin Lee, data journalist at Nansen, told Blockworks that as time goes by, these ecosystems are becoming more developed \u2014 which may be one of the reasons as to why they are seeing a spike in active users and transactions.\n\n\u200b\u201dDeFi protocols GMX for example is one of the key protocols driving Arbitrum\u2019s active users and transactions,\u201d Lee said. \u201cSushiswap\u2019s activity on Arbitrum is seeing an increase as well due to the recent spike and revival of MAGIC,\u201d a gaming-related token.\n\nThe number of transactions on Arbitrum has been steadily increasing since its Nitro upgrade in August, information on blockchain analytics platform Nansen shows.\n\nThis upgrade, which was completed prior to the Ethereum Merge, increased Arbitrum\u2019s throughput capacity by more than 7-to-10 times that of the Ethereum mainnet \u2014 hastening transaction speeds and reducing costs and requirements to run nodes.\n\nThese improvements may also be the reason why many new projects have decided to launch on Arbitrum.\n\nSome of the most recent projects that have been onboarded to the network include: Bebop DEX, which specializes in one-to-many and many-to-one token trading; automated money flow provider Cask Protocol; on chain-asset management platform Factor; and NFT platform OpenSea.\n\nIn the case of Optimism, Lee says that, \u201cwe\u2019re seeing a similar trend where DeFi protocols are one of the key drivers of adoption of the chain \u2014 Perpetual Protocol, Velodrome, Pika Protocol. Another key driver for both chains is Galxe, the on-chain identity and credentials project.\u201d\n\nThe ecosystems also have the two highest total value locked (TVL) across all layer-2 networks, with Arbitrum having a TVL of $2.34 billion, making up over 52% of the entire market share. Optimism has a TVL of $1.27 billion, totaling almost 30% of the entire market share, according to L2beat data.\n\nArbitrum does not yet have its own governance token, but Optimism\u2019s OP token has posted double-digit gains since the start of 2023.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "BitDAO has launched the testnet for its modular Ethereum Layer 2 network project called Mantle with 37,000 developers already signed up for the launch, the DAO stated on Tuesday.\n\nDubbed \u201cWadsley,\u201d the testnet will enable Mantle to test and implement new features for the chain before the mainnet launch scheduled for later in the year. The testnet is available to the public and developers have been urged to sign up to test their apps on the chain.\n\nBitDAO announced Mantle in November as a modular Ethereum Layer 2 network. Modular networks have separate layers for handling network functions such as consensus, transaction execution and settlement. They are a newer take on blockchain design that is different from older monolithic chains where all network functions occurred on the same base layer.\n\nBitDAO\u2019s announcement on Tuesday reiterated that Mantle will deliver faster finality at cheaper transaction costs. The chain will also utilize multi-party computation, the announcement added. This type of computation sees the use of nodes specially designed to handle off-chain transactions correctly. Multi-party computation is one of the ways Layer 2 networks try to minimize the risk involved in transactions executed outside the base layer of a blockchain network.\n\nBitDAO token utility\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nThe Mantle launch is also expected to boost the utility of BitDAO\u2019s governance token, called bit. This is because bit will function as the native token of the Layer 2 network. Improving bit utility has become a major focus for the DAO. The community voted in favor of a $100 million token buyback in December 2022.\n\nA BitDAO spokesperson told The Block that using bit as the native token for Mantle will foster the growth of the DAO\u2019s ecosystem. BitDAO is an outlier in the DAO space as it is set up to support a single DeFi project as is the case with most DAOs. Instead, BitDAO is an investment DAO that seeks to grow its ecosystem by supporting a network of projects. It holds the second-largest treasury among DAOs with $1.9 billion currently in its reserves.\n\n\u201cA large ecosystem of partners already exists and will continue to grow within BitDAO. Mantle is the blockchain that binds all of this together and helps build value for each moving part,\u201d said a BitDAO spokesperson."

        "content": "A handful of Ethereum-based layer-2 projects have been on a tear in the past week, with some of the sector\u2019s associated token prices now up considerably in year-to-date (YTD) terms.\n\nTraders are now speculating on a March launch of the next major Ethereum upgrade, dubbed Shanghai, which would enable the withdrawal of staked ether from validators, a planned change that has been anticipated move from industry participants since the Merge.\n\n\u201cVolatility has been at its lowest in the crypto market in the past weeks,\u201d David Cicoria, head of quantitative development at crypto custodian Hex Trust, told Blockworks. \u201cThis coupled with the announcement of lower interest rates, Ethereum\u2019s upcoming Shanghai upgrade, and FOMO from some investors has pushed prices up for layer-2 tokens.\u201d\n\nAs such, several projects built around Ethereum are posting double-digit gains including the open protocol \u2014 aimed at decentralized exchange order books \u2014 Loopring whose token, LRC, is up more than 18% YTD.\n\nOptimism, an EVM-compatible optimistic rollup chain that batch transactions before settling to Ethereum\u2019s mainnet, has seen its OP token rise more than 25% over the same period. Daily transactions for the network hit an all-time high on Monday, etching just below 700,000.\n\nRival optimistic rollup Arbitrum\u2019s daily transaction count has been ranging between 200,000 and 400,000, per data from Nansen.\n\nEthereum liquid staking solution Lido DAO\u2019s token, LDO, is also up an eye-watering 80% since the new year and has continued to post considerable gains in the past week, clocking a 65% gain when viewed over a seven-day period. The project now stands as a top contender for total value locked at $6.5 billion, DeFiLlama data show.\n\nAnd layer-2 scaling solution designed for NFTs using zero-knowledge rollup (zk-rollup) technology, Immutable X, is flashing 23% gains on its token since the new year began.\n\nThe sector seeks to increase the value of Ethereum and related networks by reducing fees, improving scalability and bolstering transaction throughput \u2014 often a gripe levied at blockchain infrastructure that optimizes for security and decentralization.\n\nIt comes as digital assets have continued to struggle under the weight of an industry-wide blowout courtesy of FTX in the fourth quarter of 2022, as well as recent questions hanging over Digital Currency Group and its subsidiaries.\n\nThe spot market for most digital assets also experienced a brief reprieve on Monday, sending the price of bitcoin higher on the day, establishing itself above the pivotal $17,000 level.\n\nNone of this impresses Bitcoin maximalists like Samson Mow, Founder and CEO of Pixelmatic, who instead anticipate a market rebound to finally take shape courtesy of bitcoin\u2019s next halving event.\n\n\u201cEthereum and its layer two tokens are created and tweaked to bring hype and price movement to satiate high-time preference speculators,\u201d Mow told Blockworks. \u201cNone of it is very interesting to Bitcoiners.\u201d\n\nCicoria also remains skeptical of the latest upturn: \u201cThe crypto market remains fragile, with a lot of unknowns still to consider.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."
