        "content": "XPPL Labs has made a breakthrough in its efforts to enhance XRP Ledger and establish it as a strong competitor to Ethereum. Its most recent accomplishment involves the successful conclusion of a comprehensive security audit on the Hooks amendment, a vital element that will expand the range of services available to users.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn partnership with cybersecurity firm FYEO, the cutting-edge framework underwent an external security evaluation. The primary aim of this audit was to obtain an impartial assessment of the overall security status of the amendment and identify any potential risks or vulnerabilities.\n\nThe assessment was conducted remotely from Jan. 31 to March 14, 2023, and the results were extremely positive. XRPL Labs has reported that no significant security issues were uncovered. Although a few moderate and several minor issues were detected, the team of developers promptly addressed and resolved them.\n\nWhat is the point?\n\nAccording to Wietse Wind, a prominent ecosystem developer, Hooks play a pivotal role in bridging the gap between XRPL and Ethereum. This amendment allows for the creation of customized logic and automation within the core ledger, granting transactions increased intelligence and convenience.\n\nBy incorporating the amendment, users gain the ability to add tailored on-ledger functionalities, exercise control over transaction flow, generate new transactions and retrieve information from the ledger. Hooks brings smart contract capabilities to XRP Ledger's foundational layer, significantly enhancing the ecosystem's inherent capabilities."

        "content": "The United States Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) lawsuit against Binance \u2014 accusing the crypto exchange of violating various securities laws \u2014 has directly impacted the crypto market and the exchange\u2019s balance sheet.\n\nAccording to data from crypto analytic firm Nansen, Binance saw negative netflows of over $778 million on the Ethereum blockchain, with $871 million of inflows dominated by $1.6 billion flowing out of the exchange.\n\nAs of 9.15 am UTC at the time of writing, in the 24 hours since the SEC charges, Ethereum-based tokens have seen negative netflows, with $14.8 million of assets flowing in and $50.5 million worth of assets flowing out of the exchange in the past hour alone.\n\nBinance netflow on Ethereum. Source: Nansen\n\nBinance\u2019s reserve assets had a net outflow of approximately $1.4 billion in the first hour after news broke of the SEC\u2019s charges, amounting to 2.6% of its total reserve assets of $52.9 billion.\n\nThe outflow of funds from Binance across all protocols has reached $999 million in the past 24 hours. Deteriorating confidence in Binance, on the other hand, has helped OKX become a preferred destination for traders, with the exchange registering a significant inflow of over $190 million.\n\nBinance outflows accelerate. Source: DefiLlama\n\nCompared with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission\u2019s lawsuit against Binance in March, the recent net outflow is substantial but smaller. The same goes for December 2022, when Binance experienced large outflows in the wake of the FTX collapse. Additionally, the net outflows are still lower than the exchange\u2019s reserve. The crypto exchange holds a healthy stablecoin balance of over $8 billion.\n\nAside from outflows on Ethereum, Binance also saw the largest outflow of Bitcoin (BTC) from the platform since the FTX collapse. Over 20,000 BTC were withdrawn from the exchange in the last 24 hours.\n\nBitcoin netflow on Binance. Source: Glassnode\n\nAnother on-chain analysis shared by CryptoQuant revealed that the total amount of user transactions to withdraw funds spiked after the SEC lawsuit announcement. However, they still hadn\u2019t surpassed the levels seen in December 2022 when self-custody became increasingly popular in the crypto market.\n\n3/4\n\nThe total amount of user transactions to withdraw funds (#Bitcoin, #Ethereum, and #Stablecoins) has spiked after the SEC lawsuit announcement, but they are still within historical normal levels. pic.twitter.com/fHKMmKAyWI \u2014 CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) June 6, 2023\n\nMarket pundits predicted that the significant surge in the withdrawals of assets from the crypto exchange reflects the declining trust of investors in centralized exchanges.\n\nMagazine: Bitcoin is on a collision course with \u2018Net Zero\u2019 promises"

        "content": "A Comprehensive Guide to Buying Ethereum on the Cash App in 2023\n\nAs we move towards a more digital economy, cryptocurrencies like Ethereum are becoming increasingly popular. If you\u2019re a crypto enthusiast, you may wonder, \u201cCan you Buy Ethereum on Cash App?\u201d\n\nWith its potential for smart contracts and decentralized applications, Ethereum is quickly becoming a favorite among investors and developers alike.\n\nBut with so many options out there, it can be tough to know where to start.\n\nIn this guide, we\u2019ll take a look at how you can buy Ethereum on the Cash App in 2023 and whether it\u2019s the right choice for you.\n\nSource: CNBC\n\nUnderstanding Ethereum and its Potential in 2023\n\nBefore we dive into the specifics of buying Ethereum on the Cash App, let\u2019s take a look at what makes Ethereum so special and why it\u2019s worth investing in.\n\nEthereum is a blockchain platform that allows developers to build and deploy decentralized applications, or dapps, on the blockchain. These dapps can be anything from financial applications to social networks, and they\u2019re all built on top of Ethereum\u2019s blockchain.\n\nOne of the most exciting things about Ethereum is its potential for smart contracts. Smart contracts are self-executing contracts, with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code.\n\nThis means that once the contract conditions are met, the contract is automatically executed. Smart contracts can potentially revolutionize many industries, from finance to real estate. In 2023, we can expect to see even more innovation in the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nWith the continued growth of decentralized finance, or DeFi, investors will have more opportunities to earn passive income through lending and staking. Additionally, we can expect to see more dapps being built on Ethereum as developers continue to explore the potential of this powerful blockchain platform.\n\nCan you buy Ethereum on the Cash App in 2023?\n\nSource: Pixabay\n\nYes, you can buy Ethereum on the Cash App in 2023.\n\nCash App is a mobile payment service that allows users to send and receive money and buy and sell Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. While Cash App started as a way to send and receive money, it has since expanded to include cryptocurrency trading.\n\nTo buy Ethereum on the Cash App, you must have a Cash App account and some fiat currency in your bank account or linked debit card. From there, you can easily convert your fiat currency into Ethereum and start investing in this exciting cryptocurrency.\n\nHow to Buy Ethereum on the Cash App in 2023: A Step-by-Step Guide\n\nIf you\u2019re new to Cash App or cryptocurrency trading, the process of buying ETH on Cash App may seem intimidating.\n\nBut don\u2019t worry; it\u2019s quite simple. Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide to buying Ethereum on the Cash App in 2023:\n\nDownload the Cash App from the App Store or Google Play Store and create an account. Link your bank account or debit card to your Cash App account. Go to the \u201cInvesting\u201d tab on the home screen and select \u201cCryptocurrency.\u201d Select Ethereum from the list of available cryptocurrencies. Enter the amount of ETH you want to buy and confirm your purchase. Congratulations! You now own Ethereum on the Cash App.\n\nSetting up your Cash App account for buying Ethereum\n\nYou\u2019ll need to set up your account before you can start buying Ethereum on the Cash App.\n\nHere are some tips for setting up your Cash App account for buying Ethereum:\n\nMake sure your account is verified. To verify your account, you must provide some personal information, including your full name, date of birth, and social security number. Link your bank account or debit card. This will allow you to convert your fiat currency into Ethereum. Enable two-factor authentication. Two-factor authentication adds extra security to your account and helps protect your funds from hackers and scammers. Familiarize yourself with the app. Take some time to explore the different features of the Cash App and get comfortable with the interface.\n\nTips for buying Ethereum on the Cash App in 2023\n\nSource: Paxful\n\nNow that you know how to buy Ethereum on the Cash App, let\u2019s take a look at some tips for making the most of your investments:\n\nDo your research. Before you invest in any cryptocurrency, it\u2019s important to do your research and understand the risks involved. Invest only what you can afford to lose. Cryptocurrency investing is highly volatile, and there is always the risk of losing your entire investment. Consider using dollar-cost averaging. Dollar-cost averaging is a strategy where you invest a fixed amount of money at regular intervals, regardless of the asset\u2019s price. This can help you avoid buying at the top of the market and potentially losing money. Keep your cryptocurrency in a custodial wallet. While Cash App provides a crypto wallet, keeping your investments in a separate, custodial wallet is generally safer. Stay up-to-date on the latest news and developments in the Ethereum ecosystem. By staying informed, you can make more informed investment decisions.\n\nBuying and selling Bitcoin on the Cash App\n\nIn addition to buying ETH, you can also buy and sell Bitcoin on the Cash App.\n\nBitcoin is the most well-known and widely-used cryptocurrency, and it can be a great investment for those looking to diversify their portfolio.\n\nTo buy or sell Bitcoin on the Cash App, follow the same steps as you would for buying Ethereum. However, remember that Bitcoin and Ethereum have different prices and different levels of volatility, so it\u2019s important to do your research before investing.\n\nConclusion\n\nBuying Ethereum on the Cash App can be a great investment in this exciting cryptocurrency. However, it\u2019s important to do your research and understand the risks involved before investing.\n\nBy following the tips and strategies outlined in this guide, you can make more informed investment decisions and potentially earn a solid return on your investment."
