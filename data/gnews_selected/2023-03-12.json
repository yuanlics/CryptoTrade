        "content": "Crypto advocacy group Coin Center spelling out why it believes Ethereum (ETH) is not a security, despite claims to the contrary coming from New York Attorney General (NYAG) Letitia James.\n\nIn a new lawsuit against the crypto exchange Kucoin, Attorney General James argues Ethereum is a security that relies on the efforts of third-party developers to generate profits for its holders.\n\nThe Attorney General calls ETH \u201ca speculative asset\u201d and placed the leading smart contract platform in a group with the collapsed crypto project Terra (LUNA) and its algorithmic stablecoin TerraUSD (UST).\n\nCoin Center\u2019s director of communications Neeraj Agrawal refutes the NYAG\u2019s assertions and says the think tank\u2019s view on Ethereum remains unchanged.\n\n\u201cObviously, we disagree with the NYAG\u2019s argument that ETH is a security. Coin Center will be monitoring the case and if there\u2019s an opportunity to weigh in, we will.\u201d\n\nIn 2018, Coin Center published a blog post explaining why it believes Ethereum is not a security. The group argued that while Ethereum may have met one of the prongs of the Howey test when it was issued in 2014, ETH in its current form today is not a security.\n\nUnder the Howey framework, a transaction represents an \u201cinvestment contract\u201d if a person \u201cinvests his money in a common enterprise and is led to expect profits solely from the efforts of the promoter, sponsor or other third party.\u201d\n\nAccording to Coin Center, Ethereum in its current iteration is \u201ctoo useful and too decentralized\u201d and that ETH\u2019s value does not rely on the efforts of a discernible third party to generate profits.\n\n\u201cThe value of Ether and the functionality of the Ethereum network is not reliant on the [Ethereum] Foundation, rather it flows from the efforts of thousands of unaffiliated developers, miners, and users\u2026\n\nConflating the pre-sale and the running network is confused analysis that could be misunderstanding the tech or the law or both.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, Ethereum is trading for $1,466.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "title": "Can Ethereum Reach $4,000 Again? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Although it might feel like eons, it was just a year and a half ago when Ethereum (ETH 1.46%) reached its all-time high of $4,644.33. Since then, a brutal crypto winter has left its mark on the industry as the entire landscape has changed dramatically. In the midst of this bear market, Ethereum lost more than 75% of its value at one point. Despite this drastic pullback, there is plenty of reason to believe that Ethereum could once again return to those previous all-time highs.\n\nOne of the primary reasons I believe Ethereum has what it takes to reclaim the $4,000 mark is a series of upgrades implemented in the blockchain over the last year and a half.\n\nUpgrades help Ethereum grow\n\nIf you recall, The Merge occurred in the fall of 2022 and effectively transitioned Ethereum from the bulky and power intensive proof-of-work to a more streamlined and efficient proof-of-stake blockchain. While this upgrade was highly publicized, and for good reason due to its magnitude, I believe there is another upgrade that will ultimately have a greater influence on Ethereum's future price ascension.\n\nKnown as the London hard fork, this upgrade was launched in the summer of 2021 and laid the foundation for The Merge. In preparation for miners becoming obsolete, the London hard fork introduced a new mechanism for handling the network's fees. Previously, transaction fees were sent to Ethereum miners as an incentive for morning. After the London fork, the fees are actually \"burned\" or removed from circulation.\n\nWhile on proof-of-work, miners added blocks to the blockchain. As a reward for their efforts, they would receive a fee which was included in every transaction on Ethereum. But instead of getting rid of the miner fee altogether, Ethereum developers implemented the burn feature that would permanently destroy the fee previously allocated to miners. In doing so, Ethereum essentially became a deflationary asset, a crucial quality for an asset to maintain and increase its value over time. By creating scarcity in the supply of Ethereum, the burn feature can increase demand and drive up the price.\n\nA new beginning\n\nBefore The Merge and the London hard fork, Ethereum's annual inflation rate hovered around 3.5%. But with both of these upgrades now implemented, the number of total ether in circulation has decreased and thus Ethereum has entered a deflationary stage. Today it boasts a deflation rate of -0.088%.\n\nThe inner workings are a little complex, but the combination of these upgrades makes it so that the more transactions that occur on the network, the more ether is burned. It took some time for this phenomenon to materialize due to the current bear market dampening the number of transactions, but toward the end of Q4 2022 and the first few months of 2023, Ethereum finally began to reap the benefits that came out of the London hard fork and The Merge.\n\nThe number of transactions occurring on Ethereum has been rising steadily since the beginning of 2023 and is just shy of levels not seen since it reached its previous all-time high. As a result of this increase in activity, the total number of ether has actually decreased since The Merge as the burn mechanism from the London hard fork has begun to take effect.\n\nFor Ethereum investors, this is nearly a perfect scenario. Over the coming years, as demand (hopefully) picks back up to levels seen in the last bull market, it could lead to explosive growth in Ethereum's price as it becomes truly subject to the pressures of limited supply and increased demand. Should this play out, it could not only send Ethereum past the $4,000 mark, but likely to a new all-time high."

        "title": "What Is Ethereum? Blockchain's Future of Finance Explained - DailyCoin",
        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) is the second largest crypto by market capitalization, second only to Bitcoin (BTC). While Bitcoin is undeniably revolutionary, Ethereum has reimagined the real-world use cases of blockchain and cryptocurrency.\n\nIf Bitcoin lets you be your own bank, Ethereum takes things further. Fully decentralized and open-source, the Ethereum network aims to liberate millions of people worldwide from the grip of centralized entities.\n\nSimple dApps within the ecosystem give you complete control of your assets and empower users to manage their finances through lending, borrowing, and trading. You can play engaging games and even collect provably unique digital art and store it on secure decentralized servers.\n\nHow does the Ethereum blockchain make all this possible? What exactly is a smart contract, and why are they so important?\n\nIntroducing Ethereum, the future of finance and the next generation of the internet.\n\nAbout Ethereum\n\nEthereum is a decentralized blockchain network that gives users full custody of their assets and hosts apps, organizations, and peer-to-peer transactions on a publicly verifiable network. The Ethereum mainnet has no centralized owner. Instead, it\u2019s governed by a community of users and powered by Ether, the native cryptocurrency of the network.\n\nAnyone can build an application or use the network at any time. The Ethereum blockchain is permissionless, meaning that no centralized body can stop me if I want to send cryptocurrency to a friend, trade tokens on a decentralized exchange, or store data on-chain. Even the Ethereum Foundation, a non-profit that helps develop and guide Ethereum\u2019s growth, doesn\u2019t have the power to censor how the network is used.\n\nLike Bitcoin, the Ethereum blockchain offers anonymity. No invasive KYC procedures need to be completed before using the network, and you don\u2019t need to provide any personal details before storing your funds securely on-chain.\n\nHow does a network with no owner operate 24 hours a day, seven days a week, without interference or a centralized service managing everything?\n\nHow Does Ethereum Work?\n\nThe Ethereum network is a public blockchain supported by thousands of independent computers worldwide. Each participant is called a \u2018Node\u2019 and helps secure the Ethereum blockchain. This decentralized system is more stable and reliable than centralized systems because a single point of failure does not threaten it.\n\nFor example, take the diagram below. If the central piece of the centralized network suffers an outage, none of the other participants can communicate with each other. In a decentralized system, plenty of other interconnected nodes will step up and support the network if any nodes fail.\n\nDuring The Merge, a network upgrade completed in September 2022, Ethereum migrated to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. Ethereum\u2019s PoS mechanism randomly selects validators to produce new blocks and secure the network. This is a more energy-efficient model than its original Proof-of-Work (PoW) mechanism, which demands high computational power.\n\nNode operators are responsible for securing the Ethereum mainnet, processing transactions, and creating new blocks. As a reward for their services, these validators earn Ether tokens. Ether is valuable because users need it to pay transaction fees on the Ethereum network. However, ETH can also be sold on the crypto market in exchange for fiat currencies, like USD.\n\nI know what you\u2019re thinking; this sounds remarkably similar to Bitcoin or XRP. However, one key difference gives the Ethereum blockchain a greater variety of use cases than its predecessor.\n\nSmart Contracts\n\nThe Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is a computational state that manages the network. Essentially, the environment houses all accounts and smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. Most Ethereum smart contracts are written in Solidity, the network\u2019s dominant programming language.\n\nPut simply, a smart contract is a line of code stored in blockchain programs and applications that execute when certain conditions are met. Smart contracts automate agreements between users in permissionless, anonymous environments, leading to greater trust and security on the network.\n\nThe easiest way to understand smart contracts is to imagine a vending machine. I enter an automated contract if I want a drink from the machine.\n\nI provide money and choose my drink, providing my side of our agreement .\n\n. The vending machine accepts my money and automatically dispenses my drink, providing its side of our agreement.\n\nSmart contracts allow Ethereum users to manage their cryptocurrencies more efficiently. They remove the need for intermediaries to oversee transactions. There is no room for human bias or error. Moreover, anyone can view the contract and verify its safety. In many ways, smart contracts add a layer of law and order to blockchain\u2019s private and anonymous world.\n\nWhy is this important? What does Ethereum offer that traditional services cannot?\n\nWhat Can I Do On The Ethereum Blockchain?\n\nThe Ethereum network is home to a rapidly expanding suite of apps and programs. Innovation and creativity are fully displayed in Web3, with new use cases being discovered and unveiled daily.\n\nDecentralized Finance\n\nFirst and foremost, the world of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is one of the most widespread use cases of the Ethereum blockchain. DeFi apps like Uniswap allow traders to swap ERC-20 crypto tokens with liquidity pools on-chain instantly. This not only gives traders access to a wider range of cryptocurrencies, but it also gives emerging Web3 startups a place to list their tokens without needing to pay a centralized exchange costly listing fees.\n\nLending and borrowing platforms like AAVE let DeFi users maximize their crypto holdings. In the same way, property owners can take out a loan against their house, apps like AAVE let holders get instant access to funds without selling their crypto. On the other hand, lenders can loan out their ETH and other cryptos to earn interest on their holdings in real-time.\n\nImagine trying to do any of this in traditional finance. Getting approved for a loan can take months and come with high fees from intermediaries like banks. Human bias also comes into play, and you have no way of knowing whether your loan will be approved. DeFi on Ethereum fixes this and levels the playing field. Anyone can access financial tools regardless of their funds, credit, or status.\n\nNFTs\n\nNon-fungible tokens have come a long way. While originally, NFTs were considered to be nothing more than flexes and digital art pieces, NFT utilities are evolving in earnest. Some of the world\u2019s biggest brands, like Adidas and Porsche, are incorporating NFT technology into their businesses. TravelX, a Latin American travel company, is developing NFT flight ticketing services.\n\nEthereum is the home of NFT culture. The network allows anyone to mint an NFT, whether a document containing important information or a unique masterpiece of digital art. Creator royalties on NFT collections mean that artists will receive ongoing fair value for their work, even years after it was originally sold.\n\nData Storage & Decentralized Governance\n\nStoring data on the Ethereum blockchain is a solution for users wanting decentralized and immutable storage options. Data stored on Ethereum is distributed across a network of computers, making it more resistant to hacking. Moreover, once data is stored on the Ethereum blockchain it\u2019s immutable. It cannot be altered or deleted, providing a tamper-proof data record.\n\nEthereum data can be accessed and used by other decentralized applications within the ecosystem, enabling seamless integration between different Ethereum-based applications and programs.\n\nBy tokenizing assets on Ethereum, groups of individuals can form a DAO or a decentralized autonomous organization. Many decentralized platforms are governed by DAOs, who vote on development proposals and the community decisions that shape the protocol\u2019s future.\n\nEthereum itself is governed in this way. Every decision that influences the future development of Ethereum is voted on by its community of Ether holders.\n\nThe Birth of Ethereum\n\nThe idea of Ethereum was first conceived by Vitalik Buterin when he was just a teenager. At the time, Buterin was a talented computer programmer and co-founder of Bitcoin Magazine. Buterin envisioned greater utility for blockchain technology beyond what Bitcoin could.\n\nHe published the first Ethereum whitepaper in 2014, which attracted the attention of other industry big brains like Gavin Wood and Charles Hoskinson.\n\nIn 2014, Buterin brought his idea for the world\u2019s first smart contract-capable blockchain to the Bitcoin conference in Miami. The concept was met with enthusiasm, and the Ethereum founders hosted an ICO (initial coin offering), raising over $18 million in BTC.\n\nThe first iteration of the Ethereum mainnet, Frontier, officially went live in July 2015.\n\nEthereum 2.0 (Serenity)\n\nWhile Ethereum is in itself a revolutionary technology, it is not without its flaws. Ethereum\u2019s biggest issue is undoubtedly its scalability. The Ethereum network has congestion issues, like slow transaction speeds and high gas fees.\n\nTo address these problems, Vitalik and the Ethereum Foundation proposed a series of upgrades to the network. These Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) aim to reinvent the network into a more scalable and secure blockchain. While it\u2019s most commonly referred to as ETH 2.0, the official name for the upgraded network is Ethereum Serenity.\n\nThere have been plenty of Ethereum upgrades over the years. However, the most important have been listed below.\n\nBeacon Chain\n\nEthereum was originally a Proof-of-Work blockchain. Vitalik and the Ethereum Foundation proposed migrating to a Proof-of-Stake consensus to achieve true scalability and reduce energy consumption.\n\nFollowing the approval of the proposal by the community, Vitalik, and the Ethereum foundation deployed the Beacon Chain in December 2020. Essentially, the Beacon Chain ran alongside the Ethereum main chain, testing how the PoS consensus would work within Ethereum\u2019s infrastructure and laying a foundation for the Merge.\n\nLondon Hard Fork (EIP 1559)\n\nThe London Hard Fork is a significant milestone for the Ethereum ecosystem. It introduced a deflationary mechanism that burned a small percentage of Ethereum transaction fees. This was introduced to counteract Ether\u2019s inflationary validator rewards system.\n\nSource: UltraSoundMoney\n\nSince the London Hard Fork, over 46,000 ETH has been burnt. This represents over $71 million at the current ETH price. Investors expect that the ongoing effects of the London upgrade will be positive for Ethereum price as the token supply becomes more scarce.\n\nThe Merge\n\nPerhaps the biggest upgrade Ethereum ever witnessed occurred in September 2022. As the name would suggest, the Merge represented the key moment when Ethereum\u2019s existing PoW chain merged with the Beacon Chain, Ethereum\u2019s preparatory PoS chain.\n\nSource: Ethereum\n\nFollowing The Merge, Ethereum became a far more energy-efficient network. The upgrade reduced Ethereum\u2019s energy consumption by 99.95% and the earth\u2019s total usage by around 1%. The transition to a PoS consensus has also enabled the network to implement Sharding, a scaling solution that will increase Ethereum\u2019s transaction throughput and processing speeds.\n\nShanghai Upgrade (EIP 4985)\n\nAs part of the earlier Beacon Chain and Merge upgrades, Ethereum holders staked their ETH in locked contracts to help secure the network during the transition. Scheduled for early 2023, the Shanghai upgrade will release the staked ETH back to providers over time and aims to reduce transaction fees on the network.\n\nIt is expected that over 17 million ETH will be unlocked in the weeks following the Shanghai Hard Fork.\n\nOn The Flipside\n\nSince Ethereum first launched back in 2015, many other \u2018Ethereum-Killer\u2019 blockchains have emerged to compete with the market leader. These include popular networks like Cardano, BNB Chain, and Solana.\n\nWhile these competitors haven\u2019t been able to reach ETH in terms of market cap, they have proven themselves as faster and more affordable alternatives.\n\nWhy You Should Care\n\nEthereum is the world\u2019s first blockchain that supports smart contracts and introduced concepts like DeFi and NFTs to the masses. It\u2019s by far the most adopted Layer 1 blockchain in the industry.\n\nFAQs"
