        "title": "Both XRP and Ethereum (ETH) Will Be Demolished by SEC: President's Advisor Explains Why - U.Today",
        "content": "In a recent fiery debate that has captivated the crypto space, the XRP community clashed with Max Keiser, advisor to the president of El Salvador and a prominent Bitcoin evangelist. The topic that ignited the heated discussion was the contentious issue of cryptocurrency regulation, specifically concerning the fate of XRP and Ethereum (ETH) in the face of mounting pressure from the SEC.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKeiser unequivocally stated that the regulatory overreach would inevitably lead to the demise of XRP and every other cryptocurrency, except for Bitcoin, which he deemed \"untouchable.\"\n\nOf course the SEC is 'overreaching' but that won't stop them from killing off XRP and every other shitcoin. (Except BTC, of course. It's untouchable).\n\n\n\nBecause there is virtually no rule of law whatsoever in Wall St/finance for those with $ and clout. Brad Garlinghouse has been\u2026 https://t.co/NwH9sH6qk8 \u2014 Max Keiser, sr. bitcoin advisor pres. Bukele \ud83c\udf0b\ud83e\udde2 (@maxkeiser) June 23, 2023\n\nJohn Deaton, a pro-crypto lawyer and legal representative of XRP holders, challenged Keiser's apocalyptic prediction. He countered by highlighting the SEC's prior labeling of Bitcoin as a security. While conceding that the commission could inflict damage on XRP, Deaton believed that the influence of its current transient regulator, Gary Gensler, would be short-lived.\n\nHe further argued that software code itself should not be classified as a security, emphasizing the need for a level playing field where the best technologies could thrive.\n\nUnswayed by Deaton's arguments, Keiser remained steadfast in his belief that both ETH and XRP would suffer the same fate. Dismissing chatter about Bitcoin as inconsequential, he declared that Gensler, the current SEC chairman, would pursue Ethereum and XRP as unregistered securities.\n\nKeiser went on to assert that the regulator functioned as a protection racket for the banking cartel, ready to employ national security and the Patriot Act if necessary to eliminate these projects."

        "title": "ETH Bulls Aim at $2K But is a Retest of $1.8K Coming First? (Ethereum Price Analysis) - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s price recently received support at the 200-day moving average and subsequently embarked on a strong bullish rally, breaking above the 100-day MA. This could be a positive indicator for Ethereum\u2019s mid-term prospects, but it also carries the risk of being a bull trap.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nThe Daily Chart\n\nAfter a period of correction and a significant downtrend, the price reached the $1.6K level, which coincided with the 200-day moving average and found support. The significant buying pressure at this level triggered a rapid reversal and an upward trend toward the critical resistance zone around $2K.\n\nAdditionally, the price surpassed the 100-day moving average at $1.8K, suggesting a bullish bias for Ethereum in the mid-term. However, to confirm the presence of a bull market in 2023 and restore sufficient demand to the market, Ethereum\u2019s price still needs to overcome the substantial resistance at the $2K region and consolidate above.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart\n\nIn general, the Fibonacci retracement tool is helpful for identifying potential reversal points and correction targets during impulsive trends. As previously mentioned, Ethereum\u2019s price experienced a mid-term correction phase after reaching the yearly high of $2.1K through an impulsive uptrend.\n\nExamining the chart reveals that the bearish correction leg found support and reversed at the 61.8% retracement level, a commonly observed target for correction phases. The prevailing buying pressure within this critical range resulted in a robust bullish trend towards the $2K region.\n\nIf the price successfully surpasses the significant resistance around $2K, it will pave the way for a mid-term bullish trend, as this level holds psychological significance. However, it is worth considering the bearish divergence between the price and the RSI indicator, which suggests the possibility of a slight rejection and short-term consolidation before Ethereum makes its next move.\n\nOn-chain Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nEthereum has been consolidating below the $2K level for the past few months after being rejected from that level. The uncertainty seen on the price chart is also reflected in the futures market sentiment.\n\nThis chart displays the Funding Rates metric, which indicates whether the futures market sentiment is bullish or bearish. Recently, after a period of correction in the market, which coincided with a downtrend in the funding rates metric, the price found support and began a strong rally.\n\nHowever, the metric has started to show a slight uptrend during this bullish rally, suggesting increased buying pressure and a greater tendency among participants to take long positions rather than short positions.\n\nWhile this could be seen as a bullish sign for the market, traders should exercise caution as it may actually be a bull trap, potentially leading to a long-squeeze event."

        "content": "Share:\n\nEthereum\u2019s on-chain movements indicate bullish pressure building around Ether as its exchange balances reached an all-time low and staking deposits keep surging.\n\nEther\u2019s technical charts suggest that the asset can reclaim $3,000 if buyers are able to push above the resistance between $1,900 and $2,000.\n\nETH held on exchanges hits an all-time low\n\nExchange balances for ETH reached a new low of 12.6%, dropping sharply in the last 30 days, according to Glassnode data. Reduced supply on exchanges is usually a bullish sign, as it means fewer tokens are readily available for selling.\n\nPercentage of ETH\u2019s supply on crypto exchanges. Source: Glassnode\n\nThe netflow volume of deposits and withdrawals from exchanges shows a steep surge in withdrawals at the start of June amid a regulatory crackdown on Binance and Coinbase.\n\nThe data should be taken with a grain of salt, as withdrawals were caused by investors spooked by centralized exchanges.\n\nHowever, the magnitude of withdrawals and bullish price action show similarity to the November 2022 levels, when ETH quickly surged over 33% following an equivalent dip in exchange balances.\n\nNetflow of ETH deposits and withdrawals from exchanges. Source: Glassnode\n\nAt the same time, ETH\u2019s supply locked in staking contracts has surged significantly since April\u2019s Shapella upgrade. Currently, over 23 million ETH is deposited in staking contracts, representing 19.1% of its total supply.\n\nGlassnode\u2019s data shows that nearly 30% of ETH\u2019s supply is locked in smart contracts, including decentralized finance and staking contracts, up from 25.5% at the start of 2023.\n\nIncreased withdrawals from exchanges and deposits in smart contracts are positive for ETH's price, as it reduces its liquid supply.\n\nETH/USD price analysis\n\nEther\u2019s price broke above the 50-day moving average at $1,823.09, staging a bullish breakout.\n\nThe ETH/USD pair is currently facing resistance around the horizontal level of $1,906. The pair has recorded higher lows since November 2022, with the $1,900-$2,000 level acting as technical and psychological resistance levels, according to the ascending triangle pattern.\n\nA breakout above $2,000 could quickly propel ETH toward the 2022 breakdown levels of around $3,000. The targets of the bullish ascending channel pattern also coincide around these levels.\n\nETH/USD daily price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe ETH/BTC pair is looking to establish support around the 2023 lows of 0.06255 in Bitcoin terms. If sellers push the price below this level, bearish targets of 0.05689 BTC would get exposed.\n\nNevertheless, the relative strength index metric is showing oversold readings for the ETH/BTC pair, suggesting that a pullback is likely.\n\nETH/BTC daily price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe funding rate for the ETH perpetual swap contract surged toward monthly highs, acting as a cautionary flag for late buyers.\n\nPerpetual swap traders pay funding rates on their open short or long positions, depending on the demand for the asset. When the demand for short orders surpasses the demand for long orders, shorting becomes relatively more expensive, leading traders on the short side to pay longs.\n\nThere is a chance that the price pulls back toward the bottom of the ascending triangle pattern on the ETH/USD pair to around $1,680.\n\nFunding rate for ETH perpetual swap contracts. Source: CoinGlass\n\nNevertheless, on-chain movements and market indicators give the upside a higher chance over a short- to medium-term bearish trend.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price action and BTC buyers\u2019 ability to hold the $30,000 level will also play a crucial role in maintaining Ether\u2019s bullish momentum."
