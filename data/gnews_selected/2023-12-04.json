        "content": "Societe Generale announced Monday that it issued its first green bond on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nThe transaction \u2014 which took place in late November \u2014 amounts to 10 million euros, or roughly $10.8 million, and has a maturity of three years.\n\nThe tokenized bonds, France\u2019s third-largest bank wrote, will ensure \u201cincreased transparency and traceability as well as improved fluidity and speed in transactions and settlements.\u201d\n\nAccording to a press release, SocGen aims to enable more transparency on ESG by using the blockchain as a \u201cdata repository and certification tool for issuers and investors.\u201d\n\nThe smart contract of the bond includes carbon footprint information, and is available for anyone to access.\n\nSociete Generale-FORGE, the bank\u2019s crypto team, released a report focused on the lifecycle of security tokens back in November.\n\nRead more: EU expensing $843K to pull back the curtain on crypto\u2019s climate impact\n\nIn partnership with the Lamarck Group, Institut Louis Bachelier and the Crypto Carbon Ratings Institute, the report sought to develop a methodology to calculate \u201cthe carbon footprint of a financial product issued in the form of a token on the Ethereum public blockchain infrastructure.\u201d\n\nIt specifically used Ethereum\u2019s network due to the \u201crelatively low greenhouse gas emissions\u201d due to the Merge, which took place in September of last year.\n\nBack in June, the European Investment Bank also issued a tokenized bond, though it used Credit Agricole CIB and SEB\u2019s bond platform built on blockchain technology. The EIB\u2019s bond was structured as a Swedish Krona 1 billion bond, which amounts to roughly $95 million, and has a 2 year maturity.\n\nWhile the bond is a first for SocGen, it previously collaborated with the EIB on the bank\u2019s first digital bond issuance, which took place back in 2021.\n\nAside from collaborations, the French bank has proven to be interested in crypto.\n\nBack in April, SocGen\u2019s FORGE team announced its plans for a euro-pegged stablecoin dubbed EUR CoinVertible on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nThe same team also secured a license to operate as a digital asset service provider in France back in July. It registered with the French stock market regulator as a digital asset custodian back in 2022.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."
