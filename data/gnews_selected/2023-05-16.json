        "content": "Market-leading liquid staking platform Lido has enabled staked ETH withdrawals. The move came as Lido launched the V2 upgrade live to mainnet on May 15.\n\nThe upgrade is the largest yet for the protocol, and it has two major components:\n\n\u201cLido V2 introduces two major components, with the most user-facing aspect being Ethereum withdrawals. This allows Ethereum stakers with Lido to directly unstake ETH through the protocol.\u201d\n\nLido now has a withdrawals page where users can deposit their stETH tokens to get ETH in return.\n\nFollowing a successful on-chain vote, Lido V2 is officially here.https://t.co/36EmuagToD \ud83c\udfdd\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/sl4kjNpUYw \u2014 Lido (@LidoFinance) May 15, 2023\n\nLido Staking Withdrawals Live\n\nLido noted that under normal circumstances, the stETH or wstETH withdrawal period can take anywhere between 1-5 days. Furthermore, the stETH injected back into the protocol will be burnt in order to release the ETH at a 1:1 ratio.\n\nThe announcement added that the upgrade lowers a number of previous inconveniences surrounding Lido on Ethereum staking experience. Additionally, it \u201callows for a more efficient use of Lido\u2019s staked ETH throughout the Ethereum DeFi ecosystem.\u201d\n\nThe token unlocks dashboard is projecting a spike in withdrawals on May 16. It reports 45,830 ETH currently in the pending withdrawal queue, which is likely to grow once Lido stakers start withdrawing.\n\nIt estimates that almost 7,000 ETH worth around $12.6 million will be withdrawn over the next eleven hours.\n\nNansen\u2019s dashboard is still reporting that there are more deposits than withdrawals on the Beacon Chain. It also claims a total of 20 million ETH are staked though this is likely to be on the high side since the Beaconcha.in explorer claims 18.3 million.\n\n6,274,752 ETH is staked with @LidoFinance. That\u2019s over 29% of total deposits! And later today, Lido will enable ETH withdrawals for the very first time What will happen? Nobody knows, but you can track it here with our dashboard: https://t.co/DFbiirSdxmhttps://t.co/1EvVjbDznm \u2014 Nansen \ud83e\udded (@nansen_ai) May 15, 2023\n\nV2 also includes an upgrade called a staking router. This new modular component allows for the development of on-ramps for new Node Operators. It promotes staking diversity by allowing solo stakers, DAOs, and Distributed Validator Technology (DVT) clusters.\n\nETH Price Reaction\n\nEthereum prices are marginally down on the day, trading at $1,812 at the time of writing. ETH has retreated 13% over the past month as crypto markets continue to correct.\n\nLido has 29% of all staked Ether, so withdrawals may add some selling pressure to markets in the short term.\n\nIts native LDO token has gained 7.2% on the day, climbing to $2.09 at the time of writing. Furthermore, Lido DAO tokens are up 15% over the past week."

        "title": "Better Buy: Cardano or Ethereum? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Every year, it seems, there's a new blockchain rival that investors think might eventually take Ethereum's (CRYPTO: ETH) place as the top Layer-1 blockchain. In years past, these blockchain rivals have included the likes of Solana (CRYPTO: SOL) and Avalanche (CRYPTO: AVAX). But, due to its strong track record of innovation, Ethereum has retained its market-leading position.\n\nThis year, the blockchain that everyone is talking about as a potential Ethereum rival is Cardano (CRYPTO: ADA). Year to date, Ethereum is up 53%, and Cardano is up 50%, so it's almost a dead heat. Let's take a closer look at how the two blockchains stack up to see which one is the better investment right now.\n\nEthereum's first-mover advantage\n\nEthereum has the first-mover advantage in just about every sector of the blockchain world. It literally invented the concept of smart contracts, so it's perhaps no surprise that it is still the clear leader in everything from non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to decentralized finance (DeFi). If you take a look at the top-selling NFT collections, for example, almost all of them are Ethereum-based, and it remains the top blockchain by overall NFT sales volume.\n\nBut the one drawback of Ethereum has always been its performance. There are blockchains that are faster and cheaper to use, and that has left openings for new rivals to emerge. This is the reason Solana and Avalanche first emerged as potential \"Ethereum killers.\" Even after The Merge, Ethereum still relies on a complex network of Layer-2 scaling solutions to process transactions quickly and keep fees in check. The main Ethereum blockchain can still only process 10 to 20 transactions per second. Meanwhile, Solana routinely handles 5,000 transactions per second, and has plans to boost its capacity to 600,000 transactions per second.\n\nNew Cardano innovations\n\nThat's why some investors are sitting up and taking notice now that Cardano has finally introduced its long-promised Layer-2 scaling solution, Hydra. According to some Cardano developers, Hydra is the key to 1 million transactions per second. That's a performance benchmark that Ethereum has been promising (but failing to deliver) for years. At 1 million transactions per second, the Cardano blockchain would be nearly 15 times faster than Visa's credit card network, which claims to be capable of processing 65,000 transactions per second.\n\nAnd Cardano has suddenly boosted its profile in the DeFi world, where for years it was a non-player. DeFi is a new priority for Cardano in 2023, and thus far, the blockchain has delivered. It has a new stablecoin, new decentralized exchanges, and new DeFi protocols. Combined, all of these innovations could make it possible for Cardano to create a robust DeFi ecosystem. It's too early to say that Cardano is a serious rival to Ethereum, given that it still ranks No. 18 among all blockchains in DeFi. However, the case can now be made that it's no longer a so-called ghost chain where nothing ever happens.\n\nWho is innovating faster?\n\nAt the end of the day, the blockchain sector is just like any other part of the tech industry. Innovation matters, and investors are willing to pay a premium for tokens on blockchains that appear to be innovating faster. Right now, Ethereum is still riding high after pulling off The Merge last year -- a technological feat that some have compared to changing the engine of an airplane in mid-flight. So the innovation bar is high these days. Investors are looking for truly breakthrough innovations, not just incremental improvements.\n\nUltimately, the answer to the question of which blockchain is innovating faster might come down to performance in newly emerging areas such as artificial intelligence (AI). The blockchain that secures a clear first-mover advantage in AI, for example, could be the one to invest in for long-term growth. Thus far, neither Cardano nor Ethereum has emerged as the obvious market leader, although Cardano does seem to have the makings of an AI strategy.\n\nAnd the winner is...\n\nRight now, I'm bullish on both Ethereum and Cardano. Both blockchains have seen stellar gains thus far in 2023. But, given Ethereum's track record of delivering performance over a longer period of time and its entrenched status as the market leader, the nod goes to Ethereum as the better buy."

        "title": "3 reasons why Ethereum price could struggle at the $1.9K level - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Since May 12, Ether\u2019s price has been struggling to sustain its $1,800 support level, as investors face pressures from a worsening crypto regulatory environment and the Ethereum network\u2019s high gas fees. Also negatively impacting Ether\u2019s (ETH) price are three indicators signaling reduced demand for its decentralized applications (DApps) and a lack of leverage buying demand from professional traders.\n\nRegulators signal their plan to further limit crypto intermediaries\n\nAccording to court documents filed on May 15, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has given a formal response in court in relation to Coinbase\u2019s petition for clear crypto regulation. The SEC stated that any rulemaking may take years and that enforcement actions will continue in the meantime.\n\nOn May 16, the Economic and Financial Affairs Council of the European Union \u2014 comprising finance ministers of all member states \u2014 approved the highly anticipated Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation, which will come into effect by mid-2024.\n\nSome argue that MiCA facilitates business growth in the region. Others focus on the privacy risks for personal users\u2019 data and the risks imposed on non-custodial solutions, including decentralized finance applications.\n\nThe drop in DApp deposits is concerning\n\nThe Ethereum network is experiencing problems caused by surging gas fees \u2014 the cost associated with transactions, including those performed by smart contracts. For the past four weeks, the average transaction fee has stood above $9, which severely limited the demand for DApp usage.\n\nTotal deposits on the Ethereum network in Ether terms plunged to their lowest levels since August 2020. Such an analysis excludes the effects of native Ethereum staking, which recently started to allow withdrawals.\n\nEthereum network applications' total deposits in ETH. Source: DefiLlama\n\nAccording to DefiLlama data, Ethereum DApps reached 14.9 million ETH in total value locked (TVL) on May 16. That compares with 16.5 million ETH two months prior, a 10% decline. As a comparison, TVL on BNB Smart Chain in BNB (BNB) terms was essentially flat in the same period, while Polygon (MATIC) deposits on the Polygon network increased by 29%.\n\nBNB Smart Chain attempts to take a lead in DEX volume\n\nEthereum might have been the absolute leader in decentralized exchange (DEX) volume since its inception, but this position is being challenged. Ethereum\u2019s market share by volume on DEXs peaked at 75% in the week ending March 5 but steadily declined to its lowest level ever, 39.6%, in the week ending May 14.\n\nWeekly DEX volume by chain. Source: DefiLlama\n\nGainers since March 5 on DEX trading volume were Arbitrum, increasing to 14% from 7%, and BNB Smart Chain, growing to 31% from 5.6%. One might argue that the success of the Ethereum network\u2019s scaling solutions reflects bullishness for Ether\u2019s price, but that relationship is not so direct.\n\nRelated: Updated European tax directive requires reporting on all crypto asset transfers\n\nData shows pro traders turning bearish\n\nEther quarterly futures are popular among whales and arbitrage desks. However, these fixed-month contracts typically trade at a slight premium to spot markets, indicating that sellers are asking for more money to delay settlement.\n\nAs a result, ETH futures contracts in healthy markets should trade at a 5 to 10% annualized premium \u2014 a situation known as contango, which is not unique to crypto markets.\n\nEther 3-month futures annualized premium. Source: Laevitas\n\nEther professional traders have avoided leverage longs (bullish bets) since early April. Moreover, the current 1% ETH futures premium is on the edge of becoming negative, known as backwardation \u2014 if confirmed, this is an alarming red flag, as bearish demand dominates the scene.\n\nIn short, these three indicators \u2014 namely, the reduced TVL, record-low DEX market share and lack of leverage buying demand \u2014 signal the $1,900 resistance will be hard to break in the short term. For now, Ether bears are in control, favoring the odds of a price correction.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.
