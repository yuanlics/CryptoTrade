        "title": "Lido Risk to Ethereum Grows as SEC Targets Exchange Staking Services - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is convinced that all crypto assets aside from Bitcoin are securities. Its latest war on crypto exchanges has included staking services, which the regulator seeks to shut down.\n\nThis could push more staked ETH out of exchanges and onto the market-leading liquid staking provider Lido. This may sound good, but it poses significant risks to the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nLido Staking Risks Exposed\n\nLido provides liquid staking services for Ethereum as an alternative to self-staking, which is highly technical, and involves exchanges that take substantial commissions.\n\nIt has rapidly become the market leader with 7.18 million staked ETH, or 36% of the total 19.6 million staked.\n\nOn June 13, Ethereum advocates at \u2018Bankless\u2019 sounded the alarm on Lido, calling for the prevention of its domination of ETH staking.\n\nA continued SEC crackdown on exchanges is likely to push more staked Ethereum to Lido, it noted. There was already a surge in staked ETH redemptions from Coinbase last week after the lawsuit by the regulator.\n\nKraken was forced to end its Ethereum staking services for U.S. users in February, resulting in an exodus as soon as Shapella rolled out.\n\nFurthermore, Lido\u2019s market share has grown since the Shapella upgrade enabled staking withdrawals.\n\nEthereum developers such as Danny Ryan have warned about the dangers of staking \u201ccartelization,\u201d in which platforms such as Lido can extract outsized profits compared to non-pooled capital.\n\nBankless reported that the platform was near the first threshold with around a third of all staked ETH.\n\n\u201cLido is nearing the first of three thresholds at which Ethereum is more easily manipulated by an attacker.\u201d\n\nIt added that Lido has already voted against self-limiting deposits, but Ethereum advocates are now calling for them to do so.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unlikely Ethereum will implement such controls at the protocol level, but it is clear Lido must face economic repercussions,\u201d Bankless noted.\n\nThere is a growing movement to divest from Lido and explore alternative Ethereum staking options.\n\n\u201cEtherians must band together and decrease our reliance on Lido to prevent its domination over staking!\u201d\n\nETH Price Outlook\n\nEthereum staking deposits are still outpacing withdrawals, however, asset prices have taken a hit following last week\u2019s regulatory attacks on the industry.\n\nETH was trading flat on the day at $1,745 at the time of writing, according to CoinGecko. The asset has lost more than 8% since the SEC sued Binance and Coinbase last week, more than its big brother Bitcoin.\n\nAdditionally, it is looking increasingly bearish, having fallen to the lower boundary of its three-month-long range-bound channel."

        "title": "Ethereum Price Prediction Following SEC Ruling - Can It Withstand the Crypto Crash? - Finbold - Finance in Bold",
        "content": "DISCLAIMER: This article is a SPONSORED Press Release and does not constitute Finbold's editorial content nor undergo monitoring. Crypto assets/products involve significant risks. Do not invest unless you are prepared to lose your entire investment. For a full disclaimer, please click here.\n\nThe cryptocurrency market remains prone to extreme bearishness after the SEC sued Binance and Coinbase for illegal operation and sale of unregistered securities, while also labelling a select number of major coins are securities.\n\nDespite Ethereum not being explicitly named in the lawsuit, it has received an enormous brunt of the negative outlook. The token has fallen over 6% in the past week as pre-FOMC fears also make matters worse.\n\nAs ETH and other major tokens struggle, Investors are already flocking to new tokens not targeted by the SEC that can offer better immediate prospects. Let\u2019s take a look at Ethereum\u2019s chances of recovering from the crash and which new tokens traders are backing to defy the bear market.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction Remains Bearish for June\n\nThe security versus commodity debate has now become the overarching narrative of the crypto market. In its lawsuit, the SEC labelled several major altcoins such as Cardano, Solana and MATIC as unregistered securities. These tokens plummeted by as much as 30% following the filing.\n\nOn the surface, the SEC\u2019s lawsuit could have been beneficial for Ethereum. Both the Solana and Cardano communities have not shied away from calling themselves \u201cEthereum Killers\u201d, and both blockchains are designed to replace Ethereum as the leading platform for smart contract technology. Thus, a bearish outlook for ADA and SOL could have been bullish for Ether.\n\nAs it turns out, Ethereum may soon find itself on the SEC\u2019s target as well. SEC chairman Gary Gensler has said multiple times that Bitcoin is the only cryptocurrency that he is comfortable deeming a commodity. In a tense exchange with Representative Patrick McHenry during his congressional hearing, Gensler hesitated in clarifying whether ETH is a security or not.\n\nSeveral other key figures have taken a strong stance against Ether as well. New York Attorney General Letitia James sued KuCoin for offering the sale of ETH, which she labelled as an unregistered security.\n\nThe token may soon face a double whammy as the Federal Reserve is set to decide on a major interest rate hike next week. Several key officials including Fed chair Jerome Powell have taken an uncompromising stance in their fight against soaring inflation levels. If the Fed indeed proceeds with another interest rate hike, ETH prices could take another major hit.\n\nA recent report by CoinShares highlighted that Ethereum-based assets saw outflows totalling $36 million in just the last week. The report believes that most of the outflows are a result of the Fed\u2019s unending hawkish monetary policy.\n\nThe Ethereum blockchain also needs significant improvements to ensure long-term user retention. In his blog, Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin explained that the blockchain will simply die without three key transitions of scalability, privacy and wallet security. Buterin\u2019s biggest fear is that with ETH transactions costing a lot of fees, users will simply move to other options like Solana and Cardano. While these blockchains are more centralised than Ethereum, they are also significantly faster.\n\nTradingView, a technical analysis platform, gives a sell signal to the token in the daily time frame. With ETH underperforming 12 of the 15 most important moving average indicators, its price prediction remains bearish for June.\n\nWhich Tokens are Outperforming the Beark Market?\n\nDespite the struggles of major tokens several new tokens are providing hope to traders.\n\nTwo of these include Wall Street Memes and Ecoterra, both of which are sailing through their respective presales.\n\nWall Street Memes Token Raises $6.5 Million in Bid to Be the Next Big Meme Coin\n\nThe Wall Street Memes token has become one of the hottest commodities in the meme coin market. Investors are losing confidence in tokens such as Pepe and Doge due to their inability to perform in the bear market. But the $WSM token has become one of the most consistent performers as it has raised over $6.5 million in less than 3 weeks.\n\nThe token is a result of the same community spirit that inspired the historic GameStop short squeeze in 2021. In fact, the Wall Street Memes group considers it its mission to disrupt the traditional financial landscape. The group also has a strong track record in the crypto space as well. It sold out its Wall St Bulls NFT collection in 32 minutes, netting a cool $2.5 million. It has also recently announced its own Bitcoin ordinal NFTs.\n\nThe group is not resting on its laurels as the Wall Street Memes token has adopted community-driven tokenomics. The entire $WSM supply is available to the general public, with no cuts for any private sales. 50% of the tokens are available during the presale itself, allowing ample opportunities for investors to take advantage of the early presale prices.\n\n30% of the token supply is reserved for cool community awards, to be used to further enhance user adoption. 5 lucky degens will earn $10K worth of $WSM tokens through a generous airdrop.\n\nA global brand value and a million-strong internet army mean that the $WSM tokens are quickly selling out. Investors have limited opportunity to purchase the token through bank cards or by swapping ETH or USDT tokens.\n\nVisit Wall Street Memes Presale\n\nNew Green Crypto Project Ecoterra Raises $5 Million in Fight Against Climate Change\n\nAs the concerns of global warming and climate change rise, investors are now clamouring for eco-friendly investment opportunities in the crypto space. The newly launched Ecoterra project is dominating this demand as it recently reached the $5 million milestone in presale.\n\nThe project has come up with an innovative implementation of blockchain technology and tokenomics to tackle the anthropogenic climate crisis. It incentivizes individuals and corporations to play their roles in reversing the harmful effects of global warming.\n\nFor example, companies spend millions of dollars to build an eco-friendly reputation. With Ecoterra, companies can simply purchase recycled products at a cheap cost and earn social credit. Similarly, individuals can earn $ECOTERRA tokens by recycling waste products or by paying their green energy bills through the platform.\n\nThe project has partnered with leading climate action organisation Verra to offer cost-effective carbon offset solutions. Users can reduce their carbon footprint by purchasing these offsets from Ecoterra\u2019s carbon offsets marketplace.\n\nGiven the token\u2019s strong presale and its crucial role in changing the mainstream perception of the crypto industry, it is a likely candidate for several Tier-1 exchange listings including Binance.\n\nInterested investors can become a part of this green movement by purchasing Ecterra tokens either through bank cards or by swapping ETH or USDT tokens.\n\nVisit Ecoterra Presale"

        "title": "SEC officials pushed Hinman to clarify ETH wasn't a security: Court docs - Blockworks",
        "content": "The SEC released hundreds of documents, including emails and notes, after a judge ordered the documents to be unsealed as part of the ongoing legal battle between Ripple and the securities regulator.\n\nThe highly-anticipated documents related to a June 2018 speech from former SEC Division Director William Hinman were released on Tuesday, June 13.\n\nThe documents show how Hinman\u2019s speech \u2014 which clarified that the SEC didn\u2019t believe that ether was a security at the time \u2014 evolved prior to the SEC targeting XRP as a security.\n\nIn his speech, Hinman said, \u201cAnd putting aside the fundraising that accompanied the creation of Ether, based on my understanding of the present state of ether, the Ethereum network and its decentralized structure, current offers and sales of ether are not securities transactions.\u201d\n\nThe released documents show conversations between SEC employees at the time \u2014 including the trading and markets department\u2019s comments \u2014 and Hinman.\n\nIn an email, Hinman said the language around ether \u201cwould be used if we all are in agreement. We also have a call with [Vitalik] Buterin later this week to confirm our understanding of how the Ethereum Foundation operates.\u201d\n\nBrett Redfearn, the director of trading and markets at the time, told Hinman via email his original language on ETH and whether it was a security remained \u201cvague.\u201d Redfearn suggested that Hinman use \u201cstronger\u201d language.\n\nGoogle Document comments show an unnamed editor saying, \u201cAs we discussed, as written, referring to the sentiment within this section of the speech. We think the relevant question as discussed throughout the rest of the speech is whether a digital asset meets the legal standards of a security, not whether it warrants regulation as a security.\u201d\n\nThe comments also show the SEC saying that \u201cwe do not want to suggest that BTC is a security.\u201d\n\nAn additional comment left on the document says:\n\n\u201cWe thought you were going to say that you don\u2019t believe ETH is a security. We think that is a helpful message. This statement, on the other hand, appears likely to create more confusion about the status of ETH. To the extent you don\u2019t say ETH is not a security, please consider confirming the policy rationale to the disclosure regime of the federal securities laws, as you did with respect to Bitcoin earlier in the paragraph.\u201d\n\nEmployees also noted that they had \u201creservations\u201d about including a direct statement on ether in the speech because \u201cit seems that it would be difficult for the agency to take a different position on ether in the future. Further, the rest of the paragraph strongly implies the thinking applies to ether.\u201d\n\n\u201cWithout the sentence about ether, those implications might generate a useful reaction about ether (from purchasers or those in the FinTech space). With the sentence, the reaction seems less likely to focus on the analysis, and more likely to focus on the potential fallout of making a direct statement about ether\u2019s status as a security.\u201d\n\nIn another comment, SEC officials acknowledged that \u201cthe fact that tokens on a sufficiently decentralized network are no longer securities \u2014 and no longer are required to register with all the benefits to investors of registration \u2014 seems to point out what might be considered a \u201cregulatory gap\u201d that exists in this space.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn other words, this speech acknowledges that there is an \u201cother\u201d category,\u201d the comments said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a security because there\u2019s no \u201ccontrolling group\u201d (at least in the Howey sense) yet, like many other things (medication, credit cards) there may be a need for regulation to protect purchasers.\u201d\n\nKnown conflicts of interest\n\nA first batch of emails between Hinman and Shira Pavis Minton, the designated agency ethics official at the SEC, was released in April 2022 after Empower Oversight, a nonprofit whistleblower organization, successfully filed a Freedom of Information Act request.\n\nMinton warned Hinman that he is not to engage in any SEC matters that could impact law firm Simpson Thacher, where he worked before the SEC, due to his financial interest in the firm. He was also advised not to meet with anyone from Simpson Thacher.\n\nHinman met with Josh Bonnie, a partner at Simpson Thacher, several times after being warned about the conflict of interest, Empower Oversight said in an April 2022 statement. The former SEC director also met with the co-founders of and investors in Ethereum ahead of the speech he gave in 2018 declaring ether a token, not a security.\n\nThe April 2022 email release suggested that Hinman and the SEC had an interest in promoting and protecting ether over other, similar tokens. If this were found to be true, it would be a significant win for Ripple.\n\nShortly after these documents revealed the agency may have acted inconsistently with their classification of crypto tokens, a judge ruled that the SEC would not be able to edit or clarify any of the content in the emails ahead of the XRP case, which had already been underway for over a year when the first round of emails dropped.\n\nThe SEC and Ripple are awaiting a summary judgment, which Ripple\u2019s legal team previously said could come before the end of the year. There is a possibility that the judge could rule that there is not sufficient evidence for a summary judgment and the case could go to trial, or Ripple and the SEC could potentially agree on a settlement, although Ripple has said this is an unlikely outcome.\n\nNews analysis by David Canellis\n\nOutside of an outright win against the SEC, the release of the Hinman emails is the Superbowl for XRP investors.\n\nA word of caution, especially as markets push XRP nearly 10% higher: The Hinman speech never explicitly mentioned Ripple \u2014 or any other cryptocurrency apart from bitcoin and ether, for that matter.\n\nIn a bid to defend itself from an antagonistic regulator, Ripple Labs has attempted to draw parallels between Ethereum and its XRP technology, token sales and promotional efforts. To borrow Hinman\u2019s phrasing, if Ethereum can become \u201csufficiently decentralized\u201d over time \u2014 then maybe so too can XRP transform from a security into a commodity.\n\nSuch an evolution would certainly undermine the SEC\u2019s case. Perhaps converting to a slap on the wrist akin to Block.one\u2019s $22 million settlement, after it raised up to $4.4 billion with its own token sale.\n\nBut the XRP Ledger is a different beast than Ethereum \u2014 far lower in terms of validator counts and use cases, but with a more direct line to corporate support in the form of Ripple Labs.\n\nIt may be tempting to believe Hinman\u2019s treatment of Ethereum is analogous to XRP, vindicating the latter by association.\n\nBut to do so would run the risk of underestimating key differences between major blockchain technologies, at a time when regulator pettiness is at an all-time high. How the courts will ultimately navigate that is still anyone\u2019s guess, and these emails could simply bolster the case for ether\u2019s commodity classification, with XRP\u2019s relevance merely tangential.\n\nThe end of the Ripple v. SEC case may well be in sight, but consider the final outcome as hazy as the SEC\u2019s definition of \u201ccrypto security.\u201d\n\nUpdated June 13, 2023 at 11:22 am ET: Additional quotes added from the court documents.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."
