        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nThe amount of Ethereum on centralized exchanges has nearly hit a five-year low, per data from Glassnode.\n\nWith 17.8 million ETH on exchanges, the sum represents 14.85% of the network\u2019s total token supply.\n\nThough large, it\u2019s significantly less than the peak value of 30% reached in the summer of 2020.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nVolatile cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin and Ethereum, leaving centralized exchanges are sometimes seen as a bullish sentiment among investors. Conversely, an influx of cryptocurrencies to exchange is viewed as bearish, as it suggests that investors are moving to these platforms to sell off some of their holdings.\n\nEthereum balance on exchanges. Source: Glassnode .\n\nBitcoin\u2019s stats show much of the same, with the cryptocurrency\u2019s exchange balance dropping to levels not seen since March 2018 at just above 2.23 million BTC.\n\nWhy are investors leaving exchanges?\n\nA closer look at the data reveals that the majority of the decline came in November and December 2022 following the FTX collapse. The stacked balance metric from Glassnode, which shows the individual balance on each exchange, confirms that a significant portion of the decline came from FTX.\n\nAn exodus followed shortly across other major exchanges such as Binance, Kraken, and Coinbase likely due to the contagion fears that spread across the market. This was also seen in the steep spike in sales for hardware wallet providers such as Ledger and Trezor.\n\nThe latest decline in Ethereum balances on exchanges in May also coincides with a rise in staking. The amount of staked ETH surged from 19.3 million before the Shapella upgrade to 21.2 million, rising vertically since the start of May, per Nansen data.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBitcoin\u2019s exchange balance did not decline alongside ETH during the same period, further suggesting that staking played a role in exchange withdrawals."

        "content": "The balance of available Ether (ETH) across crypto exchanges dropped to a five-year low on May 26, bringing the total amount of Ether held on exchanges to 17.86 million. A drastic decline in the exchange supply of ETH like this has not been seen since April 2018.\n\nAccording to Glassnode data, only 14.85% of the total Ether supply is currently held on centralized exchanges, compared with the 25\u201326% of supply held during the 2021 bull run.\n\nThe decline in Ether exchange balances. Source: Glassnode\n\nThe drop in ETH supply began in September 2022, dropping significantly after the FTX crisis in November. Apart from a decline in the exchange balance, Ethereum wallet addresses holding more than 100 ETH have also declined to a six-month low.\n\nTwo significant events could have influenced the decline in ETH balances on centralized exchanges in the recent past. The first is the collapse of the FTX crypto exchange, prompting many to move their crypto assets from exchange wallets to self-custody wallets; the second, and most important, is the Shapella upgrade.\n\nShapella made way for thousands of validators to withdraw their staked ETH. However, contrary to popular belief, a minority of validators decided to unstake, while the majority only withdrew their staking rewards.\n\nThe movement of assets away from exchanges is considered a bullish sign, indicating traders are not looking to sell at the current price. In Ethereum\u2019s case, re-staking ETH is the most apparent reason for the declining exchange supply.\n\nRelated: Ethereum price metrics hint that ETH might not sell off after the Shapella hard fork\n\nMajor crypto exchanges like Binance, Bitfinex, Kraken and others that supported the Shapella upgrade saw a significant outflow of ETH from their exchange wallets, leading to the current balance decline.\n\nETH withdrawal from crypto exchanges. Source: Nansen\n\nAs Cointelegraph reported earlier, in the week after the Shapella upgrade, the amount of ETH being staked surpassed the amount of ETH being withdrawn. Another report from Glassnode estimated that less than 1% of staked ETH was expected to be sold. Thus, a significant chunk of ETH moving away from centralized exchanges returned to staking.\n\nMagazine: 2023 is a make-or-break year for blockchain gaming: Play-to-own"

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nGlobal financial services behemoth VISA recently shared a range of significant milestones in its ongoing pursuit of digital asset payments and seamless crypto onboarding.\n\nIn a blog titled \u201cRethinking Digital Transactions with Account Abstraction\u201d earlier this week, the firm disclosed it is now exploring how gas fees can be redesigned using Account Abstraction on the Ethereum blockchain, enabling secure and automatic payments for self-custodial wallets. It then added that it is deeply engaged in studying Ethereum\u2019s proposal ERC-4337 for digital payments.\n\nRolled out on the Ethereum mainnet in early March, ERC-4337 is a key component of VISA\u2019s exploration, as it adds the ability for smart contracts to transact on behalf of the user.\n\nThe firm also noted that it has successfully deployed two sets of Paymaster contracts on the Ethereum Goerli testnet, a move aimed at showcasing the potential for redesigning gas fees on the blockchain to improve user convenience. Mustafa Bedawala of Visa\u2019s crypto department observed that the firm\u2019s first paymaster contract is focused on investigating whether users can pay transaction fees with alternative tokens, like dollar stablecoins or, potentially, CBDCs apart from ETH.\n\n\u201cTo transact on the Ethereum blockchain today, a user needs to acquire ETH to pay for gas fees; similarly, to transact on Polygon blockchain, a user needs to acquire the native token MATIC. Is there a solution that eliminates the need to accumulate a different range of native blockchain tokens solely for the purpose of paying for gas?\u201d wrote Visa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe other paymaster contract is aimed at completely covering gas fees for user transactions, addressing a major pain point in the crypto space.\n\n\u201cAccount Abstraction offers a solution by allowing users to bypass these costs if a third party, such as a fintech wallet provider, is willing to cover them. In this case, the wallet provider or dApps can act as Paymasters, covering gas fees for users and significantly reducing friction. The ERC-4337 Paymaster concept can be a potential way to incentivize user adoption by making it free for users to transact through their wallet platform,\u201d the firm added.\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has previously expressed his longstanding interest in gas fees Account Abstraction, calling it a dream of the Ethereum developer community. Buterin recommends the use of social recovery wallets and multi-signature wallets for crypto investors to achieve self-custody of their assets.\n\nThus, with the imminent implementation of ERC-4337 and the emergence of smart contract wallets, wallet security, as well as payments, are expected to improve significantly for VISA users opening doors to wider adoption of cryptocurrencies."

        "title": "Dogecoin Proves It's a Serious Blockchain, Flips Ethereum Transaction Count - Blockworks",
        "content": "Dogecoin is undergoing a surge in network spam so dramatic that it\u2019s now processing more transactions than the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nOver the past week, the memecoin network handled more than 7.9 million transactions, up nearly 11% on Ethereum\u2019s 7.2 million and more than double Bitcoin\u2019s count.\n\nNot bad for a chain that has handled only 30,000 daily transactions on average since 2015 \u2014 less than 5% of Ethereum\u2019s.\n\nThe culprit is Bitcoin Ordinals. Or more precisely, opportunistic crypto fans eager to capitalize on the inscriptions hype.\n\nBitcoin Ordinals aren\u2019t exactly the same as the NFTs you might find on Ethereum or Solana. Those non-fungible tokens are minted via smart contract and adhere to their own token standards enforced by wallets, marketplaces and other key infrastructure across Web3.\n\nOrdinals are instead defined by data \u201cinscribed\u201d into individual satoshis (sats for short). Sats are BTC\u2019s smallest denomination: 0.00000001 BTC currently worth $0.00027. A craft developer recently figured out how to forever imbue sats with special properties, such as enough data to render a JPEG or DOOM clone.\n\nBRC-20 tokens \u2014 a play on Ethereum\u2019s ERC-20 standard for run-of-the-mill tokens \u2014 quickly followed Ordinals. Hype for Bitcoin-powered altcoins and collectible sats triggered a renaissance for blockspace demand, driving up fees while pushing transaction counts and mempool backlogs to record highs.\n\nIf we consider Ordinals in the same genre of digital asset as Bored Apes, Bitcoin is now the number-two blockchain for NFTs behind Ethereum.\n\nDogecoin\u2019s transaction count exploded past other prominent blockchains over the past few weeks\n\nDoge see, Doge do\n\nDue to similarities between Bitcoin and Dogecoin (a code fork of a code fork of Bitcoin), it didn\u2019t take long for developers to code methods for minting Dogecoin tokens in much the same way as Ordinals and BRC-20s \u2014 except with a \u201cD\u201d instead of a \u201cB.\u201d\n\nBut Bitcoiners have multiple platforms on which traders can swap Ordinals and BRC-20s, including crypto exchange wallets. Dogecoin doesn\u2019t.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s BRC-20s in particular have been helped by an experimental token standard, something akin to Ethereum\u2019s ERC-20s.\n\nThe standard set enough technical parameters so that infrastructure (wallets, marketplaces and the like) can facilitate trading and whatnot without running into headaches, like duplicate listings and overtly broken code.\n\nBRC-20 and Ordinals individually have recently made up more than half of all Bitcoin transactions, and it\u2019s unclear just how many DRC-20-related transactions are flowing through Dogecoin right now. No tools have been built to sort DRC-20 outputs from others, which makes it difficult to quantify exactly how many Dogecoin tokens are being minted every minute.\n\nIn any case, it\u2019s surely an impressive chunk. Multiple DRC-20 token transactions are found in practically every single block right now (which occur every one minute on average). They are easy to spot, as they usually come with a 0.001 DOGE fee attached ($0.000071).\n\nPseudonymous Dogecoin developer inevitable360 told Blockworks that they classify DRC-20 transactions like these as spam because anyone can clone or replicate the exact same token.\n\nUnlike Bitcoin and Ethereum, there is no DRC-20 token standard for Dogecoin. So, many tokens are being minted under the same name, making it practically impossible to form a legitimate market around them.\n\nThere\u2019s still legitimate Dogecoin activity alongside speculators minting Dogecoin tokens via the one or two wallets that support them in their current form (which have been caught boosting fees to apparently profit from the hype).\n\nThe median transaction value is nearly 77 DOGE ($5.46). If DRC-20s were truly the overwhelming majority, then that figure would be far lower.\n\nBitcoin Ordinals already have their own marketplaces\n\nIt might be spam, but it\u2019s honest work\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, much of the recent Bitcoin activity has also been labeled spam: effectively worthless transactions with no reason to exist but to exist; abundant purely because creation is cheap and the potential payoff is large.\n\nGranted: Ethereum layer-2 networks such as Arbitrum and Optimism are each processing tons of transactions. More than a million per day for the former, in fact. If we add those in with Ethereum, then the blockchain dominates Dogecoin by far.\n\nEthereum fees are also high right now. High enough to apparently dissuade a portion of useless trade, particularly NFTs. But there\u2019s something to be said for Dogecoin in this instance.\n\nMany deride Dogecoin as a joke carefully crafted to trap crypto newbies into gambling on memecoins during bull runs.\n\nThere may be some element of truth to that. But historically, Dogecoin has served as a lucrative alternative for bitcoin miners at times when mining BTC was simply not profitable. An unsung hero, in those cases.\n\nDogecoin is also merge-minable with Litecoin, allowing miners to share hash rate between the two to provide some element of flexibility in support of a multichain future. It just so happens that right now, there appears to be more activity tied to DRC-20 speculation today than that tied to the use of Ethereum mainnet overall.\n\nAnd Dogecoin still has lower median fees: $0.00096 compared to Ethereum\u2019s $3.13 \u2014 no doubt an uncomfortable fact for many ETH fans.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."
