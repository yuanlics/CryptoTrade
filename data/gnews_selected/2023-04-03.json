        "title": "Ethereum Validator Goes Rogue, Frontruns MEV Bots for $25M - Blockworks",
        "content": "Ethereum validators hellbent on maximizing revenue can employ special bots to extract the most value possible from every single block. Some of those bots were just attacked for $25 million.\n\nA rogue validator used a tool for obtaining the maximum extractable value (MEV) from the Ethereum blockchain and carried out a \u201csandwich attack.\u201d\n\nBut first, understanding sandwich attacks takes unpacking MEV as a concept.\n\nMEV is essentially frontrunning. MEV bots find additional revenue by exploiting knowledge of which transactions are about to be processed. This is done most commonly via arbitrage (taking advantage of price differences between exchanges).\n\nThese opportunities are often discovered by other revenue seekers, known as \u201csearchers.\u201d Once searchers identify profitable trades, they will submit them to a public mempool and wait for an Ethereum validator to approve the transaction.\n\nSome searchers have realized they can frontrun those trades by using bots that scan the public mempool, proposing blocks which have replaced the trade with their own transaction to grab another searcher\u2019s MEV.\n\nCompanies such as Flashbots prevent these kinds of events with tools known as MEV boost relays. Relays make sure MEV transactions are not revealed in the public mempool, so MEV hunters can\u2019t frontrun each other.\n\nWhen there\u2019s a will to frontrun MEV bots\u2026\n\nMEV relays are formed by two parties: proposers and builders. Proposers make bids on transactions, and builders secure the highest bid and generate blocks containing their transactions. They then send the blocks to validators, who will approve the transaction.\n\n\u201cOne of the core ideas behind Proposer-Builder Separation is that proposers cannot be allowed to see the contents of the block they\u2019re signing until they\u2019ve signed the block,\u201d a research analyst at Paradigm who goes by samczsun said in a tweet. \u201cTheoretically, this makes it extremely hard for a malicious proposer to deconstruct bundles.\u201d\n\nAs for this weekend\u2019s $25 million sandwich attack: Eighteen days earlier, the exploiter deposited 32 ETH ($57,500) to become a validator. This meant the exploiter was a proposer who could also reorder block transactions.\n\nIt\u2019s likely that once they were able to propose a block as a validator, the attacker included additional transactions that weren\u2019t initially inside the block made by the builder. This enabled the attacker to front-run the front-running MEV bot, a Blockworks research analyst explained in a tweet.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nThis is considered a sandwich attack \u2014 where the victim\u2019s transaction is stuck between two transactions created by the searcher.\n\nIn this case, the sandwich attacker pushed transactions worth $25 million across three main addresses, per PeckShield. Tokens gained include wrapped ETH, wrapped bitcoin, tether, USDC and DAI.\n\nThe incident was first identified by pseudonymous Twitter user 3155.eth. Usually, if a validator tampers with a transaction, they are slashed for malicious behavior and they lose some of their ETH stake.\n\nFlashbot developers have rolled out a patch to address the vulnerability.\n\n\u201cNow, mev-boost-relay will refuse to return the transactions if the block was not successfully sent to the network. Then, just for good measure, it delays the response by a second too,\u201d Paradigm\u2019s samczsun said.\n\nUpdated April 4, 2023 at 9:52 am ET: Flashbot developers have already rolled out a patch to address the vulnerability.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "A guide to Ethereum's Shanghai Upgrade - Unchained - Unchained",
        "content": "In 2022, Ethereum developers pulled off a dramatic upgrade known as the Merge, changing the way transactions are validated on the network.\n\nPreviously, that task was the preserve of thousands of powerful \u201cmining\u201d computers, which checked the authenticity of transactions by way of an energy-intensive process known as Proof of Work. The Merge introduced the greener Proof-of-Stake model, replacing the miners with \u201cvalidators,\u201d users who have deposited at least 32 units of Ethereum\u2019s cryptocurrency, ETH, on the network.\n\nThat made the network something like 99% more energy-efficient, and around $26 billion has since been locked up on the network by over 520,000 validators.\n\nBut all is not perfect. Though validators are theoretically able to earn rewards on their deposit in the form of newly mined ETH, they still can\u2019t actually redeem these rewards\u2014or their initial deposit.\n\nNor has it helped that many of the validators began staking funds in 2020, via an early \u201ctestnet\u201d iteration of the staking protocol that was later \u201cmerged\u201d with Ethereum proper in 2022. The crypto market has undergone a series of violent swings since then, and a lot of stakers want their money back.\n\nWith more than two years having passed since staking was first made possible, it\u2019s safe to say that the upcoming Shanghai Upgrade, which will introduce a withdrawal feature, is a big deal.\n\nShanghai Upgrade\n\nScheduled for April 2023, the Shanghai Upgrade is arguably the most anticipated network upgrade to Ethereum since the Merge. Though it also includes a number of Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIP) designed to reduce gas costs (transaction fees), most of the attention is centered on EIP-4895\u2014the holy grail of EIPs, which enables staking withdrawal.\n\nThere will be two types of withdrawals that come with Shanghai: partial and full.\n\nIf a validator wants to remain a part of the network, they can then opt for a partial withdrawal, keeping their minimum threshold of 32 ETH on the chain and redeeming the excess to their wallet address.\n\nUnder a full withdrawal, the validator is free to withdraw the entirety of their stake, but in doing so would forgo their participation in the chain.\n\nThere is one minor caveat. Validators who staked on the 2020 \u201ctestnet,\u201d known as the Beacon Chain, were given withdrawal credentials, known as \u201c0x00,\u201d but these are no longer valid. In order to execute a full or partial withdrawal, they will first need to upgrade their credentials to 0x01.\n\nWill Unstaking ETH Trigger a Sell-off?\n\nNot necessarily. To really understand this, we need to look at how many participants are actually \u201cilliquid stakers\u201d\u2014that is, stakers who can\u2019t immediately access their deposits.\n\nA big part of the staking market constitutes liquid staking participants provided through services like Lido as well as centralized exchanges like Coinbase and Binance. Not everyone has 32 ETH to tuck away in a deposit contract, so many users have participated in ETH staking with a liquid token tied to the value of their deposit. Since they have always had access to liquidity, it\u2019s fair to assume they aren\u2019t looking to sell off their holdings.\n\nAround 52% of stakers are illiquid, and while the majority of staked ETH is underwater, at least 2 million ETH were sent to the contract when the asset was trading between $400 and $700. This cohort might be looking to sell their ETH, but then again, they did send their tokens to the contract without a timeline for withdrawals and are likely ardent supporters of the cryptocurrency.\n\nEthereum Impotence Proposal\n\nBefore the details around withdrawals were ratified, there was significant controversy over the speed of its implementation. Many developers hoped to make the upgrade compatible with a sleeker, new Ethereum encoding method known as simple serialize (SSZ), which would have delayed its release by a few months. Popular calls to quickly enable withdrawals, however, led to developers tacking the feature onto April\u2019s Shanghai Upgrade\u2014potentially rushing it through and risking technical woes in the future.\n\nWhen and How Will Shanghai Be Deployed?\n\nShanghai was originally scheduled for March 2023 but has been postponed to sometime in April 2023. Developers make the decisions based on their assessment of progress, so this tentative date is subject to change.\n\nWhile deployment on the mainnet is still a few weeks away as of the time of writing, some have already begun testing out the withdrawal feature on one of Ethereum\u2019s testnets e.g., Zheijang and Sepolia."
