        "content": "The cryptocurrency market witnessed a surge on Monday, amid BlackRock\u2019s amended S-1 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nCryptocurrency Gains +/- Price (Recorded 9:30 p.m. EST) Bitcoin BTC/USD +4.93% $43,085 Ethereum ETH/USD +2.83% $2,238 Dogecoin DOGE/USD +0.91% $0.093\n\nWhat Happened: The filing revealed the proposed spot Bitcoin ETF will bear the ticker IBIT.\n\nThe revised filing provides additional details concerning the creation and redemption methodology to be implemented by the fund. This topic has been the subject of recent discussions between BlackRock and SEC officials.\n\n\u201cThe Trust issues and redeems Baskets on a continuous basis,\u201d according to the filing. \u201cThese transactions will take place in exchange for cash. Subject to the In-Kind Regulatory Approval, these transactions may also take place in exchange for bitcoin.\u201d\n\n\u201cBlackRock has gone cash only,\u201d Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Eric Balchunas wrote on X. \u201cThat's basically a wrap. Debate over. In-kind will have to wait. It's all about getting ducks in row bf holidays. Good sign.\u201d\n\nAccording to data from Coinglass, BTC shorts amounting to over $37 million were liquidated in the past 12 hours.\n\nTop Gainer (24 Hour)\n\nCryptocurrency Gains +/- Price (Recorded 9:30 p.m. EDT) Sei (SEI) +38.09% $0.31 Woo Network (WOO) +23.17% $0.45 Injective (INJ) +21.91% $37.26\n\nThe global crypto market cap has reached $1.56 trillion, marking a 2.06% decrease in the last 24 hours.\n\nOn Monday, the S&P 500 continued its winning streak of seven weeks, maintaining its momentum and rising further. The S&P 500 showed a positive trend, climbing up by 0.45% to 4,740.56. Additionally, the Nasdaq Composite index, which is heavily tilted towards technology stocks, also saw a boost, advancing by 0.61% to close the day at 14,904.81.\n\nSee More: Best Cryptocurrency Scanners\n\nAnalyst Notes: According to cryptocurrency analyst Michael Van de Poppe, it seems likely that Bitcoin will hit its low point before rising again. He notes that \"profit taking end of year, most likely from later this week/early next week we\u2019ll be back in up-only mode.\"\n\nOn-chain analyst, PlanB, on Monday shared some exciting insight that could lead Bitcoin (BTC) to a new all-time high in as little as four months. During a ask-me-anything (AMA) session, the quantitative analyst disclosed that the approval of spot market Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) could be the key that unlocks explosive growth for the leading cryptocurrency, ultimately pushing it to break past its previous record-high before April 2024\u2019s halving event.\n\n\"The halving is in April 2024, so that's four months from now. A possible all-time high would be $69,000 \u2013 that would be a 50%+ increase in the next four months. I think it's very well possible. In fact, if the ETF gets approved before the halving \u2013 and I think everybody's looking at January for that \u2013 if the ETF gets approved by January, then I think we'll have this all-time high in the pocket, and $69,000 would be a low estimate \u2013 I think we'll go straight to $100,000.\"\n\nSantiment, an on-chain analytics firm, has reported that \"in the latest case of \u201ctraders get fearful, market prices get cheerful\u201d, \"crypto market caps rebounded big on Monday. Aftermarket fatigue began kicking in last Friday, posts about Bitcoin began skewing very negatively in tone.\n\nPhoto by stockphoto-graf on Shutterstock\n\nRead Next: Jim Cramer Advises Against Using Binance, Provokes Strong Reactions From Twitter Users"
