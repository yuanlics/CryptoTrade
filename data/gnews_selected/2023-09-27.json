        "content": "This constant stream of new staking participants \u2014 the current number of validators sits at about 800,000 \u2014 has been so substantial that it has even led some to propose a hard cap on the number of new validators that can enter the pool on any given day. The rationale being that the current \u201cchurn\u201d limit of 12 new validators per epoch, (which equates to 2,700 validators, 86,400 ETH, or roughly $138,000,000 per day), is unsustainable long term. A queue controls how many can join at any given time and the capacity of that queue increases as the network grows*, which could eventually stress the functionality of the network."

        "title": "Ethereum decentralization takes hit as Blocknative discontinues its relayer - Blockworks",
        "content": "Concerns about increased centralization on the Ethereum network have intensified, following Blocknative\u2019s decision to discontinue its MEV-boost relay on Tuesday.\n\nRelayers play a pivotal role in settling transactions on Ethereum. They ensure timely and efficient processing, bridging the gap between users and the blockchain by batching and broadcasting transactions. With the exit of Blocknative, the relayer landscape is becoming increasingly concentrated. At time of writing, only four relayers remain active on the network.\n\nFollowing Ethereum\u2019s transition to proof-of-stake, the roles of block proposing and block building became distinct processes. MEV-boost software was developed to facilitate an efficient market between these proposers, which submit transaction bundles to validators, and builders, which organize the transactions in a specific order.\n\nFollowing the Merge, a group of well-resourced Ethereum block builders, formerly including Blocknative, began running their own relays.\n\nToday, nearly all Ethereum transactions use MEV-boost relays. 93% of Ethereum blocks created in the past 14 days made use of MEV-boost, according to data compiled on mevboost.pics. At the time that data was compiled, five entities were responsible for relaying 98% of the MEV-boosted transactions, per relayscan.io.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nAccording to Blocknative, it dropped its MEV-boost relay because continuing was no longer economically viable. The four remaining relayers collect no fees for their services, making this core piece of Ethereum infrastructure unprofitable for its operators. A recent Flashbots community proposal aims to start a \u201cPBS Guild\u201d which would solicit Ethereum community donations in part to reward relayers.\n\nUri Klarman, CEO of relaying entity Bloxroute, believes that a relayer fee mechanism should be activated, however. He suggests that block validators anticipate this move.\n\n\u201cI heard from multiple validators, like, \u2018yeah, we don\u2019t understand how you [haven\u2019t charged] us until this point,\u2019\u201d Klarman told Blockworks.\n\nKlarman said relayer fees would require some level of consensus between the remaining relaying entities and, ideally, the Ethereum community. If the economic incentive problem isn\u2019t fixed, though, Klarman thinks the perceived centralization of MEV-boost relays could grow worse.\n\n\u201cIn a year, if everything stays the same [\u2026] I think it\u2019s very reasonable that there will be [fewer] relays than there are today,\u201d Klarman said.\n\nElias Simos, the CEO of Ethereum data platform Rated, told Blockworks he is ambivalent toward a future where Ethereum continues to rely on its four major relayers.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re demonstrably long-term actors in the space, so they have a lot to lose [if Ethereum is harmed],\u201d Simos said. \u201cBut at the same time, is that enough?\u201d\n\nUpdated Sept. 28, 2023 at 10:22 am ET: Updated to clarify that Ethereum transactions are now handled by four relayers.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "Ethereum OFAC compliance dips to 45% post-Merge upgrade - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The historic Merge upgrade from Sept. 2022 \u2014 which marked Ethereum\u2019s transition from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS) \u2014 resulted in the overall decline in compliance with standards laid down by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC).\n\nEthereum blocks adhering to OFAC compliance censor certain transactions, which has a negative impact on the neutrality of the Ethereum ecosystem. In early August 2022, OFAC sanctioned Tornado Cash and several Ether (ETH) addresses associated with it due to its ability to mask and anonymize transactions.\n\nBefore the Merge upgrade, Ethereum\u2019s OFAC compliance increased exponentially as entities such as crypto exchanges opted to run censoring MEV-Boost relays on their validators. The list of top censorship offenders is populated by popular platforms such as Binance, Celsius Network, Bitfinex, Ledger Live, Huobi (HTX) and Coinbase, according to MEV Watch data.\n\nList of entities running censoring MEV relays on their validators are actively harming Ethereum\u2019s credible neutrality. Source: MEV Watch\n\nHowever, the overall OFAC compliance of Ethereum blocks has declined significantly. In November 2022, 78% of the total Ethereum blocks complied with OFAC regulations. As of today, Sept. 27, Ethereum\u2019s OFAC compliance dropped to 30%, recording an overall reduction of 57%.\n\nPost-Merge daily OFAC-compliant Ethereum blocks. Source: MEV Watch\n\nCountering OFAC compliance requires operators to use relays that do not censor according to OFAC compliance requirements. There are seven major MEV-boost relays that are most commonly used: Flashbots, BloXroute Max Profit, BloXroute Ethical, BloXroute Regulated, BlockNative, Manifold and Eden. However, not all systems adhere to OFAC compliance, according to MEV Watch:\n\n\u201cOf the 7 available major relays only 3 do not censor according to OFAC compliance requirements.\u201d\n\nIt is also important to note that not all blocks built by OFAC-compliant relays are censoring; however, all blocks built by OFAC-compliant relays will censor when non-compliant transactions are broadcast to the network.\n\nWhile OFAC regulations primarily target United States-based organizations, validators outside the U.S. must consider running non-censoring relays for the benefit of the network.\n\nRelated: US Treasury sanctions Ethereum wallet tied to cartel over \u2018illicit fentanyl trafficking\u2019\n\nAmid Ethereum\u2019s reduced OFAC compliance, Grayscale made the decision to abandon all the rights to PoW Ethereum tokens (ETHPoW). However, the decision was attributed to a lack of liquidity in the market. According to an official announcement:\n\n\u201cAs such, it is not possible to exercise the rights to acquire and sell the ETHPoW tokens, and on behalf of the record date shareholders, Grayscale is abandoning the rights to these assets.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, some cryptocurrency investment firms like ETC Group have attempted to launch dedicated EthereumPoW exchange-traded products (ETPs).\n\nMagazine: \u2018AI has killed the industry\u2019: EasyTranslate boss on adapting to change"

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nDespite uncertainty and a YoY decline, Ethereum has generated $10Bn in income in seven years.\n\nIt surpassed software giants such as Microsoft and Facebook.\n\nAs per sources, Ethereum\u2019s network revenue could grow to $51Bn per year by 2030 from the current $2.6Bn.\n\nSince its inception in 2015, Vitalik Buterin\u2019s cryptocurrency, Ethereum, has amassed $10 billion in income, beating Facebook and Microsoft in terms of growth rate.\n\nIn practice, whereas Ethereum would have taken 7.5 years to reach the $10 billion revenue milestone, Facebook (now Meta) appears to have taken somewhat longer and Microsoft a full 19 years.\n\nAs Crypto Portfolio Manager at cryptocurrency brokerage firm Caleb & Brown points out , such a result suggests that crypto protocols, like software, may be the next to become worldwide.\n\nFactors Influencing Ethereum\u2019s Earnings\n\nEthereum\u2019s popularity is driven by its versatility. Unlike Bitcoin, which primarily serves as a secure transactional network, Ethereum distinguishes itself by enabling the deployment of complex protocols across diverse industries. This adaptability makes Ethereum a preferred platform for applications in finance, gaming, art, and more.\n\nAs of September 26, Ethereum\u2019s native cryptocurrency, ETH was trading at approximately $1,625, with the Ethereum network boasting a market capitalization exceeding $195 billion.\n\nEthereum primarily generates revenue through transaction fees, denominated in gas. The cost of these fees varies depending on the complexity of the transaction.\n\nBasic transfers have lower fees, while smart contract-based transactions, which ensure trustless execution, are usually more expensive. Transaction costs increase with the complexity of network transactions.\n\nEthereum\u2019s transaction fee revenue goes to validators, who secure the network and confirm transactions. They earn block rewards and transaction fees for their role, incentivizing them to maintain network integrity and smooth operations.\n\nPositive ETH Price Outlook\n\nPositive predictions on the price of Ethereum (ETH) appear to be prevalent in September 2023.\n\nThese projections are based on ETH\u2019s past performance in comparison to BTC and its four-year halving cycle.\n\nIn reality, it appears that ETH has outperformed BTC during bull markets, but during bear markets, ETH looks to suffer more than BTC.\n\nAt the time of writing, the price of ETH had increased by more than 15% over the previous year. In fact, ETH is currently valued $1.627 . However, by mid-April 2023, ETH had reached an annual price high of more than $2,000.\n\nA $51 Billion Revenue Projection by 2030\n\nIn conclusion, the projected revenue potential of reaching $51 billion by 2030 not only underscores the untapped opportunities within the Ethereum network but also signifies the promising growth prospects that decentralized platforms may experience in the years ahead.\n\nDespite market uncertainties, Ethereum\u2019s versatility and applications position it for sustained growth, showcasing blockchain\u2019s transformative potential across industries"

        "content": "Will Ethereum Recover? A Deep Dive into the Future of ETH\n\nCryptocurrencies have taken the financial world by storm, and Ethereum (ETH) has been at the forefront of this revolution.\n\nAs one of the largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, Ethereum has gained significant attention from investors, traders, and enthusiasts alike.\n\nHowever, the recent market volatility and regulatory concerns have left many wondering: Will Ethereum recover and continue its upward trajectory?\n\nIn this article, we will explore the future of Ethereum, analyzing key factors such as its transition to a proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain, price forecasts, and the overall market sentiment.\n\nAlso read: Cloud & Crypto-Based Gaming the End for Xbox, PlayStation?\n\nSource: CNN\n\nUnderstanding Ethereum\u2019s Current Challenges\n\nBefore diving into Ethereum\u2019s recovery potential, it\u2019s essential to understand its current challenges.\n\nOne of the main concerns is the transition from a proof-of-work (PoW) to a proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain, also known as the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade.\n\nThis transition addresses scalability issues and reduces energy consumption, making the network more sustainable.\n\nThe shift to PoS introduces a new consensus mechanism where validators are chosen to create new blocks based on the number of coins they hold and are willing to \u201cstake\u201d as collateral.\n\nWhile PoS has several advantages over PoW, such as increased security and scalability, the transition process has been complex and time-consuming.\n\nAs a result, Ethereum has faced delays and uncertainty, causing some investors to question its future prospects.\n\nAdditionally, the crypto market has experienced significant volatility, with prices of many cryptocurrencies fluctuating wildly.\n\nConcerns over regulatory actions and potential bans in certain countries have also added to the uncertainty surrounding Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies. These challenges have led to price fluctuations and dampened investor sentiment.\n\nAlso read: Crypto-Friendly Banks in Europe?\n\nThe Potential of Proof-of-Stake (PoS) Blockchain\n\nOne of the key factors driving Ethereum\u2019s ability to recover is the transition to a PoS blockchain. PoS has several advantages over PoW, including reduced energy consumption, increased security, and improved scalability.\n\nPoS allows for a more sustainable and environmentally friendly blockchain network by eliminating the need for resource-intensive mining.\n\nThe shift to PoS is a vital Ethereum milestone, addressing network scalability issues.\n\nAdditionally, PoS will reward users for staking their ETH in the network.\n\nThe PoS shift will introduce staking rewards for users who participate by staking their ETH.\n\nThis incentivizes users to hold and stake their coins, potentially reducing selling pressure and increasing demand for ETH. As more users participate in staking, the network\u2019s security is strengthened, further enhancing Ethereum\u2019s appeal to investors.\n\nPrice Forecasts: What the Experts Say\n\nSource: Forbes\n\nPrice forecasts can provide valuable insights into the future performance of Ethereum.\n\nWhile it\u2019s important to approach these forecasts cautiously, they can help inform investment decisions and shape market sentiment.\n\nLet\u2019s look at some of the price predictions made by experts and analysts.\n\nCoinCodex Study\n\nAccording to a study by CoinCodex, Ethereum could recover to a price of $28,700 by the end of 2025. This analysis considers Ethereum\u2019s price volatility and the cyclical nature of Bitcoin halvings, which historically put upward pressure on the entire crypto market.\n\nCrypto trader Kaleo has predicted that Ethereum could hit $3,000 in 2023. Kaleo has a track record of successful market trend predictions, although predictions should be cautiously approached.\n\nRenowned investor Cathie Wood, CEO of Ark Invest, is massively bullish on Ethereum. She has estimated that Ethereum could reach all-time highs of between $170,000 and $180,000 by 2030.\n\nWood is optimistic because Ethereum can disrupt traditional finance and underpins the DeFi ecosystem.\n\nThese predictions highlight the potential for Ethereum\u2019s price to rise significantly in the coming years. However, it\u2019s important to remember that the crypto market is highly volatile and subject to various external factors, so caution should always be exercised when making investment decisions.\n\nIs Ethereum a Good Investment?\n\nWhether Ethereum is a good investment depends on various factors, including your risk tolerance, investment goals, and market outlook.\n\nWhile Ethereum has shown significant growth and a strong track record, it\u2019s essential to consider both the potential rewards and risks of investing in this cryptocurrency.\n\nOne of the key advantages of Ethereum is its position as the leading smart contract platform. Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with predefined conditions, enabling decentralized applications to run on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nThe widespread adoption of smart contracts has opened up various possibilities, from decentralized finance to non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and decentralized exchanges (DEXs).\n\nFurthermore, the transition to a PoS blockchain with Ethereum 2.0 has the potential to increase the network\u2019s scalability and security significantly. This upgrade could attract more developers and users to the Ethereum ecosystem, driving demand for ETH and potentially increasing its value.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s important to consider the risks associated with investing in Ethereum. The crypto market is highly volatile, and prices can fluctuate rapidly. Regulatory actions and government interventions can also impact the market sentiment and the value of cryptocurrencies.\n\nAdditionally, technological risks, such as potential vulnerabilities in smart contracts or security breaches, should be considered.\n\nWhether Ethereum is a good investment depends on your circumstances and risk tolerance.\n\nDoing thorough research, consulting with financial advisors, and only investing what you can afford to lose is always recommended.\n\nThe Future of Ethereum: Eth Price Around the Merge\n\nSource: Reuters\n\nOne of the most anticipated events for Ethereum is the upcoming merge, which will combine the existing PoW chain with the new PoS chain.\n\nThis merger aims to bring together the best of both worlds, combining the security and decentralization of PoW with the efficiency and sustainability of PoS.\n\nThe merge is expected to impact the Ethereum network and its price significantly.\n\nAs the network transitions to a more energy-efficient and scalable PoS consensus mechanism, it could attract more investors and developers to the ecosystem. This increased interest and participation could drive up the demand for ETH and positively impact its price.\n\nMoreover, the merger will also introduce changes to the Ethereum supply dynamics. With PoS, users can stake their ETH and earn staking rewards.\n\nThis process incentivizes users to hold onto their coins, potentially reducing the selling pressure and increasing demand for ETH. As the supply of ETH on exchanges decreases, it could create upward pressure on the price.\n\nWhile predicting the exact price movements around the merger is challenging, the general sentiment is optimistic. The market anticipates the merger will unlock new potential for Ethereum, positioning it as a leading blockchain platform and potentially driving its price higher.\n\nTechnical Analysis and Price Forecasts\n\nTechnical analysis can provide valuable insights into the future price movements of Ethereum based on historical data and market trends.\n\nAnalysts can make predictions about the future direction of ETH\u2019s price by analyzing price charts and using various indicators.\n\nBased on artificial intelligence-assisted technical analysis, some price forecasts suggest that Ethereum could experience significant growth in the coming years.\n\nThese forecasts consider historical price patterns, trading volume, and market sentiment.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s important to remember that technical analysis is not foolproof and should be used with other forms of analysis and information.\n\nThe crypto market is highly volatile and can be influenced by various factors, including market sentiment, regulatory actions, and global economic conditions.\n\nLong-Term Ethereum Price Outlook\n\nLooking beyond the short-term price fluctuations, the long-term outlook for Ethereum to recover remains promising. As one of the most established cryptocurrencies with a robust ecosystem, Ethereum is well-positioned to continue its growth and innovation.\n\nGrowing dApp use, DeFi growth, and Ethereum\u2019s industry integration boost its long-term potential.\n\nEthereum\u2019s smart contracts and scalability enhancements attract developers and users alike.\n\nEthereum\u2019s solid foundation and blockchain\u2019s rising appeal hint at a resilient and thriving future despite future challenges.\n\nSource: Pixabay\n\nConclusion: The Future of Ethereum\n\nThis article explores Ethereum\u2019s chance to recover and its future, hinging on PoS transition, price predictions, and market sentiment.\n\nWhile Ethereum faces challenges and uncertainties, it also presents significant opportunities for investors and enthusiasts.\n\nThe shift to a PoS blockchain with Ethereum 2.0 has the potential to address scalability issues, increase security, and reduce energy consumption, making the network more efficient and sustainable.\n\nPrice forecasts and technical analysis suggest that Ethereum could experience significant growth in the coming years, driven by increased adoption, staking rewards, and market sentiment.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s important to cautiously approach investing in Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe crypto market is highly volatile, and prices can fluctuate rapidly. Regulatory actions and technological risks should also be considered. Conduct thorough research, seek advice from financial professionals, and only invest what you can afford to lose.\n\nIn conclusion, while the future of Ethereum is not without challenges, its strong fundamentals, growing ecosystem, and innovation potential make it an exciting cryptocurrency to watch.\n\nAs the crypto market evolves, Ethereum\u2019s recovery and growth potential will be shaped by technological advancements, market dynamics, and investor sentiment."
