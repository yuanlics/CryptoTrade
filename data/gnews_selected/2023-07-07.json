The update was later confirmed by BarnBridge CEO Tyler Ward.\n\nBarnBridge products, powered by Ethereum, focus on tokenizing risk exposure. They aim to provide crypto users new ways to hedge their positions. Blockworks has reached out to BarnBridge for comment.\n\nIn a bid to reduce further legal liability, BarnBridge is shutting all existing liquidity pools (deployed to Ethereum, Arbitrum and Optimism) while restricting the creation of new ones, per the statement. About $1.2 million is currently in those pools.\n\nAll work on BarnBridge products should also cease, Park warned, adding that individuals would no longer be compensated for any work related to the project \u201cuntil further notice.\u201d\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nBarnBridge DAO, which is governed by BOND token holders, recently elected to retain Park as legal counsel in a Snapshot vote on Monday. BOND is down almost 10% following the investigation disclosure.\n\nBarnBridge co-founder Tyler Ward tweeted Friday that he is leaving crypto.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nThe development is the latest in a string of actions taken against crypto firms, including within the DeFi sector.\n\nThe Commodities Futures Trading Commission last year targeted margin-focused DeFi platform Ooki DAO, a case which it won by default judgment in June. Experts say that outcome only has limited power to set precedent.\n\nLast month, the SEC labeled a number of cryptocurrencies securities including algorand (ALGO), decentraland (MANA), polygon (MATIC) and dash (DASH) as part of cases filed against crypto exchanges Coinbase and Binance.\n\nIntercontinental Exchange-owned Bakkt delisted solana (SOL), MATIC and cardano (ADA) shortly after.

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nNoted cryptocurrency analyst Benjamin Cowen recently shared a cryptic chart that has sparked debate among his followers. The chart, which appears to be a reverse representation of the Ethereum (ETH) to Bitcoin (BTC) pair, has left followers pondering its significance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the Twitter post, Cowen, well-known for his incisive crypto analyses, did not explicitly mention the chart's name. However, he posed a simple question to his followers: \"Is this bullish or bearish?\" The enigmatic chart and the question have since provoked considerable speculation within the community.\n\nThe crux of the debate revolves around the interpretation of the ETH/BTC chart. A bullish ETH/BTC chart implies that Ethereum's value is set to appreciate against Bitcoin. In contrast, a bearish chart suggests that Bitcoin will outperform Ethereum. In the broader perspective, a bullish ETH/BTC chart could also be indicative of an impending surge of volatility on the crypto market.\n\nOver the past weeks, the ETH/BTC chart has shown a downward trend, which could indicate that Bitcoin has been outperforming Ethereum in the crypto race. However, this trend seems to be flattening out, which could potentially suggest a changing dynamic between the two leading cryptocurrencies.\n\nWhile the intention behind Cowen's post remains a mystery, it has undeniably succeeded in generating discussion and speculation among crypto enthusiasts. The ETH/BTC pair has long been viewed as an important metric in the crypto space, providing insight into the relative performance of the two largest cryptocurrencies.\n\nIn case of a breakthrough on ETH/BTC, we might see a surge of volatility on the cryptocurrency market, especially in the DeFi and NFT sectors. For now, however, the performance of the crypto market remains suppressed."

        "title": "Bitcoin BRC-20 Tokens Are Now Moving Over to Ethereum - Decrypt",
        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nSix months after launching a protocol that lets people mint NFT-like media assets on the Bitcoin blockchain, the Ordinals space is rapidly evolving. Not only are new products springing up one after another, but the Ordinals-based BRC-20 tokens are now expanding onto none other than Ethereum, the dominant NFT and token ecosystem.\n\nTwo of the largest BRC-20 tokens on the market, ORDI and OXBT, have partnered with Emblem\u2014a tool that lets users store tokens across blockchains without need for a bridge\u2014to release BRC-20 Curated Collections.\n\n\u201cThis should be considered a day in which BRC-20s began exploring what their asset class is,\u201d said Jake Gallen, who is in charge of NFT strategy and product at Emblem.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u2b1b\ufe0f\ud83d\udfe7 $ORDI and $OXBT MEGATHREAD \ud83d\udfe7\u2b1b\ufe0f \ud83d\ude80 VAULTING IS NOW LIVE \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\udd38 How to Mint\n\n\ud83d\udd38 Where to Trade\n\n\ud83d\udd38 Vaulting Mechanics\n\n\ud83d\udd38 Details, Info, Integrations, and Partnerships pic.twitter.com/AANoZjTVxs \u2014 Emblem Vault (@EmblemVault) July 6, 2023\n\nBRC-20 tokens use the Ordinals protocol to generate what are effectively fungible tokens built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. Broadly, they\u2019ve been used thus far to create a wide variety of meme tokens, with the total market cap of all BRC-20s briefly nearing $1 billion in May before falling sharply since.\n\nGallen told Decrypt that the BRC-20 Curated Collections are important \u201cbecause we can now test what type of asset BRC-20s are most closely related to.\u201d He\u2019s looking forward to \u201chow the community views them,\u201d and whether they want to trade them like fungible tokens \u201cor want some variety.\u201d\n\nHe teamed with Adam McBride, colleague and self-proclaimed NFT archaeologist, to share a video deep dive earlier this week about the collection launch. An official launch was pegged for next week, but the functionality is already live and the resulting NFTs are being traded on the OpenSea and Blur marketplaces.\n\nAccording to McBride, the innovation at play with the new partnership is to sidestep traditional cross-chain bridges. He explained that \u201cbefore, users would send their BRC-20s to a Bitcoin wallet, which then would mint new ERC-20s on Ethereum.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEmblem\u2019s solution, created in-house, is to create specialized vaults. Before Ordinals, Emblem vaults were used to transfer digital artwork minted on other Bitcoin-related protocols (like Counterparty) over to Ethereum, where they were newly minted as ERC-721 NFTs. The Rare Pepe collection is a prominent example.\n\nIn this case, with Ordinals-based BRC-20 tokens, users send their ORDI or OXBT to a vault which stores the private keys and holds the tokens. Then, using a single ERC-721 token, users will mint their Bitcoin-based NFT on Ethereum.\n\nIn essence, \u201cthe BRC-20 sits inside a Taproot wallet, which sits inside an NFT,\u201d said Gallen, explaining that \u201cthe NFT (which is an ERC-721 token) is the one doing all the traveling.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m super excited to see how the Ethereum marketplace will react to this,\u201d said McBride. \u201cThis will bring a level of ownership which is far more superior than what already exists, unlocking a bunch of use cases like farming, lending, and other stuff that is built out on Ethereum smart contracts.\u201d\n\nThe creator of BRC-20s and ORDI in particular, pseudonymous on-chain data enthusiast Domo, did not reply to a request for comment. According to Gallen, however, Domo \u201cis really excited to get to show his creation to Ethereum,\u201d adding that \u201cgetting those tokens to OpenSea and Blur is huge.\u201d\n\nGallen told Decrypt that the Emblem team has interacted more with ORDI builders than holders, whereas they are in direct contact with the OXBT community\u2014led by the pseudonymous BitGod\u2014since it is more ETH-native, \"so the interest in ETH-denominated trading is much higher.\"\n\nNonetheless, Gallen said that Emblem\u2019s team \u201cbelieves Bitcoin can equal or overtake Ethereum in NFT trading volume, but with its own culture and style.\u201d"

        "title": "Ethereum, Bitcoin Choose Different Tradeoffs But Both Are Valuable -- Vitalik Buterin - CCN.com",
        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nVitalik Buterin highlights the pros and cons between Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nEthereum co-founder highlights both BTC and ETH\u2019s \u201ccore commitments to values\u201d during Twitter Space.\n\nButerin also notes that Bitcoin and Ethereum don\u2019t execute privacy very well.\n\nVitalik Buterin highlighted fundamental differences between the core design of Bitcoin and its smart contract pioneering predecessor Ethereum having trade-offs during a widely-tuned-into Twitter Space on July 6 .\n\nButerin, who co-founded Ethereum alongside eight other influential cryptocurrency developers, spoke at length with Bitcoin advocates Eric Wall and Udi Wertheimer about the technical and cultural nuances of either protocol.\n\n\u201cI think they\u2019re definitely different experiments in terms of the culture and unavoidable trade offs that they\u2019re making and that\u2019s something that I\u2019ve only really come to realize over time.\u201d\n\nButerin believes there is great value in Bitcoin and Ethereum continuing to co-exist, while admitting he had separated the technical and cultural aspects as best he could\n\n\u201cWhen I was starting with Ethereum I was looking at them as a kind of technical\n\nsystems and cultural systems somewhat separately. I had my beliefs on culture, that maximalism is crazy.\u201d\n\nButerin said he had focused on taking a system from Bitcoin, which was fairly basic, and creating a more programmable system that mirrors \u201chow computers evolved\u201d.\n\nFundamental System Choices\n\nWith technological and cultural aspects intermingled in the development of both Bitcoin and Ethereum, Buterin highlighted the inevitable trade-offs of these systems.\n\n\u201cThere are points at which you have to make certain choices. Like if you make a system that supports more functionality, then any kind of functionality that you support ends up having risks, right?\n\nButerin said that extensive functionality requires protocol complexity, but functionality itself can introduce risks to a blockchain system.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s an example of something that we saw during the last few years.\u201d\n\nProof-of-Work vs Proof-of-Stake\n\nEthereum, which originally employed Bitcoin\u2019s proof-of-work consensus algorithm, shifted to proof-of-stake consensus in 2022 during the highly anticipated Merge.\n\nThe change in its core consensus protocol saw stakers introduced as the new \u2018miners\u2019 of the network. Staking 32 ETH is required to be a validator, which then receives rewards for processing transactions and maintaining the network.\n\nThe change also caused a split within the Ethereum community as Buterin highlighted, referring to the Ethereum DAO fork of 2016 which caused a fork in the chain, leaving ETH as we know it today and Ethereum Classic (ETC) as two separate chains.\n\n\u201cA lot of the people who were in favor of a more purist approach toward immutability ended up\n\ngoing to Ethereum Classic and people who are much stronger proof of work proponents.\u201d\n\nValuable Experiments\n\nButerin believes that many of the \u201csubtle choices\u201d made by both protocols in terms of functionality end up providing value and continue to co exist.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s just like a lot of these subtle choices that both platforms have made that like really go beyond the question of being general purpose or not trying to be general purpose?\u201d\n\nHighlighting a plethora of differences between Bitcoin and Ethereum which ended up in either protocols \u201cchoosing different trade offs\u201d down the line.\n\n\u201cThe result of all this is that we have these two different experiments that seem to me to be valuable. I\u2019m happy that they\u2019re both continuing to exist.\u201d\n\nButerin added that both protocols can also be considered \u201cmore honorable\u201d than \u201coverinflated\u201d scams that the cryptocurrency space has been littered with over the years.\n\n\u201cI do think that there is a kind of core commitment to values in there that I think is valuable for the space to actually provide something that matters to people.\u201d\n\nAnother central theme emphasized by Buterin was the need for blockchain to move beyond its current limitations by prioritizing scalability:\n\n\u201cWe need to find ways to scale up blockchain systems to handle a larger number of transactions without sacrificing security or decentralization.\u201d\n\nThis sentiment echoes the growing consensus within the industry, as developers and innovators strive to enhance the capabilities of blockchain networks."
