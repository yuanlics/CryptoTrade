        "content": "ETH\u2019s annualized inflation has dropped to 0.00002%.\n\nThe value of transaction settlements on the Ethereum network is significantly higher than that on the Bitcoin network.\n\nFor the first time since December 2022, Ethereum (ETH) issuance has returned to a deflationary state, data from ultra sound money revealed. The altcoin\u2019s supply growth at the time of writing stood at -34.67 ETH, as its annualized inflation rate dropped to 0.00002%.\n\nWhenever ETH turns deflationary, it means that the rate of new ETH being added to the total supply is decreasing. In other words, since the year started, the leading smart contract blockchain has burned more ETH tokens than it has minted.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nPer data from Etherscan, the count of daily ETH burned since 1 January has climbed by 32%.\n\nThe year so far has been kind to the leading alt\n\nFurther to turning into a deflationary coin, ETH\u2019s value has also risen by 31% since the commencement of the 2023 trading year. In the last week alone, the alt\u2019s value rose by over 20%, data from CoinMarketCap showed.\n\nThe sharp surge in ETH\u2019s value mirrors the growth in the general cryptocurrency market since the year started following a tumultuous close to the 2022 trading year. According to data from CoinGecko, global cryptocurrency market capitalization has risen by 21% in the past 16 days.\n\nIn addition, since the year began, the daily transaction settlements on Ethereum have surpassed $21 billion, significantly ahead of Bitcoin\u2019s $2.6 billion daily transaction settlements.\n\nEthereum settling over $21b a day in value while Bitcoin struggles to settle over $2.6b in value\u2026 You tell me where the future lies pic.twitter.com/Ez0kcinM1W \u2014 Crypto Maxi (@cryptoMaxi420) January 15, 2023\n\nFurthermore, CryptoQuant analyst CryptoOnchain found that there has been a resurgence of new ETH smart contracts being created. According to the CryptoOnchain, following a decline between August 2021 and October 2022, the number of new smart contracts on the Ethereum network has risen in the last four months.\n\nA high number of new smart contracts on Ethereum can be seen as a sign of strong developer activity and interest in the platform, indicating that the Ethereum ecosystem is healthy and growing.\n\nThis is a positive sign for the future of Ethereum as it suggests that more and more developers are building on the Ethereum blockchain and that the network is becoming more robust and useful.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nAhead of the Shanghai Upgrade\n\nWith the Shanghai Upgrade estimated to occur before the close of Q1 2023, a look at the Ethereum 2.0 contract revealed increased on-chain activity. According to Glassnode, the total number of Ether coins sitting in the Ethereum 2.0 deposit contract stood at 513,414 ETH. This has gone up by 1.3% since the year began.\n\nLikewise, the total number of validators on the proof-of-stake network stood at 501,666 at press time, having gone up by 1.2% in the last 16 days."

        "title": "Bitcoin vs Ethereum: Community split between capped supply and deflationary model - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH), the top two cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, have always been pitted against each other. With the start of the new year, the first debate has surfaced comparing BTC\u2019s capped supply of 21 million to ETH\u2019s deflationary supply, with disagreement over which of the two qualifies as sound money.\n\nAn Ethereum-focused Twitter user called \u2018ultra sound money\u2019 compared the supply issuance of both cryptocurrencies and suggested that \u201cif capped-supply BTC is sound then decreasing-supply ETH is ultrasound.\u201d\n\nif capped-supply BTC is sound\n\n\n\ndecreasing-supply ETH is ultra sound pic.twitter.com/L2tsFzPQ7q \u2014 ultra sound money (@ultrasoundmoney) January 15, 2023\n\nThe comparison between the two didn\u2019t sit well with BTC proponents, who quickly pointed out that soundness comes from the credibility of the monetary policy and not an ever-changing one. Dan Held, a famous Bitcoin proponent, pointed out the flaw in the argument and noted that a constantly changing one has less credibility. He said:\n\n\u201cTime builds trust with humans, it\u2019s not all about code. According to your logic, if we spun up another crypto with more deflation, that would be \u201csounder.\u201d\n\nAnother Bitcoin proponent questioned the credibility of Ethereum\u2019s monetary policy, reminding that the same monetary policy has \u201cchanged a least 11 times in its seven years of existence.\u201d On the other hand, Bitcoin has not changed its monetary policy once.\n\nEther's historical projected issuance rate. Source: ethhub.io\n\nEther became deflationary in August 2021 with the introduction of Ethereum improvement proposal-1559 (EIP-1559). The upgrade introduced a burn mechanism that automatically burns a portion of the transaction fee, decreasing the overall circulating supply of ETH.\n\nIn response to Alex Gladstein\u2019s argument that \u201cadmins\u201d can arbitrarily change Ethereum\u2019s monetary policy, independent Ethereum educator Anthony Sassano claimed that every change on the Ethereum network had been approved by the thousands of node operators run by community members.\n\nThe term \"admins\" implies that there is a small group with superuser powers that can change things on Ethereum which is completely false and has been proven false many times.\n\n\n\nYou can believe what you want about the sound money vs ultra sound money debate. \u2014 sassal.eth (@sassal0x) January 16, 2023\n\nLeo Glisic, the founder of the Maitri network, said that ETH had become sound money now, but BTC won\u2019t hit its cap until the year 2140.\n\nBitcoin has faced similar monetary changes and tweaking of the original code in the past. The most notable one came during 2017 when there was a growing demand for increasing the Bitcoin block size to accommodate more transactions per block and make it more scalable.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin steps out of 'fear' for the first time in nine months\n\nThe majority of the Bitcoin community remained against making any changes to the original code of Satoshi Nakamoto. As a result, the Bitcoin network experienced a hard fork in 2017, leading to the formation of Bitcoin Cash (BCH), a cryptocurrency with a block size of 8 MB against BTC\u2019s 1 MB. However, today, BCH has had very little on-chain development and is currently trading at a 97% price drop from its all-time high."
