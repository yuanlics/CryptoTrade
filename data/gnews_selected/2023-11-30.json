        "title": "SEC opens comment period for Fidelity's proposed Ethereum ETF - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) began to accept comments on Fidelity\u2019s proposed spot Ethereum ETF through a Nov. 30 filing.\n\nThat filing indicates that the securities agency is now soliciting comments on a proposed rule change from Cboe BZX. If approved, that rule change will allow the exchange to list and trade Fidelity\u2019s Ethereum Fund shares.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s request for comments resembles similar filings regarding other spot crypto ETF proposals. It asks for comments about surveillance, custodianship, and market manipulation, among other matters. Notably, the filing highlights a surveillance sharing agreement that Coinbase and Cboe BZX established in June, a critical component also found in many other pending spot crypto ETF proposals.\n\nThe filing also acknowledges a lack of existing U.S.-regulated and U.S. exchange-traded investments that provide exposure to ETH, whereas European markets already offer regulated investments that provide exposure to spot crypto assets.\n\nDecision likely by March 2024\n\nThe filing sets a timeline for the SEC to approve, disapprove, or start proceedings to determine whether to disapprove the proposed rule change. These comments are considered in the final decision-making process. The SEC is required to reach a decision within 45 days of the current notice\u2019s publication in the federal register; however, the SEC can extend the decision period by up to 90 days and then further by 60 days if necessary.\n\nThough exact deadlines may differ, Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart estimated that the SEC\u2019s next decision deadline for Fidelity will be Jan. 21, 2024, and its final decision will be March 8, 2024. He added that he will have knowledge of \u201cdefinitive deadlines in the coming weeks.\u201d\n\nFidelity initially filed for its spot Ethereum ETF on Nov. 17, days after its competitor BlackRock filed for an equivalent fund on Nov. 15. Both firms also filed for spot Bitcoin ETFs this summer starting in mid-June.\n\nSeveral other asset managers, including Ark Invest, VanEck, and Grayscale, also have pending spot crypto ETF proposals."

        "title": "Ethereum Price Rally In Jeopardy? Key Supports To Watch Out In Short-Term - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Ethereum price corrected lower below $2,050. ETH is now consolidating above the $2,020 support and might start a fresh increase in the near term.\n\nEthereum is still struggling to climb above the $2,075 and $2,080 resistance levels.\n\nThe price is trading below $2,050 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere was a break below a key bullish trend line with support at $2,040 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair could gain bullish momentum if it clears the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average and then $2,075.\n\nEthereum Price Trims Gains\n\nEthereum price struggled to clear the $2,075 resistance zone. The bears took control and pushed ETH below the $2,050 level. However, Bitcoin managed to stay above the $37,550 support zone.\n\nETH traded below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $1,986 swing low to the $2,076 high. Besides, there was a break below a key bullish trend line with support at $2,040 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.\n\nEthereum is now trading below $2,050 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. It is now consolidating above the $2,020 support zone. On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $2,00 zone and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThe first key resistance is near the $2,075 level. The next resistance sits at $2,090. A clear move above the $2,090 level could send the price toward the $2,130 resistance zone.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nThe next resistance is near $2,200, above which the price could aim for a move toward the $2,250 level. Any more gains could start a wave toward the $2,320 level.\n\nMore Losses in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $2,050 resistance, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,020 level. The next key support is $2,000.\n\nA downside break below $2,000 might start a steady decline. The key support is now at $1,930, below which there is a risk of a move toward the $1,880 level in the near term.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bearish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $2,020\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $2,075\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.
