        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) challenger Solana (SOL) rolled out a new carbon emissions tracker on Friday in a bid to be more environmentally conscious.\n\nThe Solana Foundation says it\u2019s the first smart contract blockchain project \u201cto have its emissions measured in real-time.\u201d\n\nIt developed the emissions tracker in partnership with Seattle-based carbon data platform Trycarbonara.\n\nThe Solana Foundation says it is also working on multiple new features that it hopes will make the network more energy efficient.\n\n\u201cInformation and Computing Technology (ICT) accounts for up to 3.9% of global carbon emissions \u2013 more than that of the airline industry. Accurate measurement with real-time carbon data is the first step toward cutting emissions. We hope the Solana Foundation\u2019s efforts will inspire other blockchain networks and projects to take similar steps towards measuring their emissions and building a more regenerative on-chain community.\u201d\n\nThe tracker embeds software directly on Solana nodes, which the Solana Foundation says will enable an up-to-date, comprehensive measurement of the project\u2019s ongoing carbon footprint.\n\nThe data portal also includes comparison charts that will show what Solana transactions are equivalent to, emissions-wise.\n\nSOL is trading at $21.33 at time of writing. The 11th-ranked crypto asset by market cap is down 2.5% in the past 24 hours.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "title": "Alt Season is Here: Why Dogetti, Ethereum, and Dogecoin Could be Key Players in 2023's Crypto Rollercoaster - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "As Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) dominance fades, many analysts of the crypto market are suggesting that we are entering an alt season, where altcoins take a larger share of the market, leading to a rally in prices. Three altcoins to watch this coming season are Dogetti (DETI), Ethereum (ETH), and Dogecoin (DOGE), which all look to make incredible gains.\n\nDogetti off to a Brilliant Start\n\nDogetti (DETI) is a newcomer to the market, which is currently in its presale stage, showing promising gains as more and more investors are purchasing tokens while it is still at a low price. DETI offers a unique blend of a cryptocurrency that pledges to donate to user-chosen charities whilst redistributing a percentage of each transaction amongst its token holders. Operating on the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain, DETI will be due to benefit from ETH\u2019s recent gains and after the presale ends on the 20th of June, DETI will be set onto a successful blockchain with exciting prospects. DETI uses a proof of stake mechanism, which will increase demand for the coin and protect it against any restrictions that may come into place against the proof of work mining system.\n\nEthereum Accelerating with the Shanghai Upgrade\n\nEthereum (ETH) has permanently moved to a proof of stake system from proof of work, with its recent much-hyped Shanghai upgrade. Following this upgrade, ETH saw a spike in price as interest caused the value to rise above the $2k threshold, and as Bitcoin (BTC) looks to enter a decline many suspect that ETH could take its place. ETH has long been BTC\u2019s biggest competitor but has yet to reach the dizzying heights that BTC has done in the past. This, however, could all change if we enter an alt season as we are predicted to do, and the reign of BTC could be brought to a dramatic end.\n\nDogecoin Turning Heads\n\nThe final altcoin that offers a tempting alternative to the mainstream crypto of Bitcoin (BTC) is Dogecoin (DOGE). DOGE has seen admirable gains over the past month, and looks to continue its rise, in what one trader, CrediBULL Crypto (@CredibleCrypto) has predicted could be \u201cthe mother of all alt seasons\u201d. DOGE currently operates on its own blockchain under a proof of work system, and while we have been seeing the rise of proof of stake, DOGE\u2019s similarity in this sense to BTC could be an advantage to the coin nearing the top of the market. DOGE may have begun as a joke, but it seems to have succeeded in its aims to threaten the concept of an ever-serious approach to crypto by its predecessors.\n\nAs 2023\u2019s altcoin season rapidly approaches, investors are gearing up to find the currencies on the market, or due to be released imminently, that have the potential for the biggest rewards. Dogetti (DETI), Ethereum (ETH), and Dogecoin (DOGE) are three such coins, and as they gain traction and receive more attention, they stand to become some of the biggest players this season.\n\nDogetti (DETI)\n\nPresale: https://dogetti.io/how-to-buy\n\nWebsite: https://dogetti.io/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/Dogetti\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/_Dogetti_\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Bitcoin and Ethereum won't make you a millionaire, but AI crypto certainly can - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "As the popularity of cryptocurrency continues to grow, many people are wondering if they should invest in Bitcoin or Ethereum. While these two cryptocurrencies have been around for some time and have seen significant growth, they may not be the best investment options for those looking to make a quick profit. However, a new type of cryptocurrency known as AI crypto is rapidly gaining attention as a potentially lucrative investment opportunity. In this article, I will explore the world of cryptocurrency, examine Bitcoin and Ethereum, and discuss the potential of AI crypto investment.\n\nIntroduction to Cryptocurrency\n\nCryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that uses cryptography for security. It operates independently of a central bank and can be used to buy goods and services or traded for other currencies. The first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, was created in 2009 by an unknown person or group under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. Since then, thousands of other cryptocurrencies have emerged, including Ethereum, Litecoin, and Ripple.\n\nUnderstanding Bitcoin and Ethereum\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum are two of the most well-known cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is the first and most popular cryptocurrency, with a market capitalization of over $1 trillion. It is a decentralized currency that operates on a peer-to-peer network and is created through a process called mining. Ethereum, on the other hand, is a decentralized platform that enables the creation of smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps) through its native cryptocurrency, Ether.\n\nWhile both Bitcoin and Ethereum have seen significant growth over the years, they may not be the best investment options for those looking to make a quick profit. The volatility of the cryptocurrency market means that prices can fluctuate wildly in a short amount of time, making it a risky investment for those without a high tolerance for risk.\n\nIs Bitcoin a Good Investment?\n\nBitcoin has been around for over a decade and has seen significant growth in its value. However, whether or not it is a good investment depends on a variety of factors. While some investors believe that Bitcoin is a safe investment due to its limited supply and increasing demand, others argue that it is too volatile and risky.\n\nOne of the main drawbacks of investing in Bitcoin is its volatility. The value of Bitcoin can fluctuate wildly in a short amount of time, making it difficult to predict its future value. Additionally, Bitcoin is not backed by any government or financial institution, which means that it is not subject to the same regulations and protections as traditional investments.\n\nHow to Mine Ethereum\n\nUnlike Bitcoin, Ethereum cannot be mined using traditional mining methods. Instead, it uses a process called proof-of-stake (PoS) to create new Ether tokens. PoS is a more energy-efficient and cost-effective method of creating new tokens compared to proof-of-work (PoW), which is used by Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nTo mine Ethereum, you need to join a mining pool or set up your own mining rig. A mining pool is a group of miners who combine their computing power to increase their chances of earning Ether. Setting up your own mining rig can be expensive and time-consuming, but it gives you more control over the mining process.\n\nWhat is AI Crypto?\n\nSome AI crypto uses algorithms to analyze market data and make predictions about future market trends. Avorak AI is one of these projects. They allow investors to make more informed decisions about when to buy and sell their investments. Additionally, AI crypto is designed to be more resistant to market manipulation and fraud, making it a potentially safer investment option.\n\nInvesting in AI Crypto\n\nAvorak provides heavy incentives for holding AVRK. The revenue model, which gives 49% of all revenue back to holders, creates a truly passive income. Unlike the \u2018passive income\u2019 tokens of the past couple of years that simply minted the token into the ground pretending to be yield, the revenue comes from the product itself, meaning there is no inflation to the token.\n\nConclusion: The Future of Cryptocurrency\n\nCryptocurrency is still a relatively new and rapidly evolving technology. While Bitcoin and Ethereum have seen significant growth over the years, they may not be the best investment options for those looking to make a quick profit. However, AI crypto is rapidly gaining attention as a potentially lucrative investment opportunity.\n\nInvesting in AI crypto could bring the kind of gains buying early into Bitcoin and Ethereum gave. Avorak bringing new technologies to blockchain makes it a prime target for investors, and they are raising capital fast. Getting in before the launch will guarantee lower prices and help investors on the ladder to be ready for the climb to the top.\n\nWant to learn more about Avorak AI?\n\n\n\nWebsite: https://avorak.ai\n\nBuy AVRK: https://invest.avorak.ai/register\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"
