        "title": "ETH Price: Ethereum Whale Dumps 15K ETH To Coinbase, Price To Nosedive At $2450? - CoinGape",
        "content": "In a recent development in the volatile cryptocurrency space, an Ethereum whale has made a substantial move, transferring about 15,000 ETH, valued at approximately $37 million, to the leading crypto exchange, Coinbase. The blockchain transactions tracking platform, Whale Alert, brought attention to this significant transfer, igniting curiosity among crypto enthusiasts and triggering a drop in Ethereum\u2019s market price.\n\nEthereum Whale Move Triggers Concern On Price\n\nWhale Alert reported the transfer of 14,699 ETH, equivalent to $37.58 million, from an unknown wallet to Coinbase, raising eyebrows in the crypto community. This sizable movement seems to have impacted the current performance of Ethereum, as witnessed by the recent price of ETH.\n\nadvertisement\n\nOn the other hand, prominent crypto analyst Ali Martinez has also shared his views on the Ethereum price on the X platform recently. According to Martinez, if the ETH price cannot maintain its position above the $2,530 mark, it may witness a further slip to the $2,450 level.\n\nMeanwhile, the crypto market is now on edge as Ethereum currently flirts around the $2,550 mark. Notably, analysts and investors are closely monitoring Ethereum\u2019s price movements following this significant whale transaction.\n\nAlso Read: Binance Dethroned As Indian Traders Flock To Local Firms Amid Regulatory Scrutiny\n\nA Closer Look Into Price & Other Developments\n\nThe price concern is compounded by the observations from CryptoQuant data, revealing that Ethereum\u2019s Coinbase premium index, measuring the gap between Ethereum\u2019s dollar-denominated price on Coinbase and its USDT-denominated price on Binance, fell to -0.51, marking its lowest level since December 31, 2023.\n\nMeanwhile, this heightened Coinbase premium index adds another layer of uncertainty to Ethereum\u2019s short-term future, raising questions about potential further price drops. As the market anticipates the next move, crypto enthusiasts brace for potential turbulence, with the $2,450 threshold becoming a critical level to watch.\n\nNotably, as of writing, the Ethereum price traded at $2,554.15, down 1.42% over the last 24 hours. However, its trading volume from yesterday rose 26% to $24.22 billion at the same time. The ETH price has touched a high of $2,710.42 and a low of $2,460.93 over the last 24 hours.\n\nAlso Read: GameStop to Shutdown Its NFT Marketplace Amid Regulatory Scrutiny"

        "title": "Ethereum Price Prediction: Key Levels to Focus If $ETH Enters New Correction - CoinGape",
        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction: The second largest cryptocurrency Ethereum(ETH) has been notably bullish this week likely attributed to the recent launch of the first spot Bitcoin ETF in the U.S market. Surprisingly, the ETH price surpassed the Bitcoin performance amid the ETF approval recording a 17.7% weekly growth. Amid this upswing, the coin buyers breached above the $2430 swing high, indicating the potential for a higher recovery.\n\nIs Ethereum Price Heading to $3000?\n\nThe ETH price will continue to walk an aggressive rally until the ascending support trendline is intact.\n\nThe rising prices may face supply pressure at $2700, followed by $3000\n\nThe intraday trading volume in Ether is $16.8 Billion, indicating a 14% loss.\n\nOver the past three months, the Ethereum price has exhibited a consistent upward trajectory, evidenced by an ascending trendline. Starting from a low of $1522, the price of the coin has experienced a remarkable surge of 77%, reaching a new high of $2717.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe periodic pullbacks within this rally suggest active buyer accumulation at lower price points, a crucial characteristic of a prolonged rally. Throughout December, the ETH price movement was predominantly lateral, as the market anticipated the approval of the spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nAs the US SEC approved BTC ETF trading on Wednesday, the ETH price jumped 10.21% to breach the overhead resistance of $2140 indicating the asset is poised for higher growth.\n\nMoreover, Larry Fink, the Chief Executive Officer of BlackRock, expressed support for the idea of introducing an Ethereum-based exchange-traded fund (ETF). This statement came shortly after the launch of the highly anticipated Bitcoin ETF. In a recent discussion on CNBC, Fink said, \u201cI see value in having an Ethereum ETF,\u201d. Later he also added, \u201cThese are just stepping stones towards tokenization and I really do believe this is where we\u2019re going to be going\u201d.\n\nFollowing the approval of the spot Bitcoin ETF, the prospects for a Spot Ethereum ETF have significantly increased, potentially setting the stage for substantial growth in Ethereum\u2019s value.\n\nKey Support To Watch in Market Correction\n\nBy the press time, Ethereum (ETH) is trading at $2,565, experiencing a slight retracement to retest the previously surpassed resistance level of $2,400. Should the price sustainably remain above this newly established support, there\u2019s potential for the ongoing recovery to extend towards targets of $2,700, followed by $3,000, and $3,281.\n\nConversely, in the event of a fresh correction in the ETH price, investors should pay close attention to the ascending trendline. This could present an opportunity for a strategic pullback, offering a potential entry point for those looking to capitalize on such market movements\n\nBollinger Band: An uptick in the upper boundary of the Bollinger Band indicator shows the buyers dominating the asset.\n\nAverage Directional Index: The daily ADX value of 19% indicates the last correction has managed to recover the exhausted bullish momentum.\n\nRelated Articles:"

        "title": "SEC unlikely to approve spot Ethereum ETFs 'any time soon': TD Cowen - The Block",
        "content": "The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is not expected to approve spot Ethereum ETH +1.34% exchange-traded funds in the near future, according to the investment bank TD Cowen. The initial deadline for approving such funds is in May.\n\n\"Our expectation is that the agency will not be approving ETPs for other crypto tokens any time soon as we believe the SEC will want to gain experience from Bitcoin BTC +2.44% ETPs before it approves an Ethereum or other crypto token ETP,\" wrote TD Cowen Washington Research Group, led by Jaret Seiberg, in a note earlier this week. \"The wait might not be as long as 26 months, but it likely would be after the election.\"\n\nThe SEC approved spot bitcoin ETFs earlier this week after over a decade of rejections, and 26 months after greenlighting bitcoin futures ETFs in October 2021. The 2024 U.S. presidential elections are scheduled to be held in November.\n\nAfter the spot bitcoin ETF approvals, traders are now betting that spot Ethereum ETFs could be next in line to receive the green light as the price of ether has surged over the past week. While some analysts are more optimistic that spot ETH ETFs will get approved, others, like those at JPMorgan, aren't betting big. \"In our opinion, for the SEC to approve spot Ethereum ETFs in May, it would need to classify Ethereum as a commodity (similar to bitcoin) rather than a security,\" JPMorgan's Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou told The Block this week. \"This is far from given, and I wouldn't put more than a 50% chance to the SEC classifying Ethereum as a commodity before May.\"\n\nSeveral big firms, including BlackRock and Fidelity, have recently filed for spot ETH ETFs.\n\n'Gensler is in no hurry to act'\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nWhile approving spot bitcoin ETFs, SEC Chair Gary Gensler said that a federal court gave the agency little choice but to approve those funds as the SEC had lost in a legal case brought against it by Grayscale Investments. \"While we approved the listing and trading of certain spot bitcoin ETP shares today, we did not approve or endorse bitcoin,\" Gensler said at the time, adding that he maintains his view that \"the vast majority of crypto assets are investment contracts and thus subject to the federal securities laws.\"\n\nTD Cowen said it views the spot bitcoin ETF approval as consistent with its thesis that Gensler is \"taking a go-slow approach modeled over how the agency established rules for the ABS [asset-backed securities] market.\" The approval also \"does not expedite the schedule for crypto market structure legislation,\" the bank said.\n\n\"This does not change our expectations for crypto market structure. We believe it will require Congress to enact legislation to establish the framework for how tokens will be regulated, what type of disclosures will be required and which agency will be in charge of investor protections,\" TD Cowen said. \"Our view remains that Gensler sees enforcement actions and litigation as aiding that process by narrowing the issues that Congress must resolve.\"\n\nGensler's term ends in June 2026, and he could maintain a Democratic majority at the SEC until then, according to TD Cowen. \"It is yet another reason we believe Gensler is in no hurry to act,\" the bank said, adding that he has time to bring more cases and await more court rulings rather than trying to rush legislative action.\n\n\"This also lets the U.S. learn from other jurisdictions before enacting a regulatory regime that will be tough to change once adopted,\" the bank concluded."

At one point, Solana was up more than 1,000% for the year.\n\nAll this has me thinking it's finally time to forget about XRP.

Let's take a closer look.\n\nSolana is on pace to topple Ethereum\n\nThe primary investment thesis for Solana is that it is the new Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH). Since 2020, crypto investors have been touting Solana as a potential \"Ethereum killer,\" and that scenario now seems to be finally playing out. While there are plenty of other Layer 1 blockchain challengers out there, Solana seems to be the one with the best chance of displacing Ethereum.\n\nSimply stated, Solana is a faster, cheaper, more efficient version of Ethereum. While Ethereum had to pull off a very complicated technical transformation (known as The Merge) to become an energy-efficient, proof-of-stake blockchain back in 2022, Solana launched right out of the box as a proof-of-stake blockchain. Whether it's transaction processing speed or overall transaction throughput, Solana seems to have the superior technology.\n\nGranted, the \"best technology\" does not always win. There are a lot of other factors to consider, including first-mover advantage and network effects. That's why Solana has taken nearly four years to finally catch up to Ethereum. But the investment narrative around Solana certainly seems to be shifting.

The goal of the crypto phone was to usher in a new mobile-first approach to crypto. Think about it -- today's smartphones are not crypto-native. They are designed for neither crypto users nor crypto wallets or for buying non-fungible tokens (NFTs) while waiting in line for a coffee from your favorite barista. So, Solana -- led by a talented team of former Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM) engineers -- decided to change all that.\n\nThis mobile crypto strategy also includes a mobile payments component. In February 2022, Solana launched Solana Pay, a blockchain-based payment protocol for merchants who want to accept crypto at the point of sale. Again, this builds on a very intuitive idea: Some people want to pay with crypto, and most merchants want to avoid high credit card processing fees. As a proof-of-concept, Solana announced an integration with Shopify (NYSE: SHOP) at the end of August.\n\nYes, of course, these mobile crypto initiatives could absolutely fail. But they are the types of big-time growth catalysts that XRP simply does not have right now. As long as the legal drama with the SEC stretches on (which could be until the end of 2024), it's highly unlikely that XRP will be able to do much of anything in the U.S. market.\n\nAt the same time, the company behind the XRP token (Ripple Labs) is hemorrhaging cash to pay lawyers.

Last summer, when XRP scored a major legal win in its ongoing SEC court case, the price of XRP doubled nearly overnight. So, there is upside potential. If you're currently holding XRP tokens, it could be worth waiting to see what develops.\n\nOver a long-term horizon, though, Solana appears to be a far superior investment. As soon as Solana flipped XRP at year-end, that should have been a wake-up call to XRP investors.
