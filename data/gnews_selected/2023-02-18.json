        "content": "After facing a bit of selling pressure on the Fed rhetoric, the crypto market is showing signs of recovery again. The Ethereum price (ETH) is up by 3% in the last 24 hours shooting past $1,700 levels for the first time in five months.\n\nInterestingly, the Ethereum price is currently at the highest level since the merge event in mid-September 2022. As per on-chain data provider Santiment both \u2013 shark and whales \u2013 have been holding their ETH supplies strongly. It notes: \u201cshark & whale addresses holding 100-100K $ETH still hold nearly 47% of the supply\u201d. The same cohort of investors has also accumulated nearly 2 million ETH since November 5th.\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum Price Volatility Ahead of Shanghai Upgrade?\n\nThe Ethereum Shanghai upgrade scheduled for the next month of March will introduce withdrawals for more than 16.5 million ether (ETH) staked in the blockchain. The Shanghai upgrade is likely to change the ETH supply and demand dynamics in the market and thus traders are expecting Ethereum price volatility going ahead.\n\nWith the Shanghai upgrade, $25 billion worth of ETH will be available for withdrawals as well as sale in the open market. Besides, the staking yields for ETH are also likely to decrease after the upgrade. Thus, there\u2019s a possibility that traders would unstake their coins and instead move the capital to other coins that offer better yields.\n\nIn his recent podcast interview, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin also shared further developments in the Ethereum roadmap. According to him, the main thing to focus on currently is sharding.\n\nWith sharding, Ethereum will build a system that supports more transactions than a single node can verify. Thus, it would improve the scalability of the Ethereum blockchain considerably.\n\nFurthermore, Ethereum\u2019s roll-ups centric roadmap seeks to focus on making the Ethereum blockchain friendly to people willing to build Layer 2 scaling solutions that could easily plug into Ethereum for security.\n\nIntern Notes on The Network State Podcast #1 ft @balajis & @VitalikButerin \u2013 How the $200B idea was born \ud83d\udca1\n\n\u2013 Rising issues of censorship & privacy\ud83d\udd75\ufe0f\ud83d\udea8\n\n\u2013 Vitalik's secrets to leveling up his game (you dont want to miss this) Here're 6 takeaways from the 117 mins podcast pic.twitter.com/FLTMoRbakl \u2014 Whospay Intern (@whospay_intern) February 16, 2023"
