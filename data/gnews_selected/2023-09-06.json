        "content": "A widely followed crypto strategist believes that one Ethereum (ETH) competitor with high institutional interest has massive upside potential.\n\nThe anonymous host of InvestAnswers tells his 447,000 YouTube subscribers that Solana (SOL) has key advantages over ETH that could send its price soaring.\n\n\u201cBut the real difference is how much better by what magnitude is Solana. And if you look here, red is Solana and the deltas, and then blue is ETH. You can see it smashes it. These things are on a log scale on the left. And that is the big difference. Looking at all of the key factors, they have 10 wins each, but in reality, where Solana wins, it wins by a lot more. Where Ethereum wins, it only wins by a fraction.\u201d\n\nHis chart shows 19 different categories comparing Solana to ETH. Solana beats ETH in such categories as block time, average fee and the maximum number of transactions that a blockchain can carry out in a second, also known as transactions per second (TPS).\n\nThe trader says that ETH is considered more established than Solana and a safer bet for investors.\n\nHowever, he notes that more institutional money has flowed into Solana so far in 2023.\n\n\u201cEthereum is safe. It\u2019s established. It has been around for a long time. The risk is very low. When big money comes in, they\u2019ll go into ETH first, although we have seen so far this year in 2023 institutional money is going into Solana more so than Ethereum.\u201d\n\nAccording to the trader, since Solana\u2019s market cap is much smaller than Ethereum\u2019s, SOL has a greater opportunity for a larger price increase than ETH.\n\nSolana is the 10th-ranked digital asset by market cap with a market cap of $8.2 billion. Ethereum is the second top digital asset by market cap with a market cap of $196 billion.\n\n\u201cThis is the magic question though. When you break it all down is Ethereum 20 times better than Solana? And the answer in my opinion is no. But there is risk with Solana, therefore you allocate accordingly. My Solana bag is about a third the size of my ETH bag but it will grow and I think it\u2019ll grow faster.\n\nBut that little skinny green sliver on the right is the market cap of Solana versus the market cap of ETH. And the ETH market cap is 20 times higher, which is stunning. And I look as an investor for relative value. Solana is a screaming buy at this price.\u201d\n\nSolana is trading for $20.28 at time of writing, up 4% in the last 24 hours.\n\nI\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "title": "Buterin Admits Node Centralization is Ethereum's Challenge as Fears Loom About Chinese Control - CCN.com",
        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nVitalik Buterin has outlined his vision for a more decentralized Ethereum network in which it is much easier to run validators.\n\nAt present, over half of all Ethereum nodes are run through hosting services operated by companies like Amazon.\n\nMeanwhile, critics have speculated that Chinese firms secretly control a huge stash of ETH.\n\nThe Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin has criticized the present state of Ethereum nodes. Pointing out that the majority of nodes are currently run through providers like Amazon Web Services, he identified node centralization as a major problem the Ethereum community needs to deal with.\n\nIn another potential threat to Ethereum\u2019s decentralization, critics have speculated that Chinese firms secretly control some of the richest ETH wallets in existence.\n\nThe Problem of Ethereum Node Centralization\n\nThe Ethereum network is made up of computers that communicate with each other in order to validate transactions and record data about the status of the blockchain.\n\nEach computer in the network is known as an Ethereum node. From its inception, the Ethereum community has worked to establish nodes all around the world. In order to ensure the network\u2019s decentralization, various computers belonging to individuals, businesses, universities and other organizations all operate nodes.\n\nHowever, not all computers are up to the task. In fact, to operate a full Ethereum node, Quicknode recommends a minimum of 16 GB of RAM, a fast SSD drive with at least 1 TB of space, at least 25 MBit/s bandwidth and a fast CPU with 4 or more cores.\n\nDue to the high technical bar node operators must meet, 57.5% of all nodes are run through cloud hosting services. As a consequence, although there are currently 5882 Ethereum nodes in operation, over half of these are controlled by just 21 cloud service providers.\n\nIn fact, 1805 nodes are operated via Amazon Web Services (AWS) alone, presenting a major challenge to Ethereum\u2019s decentralization.\n\nVitalik Buterin on the Future of Ethereum Nodes\n\nSpeaking at Korea Blockchain Week, Vitalik Buterin discusses how to create a more decentralized Ethereum network by making it easier to run nodes.\n\nAddressing the problem of node centralization in Seoul on Monday, September 4, Buterin observed that reducing the amount of data each node has to store would lower technical barriers for would-be operators.\n\n\u201cToday, it takes hundreds of gigabytes of data to run a node\u2026 In the longer term, there\u2019s a plan to maintain fully verified Ethereum nodes where you could literally run it on your phone,\u201d he said .\n\nPlans to change how Ethereum nodes handle data have already been formed. For example, the Ethereum Roadmap identifies planned upgrades that will allow computers operating Ethereum nodes to delete historical data they no longer need.\n\nIn the immediate future, the Ethereum Foundation is focused on data expiry as the most achievable goal for reducing the computational burden on network participants.\n\nLooking further ahead, however, a concept known as statelessness could make it much easier to run an Ethereum node.\n\nUnder a stateless system, not all nodes would have to access the network\u2019s full state data. But the most ambitious vision for the future of Ethereum nodes, a concept known as \u201cstrong statelessness,\u201d may not happen for a long time.\n\nAccording to Buterin, \u201cThese technical problems will have to be addressed eventually\u2014maybe a 10-year timescale, maybe a 20-year timescale.\u201d\n\nChinese Government Wallets May Hold a Huge Stash of ETH\n\nAs well as the concentration of nodes among a few operators, another threat to Ethereum\u2019s decentralization could come from the concentration of ETH among a small number of wallets.\n\nIn the proof of stake (PoS) era, ETH accumulation of that kind poses a major threat to Ethereum decentralization.\n\nUnder Ethereum\u2019s previous proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism, what\u2019s known as a 51% attack would require a single party to control over half of all miners, thus requiring a huge amount of resources to pull off. However, with the switch from miners to stakers, to seize control of the network, attackers would need to control more than half of the circulating supply of ETH instead.\n\nFor some researchers, this prospect is especially worrying given that many of the oldest and richest Ethereum wallets remain shrouded in secrecy. Moreover, concerns have been raised recently about the role of the Chinese business conglomerate Wanxiang in Ethereum\u2019s early history.\n\nAs the Twitter sleuth TruthLabs has observed, Wanxiang has been associated with Ethereum since its inception and likely received a portion of the 72 million ETH that was distributed to early investors.\n\nA quick \ud83e\uddf5showing that Wanxiang, Chinese auto and early Ethereum Investor funded and setup Vitalik Buterins official wallets. 1/6https://t.co/4uMLLnzguq pic.twitter.com/Ec1cjLOLz2 \u2014 TruthLabs \ud83e\udee1 (@BoringSleuth) January 29, 2023\n\nIn fact, the Chinese company has ties to Vitalik Buterin going back to 2015, when the then-CEO of Wanxiang Blockchain Labs, Feng Xia, purchased $500,000 worth of ETH from the Ethereum founder.\n\nFor TruthLabs, Wanxiang\u2019s deep roots in the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) are a good reason to be suspicious of its ETH holdings. In fact, the crypto investigator speculates that the CCP is Ethereum\u2019s biggest whale, secretly controlling as much as 66.6% Of the ETH supply.\n\nA complete guess, 66.6%. I found 12 Genesis Block Wallets today, alone where they ended up with the majority of the ETH from. Its so hard to know. They were invested in over 500 projects by EOY 2021, and in many cases got the pre-ICO tokens prior to both ETH/altcoin price waves. \u2014 TruthLabs \ud83e\udee1 (@BoringSleuth) June 28, 2023"
