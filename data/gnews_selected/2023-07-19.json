In June 2014, the Ethereum ecosystem held a sale event that gave early team members and co-founders the chance to take part and gather pre-mined Ether.\n\nThe tokens are now worth more than $116 million eight years later. Although the wallet owner's identity and the motivations behind the money transfer are unclear, they could be due to a variety of reasons, such as profiting from the rise in Ethereum's price.\n\nTo avoid any loss brought on by human error, the wallet's owner sent a test transaction worth 0.05 ETH to the Kraken address before starting the whole transaction. Despite the size of the transfer, the fee for the transaction was only $1.5, and the gas price was 25.475673161 gwei."

        "content": "A participant in Ethereum's initial coin offering (ICO) has resurfaced after remaining dormant for over eight years. They today moved 61,216 ether (ETH), worth over $116 million, to crypto exchange Kraken.\n\nThe participant had received the ETH only for 31 cents a coin at Ethereum's Genesis, worth around $18,980 at the time, on-chain analysis account Lookonchain noted. One ETH is currently trading at over $1,900.\n\nThe Ethereum ICO participant was inactive for more than 2900 days. Source: Lookonchain via Etherscan\n\nETH transfer\n\nRELATED INDICES See crypto indices\n\nThe reason behind the participant\u2019s transfer of ETH to Kraken remains unclear. Such movements to crypto exchanges often indicate an intention to sell an asset, stake it or acquire other assets. The ETH price remains unaffected by the transfer, with the asset continuing its upward trend.\n\nSeveral dormant crypto holders have moved funds in recent months. In April, an Ethereum ICO participant woke up after 7.7 years and transferred one ETH which some speculated indicated a test transaction. Also in April, a bitcoin (BTC) whale that had been inactive for a decade transferred 279 BTC \u2014 worth $7.8 million at the time of the transaction \u2014 to three new addresses. That transaction came a day after another long-dormant bitcoin whale transferred 2,071.5 BTC \u2014 worth $60.7 million at the time of the transaction \u2014 after nine years of inactivity."

        "content": "Crypto die-hards like to say \u201cwe\u2019re early\u201d amid the peaks and valleys of the market, but what really feels early much of the time is the tooling.\n\nCymbal, which bills itself as the first \u201chuman readable\u201d Ethereum block explorer, aims to move that forward, launching in beta today.\n\nBlockchain explorers like Etherscan are essential tools for builders and traders alike, but they\u2019re densely packed with data and very difficult for the average user to navigate, let alone understand. That's where Cymbal sees an opening.\n\nIt takes the same kind of public blockchain data that\u2019s flowing through standard explorers and turns it into a feed that\u2019s not only visual and easily understandable at a glance, but also social.\n\n\u201cToday, tools like Etherscan are the best in class for looking at the blockchain\u2014but they resemble command line interfaces. We want to get to the GUI,\u201d Cymbal CEO and co-founder Eric Feng told Decrypt, alluding to the past computing shift from text-based navigation to graphical user interfaces.\n\nCymbal looks more like a social network than a pure data resource, serving up dashboards that take transaction details and wrap them up with NFT artwork\u2014from the Bored Ape Yacht Club and other top collections\u2014along with data trends, public information on known wallet owners, relevant news stories from media outlets, and more.\n\nIt also runs that data through an AI tool to generate a conversational summary of transactions and trends, to make things even more understandable for the average user. Feng said that Cymbal is running the tool through OpenAI\u2019s GPT large language model.\n\nCymbal is launching with a focus on NFTs, but Feng said that richer data regarding cryptocurrency and token transactions will be added in time, as his team works to \u201cbuild out a full Etherscan replacement.\u201d Support for the Solana blockchain is coming in a matter of weeks, he added, with Ethereum scaling network Polygon not far behind.\n\nFeng said that Cymbal started with NFTs for a couple of reasons. The tokens are often tied to artwork, which makes them visual in nature\u2014ideal for this kind of platform. NFTs are also often the first way that people are onboarded into the crypto space these days, he added, and that accessibility layer also played a role in Cymbal\u2019s decision-making.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cWe consider NFTs to be the gateway to Web3,\u201d he told Decrypt.\n\nA screenshot of the Cymbal interface. Image: Cymbal\n\nCymbal looks like a social network, and it can be used like one too. Users can follow wallets and projects, plus wallet owners can claim their own page and then personalize it to become a \u201cWeb3 profile\u201d of sorts, Feng said. He suggested potential messaging, content publishing, and other social features to come in time.\n\nThe startup has raised a total of $18.5 million to date with notable investors in the mix, including Coinbase Ventures, Solana Ventures, CAA Connect, UTA Ventures, Shima Capital, and Google Ventures (GV). Notable angel investors include Kleiner Perkins\u2019 John Doerr, Dapper Labs co-founder Roham Gharegozlou, and outgoing Polygon Labs president Ryan Wyatt.\n\nFeng\u2014a former CTO at Hulu and veteran of Meta and Microsoft\u2014said that Cymbal sees revenue-generating opportunities with targeted advertising based on wallet data, along with selling its curated data to app builders via API access. He said it\u2019s akin to business models used by other block explorers, as well as crypto price trackers.\n\nOpepen PFPs Are Taking Over NFT Twitter\u2014Here's What's Going On\n\nCymbal is positioned as a way to not only help the average NFT and crypto user better understand the blockchain space, but also help expand the industry as more accessible tools come online.\n\n\u201cThere is a subset of hardcore crypto people that can read Etherscan, just like there's people in \u2018The Matrix\u2019 that could look at the green squiggly lines and understand what's going on,\u201d Feng told Decrypt. \u201cGreat. This is not for them.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt's for the masses,\u201d he added. \u201cIt's not the tens of thousands of hardcore crypto people right now. It's for the tens of millions of people that hopefully will come into the ecosystem if we can create better tooling for them.\u201d"

        "title": "Will Ethereum Be a Trillion-Dollar Cryptocurrency by 2025? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Currently trading at just under $2,000, Ethereum (ETH 0.42%) has a market capitalization of $227 billion, making it the world's second-largest cryptocurrency. Ethereum now accounts for about 20% of the entire value of the $1.2 trillion crypto market.\n\nSo what would it take for Ethereum to more than quadruple in value to become a trillion-dollar cryptocurrency? For one, it would require Ethereum to continue to find innovative use cases for its blockchain technology. Second, it would most likely require Ethereum to surpass Bitcoin (BTC 0.56%) as the world's most popular cryptocurrency. Let's take a closer look at both of these factors.\n\nPost-Merge roadmap\n\nThe good news is that Ethereum's co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, has plenty of upgrades, changes, and tweaks planned for the cryptocurrency. At the end of November 2022, he released an updated roadmap for Ethereum, and it's impressive. According to Buterin, Ethereum's transformation is still only 55% complete, even after last year's landmark upgrade known as The Merge. There are five big upgrade stages ahead, known as the Surge, Scourge, Verge, Purge, and Splurge.\n\nThe big question, of course, is what types of innovative use cases will emerge from each of these upgrades. In April, we saw the completion of one such upgrade, known as Shapella, which made crypto staking on the platform much more attractive to investors. The next big upgrade, now scheduled for the end of 2023, could lead to Ethereum being able to support 100,000 transactions per second in the near-term future. That type of raw processing speed would make Ethereum much more attractive to both users and developers.\n\nEthereum has a strong track record of innovation, and each new improvement to the blockchain typically leads to a completely unexpected new use case scenario. Thus, if there are five upgrades ahead, that's five new opportunities for new breakthrough innovations. Ethereum's post-Merge roadmap might be incredibly wonky, filled with terms like \"proto-danksharding,\" but I think it could be the key to unlocking this crypto's full valuation potential.\n\nCan Ethereum flip Bitcoin?\n\nIn crypto circles, one hypothetical scenario is known as \"the flippening.\" This is the moment when Ethereum finally surpasses Bitcoin as the world's most valuable cryptocurrency. Throughout its history, Ethereum has always played second fiddle to Bitcoin in terms of market capitalization. At some point, though, Ethereum could eventually \"flip\" Bitcoin.\n\nMost likely, Ethereum will need to surpass Bitcoin for it to become a trillion-dollar cryptocurrency. Until it happens, the math simply doesn't work. Investors can't assume that the entire crypto market is going to increase in value at the same rate as Ethereum. The math only works if Ethereum gains market share from other cryptos such as Bitcoin.\n\nThere are several factors in Ethereum's favor here. A big one is Ethereum's smart contract platform, which gives it much greater utility than Bitcoin. With Ethereum, the number of use cases includes non-fungible tokens (NFTs), decentralized finance (DeFi), gaming, the metaverse, and Web3. And just about every new technological innovation -- such as artificial intelligence -- is better suited to running on Ethereum than Bitcoin. Thus, in the near-term future, it is likely that Ethereum will grow faster than Bitcoin.\n\nMoreover, thanks to The Merge, Ethereum is now a modern proof-of-stake blockchain, while Bitcoin is still an old proof-of-work blockchain. That means Ethereum no longer requires crypto mining, and that makes the blockchain 99.9% more energy efficient. Given the debate on the environment and climate change, this is a big deal. For example, in September 2022, the White House released a detailed study on the harmful environmental effects of Bitcoin mining. As people become more aware of the environmental effects of different cryptos, it might lead to more investors moving their money out of Bitcoin and into Ethereum.\n\nThe path to $1 trillion\n\nWhile Ethereum definitely has a path to a $1 trillion market cap, the road will not be easy. Consider, for example, that only a handful of stocks currently have trillion-dollar market valuations. Getting to this valuation for Ethereum would represent a real milestone, and one that will likely require overcoming a number of regulatory obstacles along the way.\n\n\n\nNevertheless, I'm bullish on Ethereum's medium- to long-term prospects. Within the next few years, it is entirely within the realm of possibility that Ethereum will become a trillion-dollar cryptocurrency as long as it continues to execute on its roadmap for growth."
