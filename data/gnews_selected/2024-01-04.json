        "title": "Ethereum Price Recovers Ground But Upsides Might Be Limited Above $2,300 - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Ethereum price tumbled and spiked below $2,000 on Kraken. ETH is now recovering above the $2,200 level, but the bears might be active near $2,300.\n\nEthereum started a major decline and dived below the $2,200 support.\n\nThe price is trading below $2,300 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance near $2,300 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair could continue to rise if there is a clear move above $2,290 and $2,300.\n\nEthereum Price Nosedives\n\nEthereum price struggled to settle above the $2,400 resistance zone. ETH also started a major decline like Bitcoin and broke the $2,200 support zone.\n\nThere was a sharp decline and the price even spiked below the $2,000 support zone. A new yearly low was formed near $1,860 and the price is now recovering losses. There was a decent increase above the $2,000 and $2,080 resistance levels.\n\nThe price climbed above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2,430 swing high to the $1,860 low. However, Ethereum is still below $2,300 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nOn the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $2,290 level. The first major resistance is now near $2,300. There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance near $2,300 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The trend line is close to the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2,430 swing high to the $1,860 low.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nA close above the $2,300 resistance could send the price toward $2,400. The next key resistance is near $2,440. If there is a clear move above $2,400, there could be a drift toward $2,500. The next resistance sits at $2,500, above which Ethereum might rally and test the $2,620 zone.\n\nFresh Decline in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $2,300 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,200 level.\n\nThe first key support could be the $2,080 zone. A downside break and a close below $2,080 might start another steady decline. In the stated case, Ether could test the $2,000 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $1,860 level.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is regaining momentum in the bullish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now above the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $2,180\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $2,300\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. GS is being considered to become the authorized participant (AP) for the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), which Grayscale and BlackRock Inc. BLK are planning to launch.\n\nApart from GS, JPMorgan Chase & Co. JPM is being considered as a potential AP for the ETF. This was first reported by Coindesk.\n\nBLK became the first asset manager to file for the spot Bitcoin ETF in June 2023, paving the way for a wave of filings by other asset managers like Fidelity, Invesco and WisdomTree, Inc. WT.\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is expected to announce its decision on the trading of spot bitcoin ETF\u2019s latest by Jan 10, 2024. To date, the approved cryptocurrency ETFs in the United States are those that include future contracts on Bitcoin and Ethereum. The pending approval from SEC will provide investors direct exposure to the price of cryptocurrency without having to purchase them.\n\nBlackRock also filed for a spot Ethereum ETF named iShares Ethereum Trust in November 2023. The Ethereum ETF, if approved, will be the first of its kind in the United States.\n\nWhile BLK is expanding its cryptocurrency exposure, JPM has been undertaking measures to subdue them. In September 2023, JPM stated that its retail bank, Chase, in the U.K. had decided to restrict customers\u2019 access to cryptocurrency-related transactions due to increased scams and fraud cases. Nonetheless, it has been exploring the concept of launching a blockchain-based deposit token for customers, provided it receives the required regulatory approval.\n\nJPMorgan and Goldman as APs for spot Bitcoin ETF would be entrusted with the responsibility of tracking the ETF share price with underlying assets of fund. The companies will be required to create and redeem the shares of ETF, thus supplying the required liquidity.\n\nBeside this, Goldman has been focusing on growth in its core strengths of investment banking and trading since it has been pulling back from its consumer lending business. Such growth moves by GS are necessary to support its top-line expansion.\n\nStory continues\n\nPer an internal memo circulated last year, GS had disclosed changes in its senior executives\u2019 positions as it intended to expand its operations in the private credit space. It further aims to double the size of business targeting assets worth $110 billion under management over the medium term.\n\nFurther, it has been aiming to expand its offerings across the high growth countries. In December 2023, Bloomberg reported that GS was planning to enhance its credit business in India as it is one of the fastest-growing economies in the world. Per Sonjoy Chatterjee, chairman and chief executive officer of Goldman in India, the bank intends to broaden the range of its loan offerings in this country.\n\nThe firm also desires to obtain a license to boost its currency trading that would permit it to deal with counterparties like financial investors, equity customers or a corporate customer.
