        "content": "The final testnet upgrade will occur to Goerli sometime in the coming weeks. That would be the final dress rehearsal before the main blockchain is able to process staked ETH withdrawals. Goerli\u2019s testing will also be the most anticipated given that it is the biggest testnet of the three and it mimics the main Ethereum blockchain\u2019s activity most closely."

        "title": "Ethereum Developers to Let Goerli Testnet \u2018Slowly Die\u2019 as Coin Price Soars - Decrypt",
        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nGETH, the native asset powering the Ethereum testnet Goerli, is soaring. And that\u2019s a problem.\n\nThe testnet token peaked at $1.60 on Saturday and is now trading, according to CoinGecko, at about $0.31\u2014and the fact that a testnet currency is even listed on price-tracking sites is indicative that something has gone wrong.\n\nMore importantly, though, developers are now turning away from testing their apps on it due to the new costs.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEthereum developer \u200b\u200bMarius van der Wijden told Decrypt that the problem isn't new, saying that after almost a year of discussions on how to fix the GETH supply, the easiest solution is to let Goerli \"slowly die.\"\n\n\"That's the intention with all testnets, they should live for a few years,\" van der Wijden said. \"Afterwards it becomes increasingly hard to sync them, so it's not of much use.\"\n\nAccording to him, the plan is to slowly phase out Goerli while moving users to the Sepolia testnet\u2014which is already running but as a permissioned chain and not yet open for anyone to run a validator node.\n\nLaunched in 2019, Goerli is one of several Ethereum testnets that lets developers safely test their code before deploying them on the Ethereum mainnet. To make the testnet environment as real as possible, it also needed a native gas token. That gas token was freely trickled out via so-called faucets and from validators keeping the testnet alive.\n\nTo speed up distribution to developers, crypto project LayerZero enabled trading between mainnet and Goerli to help developers. This move had the side effect of turning GETH into the subject of rampant speculation.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAs for alternatives, other Ethereum developers, such as Tim Beiko, are proposing a new testnet called Holli, which aims to make it easier for developers to acquire testnet ETH and reduce the need for a secondary market."

        "content": "Disclaimer: The opinions expressed by our writers are their own and do not represent the views of U.Today. The financial and market information provided on U.Today is intended for informational purposes only. U.Today is not liable for any financial losses incurred while trading cryptocurrencies. Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nThe former head of crypto analysts at ARK Invest, Chris Burniske, shared his outlook on Ethereum's (ETH) price action against Bitcoin (BTC). According to the expert, after two years of consolidation, the market's main altcoin is ready to make a breakout against the market's main cryptocurrency.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter almost 2 years of consolidation, $ETHBTC is primed for a monthly breakout. pic.twitter.com/btUzBP9Ew5 \u2014 Chris Burniske (@cburniske) February 27, 2023\n\nThe last time Ethereum had such a price spike was in May 2021. Then, in just over a month, ETH gained more than 150% against BTC, after having been in consolidation for 931 days beforehand.\n\nIf the outbreak Burniske is talking about really does happen, it can be assumed that it will be smaller than last time, considering that the current consolidation lasts a third of the days of the previous one and, therefore, the amount of accumulated \"energy\" is also lower.\n\nEthereum v. Bitcoin\n\nEqually interesting is whether Ethereum will renew its all-time high against Bitcoin in the event of a potential influx of liquidity into it. Currently, that mark is set at 0.1564 BTC per ETH, which is 123% higher than the current altcoin's price.\n\nFinally, a potential price break will answer the question of how close the \"flippening\" is. There has been talk of Ethereum displacing Bitcoin from the throne of the largest cryptocurrency since the very emergence of the market, but at the moment ETH is still only 43% of BTC in terms of capitalization."
