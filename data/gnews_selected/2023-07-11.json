        "title": "Ethereum Price Reaches Key Turning Point, $1,900 Is The Key - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Ethereum price is attempting a fresh increase from $1,825 against the US Dollar. ETH could rally if there is a clear move above the $1,900 resistance.\n\nEthereum is currently attempting a recovery wave above the $1,855 zone.\n\nThe price is trading above $1,865 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere is a major bearish trend line forming with resistance near $1,900 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair could start a decent increase if there is a close above $1,900.\n\nEthereum Price Revisits Resistance\n\nEthereum\u2019s price remained stable above the $1,825 support zone. ETH started a slow recovery wave and was able to climb a few points higher above $1,850, similar to Bitcoin.\n\nThe bulls were able to push the price above the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. The price broke the 50% Fib retracement level of the key decline from the $1,955 swing high to the $1,825 low. However, the bears were seen active near the $1,900 resistance zone.\n\nThere is also a major bearish trend line forming with resistance near $1,900 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. Ether is now trading above $1,865 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nImmediate resistance is near the $1,890 level. The first major resistance is near the $1,900 zone and the trend line. The trend line is close to the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the key decline from the $1,955 swing high to the $1,825 low.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nA close above the $1,900 resistance could start a decent increase toward $1,975. The next major resistance is near the $2,000 level. Any more gains could send Ether toward the $2,050 resistance or even $2,120.\n\nAnother Rejection in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $1,900 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,865 level or the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThe first major support is near the $1,825 level, below which there is a risk of a larger decline. The next major support is near the $1,740 level. Any more losses could send Ether toward the $1,720 support level in the near term.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bullish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now above the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $1,825\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $1,900\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "Ethereum welcomes another zk rollup to mainnet - Blockworks",
        "content": "Blockchain software development firm Consensys has gone down as the latest to join the zero-knowledge rollup game, unveiling Linea on Ethereum\u2019s mainnet.\n\nThis move comes after Linea\u2019s testnet phase on Goerli, which saw over 5.5 million wallet addresses execute over 46 million transactions.\n\nLinea is a type 2 zero-knowledge Ethereum virtual machine, or a zk-EVM \u2014 meaning it is an EVM equivalent, but not an Ethereum equivalent. The layer-2 network is designed to replicate user experience on mainnet, but at faster speeds and transaction costs by up to 15 times lower compared to Ethereum layer-1.\n\n\u201cBy leveraging its industry-leading prover, Vortex, the result of over four years of R&D, Linea can generate efficient ZK proofs and offer performances that unlock cheaper transactions for users and faster settlement finality with Ethereum,\u201d Declan Fox, senior product manager at Consensys, told Blockworks.\n\nBeing fully EVM compatible also means that there are no switching costs for Ethereum, Fox said.\n\nAt launch, Linea will be integrated with existing Web3 products such as MetaMask and Infura, meaning that, from the get-go, infrastructure ought to be familiar to developers.\n\nLinea\u2019s mainnet launch will also be introducing new features:\n\nBatch conflation \u2014 designed to reduce costs by optimizing layer-2 transactions, so that it can fit better into a batch submitted to Ethereum layer-1\n\nA new Canonical ERC-20 bridge \u2014 designed to enable any ERC-20 tokens to be created on Linea when bridged\n\nDynamic fee mechanism \u2014 used to manage Ethereum gas fees\n\nA new outer proof system will also be introduced.\n\n\u201cThe Linea prover, Vortex, offers fast proof generation by using lattice-based cryptography and self-recursion to compress a proof of computation, this \u2018inner proof\u2019 is then compressed in a final step, known as the \u2018outer proof\u2019 to reduce its size and the costs to verify on Ethereum,\u201d Fox said. \u201cLinea uses PLONK as its outer proof as it requires a universal trusted setup \u2014 essentially, each time the circuit is updated, a new setup ceremony does not need to be conducted to dispose of the randomness.\u201d\n\nTo prevent any implementation risks, Linea will be using a multi-prover approach, Fox said.\n\n\u201cThe Multi-Prover uses multiple diverse implementations of a zkEVM to prove a transaction thus ensuring if one prover has a bug or becomes unavailable, as long as a quorum is reached amongst the other available proofs, the system will continue to operate reliably,\u201d he said.\n\nWith the zero-knowledge rollup space drawing significant competition, Consensys notes it will unveil a major NFT collection on its network on July 18. All testers who participated in Linea Voyage will be eligible to mint the collection. Developers will also be able to participate in a hackathon with prizes of up to $50,000.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."
