        "content": "A further drop in ETH\u2019s price could send the DeFi market into another round of liquidation.\n\nThe DeFi TVL across all chains submerged.\n\nEthereum [ETH] and assets linked to the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) sector are experiencing a wave of uncertainty in the market. Although ETH\u2019s dominance in the smart contract space has been unwavering, liquidation in the crypto market arm reached $11 million.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ETHs worth today?\n\nAccording to Parsec Finance\u2019s data, this liquidation was the highest recorded since 12 May. However, market participants might need to exercise more caution as DefiLlama data shed light on potential threats.\n\nDeFi: Wary of the possibilities\n\nAt the time of writing, the multi-chain DeFi aggregator showed that the total liquidatable assets amounted to $1.7 billion. This metric describes the overall worth of DeFi assets with open futures or contract positions which could suffer losses depending on the market direction.\n\nBased on DefiLlamas\u2019 data, most of the liquidation in the last 24 hours occurred via the MakerDAO [MKR] protocol. However, there were several open staked Ether [stETH] and Wrapped Bitcoin [WBTC] positions at risk of suffering the same fate.\n\nSo, this could prompt market participants to carefully evaluate the risks involved with their sentiment.\n\nOver the last 24 hours, it has not been rosy for the broader crypto market. For instance, ETH\u2019s value decreased by 5.93%. DeFi tokens like Arbitrum [ARB] and Lido Finance [LDO] lost 12.49% and 18.16% respectively.\n\nWith the falling prices, DefiLlama revealed that another 20% aggregate decrease in value could take another $161 million out of the market.\n\nAlthough 20% might seem like a lot, the press time market state does not take away the possibility. This is because more than half of the cryptocurrencies in the top 50 by market capitalization have experienced double-digit decreases in the last 24 hours.\n\nTVL in the drain\n\nInterestingly, the Total Value Locked (TVL) has not been exempt from the widespread gloomy picture of the market. Out of almost 200 chains in the sector, only one\u2014zkSync Era\u2014recorded growth in the last 24 hours.\n\nAs an indicator of whether a DeFi asset is undervalued or overvalued, the TVL measures the worth of tokens temporarily deposited into a protocol.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s MKR\u2019s market cap in LDO\u2019s terms\n\nEthereum, which has the highest TVL of $25.28 billion, lost 4.36% of smart contract deposits within the said period. Thus, the decrease implies that liquidity has been hoarded and flown out of the ecosystem by investors. So, Ethereum might not be performing at its highest capacity.\n\nUnder the Ethereum blockchain, Lido Finance continues to lead the pact with a TVL of $12.65 billion. Other projects, including MakerDAO, Curve Finance [CRV], and Aave [AAVE], trailed behind."
