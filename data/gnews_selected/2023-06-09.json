        "content": "As one of the largest blockchain ecosystems continues to grow, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin notes that it will be necessary to adopt the \u201cthree transitions\u201d for Ethereum to be sustainable in the long term.\n\nThese transitions, as Buterin explains in his latest blog post are: layer-2 scaling, wallet security and privacy.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just features of the protocol that need to improve; in some cases, the way that we interact with Ethereum needs to change pretty fundamentally, requiring deep changes from applications and wallets,\u201d Buterin wrote.\n\nButerin explains that it will be necessary to build cross-chain solutions of layer-2 blockchains, drawing on examples of how it is difficult now for users to have only one address with the multiple different scaling solutions that exist on top of Ethereum today.\n\n\u201cIn an L2 scaling world, users are going to exist on lots of L2s. Are you a member of ExampleDAO, which lives on Optimism? Then you have an account on Optimism! Are you holding a CDP in a stablecoin system on ZkSync? Then you have an account on ZkSync\u2026 The days of a user having only one address will be gone,\u201d he said.\n\nThis must be achieved at the same time as the further development of smart contract wallets and privacy.\n\nBlockchain solutions are beginning to look more alike\n\nThese three transitions are not completely new to the blockchain ecosystem at large, and definitely not unique to Etheruem.\n\nCross-chain solutions that can help different networks communicate with one another, for example, has been explored in depth by the Cosmos ecosystem \u2014 a network of individual layer-1 app chains.\n\nIn an interview with Blockworks, Dougie DeLuca, an investor at Figment Capital, noted that rollup ecosystems are beginning to resemble Cosmos in a lot of ways.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s conversations right now about how blockchain design is just going to be commoditized, and they\u2019re going to look kind of similar. This is honestly the earliest sign of this that I\u2019ve seen, where the Cosmos has proliferated the idea of app chains. And rollups right now are moving more and more towards app specific rollups, which is similar to an app chain,\u201d DeLuca said.\n\nCosmos layer-1 blockchains, for example, communicate with each other through an inter-blockchain communication protocol (IBC). A more Ethereum-native solution to resolving the interoperability between layer-2s would be Connext, a team building out chain abstraction.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nSimilarly, with smart contract wallets, Etheruem is designing account abstraction solutions that will enable users to have self custody over their own wallets. In Cosmos, this is currently being explored by Authz.\n\nAlthough fundamentally different, the end goal is similar.\n\n\u201cI think it would be great for the Cosmos and rollup teams to work closely together\u2026Ethereum has been focusing on one set of problems for a long time, and Cosmos another set. If we combine our knowledge, I think we actually have a pretty great solution that we can work towards,\u201d DeLuca said.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "If Ethereum is to expand how it's used, it will need to undergo three major transitions or risk undermining its own future, said Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin.\n\nIn a blog post published on Friday, Buterin laid out his ideas for what it will take to help Ethereum mature if it is to expand in use. Calling them \u201cThe Three Transitions,\u201d Buterin said they would need to evolve around transitions in layer-2, or \u201cL2,\u201d scaling solutions, a move to smart contract wallets, and greater privacy for fund transfers.\n\nButerin\u2019s proposals bump into what has been called the \"blockchain trilemma.\" A blockchain's most important traits are being decentralized, secure, and scalable, but it can only usually achieve two of these three.\n\nTo overcome this, Buterin said that it is acknowledged that these transitions would be challenging to coordinate, but said they were needed for Ethereum to survive.\n\nOf the three, Buterin singled out a need to expand use of L2 solutions called \u201crollups\u201d as an important part of this transition. An ordinary L2 function processes transactions off of the main Ethereum blockchain, or the L1.\n\nA rollup is a scaling solution that bundles these transactions and then validates a proof of them as a much smaller piece of data on the mainnet to keep it from getting too clogged. As a result, the cost of an Ethereum transaction can be lower.\n\n\"Layer 2s are critical to the success of Ethereum\u2019s vision of the world computer. Without L2s, Ethereum won\u2019t scale,\" CEO of OP Labs and co-founder of Ethereum scaler Optimism Karl Floersch told Decrypt. \"Without scale, Ethereum will never be able to support the world\u2019s compute demand, and until the world\u2019s compute is fully supported, we can\u2019t fully realize Ethereum\u2019s vision.\"\n\nCritically, said Buterin, the version of Ethereum that does not address the move to rollups \"fails,\" adding that transaction costs would only surge in the face of a bull run and encourage more centralization on its blockchain.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"The solution isn't simply 'move users off of mainnet.' Rather, the solution lies in extending the capabilities of the Ethereum network,\" Floersch said. \"This means that instead of thinking about it as a migration from mainnet, we can think about it as load balancing the demand for Ethereum mainnet with other highly secure OP chains.\"\n\nBringing Ethereum from the edge\n\nEli Ben-Sasson, co-founder of the Israeli-based company StarkWare behind layer-2 scaling solutions StarkEx and StarkNet, said Buterin was \u201cright\u201d in his diagnosis of what it would take to see an expanded Ethereum.\n\nHe said his company was already using the smart contract wallets as part of its StarkNet, and believes more of this type of scaling is \u201cover the horizon.\u201d\n\n\u201cHaving the leadership from Vitalik which both appreciates the excitement of this moment and urges the community to get on board is a big part of what will propel Ethereum\u2019s success,\u201d Ben-Sasson told Decrypt.\n\nButerin said the move to smart contract wallets has some \"technical issues\" to work through but is \"not a large burden\" to address.\n\nWith a smart contract, contracts automatically execute their terms when predefined conditions are met, and Buterin said they would make some processes easier like covering transactions for non-ETH tokens.\n\nBinance to Delist Monero, Zcash in 4 European Countries\n\nOf the three transitions, Buterin expressed concern that meeting privacy concerns would be among the bigger challenges. He said that without enough data privacy measures in place, users concerned about this will stay away from Ethereum.\n\n\u201cWithout [privacy], Ethereum fails because having all transactions available publicly for literally anyone to see is far too high a privacy sacrifice for many users,\" said Buterin.\n\nTo address this, Buterin suggested using \"stealth address\" to help protect user identities, but these methods are still maturing because of issues around cost and functionality."
