        "content": "Cosmos-based Canto and Leading Polkadot Chain Astar Moves to Ethereum as Layer-2s\n\nCanto And Astar Are Moving To Ethereum as Layer-2s\n\nCanto, a Cosmos-based blockchain, and Astar, a leading Polkadot chain, have both announced that they will be moving to Ethereum as Layer-2 solutions. The move is aimed at improving scalability and interoperability between different blockchain networks.\n\nCanto is a layer-1 permissionless general-purpose blockchain on Cosmos with the goal of bringing the traditional financial sector on board with decentralized finance applications via open public infrastructure. Canto Commons has agreed to construct an Ethereum ZK rollup utilizing the Polygon Chain Development Kit (CDK).\n\nCanto will gain access to the liquidity of Polygon's ecosystem through the use of a shared ZK bridge. Canto's validators and staking system will be unaffected by the migration.\n\nSeveral protocols have recently revealed plans of building ZK layer 2 solutions using Polygon's CDK. Notably, leading Polkadot chain Astar revealed that it will begin developing its own Ethereum layer-2 scaling solution, Astar ZK-Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), which will also use Polygon's CDK.\n\nCanto and Astar are both intended to facilitate cross-chain communication and interoperability among different blockchain networks. They will be able to harness the security and scalability of the Ethereum network while retaining their own unique features and functions by switching to Ethereum as Layer-2 solutions.\n\nLet us know what you loved about this article, what could be improved, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form."

        "title": "One Year After The Merge: ETH Supply Shrinks But Challenges Remain - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "The Merge was tipped to be the most significant upgrade in Ethereum\u2019s history, promising to make ETH a deflationary asset while significantly reducing the carbon footprint of the network.\n\nWhile Ether has traded sideways over the past 12 months, much has changed for the network\u2019s fundamentals. New Ether issuance is down more than 80%, staking participation is up 87%, and nearly 1M ETH has been permanently removed from supply.\n\nOne Year After The Merge: ETH Supply Shrinks But Challenges Remain\n\nBut while Ethereum is largely making good on its deflationary promise, new challenges to the network\u2019s decentralization have emerged.\n\nDeflationary Ethereum\n\nThe Merge took place on Sept. 15, 2022, transitioning the network from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake consensus.\n\nThe shift overhauled Ethereum\u2019s fundamental tokenomics, with new daily Ether issuance falling more than 80% from 13,500 ETH to currently around 2,300 ETH. Coupled with the introduction of Ethereum\u2019s burn mechanism one year prior, analysts predicted Ethereum would become deflationary, meaning that more ETH is burned from base transaction fees than enters circulation as rewards for stakers.\n\nThere are now nearly 300,000 fewer ETH in existence than at the time of The Merge. For comparison, an additional 3.8M ETH ($6.2B) would have been issued under Proof of Work.\n\nChallenges Posed By Liquid Staking\n\nThe Merge also gave rise to the 2023 boom in liquid staking tokens (LSTs) \u2014 assets representing an underlying position of staked Ether which can be easily traded on exchanges or used in DeFi applications.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Shanghai upgrade also activated staked ETH withdrawals in April, reducing the price spread between ETH and popular liquid staking tokens and bolstering the adoption of LSTs. Today, 10.8M ETH or 42.5% of all staked Ether is held by liquid staking protocols.\n\nETH locked in Lido, the top LST protocol, increased 82% from 4.6M to 8.6M since the year began, according to Dune Analytics. Coinbase\u2019s LST token, cbETH, also boasts 1.17M Ether locked after launching last September, followed by Rocket Pool\u2019s rETH with 450,000.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, with Lido now commanding one-third of staked Ether, many onlookers decry Lido as a centralizing threat to Ethereum, warning that a further increase in Lido dominance could facilitate governance attacks against the network if the protocol desired.\n\nIn May, Ethereum chief scientist, Vitalik Buterin, advocated that staking providers controlling more than 15% of staked ETH should actively raise user fees to deter adoption until their dominance falls.\n\n\u201cIf a stake pool controls > 15%, it should be accepted and even *expected* for the pool to keep increasing its fee rate until it goes back below 15%,\u201d Buterin tweeted.\n\n\n\nRead the original post on The Defiant"

        "content": "ETMarkets.com\n\nThe crypto tokens were trading mixed in Monday's trade ahead of a key US Federal Reserve policy meeting later this week. Bitcoin, Ethereum, BNB , Solana and Litecoin were trading with gains, while XRP Dogecoin , Toncoin and Shiba Inu were trading with cuts.Bitcoin (BTC) rose 0.55% to $26,678, whereas Ethereum (ETH) was above the 1,600 level. Meanwhile, the global cryptocurrency market cap was trading higher, around $1.06 trillion, rising 0.29% in the last 24 hours.\"The weekend witnessed Bitcoin trading above the $26,000 level, possibly driven by a noteworthy collaboration between Deutsche Bank, Germany's leading bank, and Taurus, a Swiss cryptocurrency startup specializing in secure asset management and tokenization services,\" Edul Patel- CEO & Co-founder of Mudrex, said.\"Investors are awaiting the Federal Open Market Committee meeting scheduled for September 20, which may influence market dynamics. Bitcoin's next challenge is to surpass the $27,400 resistance level to maintain its upward momentum,\" Edul said.The total volume in DeFi is currently $2.14 billion, 11.27% of the total crypto market 24-hour volume. The volume of all stablecoins is now $16.79 billion, which is 88.6% of the total crypto market 24-hour volume.Bitcoin's dominance is currently 49.04%, according to CoinMarketCap. Meanwhile, BTC volume stood at approximately $7.6 billion, rising 14.17% in the last 24 hours.\"After three consecutive weeks of Doji candlestick patterns on the weekly Bitcoin chart, this week's positive close suggests a shift in favour of the bulls. However, the ongoing recovery remains in its early stages, and the Federal Open Market Committee meeting on September 20 could introduce volatility,\" said CoinDCX Research Team.Bitcoin is poised to conclude the week with gains, signalling a potential resolution of the ongoing uncertainty between buyers and sellers in favour of the bulls.On September 14th, Bitcoin managed to climb above the 20-day exponential moving average, currently situated at $26,303, which suggests a diminishing selling pressure. Since then, the bulls have successfully defended against multiple attempts by bears to drive the price below the 20-day EMA. While this recovery is still in its early stages, the upcoming Federal Open Market Committee meeting on September 20th could introduce additional volatility.BTC last week, again tested the critical support of $25,000 (Horizontal Trendline & 50% Fibonacci Retracement Level) as it made a low of $24,901. However, it failed to give a daily closing below the support and after that, the asset witnessed some recovery as it rallied up to $26,888 by forming four consecutive green candles.BTC has strong resistance at $28,500 and $32,500 and to catch a rally it needs to break, close and sustain above $32,500 whereas a break below the support of $25,000 will lead to further downfall.(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.
