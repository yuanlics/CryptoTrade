        "content": "Altcoin Crypto Funds Like Ethereum and Solana See Outflows After Bitcoin ETFs Launch\n\nA new report from digital asset fund manager CoinShares reveals that investors are withdrawing funds from high-profile crypto funds following the launch of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) earlier this month. According to CoinShares, investors pulled $21 million out of crypto funds issuers last week.\n\nCoinShares suggests that investors seeking exposure to digital assets are shifting their money into the new Bitcoin ETFs. The report notes that \"incumbent, higher cost issuers suffered in the U.S., seeing $2.9 billion of outflows, while newly issued ETFs have now seen a total of $4.13 billion inflows since launch.\"\n\nIn contrast, short Bitcoin products, which bet on the price of crypto going down, received inflows of around $13 million, as investors bet on further price weakness from Bitcoin. Other altcoin funds providing exposure to Ethereum and Solana also experienced outflows, reaching $14 million and $8.5 million respectively.\n\nThe approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on January 10 marked a significant milestone for the cryptocurrency industry. Of the 10 ETFs currently trading, BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust is the best performer, with $1.3 billion in assets under management.\n\nHowever, Grayscale, which manages billions of dollars worth of crypto assets, has experienced significant outflows. The Grayscale's Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) recently converted to a Bitcoin ETF, and investors have been cashing out rapidly. CoinShares reports that over $2.2 billion has been withdrawn from GBTC since its conversion.\n\nLet us know what you loved about this article, what could be improved, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form."

        "content": "Gaming Blockchain Ronin\u2019s Mobile Wallet Adds Ethereum, Polygon, BNB Chain Support\n\nSky Mavis, the creator of the popular play-to-earn NFT game Axie Infinity, has announced a significant upgrade to the Ronin blockchain's official crypto wallet. The latest update introduces several new features, including multichain support, an in-app web browser, a revamped visual design, and support for multi-party computation (MPC).\n\nThe Ronin wallet now supports the Ethereum mainnet, Polygon and BNB Chain. This integration allows users to easily manage and transfer assets across multiple blockchain networks from a single wallet. The new version of the Ronin wallet includes an in-app web browser that enables users to access decentralized applications (dApps) and interact with blockchain-based services directly from the wallet.\n\nThe wallet's visual design has been revamped to provide more detailed information on specific token activities and NFT information. Users can now easily view their asset balances, transaction history, and NFT collection in a more user-friendly interface.\n\nThe Ronin wallet now supports MPC, an optional security feature that allows users to divide their wallet's login information on the backend. This feature requires two or more pieces of login information instead of a single private key, enhancing the security of the wallet. When combined with a social login, the MPC feature can be used across multiple Ronin-based games like Axie Infinity and Pixels without creating separate wallets for each game.\n\nThe Ronin wallet upgrade is a significant step forward for the Ronin ecosystem, providing users with a more versatile and secure platform for managing their digital assets. The addition of multichain support and other features is likely to attract new users and further drive the adoption of the Ronin blockchain.\n\nLet us know what you loved about this article, what could be improved, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form."
