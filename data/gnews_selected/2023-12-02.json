Crypto trader Ali Martinez tells his 34,100 Twitter followers on the social media platform X to pay attention to the Tom DeMark (TD) Sequential indicator.\n\nThe TD Sequential indicator is used by traders to predict potential trend reversals based on the closing prices of the 13 previous bars or candles.\n\nSays Martinez,\n\n\u201cThe TD Sequential\u2019s track record speaks volumes! Its accuracy in predicting ETH\u2019s price movements on the four-hour chart is noteworthy.\n\nCurrently, it\u2019s flashing a sell signal at a key resistance level.

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nTraders and analysts are discussing the roots of the \"New Solana Summer\" as all core metrics of on-chain activity are rocketing. Some of them have already reached pre-FTX collapse levels. NFTs and meme coin segments might be contributing to this upsurge, data says.\n\nSolana (SOL) exceeds Polygon (MATIC), Optimism (OP) by transactional volume\n\nIn early December 2023, the aggregated on-chain trading volume on the Solana (SOL) blockchain surged above $240 million per day in equivalent. As such, the blockchain managed to surpass both Polygon (MATIC) and Optimism (OP), two mainstream Ethereum-based L2s by this indicator.\n\nImage by DefiLlama\n\nIn the first days of December, Polygon (MATIC) and Optimism (OP) demonstrate trading volumes of $137 million and $40 million per day, respectively. As such, Solana (SOL) processes more money on-chain than they do combined.\n\nAlso, in the last 24 hours, Solana (SOL) exceeded its another rival Avalanche (AVAX) by net value locked in dApps. Solana's dApp ecosystem is responsible for $688 million in TVL, Avalanche (AVAX) dApps logged $660 million. At that pace, Solana (SOL) might surpass the TVLs of Polygon (MATIC) and Optimism (OP) in the coming days.\n\nIn the last month, Solana's (SOL) TVL added over 60%, while the SOL price soared by 45%.\n\nHowever, it is still lagging behind Arbitrum (ARB), a dominant Ethereum (ETH) L2. Arbitrum (ARB) amassed almost $2.2 billion in TVL, while its daily trading volume exceeds $363 million in equivalent.\n\nSolScriptions and meme coins triggered Solana (SOL) comeback\n\nThe rally of Solana (SOL) and its network indicators can be attributed to a combination of powerful catalysts. For instance, the interest in Solana-based Ordinals \"SolScriptions\" and meme coins triggered the growth of SPL tokens minted on-chain.\n\nThen, Solana-based liquid staking protocols like Jito and Marinade Finance are actively attracting new customers and liquidity. Decentralized exchanges like Raydium and Orca are also gaining traction.\n\nAs covered by U.Today previously, CoinEx Research indicated the DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks) sector as yet another powerful catalyst for Solana (SOL) ecosystem's rebound."

Economic conditions and investor sentiment also play a crucial role. Ethereum vs. Bitcoin Market Cap: ETH\u2019s possibility of surpassing Bitcoin in market capitalization is uncertain, dependent on factors like adoption rates and network upgrades. Bitcoin currently leads with a significantly higher market cap.\n\n\u2018There is Potential for Ethereum\u2019\n\nEthereum\u2019s native cryptocurrency \u2013 Ether (ETH) \u2013 is yet another digital asset that has experienced a rapid price increase since the beginning of 2023. It currently trades at around $2,100 (per CoinGecko\u2019s data), with some wondering whether a new all-time high (ATH) could be achieved next year.\n\nAccording to ChatGPT, such a development could indeed occur should several vital factors be in place. The AI-powered language model noted market trends and technological advancements as the main ones.\n\nIt outlined Ethereum\u2019s shift from a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism to proof-of-stake (PoS), suggesting other improvements of this type could be bullish for the asset.\n\nChatGPT estimated that positive regulatory developments might encourage institutional investments and thus trigger a rally. On the other hand, stricter rules could have the opposite effect.\n\nGlobal economic conditions, investor sentiment, adoption by mainstream finance, and historical performance are other elements worth observing.\n\nLastly, ChatGPT suggested that the potential rise of different blockchain protocols and cryptocurrencies could impact Ethereum, too.\n\n\u201cGiven these factors, while there is potential for Ethereum to reach new highs, it\u2019s important to approach such predictions with caution and consider the inherent risks and uncertainties of cryptocurrency investments,\u201d the AI language model concluded.\n\nCould ETH Flip BTC: Flippening Possible?\n\nAnother interesting question that has been circulating in the cryptocurrency space for quite some time is whether Ethereum could eventually outpace Bitcoin and become the largest digital asset by market capitalization. On that note, several months ago, we asked ChatGPT if such a scenario is plausible in the next five years.\n\nThe language model explained that this outcome is \u201cuncertain and depends on various factors.\u201d The primary ones are adoption rates and network upgrades. Overall economic condition, inflation, and other financial aspects are also worth considering, ChatGPT assumed.\n\nAs of the moment, Bitcoin\u2019s market capitalization stands at over $750 billion, representing a dominance of around 50%. Ethereum is second with a market cap of approximately $250 billion, meaning it has a long way to go before flippening the leader."

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEthereum's price today is showcasing a bullish surge that is drawing attention across the crypto community. Ethereum is a bellwether for the altcoin market, and today's price action suggests that investors are increasingly confident in the asset's value proposition.\n\nThe technical chart for Ethereum indicates a strong push toward a key resistance level. After a period of consolidation, the price has broken out, suggesting a potential shift from a bearish to a bullish trend at around $2,100. This move aligns with a broader market recovery.\n\nAnalyzing the chart, Ethereum has been tracing an ascending trajectory, supported by a rising trendline that underscores a series of higher lows \u2013 a classic indicator of bullish sentiment. The 50-day moving average, which is often looked upon for trend confirmation, is positioned below the current price, serving as a dynamic support level. The price is pushing toward the $2,100 level, which has historically acted as a significant resistance zone.\n\nA breakthrough above this resistance could signal the start of a new uptrend, potentially challenging previous highs. However, traders will be watching closely for sustained volume to accompany this price increase, as higher trade volumes would lend credence to the breakout and suggest stronger conviction among buyers.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI), a momentum indicator, is currently hovering in the upper neutral zone, nearing overbought territory. While this could indicate that a pause or pullback is due, it also reflects the strong buying pressure that has driven the recent price increase.\n\nDogecoin not joking\n\nAt the time of writing, Dogecoin's price hovers around $0.38, which has established itself as a significant resistance point. This level has been tested multiple times over recent weeks, with each attempt bringing increased selling pressure. However, the persistence of DOGE bulls is noteworthy, as they continue to push the price back up to this threshold, indicating a potential accumulation phase preceding a breakout.\n\nThe technical indicators on the chart reinforce this narrative. The moving averages are aligned in a bullish formation, with the 50-day moving average serving as dynamic support below the current price. This could embolden the bulls, offering a psychological boost as they rally to break past the current resistance.\n\nFurthermore, the formation of a small symmetrical triangle suggests that volatility may be on the horizon for Dogecoin. This pattern, characterized by converging trend lines, points to a period of consolidation that typically precedes significant price movement. Given the positioning of the price at the upper end of the triangle, there is an argument to be made for an impending bullish breakout.\n\nExamining the volume, we see a consistency that accompanies the consolidation pattern, hinting that a breakout could be accompanied by a substantial increase in trade volume. This would provide the necessary market confirmation for a genuine breakthrough, rather than a false breakout that could trap overzealous bulls.\n\nADA's consolidation continues\n\nThe Cardano (ADA) market has entered a phase of consolidation, marked by a confluence of technical indicators that suggest brewing momentum. With the price oscillating around $0.38, the question on many investors' minds is whether this is the quiet before the storm of a significant breakout.\n\nA close examination of the daily chart reveals diverging moving averages, with the 50-day moving average trending upward, suggesting a bullish undercurrent, while the 200-day moving average is moving lower, indicating potential longer-term bearish sentiment. This divergence can often signal a period of market indecision, with shorter-term bullish sentiment wrestling against longer-term caution.\n\nThe immediate resistance level for ADA sits at around $0.40, a threshold that has capped upward price movements in recent times. For a confirmed breakout, ADA bulls need to push and sustain the price above this level, ideally with an increase in volume to signify strong market conviction."
