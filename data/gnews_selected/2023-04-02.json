        "content": "On-chain data reveals that crypto whales are snapping up the native asset of a hot Ethereum (ETH) layer-2 project by the millions.\n\nBlockchain-tracking firm Lookonchain says that digital asset manager Amber Group sent millions of dollars worth of Arbitrum (ARB) tokens to crypto exchanges OKX and Binance, where they could potentially be sold on the open market.\n\n\u201cTwo related addresses of Amber transferred 11.2 million ARB ($15.8 million), out of which, 7.3 million ARB ($10.3 million) was transferred to OKX and Binance and currently holding 4.47 million ARB ($6.3 million).\u201d\n\nWhile Amber Group reduced its ARB holdings, Lookonchain says several crypto whales have been in the process of accumulating ARB. According to the analytics firm, one whale collected a total of 4,048,947 ARB worth $5.7 million from OKX and Binance within the last 48 hours.\n\nA second whale received 4,099,517 ARB worth $5.78 million from OKX over the same timeframe. Meanwhile, a third crypto whale accumulated 1,003,798 ARB worth $1.41 million from crypto exchange Binance.\n\nAt time of writing, ARB is trading for $1.34, trading mostly sideways over the past week.\n\nLookonchain also recently spotted an Ethereum whale that staked nearly $100 million worth of ETH through a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform.\n\n\u201cA whale staked all 53,024 ETH ($95.5 million) through Abyss Finance\u2026\n\nThrough on-chain data tracking, we found that the ETH of the whale was bought from Poloniex, Gemini, Bittrex and other exchanges in 2017 and 2018, with an average buying cost of ~$368.\u201d\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "A closely followed crypto analyst believes Ethereum (ETH) could be gearing for a rally en route to liquidating traders who are bearish on the leading smart contract platform.\n\nIn a new blog post, Justin Bennett says that the S&P 500\u2019s (SPX) rally on Friday could hint at the short-term performance of the crypto markets.\n\nAccording to the analyst, crypto tends to follow in the footsteps of the stock market but there appears to be lag between the two asset classes. Bennett adds that should crypto take cues from equities, he sees Ethereum taking out resistance at $1,840.\n\nBennett says an Ethereum breakout could trigger a short squeeze as he notes that there\u2019s a \u201csignificant cluster\u201d of short liquidations up the the $2,000 price level for ETH.\n\nA short squeeze happens when large numbers of traders who shorted an asset decide to cut their losses in response to an unexpected price bump. The squeeze then triggers additional rallies.\n\nSays Bennett,\n\n\u201cThat could be telling, as cryptocurrencies like to target these areas, and $2,030 is the August 2022 high. Far more long liquidations are below current levels, but proximity matters, so the short liquidations up to $2,000 may influence ETH in the short term.\u201d\n\nHowever, Bennett says that the clock is ticking for crypto and Ethereum. According to the trader, the Ethereum short squeeze must happen in the coming days. Otherwise, he says that the rally may not materialize at all.\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019d like to see crypto play \u2018catch up\u2019 to equities sooner rather than later if this is to materialize.\n\nIf we don\u2019t see ETH flush these shorts in the next few days, it\u2019s less likely to occur.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, Ethereum is trading for $1,818.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "DeGods NFT migrated to Ethereum from Solana, with slow sales and declining activity.\n\nY00ts NFT collection saw a successful start on Polygon, while trade volume increased on both Ethereum and Solana.\n\nDeGods NFT has officially moved to the Ethereum [ETH] network, leaving Solana [SOL] behind. The migration was not without controversy, as it involved a couple of challenges from the Dust Labs.\n\nIn the last 24 hours since the migration, the impact on Ethereum NFT trading volume was closely monitored to assess how DeGods NFT has fared in its new home.\n\nDeGods makes a move to Ethereum\n\nDeGods has made good on its previous announcement by beginning its migration from Solana to Ethereum on 1 April, 2023. The project had pledged to cover gas fees for the first 24 hours of the migration to smooth the transition.\n\nYou can now migrate your DeGods to Ethereum.https://t.co/xn9gOwqn69 pic.twitter.com/keAVf8Hejd \u2014 DeGods III (@DeGodsNFT) April 1, 2023\n\nFor those who prefer to skip the queue and speed up their migration, the user will cover the gas fees. This approach aims to make the process as seamless as possible while giving users the option to prioritize their migration if they choose.\n\nLast year, Dust Labs made a surprising announcement regarding the migration of DeGods and y00ts from Solana to Ethereum and Polygon, respectively. According to project leader Frank DeGods, this move was motivated by a desire to explore new opportunities.\n\nThe decision to shift away from Solana\u2019s blockchain was likely influenced by the platform\u2019s challenges over the past year.\n\nHow DeGods fared so far\n\nAccording to CoinMarketCap, sales for DeGods on the Ethereum network have been relatively slow. As of this writing, the project has only achieved a trading volume of around 0.5%, with 17 sales representing roughly 6%.\n\nHowever, there is a silver lining, as the number of owners has already exceeded 700. While these figures may not be as impressive as some other NFT projects, it\u2019s important to remember that DeGods has only just migrated to the Ethereum network.\n\nAn analysis of Unique Active Wallets (UAW), transactions and volume data on DappRadar revealed that DeGods experienced a decline in activity. According to the graph, the most recent recorded activity was on March 26. The decline could be due to various factors, such as the migration to Ethereum or changes in market sentiment.\n\nIn contrast, the y00ts NFT collection enjoyed a successful start on the Polygon network.\n\nAccording to CoinMarketCap\u2019s latest data, the project achieved impressive results within a 24-hour timeframe. The volume increased by over 190%, while sales more than doubled. Additionally, the project has already attracted over 1,300 owners.\n\nImpact on Solana and Ethereum NFT trades\n\nData from Santiment indicated that there has been a notable increase in NFT trade volume in USD on both Solana and Ethereum. As of this writing, the trade volume on Solana reached approximately $5.4 million. Moreover, there was a visible spike in NFT trade volume on the Solana network since 17 March.\n\nIn addition to Solana, the Ethereum network has also seen a noticeable increase in NFT trade volume since 17 March, according to Santiment\u2019s data. As of this writing, the NFT trade volume in USD on Ethereum reached around $7.8 million."
