        "content": "Payment company Visa is seeking to build \u201cmuscle memory\u201d around settlements, with plans to allow customers to convert digital assets to fiat currencies on its platform, according to a presentation from the company\u2019s crypto division head at StarkWare Sessions 2023.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been testing how to actually accept settlement payments from issuers in USDC starting on Ethereum and paying out in USDC (USDC) on Ethereum. So, these are large value settlement payments,\u201d Cuy Sheffield said during a fireside chat at the event. Cointelegraph\u2019s team is on the ground in Tel Aviv covering the two-day Ethereum community conference.\n\nAccording to the executive, global settlement with digital assets and fiat currencies is one of the avenues that Visa is investing in. He specifically stated:\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s been one of the areas where we want to build muscle memory. The same way that we can convert between dollars in euros on a cross-border transaction, we should be able to convert between digital tokenized dollars and traditional dollars.\u201d\n\nThe payment giant has been exploring how to incorporate blockchain technology into its existing network to move money faster, but settlements still take place on the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications, or SWIFT system, a not-for-profit cooperative society formed by European bankers with the purpose of facilitating secure and standardized transaction communication between its members.\n\n. @cuysheffield and @visa have fell into the rabbit hole of Account Abstraction!\n\n\n\nThis is huge! pic.twitter.com/CFniLLBq5C \u2014 Starknet-Ecosystem.com \u2728 (@StarkNetEco) February 5, 2023\n\n\u201cWe set all over Swift, so we can\u2019t move money as frequently as we\u2019d like because there are a number of limitations that exist in those networks. And so, we\u2019ve been experimenting, we publicly announced. We\u2019ve been testing how to actually accept settlement payments [with stablecoins],\u201d Sheffield explained.\n\nRecently speaking at Visa\u2019s annual shareholder meeting, former CEO Al Kelly briefly shared the firm\u2019s plans for central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and private stablecoins, claiming that \u201cstablecoins and central bank digital currencies have the potential to play a meaningful role in the payments space, and we have a number of initiatives underway.\u201d\n\nSheffield confirmed the company\u2019s view of blockchain technology and digital assets. \u201cWe\u2019re thinking a lot about how to take some of the value that Visa provides on existing bank rails, with existing forms of beyond in a rebuild that on top of blockchain rails, using stable boards. If we think there are huge opportunities in that area, it just kind of stays on emerging.\""

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nStarkWare, the Israeli-based company that is behind popular Ethereum layer-2 scaling solutions StarkEx and StarkNet, today revealed plans to make its STARK Prover software open source.\n\nTo help the world\u2019s largest smart contract platform achieve faster and cheaper transactions, StarkWare leverages the technology known as zero-knowledge rollups, which bundles hundreds of thousands of transactions together off-chain, and then verifies them on-chain for just a fraction of the cost.\n\nThe STARK Prover will be renamed to the Starknet Prover and placed under an Apache 2.0 license, which will allow Web3 developers to copy and alter the software's source code, and enable them to commercially distribute any copies or modifications they make without concern for royalties.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis is a landmark moment for scaling Ethereum, and in a wider sense for cryptography,\u201d StarkWare president and co-founder of Eli Ben-Sasson said during an event in Tel Aviv on Sunday.\n\nThis will put the STARK tech \u201cin its rightful place, as a public good which will be used to benefit everyone,\u201d he added.\n\nEthereum scaling \u201cmagic wand\u201d\n\nSTARK is in a class of cryptographic protocols invented by Ben-Sasson and used by StarkNet and StarkEx to deliver scale while maintaining the security of the underlying Ethereum blockchain.\n\nThe codebase on which StarkWare is building the Starknet Prover is based on the software that has been in use since June 2020, proving transactions from well-known StarkEx-based decentralized applications (dApps) such as Immutable X, Sorare, and dYdX, among others. In this capacity, it has processed 327 million transactions, minted 95 million NFTs, and settled approximately $824 billion, according to the company.\n\nStarkWare also said that making the Starknet Prover open-source will boost its accessibility to developers and promote collaboration within the community. The move will take time to implement and will mark the final phase of decentralizing the company\u2019s technology stake once completed.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe think of the Prover as the magic wand of STARK technology,\u201d said Ben-Sasson. \u201cBut of course, it\u2019s not actually magic, it\u2019s sturdy cryptography and today we\u2019re saying that everyone who wants should make it their own. They should know exactly how it works, modify the code, edit the code, and distribute it further.\u201d\n\nPreviously, StarkWare open-sourced such elements as Cairo 1.0, the upgraded version of the native smart contract language for StarkNet, Papyrus Full Node, a Rust implementation of a StarkNet full node, and the new StarkNet Sequencer, a tool responsible for ordering the transactions and producing blocks.\n\nThe StarkWare president also took an opportunity to address issues the wider crypto industry faces following the FTX collapse, saying that the sector \u201cis crying out\u201d for solutions that will deliver scale and better user experience (UX) design.\n\nTo Ben-Sasson, these two aspects are \u201cthe key to giving people [the] confidence to choose a purer crypto experience, namely self-custody.\u201d\n\n\u201cEvery step we take to provide infrastructure and to make it accessible and decentralized is a catalyst for devs to build. And the quicker and more broadly they build, the faster we\u2019ll see mass onboarding to solutions that truly enable people to manage their own funds. So there\u2019s a direct line between open-sourcing key tech and popularizing self-custody,\u201d he said."

        "title": "Bitcoin, Ethereum and select altcoins set to resume rally despite February slump - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "After the impressive rally in January, Bitcoin (BTC) seems to be taking a breather in February. This is a positive sign because vertical rallies are rarely sustainable. A minor dip could shake out the nervous longs and provide an opportunity for long-term investors to add to their positions.\n\nHas Bitcoin price bottomed?\n\nThe opinion remains divided, however, on whether Bitcoin has bottomed out or not. Some analysts expect the rally to reverse direction and nosedive below the November low while others believe the markets will continue to move up and frustrate the traders who are waiting to buy at lower levels.\n\nCrypto market data daily view. Source: Coin360\n\nIn an interview with Cointelegraph, Morgan Creek Capital Management founder and CEO Mark Yusko said \u201cthe crypto summer\u201d could begin as early as the second quarter of this year.\n\nHe expects risk assets to turn bullish if the United States Federal Reserve signals that it will slow down or pause interest rate hikes. Another potential bullish catalyst for Bitcoin is the block reward halving in 2024.\n\nCould the altcoins continue their up-move while Bitcoin consolidates in the near term? Let\u2019s study the charts of Bitcoin and select altcoins that may outperform in the next few days.\n\nBTC/USDT\n\nBitcoin has been gradually correcting since hitting $24,255 on Feb. 2. This indicates profit booking by short-term traders. The price is nearing the strong support zone between $22,800 and $22,292. The 20-day exponential moving average ($22,436) is also located in this zone, hence the buyers are expected to defend the zone with all their might.\n\nBTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe upsloping 20-day EMA and the relative strength index (RSI) in the positive territory indicate that bulls have the edge. If the price turns up from the support zone, the bulls will again attempt to catapult the BTC/USDT pair to $25,000. This level should act as a formidable resistance.\n\nOn the downside, a break below the support zone could trigger several stop losses and that may start a deeper pullback. The pair could first drop to $21,480 and if this support also fails to hold up, the next stop may be the 50-day simple moving average ($19,572).\n\nBTC/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that the price is trading inside an ascending channel but the RSI has been forming a negative divergence. This suggests that the bullish momentum may be weakening. A break and close below the channel could tilt the short-term advantage in favor of the bears. The pair could then fall toward $21,480.\n\nAlternatively, if the price rebounds off the support line of the channel, the bulls will again attempt to kick the pair above the channel. If they manage to do that, the pair may resume its uptrend.\n\nETH/USDT\n\nEther (ETH) has been trading near the $1,680 resistance for the past few days. Usually, a tight consolidation near an overhead resistance resolves to the upside.\n\nETH/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nWhile the upsloping 20-day EMA ($1,586) indicates advantage to buyers, the negative divergence on the RSI suggests that the bulls may be losing their grip. If bulls want to assert their dominance, they will have to propel and sustain the price above $1,680.\n\nIf they do that, the ETH/USDT pair may rally to $1,800. This level may again act as a resistance but if bulls do not allow the price to dip below $1,680, the rally may stretch to $2,000.\n\nInstead, if the price turns down and plummets below the 20-day EMA, the ETH/USDT pair could tumble to $1,500. This is an important support level to monitor because a bounce here could keep the pair range-bound between $1,500 and $1,680. On the other hand, if the $1,500 support cracks, the pair may dive to $1,352.\n\nETH/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that the bears have pulled the price below the 20-EMA. This is the first indication that the bulls may take a step back. There is minor support at the 50-SMA but if it fails to hold, the pair may slide to $1,550 and then to $1,500.\n\nConversely, if the price turns up from the moving averages, the bulls will again attempt to thrust the pair above the overhead resistance. If they succeed, the pair may resume the uptrend.\n\nOKB/USDT\n\nWhile most cryptocurrencies are well below their all-time high, OKB (OKB) hit a new high on Feb. 5. This suggests that bulls are in command.\n\nOKB/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nSome traders may book profits near the overhead resistance of $44.35 as it may act as a formidable resistance. If the price turns down from the current level but rebounds off the 20-day EMA ($37), it will suggest that bulls continue to buy the dips.\n\nThat could increase the possibility of a break above $45. The OKB/USDT pair could first skyrocket to $50 and thereafter to $58.\n\nIf the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA, it will indicate that the traders may be rushing to the exit. The pair could then drop to $34 and later to the 50-day SMA ($30).\n\nOKB/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that the bears are trying to protect the $44.35 level. The pair could turn down and reach the moving averages, which is an important support to keep an eye on. If the price bounces off the moving averages, the bulls will again try to overcome the barrier at $45 and start the next leg of the uptrend.\n\nContrarily, if the price breaks below the 50-SMA, the selling could intensify and the pair may slump to $36 and then to $34. Such a move could delay the resumption of the uptrend.\n\nRelated: Fantom\u2019s 5-week winning streak is in danger \u2014 Will FTM price lose 35%?\n\nALGO/USDT\n\nAlgorand\u2019s (ALGO) recovery reached the breakdown level of $0.27 on Feb. 3. The bears defended this level but the bulls have not given up much ground. This suggests that the bulls expect the relief rally to continue.\n\nALGO/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe upsloping 20-day EMA ($0.24) and the RSI in the positive territory indicate that bulls have the upper hand. If the price turns up from the 20-day EMA, the likelihood of a break above $0.27 increases. The ALGO/USDT pair could then travel to $0.31 where the bears may try to offer strong resistance.\n\nIf the price turns down from this level but bounces off $0.27, it will suggest that the downtrend could be over in the short term. The pair could then attempt a rally to $0.38.\n\nThis positive view could invalidate in the near term if the pair turns down from the current level and slides below $0.23. The pair could then dive to the 50-day SMA ($0.21).\n\nALGO/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that the bears are guarding the $0.27 level but a minor positive is that the bulls have not allowed the price to stay below the 50-SMA. If the price turns up from the current level, the bulls will again try to clear the overhead hurdle. If they do that, the pair could pick up momentum and surge toward $0.31.\n\nContrary to this assumption, if the price continues and breaks below the moving averages, the pair risks a drop to $0.23. The bears will have to smash this support to gain the upper hand.\n\nTHETA/USDT\n\nTheta Network (THETA) successfully completed a retest of the breakout level on Feb. 1, indicating that bulls have flipped the downtrend line into support.\n\nTHETA/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe bulls will try to push the price to the overhead resistance at $1.20. This level may act as a minor hurdle but if bulls do not give up much ground from $1.20, the THETA/USDT pair could extend its up-move to $1.34. This is an important level for the bears to defend because if this resistance crumbles, the pair could soar to $1.65.\n\nIf bears want to stop the bulls, they will have to quickly pull the price back below the 20-day EMA. The pair could then fall to $0.97 and later to the 50-day SMA ($0.89).\n\nTHETA/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe pair bounced off the $0.97 level, which becomes an important level to watch out for on the downside. A breach of this level is likely to tilt the advantage in favor of the bears and open the doors for a possible drop to $0.85.\n\nThe rally is facing resistance near $1.20 but the upsloping 20-EMA and the RSI in the positive territory indicate that the path of least resistance is to the upside. If buyers push the price above $1.20, the momentum should pick up for a rally toward $1.34.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.
