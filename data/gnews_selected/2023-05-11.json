        "content": "The Ethereum blockchain failed to finalize transactions for slightly less than half an hour, developers said on May 11.\n\nThe incident lasted for approximately 25 minutes, and Ethereum contributor terence.eth said that the issue has now been solved. He wrote:\n\n\u201cMainnet has been finalized, and we are investigating the incident now. More to come!\u201d\n\nEthereum contributor Superphiz said that although Ethereum\u2019s beacon chain stopped finalizing, the blockchain is \u201cdesigned to be resilient\u201d against such issues. The chain continued to partially process transactions during the incident.\n\nThough the cause is still unknown, Superphiz suggested that the issue may have resulted from a lack of diversity of clients. He said that loss of finality could have been avoided if no client had more than one-third dominance over the network. He added that the blockchain avoided forking because no client had a supermajority.\n\nCurrently, two consensus clients \u2014 Lighthouse and Prsym \u2014 dominate Ethereum, each with 38% dominance. Only three other clients have a notable presence.\n\nEthereum has experienced other outages in the past: it experienced a DDOS attack in 2016 and saw partial Infura-related outages in November 2020. In 2016, an attack on The DAO also greatly affected Ethereum.\n\nusechatgpt init success"

        "content": "One metric indicates Ethereum (ETH) could be heading into an \u201copportunity zone,\u201d according to the crypto analytics firm Santiment.\n\nThe firm notes in a new analysis that ETH\u2019s 30-day market value to realized value (MVRV), which traders use to detect overbought or oversold conditions, is now out of the \u201cdanger zone\u201d and headed towards the \u201copportunity zone,\u201d an area where ETH prices have historically bottomed out.\n\nMVRV is the ratio of an asset\u2019s current market cap divided by its realized capitalization \u2013 i.e. the value of all measured ETH at the price they were bought. MVRV 30-Day is a timebound metric that only analyzes that ratio among tokens that have moved at least once in the past 30 days.\n\nSantiment also notes that ETH\u2019s recent local price top coincided with the Ethereum Foundation moving 14,999 ETH to the crypto exchange Kraken over the weekend.\n\n\u201cWith the ETH foundation moving 14,999 coins to Kraken, an argument can be made that this move perfectly coincided with Ethereum\u2019s local price top. Our insight covers the massive surge in active deposits & potential dip buy opportunities coming up.\u201d\n\nThe last three times a significant amount of ETH left the Ethereum Foundation wallet, it marked local price tops, according to the analytics firm. Santiment does clarify, however, that Ethereum Foundation transactions prior to that did not indicate price tops.\n\nEthereum is trading at $1,831 at time of writing. The second-ranked crypto asset by market cap is up 1.86% in the past 24 hours.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s Beacon Chain temporarily stopped finalizing Thursday, according to a community health consultant of the blockchain.\n\nThe incident occurred at roughly 4 pm ET, according to tweets by the pseudonymous superphiz.eth.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why yet, but in general the chain is designed to be resilient against this, transactions will continue as usual and finalization will kick in when the problem is resolved,\u201d they tweeted.\n\nEthereum had a hard time reaching consensus, resulting in a brief, but drastic, downtick in validator participation on the consensus layer, according to Blockworks Research Senior Analyst Sam Martin.\n\n\u201cThis led to a period of time where Ethereum blocks were not being finalized, but blocks were still being validated as normal on the execution layer,\u201d he added. \u201cThis is yet another instance that highlights the importance of client diversity amongst Ethereum\u2019s validator set.\u201d\n\nClient diversity refers to the need to have multiple independent clients to ensure the decentralization of a network.\n\nA follow-up tweet at about 4:50 pm ET suggested blocks were being finalized again.\n\nIf a consensus client has over 33% of its Ethereum nodes compromised, the Beacon Chain could stop finalizing.\n\nThis means that user transactions could be tampered with or changed, threatening the security of the Ethereum blockchain as a whole.\n\nHistorical precedent shows that having a diverse set of validators can prevent denial-of-service attacks. During the Shanghai denial-of-service attacks in 2016, attackers tricked the dominant client at the time (Geth) into slowing down block operations. Alternative clients who were not affected by the vulnerability were online at the time, and able to prevent Ethereum from being compromised.\n\nSuperphiz.eth said the loss of finalization might be \u201cthe first real-world test of our consensus client diversity work,\u201d and called the incident \u201cbig, but inconsequential.\u201d\n\n\u201cDecentralization on all levels limits the impact of these events, regardless of what caused this we must continue hardening every vector,\u201d superphiz.eth added.\n\nSuperphiz didn\u2019t immediately return a request for comment.\n\nThe incident is currently being investigated by Ethereum developers and more information is expected to be revealed.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nUpdated May 11, 2023 at 5:54 pm ET: Added additional context and comments throughout.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."
