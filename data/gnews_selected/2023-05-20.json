We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to a recent report by on-chain data vendor Santiment, the two biggest cryptocurrencies by market cap, Bitcoin and Ethereum, are being actively withdrawn from crypto exchanges.\n\nIn the meantime, Whale Alert has detected several big BTC amounts withdrawn from the Coinbase exchange to cold wallets.\n\n\"Self-custody increase hints at future bull runs\"\n\nThe Santiment analytics team has tweeted that investors continue to move their Bitcoin and Ethereum stashes from crypto exchanges to cold storage wallets. The supplies of these two major cryptos on trading platforms have been shrinking and moving into self-custody.\n\nSantiment wrote that even if this is not a perfect indicator, still overall this hints at future bull runs, but these coins need enough time to play them out.\n\nAt press time, Bitcoin is trading at $26,905. Ethereum is changing hands at $1,814 per coin, according to CoinMarketCap.\n\n\ud83d\udcc9\ud83d\udc4c #Bitcoin & #Ethereum both continue to quietly see more and more of their existing supplies move into self custody.

The community is concerned that these wallets and the assets stored in them can now become an easy target for hackers with Ledger's new upgrade.\n\nWhales shift BTC from crypto exchanges\n\nPopular crypto tracker Whale Alert has noticed several large Bitcoin transactions made from a major U.S. crypto exchange Coinbase and between anonymous wallets too.\n\nThe largest of them carried a whopping 10,000 BTC worth $268,554,134. Other seven transactions moved a total of 5,813 BTC from Coinbase to cold wallets in lumps of 823-830 Bitcoins each."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nThe prices of Bitcoin and Ethereum remained flat for the third week running as the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) showed no signs of conceding ground over its claim to being the industry\u2019s lead regulator.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) added a modest 0.3% to its value over the last seven days and currently trades at $27,110.29. Likewise, Ethereum (ETH) only grew 0.6% and currently changes hands at $1,825.\n\nThere were no substantial losses among any of the top thirty cryptocurrencies this week. Three projects posted notable rallies.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nXRP blew up 9.4% and entered the weekend at $0.46. The coin\u2019s progenitor, Ripple, scored a small courtroom victory against the SEC in the latter\u2019s ongoing lawsuit against the company for selling XRP as an unregistered security.\n\nOn Tuesday, Judge Analisa Torres blocked the SEC\u2019s motion to seal documents linked to a speech by former SEC director Bill Hinman explaining why Bitcoin and Ethereum should not be considered securities. Torres said the documents in question were \u201csubject to a strong presumption of public access.\u201d\n\nRipple\u2019s defense previously made Hinman\u2019s case for XRP, but the SEC countered that Hinman\u2019s speech represented Hinman\u2019s personal views before unsuccessfully requesting the motion to seal the documents.\n\nRipple made headlines again on Thursday with the news that it has launched its Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) platform. The platform is pitched to central banks and governments looking to create their own centrally-issued stablecoins, alongside financial institutions that will distribute them and the users\u2014both retail and corporate\u2014that will trade, hold and use them.\n\nAnother big mover was Litecoin (LTC) which this week blew up 13.2% and trades for $91.29 at the time of writing. The Litecoin network recently increased in popularity as a result of Ordinals Inscriptions, a craze that brings NFT-style assets to blockchains with unsophisticated smart contracts, like Bitcoin and Litecoin.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEthereum staking token Lido DAO (LDO) surged 13.7% this week, sustaining its momentum from last week.\n\nSEC \u201cready to help\u201d\n\nOn Monday, SEC chairman Gary Gensler pushed back against claims that the SEC\u2019s regulatory guidance to crypto companies was not clear. Speaking at a keynote session, Gensler insisted \u201cthe rules have already been published\u201d and added his agency \u201cstands ready to help them to come into compliance.\u201d\n\nThe SEC\u2019s position is widely perceived as disingenuous because the regulator is simultaneously bombarding the industry with lawsuits. Even one of the SEC\u2019s own Commissioners, Hester Pierce, has dissented a couple of times due to the lack of clarity, most recently over her agency\u2019s decision to shut down Kraken\u2019s staking platform and its proposal to amend the definition of \u201cexchange\u201d to bring crypto companies into its jurisdiction.\n\nAnother noteworthy event on Monday was the SEC\u2019s response to Coinbase\u2019s petition for a writ of mandamus, an order that would require the agency to clarify its rules on crypto regulations. The regulator\u2019s lawyers urged the court to dismiss Coinbase\u2019s request.\n\nAround the world\n\nIn the South Korean press on Monday, Samsung announced its partnership with the Bank of Korea (BOK) to jointly conduct research aimed at developing an ecosystem for a CBDC.\n\nBoth parties signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to deepen their research into offline CBDC payments, according to a Korea Herald report.\n\nSamsung previously participated in BOK\u2019s CBDC pilot project last year, developing offline CBDC technology to enable transfers and payments through near-field communication (NFC), even when the transaction\u2019s sender and recipient devices were not connected to the internet.\n\nOn Tuesday, European Union Finance Ministers adopted the bloc\u2019s Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) bill with no objections. This marks the final step in the process of the legislation coming into force and now means that the EU has a comprehensive and uniform set of guidelines for regulating crypto throughout its 27 member states.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFinally on Wednesday, a cross-party committee of British MPs on Wednesday published a report recommending that the British government legislates crypto as gambling. The bizarre proposal envisions handing oversight to the Gambling Commission and includes possible taxes to support addiction and debt advice."

        "title": "The Weaknesses of Ethereum VS Modern Blockchains: Interview With Radix - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "If the slew of smart contract hacks that netted attackers over $3 billion in 2022 has taught us anything, it\u2019s that decentralized finance (DeFi) is still an immature industry.\n\nBesides exploits, DeFi still faces scaling issues related to the computational power needed to power complex transactions, and the throughput needed to support the worldwide financial system in the coming years.\n\nAs the current king of DeFi, the Ethereum network is worth assessing to identify the problems and limitations contributing to the industry\u2019s current roadblocks.\n\nAt Consensus 2023, CryptoPotato sat down with Piers Ridyard \u2013 CEO of RDX Works \u2013 to discuss ways in which Ethereum is not truly optimized for DeFi. He explained some of the better-suited technology underlying modern blockchains, including the newly popular smart contract platform Radix.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Clunky Programming Language\n\nAccording to Ridyard, DeFi in crypto is currently lacking in three major areas: user experience, developer experience, and scalability.\n\nThe first two issues largely stem from the less-than-ideal programming languages for developers to express their ideas for particular financial applications. One such language, he said, is Ethereum\u2019s Solidity.\n\n\u201cSolidity is like banging your head against a brick wall,\u201d he stated. \u201cIf you want to build assets that are highly secure and you want to build financial applications that are highly secure, it\u2019s basically impossible to make it secure in a way that is easy for developers to use.\u201d\n\nRidyard\u2019s company RDX Works is a core developer for Radix \u2013 a DeFi-focused blockchain whose native token, XRD, roared upwards by over 200% from early to mid-April.\n\nUnlike Ethereum and other chains, Radix uses a unique programming language called Scrypto, which is specifically focused on making financial applications easier to build and use.\n\n\n\nUnderneath Scrypto is the Radix engine which includes primitives that are part of the ledger itself, providing the essential building blocks for developers to build apps without having to start complex development from scratch.\n\n\u201cYou are not creating your own smart contract that then defines what it means to be a token, what it means to be a token transfer and tracking balances,\u201d said Ridyard. \u201cAll of that is done by the ledger itself.\u201d\n\nThe Radix engine also protects applications on the platform from \u201creentrancy attacks,\u201d a common DeFi loophole that lets a hacker continually withdraw from a smart contract until the victim goes bankrupt. Specifically, the engine prevents infinite callbacks that lead to recursive loops which let hackers drain a contract to zero.\n\nIn February, the DeFi protocol dforce lost $3.6 million to such a bug. \u201cA whole host of maybe half a billion dollars worth of hacks that have just been from reentrancy disappear just because of how we\u2019ve implemented the architecture,\u201d said Ridyard.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Consensus Mechanism\n\nEthereum\u2019s \u201cMerge\u201d upgrade in September \u2013 which changed its consensus mechanism from proof of work to proof of stake \u2013 was widely praised as the greatest technical feat in the history of crypto. However, in 2023, even proof of stake may be proving less advanced of a mechanism than what newer chains can offer \u2013 especially on the scalability front.\n\nFor example, Ethereum doesn\u2019t allow for the parallel execution of transactions that would enable massive throughput. All transactions must be ordered, even if they are unrelated to each other.\n\nBy contrast, Radix uses the \u201cCerberus\u201d consensus mechanism, which obviates the need for ordering. \u201cThey can start and end whenever they need to start and end, and you don\u2019t need to agree between them which one came first and which one came second,\u201d said Ridyard.\n\nRadix still comes baked in with a delegated proof of stake system that protects Cerberus. However, Ridyard doesn\u2019t consider either proof of work or proof of stake to be \u201cconsensus mechanisms,\u201d but rather \u201ccivil protection mechanisms.\u201d\n\n\u201cA consensus mechanism, is how do the nodes come to an agreement. The civil mechanism is about, how do you defend those nodes from being maliciously attacked in the process of coming to an agreement,\u201d he elaborated.\n\nRidyard said he admired proof of stake for its energy efficiency, but noted that proof of work chains \u2013 like Bitcoin \u2013 solve certain \u201cbootstrapping\u201d and \u201crandomization\u201d problems.\n\nDeFi and the SEC\n\nBesides technological limitations, DeFi and the blockchains underpinning it are currently under immense regulatory pressure from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The agency currently seeks to regulate DeFi exchanges under existing securities exchange laws.\n\nWhile Ridyard sees a possibility that regulators \u201ckill\u201d DeFi in America for a period, he doesn\u2019t envision the industry dying globally due to the overwhelming benefit it can provide certain economies. Ultimately, he believes \u201creading the tea leaves\u201d of how regulators will interpret certain enforcement rules is a bit of a distraction, and that DeFi will ultimately adapt to best conform to each country\u2019s political and economic will.\n\n\u201cWhat the regulators are trying to do is find the handles in which they can exercise enforcement against what the government and by and large, what the voting public could consider to be the things they want and they don\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is going to be some give and take.\u201d"

        "title": "Who invented NFTs?: A brief history of nonfungible tokens - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "A brief history of NFTs: From inception to global recognition What started with Bitcoin-based colored coins in 2012\u20132013 became a phenomenon in 2021 and is still thriving. The Ethereum blockchain had a pivotal role in popularizing NFTs. Though 2021 turned out to be the year of Nonfungible tokens (NFTs), it wasn\u2019t the year when the technology was invented. Kevin McCoy minted the first NFT, \u201cQuantum,\u201d on the Namecoin blockchain in 2014. Nonetheless, the inception of Bitcoin-based colored coins in 2012\u20132013 marked the beginning of the concept that led to the development of BRC-20 tokens. This idea stemmed from a paper authored by Meni Rosenfield in 2012, and it paved the way for the evolution of digital tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain. The world, however, noticed NFTs in 2017. This was mainly due to the arrival of the Ethereum blockchain, which overcame the limitations in the blockchains prior to it when it came to hosting NFTs. Ethereum not only provided NFTs with a reliable solution for critical things such as token creation, storage, programming and trading but also lowered the entry barrier for launching NFT projects. A brief history of NFTs can be segregated into a timeline:\n\nThe evolution of NFTs: From colored coins to the emergence of Rare Pepes and Spells of Genesis As mentioned, the story took off with colored coins, which were created to represent and manage ownership of real-world assets on the blockchain. They were different from Bitcoin (BTC) because of the \u201cnonfungible\u201d element that provided them with a unique utility. Demonstrating a humongous leap in Bitcoin\u2019s capabilities, colored coins were composed of tiny fractions of a Bitcoin, which could be as minuscule as a satoshi. Use cases of colored coins, such as the representation of property, coupons, or usage as digital collectibles, subscriptions, shares and access tokens, helped people realize the potential of blockchains for issuing assets. Bitcoin, however, was never intended to be used as a database for tokens, which meant that colored coins just remained at the concept level. However, the development did set off a series of experiments that culminated in NFTs. The first of the NFTs was \u201cQuantum,\u201d as mentioned before, an octagon-shaped animation. The arrival of Ethereum provided NFTs with the platform they required to flourish. A major project of this period that enabled the development of digital assets was The Counterparty platform built on Bitcoin. A spectrum of \u201cRare Pepes\u201d NFTs was released on The Counterparty, initiating the use case of NFT as artwork. \u201cSpells of Genesis,\u201d created on Ethereum, was another big NFT project after The Counterparty.\n\nThe rise of NFTs in gaming and the metaverse: From CryptoPunks to Axie Infinity Ethereum introducing a set of token standards facilitated the steady movement of NFTs toward the blockchain. The token standard informs developers how to deploy new tokens. The success of the Rare Pepes was followed by Larva Labs, a software development company that launched CryptoPunks, its own generative series of NFTs, created by John Watkinson and Matt Hall. Inspired by London punk culture, the project has 10,000 unique pieces, with no two characters resembling each other. CryptoPunks became a huge success and was the foundation of many other NFT projects, including the Bored Ape Yacht Club, one of the biggest NFT collections. The next major launch was CryptoKitties, which came up during the ETHWaterloo hackathon, back in October 2017. The game enables players to buy, sell and create NFTs representing virtual cats with desirable traits on Ethereum. Post CryptoKitties, NFT gaming became increasingly popular. NFT gaming combined with metaverse projects to formulate a new momentum. A major project of this era was Ethereum-based Decentraland, a virtual world that allows players to explore games and build and collect assets. In October 2018, Axie Infinity, an NFT-based battle game, was released. It set the ball rolling for play-to-earn (P2E) games, which enabled gamers to earn in-game rewards while playing. It\u2019s a pioneering video game on the Ethereum blockchain involving Axies, creatures that are rare NFTs with unique attributes. Gamers fight battles using Axies and build more attributes into them.\n\nExpanding beyond Ethereum: Non-Ethereum blockchains and the NFT ecosystem Certain factors propelled NFTs to a sharp surge in 2021. Various blockchains set up new standards specifically for NFTs. NFTs in 2021 witnessed a spike in supply and demand. According to NFT data company NonFungible.com, NFT trading jumped around 21,000% to top $17 billion during the year. The usage of NFTs in the art market was a major factor behind the surge. The emergence of digital art provided artists with another venue to showcase their creativity and store their work, which could be verified as well. Thanks to these advantages, digital art gained traction and helped propel the NFT boon. This was the time when renowned auction houses such as Christie\u2019s and Sotheby\u2019s moved their auctions online. Moreover, these auctions included art that pushed the popularity of NFTs. It was at Christie\u2019s where Beeple\u2019s \u201cEverydays: the First 5000 Days\u201d NFT made a record-shattering sale of $69 million. A sale of that scale drew the attention of non-Ethereum blockchains and blockchain enthusiasts toward NFTs. Buoyed by the NFT mania, blockchains such as Cardano, Solana, Flow and Tezos started work on their own platforms for NFTs. In September 2021, smart contracts became functional on Cardano, which facilitated the development of NFT applications on the platform. A few new standards were set up by various blockchains to establish the authenticity of nonfungible assets. A key event of the year was Facebook rebranding itself as Meta and strolling into the metaverse space. NFTs were always an integral part of the metaverse, leading to the surge in demand for NFTs."
