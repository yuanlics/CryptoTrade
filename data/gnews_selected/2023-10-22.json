        "title": "Ethereum Price Forecast: ETH crash to $1,000 can be prevented on the reclaim of a key resistance level - FXStreet",
        "content": "Share:\n\nEthereum price created a multi-month ascending triangle pattern that breached the downside.\n\nETH is currently retesting the $1,639 resistance level that has been pivotal for the past year.\n\nThe theoretical forecasting method hints at a 45% crash for ETH after the bearish breakout.\n\nEthereum (ETH) price breached its multi-month consolidation, favoring the bears. This breakout has caused panic among investors, and if the outlook does not improve for ETH, more downside is likely. While the weekend price action has given bulls some hope, ETH needs to overcome two key resistance levels before investors can breath a sigh of relief.\n\nRead more: Ether crosses $1.6K, Bitcoin SV leads Altcoin gains with 30% bump\n\nEthereum price at crossroads\n\nEthereum (ETH) price set up four higher lows and three equal highs since May 2022. Connecting key swing points using trend lines reveals an ascending triangle pattern. This technical formation is bullish, and a decisive breakout forecasts an uptrend equal to the distance between the first swing high and swing low.\n\nBut for Ethereum price, the breakout was bearish, which forecasts a 45% crash to $998. This target is obtained by adding the distance between the first swing high and swing low to the breakout point at $1,825.\n\nIn its descent, Ethereum price has already breached the $1,639 support level, which has been key for the past year. If buyers fail to overcome this hurdle, it is likely ETH will continue its southbound move and eventually tag the $1,000 psychological level. From the current position of $1,598, this descent would constitute a 38% crash.\n\nAlso read: Solana vs. Ethereum: Renewed debate erupts over efficiency, development and scalability\n\nETH/USDT 4-hour chart\n\nOn the other hand, Ethereum price has produced three distinctive higher lows over the past month, which are not confirmed by the Relative Strength Index (RSI). This non-conformity is termed as bullish divergence and often leads to a small rally to the upside.\n\nDue to the aforementioned bullish signal, if Ethereum price manages to flip the $1,639 hurdle into a support floor on the daily or three-day time frame, it could provide bulls a respite. This move could likely attract more sidelined buyers and potentially trigger a minor rally to retest the next key resistance levels at $1,767 and $2,000."

        "content": "A venture capitalist who called the bottom of the crypto bear market last year says that one of Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) biggest rivals is the best contrarian altcoin play for the next bull run.\n\nCrypto investor Chris Burniske says that Solana (SOL) is the best \u201cnon-consensus\u201d opportunity for an upcoming market expansion in the digital asset space.\n\nBurniske, the former head of crypto at Cathie Wood\u2019s ARK Invest, says that SOL\u2019s non-consensus status today is similar to ETH\u2019s in the bear market of 2018.\n\n\u201cETH was non-consensus in 2018/2019, but is now consensus and anyone worth their salt as a crypto investor is there \u2013 quality asset.\n\nBut SOL is the strongest non-consensus asset of this bear. Watch out for when it becomes a consensus long, lots of momo investors will be scrambling.\u201d\n\nLooking at Solana versus Ethereum (SOL/ETH), the investor says the pair looks like it may have enough steam to finally overcome the level that it lost during the collapse of the now-defunct crypto exchange FTX. FTX had close ties to Solana and its collapse brought uncertainty to the Ethereum competitor\u2019s ecosystem.\n\n\u201cSOL/ETH putting in some work to make 0.02 [ETH] happen, would close the FTX gap.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, SOL is trading for $29.51, up over 9% in the last 24 hours.\n\nThe crypto investor also says that other venture capitalists (VCs) are distracted with artificial intelligence (AI) and are missing out on the potential gains that could be had by picking up the discounts currently in the digital asset space.\n\n\u201cVCs that are smug about crypto getting trashed, while AI has become the hot new thing, don\u2019t realize the majority of overpriced AI rounds will be a graveyard for capital as the data incumbents mop the floor, while the low valuations we see in Web3 today will mint legends tomorrow.\u201d\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.
