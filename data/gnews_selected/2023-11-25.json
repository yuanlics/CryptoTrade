        "title": "Ethereum whale activity could pave way for ETH price to hit new yearly highs - FXStreet",
        "content": "Share:\n\nEthereum whales are accumulating the altcoin, sitting on $132.1 billion in ETH.\n\nWhales control 52% of Ethereum\u2019s circulating supply, supporting ETH price gain thesis.\n\nETH price eyes new yearly highs after overcoming the key resistance zone between $1,899 and $2,052.\n\nEthereum\u2019s large wallet investors have a bullish outlook on the second largest asset by market capitalization. ETH whales have consistently added the altcoin to their holdings in the past year. ETH price rallied past the psychological barrier at $2,000 on November 9.\n\nAlso read: Dogecoin price eyes recovery as whales scoop up DOGE\n\nEthereum whales accumulate the altcoin\n\nEthereum\u2019s 200 largest wallets have accumulated a total of 62.76 Ether tokens, worth $132.1 billion. The whale wallet holdings have climbed 30.3% since November 21, 2022, based on Santiment data. These large wallet investors\u2019 holdings represent 52% of the altcoin\u2019s circulating supply, therefore whale wallet activity is likely to have a direct impact on the asset\u2019s price.\n\n94,700 new Ethereum wallets that were created on November 21, mark the largest spike since July 2023, and support the narrative of ETH price gains.\n\nETH whale accumulation\n\nData from on-chain tracker Glassnode reveals that for the first time in the past nine months, large wallet addresses have accumulated the altcoin steadily. The nine month accumulation spree is therefore likely to strengthen ETH price uptrend. It represents increasing buying pressure from whales.\n\nAs seen in the Glassnode chart below, both whale address count and addresses with balance greater than 10,000 ETH observed a spike since November 14.\n\nEthereum whale address count and price\n\nThe asset rallied past a key resistance zone between $1,899 and $2,052, where 4.9 million ETH wallet addresses scooped up 41.35 million Ether tokens. At the time of writing, Ethereum price is $2,080.19. The altcoin faces minimal resistance, in the zone between $2,141 and $2,505. ETH finds strong support in the $1,899 to $2,052 zone, consistent demand from large wallet investors could therefore push the altcoin to new yearly highs.\n\nGlobal In/Out of the Money\n\nEthereum price yielded 6% weekly gains and 16% gains for holders in the past month."

The financial and market information provided on U.Today is intended for informational purposes only. U.Today is not liable for any financial losses incurred while trading cryptocurrencies. Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nEthereum ICO participant, dormant for over three years, has recently transferred 20,000 ETH (valued at approximately $42.4 million) to various destinations, including a 10 ETH deposit to the Kraken exchange. This awakening of a crypto giant correlates with movements in the Ethereum market that could have broader implications.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis \"whale,\" a term affectionately given to large-scale holders of cryptocurrency, originally acquired 100,000 ETH at the nascent stage of Ethereum's life, during the initial coin offering (ICO). With the ICO price around $0.31, the cost basis of this investment was a mere $31,000, a sum that pales in comparison to the current valuation of these assets.\n\nThe timing of such a move is critical. The Ethereum price chart shows the currency testing a resistance point, attempting to sustain its momentum above the $2,000 mark. The emergence of such a significant player, particularly one initiating transactions of this magnitude, could signal to the market a shift in sentiment or liquidity that may catalyze further price action.\n\nWhile the transfer of 20,000 ETH is substantial, the current Ethereum market cap is vast enough that such a transaction alone is unlikely to cause disruptive market waves. However, it does bring attention to the potential for large holders to move markets. Should this whale decide to liquidate a significant portion of their holdings, it could introduce a substantial amount of Ethereum into the market, potentially putting downward pressure on the price.\n\nConversely, if this whale were to lock in their holdings or disperse them in a way that suggests a long-term hold strategy, market confidence could be reinforced, possibly driving prices upward. The deposit to Kraken might be an initial step toward liquidity, but it does not necessarily predict a major sell-off."

        "title": "Ethereum vs Cardano: Key Differences to Watch Out - CoinGape",
        "content": "Key Takeaways Investing in Ethereum or Cardano depends on your investment preferences and risk appetite.\n\nTransaction fees and transaction speed must be considered before investing in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nThe cryptocurrency market has grown tremendously in terms of user penetration and revenue generation. Revenues are projected to reach US $37.9B in 2023, although these digital currencies are often associated with volatility and uncertainty. Multiple blockchain platforms are there in the crypto market offering different currencies. However, the two cryptocurrencies that have gained the limelight over the years are Ethereum and Cardano. Both of them rank among the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. This is not the only reason to invest in cryptos. This article will discuss similarities and key differences between Ethereum and Cardano\u2013 the two major cryptocurrencies, so you can make an informed investment decision.\n\nUnderstanding Ethereum and Cardano Ethereum in Brief Ethereum is a network of computers across the globe that follows the Ethereum protocol. It is a community-run technology that operates on blockchain to enable smart contracts and crypto trading. It is one of the best altcoins to invest your money in. Ethereum\u2019s History and Vision Ethereum was created by Vitalik Buterin in 2013 but gained public awareness in 2014 after the Bitcoin Conference in Miami, Florida. It promotes itself as a peer-to-peer network that can be used by anyone interested in coordinating globally, creating organizations, building apps, and sharing values. Ethereum cryptocurrency, Ether, can be used for digital global payments. Cardano in Brief Cardano defines itself as the first blockchain platform to be developed through peer-reviewed research. It offers unparalleled security to its users and helps them ease transactions and exchanges & provides a system for organizations to grow. It works on the famous Proof-of-stake model (PoS), with a distinctive two-layer structure. Cardano\u2019s History and Vision Cardano was developed by Charles Hoskinson and Jeremy Wood in 2017. Charles was one of the co-founders of Ethereum. During its launch, this highly valued cryptocurrency created 31 billion tokens. It also raised $60M+ during the initial coin offering in 2017. Cardano\u2019s core vision is to disrupt the way blockchains reach consensus so they utilize a proof-of-stake called Ouroboros to be the most environmentally sustainable blockchain platform.\n\nEthereum vs Cardano: Key Parameters for Comparison The key differences between Ethereum and Cardano blockchain platforms lie in their credibility, ability to process high-volume transactions, and other parameters. Here is a comparative analysis between the two. Points of Difference Cardano Ethereum Token The supply of Cardano cannot exceed the maximum cap set at 45 billion coins. Ethereum has not set any upper restrictions on token supply. In contrast, its supply is set to increase at a fixed rate of 4.5% annually. Transaction Speed Cardano provides a transaction speed of approximately 250 per second. The transaction speed lies between 15 seconds to 5 minutes for Ethereum. Transaction Fees The transaction fee stands at 0.16 USD. The average transaction fee is approximately 1.164 USD. Nodes Cardano also operates on three nodes that take care of crypto transactions, help participate in blockchain governance, and send information between mCore nodes and the public internet. Ethereum works on three popular nodes to run its operations smoothly. These nodes include light, full, and archive nodes. Each node has its function ranging from ensuring accuracy to containing transaction data and history from previous blocks. Scalability Cardano is more flexible than Ethereum and can handle more transaction volumes. Ethereum cannot handle more transactions and the system faces a lag when more investors use the platform at the same time.\n\nFuture Outlook: Which Altcoin is a Better Investment? Whether to invest your money in Ethereum vs Cardano depends on your investment preferences and risk appetite. However, crypto experts believe that investing in Ethereum is more beneficial because of the support it gets from its developer community and large ecosystem. In contrast, investment in Cardano can go high for long-term acquisitions as it is growing in emerging markets. The popularity of this crypto depends on the support it is getting in from its growing user base. However, you need to wait a while to see how it will impact the growth and prices of Cardano.\n\nConclusion Investment in cryptocurrencies might be risky because of market volatility. However, having proper knowledge of different currencies might help you make a better decision. If you are looking to park your funds in the top cryptos, understanding the Ethereum vs Cardano differences helps you learn which crypto is suitable for your investment."
