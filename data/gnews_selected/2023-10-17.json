        "content": "Ethereum price started a steady increase from the $1,520 zone against the US dollar. ETH is now struggling to clear the $1,605 and $1,620 resistance levels.\n\nEthereum is attempting a recovery wave above the $1,570 level.\n\nThe price is trading just above $1,575 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere is a key bullish trend line forming with support near $1,572 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair could rise further if there is a close above the $1,620 resistance level.\n\nEthereum Price Gains Traction\n\nEthereum started a fresh increase from the $1,520 level. ETH gained traction like Bitcoin and spiked above the $1,600 resistance level. It even climbed above $1,620, but the bears appeared near $1,650.\n\nA high was formed near $1,669 before there was a fresh decline. Ether trimmed gains and settled below the $1,600 level. It tested the $1,575 support and is currently consolidating near the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $1,669 swing high to the $1,574 low.\n\nEthereum is now trading just above $1,575 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is also a key bullish trend line forming with support near $1,572 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.\n\nOn the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $1,605 level. The first major resistance is near the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $1,669 swing high to the $1,574 low at $1,620. A close above the $1,620 resistance might start a decent increase.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nIn the stated case, Ether could rise and recover toward the $1,665 resistance. Any more gains might open the doors for a move toward $1,750.\n\nAnother Decline in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $1,605 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,575 level and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThe next key support is $1,550. A downside break below the $1,550 support might send the price further lower. In the stated case, the price could drop toward the $1,520 level. Any more losses may perhaps send Ether toward the $1,440 level.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bullish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now above the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $1,575\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $1,620\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.
