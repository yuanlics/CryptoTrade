        "title": "Staying optimistic about Ethereum's optimistic rollups - Blockworks",
        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s layer-2 ecosystems are growing.\n\nTo date, nearly 30 different layer-2, or L2, networks have deployed on Ethereum. Recent entrants include Mantle Network and Consensys\u2019 Linea. Projects like Scroll, Taiko and Honeypot are geared up to enter the game.\n\nThese second-layer protocols are intended to help scale the network by shifting some of the computational processes off Ethereum itself. For users, this means cheaper and faster transactions compared to how they might proceed on the mainnet.\n\nL2 networks have, over time, become economies of their own, collecting billions of dollars worth of digital assets in locked-up deposits along the way.\n\nToday\u2019s crop of L2 networks chiefly break down into two categories: optimistic rollups and zero-knowledge (ZK) rollups.\n\nOptimistic rollups move user transactions off-chain and then post the data back to Ethereum as \u201ccalldata.\u201d Zero-knowledge rollups, on the other hand, also post their transactions off-chain, but they can validate that it is accurate without revealing the information inside.\n\nOf those building optimistic rollups, prominent players in the game are Arbitrum, Optimism, Base and Mantle. The first two, Arbitrum and Optimism, have amassed nearly $9 billion in total value locked (TVL) between the two protocols.\n\nToday\u2019s zkSync-centric rollups include Polygon zkEVM, Starknet, Scroll and Linea.\n\nSo optimistic\n\nToday, optimistic rollups are the dominant protocols in the L2 space, according to data from L2BEAT, an information portal for the ecosystem.\n\nArbitrum currently possesses the highest market share, with a TVL of $5.82 billion.\n\nArbitrum developer Offchain Labs is still exploring ways for the protocol to become a stage-3 optimistic rollup, according to co-founder and Chief Technology Officer Harry Kalodner. Under that framework, the rollup would be completely run via smart contracts.\n\n\u201cI firmly believe that ZK rollups are much more complicated than optimistic rollups, and the amount of people who actually understand the tech is very tiny,\u201d Kalodner said.\n\nIn conversation, Kalodner noted that L2 growth often involves a trade-off between permissionless and accessibility of the technology.\n\n\u201cWe want to see everybody who wants to have an Arbitrum chain, have an Arbitrum chain, and we\u2019re balancing that with the competitive realities of the market and being the technical leader,\u201d Kalodner said.\n\nOptimism is the second-biggest rollup, with a TVL of $2.42 billion. Unlike Arbitrum, Optimism\u2019s source code is completely open-source, meaning that anyone can use the code to build their own L2.\n\nOf those, Base Protocol, Coinbase\u2019s decentralized L2 network, has most prominently used the Optimism stack to help build out its so-called superchain vision.\n\nJesse Pollak, head of protocols at Coinbase, believes that on-chain computation will compete directly with the likes of Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud over the next decade. In his view, future apps will be able to run their own infrastructure at a much higher rate.\n\n\u201cThe mental model I have for this is you can think of Base and OP mainnet as a shared compute model where you\u2019re in the same compute environment, then certain apps will scale out of the compute environment\u2026they\u2019re going to be app chains or L3s,\u201d he said.\n\nPollak notes that Base is focused on maximizing decentralization and security for as cheap as possible.\n\n\u201cThe strategy for us is to create an open source code base, that\u2019s standardized, configurable, modular, creates decentralized governance and funding infrastructure that attracts developers and makes them feel like they\u2019re part of something bigger than themselves,\u201d Pollak said.\n\nPollak added: \u201cThis way we have a bottoms-up groundswell of technology that even if it looks a little bit chaotic in the beginning, and maybe a bit slower. In the long run, it ends up being way faster and way bigger.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "How To Check An Ethereum Transaction: A Comprehensive Guide\n\n\n\nNavigating the world of blockchain can be challenging, especially when you\u2019re trying to keep track of your transactions.\n\nIn this guide, we\u2019ll explain how to check an Ethereum transaction by walking you through the process step-by-step.\n\nWe\u2019ll also answer common questions like \u201cHow do I track an Ethereum address?\u201d, \u201cHow do I check my crypto transaction?\u201d, and \u201cHow long does an Ethereum transaction take?\u201d.\n\nAlso read: Investor Poll Shows 47% Confidence in Ethereum\u2019s Rise Above Bitcoin\n\nUnderstanding Ethereum Transactions\n\nBefore we delve into how to check an Ethereum transaction, it\u2019s essential to grasp what Ethereum transactions are.\n\nEthereum is a decentralized platform that permits users to conduct transactions with digital assets.\n\nEach Ethereum transaction is recorded on the blockchain network, providing transparency and public accessibility. Validators or miners on the network verify these transactions, making Ethereum a truly decentralized system.\n\nYou initiate a transaction when you send Ether (ETH) from one address to another. This transaction is then broadcast to the Ethereum network, where it is checked and verified.\n\nOnce the transaction gets a confirmation, it is added to a new block and permanently recorded on the blockchain.\n\nHow Ethereum Transactions Work\n\nEthereum transactions function through a series of steps:\n\nAn external account initiates a transaction, such as sending ETH to another user. The transaction request is broadcast to the Ethereum network. Validators on the network execute the transaction and propagate the change to the entire network. A transaction fee is deducted during the validation process. The validated transaction is included in a block.\n\nThere are different types of transactions on the Ethereum network, including regular transactions (from one account to another), contract-execution transactions (interactions with deployed smart contracts), and contract-deployment transactions (deploying the code of a smart contract).\n\nAlso read: Ethereum: Users Holding 1000+ ETH, Drops to 5-Year Low\n\nTracking an Ethereum Transaction: A Step-by-Step Guide\n\nNow that we\u2019ve covered the basics, let\u2019s dive into the steps on how to check an Ethereum transaction:\n\nStep 1: Acquiring the Transaction Hash\n\nYour journey to tracking your Ethereum transaction starts with obtaining the transaction hash. This unique identifier is given to every transaction on the Ethereum network. You can find this hash in the history or activity section of the crypto wallet or exchange platform you used to conduct the transaction.\n\nStep 2: Using an Ethereum Blockchain Explorer\n\nWith your transaction hash at hand, the next step is to visit an Ethereum blockchain explorer. These are online tools that allow you to view information about transactions, blocks, and addresses on the Ethereum blockchain. Some popular Ethereum blockchain explorers include Etherscan and Etherchain.\n\nStep 3: Input the Transaction Hash\n\nOn the blockchain explorer website, you\u2019ll find a search field. Paste the transaction hash you obtained in Step 1 into this field and initiate the search. The explorer will then retrieve and display the transaction details.\n\nStep 4: Review the Transaction Details\n\nOnce you input the transaction hash, the transaction details will display. This information includes the sender and recipient addresses, the transaction amount, the gas fee paid, and the transaction\u2019s current status. You can use these details to verify if the transaction was successful.\n\nBesides blockchain explorers, several tools can help you monitor your Ethereum transactions. These tools provide real-time updates and additional features for your transactions. Some popular options include:\n\nMetamask: Metamask is a renowned Ethereum wallet and browser extension that lets you manage your Ether and interact with decentralized applications. It also provides a transaction history and notifications for your transactions.\n\nMetamask is a renowned Ethereum wallet and browser extension that lets you manage your Ether and interact with decentralized applications.
