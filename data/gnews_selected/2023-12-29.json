        "content": "Google searches for the term \u201cSolana\u201d surpassed \u201cEthereum\u201d for the first time in 2023 as traders became curious about movements within its ecosystem.\n\nWhile Ethereum had a wide lead against Solana in search interest throughout the year, the data shifted from Dec. 17 to Dec. 23, with Solana having a search interest score of 56 to Ethereum\u2019s 50.\n\nSolana search interest throughout 2023. Source: Google Trends\n\nAccording to Google Trends data, the search term Solana is set to get a score of 100 in terms of search interest from Dec. 24 to Dec. 30. Google Trends notes that a value of 100 means \u201cpeak popularity for the term.\u201d\n\nThe data also showed that Solana attracted more search interest than Ethereum in countries such as Spain and the Philippines. However, interest in Ethereum still dominated in Indonesia, Taiwan, Morocco and others.\n\nSolana search interest breakdown by region. Source: Google Trends\n\nMeanwhile, the data also showed that users who searched Solana have shown interest in search terms like \u201cbonk\u201d and \u201ctensor.\u201d Bonk is a dog-themed memecoin that flipped Pepecoin (PEPE) in market capitalization on Dec. 8, following a 370% monthly gain. On the other hand, Tensor is a Solana-based nonfungible token marketplace that created the NFT collection Tensorians, which showed massive gains in the last 30 days.\n\nRelated: Solana is up 95% in December \u2014 But why are AVAX, INJ, NEAR surging even higher?\n\nInterest in the proof-of-stake blockchain platform may have also been fueled by the recent uptick in the price of Solana\u2019s (SOL) token. On Dec. 20, SOL\u2019s market cap passed Ripple\u2019s XRP (XRP) as the token\u2019s price saw a 13.8% increase, topping $82 for the first time since May 2022 and overtaking XRP.\n\nOn Dec. 22, SOL flipped BNB (BNB), taking the spot for the fourth-largest crypto token by market capitalization. However, BNB reclaimed its spot on Dec. 29 as the SOL token returned to pre-Christmas prices.\n\nMagazine: 10 best long reads about crypto in 2023"

        "title": "Vitalik Buterin Shares New Ethereum Vision - U.Today",
        "content": "Vitalik Buterin has voiced a new vision for the Ethereum platform that seeks to address its most pressing challenges and leverage emerging technologies to reinvent Ethereum\u2019s infrastructure. Central to this vision is a renewed focus on scalability and privacy, fueled by the development of layer-2 solutions and novel privacy technologies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nButerin acknowledges probably the biggest issue on the network right now \u2013 high fees. This barrier has not only hindered widespread adoption but also skewed the network toward financial applications, as only users with significant resources can afford to transact during peak times. The proposed solution to this predicament lies in the advancement of rollups. Rollups perform transaction execution outside the main Ethereum chain (layer 1) but post transaction data to layer 1, thereby enhancing the network\u2019s capacity while retaining its security.\n\nThe advent of rollups, particularly optimistic and zero-knowledge rollups, has been a primary way of reducing fees on the network. These rollups promise to execute a large number of transactions at a fraction of the cost currently required on the main chain, potentially lowering the entry barrier for new users and diverse applications.\n\nAccount abstraction is another key component of Buterin's vision. It represents a shift in how user accounts and transactions are managed, offering a more flexible and user-friendly model that could open up new possibilities for application developers.\n\nLight clients, which have been on the backburner for some time, are now closer to fruition. Their role is crucial for enabling users to interact with the Ethereum network without running full nodes, thereby lowering the technical barriers to entry and participation.\n\nThe most groundbreaking development highlighted by Buterin is the practical application of zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs). Once considered a distant future technology, ZKPs are now increasingly developer-friendly and on the verge of consumer application. This technology could revolutionize privacy and scalability on Ethereum by allowing users to validate transactions without revealing underlying information."

        "title": "Ethereum Can Go Back to Its Cypherpunk Roots, Says Vitalik Buterin - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "The Dec. 28 blog post reiterated the core values of Ethereum, harking back to its early days when it was more \u201ccypherpunk.\u201d\n\nThe early vision of Bitcoin and Ethereum was deeply idealistic, aiming to build a more open, decentralized, and censorship-resistant internet and economy.\n\nHowever, Buterin lamented that over time, this vision faded as transaction fees rose, making applications focused on payments and speculation more dominant. The culture shifted toward \u201cdegen gamblers,\u201d he added.\n\nCypherpunk is a movement advocating the use of technology to promote privacy and social change while protecting against state or corporate oppression.\n\nEthereum Back to its Roots\n\nNevertheless, there have been signs of a culture revival in 2023 due to rollups reducing fees, advances in privacy technology like zk-proofs, and a desire to move beyond over-financialization, he said.\n\nEthereum could be a testbed for open and decentralized security innovations like social recovery wallets, prediction markets, and quadratic voting, which could later influence the broader internet.\n\nMoreover, the ideal future Web3 tech stack contains decentralized equivalents to DNS, email, payments, identities, publishing, and governance that interoperate while avoiding central points of control, said Buterin.\n\nHe concluded that many come to crypto to get rich but become decentralization converts when they realize what the technology is capable of.\n\n\u201cThere are plenty of people whose first introduction to the crypto space is the desire to get rich, but who then get acquainted with the ecosystem and become avid believers in the quest to build a more open and decentralized world.\u201d\n\nButerin has been busy blogging lately. Earlier this week, he proposed measures to reduce the load on the Ethereum blockchain by reducing the number of cryptographic signatures that validators need to produce.\n\nIn May, he warned of the dangers of stretching Ethereum\u2019s consensus past its core functions of validating blocks and securing the network.\n\nETH Price Doubles in 2023\n\nEthereum prices have perked up this week, reaching a 2023 high of $2,430 on Dec. 28. The asset has largely trailed Bitcoin and competing blockchain tokens such as Solana and Avalanche in recent months.\n\nHowever, Ethereum is the world\u2019s second-largest crypto asset and the industry standard for smart contracts. Moreover, it has doubled in price since the beginning of the year when it was trading at just $1,200.\n\nFinally, ETH prices could surge to $15,000 in the next bull market, according to analysts who have measured gains from previous cycles and projected them forward."

        "title": "Vitalik wants Ethereum to be more 'Cypherpunk' hailing the social layer as its core USP - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s co-founder Vitalik Buterin shared his insights on the evolving landscape of the crypto ecosystem on Dec. 29, mainly focusing on Ethereum\u2019s role in shaping a more open and decentralized internet in a blog post entitled \u201cMake Ethereum Cypherpunk Again.\u201d\n\nSince its inception, Ethereum has journeyed beyond being a mere extension of Bitcoin with smart contracts. Buterin recalls early memories of using Bitcoin in Berlin\u2019s Bitcoin Kiez and at PorcFest, a libertarian gathering, highlighting the intertwined nature of technological and social aspects in the crypto world. These experiences stress the broader vision of crypto: fostering a free, open society where technology, social, and economic elements harmoniously interact.\n\nThe initial concept of \u201cweb3,\u201d as coined by Ethereum\u2019s co-founder Gavin Wood, envisioned Ethereum as a fundamental component of a more open internet stack. This vision aimed to overcome the limitations of the free, open-source software movement of the 1980s and \u201990s, which did not account for modern internet applications\u2019 collaborative and centralized nature. Ethereum, along with technologies like peer-to-peer messaging and decentralized file storage, was seen as a decentralized, shared hard drive crucial for extending the spirit of open source into today\u2019s interconnected world. For Buterin, the chart below outlines the core benefits of decentralized technologies.\n\nHowever, Buterin notes a shift in focus since around 2017, with a diminished emphasis on consumer crypto payments and non-financial applications. This shift is partly attributed to rising transaction fees on the Ethereum network, which have priced out more minor, non-financial uses in favor of financial applications dominated by speculative activities. According to Buterin, this change has led to a misalignment with the original vision of Ethereum and the broader crypto space.\n\nLooking ahead to 2024, Buterin highlights several positive developments in Ethereum\u2019s technology that could steer the platform back toward its foundational principles. These include advancements in rollups, second-generation privacy solutions, account abstraction, light clients, and zero-knowledge proofs. These technologies address the challenge of scalability and embody the values of decentralization, censorship resistance, and open participation.\n\nAs part of a broader technological vision, Buterin states, Ethereum continues developing its original components and \u201csister technologies\u201d such as decentralized messaging and decentralized storage. Introducing zero-knowledge proofs adds a new dimension, enabling privacy and authentication simultaneously. For instance, Buterin notes how Zupass, a zero-knowledge-proof-based system, successfully implemented anonymous voting, demonstrating the potential of Ethereum-based technologies in achieving privacy without sacrificing security.\n\n\u201cWe can start to see the contours of what an Ethereum-y cypherpunk world would look like, at least on a pure technical level. We can be holding our assets in ETH and ERC20 tokens, as well as all kinds of NFTs, and use privacy systems based on stealth addresses and Privacy Pools technology to preserve our privacy while at the same time locking out known bad actors\u2019 ability to benefit from the same anonymity set.\u201d\n\nButerin also emphasizes Ethereum\u2019s role in developing a decentralized tech protocol stack, competing with traditional centralized systems. This stack includes banking, social media, and identity verification alternatives, highlighting Ethereum\u2019s commitment to building tools that interoperate with a broader ecosystem rather than creating isolated empires.\n\nThe social layer of Ethereum is equally crucial, according to Buterin. He acknowledges the need for a balance between incentive-driven and community-oriented approaches. Large-scale public goods funding and cooperative efforts within the Ethereum ecosystem are steps toward this balance, yet there is much room for growth and improvement.\n\n\u201cThere is a unqiue mix of valuing a warm and cohesive community, but at the same time remembering that what feels \u201cwarm and cohesive\u201d from the inside can easily feel \u201coppressive and exclusive\u201d from the outside, and valuing hard norms of neutrality, open source and censorship resistance as a way of guarding against the risks of going too far in being community-driven.\u201d\n\nUltimately, Buterin envisions Ethereum as a platform that excels technically and economically and fosters a robust and value-driven community. Buterin closes his post by stating,\n\n\u201cIf this mix can be made to work well, it will in turn be in the best possible position to realize its vision on the economic and technical level.\u201d\n\nButerin believes integrating technical innovation with social and ethical principles could potentially lead Ethereum to realize its original vision of a decentralized, open, and equitable digital world."
