        "content": "Fresh data from blockchain analytics platform, Token Terminal, shows that bitcoin had two times more daily active users than ethereum as of May 8.\n\nBitcoin flips ethereum in user count\n\nAt the time of writing, bitcoin still leads ethereum in terms of daily active users.\n\nBitcoin has an average of 589,810 daily active users over a 30-day period, while ethereum has an average of 322,840 daily active users over the same time frame.\n\nToken Terminal is a platform that aggregates financial data on leading blockchains and decentralized applications, using traditional financial key performance indicators (KPI) to measure and evaluate their performance.\n\nWhile bitcoin and ethereum are popular, they offer different use cases. To illustrate, bitcoin is a currency and a store of value, while the ethereum network is a smart contracting platform for launching decentralized applications (dApps).\n\nBlame Ordinals for bitcoin woes, ethereum strained by PEPE\n\nData from Token Terminal suggests that despite the differences in their design and intended use cases, bitcoin is currently attracting more daily active users than ethereum.\n\nThis may be due to a variety of factors, such as bitcoin\u2019s longer history and wider adoption, as well as its perception as a more stable and secure investment option.\n\nHowever, the introduction of the Bitcoin Ordinals platform and marketplace on Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain could be the main reason for the spike in user adoption.\n\nThrough the Ordinals platform, users can attach files, such as videos, images, or texts, on every satoshi, effectively storing them on the mainnet. A satoshi is the smallest unit of a bitcoin (BTC).\n\nIn recent days, there has been a spike in the number of minted inscriptions from the Ordinals platform. The deluge has overwhelmed the network, forcing transaction fees high, even causing congestion on May 7.\n\nEven so, ethereum remains a significant player and is a go-to smart contracting platform.\n\nAs the Bitcoin network is inundated by Ordinals inscriptions, the popularity of meme tokens, including pepe coin (PEPE), has also forced ethereum\u2019s gas fees higher after a lull of 2022.\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nThe Ethereum (ETH) blockchain network is giving traders enormous concerns at this time as the incidence of skyrocketing gas fees appears to be returning. According to a shared insight from crypto analytics service provider WhaleAlert, one trader paid as much as 64 ETH worth approximately $118,600 at the time of writing in fees for a single transaction.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\ud83d\udcb8 A fee of 64 #ETH (119,121 USD) has just been paid for a single transaction!https://t.co/3w4UD0AZbw \u2014 Whale Alert (@whale_alert) May 8, 2023\n\nThe high gas fee is not a new thing on the Ethereum network; however, it is notably rare since the transition from the proof-of-work (PoW) protocol to proof-of-stake (PoS) through The Merge. While not an immediate dividend, the high gas fee was one of the major considerations for transitioning the protocol to PoS. The rationale is that a different transaction validation method can help in decongesting the network effectively.\n\nWith the high gas fees being recorded at the moment, the opposite appears to be the case. The cause may be linked to the massive meme coin hype that stirred intense network activity, causing a clog during the weekend.\n\nThis network activity reached a peak when Binance exchange listed PEPE tokens as well as Floki Inu for trading on its platform. This congestion, fueled in part by panic selling by whales and the accompanying soaring prices may reduce the gains accrued by these meme coins, especially for retail traders.\n\nPlace of Layer 2 solutions\n\nThe skyrocketing price of gas fees on Ethereum contributed to the birthing of innovative Layer 2 protocols like Polygon zkEVM, Arbitrum and Optimism. While the transaction fees on these protocols are a fraction of what it costs on the main Ethereum chain, users still bypass these L2s to carry out transactions on Ethereum.\n\nThe rationale for this remains unclear, but with innovative or community-focused protocols building on Ethereum mainnet, it generally becomes quite difficult for L2s to serve the purpose for which they are designed, lowering gas fees and championing scalability."
