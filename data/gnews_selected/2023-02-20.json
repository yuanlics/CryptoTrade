        "content": "A fake website of the popular Ethereum Denver conference is the latest phishing target of a red-flagged smart contract that has stolen over $300,000 worth of Ether (ETH).\n\nThe popular conference saw its website duplicated by hackers this week in order to trick users into connecting their MetaMask wallets. According to Blockfence, which identified the fraudulent website, the smart contract has accessed more than 2,800 wallets and stolen over $300,000 over the past six months.\n\nAnother day, another scam.\n\nThis time the scammer targeted the @EthereumDenver website. Blockfence is here to protect you and fight scammers together: The scam contract was marked as \"High Risk\" by our ML algorithm and our partners at @GoplusSecurity pic.twitter.com/Jdtoz2Bgu4 \u2014 Blockfence (@blockfence_io) February 20, 2023\n\nETHDenver also issued a notice to its followers on Twitter warning of the malicious website.\n\nHello Fellow Bufficorns!!\n\n\n\nPlease be aware that there is a FAKE ETHDenver website that is asking for you to connect your wallet.\n\n\n\n\u201cGo-ETHDenver\u201d is not us. Please report the site! pic.twitter.com/1dt4hYmfvO \u2014 ETHDenver (@EthereumDenver) February 20, 2023\n\nBlockfence CEO Omri Lahav told Cointelegraph that users were prompted to connect their MetaMask wallets via the usual \u201cconnect wallet\u201d button. The website prompts a transaction that, if approved, carries out the malicious function and steals the users\u2019 funds.\n\nBlockfence\u2019s research team identified the incident while tracking different trends in the industry. Lahav said that the smart contract executing the scam had stolen over 177 ETH since its deployment midway through 2022:\n\n\u201cSince the smart contract was deployed almost six months ago, it\u2019s possible that it was used on other phishing websites.\u201d\n\nHackers had gone as far as paying for a Google advertisement to promote the malicious website\u2019s URL, banking on search trends being high, with ETHDenver taking place on Feb. 24 and 25. The fake website appeared second on a Google search, above the actual ETHDenver website.\n\nAs Cointelegraph previously reported, hacks and scams continue to be commonplace in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. 2022 saw over $2.8 billion of cryptocurrency stolen through a variety of hacks and exploits."

        "content": "Share:\n\nEthereum price shows a bullish pennant formation with a theoretical forecast of $2,055.\n\nSecond confirmation of uptrend will arrive after ETH flips breakout line at $1,801.\n\nInvalidation of ETH\u2019s bullish thesis will occur on flipping the $1,554 support level into a resistance barrier.\n\nEthereum (ETH) price shows a clear sign of consolidation around a significantly important monthly resistance level. Although ETH has flipped this hurdle into a support floor on the lower timeframes, investors need to wait for a decisive breakout from the pennant to confirm the start of the second leg.\n\nEther is at the center of popularity due to its upcoming network upgrade - the Shanghai hard fork. According to CoinStats, the smart contract token has a total market capitalization of $204 billion, and this number is only going to increase due to the bullish outlooks seen both in its fundamentals and technicals.\n\nCoinStats\n\nEthereum price prepares for its next bullish phase\n\nEthereum price rallied nearly 20% between February 13 and 23. As ETH entangled with the monthly resistance level at $1,677, the consolidation kick-started. During this sideways movement, Ether has produced two higher lows and two lower highs, denoting a pennant formation.\n\nTogether, the Ethereum price action between February 13 and 20, shows a bullish pennant formation. This setup forecasts a 20% upswing, which is obtained by measuring the distance of the initial run-up and adding it to the breakout point on the pennant.\n\nAssuming a breach of the pennant occurs around $1,720, a 20% move would put the Ethereum price target at $2,055.\n\nSupporting this optimistic outlook for Ethereum price is the hidden bullish divergence seen between the Ether price move and the Relative Strength Index (RSI). This technical formation is spotted when the price forms higher lows, but the momentum indicator produces lower lows.\n\nThis setup often leads to an explosive surge in bullish momentum that propels the underlying asset\u2019s price.\n\nWhile a decisive break of the pennant would be the initial confirmation of an upswing, market participants can wait for a four-hour candlestick close above the breakout line at $1,801.\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nAlthough the bullish outlook for Ethereum price makes logical sense, investors need to be cautious as a fatal crash in Bitcoin price would undo everything for ETH. A decisive flip of the $1,554 support level on the four-hour and the daily timeframe would invalidate the bullish thesis.\n\nSuch a development would see Ethereum price crash to the $1,329 support floor.\n\nEthereum network grows but so do scams\n\nThe number of investors holding Ethereum (ETH) grew from 25 million to 87 million in 2022. With many new upgrades to the Ethereum blockchain set to debut in 2023 and the resumption of the 2023 bull run is likely going to boost the network further. Investors can also see a swift growth in Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum and Polygon. Additionally, the implementation of the zkSnark (Zero-knowledge) technology has also brought a renewed interest among investors.\n\nIn a recent tweet, the Ethereum Denver Twitter account noted that hackers targeted their Ethereum Denver website. Soon after Blockfence tweeted and tagged this website as \"high risk.\" Interestingly, the involved bad actors have also promoted the fake ETH Denver website on Google. To make matters worse, the website appeared before the original website, which could attract a lot of unbeknownst investors.\n\nAlthough the cryptocurrency scams have decreased in recent months, scammers or hackers are finding new and improved ways to steal money."

        "content": "The price of Ethereum\u2019s native token, Ether (ETH), has surged by more than 40% year-to-date to around $1,750, the highest level in seven months. However, ETH\u2019s price is not out of the woods yet despite several bullish cues in the pipeline, such as the Shanghai upgrade.\n\nEthereum price bull trap?\n\nEther\u2019s rise aligns with similar upside moves elsewhere in the crypto market, responding to lowering inflation that reduces the Federal Reserve\u2019s likelihood of continuing to raise interest rates.\n\nAt the same time, warnings about an imminent bull trap in the markets have emerged, which may wipe out recent profits. Due to its long-term correlation with stocks and Bitcoin, Ether faces similar risks.\n\nBull Trap About to confirm on $ETH and $BTC along with shooting stars on both.

In other words, the Ethereum network has minted fewer ETH tokens than were removed from the supply in the past five months.\n\nEther supply since the Merge. Source: Ultrasound Money\n\nInvestors typically perceive a cryptocurrency with a fixed supply or deflationary issuance rate as bullish in the longer term.\n\n#Ethereum's #deflation #rate is accelerating by the day. This has very positive impact on the supply/demand dynamics, and should send the price a lot higher as demand increases. I think this is happening very soon. #ETH #ETHE pic.twitter.com/dnHVKBabuf \u2014 Jesse Dow (@JesseLeeDow1) February 16, 2023\n\nEthereum\u2019s supply is currently around 120.50 million, but there is technically no max supply. However, the London hard fork in August 2021 introduced a fee-burning mechanism that added deflationary properties to Ether\u2019s tokenomics.\n\nAs a result of this upgrade, the higher the Ethereum network\u2019s transaction fees at any given time, the more Ether will be \u201cburned\u201d or removed from the supply forever.\n\nInterestingly, Ethereum\u2019s median gas price has rebounded to a seven-month high of 27.13 gwei (the smallest ETH unit) in the week ending Feb. 17.\n\nEthereum seven-day median transaction gas price. Source: Glassnode\n\nShanghai hard fork\n\nETH demand must not drop against a deflationary supply rate for the price to climb. One potential bullish catalyst in the pipeline for Ethereum is its upcoming network upgrade dubbed Shanghai, slated for mid-March.\n\nThe Shanghai hard fork enables users who have locked their Ether into Ethereum\u2019s PoS smart contract to withdraw their assets. According to Kennan Mell, an independent market analyst, this increased liquidity could encourage more people to hold and stake Ether tokens.\n\nIn his SeekingAlpha article, Mell argues:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s possible that the successful implementation of staking withdrawals will boost Ethereum\u2019s price as new investors decide to buy in right afterward, either because they were waiting to buy until the network successfully went through a risky hard fork to implement withdrawals or because they are lured by a more liquid staking yield.\u201c\n\nMeanwhile, the total value locked in the Ethereum PoS contract continues to rise to new record highs, with the latest data showing deposits of almost 16.63 million ETH.\n\nEthereum 2.0 total value staked. Source: Glassnode\n\nCrypto staking crackdown\n\nHowever, any bullish catalysts for ETH\u2019s price could be offset by regulatory crackdowns and unfavorable technicals in the near term.\n\nIn February, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) fined crypto exchange Kraken $30 million for not registering its staking-as-a-service program, which includes Ethereum staking.\n\nRelated: Ethereum\u2019s Shanghai fork is coming, but it doesn't mean investors should dump ETH\n\nCoinbase exchange CEO Brian Armstrong also warned that the SEC might ban crypto staking services for retail investors altogether. If true, such a prohibition could hurt Ether\u2019s demand among U.S. investors.\n\nResembles poor financial advice to diversify into stocks in an economy of high FFR and inflation\n\n\n\nBut, SEC wanting to ban staking is valid\n\n\n\nMajor exchanges like #Binance can no longer offer in-app staking\n\n\n\nAND\n\n\n\nPoS protocols like #Ethereum will be subject to security laws & taxes https://t.co/1YxpVNxD0B \u2014 oracledaddy (@oracIedaddy) February 20, 2023\n\nETH price hits bearish inflection level\n\nFrom a technical perspective, Ether\u2019s price is testing a key resistance confluence for a potential pullback.\n\nThe confluence comprises a multimonth descending trendline resistance and a 50-week exponential moving average (50-week EMA; the red wave), as shown below.\n\nETH/USD weekly price chart.

        "title": "Blur Overtakes OpenSea as Ethereum NFT Trading Skyrockets - Decrypt",
        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nFollowing two straight months of sales growth, NFT trading rapidly accelerated over the past week as Ethereum NFT volume more than doubled during that span. It\u2019s due to an evolving market in which upstart marketplace Blur has overtaken leader OpenSea, with traders rapidly flipping valuable NFTs like they\u2019re DeFi tokens.\n\nAccording to data from DappRadar, Blur has generated $460 million worth of Ethereum NFT trades over the past seven days\u2014a 361% increase over the previous span. OpenSea, meanwhile, saw a 12% increase in trading volume to $107 million during that period. The third-place marketplace, X2Y2, tallied barely $11 million in trades in that time.\n\nOverall, CryptoSlam points to a 155% week-over-week increase in Ethereum NFT trading volume. The surge in volume comes during a week in which Blur airdropped its BLUR governance token to NFT traders who earned rewards through the marketplace, and also by trading elsewhere ahead of Blur\u2019s own launch last fall.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe BLUR token has a market cap of $466 million, at its current price of $1.20 per token, and it appears that at least some NFT collectors poured their airdropped funds back into buying NFTs. And they\u2019re primarily using Blur to buy and sell NFTs, as the market data shows.\n\nHowever, the surge in trading volume at Blur doesn\u2019t appear to be primarily driven by traders simply selling off their BLUR tokens and buying and holding high-value NFTs. Instead, whale traders with significant NFT holdings appear to be flipping NFTs with even greater frequency than before, in an effort to boost potential future token reward allocations.\n\nFor example, the largest NFT project (market-wide) over the past week in terms of trading volume is Otherside, Yuga Labs\u2019 upcoming metaverse game. The NFT land plots generated some $63 million in trades this past week, per CryptoSlam, marking a 318% week-over-week increase.\n\nThe largest seller during that span is the wallet of MachiBigBrother, a well-known pseudonymous NFT trader, who was involved with nearly 1,300 Otherside NFT trades yielding $4.3 million worth of sales in the process. A look at his trading activity shows a constant flood of inbound and outbound trades, and this is just one example of many.\n\nIt\u2019s facilitated by Blur\u2019s unique marketplace model, which not only broadly incentivizes heavy activity with the promise of token rewards, but specifically rewards traders for using bidding pools that enable bulk trading for NFTs.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBlur Bidding Pools have reached a new ATH of $132.65M TVL, or, around 2.4x Aptos TVL and 0.5x Solana TVL. Blur also became the #1 protocol on Ethereum by gas usage as well, surpassing both Uniswap and Seaport. \ud83d\udea8TURN NOTIFICATIONS ON\ud83d\udea8 for details about Season 2, coming soon! https://t.co/89DONJ6K8z pic.twitter.com/GCqGHDQBcq \u2014 Blur (@blur_io) February 20, 2023\n\nBlur is teasing its next \u201cSeason 2\u201d token airdrop, and specifically notes that traders that \u201cbid on top collections closer to the floor get more rewards.\u201d In other words, traders that put in a bid close to the floor price\u2014that is, the cheapest available NFT for a certain project\u2014of a popular project will maximize their eventual rewards. They\u2019re both buying and selling in bulk as a result.\n\nThat\u2019s why projects like Otherside, the Mutant Ape Yacht Club, and Moonbirds are all flying this week, and why many of the NFTs in those projects are trading hands over and over again. And MachiBigBrother, the aforementioned whale trader, currently sits at the top of Blur\u2019s Season 2 leaderboard for trading rewards.\n\nDeFi, a catch-all term for non-custodial trading and lending services, took the Ethereum space by storm in 2020 and has played a significant role in the growth of the ecosystem since. Now, through token rewards and gamification techniques, Blur has incentivized traders to treat NFTs more like DeFi tokens, flipping frequently and attempting to maximize every potential benefit through liquidity mining. Some traders have even posted guides on how best to mine Blur\u2019s token rewards without making potentially costly mistakes in the process.\n\nDeFi and NFTs are merging. Ape and ape hard. \u2014 Machi Big Brother (@machibigbrother) February 18, 2023\n\nThe NFT-meets-DeFi approach isn\u2019t entirely new. We\u2019ve seen DeFi-like implementations for NFTs in recent months, such as Sudoswap and Hadeswap embracing liquidity pools versus traditional marketplace listings, plus BendDAO using that kind of format for NFT-based loans. Other NFT-based loan protocols have risen in recent months and flourished.\n\nLast August, amid earlier debates around NFT flipping and creator royalties, Crypto Twitter personality Cobie tweeted that NFTs are \u201caltcoins with pictures.\u201d It was a controversial take then, but Blur\u2019s DeFi-like approach to NFT trading has executed that concept at a scale previously unseen\u2014and the impact has been profound.\n\nOpenSea, long the market leader in terms of trading volume, has been eclipsed by Blur\u2019s trading frenzy\u2014and as a result, OpenSea announced Friday that it has temporarily cut its own 2.5% marketplace fee, and will cut back on some creator royalty enforcement protections. This means OpenSea, in an attempt to remain competitive with Blur, is effectively going \"zero fee,\" forgoing the fees that drive its own primary source of revenue as well the fees that finance most NFT projects.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAs when OpenSea publicly considered changes to its creator royalties model last fall, many NFT artists and creators have vocally pushed back against the move. But Blur, which does not fully honor creator royalties across projects, apparently forced OpenSea\u2019s hand last week as the longtime leader attempts to adjust to a new normal.\n\nOpenSea still serves more unique wallets than Blur\u2014about 106,000 for OpenSea over the past week, with about 66,000 for Blur. But Blur has shot ahead in terms of number of transactions, along with the widening gap in trading volume.\n\nLike more exaggerated examples of wash trading, the flood of NFT flipping and rewards \u201cfarming\u201d on Blur muddles the market data\u2014and the surging trading volume from the past week doesn\u2019t suggest that the NFT market is growing and onboarding scores of new collectors. It\u2019s mostly whales trading among themselves.\n\n\u201cWe aren\u2019t growing the pie,\u201d tweeted Web3 project founder Naveen Jain. \u201cIt\u2019s the same folks circulating assets and ETH around and around.\u201d\n\nThat apparently is true, but the entire market is still forced to grapple with the shifting tides\u2014from Blur and OpenSea battling it out for market share to project creators watching their revenue streams dry up as platforms cater more to NFT flippers and pro traders."
