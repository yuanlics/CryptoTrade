        "content": "Real Vision CEO Raoul Pal says Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) technicals and fundamentals suggest the second-largest cryptocurrency may massively outperform Bitcoin (BTC) in the coming cycle.\n\nIn a new interview on the crypto-focused YouTube channel Altcoin Daily, Pal says he has his eye on the chart of Ethereum against Bitcoin (ETH/BTC).\n\nAccording to the macro guru, the ETH/BTC pair is coiling inside a wedge, and a breakout could send ETH into a rally that leaves Bitcoin in the back seat.\n\nSays Pal,\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s the chart of Ethereum versus Bitcoin. That\u2019s one hell of a wedge.\n\nIf that plays out, then we should see ETH doing 1x, 2x, 3x, 4x [or] 5x Bitcoin in the next run. And ETH probably won\u2019t be the best performing crypto either.\u201d\n\n\n\nAccording to Pal, the ETH/BTC pair must take out resistance at around 0.077 BTC ($2,115) to confirm the breakout. At time of writing, ETH/BTC is trading for 0.0639 BTC ($1,755).\n\nAs for Ethereum\u2019s fundamentals, the Real Vision executive believes that the leading smart contract platform\u2019s total addressable market is much larger than Bitcoin\u2019s.\n\n\u201cEthereum is a broader basis architectural protocol of which we can build more stuff on top of. Bitcoin just doesn\u2019t do that. It has a different use case. So it\u2019s unlikely to be as big.\n\nIs the internet worth more than gold? Yes, simple as that, and that\u2019s basically the argument here.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, Ethereum worth $1,758.\n\nI\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Disclaimer: The opinions expressed by our writers are their own and do not represent the views of U.Today. The financial and market information provided on U.Today is intended for informational purposes only. U.Today is not liable for any financial losses incurred while trading cryptocurrencies. Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nIn 2023, the total amount of destroyed Ethereum (ETH) coins has reached a staggering 66,000 ETH, worth approximately $117 million at the current price of $1,780 per coin. This significant reduction in supply is expected to alleviate some of the pressure on the second-largest digital asset in the market and make it increasingly scarce. With the present burn rate, an estimated 614,000 Ethereum will be removed from circulation annually, which, at the current price, equates to an astounding $1.09 billion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Ethereum network underwent a crucial update in August 2021, known as the London Hard Fork, which introduced the Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 1559. This proposal led to the implementation of a base fee mechanism that burns a portion of transaction fees. Since then, the Ethereum network has been steadily destroying coins, reducing the overall supply and creating deflationary pressure.\n\nThe ongoing burn has a direct impact on the Ethereum ecosystem, as it reduces the total number of coins in circulation. This reduction in supply, combined with increasing demand for the digital asset, has the potential to drive the price of Ethereum higher. The current burn rate of approximately 614,000 ETH per year further highlights the magnitude of the change brought about by EIP-1559.\n\nIt is essential to consider that the burn rate can fluctuate based on various factors, such as the number of transactions on the network and the gas fees associated with them. As Ethereum moves toward Ethereum 2.0, a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, the network is expected to become more efficient, which could impact the burn rate and its influence on the market.\n\nIn conclusion, the growing annual burn rate of Ethereum has led to a significant reduction in the overall supply of the digital asset, making it increasingly scarce. As the total amount of destroyed coins surpasses 66,000 ETH, the market dynamics are expected to evolve, with the potential for increased demand and higher prices. Investors and traders should keep a close eye on the developments in the Ethereum ecosystem and the factors influencing the burn rate, as these could play a crucial role in shaping the future of the digital asset."

        "content": "Billionaire and Ethereum (ETH) creator Vitalik Buterin is highlighting what he thinks is the best way for users to self custody their crypto.\n\nIn a new Reddit post, Buterin says that using multisigs, plus what he calls \u201cguardians\u201d or a network of trusted devices or individuals, is his preferred method of crypto security.\n\nA multisig wallet requires two or more signatures before it could confirm and process a transaction.\n\nButerin says that both he and the Ethereum Foundation use a multisig wallet to store the bulk of their crypto funds. The Ethereum creator also references \u201csocial recovery wallets,\u201d which he covered in more detail in a January 2021 blog post.\n\n\u201cMultisig wallets (eg. Gnosis Safe) are an easy and safe way to store funds, and can give you most of the key benefits of self custody \u2013 namely, your funds not being subject to disappearing because a centralized entity that seemed trustworthy turns out not to be at all \u2013 without the risks of having to be personally responsible for your entire security setup. I use a multisig wallet personally to store the bulk of my funds, as does the Ethereum Foundation.\u201d\n\nButerin says trusting other people to help secure one\u2019s coins means having a level of trust, but also allows for easier recovery of the crypto if you become compromised somehow.\n\n\u201cIt makes natural sense to have at least one guardian be a wallet on one of your own devices \u2013 it doesn\u2019t reduce decentralization to do that, and after all, it is your money. Once you go above one guardian controlled by yourself, however, you get into a tricky tradeoff: you get to trust other people less, but you\u2019re also concentrating more power into yourself, which can create a risk if you get hacked, coerced, or incapacitated or die.\n\nMy rule of thumb is that enough guardians should be controlled by other people that if you disappear, there are enough other guardians left to recover your funds. That is, you should control at least one guardian, and at most N(set of addresses) -M (trusted people) guardians. Also, each guardian should be on a separate device (laptop, phone, old phone, etc).\u201d\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "title": "Tech Report - Ethereum (ETH) and RenQ Finance (RENQ) are the 2 tokens to reach new highs in 2023. - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "The world of cryptocurrencies is constantly evolving, with new technologies and trends emerging every year. In 2023, Ethereum (ETH) and RenQ Finance (RENQ) are two tokens that are expected to reach new heights.\n\nEthereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is already a popular choice among investors due to its strong development team and widespread adoption. RenQ Finance, on the other hand, is a relatively new blockchain platform that offers unique features and advantages over other cryptocurrencies.\n\nIn this Report, we will explore why these two tokens are expected to grow in popularity and reach new highs in 2023, with a particular focus on RenQ Finance.\n\nEthereum (ETH): The King of Smart Contracts\n\nEthereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, and it has been around since 2015. It is an open-source, blockchain-based platform that enables developers to build decentralized applications (DApps) and smart contracts. Ethereum has gained widespread adoption due to its ability to execute complex smart contracts that are automated, transparent, and secure.\n\nOne of the reasons why Ethereum is expected to reach new heights in 2023 is its Ethereum 2.0 upgrade. This upgrade introduces a new consensus mechanism that makes the network more efficient and scalable. It also brings in new features like staking, which allow users to earn rewards by holding ETH tokens. Additionally, the upgrade reduces transaction fees, making it easier for users to interact with DApps on the network.\n\nRenQ Finance (RENQ): AI Meets DeFi\n\nRenQ Finance is a new token that combines AI with blockchain technology to enable decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. The platform uses machine learning algorithms to analyze market trends and make investment decisions. This unique approach to AI has gained significant attention from investors who are looking for new investment opportunities in the DeFi space.\n\nOne of the key advantages of RenQ Finance is its fast and secure network. It can process millions of transactions per second, making it ideal for DeFi applications that require quick and efficient data processing. Additionally, the platform has a limited supply of tokens, which could lead to increased value as demand increases.\n\nRenQ Finance has already raised $2.7 million in its presale, indicating a high level of interest from investors. The platform has also passed the Certik audit, which provides additional security and reliability to the token.\n\nWhy Ethereum and RenQ Finance?\n\nBoth Ethereum and RenQ Finance have unique features that make them stand out in the crowded cryptocurrency market. Ethereum\u2019s ability to execute complex smart contracts and the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade makes it an attractive investment option. RenQ Finance\u2019s AI-powered approach to DeFi and fast, secure network make it an appealing choice for investors who are looking for new opportunities in the DeFi space.\n\nMoreover, Ethereum and RenQ Finance are both backed by strong development teams, which provides confidence to investors that the tokens will continue to grow and evolve. In addition, both tokens have gained significant attention from the crypto community and have a growing user base.\n\nSummary\n\nIn 2023, experts predict that Ethereum and RenQ Finance will soar to new heights. Ethereum\u2019s capacity to handle intricate smart contracts following its upgrade and RenQ Finance\u2019s innovative AI methodology and rapid, secure network make them both appealing investment opportunities.\n\nNonetheless, it is vital to conduct thorough research and comprehend the risks before deciding to invest in any token.\n\nClick Here to Buy RenQ Finance (RENQ) Tokens.\n\nVisit the links below for more information about RenQ Finance (RENQ):\n\nWebsite: https://renq.io\n\nWhitepaper: https://renq.io/whitepaper.pdf\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "Dogetti (DETI) looks set to break into the top ranks within the cryptocurrency market, as its developers look to leverage its DAO principles to surprise existing projects like Ethereum (ETH) and Cosmos (ATOM). The DAO principle and other features empower the users, making them more involved in the platform\u2019s activities. Read on for more information on Dogetti\u2019s (DETI) new protocol and its implications for the DeFi space.\n\nEthereum \u2013 Elite Blockchain with Extensive DApps\n\nEthereum\u2019s launch in 2015 presented a more relatable platform than Bitcoin, where users could access a wide range of DeFi tools and Web3 applications for a better blockchain experience. The network has become a first stop for a complete cryptocurrency experience, given its many attractive features.\n\nEthereum (ETH) initially operated a proof of work protocol, which encouraged the mining of Ethereum tokens using different devices. The proof of work protocol is not scalable, so increased traffic on the Ethereum blockchain caused many network lags and delayed transactions. Also, its intensive energy consumption affected network charges, as users paid huge fees to complete their transactions on time.\n\nAs the trading traffic on Ethereum (ETH) increased, the developers incorporated other platforms like Polygon to help with handling transactions, particularly in the NFT sector. By 2022, they scheduled an upgrade, dubbed \u2018the Merge,\u2019 that will take Ethereum to a proof of stake protocol. The shift took place in September, and users are expecting the gas fees on Ethereum to start dropping soon.\n\nEthereum (ETH) is host to several popular NFT marketplaces, including OpenSea and EtherScan, which the ETH token directly powers. Its involvement in the NFT trade has made Ethereum the biggest NFT trade centre in the cryptocurrency market, with over $500 million in market capitalization.\n\nETH token provides fuel for the platform, and it now functions as a stake token with the latest developments. ETH is listed on Coinbase for about $1605.55.\n\nCosmos \u2013 Internet Of Blockchains\n\nCosmos (ATOM) is an independent decentralised platform that hopes to host DApps and tokens like Ethereum, Avalanche, and Solana. It aims to create a network of blockchains that will be able to interact with other blockchains in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nCosmos (ATOM) runs on a proof of stake protocol called the Byzantine Fault Tolerance protocol. The code uses a small group of validators to quicken transaction processing, which ultimately maximises energy requirements on the platform.\n\nThe protocol helps coordinate the two aspects of Cosmos\u2019s operations, the software development kits and the Cosmos Hub. The software development kits are frameworks or models for creating public domain blockchains that interact with one another and the main blockchain.\n\nOn the other hand, the Cosmos Hub is the central part of the Cosmos economy and establishes connections between the platform and other platforms in the cryptocurrency market. It features bridges that allow token transfers to Bitcoin and Ethereum networks and maintains security within the blockchain.\n\nCosmos runs using the ATOM tokens, which serve the roles of staking, voting, and fueling the platform. ATOM is listed on Coinbase for about $12.92.\n\nDogetti \u2013 NFTs and So Much More\n\nDogetti\u2019s (DETI) protocol will serve multifocal uses, as the developers have managed to compile several user-oriented features to provide users with a unique crypto journey. Top of these features is the DAO structure which will encourage more active participation from the users, contributing to increased wealth creation and longevity of the platform.\n\nA Decentralised Autonomous Organization represents a token community where the protocol upgrades and improvements are subject to approval from the community. The users have an enormous stake in the project\u2019s holdings, and so hold the deciding factor in policy-making and protocol alterations.\n\nDogetti (DETI) has earmarked 50% of the total coin supply for the presale event, giving its users a significant advantage in terms of token stake. This will promote user participation and ensure that only the user-friendly features get to the protocol at every upgrade.\n\nAnother significant feature Dogetti (DETI) will be offering its users is the NFT marketplace. Dogetti intends to keep up with contemporary DeFi trends and will allow users and developers to create and sell their NFT collections and projects on the platform. The whitepaper also promises that future upgrades will enable the NFTs to grow and breed, increasing user wealth on the network.\n\nDogetti\u2019s (DETI) presale is on and the best time to join is now.
