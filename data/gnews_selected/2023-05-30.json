        "content": "To scale Ethereum, researchers came up with a plan to make storing data from layer-2 rollups much cheaper. The first phase entails the introduction of EIP-4844 \u2014 known as proto-danksharding \u2014 to Ethereum mainnet, anticipated to happen with the Dencun upgrade by year\u2019s end.\n\nBut to do that, they needed some entropy \u2014 random data, or \u201csecrets\u201d if you will \u2014 and preferably lots of it.\n\nEIP-4844 will introduce a new \u201cblob-carrying transaction\u201d \u2014 a temporary data storage mechanism for layer-2\u2019s to pass data to Ethereum mainnet validators.\n\nBlockspace on Ethereum is at a premium, so to cut down on the requirements for verifying layer-2 data, Ethereum will use a polynomial commitment scheme known as KZG commitments, which is necessary for data availability sampling under proto-danksharding.\n\nKZG commitments, in turn, require a \u201ctrusted setup\u201d \u2014 a way to generate a common set of parameters that provers and verifiers use to function. For the setup to be trusted, there needs to be a set of random values used as inputs that nobody knows. When done improperly, it can compromise the proof system, as famously happened to Zcash in 2018.\n\nWithout getting too deep into the technical nuances of Merkle Trees and Kate proofs (the \u201cK\u201d in \u201cKZG\u201d), it\u2019s important to know just one thing:\n\nYou only need one honest participant to guarantee the validity of the trusted setup for everyone.\n\nEthereum researchers devised a way to let anyone with an Ethereum address participate, with some history of using the network required to join in. It\u2019s a goodwill gesture \u2014 you get nothing in return except for peace of mind.\n\nAs a participant, you only need to trust yourself and no one else, because each contribution contributes to the randomness of the system \u2014 effectively guaranteeing that there can be no collusion in the trusted setup. It\u2019s easy and takes just a minute of work and some waiting at ceremony.ethereum.org.\n\nWhen opened to the public on April 17, contributions were limited to Ethereum users with a lot of transaction history to cut down on the wait time. But those limits were gradually reduced such that today you can contribute with only 16 transactions.\n\nThat lowered bar is one reason why the number of total contributions has been on the up and up, recently passing 100,000 unique contributions.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t necessarily mean 100,000 individuals \u2014 one person can have more than one address \u2014 but only one contribution per address is allowed, and each one contributes a small measure of security to the rollup-centered future of Ethereum.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "The COVID-19 pandemic hit businesses and consumers with items like business closings, job cuts and layoffs. The aftershocks continue today, with higher inflation and a tight job market coming on the back end of the pandemic.\n\nThe U.S. government gave out several stimulus payments during the height of COVID to help individuals and families deal with rising costs and job losses.\n\nThose who received the stimulus checks were free to do with the money as they wished, including potentially investing it if they did not need the money for bills or savings.\n\nWhat Happened: In 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Act (CARES Act) was signed into law. Under the law, Americans received three rounds of stimulus payments. While some used the money for bills and to boost their savings, others chose to invest in stocks and cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe CARES Act paid out $1,200 to eligible adults and $500 more for those with qualifying children for its first stimulus payment.\n\nThe subsequent Tax Relief Act of 2020 paid out an additional $600 per eligible adult and up to $600 more for those with qualifying children in December 2020. The American Rescue Act of 2021 provided an additional $1,400 payment to eligible adults and up to $1,400 for those with qualifying children.\n\nHere's a look at the return a consumer would have if they put their stimulus checks ($1,200, $600 and $1,400) into leading cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin BTC/USD, Dogecoin DOGE/USD and Ethereum ETH/USD.\n\nThe hypothetical results are based on the dates of April 11, 2020; December 29, 2020; and March 12, 2021 for the stimulus checks.\n\nRelated Link: 2021 Was The Year Of Dogecoin: A Month By Month Retrospective With Top Stories\n\nStimulus Checks in Bitcoin: Investing in Bitcoin with a portion of the stimulus checks may have been a popular option for investors and people looking to store some of the payment away from the U.S. government.\n\nBitcoin traded at $6,926 on April 11, 2020, $27,370 on December 29, 2020 and $57,996 on March 12, 2021. A person who put all $3,200 from the stimulus checks into Bitcoin would have been able to purchase a total of 0.219 BTC.\n\nBased on a price of $27,719.72 for Bitcoin today, that $3,200 would now be worth $6,070.62.\n\nStimulus Checks in Dogecoin: The meme cryptocurrency known as Dogecoin gained interest and value in 2021 thanks to retail investors and vocal public supporters like Mark Cuban and Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Here\u2019s how stimulus checks in Dogecoin would have fared.\n\nDogecoin traded at $0.0020 on April 11, 2020, $0.0046 on December 29, 2020 and $0.0570 on March 12, 2021.

Based on a price of $0.07243 today, that $3,200 would now be worth $56,043.35.\n\nStimulus Checks In Ethereum: One of the fastest-growing cryptocurrencies in 2021 was Ethereum, thanks to its connection to non-fungible tokens. Here\u2019s a look at how stimulus checks invested in the second largest cryptocurrency would have fared.\n\nEthereum traded at $161.17 on April 11, 2020, $737.95 on December 29, 2020 and $1,839.50 on March 12, 2021.

Based on a price of $1,905.18 for Ethereum today, that $3,200 investment would now be worth $17,184.72 today.\n\nStimulus Check In All 3 Cryptocurrencies: A more diversified approach from an investor could have seen investments in Bitcoin, Dogecoin and Ethereum. Splitting the $3,200 into equal investments of the three cryptocurrencies on the respective stimulus payout days would have given an investor 0.0731 BTC, 251,665 DOGE and 3 ETH.
