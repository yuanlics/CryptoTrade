        "title": "Top 5 Blockchain Programming Languages for Smart Contracts - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "This article lists the top 5 blockchain programming languages for smart contracts\n\nSmart contracts are the foundation of all Web3 apps, so learning how to write them is a requirement if you want to work as a Web3 developer. Briefly stated, smart contracts are computer programs installed and run on a blockchain network, providing deterministic assurances that permit multiple parties to reach an accepted tamper-proof outcome. A smart contract platform is a blockchain that provides programming and testing services for smart contracts. It serves as a framework for dApp development. On blockchain networks, smart contracts can be created using a variety of programming languages. The top five blockchain programming languages for smart contracts are listed below:\n\n1. Solidity: Solidity is the most widely used Blockchain programming language for smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. It is a high-level language that is similar to JavaScript and is specifically designed for creating smart contracts. Solidity has a large developer community and offers many features for secure, decentralized programming.\n\n2. Vyper: Vyper is a newer blockchain programming language that was created specifically for smart contract development on the Ethereum blockchain. It is similar to Solidity but with a focus on simplicity and security. Vyper is designed to be more secure than Solidity by limiting the number of features available to developers.\n\n3. Rust: Rust is a general-purpose programming language growing in popularity for blockchain development. It is known for its security and performance features and is used to create smart contracts on several blockchain platforms, including Polkadot and Solana.\n\n4. C++: C++ is a popular programming language for creating blockchain applications, including smart contracts. It is known for its speed and efficiency and is used to create smart contracts on several blockchain platforms, including EOS and NEO.\n\n5. JavaScript: JavaScript is a widely used programming language for web development, but it can also be used to create smart contracts on some blockchain platforms, such as Ethereum. It is easy to learn and has a large developer community, making it a popular choice for blockchain developers.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) vs Blockchain - DailyCoin",
        "content": "The directed acyclic graph (DAG) vs. blockchain debate brings new life to the cryptocurrency industry. Ever since Satoshi Nakamoto first published the Bitcoin (BTC) white paper, distributed ledger technology (DLT) has exploded in popularity. Many crypto enthusiasts don\u2019t know blockchain systems aren\u2019t the only decentralized network.\n\nWhile they have plenty of similarities, DAG-based networks like Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR) and IOTA (MIOTA) work slightly differently from traditional blockchains like Ethereum (ETH).\n\nWhat is a directed acyclic graph? Are DAG networks truly better equipped to handle real-world use cases?\n\nThis article will explore the basics of DAG technology and how it stacks up against blockchain networks.\n\nWhat Is a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)?\n\nA directed acyclic graph, or DAG, is a distributed digital ledger that records transactions and stores cryptocurrency. Like a Layer 1 blockchain, some DAG networks support smart contracts and host innovative dApps and DeFi products.\n\nTo the untrained eye, using a DAG isn\u2019t very different from using a traditional blockchain. However, looking under the hood, you\u2019ll find that DAG-based networks use a slightly different data structure.\n\nHow Do Directed Acyclic Graphs Work?\n\nIn a blockchain, new blocks are validated by nodes or miners and added to the network. Nodes validate new transactions by confirming their data against the recorded history of previous transactions in the last block.\n\nIf a blockchain resembles a chain of blocks, a DAG looks more like a tree with unclosed vertices and edges. Every node in a DAG-based model can have more than one parent root, meaning multiple new transactions can be validated simultaneously. Instead of referencing only the last block, DAG nodes reference previous transactions from any node in the network.\n\nIn a directed acyclic graph, interconnected nodes build off each other and reference multiple transactions. This theoretically makes them more expansive and eases network congestion.\n\nLike traditional blockchains, nodes achieve network validation by \u2018agreeing\u2019 on the network state through consensus algorithms. Generally speaking, DAG networks use the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism due to its low energy consumption.\n\nWhich Crypto Projects Use DAG Technology?\n\nDespite being a relatively new DLT system, DAG-based networks are proving popular within the crypto market. Crypto projects like Hadera Hashgraph and Fantom (FTM) are built using DAG technology to great effect. They are supporting thousands of users within their thriving ecosystems.\n\nOther projects include IOTA, a directed acyclic graph designed to support Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications, and Nano, a decentralized payment network.\n\nDistributed Ledger Technology (DLT) Compared: DAG vs. Blockchain\n\nWhile it\u2019s important to understand how directed acyclic graphs work, most people are more interested in results. How does DAG technology fare against traditional blockchain standards?\n\nScalability\n\nDAG networks were invented to solve some of the scalability issues faced by legacy Proof-of-Work blockchains, including high transaction fees and low throughput.\n\nSpeed\n\nOn paper, a directed acyclic graph can reach consensus and process transactions faster than blockchain networks. Why? Blockchains are only able to create one new block at a time, and cannot begin producing a new block until the previous one has been completed.\n\nIn contrast, nodes in DAG-based networks can reference multiple other operators simultaneously. In Hadera Hashgraph\u2019s Gossip protocol (pictured below), nodes share information with each exponentially, meaning large amounts of data flow freely across the network quickly, helping nodes reach validation quickly.\n\nWhile this sounds great in theory, DAG-based networks like Hadera Hashgraph and Fantom still can\u2019t achieve the same transaction speeds that we see in top PoS chains like Solana (SOL) or Aptos (APT).\n\nCosts\n\nCompared with legacy traditional blockchains like Ethereum and Avalanche, DAG-based networks are more affordable. Transaction fees on Hadera Hashgraph cost as little as a fraction of a penny, while a similar transaction on Ethereum might set you back a few dollars.\n\nThe competition gets a bit tighter between Fantom and Avalanche, with both networks demanding only a few cents to process transactions. It\u2019s also important to mention that network demand plays an important role here. While Ethereum, Avalanche, and Fantom have all witnessed spikes in gas prices due to congestion, Hadera Hashgraph\u2019s scalability hasn\u2019t been truly tested yet.\n\nEnergy Efficiency\n\nIf there is an area where DAGs shine, it is their sustainability. Directed acyclic graphs typically boast low energy consumption rates, making them an ideal candidate for global adoption.\n\nTo give you an idea, the Fantom network uses between 0.000024-0.000028 kWh to process a single transaction. While it has made huge strides in reducing its environmental impact by moving to a PoS consensus, it still uses 0.03 kWh to execute a transaction.\n\nDecentralization\n\nDue to slow adoption rates, decentralization is a weakness for DAG networks. For example, the Hedera Hashgraph is governed by the Hedera Council, a central committee of 39 node operators. Compared to Ethereum, which has over 500,000 validators, you can see how easy it would be to convince a majority of validators to take over the network.\n\nAdditionally, DAG networks are less secure than their blockchain counterparts. Blockchains benefit from a \u2018global state\u2019 or a universally agreed-upon condition of the network with the creation of each new block. In a DAG, this global state is altered every time a new transaction is processed.\n\nIf communication between nodes isn\u2019t fast enough to ensure every node is referencing correct information, there are increased chances of vulnerabilities or inaccuracies.\n\nDAG Technology & The Ethereum Virtual Machine\n\nDespite the architectural differences behind the scenes, most users won\u2019t be able to tell the difference between using a DAG or a blockchain. This is due mainly to the simplicity and practicality of the Ethereum Virtual Machine.\n\nTop DAG-based networks like Fantom and Hedera are both EVM-compatible. Their smart contracts are generally written in Solidity and compatible with EVM wallets like Metamask. Thanks to the EVM, developers can easily \u2018copy and paste\u2019 Ethereum-based applications directly onto Fantom and Hedera.\n\nThe Verdict\n\nDirected acyclic graphs are fast and affordable networks far more scalable than legacy blockchains like Bitcoin or pre-merge Ethereum. However, they still face some decentralization and security issues that might discourage some users.\n\nMoreover, modern Proof-of-Stake blockchains like Solana and Aptos are theoretically more scalable than the leading DAG networks, meaning DAGs still have some work to do to compete with top Layer-1s.\n\nThat being said, blockchain technology has been in development for much longer than DAG networks. With time and resources, DAG-based networks might still overcome their current limitations and push new boundaries in distributed ledger technology.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nFrom an end-user perspective, it\u2019s almost impossible to tell whether you\u2019re using a directed acyclic graph or a blockchain. The average person doesn\u2019t care about the underlying infrastructure as long as the final product is functional and serves its purpose.\n\nWhy You Should Care\n\nDirected acyclic graphs are a creative method of building a distributed ledger. Just because blockchain is the most common and best-understood kind of DLT network, that doesn\u2019t mean that innovative new systems can\u2019t emerge and improve the industry.\n\nFAQs"
