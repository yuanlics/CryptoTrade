        "title": "$1B staked ETH withdrawn in 24hrs as round 2 begins - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "According to on-chain data, the net value of Ethereum removed from staking has surpassed $1 billion in value over the past 24 hours, yet again showcasing the network\u2019s ability to perform live network-wide updates without issue.\n\nETH withdrawals in action\n\nA total of $1.7 billion has been withdrawn since the Shanghai and Capella upgrades went live. However, as round 2 of withdrawals began, the value of Ethereum withdrawn increased. Round 1 took 4.14 days to complete as validators in the queue were processed.\n\n18,442,455 ETH is currently staked, with a value of $38.5 billion as of press time. As a result,\n\nstaked ETH makes up 15.32% of the total supply, with 33% staked with Lido.\n\nWith withdrawals now open, investors have been withdrawing their initial capital and the earned rewards. Staked Ethereum earns interest over time, and when a validator earns over 32 ETH through rewards, the excess amount does not add to their principal. Instead, it gets withdrawn automatically as a reward payment every few days.\n\nThe chart below shows the vast difference between deposits and withdrawals (rewards and principal funds) since the upgrade.\n\nRewards\n\nStaking rewards began around 15% and were put on a predefined falling curve relative to the number of validator participants until the Merge when the network took over. The current validator reward is 4.33%, including consensus rewards and transaction fees. These rewards spiked to around 5.2% in the days leading up to the upgrade but have since returned to their downward trajectory. Total staking rewards have fallen by 1.4% since the Merge last September when they jumped to 5.8% from 4.3%.\n\nIn addition to the change in deposits, withdrawals, and rewards, the average value of Ethereum staked with validators has reduced since withdrawals opened. As a result, 54.3% of stakers are now in profit with ETH around $2,000.\n\nBullish momentum\n\nUltimately, both the Shanghai and Capella upgrades appear to have been a success, as the network is processing new deposits, principal withdrawals, and reward payments without any significant issues. Furthermore, these actions are being performed on a volume of billions of dollars worth of Ethereum daily.\n\nWhile blockchain networks can certainly still be considered to be in beta in many ways, Ethereum\u2019s ability to undertake such enormous undertakings of live network upgrades without issue is highly encouraging for our burgeoning industry."

        "title": "Is Ethereum staking a potential threat to user privacy? - Cryptopolitan",
        "content": "The Ethereum staking process, which involves validators locking up a specific amount of Ether (ETH) to support the network\u2019s security and earn rewards, has come under scrutiny for its potential IP address privacy issues. Stakeholders in the Ethereum network have raised concerns that the requirement for validators to connect via an Ethereum client exposes their IP addresses, which could reveal their location and identity and pose a security risk.\n\nEthereum staking explained\n\nStaking generally entails securing a certain quantity of cryptocurrency or tokens as collateral to participate in a network and receive rewards. The level of anonymity and privacy for stakers depends on the staking mechanism and platform being used. In some instances, staking necessitates the use of a public IP address, which could disclose the staker\u2019s location and other identifying information. This raises concerns for those who prioritize privacy and wish to remain anonymous while staking.\n\nNumerous staking platforms and protocols implement measures to protect user privacy. Some employ techniques such as onion routing or encryption to obscure the staker\u2019s IP address and maintain anonymity. Additionally, certain platforms enable the use of VPNs or other privacy-oriented tools to enhance anonymity further.\n\nEthereum staking requires validators to hold a specific amount of ETH in a designated wallet to support the network\u2019s security and earn rewards. Validators are responsible for verifying transactions, proposing new blocks, and securing the network by locking up a minimum amount of ETH as collateral. While Ethereum staking provides numerous benefits to the network, it has raised concerns about IP address privacy.\n\nEvery computer participating in the Ethereum network must have a unique IP address to facilitate communication between nodes. Validators must connect to the network and perform their duties using an Ethereum client, such as Prysm, Lighthouse, or Teku. These clients utilize the validator\u2019s IP address to communicate with the network and exchange information.\n\nPrivacy at stake\n\nIP addresses, while crucial for network communication, can reveal the location and identity of the validator. Hackers or malicious actors could exploit IP addresses to launch attacks or gain unauthorized access to a validator\u2019s system. Additionally, governments or law enforcement agencies could use IP addresses to locate validators involved in illegal activities.\n\nRecent criticisms focus on Ethereum (ETH), which underwent a hard fork not long ago. An Ethereum Foundation researcher disclosed that ETH stakers\u2019 IP addresses are monitored as part of a broader metadata set, sparking privacy concerns. Consequently, individuals must research and understand the privacy implications of any staking platform or protocol they are considering using to mitigate these risks."

Polygon\u2019s zkEVM network aims to offer users unmatched security and minimal gas fees, outperforming other scaling solutions.\n\nDespite their considerable resources, Polygon Labs isn\u2019t the first crypto team to release a zero-knowledge rollup to boast EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) functionality. In fact, on-chain metrics suggest that the Polygon zkEVM is playing catch-up, falling behind other players in the Layer-2 Race.\n\nIs the Polygon zkEVM truly the future of Ethereum scalability? How is the new network different from the existing Polygon PoS network?\n\nWhat Is Polygon zkEVM?\n\nPolygon zkEVM is a Layer-2 network that combines two powerful technologies to boost blockchain scalability and security. Using zero-knowledge proofs and industry-standard Ethereum Virtual Machine, the Polygon zkEVM is touted as \u2018the next big thing.\u2019\n\nSource: Twitter\n\nThe network was brought to life in March 2023 when Vitalik Buterin signed the first transaction on the new blockchain. Inspired by Neil Armstrong, the Ethereum co-founder etched \u201cA few million constraints for man, unconstrained scalability for mankind\u201d into the Polygon zkEVM mainnet forever.\n\nHow Does Polygon zkEVM Work?\n\nTo better understand how Polygon\u2019s shiny new blockchain works, let\u2019s briefly break down its two key features.\n\nZero-knowledge validity proofs are a creative way to show someone you know sensitive information without actually revealing the content of the information itself. This provides users greater security and privacy while taking advantage of a more scalable network.\n\nSource: Polygon Labs\n\nIn the case of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, zkRollups enable a network to batch up groups and transactions and prove they\u2019re valid without revealing what the transactions actually are. These transactions are sent back to the Ethereum blockchain, where they\u2019re settled using the network\u2019s famed security.\n\nIn its most basic terms, the Ethereum Virtual Machine is essentially the operating system of the Ethereum mainnet. It allows users to write smart contracts and deploy dApps and services on-chain. By running an EVM blockchains can host Ethereum-based applications. This helps users and developers interact with the network in a familiar environment.\n\nCombining these features, the Polygon zkEVM gives users the best of both worlds. They enjoy the scalability of a Layer-2 network and EVM-equivalence, with the privacy and security of Ethereum zkr ollup technology.\n\nPolygon zkEVM vs. Polygon PoS Mainnet\n\nWhile both networks aim to scale Ethereum, their methods are slightly different.\n\nPolygon PoS is a sidechain that is EVM-compatible. It runs parallel to the Ethereum mainnet and is secured by a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism. Gas fees on the network are paid in MATIC, the native token of the Polygon ecosystem.\n\nPolygon zkEVM is a network built on top of the Ethereum blockchain. It uses zero-knowledge architecture to speed up processing times while benefitting from the security of Ethereum\u2019s consensus. Gas fees are paid in ETH, not MATIC.\n\nInstead of being EVM-compatible, the network aims to be EVM-equivalent. Let me explain what this means.\n\nAccording to Polygon Labs, the ultimate goal is not EVM compatibility. Compatible means that the network can operate within the confines of Ethereum\u2019s broader ecosystem. Existing dApps and developer toolsets can still be ported over but might require slight code changes to avoid bugs.\n\nEVM equivalence suggests that Polygon zkEVM offers users an identical environment and experience while benefitting from improved scalability. Polygon Labs argues that the best way to scale Ethereum is to become its equal rather than simply operating within its limits.\n\nPolygon zkEVM Competitors\n\nFor all its hype and excitement, Polygon is not the only crypto project exploring zkEVM networks. ZkSync actually beat Polygon Labs to market and released their mainnet a few days before the Polygon zkEVM went live.\n\nOn-chain metrics indicate that zkSync is by far the more popular network. Within two weeks of the launch of both blockchains, zkSync has attracted $72M in TVL (Total Value Locked). In contrast, the Polygon zkEVM has only accrued $1M in TVL.\n\nSource: DeFiLlama\n\nSource: DeFiLlama\n\nIn that wasn\u2019t enough, almost ten times more users have bridged over to zkSync compared to Polygon zkEVM. While zkSync is home to over 300,000 unique wallet addresses, the Polygon zkEVM mainnet beta is lagging behind with only 32,000 unique wallets.\n\nThough this could be considered a grim indicator for Polygon Labs, this staggering difference might be due to speculation around a possible zkSync token airdrop. Airdrop eligibility is often given to early supporters who bridge to new chains and provide liquidity in DeFi applications.\n\nIn any case, both zkRollups pale compared to other Ethereum scaling solutions. Optimistic rollups like Arbitrum and Optimism are clear winners in the Layer-2 adoption race, with millions of unique wallets and billions of dollars in TVL.\n\nWhat Can I Do On Polygon zkEVM?\n\nIf you\u2019re familiar with the Polygon PoS network or any other EVM blockchain, the Polygon zkEVM has similar use cases. The blockchain is used to store and transfer cryptocurrency in self-custodial accounts.\n\nThe network is also home to a variety of open-source DeFi applications like decentralized exchanges and lending platforms. NFT marketplaces are emerging, with several early collections vying for prominence in a relatively uncharted network.\n\nHow Do I Connect to Polygon zkEVM?\n\nHopping over to the Polygon zkEVM mainnet is easy and only takes 10-15 minutes. Head to the official Polygon zkEVM Bridge site and connect your Web3 wallet. The Polygon zkEVM RPC will usually automatically add and configure itself to your wallet.\n\nSource: Polygon zkEVM Bridge\n\nIf you\u2019re still struggling, head to Chainlist, search for Polygon zkEVM, and manually add the network to your wallet.\n\nRemember that the network uses ETH as a native gas token, so you\u2019ll need to bridge some Ether and keep some in reverse to pay your gas fees while you explore the network.\n\nPolygon zkEVM Pros and Cons\n\nLaunching an exciting new blockchain network always comes with overwhelming claims of \u2018revolutionary, new paradigms\u2019 and \u2018game-changing technology.\u2019 Let\u2019s cut through the noise and look at the facts.\n\nPros\n\nSolid reputation \u2013 Polygon Labs is one of the most reliable teams in the blockchain industry with a history of delivering high-quality products. They\u2019ve secured partnerships with some of the world\u2019s largest companies, like Starbucks and Meta,, and helped incubate hundreds of emerging crypto projects through ecosystem grants.\n\nEVM-equivalence \u2013 The network is EVM-equivalent, making it an ideal environment for users and developers to bridge over from Ethereum, the most popular Layer-1 blockchain.\n\nScalability \u2013 The zkEVM promises high transaction throughput and minuscule gas fees. According to Quicknode, users should enjoy transaction finality in 2-3 seconds and transaction costs of around $0.000084.\n\nZero-knowledge proofs \u2013 Zkproofs bring greater security and privacy to blockchain. Being able to validate transactions without needing to disclose sensitive details about the transaction opens many doors in decentralized finance.\n\nCons\n\nLow adoption rates \u2013 The launch of the Polygon zkEVM was a hotly anticipated catalyst for the Polygon ecosystem. However, the lack of users has arguably been anticlimactic. Polygon Labs needs to find some way of incentivizing network use.\n\nCompetitive niche \u2013 Ethereum scaling is one of the biggest pain points in the industry. Alternative zkEVM networks like zkSync dominate Polygon zkEVM regarding user adoption, while optimistic rollups like Arbitrum and Optimism are light-years ahead.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nAll the excitement and discussion shouldn\u2019t detract from what is arguably the largest service in the Polygon Labs ecosystem. The Polygon PoS sidechain is still one of the industry\u2019s largest networks, driving mass adoption through incredible partnerships with top Web2 companies.\n\nWhy You Should Care\n\nZero-knowledge validity proofs are certainly an innovative use of blockchain technology. The competition between Ethereum scaling solutions might be stiff. Still, Polygon Labs has a history of success, and despite a slow start, their zkEVM is expected to host exciting new applications in the Web 3 world.\n\nFAQs"
