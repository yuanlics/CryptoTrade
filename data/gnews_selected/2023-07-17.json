        "content": "Ethena, a crypto start-up, has achieved a significant milestone by securing an impressive $6 million in seed funding, according to a report from Axios. The funding round, led by prominent investment firm Dragonfly, demonstrates growing interest in Ethena's cutting-edge stablecoin project.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThus, in response to the challenges faced by previous stablecoin ventures, the start-up has developed a unique approach to ensuring its stablecoin, known as USDe, maintains a stable value relative to the U.S. dollar. By employing Ethereum derivatives and a hedging mechanism, Ethena aims to ensure that the value of USDe remains pegged to the dollar.\n\nThe difference\n\nThe key to this solution lies in the innovative use of collateral from users, allowing the platform to effectively hedge price exposure through shorting Ethereum via perpetual swaps. Through a balanced combination of staked ETH and derivatives, Ethena aims to neutralize any potential gains or losses, safeguarding the stability of USDe.\n\nThe start-up wants to distinguish itself from previous attempts at algorithmic stablecoins, such as the infamous Terra Luna. Moreover, Ethena's approach sets it apart from current stablecoin leaders USDC and USDT, which predominantly rely on traditional fiat-based assets like bills and bonds.\n\nThe success of Ethena's funding round is further amplified by the support it has garnered from prominent players in the cryptocurrency industry. Notable investors include big crypto exchanges and, additionally, Arthur Hayes. The founder of BitMEX and his family office have provided crucial backing to the project. This is especially noteworthy since Hayes himself has advocated for the development of an algorithmic stablecoin backed by Bitcoin derivatives, known as NakaDollar."

        "content": "The primary architect of the Celo blockchain, cLabs, plans to \u201creturn home\u201d as an Ethereum layer-2 network using the Optimism stack.\n\ncLabs said the decision had come after months of research and initial discussions with stakeholders, alongside technical development in rollups. The team announced it Saturday during the Ethereum Community Conference in Paris.\n\n\u201cIt has become a viable path by which to allow Celo to align even more closely with Ethereum \u2014 by connecting trustlessly with it and leveraging its economic security,\u201d cLabs said.\n\nIn an optimistic rollup, transactions are first processed off-chain and considered valid even before they\u2019re settled on Ethereum mainnet, a process which happens in batches \u2014 hence the term \u201coptimistic.\u201d\n\ncLabs is also planning to incorporate EigenDA, a data availability layer sourced from re-staking project EigenLayer. The move would aim to reduce network storage expenses.\n\nThe team intends to design a decentralized sequencer for use by Celo\u2019s existing validators. The network\u2019s native token would still be used for governance. CELO, which started out on Ethereum as an ERC-20, has jumped 11% today to a $300 million market cap.\n\nCelo has lost about half of its market cap over the past year\n\nDetailed in the project\u2019s governance forum, Berlin-headquartered cLabs said adopting a rollup model for Celo could help the network grow.\n\nCelo mainnet, which is EVM-compatible, launched on Earth Day in 2020 \u2014 around two and a half years before Ethereum ditched proof of work for the less energy-intensive proof of stake. Celo says it\u2019s carbon negative via an offset program with Wren, a subscription startup for reducing carbon footprints.\n\nThe upgrade will eventually come as a hard fork, the team said. End users shouldn\u2019t notice if everything goes well. Transaction fees should remain consistent with no big changes for existing dApps, mobile-first features or its regenerative finance stack.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nzkSync is taking yet another step to decentralize.\n\nNamed after a mythical creature found in Lewis Carroll\u2019s poem \u2018The Hunting of the Snark,\u2019 the team behind zkSync has launched the latest upgrade to the speedy layer-2 network.\n\nThe launch is in so-called mainnet shadow mode, per the team, as part of the launch's phased rollout. This mode is a testing zone that runs in parallel to the mainnet.\n\nzkSync is a novel scaling solution for Ethereum and one of the few that use zero-knowledge (zk) rollups to do so. Rollups come in two varieties: zk and optimistic. Both batch transactions off of the mainnet, roll them up into even smaller bundles, then those bundles are compressed into a proof, and settled on Ethereum.\n\nPart of that process involves a prover. This piece of technology is what does the compressing and packing of all those transactions. It's the cryptographic equivalent of a trash compactor, except it's not trash but potentially thousands of dollars in crypto activity.\n\nGiven the high computing power needed to generate those proofs, however, the barrier for users to participate is quite high.\n\nThe latest upgrade will address precisely this.\n\nCalled Boojum, which, per Carroll, is the most dangerous variety of Snark (itself a fictionalized creature), the tech will lower the hardware barrier to help secure zkSync.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe new prover can be operated with as little as 8 gigabytes of hardware, whereas the average prover demands roughly 500 gigabytes on average, said zkSync CEO Alex Gluchowski.\n\n\u201cSo far, we've seen the benchmark competitors indicating something like north of 500 gigabytes of RAM for a prover,\u201d he told Decrypt. \u201cAnd as you can only run it on the cloud, it's not ready for this [wide adoption]. Our prover requires only eight gigabytes of GPU RAM and it can run on GPUs that are compatible with gaming computers.\u201d\n\nAlong with lowering the hardware demands, Boojum is also doing all its transaction compressing for much cheaper, too. Cutting costs here is crucial, even if it's only pennies.\n\n\u201cJust because a single transaction costs $1 to produce, or even 10 cents, or even less than that, getting through hundreds of thousands of transactions per second would mean massive expanding, and you will probably not have enough of the hardware in the vulnerable clusters to produce and sustain this load,\u201d said Gluchowski.\n\nInstead of several large data centers supporting a blockchain network, especially one executing such taxing computations as generating cryptographic proofs, the upgraded prover will make it accessible to anyone.\n\nJust like miners on Bitcoin and validators on Ethereum are paid for securing their networks, so too would provers on zkSync, he said.\n\nThe zkSync CEO even argued that it could be a viable way to repurpose the mining industry.\n\n\u201cI personally don't think the proof of work will be a sustainable source of business,\u201d he told Decrypt. \u201cThey will have to shift to something that actually provides normally redundant value, not like waste kind of work. Actually like doing some useful work.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWith this step in the decentralization step executed, Gluchowski said that the next step is to decentralize zkSync\u2019s sequencer. This piece of a blockchain is responsible for ordering transactions in each block.\n\nExecuting this step also suggests a token launch in the future, he told Decrypt.\n\n\u201cWhen you decentralized the sequencer, you will need some way to permissionlessly verify transactions,\u201d said Gluchowski."
