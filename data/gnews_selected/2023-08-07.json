        "content": "PayPal is rolling out a new dollar-backed stablecoin.\n\nThe stablecoin, issued by Paxos Trust Co, was detailed in a statement published Monday morning by the American payments giant.\n\nPayPal announced that customers who purchase PayPal USD will be able to transfer the stablecoin between \u201ccompatible external wallets\u201d and PayPal. They will also be able to fund purchases with PayPal USD.\n\nThe stablecoin will be available starting Monday, and PayPal customers will be able to purchase, send, convert and fund purchases in the \u201ccoming weeks.\u201d\n\nThe announcement marks the first time that a major US financial company has created a stablecoin. PayPal\u2019s leadership confirmed the existence of the project in early 2022. PayPal began integrating crypto services in early 2021, allowing users to buy, sell and hold major digital assets like bitcoin and ether.\n\n\u201cThe shift toward digital currencies requires a stable instrument that is both digitally native and easily connected to fiat currency like the U.S. dollar,\u201d said Dan Schulman, PayPal\u2019s president and CEO.\n\nPaxos will be in charge of publishing a monthly Reserve Report on the stablecoin, as well as an \u201cattestation of the value of PayPal USD reserve assets.\u201d PayPal said the stablecoin will be \u201cfully backed by U.S. dollar deposits, US Treasuries and similar cash equivalents.\u201d\n\n\u201cPayPal USD is the most significant leap forward for digital assets and the financial industry and Paxos is proud to enable this transformative product,\u201d Paxos CEO Charles Cascarilla said in a statement.\n\nA blockchain-based digital asset, PayPal USD will be issued on Ethereum as an ERC-20 token.\n\n\u201cOur commitment to responsible innovation and compliance, and our track record delivering new experiences to our customers, provides the foundation necessary to contribute to the growth of digital payments through PayPal USD,\u201d said Schulman.\n\n\u201cClear regulations and robust consumer protections are essential to enabling stablecoins to achieve their full potential. That\u2019s why it\u2019s more important than ever that Congress enact legislation to provide comprehensive digital asset regulation, especially for stablecoins,\u201d chair of the House Financial Services Committee Patrick McHenry said in a statement.\n\nThis announcement comes a few months after PayPal enabled crypto purchases for Venmo users.\n\nUpdated Aug. 7, 2023 at 11:40 am ET: Added statement from House Financial Services Committee Chair Patrick McHenry.\n\nUpdated Aug. 7, 2023 at 9:45 am ET: Added statement from Paxos CEO Charles Cascarilla.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "Ethereum Whale Burns 2,500 ETH; Crypto Community Questions Motive - ZyCrypto",
        "content": "Advertisement\n\nAn anonymous individual using the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) pseudonym \u201cnd4.eth\u201d recently sent a substantial 2,500 ETH, equating to roughly $4.5 million, to a burn address. This incident, which transpired on July 26, has captivated the cryptocurrency community, prompting many to ponder the rationale behind this significant burn.\n\nThe occurrence came to light on August 6 when \u201cdegeneratewisdom\u201d, a blockchain analyst, tweeted the query: \u201cCan anyone on here explain this tx to me Looks like nd4.eth sent 2500 ETH to a dead address. Doesn\u2019t look like a noob error either. Thoughts?\u201d\n\nThis tweet thrust nd4.eth\u2019s substantial 2500 ETH transfer to an inactive address into the spotlight, prompting speculation within the crypto community about the underlying intention behind this deliberate and seemingly calculated move.\n\nThe concept of \u201cburning\u201d tokens entails sending tokens to an address where they are rendered permanently unspendable, thereby diminishing the overall supply of the specific cryptocurrency. However, the reasoning behind nd4.eth\u2019s decision to annihilate such a sizable sum of Ethereum remains veiled in obscurity.\n\nLaurence Day, the innovator behind the Wildcat Protocol, infused an element of humour into the situation, tweeting, \u201cIf you didn\u2019t arise this morning and express gratitude to nd4.eth for contributing to the ultrasound money narrative, I urge you to engage in profound introspection regarding your objectives.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDelving deeper into the incident, analysts from the on-chain analysis company Lookonchain disclosed additional particulars about the persona behind nd4.eth.\n\n\u201cThe guy who transferred 2,500 $ETH($4.58M) to a dead address on July 26th is a whale with 34,287 $GMX($1.84M) and 311,003 $GNS($1.43M). He spent 5,330 $DAI to buy $GMX and $GNS on July 29 and also transferred 34.9 $GMX ($1,989) and 600 $GNX ($2,733) to the dead address,\u201d Lookonchain wrote on Monday.\n\nWhile the exact motives of the address owner are still unknown, accidentally sending crypto or NFTs to a burn address has occurred before, albeit occasionally. Last March, an NFT collector called Brandon Riley accidentally sent his CryptoPunk #685, purchased for 77 ETH ($129,437), to a burn address while attempting to wrap it for trading on NFTfi. The irreversible error wiped out a third of Riley\u2019s net worth. Although unrecoverable, Riley\u2019s CryptoPunk was \u201cresurrected\u201d as a Bitcoin ordinal on the blockchain.\n\nLast September, cryptocurrency exchange Kucoin accidentally sent a substantial amount of Ethereum (ETH), valued at tens of millions of dollars, to the Ethereum burn address. This unexpected move, spanning over three days and involving more than 3,500 USDT and ETH transactions, left the cryptocurrency community puzzled with the exact motive behind this burn remaining unknown."
