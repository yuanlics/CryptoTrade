        "content": "Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of the Ethereum (ETH) network, has sold his remaining stake of MakerDAO tokens.\n\nOnchain data from Etherscan, shared by Lookonchain, shows that Buterin sold 500 MKR tokens, which he had held for the last two years.\n\nThe sale, made through CoW Protocol, netted Buterin a total of 353 ETH, which is approximately $580,000 at current rates.\n\nButerin initially invested in MakerDAO in April 2018, purchasing 1071 MKR tokens at $905 each. His recent sale implies a gain of about 27%. The Ethereum co-founder\u2019s last interaction with his MKR tokens was in April 2021, when he donated 100 tokens to India\u2019s Covid relief fund.\n\nHis action follows a Sept. 1 blog entry by Rune Christensen, MakerDAO\u2019s co-founder and CEO. In the post, Christensen detailed ambitious plans for a new iteration of the project on a different blockchain, tentatively named NewChain.\n\nThe last phase of Endgame is the launch of a native blockchain for Maker with the codename NewChain\n\n\n\nIt will make the ecosystem more secure and efficient\n\n\n\nAfter some research, I believe the Solana codebase should be considered as the basis for NewChainhttps://t.co/KyGxBBGlVH \u2014 Rune (@RuneKek) September 1, 2023\n\nYou might also like: Vitalik Buterin throws shade at XRP centralization\n\nMakerDAO may move to Solana\n\nAccording to the MakerDAO frontman, the proposed blockchain could potentially be a fork of Solana (SOL), which is a significant development, especially considering MakerDAO\u2019s current roots in Ethereum.\n\nIn the blog, Christensen explained that his choice to potentially explore Solana is driven by three key reasons. He cited the technical quality and enhancement of the Solana codebase, the ability to outlast hardships displayed by Solana following the collapse of FTX, and the success stories of previous Solana forks, such as the Pyth Network, which runs an adapted version of Solana as its backend.\n\nChristensen envisions a future where NewChain serves as a secure conduit between Ethereum and Solana. However, he did not limit his options to Solana. He also name-dropped Aptos, Sui, and Cosmos as alternatives.\n\nThe main benefits of Cosmos were its \u201clarge and high quality\u201d pool of talent, as well as its wide range of independent developers, Christensen said.\n\nRead more: Solana Pay partners with Shopify to enable USDC payments\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "content": "Solana (SOL) founder Anatoly Yakovenko has taken to the X social media platform, formerly known as Twitter to warn his community members against hurling hate statements and attacks on Ethereum (ETH). MakerDAO Co-founder and Chief Executive Officer Rune Christensen had to also take the same action.\n\nMakerDAO CEO on Solana Blockchain\n\nIt all started after Christensen announced plans to re-implement MakerDAO on a new blockchain identified as NewChain. According to the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) giant, this blockchain could be forked from the Solana (SOL) blockchain. In effect, this would mean that MakerDAO will be moving away from the Ethereum-based architecture which it currently utilizes.\n\nadvertisement\n\nExplaining further, the MakerDAO CEO claimed that the Solana codebase is the \u201cmost promising\u201d to explore for NewChain due to its technical quality and optimization, resilience of the Solana ecosystem following the \u201cFTX blowup,\u201d and past examples of successful forks of the protocol, like the Pyth Network.\n\nIn response to this potential development, Yakovenko acknowledged that MakerDAO\u2019s move is impressive, citing that it is a win for open source. At the same time, he warned that it should not be perceived as an endorsement of one blockchain over the other.\n\n\u201cI really hope that people in the Solana community don\u2019t use this as some cudgel to attack Ethereum,\u201d Yakovenko said in a recent post. He even advocated for Ethereum noting that the protocol is \u201cawesome.\u201d\n\nEthereum is awesome. Solana wasn\u2019t built in a vacuum, and tons and tons of things that make @solana special were built based on ethereum\u2019s r&d. \u2014 toly \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@aeyakovenko) September 3, 2023\n\nCrypto Leaders Advocate Collaborative Efforts\n\nUnlike the narrative that is being peddled by some community members, Christensen is confident that in the future, NewChain would serve as a bridge between Ethereum and Solana. He also shared that in the long run, this will provide \u201ca useful boost to the network effect of the entire multichain economy.\u201d\n\nHe went on to acknowledge Cosmos as a close alternative to the NewChain codebase.\n\nPaying close attention to Christensen\u2019s tweet, one would see that he was clearly appreciating multiple blockchains including Ethereum, Solana and Cosmos.\n\n\u201cAll chains are increasingly interconnected and synergize to form a global multichain network economy.\u201d\n\nHowever, enthusiastic community members seem to have taken him out of context and ultimately, it looks like crypto industry leaders are beginning to get more interested in collaborative technological advancements, rather than encourage rivalry."

He claimed that he had not \u201cseen any mocking\u201d of Ethereum.\n\nAs he told Decrypt, \u201cChristensen\u2019s backing is an important validation [for Solana] coming from one of the strongest projects in the ecosystem.\u201d\n\nBarrios said he agrees with Yakovenko\u2019s peace-keeping efforts, adding that \u201ctribalism is the worst we can do in innovation,\u201d and that \u201cEthereum and Solana are simply two different roads.\u201d\n\nNot to be sidelined by the possible reignition of rivalry, MakerDAO\u2019s Christensen also heeded Yakovenko\u2019s words of warning.\n\n\u201cEthereum is great, Solana is great. Cosmos is great,\u201d he posted on Saturday.\n\n\u201cAll chains are increasingly interconnected and synergize to form a global multi chain network economy,\u201d he wrote, concluding that \u201cTribalist incels (of every flavor) are in the wrong decade\u2014go back to Bitcoin and let the rest of us build.\""

        "title": "What Is Optimism Crypto? - DailyCoin",
        "content": "What is Optimism? Is it an innate sense of positivity; a belief that everything will turn out for the best?\n\nTo ordinary people, yes. That\u2019s exactly what it is. For crypto enthusiasts, on the other hand, Optimism is something quite different.\n\nOptimism is an Ethereum Layer-2 scaling solution that aims to make Vitalik Buterin\u2019s blockchain faster, affordable, and ultimately more accessible. As the Ethereum blockchain has grown in popularity and usage, it\u2019s become clear that the network\u2019s sluggish speeds and extortionate gas fees are ill-equipped for crypto mass adoption.\n\nWhat is Optimism (OP), and how does it work? In a crowded niche, what separates Optimism from the dozens of other Layer-2 blockchains like Arbitrum (ARB) or Polygon zkEVM?\n\nWhat is Optimism (OP)?\n\nOptimism, known by its native token symbol OP, is one of the Ethereum network\u2019s leading Layer-2 scaling solutions. It resolves the litany of issues plaguing the Ethereum blockchain, namely scalability and high transaction fees.\n\nThe Optimism project is spearheaded by the Optimism Foundation, a passionate team of developers and decentralization enthusiasts dedicated to improving Ethereum (ETH) and ensuring its long-term growth and sustainability. The foundation\u2019s work has given birth to one of the most promising Layer-2 solutions, with Optimism going from strength to strength since its launch.\n\nHow Does Optimism Work?\n\nCreatively named, Optimism is what crypto people call an Optimistic Rollup. In simple terms, Optimistic rollups are a method of batching groups of Layer-2 blockchain transaction data into one \u2018rolled up\u2019 transaction that can then be secured on the Ethereum mainnet, a Layer-1.\n\nProcessing transactions off-chain significantly reduces the load on the main network, meaning that Layer-2 users can enjoy all of Ethereum\u2019s functionality without suffering its low speeds and crippling gas fees.\n\nA sequencer handles optimism block production. The sequencer is responsible for instant transaction confirmations and blockchain state updates, constructing and executing Layer-2 blocks, and submitting user transactions to Layer-1.\n\nWhy are they called Optimistic rollups, you ask? When it comes to blockchain security, Optimism operates on the principle of \u2018fault proofs.\u2019 This means that node operators operate on the \u2018optimistic\u2019 approach that the state of the blockchain is correct, secure, and doesn\u2019t require proof of validity. It is removed and replaced if this state is challenged and found faulty.\n\nAs is always the case among Layer-2s, Optimism runs an EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine). This makes it easy for Ethereum developers to redeploy their favorite EVM-based dApps and smart contracts directly on Optimism and gives users a sense of familiarity with the network.\n\nThe Optimism Token\n\nAt the heart of Optimism is the OP token, the native cryptocurrency token of the network. OP is an ERC-20 token that plays a crucial role in the governance and future development of the Optimism network, serving as the requirement for OP community members to join and contribute to decision-making processes. It may come as a surprise, but OP is not used to pay Optimism gas fees.\n\nOne of the largest crypto airdrops to date, the OP token was distributed to hundreds of thousands of Optimism wallets. Those lucky qualifying addresses were people who\u2019d positively contributed to Optimism\u2019s growth, whether they were DAO voters, multi-sig signers, or simple users who interacted with Optimism dApps.\n\nOP\u2019s first airdrop shared over 200M OP tokens and marked the birth of Optimism\u2019s governance model, known as the Optimism Collective. This governing body collective comprises two separate houses: The Token House and the Citizens\u2019 House.\n\nComprised of OP token holders, The Token House handles protocol governance. Through decentralized governance proposals, the Token House manages everything from protocol upgrades to inflation adjustments, treasury appropriations, rights protection, and governance fund grants.\n\nOn the other hand, the Citizens\u2019 House is an experimental attempt at a non-plutocratic governance model, which aims to draw power and influence away from crypto whales. The Citizen\u2019s House manages retroactive public goods funding, which rewards builders and developers who create products and services that grow the Optimism ecosystem.\n\nOptimism Ecosystem\n\nAs you\u2019d expect from a top Layer-2 network, the Optimism ecosystem is a vibrant and dynamic space with an excellent variety of dApps. Thanks to roll-up technology, Optimism is paving the way for a new era of Ethereum-based applications that are faster, cheaper, and more efficient than what\u2019s available on the mainnet.\n\nDeFi\n\nDecentralized Finance, or DeFi, is undoubtedly one of the most transformative applications of blockchain technology. Optimism\u2019s EVM compatibility and low fees have made it the perfect playground for creative DeFi applications.\n\nClassic decentralized exchanges like Uniswap and Sushiswap have both moved in and set up camp on Optimism, but they\u2019re outclassed in TVL (Total Value Locked) and trading volume by Velodrome, Optimism\u2019s native DEX.\n\nOther DeFi platforms on Optimism can offer financial services like lending, borrowing, and yield farming through popular platforms like AAVE and Optimism\u2019s dedicated lending market, Sonne Finance. Synthetix (SNX), another popular application on the network, supports derivatives and synthetic asset trading.\n\nNFTs\n\nWhile Optimism DeFi is a force to be reckoned with, NFTs on the network have struggled to stay relevant. What\u2019s more interesting is that this trend is consistent across all Layer-2 networks, not just Optimism.\n\nEven though Layer-2 networks, whether they\u2019re optimistic rollups or zk-rollups (zero-knowledge), make it cheaper and easier to trade and mint NFTs, NFT culture still resides largely on Layer-1 networks like Ethereum and Solana (SOL).\n\nDespite iconic NFT marketplaces like Opensea integrating support for Optimism, NFT trading volume is almost non-existent.\n\nA quick look at the top collections page on Quix, Optimism\u2019s top NFT marketplace, shows that the last week of trading volume barely tips over 0.1 ETH. Opensea doesn\u2019t fare much better, with the world\u2019s most recognizable NFT platform tipping the scales at around two ETH per week.\n\nThe Optimism Superchain\n\nTo expand Ethereum\u2019s capabilities further than we\u2019ve ever thought possible, Optimism has set out to build a horizontally scalable network of blockchains called the Optimism Superchain. With the vision of growing a wider network of standardized, open-source Layer-2 networks, the Superchain tackles Ethereum\u2019s scalability crisis from a new angle.\n\nThe central engine of the Superchain is the OP Stack, an open-source development toolkit that unifies all Superchain networks and ensures they\u2019re all beating to the same rhythm. It guarantees that all networks are built using the same security features and communication systems to maintain a cohesive ecosystem.\n\nMoreover, the Superchain introduces a new revenue model that rewards developers with fees from their respective chains and applications. Optimism\u2019s Superchain has proven a popular choice for large-scale businesses, including Worldcoin (WLD) and Coinbase\u2019s Base Chain.\n\nOptimism vs. Arbitrum\n\nTwo names reign supreme in the fierce and competitive race to become the ultimate Ethereum scaling solution. At face value, there\u2019s not a huge difference between Optimism and Arbitrum. Both networks are optimistic rollups that improve Ethereum\u2019s scalability.\n\nUnderneath the hood, the main difference is how they handle fraud proofing. While Optimism uses single-round fraud proofs, Arbitrum takes this one step further with multi-round proofs. The result? Optimism is a faster network, but it runs the risk of having higher gas fees than Arbitrum during periods of Ethereum congestion.\n\nDiving into the on-chain metrics, Arbitrum is king in the eye of DeFi users. According to DeFiLlama, Arbitrum has more than double Optimism\u2019s TVL (Total Value Locked) and almost 3x as many protocols built on the network. But if you\u2019re an Optimism fan, don\u2019t lose heart.\n\nRecent trends indicate a change in the guard. Over the past few months, daily transactions and active addresses on Arbitrum have steadily declined, while the same metrics on Optimism show sustained growth.\n\nOptimism Pros and Cons\n\nShould we be feeling optimistic or pessimistic about Optimism? Let\u2019s dive into the pros and cons.\n\nPros\n\nScalability \u2013 Optimism offers greater transaction speeds and throughput than the Ethereum mainnet, making it better suited to supporting a large user base.\n\n\u2013 Optimism offers greater transaction speeds and throughput than the Ethereum mainnet, making it better suited to supporting a large user base.

Competition \u2013 Optimism faces stiff competition from other Layer 2 solutions, such as Arbitrum and zkSync. The network\u2019s success depends not only on its own merits but also on how it stacks up against its rivals.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nOptimism is just one Layer-2 provider among a sea of competitors. Dozens of Layer-2 networks are joining the race, some with greater resources and more modern infrastructure. While Optimism was one of the first Layer-2s to hit the market, there is a chance its competitors will outperform it.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nEthereum is undeniably the largest Layer-1 blockchain in the industry. However, its scalability concerns make it unusable for most of the global population. Optimism resolves these problems while retaining a focus on decentralization that Ethereum can be proud of.\n\nFAQs"
