        "content": "On the Cosmos-based EVM chain Evmos, Cosmos transactions and Ethereum transactions have been operating under different standards, leading to complications as these two types of transactions struggle to decode each other effectively.\n\nEvmos plans to relieve this technical headache by only supporting Ethereum-formatted transactions by 2024 Q3, it announced in a blog post Tuesday. Despite this strategic shift, the protocol emphasized that Evmos is not exiting the Cosmos ecosystem. Additionally, Evmos\u2019 founder suggested that the move could help bring Ethereum developers to the IBC.\n\nEvmos functions as an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible blockchain that integrates the Cosmos IBC protocol, allowing it to operate as an EVM within the Cosmos network. Evmos raised $27 million via token sale in late 2022.\n\nRead more: Uniting the blockchain ecosystems: Q&A with Cosmos founder Ethan Buchman\n\nThe project\u2019s co-founder Federico Kunze K\u00fcllmer said that by only supporting Ethereum transactions, Evmos hopes to make it easier for Ethereum developers to start working in Cosmos.\n\n\u201cThe wallets and the tools that they are already used to on Ethereum do not work easily on Cosmos,\u201d K\u00fcllmer said. \u201cWe want to make it very easy for the developers and users that are already interacting with Ethereum wallets to interact with any Cosmos application specific blockchain.\u201d\n\nThe Interchain Foundation, a non-profit focused on Cosmos adoption, made onboarding Ethereum developers a large part of its 2024 roadmap, Blockworks previously reported.\n\nIn the lead-up to fully embracing Ethereum-formatted transactions by Q3 2024, the protocol has committed to burning all Cosmos transaction fees during this interim period. This action will effectively remove these fees from circulation, signaling a shift towards revised token economics for the EVMOS token. K\u00fcllmer indicated that further details on the new tokenomics will be unveiled next week.\n\nEvmos (EVMOS) was worth around $0.07 at the time of publication.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "Study lowers Ethereum price expectation for next 7 years - crypto.news",
        "content": "Cryptocurrency experts have lowered their predictions for Ethereum (ETH), over the next few years, according to a new survey from Finder.\n\nThe survey asked 31 industry specialists for their ether price forecasts for the end of 2023, 2025 and 2030. The average predictions were down compared to a previous Finder survey conducted in July 2022.\n\nThe panel predicted Ether will be worth $1,840 on average by the end of 2023, down from a prediction of $2,451 in July. The 2025 forecast fell to $5,824 from $5,845 previously, and the 2030 prediction declined to $14,411 versus $16,414 in the earlier survey.\n\nFinder calculates the average forecasts by removing the top and bottom 10% of responses and taking the mean of the rest, a technique known as the truncated mean. This is designed to eliminate outliers and arrive at a more consistent consensus.\n\nYou might also like: Investor optimism fuels meme coins growth: predictions and market analysis\n\nWhile still bullish long term, some panelists cited near-term economic challenges and competition from other blockchains as reasons for tempered short-term expectations.\n\nETH has a huge growth potential. [\u2026] Growth is [currently] limited by high rates in TradFi. In [the] case of reaching a soft landing by US authorities, ETH[\u2018s] price will increase dramatically, but not until the middle of next year. Ruslan Lienkha, chief of markets at YouHodler\n\nOthers pointed to historical price patterns around Bitcoin (BTC) halvings. \u201cHistorically, as we approach a Bitcoin halving, Ethereum tends to revisit its price valuations from earlier that year,\u201d explained Pav Hundal of cryptocurrency exchange Swyftx.\n\nThe panel predicted ETH could climb as high as $2,800 but also slump to $1,200 or below by year-end 2023. Nearly half see it finishing the year between $1,751 and $2,000.\n\nMost experts said now is a good time to hold or buy Ether, though around 17% believe it is currently overvalued. Asked if and when ETH\u2019s total market value could surpass Bitcoin\u2019s, 43% of panelists said they don\u2019t expect that to ever happen. But around 20% think the \u2018flippening\u2019 \u2014 with Ethereum\u2019s market cap overtaking Bitcoin\u2019s \u2014 could occur by 2030.\n\nFollow Us on Google News"
