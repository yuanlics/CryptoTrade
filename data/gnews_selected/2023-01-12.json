        "content": "Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer at the digital-asset management firm Arca: \u201cMost investors have heard of blockchain now and want to somehow make money if blockchain succeeds. For the last five years, almost every investor has tried to find different ways to express that theme. But for the first time ever, we're coming out of a bear market with real product market fit,\u201d which includes four areas: bitcoin, stablecoins, non-fungible tokens (NFT) and decentralized finance (DeFi). \u201cIf you want to express all of those areas of blockchain with one investment, it would be Ethereum. It has wrapped bitcoin, the largest stablecoin presence, the largest NFT presence and the largest DeFi presence,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cIn some ways, ETH is basically a crypto index now.\u201d Dorman said he wouldn\u2019t worry about the potential sell-off pressure from unlocking staked ETH following the upgrade: \u201cThere might be some pent-up demand to get liquidity from those who have had no liquidity for the last six or so months, but that will easily be replaced by people who didn't stake the first time because they needed liquidity.\u201d"

        "content": "Ethereum has reached another milestone as the number of validators on its network now exceeds 500,000, data from BeaconScan shows.\n\nValidators are essential in guaranteeing the integrity and security of the Ethereum network. They operate by consensus to process transactions on the blockchain by verifying that the conditions specified in each transaction\u2019s smart contract code have been met.\n\nA validator must deposit 32 ETH (roughly $45,000) to run a dedicated staking node on the proof-of-stake blockchain. Today, staked funds are locked in the network, and while they accrue staking rewards from Ethereum\u2019s inflation, validators are unable to access the funds until after the Shanghai upgrade, expected to happen in March, which will allow withdrawals of staked ether for the first time.\n\nThe increase in number of active validators is a positive sign for the Ethereum ecosystem, John Jefferies, chief marketing officer at Blocknative, a real-time Web3 infrastructure company, told Blockworks.\n\n\u201cThe network is on the verge of reaching 500,000 active validators, pointing to increasing confidence, positive market sentiment, and conviction in the Ethereum ecosystem as a whole,\u201d Jefferies said.\n\nJefferies predicted that once the Shanghai upgrade is completed and staked ETH becomes accessible, it is likely that there will be a more liquid and free-flowing ecosystem.\n\n\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be surprising to see even more people spin up validators after Shanghai as they gain the peace of mind knowing they can unstake their ETH more fluidly,\u201d he said.\n\nSource: BeaconScan\n\nEthereum recently saw its total value stake reach 16 million ETH (over $22 billion), implying that it would be extremely difficult and costly to attack the network\u2019s consensus, Ben Edgington, a lead product owner at ConsenSys, told Blockworks.\n\n\u201cWe can consider the security of the Ethereum network on two axes. One is the total value staked,\u201d Edgington said. \u201cThe other is the degree of decentralization.\u201d\n\nAlthough decentralization is a little more difficult to analyze, as many validators are run by the same entities, reports show that they are spread across at least 11,400 physical nodes in 80 countries.\n\n\u201c[This] is a considerable degree of decentralization, and much more distributed than we had under proof-of-work,\u201d prior to the Merge, Edgington said. \u201cMany of these nodes are run by home stakers such as myself, underpinning the protocol with a huge degree of resilience and diversity.\u201d\n\nUpdated Jan. 12, 2022 at 7:43 pm ET: Headline and first paragraph changed to reflect that Ethereum now has more than 500,000 validators.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "Disclaimer: The opinions expressed by our writers are their own and do not represent the views of U.Today. The financial and market information provided on U.Today is intended for informational purposes only. U.Today is not liable for any financial losses incurred while trading cryptocurrencies. Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA recent tweet published by on-chain data vendor Santiment has offered one of the main reasons for the second largest crypto, Ethereum, to surge above the $1,400 level.\n\nHere's what has made a large contribution to Ethereum's price rise.\n\nUptick in number of ETH shark addresses\n\nOn Jan. 11, the second most popular token followed Bitcoin's bullish streak and briefly rose above the $1,400 level. Santiment team of analysts has shared that one of the major reasons behind this growth was a sharp increase in shark addresses over the past two and a half months.\n\nEthereum has reached that price level for the first time since early November.\n\nTheir tweet has it that, in the past 10 weeks, 3,000 new shark wallets emerged on the ETH network, storing from 100 to 10,000 Ethers each. Overall, the analysts have observed the highest peak of 48,556 wallets that heavy with Ether since February 2021.\n\n\ud83e\udd88 #Ethereum has jumped above $1,400 for the first time since November 7th. Over the past 10 weeks, ~3,000 new shark addresses (holding 100 to 10,000 $ETH) have shown up on the network. 48,556 shark addresses is the highest level recorded since Feb, 2021. https://t.co/yJfTP3QhKI pic.twitter.com/4tzS0nsph9 \u2014 Santiment (@santimentfeed) January 12, 2023\n\nThe second reason is that Ethereum followed Bitcoin in its rise. On Jan. 11, the flagship cryptocurrency surged above the $18,000 level for the first time in a month.\n\nAs a reminder, at the start of November, Bitcoin was trading above the $21,000 level. However, a sudden crash of the FTX crypto giant and its pocket trading firm Alameda Research sent waves of shock through the crypto market. Bitcoin plunged to $15,883 and has been trading mainly in the $16,800 range since then.\n\nDOGE co-founder sells bunch of ETH\n\nAs covered by U.Today earlier, one of the two co-founders of DOGE meme token announced that he had sold \"a bunch of ETH\" at the $1,190 price mark. Billy Markus, the co-founder, also known on Twitter as Shibetoshi Nakamoto in honor of the mysterious Bitcoin creator, explained this sale, saying that he had to pay taxes for 2022.\n\nAlas, he sold the ETH just a day before the price went up above the $1,220 level.\n\nAt the time of this writing, Ethereum is sitting at $1,398 per coin, showing a nearly 5% rise in the past 24 hours."
