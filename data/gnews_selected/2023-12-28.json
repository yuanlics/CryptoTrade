        "content": "zkSync, a Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum, recorded more transactions than the Ethereum mainnet over a one-month period, processing 34.7 million transactions in the past 30 days.\n\nA total of 34.2 million transactions were recorded on Ethereum's mainnet during the same period, according to L2Beat data. Next in line was Arbitrum, which saw 31.4 million transactions over the past 30 days.\n\nThe recent rise in transaction volume on zkSync has been attributed to the spread of inscriptions \u2014 a feature originally created on Bitcoin \u2014 to EVM networks, including most Layer 2 chains.\n\nData from L2Beat highlights that zkSync experienced its biggest monthly transaction surge on Dec. 16. That's when sync inscription was rolled out on the network and constituted 4.6 million of the 5.3 million transactions that day alone, according to Dune data aggregated by Dragonfly analyst Hildobby.\n\nInscription-related transactions\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nzkSync operates as a Layer 2 network on the Ethereum mainnet. By bundling hundreds or thousands of transactions into a single cryptographic proof, it verifies transactions much faster and more cheaply than the mainnet.\n\nSince mid-December, inscription-related transactions have contributed to zkSync\u2019s overall activity, helping it surpass both Ethereum and its Layer 2s.\n\nInscriptions are data embeds found in transaction call data, which, like Ordinals on Bitcoin, can be used to create alternate tokens and NFTs. Such tokens include Ethscriptions on Ethereum, Doginals on Dogecoin and Solana Inscriptions on Solana."

        "title": "Can This Red-Hot Crypto Outperform Bitcoin Again in 2024? - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "One of the standout performers in the crypto market this year has been Solana (CRYPTO: SOL), which is up almost 1,000% in 2023. On the strength of its recent performance, Solana has become the fifth-most valuable cryptocurrency in the world, and some analysts are even predicting that it could soon surpass Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) in terms of market cap.\n\nWhat's all the more remarkable is how Solana's performance this year compares to that of Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC), which has historically served as the benchmark for the overall crypto market. While Solana is up almost 1,000% for the year, Bitcoin is up \"just\" 160%. That's despite all the hoopla surrounding the possible new spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund and the Bitcoin halving next year, which will slow the crypto's supply growth. So the obvious question becomes: Can Solana outperform Bitcoin again in 2024?\n\nReasons for Solana's outperformance\n\nTo answer that question, it's important to understand the key factors behind Solana's meteoric rise in 2023. In the early part of the year, investors embraced the narrative that Solana had finally distanced itself from the meltdown of the cryptocurrency exchange FTX (CRYPTO: FTT). The former chief executive officer of FTX, Sam Bankman-Fried, had been a major backer of Solana, and the risk of FTX contagion was seen as a real threat at the end of 2022.\n\nAs this perceived risk subsided, it was only natural that the price of Solana eventually retraced its way back from $10 to a level around $40, which is where it was trading before the FTX collapse.\n\nAround this time, institutional investors, not just retail investors, began to buy into the narrative around a Solana recovery. They increasingly began to see Solana as a viable alternative to Ethereum, and that apparently led to a new influx of institutional investor money into Solana. CoinShares, which tracks institutional flows into and out of various cryptocurrencies, has documented a consistent pattern of institutional money leaving Ethereum and moving into Solana.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo far, so good, right? Both retail and institutional investors seemed to be aligned on Solana as a viable competitor to Ethereum.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nBut over the past month, the narrative around Solana seems to have taken another, completely unexpected turn, and that's why I'm concerned that Solana might be overheating. This new, more speculative phase has corresponded with the rise of Solana meme coins. The obvious example is Bonk (CRYPTO: BONK), which has gone absolutely wild this year. It's now up almost 10,000% year to date.\n\nThe spectacular success of Bonk has led to the launch of even sillier meme coins, including ones that feature dogs, dragons, and, yes, melons. If this meme coin mania continues, it will only lead to more volatility for Solana, which is at risk of becoming the blockchain of choice for crypto speculators. As a result, all the hard work that has gone into making Solana a viable competitor to Ethereum could be undone by the get-rich-quick crypto crowd.\n\nQuestion marks for Solana\n\nThere are also several question marks surrounding Solana in areas where it has traditionally been very strong, such as non-fungible tokens (NFTs). At the beginning of 2023, a number of popular NFT collections left Solana for other blockchains, due to the perceived risk of FTX contagion. At the same time, NFTs known as Ordinals took off on Bitcoin, to the point where NFT sales volume on Bitcoin is now higher than on Solana. Before 2023, this would have been unthinkable.\n\nThere's also the matter of regulatory risk. In June, the Securities and Exchange Commission seemed to conclude that Solana was an \"unregistered security.\" When the SEC filed a lawsuit against cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase Global (NASDAQ: COIN), it specifically mentioned Solana as one of several unregistered securities trading on the Coinbase platform. This is a tricky issue to parse because the SEC did not bring any formal enforcement action against Solana. But still, this is exactly the sort of regulatory issue that could torpedo a Solana rally in 2024.\n\nCan Solana keep it up in 2024?\n\nCertainly, there's a lot to like about Solana. I've been banging the drum for Solana ever since the collapse of FTX. I've always viewed Solana as a viable alternative to Ethereum, and I've always thought the valuations of the two cryptos should be much narrower than they are today.\n\nBut the new speculative frenzy around Solana has me very concerned. Increasingly, it suggests that Solana's performance won't be sustainable in 2024. Solana has simply gone up too far, too fast. Yes, Solana may continue to outperform Ethereum next year. But it's looking increasingly unlikely that it will also outperform Bitcoin.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Solana right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Solana, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Solana wasn't one of them.
