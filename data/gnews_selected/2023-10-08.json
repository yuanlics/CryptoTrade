        "title": "Why Ethereum developers may not prolong the fresh Devnet launch - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "The network participation rate on Ethereum increased to 90% as Devnet-9 closes in on completion.\n\nThe Dencun testnet could launch before November ends.\n\nEthereum [ETH] developers had their usual All Core Developers Consensus (ACD) call on 5 October. From the meeting, they decided the timing for the Devnet-10 launch could happen earlier than initially projected.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ETHs worth today?\n\nOnce the block generator clears the way\n\nAlthough the ACDC call #119 focused on the Dencun upgrade, the developers considered discussing the health and status of the latest developer Testnet Devnet-9 as a priority, alongside Devnet-10.\n\nFor the unfamiliar, Devnet-9 launched on 29 September, as a way to improve the network participation rate on the blockchain. The network participation rate is defined as the percentage of validators actively carrying out their duties on the network.\n\nDuring the meeting, the developers noted that the network participation rate was impressively high at 90%.\n\nHowever, Barnabas Busa, a DevOps Engineer for the Ethereum Foundation, mentioned that there were a few bugs with Devnet-9, especially in the execution layer. For context, the execution layer is the part of the network responsible for validating the state in the block header.\n\nMeanwhile, the Ethereum Foundation seemed to be working on fixing the bug as Geth developer Marius van der Wijden said that he was working on updating the block generator for the execution layer.\n\nNext, on the agenda was the Devnet-10, which is primarily to check the next maximum epoch churn limit in EIP-7514. EIP-7514 is designed to slow down the growth of the active validator set by tracking the soaring levels of staked ETH.\n\nDencun Testnet is set before November\n\nAt the time of writing, Santiment showed that the number of validator deposits was 1026. This was a notable decrease from the highs registered some weeks back. Therefore, the decline means that the objectives for Devnet-10 may already be set in motion.\n\nAs expected, Ethereum\u2019s development activity has started to rise again. The Development Activity means the code committed by developers toward upgrades on a network. Over the past month, the metric tumbled. So, the slight rise implies that developers were starting to get back to polishing the network.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s ETH\u2019s market cap in BTC terms\n\nAs per Devnet-10, Parithosh Jayanthi, another DevOps Engineer at the Foundation mentioned that it could launch as early as next week. The Berlin-based developer, however, mentioned that the timeframe could be subject to the quickness of solving outstanding bugs and issues. Busa also weighed in on the matter saying,\n\n\u201cI would like to see all clients being able to participate and no more bugs on Devnet-9 before we proceed with the larger test. We should have a very stable, like 100% participation, before we move on.\u201d\n\nRegarding the Dencun final upgrade the cal chairman Tim Beiko restated that the public Testnet would happen before Ethereum\u2019s Instabul conference in mid-November called Devconnect."

        "content": "JPMorgan Chase &. Co. has shed light on how the Ethereum network decentralization has decreased significantly since the Merge event and Shanghai upgrade went live.\n\nThe rise of staking and centralization\n\nSince implementing the Merge and Shanghai upgrades, Ethereum has seen a substantial uptick in staking activities.\n\nStaking, a process where users lock up their crypto assets to support network operations, has its merits. According to a CoinDesk report citing JPMorgan research, this surge in staking activity comes at a cost: centralization.\n\nTraditionally, many in the crypto community prefer decentralized liquid staking platforms like Lido over their centralized counterparts.\n\nLido\u2019s approach included adding more node operators to ensure no single entity controlled a significant portion of staked Ether (ETH). The aim was to address centralization concerns.\n\nHowever, centralization remains a risk. A concentration of liquidity providers or node operators could act as a single point of failure or even collude to create an oligopoly, potentially undermining the interests of the broader Ethereum community.\n\nEthereum, the world\u2019s second-largest crypto, has become more centralized since the Merge and Shanghai upgrades. And JPMorgan is highlighting concerns over a decline in staking yields.\n\nYou might also like: Ethereum\u2019s Dencun upgrade: the next major step in scalability\n\nThe menace of rehypothecation\n\nAnother highlight from the report is rehypothecation. This complex term refers to the practice of reusing liquidity tokens as collateral across multiple decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols simultaneously.\n\nDeFi encompasses lending, trading, and other financial activities carried out on the blockchain.\n\nThe problem arises when a staked asset\u2019s value sharply declines or faces a security breach or protocol error.\n\nIn such scenarios, rehypothecation could trigger a cascade of liquidations, jeopardizing the stability of the DeFi ecosystem.\n\nFurthermore, the report points out that the increase in staking has diminished the appeal of Ethereum from a yield perspective.\n\nThis shift is especially noticeable amid rising yields in traditional financial assets. The total staking yield has fallen from 7.3% before the Shanghai upgrade to approximately 5.5%.\n\nFrom a different perspective, the research data presented in December following Ethereum\u2019s Merge upgrade in September 2022 reveals a significant reduction in the network\u2019s energy consumption, akin to the energy usage of entire countries such as Ireland and Austria.\n\nThis decrease in power consumption positively contributes to environmental sustainability, aligning with broader global efforts to reduce the carbon footprint associated with blockchain technologies.\n\nEthereum\u2019s core developers have introduced an Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP-7514) as part of the upcoming Dencun upgrade, scheduled for activation in October 2023.\n\nThis proposal aims to slow down the rate of Ether staking. The intention is to provide the Ethereum community with more time to devise a practical reward scheme for stakers on the network.\n\nETH price analysis\n\nAs of the time of writing, the price of Ethereum (ETH) stands at $1,629, representing a 3.4% decline on the weekly timeframe.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently sitting at 40.4.\n\nThe price of ETH is struggling to maintain the $1600 level after facing rejection at the $1700 resistance level. A failure to hold the $1600 level could potentially lead to a further decline to the $1500 level.\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "title": "Vitalik Buterin proposes two-tier model to address 'centralization challenges' in Ethereum staking - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s founder, Vitalik Buterin, unveiled an innovative proposal this week aimed at refining the platform\u2019s staking mechanism.\n\nAs the world\u2019s second-largest blockchain by market capitalization, Ethereum\u2019s continued evolution is crucial for its vast user base, and these proposed changes aim to bolster decentralization, efficiency, and security.\n\nA Decentralized Vision for Staking\n\nThe primary concern addressed in Buterin\u2019s proposal revolves around the limitations of the current staking system.\n\nNotably, he pinpoints decentralization issues surrounding the selection process for node operators across various staking pools and identifies inefficiencies in the current Layer 1 (L1) consensus mechanism.\n\nPresently, the constraints of solo staking combined with issues surrounding liquid staking mean that the platform can only process between approximately 100,000 to 1 million BLS signatures per slot.\n\nA further complication arises from the need for accountability in signing, which demands a participation record for each signature. If Ethereum scales up globally, using full danksharding for storage might still fall short, with a mere 16 MB per slot accommodating around 64 million stakers.\n\nDrawing inspiration from models implemented by Rocketpool and Lido, Buterin suggests adopting a two-tiered staking system. In this structure, Node Operators and Delegators emerge as central figures.\n\nTo rectify this, Buterin suggests a two-tiered staking model:\n\nA high-complexity slashable tier with frequent activity but limited participants (around 10,000). A low-complexity tier, where members engage sporadically and face minimal or no slashing risk.\n\nThis model would involve the modification of the validator balance cap and implementing a balance threshold to categorize validators into these tiers.\n\nButerin elaborates on potential roles for small-stakers:\n\nRandom selection of 10,000 small-stakers for each slot who sign off on their slot\u2019s head. If divergences arise between the staker and node operator choices, it triggers an error, prompting community intervention.\n\nA system where a delegator declares their online presence, offering to serve as a small-staker for a set duration. For a node\u2019s message to be acknowledged, it needs endorsement from both the node and a randomly picked delegator.\n\nAn approach in which delegators signal their availability, and subsequently, chosen delegators confirm their online status. These delegators can then publish inclusion lists for block validation.\n\nThe roles envisioned for small-stakers are characterized by their sporadic participation and non-slashable nature. Importantly, these roles tackle the significant issue of a potential 51% node operator majority attempting transaction censorship.\n\nButerin also contemplates these solutions in the context of staking pool features. He suggests protocols allowing validators to designate two staking keys: a persistent key and a temporary one, which, when combined, influence the block finalization process.\n\nThe Implications\n\nButerin\u2019s proposal isn\u2019t just technical fixes; it\u2019s a vision for Ethereum\u2019s future. By decentralizing the staking process further and integrating safety nets, he aims to:\n\nEmpower those lacking resources for solo staking, granting them meaningful participation avenues. Reduce the transaction processing load on Ethereum\u2019s consensus layer, making it easier for all to run a validating node.\n\nBy diffusing the staking process and embedding safeguards, the objectives are clear: to empower those who traditionally lack the means for solo staking by offering them a meaningful way to participate and alleviate the transaction processing strain on Ethereum\u2019s consensus layer. This ensures a more accessible platform for everyone intending to run a validating node.\n\nThe proposed refinements underscore the pressing need for minimal, strategic protocol modifications, all pointing towards a balanced, decentralized, and high-functioning Ethereum network."
