        "content": "Solana NFTs Eclipse Ethereum in Trading Volume Amid Surge\n\nSolana (SOL) continues to experience upward momentum, with its non-fungible tokens (NFTs) witnessing considerably higher trading volume, surpassing even that of Ethereum.\n\nProjects like Mad Lads and Tensorians have seen significant price increases, multiplying several times over in recent weeks.\n\nMoreover, the collective trading volume of Solana NFTs has now surpassed that of Ethereum, which traditionally leads in trading volume and hosts the most valuable projects.\n\nOver the past 24 hours, Solana NFTs have generated $14.8 million in trades, compared to approximately $13.9 million on Ethereum, according to data from CryptoSlam.\n\nThis surge in Solana trading volume represents a growth of about 92% in the past day.\n\nAmong the top traded projects during this period, Tensorians, associated with the Tensor NFT marketplace, leads the way with over $4 million in sales.\n\nWithin the Solana ecosystem, Tensor currently dominates with nearly 76% market share in the past 24 hours, as reported by Tiexo.\n\nPreviously, Magic Eden, the multi-chain marketplace that held a prominent position in the Solana space, now holds about 16% market share.\n\nSOL Extends Gains as Market Rally Continues\n\n\n\nOver the past couple of days, Solana\u2019s native cryptocurrency SOL has posted significant gains and its leading meme coin BONK reached new all-time highs.\n\nOn Friday, SOL reached a new 19-month peak, touching $73.85.\n\nAlthough still a far cry from its all-time high of nearly $260 in November 2021, SOL has made a remarkable recovery from its low of around $8 in late 2022.\n\nCurrently trading above $73, SOL has recorded a 13% surge in the past 24 hours, according to CoinGecko.\n\nBONK, the leading meme coin on the Solana network, has been on a rapid ascent in recent weeks, setting a new all-time high price of $0.00001314 on Friday.\n\nEven with a slight dip to $0.00001283 at the time of writing, BONK has registered a 10% gain in the past 24 hours and tripled in value over the last seven days.\n\nIn the past month alone, BONK has skyrocketed by an astounding 982%, propelling it into the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, with a total market cap of $747 million.\n\nIn addition to the remarkable price performance, the recipients of the Jito airdrop on the Solana DeFi platform are also reaping substantial benefits.\n\nThe JTO token distributed to early users during the airdrop has surged by 72% in the past day, reaching $3.35 per token.\n\nLast week, Jupiter, a decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregator running on the Solana blockchain, also announced the opening of initial claims for its JUP token airdrop.\n\nThe airdrop has been designed to distribute 40% of the total JUP token supply, which amounts to four out of the 10 billion tokens."

        "content": "For December 29 expiry, there are twice as many calls as puts and this implies Ethereum\u2019s derivatives traders are bullish on ETH price rally by the end of December. The altcoin is currently trading at $2,359 on Binance. The altcoin has sustained above the $2,300 level while Ethereum is in its uptrend. The altcoin has yielded nearly 13% weekly gains and upwards of 25% monthly gains for traders in the past month. The altcoin\u2019s trade volume has surged to $12.36 billion in the past 24 hours.\n\nFor Ether , the put/call ratio is 0.38 on December 8, as seen on Deribit. For options contracts with January 26, 2024 expiry, the put/call ratio is 0.19. This rounds off to nearly 2 puts every 10 calls, a bullish bias among derivatives traders.\n\nData from Deribit reveals an underlying bullish bias among derivatives traders, on Ethereum. The put/call ratio is considered an indicator of the mood among market participants. It is a contrarian indicator and it looks at options buildup.

        "content": "Developers working with the two largest cryptocurrencies capitalized on early bull market intrigue.\n\nRecently, there has been a notable increase in funding interest towards bitcoin mining companies. However, this week\u2019s most substantial investment influx was directed at projects developing practical applications for the cryptocurrency.\n\nIn a parallel trend, various projects focused on scaling Ethereum have also secured considerable support recently. This surge in investment comes as the network gears up for its anticipated Dencun upgrade, scheduled for next year.\n\nBabylon raised $18 million in a Series A led by Polychain and Hack VC. The company focuses on a unique protocol that allows Bitcoin to be used for staking in proof-of-stake networks. It offers a secure way for bitcoin holders to earn yields without needing third-party trust or bridging to other chains.\n\nRead more: Core devs rule out Dencun fork this year\n\nElsewhere, MAP Protocol, a layer-2 chain built on Bitcoin, announced a strategic investment from Waterdrip Capital. MAP is a Bitcoin layer-2 solution that seeks to enhance cross-chain interoperability. It enables seamless interaction between Bitcoin and other public blockchain networks, ensuring secure and efficient transactions across different platforms.\n\nBitcoin investment firm Swan Bitcoin said Thursday that it raised and spent $205 million in 2023 via its equity, credit and hedge funds. The company also said it plans to raise an additional $150 million as it builds out an institutional offering.\n\nRead more: Institutional custody of bitcoin could kill it, cautions Hayes\n\nOn the Ethereum side, Paradigm led a $9 million seed round in on-chain data platform Shadow. The engineering company streamlines on-chain data access by enabling efficient retrieval from contracts and transactions, and optimizing indexing. Its approach of moving event logs to shadow forks reduces gas costs and contract sizes, offering a cost-effective solution for blockchain data management.\n\nTen announced a $7.5 million raise for its encryption-focused layer-2, while another startup named Versatus said it closed a $2.3 million seed round for its \u201cstateless\u201d Ethereum rollup.\n\nDeFi platform shunts VC backing in favor of \u2018aligned\u2019 investors\n\nLending and borrowing app Curvance closed a $3.6 million seed round this week that was noticeably thin on venture capital investment. The protocol mostly raised funds from a group of DeFi and DAO actors, including Offchain Labs and Wormhole.\n\nThe platform\u2019s co-founder Chris Carapola said Curvance capped investment in the token sale at $250,000 per party and hopes to soon turn governance over to a DAO. By capping token sale investments, Carapola suggested Curvance was trying to prevent major voting inequality within the DAO.\n\nCurvance drew interest from venture capital, Carapola said, but decided to primarily raise funds from actors in its ecosystem instead, taking over a year to do so.\n\n\u201cI would say the consistent thing that we saw was, \u2018This sounds amazing. How much can we get, and can you increase the round, can we play with the [valuation], do you want to do a Series A,\u2019 like the more conventional route. And as soon as that really became the topic, it was like, \u2018you know you\u2019re not aligned, right?\u2019\u201d Carapola said.\n\nCurvance raised its seed round at a $56 million valuation and its private round at a $75 million valuation, Carapola said.\n\nOther notable fundraises\n\nAnimoca Brands raised an $11.8 million funding tranche to develop its Mocaverse \u201cFrequent Player Program\u201d with participation from Block1, OKX Ventures, Foresight Ventures, Polygon Ventures, Dapper Labs and others.\n\nWeb3 music streaming platform Sona raised $6.9 million from Polychain Capital, Haun Ventures and Rogue Capital.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "Disclaimer: The opinions expressed by our writers are their own and do not represent the views of U.Today. The financial and market information provided on U.Today is intended for informational purposes only. U.Today is not liable for any financial losses incurred while trading cryptocurrencies. Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEthereum is showing signs of a potential new era of growth amid a market that is increasingly favoring Layer-1 (L1) solutions like Solana. Ethereum's price movement has not yet shown the explosiveness the majority of the market had been expecting. However, the cryptocurrency might still show us what it's got.\n\nThe price trajectory of Ethereum has been robust, with recent trends suggesting that the momentum behind its surge is far from over. Despite lagging behind some of its L1 counterparts, Ethereum holds a unique position on the market due to its extensive developer community, widespread adoption and the significant role it plays in decentralized finance (DeFi) and other blockchain applications.\n\nWhile Ethereum has not experienced the same intensity in its price surge as Solana, the potential for profit on the ongoing bull market remains substantial. Ethereum continues to be an attractive investment due to its size, liquidity and status as the leading platform for smart contracts. This suggests that any further gains on the broader market could amplify ETH's price performance.\n\nTechnical analysis reveals that Ethereum is poised for growth, with key resistance levels being tested. A breakthrough above these levels could signal a continuation of the bull run, enticing both retail and institutional investors.\n\nSolana is king\n\nSolana (SOL) has been a standout on the cryptocurrency market, displaying a price momentum that far exceeds expectations, especially in the wake of the Jito airdrop. The drop injected fresh funds into the SOL ecosystem, boosting its already impressive performance.\n\nThe price movement analysis of Solana reveals a steep upward trajectory, signifying not just a recovery, but dominance in the digital asset space. The resilience and rapid growth of SOL are indicative of a robust and well-engaged network. The asset's performance is not only impressive when viewed in isolation but also when compared to other cryptocurrencies, whose surges have been less intense.\n\nThe potential for Solana to breach the symbolic $100 mark, a level not seen since its collapse in 2021, has been a topic of speculation among market watchers. Prominent figures in the cryptocurrency game, such as Arthur Hayes, have expressed belief in Solana's ability to reach this milestone. With the current price action, Solana is not just fulfilling these predictions; it is surpassing them, setting new highs and establishing a strong presence on the market.\n\nSolana's ascent is particularly noteworthy given the broader context of the market. While other assets struggle to maintain momentum, SOL's surge is a testament to its underlying technology and the confidence it instills in investors. The blockchain's high throughput and low transaction fees position it as a strong competitor in the space, capable of sustaining growth even in a turbulent market.\n\nBitcoin remains neutral\n\nBitcoin's recent price reversal could be construed as a beacon of positivity for the altcoin markets. After a period of consolidation and bearish trends, Bitcoin's turnaround has begun to inject optimism into the crypto ecosystem. This shift in momentum often has a ripple effect on altcoins, which can experience amplified movements in response to Bitcoin's falling dominance.\n\nIts dominant position means that positive price action can lead to increased investor confidence, which often spills over to the altcoin markets. When Bitcoin's price stabilizes or starts to climb, it can provide the necessary reassurance for investors to start diversifying their portfolios with altcoins, hence, driving up their prices.\n\nBitcoin's reversal comes at a pivotal moment when many altcoins have been developing their ecosystems and strengthening their use cases. With the leading cryptocurrency regaining ground, it could be the catalyst that altcoins need to attract more attention and investment. A bullish Bitcoin could mean more capital flowing into the crypto market as a whole, and altcoins are well-positioned to benefit from this influx.\n\nFurthermore, when Bitcoin surges, it can lead to a reallocation of profits from Bitcoin to altcoins as investors seek to maximize returns by investing in assets with higher potential upside. This can be particularly beneficial for well-established altcoins with solid fundamentals and for emerging coins that capture the market's imagination."
