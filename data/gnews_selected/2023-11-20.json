        "content": "Bitcoin Overtakes Ethereum in Transaction Fees on the Back of Renewed Ordinals Frenzy\n\nBitcoin (BTC) has recently surpassed Ethereum (ETH) in terms of average daily transaction fees, signaling a notable shift in the fee landscape. On November 20, Bitcoin's average daily transaction fee reached $10.34, while Ethereum's average fee stood at $8.43.\n\nThe upswing in Bitcoin transaction fees is a result of heightened activity surrounding the Ordinals Protocol, which enables the creation of NFT-like assets and BRC-20 tokens on the Bitcoin network. After a period of relative dormancy in late September to October, Ordinals-based assets experienced a significant surge in late October, according to Dune Analytics.\n\nSince October 24, over 6 million Ordinal assets have been generated, leading to the redistribution of more than 800 BTC in fees (equivalent to $30 million) to the network. The momentum further escalated when ORDI, the second-largest BRC-20 token by market capitalization, was listed on Binance on November 7. This listing sparked increased buying activity of BRC-20 tokens, resulting in a price surge of slightly over 50% for the ORDI token.\n\nIn addition to the growing popularity of the Ordinals Protocol, the Taproot Wizards project, which is built on the Ordinals protocol, announced a seed funding round of $7.5 million on November 17.\n\nLet us know what you loved about this article, what could be improved, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form."

        "content": "Bitcoin BTC +5.88% 's 7-day average transaction fee has surpassed that of Ethereum's, according to The Block's Data Dashboard.\n\nIn the last week alone, Bitcoin's average transaction fee increased 48.4% from $8.59 on Nov. 12 to $12.75 on Nov. 19. Conversely, Ethereum's average transaction fee was $7.55 on Nov. 19.\n\n\"While both chains have seen an uptick in activity recently (and in turn fees), the recent resurgence of Ordinals minting and trading seems to have pushed Bitcoin to have an average transaction fee higher than Ethereum's,\" The Block research analyst Rebecca Stevens said.\n\nThe 7-day moving average of the average transaction fee on Bitcoin has surpassed that on Ethereum since Nov. 9, Stevens noted, adding that the gap is now much wider than when they briefly flipped in early October.\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nBitcoin Ordinals\n\nBitcoin Ordinals are a type of non-fungible token recorded on the Bitcoin network.

Startups specializing in Bitcoin Ordinals have seen venture capital interest, such as Taproot Wizards's $7.5 million seed raise on Nov. 16."
