        "title": "Cardano Not Listed in Top of Chains More Decentralized Than Ethereum: Here's Why - U.Today",
        "content": "The quest to quantify blockchain decentralization has led to various metrics, with the Nakamoto Coefficient being one of the prominent measures. However, in the recent listings of blockchains by their degree of decentralization, Cardano was notably absent from the top ranks, a position that has sparked curiosity and debate within the crypto community.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCardano is often distinguished from Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-based chains due to its unique network structure and operational mechanics. Unlike Ethereum, which runs on the EVM, allowing for interoperability and similar structures across various networks, Cardano employs a different approach with its Ouroboros consensus algorithm.\n\nOuroboros is a proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol, but it diverges from the standard PoS mechanisms. It is designed to achieve consensus in a more energy-efficient and scalable way. This dedication to a scientific philosophy in its protocol development sets Cardano apart, which may contribute to why it is often considered separately from other EVM-compatible chains.\n\nThe distinctiveness of Cardano's architecture is complemented by its layered structure. The settlement layer (Cardano SL) and the computation layer (Cardano CL) operate independently, which differentiates its operational functions from those of other blockchains where these layers are typically intertwined.\n\nCardano's network also emphasizes a community-driven approach to governance and development. The project's catalyst funds and the Voltaire phase, which aims to introduce a fully decentralized decision-making process, are testaments to its commitment to a high degree of decentralization, albeit not necessarily captured by the Nakamoto Coefficient.\n\nFurthermore, Cardano's method of staking and block production involves a randomized process for electing slot leaders, which is different from Ethereum's process. This adds another layer of complexity when comparing the two networks based on the number of entities that can collectively shut down or control the network, as the Nakamoto Coefficient attempts to measure."

        "title": "Ethereum (ETH) Price Breaks Critical Resistance Level: $3,000 Ahead? - U.Today",
        "content": "Disclaimer: The opinions expressed by our writers are their own and do not represent the views of U.Today. The financial and market information provided on U.Today is intended for informational purposes only. U.Today is not liable for any financial losses incurred while trading cryptocurrencies. Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nEthereum (ETH) has recently displayed remarkable bullish behavior as the price broke through a critical resistance level. The latest charts illustrate an ascending trajectory that has left many investors and analysts contemplating the possibility of the ETH/USD chart reaching the coveted $3,000 mark in the near future.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nExamining the daily chart for Ethereum, we see a series of higher lows and higher highs, which is the go-to indication of a bull market. The price has now surpassed the dynamic resistance provided by the 50-day and 100-day moving averages.\n\nETH/USD chart by TradingView\n\nHowever, despite the recent uptick, the volume behind the movement is descending, suggesting a lack of strong momentum. This pattern often precedes a consolidation phase, where the price stabilizes before making a definitive move. Investors should watch for a possible consolidation, which could confirm the sustainability of the recent breakout.\n\nAdding to the market dynamics, the rise of Layer 2 solutions (L2s) has been gradually increasing Ethereum network fees. While L2s are designed to enhance scalability and reduce costs on the Ethereum network, the transition period could lead to a slow but steady climb in fees. This rise could potentially lead to a stalemate situation in network activity if users begin to balk at higher costs, influencing the ETH price as the network's utility comes under scrutiny.\n\nOn the technical front, the relative strength index (RSI) is approaching overbought territory, yet another sign that the market could be due for a pause. A retraction or sideways movement would allow the RSI to reset, providing a healthier foundation for future growth.\n\nThe confluence of these technical indicators and the fundamental backdrop of rising network fees due to the adoption of L2s presents a complex picture for Ethereum. While the current price action looks promising for a test of $3,000, the underlying volume and network fee trends suggest that a period of consolidation or even a minor pullback might be on the horizon before any further significant upward movements are observed."

        "content": "Peter Szilagyi, the team lead of Ethereum, has expressed frustration over his alma mater's lack of interest in providing opportunities for students to collaborate with Ethereum (ETH).\n\nIn a series of posts on X (formerly Twitter), Szilagyi explained that he had always felt a lack of genuine interest when he returned to his old university to deliver talks about Ethereum.\n\nHe stated that the students appeared to be more focused on the price of Ethereum rather than the project itself. ETH has increased 20.10% over the last 30 days. At the time of publication, ETH's current price is $1,698.72.\n\n\u201cThe audience seems to have been stuck in the number go up aspect; and the organizers always used it as an ad campaign.\u201d\n\nOver the past years I've been asked many times to do talks at my old university about #Ethereum. I did a couple of them, but didn't feel genuine interest.\n\n\n\nThe audience seems to have been stuck in the number go up aspect; and the organizers always used it as an ad campaign. 1/4 \u2014 P\u00e9ter Szil\u00e1gyi (karalabe.eth) (@peter_szilagyi) December 2, 2023\n\nSzilagyi noted that this year he organized a grant for 9 students to participate in Devconnect, including flights and accommodation. However, he claims the students are not aware of who is funding the initiative.\n\n\u201cI haven't met the students myself, but someone supposedly has. They had no clue where the grant came from,\u201d he stated.\n\n\u201cFigured lets see if this piqued some interest. Wrote to a bunch of old university contacts (including the person through whom I have the grant) if they could recommend some students to potentially collab on some stuff (paid).\u201d\n\nHowever, Szilagyi insists that the university neglected to respond to his emails, leaving him in the dark about the outcome.\n\n\u201cTwo [weeks] later, zero effs, not even a response,\u201d he declared.\n\nHowever, recent reports suggest a growing demand for crypto and blockchain courses in universities.\n\nRelated: Ethereum price rallies toward key resistance but is ETH\u2019s strength sustainable?\n\nOn Feb. 24, Cointelegraph reported that major companies are helping to drive demand for crypto education.\n\nIn recent years, several blue-chip firms including Oracle, Amazon, and Google, have actively hired those with crypto and blockchain knowledge to help develop blockchain products.\n\nIt was also noted that there is an increase in interest from information systems students to learn about decentralized applications.\n\nIn more recent news, France has now opened the Institute of Crypto-Assets. The institute will support and conduct research related to blockchain technology and crypto.\n\nMagazine: Ethereum restaking: Blockchain innovation or dangerous house of cards?"
