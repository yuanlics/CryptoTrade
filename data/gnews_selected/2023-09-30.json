        "content": "Bitwise Asset Management announced the launch of two Ethereum-themed exchange-traded funds (ETFs), joining the growing list of asset managers looking to create Ethereum-based futures products after the SEC greenlit them.\n\nThe two funds will be called the Bitwise Ethereum Strategy ETF (AETH) and the Bitwise Bitcoin and Ether Equal Weight Strategy ETF (BTOP). Bitwise said the launch of these ETFs will facilitate investor access to Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Ether futures and further expand regulated and trusted investment avenues in the crypto sector.\n\nEthereum futures ETFs\n\nBitwise chief investment officer Matt Hougan noted the extensive portfolio opportunity Ethereum offers compared to Bitcoin, describing it as a blend of alternative and conventional growth investment. He added:\n\n\u201cSome investors view Ethereum as an alternative, while others perceive it as a conventional growth investment, encompassing attributes of both.\u201d\n\nThe launch comes as Ethereum continues to establish itself as a nexus of innovation and growth. It brings forth an ecosystem thriving with applications and developments, capturing the attention of millions of users and leading brands.\n\nBitwise CEO Hunter Horsley highlighted Ethereum\u2019s dynamic growth and the momentum it\u2019s gaining and said the ETFs are intended to be a gateway for investors to participate in Ethereum\u2019s expanding landscape through regulated avenues that inspire confidence.\n\nBroader landscape\n\nThe commencement of trading for Bitwise\u2019s ETFs is part of a larger trend, with numerous companies, including Invesco and Valkyrie, exploring Ethereum ETF offerings while awaiting approval for spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nThe decisions by the U.S. SEC on these applications are highly anticipated, with outcomes potentially being influenced by related developments such as the Grayscale lawsuit.\n\nThe crypto community is keenly observing what the SEC does, as approval decisions by the watchdog are poised to shape the trajectory of crypto investments in the U.S. for years to come.\n\nNotably, Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart revealed that nine Ethereum Futures ETFs, including Bitwise\u2019s, are set to receive expedited approval from the SEC for their launch on Monday, October 2, 2023."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nSupply dynamics in Ethereum are constantly being upended amid this year's dizzying drop in DeFi, NFT sales, and meme coin trading.\n\nDepending on which time frame you are looking at, Ethereum can be deflationary or inflationary: on a seven-day model, Ethereum becomes more scarce, whereas on a yearly framework, it issues more than it burns.\n\nWhat\u2019s going on with the network\u2019s supply dynamics, why are transaction fees prices dropping, and how does it look for the future of Ethereum?\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBack in August 2021, Ethereum implemented EIP-1559, which introduced a fee-burning mechanism. Since then, the supply has had a direct connection to gas prices. Higher gas prices mean more ETH getting burned and vice versa.\n\nThis set the table for last year\u2019s merge. The transition from proof-of-work to proof of stake ended up reducing the issuance of ETH by 90%, leading many to claim that the network was now \u201cultrasound money.\u201d\n\nBut that label has been put to the test amid dwindling gas prices and lesser transactional volume.\n\nTransaction fees stand at around $0.28 for sending ETH across the protocol. According to Etherscan data, a trade on Uniswap currently costs $2.76\u2014a far cry from its $4.17 price in early September and a level not seen since the collapse of FTX in late 2022.\n\nAmberdata\u2019s head of research, Chris Martin, told Decrypt that the reasons for declining gas prices are three-fold.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe Ethereum Foundation's focus on scaling with Ethereum 2.0 has had enormous benefits for the network, making it cheaper and more secure,\u201d was his first order of things. Martin then referred to the growth of Layer-2s, elucidating how the increase in these scaling solutions has \u201ctaken a lot of the volume off the mainchain.\u201d\n\nIn third place, said Martin, is the lack of narrative\u2013something the broader crypto market has been grappling with as of late. \u201cThe current market has left many waiting for the next big thing,\u201d he explained, adding that \u201cthere are opportunities, only these are less than in 2021.\u201d\n\nJulio Barragan, the director of education at Blocknative\u2014a Web3 tool that lets users price, preview and monitor transactions\u2014thinks the gas situation is only momentary. He told Decrypt that \u201cas soon as volume picks back up, so will competition for block space, and the network will automatically adjust gas prices accordingly.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s to come, then? For Barragan, it\u2019s a nebulous future.\n\n\u201cPredicting the future of Ethereum gas prices is further complicated by the gradual acceptance of ERC-4337,\u201d he told Decrypt. Also known as account abstraction, the upgrade will look to make crypto wallets as easy to use as email.\n\nBarragan added that it\u2019s unclear what the long-term impact account abstraction and further adoption of layer-2\u2019s will have on gas prices \u201dand therefore supply.\u201d\n\nHe concluded that lower fees can bring more users and activity on-chain, but \u201cmore users ultimately lead to more congestion.\u201d"

        "title": "Looking for the Next Ethereum? 2 Cryptocurrencies to Buy Now - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Since its launch in July 2015, Ethereum (ETH -0.21%) has been one of the best financial assets any investor could have owned, as the token's price has skyrocketed 53,000% over its roughly eight-year history (as of Sept. 27). The road hasn't been a smooth one, as the past couple years have shown, but it's hard to deny the rapid rise of this digital asset.\n\nWhile Ethereum might be on your radar as a potential buying opportunity today, especially since it's currently 67% below its peak price, it's worthwhile to consider two smaller cryptocurrencies to invest in.\n\nThe world's decentralized computer\n\nWhat makes Ethereum different from Bitcoin, the world's oldest and most valuable cryptocurrency network, is that it was the first blockchain to introduce smart contracts. These are software programs that automatically run when the stakeholders satisfy their ends of a particular agreement. Smart contracts are an innovative feature that underpin the promise that cryptocurrency could disrupt numerous industries by eliminating the need for middlemen.\n\nThis adds tremendous functionality to the Ethereum network, leading some to call it the world's biggest decentralized computing platform. In fact, Ethereum has become the undisputed leader in terms of decentralized applications, including for things like non-fungible tokens and decentralized finance protocols.\n\nEthereum's development pipeline is also indicative of the sheer number of computer programmers working on its advancement. An upgrade called the Merge transitioned the network to a proof-of-stake consensus system, which is more energy-efficient and an update that could set the blockchain up for better scalability. There are many more phases left on the horizon.\n\nIt might seem like a no-brainer decision to buy this crypto right now, but investors might want to look at these so-called \"Ethereum killers.\"\n\nThe case for Cardano\n\nAs the seventh-most-valuable cryptocurrency, Cardano (ADA 6.69%) immediately comes to mind as a formidable rival to Ethereum's dominance. Cardano was launched in 2017 by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson, and its token has climbed in value by 874% during that time.\n\nWhat makes Cardano unique is not that it also enables the implementation of smart contracts or that it runs a PoS consensus mechanism, but it's the blockchain's unique development approach. While many cryptos adopt the Silicon Valley mindset of \"go fast and break things,\" Cardano instead emphasizes being cautious and thoughtful when introducing changes to the network.\n\nThe current stage of development is known as Basho, which focuses on things like scaling and interoperability. This is the fourth of five parts, with the last stage focused on governance. Cardano relies on top researchers, computer scientists, and other academics from leading universities across the globe to help push it forward.\n\nCardano already has proven its ability to launch real-world enterprise-level solutions using its innovations. For example, it can better handle KYC/AML checks in the financial services industry. And it can help track supply chains in the agricultural sector.\n\nAs long as Cardano continues making progress on improving the network with new tech features, while also boosting utility in various industry settings, there's certainly the potential for its token to rise in value.\n\nThe case for Solana\n\nSolana (SOL 14.20%) was launched in 2020 by ex-Qualcomm engineer Anatoly Yakovenko. Its token has skyrocketed 1,890% since its founding, a wonderful gain. Currently, Solana carries a market cap of $7.8 billion, making it the ninth-most-valuable cryptocurrency in the world.\n\nLike Ethereum and Cardano, Solana also possesses functionality for smart contracts. And in addition to operating a PoS system, this blockchain also runs something known as proof-of-history (PoH). PoH basically eliminates the need to add timestamps to the data included in blocks, which can speed up transaction throughout. Solana is actually known as being the fastest crypto network, with a theoretical capacity to process 50,000 transactions per second (TPS). For comparison's sake, Ethereum can only handle less than 15 TPS right now.\n\nNaturally, this makes Solana a prime candidate to disrupt one of the most lucrative areas within the overall financial services space, and that's payments. In early 2022, Solana Pay was introduced. This innovative service allows a merchant and consumer to transact with each other directly, with instant settlement and virtually no fees. For businesses that run on thin margins, getting rid of the need to process costly credit card payments can lead to savings that flow straight to the bottom line.\n\nOf course, this puts Solana in direct competition with the likes of Visa and Mastercard. Even so, it's easy to get excited about the potential."
