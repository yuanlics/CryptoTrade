        "content": "On-chain data shows a crypto whale \u201c0x13e382\u201d lost $24.23 million worth of liquid staked Ethereum, including 4,851 rETH (worth $8.58 million) and 9,579 stETH ($15.63 million), to phishing scammers on Sept. 6.\n\nWeb3 security firm Scam Sniffer revealed that the whale had unwittingly given token approval to the scammers by signing \u201cincreaseAllowance\u201d transactions. The firm described the theft as probably \u201cthe largest amount ever stolen from a single victim.\u201d\n\nThe stolen funds initially landed in two addresses, namely 0x693b72 and 0x4c10a4. However, the scammers have relocated some of these assets to Fixed Float exchange, while the remainder resides in three other distinct addresses.\n\nNotably, Scam Sniffer observed that one of the addresses connected to this fraudulent activity, specifically 0x4c10a4, is associated with numerous cryptocurrency phishing websites and has maintained activity since May 21.\n\nAlthough the victim\u2019s identity remains undisclosed, their transaction history indicates a seasoned liquidity provider with substantial on-chain experience. This wallet has operated since 2017 and currently facilitates over $1.6 million in WBTC/USDT liquidity on the Uniswap V3 platform.\n\nPhishing scams rampant on X\n\nThe rise of phishing scams on X, formerly Twitter, has become a growing concern for the crypto community, which has been inundated with several verified paid bots using the social media platform to perpetrate their activities.\n\nOn-chain investigator ZachXBT specifically expressed concerns about this issue, drawing the crypto community\u2019s attention to the proliferation of fake verified organizations on the platform.\n\n\u201cVerified orgs were intended to make it harder for scammers, but it has just created a new black market for accounts with no way for us to report and take down these accounts easily,\u201d he said.\n\nThis underscores the persistent threat of phishing scams in cryptocurrency, even amid a bear market. According to cybersecurity experts at Kaspersky, crypto-related phishing scams have increased by 40% year-on-year."

        "content": "A new research paper co-authored by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin delves into the ways in which blockchains can remain both private and compliant with government regulations.\n\nThe paper comes during a notable period of friction between the use of permissionless networks and government agencies wishing to expand their oversight of such activities. Last month, two co-founders of the EVM-compatible transaction mixing service Tornado Cash were charged by the US government.\n\nThe paper\u2019s authors \u2014 Buterin, as well as Chainalysis chief scientist Jacob Illum, University of Basel professor Fabian Sch\u00e4r, doctoral candidate Matthias Nadler of the University of Basel, and Spankchain co-founder Ameen Soleimani \u2014 contend that good and bad actors could be distinguished through the use of a \u201csmart contract-based privacy enhancing protocol\u201d dubbed Privacy Pools.\n\nPrivacy Pools uses zero-knowledge (ZK) technology and enables users to generate a new withdrawal address that can\u2019t be linked to previous transactions.\n\nIt also lets users choose their own privacy settings \u2014 meaning they can exclude any suspicious users from their transactions. This can be achieved through Merkle roots.\n\nThe authors note that their intention is to find cooperative solutions between lawmakers, regulators and practitioners across various fields to ensure that privacy-enhanced infrastructure can thrive in an otherwise regulated environment.\n\n\u201cWe argue that the proposal is quite flexible and can be adapted to potentially satisfy a\n\nlarge variety of regulatory requirements,\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cThe paper should be seen as a humble contribution towards a potential future in which financial privacy and regulation can co-exist.\u201d\n\nInside Privacy Pools\n\nAny crypto asset created and spent on a blockchain possesses a coin ID (or hash) associated with it. This information is stored using a Merkle tree, a data structure through which each hash is linked to another hash in a tree-like structure.\n\nNumerous transaction hashes are stored in a block, and each block is also hashed, creating a Merkle root.\n\nIn tandem with zero-knowledge tech \u2014 which enable blockchains to prove that data is accurate without revealing the information itself \u2014 users can prove that their withdrawals are made through a previous deposit. At the same time, they\u2019d only reveal information from a limited data set of their choosing.\n\nThis means that honest users can prove that the origins of their funds are not directly tied to criminal activity.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nAs the bear market continues to tighten its grip, Ethereum has witnessed a decline in price mirroring the downward trajectory of Bitcoin.\n\nThis downturn has instilled apprehension among investors, resulting in a surge in selling activity surrounding this digital asset. Nonetheless, as retail takes fright, Ethereum whales are now taking advantage of the prevailing bearish sentiment, as they have commenced purchasing substantial quantities of ETH at current discounted prices.\n\nLate Tuesday, Ethereum whales made a substantial move by purchasing approximately 260,000 Ether (ETH) in just 24 hours. Ali Martinez, a prominent cryptocurrency analyst, revealed this significant acquisition, amounting to nearly $425 million, on Twitter. The pundit shared a compelling chart from Santiment, showcasing the remarkable influx of capital into Ethereum despite prevailing market conditions.\n\nThis development unfolds against the backdrop of crypto prices remaining under pressure recently. Many have attributed Ether\u2019s weakness to dumping by big investors over the past four months, as well as prevailing regulatory challenges facing the crypto industry, particularly in the U.S.\n\nRecently, Brian Quinlivan, Santiment\u2019s marketing director, noted that large Ethereum (ETH) holders had exhibited bearish behaviour since around April, contrasting with their bullish stance observed in late 2022.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere has been about a 4-month long dump in supply from addresses holding between 10 and 10,000 ETH. They really were accumulating significantly at the end of last year, but profit taking from these key tiers happened hard and quickly right as the price was hitting around a 1-year high of approximately $2,120.\u201d Quinlivan wrote.\n\nJust yesterday, Santiment highlighted two whales who sent 300,000 Ether to Coinbase, raising fears of an imminent dump among traders.\n\nOn the other hand, an analyst known by the pseudonym \u201cgreatest trader\u201d from Cryptoquant linked Ether\u2019s continued weakness to future traders who have been actively selling.\n\nIn a post earlier this week, the analyst noted Ethereum\u2019s ongoing bearish trend, illustrated by a declining 30-day moving average of the taker buy-sell ratio, signals dominant bearish sentiment among futures traders. In reading this metric, values above one signify bullish sentiment, while values below one indicate bearish sentiment.\n\nThe pundit shared a chart which depicts the continuous decline in the taker buy-sell ratio over the past few months, consistently remaining below the pivotal one mark and reaching a yearly low.\n\n\u201cThis consistent behavior underscores the dominant bearish sentiment among futures traders participating in Ethereum\u2019s market.\u201d He wrote.\n\nThe analyst noted that for Ethereum\u2019s price to embark on a new bullish trajectory, it would require a shift in behaviour among futures traders, characterized by a more aggressive buying stance, as indicated by a metric rising above the critical one threshold.\n\nEther was trading at $1,636 at press time, barely up a percentage point over the past 24 hours."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nEarn a free on-chain certificate touting your knowledge of Ethereum by taking Decrypt U's free course, Getting Started with Ethereum.\n\nAs of September 2023, Ethereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency in the world by total value, with a market capitalization of over $229 billion. Despite the fact that Ethereum\u2019s value is lower than that of rival Bitcoin, though, there is a good argument to be made that Ethereum is more important for the crypto and blockchain spaces overall than its larger competitor. Since its launch in 2015, the Ethereum network has been instrumental in powering the next generation of decentralized applications (dApps) and, more recently, the world of decentralized finance (DeFi) more broadly.\n\nThis is thanks to Ethereum\u2019s powerful smart contracts capabilities and versatility. As of March 2023, protocols built using the Ethereum network were responsible for about 90%, or $90 billion, of the total value locked in DeFi.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nJust as Ethereum is a critical component of the crypto world and one that has shaped the development of the industry since its launch, the network\u2019s founder Vitalik Buterin is similarly influential. The Russian-Canadian programmer and writer\u2014who is not yet 30 years old as of this writing\u2014is arguably the single most famous individual in the world of cryptocurrency today (another prime candidate for this title, Bitcoin founder Satoshi Nakamoto, is a pseudonymous name potentially representing more than one real person). Who is Vitalik Buterin, and how did he come to create Ethereum?\n\nEarly Interests Led to Crypto\n\nButerin was born in Russia but moved to Canada at a young age, where he was quickly recognized for his strong abilities in math. His earliest experiences with programming and crypto came at home, as his father was a computer scientist. Notably, Buterin\u2019s early experience with the massively multiplayer online role-playing game World of Warcraft may have contributed to his desire to work outside of the traditional, centralized economics space: although a devoted player, he quit the game when developers made a change to the rules that he disagreed with.\n\nThrough high school and into college, Buterin honed his programming abilities and connected with influential mentors like the cryptographer Ian Goldberg, known for his involvement with the Tor Project among other things. It was during this time that he also first learned of Bitcoin, in 2011. Buterin wrote blog articles on cryptocurrency to earn his first BTC, eventually co-founding and contributing to Bitcoin Magazine.\n\nCollege Years and Ethereum Origins\n\nAs a student at the University of Waterloo, Buterin assisted Goldberg until his work in cryptocurrency began to take up a substantial portion of his time. At this stage, he left university to travel the world for several months to connect with Bitcoin developers. This experience was crucial to Buterin\u2019s development of the Ethereum model, as he felt that the developers he met were all too concerned with specific uses for cryptocurrency. Buterin came to believe that the next generation of blockchain systems should be more versatile and broader.\n\nButerin\u2019s interest in broadening Bitcoin\u2019s scope led him to pursue a Turing-complete programming language to realize his vision. The young programmer created an initial white paper for this concept, which he called Ethereum, in 2013. Venture capitalist Peter Thiel\u2019s eponymous Fellowship awarded Buterin a grant of $100,000 in 2014, allowing him to fully focus his efforts on developing the new ecosystem.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBetween Buterin\u2019s initial white paper in 2013 and Ethereum\u2019s eventual launch many months later, the vision developed to encompass much more than just a digital currency, adding ideas about smart contracts, decentralized applications, and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) as well. By early 2014, Buterin was ready to share this wider concept with the crypto community, and he formally announced the project in January. An initial coin offering followed, raising about $18 million worth of BTC and allowing Buterin and his development team to launch the Ethereum Foundation to oversee Ethereum\u2019s continued growth. In July 2015, Ethereum officially launched.\n\nActivity Since Ethereum\u2019s Launch\n\nThe story of Ethereum is one of prolonged success (although not entirely free of setbacks as well), as the platform is now responsible for settling trillions of dollars worth of transactions each year. Indeed, the number of Ethereum transactions eclipsed the number of Bitcoin transactions in 2021. It has also been instrumental as the foundational network supporting movements like non-fungible tokens, a host of altcoins, and much more.\n\nButerin has continued to play a highly active role in Ethereum\u2019s success since launch. He has also been outspoken about what he sees as the ongoing dangers of centralized banking and currency control, making him a potent advocate for the crypto world even beyond his own network and token.\n\nButerin has also spoken out against what he sees as a potential \u201cdystopian\u201d future for the cryptocurrency industry in which ultra-wealthy whales fail to capitalize on the power of crypto to fight against authoritarian governments. He has pushed for Ethereum to play a role in making voting systems more fair, in helping to provide universal basic income, in supporting urban planning initiatives and public-works projects, and more. This may be one reason why Buterin was a particularly vocal supporter of The Merge, the late-2022 seismic shift in which Ethereum moved from a proof-of-work model to a proof-of-stake one. The Merge is expected to dramatically reduce the Ethereum network\u2019s energy consumption and to lower costs. Additionally, Buterin is known for his philanthropy, as he donated $1.2 billion to India\u2019s Covid relief fund in 2021, to several projects supporting Ukraine following Russia\u2019s invasion in 2022, and additional funds to a variety of research foundations."
