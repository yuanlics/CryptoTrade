        "content": "Since the BTC ETF narrative gripped the market last year, traders have been looking at ether as the next likely candidate to get a spot ETF approval in the U.S. Reflecting this sentiment is the discount to net asset value (NAV) for the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE), which has been contracting since the summer, and has lingered around 12% over the last two months, according to JPMorgan."

        "content": "Ethereum price struggled to rise above $2,550 and $2,580. ETH started a fresh decline like Bitcoin and traded below the $2,500 support zone.\n\nEthereum attempted a fresh increase but failed to surpass $2,550.\n\nThe price is trading below $2,500 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance near $2,480 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair continue to move down if there is a move below the $2,425 support.\n\nEthereum Price Extends Decline\n\nEthereum price struggled to gain pace for a move above the $2,550 and $2,580 resistance levels. ETH formed a short-term top and started a fresh decline below $2,500 like Bitcoin.\n\nThere was a move below the $2,450 level. A new weekly low was formed near $2,424 and the price is now consolidating losses. There was a minor increase above the $2,450 level, but the bears were active near the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2,614 swing high to the $2,424 low.\n\nEthereum is now trading below $2,500 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $2,465 level. The next hurdle could be $2,480. There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance near $2,480 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.\n\nThe next major resistance is now near $2,520. A clear move above the $2,520 level might start a decent increase. In the stated case, the price could rise toward the $2,580 level.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nThe next key hurdle sits near the $2,620 zone. A close above the $2,620 resistance could start another steady increase. The next key resistance is near $2,680. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2,720 zone.\n\nMore Losses in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $2,520 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,440 level.\n\nThe next key support could be the $2,425 zone. A downside break below the $2,425 support might send the price further lower. In the stated case, Ether could test the $2,350 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,320 level.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bearish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $2,425\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $2,520\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.
