        "content": "Polygon Labs has suggested that the Celo blockchain community consider utilizing its Chain Development Kit (CDK) to streamline the intended layer-2 migration on the Ethereum network.\n\nThe proposal comes after cLabs, the primary development team behind Celo, unveiled an alternative strategy in July to transition its layer-1 into an Ethereum-compatible layer-2 solution by utilizing Optimism\u2019s OP Stack. OP Stack is a similar customizable toolkit that leverages Optimism\u2019s \u201coptimistic\u201d technology.\n\nMove to Ethereum Layer-2 Via Polygon CDK\n\nPolygon Labs\u2019 co-founder Sandeep Nailwal presented a proposal to the Celo community this week recommending that the blockchain ecosystem consider implementing Polygon\u2019s Chain Development Kit, which is a codebase enabling developers to build customized layer-2 chains leveraging zero-knowledge (ZK) technology.\n\nThe proposal on the Celo governance forum stated,\n\n\u201cPolygon Labs is excited to welcome Celo home to Ethereum in the chain\u2019s transition from an independent EVM-compatible L1 to an Ethereum L2. As Ethereum devotees obsessed with scaling, we are beyond excited to see Celo expand into an emerging and thriving Ethereum ecosystem and help extend Ethereum blockspace.\u201d\n\nNailwal explained that this shift would enable Celo to fully leverage the benefits of operating as an Ethereum layer-2 solution while preserving the fundamental traits that initially propelled the chain to success.\n\nThe exec further emphasized that the transition represents a significant technical enhancement, \u201cthat should come with built-in Ethereum alignment and as-close-as-possible developer experience, without compromising security.\u201d\n\nPolygon CDK\n\nThe Polygon CDK toolkit was released in August, designed to allow developers to build blockchain networks with the help of ZK proofs. This open-source codebase offers developers the ability to interconnect chains through a ZK-based bridge, creating a unified ecosystem referred to as the \u201cValue Layer.\u201d\n\nSubsequently, Cosmos-based layer-1 blockchain, Canto, announced migrating to a zero-knowledge layer-2 on Ethereum via Polygin CDK. The platform explained that this transition is in line with its objectives to build a blockchain dedicated to real-world assets(RWA).\n\nBesides Canto, pther projects such as Astar, Gnosis, and IDEX, have already announced plans to build ZK layer-2 solutions utilizing the toolkit."

        "title": "ETH Burn Mechanism Struggles Amid Interest Gain Projection - DailyCoin",
        "content": "Cryptocurrency markets have responded cautiously to hints of a Federal Reserve rate hike.\n\nCrypto capitalization has experienced a $30 billion reduction amid uncertain economic signals.\n\nEthereum\u2019s burn mechanism has encountered challenges as new ETH has entered the supply.\n\nIn response to the Federal Reserve\u2019s recent hints at a potential interest rate hike later this year, the digital asset market experienced a tentative sell-off this week. Despite the Fed\u2019s decision to maintain current interest rates on Wednesday, the prospect of an impending hike has cast uncertainty over the market.\n\nCrypto Market Sheds $30B as Fed Proposes Interest Rate Rise\n\nThe central bank\u2019s projections, unveiled alongside their announcement, indicate a median interest rate of 5.6% by the end of this year. This marks an uptick from the current range of 5.25% to 5.5%. The proposed rate increase received support from 12 Federal Reserve officials, while 9 opposed the idea.\n\nAccording to data from CoinMarketCap, the cryptocurrency market witnessed a decline of $30 billion in its overall capitalization. As a result, the combined capitalization now stands at $1.05 trillion, following a 3% retracement. Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) experienced a 2.5% and 3% drop, respectively, after the news, although they managed to regain roughly 1% since.\n\nETH\u2019s Burning Mechanism Challenged by Increase in Supply\n\nAdding to the situation\u2019s complexity, the close of September will also coincide with the expiration of $3 billion worth of quarterly Bitcoin options and $1.8 billion in contracts linked to ETH.\n\nEthereum\u2019s on-chain activity in September has been the weakest throughout the year. According to Ultra Sound Money, over 13,000 ETH (equivalent to $21 million) has been introduced into Ethereum\u2019s supply since the beginning of the month.\n\nThis suggests that Ethereum\u2019s burn mechanism has failed to counterbalance the influx of new ETH entering the supply as rewards for validators, particularly during this period of reduced activity.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nWhile the crypto market did see a retracement following the Fed\u2019s announcement, factors beyond the interest rate decision could have influenced their prices.\n\nEthereum\u2019s on-chain activity may have declined in September, but this could be attributed to various factors, including market sentiment and investor behavior, rather than solely the failure of the burn mechanism.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nThe Federal Reserve\u2019s potential interest rate hike and the resultant market fluctuations underscore the vulnerability of digital assets to macroeconomic shifts. This is a stark reminder of the crypto market\u2019s interconnectedness with traditional financial systems and the need for vigilance among crypto enthusiasts and investors.\n\nTo learn more about the challenges Ethereum faces amidst record-low fees, read here:\n\nETH Price Struggles Continue Despite Record-Low Network Fees\n\n\n\nTo stay updated on the recent mysterious XRP transfers involving millions, click here:\n\nMillions of XRP Moved in Mysterious Internal Transfers"

        "content": "The biggest cryptocurrency of all time, Bitcoin, gained much traction much after its inception. The reason is simple, anything new with potential finally makes it to the top. Following the trend, Ethereum, a similar type but with a much improved concept, was soon to climb the ladder of fame.\n\nThe evolution of Ethereum also spiked traders\u2019 interests. Over the years, Ethereum has become the second largest cryptocurrency in the world. However, despite the technological spike, the coin couldn\u2019t surpass Bitcoin. Will it ever? How high will Ethereum go? Let\u2019s delve into the topic and understand where this coin is going in the future.\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum Price History\n\nLet us take a quick look at Ethereum\u2019s historical price performance before getting into price prediction. The price of Ethereum (ETH) has fluctuated significantly since its launch in 2015. ETH first surpassed the $10 threshold in March 2016, despite experiencing a sizable surge after its launch.\n\nThe price of ETH increased more noticeably in late 2016 and early 2017 as a result of the Ethereum network\u2019s rising popularity, which was largely brought on by the proliferation of initial coin offerings (ICOs). The price of Ethereum skyrocketed past $1,000, peaking at about $1,400 in January 2018.\n\nHowever, this price increase came after a significant decline during the ensuing crypto winter. ETH\u2019s cost plunged to an all-time low of $80 in December 2018. However, with the start of the subsequent bullish market cycle, Ethereum started to climb steadily, occasionally experiencing minor corrections, eventually reaching a new peak of about $2,000 in May 2021.\n\nAs the bull market came to an end in November 2021, the price of ETH hit an all-time high of $4,891.70. Unfortunately, numerous crypto disasters, bankruptcies, and an unfavourable global macroeconomic environment all served to exacerbate the bear market.\n\nHow High Will Ethereum Go?\n\nAs the chart indicates, Ethereum has been receiving long term support since 2020. However, a major resistance was also created around $2038. It is the same period, when Ethereum was seen touching its all time high of $4868.\n\nHowever, Ethereum suffered a lot in 2022. In, 2023 is here with all the positive news, starting with the upgrade and switch to proof of stake (PoS). While writing the price prediction, Ethereum was at $1,858. There is a $222,970,691,577 USD market cap. The maximum supply is not known, but there are 120,245,588 ETH coins in circulation.\n\nIn the coming years, Ethereum price is predicted to range as high as $4,204.12 and $5,063.95, respectively. The typical anticipated trading expense is $4,355.45. By 2030, the price can rise up to $15,000.\n\nThe anticipations about Ethereum is quite positive. The coming period for the coin holds high expectations from traders, as well as, developers.\n\nMarket cap $196,632,048,264 ROI 65610.57% All Time High (Nov 16, 2021) $4,891.70 All Time Low (Oct 21, 2015) $0.4209\n\nUnderstanding the Idea Behind Creating Ethereum\n\nBitcoin was launched to test two main features that were missing in the financial system \u2013 permissionless transactions and cryptography. It sought to use the stern tenacity of cryptography to investigate the potential of the decentralized database. It could send values across the world without the involvement of intermediaries. However, it was missing an important feature of turning into a complete scripting language. But, do you know who had the solution? Yes, you guessed it right, Ethereum.\n\nThe idea behind Ethereum was to make it simplest, even though there might be data storage incompetence or higher time usage. As envisioned, Ethereum soon received the deserved reaction among the technological prophets. And now, after more than a decade, it has evolved into a technology that is more meticulous than Bitcoin.\n\nEthereum has played a pivotal role in the development of the blockchain and cryptocurrency ecosystem, and it has been the foundation for a multitude of decentralized applications and projects in areas like decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and more. Its continued evolution and upgrades are aimed at addressing scalability and security concerns to ensure its long-term viability as a blockchain platform.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, Ethereum is a transformative digital currency that has disrupted traditional finance. Its underlying blockchain technology has the potential to revolutionize various industries. As you embark on your journey into the world of Ethereum, remember to stay informed, practice security measures, and explore the endless possibilities this cryptocurrency offers.\n\n1. Is Ethereum Legal? Yes, Ethereum is legal in most countries. However, it\u2019s essential to check your local regulations.\n\n2. How Do I Acquire Ethreum? You can acquire Ethreum through exchanges, mining, or by accepting it as payment for goods and services."
