        "content": "Advertisement\n\nAfter the activation of EIP 1559 (periodic burn of Ethereum (ETH) fees based on network activity dynamics), Ethereum (ETH) became deflationary, as the number of tokens issued is lower than number of ETH burned. However, the dramatically low on-chain activity puts an end to this status of second largest cryptocurrency.\n\nEthereum (ETH) becomes inflationary thanks to market exhaustion\n\nIn the last 30 days, Ethereum (ETH) registered a net increase in the number of coins in its supply. A total of 63,490 Ethers (ETH) were burned, while 65,548 Ethers (ETH) were issued. As such, 2,058 \"new\" coins were added to Ethereum's (ETH) circulating supply, per statistics tracked by Ultrasound Money analytical dashboard.\n\nImage by Ultrasound Money\n\nAfter the activation of Ethereum's EIP 1559 mechanism, such periods of \"inflationary\" status occur periodically. The ongoing \"dip,\" though, is a special one: the Ethereum (ETH) burn rate declines faster, so the delta between the \"ETH issued\" and \"ETH burned\" numbers increases aggressively.\n\nIn the past year, the Ethereum (ETH) supply has fallen by over 300,000 ETH thanks to the activation of EIP 1559. The ongoing anomaly should be attributed to super-low activity of Ethereum (ETH) accounts.\n\nAccording to multiple trackers, ETH gas metrics are close to 2023 lows or have even dropped below them. For instance, CoinMetrics sees a mean ETH fee below $2.5, which is the lowest level since January 2023.\n\nOne OpenSea sale can therefore be confirmed for as low as $3, while on-chain swaps via Uniswap (UNI) will be charged with $7.6.\n\nMEV bot became top Ethereum (ETH) gas spender\n\nAmid the apathetic performance of on-chain actors, MEV bot becomes the most productive spender of Ethereum (ETH) gas. As covered by U.Today previously, Jared From Subway, the operator of the most effective MEV bots, paid over $70 million in gas since being launched in February 2023.\n\nThe bot made over 1.1 million transactions but paid more in gas fees than the wallets of exchanges that used Ethereum (ETH) 10 times more frequently.\n\nPer the statistics, during periods of pale market performance, Ethereum (ETH) MEV bots \u2014 mechanisms for frontrunning transactions by paying extra gas fees \u2014 might be responsible for 80-90% of top DEXes' trading volumes."

        "content": "A widely followed crypto analyst says that a massive crash for the leading smart contract platform is within the realm of possibility.\n\nIn a new strategy session, crypto trader Benjamin Cowen tells his 787,000 YouTube subscribers that a freefall to the $400-$800 range is in the cards for Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest crypto asset by market cap.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a good chance that [there will] be a lower low, and it might not be a much lower low, maybe it just goes down to just below $800. It could go lower. It could go to $600 or $500 or $400, but that is in the cards for Ethereum.\u201d\n\nCowen also says that a move toward his downside targets would mark 2023 as the year when both ETH bulls and bears got \u201csufficiently wrecked.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou could have a move where it sort of just slowly fades with some occasional pumps back up to the upside just to get everyone excited, and then down into the end of the year and then pop back up, right.\n\nIt could do something like that \u2013 where it puts in a low, it puts in a high it then sweeps the high, and then sweeps the low. That way, by the end of the pre-halving year, both the bulls and the bears are sufficiently wrecked.\n\nThen you went through the whole year and both sides thought they were right for the whole year, but they were really right for only half the year and the other side was right for the other half of the year, but by the end of the year, everyone\u2019s wrecked.\u201d\n\nThe crypto strategist goes on to say that for the rest of 2023, he expects Ethereum to post lower highs and lower lows.\n\nEthereum is trading for $1,609 at time of writing, a 1.2% decrease during the last 24 hours.\n\nI\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Ethereum price failed to settle above $1,650 and trimmed gains against the US Dollar. ETH is now trading in a bearish zone and could decline heavily.\n\nEthereum peaked near $1,670 and started a fresh decline.\n\nThe price is trading below $1,650 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $1,620 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair could gain bearish momentum if there is a close below $1,600 and $1,580.\n\nEthereum Price Turns Red\n\nEthereum\u2019s price attempted a fresh increase above the $1,620 pivot level. ETH even broke the $1,650 resistance but the bears were active near the $1,670 level.\n\nAs a result, the price failed to continue higher and started a fresh decline below $1,650, like Bitcoin. There was a downside break below the $1,620 level and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. The price even retested the $1,600 support zone.\n\nA low is formed near $1,600 and the price is now consolidating losses. Ether is now trading below $1,650 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. Besides, there is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $1,620 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The trend line is close to the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1,669 swing high to the $1,600 low.\n\nOn the upside, the price might face resistance near the $1,620 level and the trend line. The next resistance is near the $1,635 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1,669 swing high to the $1,600 low.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nThe first major resistance is near $1,650, above which the price could rise toward the $1,670 level. The next major hurdle is near the $1,700 level. A close above the $1,700 level might send Ethereum further higher toward $1,750.\n\nDownside Break in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $1,620 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,600 level.\n\nThe first key support is close to $1,580. The next key support is $1,540. A downside break below $1,540 might start a major decline toward $1,450. If there is a downside break below $1,450, the price could test the $1,320 support level.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is slowly gaining momentum in the bearish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $1,600\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $1,650\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "Ethereum Is Losing Favor Among Institutional Investors: CoinShares - Decrypt",
        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nInstitutions have fallen out of love with Ethereum in 2023, selling upwards of nine digits of the asset in the year to date.\n\nAccording to the latest analysis by CoinShares, the number two cryptocurrency saw $4.8 million in outflows this past week, reaching $108 million in sales this year. That places it as the most sold digital asset by large entities, wrote James Butterfill, head of research for CoinShares.\n\nThe analyst labeled it the \u201cleast loved digital asset\u201d for exchange-traded product (ETP) investors, trouncing its second-place holder, Tron, by more than $50 million.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHowever, all that could change soon after Cathie Wood\u2019s Ark Invest applied for the first spot Ethereum ETF last week\u2014the first of its kind in the United States. And that news comes after the network turned inflationary and on-chain activity plummeted as the grueling bear market carries on.\n\nWhat Ethereum has felt this year is broadly based among digital assets, per CoinShares.\n\nSentiment regarding institutions purchasing crypto remains poor, according to their weekly report published this morning. It showed a fourth consecutive week of selling, with outflows totaling $59 million over the past seven days.\n\nThe current run of outflows, wrote James Butterfill, reaches $294 million, representing 0.9% of total assets under management (AUM).\n\nSelling came primarily from North America, with Canada and the United States offloading $17.6 million and $12.3 million in the past seven days. Germany led the way across the Atlantic and into Europe, with $20 million worth of selling.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nButterfill told Decrypt that the main reason behind the rampant selling is the U.S. dollar. It has shown strength as of late, driven by the \u201cmarket\u2019s belief we are in a soft landing scenario,\u201d posting eight straight weeks of green candles.\n\nEven so, he reckons that as the year ends, it will \u201cincreasingly be seen that this isn\u2019t the case,\u201d especially if high-interest rates kick in.\n\nAlthough the previous report by CoinShares highlighted a bunch of under-the-surface trading, with volumes skyrocketing by 90% to $2.8 billion, this week's trading activity plummeted.\n\nVolumes \u201care super low,\u201d revealed Butterfill, averaging \u201cjust\u201d $2.3 billion daily over the past month, compared to the yearly average of $7 billion. The last seven days were an even further cry from these numbers, dropping by 73% to $743 million.\n\nThis suggests, the analyst told Decrypt, an \u201capathetic investor\u201d\u2014clarifying, however, that the market saw a very similar scenario prior to the last two Bitcoin halvings.\n\nBitcoin was the most damaged crypto asset last week, with large entities offloading a whopping $69 million worth of the asset despite being in the green the week prior.\n\nAdding to the bearishness, Bitcoin short products saw the largest weekly inflows since March, with $15 million pouring into these instruments. \u201cTiming wise this is interesting as the inflows in March also came at a time of heightened regulatory uncertainty,\u201d said Butterfill.\n\nWhat\u2019s to come? Butterfill suspects that many investors are waiting to see what the Fed will do this month with interest rates, with any potential weakness in the dollar \u201clikely to be supportive for Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe analyst concluded, however, that CPI could come in above expectations due to the swift surge in gasoline prices. He also pointed to FTX, telling Decrypt, \"There are the FTX asset sales \u2018stock overhangs\u2019 potentially to deal with too.\u201d"
