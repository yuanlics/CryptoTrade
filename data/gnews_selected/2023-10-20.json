        "content": "Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin is facing a lawsuit from more than two dozen former Consensys employees, accusing him, Consensys and other parties of maneuvering valuable assets out of its Swiss holding company.\n\nThe complaint was filed in New York state court on Thursday. It claims assets \u2014 including its web3 wallet MetaMask, partly developed by some of the plaintiffs \u2014 were transferred out of Consensys AG, leaving them with worthless shares.\n\nLubin allegedly arranged to move the assets to a new U.S.-based company, CSI, in 2020, so it could solicit outside investment, with the help of Consensys General Counsel Matt Corva, enabling Lubin to replace the plaintiffs with Wall Street investors.\n\nLubin also brought in investment bank JPMorgan, who, in exchange for its own blockchain business, Quorum, received 10% of CSI, according to the complaint. Corva, JPMorgan and Umar Farooq, Global Head of Blockchain at JPMorgan, are also listed as defendants.\n\n'He broke his word'\n\nWhen Lubin established Consensys in 2014, many employees accepted lower salaries with the understanding they would receive company equity, according to the suit. Lubin reportedly dedicated 30% of the company to employee stock, with the suing party holding about 9% of that portion.\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nLegal representatives for the former employees argue that while Lubin prospered, those who believed in his early vision and accepted stock over higher pay ended up with empty promises. \u201cHe broke his word,\u201d the lawyers wrote. \u201cIn the process, he violated his legal commitments and duties. While Lubin got rich, plaintiffs got nothing.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlaintiffs in an ongoing shareholder case against the Swiss-based web3 incubator and investor Consensys AG, which operates as Consensys Mesh, have just filed suit against U.S. blockchain software developer Consensys Software Inc. in New York state court,\u201d a Consensys spokesperson told The Block via email.\n\n\u201cAfter two years of getting nowhere with their frivolous claims against Consensys Mesh in a Swiss court, plaintiffs now believe their meritless claims stand a better chance of yielding a pay day if they game U.S. courts and entangle Consensys Software and other unrelated parties in litigation,\u201d the spokesperson added. \u201cWe fully expect that the plaintiffs, who were never employees of Consensys Software, will soon find this gambit is another fruitless attempt to enrich themselves from the success of others.\u201d\n\nCSI has raised at least $726.7 million from investors, according to the suit, with its valuation rising to more than $7 billion following Series D financing."

        "title": "Ethereum network fees hit 2023 lows, on-chain activities rise - crypto.news",
        "content": "Ethereum network fees are currently at their lowest point in 2023.\n\nThe Ethereum (ETH) blockchain witnessed a significant reduction in network fees, with users paying a mere $1.15 per transaction, Santiment data shows. The current decline in Ethereum\u2019s transaction fees carries with it a historical pattern that bodes well for the network\u2019s utility.\n\nAs transaction fees drop, Ethereum becomes a cheaper choice for users to interact with its versatile platform. This development holds the promise of boosting Ethereum\u2019s overall market value.\n\nLately, there has been a notable rise in the level of on-chain transactions within the Ethereum network. The figure, totaling 1,089,893 user active wallets (UAW), marks the second-highest activity level in Ethereum\u2019s history. Blockchain analysts at Santiment noted that such spikes in on-chain activity could be a signal for potential price rebounds.\n\nYou might also like: Ethereum unveils new testnet called \u2018Hole\u0161ky\u2019\n\nThis increased activity suggests growing interest and utility in the Ethereum network, which may positively impact its market capitalization in the coming months.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/santimentfeed/status/1705401195152789888\n\nWhile the wider cryptocurrency landscape sees significant price dips, Ethereum has remained above the $1,500 mark.\n\nIn June, analysts expressed optimism in the world\u2019s second-largest crypto, with some predicting Ethereum\u2019s ascent to a historic high of $3,000. What fuels this bullish sentiment is the remarkable dwindling of ETH reserves on exchanges, plunging to an unprecedented low of 12.6%.\n\nThis scarcity of Ethereum in exchange wallets underscores the platform\u2019s robust demand, offering a compelling narrative amidst turbulent crypto seas. This scarcity of tokens available for sale on centralized exchanges is considered a bullish sign of Ethereum\u2019s future performance.\n\nGrayscale floats Ethereum Futures ETF application\n\nIn a significant move, Grayscale recently filed an application for an Ethereum futures-based exchange-traded fund (ETF). This application follows a previous filing under the Securities Act of 1933, the same regulatory framework governing commodities and spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs.\n\nNotably, Grayscale\u2018s filing for an Ethereum futures ETF marks an important distinction, as the SEC has previously approved Bitcoin futures ETFs under both the Securities Act of 1933 and the Investment Company Act of 1940, which regulates most security-based ETFs. This move by Grayscale reflects the growing institutional interest in Ethereum.\n\nIn the midst of Ethereum\u2019s journey, co-founder Vitalik Buterin\u2019s voice resonates with a clear vision. Buterin places a strong emphasis on two pivotal pillars: privacy and decentralization. These principles, he asserts, are not mere aspirations but core priorities guiding Ethereum\u2019s path forward.\n\nIn a crypto landscape marked by change, Buterin\u2019s commitment to these ideals illuminates Ethereum\u2019s enduring quest for a more private, decentralized, and inclusive digital future\n\nHe expressed concerns about the vulnerability of centralized entities like custodial exchanges, which can be easily corrupted. Buterin advocates for direct transactions on the Ethereum blockchain to empower users and enhance security.\n\nYou might also like: Ethereum goes red as active addresses, deposits spike\n\nEthereum price analysis\n\nAfter facing resistance on July 14, Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) price has been on a downward trend. Today, ETH is trading at $1,593, reflecting a 2.7% price decline in one week. Ethereum\u2019s market capitalization stands above $191 billion, according to CoinGecko.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) of Ether on the weekly timeframe currently stands at 21.8, indicating a potential oversold condition. Ethereum has a critical support level of $1,500.\n\nWhile Ethereum\u2019s recent price decline may worry investors, its fundamental developments and growing institutional interest suggest a promising future.\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "title": "Did Lido fly too close to the sun? Inside the centralization debate - Blockworks",
        "content": "Lido, the largest liquid staking service provider on Ethereum, is approaching 33% market dominance. This state of affairs has raised concerns about centralization and the protocol being a threat to Ethereum\u2019s security.\n\nAt the time of writing, Lido\u2019s staking market share sits at 31.76%. This means that of all the staked ether on Ethereum, almost one-third of it is staked with Lido.\n\nDanny Ryan, an Ethereum Foundation researcher, noted in a 2022 blog post that if a liquid staking derivative (LSD) exceeds the 33% threshold, it has the theoretical capability to manipulate block space, potentially creating an economic monopoly.\n\nThis sentiment is shared by the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s Mike Neuder, who identified in a blog post three possible attack vectors on the network: holders of Lido\u2019s stETH product, node operators who run validators for the network, and Lido\u2019s DAO.\n\nOf the three, Neuder said the DAO presents the greatest risk, writing that the \u201csoft power\u201d held by DAO members would allow them undue influence over the protocol.\n\nIn a series of interviews, Blockworks spoke with those who\u2019ve raised the alarm that Lido\u2019s dominance may be a pernicious force, as well as members of the Lido development team who argue that the threats to Ethereum\u2019s economic security are overstated.\n\nRead more: Lido Finance drops Solana staking after DAO decision\n\nWhy Lido might present cause for concern\n\nLido DAO\u2019s largest token holders include several funds. Paradigm holds 7% of the total supply of LDO, Lido\u2019s governance token, making it the second-biggest whale, according to a dashboard from Arkham Intelligence. FalconX and Dragonfly Capital are also among the top holders of LDO.\n\nIan Unsworth, contributor to the liquid staking firm Stride, said the funds holding Lido (LDO) tokens are unlikely to liquidate their positions or maliciously attack the DAO. Still, investment funds have to return value to clients, and value creation could, someday, theoretically conflict with the principles of Ethereum.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, you should probably assume everyone is a profit maxi,\u201d Unsworth said. \u201cPeople aren\u2019t going to [govern the DAO] because they like the ethos.\u201d\n\nIf profit maximization means passing proposals meant to degrade Ethereum for personal gain, the DAO is not equipped to stop it, according to Nixo, the pseudonymous executive director of EthStaker.\n\nDAO members typically delegate votes to larger holders, meaning proposals can pass without much attention. This could lead to under-the-radar misdeeds, Nixo said.\n\n\u201cIt could be Apple knocking on the door and saying, \u2018Hey, we would really like to push this [proposal] through in some sort of clandestine way,\u2019\u201d Nixo said, adding that nefarious DAO actors could also punish node operators who act against their wishes.\n\nNotably, the damage Lido\u2019s ability to censor transactions or attack Ethereum grows at 50% and 66% of staked validator share, according to Ryan\u2019s blog post. Nixo said hitting 33% dominance would signal to potential bad actors that higher thresholds are possible without excessive community pushback.\n\nEven if Lido\u2019s DAO is composed of model Ethereans, growing dominance from the liquid staking provider threatens one of the network\u2019s chief value propositions \u2014 its censorship resistance.\n\n\u201c[Lido dominance] erodes the credible neutrality of Ethereum, which in turn devalues Ethereum itself,\u201d Kevin Weaver, a backend engineer at Metropolis, said.\n\nLido\u2019s response to centralization concerns\n\nKasper Rasmussen, a Lido Community Contributor, told Blockworks that Lido itself is an intermediary layer that facilitates interaction between Ethereum users and transparent, well-known Node Operators (NOs).\n\n\u201cThis process is underpinned by a network of 37 legitimate and autonomous NOs. These NOs are not only geographically dispersed, but each of them individually holds less than 1.5% of the total staked assets,\u201d Rasmussen said.\n\nBroader community governance will be achieved through the development of dual governance, Rasmussen said. Dual governance means LDO holders are not the only ones with governing power \u2014 Lido staked ether (stETH) holders can apply veto to votes if they choose to.\n\nThis means it\u2019s possible for stETH holders to engage in protocol governance without holding LDO tokens.\n\n\u201cThis ensures the protocol remains transparent, accountable and representative of the entire user base,\u201d Rasmussen said.\n\nThe Lido team is also working to expand the Lido Protocol\u2019s validator set. In September, it onboarded seven new node operators, Rasmussen noted.\n\n\u201cThis diversification serves as a protective measure against any single entity gaining control,\u201d he said.\n\nLido as an \u2018ideal\u2019 villain for Ethereum?\n\nEnshrining liquid staking decentralization in the protocol\u2019s code has generated buzz in Ethereum circles. Enshrinement could theoretically implement protocol updates that would make it impossible for liquid staking to become overly centralized.\n\nLido\u2019s DAO also considered, and ultimately rejected, a proposal that would have self-limited its staking dominance.\n\nWhether the solution to Lido dominance is reached through social pressure or by code updates, Lido says it is taking steps to stay aligned with Ethereum\u2019s ethos. For this reason, Nixo said Lido is an \u201cideal actor to be in the villain position\u201d on Ethereum.\n\nRead more: Ethereum is \u2018much more centralized than folks realize\u2019: Blocknative\u2019s Matt Cutler\n\n\u201cThis is highlighting a problem that the Ethereum protocol has \u2014 it\u2019s not a problem of an evil actor coming in,\u201d Nixo said. \u201cSo in a way this is good that this is happening\u2026the fact that ideas like that are coming to the surface in light of this debate from all sorts of sources is exactly what this social layer is meant to elicit.\u201d\n\nUpdated Oct. 20, 2023 at 11:30 am ET: A previous version of this article attributed information to \u201cthe company\u201d instead of a \u201cLido contributor.\u201d\n\nUpdated Oct. 20, 2023 at 11:12 am ET: Clarified for additional context.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."
