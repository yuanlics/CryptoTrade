        "content": "Advertisement\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin recently discussed the possibility of integrating more features directly into the Ethereum protocol.\n\nHistorically, the Ethereum project has aspired to maintain a core protocol with minimal complexity, encouraging building applications and solutions on top of it, also known as Layer-2 solutions.\n\nButerin, however, offered important discussions regarding maintaining a balance between protocol simplicity and advanced feature integrations.\n\nPhilosophy behind minimalist\n\nFrom its inception, Ethereum has embraced a minimalist philosophy, seeking to create a clean and simple core protocol and allowing innovations and advanced features to be built on top of it by users. This philosophy aimed to maintain a decentralized and user-empowering approach.\n\nHowever, Buterin acknowledges the growing interest in enshrining more features within the core Ethereum protocol. Enshrining, in this context, implies integrating advanced features and functionalities directly into the Ethereum protocol, which could potentially increase user convenience but may also pose challenges related to protocol complexity and governance.\n\nBenefits and trade-offs of new features\n\nEnshrining more features into the core protocol could help avoid potential centralization and mitigate risks in other areas of the blockchain ecosystem. It could offer standardized solutions, avoid complications arising from diverse independent implementations and enhance user flexibility and experience. However, Buterin emphasizes the caution required in this approach. Over-enshrining can complicate the protocol, overextend its governance, and may not always align with the evolving needs of the users. Hence, a balanced approach that maintains Ethereum's credible neutrality and aligns with user needs is crucial."

        "content": "KuCoin, one of the leading cryptocurrency exchanges, recently released its latest asset reserve certificate dated Sept. 29. The report shows a noticeable decrease in user assets across Bitcoin, Ethereum and Tether. Specifically, BTC assets dropped by 4% to 17,617.5, ETH assets decreased by 3% to 148,125, and USDT assets fell by 4% to 837 million, compared to the previous month's data.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to DefiLlama, KuCoin has experienced a net outflow of approximately $118 million in the past month. This outflow is significant and warrants a closer look at the current market dynamics that could be influencing these movements.\n\nKucoin released the latest (9-29) asset reserve certificate. The user's BTC assets were 17,617.5, a decrease of 4% from the last time (8-31); the user's ETH assets were 148,125, a decrease of 3%; the user's USDT assets were 837 million, 4% lower than last time.\u2026 \u2014 Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) October 1, 2023\n\nSeveral factors could be contributing to this trend. First, the overall market has been experiencing a period of uncertainty and volatility, which often leads to investors moving their assets to perceived safer havens.\n\nSecond, the regulatory landscape is becoming increasingly complex, with more countries tightening their grip on cryptocurrency exchanges. This could have led to a loss of confidence among KuCoin users, prompting them to withdraw their assets.\n\nAnother possibility is the rise of decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, which offer lucrative yield farming and staking opportunities. Investors might be reallocating their assets to these platforms in search of higher returns, thereby reducing their holdings on centralized exchanges like KuCoin.\n\nIt is also worth considering the impact of competition. With new exchanges and trading platforms entering the market, offering lower fees and additional features, users have more options than ever and may be exploring these alternatives."

        "content": "Ethereum Layer-2s have proven to be a solid line of defense against Layer-1s.\n\nEthereum\u2019s TVL outperformed Solana and Avalanche and could be gunning for market cap too.\n\nThe 2021 bull run exposed some major drawbacks in the Ethereum [ETH] blockchain. Thanks to this, the term \u201cEthereum killer\u201d gained traction as a way to describe the many competitive layers aiming for the top spot by attempting to overthrow the network\u2019s dominance.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ETHs worth today?\n\nFast-forward to the present, and Ethereum is still the most dominant PoS blockchain in some key areas. Layer Blockchains like Solana [SOL] and Avalanche [AVAX] have thus failed to dethrone Ethereum.\n\nThe latter\u2019s secret weapon is arguably its Layer-2 networks, which have allowed it to overcome the previously-existing scalability limitations.\n\nA recent Grayscale analysis revealed that Optimism [OP], Base, and Arbitrum [ARB], three Ethereum Layer-2s, have surpassed Avalanche and Solana in TVL.\n\nThis is because Ethereum is already miles ahead of its competition in terms of adoption and the dApps that operate on its network.\n\n?Following a period of strong growth, top performing Layer 2s #Arbitrum, #Optimism and #BASE are surpassing Ethereum competitor Layer 1s like Solana and Avalanche in terms of total value locked (TVL) as of 9/25.\n\nHere\u2019s why that\u2019s important. (1/6) pic.twitter.com/DpTJyLQ5Nj \u2014 Grayscale (@Grayscale) September 29, 2023\n\nLayer-2 networks successfully assist Ethereum in bypassing its previous limitations. The L2s facilitate transaction processing, allowing the dApps to operate efficiently and cost effectively. There is one key component that has allowed Layer-2 networks to surpass some Layer-1 blockchains.\n\nWhile the latter have to build up their own dApps and clientele, Layer-2s benefit from Ethereum\u2019s already existing dApps, of which there are plenty. On top of that, the same Layer-2s are also able to attract dApps on their own.\n\nLayer 2 blockchains process transactions from dApps and then \u201cbatch\u201d them together before sending a compressed version back to the main network for settlement, acting as a side road or even a dedicated bus lane augmenting a major highway. (2/6) \u2014 Grayscale (@Grayscale) September 29, 2023\n\nCan Ethereum Layer-2s secure market cap dominance?\n\nThese observations confirmed that Ethereum was still able to command robust utility and demand at press time. But while its Layer-2 networks enjoyed robust TVL growth, they were still lagging behind Solana and Avalanche in terms of market cap.\n\nAccording to the latest data, Solana\u2019s market cap was slightly over $8.8 billion, while Avalanche had a market cap of $3.27 billion at the time of writing. The closest of the aforementioned Layer-1s was Arbitrum at $1.17 billion, followed by Optimism at $1.06 billion.\n\nBase had the lowest market cap among them, at $530 million.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nIt makes sense that the Layer-2s would have lower market caps, considering that their counterparts are Layer-1 networks that have been around for longer. Nevertheless, the Layer-2 market caps highlighted their rapid growth.\n\nJudging by these factors, it is possible that they will get closer to Solana and Avalanche. These numbers also highlight the fact that it is now more difficult to beat Ethereum than ever before."
