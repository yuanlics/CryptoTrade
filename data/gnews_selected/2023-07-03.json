        "title": "Ethereum Price Looks Ready For Another Leg Higher Over $2,000 - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Ethereum price is gaining pace above $1,920 against the US Dollar. ETH could gain bullish momentum and might soon clear the $2,000 resistance.\n\nEthereum is attempting a fresh increase above the $1,920 zone.\n\nThe price is trading above $1,900 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance near $1,925 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair could rise steadily toward the $2,000 resistance in the near term.\n\nEthereum Price Aims Higher\n\nEthereum\u2019s price remained well-bid above the $1,820 support zone. ETH formed a support base and started a fresh increase above the $1,880 level, outperforming Bitcoin.\n\nThere was a clear move above the $1,920 resistance zone. Besides, there was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance near $1,925 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The price even traded to a new multi-day high at $1,960 and is currently consolidating gains.\n\nIt is now showing positive signs and might soon continue to rise toward the $2,000 resistance. Ether is now trading above $1,900 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. It is also above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $1,889 swing low to the $1,960 high.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nImmediate resistance is near the $1,960 level. The next major resistance is near the $2,000 level. A close above the $2,000 zone could start a fresh rally. The next resistance sits near $2,050, above which the price could rise toward the $2,120 level. Any more gains could send Ether toward the $2,220 resistance.\n\nAre Dips Limited in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $1,960 resistance or $1,980, it could start a downside correction. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,930 level.\n\nThe next major support is near the $1,920 level. It is close to the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $1,889 swing low to the $1,960 high. The first major support is near $1,900 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. If there is a move below $1,900, the price could drop toward $1,880. Any more losses may perhaps send the price toward the $1,840 support.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bullish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $1,900\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $1,960\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "Ethereum Price Prediction As ETH Takes On $2,000 \u2013 Is This The Bullish Escape To $5,000? - CoinGape",
        "content": "Ethereum price is doubling down its bullish efforts after reclaiming support at $1,900 and extending the leg to $1,950. The second largest smart contracts token, powered by a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, is up 1.6% on the day and trading at $1,945 on Monday.\n\nBitcoin price is also slightly in the green with 0.5% in accrued gains over the last 24 hours and doddering at $30,660. As analyzed earlier, BTC is poised for a massive breakout to $35,000 and $38,000, but first, the resistance between $31,000 and $32,000 must come out of the way.\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum boasts approximately $8 billion in its 24-hour trading volume and a market cap of $234 billion. Its immediate downside is protected by the recently reclaimed ascending trendline support, but if declines intensify, it would be prudent for investors to anticipate a minor and brief retracement to stronger support at $1,800 and $1,650, respectively.\n\nHow Will Investors React To Ethereum Price Lifting Above $2,000?\n\nThe sudden interest in the crypto market by institutional investors like Blackrock, Fidelity Investments, and Cathie Wood was a substantial boost for the crypto market in June.\n\nBlackrock\u2019s decision to apply for a spot Bitcoin ETF has, within a few weeks, encouraged other players like Cathie Wood and Fidelity to cast their nets with the hope of operating a similar product in the US.\n\nMarket participants believe Blackrock has a higher chance of getting the coveted approval, which the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has managed to avoid for several years, citing market volatility and manipulation, among other bottlenecks.\n\nAs more institutional investors stream into the market, major digital assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum are bound to react positively. Retail investors also see this as a signal that the market is on an upward trajectory.\n\nEthereum\u2019s sturdiness from support at $1,650 can mainly be attributed to the rise in interest from institutional and retail investors combined.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that with Ethereum holding above $1,900 and particularly on top of the dotted rising trendline, the path with the least resistance gradually turns to the upside. That said, the anticipated breakout above $2,000 is, at the time of writing, a matter of when and not if.\n\nEvaluating Ethereum Price Bullish Outlook\n\nTwo indicators affirm the bullish outlook for Ethereum price, starting with a buy signal from the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator. This call to buy Ether triggered on June 20, has managed to keep investor interest intact, but resistance at $2,000 is the biggest stumbling block, at least for now.\n\nA second bullish signal emanates from the SuperTrend indicator, which like the MACD, flipped in support of an Ethereum uptrend on June 20. Like a moving average, this indicator overlays the chart, but it also integrates readings from the true average range (ATR) to gauge the volatility in the market.\n\nAs long as the SuperTrend is trailing Ethereum price, recovery to $2,000 will remain steady. Traders may want to confirm ETH closes the day above the dotted trendline and the buyer congestion at $1,900 to validate the expected breakout beyond the psychological resistance.\n\nThe fear of missing out (FOMO) could suddenly be the driving force for Ethereum price targeting the ultimate move to $3,000 and subsequently climbing to the all-time high of $4,878.\n\nRelated Articles"

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nDespite certain limitations and potential risks, the idea of using Ethereum (ETH) as a layer-2 for the Solana (SOL) blockchain is not as farfetched as it may seem, according to Anatoly Yakovenko, the co-founder of Solana Labs.\n\nIn a series of tweets on Sunday, Yakovenko took a closer look at how such an integration could take shape, suggesting that the technical collaboration, is \u201cprobably more likely than you might think at first glance.\u201d\n\nLayer-2 solutions aim to address scalability issues faced by blockchains like Ethereum, which have experienced congestion and high transaction fees during periods of increased activity. Solana, known for its high throughput and low transaction costs, promises a blockchain platform capable of efficiently accommodating various decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPointing out that these scaling solutions \u201care bridge protocols that provide one-way security,\u201d Yakovenko argues that Ethereum being a layer-2 for Solana would mean that holders of SOL assets on the Ethereum blockchain would have \u201cfinality guarantees\u201d of being able to safely exit back to Solana even in cases of transaction double spends or an invalid state transition.\n\nWould it be possible for ethereum to be a @solana L2? Probably more likely than you might think at first glance. L2s are bridge protocols that provide one way security. In this setup, holders of solana assets on ethereum would have finality guarantees that they can exit back\u2026 https://t.co/XE5ETsxGIW \u2014 toly \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@aeyakovenko) July 2, 2023\n\nMaking this setup work would first require submitting all the Ethereum transactions into Solana, according to Yakovenko, as well as submitting a Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) root for the resulting state\u2014something that would serve as evidence that consensus has been reached among Ethereum validators regarding the state of the network.\n\nFinally, to identify and address possible faults within a bridge protocol, a bridge timeout mechanism will be necessary. Some examples of faults, per Yakovenko, include conflicting SPVs for the root, invalid root computation, and censorship.\n\nLimitations and risks of Solana's ETH-based L2\n\nThe Solana Labs co-founder also highlighted the limitations and potential risks associated with this integration, saying that while it would be safe to hold SOL assets on the Ethereum blockchain, it will not be safe \u201cto lend them or maintain positions against them.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOne key risk is the possibility of an Ethereum fault or a contentious social consensus fork within the Ethereum network. In such a scenario, the representations of Solana assets held on Ethereum could become separated from the consensus fork, resulting in a situation where these assets become effectively worthless.\n\nIt would be safe to hold solana assets on ethereum, but not safe to lend them or maintain positions against them. This is because once there is an ethereum fault, ethereum state on solana becomes separated from ethereum the social consensus fork. Solana users can get their\u2026 \u2014 toly \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@aeyakovenko) July 2, 2023\n\nLending Solana-based USDC, the dollar-pegged stablecoin from Circle, on Ethereum could lead to a situation where the borrower can withdraw the real USDC on the Solana network, while the lender on Ethereum receives a \"junk token.\"\n\nThis scenario, argues Yakovenko, is similar to the experience of holding USDC on Ethereum's Proof-of-Work (EthPow) chain, where certain tokens may lose value or functionality due to network issues or changes.\n\nAdditionally, the integration of Solana assets on Ethereum may have implications for various DeFi protocols. While central limit order books (CLOBs) would likely remain functional, automated market makers (AMMs), and non-flash loan borrowing and lending protocols could face limitations or challenges, potentially leading to inefficiencies or constraints in liquidity provision and trading.\n\nClobs are ok, AMMs and non flash loan borrow lending protocols are not. \u2014 toly \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@aeyakovenko) July 2, 2023\n\nYakovenko\u2019s proposal came hot on the heels of Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin lamenting about how U.S. regulators are targeting various crypto projects, including Solana, which the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in its recent lawsuit against Binance labeled as unregistered securities.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t deserve it, and if Ethereum ends up \u2018winning\u2019 through all other blockchains getting kicked off exchanges, that\u2019s not an honorable way to win, and in the long term probably isn\u2019t even a victory,\u201d Buterin tweeted last week.\n\nAD\n\nAD"
