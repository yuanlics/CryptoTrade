        "title": "SkyBridge's Scaramucci Says Bitcoin, Ethereum Prices to Trend Higher - Bloomberg",
        "content": "00:00\n\n[CC may contain inaccuracies] I want to get your thoughts initially on what do you think the economic and investment environment will be like in the US over the next 12 months? Do you think the Fed's done hiking rates? I do think the Fed is done hiking. And good morning to you guys. I think that the the inflation data was very positive and it's likely to go lower over the next quarter. And so Rick Rieder, a personal friend of mine, actually gave a presentation in Park City at Governor Romney's conference about a month ago and explained the the churning down of inflation. And I think that's very, very good for stock prices, very good for assets. But, of course, what do people want for Christmas in America? They want a low interest rate mortgage. And if you look at housing data in the United States right now, those markets are quite sluggish. I think the Fed is going to respond to that. You'll probably see cuts in interest rates before the end of the first quarter. And so that's very positive for asset prices across the board. Okay. You mentioned last time Bloomberg spoke with you about, you know, you had a great October for your fund. I think it's the best month you've had in the history of SkyBridge. A lot of it was crypto, which I'll get to later. But what what's the other part of that? I mean, is there any parts of that of your portfolio that really kind of benefit from maybe either higher for longer or a less sort of tightening environment? I guess who else, unfortunately, versus the bets that hurt us last year? We we left on for this year. And so unfortunately in investing, sometimes you can get the timing wrong. But we made the case in the fourth quarter of last year in the early part of 2023, that the Fed would start cutting rates more quickly, that inflation would come down more quickly once the supply chain had reconnected. And you saw all of this induction of new technology like A.I., robotic technology, etc., bringing down prices. And so we got the timing wrong. But if you're a long term investor, if you were patient with us, you did quite well. And and last year at this time here at this all conference, as I mentioned during the commercial break, I think Bitcoin was about 16 or 17,000. We have a 10% position in Bitcoin in our portfolio and of course that's gone up to 35, 36,000 in the last year. And I think that went up contrary to institutional sentiment at the time. Over the last year people were quite negative. I was in Davos, Switzerland, being interviewed by some of your colleagues. January of this year, everyone had written off Bitcoin. Of course, it went up about 115% since then. So it's a combination of a couple of different factors, but it's mostly about being bullish about the return of the global economy and global growth. post-COVID. It just took longer than people expected, but we're there now. Yeah, from 6000 to 35. Now, you mentioned 10% weighting. How are you managing your exposure to crypto? What do you suspect the changes will be over the next couple of months? Anthony? Well, I mean, I think one of the things we're very proud of is we're we were the first outside capital into the BlackRock Bitcoin Trust. And so as you guys know, they filed for a formal application with the SCC, the deadline for that application at least for the Ark application, Cathie Wood's is January 10th. It appears likely that these things will get approved if that happens. I think there's an induction of a tremendous amount of demand for Bitcoin and of course you have a happening in Bitcoin, which basically means the supply is going to get cut in half in April. So having lower supply, more demand, we think prices are going to trend higher for Bitcoin, Etherium and a few other currencies. And for those reasons we're going to stay long in the portfolio. And you know what? Well, you know, it's a concentrated bet for us, but we like it. It's a macro overlay. And I guess you guys will remember the beginning part of the year with the Silicon Valley bank crises. Bitcoin was quite resilient and it seems to also do what you'd want an alternative investment to do is go contra into carry indicatori to the overall market. And I think it's safe to say you're still deep into crypto. And of course, obviously your name was mentioned during those SBF trials. Well, I want to get your take on the verdict now that we have one here as well. And overall the future of FDX 2.0. Would you invest in it? Would I invest in it? Well, depends on who's running it. I think number one, I think if you read Michael Lewis's book, there was a business there. He had 12 and a half percent of the cryptocurrency market. So I think the sloppiness and the indiscretion and the eventual fraud obviously ruined the the business and ruin the reputation of that business. But there is a good. Underlying business of you. Tell me who's managing it. I would be open minded to that. But since you're mentioning FDA, I think it's important to point out to people last year at this time at this conference, Sam Bankman-fried had just declared bankruptcy and he was about to be arrested. And so it's a full year later. He's already been convicted for the fraud. His sentencing comes it comes in March. I think it was fair. You know, I spoke at an event here for the Singapore Monetary Authority yesterday and explained that a good regulatory process is clear, transparent rules. But if there are bad actors, they've got to get convicted and have to pay the price for the crimes that they're committing. And I think we're seeing that in the United States. I think that sending a message of deterrence to people, but it's also sending a message of greater safety in these markets for investors. So there's a combination of positive things happening this year. And of course, if you interviewed me last year at this time, there was less than positive things happening. So, Anthony, just everyone was asking about 2.0. Just a quick update, please. If you could give us a timeline on 1.0. They still have a stake in you guys. Do you still plan on buying them, taking that stake back? You have a timetable for that? Yes. So unfortunately, we're waiting for the bag. We've created a data room for the bankruptcy estate to look at and to make a decision on when they'll give us the opportunity to buy back those assets. I still think that's likely a year or two away, and we're in no rush because, of course, there was no controlling stake and there's no voting interest or even economic preference in that stake. So we're running the business just like we've run it before with no interruption. But you're asking about tax. If that's going to go alive, it'll probably be the back half of 2024. My prediction is that they'll eventually sell those assets and that technology to somebody that will restart that exchange. And so we'll have to see what happens. But I think that's very likely. How much time. So I've got to ask you about, you know, we have a U.S. election that's coming up as well. Do you do you have any sort of projection here? Are we going to back this time? Give me of course, you had a short stint in the White House. I'm in the I'm in the ABC camp. You know, anybody but anybody but Trump. And so if it's Trump versus Biden, I will be actively advocating for President Biden. I have supported Governor Christie, and I'm hopeful that he can have a good showing in New Hampshire. If that doesn't happen and the president does get the nomination. President Trump, I think it's just too big of a threat to the American democracy. And if you listen to him very carefully, he wants to put up refugee camps. He wants the poor people from the country. It's very un-American. It'll be very disruptive for business continuity globally and in the U.S. So I'll be with President Biden if it's a Trump versus Biden case. But if it isn't, I'm a long term Republican, so we'll see."
