        "content": "Advertisement\n\nHere are the top three news stories by U.Today from the past day.\n\nEthereum's Vitalik Buterin says AI could pose \"existential risk\"\n\nIn a recently published longread essay on his blog, Ethereum cofounder Vitalik Buterin has issued an unsettling warning about AI. According to Buterin, AI could potentially outsmart humans and take over as the dominant power on Earth. He cautions that if a superintelligent AI saw humans as a threat, it could lead to disastrous consequences. Even though these issues seem that they will be a pain in the neck for our descendants in the distant future, one should keep in mind the rapid pace at which AI is advancing. Additionally, we still have not figured out how to program these super intelligent beings to live safely alongside humans. Buterin also challenges his readers to imagine living in a society ruled by artificial intelligence, referring to Iain Banks's Culture series, where humans coexist with powerful AI. In this imagined future, humans are offered longevity, health and entertainment, but at the cost of control over AI.\n\nElon Musk's X secures new payment license in key US state\n\nOn Nov. 27, Elon Musk-owned X platform achieved an important milestone on its path to becoming the \"everything app\"; it secured a money transmitter license from South Dakota regulators. The license enables the company to facilitate seamless cross-border money transfers. In total, X can provide money transmitting services in 10 American states: Arizona, Georgia, Iowa, Maryland, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and, newly added, South Dakota. With its most recent license, X might strengthen its position as a strong competitor in the financial services industry, comparable to well-known firms like Stripe and PayPal.\n\nShiba Inu (SHIB) cryptic text thrills community"

        "content": "Ethereum has formed a \u201cgolden cross\u201d pattern on the 1-week timeframe, marking the second such signal this year. While the long-term implications could be very positive if history repeats itself, there are reasons to temper expectations.\n\nA weekly golden cross has formed | ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nEthereum Golden Cross And A Possible Target For New ATHs\n\n1W ETHUSD has formed a golden cross for the second time in 2023. A golden cross is a buy signal in moving average-based trading systems. It suggests that the trend is moving in an upward direction and because trends tend to persist, this is notable.\n\nThe golden signal occurs when a shorter-term moving average (the 50-week MA) crosses through a longer-term moving average (the 200-week MA) from below. A death cross forms when the opposite happens.\n\nThe last confirmed golden cross for Ethereum in December 2020 preceded a massive 600% rally over the next year to the asset\u2019s all-time high near $4,900. A repeat move of similar magnitude this time would put Ethereum above $12,000\u2014over six times today\u2019s price of around $2,000.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that not all golden crosses lead to the anticipated upside. In 2023 alone, 1W ETHUSD has death crossed and golden crossed twice now, demonstrating how moving average-based systems are prone to whipsaw without an established trend to follow.\n\nAbove 20 on the ADX confirms the trend | ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nAn Uptrend Or More Whipsaw? How The ADX Confirms Trends\n\nThe whipsawing death cross and golden cross price action on the Ethereum 1-week chart failed to generate follow-through in either direction. So how can we be sure that this isn\u2019t yet another premature crossover?\n\nThis is where the Average Directional Index (ADX) comes in when gauging the validity of moving average crosses. The ADX aims to measure trend strength, typically on a scale of 0 to 100.\n\nAs the 1-week ADX edges up from below 20, it confirms growing momentum that reduces the odds of more whipsawing price action. Traders often use such ADX readings to confirm golden/death crosses and enter only the most high-conviction signals.\n\nThe 1W ETHUSD Average Directional Index isn\u2019t yet above 20, but is approaching this key level. Above it, it gives the golden cross much more validity.\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Trading-focused Layer 1 blockchain Sei SEI +0.27% will add support for the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) in its upcoming version 2 (V2) upgrade. This will enable developers to port Ethereum-based contracts over to the network and use them on it.\n\nTo add this feature, Sei V2 will incorporate Geth, a Go implementation of the Ethereum Virtual Machine. Geth is the most widely used Ethereum client software.\n\nSei Labs told The Block that it has developed a specialized interface to facilitate interaction of Sei's existing smart contracts component (based on CosmWasm technology) with the EVM component. CosmWasm is a custom Cosmos SDK module that allows chains to operate smart contracts in the Cosmos ecosystem. With V2, the team will enable an efficient integration of EVM support into the Sei network.\n\n\"Sei V2 is an additive change. All of the existing components like CosmWasm will continue to exist. Since this is a proposed chain modification, the different virtual machines will also be able to interact with each other, allowing for Sei V2 to be the first network where EVM and Cosmwasm contracts are able to call each other,\" Jay Jog, co-founder at Sei Labs told The Block.\n\nExpanding on Sei V1\n\nSei has been operational on the mainnet beta since the V1 launch in August, offering support for Cosmos smart contracts written in Rust. With Sei V2, the team behind it aims to broaden its appeal to a wider range of developers. The development will add a fully parallelized EVM-compatible layer with sub-second finality (the speed at which transactions are confirmed).\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nIn addition to EVM support, Sei V2 introduces SeiDB, a data structure that purports to improve the platform\u2019s storage layer. According to the team, SeiDB will prevent state bloat \u2014 where the network becomes excessively data heavy \u2014 and simplify the state synchronization process for new nodes. The objective here is to boost the overall performance and scalability of the Sei blockchain.\n\nThe Sei V2 upgrade is currently nearing completion from a code development perspective and is undergoing a rigorous audit process to ensure its security. It is scheduled to be released on a public testnet in the first quarter of 2024, with the mainnet deployment expected in the first half of the year.\n\nWhat is Sei?\n\nSei is a Cosmos SDK-based proof-of-stake blockchain, designed to be optimized for trading with its ability to execute sub-second blocks. In April 2023, Sei Labs, the core developer of the network, raised $30 million in two strategic funding rounds from venture firms including Jump and Multicoin Capital.\n\nWith functionality that supports fast decentralized trading, Sei targets a specific niche where it competes with other Cosmos chains like Osmosis, Kava, Injective, Neutron and Kujira."

        "content": "What is Ethereum?\n\nEthereum was the first cryptocurrency to introduce smart contracts. A smart contract is a tiny piece of code that lives on the blockchain, and it's the technology behind the decentralized finance (DeFi) industry. A large proportion of decentralized applications are built on the Ethereum ecosystem, although Ethereum now has a lot of competitors that want to take some of its market share.\n\nWhere can you buy Ethereum?\n\nYou can buy Ethereum from almost any cryptocurrency platform. You can even buy Ethereum from some Bitcoin ATMs in the U.S. Let's look at the differences between apps, exchanges and brokers.\n\nCryptocurrency brokers: Several traditional stock brokers offer a limited selection of cryptocurrencies alongside their other products. These are a great option for people who want to add Ethereum to their investment portfolio without opening a new crypto exchange account. Be aware that most crypto brokers don't offer external wallets so it may not be easy to withdraw or deposit crypto assets.\n\nSeveral traditional stock brokers offer a limited selection of cryptocurrencies alongside their other products. These are a great option for people who want to add Ethereum to their investment portfolio without opening a new crypto exchange account. Be aware that most crypto brokers don't offer external wallets so it may not be easy to withdraw or deposit crypto assets. Cryptocurrency exchanges: These are the most common way to buy and sell cryptocurrencies, and plenty of exchanges offer lots of ways to deposit fiat currency (such as U.S. dollars), reasonable fees, and a sizable list of tradable coins. On the downside, these exchanges are not subject to the same regulations as stock brokers.\n\nThese are the most common way to buy and sell cryptocurrencies, and plenty of exchanges offer lots of ways to deposit fiat currency (such as U.S. dollars), reasonable fees, and a sizable list of tradable coins. On the downside, these exchanges are not subject to the same regulations as stock brokers. Cryptocurrency apps: Most cryptocurrency brokers and exchanges also have mobile apps to make it easy to trade on the go. You can also buy Ethereum using payment apps such as Venmo and Paypal.\n\nWhat to look for when buying Ethereum\n\nBuying Ethereum for the first time can be a little daunting. But there are a lot of excellent products out there, it's just a question of finding the right platform for you.\n\nHere are some key questions to help you find the best place to buy Ethereum.\n\n1. What fees will you have to pay?\n\nBroadly speaking, there are three types of fees to watch out for:\n\nDeposit fees\n\nTrading fees\n\nWithdrawal fees\n\nWe'll break these down in more detail below. Just be aware that fees are rarely standard across the various trading platforms. For example, you might find a cryptocurrency exchange that offers free trading but charges you a lot of money to withdraw your funds.\n\nDon't be afraid to open a couple of accounts and experiment. But don't deposit any money until you're comfortable with the fee structure.\n\n2. How will the platform secure your assets?\n\nCryptocurrency investment is an exciting world, but unfortunately it has attracted its fair share of bad actors. In addition to the risk of hacking, the collapse of FTX also demonstrated that we don't always know what an exchange is doing with your money. Simply put, cryptocurrency exchanges don't have the same investor protections and security as you'd find in banks and other financial institutions.\n\nIf a crypto exchange or broker is not transparent about its security systems, this should be a major red flag. Sometimes you'll read that a company doesn't want to disclose these details for security reasons, but that's misleading. There's plenty of information a trading platform can reveal without compromising its systems.\n\n3. Are there any sign-up bonuses?\n\nSome platforms offer sign-up bonuses for new investors. You might find a platform that gives you a small bonus when you start, or one that offers a bonus when you make a certain amount of trades or deposit a certain amount of money. While these are tempting, don't let them drive your decision-making. It may be a great tie breaker, but there's no point in signing up for the wrong exchange just because you want the bonus.\n\n4. Is it available in my country or state?\n\nSome cryptocurrency exchanges can't operate in the U.S., and only a handful are licensed to operate in every state. For example, New York has some of the strictest crypto exchange regulation and will actively pursue rule breakers. As such, it's good to check that the exchange you want to use is allowed to operate where you live.\n\n5. Does it have all the features you need?\n\nIf you're buying Ethereum for the first time, you'll want an easy-to-use platform with plenty of educational resources. If you prefer mobile apps to web browsers, look for an exchange with a good app.\n\nOther useful features include:\n\nThe ability to set up automatic monthly transfers\n\nGood customer service\n\nAn external wallet\n\nWe'll talk about wallets in more detail shortly. If you're an active Ethereum trader, you might also want advanced features such as limit orders and good charting tools.\n\n6. Can I stake or earn interest on my Ethereum?\n\nLast year, Ethereum moved to what's called a proof-of-stake system, changing the way it validates transactions. It is part of a wider upgrade to make the popular blockchain more scalable, more sustainable, and more secure.\n\nWithout getting too technical, one impact is that investors can stake their ETH tokens to earn rewards. Proof-of-stake cryptos pay rewards to holders who are willing to tie up their tokens to contribute to network security. As a long-term investor, this is a great way to earn passive income from your Ethereum investment.\n\nHowever, be aware that there's a difference between staking and the crypto lend-earn products offered by some platforms. Some exchanges use the word \"staking\" for any kind of activity that will generate interest. But there's a big difference. When a crypto earn platform offers high rates of interest, you don't know what risks it is taking with your assets. And if it collapses, you could lose your crypto completely.\n\n7. Does it have a wide selection of cryptocurrencies?\n\nIf you only want to buy Ethereum or Bitcoin (BTC), you won't need an exchange with lots of tokens. However, if you see buying Ethereum as the first step on a longer crypto-trading journey, a long list of altcoins is a bonus. It's worth understanding an exchange's policy on adding new coins too -- does it try to filter out potential scams or is it looking to list as many coins as possible?\n\nCheck out our cryptocurrency exchange reviews for more options."
