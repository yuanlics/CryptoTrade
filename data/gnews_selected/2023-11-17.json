        "content": "Asset management giant BlackRock on Thursday officially filed for a spot ethereum exchange-traded fund ( ETF ), doubling down on its cryptocurrency bets amid investor optimism about the approval of such investment vehicles.The iShares Ethereum Trust, which was registered last week and will be listed on Nasdaq if approved, will give investors access to ether - the second most popular cryptocurrency - without directly owning it.BlackRock is proposing to convert the trust to a \"spot\" ETF, which means it will own ether instead of futures products tied to the crypto token.While futures-based crypto ETFs have previously been approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the regulator has long contended that the spot crypto market is prone to fraud and manipulation.But in August, a federal appeals court ruled that the SEC was wrong to reject an application from digital asset manager Grayscale Investments to create a spot bitcoin ETF.The landmark victory for Grayscale has prompted a wave of enthusiasm among companies that filed for such investment vehicles in recent months, and has helped restore some faith in the crypto industry after it was shaken by several high-profile collapses last year.BlackRock dipped its toes in the crypto space with its filing for a spot bitcoin ETF in June. Its latest filing indicates that the Wall Street behemoth is aiming to move beyond bitcoin, the world's most popular cryptocurrency.The company will be vying with crypto natives such as Grayscale and Valkyrie and traditional finance giants like Invesco for market share.Coinbase Custody, a unit of crypto exchange Coinbase, will hold the proposed ETF's ether in custody. The company is also the proposed custodian of BlackRock's bitcoin ETF.BlackRock did not immediately respond to a request seeking additional comment."

        "content": "The Securities and Exchange Commission delayed making a decision this week on whether to approve the Hashdex Nasdaq Ethereum ETH +2.62% ETF, which wants to hold both spot ether and futures contracts.\n\nThe SEC said it needed more time to take action on the change and said it would make a decision on whether to approve, disapprove or \"institute proceedings to determine whether to disapprove,\" by Jan 1, 2024. On Thursday, the agency also delayed a decision on whether to convert an application for a Hashdex bitcoin futures ETF application.\n\n\"The Commission finds it appropriate to designate a longer period within which to take action on the proposed rule change so that it has sufficient time to consider the proposed rule change and the issues raised therein,\" the SEC said in a filing dated Nov. 15.\n\nThe Nasdaq stock exchange filed with the SEC to list the Hashdex Nasdaq Ethereum ETF back in September. The fund is managed and controlled by Toroso Investments, which is registered as a commodity pool operator with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and member of the National Futures Association.\n\n\"Instead of holding 100% spot Ether, which could make it more susceptible to price manipulation in the spot market, the Fund will hold a mix of Spot Ether, Ether Futures Contracts, and cash,\" Nasdaq said in the 19b-4 form in September.\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nSEC's history with ether ETFs\n\nThe SEC has approved of an ether futures-like ETF before, but not a spot ether ETF \u2014 or a mixed one. Last month, nine futures-based products were approved at the same time, marking their debut.\n\nFirms have recently made a push for spot ether ETFs, including Grayscale's bid to convert its Ethereum trust to a spot ether ETF last month and BlackRock's move this past week to file for a spot ether ETF.\n\nThis comes as multiple firms, including Fidelity, Grayscale and BlackRock are also waiting to see if a spot bitcoin ETF will be approved by the SEC anytime soon."

        "content": "Nocturne, a protocol that enables private accounts on Ethereum, has launched its first version on mainnet.\n\nThe protocol is designed so that users are able to deposit or receive funds privately on what Vitalik Buterin calls stealth addresses.\n\nThis means that users can generate a secret spending and viewing key, which can then be used to create multiple meta-addresses that can be used to interact with other accounts.\n\nThese addresses are held within Nocturne smart contracts and are intended to be used to trade what the company refers to as \u2018hot assets,\u2019 or crypto assets that are not designed to be held.\n\nAccording to Nocturne, its smart accounts will be compatible with DeFi protocols that \u201crepresent state via output tokens.\u201d This means that it will only be compatible with tokens that are made valuable from a previous input \u2014 or tokens where a user must deposit collateral in order to mint the token.\n\nSuch tokens could include Uniswap liquidity tokens, Aave\u2019s aTokens, and Compound\u2019s cTokens.\n\nThere are plans to later extend smart account compatibility to arbitrary protocols with the help of zero-knowledge technology, which can prove ownership of assets without revealing the details of the assets owned themselves, Nocturne notes.\n\nLuke Tchang, CEO and co-founder of Nocturne, noted in a press release reviewed by Blockworks that the company is moving away from simply being a \u2018privacy tool.\u2019\n\n\u201cPrivacy should be embedded at the account layer and the v1 launch is the first step in making this possible,\u201d Tchang said. \u201cOur goal is to ensure that everyone, from individual users to large institutions, can transact securely without exposing their financial history to the world.\u201d\n\nUsers who wish to access Nocturne v1 can do so through a private vault user interface. The current capabilities of the interface are limited to deposits, transfer of tokens to burner addresses, and private swapping and staking, the company said.\n\nFuture versions of the protocol include the migration of a \u2018proof-of-innocence\u2019 protocol that can prove transactions are verified without revealing any information about the user\u2019s identity and further usability and functionality of Nocturne wallets by enabling compatibility with arbitrary smart contracts.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."
