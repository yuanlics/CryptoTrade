        "content": "Major cryptocurrencies spiked on Monday evening amid growing anticipation for the approval of a spot-based BTC exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nCryptocurrency Gains +/- Price (Recorded 9:30 p.m. EST) Bitcoin BTC/USD +6.45% $46,527 Ethereum ETH/USD +4.71% $2,309 Dogecoin DOGE/USD +2.28% $0.079\n\nWhat Happened: The rally occurred as investors eagerly await a regulatory decision for the first spot-based bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the U.S., expected sometime this week.\n\nMost market observers anticipate approval, with bulls predicting that these funds would significantly broaden the investor base for the asset and attract substantial inflows.\n\nToday, major asset management companies like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale submitted updated S-1 filings to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Multiple issuers also disclosed the fees they would charge investors.\n\n\n\nTwo days before the SEC is expected to approve one or more spot Bitcoin ETFs, all potential issuers have disclosed a crucial detail about their product: the fee, and they vary significantly.\n\n\n\nAmong the 13 proposed ETFs awaiting SEC approval or rejection, the fee they charge is a key factor in setting them apart from one another. Lower fees, calculated as a percentage of the fund\u2019s assets, mean more returns for investors.\n\nBitwise, a crypto native fund manager, stands out by charging the lowest fee at 0.24% after a 6-month period of no fees. However, some of its rivals are not far behind. Ark and 21Shares plan to charge 0.25%, while VanEck and Franklin list their fees at 0.25% and 0.29% respectively.\n\nBlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, has set its fee at 0.30%, which is lower than what some experts had anticipated, considering its size and reputation could have allowed it to charge more and still remain highly competitive in popularity.\n\nTop Gainer (24 Hour)\n\nCryptocurrency Gains +/- Price (Recorded 9:30 p.m. EDT) Astar ASTR/USD +26.85% $0.14 Bitcoin SV BSV/USD +22.41% $90.08 Stacks STX/USD +21.26% $1.97\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market cap now stands at $1.63 trillion, showing a slight decline of 1.71% in the past 24 hours.\n\n\n\nOn Monday, major stock averages showed an increase, mainly driven by the performance of technology shares, as Wall Street aimed to bounce back from a challenging week. The S&P 500 concluded with a 1.41% gain, closing at 4,763.54, while the Nasdaq Composite surged by 2.2%, ending the day at 14,843.77, marking the tech-heavy index\u2019s most substantial one-day gain since Nov. 14.\n\nThis week, traders are anticipating increased clarity regarding potential rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. The release of the December consumer price index on Thursday and the producer price index on Friday will provide crucial insights into whether the central bank\u2019s efforts to stabilize inflation at its 2% target are yielding results.\n\nSee More: Best Cryptocurrency Scanners\n\nAnalyst Notes: Cryptocurrency analyst Michael Van de Poppe said that a Bitcoin Spot ETF is on the horizon for approval, \"which is true legitimacy for an asset created out of the Financial Crisis of 2008 only existing for 15 years. The upcoming bull cycle is likely going to be glorious.\"\n\nCryptocurrency analyst Carl from the Moon said \"If the ETF is denied on Wednesday then that would be the biggest manipulation\" of Bitcoin so far.\n\nAccording to on-chain analyst Ali Martinez, regardless of the outcome of the Bitcoin ETF, we can look forward to another bullish trend this year: The BTC Halving. \"It has historically been a catalyst for major price surges.\"\n\nPhoto by Igor Faun on Shutterstock\n\nRead Next: Jim Cramer Advises Against Using Binance, Provokes Strong Reactions From Twitter Users"

The impact continues to be felt today with higher inflation and a tight job market coming after the pandemic.\n\nTo help mitigate the impact of the pandemic, the U.S. government sent out several stimulus payments to help individuals and families deal with rising costs and job losses.\n\nWhile the stimulus payments were meant to help with everyday spending and bills, Americans who received the payments were free to do with the money as they wished, potentially investing it if they did not need the money at the current time or putting it into savings.\n\n\n\nWhat Happened: In 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Act (CARES Act) was signed into law. Under the law, Americans received a total of three stimulus payments.\n\nMany used the money for bills and savings, but some also turned to investing in stocks and cryptocurrencies at the time.\n\nThe CARES Act paid out $1,200 to eligible adults and $500 more for those with qualifying children for its first stimulus payment.\n\nThe subsequent Tax Relief Act of 2020 paid out an additional $600 per eligible adult and up to $600 more for those with qualifying children in December 2020. The American Rescue Act of 2021 provided an additional $1,400 payment to eligible adults and up to $1,400 for those with qualifying children.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at the return a consumer would have if they put their stimulus checks ($1,200, $600 and $1,400) into leading cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin BTC/USD, Dogecoin DOGE/USD and Ethereum ETH/USD.\n\nThe hypothetical results are based on the dates of April 11, 2020; Dec. 29, 2020; and March 12, 2021, for the stimulus checks.\n\nRelated Link: EXCLUSIVE: Why Does Cathie Wood Think Bitcoin Is Going To $1 Million \u2014 What Does She Know That We Don\u2019t?\n\nStimulus Checks in Bitcoin: Investing in Bitcoin with a portion of the stimulus checks may have been a popular option for investors and people looking to store some of the payment away or get involved in the cryptocurrency market for the first time.\n\nBitcoin traded at $6,926 on April 11, 2020, $27,370 on Dec. 29, 2020, and $57,996 on March 12, 2021.

Loading...\n\nStimulus Checks in Dogecoin: The meme cryptocurrency known as Dogecoin gained interest and value in 2021 thanks to retail investors and vocal public supporters like Mark Cuban and Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Here's how stimulus checks in Dogecoin would have fared.\n\nDogecoin traded at $0.0020 on April 11, 2020, $0.0046 on Dec. 29, 2020, and $0.0570 on March 12, 2021. A person who put all $3,200 from the stimulus checks into Dogecoin would have been able to purchase 754,996 DOGE. Based on a price of $0.08107 today, that $3,200 would now be worth $61,207.53, gaining 1,812.7%.\n\nStimulus Checks In Ethereum: One of the fastest-growing cryptocurrencies in 2021 was Ethereum, thanks to its connection to non-fungible tokens. Here's a look at how stimulus checks invested in the second-largest cryptocurrency would have fared.\n\nEthereum traded at $161.17 on April 11, 2020, $737.95 on Dec. 29, 2020, and $1,839.50 on March 12, 2021. A person who put the $3,200 into Ethereum would have been able to purchase 9.02 ETH. Based on a price of $2,353.96 for Ethereum today, that $3,200 investment would now be worth $21,232.72 today, gaining 626.0%.\n\nStimulus Check In All 3 Cryptocurrencies: A more diversified approach from an investor could have seen investments in Bitcoin, Dogecoin and Ethereum. Splitting the $3,200 into equal investments of the three cryptocurrencies on the respective stimulus payout days would have given an investor 0.0731 BTC, 251,665 DOGE and 3 ETH.
