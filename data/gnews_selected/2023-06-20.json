        "content": "Ethereum core developers proposed increasing the maximum amount of staked ETH to become a validator from 32 ETH to 2,048 ETH amid growing wait times in the activation queue.\n\nIn a developer call last week, Ethereum Foundation researchers proposed raising the validator staking limit to 2,048 ETH per validator, while keeping the minimum amount required to stake ETH at 32 ETH.\n\nEthereum developers Mike Neuder, Francesco D\u2019Amato, Aditya Asgaonkar and Justin Drake first put forth the proposal earlier this month. Whether or not it will be implemented, is still up for debate.\n\nRead more: If Vitalik Is the Pope of Crypto, Is Justin Sun the Inverse Pope?\n\nThe current limit to run a validator stands at 32 ETH, meaning that larger staking service providers like Lido have created numerous validator nodes to offer liquid staking solutions to users. Ultimately, this has resulted in a significant increase in the number of validators on the Ethereum network.\n\nWhile a larger validator set arguably makes the network more decentralized, it has invariably made the entry queue to run a validator node considerably longer. Data shows that the current wait time in the activation queue is more than 44 days, up from a wait time of just under a month last month.\n\nThe activation queue peaked on 9 Jun with 96k Validators in the Pending Queue. If the daily deposit is < then daily activation (2025\n\nvalidators / 64800 $ETH), we will be seeing a reduction in the activation queue. Despite the decline, the queue is still ~45 Days to activate https://t.co/3IZYpfLvC1 pic.twitter.com/qD29a60Roj \u2014 Tom Wan (@tomwanhh) June 20, 2023\n\nAccording to Cyber Capital CIO Justin Bons, what matters for true decentralization should be the distribution of power as opposed to the number of nodes.\n\nRead more: JPMorgan Forecasts Ether to Outperform Bitcoin in 2024 Amid Crypto Market Uncertainties\n\n\u201cThis proposal only increases the maximum stake allowed on a single node. Not the minimum stake of 32 ETH, which stays the same\u2026 Avoiding the inefficient circus of singular parties running hundreds of nodes,\u201d said Bons on Twitter."

ETH could gain bullish momentum if it clears the $1,750 resistance zone.\n\nEthereum is slowly moving higher above the $1,700 and $1,720 resistance levels.\n\nThe price is trading above $1,720 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere is a key bullish trend line forming with support near $1,718 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair could rise further above the $1,750 and $1,765 resistance levels.\n\nEthereum Price Steadies Above $1,700\n\nEthereum\u2019s price started a steady recovery wave above the $1,650 level. ETH was able to settle above the $1,700 resistance zone, similar to Bitcoin.\n\nRecently, the price saw a minor downside correction from the $1,768 high. The price traded below the $1,720 level but the bulls were active near $1,700. A low is formed near $1,698 and the price is again attempting a fresh increase.\n\nThere was a break above the $1,720 resistance. The price climbed above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1,768 swing high to the $1,698 low.\n\nEther is now trading above $1,720 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is also a key bullish trend line forming with support near $1,718 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. Immediate resistance is near the $1,750 level. The next major resistance is near the $1,765 level.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nA successful move above the $1,750 and $1,765 resistance levels might start a steady recovery wave. The next resistance sits near $1,800, above which Ethereum could rise toward the $1,850 level. Any more gains above the $1,850 resistance zone might send the price toward the $1,920 resistance.\n\nAe Dips Supported in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $1,750 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,720 level and the trend line.\n\nThe next major support is near the $1,700 level or the recent low. If there is a break and close below the $1,700 support, the price could drop toward the $1,675 support. Any more losses may perhaps send the price toward the $1,620 zone.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bullish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now above the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $1,700\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $1,765\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Widely followed crypto analyst Benjamin Cowen is warning that Ethereum (ETH) could correct in a big way as he believes the leading altcoin is poised to retest a long-term trend indicator before it could give birth to a new bull market.\n\nIn a new strategy session, Cowen tells his 785,000 YouTube subscribers that Ethereum has been respecting the fair-value logarithmic regression band as support since 2017.\n\nAccording to the analyst, the logarithmic regression band is designed to track the fair value of an asset using \u201cnon-bubble data.\u201d\n\nCowen says that in an optimistic scenario, Ethereum may retest the upper bound of the trend indicator, which he notes coincides with ETH\u2019s bear market low at around $875.\n\n\u201cNow, an interesting development is that the fair value according to this fit to non-bubble data of Ethereum is at $875, but the prior low was actually at $880. So they\u2019re essentially the same.\n\nIf Ethereum went back down to its prior low, that would get it back home. And we talked about this a year ago. I said, \u2018Look guys, what I think is going to happen is we either go down to the regression band or we go sideways until it catches up.\u2019 Now, if we were to dump now, if we were to dump to what I\u2019ve called home before, it would actually correspond to the prior low.\u201d\n\nIn a worst-case scenario, Cowen says that ETH could briefly trade below the logarithmic regression trendline, similar to what happened in March 2020.\n\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean that you can\u2019t go below that level. As you can see, we did go entirely below the entire regression band back in March 2020. And in fact, it went about 34% below the regression band during that drop.\n\nIf we were to have another drop, similar to that, like 34% below this level, that would correspond down to about a $400 Ethereum, which is why I\u2019ve thrown that number out there in the past as a potential outcome in a worst-case scenario environment.\u201d\n\nEthereum is trading for $1,736 at time of writing, a fractional increase in the last 24 hours.\n\nI\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "title": "This L1 network creates a secure and efficient interoperable network with Bitcoin, Ethereum and more - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "In a world of different blockchains, interoperability is becoming an increasingly important issue. While many solutions are already connecting the numerous chains, they don\u2019t come without risks.\n\nDifferent layer-1 blockchains aim to solve this interoperability problem by creating a network with integrated bridges between chains and asynchronous message passing. Using a cross-chain bridge, it\u2019s possible to move value from one chain to another. However, this raises several issues for developers and users. One major issue is the potential for bridge hacks, which have caused billions of dollars in damage in recent years.\n\nIn addition, a fragmented blockchain landscape leads to inefficiencies and complexity, exposing additional vulnerabilities. Trading across chains can be costly with rising gas prices and slippage risks. What\u2019s more, bridging solutions can take anywhere from minutes to hours to get a transaction through.\n\nAttacks on bridges account for 69% of total funds stolen in 2022. Source: Chainalysis\n\nOne blockchain to connect them all\n\nZetaChain, a decentralized layer-1 chain, compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), aims to make the blockchain industry more interoperable by natively supporting cross-chain bridging of assets, data and liquidity.\n\nZetaChain\u2019s approach makes it possible to build omnichain decentralized applications (DApps) that allow users to access all of their assets and data from a single platform, regardless of the blockchain they were created or stored on. The increased interoperability and ability to create omnichain DApps could improve user experience, which could, in turn, benefit the adoption of blockchain technology in general.\n\nFurthermore, ZetaChain not only supports smart contract chains like Ethereum but can also integrate non-smart contract blockchains like Dogecoin and Bitcoin using the cross-chain toolkit for developers. The network effectively allows for Bitcoin smart contracts giving developers the tools and infrastructure to merge their BRC-20 projects, for example. Overall, however, the network is blockchain agnostic.\n\nSource: ZetaChain\n\nGaining momentum\n\nZetaChain is a new project and therefore is working hard to gain a foothold within the crypto industry. The project recently published its white paper, available in 17 different languages. The document highlights the focus on interoperability between chains and developers worldwide.\n\nThe blockchain\u2019s testnet has attracted more than 1.5 million users from over 100 countries while its community continues to grow. In addition, ZetaChain\u2019s social media channels have built a follower base of over 1.7 million people in the short time they have been live.\n\nOn the developer side, the momentum is visible as well. The project has partnered with many big names in the crypto industry, including an infrastructure provider for the BNB Chain ecosystem Ankr, blockchain security company Halborn, and bug bounty and security services platform Immunefi. DApp development ranges from decentralized exchanges (DEXs) to NFTs and universal and private identity platforms, all to expand the reach of the ecosystem.\n\nDevelopers interested in building DApps on top of ZetaChain can apply for funding through the ZetaChain Grants Program. Hundreds of developer teams have already applied for this funding, hoping to receive a kick-start from the project.\n\n\ud83d\udce2 Announcing $5 million in ZetaChain grants to power the next generation of Omnichain dApps. Learn about the program and apply here:https://t.co/ISA1vorcbP \u2014 ZetaChain (@zetablockchain) April 13, 2023\n\nNot stealing from other chains, but growing with them\n\nA key aspect of ZetaChain\u2019s mission is to grow with other networks rather than at their expense. Brandon Truong, chief product officer at ZetaChain, emphasized this aspect: \u201cZetaChain is in a unique position as a new L1 that connects other chains agnostically. Instead of trying to steal liquidity and users from other ecosystems and chains, it can grow with them. The growth of ZetaChain goes hand in hand with the growth of crypto in general.\u201d\n\nThe project\u2019s founders began their journey by exploring the different types of architecture that exist to connect other chains. They quickly discovered many issues, from the aforementioned vulnerabilities to async messaging-based and centralized approaches. By developing an EVM-compatible layer-1 blockchain, ZetaChain aims to be a solution that works for users and developers while keeping security concerns in mind.\n\nZetaChain empowers developers to create easy-to-use DApps that onboard non-crypto natives to the crypto space. Moreover, the network allows developers to create DApps that are cross-chain by default and take out the unnecessary burden of reworking code to make a product work on several chains. With its comprehensive omnichain interoperability features, ZetaChain connects all blockchains, including non-smart contract chains, lowering the barriers to building cross-chain applications to interact with any chain.\n\nLearn more about ZetaChain"
