        "content": "Eclipse Launches Ethereum Layer-2 Running on the Solana Virtual Machine\n\nEclipse has announced the mainnet launch of its new general-purpose layer 2 scaling solution powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM).\n\nEclipse Mainnet will leverage the \u201cbest-in-class execution environment\u201d that Solana Virtual Machine offers for parallel transaction execution. This enables it to scale throughput linearly with hardware. It will also use Solana's localized fee markets to prevent fee spikes from congesting the whole chain.\n\nEclipse will use Celestia for data availability, which is expected to support much higher throughput than Ethereum.\n\nIn addition, Neon EVM is a smart contract which brings Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility to the layer-2 chain.\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum will be used for settlement, utilizing its security properties.

        "content": "The ether-to-bitcoin ratio dropped to a 14-month low as large token holders, including Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, moved coins to crypto exchanges, possibly as a prelude to selling.\n\nETH-BTC dipped to near 0.0602 on Tuesday, according to TradingView data, its lowest reading since July.\n\nThe recent price action extended a trend that began in September 2022, confirming some bearish forecasts from analysts for the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.\n\nMarcus Thielen, head of strategy and research at Matrixport, said Monday on CoinDeskTV that Ethereum\u2019s protocol revenues have been decreasing for the last three months, and expected BTC to continue outperforming the broader crypto market, including ETH.\n\nPopular crypto analyst Benjamin Cowen, founder of IntoTheCryptoverse, noted in an X post that a potential breakdown in the ETH\u2019s valuation versus BTC could be in the cards.\n\nLarge ETH investors on the move\n\nThe latest slide in price occurred as some prominent investors \u2013 also known as whales \u2013 have recently deposited a total of $60 million ETH to crypto exchanges, raising alarms about further declines in price.\n\nMarket participants closely follow the on-chain maneuvers of whales, as they are considered well-informed and have a sizable impact on the market. Depositing assets to an exchange usually signals intention to sell, while withdrawals suggest accumulation.\n\nMost recently, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin transferred 300 ETH \u2013 worth roughly $493,000 \u2013 to Kraken on Tuesday, according to blockchain data noted by security firm PeckShield. While the deposit is rather small, it spurred speculation among crypto watchers given Buterin\u2019s stature for Ethereum.\n\nAnother large holder deposited a total of 30,000 ETH \u2013 worth nearly $50 million \u2013 to crypto exchanges Binance, OKX and KuCoin over the past four days, blockchain sleuth Lookonchain noted.\n\nLookonchain also pointed out that a crypto wallet that acquired tokens from Ethereum\u2019s initial coin offering (ICO) nine years ago deposited Monday 6,000 ETH \u2013 worth just shy of $10 million \u2013 to Kraken.\n\nThis entity received roughly 255,000 ETH during the ICO, now worth $423 million Lookonchain noted. Given that the token\u2019s initial price was around 31 cents, selling the coinw now at $1,650 would represent a 527,000% profit."
