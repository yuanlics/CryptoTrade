        "title": "Ethereum Price Indicators Show Vulnerability to Bigger Correction - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Ethereum price started a fresh decline from the $1,940 resistance against the US Dollar. ETH retested $1,825 and is showing a few bearish signs.\n\nEthereum struggled to settle above the $1,925 and $1,940 resistance levels.\n\nThe price is trading below $1,880 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere was a break below a key bullish trend line with support near $1,895 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair could continue to move down if it clears the $1,800 support zone.\n\nEthereum Price Drops Again\n\nEthereum\u2019s price started a fresh increase above the $1,850 zone. ETH struggled to settle above the $1,925 and $1,940 resistance levels, similar to Bitcoin at $29,500.\n\nA high was formed near $1,939 and the price started a fresh decline. There was a sharp decline below the $1,900 and $1,880 levels. Besides, there was a break below a key bullish trend line with support near $1,895 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.\n\nA low is formed near $1,825 and the price is now consolidating losses. Ether price is now trading below $1,880 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nImmediate resistance is near the $1,850 level. It is close to the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $1,939 swing high to the $1,825 low. The next major resistance seems to be forming near $1,900 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nThe 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $1,939 swing high to the $1,825 low is also near the $1,900 level. A close above the $1,900 level might start a fresh increase. In the stated case, the price could rise toward the $1,940 resistance. Any more gains could send Ether toward the $2,000 resistance.\n\nMore Losses in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $1,900 resistance, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,825 level.\n\nThe next major support is near the $1,800 zone, below which ether price might drop toward the $1,740 support zone. Any more losses may perhaps take the price toward $1,700 in the near term.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is now gaining momentum in the bearish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is well below the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $1,800\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $1,900\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "Ethereum concludes April with a new ATH for ETH 2.0 deposit contracts - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "Ethereum staking and deposit contracts soar to new ATHs.\n\nETH struggles to regain bullish momentum as whales sell pressure prevails.\n\nNow is a good time to assess Ethereum and its native coin\u2019s performance as April comes to its conclusion. ETH managed to push to a new YTD high during mid-month but investors\u2019 confidence has dwindled since.\n\nHowever, there is one aspect of the network that may rejuvenate investors\u2019 interest.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nAlthough ETH\u2019s price action has been affected by shifting market dynamics, there is one area in which Ethereum has maintained a more pleasing performance.\n\nAccording to a recent Glassnode report, ETH 2.0 deposit contracts have been experiencing robust growth and recently reached a new all-time high.\n\n? #Ethereum $ETH Total Value in the ETH 2.0 Deposit Contract just reached an ATH of 18,868,062 ETH View metric:https://t.co/SzbMPqvhlb pic.twitter.com/B9sqXP3t8s \u2014 glassnode alerts (@glassnodealerts) April 30, 2023\n\nBut what does it mean for the network? Well, the higher deposit contracts reflect more confidence in the network.\n\nIt also reflects the growing amount of ETH staked. The total value of ETH staked stood at slightly over 19 million ETH and was at a new all-time high (ATH), at the time of writing.\n\nUnderstanding the lack of price correlation\n\nAlthough ETH staked and deposit contracts have reached new highs, ETH\u2019s price action has not necessarily reaped the benefits. This is largely because the cryptocurrency has experienced outflows since the second week of April.\n\nAs a result, its price tanked by a significant margin. ETH\u2019s $1918 press time price represented a 10.8% discount from its current 2023 high.\n\nSo why is ETH still holding back? Well, part of the reason is that whales have been trimming their balances. Addresses holding over 1000 ETH have contributed to selling pressure since the second week of April.\n\nPrecisely, the selling pressure from whales continued especially in the second half of April. As a result, bullish expectations were curtailed, and sell pressure was fueled by leveraged long liquidations. This brings us to the question of- What to expect in the first half of May.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s Ethereum market cap in BTC\u2019s terms\n\nWe observed a slight recovery in open interest in the last five days, as well as an increase in demand for leverage.\n\nThe recovery suggests that the market condition is improving gradually, but it also indicates low demand. As noted earlier, ETH whales are still selling. This means the bulls may still not show off their strength until the whales cease selling and contribute to bullish volumes."

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) Co-founder Clashes with Cardano Founder Over His Work at Ethereum.\n\nThe founder of the LUKSO network had insinuated that Cardano founder Hoskinson did not contribute to Ethereum.\n\nCharles Hoskinson, the founder of Cardano and co-founder of Ethereum, recently had a clash of words with Fabian Vogelsteller, another Ethereum co-founder and founder of the LUKSO blockchain. Vogelsteller had recently indicated that Hoskinson made no meaningful contributions to Ethereum.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nNotably, three of Ethereum\u2019s co-founders, Hoskinson, Vogelsteller, and Gavin Wood, left Ethereum and launched their respective networks. Responding to a two-year-old tweet that compared the progress of these networks, Vogelsteller noted that the comparison is only between LUKSO, the chain he founded, and Gavin Wood\u2019s Polkadot network.\n\nTo correct this picture a little bit:@VitalikButerin is the ethereum founder, so he doesn\u2019t count. @IOHK_Charles was never really a founder of ethereum. He built literally nothing for ethereum that I am aware of. He was just early on at the right place, at the time, hanging\u2026 https://t.co/zHFV4zLANR \u2014 Fabian Vogelsteller (@feindura) April 29, 2023\n\nHe stressed that Hoskinson cannot be regarded as an Ethereum co-founder because \u201cHe built literally nothing for Ethereum that I am aware of.\u201d According to Vogelsteller, Hoskinson was only fortunate to be at the right place at the right time \u201changing out.\u201d\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nTo buttress his point, Vogelsteller argued that he had been involved in Ethereum long before the network was formed and is fully aware of who made valuable contributions to the launch. He mentioned that the primary work that birthed the network was done before 2014, when most of the \u201cco-founders\u201d were onboard.\n\nHoskinson Responds\n\nResponding to Vogelsteller, Hoskinson employed his usual tactic of sarcasm, expressing gratitude to Vogelsteller for his comments. \u201c[\u2026] given my profound incompetence, I\u2019d love to meet the people behind Cardano. Pretty cool project to just somehow self-manifest,\u201d Hoskinson sarcastically remarked.\n\n\u201cI suppose Switzerland just materialized out of the ether,\u201d he said.\n\nThanks Fabian. Glad to get your opinion on my worth and contributions. I suppose Switzerland just materialized out of the ether. Also given my profound incompetence, I'd love to meet the people behind Cardano. Pretty cool project to just somehow self manifest \u2014 Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) April 30, 2023\n\nIt bears mentioning that Hoskinson is regarded as one of the biggest contributors to Ethereum, helping to launch the Ethereum Foundation and the ICO in June 2014, which raised 31,000 BTC.\n\nHoskinson registered the Foundation in Switzerland and served as CEO briefly before leaving to form IOHK in 2015 and Cardano in 2017. Hoskinson left due to disagreement on whether Ethereum should be for-profit or non-profit. He had argued that the project should be for-profit, while Vitalik Buterin disagreed. While there are reports that Hoskinson left willingly, others claim Buterin fired him.\n\nThe recent incident with Vogelsteller is not the first public disagreement between two Ethereum co-founders, as Hoskinson and Buterin had also thrown subtle jabs at each other in the past. Last December, as The Crypto Basic reported, Hoskinson sarcastically swiped at Buterin over his comments on Elon Musk\u2019s search for a new Twitter CEO."

        "title": "More TPS, less gas: Ethereum L2 Starknet outlines performance upgrades - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Layer-2 blockchain protocols have been in the spotlight in 2023, bringing major performance improvements to a variety of platforms and services operating in the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nZero-knowledge (ZK) proofs have been key in the roll-out of a variety of layer 2s, with the technology pioneered by the decentralized scaling network Starknet. StarkWare, the technology firm behind the scaling platform, has outlined plans to further improve its layer-2 network to meet an expected increase in users and developers through the rest of the year.\n\nCointelegraph caught up with Eli Ben-Sasson, president and co-founder of StarkWare, to unpack key points set out in a 2023 roadmap for Starknet. Chief among a list of to-dos is performance improvements that are centered around higher throughput and reduced latency of Starknet\u2019s network.\n\nBen-Sasson highlighted the focus on performance upgrades that are expected to deliver significantly higher transactions per second (TPS) than on Ethereum\u2019s mainnet at lower gas costs:\n\n\u201cThe most important thing is for builders and developers to have high throughput so that they can really build. Starknet is about increasing the computational abilities of Ethereum and we just want to provide this raw power to the hands of developers.\u201d\n\nStarknet v0.12.0 is expected to be released in the next month and is the culmination of a six-month sprint that involves transitioning Starknet\u2019s development stack to a Rust-based Sequencer as well as an open-source project that has built a Rust-Cairo virtual machine.\n\nStarkWare open-sourced its programming language compiler Cairo early in 2023, with the language aimed at driving the development of ZK-rollup and validity-proof-powered decentralized applications (DApps).\n\nRelated: Privacy, scaling drives use cases for zero-knowledge technology\n\nBen-Sasson added that Starknet continues to chase an ambitious target of processing at least 10 times the throughput of Ethereum at a tenth of the cost. He highlighted StarkEx\u2019s ability to deliver significant TPS on the decentralized exchange dYdX. StarkEx is another layer-2 scaling engine developed by StarkWare.\n\nAt times, dYdX processes up to 54 transactions per second, while the average TPS of Ethereum is around 10\u201312. Ben-Sasson also noted that these dYdX transactions are roughly four to five times larger than those on Ethereum, which bodes well for the improved scaling capabilities of Starknet in the near future:\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re often experiencing practical TPS or gas usage that is orders of magnitude greater than what Ethereum can deal with. I\u2019m very confident that this will also be replicated on Starknet.\u201d\n\nPerformance improvements have been prioritized as a result of developer and user feedback highlighting delays in transaction processing on Starknet. The next port of call is the reduction of transaction costs, which will be addressed by targeting the cost of storing data on Ethereum\u2019s mainnet.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to roll out Volition, which allows users to opt as to whether they want their data on or off-chain and this will be part of the base layer of the Starknet system.\u201d\n\nBen-Sasson said the release of off-chain data availability will complement Ethereum\u2019s in-development improvement proposal \u201cProto-Danksharding\u201d Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 4844, which will introduce a new type of transaction that carries binary large objects or \u201cblobs.\u201d The EIP fundamentally aims to provide cheaper transactions.\n\nStarknet is also aiming to deliver faster finality further down the 2023 roadmap, which will produce shorter and fixed interval block times on the network. This will be carried out with the introduction of a fee market to prioritize Starknet\u2019s network resources on users\u2019 willingness to pay for transactions, inspired by conventional market systems:\n\n\u201cMarket mechanisms are a very good way to solve this. Blockchain didn\u2019t invent this \u2014 blockchains adopted this from just the conventional world. That\u2019s how you prioritize resources and allow users to signal this.\u201d\n\nA number of Ethereum layer-2 protocols have begun rolling out ZK-rollups to further improve efforts to provide faster and cheaper transactions to the smart contract blockchain network. This includes the likes of Polygon and ConsenSys.\n\nMagazine: Here\u2019s how Ethereum\u2019s ZK-rollups can become interoperable"
