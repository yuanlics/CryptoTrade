        "content": "A crypto strategist who nailed the end of the Bitcoin bull market in 2021 is warning Ethereum holders, saying that ETH could witness significant downside risk.\n\nPseudonymous analyst Pentoshi tells his 677,100 Twitter followers that bearish momentum could go to the next level for Ethereum if it trades below a key support level.\n\n\u201cBelow the gray area COULD get ugly. I\u2019ll talk a long down there with a tight stop. It\u2019s a nice spot for some short to mid term invalidation for longs. If we start to close, below it\u2019s an easy out and a paper cut.\u201d\n\nLooking at Pentoshi\u2019s chart, he appears to be referring to support around $1,480. At time of writing, Ethereum is worth $1,576.\n\nFellow analyst Smart Contracter is also bearish on Ethereum. According to the crypto trader, Ethereum has taken out the diagonal support of a bearish continuation pattern.\n\n\u201cBear flag structure breaking down on ETH.\u201d\n\nLooking at the analyst\u2019s chart, he appears to be predicting a move down for Ethereum toward the $1,480 price level.\n\nAs for Bitcoin (BTC), Pentoshi believes that the king crypto is not yet done correcting. According to the crypto strategist, he sees BTC going all the way down to $21,500 before bulls could mount a small bounce.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d love to see this and would be wanting to play it for a bounce.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $22,490.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Per recent updates, the ETH Denver event is in progress with even more announcements and features being released to the crypto community.\n\nERC-4337 launched\n\nEthereum has for years supported three different iterations of smart contracts, that is, ERC-20, ERC-721, and ERC-1155. However, at this year\u2019s ETH Denver, a new class of ERC-20 tokens was launched, ERC-4337.\n\nReports suggest that ERC-4337 aims to bring a new solution of providing investors with accounts that can be easily managed, offering bank-like features. It is reported that this standard would allow investors to set limits for their accounts, just like in banks.\n\nProponents claim this standard will make crypto more user-friendly, promoting faster adoption as people can now use standard passwords and simple two-factor authentication. With ERC-4337, investors will no longer need to write down long seed phrases.\n\nEthereum Foundation security researcher Yoav Weiss said the standard will be revolutionary since \u201cthe next billion users are not going to write 12 words on a piece of paper.\u201d He also highlighted that better usability is critical to cryptographic keys.\n\nWhat else happened?\n\nThe launch of ERC-4337 was one of the many standout events at ETH Denver. Many discourses and panel discussions explored the crypto landscape.\n\nFor instance, Robert Habermeier, Polkadot\u2019s founder, took centerstage at ETH Denver, discussing various aspects of technology, tooling, and scaling for an hour.\n\nCult DAO has also played a significant role in making ETH Denver successful, presenting a small presentation. There have been lots of mentions of CULT DAO\u2019s presence.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/iamcomingundone/status/1632016243921395713\n\nPolygon, another popular crypto network, also participated in the ETH Denver. Polygon\u2019s presentation was done on Mar. 4, where they discussed their Polygon ID. Another layer-2 scaling solution, Arbitrum, made an appearance. Its CTO and co-founder, Harry Kalodner, discussed the latest developments in the layer-2 realm.\n\nThere was also a panel discussion between crypto influencers, including David Palmer, Victor Rortvedt, and Aaron Wright.\n\nThe theme was \u201cInvestment DAOs in Adolescence \u2013 Lessons from the Early Days of a New Form of Human Coordination Panel.\u201d They looked into the possibility of a new organizational form for DAO.\n\nPerhaps to lighten the mood, a toilet paper with Sam Bankman Fried\u2019s face was seen in the washrooms.\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "title": "Ethereum In An \u2018Obvious Accumulation Range Of All Time\u2019 \u2013 Preparing For $5,000? - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Ethereum is in an \u201cobvious accumulation range of all time,\u201d this crypto analyst notes on a Twitter post on March 3.\n\nWill Ethereum Spring To $5K?\n\nCrypto analyst \u201cMoon\u201d thinks there could be more upside potential for ETH in the near future, strongly believing that many would want to get involved once the coin has broken out, rallying to the $5,000 and $7,000 trade range. As it is, ETH prices are within a bear formation in higher timeframes. Still, it is relatively solid from its lows in November 2022.\n\n$ETH in one of the most obvious accumulation ranges of all time, lot of hindsight analysis will be done when its at $5k, $7k, whatever in a few years why you didnt buy more here, and people are flipping out over $100 moves pic.twitter.com/HS9fJuHTfx \u2014 moon (@MoonOverlord) March 3, 2023\n\nETH is trading at around $1,580 and has failed to breach the $1,700 resistance level marking February highs. On the lower end, the coin has support at about the $1,500 line.\n\nFor the uptrend to take shape, buyers need to push ETH above February resistance lines and register new Q1 2023 highs. This would comprise a bullish breakout, setting the base for another leg up that may thrust ETH to new all-time highs above $5,000 to $7,000. It is a preview that ETH proponents hold, citing technical and fundamental factors.\n\nAccording to the analyst, at present levels, traders and investors wishing to hold the coin for months and years should be buying the dips lest they be left by the ETH bull train.\n\nEven though proponents are optimistic about the ETH\u2019s prospect, it should be noted that it must break above the current range, ideally with expanding participation. Should this be the case, then not only will ETH rally above $2,000, but it stands to possibly more than double, rallying to retest 2021 highs.\n\nAt that time, ETH soared to retest $4,900, a high, more than tripling from 2017 peaks when ETH tested $1,300. Presently, the coin is above that critical high of late 2017, acting as support.\n\nWhat Will Make Or Break ETH?\n\nStill, traders and investors should proceed with caution. Several fundamental factors, as the events of 2022 reveal, could impact the crypto markets, including ETH.\n\nFor instance, despite decreasing inflation, the United States Federal Reserve has said it could increase interest rates as a tool. Besides, the economy remains weak with relatively weak labor conditions, factors that the central bank might consider.\n\nOn the more positive side, ETH bulls cite the network\u2019s \u201cburn rate.\u201d So far, billions of ETH have been taken out of supply. Over the months, ETH\u2019s inflation could drop even further, making the coin deflationary.\n\nFeatured Image From Canva, Chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "Big Eyes Coin, Bitcoin and Ethereum Capitalising On the Momentum from January - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "The year 2022 was nothing short of a catastrophic year for digital assets, with the crypto world caught up in the chaos of one of the industry\u2019s largest scams. One of the biggest crypto exchanges FTX was a two-week nightmare that experts and analysts predicted will damage and have a long-term effect on crypto users around the world. Albeit, as we just start the month of March, crypto investors may be able to breathe a sigh of relief. Because since January a few coins have been experiencing a bullish-like trend, which crypto enthusiasts hope will continue.\n\nAs crypto users want to invest in the market\u2019s more established digital assets, a \u2018big-eyed\u2019 feline is purring away and grabbing the attention of investors. Because of its enticing features and advantages for investors, Big Eyes Coin (BIG) is becoming more and more well-known.\n\nNonetheless, several well-known cryptocurrencies had a difficult 2022 as a result of the collapse of the FTX exchange. In this challenging time, new cryptocurrencies like Big Eyes Coin saw great improvements.\n\nMake BIG Returns with Big Eyes Coin Loot Boxes\n\nA meme coin project called Big Eyes Coin (BIG) seeks to bolster the crypto market by bringing wealth and more users. It is a cat meme coin that aims to become accepted on the Ethereum blockchain and offer more benefits to its community. Big Eyes Coin is a DeFi solution that promises to combine exchanges, liquidity pool purchases, staking, and other features like NFTs and the metaverse. Since the start of its presale, the meme coin has raised a sizable sum of money and has already gained widespread attention.\n\nLoot boxes will be available for the Big Eyes Coin community. Several adventure-style video games feature mystery boxes called loot boxes. These may be used to unlock new in-game goods, weapons, or clothes. They come randomly when playing a game.\n\nA fortunate member of the BIG community might win up to $100,000 in tokens from one of the three available loot boxes, which are all filled with $HUGE tokens. Today a fourth box has been launched called the \u201cExcali-Paw Master Chest\u201d worth $9,999 and will have rewards ranging from $10k to $1,000,000.\n\nBitcoin \u2013 Where It All Began\n\nAfter running a mining network for almost two years, Satoshi Nakamoto established the Bitcoin (BTC) blockchain in 2009. The coin\u2019s introduction as a proof-of-work currency ushered in a new era of decentralised finance in which crypto tokens will dominate a sizable portion of the world financial market.\n\nBefore being made accessible for trading and exchanging, Bitcoin (BTC) was once a token that users had to mine. As users held power over the token\u2019s future, the mining was compatible with its decentralisation aims. Specialised graphics processing units like ASICs can still mine Bitcoin, even though doing so on mobile devices is no longer cost-effective. This has drastically restricted mining to large companies.\n\nBTC relied on scarcity rather than the qualities of the protocol to climb the cryptocurrency rankings. Its main contribution to DeFi was the development of private, secure blockchain technology, which increased user security and promoted the transfer of assets throughout the world.\n\nBlockchains also record each transaction that users make. Only for security reasons may the data be obtained; they cannot be used to identify somebody. Public keys are generated for each transaction, and each user has a private key. For tracing transactions on the blockchain, the public keys operate as reference points.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"
