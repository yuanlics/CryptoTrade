        "content": "2023 has been a great year for Ethereum (ETH), summing up $74.5 billion to its capitalization year-to-date (YTD). This amounts to an increase of 50.9% from the $146.31 billion market cap observed on January 1.\n\nMoreover, investors are continuously staking ETH, with subsequent all-time highs for the total value staked in the Ethereum 2.0 smart contract. It recently achieved the value of a $32 million stake, according to data from CryptoQuant retrieved by Finbold on November 4.\n\nEthereum: Total Value Staked. Source: CryptoQuant\n\nWithin the current positive outlook for Ethereum and the cryptocurrency market expectations for a coming bull market in 2024, Finbold asked ChatGPT to forecast a price range for ETH by the start of the next year.\n\nChatGPT-4: Ethereum price will be between $3,000 to $10,000 in 2024\n\nNotably, the ChatGPT-4 forecasts Ethereum price to trade between $3,000 to $10,000 in 2024. The lowest price in this range would mean an increase of 63% for ETH from its price of $1,835 per ether by press time.\n\n\u201cPredicting Ethereum\u2019s price in 2024 involves analyzing current trends and factors. As of now, Ethereum\u2019s price moves impelled by increased adoption, platform upgrades, and market sentiment. Its price could range between $3000 and $10,000 by 2024. The breadth of this forecast attributes to the volatile crypto market.\u201d \u2014 ChatGPT-4\n\nInterestingly, the GPT-4 artificial intelligence has also mentioned \u201cexpanding institutional adoption\u201d and the role of ETH 2.0 proof of stake network for its price prediction.\n\nEthereum price prediction for 2024 Source: Finbold (ChatGPT-4 Telegram Bot)\n\nAdditionally, it has also pointed toward technical analysis indicators to justify the mentioned price range for Ethereum.\n\n\u201cAnalyzing with indicators like Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), Relative Strength Index (RSI), and Bollinger Bands, Ethereum is on a bullish trend.\u201d \u2014 ChatGPT-4\n\nHowever, the ChatGPT also mentioned that factors like regulatory changes or a significant tech advancement by competitors could potentially drop ETH\u2019s value in 2024. With that in mind, investors and cryptocurrency traders must continuously monitor their position and adjust accordingly as the new year arrives.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nThe second-largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum (ETH), has seen a surge in exchange outflows.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to IntoTheBlock, $210 million worth of ETH left centralized exchanges (CEXs) in the week, representing the highest seven-day net outflows since August.\n\nExchange outflows often suggest that investors are transferring assets from centralized exchanges to private wallets.\n\nThis week, $210M worth of ETH left CEXs, the largest 7-day net outflows since August. pic.twitter.com/frYWasXvwZ \u2014 IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) November 3, 2023\n\nOne of the most popular explanations for rising exchange outflows is that long-term investors are withdrawing assets to retain them for a longer period. This can be interpreted as a sign of confidence in the cryptocurrency's long-term potential.\n\nThe surge in exchange outflows has ignited speculation about the price of Ethereum. Many are wondering if this bullish trend will lead to a recovery and maybe boost the price of ETH.\n\nAt the time of writing, ETH was up 1.57% in the last 24 hours to $1,836.\n\nOn-chain analytics firm Santiment believes ETH's rise above $1,800 was aided by network growth and exchange outflows. It states that if the long-term trend of network growth continues and exchange outflows are sustained, ETH might have the justification to cross $2,000 again.\n\nEthereum volumes are on rise\n\nAccording to IntoTheBlock, the weekly value of assets settled on Ethereum (including ETH, stablecoins and the top 50 tokens) reached its highest level since the SVB crash in March.\n\nThe volume settled last week on Ethereum surpassed $213 billion on the mainnet alone, with an additional $16 billion being transacted between Arbitrum, Optimism and Base.\n\nThe increasing amount of volume settled on-chain might show that fundamentals are improving.\n\nThough market prices may see a short-term correction, improved on-chain activity and increased spot-driven inflows indicate that strong demand is driving crypto's advance."

        "title": "Bitcoin And Ethereum: Crypto Pundit Says Expect A Repeat Of Massive 2019 Rally - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Partner at the Venture Capital firm Placeholder Capital and prominent figure in the crypto community, Chris Burniske, has given an instance where assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum could see a repeat of what happened in mid-2019.\n\nNew Highs Before A \u201cFinal Wipeout\u201d\n\nIn a post shared on his X (formerly Twitter) platform, Burniske mentioned that a repeat of mid-2019 could happen if the top two cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and Ethereum, were to \u201crip\u201d from their current levels. If that happens, the crypto founder believes that the broader crypto market could follow suit.\n\nAs to how these crypto tokens could go, he noted that they could rise enough to make people believe that they could hit new all-time highs soon, but that may not be the case as these investors could endure a \u201cfinal wipeout\u201d soon after (possibly in the first quarter of next year) with these tokens steady declining to higher lows.\n\nTo drive home his point, Burniske suggested that Bitcoin and Ethereum\u2019s current price action shared similarities to the period between December 2019 and January 2019 before the \u201cpainful descent into March 2020 lows.\u201d According to him, although that period was the COVID era, \u201ceverything is also the same about the actors on the stage.\u201d\n\nBurniske seemed to be certain about his assertions. In a subsequent post, he warned investors that the rollercoaster \u201ccould get extreme\u201d in relation to what he had said earlier and urged them to have their seatbelts on.\n\nETH price sitting at $1,844 | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nMarket Cycle And Macro Factors Affecting Bitcoin And Ethereum\n\nMany didn\u2019t seem to react well to Burniske\u2019s projections, considering that it could mean that the crypto market and everyone in it could be in more pain, even if a massive rally (as the crypto founder predicts) is likely to happen before that.\n\nA particular X user, however, seemed to agree with his position as he stated that Burniske\u2019s prediction makes so much sense as that is how the \u201ccycle psychology\u201d works, just that this time, it happens to line up \u201cperfectly\u201d with some highly likely macro scenarios. Burniske responded to the post as he agreed that those were the points he was trying to drive home.\n\nOne of these macro scenarios, which was alluded to, could be the rising inflation and how the Federal Reserve and other authorities globally are increasing interest rates to battle the economic downturn. Bloomberg analyst Mike McGlone had once mentioned how Bitcoin could crash to $10,000, with inflation being one of the factors that could lead to the decline.\n\nAnother crypto analyst, Nicholas Merten, had also noted that Bitcoin could decline further if the Feds do not do enough to curb the rising inflation.\n\nFeatured image from The Street, chart from Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Cross-chain non-fungible token (NFT) platform Magic Eden has partnered with Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) creator Yuga Labs to launch a new Ethereum marketplace, according to a press release on Nov. 4.\n\nThe new marketplace\u2014to be launched by the end of 2023\u2014will focus on royalties to uphold the principle of ownership and empower creators to \u201ccontinue receiving royalty payments for their original work.\u201d\n\nNFT creator royalty is a percentage of the sales price that the original creator of an NFT receives every time it is sold or transferred to a new owner. It allows creators to continue earning from their digital assets as they change hands in the secondary market, providing an ongoing source of income and incentivizing artists and content creators to participate in the NFT space.\n\nMagic Eden co-founder and CEO Jack Lu noted in the statement:\n\n\u201cWe remain committed to the betterment of the web3 creator ecosystem, steadfast in our belief that we should champion creators who are the heart and soul of the industry\u2026 Right now, it\u2019s a priority to provide creatives with the support they deserve with creator royalty programs.\u201d\n\nThe press release claimed that the new platform will be the first major Ethereum NFT marketplace that is \u201ccontractually obligated\u201d to pay royalties to creators for secondary sales. The \u201cunified vision\u201d of the companies involves \u201ccreating a fair and rewarding ecosystem for imaginative content contributors.\u201d\n\nCreator royalties are non-negotiable\n\nMagic Eden and Yuga Labs have unequivocally announced that \u201crespecting creator royalties is non-negotiable.\u201d Therefore, Yuga Labs will exclusively work with marketplaces that pay royalties for all its future collections, according to the press release.\n\nBoth firms emphasized that the new Ethereum-based platform will be a testament to their long-term \u201ccommitment to protecting creator royalties.\u201d The jointly launched platform will also aim to encourage innovation by boosting the number of builders and creators.\n\nDaniel Alegre, CEO of Yuga Labs, said:\n\n\u201cMagic Eden is putting their money where their mouth is, and together we are supporting the building of an Ethereum marketplace that will back creators, without whom web3 would not exist.\u201d\n\nLu added that the new marketplace will \u201creset\u201d the royalty allocation standard and hopes that its principles will be adopted throughout the ecosystem.\n\nIn a post on X, Lu also noted that Magic Eden has already \u201cmanaged to solve\u201d the problem of royalties on Solana. The firm partnered with Metaplex, the protocol that enables NFT minting on Solana, to roll out royalty protection protocols.\n\n\u201cNow, Royalties are the norm on SOL. And we believe we can do the same on Eth.\u201d\n\nOpen taunt to OpenSea\n\nThe press release seemingly taunted OpenSea, one of the largest NFT marketplaces that made royalties optional in August. Highlighting their firm stance in favor of royalties, Yuga Labs and Magic Eden noted that they have \u201ca clear stance amidst a sea of other marketplaces who turn their backs on creative entrepreneurs.\u201d\n\nYuga Labs has publicly criticized OpenSea\u2019s stance on royalties before. In August, Yuga Labs said it would shortly end support for Seaport, OpenSea\u2019s marketplace contract, indicating that its NFTs will not be available on the marketplace in the future."

        "content": "Share:\n\nEthereum price, along with Bitcoin, is presently moving sideways after hitting $1,857 and $35,000 respectively.\n\nSmall-cap cryptocurrencies are making gains fuelled by high investor participation.\n\nThe total value of all other cryptocurrencies, excluding BTC and ETH, has risen by 14% but needs another 9.3% increase to recover all the recent losses.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum price initiated the bullish momentum that pulled up the entire cryptocurrency market. However, even as their rally comes to a halt, the rest of the altcoins seem to continue making the most of the situation, resulting in a significant rise over the past couple of days.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum price halt\n\nBitcoin, after hitting $35,000, stepped back for a while, and Ethereum price did the same after reaching $1,857. Both the cryptocurrencies for the past few days have been moving sideways as the market cools down, but there is an inkling that this sideways price action could result in a decline.\n\nIn the case of Ethereum, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator contributes to this forecast as the receding green bars on the histogram suggest the bullishness is waning. If this is followed by the signal line (orange) moving over the MACD line (blue), a bearish crossover would be confirmed.\n\nThis would occur only if Ethereum price loses the support of $1,827, which coincides with the crucial 61.8% Fibonacci Retracement from $2,005 to $1,539. The ensuing bearish momentum would not only confirm a bearish crossover but also bring ETH down to 50% Fibonacci line at $1,772.\n\nETH/USD 1-day chart\n\nHowever, if the sideways momentum meets bullish momentum via broader market cues and the $1,827 line is tested as a support floor, a recovery is on the cards. Breaching the 78.6% Fib retracement at $1,906 would not only invalidate the bearish thesis but also flip $1,900 into support.\n\nOther cryptocurrencies are faring rather well\n\nWhile BTC and ETH are seeing waning bullishness, the past few days have been spectacular for altcoin investors. Many layer-2 cryptocurrencies, as well as Decentralized Finance (DeFi) tokens, have seen significant rises along with the majority of the layer-1 tokens.\n\nAnalytics platform IntoTheBlock, in regards to this shift in capital, stated,\n\n\"This week's trend suggests this rotation is beginning to take place as Bitcoin and Ether trend sideways while DeFi and alternative L1 tokens record a strong rebound.\n\nThis was verified by the fact that SushiSwap noted a 63% rise in the past three days. Other top DeFi tokens like THORChain (RUNE), PancakeSwap (CAKE), and Aave (AAVE) noted about 35%, 31%, and 15%, respectively.\n\nThis resulted in the market capitalization of altcoins, excluding Bitcoin and Ethereum, observing a 14.67% growth, adding 47.13 billion since mid-October. This has brought the market cap to $368 billion, but for the recent losses to be recovered, altcoins would need to collectively raise the market capitalization by 9.38% and register inflows worth $34.55 billion to bring it to a 2023 high of $402.5 billion.\n\nAltcoin market capitalization\n\nHistorically, crypto cycles have followed a pattern of Bitcoin leading the first surge, followed by Ethereum rising, and eventually, capital progressively being allocated to lower-cap and riskier bets. However, if the broader market cues turn bearish, these altcoins could also note sideways movement.\n\nRead more - SushiSwap price rallying by 63% in four days causes $4.8 million worth of short liquidations"
