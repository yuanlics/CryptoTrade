        "content": "Ethereum price has finally recorded some pullback after a 40% rally in January, giving investors an opportunity to buy ETH at lower levels. The ETH price hit a high of $1,674 last Saturday and fell under $1,550 today due to profit-taking by traders as the rally had no significant pullback.\n\nWhile investors speculate whether this is the best level to buy Ethereum, crypto analyst Michael van de Poppe believes there\u2019s more to it.\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum (ETH) Price Can Fall To $1,450\n\nPopular crypto analyst Michael van de Poppe in a tweet on January 25 predicts a further fall in the Ethereum price to near $1,450. He believes Ethereum price may witness some rebound from the crucial support level of $1,550, but the actual bounce for another rally will come only from below the crucial support level.\n\n\u201cSome slow grind upwards and then one more sweep in the coming days and the correction should be over and we\u2019ll continue the party.\u201d\n\nEthereum (ETH) price fell nearly 5% in the last 24 hours to hit a low of $1,530. Profit booking by traders and selloff by whales were the primary reasons behind the recent fall in ETH prices.\n\nAccording to Whale Alert data, a whale dumped 24,768 ETH worth $38 million to crypto exchange Coinbase today. Whales had transferred ETH worth almost $200 million to crypto exchanges and liquidity pools in the last few days.\n\nOn-chain data by Santiment confirms profit-taking transactions since Ethereum hit a high of $1,674. The Ethereum Ratio of Daily On-Chain Transaction Volume in Profit to Loss jumps higher on January 20 indicating a rise in profit-taking transactions.\n\nMoreover, the social dominance of Ethereum has hit its highest value since July last year after the price drop, indicating traders looking for a \u201cbuy the dip\u201d opportunity.\n\nEthereum Price Shows Slight Recovery\n\nEthereum (ETH) price fell over 5% in the last 24 hours, with the price currently trading at $1,553. The 24-hour low and high are $1,530 and $1,637, respectively. Furthermore, the trading volume increased by 14% after the fall, indicating a slight increase in interest among traders.\n\nHowever, ETH price will remain under pressure until the U.S. Federal Reserve\u2018s rate hike decision on February 1 and the fourth-quarter GDP data due on Thursday.\n\nAlso Read: Reasons Why Bitcoin (BTC) Price Rally Is Likely Over"

        "content": "Ethereum developers launch Withdrawal-Mainnet-Shadow-Fork-1 ahead of Shanghai.\n\nVitalik Buterin proposes Stealth Addresses to tackle privacy concerns on the network.\n\nThe developers of Ethereum [ETH] made a significant advancement towards deploying the Shanghai update by creating a \u201cShadow Fork.\u201d Additionally, Vitalik Buterin suggested a method for guaranteeing transaction privacy on the Ethereum network in a related development. What effects could these developments have on the network and ETH?\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nA Fork before the Fork\n\nAn Ethereum engineer named Marius Van Der Wijden announced the Mainnet Shadow Fork on 23 January. Wijden planned to introduce rogue nodes into the testnet that would send out faulty blocks and messages to trick other nodes into joining a phony fork of the network.\n\nWithdrawal-Mainnet-Shadow-Fork-1 is finalizing ??? It started out with a few issues because the config wasn't correctly applied on geth (we disallow overriding the mainnet config). The config is applied correctly and all nodes are in agreement. We will start some evil nodes,. \u2014 MariusVanDerWijden (@vdWijden) January 23, 2023\n\nThis testnet was dubbed Withdrawal-Mainnet-Shadow-Fork-1. It also appeared to simulate the requirements for withdrawing staked Ether (ETH).\n\nA shadow fork is an interim test fork that implements some of the necessary protocol modifications before the full Shanghai hard fork. Before the big switch to a proof-of-stake network, known as the Merge, which occurred last year. Ethereum employed multiple shadow forks for testing.\n\nVitalik going stealth\n\nEthereum\u2019s founder and current CEO, Vitalik Buterin, also proposed the implementation of a feature he named \u201cStealth Addresses.\u201d In an article, while highlighting the difficulty of ensuring privacy in the ecosystem, Buterin stated:\n\n\u201cFixing this state of affairs is a serious topic.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, Stealth Addresses would be a way to conceal the true ownership of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and domain names registered using the Ethereum Name Service (ENS). Stealth addresses are created by wallets, which scramble public key addresses for anonymous transactions. A unique \u201cspending key\u201d key is required to access these incognito exchanges.\n\nIf the Dev team\u2019s shadow fork turned out to be successful, users could withdraw their staked ETH without fear of the network being compromised. The lack of privacy concerns on the Ethereum network might also be solved if Vitalik\u2019s suggested stealth address could be deployed. If these updates increase the network\u2019s popularity, ETH\u2019s value may rise.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ETHs worth today?\n\nDevelopment activity decent, but price drops\n\nThe Development Activity indicator on Santiment could be used to get an idea of how busy the developers are. As of this writing, the Metric indicated that developer input had nearly reached 50. As the Shanghai update approaches, this may very well climb further.\n\nOn the daily timescale chart, Ethereum traded at about $1,618. In addition, the price continued, the little decline it had been experiencing over the previous 48 hours -until press time \u2013 by dropping by almost.50%.\n\nHowever, it was apparent that the price action was higher than the long and short Moving Averages (blue and yellow lines). The support level was also shown by the yellow and blue lines."

        "title": "How Long Will the Ethereum LSD Narrative Last? Talking 2023 Trends with Nansen\u2019s Martin Lee - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "Ethereum Liquid Staking tokens are going through the roof. Lido is up 150% in a month, similarly Frax Shares, while other protocols, such as Rocket Pool, are also catching up.\n\nBut that\u2019s not all. NFTs are also seeing massive volumes for multiple consecutive weeks, showing little signs of slowing down.\n\nThe question now is for how long this positive trend will sustain \u2013 is it a dead cat bounce or the beginning of a much-awaited recovery?\n\nTo help us crunch the numbers and interpret some of the on-chain data is Martin Lee \u2013 a Data Journalist from the popular cryptocurrency analytics firm Nansen.\n\nLiquid Staking Coins Trend Upwards, but for How Long?\n\nEthereum LSD, or liquid staking derivative coins, have been the hottest story of 2023 so far, with many of the protocols seeing tremendous growth in the value locked and, by extension \u2013 popularity.\n\nTo those unfamiliar with the concept, we have a comprehensive guide on Ethereum liquid staking.\n\nAs opposed to staking directly into the Beacon depositor contract, LSD protocols allow users to stake their ETH and receive a synthetic version of it \u2013 a new token, per se \u2013 that can then be used across various DeFi applications to trade, farm, provide liquidity, and so forth.\n\nSpeaking on the matter, Lee outlined two major advantages that, according to him, are part of the reasons why the narrative has grown so strong. For instance, h outlined that staking ETH directly into the smart contract is \u201creally capital inefficient\u201d because of a few things. First, the capital requirement is quite considerable (32 ETH), and the lockup period used to be unknown.\n\nTherefore:\n\nThe natural solution to this would be liquid staking. You get a liquid token in exchange for whatever you\u2019ve staked (in this case ETH). For example, if you stake ETH with Lido, you get stETH, which is fully liquid and you can interact with various DeFi protocols.\n\nLiquid staking solves both the problems of the staked ETH being illiquid and the high capital requirement to participate in ETH staking.\n\nNative tokens of LSD protocols, such as Lido\u2019s LDO, for instance, have been on the run lately. LDO itself is up close to 150% in the past month, similar to other protocols of the kind like Rocket Pool and others.\n\nThe catalyst for this seems to have been the recent announcement that Ethereum\u2019s Shanghai upgrade will hit the public testnet in February and the mainnet in 2023. This is a pivotal moment for the Ethereum community because it will allow validators to unlock the 32 ETH they\u2019ve staked in the Beacon contract for the first time. The consensus seems to be that this would increase the demand for liquid staking alternatives, which is the predominant reason for the current popularity and increase in their valuations.\n\nOn when the narrative will inevitably die out, Lee says that most trends like this typically slow down on the date of the event that prompted their emergence in the first place \u2013 in this case, the Shanghai upgrade.\n\nTypically, the trend dies out on the date of the event itself. For example, the ETH Merge was such a huge topic, but on the Merge date itself, people completely stopped talking about it.\n\nNFT Volumes Also Pop\n\nAt the time of our recording, NFT trading volume was going through the roof, and even though there was a certain decline in the past couple of days, the market saw a considerable rebound.\n\nIn fact, by January 17th, ETH NFTs saw five consecutive weeks of up-only volumes.\n\nCommenting on the matter, Lee said that it\u2019s more or less this is in line with what we\u2019ve seen in past cycles.\n\nWhenever we have long periods of very boring action, where there\u2019s basically no movements, prices are extremely stable, NFTs tend to go on their own mini-run whenever that happens. In the past 2-3 months, the price action across the board was extremely stagnant. Then, NFTs kind of went on their own mini-run, with some projects doing better than others.\n\nTo find out what Lee thinks the trends of this year will look like, as well as whether or not the Shanghai upgrade will cause a lot of selling pressure on ETH\u2019s price, don\u2019t hesitate to watch the full video above."

        "content": "Top NFT Collections Fear Return of High Gas Fees and Look to Layer 1s\n\nBy: Samuel Haig \u2022 Loading...\n\nNFT News\n\nDespite Ethereum being the birth-place of NFTs, some of the network\u2019s most popular NFT communities are expanding onto alternative Layer 1 blockchains. The reason? The threat Ethereum\u2019s high gas fees may return.\n\nOn Thursday, Pudgy Penguins and Doodles both announced they will expand beyond Ethereum. Pudgy Penguins launched cross-chain bridging between Ethereum, Arbitrum, Polygon, and BNB Chain, while Doodles announced its new Doodles 2 project will live on the Flow blockchain.\n\nCore Motivation\n\nBoth teams said securing low gas fees for their users was a core motivation behind exploring other alternative smart contract chains. Pudgy Penguins warned that with less than 2M transactions currently processed by Ethereum daily, a surge in on-chain activity could drive gas fees up by \u201c1,000% or more\n\nThe 2021 NFT boom was a major source of congestion for the Ethereum network, with average transaction fees for simple transactions spiking above $50 while complex smart contract interactions cost hundreds of dollars in late 2021 and early 2022.\n\nAccording to BitInfoCharts, average Ethereum transaction fees fell 93.5% from $63 in November 2021 to just $4 today.\n\nDespite leading players in the NFT sector making significant gas fee optimizations in 2022 and on-chain activity remaining low during recent months, the moves from Pudgy Penguins and Doodles to explore alternative chains suggests many developers are bracing for the possibility that Ethereum fees could soon spike again.\n\nNFT Provenance\n\n\u201cEthereum is an ideal base chain for preserving your NFT\u2019s provenance over time,\u201d Pudgy Penguins said in a blog post. \u201cHowever, Ethereum mainnet\u2019s user experience is not as friendly as it could be for people new to the technology.\u201d\n\nPudgy Penguins teamed up with Layer Zero, a cross-chain interoperability protocol, to launch its bridge.\n\nDeFi Alpha Premium Content DeFi Daily | Weekdays\n\nDeFi Alpha Letter | Weekly\n\nDefiant Podcast Transcript | Weekly\n\nInbox Dump | Saturday\n\nWeekly Recap | Sunday Looking for Alpha?

The team said it chose Arbitrum, Polygon, and BNB Chain for its first multi-chain foray due to their \u201crapidly growing usage and exposure.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt must be easy for the next wave of users, that are in the hundreds of millions, to interact and become a part of the Pudgy Penguins ecosystem,\u201d the team said. \u201cBy enabling the Lil Pudgys to go cross-chain, we\u2019re setting up the Pudgy Penguins ecosystem to reach millions of people.\u201d\n\nPudgy Penguins has a market cap of $77.2M, according to NFT Floor Price. Its floor price is $8,710, a 246% gain in two months.\n\nAlso on Jan. 25, Doodles, a popular PFP avatar collection limited to 10,000 NFTs, announced it will launch Doodles 2 on Flow.\n\nDoodles 2 will allow users to customize their NFT. After minting a base-level doodle and selecting traits such as skin tone and hair color, holders can then customize their NFT with digital wearables such as clothing, accessories, and gadgets of \u201cvarying tiers and rarity.\u201d\n\nSpace Doodle\n\n\u201cIn 2023, we\u2019re opening the gates so Doodles can live everywhere,\u201d Doodles tweeted. \u201cThanks to Flow\u2019s nonexistent gas fees, Doodles holders can enjoy endless customization to create their own uniquely personalized characters.\u201d\n\nDoodles said it will mint the first digital wearables for the new project on Jan. 31. The team hinted that a second set of wearables will be launched roughly one month later.\n\nUnannounced Experiences\n\nDoodles 2 wearables buyers will also receive \u201cDoodles 2 Beta Passes\u201d granting access to the project\u2019s private beta launch.\n\nThe team said it will continue to invest in its Ethereum-based ecosystem, including upcoming \u201cunannounced experiences\u201d it plans to launch on the chain.\n\nDoodles is the 14th largest NFT collection by market cap with $114.7M, according to NFT Price Floor. The collection\u2019s last sale was $11,475, up nearly 80% from its local low in November."
