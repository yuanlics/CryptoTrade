Please send feedback and revision requests to [email protected].\n\n\n\nEthereum's transition to proof of stake brought significant changes to the network, including a more predictable yield for investors. Unlike proof of work, which relies on miners to validate transactions and secure the network, proof of stake involves validators holding a stake in the network and earning yield in ether for their support.\n\nCoinFund, a crypto investment firm, is attempting to standardize the yield model to create a new benchmark yield rate for Web3.\n\nRELATED INDICES See crypto indices\n\nIn this episode, CoinFund President Chris Perkins explains how CoinFund's new Composite Ethereum Staking Rate ('CESR') aims to provide investors with a clear and comparable metric that can serve as the foundation for new financial products for the crypto space such as basis swaps and the development of a forward curve tied to Ethereum's interest rate.\n\nThis episode is brought to you by our sponsor CleanSpark.\n\nAbout CleanSpark\n\nCleanSpark (NASDAQ: CLSK) is America\u2019s Bitcoin Miner\u2122.

Active addresses on Solana fell by 12% in April compared to the previous month, the data show.\n\nEthereum (ETH) had 4.9 million active addresses in April \u2014 down 7.9% from March. Polygon (MATIC) and Arbitrum (ARB) both saw the number of active addresses climb last month. Polygon had 4.2 million and Arbitrum had 2.4 million active wallets last month \u2014 up 6% and 7.8% from March, respectively.\n\nBut it was Avalanche (AVAX), Celo, and Optimism that recorded the biggest growths in active addresses last month, according to Nansen data.

Users on the Polyhedra Network \u2014 which provides Web 3.0 infrastructure \u2014 increased phenomenally by over 4,000,000% in April.\n\nMeanwhile, blockchain interoperability provider LayerZero Labs, and Stargate saw their number of users jump by 471% and 375%, respectively.\n\nOn Solana, Nansen data shows new users are flocking to the decentralized exchange Orca, lifestyle app STEPN \u2014 which pays users to exercise \u2014 the automated market maker and liquidity provider Raydium protocol, and liquidity aggregator Jupiter Exchange.\n\nWith the recent success of Pepe meme coins, it\u2019s unsurprising that the token\u2019s users increased by over 213,000% in April, giving Ethereum a boost.\n\nOn Polygon, stablecoins Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC) continue to play a huge role while Stargate and Galxe are pulling crowds.\n\nLastly, in Arbitrum, users of the non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace OpenSea grew by 619% last month. Decentralized exchange (DEX) Arbswap\u2019s users grew by 608% and DEX aggregator Odos protocol saw its users increase by 516% over the last month, according to Nansen data.\n\nMentioned in this article"
