        "content": "The week brought a whirlwind of crypto news, with some coins soaring, others selling, and a few even burning. Dogecoin\u2019s value spiked, Donald Trump made significant moves in the Ethereum and MAGA Coin markets, a Colorado pastor admitted to fraud charges, and Shiba Inu\u2019s burn rate skyrocketed. Here\u2019s a quick look at what transpired.\n\nDogecoin Value Surges on Musk\u2019s X App Buzz\n\nOver the weekend, Dogecoin DOGE/USD value soared by more than 10% following the establishment of a dedicated account for the planned payment feature on Elon Musk\u2019s \u201ceverything app\u201d X. Pseudonymous cryptocurrency analyst Johnny predicts a rally, with DOGE potentially hitting $0.10. The buzz around the X Payments account has fueled speculation that X/Twitter may soon adopt DOGE as its universal payment method. Read the full article here.\n\nTrump Dumps Ethereum\n\nFormer President Donald Trump is reported to have sold more than 1,000 Ethereum ETH/USD, raking in over $2.4 million. The Ethereum mainly came from royalties for Trump\u2019s non-fungible token (NFT) projects. Despite the sale, the NFTs remain in high demand, with the cheapest one listed for over $600, a significant increase from the original $99 price.

This drastic reduction of 15.72 million SHIB tokens from the actively traded supply is attributed to three anonymous entities sending 13 million SHIB tokens to an unrecoverable address.

        "title": "Unibot Boosts Token Value With Solana Ecosystem Draw - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Trading application Unibot will issue a native Solana ecosystem token that accrues value back to holders of the original Ethereum-based UNIBOT tokens, a move that initially met with criticism and caused volatile price action last week.\n\nUnibot expanded to the Solana ecosystem in late December but said last week it would introduce a UNISOL token that accrued revenue in the form of Solana\u2019s SOL tokens. The decision created concerns among long-time UNIBOT holders, who feared dilution as traders would be inclined to choose the newer token in favor of the older one. A sell-off ensued.\n\nBut developers said early Monday that UNISOL could ultimately boost UNIBOT\u2019s value accrual, helping ease some losses from the past few days as traders priced in new information. The Unibot platform connects user wallets to the decentralized exchange Uniswap and lets them punt on tokens just as easily as they would send messages to each other on the popular messaging app by using the messaging application Telegram or a terminal.\n\nUNIBOT slid from over $100 to as low as $48. (DEXTools)\n\n\u201cThe revenue sharing for protocol revenue generated by @UnibotOnSolana is split 50/50 between two pools,\u201d developers posted on X. \u201cPool #1: simply being a holder of $UNIBOT on Ethereum, no strings attached. You'll link your Ethereum address, which holds $UNIBOT to a Solana address that receives revenue in the form of SOL. Pool #2: holders of $UNISOL on Solana.\u201d\n\nUNIBOT holders are set to receive some 80% of the supply of UNISOL through a snapshot and claim mechanism. Since its early January launch, over 20,000 users have generated more than $130m in total volume, developers claimed Monday.\n\n//ANNOUNCEMENT\n\n\n\nWe'd like to clear the confusion around the path forward.\n\n\n\nThe revenue sharing for protocol revenue generated by @UnibotOnSolana is split 50/50 between two pools, described as follows.\n\nPool #1: simply being a holder of $UNIBOT on Ethereum, no strings attached.\u2026 pic.twitter.com/vqEVVhG1FI \u2014 Unibot (@TeamUnibot) January 28, 2024\n\nOn-chain data shows Unibot has garnered 11,700 ether (ETH) in fees since the platform went live in May, paying out a portion of this straight to token holders. Users have also steadily increased, reaching 41,000 on Monday compared to just over 2,000 at the end of last June.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn Sunday alone, the platform generated $74,000 in fees across Solana and Ethereum on $7.5 million in combined volumes.\n\n(Dune)\n\nPer Dune Analytics, Unibot's average daily volumes are just above $5.5 million, a long way from the $900 million daily on the market-leading DEX Uniswap.\n\nUNIBOT prices are up 21% in the past 24 hours, DEXTools data shows."

Similarly, S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures saw decreases of 0.2% and 0.3%, respectively.\n\nIn the previous trading week, all three major averages recorded gains following positive economic data. The fourth-quarter economic growth surpassed expectations, while the core inflation rate on a yearly basis was lower than anticipated, indicating a potential slowdown in price increases.
