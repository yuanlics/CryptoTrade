        "content": "Ethereum price is slowly moving lower toward the $1,585 support against the US dollar. ETH must clear the $1,650 resistance to start a recovery wave.\n\nEthereum is struggling to stay above the $1,600 support zone.\n\nThe price is trading below $1,650 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere is a major bearish trend line forming with resistance near $1,645 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair could start a fresh increase if it clears the $1,650 and $1,665 resistance levels.\n\nEthereum Price Grinds Lower\n\nEthereum attempted a recovery wave from the $1,630 zone. ETH climbed above the $1,650 resistance level but upsides were limited, like Bitcoin.\n\nThe price struggled to gain pace for a move above the $1,665 resistance level. A high was formed near $1,654 and the price reacted to the downside. It declined below the $1,620 support and even traded close to the $1,600 level. A low is formed near $1,607 and the price is now consolidating losses.\n\nEthereum is now trading below $1,650 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is also a major bearish trend line forming with resistance near $1,645 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.\n\nOn the upside, the price might face resistance near the $1,630 level. It is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $1,654 swing high to the $1,607 low. The next major resistance is $1,650, the trend line, and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThe trend line is close to the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $1,654 swing high to the $1,607 low. A close above the $1,650 resistance might send the price toward the key resistance at $1,665.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nTo start a steady increase, Ether must settle above the $1,650 and $1,665 levels. The next key resistance might be $1,720. Any more gains might open the doors for a move toward $1,750.\n\nMore Losses in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $1,650 resistance, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,610 level. The next key support is $1,600.\n\nThe first major support is now near $1,585. A downside break below the $1,585 support might start another strong decline. In the stated case, the price could decline toward the $1,540 level. Any more losses may perhaps send Ether toward the $1,500 level.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bearish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $1,585\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $1,665\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.
