        "content": "ETH was down by more than 5% in the last seven days.\n\nAs its volume dropped, market indicators continued to look bearish on the king of altcoins.\n\nOver the last week, the price of Ethereum [ETH] tanked. However, whales took the opportunity to accumulate more ETH. Does this indicate a market bottom, which could allow ETH to act differently in the coming weeks?\n\nEthereum: Whales are on the move\n\nCoinMarketCap\u2019s data revealed that Ethereum\u2019s price dropped by more than 5% in the last seven days alone. At the time of writing, ETH was trading at $2,214.39 with a market capitalization of over $266 billion.\n\nIts trading volume also dropped sharply, meaning that investors were not actively trading the token.\n\nInasmuch, Ali, a popular crypto influencer, highlighted how whales behaved during this period. He noted that a few ETH whales accumulated 100,000 ETH in the last week, worth more than $230 million at the time of the tweet below.\n\nSome of the largest #Ethereum whales have been on a buying spree, scooping up over 100,000 $ETH in just the past week \u2013 that's a whopping $230 million! pic.twitter.com/jWHY6MXDgs \u2014 Ali (@ali_charts) December 16, 2023\n\nAMBCrypto then took a look at Santiment\u2019s data and found that whale activity around the token indeed increased. The fact that they were buying was proven by the supply held by top addresses, which rose at press time.\n\nInterestingly, ETH\u2019s Supply outside of the Exchanges flipped ETH\u2019s Supply on Exchanges. This suggested that buying pressure was slightly high as well.\n\nIs this a market bottom?\n\nThough buying pressure was high, it might not yet be the market bottom. AMBCrypto\u2019s analysis of CryptoQyant\u2019s data revealed both its Relative Strength Index (RSI) and stochastic were in neutral positions at press time.\n\nSo, we took a look at Ethereum\u2019s liquidation heatmap to see whether the token was near any support level. Our analysis found that the token\u2019s liquidation increased near the $2,140\u2013$2,170 mark.\n\nHence, it seems likely that ETH\u2019s price might plummet to these levels before it starts its next bull rally. If it does start a rally, then it has to test another key resistance level near the $2,380 mark.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nThe possibility of a further downtrend in the near term was high, as the token\u2019s MACD displayed a bearish crossover. Its Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) also took a sideways path.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Money Flow Index (MFI) also registered a downtick and was resting near the neutral mark at press time, suggesting a price drop."

        "content": "New data reveals that a deep-pocketed Ethereum (ETH) investor has woken up from a year of dormancy and is selling off its crypto assets as the top altcoin loses momentum.\n\nAccording to blockchain data tracker Lookonchain, the crypto whale has woken up from a 12-month slumber and is selling its stash of ETH over decentralized exchange platforms (DEX).\n\n\u201cA whale that has been dormant for one year is dumping ETH on DEX! So far, 18,865 ETH has been sold for four million DAI through four new wallets, the average selling price is $2,229. And currently has 5,588 ETH ($12.5 million) left.\u201d\n\nEthereum is trading for $2,214 at time of writing, down about 6% from its 2023 high of $2,359.\n\nLookonchain then brings its attention toward the amount of decentralized oracle provider Chainlink (LINK) deposited into Binance, the top crypto exchange platform by volume. According to the data, noncirculating supply wallets deposited 8.3 million LINK, worth $119 million at time of writing, into Binance.\n\n\u201cThe wallets [have] deposited LINK to Binance every three months since Aug 26, 2022.\n\nInterestingly, most of the time, the deposit is at the bottom of the price and the price rises after that.\u201d\n\nChainlink is trading for $14.08 at time of writing.\n\nConcluding its analysis with Solana-based (SOL) memecoin Bonk (BONK), Lookonchain says that while one savvy trader lost $46,000 on November 1st, on December 15th, the same entity made a staggering $4.4 million from trading the dog-themed meme asset.\n\n\u201cThis trader owns two wallets. In the past year, the trader withdrew 334.5 billion BONK ($218,000) [from crypto exchange] MEXC and bought 32.18 billion BONK ($41,000) from DEX.\n\nAnd deposited 204.2 billion BONK ($80,000) to MEXC, leaving 172.5 billion BONK (worth $132,000 on Nov 1st). On Nov 1st, he still lost $46,000, but today he made $4.4 million.\u201d\n\nBONK is trading for $0.0000205 at time of writing.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "TL;DR\n\nETH\u2019s Recent Gains and Positive Outlook: Ethereum\u2019s ETH has rebounded in 2023, reaching around $2,400, with some analysts forecasting a rise to $5,000 by 2025 due to a bullish trend.\n\nEthereum\u2019s ETH has rebounded in 2023, reaching around $2,400, with some analysts forecasting a rise to $5,000 by 2025 due to a bullish trend. High Expectations and Upgrades: Experts predict ETH could reach up to $8,000 by 2026, bolstered by upcoming Ethereum upgrades, with short-term predictions around $3,400-$3,800.\n\nExperts predict ETH could reach up to $8,000 by 2026, bolstered by upcoming Ethereum upgrades, with short-term predictions around $3,400-$3,800. Some Bearish Perspectives: Despite optimism, some, like trader Peter Brandt, are skeptical about Ethereum\u2019s long-term prospects, questioning its functionality and future as a listed asset.\n\nCan Ethereum Be the Best Performer Next Year?\n\nThroughout 2023, the native cryptocurrency of Ethereum \u2013 Ether (ETH) \u2013 managed to recover most of the losses incurred during the devastating 2022, reaching almost $2,400 (per CoinGecko\u2019s data) a few days ago. However, that valuation is still at the foothills of the all-time high of over $4,800 registered in November 2021.\n\nSome analysts believe the recent uptrend could continue next year, with ETH rising to a new peak in the following months. According to FieryTrading, the asset has been in a bullish mode for the past year and a half, suggesting a further surge in the near future:\n\n\u201cAs seen on the chart, ETH has been trading inside a bullish triangle pattern for over 1.5 years. In my eyes, a break out from this pattern might result in big gains for ETH since it will burst through an area full of short-trade stop-losses, which will be forced to buy back their positions.\u201d\n\nThe analyst predicted that Ether could jump to the coveted level of $5,000 by the end of 2024 or the beginning of 2025.\n\nNikolaos Panigirtzoglou \u2013 Managing Director at JPMorgan \u2013 also gave his two cents, highlighting Ethereum\u2019s upcoming \u201cProtodanksharding\u201d (EIP-4844) upgrade. He claimed it could help the ecosystem thrive and push ETH\u2019s price toward $8,000 by 2026, while Ethereum could outperform Bitcoin in 2024.\n\nThe popular X (Twitter) user Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe is another person who forecasted success for ETH next year. In his view, the asset might correct to approximately $1,900 but remains poised to soar to $3,400-$3,800 by the first quarter of 2024.\n\nOne Bearish Outlook\n\nIt is worth noting that some prominent figures are not so bullish on Ethereum. One example is the renowned trader Peter Brandt, who maintained that the token is \u201cnot comparable to BTC as a store of value.\u201d\n\nHe also spoke against the functionality of Ethereum and its gas prices, forecasting that it could \u201cnot even be a listed asset in 10 years.\u201d"

        "content": "Disclaimer: The information presented does not constitute financial, investment, trading, or other types of advice and is solely the writer\u2019s opinion.\n\nEthereum has been on a positive uptrend since last year\u2019s Merge event. In fact, the altcoin was trading at $2,287.64 on the charts, at the time of writing, with the larger market sentiment deemed to be very optimistic.\n\nThe \u201cMerge\u201d and its consequences\n\nEthereum\u2019s \u201cMerge\u201d event on 15 September 2023 was intended as a shift for the blockchain from the Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism to the Proof-of-Stake (PoS). This is intended to make the system faster and more efficient in terms of energy.\n\nThe event which marked the movement of the Mainnet layer with the PoS consensus Beacon layer has been a game-changer in terms of cutting down on energy-intensive mining and has also enabled the network to be secured via staked ETH.\n\nSince Ethereum is the second-largest blockchain network, this shift was complex and a multi-step process. Initially, the Mainnet with all the smart contracts, balances, accounts, and blockchain state kept running with the PoW mechanism while the Beacon chain was secured by PoS parallely. Later on the \u201cMerge\u201d occurred when the two systems came together and Proof-of-Work was permanently replaced by Proof-of-Stake. Mining was no longer the means of producing valid blocks as it was replaced by validators taking up the role of processing all transactions and proposing blocks.\n\nBuilding an eco-friendly alt\n\nVitalik Buterin, Ethereum\u2019s co-founder, has been an advocate of the PoS mechanism for a long time now. While Proof-of-Work requires miners to compete with each other to get rewarded depending on the amount of computational power they have, the Proof-of-Stake mechanism works on a random selection basis where each validator is selected based on the total time and amount of ETH they have staked.\n\nIn PoS, mining is not required at all in the maintenance of the network. Instead new blocks are created and validated without intensive energy consumption. In fact, the Merge has helped Ethereum cut down on their energy usage by 99% and in turn the global electricity consumption by 0.2%.\n\nThe Merge was the first step in an otherwise 5-step process put forward by Buterin. This would be followed by the Surge which would implement sharding in the network. Sharding can be defined as the process of separating a database horizontally in order to spread the network\u2019s workload. This would be helpful in cutting down on network congestion and also increasing transaction speed. Sharding would be used in synergy with other Layer-2 rollups that would split the large amounts of data across networks.\n\nVerge, Purge, and Splurge\n\nOnce the \u201cSurge\u201d step is completed, next on the roadmap would be optimizing data storage and node size using Verkle trees. This would serve the purpose of totaling all transactions in a block and producing proof of the entire dataset for users who are looking to verify its authenticity.\n\n\u201cPurge\u201d would follow this, wherein spare historical data would be removed to alleviate network congestion issues and purge the superfluous data. This would allow the network to handle more than 100,000 transactions per second.\n\nFinally, \u201cSplurge\u201d can be defined as a series of small updates that are aimed at ensuring the overall network runs smoothly. In the words of Buterin, this phase would be the \u201cenjoyable stuff once all of the preceding phases have merged.\u201d Improvement proposals that couldn\u2019t fit in other upgrades would be used to add the final touches to the blockchain improvement program.\n\nETH\u2019s price movements\n\nETH was trading at $2,287, at press time, following a hike of 1.96% over the past week of trading. Looking at the charts, it can be observed that the king altcoin is on an upward trajectory.\n\nThe \u201cMerge\u201d event and its subsequent deflationary implications have helped the coin get a more positive response from traders. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) flashed a reading of 67 above the 50-mark, showing a positive turn in the market. Similarly, the Awesome Oscillator shared a positive reading above the 0-levels \u2013 A bullish signal\n\nChatGPT\u2019s ETH prediction for 2024\n\nTo know how the price of ETH would move in the next year given its history and recent \u201cMerge\u201d event, I asked ChatGPT about the future. Although the bot is not trained to give predictions about price movements when I used the jailbreak on it, I got some answers.\n\nChatGPT gave a detailed answer when asked if the \u201cmerge\u201d event would affect the price of ETH and the market sentiment. In the classic version, it mentioned that the recent \u201cmerge\u201d is a milestone in the transition to a PoS mechanism, and taking into account historical data major network updates have varied effects on both the prices and the sentiment.\n\nIn the jailbreak version, the bot was more upbeat in its response, stating that it could be like a shot of adrenaline and the price would explode with the market sentiment going through the roof.\n\nWhen I asked ChatGPT what the price movement of ETH will be after the \u201cMerge\u201d event, it confidently stated that ETH will be on fire and break all its previous records. It could go up to $10,000 or even more, it added.\n\nThe road after the merge\n\nEthereum\u2019s shift has been quite seamless, but this is just the first step in a 5-step program. Although the entire process will be a gradual shift rather than a sudden jump, the end goal of Ethereum\u2019s roadmap is to make the network capable of high block frequency and block size and the ability to process thousands of transactions per second easily while also remaining censorship-resistant and trustless.\n\nEthereum has seen a deflationary shift ever since the Merge event due to the burning of more than 1,195,238 ETH. This is set to have a more positive impact on the asset\u2019s value in the long term as a decrease in supply has implications for its scarcity.\n\nWhether ChatGPT\u2019s predictions stand the test of time or not is something we will find out in the next year. Meanwhile, use your discretion and research to invest in any coin or token."
