        "content": "Ethereum has been consolidating within a narrow price range, tightly bound by the upper limit of the descending flag pattern and the 100-day moving average. However, a breakout is imminent and will determine the subsequent direction of the cryptocurrency.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nThe Daily Chart\n\nExamining the daily chart, Ethereum demonstrated a period of stable price action around the $1790 mark, near the 100-day moving average, before gaining support and embarking on an upward trajectory.\n\nDespite an unsuccessful attempt to breach the flag\u2019s upper boundary at $1.9K, resulting in a minor correction, Ethereum\u2019s price remains confined within a limited range, approximately between the $1791 level of the 100-day moving average and the dynamic resistance offered by the flag\u2019s upper trendline. A breakout from the flag pattern is likely to initiate another rally toward the $2K resistance zone.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart\n\nTaking a closer look at the 4-hour chart, three significant price regions present challenges for Ethereum buyers and sellers: the static resistance at $2K, the dynamic resistance from the mid-trendline of the ascending channel, and the dynamic support provided by the channel\u2019s lower threshold.\n\nConsidering the ongoing price action, it might seem more likely that Ethereum will continue its upward trend, aiming to surpass the $2K resistance level. However, given the current market conditions and prevailing uncertainty among market participants, it is more probable that a consolidation phase will occur first between the $2K region and the lower boundary of the channel."

        "title": "Will Ethereum Flip Bitcoin? We Put ChatGPT and Google\u2019s Bard Against Each Other - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "Naturally, the question of whether Ethereum will overtake Bitcoin by total market cap is very interesting to crypto investors.\n\nAnd there are some pretty strong arguments to be made on both sides, which is why we decided to engage with unbiased AI chatbots.\n\nWill Ethereum Bitcoin Flippening Happen?\n\nBitcoin maxis believe BTC will be the world\u2019s most common reserve currency for international trade. In that scenario, Ethereum would have to be some kind of global computer with incredible levels of user adoption. Only if it achieves world-class network activity on its platform would it stand a chance in such a future.\n\nBut the flippening of Bitcoin by Ethereum is no idle question. The second largest cryptocurrency by market cap, at its peak levels of market dominance, has comprised as much as 25% of the value of all traded cryptos. That was in 2017. For the past couple of years, the percentage has ranged in the mid to high teens.\n\nEarlier this month, we asked OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT if Ethereum can flip Bitcoin in five years. The short version of ChatGPT\u2019s answer? Such an outcome is \u201cuncertain and depends on various factors.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s what Google AI\u2019s Bard chatbot had to say in answer to the same question we put to ChatGPT:\n\n\u201cDo you think Ethereum\u2019s price can flip Bitcoin\u2019s price in the next 5 years?\u201d\n\nThe short version of Bard\u2019s answer?\n\n\u201cIt is possible\u2026\u201d\n\nGoogle Bard vs. ChatGPT Showdown:\n\nBard said:\n\n\u201cUltimately, the question of whether Ethereum will flip Bitcoin will depend on a number of factors, including the continued adoption of Ethereum, the success of Ethereum\u2019s planned upgrades, and the overall performance of the cryptocurrency market.\u201d\n\nAdoption rates are the key metrics here that push the cryptocurrencies\u2019 values up or down in the market. Bard agreed with ChatGPT on that:\n\n\u201cEthereum has a broader range of use cases than Bitcoin, including decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and smart contracts. As these use cases continue to grow in popularity, it could lead to increased demand for Ethereum and a higher price.\u201d\n\nGoogle Bard was sure to qualify that although possible, the ETH flippening may not happen:\n\n\u201cOverall, it is possible that Ethereum could flip Bitcoin in the next 5 years. However, there are a number of factors that could prevent this from happening.\u201d\n\nBard said some of those factors include Bitcoin\u2019s first-mover advantage, its \u201cgreater security,\u201d and the overall performance of the cryptocurrency market."

        "content": "Generative artificial intelligence (AI) systems are steadily gaining popularity, with the advent of ChatGPT leading the way. The AI landscape now welcomes Google\u2019s Bard, the latest addition to this domain.\n\nAlthough still in its experimental phase, Bard showcases impressive language processing capabilities, which have found practical applications in cryptocurrencies. The tool\u2019s unique potential lies in its ability to generate feasible price projections for various digital assets, including Ethereum (ETH).\n\nGiven this context, Finbold utilized Bard on June 1, seeking its predictive insights on Ethereum\u2019s potential price trajectory by the end of 2023.\n\nBard noted there are a number of factors that could influence the price, including the continued growth of the decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible token (NFT) markets, the adoption of the network by mainstream businesses and institutions, as well as any major changes to the Ethereum protocol, all in all, it said if these factors are positive \u201cETH could reach $2,500 or even higher by the end of the year.\u201d\n\nETH end of 2023 price predictions. Source: Google Bard\n\nEthereum price predictions\n\nIn addition, Bard also provided insights into notable price predictions for the end of 2023 from reputable institutions and platforms.\n\nAmong these forecasts, Gov Capital, a financial research firm that uses a combination of technical analysis and fundamental analysis to make cryptocurrency price predictions, projects that Ethereum will reach a price of $2,587 by the end of 2023.\n\nOn the other hand, DigitalCoinPrice offered an average price target of $2,878, while PricePrediction using its own artificial intelligence, suggests Ethereum will reach a maximum price of $3,000 and a minimum price of $1,808 in 2023.\n\nETH end of 2023 price predictions. Source: Google Bard\n\n\n\nETH price analysis\n\nEthereum is trading at $1,861, showing a minor decrease of 0.36% in the past 24 hours. However, it has experienced a positive trend over the last seven days, with a gain of 3.40%.\n\nETH 24-hour price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nThe recent slight decline in price within the last 24 hours could be attributed to various factors, such as investors securing profits or a general downturn in the cryptocurrency market. Nevertheless, the overall trajectory over the past week remains optimistic, indicating sustained bullish sentiment among Ethereum investors.\n\nKey price levels to observe include the support level at $1,784, which corresponds to the 50-day moving average. A drop below this level may suggest a more significant price decline. On the other hand, the resistance level at $1,941 represents the 200-day moving average. A breakthrough above this level could indicate a notable price increase.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice. Investing is speculative.

        "title": "Ethereum Miner Dumped ETH After Merge in Favor of Dogecoin - Blockworks",
        "content": "Crypto miner BIT Mining (BTCM) once made most of its self-mining revenue from Ethereum. After the Merge, it\u2019s increasingly relying on Dogecoin and Litecoin for fresh cash.\n\nThe miner, based in Ohio and listed on the New York Stock Exchange, reported revenue of $72.9 million for last quarter \u2014 a near-20% jump from the previous period but down 75% year on year.\n\nBIT Mining\u2019s revenue comes from three primary business areas: mining crypto itself, mining as part of a pool and hosting services in its datacenters.\n\nThe firm\u2019s mining pool revenue came in at $60 million last quarter, making up 82% of its total inflows, while self-mining and datacenters each brought in about $6 million.\n\nAs noted by analyst Mike Fay (via Seeking Alpha), Ethereum mining contributed more than three-quarters of BIT\u2019s self-mining revenue leading up to the Merge last September.\n\nThe event transitioned Ethereum away from energy-intensive proof of work to proof of stake, eliminating the need for crypto miners as part of consensus.\n\nBIT Mining\u2019s self-mining revenue predictably nosedived after the switch, dropping from $7.1 million in Q3 2022 to $1.9 million in the following period.\n\nThe firm mined $6.2 million crypto in the first quarter of 2023 \u2014 most of it litecoin (LTC) and dogecoin (DOGE) after shutting down certain bitcoin mining rigs.\n\nDogecoin and Litecoin hashrates skyrocketed to all-time highs directly around the Merge, although their hashing algorithms differ from Ethereum\u2019s. Crypto miners are able to direct their rigs at Dogecoin and Litecoin simultaneously through what\u2019s known as \u201cmerge-mining.\u201d\n\nBTCM has drastically underperformed the crypto market, as well as major miners Riot and Marathon\n\nBIT Mining sold ETH over staking it\n\nFay found one move particularly confounding: BIT Mining sold one-third of its ETH holdings between quarters, amounting to 1,602 ETH ($3 million at current prices).\n\nOn the other hand, the firm held 62% more dogecoin quarter on quarter, going from 42.8 million DOGE ($3.1 million) to 69.5 million DOGE ($5 million). Its bitcoin holdings (289 BTC worth $7.8 million) remained unchanged.\n\nThat means BIT Mining\u2019s crypto balance sheet was almost 28% DOGE at the end of Q1 2023. Its total assets were $40.2 million with $39 million liabilities, including lease obligations.\n\n\u201cThe company\u2019s crypto treasury management decisions are odd from where I sit,\u201d Fay wrote in his report. \u201cWhile I\u2019ve made it no secret that I think assets like Dogecoin don\u2019t have much of a future, in my view the more egregious decision is selling the ETH on the balance sheet when the company could be generating rewards by staking it natively on-chain.\u201d\n\nFay continued: \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to understand why management would opt instead for holding meme coins rather than selling all DOGE production and staking Ethereum at virtually no cost. BTCM is still an avoid for me.\u201d Blockworks has reached out to BIT Mining for comment.\n\nThanks to rising ETH prices this year, BIT Mining\u2019s ether stash is worth practically the same\n\nIn any case, BIT Mining has reportedly only managed to generate a positive net income for one quarter between 2016 and 2022 while increasingly diluting its shares as of 2021.\n\nBIT Mining, which commands a $31 million market cap, is up 85% across 2023 so far but down the same amount over the past year.\n\nDavid Canellis contributed reporting.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."
