        "content": "Blockchain analytics firm Nansen reported that wallets connected to bankrupt FTX have moved up to $156 million worth of digital assets, including Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL), in several transactions over the past week.\n\nUnstakes Solana\n\nIn an Oct. 31 post on X (formerly Twitter), Nansen reported that FTX began unstaking 1.6 mill SOL tokens, worth approximately $57.6 million, on Oct. 30.\n\nWhile the unstaked assets are currently held in the staking wallet, FTX\u2019s fund movement will increase the total SOL transferred to nearly $90 million.\n\nEarlier in the month, FTX liquidators staked approximately $120 million in Solana tokens through Figment, an institutional staking service provider. This move is anticipated to yield up to 7% return in staking rewards and is expected to help the bankrupt firm maximize its assets.\n\n$156M transferred\n\nNansen, while adding FTX\u2019s recently unstaked Solana assets to the stream of transactions from the insolvent company to crypto exchanges like Binance and Coinbase, estimated a movement of approximately $156 million worth of digital assets.\n\nAccording to Nansen\u2019s analysis, the new wave of transactions included 1,100 ETH valued at $2 million, 10.5 million USDC, and 7.6 million Render tokens worth $500,000.\n\nFTX also transferred 833,000 Kyber Network Crystal (KNC) tokens, equivalent to $616,000, and 108 million TRUE tokens worth $420,000. Further assets included 138,000 Band Protocol tokens valued at $221,000, 2.5 million The Graph tokens equivalent to $273,000, 845 Maker tokens valued at $1.17 million, and 9.5 million REN tokens worth $500,000.\n\nAdditionally, there were 695,000 Perpetual Protocol Tokens valued at $423,000, 767,000 Biconomy Tokens worth $182,000, and 23,000 Polygon tokens worth $15,000.\n\nFTX claims value rise\n\nPrices for FTX claims increased following reports of a $2 billion investment by Google in the artificial intelligence startup Anthropic.\n\nIkigai hedge fund manager Travis Kling posited that the investment had driven \u201cFTX bankruptcy pretty close to a full recovery.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with CryptoSlate, Thomas Braziel, an expert on FTX claims at 117 Partners, urged creditors to remain cautious. This was reiterated in a post on X (formerly Twitter), where he highlighted that there was no valuation mentioned in the Google-Anthropic investment, adding that:\n\n\u201cGreat to see this news tonight but the bankruptcy still have a big road ahead of it.\u201d\n\nData from Cherokee Acquisition shows that the claim\u2019s value has risen to between 50 and 53 cents on the dollar as of press time."

        "content": "Unveiling of L1 token DYDX, a pivotal step in dYdX Chain\u2019s growth.\n\nEnhanced network security and governance with the new L1 token.\n\nOpportunities for community engagement and revenue generation through staking.\n\nWhile Ethereum provides a reliable platform for thousands of blockchain projects, many eventually move to their native tokens. Most recently, the dYdX Chain has marked a significant milestone by launching a native chain and moving to an L1 token, DYDX.\n\nThe project departed from its previous ERC-20 token framework on Ethereum\u2019s layer two protocol. The project says the migration means better network governance, heightened security, and functionality, and a new revenue distribution model for validators and stakers.\n\ndYdX Chain\u2019s Transition to L1 Token, DYDX\n\nOn Wednesday, October 26, the dYdX Chain mainnet finally went live after the unveiling of its new L1 token. The first block was created by the Genesis Validators, as announced by the Operations subDAO (Ops subDAO). The move is a significant paradigm shift from its previous reliance on an ERC-20 token on Ethereum\u2019s layer two protocol.\n\nThis transition, following a community vote, expands the staking opportunities, which aims to bolster the blockchain. Moreover, the project claims that the shift amplifies the protocol\u2019s governance capabilities and reallocates the protocol\u2019s revenue streams.\n\nThrough this transition, the dYdX Chain says its framework will be more closely with the decentralized ethos of blockchain technology. The L1 token also marks a step towards a self-sustained, community-driven blockchain ecosystem. Importantly, all fees collected by the protocol, which include trading fees denominated in USDC and gas fees for DYDX-denominated transactions or USDC-denominated transactions, are distributed to Validators and Stakers, creating a direct financial benefit for network participants.\n\nWhat Is dYdX?\n\nAt its core, dYdX is a leading decentralized exchange supporting perpetual trading. It operates on smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain, allowing users to trade without intermediaries.\n\nThe project\u2019s features include perpetual trading on Layer-2 with up to 20x leverage, offering pairs like BTC-USD, ETH-USD, and LINK-USD, among others\u200b2\u200b. This aspect of dYdX demonstrates its commitment to providing advanced financial services in a decentralized manner.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nEthereum, where dYdX initially operated, is one of the most decentralized networks in the blockchain space.\n\ndYdX Chain might face an uphill battle to prove its chain is more decentralized than Ethereum.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nThe emergence of dYdX Chain and its L1 Token, dYDx, is a significant stride towards achieving a self-sustainable and community-governed blockchain ecosystem. It showcases the potential for blockchain projects to evolve and adapt to community needs while enhancing network security and governance.\n\nRead more about decentralized exchanges like dYdX:\n\nDecentralized Exchanges: Crypto\u2019s Wild West or Blockchain Essential?\n\n\n\nRead more about Solana\u2019s positive performance:\n\nUnpacking Solana\u2019s 7% Price Jump: What You Need to Know"

        "content": "On-chain data shows the Ethereum Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio has entered inside a danger zone that has historically led to tops.\n\nEthereum MVRV Ratio Has Surged Into The Danger Zone Recently\n\nIn its latest insight post, the on-chain analytics firm Santiment has talked about some underlying metrics related to ETH. First, the firm has pointed out how the trading volume of the cryptocurrency has gone down since Ethereum\u2019s surge from a few days back.\n\nThe value of the metric has been sharply going down recently | Source: Santiment\n\nThe trading volume observing a significant decline while the price is trying to continue its rally could indicate that momentum is weakening for the cryptocurrency.\n\nOne positive for the asset, though, could be the fact that the supply on exchanges has gone down since the rally started, implying that the investors have made net withdrawals.\n\nLooks like the metric has plunged | Source: Santiment\n\nGenerally, investors transfer their Ethereum out of these central entities to hold onto it in self-custodial wallets for extended periods, so this decline in the supply on exchanges could be a sign of fresh accumulation.\n\nFollowing the latest rise in the asset, its social dominance has also seen a jump. The \u201csocial dominance\u201d here refers to the mindshare that Ethereum occupies on social media platforms among the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market cap.\n\nInterest around ETH has grown in the last few days | Source: Santiment\n\nIt would appear that more eyes have been turning at Ethereum recently, which can be a sign that hype is building up among the traders. Historically, too much hype has been negative for the asset, as it has often led to top formations.\n\nSo far, though, the social dominance is still notably below the levels it was at when ETH hit its local top at the start of this month, as is apparent in the above chart. According to Santiment, this \u201cmay suggest there can be some room for it to go before things cool down.\u201d\n\nA signal that is more concretely bearish for Ethereum, however, is the 30-day MVRV ratio. In simple terms, what this ratio tells us is how the value that investors are holding (the market cap) compares against the capital that they invested into the asset (the realized cap).\n\nThe indicator appears to have entered the danger zone | Source: Santiment\n\nHere, Santiment has used the 30-day MVRV ratio, which means this indicator only keeps track of the investors/addresses who bought their coins within the last 30 days.\n\nAs shown in the chart, this Ethereum indicator has recently risen into a territory that the analytics firm labels as a \u201cdanger zone.\u201d Historically, the price has seen a correction not too long after the metric has reached this zone so another local top may be due for Ethereum right now.\n\nETH Price\n\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at around $1,800, up 1% in the past week.\n\nETH has been stuck in consolidation recently | Source: ETHUSD on TradingView\n\nFeatured image from Kanchanara on Unsplash.com, charts from TradingView.com, Santiment.net\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "Ethereum DeFi Activities On A Roll: Will It Drive A Bullish Price Surge? - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Ethereum, often hailed as the pioneer of smart contracts, has cemented its position as the frontrunner in the world of decentralized finance (DeFi) and blockchain technology.\n\nRecent data reveals that Ethereum was the primary catalyst behind the surge in crypto Total Value Locked (TVL), amassing an impressive 75% of all deposited funds during the past week.\n\nEthereum\u2019s journey began with the groundbreaking innovation of smart contracts. It was the first protocol to introduce this game-changing technology, enabling the creation of self-executing contracts with predefined rules and conditions.\n\nThis innovation laid the foundation for the entire DeFi ecosystem, as it provided the framework for decentralized applications and automated transactions.\n\nOne of the most compelling indicators of Ethereum\u2019s continued dominance is the recent surge in decentralized exchange (DEX) volumes.\n\nIn the past week, Ethereum recorded a historic milestone, with over $9 billion in transactions settled on its network. This marks the highest weekly volume since mid-June and underscores the platform\u2019s pivotal role in facilitating peer-to-peer trading and liquidity provision.\n\n.@ethereum dominated this week\u2019s TVL growth rankings, accounting for $6.68B of the total $8.76B TVL growth across crypto last week. pic.twitter.com/45rqb3Seml \u2014 0xScope (\ud83e\udeac . \ud83e\udeac) (@ScopeProtocol) October 30, 2023\n\nETH Price Dynamics And The BlackRock Factor\n\nAs Ethereum continues to take center stage in the crypto landscape, the question on many investors\u2019 minds is how this data will impact the price of ETH. Currently, according to CoinGecko, Ethereum is trading at $1,798, showing a modest 0.6% increase in the last 24 hours, with a minor 0.9% decrease over the past seven days.\n\nVenture capitalist Arthur Cheong has provided intriguing insights into the potential price trajectory of Ethereum. Cheong, the founder of DeFiance Capital, suggests that ETH could experience a significant rally if a specific scenario unfolds.\n\nHe points to BlackRock, a financial giant, and its application for a spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF). If BlackRock\u2019s BTC ETF application is successful, it could pave the way for a similar Ethereum ETF application in the future.\n\n\u201cETH is probably the best six to 12 month long among large-cap assets now when BlackRock applies for a spot ETH ETF six to 12 months down the road,\u201d Cheong wrote on the social media platform X.\n\nETH is probably the best 6 to 12m long among large cap assets now when BlackRock applies for spot ETH ETF 6 to 12m down the road. Ethereum\u2019s ESG friendliness and native staking yield will be appealing to institutional investors should BTC spot ETF turn out to be a success. \u2014 Arthur (@Arthur_0x) October 24, 2023\n\nETHUSD currently trading at $1798.3 on the daily chart: TradingView.com\n\nImplications And Future Prospects\n\nThe significance of Ethereum\u2019s role in DeFi and blockchain technology cannot be overstated. Its smart contract functionality revolutionized the crypto space and enabled the birth of countless decentralized applications and platforms. The recent surge in DEX volumes underscores its pivotal role in facilitating crypto trading.\n\nAs the crypto world closely watches developments surrounding BlackRock\u2019s potential ETFs, Ethereum\u2019s future appears promising. Should a BTC spot ETF materialize and pave the way for an Ethereum ETF, institutional investors may flock to Ethereum for its ESG attributes and staking yield opportunities.\n\n(This site\u2019s content should not be construed as investment advice.

        "content": "The Ethereum layer-2 ecosystem is likely to continue evolving with diverse technological approaches, according to co-founder Vitalik Buterin.\n\nThe co-founder of the smart contract blockchain unpacked the current landscape of Ethereum\u2019s scaling ecosystem on his personal blog, with several layer-2 protocols differing in their approaches to bring greater scaling capacity, lower costs and increased security.\n\nAs Buterin highlighted, Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) rollups pioneered by Arbitrum, Optimism, Scroll and more recently, Kakarot and Taiko, have drastically improved the respective security of their solutions.\n\nDifferent types of layer 2shttps://t.co/ry4VTtWhJ1 \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) October 31, 2023\n\nMeanwhile, \u201csidechain projects\u201d like Polygon have also developed their own rollup solutions. Buterin also highlights \u201calmost-EVMs\u201d like zkSync, extensions like Arbitrum Stylus and zero-knowledge proof pioneers Starknet as important players driving scaling technology for the ecosystem:\n\n\u201cOne of the inevitable consequences of this is that we are seeing a trend of layer 2 projects becoming more heterogeneous. I expect this trend to continue, for a few key reasons.\u201d\n\nButerin notes that some projects currently existing as independent layer 1s are looking to bring themselves closer to the Ethereum ecosystem and potentially become ecosystem layer 2s.\n\nRelated: Polygon\u2019s \u2018holy grail\u2019 Ethereum-scaling zkEVM beta hits mainnet\n\nThis type of transition remains difficult, as an \u201call at once\u201d approach would cause a decrease in usability given that technology is not at a stage where it can be completely included in rollup technology. Meanwhile, postponing such a transition runs the risk of \u201csacrificing momentum and being too late to be meaningful.\u201d\n\nButerin also notes that some centralized, non-Ethereum projects want to give users greater security assurances and are looking to blockchain-based solutions. Historically, these types of projects would have looked to \u201cpermissioned consortium chains\u201d to achieve this:\n\n\u201cRealistically, they probably only need a \u201chalfway-house\u201d level of decentralization. Additionally, their often very high level of throughput makes them unsuitable even for rollups, at least in the short term.\u201d\n\nLastly, Buterin considers non-financial applications like games and social media platforms that want to be decentralized but do not need high levels of security. Highlighting a social media use case, Buterin notes that different parts of the app would require separate functionality:\n\n\u201cRare and high-value activity like username registration and account recovery should be done on a rollup, but frequent and low-value activity like posts and votes need less security.\u201c\n\nHe adds that a chain failure leading to a user\u2019s post disappearing would be an \u201cacceptable cost,\u201d while a similar failure leading to the loss of an account would be far more serious.\n\nRelated: Vitalik Buterin voices concerns over DAOs approving ETH staking pool operators\n\nButerin also notes that the costs associated with paying for rollup fees might not be acceptable for non-blockchain users, while previous blockchain users are used to paying far higher prices for on-chain interactions.\n\nAn excerpt from Buterin\u2019s latest blog post on the Ethereum ecosystem titled \u201cDifferent types of layer 2s.\u201d Source: vitalik.eth.limo\n\nThe Ethereum co-founder then delves into the trade-offs between different rollup solutions and systems that offer varying scaling capabilities to the ecosystem. The \u201cconnectedness\u201d to Ethereum hinges on the security of withdrawing to Ethereum from layer 2s and the security of reading data from the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nRelated: Ethereum\u2019s proto-danksharding to make rollups 10x cheaper \u2014 Consensys zkEVM Linea head\n\nButerin notes that high security and tight connectedness are important for some applications, while others require something looser in exchange for greater scalability:\n\n\u201cIn many cases, starting with something looser today, and moving to a tighter coupling over the next decade as technology improves, may well be optimal.\u201d\n\nEthereum\u2019s next scheduled hard fork is set to introduce EIP-4844, commonly referred to as \u201cproto-dank sharding.\u201d The EIP is expected to drastically increase the amount of data availability of the network. Buterin also notes that improvements in data compression enable greater functionality.\n\nMagazine: Ethereum restaking: Blockchain innovation or dangerous house of cards?"
