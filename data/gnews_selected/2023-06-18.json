        "content": "Etherscan, a popular Ethereum (ETH) block explorer, has announced the addition of ChatGPT to its suite of tools for analyzing the coin\u2019s blockchain.\n\nThe new tool, called Code Reader, utilizes the ChatGPT API to provide users with the ability to retrieve and interpret the source code of a specific contract address. This integration aims to enhance the understanding of Ethereum source code and make the blockchain analysis process more efficient.\n\n\ud83c\udd95 Code Reader (Beta)\n\n\n\nLeverage the power of AI to seamlessly learn about any smart contract source code! \u2728 pic.twitter.com/GTbULisudk \u2014 Etherscan (@etherscan) June 19, 2023\n\nBlockchain explorers allow users to view transactions and other information on a blockchain network. Etherscan is one of the leading block explorers for the Ethereum blockchain, providing valuable insights into the Ethereum ecosystem. With the integration of ChatGPT, Etherscan aims to streamline the process of scanning and analyzing the blockchain, which can often be tedious and time-consuming.\n\nYou might also like: Etherscan introduces advanced filtering tool in beta for blockchain analysis\n\nEtherscan is not the only company leveraging ChatGPT for blockchain exploration. Last week, Alchemy, a prominent blockchain platform developer, launched its ChatGPT-based tool called AlchemyAI, which includes a GPT-4 plugin for blockchain analysis. Additionally, Solana Labs introduced its own ChatGPT plugin in May.\n\nWhile the integration of ChatGPT brings advanced AI capabilities to blockchain analysis, Etherscan emphasizes the tool\u2019s limitations. The company warns users not to rely solely on ChatGPT\u2019s responses and always verify the information independently.\n\nThis caution stems from the well-known issue of AI chatbots generating false or fake information, a phenomenon referred to as hallucinations. OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, has been working on improving the model to prevent hallucinations and ensure the accuracy of generated responses.\n\nEtherscan\u2019s Code Reader tool is currently in beta, and the company encourages user feedback to enhance its functionality further. As the blockchain industry continues to evolve, integrating AI technologies like ChatGPT is expected to facilitate blockchain exploration and analysis significantly.\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nThere is a new protocol that allows users to create and share digital objects on Ethereum. They are called Ethscriptions\u2014an apparent tip of the hat to Inscriptions, a similar project by Ordinals deployed on the Bitcoin network.\n\nDeveloped by Tom Lehman, co-founder and former CEO of Genius.com, the project launched on Saturday and saw explosive interest. Nearly 30,000 Ethscriptions were created in less than 18 hours, according to Lehman, who tweeted that the launch was a \u201chuge success.\u201d\n\nEthscriptions enable non-financial and arbitrary data to be written into the main Ethereum blockchain. Users can inscribe any type of file provided it is under 96 kilobytes in size. According to its creator, however, it currently only allows for images\u2014but that will change in the future.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThese inscriptions leverage what\u2019s known as Ethereum \u201ccalldata,\u201d which refers to the data provided within a call made to a smart contract. According to Lehman, the protocol is cheaper and more decentralized than using contract storage.\n\nThe [protocol] \u201cguarantees global uniqueness of the content of all valid Ethscriptions,\u201d the creator tweeted, saying that \u201cit's skating to where the puck is going in an L2 world.\u201d\n\nLehman, perhaps in a bid for notoriety, called for famed NFT collection Crypto Punks to be \u201cethscribed.\u201d It successfully sparked a frenzy, and copies of the 10,000 images were inscribed in a matter of hours.\n\nThe launch echoes the Ordinals launch on Bitcoin, NFT-style images and other non-financial data included in the main chain\u2019s ledger. The arrival of Ordinals, however, triggered dismay from many in the maximalist community.\n\nThe difference in reception is the Ethereum community\u2019s apparent openness to innovation and experimentation.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe exciting thing for me about Ethscriptions, similar to Ordinals, is that developers are playing around again with blockchain technology,\u201d self-proclaimed NFT archaeologist Adam McBride told Decrypt. \u201cIt\u2019s this experimentation that drives innovation and adoption,\u201d\n\nMuch like the Ordinal craze, this weekend has seen significant interest from new protocol users. This led Ethscriptions to suffer several periods of downtime, with Lehman tweeting, \u201cSorry everything is crashing! Too many people.\u201d\n\nAlthough this weekend brought an impressive debut for the protocol, some say it already existed. McBride says this technology has been around for years, with certain artists already using it in their work.\n\nStill, he told Decrypt \u201cthis is the first time it\u2019s gained widespread awareness.\u201d\n\nWhether Ethscriptions are a fly-by-night fad or an exciting new trend will ultimately be determined by the community."
