        "content": "The Vancouver-based firm reported a net loss of US$90 million, or $1.09 a share, for the quarter ended Dec. 31, compared with profit of US$51.2 million, or 66 cents a share, the year before, it said in a Tuesday release. It had a loss of US$37 million, or 45 cents per share, in the previous three months. The net was mainly attributed to impairment from depreciation of mining rigs and chips due to lower crypto currency prices, the statement said."

        "content": "The cryptocurrency sector has found itself under increased regulatory pressure in the past weeks, but despite the difficult times, that didn\u2019t prevent its representative assets from recording some strong gains, including Ethereum (ETH).\n\nCrypto traders and investors are now looking for indicators of further advances or declines with the market\u2019s second-largest asset at the start of next month.\n\nIn this context, the machine learning algorithms at the cryptocurrency tracking platform PricePredictions have projected that Ethereum would be changing hands at the price of $1,747 by March 1, 2023, as per data accessed by Finbold on February 21.\n\nEthereum 30-day price prediction. Source: PricePredictions\n\nShould the predictions of the machine algorithm, which deploys indicators like relative strength index (RSI), Bollinger Bands (BB), moving averages (MA), moving average convergence divergence (MACD), and others, prove correct, this would mean that Ethereum would be trading 3.1% higher from its price at press time.\n\nMeanwhile, the sentiment on the 1-week gauges over at the finance and crypto tracking website TradingView is generally positive and suggests \u2018buy\u2019 at 12 \u2013 as summarized from the oscillators pointing towards \u2018neutral\u2019 at 8 and moving averages sitting in the \u2018buy\u2019 zone at 10.\n\nEthereum 1-week sentiment gauges: Source: TradingView\n\nEthereum price analysis\n\nAs things stand, the price of Ethereum currently stands at $1,694, which represents a modest increase of 0.13% over the last 24 hours but, at the same time, a more significant gain of 12.4% across the previous week and a 4.17% growth on its monthly chart.\n\nEthereum 7-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nWhether the second-largest decentralized finance (DeFi) succeeds in reaching the price set by the machine learning algorithms remains to be seen and will largely depend on the developments surrounding the Ethereum ecosystem, such as the long-awaited Shanghai upgrade set to go live in March, that will enable the phased release of staked ETH.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "title": "Ethereum derivatives data suggests $1,700 might not remain a resistance level for long - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The price of Ether (ETH) rallied 18% between Feb. 13 and Feb. 16 but has since been range trading near the $1,700 level. Despite the recent price improvement, Ether derivatives metrics remain neutral-to-bullish as investors ponder the tighter regulatory environment and the potential impact of Ethereum\u2019s Shanghai upgrade.\n\nInvestors\u2019 biggest concern right now is regulation, especially after the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Stability Board recently stated that most stablecoins fail to meet international standards. The FSB was created by the G20 and is affiliated with the Bank of International Settlements. FSB chair Klaas Knot stated that the appropriate regulation of crypto-assets should be \u201cbased on the principle of same activity, same risk, same regulation.\u201d\n\nIn more positive news, there has been some improvement in China after the government is reportedly taking a softer approach to Hong Kong\u2019s crypto hub aspirations. According to a Feb. 20 Bloomberg report, representatives from China have been frequenting Hong Kong crypto gatherings seeking to understand local crypto business operations.\n\nA recent Binance report detailed the status of Ether staking and explored why the Shanghai upgrade may not result in the ETH sell pressure that some traders have predicted. Their rationale is based on liquid staking derivatives, which allow users to benefit from staked Ether while retaining the ability to sell the derivative token.\n\nLet's look at Ether derivatives data to understand if the $1,700 price rejection has impacted crypto investors\u2019 sentiment.\n\nETH futures show higher demand for leverage longs\n\nThe two-month futures annualized premium should trade between 4% to 8% in healthy markets to cover costs and associated risks. However, when the contract trades at a discount versus regular spot markets, it shows a lack of confidence from traders and is a bearish indicator.\n\nEther 2-month futures annualized premium. Source: Laevitas\n\nThe chart above shows that derivatives traders are no longer neutral-to-bearish after the Ether futures premium exceeded the 4% threshold. More importantly, it shows resilience even as ETH failed to sustain the $1,700 support on Feb. 21.\n\nThe lessened demand for leverage shorts (bears) does not necessarily translate to an expectation of positive price action. Traders should analyze Ether\u2019s options markets to understand how whales and market makers are pricing the odds of future price movements.\n\nOptions risk metrics move away from bearish sentiment\n\nThe 25% delta skew is a telling sign when market makers and arbitrage desks are overcharging for upside or downside protection.\n\nIn bear markets, options investors give higher odds for a price dump, causing the skew indicator to rise above 10%. On the other hand, bullish markets tend to drive the skew metric below -10%, meaning the bearish put options are in less demand.\n\nEther 30-day options 25% delta skew: Source: Laevitas.ch\n\nThe delta skew flirted with the bearish 10% level on Feb. 14, signaling stress from professional traders. However, the situation improved through the week as the index moved close to 0 \u2014 indicating similar upside and downside risk appetite.\n\nCurrently, options and futures markets point to pro traders moving to a neutral-to-bullish sentiment, displaying higher odds of ETH breaking above the $1,700 resistance. Consequently, the odds favor Ether bulls as investors remained calm despite the regulatory pressure and negative emotions associated with the upcoming Shanghai upgrade.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "Ether (ETH) fell short of a bullish breakout based on technical and on-chain analysis, suggesting that the consolidation below the $2,000 price level could continue in the medium term. At the same time, a lack of sellers and strong fundamentals will likely protect Ether from steep declines.\n\nEther encounters resistance at long-term bullish reversal points\n\nETH/USD has increased by 42.80% since the start of 2023 thanks to a short squeeze in the altcoin market, negative investor sentiment and low liquidity conditions. Based on on-chain and technical levels, the rally has paused at a crucial bull-bear pivot.\n\nGlassnode\u2019s Relative Unrealized Loss metric measures the loss scale on Ether holders\u2019 books. The orange line represents the bull-bear pivot line, where consolidation above this level signifies bear trends and vice versa. Usually, the market begins bullish trends after a breakout from previous all-time highs or consolidation over long periods, signified by a steep decline in the Unrealized Loss metric.\n\nEthereum unrealized loss metric. Source: glassnode\n\nSimilarly, from a technical perspective, Ether bulls failed to overcome the resistance at 0.082 Bitcoin (BTC), bringing the price back to the parallel trading range between 0.053 BTC and 0.082 BTC.\n\nETH/BTC weekly price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nWill this time be different?\n\nBased on historic levels, Ether missed the previous bottom levels by a huge margin; the minimum percentage of supply in profit extended to 42.1% compared to the 20%\u201330% tapped during previous bear markets. It suggests the likelihood of more pain ahead for ETH holders. However, on-chain trends show robust activity and buying, reducing the downside risk significantly.\n\nEthereum\u2019s percentage supply in profit. Source: glassnode\n\nThe net position change of Ether on exchanges shows a stark difference between the current and previous bear markets. Between 2018 and 2020, Ether inflows to exchanges were significantly higher than outflows, indicating that many holders moved their coins to exchanges to sell. However, during the negative period of 2022, although the price dropped, exchange outflows remained strong, suggesting that the selling pressure is weaker in the current bear market.\n\nETH net exchange position change. Source: glassnode\n\nThe percentage supply of Ether locked in smart contracts tells a similar story, with no significant declines in Ether locked in smart contracts. The uptrend that began in late 2020 held strong through the downturns of 2022, suggesting that withdrawals are unlikely anytime soon.\n\nThe percentage supply of ETH locked in smart contracts. Source: glassnode\n\nEther has a lot going on as the network continues to evolve to support sustainable usage and yields for Ether holders. Ethereum\u2019s shift from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake in September 2022 was a momentous event for the network, as it became environmentally friendly and, more importantly, reduced inflation.\n\nMoreover, the Ethereum Improvement Proposal 1559 proposal implemented earlier in 2022 introduced burning of Etherum fees, which, combined with reduced issuance after the Merge, contributed to making the asset deflationary. The total Ether supply is down around 0.015% since the Merge.\n\nHowever, CoinShares\u2019 data of institutional flow into digital asset investment products shows that more sophisticated investors have yet to warm up to Ether, sticking primarily to Bitcoin. The year-to-date investment in Ether in 2023 has been only $8 million, compared to $158 million in Bitcoin and $23 million in Bitcoin shorts.\n\nInstitutional flows into digital asset investment products. Source: CoinShares\n\nRegulatory clarity and Ethereum\u2019s scalability challenges are likely the key reasons behind reluctance among institutional investors. The United States Securities and Exchange Commission recently fined Kraken $30 million for offering ETH staking, which the regulatory body deemed as being a security.\n\nAs centralized service providers like Kraken and possibly Coinbase are prohibited from offering these services, institutions may be reluctant to try decentralized liquid staking platforms, such as Lido and Rocket Pool.\n\nThe exuberant gas fees on Ethereum remains a prolonged challenge that is limiting mass adoption. The average transfer fee for ERC-20 assets on Ethereum ranges between $2 and $5, with simple swaps costing around $5\u2013$20.\n\nThese charges are considerably high compared to other chains and centralized exchange fees. While development has happened across the layer-2 space, the institutions appear to be in a \u201cwait and see\u201d mode as they analyze the development of the crypto space.\n\nThe views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors\u2019 alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.
