        "title": "Coinbase Eyes Major Cancellation In Ethereum Staking - CoinGape",
        "content": "Crypto News: Coinbase\u2019s Wrapped Staked ETH, or more commonly known as cbETH, has gained significant momentum since its launch. However, Coinbase recently received more than 53,400 ETH, out of which the majority were moved from the Coinbase\u2019s cbETH deposit address \u2014 that may be related to the fact that ETH staking was terminated.\n\nCoinbase Witnesses Massive ETH Inflow\n\nOn Monday, the cbETH deposit address 0xc7\u2026a019 saw a massive withdrawal of 44,000 ETH to the Coinbase 10 wallet address, as per the data obtained from CryptoQuant. This suggests that people have been terminating their ETH staking contract, which further indicates a building sell pressure for Ethereum.\n\nadvertisement\n\nA wrapped cryptocurrency, such as cbETH, is a crypto token that symbolizes another cryptocurrency that has been \u201cwrapped\u201d or \u201clocked up\u201d in a digital smart contract. Coinbase developed the ERC-20 utility token to serve as a representation of Ethereum 2.0 (ETH2) which could be obtained by staking ETH tokens on the platform.\n\nRead More: Over 1 Billion Hedera Tokens Set To Unlock On June 1, Major HBAR Price Drop Ahead?\n\nMoreover, because cbETH is a liquid token, there is no lock-up time and the token may be used for additional DeFi operations such as lending, swapping, and providing liquidity \u2014 all of which can be done directly from the Coinbase Wallet.\n\nStakers Withdraw Rewards, Not Principal\n\nThe Shanghai upgrade made it possible for Ethereum speculators to finally withdraw their funds from the mainnet. Some individuals have been holding off on doing so ever since the staking option was initially made available in December 2020.\n\nSince Ethereum\u2019s long-awaited \u201cShapella\u201d upgrade, most stakers and entities who have staked Ether have withdrawn incentives rather than their principal. According to TokenUnlocks, staking incentives accounted for more than 172,000 Ether, or more than 95% of withdrawals. Users who had completely stopped staking and would no longer take part in Ethereum\u2019s consensus mechanism \u2014 which is used to arrange and confirm transactions \u2014 made up the remaining 5%, which was their initial stake.\n\nIn the wake of this crypto news, the price of ETH is currently exchanging hands at $1,826.91, which represents a gain of 1.31% over the past 24 hours, compared to a drop of 1.92% recorded over the preceding seven days.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin-Ether Correlation Dips Below 80% For First Time In 2 Years, What It Means?"

        "title": "What Is the Bitcoin Cash 'Ethereum Killer' Hard Fork? - DailyCoin",
        "content": "Bitcoin Cash will introduce a major upgrade to its blockchain.\n\nNew CashTokens will enable developers to run smart contracts on its network.\n\nOne core developer claims the network will be 100x more efficient than Ethereum.\n\n\n\nAmid major congestion on the Bitcoin and Ethereum networks, traders are begging for upgrades to boost scalability. Bitcoin Cash (BCH), one of the more successful Bitcoin hard forks, could soon deliver an upgrade to outshine both.\n\nThe Bitcoin Cash network is gearing up for its own hard fork, set for Monday, May 15. The upgrade will introduce \u2018CashTokens,\u2019 an ERC-20-like standard for the network. These tokens will enable Bitcoin Cash to run smart contracts.\n\nAccording to core developers, this decentralized Proof-of-Work (PoW) blockchain will be more scalable and efficient than Ethereum.\n\nHow Will Bitcoin Cash Change After the Hard Fork?\n\nScheduled for May 15, the \u2018Ethereum Killer\u2019 is a hard fork on the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) network. This means that this change to the network protocol will not be compatible with previous chain versions.\n\nThe primary feature of the latest Bitcoin Cash hard fork is the introduction of \u2018CashTokens,\u2019 which are similar to Ethereum\u2019s ERC-20 tokens. Their introduction is a game-changer for Bitcoin Cash. The upgrade will allow developers to issue tokens directly on the BCH network.\n\nIssuing tokens (and memecoins) on the Bitcoin Cash blockchain is not the most exciting feature of the upgrade. More importantly, CashTokens will enable the blockchain to run smart contracts. This feature will allow developers to build dApps directly on Bitcoin Cash.\n\nWill Bitcoin Cash Be the Ethereum Killer?\n\nSo far, Ethereum has remained the most significant smart contract blockchain network. However, congestion issues, high fees, and other issues have led to a series of competing networks. With its latest upgrade, Bitcoin Cash will be one of them.\n\nThe hard fork will not just enable Bitcoin Cash to power smart contracts. It will also enable it to harness the built-in scalability of the network, making its smart contracts run efficiently and at a low cost. In particular, one core developer says that dApps on Bitcoin Cash will be 100x cheaper than Ethereum.\n\nBitcoin Cash developer Jason Dreyzehner claims the network owes its performance to the UTXO accounting model. UTXO stands for \u201cunspent transaction output,\u201d and differs from the account/balance model used by cryptos like Ethereum.\n\nTo start with the basics \u2013 Bitcoin Cash owes its performance, scalability, and privacy to the \"UTXO model\": funds are sent to a new contract in every transaction output, so the system never reuses \"accounts\", even if you re-use an address. \u2014 Jason Dreyzehner (@bitjson) June 30, 2022\n\nThe UTXO model has several features that make it potentially better than the alternative. Each transaction creates a new UTXO, making coins harder to track and boosting privacy. On the other hand, this model also enables parallel transaction processing, allowing for greater scalability.\n\nIf Bitcoin Cash becomes a scalable solution for dApps, this could help significantly boost its utility. Rather than just being a decentralized currency, BCH will power an ecosystem of decentralized applications.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nWhile Bitcoin Cash developers boast of its scalability, the network has still not seen a substantial test of its performance.\n\nDespite its similarities to BCH, including its use of the UTXO model, Bitcoin still suffers from network congestion since the creation of ordinals.\n\nWhy You Should Care\n\nA decentralized and scalable smart contract network would enable developers to create better dApps, boosting blockchain adoption. This would have a significant impact on the decentralized finance space.\n\nRead more about Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) recent congestion issues:\n\nBitcoin Core Dev Insists on Ordinals Ban, Starts Civil War Instead\n\nRead about the latest trends in crypto venture capital:\n\nVenture Investment in Crypto Drops to New Low: Report"

        "title": "Ethereum Researchers Remain Mystified After Blockchain Briefly Fails To Finalize - The Defiant - DeFi News",
        "content": "User Transactions Continued To Be Processed Normally\n\nBy: Samuel Haig \u2022 Loading...\n\nDeFi News\n\nLast week, Ethereum briefly stopped finalizing blocks, raising concerns across the web3 community despite transactions continuing to be processed normally.\n\nTwo incidents rattled the Ethereum ecosystem on Thursday and Friday, with blocks failing to finalize for three and eight epochs (roughly 20 minutes and one hour) in separate events. dYdX, a popular derivatives platform, paused deposits while waiting for finalization to resume.\n\nDevelopers released patches for the two affected clients, Prysm and Teku, on Friday, but researchers are still unsure as to the exact cause of the problem.\n\n\u201cI'm not sure that any of us fully understand why,\u201d Ben Edgington of the Ethereum Foundation said. \u201cIt\u2019s still under analysis exactly what the root cause of the issue was and why the chain recovered.\u201d\n\nThis is the first major incident suffered by the Beacon chain, Ethereum\u2019s proof of stake (PoS) consensus layer that merged with the mainnet execution layer last September, and serves as a cautionary reminder of the experimental nature of blockchain technology.\n\nDespite Ethereum being the No. 2 cryptocurrency with a $225B market cap and a $27B DeFi ecosystem, the protocol can still encounter unexpected issues, particularly while work continues on its disruptive roadmap of upgrades.\n\nBusiness As Usual\n\nEthereum users successfully continued to transact on-chain through the incident.\n\n\u201cAlthough the network was unable to finalize, the network was, as designed, live, and end users were able to transact on the network,\u201d the Ethereum Foundation said in a blog post. \u201cAfter all clients caught up, the network finalized again.\u201d\n\nDeFi Alpha Premium Content DeFi Daily | Weekdays\n\nDeFi Alpha Letter | Weekly\n\nDefiant Podcast Transcript | Weekly\n\nInbox Dump | Saturday\n\nWeekly Recap | Sunday Looking for Alpha? Become a premium member of The Defiant and join our DeFi Alpha community. Start for free\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation attributed the incident to an \u201cexceptional scenario\u201d which caused a high load for Teku and Prysm\u2019s consensus layer clients. \u201cThe full cause for this is still being evaluated,\u201d it added.\n\nTeku and Prysm\u2019s patches include optimizations limiting resource usage during periods of network congestion.\n\nPost Mortem\n\nOn Sunday, Ben Edgington of the Ethereum Foundation and Superphiz, the Beacon Chain community health consultant, discussed the incident on YouTube.\n\nEdgington said finality occurs when at least two-thirds of validators agree on Ethereum\u2019s state during attestations after each epoch. He said last week\u2019s incident manifested as roughly 60% of validators failed to attest at the same time, preventing the network from reaching finality.\n\n\u201cIt [was] as if 60% of the validators went offline,\u201d Edgington said. \u201cTo finalize the chain, we need two-thirds or 66% of validators showing up.\u201d\n\nClient Diversity\n\nThe pair described the network\u2019s recovery as a testament to the value of Ethereum client diversity, with only two of Ethereum\u2019s five major clients suffering issues.\n\nEdgington said Lighthouse client users experienced no issues during the incident because Lighthouse rate-limits the reprocessing of old states. However, he said that Lighthouse\u2019s design could cause different problems under certain circumstances.\n\n\u201cAs we\u2019ve seen around these edge cases, it can actually strengthen things if clients take slightly different approaches because some will be able to carry the network where others fail,\u201d he said.\n\nRecurring Problem\n\nEdgington and Superphiz agreed that it is likely that Ethereum will encounter similar issues again in the future.\n\nWhile researchers are currently unsure what exactly triggered the finalization issues, Edgington suggested the speed of the network\u2019s growth may be driving up the computational resources needed to validate Ethereum.\n\nHe noted that Ethereum\u2019s validator count is up by 2500% since the Beacon chain launched in December 2020, conceding that developers may have neglected large-scale stress-testing on testnets in recent years.\n\nEdgington said Ethereum\u2019s core developers have learned their lesson and will deploy large private testnets to \u201cstress test some of these scenarios with more realistic validator numbers.\u201d\n\nEmergency State\n\nWhile the Ethereum network regained finalization on its own last week, Edgington and Superphiz noted that measures are in place to protect the network against a severe outage.\n\nFinalization usually occurs after two epochs, but the Beacon chain enters an emergency state called \u201cInactivity Leak\u201d mode if finalization does not occur after four epochs. In this mode, validators receive no rewards for attesting but face escalating penalties for failing to do so.\n\nEdgington said the mechanism slowly drains ETH from non-performing validators until active validators come to represent a two-thirds majority and can finalize the network again.\n\nHe said the mechanism offers protection against catastrophic events, such as war, which could isolate people living in different jurisdictions from each other. After about three weeks without finalization, Ethereum would fork and recognize the block history maintained by the network\u2019s remaining active validators.\n\nLast week\u2019s incident had a \u201cminimal\u201d Impact on validators, according to Edgington, with Ethereum\u2019s nearly half a million validators losing a cumulative 28 ETH during a brief Inactivity Leak period."

The more aware you are of the risks, the better you can mitigate them if you decide to invest.\n\nHype and FOMO Risks\n\nThe fear of missing out is a powerful driver for people to buy cryptocurrencies. With bitcoin\u2019s explosion in value over the past few years, it\u2019s easy to get caught up in the hype. No one wants to lose out on the chance of getting rich from cryptocurrency, especially when it has already made many people extremely rich.\n\nHowever, regulators continue to warn the public that you could lose all your money in crypto. For example, bitcoin\u2019s price has dropped about 60% since the beginning of the year, and ethereum is down significantly, too.\n\nSecurity Risks\n\nBecause cryptocurrencies are digital assets, they\u2019re potentially vulnerable to hackers. The first month of 2022 saw several notable hacks. Hackers stole $80 million worth of crypto from Quibit, a decentralized platform. And the Crypto.com exchange reported the theft of about $35 million in cryptocurrency, most of which was ethereum and bitcoin.\n\nAnalysts also warn that quantum computers could hack crypto wallets, even though the technology isn\u2019t mainstream yet.\n\nTax Risks\n\nThe IRS wants to know about gains from crypto investments you\u2019ve sold. There\u2019s a tax question on Form 1040 specifically regarding cryptocurrencies. Failing to disclose this information could lead to stiff penalties or possible criminal investigation.\n\nRegulatory Risks\n\nGovernment-imposed regulations could make cryptocurrency safer and more secure, but they might also affect your access, the ways you use it and how it\u2019s taxed.\n\nWhich Investment Is Right for You?\n\nBoth bitcoin and ethereum have increased in value by staggering percentages since their release. But they\u2019re still experimental, and with innovation comes problems that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau warns haven\u2019t been resolved. For example, the decentralized nature of blockchains means there\u2019s no one to turn to if things go wrong. In addition, transactions can be much more expensive on a blockchain than through a bank or debit or credit card.\n\nIf you decide that investing in a blockchain is the way to go, it makes sense to consider the top two. Determining which one\u2019s right for you depends on your needs and goals.\n\nBitcoin is the most popular cryptocurrency and has the most support commercially. If you\u2019re looking for a cryptocurrency alternative to fiat currency, bitcoin seems to be a good choice, as long as you\u2019re prepared to weather the volatility.\n\nTechnically speaking, Ethereum is more than a cryptocurrency. The Ethereum network acts as a marketplace for users to buy and sell goods and decentralized applications. If you\u2019re interested in more than a cryptocurrency, ethereum might be a good choice for you.\n\nDaria Uhlig contributed to the reporting for this article.\n\nData is accurate as of Sept. 27 2022, and subject to change.\n\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: Ethereum vs. Bitcoin: Which Crypto Is Better?\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."
