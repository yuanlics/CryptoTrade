        "title": "Blur Launches Long-Awaited Token Airdrop for Ethereum NFT Traders - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Upstart NFT marketplace Blur, the largest rival to market leader OpenSea in recent months, is set to begin its delayed airdrop of BLUR tokens today to reward Ethereum NFT traders.\n\nBlur launched its marketplace last October with the promise of token rewards for traders, and has granted users \u201ccare packages\u201d that represent coming token allotments. Users can finally open up their care packages today and claim the Ethereum-based tokens, with an estimated start around 1:30pm ET following a late morning delay.\n\nThe marketplace has awarded the token allotments in three waves to date. The first wave was offered up to eligible Ethereum NFT traders who used a competing marketplace in the six months prior to Blur\u2019s own launch. The second wave was for Blur users who listed their NFTs for sale on the marketplace through November, while the final wave is for traders who bid on NFTs through Blur.\n\nIT'S TIME FOR $BLUR Care Packages can be opened on Feb 14 at 12PM EST, 1AM HKG, 6PM CET. Make sure the launch announcement comes from our official @BLUR_io account tomorrow and double check all URLs before claiming. pic.twitter.com/tSbOPLqYTW \u2014 Blur (@blur_io) February 13, 2023\n\nBlur initially planned to drop the governance token to eligible users in January, but then delayed the airdrop to today. \u201cWe\u2019re trying new things,\u201d the marketplace tweeted on January 19, \u201cand the extra two weeks will allow us to deliver a launch that hasn\u2019t been done before.\u201d\n\nBilling itself the \u201cmarketplace for pro traders,\u201d Blur raised $11 million in a seed round led by Paradigm and announced in March 2022. Like LooksRare and other marketplaces that have emerged following the rise of the NFT market, Blur is trying to build up an audience by offering potentially valuable token rewards to traders.\n\nStory continues\n\nNFT Sales Jump 38% in January as Bored Apes Drive Trading Surge\n\nAnticipation for the pending token drop has apparently fueled Blur\u2019s rise over the last few months, with the marketplace sometimes topping OpenSea in terms of NFT trading volume.\n\nHowever, the hype around token rewards has also prompted suspicion over how much \u201cwash trading\u201d is taking place on the platform as users potentially manipulate trades to boost rewards. That\u2019s what happened with LooksRare in early 2022, as users traded NFTs back and forth between their own wallets at artificially inflated prices to manipulate the rewards model.\n\nBlur hasn\u2019t yielded billions of dollars\u2019 worth of suspicious-looking trades, however, unlike LooksRare did last year. But data shows that Blur has far fewer active traders and transactions than OpenSea over the past week, despite posting more overall trading volume.\n\nData from analytics platform Dune suggests that about 13% of Blur trades are classified as suspected wash trading, compared to about 2% for OpenSea.\n\nWe\u2019ll see whether Blur\u2019s surging momentum in recent months continues after users stop trading with airdrop incentives in mind. Notable crypto exchanges like Coinbase and Huobi have already announced plans to support the BLUR token once it starts trading today.\n\nEditor's note: This article was updated after publication to reflect the changed airdrop timing."

        "title": "Bored Ape Owner Burns $169K NFT to Move It From Ethereum to Bitcoin - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "A valuable digital collectible was permanently removed from circulation over the weekend, as its owner aimed to symbolically shift the asset\u2019s underlying blockchain from Ethereum to Bitcoin.\n\nThe collectible was Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) #1626, an Ape from the most valuable project in the NFT space. Its most recent sale on OpenSea took place last November when it sold for 108 Ethereum\u2014that's nearly $432,000 at the time of the transaction, or around $169,000 at today's prices.\n\nNFTs are digital assets that are provably unique and signify the ownership of an item, often digital art. The ownership of BAYC #1626 is linked to a digital token that is recorded on the Ethereum network, where it could also be traded\u2014that is, up until recently.\n\nDigital tokens can be permanently removed from circulation through a process called burning, which involves sending an asset to a location where it cannot be retrieved. Jason Williams claimed to have burned BAYC #1626 over the weekend, preventing it from being sold ever again, at least on Ethereum\u2019s network.\n\n\u200b\u200b\u201cEssentially throwing a Lamborghini into a trash compactor\u2013It's kind of fun,\u201d Williams told Decrypt. \u201cWhether putting bloated JPEGs on Bitcoin\u2019s base chain is smart or not is a whole 'nother discussion, but I think it's going to be a lot of fun seeing how it plays out.\u201d\n\nWilliams believes his Ape now exists on Bitcoin. That\u2019s because the location to which BAYC #1626 was burned is linked to an Inscription made through Ordinals. Ordinals, created by Casey Rodarmor, is a project that allows content like videos and images to be assigned to individual satoshis\u2014the smallest unit that Bitcoin can be divided into\u2014where they permanently exist on Bitcoin\u2019s network as Inscriptions.\n\nEven though the number of Inscriptions on Bitcoin is approaching 100,000, there are few notable marketplaces for people to trade them, and a significant number of buyers and sellers are linked together currently through Ordinal\u2019s discord server.\n\nStory continues\n\nOrdinals Gain Momentum With 76,000 NFTs Minted to Bitcoin\n\nThe burn took place using a newly developed feature for Ordinals named Teleburn, which creates a unique location with each new Inscription to which digital assets can be burned. The feature allows users to assign an existing asset from another network to a Bitcoin Inscription while removing it from circulation, effectively transferring the token between chains in the eyes of those who created the new feature.\n\n\u201cThe idea is that you are one-way, permanently burning an asset on another chain and pointing it to the ordinal that lives on the Bitcoin chain,\u201d said Rob Hamilton, who collaborated with Rodarmor to create the new Ordinals feature.\n\nHamilton approached Rodarmor about developing the Teleburn function last Saturday at Bitcoin Park, a coworking space in Nashville, Tennessee that caters to the Bitcoin community. The two decided to work together after Hamilton pointed out that Williams wanted to burn his Ape, who had responded to one of Rodarmor\u2019s Tweets.\n\nHelp me. \u2014 Jason A. Williams (@GoingParabolic) February 11, 2023\n\n\u201cLet's go write some code right now,\u201d Rodarmor said, according to Hamilton, adding that the prospect of burning an Ape got Rodarmor \u201creally excited.\u201d\n\nRodarmar did not respond to requests for comment from Decrypt. However, the two can be seen developing Ordinal\u2019s Teleburn function in a recent Tweet, according to Hamilton.\n\nBurning BAYC #1626 wasn\u2019t the first time that Ordinal\u2019s Teleburn function was used. Rodarmor first tested the new feature out on an ENS domain he owned, rodarmor.eth. Then the pair oversaw Williams as he burned the ape.\n\nThe term Teleburn was coined by Rodarmor, as a combination of the words teleport and burn, said Hamilton. Rodarmor referenced the function\u2019s hasty development with Hamilton in a recent tweet.\n\nHamilton believes the Teleburn function will catch on as a way for people to bridge their digital collectibles, noting that Rodarmor plans to extend Ordinal\u2019s Teleburn support to assets on other chains aside from Ethereum, such as Tezos and Solana.\n\n\u201cThis has now set the standard of representing an asset across the chain,\u201c said Hamilton. \u201cIt's going to be the way to actually have skin in the game,\u201d pointing out that assets burned are permanently gone from circulation.\n\nA chimp off the old block?\n\nAs news of the Bored Ape burn spread on Twitter Monday, Yuga Labs co-founder Greg Solano weighed in on the matter, stating the Inscription linked to BAYC #1626 is an unlicensed reproduction of the original NFT because Williams no longer maintains its possession on Ethereum\u2019s network.\n\n\u201cIf you transfer your ape to an address you no longer control (even if it's the 'burn' address), you have effectively given up your license,\u201d he stated.\n\nSolano also pushed back against the notion that BAYC #1626 is \u201cgone from [Ethereum] forever,\u201d as mentioned in the post\u2019s initial Tweet, because it still exists on-chain, even if people can no longer access it.\n\nIt's not \"gone from ETH forever.\" It's basically the same as any other transfer: If you transfer your ape to an address you no longer control (even if it's the 'burn' address), you have effectively given up your license.\n\nAnd no, before someone asks, that doesn't mean that anyone\u2026 https://t.co/E52b7ZjWbu \u2014 Garga.eth (Greg Solano) (@CryptoGarga) February 13, 2023\n\nA spokesperson from Yuga Labs confirmed to Decrypt the company believes the Inscription of BAYC #1626 is an illegitimate Ape.\n\n\"Only NFTs minted from Ethereum contract: 0xBC4CA0EdA7647A8aB7C2061c2E118A18a936f13D are legitimate BAYC NFTs,\" a Yuga spokesperson said, referencing the smart contract that yielded the collection's 10,000 Apes.\n\nWhether the new Ordinals function could supplant Ethereum\u2019s popularity for hosting digital art is doubtful, according to the CEO of Web3 development platform Hiro Alex Miller. Hiro builds tools for Stacks, a network built on top of Bitcoin that aims to bring smart contract functionality to the underlying network.\n\n\u201cAs much as I am very pro-Bitcoin and think there\u2019s going to be a massive ecosystem there, it's not going to replace Ethereum NFTs tomorrow, or probably at all,\u201d Hiro told Decrypt. \u201cI think it's gonna be interesting to see where this goes.\u201d\n\nMiller said the Teleburn function provides a solution for keeping track of a digital art\u2019s provenance\u2014the record of prior ownership\u2014across blockchains, adding that it\u2019s challenging to establish which digital collectible is the real one if it exists in circulation on multiple chains.\n\nThe Hiro CEO also compared how data is stored on Bitcoin using Ordinals versus Ethereum NFTs. While it\u2019s possible to store assets such as images on-chain using Ethereum, most NFTs point to an asset that is stored off-chain, whether that\u2019s also an image or another type of file. With Inscriptions, the data is stored directly and permanently on Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain.\n\nRegardless of whether the Inscription of BAYC #1626 is an unofficial version of its Ethereum-based predecessor, Miller thinks the collectible will \u201ccarry a lot of value\u201d because of its first-of-a-kind nature.\n\n\u201cHe basically turned it into something that is now an ultra-rare [Ape],\u201d Miller said, referencing the categories by which NFTs are often ascribed value based on the rarity of their attributes. \u201cThe market is going to value it as its own unique piece of art.\u201d"

Hiro builds tools for Stacks, a network built on top of Bitcoin that aims to bring smart contract functionality to the underlying network.\n\n\u201cAs much as I am very pro-Bitcoin and think there\u2019s going to be a massive ecosystem there, it's not going to replace Ethereum NFTs tomorrow, or probably at all,\u201d Hiro told Decrypt. \u201cI think it's gonna be interesting to see where this goes.\u201d\n\nMiller said the Teleburn function provides a solution for keeping track of a digital art\u2019s provenance\u2014the record of prior ownership\u2014across blockchains, adding that it\u2019s challenging to establish which digital collectible is the real one if it exists in circulation on multiple chains.\n\nThe Hiro CEO also compared how data is stored on Bitcoin using Ordinals versus Ethereum NFTs. While it\u2019s possible to store assets such as images on-chain using Ethereum, most NFTs point to an asset that is stored off-chain, whether that\u2019s also an image or another type of file. With Inscriptions, the data is stored directly and permanently on Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain.\n\nRegardless of whether the Inscription of BAYC #1626 is an unofficial version of its Ethereum-based predecessor, Miller thinks the collectible will \u201ccarry a lot of value\u201d because of its first-of-a-kind nature.\n\n\u201cHe basically turned it into something that is now an ultra-rare [Ape],\u201d Miller said, referencing the categories by which NFTs are often ascribed value based on the rarity of their attributes. \u201cThe market is going to value it as its own unique piece of art.\u201d"
