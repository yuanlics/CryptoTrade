Grayscale Investments, a major player in the digital asset management sector, submitted the ETF request in September, aiming to provide investors with exposure to the anticipated future price movements of Ethereum.\n\nKnown for routinely extending timelines for crypto-related product decisions, the SEC clarified that it needs additional time to thoroughly assess the proposed changes in regulations and address related issues. While Grayscale's application revolves around an ETF tied to Ethereum futures, the SEC is currently managing a backlog of spot Bitcoin ETF applications, including those from significant Wall Street players such as BlackRock.\n\nDespite persistent investor demand for a Bitcoin ETF, the SEC has consistently rejected previous applications, citing concerns about potential market manipulation. However, Ethereum futures ETFs made their recent debut in the U.S. market, with several firms introducing a total of nine products on the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) just last month.\n\nGrayscale has actively been in discussions with the SEC, previously taking legal action against the regulator over its rejection of a spot Bitcoin ETF application. Despite these delays, analysts from Bloomberg Intelligence project a 90% likelihood of the SEC approving a Bitcoin ETF in the U.S. by January 10, 2024.\n\nLet us know what you loved about this article, what could be improved, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form."

This comes as #ETH tests a major resistance zone between $2,000 and $2,150, aligning with the x-axis of an ascending triangle pattern.\n\n\n\nA pullback from this resistance level could lead to a dip toward\u2026 pic.twitter.com/oKGCT6tVrj \u2014 Ali (@ali_charts) November 15, 2023\n\nA break below this resistance level could lead to a dip toward the triangle's hypotenuse at $1,700 before the uptrend resumes.\n\nAli identified the $2,150 price point as the crucial level to watch, as a sustained three-day candlestick close above this level might offset the bearish outlook.\n\nAt the time of writing, ETH was down 0.75% in the last 24 hours to $2,019. This is as the crypto market held in a mixed price reaction after softer-than-expected inflation stats released on Tuesday.\n\nThe Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased by 3.2% in the year to October, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics' latest release. Economists predicted the index would rise 3.3% year over year, down from 3.7% published last month.\n\nThe Federal Reserve of the United States opted to hold interest rates steady this month at a target range of 5.25% to 5.50%, its second pause in a row.\n\nAs the overall crypto market remains flat, Santiment, an on-chain analytics start-up, advises keeping an eye on the rising social volume for BTC and ETH, as well as large caps, as more traders seem to be getting interested in markets again.\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum's fees have risen back to their highest levels in four months as network usage grew. ETH fees rose to $5.72 per transaction on Sunday, the highest since July 4, Santiment reported."

        "title": "Ethereum Breakout: Analyst Explains Why The King Of The Altcoins Is Destined For $10,000 - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Crypto analyst Tony The Bull, founder of CoinChartist, has revealed why Ethereum is destined to cross $10,000. According to the crypto analyst, the king of the altcoins has its top just right after $10,000 using the Fibonacci extension.\n\nHow Ethereum Gets To $10,000\n\nIn the latest issue of the CoinChartist newsletter, crypto analyst Tony The Bull used the Hurst Cycle Theory which showed cyclical reoccurrence across the ETH/USDT chart. As the analyst explains, the uptrend noticed in the Ethereum charts has usually come from the accumulation of the token.\n\nTony points out that this accumulation has always taken place \u201cat the bottom boundary of the Ending Diagonal pattern.\u201d The analyst further added that \u201cSince intracycle harmonics come in twos and threes, three cycles should complete one larger cycle that concludes with a breakdown of this Ending Diagonal pattern.\u201d\n\nTaking this Ending Diagonal Pattern into account, Tony reveals that the top of the pattern puts the ETH price at $10,000. However, this is not the only pattern that suggests that the king of the altcoins will end up beating the $10,000 level.\n\nHe also pointed out that the previous ETH rally had started at the 0.5 Fibonacci extension and reached 1.414 the last time that the ETH price peaked. The analyst notes that Ethereum is once again at the 0.5 Fibonacci extension which led to a break out in the price and the same could happen here. But this time, the target is able $10,000 if the 1.414 Fib is reached again.\n\nETH price reaches $2,019 | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nETH Moves Into Overbought Territory\n\nOne interesting fact that the analyst points out in the newsletter is the fact that Ethereum is currently in overbought territory. However, where this would usually signal a bearish reversal coming for the digital asset, Tony does not believe this is the case here.\n\nRather, he explains that a cryptocurrency being overbought usually means that it is \u201ca powerfully trending asset.\u201d So even though it could lead to a reversal, it does not invalidate the bullishness of that digital asset.\n\nHe also mentions that \u201cthe Stochastic has confirmed a 1M above 80 on the Stock.\u201d Now, whenever this has happened for Ethereum, it has often resulted in a pushup for the price. At the same time, ETH is moving to the upper Bollinger Band. Both of these setups could paint a bullish breakout for the asset.\n\nSource: CoinChartist\n\nHowever, the analyst warns that for this bullish scenario to play out, the Ethereum price would have to close above $2,450 this month. If the Stochastic moves back below 20, it could invalidate it and trigger a downtrend. \u201cBut if ETHBTC can push back above 20 this will generate a buy signal on the 1M Stochastic and kickstart Ether\u2019s over-performance above Bitcoin,\u201d Tony concluded.\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.
