The exchange maintains that the current regulatory framework in the US lacks clarity and practicality.\n\nLubin highlighted in the interview that the US regulatory approach influences many countries worldwide.\n\n\u201cThe US has a lot of influence on the world through financial intermediaries and other intermediaries, and decentralized protocol technology is about right sizing and eliminating intermediaries in many ways,\u201d he told CNBC, adding that the country is \u201call about free markets, capitalism, free speech.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "The network saw over 1 million unique active wallets accepting or sending ETH, the second-highest amount in the asset\u2019s history.\n\nThe Ethereum (ETH) network registered a spark of activity on Sept. 13, as the number of unique active wallets (UAW) connected to the network hit 1,089,893.\n\nIn an X post, Blockchain analysts at Santiment said this was the second-highest amount of UAW in Ethereum\u2019s 8+ year history, suggesting that such spikes \u201ccould be the capitulation signal needed for prices to rebound.\u201d\n\nDaily active addresses interacting with ETH (orange) vs Ethereum price (green) | Source: X\n\nThe last time the Ethereum network witnessed a spike in on-chain activity was on Dec. 9, 2022, when the amount of UAW set an all-time high at 1.42 million, with ETH trading at around $1,265, according to data from Santiment.\n\nDaily active addresses interacting with ETH (black) vs. Ethereum price (green) | Source: Santiment\n\nFTX liquidations as a possible trigger\n\nAlthough the real reason behind the activity remains unclear, the spark came when U.S. Bankruptcy Judge John Dorsey approved FTX\u2019s request to sell up to $100 million weekly to return funds to its creditors.\n\nAs crypto.news reported, the ceiling can be increased to $200 million. However, any adjustments will be evaluated on an individual token basis. Before selling high-profile digital currencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), the estate must provide a 10-day advance notice to the US Trustee\u2019s office. FTX is set to sell $3.4 billion worth of crypto in total.\n\nNonetheless, the crypto market seems to rise despite the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) coming higher than expected and FTX\u2019s liquidation approval. According to data provided by CoinGecko, the global crypto market capitalization rose from $1.031 trillion to $1.086 trillion at the time of writing. This indicates a $55 billion hike despite the two bearish events on Sept. 13.\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "content": "Through an examination of Ether\u2019s (ETH) on-chain activity, market intelligence platform Santiment has published a report indicating that the count of daily active Ether addresses experienced a notable increase, reaching around 1,089,893 on Sept. 13.\n\nThis recent upsurge represents the second-highest number of daily active addresses ever recorded in Ethereum\u2019s history. The highest count was registered on Dec. 9, 2022, aligning with Ether\u2019s reevaluation following its losses from the post-2021 bear market.\n\nAs a result, analysts at Santiment suggest that the Ether market may experience increased volatility, potentially leading to a recovery. Additionally, this uptick in on-chain activity indicates a growing demand for the underlying asset.\n\nThe #Ethereum network just saw 1,089,893 unique wallets acting as a sender or receiver of $ETH on Wednesday, the 2nd highest amount in the asset's 8+ year history. This historic anomaly could be the capitulation signal needed for prices to rebound. https://t.co/JF0g8vvBWs pic.twitter.com/1dRnPCjxcA \u2014 Santiment (@santimentfeed) September 14, 2023\n\nEthereum, whose native crypto, ETH, is the second-largest by market capitalization, is presently encountering immediate market instability after a recent price decline that pushed it below the $1,700 threshold. Nevertheless, Ethereum maintains its position in the decentralized finance ecosystem and smart contract arena, securing around $20 billion in total value locked.\n\nEthereum remains attractive to institutional investors, as seen in the growing interest in spot exchange-traded funds. Additionally, the Ethereum network holds a central role in numerous blockchains due to its Ethereum Virtual Machine network. As a result, Ethereum\u2019s prospects seem largely optimistic, supported by the network\u2019s significant valuation, liquidity and strong trading activity.\n\nWhen it comes to analyzing Ether\u2019s price, it\u2019s worth noting that, despite being a prominent altcoin with unique fundamentals, ETH\u2019s price movement is still considerably impacted by Bitcoin (BTC). Throughout history, September, particularly before a halving event, has been recognized as a bearish period for the cryptocurrency market.\n\nRelated: Nasdaq\u2019s Hashdex mixed Ether ETF filing joins crypto ETF race\n\nThis might suggest that Ether\u2019s price will continue its decline in the upcoming weeks, potentially nearing the next support level at approximately $1,500. In addition, the cryptocurrency is encountering significant selling pressure as both weekly and daily death crosses form between the 50- and 200-day moving averages.\n\nCollect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space.\n\nMagazine: Ethereum is \u2018woefully undervalued\u2019 but growing more powerful: DeFi Dad, Hall of Flame"
