This test was the most anticipated of all three given that it has the largest validator set and mimics the Ethereum blockchain\u2019s activity most closely. It was also the last opportunity for staking providers to test that staked ETH withdrawals would be properly processed before the upgrade goes live."

        "content": "Real Vision CEO Raoul Pal says he is bullish on the leading smart contract platform Ethereum (ETH) after a month-long market correction.\n\nThe former Goldman Sachs executive says in a new strategy session that ETH could be setting the stage for a major run to the upside.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really bullish. I look at the chart. The chart looks great. It feels like we\u2019ve just had this nice kind of month-long correction. I am looking at the ETH [chart], but you can use any of the charts. I don\u2019t know what it is, but there\u2019s one thing that\u2019s just going to trigger this. I then went back and looked at all the other previous pick-ups from the low and then versus stuff like Amazon back in 2003-04. I look at all of this stuff and normally it always goes higher and faster than people expect. And then corrects.\u201d\n\nPal sets price targets of between $2,000 to $3,000 for an Ethereum run to the upside. However, he says the price of ETH could go even higher since Ethereum is burned when used in transitions, making it more scarce.\n\n\u201cIt could be anywhere between $2,000 and $3,000. Let\u2019s call it that. It could be even higher. I don\u2019t know. Because there are a lot of mechanics in ETH which is very lopsided because of the burn. The more people come into the network, the less ETH is around. I think it might become a problem for ETH, but it\u2019s going to give it a lot of upside volatility.\u201d\n\nPal says Ehtereum may go on an unexpected V-shape recovery.\n\n\u201cThere is a risk of a V-shape up. That\u2019s the risk I think is underpriced.\u201d\n\nEthereum is worth $1,673 at time of writing.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Ethereum now commands two out of the top 10 market cap spots, after the premiere ETH staking derivative flipped Binance\u2019s stablecoin earlier this week.\n\nLido Staked ETH (stETH) is now worth more than $10 billion, per CoinGecko, eclipsing Binance USD (BUSD), which now has only $8.4 billion in circulation.\n\nBUSD had about double that at the start of the year, ranking it in seventh place, slightly behind XRP.\n\nIts issuer Paxos has faced compounding redemptions after a Wells notice from the SEC claimed the stablecoin represents an unregistered securities offering.\n\nClick play to watch stETH flip BUSD and enter the top 10 | Chart by David Canellis\n\nLike other liquid staking providers, Lido allows ether holders to stake their ETH in return for a separate derivative token, stETH.\n\nStaking directly to the Ethereum blockchain without services such as Lido requires 32 ETH ($56,500) to operate a staking validator node. All staked ether cannot be withdrawn until the network\u2019s next big upgrade, Shanghai, goes live next month.\n\nStETH turns ETH staked via Lido into an immediately liquid asset, which can either be traded on crypto exchanges, lent out or used as collateral for loans across DeFi protocols.\n\nThe token is backed by ether locked in staking, but its price isn\u2019t directly pegged; stETH has wavered from ETH parity at times.\n\nLido also automatically pays stETH holders daily staking rewards passed down from the Ethereum blockchain. There\u2019s currently just shy of 5.6 million ETH ($9.9 billion) staked inside Lido\u2019s protocol (excluding interest), according to Nansen, up 150% from around 2.3 million ETH ($4.1 billion) one year ago. Etherscan shows more than 171,000 wallet addresses hold stETH.\n\nMeanwhile, ether dominance \u2014 which measures how much of the crypto market is ETH \u2014 hovers a touch under 20%, while bitcoin dominance is almost 46%.\n\nEther liquid staking derivatives find product-market fit\n\nIn any case, ether staking derivatives like stETH have exploded in popularity in recent months, making the best of the lengthy lockup periods associated with participating in Ethereum 2.0 consensus.\n\nThe earliest ETH stakers locked their tokens in the proof-of-stake Beacon Chain back in Nov. 2020, when ether was less than $450.\n\nETH has since rallied as much as 1,000%, reaching a high of $4,878 one year after the Beacon contract went live, before dropping 64% to under $1,800 today.\n\nETH goes up and down, but the number of ETH staked in consensus can only increase (for now)\n\nMore than 17.6 million ETH ($31.3 billion) has been staked, representing nearly 15% of the circulating supply overall.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."
