        "content": "In this week\u2019s episode of Market Talks, Cointelegraph welcomes Justin Bram, co-founder and CEO of Astaria \u2014 which allows users to put up their nonfungible tokens (NFTs) as collateral to earn instant liquidity. Bram also has his own YouTube channel with over 30,000 subscribers.\n\nWe kick things off by getting Bram\u2019s opinion on the most exciting thing happening in decentralized finance (DeFi) right now and follow it up by discussing the most important thing happening in DeFi.\n\nWe then get into Ethereum layer-2 protocols like Arbitrum and whether Bram is bullish on them or whether he has his eye set on something else.\n\nWith the next big Ethereum upgrade just around the corner, we ask Bram what his perspective is on the Shanghai upgrade and the potential of liquid staking derivatives. Is ut going to be as big as everyone hopes and thinks it will be? Does the unlocking of Ether (ETH) represent the offering of some new innovation in the crypto and DeFi space?\n\nBy the end of the chat with Bram, we hope the audience will have gotten a better understanding of the most exciting and important developments in DeFi, the potential outcomes of the Ethereum Shanghai unlocks, and the longer-term impact of this on the liquid staking derivatives space, and also the development within the Ethereum layer-2 platform.\n\nWe cover all this and more, so make sure to stay tuned until the end. Market Talks airs every Thursday. Each week, it features interviews with some of the most influential and inspiring people from the crypto and blockchain industry. So, head on over to Cointelegraph Markets and Research\u2019s YouTube page, and smash those like and subscribe buttons for all our future videos and updates."

        "content": "A popular crypto analyst says there are three metrics that are looking bullish for Ethereum (ETH) competitor Solana (SOL) right now.\n\nIn a new YouTube video, the anonymous host of InvestAnswers tells his 443,000 YouTube subscribers that Solana registered 446,000 daily active users in early April, a spike in activity that placed the project above all other smart contract platforms.\n\nThe analyst also notes that Solana has seen its seven-day moving average of non-vote transactions spike to nearly 30 million, a level it hasn\u2019t neared since last August.\n\nAdditionally, the InvestAnswers host says Solana has the second-highest number of commits since the inception of any smart contract platform, after only Ethereum, which has the most by far.\n\nExplains the analyst,\n\n\u201cWhat are commits? \u2026 When a developer does a commit in software development, it is the change made to code repository by a developer typically tracked to a version control system like GitHub or Git, and [the number of commits] helps analyze work volume, team performance, identify trends, it also helps understand where the project is going, how much resource allocation there is to the project in development, and it is an essential metric for tracking progress and quality of a chain and of course any software development.\u201d\n\nSOL is trading at $20.79 at time of writing. The 11th-ranked crypto asset by market cap is down more than 2% in the past 24 hours.\n\nI\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "A joint initiative from several Ethereum protocols will protect everyday blockchain users from being front-run by MEV bots.\n\nMore than 30 Ethereum projects have come together to launch a tool that blocks Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) bots from front-running transactions.\n\nCoW Swap, Agnostic Relay and Beaver Build have jointly developed MEV Blocker \u2013 a solution for everyday Ethereum users to protect themselves from MEV bots.\n\nCoW Swap, in collaboration with @beaverbuild and Agnostic Relayer, is proud to announce MEV Blocker. https://t.co/WIhaaGtP0e \u26f1\ufe0f MEV Blocker is a free RPC endpoint that *pays users* to protect themselves from MEV across a wide variety of use cases in DeFi, NFTs, and dApps. pic.twitter.com/Fa6cRNjrxf \u2014 CoW Swap | Better than the best prices (@CoWSwap) April 5, 2023\n\nJoining the initiative are several popular protocols building on Ethereum, including GnosisDAO, Balancer, ShapeShift and ParaSwap.\n\nThe MEV Blocker routes all transactions through a network of searchers, structured to block front running and sandwich attacks. The free service will send 90% of the profits that searchers bid to back run transactions on MEV Blocker to users, while 10% of profits will go to validators.\n\nAccording to MEV Blocker\u2019s estimates, MEV bots have extracted more than $1.38 billion from users, whether they are traders, liquidity providers or minting NFTs on the blockchain.\n\nWith the customer Remote Call Procedure (RPC) endpoint added to crypto wallets, users will be shielded from MEV bots that extract value from their transactions.\n\nAccording to Martin K\u00f6ppelmann, CEO of Gnosis, the only downside of using this RPC would be transactions potentially taking 10% more time than they normally would.\n\nnot really. Worst case you don't get the protection but then you simply end up in the same situation as with a regular RPC endpoint.\n\nOnly downside is that transaction inclusion will take ~10% more time. \u2014 Martin K\u00f6ppelmann \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\udde6 (@koeppelmann) April 5, 2023\n\n\u201cMEV blocker protects from most kinds of front-running, but especially from trade sandwiching, which is when a searcher trades just before and just after your transaction to make a profit,\u201d said the team.\n\nEarlier this week, a validator made headlines after successfully front-running MEV sandwich bots, earning $25 million worth of crypto in the process."
