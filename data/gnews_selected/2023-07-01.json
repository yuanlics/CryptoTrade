        "content": "The luxury fashion house Dior has unveiled a unique line of men\u2019s sneakers linked to its \u2018digital twin\u2019 that are integrated with the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nThe innovative step taken by Dior links each pair of the new sneakers, termed the B33, with a non-fungible token (NFT). However, Dior refrained from explicitly labeling this as an \u2018NFT\u2019 initiative.\n\nSneakers Alert.\n\nIntroducing 'B33' sneakers by Kim Jones, from the #DiorMenFall 2023 collection. Each pair is equipped with an encrypted key granting access to a secure platform and exclusive services. Sign up to be the first to shop them online from July 6. \u2014 Dior (@Dior) June 29, 2023\n\nArtistically designed by Kim Jones, the Dior Menswear Artistic Director, the B33 sneakers will be part of Dior\u2019s Men\u2019s Fall 2023 collection.\n\nAccording to a Friday tweet from the company, these exclusive sneakers will be released in a limited run of only 470 pairs, each priced at $1,350. With this initiative, Dior aims to provide digital certificates of authenticity for their shoes through the Ethereum platform, enhancing the luxury experience for its customers.\n\nDior\u2019s upcoming B33 sneaker collection will include six additional styles with an NFC chip under the right foot, but without a digital twin NFT. They will be ranging in price from $1,000 to $1,100.\n\nThis move by Dior is in line with recent Web3 trends and follows similar moves by other brands under the LVMH parent company. Brands such as French cognac Hennessy, watchmaker TAG Heuer, and luxury fashion house Louis Vuitton have also taken steps towards integrating blockchain into their operations.\n\nThe embrace of blockchain technology by Dior and its sister brands underlines the growing intersection of luxury fashion and digital innovation, shaping a new era in the industry."

        "content": "Share:\n\nNFT sales on Solana exceeded that on the Ethereum blockchain for the first time in the two altcoin\u2019s history.\n\n24 hour NFT sales on the Solana blockchain exceeded $25.5 million while on the Ethereum blockchain it was capped at $24.5 million.\n\nEthereum creator Vitalik Buterin recently expressed his support for Solana and other ETH competitors.\n\nSolana ranks among the altcoins labeled as \u201csecurities\u201d by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC\u2019s clampdown on cryptocurrencies triggered a steep decline in SOL price and resulted in a delisting of the altcoin across crypto exchanges.\n\nThe total NFT sales on Solana exceeded that on Ethereum for the first time in the two altcoins\u2019 history.\n\nAlso read: Attorney John Deaton says Judge Torres decision on SEC vs. Ripple is important to crypto for this reason\n\nNFT trade on Solana explodes in a 24 hour timeframe\n\nThe total volume of NFT sales on the Solana blockchain crossed $25.5 million, based on data from tracker Sol Bulletin. At the same time, the NFT trade volume on the Ethereum blockchain exceeded $24.5 million, lagging behind Solana by nearly a million.\n\nNFT sales volume by blockchain\n\nFor the first time in the history of the two altcoin blockchains, Solana outperformed Ethereum. This is a key milestone for SOL as the asset is tackling selling pressure from the SEC\u2019s crackdown and series of delisting across crypto exchanges and social trading platforms.\n\nSolana price failed to catch up with the surge in the altcoin\u2019s NFT trade volume. Interestingly, the DeFi protocols building on the Solana ecosystem are no match for Ethereum, therefore the NFT sales volume supported the theory of rising adoption and utility of the SOL blockchain.\n\nDeFi data tracker DeFiLlama pegs the total volume locked (TVL) in the Ethereum blockchain at $26.7 billion, while for Solana it is a meager $265.57 million. If the NFT trade volume on the Solana blockchain continues rising, there is a likelihood of the protocol\u2019s TVL climbing in the long term, fueling SOL price recovery."

        "content": "In the past 24 hours, Solana\u2019s NFT daily sales volume increased, surpassing Ethereum\u2019s for the first time since May 2022.\n\nDuring a 24-hour period from June 30, the Solana (SOL) network produced more NFT sales in volume than Ethereum (ETH). This contrasts with the high-value Ethereum NFT market, which has recently declined in trade volume.\n\nAccording to information provided by CryptoSlam, the sales of Solana NFTs on the secondary market generated close to $24.2 million over the previous day, while sales of Ethereum totaled $21.2 million.\n\nBlockchain sales by NFT volume | Source: CryptoSlam\n\nDespite the slight disparity between the platforms, this is the first time the smaller Solana market has surpassed Ethereum in terms of the dollar amount earned by sales over 24 hours in over one year. According to CryptoSlam, sales of Solana NFTs increased by 166.11% over that previous window\u2019s 24-hour period.\n\nYou might also like: Solana\u2019s Cardinal Protocol shuts down due to economic challenges\n\nLast year, Solana surpassed Ethereum in 24H sales volumes for the first time, reportedly fueled by Trippin\u2019 Ape Tribe. The Trippin\u2019 Ape Tribe was a brand-new Solana NFT profile image project that went live on Magic Eden in April 2022.\n\n\ud83c\udf00\ud83c\udf00GM \ud83c\udf00\ud83c\udf00\n\n\n\nAre you following the White Rabbit? \ud83d\udc30 pic.twitter.com/qKuTXbFRtV \u2014 Trippin\u2019 Ape Tribe (@TrippinApeNFT) June 26, 2023\n\nTrippin\u2019 Ape Tribe accounted for over $14.5 million of Solana\u2019s NFT sales total over the said period. As a result, it outperformed all other Ethereum and Solana initiatives during that time by a significant amount. Ethereum\u2019s Bored Ape Yacht Club, which generated $3.5 million in sales, came in second.\n\nOpenSea supports Solana NFTs\n\nSoon, these achievements might become more typical. In a recent fundraising round, OpenSea, a major NFT marketplace valued at $13.3 billion, announced that it would now support Solana NFTs. Before Polygon (MATIC) NFTs, OpenSea was only a marketplace for Ethereum NFTs. Shortly after, OpenSea\u2019s rival Rarible swiftly imitated OpenSea\u2019s actions and enabled Solana NFTs on its platform.\n\nEven though Solana is displaying several signs of growth, the Ethereum market continues to be considerably more valuable overall. According to CryptoSlam, Solana NFT trade volume over the past seven days has been close to $41 million, while Ethereum trading volume has been close to $166 million. The difference between Solana and Ethereum after 30 days considerably widen to about $380 million.\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

At the time of writing, this stood at $9.78 billion, with Arbitrum [ARB] enjoying a 60% market share and a total value locked (TVL) of $5.87 billion.\n\nENS domain name purchases in Q2\n\nAccording to data from on-chain analytics platform Dune Analytics, monthly ENS domain name registrations totaled 79,463 last quarter.\n\nWith June marked by a steep fall in gas fees paid on the Ethereum Network, the month logged the highest count of registrations during the three-month period under review. Per data from Dune Analytics, 35,932 ENS name registrations were made in June alone.\n\nInterestingly, while monthly. eth name registrations ended Q2 with a rally, primary ENS name registrations experienced a significant decline.

Notably, ENS registered a cumulative $4.8 million as profit between 1 April and 30 June. Inasmuch, its revenue dipped by 21% during this period.\n\nAccording to the data provider, on an annualized basis, ENS\u2019 revenue has fallen by 5.11%.\n\nIncreased purchase of ENS tokens\n\nA look at ENS\u2019 price performance on a daily chart revealed an uptick in ENS accumulation since the middle of June.

Within the same period, ENS has logged a corresponding 22% growth in value.\n\nWith the alt\u2019s Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator posting slightly elongated histogram bars and its MACD line resting above the trend line, a bullish run was underway at press time."
