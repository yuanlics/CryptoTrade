        "title": "Can you Buy Ethereum on Cash App (2023) - Watcher Guru",
        "content": "Ethereum has grown in popularity over time. Because of its rising usage, ETH has become a popular cryptocurrency and has evolved into the second-largest one. Even though there are multiple sites for buying, trading, and sending Ethereum, users wonder whether they can do the same on the Cash App.\n\nEven though the application is called \u201cCash App,\u201d it allows users to send and receive Bitcoin. However, can users buy Ethereum using the app? Before that, let us get to know the app a little better.\n\nWhat is Cash App?\n\nThe Cash App, which was formerly known as Square Cash, is a mobile payment service that was released in 2013. It was developed by Square, Inc., with its services available in the US and the UK.\n\nUsing a smartphone app, users can send and receive money between and among friends, family, and companies. Peer-to-peer money transfers, the opportunity to buy and sell Bitcoin, a card to make purchases, and the choice to invest in stocks and cryptocurrencies are just a few of the features offered by the app.\n\nTo ensure smooth transactions, users may connect their bank accounts or debit cards to their Cash App account. Because of its straightforward layout and practical payment alternatives, it has become increasingly popular.\n\nAlso read: How to Stake BNB?\n\nCan you buy Ethereum on Cash App?\n\nThe app does not currently support the purchase of Ethereum. While users can buy Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash through the app, Ethereum is not available for direct purchase on the platform.\n\nTo acquire Ethereum, individuals will need to utilize alternative cryptocurrency exchanges such as Coinbase or Gemini. Both of these offer Ethereum trading options. It\u2019s important to note that cryptocurrency offerings can change over time, so it is recommended to verify the available options on the app to always double-check."

        "content": "People who trade crypto in South Korea are far from bitcoin (BTC) or ether (ETH) maxis. In fact, based on the latest data from Kaiko, they might be XRP maxis.\n\nOutside of BTC and ETH, collective volume for the top 20 most-traded cryptocurrencies listed on South Korea\u2019s biggest crypto exchanges \u2014 Upbit, Bithumb, Coinone and Korbit \u2014 was $201.8 billion from the start of the year up to May 30, according to Kaiko data exclusively provided to Blockworks.\n\nBitcoin and ether saw $36.7 billion and $8.9 billion in trade, respectively.\n\nSouth Korea has a storied history in trading cryptocurrencies outside of the top two by market cap. Those digital assets typically account for 70% to 80% of total South Korean trade volume, according to Kaiko senior analyst Dessislava Aubert.\n\nAside from BTC, Ripple\u2019s XRP is the most popular in South Korea by far.\n\nXRP captured 12% of the non-BTC and ETH volume.\n\n$24.5 billion XRP traded over the first five months of the year.\n\nXRP saw 66% of bitcoin\u2019s volume and nearly three times ether\u2019s.\n\nSouth Korea has traded more than $3.8 billion in Serum so far this year, one of the ill-fated \u2018Sam Coins\u2019 wrecked by the FTX scandal\n\nDogecoin (DOGE) was second at nearly 4%, with payments-focused network Solar (SXP) trailing with 3.4%. (Solar was rebranded from Swipe.io after Binance acquired the firm in 2020).\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC) and metaverse play The Sandbox (SAND) followed closely behind with about 3% each.\n\nSouth Korea watches XRP-SEC case\n\nTo explain XRP\u2019s dominance in the peninsula nation, Aubert said its \u201clargely due to the surge in XRP trading volume in late March and early April, when volumes in the Korean markets hit a multi-month high.\u201d\n\nAlso during that time, markets were anticipating that Ripple\u2019s contentious legal battle with the SEC was coming to a head. In an Apr. 3 Kaiko newsletter, analysts claimed traders were betting on Ripple to triumph, which sent the token soaring and led the entire altcoin sector to its peak year to date.\n\n\u2018Altcoin\u2019 has become a derogatory term for crypto which isn\u2019t bitcoin or ether \u2014 South Korea isn\u2019t phased\n\nThe case persists without any clear indication for when it might find a conclusion. Ripple Labs CEO Brad Garlinghouse in January said he anticipated the case would be resolved within the first half of the year.\n\nAs for whether the top traded cryptocurrencies are trading at a premium \u2014 as they\u2019ve done over the years from time to time \u2014 Aubert told Blockworks that \u201cXRP has traded at an average premium of 1.8% in Korean markets over the past year.\u201d\n\nBitcoin saw an average 1.4% premium across the same period.\n\nDogecoin is the worst performing of South Korea\u2019s top five most-traded\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "The ETH Question: Why does the SEC avoid taking action against Ethereum when all else are fair game? - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed suit against Binance today in a move that has rocked the cryptocurrency industry.\n\nThe complaint notably includes language in which the SEC clearly elucidates that it considers many of the tokens that traded on Binance to be unregistered securities and lays out its case against several it considers notable offenders. The SEC identifies these \u201ccrypto asset securities\u201d as including (but not limited to) Solana, Cardano, Polygon, Filecoin, Cosmos, The Sandbox, Decentraland, Algorand, Axie Infinity, and Coti.\n\nToday\u2019s filing contains some of the SEC\u2019s most explicit language to date in clarifying its judgment, but once again avoids taking on the big question: is Ethereum a security or not? If so, why is the SEC silent on it? And if not, what is it?\n\n\u201cCrypto Asset Securities\u201d\n\nThe SEC\u2019s argument for designating these tokens as \u201ccrypto asset securities\u201d is exhaustively outlined in Section VIII of the complaint (pages 85 through 123). Notable patterns emerge from the filing: the process of initial coin offerings (ICOs), vesting of tokens, allocations for the core team, and the promotion of profit generation through ownership of these tokens, are all repeated themes.\n\nBut Ethereum is not listed among these. Gensler has remained consistently vague on the question of whether Ethereum and its namesake coin count as securities. ETH is commonly held as an investment, suggesting it could be classified as a security, but it is also extensively used day-to-day as a medium of exchange across protocols, making its function more akin to cash or ACH settlement.\n\nGensler has previously suggested that \u201ceverything other than Bitcoin\u201d in the crypto space could be seen as a security, but has notably refused to clearly state as much about Ethereum. When pressed to say the words, \u201cI believe Ethereum is a security,\u201d the Hon. Chair just will not do it. Gensler\u2019s reluctance to classify Ether is curious when his SEC is so eager to claim as much for others. Why?\n\nThe Ethereum problem\n\nIt might be a simple matter of intragovernmental contention. Ethereum could potentially fall under the purview of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which regards Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Tether as commodities, not securities. Not only do the two categories differ wildly from one another, this overlap could create a regulatory tug-of-war that would Gensler\u2019s public stance on Ethereum while trying to avoid the appearance of infighting within the federal government.\n\nAnother analysis from Protos, argues that Gensler\u2019s evasion on the matter may be a consequence of the SEC\u2019s earlier inaction following the infamous DAO hack, which saw the blockchain fork into Ethereum Classic and put the entire ecosystem at risk. However, at the time the SEC did nothing, and now Gensler finds himself in the unenviable position of making up for his predecessors\u2019 oversights. Now that the Ethereum ecosystem has spent years recovering and building credibility, retroactively declaring it an unregistered security would have unforeseen, but no doubt disastrous, consequences for investors.\n\nIn other words, protecting investors in this case would mean protecting them from the protector.\n\nHowever, perhaps another reason could lie beneath Gensler\u2019s reluctance to clearly classify Ethereum: he may not know.\n\nCryptocurrencies and their underlying technologies are innovative and novel. They represent a fundamental shift in how we understand finance and asset ownership, and in the case of decentralized ecosystems like Ethereum, they introduce entirely new paradigms.\n\nIf this is true, it\u2019s not unreasonable to suspect that most people\u2014even those deeply involved in the space\u2014may not fully understand the implications of these innovations just yet. Anything that is fundamentally new will resist categorization, and Ethereum does so\u2014this lack of a concrete \u201cconcept\u201d that both defines Ethereum but fits into previous understandings is the core problem around regulating it.\n\nThis regulatory ambiguity presents a complex challenge for Ethereum, but it does not lessen the urgency to address it. The advancement of the crypto industry hinges on obtaining clear legal definitions for Layer 1 (L1) tokens, such as Ethereum, that function simultaneously as mediums of daily exchange and investment vehicles within their respective ecosystems. The ambiguity in their status poses a significant hurdle, stalling progress and fostering uncertainty in a space that is ripe for growth and innovation.\n\nThe dichotomy of these tokens\u2019 roles blurs the boundary between conventional asset classes, forcing us to confront inadequacies in existing legal structures. To propel the crypto industry forward, regulators must acknowledge and address this nuanced reality. Until a refined framework emerges that accurately captures the dual functionality of these L1 tokens, regulatory ambiguity will continue to shroud the industry, stifling its full potential and deterring mainstream adoption. This unique crypto space requires equally unique rules\u2014ones that can encapsulate its dynamism and complexity.\n\nMaking meaningful progress\n\nThe path towards comprehensive crypto regulation is obscured by two significant obstacles, which must be addressed urgently for the sector\u2019s responsible advancement.\n\nFirstly, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) must establish a formal position on Ethereum. Given the SEC\u2019s historical inaction in restraining Ethereum\u2019s growth when opportunities were present, it has inadvertently fostered an environment where investors are left in regulatory limbo. The SEC, as the protector of investors, has a duty to provide some form of regulatory guidance\u2014even if it proves to be temporary\u2014to offer a foundational starting point and eliminate the current state of speculation. The lack of clear regulation is not merely an inconvenience; it is a failure to provide the necessary protections for participants in an increasingly significant market.\n\nSecondly, authentic, open-ended discussions about the nature of digital assets are crucial. This implies engaging in conversations devoid of preconceived notions, biases, ideological posturing, or empty rhetoric. We often speak of making space to \u201chave the conversation,\u201d but acknowledging that conversation needs to take place and actually having one are two very different exercises indeed. Perhaps everyone in the industry\u2014as well as those watching over it\u2014would benefit from practicing the latter.\n\nMentioned in this article"
