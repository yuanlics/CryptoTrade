        "title": "New ERC-20 token VMPX triggers Ethereum burn spike, consumes $3M in gas fees in 24 hours - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "VMPX, a newly launched ERC-20 token, is responsible for over 30% of all Ethereum (ETH) burns in the last 24 hours, according to data from Ultrasound.money.\n\nSoftware engineer 0xCygaar first called attention to the project, claiming its minting contract had no purpose except to increase the network\u2019s overall gas usage.\n\n\u201cThe top ETH gas guzzler is this contract where users make validators run useless/unnecessary code just to increase overall gas usage. People are literally burning their money to increase gas fees for everyone else.\u201d\n\nQedk, a smart contract engineer at Polygon (MATIC), confirmed this, adding that the ERC-20 token would make users spend more gas if they want to mint more tokens.\n\nAccording to tweets from the project founder, Jack Levin, VMPX is the first ever BRC-20 token linked to Ethereum\u2019s ERC-20 token. The project\u2019s website states that its supply is 108.62 million but fails to provide additional information about its utility.\n\nVMPX consumed nearly $3M in gas fees\n\nMeanwhile, Etherscan data shows that the VMPX mint contract consumed over 1,500 ETH, around $3 million, in gas fees during the last 24 hours. This represents around 30% of all the gas fees spent during the period, above those generated by the Uniswap (UNI) decentralized exchange.\n\nHarrison, the co-founder of PopPunk, pointed out that those who minted the token paid gas fees as high as 1.36ETH.\n\nEigenPhi, a DeFi data platform, corroborated Harrison\u2019s statement, adding that an average mint transaction of VMPX was 0.167ETH, around $317 per tx.\n\nThis high network activity saw Ethereum network fees jump to as high as 76.3 Gwei during the reporting period, according to Ultrasound.money.\n\nA representative from Push Protocol, the Ethereum messaging service, told CryptoSlate:\n\nGas fees still play a vital role in interacting with Ethereum and is probably one of the reason projects are moving to L2s or prefering off-chain yet verifiable executions.\u201d\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "title": "4 reasons why the Ether price can't break $1,970 - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Ether\u2019s price faced resistance after hitting the $1,970 level on July 3. A number of factors capped the rally, including higher odds of more interest rate hikes in the coming months and a tighter regulatory cryptocurrency environment.\n\nMacro headwinds from the Fed\n\nBesides the external factors, the Ethereum network has faced withdrawals from its smart contract applications, which also put the June rally in check.\n\nInvestors now question whether tailwinds from requests for a spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund have faded, opening room for an Ether (ETH) correction down to the $1,700 level last seen on June 16.\n\nThe recent macroeconomic events may provide some hints, including the fact that the gross domestic product grew in the United States by an annualized 2% rate in the first quarter, Germany\u2019s Consumer Price Index increased 6.8% in June versus the previous year, and China\u2019s Caixin Global purchasing managers\u2019 index reported activity expansion.\n\nThus, strong economic indicators have heightened investors\u2019 expectations of further tightening measures from the U.S. Federal Reserve.\n\nFed Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s suggestion of two more interest rate hikes in 2023, coupled with the increasing cost of capital and higher returns on fixed-income investments, have diminished interest in cryptocurrencies.\n\nOn the regulatory front, the most pressing news and events included:\n\nJune 28: European Union lawmakers moved ahead with the controversial Data Act, imposing requirements for smart contracts, including kill switches, that allow them to be safely terminated and rules for providing shareable data.\n\nEuropean Union lawmakers moved ahead with the controversial Data Act, imposing requirements for smart contracts, including kill switches, that allow them to be safely terminated and rules for providing shareable data. July 4: Binance Australia had its corporate offices searched by local authorities, part of an ongoing probe of its derivatives business, whose license was shut down in April 2023.\n\nTVL nears three-year lows as network demand falls\n\nThe Ethereum network is likely facing its own challenges, particularly after co-founder Vitalik Buterin stated on June 29 that he does not stake all of his Ether due to the complexities associated with multisignature wallets.\n\nEthereum network total smart contract deposits in ETH terms. Source: DefiLlama\n\nThe total value locked (TVL), which measures the deposits locked in Ethereum\u2019s smart contracts, reached its lowest level since August 2020. The indicator declined by 3.1% to 13.7 million Ether in the 30 days leading up to July 4, according to DefiLlama.\n\nA lower TVL means either investors are losing interest in the network\u2019s smart contract use or have moved to layer-2 alternatives in search of lower transaction fees. Either way, the potential demand for the Ethereum network is negatively impacted, which is being interpreted as bearish.\n\nETH price gains fueled by leveraged longs\n\nAnalyzing the positions of professional traders in ETH derivatives is crucial to determining the likelihood of Ether\u2019s price surpassing the $1,970 resistance level.\n\nThere are occasional methodological discrepancies between different exchanges, so readers should monitor changes instead of absolute figures.\n\nETH top traders' futures long-to-short ratio. Source: CoinGlass\n\nDespite Ether trading within a narrow range of $1,815 to $1,975 since June 22, professional traders have increased their leveraged long positions in futures, as indicated by the long-to-short ratio.\n\nAt crypto exchange Binance, the long-to-short ratio sharply increased, from 1.14 on June 20 to 1.30 on July 4. Similarly, at OKX, the long-to-short ratio increased from 0.76 on June 20 to a 2.25 peak on July 4, favoring leveraged longs.\n\nTo exclude externalities that might have solely impacted Ether futures, one should analyze the ETH options markets. The 25% delta skew indicator compares similar call (buy) and put (sell) options and will turn positive when fear is prevalent because the protective put option premium is higher than the call options.\n\nEther 30-day 25% delta skew. Source: Laevitas\n\nThe skew indicator will move above 8% if traders fear an Ether price crash. On the other hand, generalized excitement reflects a negative 8% skew.\n\nAs displayed above, the delta skew flirted with moderate optimism between July 3 and July 4 but was unable to sustain such a level. Presently, the negative 2% metric displays a balanced demand for call and put options.\n\nRelated: The Supreme Court could stop the SEC\u2019s war on crypto\n\nETH at $1,700 might be distant, but so is $2,000\n\nConsidering these four reasons \u2014 namely, increased leverage long-to-short ratio, declining TVL, potential interest rate increases and tighter cryptocurrency regulation \u2014 ETH bears are in a better position to hold back the positive price impact coming from the Bitcoin ETF saga.\n\nAlthough these factors may not be sufficient to drive ETH\u2019s price down to $1,700, they present significant obstacles for ETH bulls. Notably, the previous attempt to break $2,000 on April 13 lasted less than a week. Therefore, in the short term, bears have better odds of successfully defending the $1,970 resistance.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.
