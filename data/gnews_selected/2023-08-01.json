This type of batching of liquidity is good for nascent markets, and it\u2019s very common. If you think about the New York Stock Exchange, it actually started as the daily auction, so it wasn\u2019t a continuous market, as we know now.\u201d"

        "content": "Quick Take\n\nEthereum has reached a significant achievement by cracking into the top 50 global assets based on market capitalization, with a current worth of $223 billion. This pushes it past palladium and brings it to just $17 billion behind platinum, indicating a notable surge among global assets.\n\nBitcoin also retains a substantial rank as the 12th largest global asset by market capitalization, with a valuation of approximately $570 billion. Although it\u2019s still significantly away from the top group\u2014occupied by tech stocks and precious metals such as silver and gold\u2014its stature remains among the world\u2019s leading assets.\n\nThese advancements highlight the growing impact of cryptocurrencies on the global financial stage. Specifically, Ethereum\u2019s upward trajectory underscores the evolving character of the market as it establishes its position alongside traditional assets like precious metals.\n\nInvestors and market watchers alike will likely continue to closely monitor the progress of both Bitcoin and Ethereum as they challenge conventional asset classes and potentially reshape the hierarchy of global market capitalizations."

        "content": "Charles Hoskinson, the founder of Cardano, has recently emphasized the financial advantage of Cardano over Ethereum when it comes to transaction costs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe crypto mogul pointed to a tweet claiming a transaction of 56 assets on the Cardano network cost just $0.14, a fee he claims could never be matched by Ethereum.\n\nIn his tweet, he hints that the lower costs may be attributed to the unique features of Cardano's blockchain architecture including extended UTXO (Eutxo), native assets, and its smart contract language Plutus.\n\nExtended UTXO refers to the underlying ledger model of Cardano. Meanwhile, Plutus is the platform\u2019s smart contract language, which powers decentralized applications (DApps). These elements are designed to ensure secure and cost-efficient transactions, which is key to the overall utility and adoption of a blockchain network.\n\nThe lower transaction cost is a major point of contention between Cardano and Ethereum, the latter of which has faced criticism for its high transaction fees, particularly during periods of network congestion. Cardano, which is known as the \"Japanese Ethereum,\" is aiming to offer a more accessible, affordable, and permissionless blockchain.\n\nHoskinson's comments align with his previous criticisms of Ethereum, where he notably challenged the staking mechanism of the blockchain he once helped to create.\n\nHe has been known to contrast the approaches of the two platforms, suggesting that Cardano's proof-of-stake protocol is designed more effectively, contributing to its superiority over Ethereum.\n\nIn a series of critical remarks, Hoskinson has also described Ethereum as \"a dumpster fire\" and suggested that it could become obsolete."

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nEric Balchunas, Bloomberg's senior analyst for exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and his colleague James Seyffart summarized all approval requests for Ethereum (ETH) futures ETFs that are under review by the U.S. Securities and Exchanges Commission.\n\nVanEcks, ProShares, Grayscale, who else? Six Ethereum ETFs might be approved by October\n\nBitwise, Roundhill, VanEck, ProShares and Grayscale submitted their Ethereum Futures ETF filings with the SEC yesterday, Aug. 1, 2023. Volatility Shares filed with the regulator on July 28. Thus, six packages of Ether Futures ETF documents are being processed by the watchdog.\n\nHere's fresh update of the Ether Futures ETF Race, which now has SIX in the running.. nice job by @JSeyff for putting together so quickly pic.twitter.com/G1rwwfaFoS \u2014 Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) August 1, 2023\n\nProShares even filed with SEC for two products: ProShares Short Ether Strategy ETF and ProShares Ether Strategy ETF.\n\n\n\nThese statistics were shared by Bloomberg's Eric Balchunas in his Twitter account. All requests are labeled with \"Awaiting Approval\" status. The deadline for the SEC to declare its verdicts is in mid-October 2023.\n\nThe commentators below the announcement are also waiting for $9 trillion asset management giant Blackrock to join the club of six Ethereum Futures ETF pioneers in the U.S.\n\nAs covered by U.Today previously, the world's first exchange traded fund backed by \"physical\" Ethereum (ETH) was launched in Canada in April 2021.\n\nLocal asset manager Purpose Investments with $15 billion in AUM released this ETF on Toronto Stock Exchange.\n\nExperts are optimistic about ETFs outside Bitcoin (BTC)\n\nFutures and spot ETFs on cryptocurrencies are considered as game-changers for the investment world. They will eliminate the necessity for companies to store Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) physically in digital custody.\n\nAs such, wealth managers will be able to invest in crypto just like they do with \"regular\" exchange-traded products. This, in turn, might trigger the injection of capital into the sphere and can be a possible catalyst for a cryptocurrency bull run.\n\nAs covered by U.Today, seasoned crypto VC Vance Spencer stressed that the launch of a spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETF would result in many other crypto-based products being greenlighted.\n\nThese major announcements might land as soon as this year, he opines."

        "title": "Term Finance brings fixed-term lending protocol to Ethereum mainnet - Blockworks",
        "content": "Fixed-term lending protocol Term Finance is slated to launch on the Ethereum mainnet today.\n\nThe protocol enables non-custodial, fixed-rate lending with collateral using the tri-party repurchase, or repo, model commonly used in traditional banking.\n\nTri-party repo is a repurchase transaction involving three parties. In TradFi, security dealers will find short-term repos to manage both their own assets and their client\u2019s assets. In the case of Term Finance, the security dealer will be replaced by smart contracts.\n\nBilly Welch, the co-founder of Term Labs, the team behind Term Finance, told Blockworks its ability to scale fixed-term lending sets it apart from other fixed-term lending protocols.\n\nMany existing fixed-term lending protocols today utilize automated market makers and liquidity pools to originate fixed-term loans.\n\n\u201cFrom a borrower\u2019s perspective, when you\u2019re trying to borrow (for example) $500,000, $1 million, $2 million, there is significant slippage,\u201d Welch said. \u201cIt\u2019s not scalable for an institutional level user, then from [a liquidity provider] or lender\u2019s perspective, you only make returns as borrowers interact against that pool. So your real returns are half a percent per year.\u201d\n\nTerm Finance, on the other hand, uses a double-sided blind auction process where the protocol matches borrowers and lenders depending on how much they are willing to bid, Welch said.\n\n\u201cWe conduct these auctions where borrowers and lenders can submit their bids and offers to borrow and lend over a period of time, and once the auction closes, we take the bids and offers and create a supply-demand curve,\u201d Welch said. \u201cAny borrower that\u2019s willing to bid at or above the clearing rate gets a loan, and any lender willing to receive the clearing rate or less makes a loan.\u201d\n\nWith this model, liquidity providers will not have to trap their liquidity in an automated market maker for an indefinite amount of time.\n\n\u201cAll you have to do is lock it up for the period of when you submit your bid, if you get done in an auction you get a loan, and if you don\u2019t you can take your tokens back and send it to another DeFi lending protocol and get variable rate lending in that capacity,\u201d Welch said.\n\nThe first public auction on Ethereum mainnet will be a one-month loan maturing Aug. 31 on wstETH collateral borrowing USDC. The auction will begin at 11 am ET today, and interested participants will have 48 hours before Thursday at 11 am ET to place their bids.\n\n\u201cThe long-term vision is we have a repo token maturing every week, every month, going out to one year. This can serve as a basis for a DeFi native benchmark yield curve,\u201d Welch said.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."
