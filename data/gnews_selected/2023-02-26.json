        "content": "The formation of a megaphone pattern in the daily time frame chart shows the Ethereum price is in a state of high volatility and uncertainty among the market participants. Furthermore, the ETH price\u2019s recent reversal from the rising trendline triggered a near-bear cycle /correction phase, which could tumble its price below the $1500 support. Here\u2019s how you may trade this pattern.\n\nKey Points:\n\nA megaphone pattern prolongs a sideways trend in Ethereum price.\n\nUnder the influence of the Megaphone pattern, the Eth price could witness a 9-10 % downfall.\n\nThe intraday trading volume in Ether is $5.4 billion, indicating a 10% loss.\n\nSource- Tradingview\n\nadvertisement\n\nAmid the increasing bearishness in the crypto market, the Ethereum price lost 6.75% in six days and tumbled to the current price of $1605. This ongoing bear cycle within the megaphone pattern is likely to cause a downfall below the $1500 support to reach the lower support trendline.\n\nHowever, the lower price rejection candles showcased in the recent price drop indicate that buyers are trying to reclaim the trend control. Thus, if the selling pressure in the market persists, the coin price will rise slightly higher to retest the 20-day EMA or $1660 before continuing the ongoing correction phase.\n\nAlso Read: What Do You Need To Know About Top NFT Discord Servers?\n\nHowever, for the Ethereum price to escape a sideways trend, it must breach the trendlines of the megaphone pattern.\n\nAs the prior trend before the ongoing consolidation was bullish, the Ethereum price is more likely to break the overhead trendline and resume that rally.\n\nThis potential breakout may push the coin price to the $2000 mark.\n\nTechnical Indicator\n\nBollinger Band: The falling Ethereum price plunged below the indicator\u2019s midline, reflecting an additional confirmation for potential downfall.\n\nMACD: a slow but gradual spread between the MACD(Blue) and the signal(orange) line indicates the increasing bearish momentum in the market.\n\nEthereum Coin Price Intraday Levels-\n\nSpot rate: $1600\n\nTrend: Slightly Bullish\n\nVolatility: High\n\nResistance level- $1680 and $1788\n\nSupport level- $1500 and $1420"

        "content": "A proposal seeking to create a $200 million fund dedicated to early-stage Web3 startups was submitted on Feb. 26 by Mantle Core team on BitDAO\u2019s governance forum. The ecosystem fund aims to boost the adoption of Mantle\u2019s network among developers and Dapps.\n\nMantle is an Ethereum layer-2 network developed by the BitDAO ecosystem. According to the proposal, a capital pool of $200 million would be deployed within the Mantle ecosystem over the next three years. BitDAO\u2019s treasury would provide $100 million in USD Coin (USDC), while another $100 million would be supplied by external matching capital from \u201cstrategic venture partners.\u201d\n\nFunds that have expressed interest in participating include Dragonfly Capital, Pantera, Folius Ventures, Play Ventures Future Fund, Spartan, Lemniscap, Selini Capital, Cadenza Ventures and QCP Capital, according to Mantle\u2019s proposal.\n\n[DISCUSSION] Mantle EcoFund@0xMantle has posted a discussion proposing:\n\n\n\n\u2705 Authorization to establish Mantle EcoFund 1 of a capital pool of $200M (catalyzed with a target size of $100M from BitDAO).\n\n\n\n\u2705 Authorization of first capital call: $10M USDC from the #BitDAO Treasury. \u2014 BitDAO (@BitDAO_Official) February 26, 2023\n\nIf approved, the Mantle EcoFund and venture partners will participate in projects with 1:1 co-investment ratio. Web3 startups raising pre-seed, seed, and series A round will be targeted by the ecosystem fund.\n\nThe fund is proposed to have a three-year active investment period, plus two years of optional extension, a Mantle spokesperson told Cointelegraph by email. The initial fund operator is proposed to be Mirana Ventures, Bybit and BitDAO\u2019s venture partner, with an investment committee comprising representatives from Mirana Ventures, Mantle, BitDAO and Bybit.\n\n\u201cThe fund targets to invest in more than 100 projects deployed on Mantle and have a multiple on invested capital (MOIC) of 1.5x of cumulative performance through the fund\u2019s lifecycle,\u201d Mantle\u2019s spokesperson said.\n\nEcoFund proposal summary from Mantle Core. Source: BitDAO\u2019s governance forum.\n\nManagement fees would be \u201cindustry standard,\u201d with a 2% fee to support operational expenses of the EcoFund team, including sourcing, due diligence, legal, portfolio support and fund administration.\n\nAcross the crypto industry, similar initiatives aim to drive adoption and innovation. Last year, Ethereum scaling solution Polygon launched a $100 million fund aimed at improving access to decentralized finance, onboarding users and accelerating adoption."

        "content": "In the world of cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) remain the largest digital assets based on market capitalization and are known to dictate the trajectory of the entire market. However, the distribution of these cryptocurrencies is vastly different, with Ethereum having a significantly higher percentage of its supply held by whales compared to Bitcoin.\n\nIn particular, as of February 26, 2023, around 39% of the total supply of Ethereum is concentrated among large addresses, data by crypto market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock\n\nEthereum concentration by large holders. Source: IntoTheBlock\n\nThis is in stark contrast to Bitcoin, where large addresses hold only 11% of the total supply.\n\nBitcoin concentration by large holders. Source: IntoTheBlock\n\nIndeed, contraction by holders metric aggregates the share of circulating supply held by whale addresses, accounting for over 1% of the supply and investors or addresses holding between 0.1%-1%. The combination of the two metrics equates to the total concentration by large holders.\n\nEthereum\u2019s onchain activity\n\nEthereum\u2019s large address concentration coincides with the network\u2019s increased development activity. The staking feature remains the main highlight for the decentralized finance ecosystem following the historical Merge upgrade.\n\nAfter months of testing, investors are set to start withdrawing their staked ETH in March after the Shanghai upgrade goes live.\n\nAlthough the high concentration of Ethereum whales has different implications, it could hint at the investors\u2019 future price outlook for the asset. It is worth noting that as Ethereum undergoes significant developments, proponents still bet the asset might flip Bitcoin.\n\nAt the same time, it can be argued that Ethereum is relatively cheap compared to Bitcoin, making it affordable to amass in large amounts.\n\nImplication of whale addresses\n\nThe concentration of crypto wealth in the hands of a few large holders is a controversial topic in digital asset circles. Some argue that it is a natural outcome of the market and that wealthy individuals should be allowed to hold large amounts of digital assets.\n\nOthers, however, argue that this concentration of wealth goes against the decentralized ethos of cryptocurrency and could lead to market manipulation.\n\nRegardless of varied opinions on the matter, the fact remains that Ethereum\u2019s supply is significantly more concentrated in the hands of a few large holders compared to Bitcoin. This could have important implications for the future of the Ethereum ecosystem and its price.\n\nBy press time, Ethereum was trading at $1,645 with daily gains of over 4%, while Bitcoin is trading at $23,657.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.
