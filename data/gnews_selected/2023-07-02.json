        "title": "Vitalik Buterin declares he is not staking all of his ETH, merely a 'small portion' - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin stated that he does not stake all of his Ether (ETH) due to multisignature wallets being \u201ccomplicated in a bunch of ways.\u201d\n\nOn the June 29 episode of the Bankless podcast, Buterin revealed the \u201cbiggest reason\u201d why he is only staking a small fraction of his ETH. He explained:\n\n\u201cBecause if you stake your ETH, the keys that access it have to be public on a subsystem that is online. For safety, it has to be a Multisig. Multisig for staking is still fairly difficult to set up; it gets complicated in a bunch of ways.\u201d\n\nButerin speaking on the Bankless podcast on June 29. Source: Bankless\n\nCharles Hoskinson, the co-founder of Ethereum and founder of Cardano, took to Twitter on June 30, stating he is \u201cat a loss for words\u201d after hearing Buterin only stakes a small portion of his Ether.\n\nHoskinson added that \u201call\u201d of his Cardano (ADA) is staked.\n\nI had to listen to this a few times. I'm just at a loss for words. All of our Ada is staked. Guess what that's how it's supposed to be for a properly designed Proof of Stake protocol. https://t.co/ye6va1DH06 \u2014 Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) June 29, 2023\n\nButerin also discussed the EigenLayer protocol, which allows Ethereum validators and stakers to \u201cre-stake\u201d their assets onto other emerging networks.\n\nWhile it is only in its testnet phase and not expected to launch until the third quarter of 2023, Buterin said the main challenge is that it creates \u201ccentralization risks,\u201d stating:\n\n\u201cTrustworthy stakers would be valued more by the system than untrustworthy stakers. Trustworthy stakers are much less likely to actually get slashed.\u201d\n\nSreeram Kaanan, the founder of EigenLayer, explained there are \u201ccomplex risks\u201d with restaking, and it is important to take a \u201cconstrained approach in building restaking.\u201c\n\n\u201cConstraints being what is really good for the ecosystem, and having constraints on building what new innovation can be unleashed based on this concept,\u201d he stated.\n\nPanelists on the June 29 Bankless podcast episode.

        "content": "Ethereum Name Service (ENS) Labs has announced plans to introduce Layer 2 (L2) interoperability for its ENS domains during a community call on June 28.\n\nThe implementation aims to improve performance, scalability, and cost efficiency for users managing their ENS domains.\n\nThe decentralized domain name system is set to implement off-chain resolvers, leveraging an ENS off-chain registrar contract and the services of Coinbase\u2019 cb.id, Lens Protocol, and OptiNames on the Optimism network. This step comes as the L2 ecosystem continues to witness an influx of projects and protocols.\n\nAccording to L2Beat data, the total value of assets locked on L2 service providers has surged by over 190% in the past year, standing at $9.78 billion at the time of writing. Arbitrum leads the market with a 60% share and a total value locked (TVL) of $5.87 billion.\n\nENS domain name registrations experienced robust growth in Q2 2021. Dune Analytics data shows monthly ENS domain name registrations totalling 79,463 last quarter. June, marked by a significant drop in gas fees on the Ethereum Network, recorded the highest number of registrations during the quarter with 35,932 ENS name registrations.\n\nWhile .eth name registrations ended Q2 with a surge, primary ENS name registrations saw a notable decline. A primary ENS name is a unique domain name registered and associated with an Ethereum address on the ENS platform. Moreover, ENS registered a cumulative profit of $4.8 million between April 1 and June 30, despite a 21% dip in revenue during this period. ENS\u2019 annualized revenue has fallen by 5.11%, as per Token Terminal.\n\nThe daily price performance chart of ENS showed an increase in ENS token accumulation since mid-June, along with a corresponding 22% value growth. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Money Flow Index (MFI) indicators were on an upward trajectory, indicating a bullish run.\n\nThe Ethereum Name Service (ENS) plays a pivotal role in enhancing the user-friendliness of the Ethereum network by replacing complex blockchain addresses with easy-to-remember names. With the latest move of introducing Layer 2 interoperability, ENS Labs takes a significant stride towards improving the operational efficiency and cost-effectiveness of managing ENS domains.\n\nThis development arrives amidst a growing trend of Layer 2 adoption across the blockchain sphere, an effort to counteract the scalability and performance bottlenecks often associated with the Ethereum mainnet. By enabling Layer 2 solutions, ENS is not only keeping pace with industry trends but also reaffirming its commitment to user experience and network efficiency.\n\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

        "title": "Ethereum Co-Founder Thinks The Over $40 Billion Staked ETH Can Be Stolen - NewsBTC",
        "content": "It appears that the co-founder of Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin, doesn\u2019t trust the security of infrastructure allowing ETH staking. Consequently, in a recent interview, Buterin stated that he would only stake a limited amount of coins to ensure the network is distributed and remain robust against malicious agents who might try to take over the platform, reversing transactions.\n\nVitalik Buterin Has Doubts On Ethereum Staking\n\nButerin has raised concerns about the potential risks of ETH staking through third-party infrastructure, specifically regarding the exposure of private keys and the danger it poses to his entire stake. He believes that implementing a multi-signature system could provide better protection. However, the current process is more difficult to set up, leading to his increased caution.\n\nIn a multi-sig system, users have their private key to sign transactions. A specific number of signatures must be provided to approve a transaction, which varies based on the Ethereum wallet\u2019s configuration. This setup boosts security and reduces the risk of unauthorized access to funds.\n\nDuring the Bankless Podcast, the co-founder explains:\n\nProbably the biggest reason why I personally am not just staking all of my ETH, that I\u2019m instead staking a fairly small portion, is because if you stake your ETH, it has to be all out, like the keys that access it have to be public on some system that\u2019s online, and for safety, it has to be a multi-sig, and multi-sigs for staking are still fairly difficult to set up, and it gets complicated in a bunch of ways.\n\nETH Prices Stable Below $2,000\n\nHis remarks have generated a lot of discussion. Most critics are concerned about the entire security framework of Ethereum. After shifting from a proof-of-work to a proof-of-stake system, Ethereum relies on a network of validators who have to stake at least 32 ETH for a chance to approve a block of transactions and earn block rewards and transaction fees. These validators are also needed to secure the network; without them, the blockchain will be susceptible to attacks.\n\nAccording to on-chain data, there are over 643,000 validators spread across the globe who have staked over 20.5 million ETH. On average, each validator has staked 32.17 ETH. Notably, the validator count has steadily risen over the years, and the number of ETH staked has sharply increased despite the recent upgrade permitting stakers to unlock their coins.\n\nCharles Hoskinson, the founder of Cardano and one of the original co-founders of Ethereum, said he was \u201clost for words,\u201d clarifying that all their ADA is staked as expected in a \u201cproperly designed proof-of-stake system.\u201d\n\nAt the time of writing, ETH prices remain firm and weren\u2019t affected by Buterin\u2019s comments. However, the coin is yet to breach $2,000 and trends below April 2023 highs in early July 2023.\n\nFeatured image from Canva, chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.
