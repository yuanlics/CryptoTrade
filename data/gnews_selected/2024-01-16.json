        "content": "Wash trading volumes on Ethereum-based NFT marketplaces are the lowest they've been since May 2022, The Block Pro's Data Dashboard shows.\n\nNFT wash trading volumes on Ethereum marketplaces hit 1.8% on Jan. 9 and Jan. 13. That compares to 36.2% of trading volumes on Jan. 1, 2023, and it's also the lowest level since the 0.35% rate seen on May 1, 2022. The percentages refer to the portion of total USD volume associated with wash trading, a type of market manipulation in which individuals trade assets between themselves to artificially drive up price or the appearance of liquidity.\n\nStamping out wash trading\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nThe NFT platforms that have contributed the the most to wash trading in the past \u2014 LooksRare, X2Y2 and Blur \u2014 have all made changes that dissuade such activity further.\n\n\"We've started to see exchanges like LooksRare and X2Y2 begin to phase out some of their trading rewards programs,\" said The Block's Senior Research Analyst Rebecca Stevens. \"Blur was actively trying to filter wash traders from their airdrop, which has made wash trading less attractive. That, in addition to the valuations of several NFT marketplace tokens dropping, has caused overall wash trading to continue to decline.\""

        "content": "Ethereum price corrected lower and tested the $2,440 support. ETH is now trading in a range and facing hurdles near the $2,550 and $2,585 levels.\n\nEthereum is attempting a fresh increase from the $2,450 level.\n\nThe price is trading just above $2,500 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere was a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance near $2,510 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair could gain bullish momentum if it clears the $2,550 and $2,585 resistance levels.\n\nEthereum Price Holds Key Support\n\nEthereum price started a downside correction below the $2,620 support zone. ETH even declined below the $2,550 support, but the bulls were active near $2,440. A low was formed near $2,469 and the price is now trading in a range, like Bitcoin.\n\nThere was a minor increase above the $2,500 level. The price climbed above the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $2,588 swing high to the $2,469 low.\n\nBesides, there was a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance near $2,510 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. Ethereum is now trading just above $2,500 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $2,540 level or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $2,588 swing high to the $2,469 low.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nThe next major resistance is now near $2,585. A clear move above the $2,585 level might start a decent increase. In the stated case, the price could rise toward the $2,650 level. The main resistance is now forming near the $2,720 level. A close above the $2,720 resistance could start another major increase. The next key resistance is near $2,780. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2,880 zone.\n\nAnother Drop in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $2,585 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,495 level.\n\nThe next key support could be the $2,445 zone. A downside break below the $2,445 support might send the price further lower. In the stated case, Ether could test the $2,380 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,320 level.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bullish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now just above the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $2,445\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $2,585\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "Ethereum outperforms Bitcoin by 20%, but how long can ETH hold $2.5K support? - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Ethereum's native token, Ether (ETH), rallied 20% between Jan. 8 and Jan. 11 but struggled to sustain the $2,600 level. The subsequent 3.5% correction down to $2,560 on Jan. 16 may have disappointed some bulls, but Ether's price has outperformed Bitcoin (BTC) by 19.5% since Jan. 8. Such gaps are quite uncommon and last occurred in October 2022.\n\nEther investors question if the $2,500 level will hold, given that the most obvious drivers are not expected in the short term, namely the Ethereum spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) and the planned Ethereum network upgrades. From a bullish perspective, these events present an opportunity for Ether to further decouple from the remaining cryptocurrency market, but they also present a risk if it either backfires or is postponed.\n\nEther usually does not outperform Bitcoin by 15%\n\nThe price of Ether outperforming Bitcoin by 15% or higher in a week is not something common, at least in the past two years. Besides the high correlation between the two cryptocurrencies, 2023 was marked by disappointment with Ethereum's declining total value locked (TVL) and persistently high gas fees, paving the way for competing blockchains. Meanwhile, Bitcoin benefited from the anticipation of a spot ETF approval, especially after BlackRock joined the race in June 2023.\n\nIn fact, the latest instance happened 14 months ago as Ether's price rallied from $1,305 to $1,615 in the seven days leading to Oct. 29, 2022. After outperforming Bitcoin by 17%, the gap closed in the following 11 days as ETH crashed below $1,100 on Nov. 9, 2022.\n\nEther/USD (blue) vs. Bitcoin/USD (orange), October 2022. Source: TradingView\n\nA single past instance should not serve as guidance for prices, especially considering November 2022 marked the downfall of the FTX exchange after reports of customer funds mismanagement and a potential $8 billion shortfall. A counter-example includes the 31 days between July 13, 2022, and Aug. 13, 2022, where Ether's price outperformed Bitcoin by 63%.\n\nEther/USD (blue) vs. Bitcoin/USD (orange), August 2022. Source: TradingView\n\nETH rallied from $1,080 to $1,990 during the 31 days ending Aug. 13, 2022, and despite failing to break above $2,000, the gap relative to Bitcoin's price persisted in the following month. In essence, a much different type of price action from the short-lived outperformance in October 2022. More importantly, the gap continued even though the cryptocurrency market capitalization faced a correction, which is opposite from what one typically expects given Bitcoin's dominance.\n\nEthereum network activity signals strength and higher demand for ETH\n\nTo understand whether Ether has what it takes to hold the $2,500 support, one should analyze the Ethereum network activity, including its scaling solutions. Decentralized applications (DApps) are at the core of this smart contract-capable blockchain, thus diminishing use in terms of users and volumes is indicative of less demand for ETH.\n\nRelated: Spot Ethereum ETF not coming 'anytime soon,' says Mark Yusko\n\nTo assess network demand, one needs to analyze metrics related to DApp usage, as some projects including games, decentralized finance (DeFi), and nonfungible token marketplaces are not financially intensive, rendering the total value locked (TVL) metric irrelevant. Over the past 30 days, the top Ethereum decentralized applications (DApps) have seen an average 26% decrease in the number of active addresses.\n\nBlockchains ranked by 30-day DApp volumes. Source: DappRadar\n\nOver the past 30 days, Ethereum DApps experienced a 41% gain in volume fueled by increases in Uniswap, Balancer, ParaSwap, and Aave. Consequently, even if one excludes the activity in Ethereum rollups, the base layer holds a 6 to 1 advantage versus its largest competitor, BNB Chain. That shows how bears' criticism toward Ethereum high fees is exaggerated in terms of dominance in the DeFi industry.\n\nBesides the strong on-chain activity, Ether's price could benefit from the \"Dencun\" hard fork, an upgrade that aims to increase data availability and reduce costs for rollup transactions. The test implementations are expected to initiate on Jan. 17. Furthermore, Bloomberg ETF analysts hold 70% odds of an Ethereum ETF approval by May, reinforcing the bullish momentum and the strength of the $2,500 price support.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.
