We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nRecent data reveals that Ethereum (ETH) whales are significantly selling off their holdings. One such instance involved a transaction where a whale sold 4,549 ETH for approximately $8.78 million, at a price of $1,930 around 14 hours ago. Notably, this particular whale initially spent $6 million to buy 4,549 ETH at a price of $1,319 on Jan. 9, which means they made a profit of approximately $2.78 million.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis sell-off pattern among ETH whales might have been triggered by a strategic move to reap the benefits of the cryptocurrency's recent surge in value. This market situation largely stems from the positive court decision in favor of Ripple's XRP, which had a ripple effect on several other cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum.\n\nA whale sold 4,549 $ETH for 8.78M $USDT at a price of $1,930 14 hrs ago.\n\n\n\nThis whale spent $6M to buy 4,549 $ETH at a price of $1,319 on Jan 9, and has earned $2.78M so far.https://t.co/pzSfTqYuPn pic.twitter.com/PEtWS9LXmE \u2014 Lookonchain (@lookonchain) July 16, 2023\n\nThe court's decision seems to have provided a significant boost to the overall cryptocurrency market sentiment, leading to a considerable price appreciation for several tokens, Ethereum included.\n\nSubsequent to the XRP court decision, Ethereum surged to around $2,000. This impressive rally undoubtedly offered an attractive profit-taking opportunity for ETH whales who had acquired their holdings at lower price levels. As such, the current ETH sell-off by whales could be a reflection of these large investors cashing in on their profits, an understandable move considering the crypto market's notorious volatility.\n\nHowever, as whales started selling, the price of Ethereum began to retreat from its $2,000 level, a natural market reaction to a substantial sell-off. This recent activity in the Ethereum market serves as a reminder of the significant influence whales can wield on crypto prices, often leading to sharp price fluctuations."

        "content": "CLabs, the organization responsible for developing the Celo blockchain, is seeking to return to the Ethereum ecosystem by transitioning from an independent EVM-compatible layer-1 blockchain to an Ethereum layer-2 solution.\n\nAccording to a proposal discussion on Celo\u2019s governance forum, the transition would include leveraging OP Stack as the architecture to become an Ethereum L2 blockchain, eliminating the need to monitor tooling and libraries composability through upgrades, thus \u201cmaking it easy for Celo developers to utilize the full gambit of Ethereum tooling/libraries.\u201d\n\nOther key differentiating factors would include an off-chain data availability layer operated by Ethereum node operators and protected by restaked Ether (ETH), along with transforming current validators into decentralized sequencers for L2.\n\nLayer-1 and Layer-2 blockchains differ primarily in purpose, but also in their design and architecture. While L1 networks are designed to be self-sufficient, L2 solutions are aimed at enhancing the performance of L1 blockchains rather than operating independently.\n\ncLabs proposed upgrade. Source: Celo's governance forum\n\nBenefits from the transition were said to include increased security while maintaining low gas fees. \u201cWe expect no material change of gas fees. As the proposal is for an L2 solution with off-chain data availability, gas costs can be a lot lower than on other L2s,\u201d reads the proposal, scheduled to be discussed on a governance call on July 21 before being released for a \u201ctemperature check\u201d on the following day.\n\nBy adopting the proposal, end-users would not be affected by the migration, and CELO tokenholders would retain control over core contracts by voting on governance proposals. Additionally, CELO tokens will also be used to pay for gas.\n\nAlthough the transition seems purely technical, it may affect the Celo ecosystem in different ways. As per the forum discussion, it could potentially enable more liquidity to flow between Celo and other chains but also generate extra costs for sequencers, such as fees on the data availability layer and gas on Ethereum. In addition, it is also unclear whether sequencers' rewards would match with current validators\u2019 rewards.\n\nWith blockchains becoming increasingly competitive, Celo has been working on improving its mobile experience by incorporating increased functionality and particular features. The Celo ecosystem is also targeting developing economies, where more technological solutions for payments are in demand.\n\nCollect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space.\n\nMagazine: Here\u2019s how Ethereum\u2019s ZK-rollups can become interoperable"

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nIllustration by Mitchell Preffer for Decrypt.\n\nIt was a week of altcoin rallies after Ripple\u2019s courtroom victory against the SEC, and details of an upcoming Polygon 2.0 rollout shifted attention away from the two market leaders.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) still gained in value, a modest 3%, and currently changes hands at $30,287, according to CoinGecko.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOn Monday, reports hit the press that the British multinational bank Standard Chartered predicted that Bitcoin will hit $120,000 before 2025. It wasn\u2019t quite enough to boost the price of the world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency by market capitalization this week, though.\n\nEthereum (ETH) fared substantially better, though not in the same league as the altcoins. It rose 6.6% to trade at $2,001 at the start of the weekend\u2014$1,932 as of this writing. On Thursday, Ethereum hit $2,000 for the first time since May.\n\nWhile the latest CPI report, released on Wednesday, indicates that U.S. inflation is going down in line with expectations, it wasn\u2019t quite enough to send investors toward the two most popular cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe first substantial bit of altcoin news broke on Tuesday when Polygon (MATIC) began to surge following an uptick in network growth.\n\nOn Thursday, Polygon published a technical proposal for Polygon 2.0 and proposed the launch of a new native token for the network: POL token\u2014a kind of upgrade to MATIC.\n\nClearly, it was already a good week for Polygon holders, but things got even better on Thursday when a judge presiding over the Ripple vs SEC case ruled in favor of Ripple.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nJudge Analisa Torres ruled that XRP \"is not necessarily a security on its face\u201d and programmatic sales of XRP to the public did not break securities laws, but some $728 million worth of institutional sales of XRP did qualify as securities offerings because they were sold to buyers who expected to profit in a common enterprise.\n\nThe news didn\u2019t just boost XRP, it also caused Polygon, Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA) to blow up by double digit percentages on Thursday. Crypto\u2019s total market cap surged 6% in the hours following to hit $1.3 trillion on Friday.\n\nAt the start of the weekend, all four altcoins were up by double digit percentages over the last seven days. XRP leads with an eye-popping 66% spike in price and currently trades at $0.72194.\n\nSolana blew up 33% and now trades at $27.44, Polygon rose 24% before settling to $0.8061 and Cardano added 22%, now $0.3299.\n\nOther particularly noteworthy rallies this week include Stellar\u2019s XLM, up 47% and now trades at $0.1316, Chainlink (LINK) added 14% to settle at $6.96, and Lido DAO (LDO) rallied 26% to trade at $2.37 as of this writing.\n\nThere were no major losses among the top thirty cryptocurrencies.\n\nCoinbase, Kraken and Crypto.com all announced they would all be relisting XRP after the momentous court ruling.\n\nFinally, regulators across the world are continuing to grapple with the growing crypto industry.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOn Monday, two high-level European Union institutions, the European Banking Authority and the European Securities and Markets Authority, both released new guidelines in the runup to the implementation of Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA), a comprehensive framework for governing the industry across all the bloc\u2019s 27 member states.\n\nMiCA comes into force on 30 June 2024.\n\nAnd on Tuesday, South Korea's Financial Services Commission (FSC) announced the implementation of rules, effective from January 2024, requiring crypto firms to submit detailed crypto disclosures in their financial statements."

        "title": "Will an Upcoming Tech Upgrade Send Ethereum Soaring? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Currently trading at a price of around $1,900, Ethereum (ETH 0.33%) is looking for its next big catalyst. While Ethereum is up by more than 60% year to date, it's still down significantly from the all-time high of $4,891.70 that it hit nearly two years ago. So it has plenty of potential upside.\n\nThat next big catalyst could be a blockchain upgrade that's tentatively scheduled to take place before the end of the year. In mid-2022, The Merge galvanized investors, and the crypto at one point rose 85% from the end of June to mid-August just before the upgrade took place in September. (The gain, of course, didn't last amid the brutal crypto winter.)\n\nCould this pending upgrade have a similarly positive impact?\n\nNot all tech upgrades are created equal\n\nAt the outset, it's important to differentiate between transformational upgrades and incremental upgrades. The Merge, which turned Ethereum from a proof-of-work blockchain into a proof-of-stake blockchain, was monumental. That helps to explain why there was so much investor excitement about The Merge.\n\nThe coming upgrade, known as Dencun (a mashup of \"Cancun\" and \"Deneb\"), will be more incremental. It has two goals: to reduce transaction fees on the Ethereum blockchain and to increase the network's throughput. In short, it will help Ethereum to run faster and cheaper, and that's certainly worthwhile. But is it really a big deal?\n\nThe answer will depend on how much of an impact Dencun has on blockchain performance. Right now, Ethereum's transaction fees (known as \"gas fees\") can become exorbitant during peak periods of demand. Thus, any change that brings down these fees significantly is certainly important. Moreover, Dencun is the next big step on Ethereum's path to becoming able to handle 100,000 transactions per second. That's a huge number. To put it into context, the Visa (V 1.20%) credit card network can handle about 65,000 transactions per second.\n\nThe big picture\n\nThe really exciting part, if you're a long-term crypto investor, is how the new upgrade fits into the bigger picture. Ethereum has planned a series of improvements as part of its long-term plan to ensure it remains a best-in-class blockchain. In November, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin released an updated roadmap for development, and Dencun is part of stage one of a five-stage process.\n\nTo put it another way, Ethereum is not resting on its laurels after The Merge. After this stage, which is known as The Surge, there will be The Scourge, The Verge, The Purge, and The Splurge. Even if each of these developmental stages lasts for only six months or so, that's still a solid two to three years more of regular improvements being made to the blockchain.\n\nShould you buy Ethereum?\n\nOn its own, Dencun might not be enough to make Ethereum soar. It's just an incremental change to help the blockchain run faster and smoother. Yes, it will improve scalability and efficiency, and it will introduce a new transaction type, but it's not a transformational change like The Merge.\n\nHowever, if you consider this tech upgrade as one step in a long-term process designed to make Ethereum a best-in-class blockchain, then it's an exciting story. Some crypto traders have even suggested that Ethereum could more than double in value to the $5,000 price level as a result of this upgrade.\n\nPersonally, I think that's expecting too much from this upgrade since the all-time high for Ethereum is just under $5,000, and that was during the peak of a huge bull market for risky assets like cryptocurrencies. But as more details about Dencun get released, and as more people understand how it could put Ethereum on the path to 100,000 transactions per second, then it's not out of the realm of possibility that the token will experience an extended rally heading into 2024. For that reason, I'm bullish on Ethereum's prospects."

        "title": "Enterprise blockchain: 'Ethereum for Business' explains key use cases - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The cryptocurrency market has encountered its share of ups and downs over the past year, but blockchain technology continues to see impressive growth as businesses seek digital transformation.\n\nRecent findings from the market research platform, MarketsandMarkets, estimated the global blockchain market size to be $7.4 billion in 2022. While notable, the report indicates that the blockchain sector is expected to generate $94 billion in revenue by the end of 2027. If these findings are accurate, this will result in a compound annual growth rate of 66% from 2022 to 2027.\n\nBreaking down \u2018Ethereum for Business\u2019\n\nSpecifically speaking, many enterprises today are using the Ethereum blockchain to improve outdated business processes. Paul Brody, global blockchain leader for Ernst & Young (EY), told Cointelegraph that he believes the Ethereum network will drive the most growth for the enterprise blockchain market going forward.\n\nTo bring this to light, Brody recently published Ethereum for Business. According to Brody, this book intends to help non-technical, C-level executives and company leaders understand how and why Ethereum applies to specific use cases.\n\nBook cover. Source: University of Arkansas Press\n\nTo ease readers into the subject matter, Brody begins part one of the book by explaining how Ethereum works using relatable language. \u201cThere are three foundational concepts that are useful to understand \u2014 the distributed ledger, the programmable ledger, and consensus algorithm,\u201d he writes. Brody then explains that every \u201cfinancial system has a ledger,\u201d but notes that the difference between centralized, traditional systems and Ethereum is that \u201cEthereum\u2019s ledger is public and distributed to all participants.\u201d\n\nThe first chapter also explains the terminology associated with blockchain networks. Brody writes that \u201cbatches of transactions are known as \u2018blocks.\u2019\u201d He ends the chapter by mentioning that the Ethereum network is often attractive to business users because it offers the \u201cconvenience of an integrated digital business\u201d without a centralized market operator.\n\nBefore going in-depth on specific use cases, Brody spends the next few chapters of the book detailing terminology like wallets, tokens and smart contracts. For instance, in chapter four, he writes:\n\n\u201cIn Ethereum, both the money and the stuff can be represented as tokens, while the terms of the exchange between two parties can be captured in a smart contract.\u201d\n\nBrody adds that everything of value is stored in a wallet when using the Ethereum blockchain: \u201cWallets are just a name for a digital account where you can store your keys and the access rights to contacts and assets you control through those keys.\u201d\n\nRecent: AI in healthcare: New tech in diagnosis and patient care\n\nChapter five focuses on oracles; as Brody mentions, \u201centerprise transactions will require extensive use of oracles\u201d since external data sources will be essential for completing smart contracts for business purposes.\n\nThe information presented at the beginning of Brody\u2019s book is extremely useful for readers that may be new to the blockchain sector. The following chapters focus on concepts like privacy, which is a crucial consideration for enterprises leveraging blockchain.\n\nIn chapter six, Brody writes, \u201cThough enterprises require privacy, blockchains do not, by default, offer privacy.\u201d Given this, Brody focuses this section on privacy applications that can be applied to support enterprise transactions. Although Brody mentions at the beginning of the book that the read is not meant to promote EY\u2019s blockchain work, he does detail how Nightfall and Starlight \u2014 two privacy mechanisms created by EY \u2014 are used by businesses to ensure private blockchain transactions.\n\nReal-world enterprise Ethereum use cases\n\nPart two of Brody\u2019s book focuses on use cases and case studies. This section is probably the most interesting because it explains why the technology could be helpful for business processes.\n\nTokenization is heavily discussed in section two, with Brody writing that it is \u201cthe single most important thing enterprises can do in the blockchain space.\u201d He adds that tokenization is often the first decision that firms using blockchain make since this can be used to digitize assets that can be easily tracked and managed.\n\nAlthough Brody explains the difference between ERC-20 and ERC-721 tokens, he emphasizes that the ERC-1155 standard is gaining traction among enterprises due to its blend of fungible and nonfungible properties. Brody shares that an EY client in the pharmaceutical industry is currently using ERC-1155 tokens to track serialized medicine packages. \u201cUsing the 1155 standard, this firm can mint large volumes of tokens and transfer them in big batches to distributors and others,\u201d he writes.\n\nBrody continues sharing real-world examples of how EY clients apply the Ethereum blockchain. For instance, he explains how Italian beer producer Peroni uses blockchain for traceability, allowing consumers to scan a QR code to understand how the beer was produced.\n\n\u201cThose looking at a beer non-fungible token (NFT) from Peroni on the Polygon PoS chain (an Ethereum side chain), will be able to see Peroni\u2019s final batch token as well as input tokens from the malt house and farms,\u201d writes Brody.\n\nIn addition to these use cases, Brody details how blockchain helps with supply chain management, contract management, carbon emission tracking, payments and more. He emphasizes in this section that \u201cBlockchains will do for business ecosystems what ERP [enterprise resource planning] did inside the single enterprise.\u201d\n\n\u2018Ethereum for Business\u2019 is educational, but blockchain is broad\n\nWhile Ethereum for Business provides an in-depth and clear view of enterprise Ethereum, readers should remember that the blockchain ecosystem is broad. There are a number of different blockchain networks that businesses can use aside from Ethereum.\n\nRecent: Bug bounties can help secure blockchain networks, but have mixed results\n\nYet it\u2019s notable that Brody\u2019s new book gives an in-depth overview of the Ethereum ecosystem, breaking down key concepts while providing real-world use cases. This is extremely important, as education around blockchain technology is still needed to drive mainstream adoption.\n\nThe views, thoughts, and opinions expressed here are the author\u2019s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph."
