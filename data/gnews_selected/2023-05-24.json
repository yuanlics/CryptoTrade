        "title": "Ethereum Staking Demand Skyrockets Following Network Upgrade - Blockworks",
        "content": "Ether (ETH) is witnessing its highest levels of staking activity following a critical update earlier this year.\n\nThe network\u2019s transition to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) late last year, coupled with Ethereum\u2019s \u201cShapella\u201d network upgrade in April, which enabled withdrawals of staked ETH as well as rewards, has led demand for new validators to reach its highest level in two and a half years.\n\nPreviously, users could stake their ETH to the Beacon Chain as early as December 2020, but it wasn\u2019t until Shapella was fully implemented that it became possible to withdraw.\n\nAs a result, over 1 million ETH was withdrawn shortly after the upgrade, sparking temporary concerns as to whether demand would simply rush to the exit indefinitely and cause the price of ETH to dip.\n\nYet, this rush has been balanced by an influx of eager validators waiting for activation, indicating a sustained demand for Ethereum staking, an analysis by Coin Metrics shows.\n\n\u201cThe entry queue has reached its highest level since the Beacon Chain\u2019s genesis in December 2020, with a total of 64,000 validators eagerly waiting to participate,\u201d Coin Metrics said.\n\nIn contrast, there are effectively zero validators wishing to withdraw, that are stuck in the queue. That\u2019s a stark contrast to withdrawal queues just last month, which stood at roughly 17,500.\n\nThe surge of new validators has helped drive the active validator count to a new high of nearly 584,000, data shows. This number has more than made up for the transient decrease in complete withdrawals that occurred when withdrawals were initially introduced.\n\nAs the number of active validators approaches the 589,000 mark, an internal protocol parameter, known as the Churn Limit, will rise, allowing for the daily activation of an extra 225 validators.\n\nHowever, even with this increased pace, individuals or staking pools spinning up new validators to join the queue today would still need just over a month to become active, Coin Metrics noted.\n\nLiquid staking tokens predicted to fuel staking value\n\nA budding narrative in the decentralized finance (DeFi) world underscores the escalating demand for Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs).\n\nThese tokens, representative of staked assets, bring a new level of liquidity to the traditionally illiquid PoS model by allowing staked assets to participate in DeFi applications while still contributing to the network\u2019s security.\n\nThey provide a bridge between staking and DeFi by offering liquid tokens that represent staked ETH, allowing holders to freely interact with DeFi protocols while still earning staking rewards.\n\nThe growing prominence of LSTs within DeFi is intricately linked to Ethereum\u2019s staking ecosystem. Behind every LST, there is a staking operation, providing the required security and validation for the Ethereum network.\n\nSome of the established decentralized players are jockeying for market share, such as Lido DAO (LDO), Frax (FXS) and Rocket Pool (RPL), alongside centralized staking providers such as Coinbase, and a slew of others, with new offerings cropping up regularly post-Shapella.\n\nIn essence, the explosion of LSTs within DeFi implies a parallel increase in Ethereum staking activity. As the role of LSTs becomes more integral to DeFi\u2019s future, it may inadvertently fuel the demand for ETH, Blockworks was previously told.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

He\u2019s a DeFi podcaster, head of portfolios at Fourth Revolution Capital and a prolific crypto YouTuber.\n\nWho is this guy anyway?\n\nPodcaster and influencer DeFi Dad has been actively making crypto content since 2019 and now has a whopping 152,100 Twitter followers.\n\nHe\u2019s also the head honcho of marketing and portfolio support at Fourth Revolution Capital, an adviser for several Web3 projects, including Zapper and Push Protocol, and hosts two podcasts, The Edge Podcast and The DeFi Podcast.\n\nSomehow, he still manages to tuck his two kids into bed every night and fight off monsters for them \u2013 which is completely on brand.\n\nBeen fairly checked out this week on vacation with kids and I have to say, it feels good to tune out while still having FOMO for what I missed.\n\n\n\nGot asked \u201cdon\u2019t you enjoy being away from work?\u201d and answer is \u201cnah, I love what I do. And I love crypto.\u201d\n\n\n\n\ud83d\ude01 pic.twitter.com/631kznAFSU \u2014 DeFi Dad \u27e0 defidad.eth \ud83e\udd87\ud83d\udd0a\ud83d\udc3c (@DeFi_Dad) February 24, 2023\n\nDeFi Dad, or DD, is a jack of many trades but has defied the old saying and actually mastered some, too.\n\nAfter completing his studies at the University of Chicago, he started a chemistry Ph.D. program with aspirations of becoming a teacher. He got bored of that idea and started a food delivery business, which he says \u201cwas a great and horrific experience.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis was before Uber Eats and before the whole food delivery craze started. It was an exciting business.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty convinced I would be divorced today and probably have no children if I had stayed in food delivery,\u201d he jokes.\n\nSeeking new challenges, DeFi Dad transitioned to software startups and then unexpectedly found himself selling \u201call sorts of camera equipment\u201d in a camera shop.\n\n\u201cI definitely have a lot of experience hopping different industries, which is probably why I ended up in crypto at one point in my life.\u201d\n\nIt was during yet another role as a project manager at an events company in New York, where he was assigned to blockchain events, that DD discovered his passion for crypto, and he hasn\u2019t looked back since.\n\nWho knows? In five years\u2019 time, we might catch up with him only to find out he has become an astronaut.\n\nWhat led to Twitter fame?\n\nDeFi Dad exudes the vibe of a hustler determined to ensure his kids have a full plate every night.\n\n\u201cNo doubt it\u2019s the typical combination of a lot of focus, really hard work, grinding it out and being present across as many different parts of Crypto Twitter at the same time,\u201d he explains.\n\nHis early DeFi videos began amassing over 10,000 views during the first surge of interest in the topic in the lead-up to \u201cDeFi Summer\u201d in 2020.\n\n\u201cI was very lucky with the timing that I was into DeFi in, like mid-early 2019, and obviously, it took off within a year\u2019s time. It has exploded and become a mainstream talking point and financial news \u2014 that\u2019s luck. Right place, right time.\u201d\n\nDeFi Dad loves Ethereum and his kids, too. (Supplied)\n\nWhat to expect from his Twitter content\n\nDD describes his Twitter content as \u201cadvice on how to get started and how to upscale yourself in relation to DeFi, and Web3 games,\u201d adding:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m more there to kind of help tell the story of what\u2019s being built and why games need Web3 elements because we\u2019re just not there yet \u2014 it\u2019s way too early.\u201d\n\nHe warmly welcomes memecoin enthusiasts to follow him on Twitter but wants to make one thing clear: He won\u2019t be pumping them anytime soon.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not someone who\u2019s going to trade a memecoin like PEPE. I\u2019m more of a long-term investor, but I\u2019m super happy for folks making money off it,\u201d he says.\n\nEvery now and then, you might be lucky enough to catch DD throwing out a cheeky price prediction.\n\nI think ARB goes to near $5-$10\n\n\n\nMid take: But that would put FDV at $100B! And that's absurd if you compare it to Optimism, Polygon, and others.\n\n\n\nI think the ARB price could shock people. \u2014 DeFi Dad \u27e0 defidad.eth \ud83e\udd87\ud83d\udd0a\ud83d\udc3c (@DeFi_Dad) March 21, 2023\n\nWhat do you enjoy on Crypto Twitter?\n\nDD is an unashamed fanboy of Guy Turner, the founder and face of Coin Bureau, whose ethics he admires.\n\n\u201cHe has a team that acts with a lot of integrity, at least in my experience, and they are such great storytellers,\u201d he says.\n\nDD admits he is \u201cdefinitely trying to emulate\u201d what Guy is doing by being very objective and creating content that is \u201cgoing to onboard as many folks in the space as possible.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is a really fine line to ensuring that you don\u2019t compromise on your ethics and become something of a shill.\u201d\n\nTwitter Beef\n\nDD proudly states that he holds no grudges against anyone and jokes that his lack of Crypto Twitter beefs is \u201cnot going to be good for engagement on this article.\u201d\n\nHowever, he doesn\u2019t shy away from throwing some shade every now and then. When crypto exchange FTX collapsed, he didn\u2019t hold back, taking a dig at Sam Trabucco, co-CEO of Alameda Research, calling him a \u201cf*cking terrible trader.\u201d\n\nNo, you didn't \"reach the point in life where I have to prioritize other things.\"\n\n\n\nYou're only ~29 yrs old and worked a job for 3 years.\n\n\n\nYou misused customer deposits from FTX, lost 11 figures, and then left before shit hit the fan.\n\n\n\nYou're a liar and a f*cking terrible trader. pic.twitter.com/XVOGwUQOmD \u2014 DeFi Dad \u27e0 defidad.eth \ud83e\udd87\ud83d\udd0a\ud83d\udc3c (@DeFi_Dad) November 11, 2022\n\nWhile he\u2019s a fan of healthy debates to keep people informed, he tends to avoid confrontation.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like being in conflict with people; I\u2019d rather be more of a cheerleader for these different DeFi protocols,\u201d he says.\n\nHe also tries to rally the troops following negative events, like the collapse of FTX, telling his followers that \u201ccrypto is so much bigger than FTX.\u201d\n\nCan we stop saying today was the worst day in crypto history?\n\n\n\nCrypto is so much bigger than FTX\n\n\n\nCrypto is trustless\n\n\n\nCrypto is permissionless\n\n\n\nCrypto is decentralized\n\n\n\nFTX and Alameda were none of this\n\n\n\nSo good riddance\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s get back to crypto\n\n\n\nOnward and upward\n\n\n\n\ud83d\ude80 \u2014 DeFi Dad \u27e0 defidad.eth \ud83e\udd87\ud83d\udd0a\ud83d\udc3c (@DeFi_Dad) November 9, 2022\n\nPredictions?\n\nDespite being a man who steers clear of making price predictions, DD has confidence that Bitcoin\u2019s price will skyrocket in the next decade, declaring:\n\n\u201cI would be shocked if Bitcoin doesn\u2019t go to $500,000, to a million, in the next 10 years.\u201d\n\nBut as a DeFi Dad, it\u2019s probably unsurprising that his big love is Ethereum.\n\n\u201cTo me, Ethereum is just woefully undervalued because of all the economic activity built on it,\u201d he says.\n\nHe even likens Ethereum to the network effects and moats of Customer Relationship management platforms Salesforce and Marketo.\n\n\u201cPeople use [Salesforce] as a database of all their contacts and all of the deal flow that they\u2019re tracking,\u201d believing that it hooks people in by seamlessly integrating with their business operations.\n\n\u201cIf you track all of your contacts and all of your sales data in it, that\u2019s going to be very difficult to migrate away from and use a different software in the world,\u201d DD says.\n\nHe compares this to Ethereum, saying that the more time is invested and \u201cresources and data put into Ethereum, the more powerful it becomes over time.\u201d\n\nAs for Ether\u2019s price, DD states that $10,000 \u201cis a conservative [price for Ether] at this point.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt could go to $20,000 to $30,000 easily.\u201d\n\nDD takes pleasure in shooting down those who underestimate the price potential of Ethereum.\n\nWhat FUD campaign is this @BanklessHQ?\n\n\n\nIs this an $ETH price for ants? pic.twitter.com/qasmZsxS6s \u2014 DeFi Dad \u27e0 defidad.eth \ud83e\udd87\ud83d\udd0a\ud83d\udc3c (@DeFi_Dad) November 3, 2022"
