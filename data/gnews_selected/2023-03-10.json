If $ETH would be worth same as ChatGPT parent OpenAi it would put price of $ETH around $350. \u2014 Citron Research (@CitronResearch) March 10, 2023\n\nAs KuCoin is accused of selling unregistered securites, Ethereum (ETH) is one of them. Citron Research stressed that the security status of Ether (ETH) bacame even more obvious as the network migrated to proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus and replaced mining by staking.\n\nEthereum (ETH) failed to deliver on its promises of a \"decentralized network,\" researchers say. Instead, it become a full-fledged investment vehicle and should, therefore, be taxed and regulated accordingly.\n\nAs such, Ethereum (ETH) could better be compared to corporations, not to \"alternative\" systems like Bitcoin (BTC). Should one compare Ethereum (ETH) and OpenAI, a U.S.-based ChatGPT creator, by approximate market capitalization, Ethereum (ETH) would be valued at about $350.\n\nEthereum (ETH) is changing hands at $1,401 by press time. Should Citron Research be right about its prospects, it would be on the eve of a 75% price plunge.\n\nAs covered by U.Today previously, Citron Research is an adamant critic of cryptocurrencies: they slammed Ethereum (ETH) in 2022 and compared it to collapsed exchange FTX. Also, it bashed Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), one of the most overhyped investment tools of the previous bull run.\n\nEthereum (ETH) or OpenAI, Lululemon, Chipotle and Twitter?\n\nWhen regulators investigate the internal processes of Etheruem (ETH), they will find an ordinary \"ICO,\" not \"smart contracts,\" the skeptics added:\n\nWhen the AG opens the Ethereum Network kimono we expect the secrets of the to be just as bad as any shadowy organization with: self dealings, shady ICO transactions, multiple attempts to avoid federal laws of taxation and securities, all while being controlled by a small group of people under a guise of decentralization.\n\nAlso, recent charity initiatives by Vitalik Buterin look suspicious to Citron Research: they might cover tax evasion and look too similar to FTX's patented \"effective altruism.\"\n\nIn order to demonstrate how absurd Ethereum's (ETH) current market capitalization is, Citron Research stressed that it is bigger than the market caps of OpenAI, Lululemon, Twitter and Chipotle combined, or as large as Disney."

        "content": "Neeraj Agrawal, the Director of Communications at Coin Center, disagreed with the New York Attorney General\u2019s (NYAG) recent assessment of Ethereum as a security.\n\n\u201cCoin Center will be monitoring the case and if there\u2019s an opportunity to weigh in, we will.\u201d\n\nIn support of this view, Agrawal linked a 2018 article arguing that there is a difference between \u201ca token pre-sale and the token itself.\u201d\n\nApplicable securities laws use the Howey Test to determine whether a contract, scheme, or transaction meets the definition of a security. It focuses on resolving if investors paid money in a common enterprise with the expectation of profits from the efforts of others.\n\nAlthough these rules date back to the 1930s, before computers and digital assets, specific cryptocurrencies and Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) (or token pre-sales) have met the definition of an investment contract, according to regulators.\n\nNYAG says Ethereum is a security\n\nOn March 9, the NYAG, Letitia James, filed a lawsuit against Seychelles-based exchange KuCoin, citing concerns over \u201cfalsely representing itself as an exchange.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s action is the latest in our efforts to rein in shadowy cryptocurrency companies and bring order to the industry.\u201d\n\nJames said she could trade cryptocurrencies on the exchange in New York, yet the entity was not registered in the state. Furthermore, the AG added that users could buy and sell \u201cpopular virtual currencies, including ETH, LUNA, and TerraUSD (UST), which are securities and commodities.\u201d\n\nAlthough the principal theme of the lawsuit centered on KuCoin operating illegally in New York, James categorically called out the trading of securities on the platform as a basis for operating illegally, not just failure to register.\n\nThis paves the way for Ethereum\u2019s U.S. securities status to be determined in a court of law.\n\n\u201cThis action is one of the first times a regulator is claiming in court that ETH, one of the largest cryptocurrencies available, is a security.\u201d\n\nThe crypto community chimes in\n\nLawyer Jake Chervinsky dismissed James\u2019 claims about Ethereum, saying the enforcement action is simply an unfounded allegation, albeit an allegation from a regulator.\n\n\u201cAgencies are like any other plaintiff: they can write whatever they want in a complaint. It may get some press, but it doesn\u2019t change a thing.\u201c\n\nSimilarly, Messari founder Ryan Selkis echoed Chervinsky\u2019s comments, saying, \u201cETH is not a security.\u201d However, Selkis did not provide his reasoning, only hinting at a coordinated attack against crypto, saying, \u201cthe administrative state is completely out of control.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, as expected, Bitcoin maximalist Max Keiser opposed the previous consensus, praising regulators for \u201cfinally doing their job.\u201d\n\n\u201cETH is obviously a security. Now the regulators are finally doing their job. Shut this sh**show down, Gary!!!\u201c\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "title": "Why Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana Are Crashing Today - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "What happened\n\nCryptocurrencies have had a rough couple of days as word spread that the influential Silicon Valley Bank, which trades under SVB Financial Group (SIVB.Q 8361.54%), is facing a liquidity crisis. While this isn't directly a hit to crypto, many venture capital firms use Silicon Valley Bank, so there's a risk of a broader financial impact, which is why cryptocurrencies are down Friday.\n\nAs of 10:30 a.m. ET, Bitcoin (BTC 0.90%) had fallen by 8.5% over the prior 24 hours, Ethereum (ETH 1.41%) had fallen 8.8%, and Solana (SOL -1.36%) was down 5.7%. Looking further back, over the past seven days, those cryptocurrencies are down 11.2%, 10.7%, and 18.5% respectively.\n\nSo what\n\nThe two major events of the past week have been the collapse of Silvergate Capital and the potential collapse of Silicon Valley Bank. Silvergate provided a direct gateway into cryptocurrencies for many wealthy investors and institutions, and even operates many publicly traded funds. But it was seen as a more crypto-specific bank.\n\nThis week's bank run on Silicon Valley Bank is more concerning for the broader tech ecosystem. It is used by many start-ups and provides services small companies need in order to scale their businesses quickly.\n\nContagion, or cascading risks from one entity to another, is the biggest fear here. That could lead to less lending and investors pulling back their investments. Silicon Valley's venture capital firms provide the fuel for the tech ecosystem, and anything that impacts them could impact a lot of smaller start-ups.\n\nAs far as crypto goes, dozens of blockchain start-ups have been funded by venture capitalists in Silicon Valley. If they face pressure from regulators, banks and ultimately, investors, they may not be able to build the tools and services that are intended to make cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana more useful, and thus more valuable.\n\nIn short, these ecosystems are intertwined, and the fear this week is that a collapse of Silicon Valley Bank will make this crypto winter even worse.\n\nNow what\n\nThe risk to financial institutions can't be understated because they're critical to making the financial system work. When lending pulls back all at once or there's a credit crisis, there can be an economywide impact, as we saw in 2008 and 2009.\n\nThe Labor Department's February jobs report Friday morning did provide some positive news. The U.S. economy added 311,000 non-farm jobs last month, but more people entered the workforce to seek jobs, so the unemployment rate rose to 3.6%. So far, the tech sector slowdown, the crypto collapse, and the downfall of some banks haven't spilled over to the broader economy.\n\nInvestors with a long-term view should start looking at this as a buying opportunity for high-quality cryptocurrencies. Despite the downturn in token values, the crypto industry continues to grow and innovate, which is ultimately what's going to drive value.\n\nI don't know if we are at or even near the bottom, but I am betting on innovation in the blockchain winning in the long term. The Ethereum and Solana blockchains are where most developers are building, and that's where I'm looking to be a buyer if this crash gets worse."

        "title": "Next stop Shanghai \u2014 Ethereum's latest milestone approaches - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The Ethereum ecosystem will continue its ongoing metamorphosis as the highly anticipated Shanghai upgrade draws near. The latest preeminent smart contract blockchain protocol improvement will activate Ether (ETH) withdrawals from Ethereum\u2019s Beacon Chain.\n\nThe Merge marked a significant milestone for the Ethereum network in 2022, with the blockchain platform shifting from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake consensus. That change introduced validators as the new \u201cminers\u201d of the network, with staking ETH becoming a key component in maintaining the network.\n\nWhile full validators were required to stake 32 ETH to process transactions and add new blocks to the network, the broader ecosystem could stake smaller amounts of ETH to earn a share of rewards \u2014 much like an investor that puts capital into interest-bearing accounts.\n\nThose that locked up ETH to become validators have been unable to withdraw their staked holdings from the Beacon Chain. This changes with the Shanghai upgrade, and is a major reason for the increased fanfare around the latest change to the Ethereum network.\n\nThe Shanghai upgrade features a handful of Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) in addition to activating staking withdrawals. Cointelegraph reached out to members of the ConsenSys team, the Ethereum Foundation and analytics firm Nansen to unpack all aspects of the upcoming milestone.\n\nCapella x Shanghai = Shapella\n\nThe upcoming changes feature two simultaneous upgrades amalgamated to encompass all facets of the upgrade.\n\nShanghai refers to changes to Ethereum\u2019s execution layer, mainly enabling staked ETH to be deposited to execution layer wallets. The Shanghai upgrade requires a simultaneous change to the Beacon Chain, which has been dubbed Capella.\n\nJustin Florentine, a staff protocol engineer for Hyperledger Besu at ConsenSys, further explained the combined upgrades at the execution and consensus layers:\n\n\u201cIt is doubly named because it is the first simultaneous upgrade of Ethereum\u2019s execution layer and consensus layer, and is highly anticipated because it will enable staked ETH withdrawals.\u201d\n\nWithin the Ethereum ecosystem, execution layer upgrades are named after cities that have hosted Devcon events, while consensus layer upgrades are named after stars. Therefore the upcoming upgrade\u2019s technical name is Shapella, combining Shanghai and Capella.\n\nNevertheless, given the focus on activating staked ETH withdrawals, the wider cryptocurrency ecosystem refers to the looming upgrade as Shanghai. As Beiko explained, Shanghai closes an important chapter in Ethereum\u2019s evolution:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s better to think of Shanghai as \u2018finishing the Merge\u2019 than related to future upgrades. We didn\u2019t introduce withdrawals during the Merge because that upgrade was already the most complex in Ethereum\u2019s history.\u201d\n\nShanghai in a nutshell\n\nAs has been highlighted by several analysts and Ethereum developers, Shanghai features five EIPs. EIP-4895 will enable users to withdraw from the Ethereum staking contract, which had previously been locked.\n\nReward payments will be sent automatically to withdrawal addresses at regular intervals to validators. Users also have the option to exit staking entirely, which will return their entire validator balance.\n\nEthereum's Shanghai upgrade will unlock 17.6M ETH or over $28 billion. https://t.co/qt8K4Zn55y \u2014 Cointelegraph (@Cointelegraph) March 2, 2023\n\nValidator balances are maxed out at 32 ETH, meaning that balances above this threshold as a result of rewards do not contribute to the principal amount nor increase the weight of a validator on the network.\n\nEIP-3651, EIP-3855, EIP-3860 and EIP-6049 are the other four elements of the network upgrade. Matt Nelson, Hyperledger Besu and Web3 senior product manager at ConsenSys, highlighted the impact of each of these EIPs.\n\nThe Ethereum protocol prices gas based on how many units of work a function will require of a computer in the network. Changes to Ethereum\u2019s gas costs often adjust to correct overpriced or underpriced operations that have central processing units doing more or less work than anticipated. Warm coinbase (3651), PUSH0 (3855) and the initcode changes (3860) are part of these corrections, according to Nelson.\n\nEIP-3651 changes the price of accessing the coinbase address of a validator that submits and executes transactions. Validators receive fees to their coinbase address for maintaining the network. As Nelson summarized, EIP-3651 looks to lower the gas cost of accessing a coinbase address so that users that submit transactions can pay the validators directly in specific conditions:\n\n\u201cRegardless, this EIP corrects a previous oversight on the cost to access the coinbase address and gives some added benefits to users and developers that open up new use cases.\u201d\n\nEIP-3860 will have a similar effect. Developers submit initcode to the network when deploying a new smart contract. When the initcode is executed, a smart contract \u201cbytecode\u201d is created on-chain, running each time the contract is called, and also runs decentralized applications (DApps).\n\nMetering initcode intends to correct the gas cost required for network nodes to process and deploy the smart contracts specified in the initcode. Validating nodes currently check that contracts are valid on deployment, which costs time and gas to complete, which the initcode EIP aims to improve as Nelson explained:\n\n\u201cEIP-3860 applies a new cost to the initcode that scales in correlation to the size of the \u2018initcode\u2019 to ensure handling that contract creation is costed appropriately.\u201d\n\nLastly, EIP-3855 carries out a \u201cstraightforward and simple change\u201d to the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and gas costing. The current state of the EVM does not store a value of zero on the execution stack cheaply, with developers having to use the \u201cexpensive\u201d PUSH1 operation to set a value to zero.\n\nNelson highlighted that gas costs are directly linked to storage space in this instance, meaning the EVM only needs 1 byte to store a single zero, while more than 1 byte is required to store a bigger number from the PUSH1 operation:\n\n\u201cThis change creates a new PUSH0 opcode, which is cost for 1 byte of data storage (less than PUSH1), and will bring gas costs for developers (and ultimately users) down.\u201d\n\nBeiko also reiterated that Ethereum Virtual Machine object format EIPs initially included in the Shanghai upgrade have been removed from the event.\n\nWhat to expect\n\nThe effect of the Shanghai upgrade on cryptocurrency markets and the value of ETH is another pertinent question that is perhaps more difficult to answer.\n\nMichiel Milanovic, a DeFi market analyst at ConsenSys, weighed in on the anticipated effects that Shanghai will have in terms of market supply and value of ETH after the upgrade. Milanovic noted that validators are broadly categorized as short-term or long-term, with the current market split roughly 40/60 respectively, which allows for some simple predictions to be made:\n\n\u201cWe see potential for an increase in the supply of ETH in circulation from long-term validators who are eager to withdraw their accumulated rewards.\u201d\n\nMilanovic also highlighted that the mechanics of withdrawals are engineered with a limit of 16 withdrawals per block and prioritizes short-term validators. The likely outcome is that any market impact from long-term validators will be gradual.\n\nMeanwhile, short-term validators are mostly run by liquid staking providers (LSPs), which are more incentivized to use rewards to spin up new validators. Milanovic said this is mainly due to an expected increased demand once withdrawals are enabled, as it reduces the liquidity risk of staking ETH.\n\n\u201cWe also expect to see more staked ETH tokens issued by these providers to be used across DeFi, which has so far been fairly limited.\u201d\n\nAndrew Thurman, an analyst at blockchain analytics platform Nansen, told Cointelegraph that the upgrade would have significant ramifications for supply flows and price of ETH, given that staking creates fundamental changes to Ethereum\u2019s market structure:\n\n\u201cSome believe that a successful network upgrade will spur more deposits, which would lead to bullish market activity. Others, meanwhile, believe that large portions of the staked ETH supply \u2014 now in excess of 17.5 million ETH \u2014 will be withdrawn and sold.\u201d\n\nSimon Dudley, a ConsenSys senior blockchain protocol engineer, summed up a shift in focus for the Shanghai upgrade to prioritize validator withdrawals. This meant that the implementation of certain EIPs was shifted further down the timeline to limit risks of further delays to the upcoming upgrade:\n\n\u201cFor this reason, there was a strong desire among the core developers to prevent the Shanghai upgrade from becoming overly complicated.\u201d\n\nSeveral of these EIPs have been pushed back to the Cancun upgrade, which will follow Shanghai later in 2023. This includes improvements that will lay the foundation for sharding, namely \u201cProto-Danksharding\u201d EIP-4844.\n\nDudley noted that Shanghai intentionally excluded foundational sharding work, but work on EIP-4844 has continued in parallel. He also concedes that the deployment of Shanghai may well influence the ongoing work on sharding in the months to come:\n\n\u201cShipping the Shanghai upgrade may have an impact on sharding because it frees up developers who were working on Shanghai to focus on the more complicated series of sharding upgrades, known as \u2018The Surge.\u2018\u201d\n\nThe Shanghai upgrade is scheduled to take place on the Ethereum mainnet in early April. The original date was pushed out from March 2023, with the Goerli test network \u2014 which allows for development testing before mainnet deployments \u2014 carrying out the Shapella upgrade on March 14."
