Check out the Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nStaking becomes lucrative\n\nUsers have shown significant interest in ETH staking since the Shapella Upgrade went live on the mainnet in April. As the ambiguity surrounding withdrawals was put to rest, people got more confidence in restaking their ETH.\n\nThis resulted in a sharp spike in the number of ETH staked with deposits consistently outpacing withdrawals over the last two months. At the time of publication, the total amount locked accounted for 16.7% of ETH\u2019s total circulating supply, as per a Nansen dashboard.\n\nOn the other hand, the supply on exchanges, i.e. liquid supply, has steadily dropped in the same time period. As per the information provided in the aforementioned tweet, the exchange supply fell to 23.5 million from about 28 million at the start of April.\n\nThis equated to 19% of the ETH\u2019s total circulating supply of 120.2 million, according to CoinMarketCap.\n\nThe convergence underlined that people were taking ETH out of the market and using it as an investment to earn yields. And even though staking rewards have progressively reduced over the past two years, people have preferred utilizing ETH as a savings option, as per a recent report by CoinShares.\n\nETH slips below $1900 after rally\n\nETH failed to hold its gains as it slipped below $1900 to trade at $1,885.59 at the time of writing, according to data from Santiment. It remained to be seen how sustainable the rally of 21 June would prove to be.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nHowever, the spike boosted the overall profitability of the network. The 30-Day MVRV Ratio stormed into the positive territory after a gap of two weeks, suggesting that ETH holders, on average, would make profits if they were to sell their holdings.\n\nAnd while the long-term holders reacted to the price rise as indicated by the hike in the Age Consumed metric on 21 June, the subsequent decline dampened their enthusiasm."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nIllustration by Mitchell Preffer for Decrypt.\n\nThe recovery that began last week\u2014after U.S. inflation appeared to cool\u2014hit its stride this week as markets continued to reverberate from the bombshell of the world\u2019s largest asset manager, BlackRock, filing an application to the SEC for a Bitcoin spot Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF).\n\nDozens of companies apply for ETFs, and dozens have been rejected. To date, not a single Bitcoin spot ETF has been approved by the crypto-skeptic SEC, despite the fact that Canadian regulators have approved many of them.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe stakes are high: a spot ETF would offer investors the chance to buy into Bitcoin and either ride the gravy train or go to hell in a hand basket, but if the latter, they\u2019ll be safe in the knowledge that their investment is protected, unlike those who purchase and store crypto directly.\n\nIf anybody has a chance of getting an ETF approved, it\u2019s BlackRock. The firm boasts an incredible $9 trillion in assets under management and has a winning score of 575-1 when it comes to getting an ETF approved by the SEC.\n\nThe news inspired two more U.S. asset managers, WisdomTree and Invesco, which have both previously applied for their own ETFs\u2014to file fresh ETF applications this week. Valkyrie followed suit shortly after.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETC) both surged this week. The world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency shot up 18% to its current price of $30,687, while the biggest runner up rallied 12.7% to trade at $1,893 at the start of the weekend.\n\nInvestors flooded into other cryptocurrencies this week as well. In fact, most of the top thirty cryptocurrencies by market cap shot up by double-digit percentages. There were no losses among the major unbacked coins.\n\nBitcoin fork Bitcoin Cash (BCH) ballooned a staggering 80.5% over the last seven days and currently trades for $192.90.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRegulation and expansion\n\nWhile all eyes were on the SEC and big asset managers this week, there were a couple of other stories that indicated the steady adoption of crypto is continuing around the world.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, a central bank digital currency (CBDC) trial project backed by the Bank of England published its findings, concluding that a centrally-issued sterling-pegged digital currency could \u201cenable a robust ecosystem to foster innovation, and to help meet the future needs of a more digitalised society.\u201d\n\nThe project\u2014dubbed Project Rosalind\u2014emphasized the programmability of crypto through smart contracts, which facilitate automatic payments and enable new kinds of online transactions.\n\nOn Monday, British parliamentarians in the House of Lords (upper chamber) voted through the Financial Services and Markets Bill, a piece of legislation that proposes regulation for stablecoins, crypto and crypto promotion.\n\nThe bill has already passed the House of Commons and has made it through to the final stages: the Consideration of Amendments, where both chambers debate the proposals and tighten the screws until they both agree. The final stage requires a signature from King Charlie himself.\n\nIt was reported on Tuesday that Germany\u2019s largest bank, Deutsche Bank, applied for a digital asset custody platform license with the German finance regulator, the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin).\n\nDuring a semiannual hearing on monetary policy held by the Republican-led House Financial Services Committee and led by Patrick McHenry (R-NC) on Wednesday, Fed chair Jerome Powell said the U.S. central bank should play a \u201crobust federal role\u201d in crypto regulation and added that Bitcoin has \u201cstaying power\u201d while implying the same about stablecoins.\n\nFinally, XRP progenitor Ripple was granted an in-principle payments license in Singapore. Ripple has long felt heat from U.S. regulators. A lawsuit against it by the SEC has been ongoing since 2020 and, like Coinbase, the company is now hedging its bets through global expansion.\n\nAD\n\nAD"

The pair has recorded higher lows since November 2022, with the $1,900-$2,000 level acting as technical and psychological resistance levels, according to the ascending triangle pattern.\n\nA breakout above $2,000 could quickly propel ETH toward the 2022 breakdown levels of around $3,000. The targets of the bullish ascending channel pattern also coincide around these levels.\n\nETH/USD daily price chart.

If sellers push the price below this level, bearish targets of 0.05689 BTC would get exposed.\n\nNevertheless, the relative strength index metric is showing oversold readings for the ETH/BTC pair, suggesting that a pullback is likely.\n\nETH/BTC daily price chart.

        "title": "ERC 6551 Ethereum Standard Changes Game in Ethereum NFTs: Guide - U.Today",
        "content": "Advertisement\n\nThe launch of ERC 6551 or Token Bound Accounts (TBAs) is arguably the most impressive addition to Ethereum's (ETH) open-source stack in the segment of NFTs since the onset of ERC-721, a mainstream digital collectible standard.\n\nOnce it reaches massive adoption, it can change the narrative in the usage, economics and functionality of NFTs on Ethereum (ETH) and EVM ecosystem blockchains.\n\nERC 6551 or Token Bound Accounts: Highlights\n\nERC 6551, dubbed \"Non-fungible Token Bound Accounts. An interface and registry for smart contract accounts owned by ERC 721 tokens,\" was launched on May 7, 2023.\n\nERC 6551 is a standard of Ethereum (ETH) non-fungible tokens that can act as noncustodial wallets of Ethereum (ETH) accounts;\n\nERC 6551 allows every ERC 721 token to achieve all the functionalities of a cryptocurrency wallet: sending/receiving transactions, storing its own NFTs, participating in airdrops and so on;\n\nERC 6551 standard is backward-compatible: it can equip every existing non-fungible token with advanced functionality;\n\nNew standard is authored by CryptoKitties co-creator Jayden Windle and Benny Giang of Future Primitive;\n\nERC 6551-enabled NFTs can be used in decentralized gaming, reputation management, on-chain messaging, analytics, trading and so on.\n\nFrom the very beginning, the standard has been developed in an open-source manner. However, its authors stressed that some Web3 companies are already working on instruments designed to make the \"upgrading\" of NFTs easier.\n\nWhat are NFTs?\n\nNon-fungible tokens, or NFTs, represent the type of cryptocurrency token with some unique features. While basically all cryptocurrency tokens (just like fiat currencies) are fungible \u2014 e.g. you can always replace 1 USDT with 1 USDT, 1 BTC with 1 BTC \u2014 every NFT is a unique token.\n\nUnder the hood, NFTs should be considered as contracts regarding ownership of some content. Should we check out the code of the majority of NFTs, we can find that they are tokenized agreements: \"This is to certify that Ethereum account 0xabcd\u2026owns the file Azuki4771.jpg starting from the block 123456.\" As such, most NFTs can be interpreted as tokenized digital property rights.\n\nUsers typically mint NFTs associated with digital content: images, texts, songs, videos, characters and in-game assets.\n\nWhat is ERC 721?\n\nEthereum Request for Comments 721, or ERC 721, is a standard on the Ethereum blockchain, i.e., the standardized design of non-fungible tokens. Introduced in December 2017, this format paved the way for standard NFTs: developers are able to launch them in a streamlined manner.\n\nOn the other hand, ERC 721 is a sample of a smart contract, i.e., a code template that describes basic NFT functionality. All mainstream NFT collections \u2014 Bored Ape Yacht Club, Azuki, RTFKT \u2014 include ERC 721 tokens. Also, it is a backbone element of the tooling of all of the top NFT marketplaces: OpenSea, LooksRare, Rarible, Blur and so on.\n\nHow to create NFTs?\n\nBasically, there are two ways to create non-fungible tokens yourself. First, you can try using no-code instruments like Mintable. With them, users can just upload their content, pay gas fees and get their NFTs minted. On some L2 chains, NFTs can even be minted in a gasless manner.\n\nThen, NFTs can be created with OpenZeppelin code templates. To create a token this way, the user needs to set up a MetaMask wallet, pay fees (or claim testnet tokens from the faucet), take the ERC 721 code template, compile it and deploy it to the network \u2014 either Ethereum or Polygon.\n\nWhat are Ordinals Bitcoin NFTs?\n\nWhile, typically, NFTs are associated with programmable blockchains (that support smart contracts), in 2023, the hype around \"Bitcoin NFTs\" \u2014 also known as \"Inscriptions\" or \"Ordinals\" \u2014 gained steam.\n\nOrdinals is a technology that allows attaching data to Bitcoin (BTC) transactions. As satoshis in Bitcoin (BTC) can be modified, users can equip them with content, from .jpeg files to JSON data.\n\nHowever, this standard cannot go mainstream as it is technically sophisticated: to create Ordinals, you need to run a full Bitcoin (BTC) node. Also, the activity of Ordinals creators made the Bitcoin (BTC) network almost unusable.\n\nWhat is Account Abstraction?\n\nAccount Abstraction, or ERC 4337, is a technology that allows Ethereum (ETH) wallets to act like decentralized banks. It blurs the line between wallets and smart contracts and paves the way for a new type of entity in Ethereum and EVM compatible blockchains, i.e., \"smart wallets.\"\n\nAccount Abstraction was introduced in early 2023 and is usually described as the \"next big thing\" in Ethereum (ETH) functionality.\n\nVitalik Buterin described this concept as one of the three pillars of Ethereum's (ETH) progress in its transition toward a mature tech stack.\n\nERC 6551 or Token Bound Accounts: First comprehensive guide\n\nERC 6551 is a novel mechanism in the Ethereum (ETH) segment. It allows NFTs to be equipped with an additional layer of wallet functionality.\n\nERC 6551: Basics\n\nERC 6551 is a protocol that makes \"regular\" NFTs on Ethereum (ETH) and other EVM blockchains act like \"smart contract wallets,\" i.e., to perform all actions that are normal for noncustodial crypto wallets. That said, it allows ERC 721 NFTs to receive and send transactions, to store their own NFTs, to swap ERC 20 tokens and so on. ERC 6551-enabled tokens are called \"token-bound accounts,\" or TBAs.\n\nImage by TokenBound\n\nERC 6551 was proposed in early 2023 by Ethereum (ETH) veterans Benny Giang, co-author of ERC 721 standard and co-creator of CryptoKitties, and Jayden Windle, lead software developer at Future Primitive. In February 2023, it was published as an EIP on Ethereum Foundation forum while, on May 7, 2023, it was activated in mainnet.\n\nThe standard is fully open source and is subject to active discussion in the Ethereum (ETH) community. ERC 6551 is backward compatible; every existing NFT can be turned into TBA. Support for ERC 6551-enabled tokens has already been researched by OpenSea and a number of other blue-chip NFT institutions.\n\nERC 6551: Tech design\n\nTechnically, ERC 6551 is an adjustment to ERC 721, the most common standard for Ethereum's NFTs. \"Regular\" ERC 721/ERC 1155 NFTs contain just three types of entries, including the address of the NFT owner, the address of the person who can transfer the NFT and the characteristics of the associated metadata (content).\n\nImage by Ethereum Foundation\n\nAs such, the functions of NFTs are limited: they only can be transferred among Ethereum (ETH) addresses. However, should we use \"registries\" and \"proxies\" (other types of smart contracts), we can map a certain NFT to a standard Ethereum smart contract address (say, BAYC 1234 to 0xabcd..).\n\nNFT researcher and contributor to ERC721A standard 0xCygaar highlights that ERC 6551-enabled NFTs can control an unlimited number of crypto wallets:\n\nA single NFT may control more than one contract account, however, each contract account only belongs to a single NFT.\n\nOnce this mapping happens, NFT-bound wallets become smart contracts. Not unlike multi-sigs, the owner of a smart contract can authorize a transaction by the executeCall command on the wallet.\n\nERC 6551: Possible implementations\n\nAs ERC 6551 NFTs become regular crypto wallets \u2014 but without losing their NFT-specific features \u2014 they have a lot of use cases in Web3 and classic economics.\n\nFor instance, thanks to impressive composability opportunities, all NFTs can be mapped to a single ERC 6551 NFT with his avatar. In a similar manner, a Web3 gamer can collect his/her in-game assets to streamline their display and usage. The entire procedure becomes user friendly and transparent. Everyone is able to track the true history of this or that NFT, which removes the possibility for cheating and selling stolen NFTs.\n\nThen, ERC 6551 NFTs can interact with DeFis, trading bots and marketplaces without revealing the identity and core wallet of their holders. This significantly increases the anonymity and security of the NFT experience.\n\nEven more impressive opportunities are unlocked in the \"real-world\" economic context. For instance, here's how NFTs of new standards can be used in the tourism segment to create a holistic travel experience.\n\nTravel experiences thanks to NFT technology pic.twitter.com/q3R9hYM18Z \u2014 Andrei (@andreiponi) May 31, 2023\n\nHere's how ERC 6551 tokens can be used even by customers with no previous cryptocurrency experience.\n\nERC 6551: How can you benefit?\n\nAs an average user of cryptocurrency, you can benefit from starting to work with ERC 6551 tokens in multiple ways:\n\nFor gamers: With the new standard, you can create a collection of your in-game assets and map it to a single NFT somehow associated with your profile (with an avatar, personal name and so on); this will make your reputation and status more visible;\n\nFor NFT collectors: With ERC 6551, you can apply the \"don't trust, verify\" rule to your experience with buying NFTs as you can see the history of their ownership. Also, you can map your entire collection to a single NFT and exhibit it as such;\n\nFor metaverse enthusiasts: With ERC 6551, you are able to equip your character in this or that metaverse with a more advanced toolkit of \"personal\" features.\n\nAs such, the activation of ERC 6551 paves the way for more immersive, transparent and feature-rich experiences in plenty of Web3 segments for new and existing NFT enthusiasts. It can actually do for NFTs what ERC 4337 or Account Abstraction does for Ethereum (ETH) as a whole.\n\nWrapping up\n\nERC 6551 is an impressive innovation in the Ethereum (ETH) segment. It enriches the tooling of non-fungible tokens with the functions of a regular crypto wallet. Everyone can turn his/her NFTs into \"Token Bound Accounts\" via a newbie-friendly dashboard.\n\nWith ERC 6551, NFTs become as functional as \"smart crypto wallets,\" a new form of cryptocurrency wallet unlocked by the Account Abstraction mechanism. Starting from 2023, the line between NFTs, crypto wallets and smart contracts is blurred."
