        "title": "Ethereum Faces Critical Test At $1,960 As Massive 33 Million ETH Resistance Emerges - ZyCrypto",
        "content": "Advertisement\n\nEthereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has been making significant strides in recent weeks, riding on the wave of positive developments in the crypto industry.\n\nOver the past seven days, Ether has witnessed a remarkable surge of 16%. However, its primary rival, Bitcoin, has outpaced it with a 20% surge during the same period. Notably, this surge saw Ethereum breaking key resistance at $1,745, sparking optimism among investors and analysts.\n\nDespite these gains, Ethereum\u2019s upward momentum is now at a critical juncture. The crypto community is closely monitoring a formidable resistance level at $1,960, which has raised concerns.\n\nOn Thursday, popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez took to Twitter to shed light on this impending challenge, stating, \u201cWhen will Ethereum break out? Well, you may need to wait for $ETH to overcome the huge supply wall at $1,960. Here, 1.14 million addresses bought nearly 33 million ETH, according to data from Into the Block.\u201d\n\nThis said resistance level, often referred to as a \u201cbuy wall,\u201d represents a level where a substantial amount of Ethereum was bought in the past. Investors who bought then may be inclined to sell their Ethereum at this price point, which can act as a significant barrier to further price appreciation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInterestingly, the close correlation between Ethereum and Bitcoin has been evident, where changes in one frequently impact the other. In another tweet, Martinez pointed out that Bitcoin\u2019s potential 5% correction to $33,000, driven by its formation of an ascending triangle on the hourly chart, a move that could trigger a similar selloff in Ethereum.\n\nAdding to Martinez\u2019s views, crypto analyst \u2018Cryptotony\u2019 also presented a bearish perspective on Ethereum, telling his 346,000 X followers that the cryptocurrency might gain momentum and test the $2,500 resistance zone before entering a distribution phase and possibly decline leading up to the next halving event.\n\nAnother analyst, \u2018Cryptonary,\u2019 emphasized the significance of Ethereum\u2019s ongoing test, stating that it was crucial to determine whether the bulls could break through the resistance at $1,960 or if Ethereum would echo Bitcoin\u2019s overbought signals.\n\nNotably, the pundit\u2019s technical analysis revealed that Ethereum had been oscillating between support at $1,745 and resistance at $1,823-$1,853, with no clear breakout yet. Additionally, he noted that the daily Relative Strength Index (RSI) was overbought but not as extended as Bitcoin\u2019s.\n\nThat said, as Ethereum faces a pivotal moment along the $1,960 resistance level, the outcome of this test will determine whether Ethereum can continue its recent bullish trend, plunge or face a period of consolidation.\n\nEther was trading at $1,796 at press time after a 0.32% increase over the past 24 hours."

        "content": "Ethereum client developers confirmed on Thursday that the anticipated Dencun upgrade will not be implemented in a network hard fork before the end of 2023.\n\nAlready last month, when the new Hole\u0161ky testnet was successfully launched behind schedule, the consensus was that putting the upgrade through its paces by the time December holidays rolled around was unlikely.\n\nWhen an optimistic scenario was put forward on today\u2019s All Core Developers call, the consensus was evidently with pseudonymous Prysm developer Potuz, who commented, \u201cthere is no way we are forking mainnet in 2023.\u201d\n\nHe pointed to consistent consensus issues arising on the 10 developer networks (devnets) that have been spun up so far to test the upgrade over the past few months, adding that \u201cnot a single one went well.\u201d\n\nRead more: Devnet, testnet, mainnet: Ethereum\u2019s next upgrade progresses \u2014 slowly\n\nEthereum clients are divided into two main camps, one for the execution layer and the other the consensus layer, with the distinction reflected in the name of the upgrade \u2014 consensus teams use cities where Ethereum\u2019s major conference, Devcon, has been held (e.g. Cancun), while execution client developers opt for star names (e.g. Deneb) \u2014 hence \u201cDencun.\u201d\n\nIn contrast to the consensus teams, execution layer client teams reported being in good shape for the upcoming testnets.\n\n\u201cWe are in a pretty good place, a lot of things are also on Master now,\u201d said Geth developer known as Lightclient, referring to the Go Ethereum project\u2019s digital workspace where the code, files, and revision history are stored.\n\nDevnet 10 was launched this week, with plans for the execution clients to transition to a larger test on the Goerli testnet. But Prysm\u2019s Potuz is not on board with that idea.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m definitely not comfortable at all having a full client fork on Goerli,\u201d he said. \u201cI see very large and deep changes still being pushed in the branch,\u201d he added regarding Prysm, the software currently runs 45% of the consensus layer clients.\n\nA smaller Devnet 11 is planned, but it now appears the move to testnets will be put off until after Ethereum\u2019s Devconnect developer conference, which will be held in Istanbul in mid-November.\n\nCelebrating the KZG ceremony\n\nThe Dencun upgrade required a bit of fancy cryptography to ensure the Ethereum scaling improvement, known as Proto-Danksharding, a key feature, remains secure.\n\nThe KZG Ceremony involved multiple participants, each concocting a secret and performing a computation to blend it with preceding contributions. This process results in the formation of a \u201cstructured reference string\u201d (SRS), which is crucial for the KZG Commitments cryptographic scheme, and integral to Proto-Danksharding.\n\nThe final outcome of this chain of contributions is then put into the upgrade. The whole setup remains secure so long as there is at least one honest participant in the ceremony. After months of soliciting contributions, a total of 141,416 makes that all but certain.\n\nCarl Beekhuizen, who coordinated the ceremony for the Ethereum Foundation, invited participants to verify that their contributions are, in fact, included, by visiting ceremony.ethereum.org.\n\nThere, one can input a contributing wallet address, and receive a commemorative POAP NFT.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."
