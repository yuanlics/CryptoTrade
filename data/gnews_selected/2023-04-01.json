However, they remained far behind Ethereum. Meanwhile, as Ethereum ramps up preparations to enable staked Ether [stETH] withdrawal, traders seem to get involved in taking ETH positions.\n\nNot a question of \u201cOptions\u201d\n\nAccording to Glassnode, the options Open Interest (OI) across all exchanges had been increasing since 24 March. The options OI reveals the total amount of funds dedicated to opening options contracts.\n\nAnd, at press time, the metric was $7.56 billion. This indicated that traders are increasingly forecasting which direction ETH will head given the blockchain\u2019s forthcoming upgrade.\n\nFurthermore, the Ethereum fear and greed index was 61 out of a possible 100, at the time of writing. The indicator uses price volatility, market volume, and social trend data to assess if an asset is at a fair price.\n\nEthereum Fear and Greed Index is 61 \u2013 Greed\n\nCurrent price: $1,792https://t.co/w9g6chjUEShttps://t.co/9mfbj9d3uH pic.twitter.com/4be0oO6UxM \u2014 Ethereum Fear and Greed Index (@EthereumFear) March 31, 2023\n\nSo, the current condition implies that market mentions do not see a buying opportunity. Similarly, the sentiment does not expect a notable correction in the short term.\n\nHowever, institutions who trade Over The Counter (OTC) contracts seem not to share the same perceptions with the overall derivatives market. According to the CME Group, ETH\u2019s futures OI was down to 4,246 while the volume increased to 5,103 ETH.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ETHs worth today?\n\nThe goal is to keep providing\n\nEither way, predicting ETH\u2019s price action around developments like this remains a dicey decision. In times past like the year of the Merge, several long positions were open. But unfortunately, most liquidated as the ETH price plunged.\n\nMoreover, the number of ETH 2.0 deposit contracts by staking providers had reached new peaks via different networks and exchanges. And, as expected Lido Finance [LDO] edged out every other protocol while Binance dominated exchange activity."

        "title": "What the Ethereum Shanghai Upgrade Means for You, ETH, and the SEC - Decrypt",
        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nIn just shy of two weeks, if all goes to plan, Ethereum\u2019s eagerly anticipated Shanghai upgrade will go live, enabling the withdrawal of staked ETH from the blockchain network and effectively completing its years-long transition to proof of stake.\n\nSince December 2020, when Ethereum began that journey to a proof-of-stake model\u2014in which users stake cryptocurrency with a network to validate on-chain transactions, and then are rewarded for that participation with newly generated cryptocurrency\u2014network participants have deposited over $32.95 billion worth of ETH with the network.\n\nIn September, Ethereum\u2019s merge event successfully upgraded the network\u2019s mainnet to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, forever changing the way Ethereum transactions are processed and reducing the network\u2019s carbon footprint by 99%, according to figures from the Ethereum Foundation.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut the merge did not grant stakers on the network the ability to withdraw deposited ETH or the rewards generated by those deposits. Those funds remain captive on Ethereum; Shanghai will finally, after over two years, make them accessible.\n\nOn April 12, at 11:27 pm UTC, Shanghai will activate. What will that seismic moment in Ethereum\u2019s history mean for the network, for its participants, and for the broader crypto ecosystem?\n\nETH better have my money\n\nAs a technical matter, Shanghai will be less involved than one might expect. The vast majority of Ethereum stakers, who have deposited their ETH with the network through intermediaries like Lido and Coinbase, won\u2019t need to do anything on their ends once Shanghai goes live\u2014besides wait.\n\nStaked ETH, and the rewards generated by those funds, will be made available for withdrawal by intermediaries at varying dates following Shanghai\u2019s successful implementation. Lido, the largest ETH staking intermediary, recently announced that such capability will be introduced about a month after the upgrade, after a series of audits and safety checks.\n\nCoinbase, meanwhile, has not offered a firm timetable for rolling out staked ETH withdrawals, saying the process could take up to several months for some customers. All Ethereum network participants staking via third parties should check with those companies as to when their funds will be made available.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFor the smaller number of independent validators who have staked directly with Ethereum (that pool is smaller because Ethereum requires validators to deposit at least 32 ETH, or just over $58,000 at writing, to stake with the network), matters will be only slightly more hands-on.\n\nValidators must first provide a withdrawal address for staked funds to be sent to; typically, most validators already submitted that address during the staking deposit process. Once a withdrawal address has been submitted to Ethereum, it cannot be changed.\n\nValidators can then opt for either a partial or full withdrawal. A partial withdrawal will send all funds and rewards generated beyond the minimum deposit amount of 32 ETH to a validator\u2019s withdrawal address. If a validator\u2019s withdrawal credentials are updated, then partial withdrawals will be sent to their withdrawal address automatically.\n\nIndependent stakers can also opt for a full withdrawal, which removes a user\u2019s full stake, including original deposits of 32 ETH, from Ethereum, ending a validator\u2019s participation in the transaction validation process. To fully withdraw from Ethereum\u2019s staking process, a validator need only send a single exit message to the network using their validator keys and validator client.\n\nPartial and full withdrawals will be processed in the order they are received by the network; based on the expected amount of traffic to come immediately following Shanghai\u2019s implementation, that initial queue could last up to 2 to 3 days.\n\nWhat will Shanghai mean for the Ethereum ecosystem?\n\nWhile Shanghai will certainly be a notable event for individual stakers, and carries great symbolic significance as the culmination of Ethereum\u2019s transformation to a functional proof-of-stake network, the upgrade will not meaningfully change the way that users interact with Ethereum, nor the underlying economics of the network itself.\n\n\u201cMost people have been able to sell [staked ETH] for quite some time, because the majority of ETH is being staked through platforms with liquid staking tokens, like Lido or Rocket Pool,\u201d Jacob Cantele, head of product at Ethereum layer-2 Mantle, told Decrypt. \u201cSo I don't actually think [Shanghai] represents a major shift in the economics of Ethereum.\u201d\n\nThe vast majority of ETH staked with Ethereum has, up to this point, been deposited with the network via third-party intermediaries, including staking pools like Lido, Rocket Pool, and Stakefish, as well as centralized crypto exchanges such as Coinbase, Kraken, and Binance. This is largely due to the fact, as mentioned above, that an individual validator must possess 32 ETH, or just over $58,000 at writing, to stake directly with Ethereum. Intermediary staking services generally allow for ETH deposits of any amount, in exchange for a small service fee.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMany of those intermediaries have issued tokens representing staked ETH to their customers, meaning that a sizable portion of the capital supposedly held captive in Ethereum\u2019s staking deposit contract has been traveling freely around the crypto ecosystem for years. And with Ethereum\u2019s internal mechanisms fully converted to proof of stake since September, the network looks poised to chug along post-Shanghai without much noticeable difference.\n\n\u201cShanghai\u2019s very exciting, but I do think it's just another step in the progression forward,\u201d Alison Mangiero, executive director of Proof of Stake Alliance, an advocacy group for proof-of-stake blockchain networks like Ethereum, told Decrypt.\n\nWhat will Shanghai mean for the broader crypto climate?\n\nBut whereas matters within Ethereum appear likely to look largely unchanged following Shanghai, the political landscape beyond the network\u2019s virtual borders may be much more substantially impacted by the upgrade.\n\nIn the last year, and particularly since the stunning collapse of crypto exchange FTX in November, American regulators have cracked down heavily on crypto companies, most recently those offering staking services. In February, the SEC hit centralized crypto exchange Kraken with a $30 million fine, alleging the company\u2019s intermediary staking services constituted illegal securities offerings.\n\nKraken competitors like Coinbase took the opportunity to clarify that their own staking services did not determine rates of return on staked deposits in-house, as Kraken\u2019s had, and therefore should not be considered yield products. Last week, regardless, the SEC issued Coinbase with a Wells Notice, alleging that company\u2019s staking services also constitute unregistered securities. Such a notice indicates that an enforcement action in the form of a lawsuit from the SEC is likely forth-coming.\n\nShanghai\u2019s implementation alone may not immediately change the calculus of the SEC\u2019s escalating war with staking intermediaries. But it could place another, much larger staking-related target in the federal agency\u2019s crosshairs: Ethereum itself.\n\nThe very day the merge successfully transitioned Ethereum to proof of stake in September, SEC chair Gary Gensler, according to the Wall Street Journal, told reporters that proof of stake networks could be considered securities offerings due to their rewards mechanisms, all-but calling out Ethereum by name. Since that date, Gensler has slowly but surely built the case that ETH is likely a security, primarily by suggesting that \u201conly Bitcoin\u201d is a commodity.\n\nIt is possible that the SEC\u2014which has long-defined \u201cinvestment contracts,\u201d a type of security, as investments made with an \u201cexpectation of profits to be derived from the efforts of others\u201d\u2014might use the implementation of Shanghai as evidence of the fulfillment of a securities arrangement between ETH stakers and the core Ethereum team that implemented the upgrade.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cPeople aren't going to get the [Ethereum] that they've earned as staking rewards, unless the Shanghai upgrade is successful,\u201d Michael Selig, an attorney specializing in crypto regulation, who previously worked for the CFTC, told Decrypt. \u201cWho's coordinating that? The SEC might have a list of people. It\u2019s the essential efforts being performed by these guys to make it happen.\u201d\n\nWhile Selig adamantly believes such a move on the SEC\u2019s part would constitute a misinterpretation of securities law, particularly given the decentralization of the Ethereum core development team, he fears it may be a path forward to censoring the Ethereum network as a whole.\n\n\u201cWhat do they have to say? \u2018Look, these are investment contracts, and here\u2019s evidence that there\u2019s management or efforts being made by certain people,\u2019\u201d Selig said.\n\nSuch an argument would not likely be made until withdrawals are enabled on Ethereum, and the theoretical contract between Ethereum and its users is fulfilled. Should the Shanghai upgrade fail\u2014an unlikely scenario, given the diligence and track record of Ethereum\u2019s core developers\u2014the SEC would have an even better case, arguing on behalf of swarms of disgruntled stakers that the network failed to fulfill its end of an investment bargain.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether the SEC\u2019s appetite for crypto regulation might have grown so large as to attempt to snuff out one of the linchpins of the entire blockchain ecosystem. But whereas April 12\u2014the date of Shanghai\u2019s implementation\u2014will remain a largely symbolic milestone within the crypto industry, symbolism can often have much more tangible repercussions in the realm of politics."

        "title": "What is Staking? Crypto's Most Common 'Passive Income' Strategy Explained - DailyCoin",
        "content": "Crypto Staking is one of the blockchain industry\u2019s most misunderstood concepts. Staking has become a buzzword that entices holders and investors to lock up their tokens with the promise of generous passive income and crypto rewards.\n\nMany staking reward contracts and platforms don\u2019t technically offer any staking at all. You can\u2019t stake Bitcoin (BTC), for example, so take care around any provider who tells you it\u2019s possible.\n\nCrypto staking is a broad topic, with different blockchain networks living by slightly different staking rules. What is true for Ethereum (ETH) staking is not set in stone on Cardano (ADA).\n\nWith the SEC cracking down on crypto exchanges like Kraken and Coinbase over their staking programs, there\u2019s never been a better time to revisit the basics.\n\nWhat is staking in cryptocurrency? What on earth does Proof-of-Stake even mean and what are the risks?\n\nWhat Is Crypto Staking?\n\nStaking cryptocurrency is a popular way to earn passive income on your digital assets. Many crypto investors like to see it as a kind of savings account, where you can earn an attractive APY (annual percentage yield) by staking coins.\n\nDespite the inherent volatility of the crypto market, staking helps holders grow their crypto investment over a long period of time. They don\u2019t need to actively trade or inject fresh capital into their portfolio to increase their exposure.\n\nBut as the saying goes: \u2018There\u2019s no such thing as a free lunch.\u2019\n\nWhere do these generous interest rates and seemingly endless staking rewards come from?\n\nThe Proof-of-Stake Consensus Mechanism\n\nThe Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus is, unfortunately, not a group of friends that tell you whether or not your beef is rare or medium-rare. It\u2019s the process used by several blockchains to secure the network and produce new blocks.\n\nGenerally, a network validator is someone who locks up staking coins to a blockchain to help decentralize the network and verify transactions. For ensuring the security of the network and producing new blocks, validators earn staking rewards. These rewards are generally new tokens entering the supply based on the network\u2019s emission schedule.\n\nIn a Proof-of-Work blockchain, like Bitcoin, miners solve complex computational puzzles to compete for the right to create new blocks and earn mining rewards. This is why successful Bitcoin miners consume so much energy.\n\nSource: Ethereum\n\nTo give you an idea of just how much energy a PoW chain uses, Ethereum reduced its consumption by 99% after transitioning to a PoS consensus.\n\nOn the other hand, PoS chains randomly select a validator for each new block. This process uses considerably less energy than PoW and incentivizes crypto investors to stake more crypto assets, increasing their chances of winning the staking reward.\n\nThis exercise is a win-win, the blockchain attracts a greater variety of stakers and decentralizes network operation, while stakers earn cryptocurrency rewards and help support the ecosystem.\n\nHow Much Cryptocurrency Can I Earn Through Staking Rewards?\n\nCryptocurrency staking interest rates vary between different blockchains, providers and lock-up periods. Generally speaking, rewards fluctuate between 4-18% APY. Sites like StakingRewards.com aggregate data to tell us where the best pure staking opportunities are. However, it doesn\u2019t include options from centralized exchanges.\n\nIn some cases, cryptocurrency exchanges will offer staking rewards at boosted rates to entice holders to lock-up their staking coins for longer periods of time.\n\nFor example, this crypto exchange is offering 35% APY if we\u2019re willing to lock up our Cosmos (ATOM) tokens for 120 days, but just 1% for a flexible deposit.\n\nWhat Are the Risks of Staking?\n\nLike in every corner of the crypto space, staking comes with its own risks. For example, if you\u2019ve delegated your tokens to a bad validator, you might be at risk of \u2018slashing.\u2019 Slashing is a defense mechanism used by staking protocols to ensure that validators are behaving properly and fulfilling their tasks.\n\nIf a PolkaDot (DOT) validator is misbehaving and running malicious software, its stake is at risk of being \u2018slashed.\u2019 If this happens, a portion of their stake is forcibly removed and given to the protocol treasury.\n\nEach network and staking protocol has its own slashing rules, so if you\u2019re running a validator it\u2019s worth checking what might put you at risk.\n\nOther risks include loss of value due to price volatility. If you\u2019ve locked up your staking coins for a long period of time, you might find yourself unable to sell quickly in case of a black swan event.\n\nSource: CoinMarketCap\n\nRemember when LUNA crashed from $80 to a few cents in a few days? Thanks to the 14 day unlock period, thousands of LUNA stakers could do nothing but watch their holdings burn to the ground before their eyes.\n\nThe same goes for those who stake their coins through centralized exchanges. When FTX collapsed, anyone staking their crypto through FTX staking pools had zero access to their assets.\n\nCrypto Staking Myths and Misconceptions\n\nLike any misunderstood crypto topic, there is plenty of misinformation that can lead you astray. Some of this confusion is centered around the definition of staking drifting away from its original purpose and being loosely applied to any circumstance where you deposit tokens in exchange for rewards.\n\nLet\u2019s shed light on some of these misconceptions.\n\n\u201cI Can Stake My Tokens in DeFi Apps to Earn Other Tokens\u201d\n\nWhile you can deposit certain tokens in DeFi apps, like liquidity farms, to earn other tokens, this isn\u2019t technically staking. In this example, PancakeSwap says we can earn tokens by staking their native CAKE token in staking pools.\n\nWhat we\u2019re actually doing here is depositing CAKE into a smart contract and earning emissions of other tokens. We\u2019re not helping to secure the non-existent CAKE blockchain. DeFi apps like PancakeSwap offer these \u2018staking pools\u2019 because it brings utility and demand to the CAKE token.\n\n\u201cStaking My Tokens Means I Don\u2019t Control Them Anymore\u201d\n\nIn many cases, staking cryptocurrency means delegating them to a validator who uses them on your behalf. However some networks, like Cardano, don\u2019t follow this rule.\n\nStaked ADA never leaves your crypto wallet, making it one of the most secure staking protocols in the market.\n\n\u201cStaking Rewards Are Fixed and Accurate\u201d\n\nJust because staking emissions are fixed and regular, doesn\u2019t guarantee that your validator will be randomly selected and receive their estimated rewards. This is a question of statistics more than anything, so if you\u2019re staking long term, you probably won\u2019t even notice.\n\nSource: Solana Docs\n\nIt\u2019s worth mentioning that staking APY doesn\u2019t take into account token inflation and emissions. For example, Solana\u2019s token inflationary emission rate means that SOL\u2019s supply increases by anywhere from 1.5-5% each year.\n\nEven though you might be earning 6-8% APY by staking SOL, the supply is still inflating and potentially losing value. Some crypto enthusiasts prefer to calculate their staking rewards by subtracting a tokens inflation rate from the original APY.\n\n\u201cI Can Stake NFTs to Earn Crypto Tokens\u201d\n\nLike PancakeSwap, this is a liberal use of the phrase \u2018Stake.\u2019 Yes, you can deposit your Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT into a smart contract to earn $APE tokens, but you\u2019re not helping anyone secure the network and produce new blocks.\n\nCyberkongz earn $BANANA, DeGods earn $DUST, Neo Tokyo Citizens earn $BYTES, the list goes on. Why do so many NFT collections do this?\n\nDepositing NFTs in staking contracts takes them off the market and makes the available supply look scarcer. A collection with only 2% of its total supply listed looks like a much more desirable asset than a collection with 20% of its pieces up for sale.\n\nCrypto Staking Pros and Cons\n\nCryptocurrency staking is a pretty nuanced subject, with a lot of moving parts and specific rules. To make it easier to wrap your head around why staking might be interesting to you specifically, here are the benefits and drawbacks.\n\nPros\n\nPassive Income \u2013 Cryptocurrency staking is a great way to earn passive income and organically grow your holdings with minimal risk.\n\n\u2013 Cryptocurrency staking is a great way to earn passive income and organically grow your holdings with minimal risk.

This is problematic if you find yourself needing to sell quickly Relinquish full control of your funds \u2013 In most cases, staking means you need to deposit your crypto into a staking contract. To be honest, this sounds a lot scarier than it really is. Slashing and validator hacks are uncommon, and operators have a vested interest in the security of the chain they\u2019re validating.\n\nHow Can I Start Staking My Cryptocurrency?\n\nAlmost every crypto exchange under the sun offers staking in some shape or form. If you want to get started with crypto staking for the first time, this is by far the easiest method.\n\nYour preferred crypto exchange should have an \u2018Earn\u2019 section where you can browse available staking subscriptions. All you need to do is search for the crypto you\u2019d like to stake and choose a lock-up period that you\u2019re happy with.\n\nRunning your own validator is a different story. This can be quite complicated, especially if you don\u2019t have a background in development. The best place to start looking for answers is in the developer documents of the blockchain of your choice.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nCrypto staking, like any financial growth strategy, has its risks. Everyone loves getting free cryptocurrency, but that doesn\u2019t mean that you should trust everything at face value. Take care when choosing your staking provider.\n\nAs explained above, the term \u2018Staking\u2019 has drifted away from its technical definition.
