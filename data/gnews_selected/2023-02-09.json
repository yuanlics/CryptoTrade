        "title": "Marc Andreessen: Ethereum and Web3 Lead Bitcoin on Tech Innovation - Blockworks",
        "content": "Marc Andreessen, best known for co-founding web browser Netscape and Silicon Valley venture capital fund a16z, is still invested in the crypto industry, even though his expectations around Bitcoin didn\u2019t pan out.\n\nIn 2014, Andreessen predicted that the world would be talking about Bitcoin the same way they did about the internet. The tech investor may have now changed his mind somewhat, but is still heavy on the industry as a whole.\n\nHe told Reason Magazine in an interview published Wednesday that, back then, he thought Bitcoin was a tech innovation that would develop to support several other applications just like the internet, but that it \u201cbasically stopped evolving.\u201d He now has his sights set on Ethereum being at the core of transformation.\n\n\u201cWhat happened was a bunch of other projects emerged and took that place, and the big one right now is Ethereum. I would either say Ethereum instead of Bitcoin, or I would just say crypto or Web3 instead of Bitcoin,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to the early Facebook investor, Web3 has all the features of the internet that people knew they wanted to have when the internet was originally built.\n\n\u201c[Web3] is all the aspects of basically being able to do business and be able to have money and be able to do transactions and have trust,\u201d he said. \u201cWe did not know how to use the internet to do that in the 90s. And now, with this technological breakthrough of the blockchain, we now know how to do that, we have the technological foundation to be able to do that.\u201d\n\nA16Z launched a $4.5 billion crypto fund in 2022, which was touted as the largest-ever crypto-venture fund. The firm\u2019s flagship crypto fund, launched in 2018, lost 40% in the first half of 2022 as they faced a battering. The VC\u2019s portfolio counts projects like Alchemy, Aptos, Avalanche, Chia, Compound, Coinbase, Lido, Mysten Labs and Yuga Labs.\n\nAndreessen didn\u2019t touch upon the bear market that lasted most of 2022, but said the potential of the industry is \u201cextraordinarily high\u201d and that there are \u201ctonnes of really smart entrepreneurs\u201d pursuing various opportunities.\n\n\u201cA lot of those things have worked, some of those things haven\u2019t worked yet, but I think that they\u2019re going to work,\u201d he said.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "Charles Hoskinson: Ethereum staking is problematic - crypto.news",
        "content": "The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is said to be considering a ban on crypto-staking services. In response, Charles Hoskinson of Cardano voiced his opinion on the subject, training his eyes on Ethereum, whose staking model he said is problematic.\n\nHoskinson: The locked stakes are a red flag\n\nAccording to Hoskinson, the fact that ethereum coins are locked in staking smart contracts that are completely inaccessible gives the impression that they are controlled goods.\n\nHoskinson asserts that staking ethereum also presents many challenges. The temporary transfer of one\u2019s assets to another party in exchange for compensation from that party resembles the sale of a regulated financial product. Charles believes cutting and bonding could be more effective instead of this system.\n\nIn the response tweet to Armstrong\u2019s first article, he further explained that non-custodial liquid staking is analogous to the mining pools that the bitcoin community has been using for the last 13 years.\n\nEthereum staking is problematic. Temporarily giving up your assets to someone else to have them get a return looks a lot like regulated products. Slashing and bonds not so good. Non-custodial liquid staking on the other hand is like the mining pools we've used for 13 years \u2014 Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) February 9, 2023\n\nAccording to the head of Cardano, his team tackled the issue of staking on the protocol to a model mostly governed by the community rather than a select group of users.\n\nShibetoshi, the doge founder, another renowned crypto personnel who remarked on Armstrong\u2019s thread, seemed somehow unsupportive of the ban and wondered why the government would let slip such a taxation opportunity bringing more weight and questions into the SEC\u2019s alleged move.\n\nwhy don\u2019t they want more easy tax money\n\n\n\nthe government is so weird \u2014 Shibetoshi Nakamoto (@BillyM2k) February 9, 2023\n\nWhat could this mean to the ecosystem?\n\nEven if the information is still considered a rumor, many involved in the business are noticeably getting ready for a real ban to be imposed by the market regulator.\n\nAccording to Hoskinson, the \u201cbasic misunderstanding about the real facts of operation and design\u201d will cause the SEC to classify all staking products under the same umbrella even though they each have unique characteristics.\n\nHe added that although most staking protocols have opted to construct centralized rather than decentralized systems, it is a move that will ultimately be detrimental to the industry.\n\nThe SEC has been given the authority to regulate cryptocurrencies pending a change in the regulatory landscape in the United States. As a result, the commission has initiated several enforcement actions against many companies, including Ripple Labs Inc. and LBRY.\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

The financial and market information provided on U.Today is intended for informational purposes only. U.Today is not liable for any financial losses incurred while trading cryptocurrencies. Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Ethereum (ETH) network's Shanghai update is one of the most highly anticipated events on the crypto market. It promises to bring increased liquidity to the leading altcoin by unlocking ETH staked in the Beacon Chain. The expected release date for the Shanghai update is March 2023, marking the end of the Merge era.\n\nWhile the crypto community has some concerns about the potential selling pressure that could result from the update, it is important to note that the ETH release will occur gradually through a queue, potentially reducing the impact on the market.\n\nThe launch of the Beacon Chain enabled stakeholders to validate blocks and secure the ETH network while maintaining the predictability of security during The Merge, the biggest update on the cryptocurrency market in 2022.\n\nIn addition to the Q1 hard fork, the ETH network will also undergo two major upgrades later in 2023. These updates will further enhance the leading altcoin's position on the market.\n\nThe Surge\n\nEthereum creator Vitalik Buterin has stated that the primary focus of the upcoming update is to address the scalability challenges faced by the smart contract platform. The update will accomplish this by fragmenting the ETH database, enabling the network to scale while maintaining its decentralization.\n\nTo achieve this, the ETH network's information will be split horizontally, allowing it to distribute the load and reduce storage costs and hardware requirements. It is important to note that this update will not immediately result in a scalable Ethereum blockchain. Instead, EIP 4844 will create a separate blockchain for Layer 2, which will aid scalability solutions such as Arbitrum and Optimism in lowering their transaction fees and becoming truly competitive with other ETH competitors with lower transfer fees.\n\nEOF\n\nThe upcoming EOF (EVM Object Format) update will bring improvements to Ethereum's code execution environment, making the cryptocurrency platform more efficient and streamlining the process of creating smart contracts. EOF will also facilitate updates to the EVM and create a system to track resource usage of new contracts.\n\nThese upgrades bring Ethereum closer to its goal of becoming a large, decentralized computer that supports dApps with a user-friendly interface, low fees and a secure network for daily transactions.\n\nIt is important to note that updates in the cryptocurrency world are made through proposed improvements that are subject to change at any time."
