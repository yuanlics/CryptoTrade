        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s long-awaited Shapella hard fork has been successfully executed on the Goerli testnet, the final test before Ethereum validators can withdraw their ether from the Beacon Chain.\n\nHowever, the journey to this milestone wasn\u2019t all smooth sailing. Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) core developer, Tim Beiko, pointed out that some testnet validators failed to upgrade their client software ahead of the Goerli fork, causing delays in processing deposits. He attributed it to testnet validators having \u201cless incentive\u201d to make the upgrade given that the Goerli ETH \u201cis worthless.\u201d\n\nhttps://twitter.com/TimBeiko/status/1635771385380499456\n\nBeiko remains optimistic that validators will make necessary adjustments before the fork on the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nThe Shapella upgrade comprises five different Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs), with EIP-4895 being the most anticipated, as it will push staked ETH from the Beacon Chain to the execution layer, bringing Ethereum one step closer to a fully functional proof-of-stake system.\n\nShapella hard fork to unlock $30b worth of ETH\n\nShapella is set to roll out on the Ethereum mainnet in early April, following delays in preparing the Sepolia and Goerli testnets for the fork.\n\nThis hard fork introduces partial and full withdrawals and unlocks 17.6 million ETH, amounting to over $30 billion at current prices. These funds have been locked up since the launch of Ethereum\u2019s PoS Beacon Chain in December 2020.\n\nThe Shanghai upgrade will enable phased validator withdrawals, allowing users who have been staking to access their staked $ETH and staking rewards.\n\n\n\nThere are 522K active validators on Ethereum, and once the upgrade comes, only ~1.6k-1.8k validators would be able to exit per day pic.twitter.com/ewCvD7u1ER \u2014 ParaSpace (@ParaSpace_NFT) March 8, 2023\n\nHowever, the Ethereum Foundation has implemented measures to prevent a flood of ETH from hitting the market. Withdrawals are capped at 0.40% of total staked ETH, with only 2,200 withdrawals processed daily.\n\nTestnets replicate a main blockchain, providing developers with a testing ground to patch bugs before upgrades go live on the mainnet. Goerli was the third and final testnet to go through such simulations.\n\nThis test was highly anticipated as it has the largest validator set and closely mimics the Ethereum blockchain\u2019s activity. It was also the final opportunity for staking providers to test the correct processing of staked ETH withdrawals before the upgrade went live.\n\nEthereum developers will convene for their biweekly call on March 16 to set a date for the mainnet Shanghai upgrade. During the last biweekly call, Ethereum developers discussed a target date for early April, a slight deviation from their initial timeline of March.\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nCEO of Ark Invest Cathie Wood has posted a thread on her Twitter handle to comment on the instability of the banking system that has shown itself recently. She pointed out that the two leading cryptocurrencies rose in price on that.\n\nElon Musk, tech billionaire and boss of several leading companies, including Twitter, joined the discussion in the comments.\n\nSlamming regulators for blocking crypto platforms\n\nCathie Woods stated that while the U.S. banking system seized up, the two major cryptos, Bitcoin and Ethereum, as well as other digital currencies on the market took advantage of that and \"didn't skip a beat.\"\n\nWhile the US banking system was seizing up in response to bank runs threatening regional banks, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other crypto networks didn\u2019t skip a beat. Instability in the banking system threatened stablecoins, the on-ramps to DeFi, in stark contrast to regulator rhetoric https://t.co/r5xwC96Pdj \u2014 Cathie Wood (@CathieDWood) March 15, 2023\n\nBitcoin reached an impressive local peak, exceeding the $26,000 level for a short while, rising over 17% this week. It was followed by a 5% drop. Ethereum price has surged 20.26% too since the weekend, hitting $1,776, but it is now down to the $1,689 level.\n\nHowever, Woods mentioned, the instability in the banking system as three major (and crypto-friendly) banks went down, two of them bailed out, produced a threat to the USDC stablecoin. It also impacted TUSD, BUSD and USDP.\n\nElon Musk steps in, supporting Woods\n\nAlso, prior to the crisis beginning, the SEC regulator sued Kraken and Gemini exchanges for their crypto lending service, and the New York attorney general filed a lawsuit against KuCoin exchange, claiming that Ethereum is a security.\n\nRather than attacking those \"decentralized, transparent and well-functioning\" financial platforms that have no central point of failure, Wood believes, the regulators should have dealt with the weak points in the traditional banking system. The clear signs of a crisis there have been looming and are similar to the crisis in the 1920s, Wood noted, perhaps referring to the Great Depression that hit the U.S. in 1929.\n\nTwitter chief Elon Musk commented that the situation with banks is now very similar to that back in 1929.\n\nLot of current year similarities to 1929 \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 15, 2023\n\nRobert Kiyosaki on fall of three top banks\n\nThe three aforementioned banks are Silvergate, Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. All three of them had cooperated with crypto companies like exchanges. Signature Bank also worked with Paxos, the issuer of the BUSD and USDP stablecoins. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse also made a statement on Twitter to say that the company had small exposure to Signature Bank. The failure of the latter, however, will not impact Ripple's daily transactions.\n\nAs reported by U.Today over the weekend, prominent investor and writer Robert Kiyosaki predicted the collapse of Signature Bank on Saturday, saying that two major banks have crashed and the third one is ready to follow in its footsteps. He did not specify exactly what bank it would be."

        "content": "Over the past trading sessions, Ethereum has managed to appreciate and topple over the $1,600 price zone. At the moment, the altcoin might be displaying consolidated price action.\n\nIn the past week, the coin has jumped by nearly 8%, which has made ETH breach a crucial resistance level of $1,430. It has now turned that level into a support zone. On the daily chart, the Ethereum price also formed a bullish pattern. The technical outlook of Ethereum pointed out that the bulls were taking charge of the price action. Demand for the altcoin had also moved north.\n\nThe buying pressure had noted a downtick but was still bullish. Accumulation also noted a positive change as a result. If the bulls witness a further increase in demand, ETH could break past the $1,700 mark. The market capitalization of the altcoin also increased over the last 24 hours, which indicated that buying strength also shot up.\n\nEthereum Price Analysis: One-Day Chart\n\nETH was trading at $1,686 at the time of writing. After piercing through the $1,430 mark, the altcoin continued to break past multiple resistance levels. The overhead price ceiling stood at $1,700, breaching which the coin can witness resistance at $1,770 respectively.\n\nThe crucial support line for Ethereum stood at $1,560. But a fall through this level will cause ETH to fall below $1,430. The bullish force seems to have taken over, although the rally could be short-lived.\n\nEthereum formed the bullish megaphone pattern, which is also called the broadening pattern that highlights volatility.\n\nIn this case, the pattern signifies the presence of higher highs and lower lows, which means that the altcoin was bullish. The amount of ETH traded in the last session remained positive, implying positive buying strength.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nAfter being stuck inside the bearish zone, demand managed to move into the positive zone over the last few trading sessions. The Relative Strength Index was above the 50 mark and was parked near the 60-mark, indicating that buyers outnumbered sellers.\n\nThe indicator noted a small downtick, it is crucial that demand climbs on the chart further if ETH has to trade near $1,800.\n\nIn accordance with increased demand, ETH moved above the 20-Simple Moving Average (SMA) line as buyers started to drive the price momentum in the market.\n\nOther technical indicators have also pointed towards a bullish force. Moving Average Convergence Divergence which measures the price momentum and reversal depicted in green signal bars is reflected due to buying signals on the chart.\n\nParabolic SAR indicates the price direction and the change in the same. The dotted lines were below the candlesticks which meant that the price was moving on the upside.\n\nFeatured Image From UnSplash, Charts From TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "Ethereum price reaches lowest level relative to Bitcoin in 5 months - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The previous six months should have been extremely beneficial to Ether\u2019s (ETH) price, especially following the project\u2019s most significant upgrade ever in September 2022. However, the reality was the opposite: Between Sept. 15, 2022 and March 15, 2023, Ether underperformed by 10% against Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nETH/BTC price ratio on Bitfinex, 2-day. Source: TradingView\n\nThe ETH/BTC price ratio of 0.068 had been holding since October 2022, a support that was broken on March 15. Whatever the reason for the underperformance, traders currently have little confidence in placing leverage bets, according to ETH futures and options data.\n\nBut first, one should consider why Ether\u2019s price was expected to rise in the previous six months. On Sept.15, 2022, the Merge \u2014 a hard fork that switched the network to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism \u2014 occurred. It enabled a much lower, even negative, coin issuing rate. But more importantly, the change paved the way for parallel processing that aimed to bring scalability and lower transaction costs to the Ethereum network.\n\nThe Shapella hard fork, expected to take effect on the mainnet in April, is the next step in the Ethereum network upgrade. The change will allow validators who previously deposited 32 ETH to enter the staking mechanism to withdraw in part or in full. While this development is generally positive because it gives validators more flexibility, the potential 1.76 million ETH unlock is a negative consequence.\n\nHowever, there is a cap on the number of validators that can exit; therefore, the maximum daily unstake is 70,000 ETH. Moreover, after exiting the validation process, one may choose between Lido, Rocket Pool or a decentralized finance (DeFi) application for yield mechanisms. These coins will not necessarily be sold on the market.\n\nLet\u2019s look at Ether derivatives data to understand if the recent drop below the 0.068 ETH/BTC ratio has affected investors\u2019 sentiment.\n\nETH futures recovered from a state of panic\n\nIn healthy markets, the annualized three-month futures premium should trade between 5% and 10% to cover associated costs and risks. However, when the contract trades at a discount (\u201cbackwardation\u201d) relative to traditional spot markets, it indicates traders\u2019 lack of confidence and is regarded as a bearish indicator.\n\nEther 2-month futures annualized premium. Source: Laevitas\n\nDerivatives traders became uncomfortable holding leverage long (bull) positions as the Ether futures premium moved below zero on March 11, down from 3.5% just two days prior. More importantly, the current 2.5% premium remains modest and distant from the 5% neutral-to-bullish threshold.\n\nNonetheless, declining demand for leverage longs (bulls) does not necessarily imply an expectation of negative price action. As a result, traders should examine Ether\u2019s options markets to understand how whales and market makers price the likelihood of future price movements.\n\nRelated: Lark Davis on fighting social media storms, and why he\u2019s an ETH bull \u2014 Hall of Flame\n\nETH options confirm a lack of risk appetite\n\nThe 25% delta skew is a telling sign showing when market makers and arbitrage desks are overcharging for upside or downside protection. In bear markets, options investors give higher odds for a price dump, causing the skew indicator to rise above 8%. On the other hand, bullish markets tend to drive the skew metric below -8%, meaning the bearish put options are in less demand.\n\nEther 30-day options 25% delta skew: Source: Laevitas\n\nOn March 3, the delta skew crossed the bearish 8% threshold, indicating stress among professional traders. The fear levels peaked on March 10, when the price of Ether plummeted to $1,370, its lowest level in 56 days, although the price of ETH rebounded above $1,480 on March 12.\n\nSurprisingly, on March 12, the 25% delta skew metric continued to rise, reaching its highest level of skepticism since November 2022. It happened just hours before Ether\u2019s price rose 20% in 48 hours, which explains why ETH traders shorting futures contracts faced $507 million in liquidations.\n\nThe 3% delta skew metric currently signals a balanced demand for ETH call and put options. When combined with the neutral stance on the ETH futures premium, the derivatives market indicates that professional traders are hesitant to place either bullish or bearish bets. Unfortunately, ETH derivatives metrics do not favor traders expecting Ether to reclaim the 0.068 level against Bitcoin in the near term.\n\nThe views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors\u2019 alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph."
