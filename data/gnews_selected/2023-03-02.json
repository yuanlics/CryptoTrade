        "content": "Ethereum developer Yoav Weiss announced ERC-4337, or \u201csmart accounts,\u201d at WalletCon in Denver, Colorado, on March 1.\n\nERC-4337 (formerly EIP-4337) is also known as account abstraction. It provides a basis for various features such as account recovery and group-access wallets. Other possible applications include bundled and sponsored transactions for reduced transaction fees.\n\nIt will also allow platforms to provide crypto services without requiring users to set up a traditional wallet and manually store their seed phrase or private key. Account abstraction stores keys locally on the user\u2019s hardware security module (HSM) \u2060\u2014 not with any service provider \u2060\u2014 and therefore is as secure as a self-custodied crypto wallet.\n\nERC-4337 was added to Ethereum through a smart contract, which was introduced without forking the entire blockchain. The relevant smart contract was deployed on Feb. 28, several hours before the feature was officially announced.\n\nThe feature can also be introduced on any EVM-compatible blockchain, including BNB Smart Chain (BNB), Polygon (MATIC), Avalanche (AVAX), and many others.\n\nERC-4337 was notably endorsed by Visa last December. The company recognized account abstraction as a possible way for users to auto-schedule crypto payments.\n\nOther, more extensive Ethereum upgrades are also underway. The blockchain is preparing for its Shanghai upgrade, allowing validators to withdraw staked ETH. That feature was activated on a testnet this week and should be fully introduced this month."

        "content": "The price of Ethereum\u2019s native token, Ether (ETH), shows a growing conflict among traders about the market direction for March. This uncertainty has resulted in ETH price consolidating inside a narrow sideways range between $1,600 and $1,700 since Feb. 15.\n\n25% ETH price correction on the table in March\n\nThe uncertainty stems from Ethereum\u2019s long-awaited Shanghai upgrade going live sometime in March.\n\nSeveral analysts predict the upgrade, which will enable stakers to withdraw their vested tokens from Ethereum\u2019s proof-of-stake (PoS) smart contract, will trigger a short-term sell-off event.\n\nThe Ethereum PoS smart contract has attracted more than 17.4 million ETH (~$28.35 billion at the current exchange rate) since its introduction in December 2020, per Etherscan.\n\nIn addition, Ether is finding it difficult to break above the technical resistance range. The Ethereum token has attempted to flip the $1,650\u20131,700 area to support multiple times since August 2022, as shown by the red bar in the chart below.\n\nETH/USD daily price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nInterestingly, each failed breakout attempt has resulted in a strong pullback toward a common support line \u2014 a multimonth ascending trendline (black).\n\nTherefore, if history is any indication, ETH\u2019s next correction could potentially land its price near $1,250, down 25% from the current levels. Conversely, a break above $1,650\u20131,700 positions ETH for the $1,925\u20132,000 range (purple) as its next upside target.\n\nFuture ETH selloffs will be limited \u2014 data trackers\n\nFrom an on-chain perspective, an extended Ether price crash appears less likely.\n\nNotably, there\u2019s been a massive drop in ETH supplies on exchanges since September 2022 \u2014 falling from around 30% to 11%. Theoretically, this reduces the immediate sell pressure as capital moves to the sidelines.\n\n\u201cThe trend in crypto, particularly since September, has been quickly moving self-custody,\u201d Santiment noted, adding:\n\n\u201cThis trend picked up after the FTX collapse. Regardless, with both BTC and ETH around 5-year low exchange supplies, future sell-offs will be limited.\u201c\n\nIn addition, data analytics firm CryptoQuant has reached a similar conclusion about potential Ether selloffs in the future, primarily in the wake of the Shanghai hard fork.\n\nRelated: 3 tips for trading Ethereum this year\n\nCryptoQuant notes that 60% of the staked ETH supply \u2014 about 10.3 million ETH \u2014 is currently at a loss. Meanwhile, Lido DAO, the largest Ethereum staking provider, holds 30% of all staked ETH at an average loss of $1,000, or 24%.\n\n\u201cTypically, selling pressure arises when participants have extreme profits, which is not the case for staked ETH currently,\u201c CryptoQuant wrote:\n\n\u201cAdditionally, the most profitable staked ETH was staked less than a year ago and has not seen significant profit-taking events in the past.\u201c\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "title": "Ethereum Devs Confirm ETH Staking Withdrawals Pushed to April - Decrypt",
        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nEthereum\u2019s eagerly anticipated Shanghai upgrade, which will enable the withdrawal of staked ETH, will likely occur in the first two weeks of April, the network\u2019s core developers determined on a call Thursday.\n\nThough the upgrade had been firmly slated for a March release, some Ethereum developers began doubting that timeline would stick as early as January, as previously reported by Decrypt.\n\nEthereum\u2019s developers now plan to launch the Goerli testnet, essentially a comprehensive dress rehearsal of the Shanghai upgrade, on or around March 14. About a month later, should everything proceed smoothly, the actual Shanghai software update will go live mid-April.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe exact timing of Shanghai\u2019s implementation has been particularly closely watched due to the upgrade\u2019s seismic financial implications. Ever since Ethereum began transitioning to a proof-of-stake model\u2014in which Ethereum transactions are validated by users who have staked ETH with the network\u2014those same users have accumulated rewards for their network participation in the form of newly generated ETH. Since ETH staking began in December 2020, a whopping $28.7 billion worth of ETH (and counting) has been deposited with Ethereum. That\u2019s about 14.5% of all ETH in circulation.\n\nThose funds and the rewards they\u2019ve spawned, however, are not yet available for withdrawal. Making it possible for Ethereum users to withdraw their staked ETH is the core component of Shanghai.\n\nBy far the largest entities currently staking with Ethereum are intermediary staking services like Lido and crypto exchanges such as Coinbase, Kraken, and Binance. Those four companies, which pool together customers\u2019 ETH to stake them and earn passive rewards, currently account for 56% of all ETH staked with the network, according to Dune Analytics.\n\nThose firms\u2014many of which have sagged in the current crypto winter\u2014have a clear incentive to start churning out staked ETH rewards to customers and skimming fees off the top. JP Morgan analysts predicted in January that the Shanghai upgrade alone could \u201cusher in a new era\u201d for struggling crypto exchange Coinbase. The investment bank estimates that staking could earn Coinbase between $225 million and $545 million in revenue per year.\n\nWith so much riding on the upgrade, Ethereum\u2019s core developers have scrambled to get Shanghai out the door as quickly as possible. The network\u2019s developers removed other anticipated and much-need improvements to the Ethereum network from Shanghai to hasten its release, and even avoided adding minor technical tweaks to Ethereum\u2019s encoding methods to the upgrade, in a decision that could create technical debt for the network in years to come.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt feels like we\u2019re not thinking about the long-term health of Ethereum,\u201d said core developer Micah Zoltu, who protested those decisions, during a developers\u2019 meeting on the subject in January. \u201cWe\u2019re thinking, \u2018How do we do what the public wants, today?\u2019\u201d\n\nSacrifices made to speed up Shanghai\u2019s release, however, may have been in vain\u2014now that the upgrade is slipping, even if slightly, from its original release schedule."
