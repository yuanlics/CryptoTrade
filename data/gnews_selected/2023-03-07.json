        "content": "A long-dormant Ethereum (ETH) whale abruptly came to life over the weekend as the crypto markets continued to struggle.\n\nAccording to blockchain tracker Lookonchain, the Ethereum address moved 10,266 ETH worth about $16 million in two transactions early Sunday morning.\n\nThe wallet obtained the ETH via mining in 2017 and hadn\u2019t been active in more than five years before the latest transactions.\n\nIn a series of subsequent transactions, the Ethereum trove bounced around and split up into a flurry of different unknown addresses, but 1,322 ETH worth about $2 million did get eventually sent to the crypto exchange Poloniex, Lookonchain reports.\n\nThe previously dormant Ethereum wallet now holds only 1.25 ETH worth nearly $2,000.\n\nEthereum is worth $1,578 at time of writing. The second-ranked crypto asset by market cap is up 0.87% in the past 24 hours but down more than 3% in the past week. Ethereum is also more than 67% down from its all-time high of $4,878, which it hit in November 2021.\n\nIn terms of other interesting whale movements, Lookonchain reports that a crypto whale purchased 28,762 GMX worth $1.9 million and 59,064 Gains Network (GNS) worth $420,000 from the crypto exchange Binance.\n\nThe address then staked its newly purchased GMX and GNS, which Lookonchain says is indicative of the whale\u2019s bullishness on the Arbitrum ecosystem and decentralized derivatives projects.\n\nGMX and and Gains Network are both decentralized derivative exchanges.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

The crypto community has long tipped that the project may airdrop a native token to early users, but Arbitrum hasn\u2019t confirmed whether or not it will issue a token.\n\nPolymarket hosts predictive markets where users trade contracts corresponding to whether an event will or won\u2019t take place. The price of the \u2018Yes\u2019 and \u2018No\u2019 contracts combined adds up to $1.00, with either contract trading between $0.01 and $0.99.\n\nThe \u2018Yes\u2019 contracts corresponding to the platform\u2019s market for whether Arbitrum will airdrop a token by March 31st started the day at $0.28. Within three hours, the contract was changing hands for $0.68, but it has since retraced back down to $0.32.\n\n\u201cLooks like someone knows something about the Arbitrum airdrop,\u201d Polymarket tweeted.\n\nPolymarket predictive market for Arbitrum airdrop this month.

        "title": "Like a Blur: Tensor Plans Massive Airdrop for Solana NFT Traders - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Tensor, previously a relatively small contender in the Solana NFT marketplace wars, is quickly capturing market share after taking a page from the playbook of leading Ethereum platform Blur\u2014by targeting \u201cpro\u201d traders and providing \u201cloyalty\u201d rewards for using its marketplace.\n\nThe platform launched its \u201cSeason 1 airdrop\u201d on Monday, letting Solana NFT collectors claim free reward boxes given out in proportion to their trading activity on the blockchain network. Anyone who bought or sold a Solana NFT on any marketplace over the past six months is eligible, and those who did so on Tensor will receive \u201c25x-50x more rewards,\u201d per a tweet.\n\nIt\u2019s extremely close in design, execution, and aesthetic to the model pioneered by Blur, an upstart Ethereum NFT marketplace that debuted last October. In February, Blur rocketed to the top of the charts in terms of Ethereum NFT trading volume as users flipped NFTs en masse to maximize their BLUR airdrop rewards.\n\nHow Much Wash Trading Is Really Happening on Blur?\n\nTensor\u2019s Solana NFT trading volume surged to a new single-day high on Monday, according to public blockchain data collected by analytics platform Dune, reaching 23,351 SOL\u2014about $486,000 worth based on the value of Solana by the end of the day, according to CoinGecko. The platform saw nearly 2,800 NFT trades during that span.\n\nAccording to market-wide data collected by Tiexo, Tensor has facilitated about 19% of all Solana NFT trading volume over the past 24 hours, compared to 60% for market leader Magic Eden. That\u2019s a notable spike, given that Tensor has only accounted for about 6% of Solana NFT trading volume over the past 30 days.\n\nToday, following the surge in trading activity and attention prompted by the airdrop, Tensor announced that it has raised a $3 million seed round led by VC firm Placeholder, with participation from Solana co-founders Anatoly Yakovenko and Raj Gokal along with Solana Ventures, Big Brain Holdings, and MonkeVentures. Notable pseudonymous trader HGE, who also founded rival trading platform Hadeswap, joined as well.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn a Twitter thread, the Tensor team said that it began raising seed funding in November as cryptocurrency exchange FTX\u2014which was closely linked to the Solana ecosystem\u2014started to collapse. The startup said that it struggled with convincing some prospective investors, but it ultimately found interested backers within the space.\n\n\u201cEvery VC started the conversation by asking us when we're leaving Solana,\u201d Tensor wrote. \u201cWe told them we're not, and they proceeded to promptly hang up on us.\u201d\n\nBoth Blur and Tensor use marketplace models designed to provide increased liquidity for traders, making it easy to buy and sell NFTs. Tensor uses automated market maker (AMM) trading pools akin to Sudoswap on Ethereum, while Blur's bidding pools facilitate bulk trades and quick flips. Both offer detailed \u201cpro\u201d interface with additional tools for traders.\n\nMuch as Blur promised traders airdrop \u201ccare packages\u201d with mysterious rewards inside, Tensor is providing traders reward \u201cboxes\u201d that they can claim. Blur ultimately launched its own token for those traders to claim. So far, Tensor has said that the boxes contain \u201cfun things you might like\u201d and suggested that the descriptions hold clues for traders.\n\n\u201cTensor believes in a decentralized Web3 future with the most important protocols owned by the community,\u201d it tweeted. \u201cYOU are the reason Tensor is great and if we ever build anything important, we want YOU to own a piece of it.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, Tensor announced the launch of a larger second season airdrop that will only reward trading activity on its own platform, rather than the broader Solana NFT market. Traders will receive rewards based on bidding on or listing NFTs, as well as providing liquidity to pools, with a \u201cloyalty\u201d metric and upcoming points leaderboard gamifying the trading process.\n\nEditor's note: This article was updated after publication to clarify the Blur and Tensor marketplace models."

        "title": "Ethereum price action and derivatives data confirm bears are currently in control - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The price of Ether (ETH) declined 6% between March 2 and 3, followed by tight-range trading near $1,560. Still, analyzing a wider time frame provides no clear trend, as its chart can point to a descending channel or a slightly longer seven-week bullish pattern.\n\nEther (ETH) price index in USD, 1-day. Source: TradingView\n\nEther\u2019s recent lack of volatility can be partially explained by the upcoming Shanghai hard fork, an implementation aimed at allowing ETH staking withdrawals. Those participants were each required to lock 32 ETH on the Beacon Chain to support the network consensus protocol.\n\nAfter a series of delays, typical for changes in the production environment, the Shanghai Capella upgrade \u2014 also known as Shapella \u2014 is expected for early April, according to Ethereum core developer and project coordinator Tim Beiko. The Goerli testnet upgrade on March 14 will be the final rehearsal for the Shanghai hard fork before it is rolled out on the mainnet.\n\nRecession risks increase, favoring ETH bears\n\nOn the macroeconomic front, United States Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell testified before the Senate Banking Committee on March 7. Powell stated that interest rates will likely rise higher than anticipated after \u201cthe latest economic data have come in stronger than expected.\u201d\n\nEvidence points to the Fed lagging behind the inflation curve, boosting the odds of harder-than-expected interest rate increases and asset sales by the monetary authority. For instance, an inflation \u201csurprise\u201d index from Citigroup rose in February for the first time in more than 12 months.\n\nFor risk assets, including cryptocurrencies, a more substantial move by the Fed typically implies a bearish scenario, as investors seek shelter in fixed income and the U.S. dollar. This shift becomes more pronounced in a recessionary environment, which many speculate is either coming or already here.\n\nThe regulatory environment is adding additional pressure for cryptocurrency firms, especially after U.S. Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the White House has noted that the crypto-friendly bank Silvergate had \u201cexperienced significant issues\u201d in recent months.\n\nLet\u2019s look at Ether derivatives data to understand if the $1,560 level is likely to become a support or resistance.\n\nETH derivatives show reduced demand for longs\n\nThe annualized three-month futures premium should trade between 5% and 10% in healthy markets to cover costs and associated risks. However, when the contract trades at a discount (known as \u201cbackwardation\u201d) versus traditional spot markets, it shows a lack of confidence from traders and is deemed a bearish indicator.\n\nEther 3-month futures annualized premium. Source: Laevitas\n\nThe chart above shows that derivatives traders became slightly uncomfortable as the Ether futures premium (on average) moved to 3.1% on March 7, down from 4.9% one week prior. More importantly, the indicator became more distant from the 5% neutral-to-bullish mark.\n\nStill, the declining demand for leverage longs (bulls) does not necessarily translate to an expectation of adverse price action. Consequently, traders should analyze Ether\u2019s options markets to understand how whales and market makers are pricing the odds of future price movements.\n\nThe 25% delta skew is a telling sign th market makers and arbitrage desks are overcharging for upside or downside protection.\n\nIn bear markets, options investors give higher odds for a price dump, causing the skew indicator to rise above 10%. On the other hand, bullish markets tend to drive the skew metric below -10%, meaning the bearish put options are in less demand.\n\nEther 30-day options 25% delta skew: Source: Laevitas\n\nThe delta skew moved above the bearish 10% threshold on March 4, signaling stress from professional traders. A brief improvement happened on March 7, although the metric continues to flirt with bearish expectations as options traders place higher costs on protective put options.\n\nInvestors basing their decisions on fundamentals will likely look to the first couple of weeks following the Shanghai upgrade to measure the potential impact of the ETH unlock. Ultimately, options and futures markets signal that pro traders are less inclined to add long positions, giving higher odds for $1,560 becoming a resistance level in the coming weeks.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "title": "EIP 4337 Activated by Ethereum (ETH): Comprehensive Guide - U.Today",
        "content": "Advertisement\n\nWith the new function activated, every owner of a noncustodial Ethereum (ETH) wallet can dramatically increase its functionality and make his/her experience with Ethereum (ETH) and EVM-compatible blockchains secure.\n\nEIP 4337 goes live on Ethereum (ETH): Highlights\n\nYesterday, on March 1, 2023, Ethereum (ETH) developers announced that the Account Abstraction mechanism included in Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP 4337) was stress tested, audited and deployed to mainnet.\n\nBeing in discussions since 2016, Account Abstraction is among the most ambitious changes of Ethereum's (ETH) design;\n\nEIP 4337 is co-developed by the Ethereum Foundation and a number of heavy-hitting Web3 teams: Stackup, Biconomy, Alchemy; OpenZeppelin performed its security audit;\n\nIt blurs the line between Externally Owned Accounts (wallets) and Contract Accounts (smart contracts) and introduces a new instrument in Ethereum: Smart Accounts;\n\nThis update is of paramount importance for the security, operability and massive adoption of the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain;\n\nBesides Ethereum (ETH), this update goes live on all EVM-compatible blockchains: Polygon Network (MATIC), BNB Chain (BSC), Ethereum's L2 networks and so on.\n\nWith EIP 4337 activated, Ethereum (ETH) users can turn their noncustodial wallets into full-stack decentralized banks. This protects new users from losing access to their ETH wallets due to seed phrase issues.\n\nWhat is EIP?\n\nEthereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) are descriptions for standards on the Ethereum (ETH) network: core protocol specifications, client APIs and contract standards. Major network upgrades are associated with the mainnet implementation of this or that EIP.\n\nEthereum (ETH) enthusiasts submit their proposals for discussion and review; the full cycle of approval takes eight phases. Some sophisticated EIPs caused heated debates and were discussed for years.\n\nEIP 20 (introduction of ERC-20 tokens on Ethereum), EIP 721 (non-fungible token standard), and EIP 1559 (dynamic transactional fee model with periodic token burn events) are among the most crucial EIPs since Ethereum's (ETH) inception.\n\nWhat are EOAs and CAs on Ethereum?\n\nEthereum, a first-ever blockchain network with smart contracts support (programmable blockchain), has two types of accounts in its design. Simply put, not unlike traditional banking and payment apps, an Ethereum (ETH) account is where cryptocurrency is stored.\n\nExternally Owned Accounts (or EOAs) can store cryptocurrency but are not able to send transactions themselves. Users need to authorize the transactions with private keys. Crypto wallets like MetaMask are textbook examples of EOAs.\n\nBy contrast, Contract Accounts are software programs that can perform financial operations. They are controlled by code, not private keys. Smart contracts \u2014 basic elements of DeFi and NFT protocols \u2014 are \"Contract Accounts\" (CAs) by design.\n\nWhat is EIP 4337 or Account Abstraction (AA)?\n\nEIP 4337 is an upgrade of the Ethereum (ETH) network's design; it is implemented as an additional layer on the top of the Ethereum (ETH) mainnet, so it did not need a hard fork to go live. With Account Abstraction, Ethereum (ETH) users can easily turn their wallet into a smart contract and supercharge them with extra functionality.\n\nA \"smart account\" is a new type of wallet that becomes available with EIP 4337. First and foremost, average users will be able to turn their accounts into multi-signature storage. This will eliminate the need for account owners to be responsible for private keys.\n\nImage by Stackup\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation highlights that EIP 4337 will allow the use of the results of off-chain computations on-chain, which is truly game changing for making Ethereum (ETH) feature-rich:\n\nERC-4337 attempts to do the same thing that EIP-2938 does, but through extra-protocol means. Users are expected to send off-chain messages called user operations, which get collected and packaged in bulk into a single transaction by either the block proposer or a builder producing bundles for block proposers. The proposer or builder is responsible for filtering the operations to ensure that they only accept operations that pay fees. There is a separate mempool for user operations, and nodes connected to this mempool do ERC-4337-specific validations to ensure that a user operation is guaranteed to pay fees before forwarding it.\n\nSince the first days of EIP 4337 operations \u2014 as revealed by John Rising, Stackup co-founder and vocal upgrade proponent \u2014 the new functionality has a solid infrastructure background and is available on all major EVM-compatible blockchains.\n\nHow EIP 4337 will change Ethereum (ETH) forever\n\nEIP 4337 has already made it into the top ranking of the most important and ambitious EIPs in Ethereum's (ETH) history. With EIP 4337 activated, the Ethereum (ETH) experience for a new generation of users and developers will be different.\n\nEIP 4337 for security\n\nWhen it comes to private key management, EIP 4337 makes it possible for various users to authorize transactions from one account. As such, Ethereum (ETH) holders can integrate their wallet with a smartphone to streamline key management and add an extra recovery instrument for their coins.\n\nEIP 4337 for usability\n\nWhen it comes to smart contracts, EIP 4337 paves the way for 100% \"gas-less\" contracts: now developers can hard-code the opportunity to utilize this or that wallet as a source for gas payments. Previously, such a design needed all transactions to be authorized with private keys.\n\nEIP 4337 for massive adoption\n\nAll enthusiasts, proponents and developers of EIP 4337 are certain that it will make the user experience of Ethereum (ETH) more newbie friendly. The Ethereum (ETH) toolkit becomes more feature-rich than ever before. Now it enables more sophisticated and eccentric designs that would have been impossible without \"smart accounts.\"\n\nWrapping up: What's next for Account Abstraction in EVM?\n\nAs such, EIP 4337 activation is a major milestone for Ethereum (ETH) in 2023. While it now appears overshadowed by the hotly-anticipated Shanghai upgrade (and its economic promises), Account Abstraction is as important for Ethereum's (ETH) tooling as EIP 721 and EIP 1155."
