        "content": "Arkham Intelligence said on Aug. 30 that the trading app company Robinhood holds the fifth-largest account on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nThe intelligence platform previously identified Robinhood as the owner of the third-largest Bitcoin address, which holds 118,300 BTC ($3 billion).\n\nOn Twitter/X, Arkham said:\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve also identified [Robinhood] as the owner of the 5th largest ETH wallet, holding $2.54 [billion] of ETH.\u201c\n\nThat address begins with 0x40B\u2026 and holds 1.5 million ETH ($2.54 billion). It also holds more than 100 ERC-20 tokens, collectively worth $177.1 million. Those numbers bring Robinhood\u2019s total holdings for all Ethereum-based tokens above $2.71 billion.\n\nArkham noted that the address holds funds in custody on behalf of Robinhood users. Robinhood\u2019s trading model requires the company to back user balances at a 1:1 ratio in line with regulations set by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nThe four Ethereum addresses larger than Robinhood\u2019s account include Ethereum\u2019s beacon deposit contract, a wrapped Ether contract, and addresses belonging to major cryptocurrency exchanges Kraken and Binance.\n\nThe beacon deposit contract is by far the largest of those addresses. With more than 29 million ETH ($49.7 billion), it accounts for one-quarter of the entire Ethereum supply.\n\nRobinhood has addresses on other chains\n\nArkham\u2019s data additionally shows that Robinhood holds funds on numerous other exchanges, including Avalanche ($29.83 million), Polygon ($1.40 million), Arbitrum ($395), and BNB Chain ($203). The funds that Robinhood holds on each of those blockchains are not entirely made up of the chain\u2019s native token.\n\nIn total, Robinhood holds $7.39 billion of crypto in those addresses as of Aug. 30. The company\u2019s earlier quarterly results indicated that it held $11.5 billion of assets related to user cryptocurrency safeguarding obligations on June 30. It is unclear whether this change is due to fluctuations in cryptocurrency prices or actual changes in the amount of crypto in each of Robinhood\u2019s addresses.\n\nSo far, Robinhood has only confirmed to CryptoSlate that it owns the $3 billion Bitcoin address. This article will be updated as Robinhood provides more information.\n\nThe news comes alongside an announcement from Robinhood stating that it will extend wallet support to Bitcoin and Dogecoin and add Ethereum swaps.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "title": "Ethereum, Chainlink and Altcoins Now Setting Up for \u2018The Real Move,\u2019 Says Analyst Micha\u00ebl Van De Poppe - The Daily Hodl",
        "content": "A widely followed crypto analyst says that smart contract platform Ethereum (ETH) and other altcoins are likely setting the stage for a big move to the upside.\n\nCrypto trader Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe suggests to his 665,600 followers on the social media platform X that the digital assets market is following a historical pattern before Bitcoin (BTC) halving events.\n\nHe says that just like in the past investor sentiment and altcoins are currently reaching cycle lows 10 months before the next BTC halving event, which is expected on April 20, 2024, and he believes just like in the past altcoins will soon turn bullish.\n\n\u201cEvery rally is getting sold into, as people want to get out of the markets and tend to disbelief the markets have already started in a new bull cycle. Until the real move happens and people don\u2019t get a chance to get into their positions. That\u2019s why positioning is super important to do that in an early stage, which is when you start to take a look at price levels.\n\nWe\u2019re 10 months prior to the Bitcoin halving. The period where sentiment is the lowest and altcoins are usually swimming around their cycle lows. Bitcoin dominance is peaking, and will not peak to that level anymore in this cycle. It happened in 2015, ten months prior to the halving. It happened in 2019, ten months prior to the halving. It happens in 2023, ten months prior to the halving.\u201d\n\nAccording to the analyst, the Bitcoin dominance chart is flashing bullish for altcoins as the the 200-week moving average (MA) and the 200-week exponential moving average (EMA) are starting to act like resistance just like they did months before Bitcoin\u2019s 2020 halving event.\n\n\u201cA clear rejection at the 200-Week MA and EMA and looking to continue the fall, while altcoins are slowly picking up in their BTC pairs as a new cycle starts. While nobody expects it.\u201d\n\nHe also says that several altcoin projects, like Ethereum and blockchain oracle Chainlink (LINK), have continued to develop during the bear market, setting the stage for massive rally events when the bull cycle takes off.\n\n\u201cAre projects still developing and did something change on that perspective? Well. The good part is that many fraudulent projects are washed out of the markets, while the good ones are constantly building further. Ethereum has swapped towards PoS (proof-of-stake) and is getting Ethereum ETFs (exchange-traded funds) based on futures in a month maximum. Chainlink has developed CCIP (Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol) and I\u2019m not even mentioning all the other progress in DeFi (decentralized finance), NFTs (non-fungible tokens) and more.\u201d\n\nEthereum is trading for $1,733 at time of writing, up 5.1% in the last 24 hours. Chainlink is worth $6.23 at time of writing, up 4.5% in the last 24 hours.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Can you Make Money with Ethereum?: Guide\n\nInvesting in cryptocurrencies can be a lucrative venture, but it\u2019s important to carefully consider the potential risks and rewards before making any financial decisions.\n\nWhen it comes to Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, many investors wonder if it\u2019s worth putting their money into this digital asset.\n\nIn this article, we will explore the long-term investment potential of Ethereum and provide insights into how you can make real money with this cryptocurrency.\n\nAlso read: Worldcoin\u2019s Surge Causes Optimism to Dethrone Arbitrum in Daily Transactions\n\nUnderstanding Ethereum and its Potential Ethereum is not just a cryptocurrency; it is a decentralized blockchain platform that enables the creation of smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps).\n\nSource: Forbes\n\nThis unique feature sets Ethereum apart from other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code.\n\nThey automatically execute when certain conditions are met, eliminating the need for intermediaries and making transactions more efficient and secure.\n\nThe potential use cases for Ethereum are vast and extend beyond simple peer-to-peer transactions.\n\nThe platform can be used for a wide range of applications. This includes decentralized finance (DeFi), supply chain management, gaming, and even social media.\n\nThe demand for Ethereum is expected to grow exponentially. Most likely due to more industries recognizing the benefits of blockchain technology and smart contracts.\n\nThe long-term investment potential of Ethereum\n\nWhen considering Ethereum as a long-term investment, it\u2019s important to look at several factors that contribute to its potential growth:\n\nAdoption and Use Cases\n\nEthereum\u2019s versatility and widespread adoption make it an attractive investment option. As the platform continues to grow, the demand for Ethereum and its native token, Ether (ETH), is likely to increase.\n\nEthereum\u2019s ability to support a wide range of industries contributes to its long-term investment potential.\n\nThe Shift to Proof-of-Stake (PoS)\n\nEthereum is in the process of transitioning from the current proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism to a more energy-efficient and secure proof-of-stake (PoS) mechanism.\n\nThis upgrade, known as Ethereum 2.0, aims to address the scalability and environmental concerns associated with PoW.\n\nBy staking Ethereum, individuals can participate in the network\u2019s consensus mechanism and earn passive income by validating transactions. This transition is expected to drive demand for Ethereum as more individuals and institutions participate in staking activities.\n\nNetwork upgrades and improvements\n\nThe Ethereum network is constantly evolving, with regular upgrades and improvements being implemented to address scalability, security, and usability concerns.\n\nUpcoming upgrades, such as the London hard fork, aim to reduce transaction fees and improve the overall user experience.\n\nThese improvements contribute to the long-term sustainability and growth of the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nSource: CNN\n\nMarket dominance and liquidity\n\nAs the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, Ethereum has established itself as a dominant player in the crypto market.\n\nThis market dominance translates to increased liquidity, making it easier for investors to buy and sell Ethereum tokens.\n\nHigher liquidity enhances the overall stability of the asset and provides investors with more opportunities to enter or exit positions.\n\nAlso read: Bitcoin \u2018Oversold\u2019 For The 1st Time Since 2020\n\nHow to Make Real Money With Ethereum\n\nNext, let\u2019s explore some strategies that can help you make real money with this cryptocurrency.\n\nBuy and hold (HODL)\n\nOne of the simplest and most popular strategies is to buy and hold cryptocurrencies for the long term.\n\nThis strategy, often referred to as \u201cHODLing,\u201d involves purchasing Ethereum tokens and holding onto them. You do this with the expectation that their value will appreciate over time.\n\nBy taking a long-term perspective, investors can potentially benefit from the overall growth of the cryptocurrency market.\n\nStaking Ethereum\n\nPeople can participate in Ethereum\u2019s consensus mechanism and earn passive income by staking their Ethereum tokens.\n\nIn return, stakers receive rewards in the form of additional Ethereum tokens. The amount of passive income earned through staking depends on factors such as the amount of Ethereum staked and the overall network participation.\n\nParticipating in Decentralized Finance (DeFi)\n\nDecentralized finance, or DeFi, has gained significant attention in recent years, and Ethereum is at the forefront of this movement.\n\nDeFi platforms built on the Ethereum network offer a range of financial services. These include lending, borrowing, yield farming, and decentralized exchanges.\n\nAdditionally, by participating in DeFi protocols, individuals can earn interest on their Ethereum holdings, provide liquidity to earn fees or engage in arbitrage opportunities.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s important to conduct thorough research and understand the risks associated with DeFi before participating.\n\nTrading Ethereum\n\nSource: Pixabay\n\nFor individuals with trading experience and a deep understanding of market dynamics, actively trading Ethereum can be a profitable endeavor.\n\nDay trading or swing trading Ethereum involves buying and selling the cryptocurrency within short time frames to take advantage of price fluctuations.\n\nFurthermore, this strategy requires careful analysis, technical skills, and risk management to be successful.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that trading cryptocurrencies can be highly volatile, and losses are possible.\n\nHow Much Can You Make with a $100 Investment in Ethereum?\n\nThe potential returns on a $100 investment in Ethereum depend on various factors, such as the entry point, market conditions, and the holding period.\n\nEthereum\u2019s price has experienced significant volatility in the past, with periods of both rapid growth and sharp corrections.\n\nMoreover, it\u2019s important to remember that past performance is not indicative of future results, and the cryptocurrency market remains highly unpredictable.\n\nHowever, a $100 investment made at a favorable entry point could potentially grow substantially over time.\n\nFor example, if an individual had invested $100 in Ethereum in early 2020 when the price was around $150, their investment would have grown to approximately $13,333 by mid-2021 when the price reached $2,000. This represents a significant return on investment.\n\nAdditionally, it\u2019s worth noting that the cryptocurrency market is inherently risky, and investing in Ethereum or any other digital asset carries the potential for loss. It\u2019s important to conduct thorough research, diversify your portfolio, and only invest funds that you can afford to lose.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, Ethereum presents a compelling long-term investment opportunity due to its versatile platform, potential for widespread adoption, and ongoing network improvements.\n\nInvesting in Ethereum requires careful consideration and an understanding of the associated risks.\n\nBy adopting strategies such as buying and holding, staking, participating in DeFi, or trading Ethereum, individuals can potentially make real money with this cryptocurrency.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s crucial to approach the cryptocurrency market with caution, conduct thorough research, and make informed investment decisions based on your risk tolerance and financial goals."
