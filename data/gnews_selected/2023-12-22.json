We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, BitMex founder Arthur Hayes took to social media to reveal a bold prediction regarding the future price of Ethereum (ETH).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHayes, known for his insightful market analyses, confessed to having received a divine message during meditation, leading him to make significant changes in his cryptocurrency portfolio.\n\nIn a cryptic post, Hayes humorously claimed to have received guidance from a higher power, jokingly attributing it to Satoshi Nakamoto, the mysterious creator of Bitcoin. The message allegedly urged him to divest from Solana (SOL) and express his admiration for Ethereum's cofounder, Vitalik Buterin.\n\nFam ... I have a confession to make.\n\n\n\nI received a msg from the Lord while meditating. He said dump that Sam coin POS, and profess your love for Archangel Vitalik.\n\n\n\nSo I dumped $SOL, and bot more $ETH.$ETH = $5,000 \u2014 Arthur Hayes (@CryptoHayes) December 22, 2023\n\nTaking heed of this celestial advice, Hayes reportedly sold his Solana holdings and doubled down on Ethereum, predicting a surge that would propel the cryptocurrency to an impressive $5,000. This announcement follows Hayes' earlier call predicting Solana's price to reach $100, a forecast that has proven accurate, with SOL recently peaking at $99.6.\n\nRotation\n\nHayes' decision to pivot from Solana to Ethereum may be rooted in his assessment of the market dynamics. While Solana has outperformed Ethereum in recent weeks, with a staggering 350% surge since mid-December, Hayes seems to believe that ETH has more room for growth.\n\nComparing the two cryptocurrencies, Ethereum's performance appears lackluster in the short term, showing nearly 10 times less growth than Solana during the same period. Despite trading at yearly highs, the percentage increase in ETH's value pales in comparison to the meteoric rise of SOL."

        "title": "Has Ethereum finally bottomed vs. Bitcoin? ETH price technicals hint at gains - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s native token, Ether (ETH), is well-positioned for gains versus Bitcoin (BTC) in the coming weeks, based on favorable ETH/BTC technicals and bullish divergences.\n\nETH/BTC nears falling wedge breakout\n\nOne of the main reasons behind a potential ETH/BTC rally is its prevailing falling wedge pattern.\n\nA falling wedge is a classic bullish reversal pattern that forms when the price creates lower highs and higher lows with two converging trendlines. It\u2019s resolved after the price breaks above the upper trendline and rises to a level at a length equal to the maximum distance between the upper and lower trendlines.\n\nAs of Dec. 22, ETH/BTC is trending inside a similar pattern, eyeing a break above its upper trendline. Depending on the breakout point, the pair could rise toward the 0.056\u20130.059 BTC area by New Year\u2019s, up 6\u201313% from current price levels.\n\nETH/BTC daily price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nHowever, veteran trader Peter Brandt disagrees, arguing that the aforementioned falling wedge pattern could be a descending triangle, a bearish indicator. Descending triangles are considered bearish continuation patterns in downtrends, which ETH/BTC has been in for the past 15 months.\n\nETH/BTC daily price chart. Source: Peter Brandt/GenesisFT\n\nSo Brandt suggests that a break below the falling wedge\u2019s lower trendline could push the ETH/BTC pair down toward 0.044 BTC, down 8.5% from current price levels.\n\nBullish divergence on weekly chart\n\nLonger-time fram charts, however, suggest the possibility of a rebound by New Year\u2019s and during the first quarter of 2024.\n\nFor instance, Ether\u2019s price is forming lower highs while its relative strength index (RSI) is making higher lows on the weekly chart, indicating bullish divergence. This discrepancy suggests that the downward momentum is weakening, and a potential reversal to the upside may be imminent.\n\nETH/BTC weekly price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the price also treads near a support confluence comprising a multiyear ascending trendline and the 0.048\u20130.052 BTC area.\n\nRelated: Does Bitcoin's dominance drop hint at full-blown altcoin season?\n\nThis confluence limits ETH/BTC\u2019s downside prospects in the coming weeks, enabling a rebound toward the 200-week EMA (the blue wave) near 0.057 BTC by New Year\u2019s \u2014 also the falling wedge target mentioned above.\n\nConversely, the bears will try to pull the ETH price down below the support confluence, which will risk crashing it to 0.036 BTC, a historically significant resistance level between August 2018 and September 2020.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "Qadir Ak is the founder of Coinpedia. He has over a decade of experience writing about technology and has been covering the blockchain and cryptocurrency space since 2010. He has also interviewed a few prominent experts within the cryptocurrency space.\n\nStory Highlights Ethereum price surged in December due to potential ETF approval and BlackRock's entry into the Ethereum ETF space.\n\nAnalysts predict Ethereum's continued growth in 2024, potentially reaching $5,000, driven by factors.\n\nTechnical indicators like RSI and MACD support a positive outlook for Ethereum's future growth.\n\nIn December, Ethereum surged past the $2,100 mark, driven largely by the growing expectation of the SEC\u2019s potential approval of the Ethereum Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF). This awaited ETF decision stirred optimism throughout the crypto market.\n\nFurther accelerating Ethereum\u2019s growth, BlackRock, a major asset management firm, declared its intent to enter the Ethereum ETF space. Interestingly, in November, Ethereum\u2019s growth rate outpaced that of Bitcoin, with a 13% increase compared to Bitcoin\u2019s 8%.\n\nHere are the exciting predictions for ETH in the year 2024.\n\nLooking Ahead to 2024: Predictions for Ethereum\n\nMany analysts and experts are optimistic about Ethereum\u2019s prospects in 2024. Notably, Arthur Hayes, co-founder of BitMEX, has shifted his focus from the rising Solana (SOL) to Ethereum, despite Solana\u2019s recent 350% surge. This move underscores Hayes\u2019 confidence in Ethereum\u2019s potential for sustained growth and innovation in the crypto sector.\n\nCurrently, Ethereum\u2019s trading value stands at $2,275.86, reflecting a daily increase of 2.84% and a monthly rise of 14.45%. Such consistent growth has led to predictions that Ethereum could potentially reach $5,000.\n\nFam \u2026 I have a confession to make.\n\n\n\nI received a msg from the Lord while meditating.

His analysis points to Ethereum\u2019s ongoing transition to a proof-of-stake model and the promising ETF opportunities as key drivers for its anticipated growth. These factors highlight Ethereum\u2019s resilience and potential to play a significant role in the evolving crypto landscape.\n\nRead More: Ethereum (ETH) Price Set To Hit $3500: Analyst Maps Buy Levels\n\nIn summary, Hayes\u2019 recent actions emphasize Ethereum\u2019s increasing importance and its potential to influence the crypto market in the upcoming years. If Ethereum continues its positive performance from 2023 into 2024, reaching the $5,000 mark could be a realistic possibility. Technical indicators, such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), further support a positive outlook for Ethereum\u2019s future growth.\n\nReady to ditch your SOL for ETH?

        "title": "Inscriptions craze proves stark contrast between Ethereum rollups - Blockworks",
        "content": "The advent of zero-knowledge proof-based Ethereum rollups represents a significant advance in blockchain scalability and efficiency.\n\nOver the past week, their ability to handle a spike in transaction volumes was put to the test with the fad-like phenomenon of inscriptions hitting various EVM-based networks in sequence.\n\nOne aspect unique to zk-rollups, such as zkSync, StarkNet and Polygon\u2019s zkEVM, is their ability to amortize the cost of generating validity proofs across many transactions. Therefore, unlike many blockchains, they actually get cheaper to use as they scale.\n\nRead more: Zero-knowledge rollups get cheaper with scale\n\nInscriptions refer to various forms of data, typically metadata of tokens or NFTs, written to blockchains in a way which can be more cost-effective than smart contracts, as they require less gas.\n\nRecently, there\u2019s been a surge in the use of inscriptions on a variety of networks \u2014 not just Ethereum layer-2s but also Avalanche and Solana \u2014 mainly for speculative trading of low-value assets. This trend has led to network congestion and operational disruptions that have kept protocol developers busy finding ways to mitigate their impact.\n\nIn some cases, those disruptions have been severe \u2014 Avalanche\u2019s EVM-compatible C-chain, for instance, saw the cost of transactions spike tenfold, as inscriptions were briefly responsible for over 30% of all gas consumed.\n\nPercentage of gas attributable to inscriptions, Avalanche in red. Source: Hildobby | Dune analytics\n\nZK magic\n\nTo understand why proving costs on zk-rollups decrease with rising transaction volumes, it\u2019s crucial to delve into the mechanics of zero-knowledge proofs and the architecture of these rollups.\n\nZk-rollups utilize cryptographic methods, such ZK-STARKs (Zero-Knowledge Scalable Transparent Argument of Knowledge), to validate transactions off-chain before submitting them in batches to the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nThis batching reduces the number of transactions that need to be processed on-chain, significantly lowering gas fees. As the number of transactions in a batch increases, the cost per transaction decreases, showcasing economies of scale.\n\nZkSync Era, currently the largest rollup by total-value locked (TVL), upgraded its original SNARK-based prover to one based on STARK proofs, called Boojum, on Dec. 4. It can theoretically handle 2,000 transactions per second (TPS) \u2014 though in practice has yet to see a tenth of that. For reference, Ethereum mainnet averages around 15 TPS.\n\nOptimistic rollup Arbitrum, whose 2021 mainnet launch gave it a first-mover advantage, has by far the most TVL at $2.4 billion.\n\nBoth networks were impacted by booming inscriptions activity within a couple days of each other \u2014 which accounted for about 60% of all transactions over the past week on the pair.\n\nThe phenomenon provided a real-world experiment in Ethereum rollup scaling.\n\nSo what happened?\n\nBoth suffered downtime, but transaction fees on Arbitrum spiked, while zkSync\u2019s went down.\n\nTransaction fee comparison between zkSync and optimistic rollups. Source: growthepie.xyz\n\nThe cost of using zkSync has been in a clear downtrend since the Boojum upgrade was completed earlier this month. The network currently has the lowest transactions costs among all layer-2s, competitive with the fees users pay on optimistic rollups.\n\nBut the response to a surge in demand underscores the efficacy of zero-knowledge rollups in upscaling Ethereum\u2019s throughput.\n\nBy compressing data and processing transactions in batches, many more transactions can fit in a single proof to be verified on the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nA researcher at venture firm 1kx, known as 0xtaetaehoho, noted on X that the network posted 5,566 proofs on Dec. 17, more than double the total pre-Boojum, and did so at a lower cost to the network.\n\nLessons learned\n\nThe traffic did cause problems for zkSync\u2019s RPC services and block explorer, however, prompting Matter Labs to post an extensive thread of lessons learned.\n\n\u201cThis weekend served as an important stress-test and a big milestone on the way of bringing Ethereum to the next billion people,\u201d the developers said.\n\n\u201cFor nearly 14 hours straight, the network handled ~150 TPS \u2014 peaking at 187 TPS \u2014 with an average [transaction] cost of ~$0.12.\u201d\n\nOther Ethereum scaling solutions, such as Polygon\u2019s POS chain, also handled the extra traffic well, even with much higher volumes.\n\nAccording to Polygon founder Sandeep Nailwal, the network notched 18 million transactions per day, while gas fees maxed out at the MATIC equivalent of $0.10, which he called \u201cthe result of months of effort on EVM parallelisation (BlockSTM) and multiple other hardforks which resulted in reduced reorgs and better performance.\u201d\n\nPolygon\u2019s zkEVM has yet to see a significant surge in inscriptions-related traffic, but technical lead Jordi Baylina told Blockworks the reduction in proving costs seen in recent months means it\u2019s \u201cnot the limiting factor for transactions.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you compare the [proof] cost with data availability cost, for example, or even the cumulative fee for the inclusion of the transaction, it is much, much lower,\u201d he said.\n\nMatter Labs\u2019 head of business development, Marco Cora, sees a future of \u201ca little bit of chaos and disintegration, a lot of experimentation, but one in which the best technical solutions will emerge.\n\n\u201cEverybody is doing fantastic work \u2014 all our \u2018competitors,\u2019 they are actually super commendable,\u201d Cora told Blockworks. \u201cEventually we will all figure out what\u2019s the best, and we will all converge there.\u201d\n\nOne thing that Cora says is not in doubt is that zero-knowledge tech is the future.\n\n\u201cPretty much everybody seems to have agreed\u2026Optimism has said it very explicitly, and Arbitrum I think has said it implicitly now that they are looking at it,\u201d he said.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."
