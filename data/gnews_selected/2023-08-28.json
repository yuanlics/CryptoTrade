        "content": "Ethereum uses a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism that involves validators instead of miners to create and verify blocks of transactions. Therefore, validators, entities that help secure the network by staking at least 32 ETH, receive transaction fees, but not in full. They get the priority fee or the tip that users add to the base fee to entice validators to prioritize their transactions. Meanwhile, the base fee is burned, taking ETH out of circulation."

        "content": "The parent company of subscription platform OnlyFans has become the latest firm to reveal its cryptocurrency holdings, showing it invested nearly $20 million into Ether (ETH) in 2022.\n\nAccording to an Aug. 24 financial filing to the UK corporate registry, Fenix International reported that it had purchased some $19.9 million worth of ETH between 2021 and 2022. However, due to an overall decline in crypto asset prices over the course of last year, the total value of its Ether decreased by $8.5 million by the end of November 2022.\n\nAs of Nov. 30, 2022 \u2014 when ETH was worth $1,295 apiece \u2014 this placed the carrying amount of the company\u2019s ETH holdings at $11.4 million.\n\nOnlyFans parent company purchased $19.889 million worth of Ethereum. Source: Fenix International\n\nDespite its lack of initial success in crypto investing, overall, the platform experienced solid growth in the reporting period ending November 30, 2022.\n\nAccording to the filing, the company's revenue increased 16.6% from $4.8 billion in 2021 to $5.6 billion in 2022. Additionally, the primarily adult entertainment platform also witnessed a 47% increase in the number of creators and a 27% increase in total subscribers.\n\nRelated: While Friend.tech booms, decentralized social has a retention problem\n\nIts crypto investment isn\u2019t the first time the company and its executives have ventured into the digital asset space. In February 2022, the platform allowed verified creators to change their profile pictures to Ethereum-based NFTs.\n\nIn June 2022, two former OnlyFans executives launched a celebrity trading card platform called Zoop. Built on the Ethereum scaling solution Polygon, Zoop allowed users to trade 3D digital playing cards of their favorite celebrities.\n\nThe disclosure of the company\u2019s ETH holdings came as adult content creators flocked to Friend.tech \u2014 crypto\u2019s newest decentralized social media platform \u2014 in a bid to cash in on the hype.\n\nBig Questions: Did the NSA create Bitcoin?"

        "content": "DEX aggregator 1inch withdrew over $40 million worth of cryptocurrencies from its investment fund and purchased $10 million worth of Ethereum during the early hours of Aug. 28 at an average price of $1650, according to Etherscan data.\n\nA breakdown of the withdrawals showed that the DeFi platform withdrew 41.8 million worth of Tether\u2019s USDT, 396,000 in Uniswap\u2019s UNI token, 3,120 Ethereum (ETH), and 75,000 in USDC. Additionally, 1inch swapped $10.075 million USDT and USDC to buy 6,088 ETH.\n\nThe reasons behind the transactions remain unclear as of press time. 1inch was yet to respond to CryptoSlate\u2019s request for comment as of press time.\n\nOnchain sleuth Lookonchain highlighted a smart money move executed by the 1inch earlier this year. Per Lookonchain, 1inch generated nearly $4 million in profits in July by selling 11,000 ETH for $21 million.\n\nThis transaction followed 1inch\u2019s accumulation of approximately 17,000 ETH, valued at $26.8 million, throughout the year\u2019s first quarter. The acquisition was made at an average price of $1,569, and the subsequent sale occurred at an average price of $1,906.\n\nAt the time, 1inch co-founder Sergej Kunz reportedly explained that the transaction was to test a new feature on the protocol Fusion Mode. Fusion mode allows users to place custom swap orders without paying gas fees.\n\nThe protocol claimed that the upgrade would help users avoid sandwich attacks, which have become prevalent with MEV attacks.\n\n$15k worth of tokens to be unlocked\n\nThe Token Unlocks dashboard shows that 64,290 1Inch tokens, worth $15,000, will be unlocked by Aug. 31. These tokens account for 0.01% of the asset\u2019s total circulating supply.\n\nPer CryptoSlate\u2019s data, the 1inch token has seen its value drop by 1% in the last 24 hours to $0.2407. The asset is down 22% in the previous 30 days.\n\nAmid these developments, 1inch recently deployed on the Coinbase-backed Base layer-2 network. The expansion would help the DEX users access a layer-2 solution with lower transaction fees, higher speeds, and extra liquidity.\n\nMentioned in this article"

ETH could start another decline if it breaks the $1,640 support.\n\nEthereum is struggling to rise above the $1,660 and $1,670 levels.\n\nThe price is trading below $1,660 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $1,660 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair could start another decline if it stays below $1,670 for a few more sessions.\n\nEthereum Price Turns At Risk\n\nEthereum\u2019s price started a recovery wave above the $1,640 level. However, ETH price seems to be struggling to rise above the $1,660 and $1,670 levels, like Bitcoin.\n\nIt is now showing bearish signs below the $1,670 level but also holding the 50% Fib retracement level of the key increase from the $1,580 swing low to the $1,698 high. Ether is also trading below $1,660 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nBesides, there is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $1,660 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. If the price stays above the $1,640 support zone, the bulls could attempt a fresh increase.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nOn the upside, the price might face resistance near the $1,660 level and the trend line zone. The next resistance is near the $1,670 level. A close above the $1,670 level might send the price toward the $1,700 pivot zone. The next major resistance is near the $1,720 level, above which the price could rise toward the $1,780 level. Any more gains might send the price toward the $1,850 resistance.\n\nMore Losses in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $1,670 resistance, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,640 level. The first major support is near the $1,620 zone or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the key increase from the $1,580 swing low to the $1,698 high.\n\nThe next key support is close to $1,580. If there is a downside break below $1,580, the price could accelerate lower toward the $1,500 level. Any more losses might send the price toward the $1,440 level in the near term.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bullish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $1,620\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $1,670\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "ETH Facing Huge Decision: $1400 or $1800 Next? (Ethereum Price Analysis) - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "Following an unexpected and rapid drop from the $1.8K threshold, Ethereum\u2019s price experienced a significant dip, falling below the critical 100-day and 200-day moving averages (MAs).\n\nThis development is considered a significant bearish sign for ETH. However, the price managed to find support within a crucial range, hinting at the possibility of an imminent consolidation phase.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nThe Daily Chart\n\nA close examination of the daily chart reveals that the price\u2019s breach beneath the 100-day and 200-day moving averages, around $1,835 and $1,800 correspondingly, caused a marked downtrend that eventually landed Ethereum\u2019s value within the pivotal support zone at $1.6K.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that the 200-day moving average holds substantial significance as an indicator of prevailing market trends. Traditionally, a bearish sentiment engulfs the market when the price remains below this MA.\n\nCurrently, the $1.6K support level has proven its resilience in upholding the price, indicating the potential for a recovery and subsequent pullback. However, the recent downtrend has shifted the market\u2019s structure into a more bearish stance, thus enhancing the possibility of a retest of the $1,400 zone in the upcoming weeks.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart\n\nTurning attention to the 4-hour timeframe, it becomes evident that ETH lost the critical support point of $1.8K. This quick decline led the price to find support within the range of $1.5K, resulting in a temporary end of the prevailing downtrend.\n\nRemarkably, this support level has so far demonstrated its efficacy in maintaining the price, resulting in a period of sideways consolidation. As a consequence of this consolidation phase, Ethereum\u2019s price movement has taken on the form of a roughly symmetrical triangle pattern. This technical pattern can develop into bullish and bearish signals depending on the direction in which the pattern\u2019s breakout occurs.\n\nOn-chain Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nEthereum\u2019s price trajectory currently remains in a state of uncertainty, displaying no clear inclination towards an upward or downward movement. Consequently, as the price chart offers limited insights into forthcoming market trends, delving into the futures market sentiment might provide valuable insights into Ethereum\u2019s current state.\n\nThe following chart illustrates Ethereum\u2019s funding rates, a pivotal point for identifying the dominance between long traders and short sellers. Positive values align with a bullish outlook, while negative values signify a bearish stance.\n\nNotably, an apparent pattern emerges from the data. Following a sudden impulsive decline, succeeded by a consolidation phase with stagnant price action, the funding rates undertook a downward trend, forming lower peaks on the chart. This unfolding scenario hints at a lack of interest in going long in the futures market, potentially paving the way for a bearish trajectory.\n\nNonetheless, despite the prevailing bearish sentiment, there remains the possibility of a minor corrective phase preceding a more pronounced downward trend. Should the funding rates assume a negative stance, this could elevate the likelihood of a cascade of short liquidations, potentially leading to a substantial bullish rebound that propels the price upwards."
