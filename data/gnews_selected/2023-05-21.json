        "title": "Bitcoin and Ethereum self-custody rise; investors bet on these areas - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "Bitcoin and Ethereum have struggled to surpass key price levels.\n\nPositive funding rates indicate bullish sentiment among investors.\n\nBitcoin [BTC] and Ethereum [ETH] have recently encountered significant price resistance. BTC has faced difficulty surpassing the $30,000 mark, while ETH has consistently struggled to exceed $2,000. Surprisingly, holders exhibited stronger convictions than selling off and held onto their assets more firmly.\n\nRead Bitcoin\u2019s [BTC] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum struggle to\u2026\n\nBitcoin breached the $30,000 price zone on the daily timeframe chart around 11 April, but struggled to sustain this level for an extended period. Subsequently, it dropped below $30,000. At press time, it was trading at approximately $26,900, reflecting a small gain.\n\nThe price range tool indicated that BTC has experienced a decline of over 10% since testing the $30,000 mark.\n\nFurthermore, taking a closer look at Ethereum on the daily timeframe showed that it reached the $2,000 milestone in April. Unfortunately, the upward momentum was short-lived, lasting less than six days.\n\nSince then, ETH has been unable to surpass and maintain that price range. As of this writing, it was trading at approximately $1,800, reflecting a minor gain of less than 1%.\n\nSelf-custody on the rise\n\nAs the prices of Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to fluctuate, an increasing number of holders are opting to secure their assets. Recent data from Santiment revealed a decline in the supply of BTC and ETH on exchanges.\n\nThe chart indicated that the current percentage of BTC supply on exchanges was at its lowest since December 2017. Similarly, the percentage of ETH supply on exchanges was the lowest since 2015.\n\nAs of this writing, BTC\u2019s supply on exchanges was approximately 10%, while ETH\u2019s supply was around 5%. This decline in supply on exchanges could signal an anticipated price uptrend and future bull run for both cryptocurrencies.\n\nCurrent Netflow and Funding Rate\n\nAnalyzing the Netflow data of Ethereum on CryptoQuant showed that there has yet to be a substantial flow in recent days. However, there were more outflows than inflows during this period. The Netflow was negative at the time of writing, indicating an outflow of over 14,000 ETH.\n\nOn the other hand, Bitcoin has experienced a more notable flow in recent days, but similar to Ethereum, the dominant trend has been outflows per CryptoQuant. As of this writing, the Netflow for Bitcoin was negative, although there had been minor positive flows on previous days.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Bitcoin Profit Calculator\n\nInvestors have maintained a bullish sentiment even with the notable movement of ETH and BTC off exchanges. Data from Coinglass revealed that funding rates for BTC and ETH have consistently been positive across various exchanges.\n\nThis suggested that most investors were placing bets on a future price increase for both cryptocurrencies."

        "content": "DigiToads is a new crypto project with a toad as its mascot. It offers is practical features and presents earning opportunities for users.\n\nThese utilities can be accessed through DigiToads\u2019 native token, TOADS. However, investors are considering the project because TOADS offer more utilities than other meme coins. Moreover, TOADS is growing rapidly, attracting short and long term investors.\n\nYou might also like: PEPE losing investors after NFT scam while capital and interest flow to DigiToads\n\nAlready, over 92% of TOADS allocated for stage six of the presale have been sold. At this phase, early adopters are in profits, outpacing gains posted by top crypto coins like ethereum (ETH).\n\nDigiToads\u2018 success\n\nThe ongoing presale of DigiToads\u2019 native token is proving successful.\n\nThe project has raised over $3.5m from selling 223,956,305 TOADS out of the allocated 272.5m for the project\u2019s presale while still in stage 6, called \u201cLilypad 6\u201d.\n\nConsidering this level of demand, more investors appear to be choosing the token and adding them to their respective portfolios. Since presale prices will be gradually increased through to stage 10, those who consider and buy the token in the early stages could reap more returns.\n\nDigiToads is adopting innovative technology and using a revolutionary approach to combine blockchain with real-world data, unlocking new possibilities for decentralized apps (dapps).\n\nIt also has a play-to-earn (P2E) game \u201cToad-Cade\u201d. This P2E model could appeal to a bigger demographic of gaming enthusiasts that want to earn yield while playing. Subsequently, this may encourage players to use TOADS to access the game that\u2019s based on feeding, nurturing, strengthening, and competing with digital toads.\n\nSince TOADS is a deflationary token, DigiToads\u2019 roadmap suggests that the overall supply will gradually decline as more tokens are burnt. This strategy could support TOADS prices over time thereby appealing to investors willing to accumulate and HODL.\n\nIn addition, DigiToads hosts a monthly trade competition called \u201cToad vs. Toad.\u201d These trading competitions will help the DigiToads team find good traders who will contribute to the DigiToads decentralized exchange (DEX), The Trading Post. The DEX will launch soon after the project builds a vibrant community of ToadVestors.\n\nWinners of the monthly trading contest will receive Platinum TOADS. By the end of the year, 12 winners will have been selected.\n\nPlatinum TOADS owners can access one-twelfth of the TOADS treasury and 10% of all profits made on each trade.\n\n>> Buy DigiToads Now <<\n\nEthereum price action\n\nEthereum was trading at $1,797.20 on May 14, 2023, a more than 50% drop from the $4,400 recorded at some point in 2021.\n\nLosses were even deeper in 2022 due to the crypto winter.\n\nHowever, prices has since recovered, bottoming up, catalyzed by the collapse of FTX in November 2022; an event that lifted other top coins, including bitcoin (BTC) and ethereum (ETH).\n\nConclusion\n\nAs ETH prices slowly recover, trends show that investors, including retailers and whales, are gravitating towards potential projects that can post big returns in 2023. The surging demand for TOADS even before its official listing, as a result, has grabbed the attention of investors.\n\nThe early success of DigiToads and growing market demand for its native token in the presale phase has made crypto experts believe this project can outperform top coins, including ETH, in the weeks and months to come.\n\nFor more information on DigiToads, visit the website, join the presale, or join the community for regular updates.\n\nDisclosure: This content is provided by a third party. crypto.news does not endorse any product mentioned on this page.

Will DogeMiyagi ($MIYAGI) become the meme market leader?\n\nFurthermore, would cryptocurrencies in presale garner greater interest because they are untouched by the current market trend?\n\nThe Great Crypto Cliffhanger: Bitcoin\u2019s Precarious Position and Ethereum\u2019s Fate in the Balance\n\nAs the crypto world holds its breath, Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) price is perched precariously on a stable support level, making it a compelling opportunity for eager buyers to accumulate. After several failed attempts to break free and soar to new heights, BTC is back at the notorious $27,000 barrier, like a stubborn explorer refusing to surrender to the depths.\n\nOh, the drama! After seven days of relentless selling, Bitcoin\u2019s price has finally taken a break from the madness, settling down for a cosy consolidation around the familiar $27,000 support level.

The current crackdown on mainstream cryptocurrencies may have created a void that meme coins might fill, luring buyers looking for new investment possibilities.\n\nThe presale of meme coins is another important factor in their success.\n\nDuring a market downturn, presale cryptocurrencies provide a unique opportunity for investors.
