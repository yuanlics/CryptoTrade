        "title": "Major Exchange Binance Will Support Ethereum (ETH) Shapella Upgrade on These Terms - U.Today",
        "content": "Major crypto exchange Binance has officially announced support for the next big upgrade in Ethereum (ETH), Shapella. According to the latest data, this should happen at blockchain epoch 194,048, which corresponds to the date of April 12. The event will take place in accordance with the exchange's rules, a list of which has been announced by Binance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThus, seven minutes before the approximate upgrade date, at 10:20 p.m. UTC, Binance will suspend withdrawals of both ETH and other tokens from the ERC-20 network. Trading in these tokens, however, will not be suspended. Further reopening of deposits and withdrawals of ERC-20 cryptocurrencies will be done without any notice. Of particular importance is Binance's increase in the minimum unlock count of deposits on the Ethereum network from the current 12 blocks to 64.\n\nEthereum, Shanghai and Capella\n\nThe Shapella upgrade is a merger of two events, Shanghai and Capella. Both involve the release of Ethereum (ETH) from its staking, the only difference being the layers. Thus, Shanghai is responsible for the execution layer (EL) and Capella for the consensus layer (CL). As Shapella approaches, the Ethereum Foundation has doubled the bug bounty, to $500,000.\n\nIt is known that the upgrade will release an estimated 2.9 million ETH. However, exactly how many tokens will come out of the staking and what will happen to those millions next is a big question."

        "content": "Liquid staking is the best-performing crypto sector in the last 24 hours after rallying by more than 15%, according to CryptoSlate data.\n\nAccording to the data, all seven projects in the space soared by more than 5%, with two of them \u2014 Lido (LDO) and Frax Share (FXS) \u2014 among the top five gainers for March 29.\n\nLiquid staking derivatives (LSD) platforms have enjoyed renewed interest following news that the highly anticipated Shapella network upgrade \u2014 enabling staked Ethereum withdrawals \u2014 will activate on April 12 at epoch 194048, according to an Ethereum Foundation statement.\n\nFrax Share leads peers\n\nAccording to CryptoSlate data, Frax Share\u2019s FXS is the best-performing liquid staking derivatives token over the reporting period \u2014 up 19.63%.\n\nFXS is the governance token of Frax Protocol and has seen its price increase significantly after launching a liquidity staking program late last year.\n\nThe total value of assets locked (TVL) in Frax Ethereum (frxETH) surged 31.49% in the past 30 days to an all-time high of $231 million \u2014 equating to 131,970 ETH tokens, according to DeFillama data.\n\nIn February, Blockchain analytical firm Nansen reported that frxETH\u2019s supply grew by 70,000 ETH within three months.\n\nLido remains dominant LSD\n\nMeanwhile, Lido remains the dominant staking platform in the crypto industry. Its LDO token increased by 15.57% in the past 24 hours to $2.43 at the time of writing.\n\nDespite Lido developer\u2019s decision to sunset its staking services for Polkadot and Kusama, the protocol\u2019s TVL rose 6.51% to $10.89 billion.\n\nAccording to Dune Analytics data, the protocol accounts for roughly 32% of all staked ETH \u2014 translating to around 5.8 million tokens.\n\nBesides that, it is also the most dominant decentralized finance protocol \u2014 with a 21.8% market dominance, according to DeFillama data.\n\nMeanwhile, other staking protocols like Rocket Pool (RPL), StakeWise (SWISE), ANKR, and Stafi (FIS) all recorded positive gains in the last 24 hours. Overall, the market cap of the crypto tokens in this sector sits at $3.98 billion as of press time.\n\nIn the last 24 hours, DeFillama data shows that the top 10 liquid staking protocols \u2014 except Marinade Finance \u2014 saw their TVL rise by an average of 5%.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "title": "'Withdrawals are coming!' \u2014 Ethereum devs confirm epoch for Shapella fork - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Ethereum validators will soon be able to withdraw their Ether (ETH) from the Beacon Chain, with the Shapella hard fork set to be activated on the Ethereum mainnet on April 12.\n\nShapella will take effect at epoch 194,048, which is scheduled for 10:27 pm UTC on April 12, Ethereum core developers confirmed.\n\nThe withdrawals will be enabled by Ethereum Improvement Proposal EIP-4895 by \u201cpushing\u201d staked Ether from the Beacon Chain to the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), otherwise known as the execution layer.\n\nIt's happening\n\n\n\nShapella is scheduled on mainnet for epoch 194048, scheduled for 22:27:35 UTC on Apr. 12, 2023\n\n\n\nClient releases compatible with the upgrade are listed in the announcement below https://t.co/I0hSv9lnjz \u2014 timbeiko.eth \u2600\ufe0f (@TimBeiko) March 28, 2023\n\nThe epoch, slot, and time were confirmed following a week-long deliberation between members of the Ethereum Foundation, which was led by Ethereum core developer Tim Beiko.\n\nTim Beiko suggested three epoch, slot and time combinations to members of EF two weeks ago. Source: Ethereum.org\n\nWhile the hard fork will allow for partial and full withdrawals, several mechanisms are set in place to ensure a flood of Ether doesn\u2019t disrupt the market.\n\nThere are now 17.81 million Ether staked on the Beacon Chain. At a current price of $1,776, this means $31.6 billion can be incrementally unlocked over time.\n\nStaked Ether added to the Beacon Chain since it launched in December 2020. Source: Beaconcha.in.\n\nWhile the Ethereum Foundation described the last testnet run on Goerli as \u201csmooth,\u201d there was a notable delay in activation time due to many validators not updating their client software.\n\nHowever, Beiko is confident it won\u2019t be an issue this time, as Ethereum validators will be economically incentivized to make the update for the mainnet.\n\nEthereum\u2019s key hard forks\n\nBecause of EIP-4895, Shapella is considered the most significant hard fork on Ethereum since Paris \u2014 the Merge \u2014 changed the network consensus mechanism from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake on Sept 15.\n\nPrior to that, London introduced EIP-1559 in August 2021, which introduced a base fee that users must pay instead of the old price auction method. While the validators still receive a block reward and tip, the base fee is burned, which is intended to make Ether deflationary over time.\n\nRelated: Ethereum\u2019s Shapella transition is \u2018on the horizon\u2019\n\nBerlin optimized gas costs for some EVM actions in April 2021, while Beacon Chain Genesis marked the first block that was produced on the proof-of-stake chain on Dec. 1, 2020.\n\nFinally in December 2019, Istanbul served to improve denial-of-service attack resilience and make layer-2 scaling solutions based on SNARKs and STARKs more performant.\n\nIf you want to watch as the upgrade happens, you can join @ethStaker, @EthCatHerders, myself and others during the Shapella watch party here https://t.co/ZHWQfMemZc \u2014 timbeiko.eth \u2600\ufe0f (@TimBeiko) March 28, 2023\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation also announced last week that it doubled rewards for any bugs found in the Shapella code. Successful bounties may receive a reward anywhere between $2,000 and $250,000, depending on how \u201ccritical\u201d the bug is.\n\nMagazine: Crypto Twitter Hall of Flame: Lark Davis on fighting social media storms, and why he\u2019s an ETH bull"
