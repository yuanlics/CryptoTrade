        "content": "A pair of Bloomberg exchange-traded fund (ETF) analysts think there\u2019s a 75% chance an Ethereum (ETH) futures ETF gets approved in the US this year.\n\nJames Seyffart and Eric Balchunas say the odds of approval spiked amid a flood of Ethereum futures ETF application submissions to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\n\u201cThe odds of Ethereum futures ETFs hitting exchanges this year have risen dramatically to 75%, in our view, after a spurt of 12 applications to the SEC in recent days. The SEC appears to be changing its posture toward crypto, based on reports of its back-channel messaging to ETF issuers. Also, we believe the SEC would have a hard time in court defending the denial of Ethereum futures ETFs after approving standard and leveraged Bitcoin futures ETFs.\u201d\n\nBalchunas predicts the SEC will approve an Ethereum futures ETF in October, two years after the approval of the first Bitcoin (BTC) futures ETF.\n\nNo US Bitcoin spot ETF applications have been greenlit thus far, though the crypto world eagerly awaits the SEC\u2019s decision on a June application from BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager.\n\nA spot Bitcoin ETF would give investors exposure to the crypto asset through a brokerage firm, much like commodities such as gold.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) competitor Avalance (AVAX) witnessed an uptick in on-chain activity in the second quarter of 2023, according to the crypto data firm Nansen.\n\nAvalanche\u2019s C-Chain, the project\u2019s default smart contract blockchain, saw between 200,000-550,000 daily transactions throughout the second quarter.\n\nAccording to the analytics firm, the figures represent nearly double the volume of daily transactions in Q1.\n\nThe data firm also notes that Avalanche\u2019s daily active address count steadily increased across Q2, hitting a high of 117,304 on June 14th.\n\nSays Nansen,\n\n\u201cThe steady increase of active addresses, coupled with the rise in daily transactions, is indicative of healthy growth within the ecosystem and showcases the flourishing community supporting Avalanche.\u201d\n\nQ2\u2019s surge in on-chain activity wasn\u2019t reflected in AVAX\u2019s price, however.

        "title": "Here's Why Arbitrum Became #1 Ethereum L2 Scaler: Opinion - U.Today",
        "content": "Advertisement\n\nAmid aggressive competition in the Ethereum (ETH) L2s segment, it remains pretty concentrated. Almost 90% of its aggregated total value locked (TVL) is controlled by three networks. Here's how Arbitrum (ARB) keeps its supremacy in this field.\n\nArbitrum succeeds since it remains \"credibly neutral,\" Patrick McCorry says\n\nCryptocurrency researcher Patrick McCorry, former assistant professor at King's College London, is sure that \"credible neutrality\" is one of the reasons behind Arbitrum (ARB), Ethereum-based network's success. Its team has never launched \"official\" decentralized applications on Arbitrum (ARB), leaving space for open competition.\n\nIn my opinion as an observer, one of the reasons why Arbitrum has been successful to date is that the ecosystem did not pick a favourite and remained credibly neutral.\n\n\n\nWithout favourites, it allows anyone to feel like they can deploy on the chain and compete as an equal. https://t.co/fcM5IMVQ55 \u2014 Patrick McCorry (\ud83d\udc99,\ud83e\udde1) (@stonecoldpat0) August 5, 2023\n\nWith no \"favorite\" applications officially supported by Arbitrum DAO and Offchain Labs, any team can come to the blockchain and start deploying \"like an equal.\"\n\nMcCorry's position echoes that of the Arbitrum (ARB) community head, who slammed the L1s and L2s that created their own applications on corresponding blockchain networks:\n\nThe worst thing a chain team can do is start creating their own native dApps or products on top of it. You just end up being in direct competition with teams building on your chain within that vertical\n\nArbitrum (ARB) has never endorsed any applications as its \"native\": All crucial protocols using it as a technical basis are created by third-party teams.\n\nAs covered by U.Today, there is strong evidence that Arbitrum's (ARB) growth is fueled by real usage in DeFi: Airdrop hunters are only responsible for 5-6% of its transactions.\n\nArbitrum vs Optimism rivalry gains traction\n\nBy press time, Arbitrum (ARB) remains the largest Ethereum-based network by TVL: It has accumulated $5.93 billion in liquidity across all of its verified protocols. This is equal to 56.16% of the whole Ethereum L2s ecosystem. Its closest competitor Optimism (OP) is responsible for $2.95 billion, or 27.8% of liquidity.\n\nHowever, in the past week, Optimism (OP) has surpassed its rival in a number of crucial metrics, starting from the number of daily on-chain transactions.\n\nIt was also closer to surpassing Arbitrum (ARB) in the net number of daily active addresses. However, both metrics might only be rallying due to the hype around Worldcoin (WDC), a controversial eye-scanning project by OpenAI's Sam Altman.\n\nThat is why analysts are sure that nothing poses a threat to Arbitrum's (ARB) dominance in the L2s segment it has kept for a couple of months."

        "title": "How Cardano keeps dominating Ethereum despite price decline - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "Cardano\u2019s development activity was substantially higher compared to Ethereum.\n\nADA\u2019s price dropped by 6% last week, but there was a possibility of a trend reversal.\n\nCardano [ADA] has outperformed the king of altcoins, Ethereum [ETH], by a huge margin in terms of development activity. In fact, data suggested that ADA\u2019s development activity consistently remained three times higher than Ethereum.\n\nRead Cardano\u2019s [ADA] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nThis metric has been reflected in the blockchain\u2019s efforts to push out new updates over the last few months, the latest being the Mithril mainnet upgrade.\n\nCardano\u2019s development activity remains high\n\nIt was interesting to note that Cardano\u2019s development activity rose substantially over the last month. Its development activity contributor count also remained high.\n\nA major reason for this uptrend can be attributed to the recent Mithril mainnet launch, which aimed to reduce the time required for nodes to sync with the blockchain.\n\nAfter the mainnet update was pushed, Cardano\u2019s multiple teams continued to work on other projects, which were highlighted in the blockchain\u2019s latest edition of its weekly development report.\n\nAs per the report, Mithril mainnet has been consistently producing new certificates and snapshots. The Mithril team also worked on upgrading the Cardano node to v.8.1.2, fixing the release-preprod network that stopped producing certificates.\n\nThis week\u2019s #Cardano development update is live on #EssentialCardano! Read the report to learn about the latest on core technology, wallets and services, smart contracts, scaling, governance, #ProjectCatalyst, and #Cardano education. https://t.co/6DOQ2DXVMQ pic.twitter.com/P2MUJNmOMi \u2014 Input Output (@InputOutputHK) August 4, 2023\n\nApart from the BASHO team, the Plutus core team worked on adding decentralized governance support, as defined in CIP-1694, to Plutus v3. The Lace team continued the implementation of Posthog analytics and dedicated efforts to add Trezor support and implement the multi-delegation feature.\n\nThe report also mentioned updated statistics of the Cardano blockchain. The blockchain\u2019s total transactions reached 72.7 million, while its native tokens exceeded 8.6 million.\n\nMoreover, the number of projects building on ADA reached 1,271, while the number of projects launched touched 136.\n\nADA investors aren\u2019t content\n\nWhile development activity remained high, the native token\u2019s price action turned bearish. As per CoinMarketCap, ADA\u2019s price declined by more than 6% over the last week. At press time, it was trading at $0.2915 with a market capitalization of over $10 billion.\n\nThe price drop caused its MVRV Ratio to plummet. Additionally, negative sentiment around Cardano also remained relatively high. However, the whales continued to show interest in ADA, as evident from its high whale transaction count.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Cardano Profit Calculator\n\nThe good news was that the bearish price trend might come to an end in the coming days. This possibility was pointed out by Coinglass. According to the chart, Cardano\u2019s Open Interest was declining.\n\nA drop in the metric usually means that the on-going market trend might change, giving hope for a price uptick."

        "title": "Ethereum ETF Race Gets Hotter As SEC Receives 11 Filings In One Week - NewsBTC",
        "content": "The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been flooded with many applications for Ethereum (ETH) Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) in just one week. The applications currently stand at 12, with the latest addition coming from ProShares, a popular fund manager.\n\nThe platform filed four applications for Ether-based ETFs, including a dual Ether and Bitcoin futures strategy ETF, an Ether Strategy ETF, and a short Ether Strategy ETF.\n\nWill The SEC Approve An Ethereum Futures ETF?\n\nThe recent surge in applications started on the 28th of July this year after Volatility Shares filed its application. Ever since, other asset management companies, including ProShares, Roundhill Financial, Bitwise, Van Eck, and Grayscale Investment, have filled submissions, with some bringing multiple applications.\n\nThe most recent application, filed on August 3 by ProShares, proposes an equal-weight Bitcoin and Ether ETF to measure the performance of holding long positions in the nearest maturing monthly Ether and Bitcoin contracts.\n\nAccording to renowned Financial Expert at Bloomberg Intelligence, James Seyffart, ProShare filed four separate applications with the SEC. Bitwise also submitted three applications, while Grayscale Investments filed two applications.\n\nHowever, despite the growing optimism, it remains to be seen if the Securities and Exchange Commission will approve these filings. The SEC has never approved an ETF that tracks Ether Futures contracts, unlike Bitcoin Futures ETFs that have been around since October 2021.\n\nMany market experts have argued that these applications are a mere gamble by these asset management companies, who do not want to miss out on being the first Ethereum ETF in the United States.\n\nETH price holds steady above $1,830 amid ETF race | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nThe likelihood of receiving the SEC\u2019s approval remains slim as the regulatory body has never approved an Ethereum futures ETF filing. Add to the mix the consistent refusal of SEC\u2019s Chair, Gary Gensler, consistent refusal to answer if the agency considers ETH a security. This has further compounded regulatory uncertainty around the network.\n\nIf none of the applications before the SEC get denied, the Ether ETFs will launch 75 days from their respective filing dates. Analysts expect the Volatility Shares ETF to lead the charge on 12th October.\n\nUnderstanding The Difference Between Futures And Spot ETF Products\n\nThe primary difference between futures and spot ETF products lies in the fact that while the former tracks the price of futures contracts, the latter requires the issuers to purchase the underlying assets. Spot ETFs are generally considered more valid since they require the fund manager to purchase and hold underlying assets.\n\nThe current spike in Ether-based applications comes amidst a wave of filings from leading asset management companies, including BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, among others. These companies are looking to offer the first spot in Bitcoin ETF in the US.\n\nInvestors and members of the crypto community remain expectant of the outcome of the SEC\u2019s consideration of the applications lying before it. Whatever decision the agency takes is likely to affect the attractiveness and accessibility of crypto investments, especially for larger institutional investors.\n\nFeatured image from iStock, chart from Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.
