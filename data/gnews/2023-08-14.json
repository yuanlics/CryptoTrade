It provides participants in the Ethereum ecosystem with a standardized benchmark rate for staking and a settlement rate for derivative contracts. CESR can also help market observers and analysts generate deeper insights across Ethereum. It captures all relevant rewards for Ethereum validators, including consensus rewards and total priority transaction fees. The methodology accounts for deposits, withdrawals and \u201cslashing\u201d and reflects the portion of Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) earned by validators. Historical daily CESR rates can be aggregated to address any evaluation period or contract tenor. CESR is administered by CoinFund and calculated by CDI."

        "content": "According to a recently released filing, former U.S. President and 2024 Republican frontrunner Donald Trump holds between $250,000 and $500,000 in Ethereum (ETH). The revelation comes as a surprise to many, as the former president has previously expressed his disdain for digital assets.\n\nThe crypto wallet in question is most likely connected to Trump\u2019s NFT (non-fungible token) collection, which was launched in December 2022. The limited collection has a total of 44,000 Trump-themed trading cards. The entire collection sold out in just one day, netting over $8.9 million in sales. The former president earned about $298,000 in licensing fees. Moreover, the earnings were collected in the same wallet that received the licensing fees.\n\nAlso Read: Donald Trump\u2019s Bitcoin Rejection Followed 155% Profit Opportunity\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s Ethereum holdings are surprising, given that the former U.S. President has previously said that he is \u201cnot a big fan of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\u201d However, given that the ETH has come from his NFT collection sales, it might not reflect any change in his views about crypto in general. Nonetheless, a former president holding Ethereum (ETH) is still a positive development for the industry.\n\nSource: Britannica\n\nThe U.S. Presidential election is just around the corner. On the Republican front, Francis Suarez, the mayor of Miami, and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy have both been very vocal about their support for crypto. Ron Desantis, the Florida governor, has vowed to end the Biden administration\u2019s \u201cwar on Bitcoin\u201d if elected.\n\nOn the democratic front, candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has been very open about his support for cryptocurrencies. He has revealed that he and his family own about 14 Bitcoins (BTC), which are currently worth about $411,432, similar to Donald Trump\u2019s Ethereum value.\n\nAlso Read: X Fined $350,000 For Not Allowing Access to Trump Records\n\nTherefore, it seems that both Democrats and Republicans have crypto on their agendas for the 2025 Presidential elections, which is no surprise considering that Americans are the largest investors in crypto, by number, in the world."

        "title": "Which project will steal the show from Ethereum, the Layer 1 king? - Cointribune EN",
        "content": "Mon 14 Aug 2023 \u25aa 8 min of reading \u25aa by Luc Jose A.\n\nSince its launch in 2015, Ethereum has enjoyed a remarkable rise. The platform has established itself as the crypto ecosystem\u2019s benchmark for Layer 1 infrastructure. The company\u2019s leadership is nevertheless significantly contested. Indeed, with the increased dynamism of the technology market globally, new Layer 1 projects are regularly emerging. Their ambition is to rival or even dethrone Ethereum in this sector. To achieve this, these initiatives propose technological improvements. They also provide enhanced scaling capabilities. Operational advances that generally translate into lower transaction fees for users. In short, they want to do better than Ethereum. But can they? The truth is, it\u2019s extremely difficult to predict with any certainty which project(s) will be able to supplant Ethereum. Admittedly, many of these crypto initiatives are not lacking in relevance. However, this is without taking into account the vast operational network that Ethereum has built to establish its market dominance. With that in mind, we\u2019ll take a closer look at Layer 1 blockchain technology and the particularities of the one developed by Ethereum. We\u2019ll then compare some of the crypto industry\u2019s most popular Layer 1 projects with Ethereum\u2019s.\n\nA look back at the Layer 1 concept\n\nTo assess whether Ethereum\u2019s Layer 1 could be surpassed by other projects, it\u2019s vital to understand its meaning and role within the blockchain ecosystem.\n\nLayer 1, often abbreviated to L1, is the very foundation of blockchain. It is the main blockchain that functions autonomously, without depending on other systems for its operation. It is this independence that distinguishes it from Layer 2 solutions, which are built on top of Layer 1 to enhance scalability and performance without modifying the underlying blockchain.\n\nLayer 0, on the other hand, is the underlying infrastructure layer that facilitates communication between different blockchains. It is a network of networks that enables Layer 1 blockchains to communicate with each other.\n\nLayer 1 blockchains have their own network of validator nodes responsible for validating transactions and blocks. They also use specific consensus mechanisms, such as Proof of Work (PoW), Proof of Stake (PoS) or Proof of Authority (PoA), to guarantee network security and integrity.\n\nIconic blockchains such as Bitcoin, Binance Smart Chain (BSC) and Ethereum all operate as Layer 1, each with its own token, which serves as the fuel for transactions and interactions within its ecosystem.\n\nSo what distinguishes Ethereum\u2019s Layer 1 from other first-layer blockchains?\n\nSingularity of Ethereum Layer 1\n\nEthereum, as a Layer 1 project, occupies a prominent place in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, and for good reason. Its platform is distinguished by unique features that have redefined the possibilities offered by blockchain technology.\n\nOne of Ethereum\u2019s major innovations is the introduction of smart contracts. These autonomous programs run automatically as soon as predefined conditions are met, without the need for human intervention.\n\nThanks to smart contracts, Ethereum has facilitated the development of decentralized applications (dApps). This has reduced dependence on traditional intermediaries, broadening the range of services available in the crypto ecosystem. In addition, Ethereum has played a crucial role in promoting interoperability between different blockchain platforms.\n\nWhile remaining true to its principles of decentralization, Ethereum is constantly seeking solutions to scale-up challenges, in order to satisfy a rapidly growing and demanding community.\n\nHowever, despite its leading status, Ethereum faces major challenges, particularly with regard to network scaling and high transaction costs. These challenges underline the importance of constant evolution of the platform. Other Layer 1 projects are emerging with innovative proposals, seeking to fill Ethereum\u2019s gaps while offering new functionalities.\n\nLayer 1 projects competing with Ethereum\n\nThe cryptocurrency industry is full of Layer 1 blockchain projects. Given the multitude of offerings available, it would be tedious to cover them all here. However, by observing current trends in the sector, several of them seem to be gaining credibility and could potentially rival the current leaders.\n\nTake Cardano, founded in 2015 by Charles Hoskinson. He often describes his project as an \u201cenhanced version of Ethereum\u201d. Focused on innovation, Cardano is a decentralized blockchain based on proof-of-stake (PoS). It offers developers the possibility of creating smart contracts, while guaranteeing fast, low-cost transactions. One of Cardano\u2019s notable achievements is the Ouroboros protocol, the first peer-verified blockchain protocol, ensuring decentralization, security and scalability.\n\nRipple (XRP) is a major player in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Although Ripple is not a Layer 1 blockchain per se, its network, RippleNet, was designed to facilitate fast, low-cost international money transfers between banks and other financial institutions. Despite recent legal disputes that could influence the price of XRP, its native asset, Ripple continues to stand out. Unlike other cryptocurrencies, XRP is not mined, but uses a unique distributed consensus mechanism to validate transactions.\n\nSolana is also a major player among Layer 1 projects. As a public, open source blockchain, it encourages the development of smart contracts, NFTs and dApps. Solana stands out for its hybrid consensus model combining proof-of-history (PoH) and a PoS synchronization engine. This combination enables Solana to achieve an impressive transaction rate of 65,000 TPS, well above Ethereum\u2019s 15 TPS. It\u2019s worth noting that technology giants such as Apple, Google and Microsoft are backing the project.\n\nOther Layer 1 projects such as Polkadot, Everscale, Stellar, Avalanche, Algorand, Solar Network, Kadena and Cronos are also gaining in popularity. Each of them has unique features that attract the attention of investors. But can they overtake Ethereum? It\u2019s not impossible. Competition in the crypto industry is fierce. In this context, only continued innovation and sustained adoption will determine the future market leader. For the time being, we have to acknowledge Ethereum\u2019s hegemony. It is supported by a vast ecosystem of developers, users and existing projects.\n\nConclusion\n\nEthereum, as the pioneer of smart contracts and dApps, has long dominated the Layer 1 blockchain landscape, but the emergence of innovative projects such as Cardano, Solana and others shows that there is real competition for this leadership position. Each of these projects brings unique solutions to today\u2019s blockchain challenges, whether in terms of scalability, security or energy efficiency. So, who will be the next king of the Layer 1 protocol? Only time will tell. What is certain is that competition stimulates innovation, and this can only be good for the entire crypto ecosystem.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program!
