        "title": "Ethereum founder urges self-custody \u2013 recommends use of multi-sig, social recovery wallets - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin took to social media to tout the benefits of using multi-sig and social recovery wallets for self-custody of crypto assets.\n\nButerin said that self-custody is important as centralized entities can become untrustworthy and people can lose their funds without notification. However, he added that being solely responsible for the entirety of one\u2019s security system carries inherent risks that can be minimized by using multi-sig and social recovery technology wallets.\n\nThe Ethereum co-founder said he and the Ethereum Foundation use multi-sig wallets to secure most of their crypto assets.\n\nMulti-sig & Social recovery\n\nAccording to Buterin, multi-sig wallets \u2014 like Gnosis Safe \u2014 should be used for cold storage of crypto-assets as they require multiple keys to sign off on transactions.\n\nUsers can assign multiple people to hold their keys and set up their wallet, so x amount of keys are required for a transaction to be approved \u2014 this could be all keys or some.\n\nMeanwhile, social recovery wallets are a nascent technology being developed recently and are set to become more accessible in the coming months with applications like the \u201cSoul Wallet.\u201d\n\nSocial recovery wallets allow transactions to be approved with a single \u201cmaster key\u201d which can be recovered if lost. Users can assign people to hold \u201crecovery keys,\u201d which can be used to reset the master key if lost.\n\nButerin said that once social recovery technology is made more accessible, he would recommend using it for hot storage.\n\nHe added that both technologies allow people to safeguard their assets in their lifetime and ensure they are recoverable after their deaths.\n\nGuardians\n\nButerin said an important part of using these technologies is choosing the \u201cguardians\u201d wisely. Guardians are people one would designate as holders of keys to confirm transactions or recover wallets. He said:\n\n\u201cTwo key questions in using multi-sig wallets and social recovery wallets securely are: (i) whom do you choose as guardians, and (ii) what instructions do you give them?\u201d\n\nAccording to Buterin, guardians have to be people who will not lose keys and who will not conspire to steal the holder\u2019s assets. As such, guardians should be as decentralized as possible. He added that each guardian\u2019s risks should differ, and people should avoid commonalities when choosing guardians.\n\nHe said guardians could be people or devices, and using one\u2019s device or wallet to act as a guardian does not reduce decentralization and is okay. However, most guardians should not be devices under a single person\u2019s direct control.\n\nButerin recommended using guardians that do not know each other, and where possible, guardians should be in different countries. He said that guardians would only need to know each other in the case of a holder\u2019s demise, and in those cases, these guardians would naturally find each other by reaching out to friends and family.\n\nAdditionally, Buterin said that guardians must be tested multiple times a year to ensure they still have access to their keys and there are no operational issues.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "title": "Coinbase Investors Beware: There Is Serious Cause for Concern Ahead - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Down more than 81% from its all-time high and yet up by more than 88% since the beginning of 2023, Coinbase Global (COIN 0.78%) is in a peculiar position. Benefiting from the recent rally in the crypto market, Coinbase's price jumped significantly in the past few months as a renewed sense of optimism has investors hoping that the worst might just be over.\n\nHowever, there is reason to believe that bumpy and dangerous roads are ahead.\n\nAfter a tumultuous and controversial 2022, which was riddled with multiple cryptocurrency companies going bankrupt, U.S. regulators have ratcheted up pressure on the crypto industry as a whole. This could be bad news for Coinbase.\n\nRegulators turn up the heat\n\nAt the beginning of February, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reached a settlement with the cryptocurrency exchange platform Kraken after alleging that their staking service met the criteria of an unregistered security. As a result, Kraken was forced to discontinue its staking product and pay a $30 million fine.\n\nMore recently, the New York Attorney General introduced a lawsuit with KuCoin, another cryptocurrency exchange. Similar to the SEC-Kraken case, the state of New York alleges that KuCoin's staking products are technically unregistered securities and, as such, are currently out of compliance.\n\nFurthermore, the New York AG took the allegations a step further and claimed that not only were the staking products technically securities, but that the world's second-most valuable cryptocurrency, Ethereum (ETH 1.31%), also met the criteria of a security.\n\nThis is where things could get particularly troublesome for Coinbase.\n\nThe staking problem\n\nTo diversify revenue outside of just transaction fees, Coinbase has prioritized building out its staking services and intends to become \"the best platform to generate rewards on crypto.\"\n\nPotentially even worse for Coinbase is the New York AG's allegations that Ethereum is technically a security. If this is judged to be true, it could deal a serious blow to Coinbase's future profits.\n\nThe reason is due to a planned Ethereum upgrade scheduled for 2023 and Coinbase's dependence on the cryptocurrency to generate revenue.\n\nThe new upgrade, known as Shanghai, would allow those who stake Ethereum to withdraw their funds. Currently, users are unable to do so, and as a result, the number of users who stake Ethereum is drastically lower than other proof-of-stake cryptocurrencies which allow withdrawals, like Cardano or Solana.\n\nIn a recent report by J.P. Morgan, analysts found that around 25% of all trading volume on Coinbase is Ethereum-based. The company generates roughly $50 million from clients currently staking the cryptocurrency. J.P. Morgan analysts continued that with the promise of Shanghai looming, Coinbase could significantly bolster profits if it leads to an increase in users looking to utilize the exchange for their staking needs.\n\nJ.P. Morgan estimated that on the low end, profits could increase to $225 million and possibly even up to $545 million if 95% of retail investors currently using the platform decide to stake their Ethereum.\n\nBut this could all come crashing down. There are arguably too many question marks around Coinbase's Ethereum staking. It's a potentially significant moneymaking project, but regulators have to pin down their approach to this stuff to make it an investable quality. If Ethereum is deemed a security in the New York case and the SEC decides to zero in on Coinbase, it could deal a serious blow to Coinbase's future revenue growth.\n\nWhile much remains unknown in the regulatory environment, it might be best to hold off on adding any Coinbase to portfolios until a clearer picture comes into focus. There are plenty of alternatives available to crypto investors who want a proper stock in the digital asset sector, after all."

        "title": "Who is Thomas Greco? Is the Mysterious Ethereum Adviser Shiba Inu Ryoshi? - The Crypto Basic",
        "content": "The crypto community seems awash with a renewed obsession to uncover the identity of Ryoshi, the mysterious Shiba Inu founder.\n\nOver a week ago, Coinbase Director of Project Strategy & Business Operations, Conor Grogan, drew links between the anonymous crypto founder and Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s Alameda Research, sparking speculation that SBF is Ryoshi. And as reported today, prominent crypto Youtuber Ben Armstrong, aka Bitboy Crypto, tapped one of the founders of Unification as Ryoshi, a claim that the Unification founder has denied.\n\nIn response to the latest speculation, Digital Asset Investor, another crypto Youtuber has pointed Bitboy in the direction of Thomas Greco (at least that is who he identifies himself as), a mysterious figure in the early days of Ethereum.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nNotably, the first hint that he could be Ryoshi is that he appears in a picture attached at the end of Ryoshi\u2019s first Medium blog along with Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum Foundation Executive Director Aya Miyaguchi and two other unidentified persons in Japan. The picture was supposedly taken during Devcon 2019, with a YouTube video from Coin Bureau two years ago identifying him as Ryoshi.\n\nBut first, Who is Thomas Greco?\n\nWell, no one really knows, and those who do are tight-lipped, as highlighted by Digital Asset Investor, who also shared a clip of prominent crypto journalist Laura Shin asserting that Buterin was reluctant to talk about the mysterious figure.\n\nA search of the name Thomas Greco does not turn up much and mostly links to a community economist who writes about alternative monetary exchange solutions like private credit clearing systems, complementary currencies, and local currencies. However, when you add the keyword Ethereum, you will find a handful of videos where the so-called Ethereum adviser can be seen with Buterin or speaking at Ethereum events and articles that cite him as an adviser on the OmiseGo project as well.\n\nIn a Financial Times interview of Buterin from 2018 that turns up in the search, Greco is described as a \u201ccollaborator\u201d and \u201cdeveloper\u201d who Buterin asserts has worked with him for years. In an Epicenter Podcast episode with Laura Shin from 11 months ago dissecting her book \u201cThe Cryptonians,\u201d which also turns up in the search, the journalist relaying the information from Ethereum Foundation members at the time alluded to Greco as a close friend of Buterin who played the role of gatekeeper deciding who gained access to the founder and influencing key decisions along with another likely pseudonymous friend called Wendell Holmes.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nHowever, by far, the most well-put-together account of the Mysterious Ethereum figure is by an individual known only as Kevin, who runs an alternative income blog called Turtle Investor. Kevin\u2019s account is also the first that alludes to the fact that Greco is an assumed identity while also pointing out that the enigma went on to advise on other popular projects, including Polkadot and Cosmos. As highlighted by Kevin, Greco could be seen at almost every event with Buterin from 2017.\n\nKevin is yet to respond to a request for comment from The Crypto Basic at the time of writing.\n\nCould He be Ryoshi?\n\nWhile there is no clear-cut evidence to prove this, it is worth noting that assuming Buterin to be the friend mentioned by Ryoshi in his first Medium blog post, it is easy to see how this argument can be made.\n\nRecall that Ryoshi claimed to have started SHIB with a friend with whom he shared his ideas of a decentralized ecosystem. The friend, who he alluded to as a successful businessman and influential person in the crypto space, helped him write the Shiba Inu smart contract and put up 10 ETH (which he described as \u201cnothing\u201d for this friend) to provide the initial liquidity for SHIB\u2019s Uniswap pool.\n\nFollowing this narrative, it appears to be a no-brainer. However, there\u2019s a catch, Ryoshi claims to have met this friend at Devcon 2019 in Osaka, and from what we know, Greco has been in the picture since at least 2017.\n\nDoes this mean Greco can not be Ryoshi? Not necessarily. It could also be that the supposed friend is not Buterin. Recall that Buterin has denied involvement in the creation of the project. Whatever the case, we may never know. The famous picture of Buterin walking a dog in Japan with other supposed ETH developers remains potentially the strongest clue to Ryoshi\u2019s identity."
