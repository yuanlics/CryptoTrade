        "title": "SEC Delays BlackRock's Spot Ethereum ETF Decision - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "SEC Delays BlackRock\u2019s Spot Ethereum ETF Decision\n\nThe United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has delayed its decision on BlackRock's proposed spot Ether (ETH) exchange-traded fund (ETF), citing the need for more time to review the proposed rule change. The delay, announced one day ahead of the January 25 deadline, marks the first of several delays the SEC can exercise across a 240-day period. This first deadline comes nearly 45 days after BlackRock filed for an iShares Ethereum Trust through Nasdaq on December 11.\n\nBlackRock's spot Ethereum ETF has a final deadline decision date of August 7, 2024. However, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas believes that a final decision will be made on all pending spot Ether ETFs in May, with the analyst giving a 70% chance of approval. May 23 is the earliest final deadline of all applicants, similar to the SEC's decision on 10 pending spot Bitcoin ETFs on January 10. Other spot Ether ETF applications have final decision deadlines ranging from May 23 to August 3.\n\nBloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart expects to see more spot Ether ETF delays \"sporadically\" over the next few months. He also further emphasized the importance of May as the crucial decision date for Ether ETFs applications. The SEC's decision-making process for spot Ether ETFs is being closely watched by the cryptocurrency industry and investors alike. The approval of spot Ether ETFs would provide a more accessible and regulated way to invest in Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.\n\nHowever, the SEC's delay in deciding on BlackRock's spot Ether ETF proposal suggests that the Commission is taking a cautious approach to approving these products. The SEC's decision will likely depend on its assessment of the risks and benefits of spot Ether ETFs, as well as the adequacy of the proposed rule changes."

ETH is struggling to recover and might continue to move down toward the $2,000 support zone.\n\nEthereum started a fresh decline below the $2,350 and $2,250 levels.\n\nThe price is trading below $2,250 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $2,240 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair attempt a fresh increase if it clears the $2,240 and $2,280 levels.\n\nEthereum Price Extends Losses\n\nEthereum price remained in a bearish zone below the $2,400 pivot level. ETH extended its decline and traded below the $2,250 support level, like Bitcoin.\n\nIt even spiked below the $2,000 level. A new weekly low was formed near $2,165 and the price is now consolidating losses. There was a minor increase above the $2,220 level. The price tested the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $2,480 swing high to the $2,165 low.\n\nEthereum is now trading below $2,250 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $2,240 level. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $2,240 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.\n\nThe next hurdle could be $2,280, above which the price could aim for a decent recovery. The next major resistance is now near $2,360 or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $2,480 swing high to the $2,165 low.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nA clear move above the $2,360 level might start a decent increase. In the stated case, the price could rise toward the $2,415 level. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2,550 zone.\n\nMore Losses in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $2,440 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,200 level.\n\nThe next key support could be the $2,165 zone. A downside break below the $2,165 support might send the price further lower. In the stated case, Ether could test the $2,120 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,000 level.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bearish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $2,165\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $2,480\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Image source: https://unsplash.com/photos/a-close-up-of-a-gold-coin-with-the-word-ether-on-it-gWoL3zunCZE\n\nEthereum had a tough time in 2023, dealing with considerable external pressures from regulatory authorities, as well as the collapse of exchanges and crypto-friendly banks that rocked the digital money environment to its core. Binance data shows that the coin has regained much of its former strength over the past couple of months, but a lot of work remains to be done. As Ethereum continues to recover bit by bit, here are some of the most critical changes in the system that could mean prices will continue to change.\n\nCensorship\n\nThe cryptocurrency world is best known for being a fully decentralized environment. That means that no single person or company owns all the data; instead, it is distributed across the different nodes in the system. In light of the recent talks about imposing stricter regulations on blockchains, many investors have discussed the possibility that this is the beginning of the end for the decentralized ledger. Many traders believe that the only reason regulations would ever be enforced is to keep the system under control and switch it to a more centralized model.\n\nSome are concerned that these shifts have already begun to happen for Ethereum. The US government recently sanctioned an Ethereum blockchain program allowing investors to perform transactions without leaving a trace. The OFAC claimed that the program was used by entities prohibited by the United States, including military organizations. Many investors criticized the motion while also saying that the Ethereum blockchain will likely remain immune due to its decentralized nature.\n\nHowever, it seems now that they weren\u2019t exactly correct, and at the moment, over 70% of data blocks are considered censored. That\u2019s an almost 30% increase compared to November 2022, when Ethereum was going through one of its lowest periods. Block builders generally have complete authority over the order of transactions and how they are arranged in blocks, meaning they decide on the blockchain content by default. Right now, Titan Builder is the only one claiming not to censor transactions, but if it did, that means Ethereum could reach 90% in censorship.\n\nRelayers\n\nThe relayers are third parties who operate software that moves transactions from the builders to the validators. Back in November 2022, the numbers showed that over 75% of them had ceased passing along transactions that official authorities had sanctioned. However, this is also due, at least partially, to the fact that there wasn\u2019t a large number of relayers at the time, and the ones in charge of the larger volumes were removing these transactions from the central system.\n\nAccording to the latest definitions, only 30% of relayed blocks remain censored as of December 2023. Five builders directly contribute to over 90% of the blocks on the Ethereum blockchain, of which four have chosen to edit transactions. Several operators have chosen to be more cautious, especially if they are US-based. Refusing to comply with the regulations could attract significant trouble for both the individuals and their businesses.\n\nSolana\n\nThe phrase \u201cEthereum killer\u201d has been used for a while now to designate the coins and blockchains that have the potential to remove Ethereum from its throne. While ETH was never able to withstand the sheer force of Bitcoin and surpass it, it is nonetheless the second-largest cryptocurrency in the world. Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum isn\u2019t known just as a coin but also for the functionalities its blockchain introduced. The system pioneered the discovery and introduction of decentralized finance and apps, as well as non-fungible tokens and the play-to-earn concept.\n\nThis has made it very popular among tech lovers who follow the latest developments religiously. So, who are the supposed Ethereum killers that could replace it? The truth is that different investors and analysts will say different things, with each of them betting on a different coin and platform. However, Solana is probably the most widely discussed of all of them, mainly because it is much more visible and stable than the others.\n\nOne of its co-founders, Anatoly Yakovenko, recently dismissed these claims, saying that the dynamic between the two coins isn\u2019t what it has been made out to be and that it is essential to continue incorporating efficient technologies. Many in the crypto community believe that a multi-chain future is inevitable. Rather than seeing competition as something negative, the outlook instead is to see it as part of the more extensive evolution parameters of the blockchains.\n\nIn fact, some have already begun discussing the existence and emergence of a Solana killer. It\u2019s good for blockchains to collaborate and co-exist, as it shows the system\u2019s potential to continue growing and evolving, as well as expanding to cover different business areas and niches apart from crypto trading.\n\nPrice predictions\n\n2024 is just around the corner, and investors are debating which outcome is the most likely when it comes to the coins they\u2019re trading. There are several price prospects for Ethereum, and whether they\u2019ll occur and when is bound to change due to the different influences that affect the crypto environment. The market trends point towards a bullish upswing set to occur sooner rather than later, and many investors have already started buying more to consolidate their portfolios and see more considerable gains when the prices rise.\n\nHowever, the economic factors and regulatory issues can act as setbacks. The price has been affected by macro factors, especially inflation and interest rates. Even if they didn\u2019t directly cause prices to collapse, they nonetheless caused market stagnation, which affected holdings and caused considerable apprehension among investors. There\u2019s also the possibility that Ethereum could surpass Bitcoin in terms of market capitalization, but that will largely depend on the network updates, as well as whether adoption rates continue to increase or not.\n\nTo sum up, many variables could influence how Ethereum will develop in the next year. That makes it impossible to predict the movements accurately. However, this has always been the case for blockchain currencies, and the investors who have been involved in the market for a few years are already familiar with these shifts. Make sure to carefully weigh your options before buying or selling to ensure you see gains and minimize losses."

        "content": "The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) extended the decision period on BlackRock\u2019s planned spot Ethereum ETF on Jan. 24.\n\nThat notice concerns a proposed rule change allowing Nasdaq to list and trade shares of the BlackRock iShares Ethereum Trust.\n\nPreviously, the SEC was required to approve, reject, or institute proceedings to approve or reject BlackRock\u2019s proposal by Jan. 25, 2024. However, securities laws permit the agency to extend the decision period to March 10, 2024.\n\nThe SEC noted Nasdaq initially filed the proposed rule change on Nov. 21, 2023 and that the proposal was published for comment in the Federal Register on Dec. 11, 2023. The date of publication determines the deadlines described above.\n\nThe SEC added that it has not received any comments on BlackRock\u2019s spot Ethereum ETF proposal. By contrast, BlackRock\u2019s spot Bitcoin ETF proposal received about 15 comments within two months of its June 2023 filing.\n\nSEC still expected to make decision in May\n\nThe delay around BlackRock is not expected to affect broader Ethereum ETF proceedings. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart said today:\n\n\u201cSpot Ethereum ETF Delays will continue to happen sporadically over the next few months. [The] next date that matters is May 23rd.\u201d\n\nMay 23 is relevant as the SEC must approve or deny VanEck\u2019s spot Ethereum ETF by that date without any possibility of further delays. The securities regulator will likely decide on other similar applications with different deadlines, including BlackRock\u2019s, alongside VanEck\u2019s application at that time.\n\nThe SEC similarly delayed proceedings around Fidelity\u2019s spot Ethereum ETF this month. Once again, this will not impact the May decision deadline.\n\nThough it is required to make a decision by May 23, it is unclear whether the SEC will opt to approve the funds. FOX Business\u2019 Eleanor Terrett has reported internal resistance at the SEC while suggesting that some ETF issuers are optimistic.\n\nPolymarket odds currently suggest a 54% chance of approval by May 31. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas predicts a 70% chance of approval."

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nEthereum has notably eclipsed Bitcoin in terms of market dynamics.\n\nSolana has outperformed Ethereum and the broader altcoin market.\n\nThe altcoin market is in full swing, with the top 50 altcoins outperforming Bitcoin.\n\nAfter a tumultuous 2022, Solana emerged as a crypto powerhouse in 2023, eclipsing even Ethereum\u2019s performance. But despite its recent correction, signs are pointing towards a potential surge in SOL\u2019s price.\n\nGlassnode, a company specializing in on-chain analytics, has released an in-depth report exploring these distinct trends and their implications in the broader context of the cryptocurrency market.\n\nSolana Topping Ethereum in Daily Active Addresses\n\nSolana\u2019s user base is expanding at an impressive rate, surpassing even Ethereum in terms of daily active addresses.\n\nAccording to Step Data Insight s, Solana is averaging over 400,000 daily active addresses, while Ethereum struggles to maintain even half of that number. This surge in user activity is a testament to Solana\u2019s growing popularity and its potential to become a major force in the cryptocurrency landscape.\n\nSolana Daily Active Addresses continue to hover at ~400K, slightly above Ethereum. pic.twitter.com/82tnfPI1uD \u2014 Step Data Insights (@StepDataInsight) December 6, 2023\n\nIndicative of Solana\u2019s robust network health are its NFT metrics.

Kohn\u2019s research points to a significant increase of over 20% in Ethereum\u2019s value compared to Bitcoin, a trend that aligns with a renewed surge in the Ethereum derivatives market.\n\nETH Resurgence Fuels ETF Speculation, SOL Defies Odds\n\nThe recent resurgence in Ethereum\u2019s market performance, as highlighted in Glassnode\u2019s report, suggests a potential shift in capital flows within the crypto market, sparking increased speculation about the possible introduction of a spot-based Ethereum ETF.\n\nDespite these positive developments, Ethereum still lags behind the broader altcoin market, underperforming by 17%. In contrast, Solana (SOL) has followed a distinct trajectory. According to the same Glassnode report , Solana experienced remarkable price growth last year, overcoming challenges related to its association with the troubled FTX. This divergence in the paths of Ethereum and Solana illustrates the varied dynamics at play in the altcoin market.\n\n@Solana 's December month-over-month NFT volume growth outpaced other ecosystems significantly: pic.twitter.com/wBr2n3itNU \u2014 Syndica \u26c5\ufe0f (@Syndica_io) January 22, 2024\n\nIn striking contrast to Ethereum, Solana (SOL) has shown remarkable performance, with the SOL/BTC ratio soaring by 290% since October 2023. This divergence is particularly noteworthy as Solana\u2019s price did not undergo a significant revaluation following the Bitcoin ETF approvals, unlike Ethereum, according to Kohn.\n\nOverall, the altcoin market has experienced substantial growth, witnessing a nearly 69% increase in market capitalization since the Blackrock Bitcoin ETF filing, highlighting a general uptrend in the altcoin sector, with Solana leading the way.\n\nAltcoin Season in Full Swing as Top 50 Coins Outperform BTC\n\nRecently, Altcoin Season Index signaled the start of an \u2018altseason\u2019. This trend continues with the top 50 altcoins surpassing Bitcoin\u2019s performance over the last 90 days, as per the index.\n\nKohn pointed out that this uptrend is largely fueled by tokens associated with Ethereum scaling solutions like Optimism, Arbitrum, and Polygon. Additionally, the early part of 2023 saw tokens in staking and GameFi sectors also exceeding Bitcoin\u2019s performance, highlighting a diverse risk preference among investors in various altcoin categories.\n\nKohn\u2019s latest research underscored the significant impact of recent market events:\n\n\u201cThe approval of new Bitcoin ETFs has morphed into a classic \u2018sell-the-news\u2019 occurrence, stirring a volatile period in the crypto market.\u201d\n\nGlassnode\u2019s analysis reveals that Ethereum has come out on top in the short term, with investors achieving a multi-year peak in net realized profits. This trend indicates an increasing propensity among investors to participate in speculative activities, especially related to the potential launch of an ETH ETF and the rotation of capital.\n\nSolana\u2019s Explosive Price Growth: A Sign of Ethereum\u2019s Challenger?\n\nIn addition to a significant increase in its total value locked (TVL), Solana has also witnessed a staggering 800% surge in its price on a year-to-date basis. When compared to Ethereum, Solana has shown superior price growth; Ethereum\u2019s year-to-date growth stands at just 94% . This contrast is also mirrored in the TVL charts, where Solana\u2019s growth, although substantial, still falls behind Ethereum\u2019s, which remains the world\u2019s premier altcoin in terms of TVL. However, it\u2019s important to note that relying solely on TVL as a metric can be misleading, as it may offer a false sense of accuracy and can be easily manipulated.\n\nIn the ring of blockchain, it's #Ethereum vs #Solana ! \ud83e\udd4a \ud83c\udf52 #ETH : King of #DeFi & #NFTs \ud83c\udff0\n\n\ud83c\udf52 #SOL : Speed demon with lower fees \ud83d\ude80 Which blockchain has your vote for the future of crypto?

It is often viewed as a faster, more cost-effective alternative to Ethereum, with an added advantage of superior user interface and experience. The extent of actual development and building on the blockchain is a key factor in increasing TVL, potentially propelling Solana to greater prominence in the crypto world."

        "content": "Crypto markets may have been volatile this week, triggered by a breakdown on Bitcoin\u2019s chart and a retracement in Ethereum (not the start of an Ethereum\u2019s crash is what we said). Consequently, the \u2018Ethereum bearish\u2018 message is suddenly found everywhere which is in contrast to the sentiment and messaging two weeks ago.\n\nWhile some \u2018pundits\u2019 may come out to call for the end of Bitcoin\u2019s bull market, similarly the end of Ethereum\u2019s bull market, we have a different view.\n\nPreviously, we outlined why Ethereum could still reach $10,000 by 2025, though will probably reach the $3,000 \u2013 $4,000 region in 2024. We stand by this view.\n\nSome commentators have a different opinion, indicating that Ethereum could be a bearish asset in 2024, though such claims are largely unsubstantiated.\n\nThe problems with poor quality chart analysis\n\nThe issue with low-quality chart analysis is mainly with the timeframe. In the chart below, there are no structured price patterns and the content is short-term orientated. It\u2019s basically impossible to make a reasoned analysis by looking at a single chart \u2013 especially an intraday one!\n\nYet the fallacies contained within the analysis are not apparent to viewers when reading the content. It\u2019s also possible to take a different view on the same chart and draw an entirely different conclusion. Ideally, a lot of factors will converge to create a powerful signal (bullish or bearish).\n\nPractically all of the content regarding Ethereum on this Trading View blog is erroneous, indicating a drop to $700 for Ethereum. We find that highly unlikely and the charts simply don\u2019t back it up, even amidst a declining overall market.\n\nDespite the majority of false claims, there is some sound analysis. This Ethereum technical prediction outlines that despite a bearish outlook in the near term, Ethereum has a strong potential for a bullish reversal in 2024.\n\nEthereum is not bearish in 2024\n\nThe fact of the matter is that Ethereum is not bearish at all in 2024, and that\u2019s in spite of the Bitcoin retracement which we predicted in this altcoin season article. Our exact words were:\n\nArguably, before alt season 2024 will kick off, it might come with a drop in BTC. In a way, it makes sense that an explosive run starts with a drop. The market loves to mislead bulls, particularly at the start and end of bull markets\n\nWe predict an ETH price rise to $10,000 by 2025, and that\u2019s based on sound chart analysis. Take a look at the daily chart.\n\nThe price to hit for this to occur is $3,525. After this, it would be a 3x to $10k. The weekly price chart indicates a similar price rise for ETH, with a rounded reversal bullish pattern.\n\nDon\u2019t believe the headlines! Ethereum is unlikely to go to $700. And it\u2019s likely to end 2024 at a high, possibly even an all-time high. After all, as we keep repeating, 2024 is a hidden crypto bull market in disguise, with a fake drop to fool investors.\n\nTo truly understand what the market is doing, we have a unique crypto investment newsletter dedicated to finding the best coins at the most optimal entry points.

Next date that matters is May 23rd,\u201d Bloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffart said.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nThe decision comes just weeks after the SEC approved nearly a dozen spot bitcoin ETFs. Three commissioners \u2014 Hester Peirce, Mark Uyeda and Chair Gary Gensler \u2014 voted in favor of the ETFs.\n\nFollowing Grayscale\u2019s legal victory in August, the SEC was compelled to reevaluate its application for a spot bitcoin ETF conversion. Despite this progress, the status of ether ETFs continues to be unclear.\n\nIn an interview on Tuesday, Peirce said that the SEC would \u201capply precedent\u201d to any decisions on spot ether ETFs. She further noted that the agency doesn\u2019t plan to repeat history and face another court case in order to approve such funds.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not holding my breath,\u201d Lara Crigger, editor-in-chief at VettaFi previously told Blockworks about ether ETF approval.\n\nHowever, Seyffart previously said that he was more bullish about the future of ether ETFs.\n\n\u201cIf [Gensler] goes after ETH, it\u2019s not just going to be a lot of these industry players; it will also be the CFTC that he has to contend with, and it\u2019s just not worth it,\u201d he told On the Margin podcast.The delay was largely expected after the SEC also delayed Fidelity\u2019s proposal\n\nIn his press release following bitcoin ETF approvals, Gensler noted that the decision \u201cshould in no way signal the Commission\u2019s willingness to approve listing standards for crypto asset securities.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "Ethereum execution client Geth has seen its market share fall after community members raised concerns over the network\u2019s diversity, fearing Geth\u2019s concentration could lead to a \u201cblack swan event.\u201d\n\nOn Jan. 23, Geth\u2019s market share of the Ethereum network execution clients fell 5.2% to 78.8% after reaching 84% the day prior.\n\nGeth is critical in handling transactions and executing smart contracts on Ethereum, but its preference among Ethereum validators has led to an imbalance in execution client diversity on Ethereum, sparking centralization concerns.\n\nPercentage share of Ethereum network execution clients. Source: Clientdiversity.org\n\nEthereum decentralization advocates, including the founding member of the ETHStaker community, known as \u201cSuperphiz,\u201d stressed in a Jan. 24 post on X (formerly Twitter) that a bug in Geth could lead to a more than 80% wipeout of Ether (ETH) staked on the network.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not trying to convince you that every execution client is as robust or as mature as Geth. I\u2019m just telling you that it\u2019s a good idea to use less robust clients to prevent a black swan event,\u201d he explained in another post.\n\nLachlan Feeney, founder and CEO of Ethereum infrastructure firm Labrys, suggested in a Jan. 23 blog post that Ethereum validators could risk losing everything.\n\n\u201cStaked ETH is not risk-free yield. Would you invest a minimum of $75,000 USD into an instrument where the maximum potential gain is 3.5% p.a. but the potential for loss is 100%?\u201d\n\n\u201cProbably not, but this is what 84% of the Ethereum stakers are doing today,\u201d Feeney added.\n\nAs Geth\u2019s current share exceeds 2/3rds (or 66%), Feeney said a critical bug would \u201cinstantly stop the chain from finalizing.\u201d\n\nIn that scenario, Geth validators that go offline would be subject to an \u201cinactivity leak,\u201d which results in the burning of their staked Ether until the execution recalibrates to a 1/3rd (or 33.3%) share of the network.\n\nFeeney said 90% of a validator\u2019s staked Ether could be wiped within roughly 40 days.\n\n\u201cComparatively, a validator taken offline due to a minority client bug that does not stop the chain from finalizing would lose just 0.4% of its stake in 40 days.\u201d\n\nHowever, Feeney told Cointelegraph there would be a \u201cvery small window\u201d for validators to exit and limit their losses, as there is a rate-limited queue for how many validators can exit per epoch.\n\nRelated: Ethereum devs expect 10x lower rollup costs as Dencun upgrade hits testnets\n\nNethermind, the second-largest execution client, increased its share from around 8% to 14% on Jan. 23.\n\nNethermind\u2019s increased uptake came despite it identifying and fixing a critical bug in several versions of its execution client that caused users to fail to process blocks on Ethereum two days earlier.\n\nCoinbase, one of the largest Ethereum validators running on Geth, announced its plan to transition to a multi-client infrastructure in the coming months.\n\nThe exchange explained Geth was the only Ethereum execution client that met its technical requirements since it started Ethereum staking in 2020.\n\n\u201cHowever, the tide is turning,\u201d said Coinbase.\n\nMagazine: Ethereum restaking: Blockchain innovation or dangerous house of cards?"

        "content": "SEC Commission Hester Peirce expects an improved consideration process for Ethereum ETFs.\n\nHester Peirce expressed frustration with the \u201cCircus-like\u201d Bitcoin ETFs approval process.\n\nIndustry experts have shared differing opinions on the likely timeline of approval.\n\nEthereum ETFs have recently become a hot topic following the historic approval of Bitcoin ETFs by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Despite SEC Chair Gensler\u2019s assertion that the Bitcoin ETF approval does not signify the embrace of crypto assets, investors are optimistic about the approval setting a precedent substantial enough to impact its consideration of spot Ethereum ETFs.\n\nAs the industry anticipates the potential outcome, \u201ccrypto mom\u201d Hester Peirce, renowned for her liberty-focused approach to the industry, has offered insights into the commission\u2019s decision-making process.\n\nEthereum ETF Won\u2019t Get \u2018Circus-Like\u2019 Approach\n\nSEC Commissioner Hester Peirce has expressed optimism about a balanced decision-making process for Ethereum ETF, asserting that the regulatory commission is unlikely to adhere strictly to its traditional stringent approach.\n\nPeirce emphasized that the \u201ccircus-like\u201d consideration process witnessed for Bitcoin ETFs, characterized by legal battles, extensive delays, and security breaches, will not reoccur in the case of Ethereum ETFs.\n\n\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t need a court to tell us that our approach is arbitrary and capricious in order for us to get it right,\u201d she stated in an interview with Zack Guzman.\n\nReflecting on her past frustrations with the delays in approving Bitcoin ETFs, Peirce underscored the importance of providing choices to investors in the spirit of liberty and asserted the need for clear thinking and consideration in enforcing regulations on the industry.\n\n\u201cThere are lots of things that we can draw on, and I hope that we draw in more than just our general skepticism of anything that touches on crypto, which seems to be how we've approached a lot of these problems in the past,\u201d she emphasized.\n\nHester Peirce\u2019s sentiments align with industry predictions on the likelihood of an approval.\n\nEthereum ETF: Approval or Not?\n\nBusiness journalist Eleanor Terrett has shared varying perspectives on whether the SEC will approve Ethereum ETFs and when the regulatory decision is expected.\n\nTerret stated that there is prevailing optimism among issuers and analysts, forecasting the approval and launch of Bitcoin ETFs to influence the SEC\u2019s decision-making process regarding Ethereum ETFs positively.\n\nReporting on the timeline for a potential $ETH ETF approval has turned up a plethora of different takes from ETF issuers, investment management firms and sources close to the @SECGov.\n\n\n\n\u2728One $BTC Spot ETF issuer with an ETH Spot ETF application says they\u2019re confident the\u2026 \u2014 Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) January 23, 2024\n\nContrasting opinions, however, challenge the optimism. Other predictions suggest a \u201chard no\u201d within the regulatory commission, indicating internal resistance to endorsing the ETFs.\n\nETF analyst James Seyffart anticipates a 5-month consideration process for the SEC and has predicted May as a plausible timeframe for the commission\u2019s verdict.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nWhile Hester Peirce\u2019s comments express optimism for Ethereum ETFs, they do not guarantee the SEC\u2019s approval.\n\nThe SEC recently extended its decision deadline for Fidelity\u2019s Ethereum ETF application by 45 days.\n\nBlackRock CEO Larry Fink is bullish on the potential of Ethereum, further fueling expectations for an imminent ETF approval.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nDespite varying forecasts on the fate of Ethereum ETFs, the final decision lies with the SEC.

But in the weeks since, ETH price has turned soft alongside the rest of the market.\n\nThe latest data from on-chain analytics firm Glassnode shows that despite the current downturn, Ether has outperformed Bitcoin (BTC) in multiple areas.\n\nETH eclipses BTC\n\nGlassnode\u2019s latest \u201cThe Week Onchain\u201d report highlights ETH\u2019s outperformance of Bitcoin \u201con a quarterly, monthly, and weekly basis.\u201d\n\nAnalyst Alice Kohn points to a significant surge of over 20% in Ether\u2019s value against Bitcoin, a trend that aligns with similar activity in the ETH derivatives market.\n\nETH/BTC ratio price performance.

Source: Glassnode\n\nPositive market sentiment reflected in ETH\u2019s net unrealized profit/loss metric\n\nEther may be trading 14% lower over the last week, but market sentiment around the cryptocurrency remains positive. This is evidenced by the volume of net profits locked in by ETH investors, which has reached a new multiyear high, signaling significant changes in investor profitability.\n\nKohn said:\n\n\u201cWhile profits taking has increased since mid-October, the peak on 13-Jan reached over $900M/day, aligned with investors capitalising on the \u2018sell-the-news\u2019 momentum.\u201d\n\nPerhaps the most significant indicator supporting Ether\u2019s positive sentiment is the net unrealized profit/loss (NUPL) metric for short-term tokenholders.\n\nNUPL gauges the potential profit or loss of investors holding an asset based on the price at which they acquired their coins.\n\nThis metric has crossed above 0.25 for the first time since the November 2021 all-time high, indicating increasing optimism among holders.\n\nEthereum short-term holder NUPL.

A closer look at derivatives data reveals that Bitcoin\u2019s perpetual swaps accounted for 55% of open interest in January 2022, which has since risen to 66.2%.\n\nIn comparison, \u201cETH open interest dominance decreased from 45% to 33.8% between 2022 and 2024,\u201d according to Glassnode.\n\nBTC vs. ETH perpetual open interest dominance.

He commented that the SEC maintains a generally adversarial stance towards the crypto industry, which could impact the approval process.\n\nAnd how likely is the approval of a Spot Ethereum ETF by year's end? \ud83e\udd14 Find out in our latest interview with Mark Yusko, Founder, CEO & CIO of Morgan Creek Capital. \ud83d\udcac\n\nClick the link below and dive into the game-changing world of Spot Bitcoin ETF approval \u2013 from market dynamics\u2026 pic.twitter.com/yjPnrVLKl9 \u2014 Cindy (@Natasha1s2K4) January 17, 2024\n\nThis perspective is somewhat echoed by SEC Chair Gary Gensler, who emphasized in a letter dated January 11 that the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF should not be interpreted as a blanket endorsement for other cryptocurrency ETF applications.\n\nGensler specifically stated :\n\n\u201c[The spot Bitcoin ETF approval] should in no way signal the Commission\u2019s willingness to approve listing standards for crypto asset securities.\u201d\n\nThis comment suggests a cautious and case-by-case approach to the approval of cryptocurrency-related products by the SEC.\n\nHe commented :\n\n\u201cAs I\u2019ve said in the past, and without prejudging any one crypto asset, the vast majority of crypto assets are investment contracts and thus subject to the federal securities laws.\u201d\n\nBitcoin ETF Approval Opens Doors for Ethereum\u2019s Spot ETF Bid\n\nThe fact is, while BTC is primarily seen as a store of value, ETH serves as a functional currency, facilitating transactions on its highly composable chain. Despite their operational differences, ETH\u2019s spot ETF approval remains a possibility. The growing liquidity crunch in global markets is being addressed by institutional demand for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, which is moving into wallets.\n\nThe debate over ETH\u2019s security status becomes irrelevant once it transforms into an ETF, similar to many existing commodity ETFs. With BTC\u2019s ETF approval, cryptocurrency has entered TradFi and is poised for institutional integration, paving the way for broader acceptance and potential approval of a spot ETH ETF."

Discover SCENE\n\nYou never know when a huge pile of meme coins can turn into serious cash. Early Dogecoin (DOGE) investors know this well, as do Solana developers who received an airdrop of BONK. And the latest beneficiary of a meme coin glow-up is\u2026 former U.S. president Donald Trump?\n\nAn Ethereum wallet that blockchain analytics firm Arkham Intelligence previously tied to Trump, which holds a share of royalties from sales of the official Trump NFT collections, also holds over 579,000 MAGA (TRUMP) tokens. And a recent surge in price for the meme coins means that Trump\u2019s holdings are valued at about $1.1 million as of this writing, as first reported by CoinDesk.\n\nThe TRUMP token has jumped 222% this week alone, per data from CoinGecko, and 689% over the past 14 days. Meme coins are famously volatile and can be driven by social media sentiment and real-world events, and Trump has racked up a pair of 2024 presidential primary wins in recent days as he attempts to win a second term in office.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTrump\u2019s wallet isn\u2019t associated with the creation of the TRUMP token, and in many cases, meme coins inspired by celebrities and public figures aren\u2019t created by the person in question. Instead, they\u2019re often created anonymously in an effort to ride the wave of hype and FOMO.\n\nIn this case, Trump\u2019s wallet was sent the sizable allotment of TRUMP tokens across multiple transactions in August and October 2023, per public blockchain data tracked by Etherscan. At the time of the largest transfer, on August 19, the 469,901 tokens received on that date were collectively worth approximately $5,670, per data from DexScreener.\n\nNow his stash of TRUMP tokens is valued at $1.1 million, making up the largest single holding in the Trump-affiliated wallet. Overall, it holds nearly $2.6 million worth of cryptocurrency as of this writing, including about $755,000 worth of Ethereum (ETH) and $731,000 worth of Wrapped Ethereum (WETH).\n\nIn December, the wallet dumped $2.4 million worth of ETH across a period of three weeks, following the launch of his third collection of NFTs minted on Ethereum scaling network Polygon. Only about half of the latest NFT collection has been minted so far, after the two previous collections both sold out.\n\nThe wallet was tied to Trump by Arkham last year following a financial disclosure notice from the former president, as the wallet receives royalties from the sale of his officially licensed NFTs.\n\nAD\n\nAD"

        "content": "Investors were initially curious about Spot Ethereum ETH/USD Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs). However, after the approval of Bitcoin BTC/USD ETFs, these have now captured their full attention.\n\nBenzinga gathered exclusive commentary from several experts to gauge the prospects for a spot Ethereum ETF approval this summer.\n\nWhat Is The Current Status Of Spot Ethereum ETFs?\n\nTom Staudt, president and COO of ARK Invest, recently expressed confidence in the progression of Ethereum ETFs.\n\nHe cited the maturing dialogue with regulators and the sophistication of conversations surrounding the ETF, saying, \"This is not the same place where we were on the timeline with Bitcoin at this stage.\"\n\nStaudt notes that potential issuers now possess greater legal, operational, and philosophical expertise, partly due to the successful approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nBut skeptics warn of regulatory roadblocks and lingering doubts about Ethereum's classification as a security. At the heart of the debate lies, once again, the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nWill The SEC Play Ball?\n\nAnndy Lian, an intergovernmental blockchain advisor, tells Benzinga that the SEC should act in the \"best interest of the public and the crypto industry\" by making a \"timely and positive decision\" on Spot ETH ETFs.\n\nHis comments highlight the widespread anticipation surrounding the potential ETF's arrival, with both retail investors and institutional giants eager to gain exposure to the world's second-largest cryptocurrency.\n\nBut the SEC had to be \"dragged kicking and screaming\" to approve one spot cryptocurrency ETF, he adds, and there is no guarantee a second one would be any easier.\n\nRead Also: Russia, India Collaborate On Building Joint Digital Economy: BRICS Currency Soon?\n\nEthereum ETFs Could Spur \"Full-Scale, Global Adoption\"\n\nThe case for Ethereum is simple, according to Stijn Paumen, the founder of Helio.\n\nHe paints a vivid picture of a future transformed by Ethereum's mainstream adoption. The ETF approval would be a catalyst for \"full-scale, global adoption of cryptocurrency.\"\n\nEveryday purchases, from your morning coffee to online shopping sprees, could be made with a simple tap of your crypto wallet.\n\nHis infectious enthusiasm captures the transformative potential of blockchain technology and its ability to disrupt traditional financial systems.\n\nEven Bitcoiners Think It's Coming\n\nTerrence Yang, managing director at Swan Bitcoin, acknowledges the inevitability of an ETH ETF, albeit somewhat grudgingly.\n\nHe concedes that legal precedents and the SEC's recent Bitcoin approvals have tilted the scales in favor of Ethereum.\n\nIndeed, as Decrypt reported, analysts agree that Bitcoin's approval has set a precedent: Grayscale argued in court - and won - that the SEC could not approve a futures ETF and reject a spot ETF. Since futures Ethereum ETFs have already been approved, logic holds that a spot ETF would have to follow - as it did for Bitcoin.\n\nSo...When Ethereum ETF?\n\nChris Martin, head of research at Amberdata, a crypto data analytics firm, says an Ethereum ETF should come sooner rather than later.\n\nIssuers will face two major challenges at the SEC:\n\nThe SEC doesn't have the public pressure it did for the Bitcoin ETF which means, they can take their time and don't have to worry about passing all of the issuers at once The SEC is still pushing the security vs commodity stance without any clarity.\n\n\"Approving an Ethereum ETF may impact their current cases against Coinbase Inc COIN and Binance BNB/USD, and may push them closer to defining their stance on cryptocurrencies,\" he says.\n\nPrediction markets agree, with Polymarket rating the probability of an approval by May 31 only at 54%.\n\nShould the SEC grant its blessing, the implications for the financial landscape could be profound. Mass adoption may come a step closer after all.\n\nRead Next: Crypto Trader Loses $250,000 In January, Swears Off Leverage: I'm A 'Changed Man Now'\n\nPhoto: Shutterstock"

        "content": "Danksharding vs. proto-danksharding Danksharding and proto-danksharding are critical components in upgrading the Ethereum consensus layer. These technologies aim to enhance Ethereum\u2019s scalability and efficiency, particularly in the context of layer-2 rollup solutions. Danksharding is a layer-2 scaling solution designed to empower the world\u2019s second most popular blockchain, Ethereum, to achieve its full potential. Proto-danksharding is an intermediate step in the danksharding roadmap. Proto-danksharding, approved as part of EIP-4844, has been officially incorporated into Ethereum improvement proposals within the Ethereum Cancun-Deneb upgrade. The upgrade was activated on the Goerli testnet on Jan. 17. As per Dencun\u2019s testing schedule, the next significant phase is scheduled for Jan. 30, with the implementation on the Sepolia testnet. The Holesky testnet is set to follow on Feb 7. However, the Ethereum development team has not yet disclosed the mainnet implementation date for the upgrade. Danksharding Ethereum aims to make Ethereum layer-2 solutions, particularly rollups, as cost-effective and as fast as possible as the blockchain becomes more congested with users. Danksharding and proto-danksharding are core to the future of Ethereum scaling. Danksharding is one of Danksharding is one of the final stages of various long-term Ethereum network upgrades to maximize the network\u2019s capacity. So far, core elements of this process have included major network shifts, including the staggered transition from proof-of-work consensus to proof-of-stake\n\nHow layer-2 solutions enhance blockchain efficiency and scalability Layer 2s boost and enhance the capabilities of base layer blockchains like Ethereum. For Ethereum, rollups have emerged as a viable and effective layer-2 solution. Layer-2 solutions refer to any secondary framework or protocol built on top of an existing blockchain that adds features that improve the scaling capabilities of the base chain. Layer 2 operates as separate off-chain networks from layer 1 base chains, where transactions are processed and then verified periodically on-chain. While base Ethereum can only process about 15 transactions per second, layer 2s can process thousands of transactions at low costs because of design choices within the periphery network that optimize the transaction processing capabilities of layer-2 solutions. Security and decentralization are still maintained because there is a process where the larger, decentralized base chain still validates transactions from the off-chain layer 2. Blockchain users can interact with a layer-2 front-end like Arbitrum, which processes transactions much more quickly and cheaply than Ethereum. Rollups are a form of layer-2 solution alongside channels, plasma, sidechains and validium. Rollup-based layer 2s like Arbitrum and Optimism dominate transactions among Ethereum layer 2s. Rollups execute transactions on a layer 2 before batching (rolling up) together the information they contain and sending this to the mainchain periodically for verification. This method enables the spread of fixed costs across multiple transactions, reducing costs arising from gas price volatility.\n\nEthereum scalability and the evolution of rollups In the pursuit of enhancing Ethereum\u2019s scalability, a primary solution has emerged: Rollups. Rollups powered with technology like danksharding represent a robust effort to enhance Ethereum\u2019s scalability, reduce transaction costs and maintain the network\u2019s foundational principles of decentralization and security. Optimistic rollups and zero-knowledge rollups (ZK-rollups) are the two primary forms of rollups available. Optimistic rollups are currently the most popular form of Ethereum scalability solutions. They operate alongside the Ethereum blockchain and are composable, which is a critical advantage. Optimistic rollups are called \u201coptimistic\u201d because they assume the transactions they shift off-chain are valid. There is no on-chain proof of validity, and the ability to challenge transactions is built into optimistic rollups to maintain security. The challenge period of an optimistic rollup is the window when users may dispute a transaction they view as invalid. Within the window, they can challenge the validity of a transaction by submitting a fraud proof, which is a mechanism for demonstrating the invalidity of a particular transaction or batch of transactions. Both the sequencer \u2014 similar to a validator in layer 1s, which submits and orders a block of translation \u2014 and the disputer are required to post a bond. If a transaction is found to be invalid, the sequencer\u2019s bond is slashed. If the fraud proof is found to be invalid and the transaction is valid, then the disputer\u2019s bond will be forfeited. The other primary form of rollup is the ZK-rollup. Zero-knowledge rollups publish cryptographic proofs-of-validity for off-chain transactions. Operators of ZK-rollup chains submit validity proofs to the main chain that demonstrate with cryptographic certainty that the proposed changes to Ethereum\u2019s state are due to a batch of valid transactions that were processed off-chain. Optimistic rollups are more popular than ZK-rollups because they can execute smart contracts. ZK-rollups, however, are mostly limited to simple transactions. Rollups execute transactions outside of Ethereum but, currently, inefficiently post transaction data to the mainnet as calldata. This process is set to be optimized by proto-danksharding and danksharding. Rollups execute transactions outside of Ethereum but, currently, inefficiently post transaction data to the mainnet as calldata. This process is set to be optimized by proto-danksharding and danksharding.\n\nDanksharding and proto-danksharding introduce data blobs to Ethereum The optimization of Ethereum\u2019s rollup solutions relies on specific components of danksharding and proto-danksharding, such as data blobs and the KZG polynomial commitment scheme. These technological elements serve as the foundation for enhancing Ethereum\u2019s rollup capabilities. Core to the layer-2 scaling danksharding implementation is the introduction of blobs. Blobs refer to large units of data that are designed to be part of Ethereum\u2019s transactional structure. Rollups currently use calldata to store transaction data. Calldata is imperfect for rollups because data stored in it needs to be processed by all Ethereum nodes, and it is left on the blockchain permanently. This permanence is not always necessary for rollups since they typically only require the data for a limited time to validate and execute transactions. Proto-danksharding will introduce data blobs that can be attached to transaction blocks and will automatically delete in one to three months. Blobs are transactions carrying a 125-kilobyte \u201cblob\u201d payload stored on the Ethereum consensus layer, not the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) like calldata. This method helps reduce the storage overhead and allows the data in rollup transactions to be sent more cheaply, enabling savings for end users (i.e., less gas fees). Proto-danksharding utilizes the KZG polynomial commitment scheme, which is named after the scheme\u2019s three original authors (Kate, Zaverucha and Goldberg). KZG compresses data blobs into small cryptographic commitments. KZG uses a cryptographic technique that allows data stored within blobs to be validated without needing to process the entire blob directly and without revealing the full contents of the blob. This is compatible with the zero-knowledge design used by some layer-2 protocols, which will be used across Ethereum scaling at some stage. That said, danksharding is the full realization of rollups. While proto-danksharding allows rollup transactions to attach one blob to a block, danksharding will expand this to 64 blobs. Danksharding is set to create a huge amount of space for optimistic rollups to dump their compressed transaction data. Danksharding hopes to support an expanding rollup ecosystem and allow thousands of transactions per second.\n\nDanksharding and proto-danksharding challenge the blockchain trilemma For a blockchain, achieving a balance between scalability, decentralization and security is almost impossible. Optimized layer 2s help overcome this trilemma. The blockchain trilemma concept posits that it is extremely challenging for a blockchain network to achieve scalability, decentralization and security simultaneously. The term was coined by Ethereum\u2019s co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, and in his view, blockchain platforms can only achieve two of these three goals effectively. Blockchains often need to find out-of-the-box ways to scale effectively and maintain blockchain transaction throughput without sacrificing security and decentralization. Unlike traditional financial networks, blockchains do not rely on third parties like banks to maintain a record and verify transaction ledgers. In a blockchain, this process is conducted by a decentralized network of independent computers called nodes. A more decentralized network with a larger group of nodes also contributes to security. The more nodes a blockchain has, the more theoretically secure it becomes. A potential attacker would need to invest more computational power to take over a larger network and conduct a 51% attack or network takeover. Security powered by higher decentralization directly affects the scalability of a network, as every transaction needs to be validated across a large number of nodes. This means that as the network becomes larger, more information needs to be processed by more participants. These issues have often emerged with larger blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum, where transactions for end users become expensive and slow during periods of network congestion because blockchain security models mandate a process that cannot be overridden. Ethereum protocol development has prioritized scaling to address these issues, especially given the substantial growth of the network.\n\nOptimized layer-2 solutions empower blockchains against centralized payment giants While blockchain systems may inherently struggle to match the transaction processing efficiency of centralized giants like Visa, layer-2 solutions, such as rollups, optimized by technology like danksharding, level the playing field. Centralized payment systems like Visa can process transactions at scale much more quickly because these networks are closed and don\u2019t require shared consensus. Solutions like danksharding and proto-danksharding are designed to challenge the blockchain trilemma by sharding the blockchain. Layer-2-based off-chain transaction processing is built to enable an increase in Ethereum network capacity, and danksharding helps to optimize one of Ethereum\u2019s core layer-2 solutions: rollups. While both danksharding and proto-danksharding contain the word sharding, neither follows the traditional blockchain sharding technology model, which aims to split up a blockchain into multiple parts. Ethereum shard chains are no longer part of the blockchain\u2019s roadmap. Instead, danksharding uses distributed data sampling across blobs to scale Ethereum. This is much simpler to implement than the more advanced blockchain sharding techniques. This model has sometimes been referred to as \u201cdata-sharding.\u201d Instead, danksharding uses distributed data sampling across blobs to scale Ethereum.

        "content": "Shayan is a digital nomad and a professional journalist. He delivers high-quality engaging articles to Coinpedia through his in-depth research and analysis.\n\nEthereum has seen a considerable decline in recent hours, following Bitcoin\u2019s struggle to keep its momentum within the $38K-$40K mark. This situation has plunged Ethereum\u2019s market dominance, as it finds difficulty in attracting buyers around its support levels. Currently, the market behavior hints at a further decline as a crucial on-chain metric shows selling opportunities. As a result, there\u2019s a bearish threat for ETH price as it could record another dip in the coming hours.\n\nProfitable Addresses Look For Selling Opportunities\n\nRecently, Ethereum (ETH) witnessed a notable price fall from its peak of $2,400, now targeting the $2,100 level. This shift resulted in a wave of long position closures. According to Coinglass, Ethereum faced total liquidations over $77 million, with bullish traders contributing to approximately $70 million in liquidations, contrasted with about $7 million from bearish traders. This trend has established a stronger resistance near the $2,400 level due to continuous bearish pressure.\n\nYet, the potential for an even greater decline in ETH\u2019s price looms, as a key on-chain metric suggests a correction. Data from IntoTheBlock shows that the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio, an important indicator, points to a significant sell-off opportunity for Ethereum, particularly with its recent drop toward $2,100.\n\nCurrently, the MVRV ratio is at 1.49, suggesting that Ethereum\u2019s market value significantly surpasses its realized value, or the value at the last transaction. This gap may lure traders to realize profits by selling their Ethereum holdings.\n\nAlso Read: Will Bitcoin Price Crash Again? Grayscale\u2019s $335M Coinbase Transfer Sparks Concern\n\nThe ETH price tends to stabilize around a MVRV of 1.1, which could indicate a potential further decrease in its value. Meanwhile, the long/short ratio is showing signs of activity, trading at 1.1993, with 54.5% of positions anticipating a price increase and 45.5% predicting a drop.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next For ETH Price?\n\nEfforts by bulls to push Ethereum past the $2,400 resistance were met with resistance, evident from a significant decline in the price chart. This led to a sharp crash in Ethereum\u2019s price, falling below its moving averages and is now aiming to drop below $2,100. Currently, ETH is trading at $2,209, a 6.7% decrease from yesterday\u2019s rate.\n\nEthereum\u2019s price faces a significant test at $2,100 as it recently dropped below the ascending support line. However, buyers continue to defend the price and have quickly triggered a rebound above $2,200. Holding below this could strengthen bearish control, potentially bringing ETH down to the $2,000-$2,100 support area. However, a notable accumulation might be expected near that level.\n\nThe recent price behavior suggests ETH might fluctuate between $2,100 and $2,400 for quite some time. However, a break below $2,100 might send the price below the psychological level of $2K. On the other hand, a rebound and close above the EMA20 trend line might send the price toward $2,400 and then to $2,700."

        "title": "SEC has a 'hard no' stance on spot Ethereum ETFs, but issuers are optimistic: FOX reporter - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "FOX Business reporter Eleanor Terrett reported a wide range of expectations regarding spot Ethereum ETF approvals on Jan. 23.\n\nNotably, Terrett suggested that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is opposed to approving a spot Ethereum ETF. She said:\n\n\u201cAnother source tells me the line at the SEC at this very moment is a \u2018hard no\u2019 and there\u2019s currently \u2018some internal resistance\u2019 to the idea.\u201d\n\nTerrett did not state whether that source is a member of the SEC itself or a member of an asset manager seeking approval from the SEC.\n\nTerrett also noted that SEC commissioner Hester Peirce, known for her pro-cryptocurrency stances, has advocated for a more straightforward decision process. The SEC in part approved spot Bitcoin ETFs because one applicant, Grayscale, obtained a legal victory, as SEC chair Gary Gensler explained in a statement. Peirce criticized that approach in an interview with crypto news platform Coinage today, as she said that ETF approvals should involve \u201cregular way consideration\u201d rather than court cases compelling action.\n\nTerrett concluded that further indications of the SEC\u2019s stance will emerge in the coming months as it becomes clear whether it engages with S-1 registration statements. The SEC typically posts notices of meetings with asset managers and exchanges on each ETF\u2019s page as they occur.\n\nAsset managers appear to be optimistic\n\nDespite resistance within the SEC, Terrett suggested that the asset managers responsible for issuing each fund are optimistic about approval.\n\nAccording to Terrett:\n\n\u201c[One] issuer with an ETH Spot ETF application says they\u2019re confident the approval and smooth launch of the Bitcoin spots will compel the [SEC] to approve ETH spot ETFs.\u201d\n\nAnother unnamed issuer said that they expect a spot Ethereum ETF to launch by the end of the summer because of the SEC\u2019s earlier approval of Ethereum futures ETFs, and because of BlackRock\u2019s strong ETF approval record.\n\nThat source also cited the CFTC comments suggesting Ethereum is a commodity, as well as Ripple\u2019s partial legal victory against the SEC, as factors that could more broadly prevent the SEC from labeling crypto assets as securities. However, it is not clear that those developments will directly impact spot Ethereum ETF approvals in the coming months.\n\nPublic expectations around approval vary. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas posits a 70% chance that an spot Ethereum ETF will be approved in May, while JP Morgan executive Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou has predicted a 50% chance of approval. Polymarket odds suggest a 53% chance of approval."

A multi-client approach, where the network is supported by different software clients, is considered a best practice as it helps to prevent any single point of failure.\n\nImportance of multi-client staking environments\n\nIn a staking environment, nodes run clients to participate in blockchain consensus. A single-client staking setup refers to a situation where all, or the majority of, nodes run the same client software. This poses a systemic risk to the network:\n\nConsensus bugs: If a consensus bug appears in the single client, it could lead to a significant portion of the network failing or splitting into different forks, as all nodes would be affected simultaneously.\n\nCentralization risk: A single-client setup can lead to centralization, where the development and maintenance of the network are dependent on a single team or company.\n\nSecurity weaknesses: Homogeneity in clients can lead to uniform security vulnerabilities that could be exploited network-wide.\n\nTransitioning to a multi-client environment diversifies these risks by ensuring that no single bug or exploit can affect the entire network, improving the resilience and stability of the network."

        "content": "ETHEREUM'S DIVERSITY PROBLEM. In the blockchain tech context, \"client diversity\" refers to the goal of having multiple software programs \u2013 known as \"clients\" \u2013 available for node operators and validators to access networks; as the thinking goes, if one of these clients goes down, due to a bug or some other mishap, there are plenty of other clients that would remain largely unaffected, preserving the blockchain's uptime. Ethereum's problem , based on a debate that erupted on the social-media platform X over the past few days, is that it's heavily reliant on the client software Geth, which powers around 85% of the blockchain's validators . As our Sam Kessler reported this week , a bug on the \"minority\" client software Nethermind, which powers around 8% of the validators that operate Ethereum, knocked out a chunk of those operators on Sunday. Since the share was relatively small, the blockchain kept running as designed. But some experts took the opportunity to point out how bad things could have gotten if Geth had gone out. Cygaar, a crypto educator, noted in an X post that \"Ethereum has terrible client diversity,\" adding that, \"A critical issue in Geth can lead to potentially millions of ETH being destroyed from validators running Geth.\" DCinvestor, a pseudonymous crypto investor with a large social media following, claimed in an X post that they were pulling their staked funds from Coinbase until the company switches its validator operations to a system that relies less on the Geth client: \"I can't ignore the risks.\" Per the website, ClientDiversity.org , which billboards the mantra, \"Diversify Now,\" the goal is for no individual client software to have more than a 33% market share."

        "title": "Polygon May Struggle To Match the Surge of Retik Finance and Ethereum - DailyCoin",
        "content": "Retik Finance and Ethereum as these platforms make significant strides in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. While Retik Finance showcases rapid fundraising success and innovative features, Ethereum remains a stalwart with its imminent 2.0 upgrade. Amidst these surges, Polygon, known for its commitment to scalability and interoperability, faces challenges in keeping pace. Lets explore the unique strengths of Retik Finance and Ethereum, analyzing the potential obstacles that Polygon might encounter in the fast-evolving world of cryptocurrencies.\n\nRetik Finance (RETIK)\n\nRetik Finance has swiftly carved its niche in the DeFi sector, introducing a range of innovative features that redefine global transactions. With Futuristic DeFi Debit Cards, Smart Crypto Payment Gateways, AI-Powered Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Lending, and a Multi-Chain Non-Custodial Highly Secured DeFi Wallet, Retik Finance offers a comprehensive approach to financial solutions. The project\u2019s ability to raise $1 million in just nine days and nearly $6 million in less than a month underscores its rapid momentum and robust community support. Retik Finance has raised over $8.34 million in total.\n\nEthereum (ETH)\n\nEthereum, a pioneer in smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps), remains a cornerstone of the cryptocurrency industry. With its imminent Ethereum 2.0 upgrade, designed to address scalability concerns and enhance sustainability through a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, Ethereum continues to set the standard. The platform\u2019s thriving ecosystem, diverse range of DApps, and widespread adoption contribute to its enduring influence.\n\nChallenges for Polygon in the Face of Retik Finance and Ethereum\u2019s Momentum\n\nCompetition in DeFi Innovation: Retik Finance\u2019s introduction of novel DeFi features, including privacy-centric solutions and rapid fundraising success, intensifies the competition in the DeFi space. Polygon may find it challenging to match the uniqueness and momentum Retik Finance brings to the table.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Dominance: Ethereum\u2019s established reputation and ongoing upgrades, particularly the imminent Ethereum 2.0, pose challenges for Polygon. As Ethereum addresses scalability concerns, Polygon may need to strategically position itself to stand out in a market where Ethereum remains a dominant force.\n\nRapid Fundraising Success of Retik Finance: Retik Finance\u2019s ability to swiftly raise substantial funds reflects community trust and interest. Polygon may face challenges in capturing the same level of attention, especially as Retik Finance introduces innovative features that resonate with the evolving demands of the crypto community.\n\nPrivacy-Centric Approach of Retik Finance: Retik Finance\u2019s emphasis on user privacy, offering anonymous transactions without the need for Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures, adds a unique dimension. Polygon may need to explore avenues to differentiate itself in terms of user privacy and security.\n\nForming strategic partnerships within the crypto space can enhance Polygon\u2019s visibility and credibility. Collaborating with projects that align with Polygon\u2019s values and goals can contribute to its growth. As Retik Finance and Ethereum lead the charge in the cryptocurrency landscape, Polygon faces challenges in maintaining a comparable level of momentum. The competition in DeFi innovation, Ethereum\u2019s enduring dominance, and the rapid success of Retik Finance present hurdles for Polygon to navigate.However, by strategically positioning itself, emphasizing unique features, fostering community engagement, and exploring strategic partnerships, Polygon can navigate these challenges and contribute to the diverse and dynamic ecosystem of blockchain solutions. The coming months will be pivotal for Polygon as it adapts to the evolving dynamics of the cryptocurrency market.\n\nAbout Retik Finance\n\nRetik Finance (RETIK) is a cutting-edge decentralized finance (DeFi) project revolutionizing global transactions with its innovative suite of financial solutions. Introducing futuristic DeFi Debit Cards, a Smart Crypto Payment Gateway, AI-powered Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending, and a Multi-Chain Non-Custodial Highly Secured DeFi Wallet.\n\nVisit the links below for more information about Retik Finance (RETIK):\n\nWebsite: https://retik.com\n\nWhitepaper: https://retik.com/retik-whitepaper.pdf\n\nLinktree: https://linktr.ee/retikfinance"

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) has seen another leg down over the past 24 hours, shedding 4% of its value as the bears maintain control of the market.\n\nETH now trades around $2,230 \u2013 17% below its local high of $2,710 set on January 12.\n\nHowever, while Ethereum struggles, the Bitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX) presale continues gaining momentum and has now raised a staggering $9.1 million in funding.\n\nEthereum Extends Losses as Selling Pressure Mounts\n\nETH has closed in the red for four straight days, dropping below the 50-day exponential moving average (EMA) in that time frame.\n\nThe token is now trading at the same level it was during the first week of January, right before its 25% surge.\n\nWhile ETH\u2019s price has been dropping, trading volumes have increased by 26%, hitting $16.6 million in the past day.\n\nThis suggests that crypto traders are actively selling ETH at current levels, prompting additional downside momentum.\n\nThe next potential support for ETH is located around $2,150, which held firm throughout most of December.\n\nHowever, if ETH were to break this level, it could result in a further 10% drop to the next support region at $1,900.\n\nWith the Crypto Fear & Greed Index dropping to a value of 48, there\u2019s a growing belief among traders that a decline like this could be on the cards \u2013 especially given the bearish pressure seen throughout the rest of the crypto market.\n\nSpot Ethereum ETF Hopes Face Regulatory Resistance from the SEC\n\nWhile Ethereum\u2019s price woes have dampened sentiment recently, there is a potential catalyst on the horizon that could give ETH a significant boost.\n\nNumerous companies have filed applications with the SEC for a spot ETH ETF in the US, and approval would allow mainstream investors easy access to Ethereum exposure for the first time.\n\nHowever, the prospects of such an ETF being launched remain uncertain, with SEC Chair Gary Gensler remaining tight-lipped.\n\nMoreover, while spot Bitcoin ETFs were approved earlier this year, Gensler stated this does not indicate a willingness to green-light other crypto funds.\n\nThe first decision deadlines fall in May 2024, with additional rulings on other applications expected over the summer.\n\nIf a spot ETH ETF was approved, analysts predict it could have a massive impact on the token\u2019s value.\n\nNevertheless, with clarity on the matter still months away, Ethereum holders may have to brace for further downside in the interim.\n\nRevolutionary Bitcoin Minetrix Defies Bear Trend with Stake-to-Mine Innovation\n\nWhile the markets wait to see if Ethereum can bounce back or gain momentum from a potential ETF approval, some crypto projects are powering forward despite the bearish sentiment.\n\nOne example is Bitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX), an innovative platform offering a \u201cStake-to-Mine\u201d mechanism for earning Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin Minetrix allows users to stake its native token to earn mining credits.\n\nThese credits provide access to the project\u2019s cloud mining operation, enabling stakers to generate BTC payouts without purchasing or maintaining hardware.\n\nIn addition, BTCMTX offers staking rewards of 72% per year for simply holding the token.\n\nThis provides compounding passive income, allowing users to accumulate more BTCMTX to boost their mining earnings.\n\nUnsurprisingly, this dual-reward mechanism has driven significant interest in the ongoing BTCMTX presale event and helped the project\u2019s Twitter account reach 18,800 followers.\n\nBTCMTX has even been referenced by high-profile YouTubers like Austin Hilton, who endorsed the token to his 244,000 followers.\n\nWhile macro conditions weigh on major cryptos like Ethereum, Bitcoin Minetrix demonstrates projects with innovative use cases can still thrive.\n\nEarly investors can buy BTCMTX tokens through the presale for just $0.013 \u2013 although this price is only available for two more days before increasing.\n\nVisit Bitcoin Minetrix Presale\n\nDisclaimer: The above article is sponsored content; it\u2019s written by a third party.

This latest development comes as part of Celsius' ongoing efforts to meet its financial obligations and settle with creditors, even as it holds a considerable Ethereum reserve.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to a recent tweet from Lookonchain, a prominent blockchain analytics firm, the Celsius wallet deposited 18,000 ETH ($40 million) to Coinbase just 12 hours ago. This follows a pattern of consistent Ethereum deposits by Celsius, totaling a staggering $280,760 ETH ($621 million) to various platforms including Coinbase, FalconX and OKX since Nov. 13.\n\nThe accumulated Ethereum holding for Celsius currently stands at an impressive 540,029 ETH, equivalent to a valuation of around $1.2 billion. Arkham Intelligence, another blockchain analytics provider, revealed that Celsius engaged in Ethereum sales amounting to more than $125 million between Jan. 8 and Jan. 12. These sales are part of a strategic plan to satisfy outstanding debts and fulfill the requirements of the ongoing bankruptcy proceedings.\n\nEthereum price movements\n\nThe current market price of Ethereum stands at $2,259, reflecting a 1.42% increase over the last 24 hours. However, the coin has experienced an 11.33% decrease in the past seven days. The trading volume for ETH is also down by 1.81% in the last 24 hours, with a total value of $14,257,423,116.\n\nMarket analysts and enthusiasts are closely monitoring how these substantial Ethereum transactions by Celsius will impact overall market sentiment.

        "title": "ETH Price: Divergent Views on Spot Ethereum ETF Approval, ETH Price Drops 5%? - CoinGape",
        "content": "The world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency Ethereum (ETH) continues to face strong selling pressure. In the last 24 hours, the ETH price has tanked another 5% and is currently trading at $2,213 with a market cap of $265 billion. It seems that the ETH price can correct an additional 10% to take support at $2,000.\n\nThe Spot Ethereum ETF Approval\n\nEleanor Terrett from Fox Business sheds light on the varied opinions and perspectives surrounding the potential approval timeline for an Ethereum ($ETH) Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF). Discussions involve insights from ETF issuers, investment management firms, and sources close to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nadvertisement\n\nOne issuer of a Bitcoin ($BTC) Spot ETF, concurrently awaiting approval for an ETH Spot ETF, expresses confidence that the successful approval and seamless launch of Bitcoin spots may influence the SEC to greenlight ETH spot ETFs.\n\nConversely, another source presents a contrasting viewpoint, stating that the current sentiment at the SEC is a \u201chard no,\u201d with some internal resistance to the idea.\n\nAnother source believes that the approval path for ETH spot ETFs could be smoother, pointing to the listing of ETH futures ETFs and BlackRock\u2019s track record in obtaining ETF approvals. They anticipate a potential launch by the end of the summer. Addressing SEC Chair Gary Gensler\u2019s ambiguous stance on Ethereum\u2019s status as a potential security, the source notes the CFTC\u2019s classification of ETH as a commodity and Ripple\u2019s partial victory with $XRP not being deemed a security during secondary market transactions. This leads them to believe Gensler may find it challenging to assert that most digital assets are securities.\n\nSEC Commissioner Hester Peirce emphasizes the need to avoid repeating past delays with ETH ETFs, emphasizing the importance of applying \u2018regular way\u2019 consideration to these products, similar to other comparable offerings.\n\nTerrett concludes that the SEC holds the key to the fate of Ethereum ETFs, with upcoming months expected to provide clues on the depth of SEC staff engagement with S-1 filings, akin to their scrutiny of Bitcoin spot ETFs.\n\nThe ETH Price Action\n\nEthereum experienced a significant decline in the recent trading session, particularly falling below the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA). The analysis suggests that Ethereum might target the $2,100 level. A crucial factor to watch is whether the price breaks below $2,100 and then swiftly rebounds above it, potentially indicating a bullish move.\n\nThe 200-day EMA is positioned around the $1,950 level, and its upward trajectory aligns with this zone. The interaction between Ethereum\u2019s price and the rising 200-day EMA presents an intriguing scenario, warranting close observation to discern the potential market dynamics."

        "content": "Bitcoin and Ethereum Price Prediction as BTC Traders Target $30,000 Level and ETH Bounces From Support\n\nIn the ever-dynamic world of cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) continue to navigate through turbulent waters. As of recent developments, Bitcoin, the pioneer and most valued cryptocurrency, experienced a significant downturn, breaching the $40,000 mark and stirring market uncertainty.\n\nThis decline in Bitcoin\u2019s value, partly attributed to the sales associated with the Grayscale GBTC Bitcoin ETF, has sparked concerns among traders about a possible further drop to the $38,000 level.\n\nConcurrently, the global crypto market cap witnessed a 2.32% fall within 24 hours, settling at $1.54 trillion, underscoring the broader impact of Bitcoin\u2019s fluctuation.\n\nBitcoin $BTC is back under $39K and now officially 20% off its recent high \ud83d\udc40 pic.twitter.com/Aqtlj7QzbT \u2014 Evan (@StockMKTNewz) January 23, 2024\n\nIn a similar vein, Ethereum, renowned as the second-largest cryptocurrency, wasn\u2019t spared from the bearish trend. It saw a nearly 3% decline, dropping to $2,347, a movement seemingly influenced by Bitcoin\u2019s 20% fall following the launch of ETFs by major financial players like BlackRock and Fidelity.\n\nAmidst these market dynamics, Google Bard\u2019s AI projections suggest a potential further decrease in Bitcoin\u2019s value to $35,000, considering various economic factors such as inflation, interest rates, and regulatory changes.\n\nNavigating the Uncertainties: Key Factors Influencing Bitcoin and Ethereum in the Current Market Landscape\n\n\n\nThe current state of the cryptocurrency market, particularly concerning Bitcoin and Ethereum, is influenced by a complex web of factors, leading to considerable uncertainty. Analysts at QCP Capital have their eyes set on the potential for Ethereum to climb, especially with the prospects of spot ETF approvals.\n\nThe uncertainty surrounding Ethereum ETF approvals in 2024 has become a focal point, with analysts speculating that patterns in SEC approval may provide valuable insights.\n\nWhen Will the SEC Approve Ethereum ETFs, What Are the Possible Dates? When Will the Expected Rise Start? QCP Capital Analysts Answered!https://t.co/dLYMppdZW5 \u2014 Bitcoin Sistemi EN (@btcsistemiEN) January 24, 2024\n\nThe recent dip in Bitcoin\u2019s value is attributed partly to outflows from Grayscale and the unfolding Mt. Gox news, which have sparked a flurry of questions in the market.\n\nWith Grayscale managing an impressive $21 billion in assets under management (AUM), its movements could significantly impact Bitcoin\u2019s supply dynamics.\n\nAnalysts are closely monitoring the upcoming Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting and the U.S. Treasury\u2019s Quarterly Refunding Announcement (QRA).\n\nThey anticipate that a strategy leaning towards short-term debt issuance could lead to market rallies. However, an increase in long-term debt could result in higher bond yields and potentially trigger sell-offs in the stock market.\n\nUnder these circumstances, a scenario favoring short-term debt would be more conducive to gains in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nIn light of these developments, there remains a cloud of uncertainty over Ethereum (ETH), albeit with a silver lining that spot ETH approvals could have a positive impact.\n\nThe trajectory of ETH will likely hinge on a range of factors, including the outcome of ETF approvals, the influence of Grayscale\u2019s market maneuvers, and broader macroeconomic events. This complex interplay of variables contributes to a cautious sentiment prevailing in the market.\n\nArthur Hayes\u2019 Market Insights\n\n\n\nArthur Hayes, co-founder, and former CEO of BitMEX, recently shared thoughts on Bitcoin. He predicts a 30% drop from the recent high, expecting Bitcoin to go down to $30,000-$35,000. Hayes mentions buying \u201cPut Options\u201d at $35,000, expecting a 10-15% decline.\n\nBitMex Founder Arthur Hayes Predicts Bitcoin to Find Support Between $30,000 to $35,000 Before Hitting New All-Time High \u2014 Coinvestors \ud83c\udf10 (@CoinvestorsNews) January 24, 2024\n\nDespite challenges, he believes the Federal Reserve could provide relief, highlighting cryptocurrencies as important for inflation protection. He sold Solana (SOL) and BONK but trusts Dogwifhat (WIF) if Bitcoin goes below $35,000, sticking to his recovery outlook for the market.\n\nBitcoin Price Prediction"

This would enable the EVM sidechain to serve as a gateway and connection to the rest of the EVMs, facilitating transactions and the use of all XRP Ledger Mainnet functionalities for all of these assets.\n\nA new UI has also been implemented to improve usability and allow for dynamic bridging between any sidechain, wallet and token. Meanwhile, a bridge SDK has been implemented to help developers create applications that leverage the bridge to access both networks.\n\nAlso, the latest version of the Blockscout Explorer is being developed. In addition to an improved UX/UI and other additional functions for verifying and executing smart contracts, the explorer would also provide a new dynamic display of dApps.\n\nEarlier in January, XRP Ledger developers announced the release of rippled 2.0, which includes two major feature enhancements: XLS-38 Cross-Chain Bridge and XLS-40 Decentralized Identity.\n\nThe Cross-Chain Bridge would allow XRP and fungible tokens issued on the XRPL to move seamlessly between the XRPL Mainnet and XRPL sidechains, as well as between the XRPL Mainnet and the upcoming EVM sidechain."

        "content": "Ethereum is now paving the way for sustainable altcoins after its recent upgrade. Ethereum\u2019s blockchain has proven to be one of the most reliable platforms for building decentralised applications and smart contracts. This reputation has prompted numerous developers to leverage the Ethereum platform, crafting their own distinctive cryptocurrencies.\n\n\n\nIn Ethereum\u2019s thriving altcoin ecosystem, two projects stand out: Chainlink, with its decentralised oracle network and Bitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX), with its novel mining protocol. Both leverage Ethereum\u2019s strengths, but which boasts stronger investor appeal for the future?\n\nEthereum Leading the Way for Environmentally Friendly Altcoins\n\nEthereum has become a go-to platform for various blockchain applications and smart contracts. Offering developers a robust toolkit, it serves as a versatile space for creating and launching diverse blockchain-based projects.\n\nThe Shanghai upgrade to version 2.0 on March 12, 2023, was the next phase for Ethereum. This upgrade not only made the network eco-friendly but also set it apart from other widely used cryptocurrencies that consume substantial energy for mining.\n\nThe latest iteration, Ethereum 2.0, is geared towards making the platform even more scalable, faster and environmentally sustainable.\n\nChainlink: A New-and-Improved Ethereum Platform?\n\nChainlink functions as a decentralised oracle network embedded within the Ethereum blockchain. Its main purpose is to facilitate connections between smart contracts and real-world data, bridging the gap to external APIs.\n\nWith a market capitalisation surpassing $8 billion, Chainlink has gained recognition in the cryptocurrency community, currently holding the 12th position on CoinMarketCap.\n\nKnown for its technological advancements, Chainlink plays a crucial role in supporting decentralised finance (DeFi) applications. By providing secure and reliable data feeds, the platform empowers developers to create DeFi applications without constraints from on-chain data sources. Additionally, Chainlink boasts an active community of developers dedicated to ongoing improvements and innovations on the platform.\n\nBitcoin Minetrix: A Community-centric Crypto with the Technical Power of Ethereum?\n\nBitcoin Minetrix is quickly gaining attention for its innovative \u201cStake-to-Mine\u201d approach to Bitcoin (BTC) mining. Developed on the Ethereum blockchain, this project presents a user-friendly method for individuals to earn Bitcoin passively, eliminating the need for technical expertise.\n\nThe platform is tailored to make Bitcoin mining more accessible to a broader audience, removing the requirements for expensive hardware and specialised skills. By staking their BTCMTX tokens, users gain access to cloud computing resources, simplifying the entire mining process.\n\nThe project has built a solid reputation rooted in security and transparency. Through Ethereum-compatible wallets like MetaMask, users can easily acquire and stake BTCMTX tokens within the ecosystem.\n\nThe onboarding process involves buying tokens, opting for \u201cbuy-and-stake,\u201d and collecting rewards in Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin Minetrix\u2019s native token, $BTCMTX, is based on the ERC-20 standard, within the Ethereum blockchain. With a total supply limit of 4 billion tokens, the project demonstrates a thoughtful distribution strategy, allocating portions to the presale, marketing activities, staking and community-related projects.\n\nA major benefit of Bitcoin Minetrix is its ability to address typical challenges associated with Bitcoin mining, such as complexity and high entry costs. The token-based system offers a higher level of decentralisation and security compared to standard cloud mining services, reducing barriers for regular crypto enthusiasts.\n\nWhen users stake their tokens, they not only receive \u201cmining credits\u201d for cloud mining power but also enjoy two streams of income: potential staking rewards of up to 87% annually and a share of the mining profits. This dual-revenue model is a significant draw for those interested in both mining and staking in the cryptocurrency space.\n\nWhat Future Users of Web 3.0 Want for DeFi Currency\n\nAs the crypto market continues evolving, users seek sustainable and reliable DeFi currencies. Ethereum\u2019s blockchain platform has proven to be one of the most reliable and eco-friendly platforms for building decentralised applications and smart contracts. Chainlink and Bitcoin Minetrix are two cryptocurrencies that have used Ethereum\u2019s platform to create unique and reliable DeFi currencies.\n\nChainlink\u2019s decentralised oracle network has proven to be a valuable asset for the DeFi ecosystem. Its secure and reliable data feeds allow developers to create DeFi applications not limited by on-chain data sources. Bitcoin Minetrix, on the other hand, offers a unique community-led approach that has proven to be popular among users.\n\nIn conclusion, Chainlink and Bitcoin Minetrix are two of the most promising Ethereum-based cryptocurrencies currently on the market. While Chainlink has an advantage in its focus on decentralisation, Bitcoin Minetrix\u2019s unique features, such as its stake-to-mine feature and strong community governance, make it an attractive investment opportunity for those looking for the next big project.\n\nFor investors seeking dramatic growth, turning attention to presale tokens like Bitcoin Minetrix is a strategic move. The $BTCMTX token holds the promise of potentially soaring 50x \u2013 100x, and with its final presale stage underway, early investors have a prime opportunity to get involved and potentially see significant profits in the coming weeks.\n\nShare this article"

        "content": "For Ethereum ETFs, SEC commissioner Hester Peirce strongly believes that the securities regulator would not repeat the same mistakes it made in the run-up to spot Bitcoin ETF approval.\n\nEthereum ETF Approval Might Come Without Hassle\n\nAward-winning Web3.0 host Zac Guzm\u00e1n interviewed Peirce to discuss the regulation of cryptocurrency. During their discussion, he asked the commissioner if Ethereum ETF filers would need to go to court before receiving approval from the SEC just as Grayscale had done. Peirce responded that the SEC would not need to \u201crepeat same mistake\u201d as it did before.\n\nadvertisement\n\nPopularly known as the \u2018Crypto mom\u2019, the commissioner went on to state that the agency would not need a court to explain that its approach is arbitrary and capricious before it gets things right this time around. In her opinion, the SEC has learned its lessons and they will stick to it as applications for Ethereum ETF kept coming in.\n\nBefore approving spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this month, the SEC had constantly rejected applications from several interested parties including Grayscale. Notably, Grayscale took the rejection of its GBTC conversion application a step further by going to court. After several months of legal tussle, a US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit handed Grayscale a win against the SEC.\n\nThis was pivotal for the crypto industry, especially as the court further mandated the regulator to reconsider its decision over Grayscale\u2019s application. There had been several postponement of a spot Bitcoin ETF decision from the United States SEC but in less than six months of receiving this mandate from the court, the SEC greenlighted eleven spot Bitcoin ETF applications.\n\nEthereum Spot ETF Impact\n\nNow the race is for Ethereum ETFs and the SEC seems to be taking its time to reach a decision. Based on a 45-day extension granted earlier, the regulator\u2019s decision on Grayscale Ethereum Trust\u2019s ETF is expected within the next two days. Hashdex Nasdaq Ethereum ETF, which aims to incorporate spot Ethereum and futures contracts into its portfolio has had its decision postponed earlier.\n\nSimilarly, the SEC has announced a 45-day extension for Fidelity Spot Ethereum ETF, pushing the decision on the product to March 5, 2024. As the broad market awaits the decision of the regulator, there are certain forecasts that ETH will reach as high as $4,800 when an approval is eventually given.\n\nConsidering how Bitcoin has reacted to the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs, there is no guarantee that it would be any different for Ethereum but the prospects remains high for approval for now."

There were 10 or 11 that went live at the same time that brought a certain amount of competition. You\u2019ve seen some competition that investors benefited from lower fees.\u201d\n\nThere are varying levels of confidence among crypto experts regarding the approval of spot ether ETFs, with some speculating that an approval could come sometime in May. Shortly after Gensler\u2019s comments, the SEC revealed that it had delayed its decision on BlackRock\u2019s spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) application to March.\n\nSeveral prominent firms, including Fidelity and BlackRock, have already submitted applications for a spot Ethereum ETF.\n\n\n\nOn January 10, the agency greenlit the approval of 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs, a move that followed a D.C. court\u2019s decision by three judges. However, the court ruled that the SEC needed to re-examine a bid related to Grayscale\u2019s spot Bitcoin ETF application.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s Legal Disputes\n\n\n\nThe SEC is currently entangled in legal battles with crypto exchanges Binance and Coinbase.\n\n\n\nGensler, when asked about his thoughts on the current cases, reiterated that noncompliant crypto companies were not \u201cnecessarily\u201d providing appropriate disclosures.\n\n\u201cBut stepping back from any one case, I just think that the investing public, if they\u2019re interested in investing in crypto securities, they should be aware and careful that these crypto security tokens are not necessarily giving them the appropriate disclosures and they\u2019re not getting those disclosures from these non compliant token operators,\u201d Gensler said."

They also noted skepticism about the SEC classifying Ethereum as a commodity as early as May.\n\nAs the SEC continues to deliberate on spot Ethereum ETFs, market participants eagerly await clues from the regulatory body in the coming months.\n\nAccording to Terrett, the SEC\u2019s handling of S-1 filings will likely provide insights into the agency\u2019s stance. The ball remains firmly in the SEC\u2019s court, and the crypto community keenly watches how things unfold."

The commission designates March 10, 2024, as the new deadline to approve or deny BlackRock\u2019s Ethereum ETF.\n\nThe SEC also delayed decisions on every Spot Bitcoin ETF application before approval, including BlackRock\u2019s. Just days ago, the commission delayed Fidelity\u2019s Spot Ethereum ETF application.\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that the SEC is not a fan of cryptocurrency. In fact, chair Gary Gensler implied shortly after approval that it was seemingly pushed to approve the Spot Bitcoin ETFs. Immediately, cryptocurrency enthusiasts went to social media to blast the commission, signaling a feeling of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. Following the initial filing, the SEC had 45 days to decide on the ETFs or delay it, and the commission\u2019s deadline was Jan 25, a day after the decision to delay.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin: Cramer\u2019s Doubts vs. Hayes\u2019 Bottom Fishing \u2013 What Lies Ahead?\n\nHence, it is likely that the SEC is looking to prolong the potential approval of Ethereum ETFs, including BlackRock\u2019s.

BTC holders remain in murky waters until such a time when the price breaks and closes above the $40,726 support on the three-day timeframe.\n\nThe Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) and Awesome Oscillator (AO) indicators remain in positive territory above their respective mean lines, inspiring hope for a possible move north.\n\nIf the bulls have their way, a decisive move above $40,726 would set the pace for Bitcoin price to breach $43,750, or in highly bullish cases, reclaim the $48,000 level.

        "content": "Users restaking Ethereum will get points that they can exchange for Clay tokens when the native tokens officially launch.\n\nCrypto staking platform ClayStack has announced it will support Ethereum (ETH) restaking via ETH native protocol EigenLayer. The platform has also announced it will give users rewards comprising Clay points and EigenLayer points.\n\nClayStack Restaking Ethereum\n\nAs part of the new offering, ClayStack will change its ETH liquid staking token known as csETH, to a liquid restaking asset. At the moment, users can only use ETH for direct restaking on EigenLayer. However, ClayStack CEO and founder Mohak Agarwal said the plan is to provide support for Rocket Pool Ether (rETH) and Lido staked Ether (stETH) very soon.\n\nEigenLayer launched in June 2023 and has significantly driven Ethereum staking since then. By November, the protocol had processed 170,000 ETH in staking. As of Tuesday, the total value locked (TVL) on EigenLayer is $1.7 billion.\n\nRestaking is a process that uses liquid staking tokens and staked Ether to improve earnings across multiple platforms. It combines traditional staking, which locks tokens to generate rewards, and liquid staking, which also creates rewards but by using liquid tokens as representations of locked assets.\n\nClayStack started liquid staking for the MATIC token in 2022. It then launched ETH liquid staking in September 2023, and is now focusing on ETH staking. On moving on from Polygon, CEO Agarwal said:\n\n\u201cDue to shrinking yield and the limited DeFi ecosystem on Polygon outside major ones like Compound and Aave (which delisted the majority of the less traded or volatile assets), it became very difficult to build more utility on Polygon liquid staking.\u201d\n\nReward Points\n\nClayStack has plans to launch its network token and is offering early users of its ETH staking service the opportunity to earn. According to the platform, restakers who earn clay points can redeem them 1:1 for clay tokens. Agarwal pointed out that \u201cthere is no other points system currently that offers 1:1 redemption. You can own 1 million points in other programs and you could end up getting 100 tokens.\u201d\n\nThe plan is to allocate 20 clay points per ETH each week. While the rate may change weekly, users have no minimum or maximum points to maintain. Nonetheless, ClayStack will maintain a cap on points that all users can get. This cap will refresh weekly.\n\nIn addition to Clay points, users will also get EigenLayer restaked points. Agarwal said:\n\n\u201cWhen ClayStack natively restakes the ETH on \u00c9igenLayer, ClayStack\u2019s smart contract ends up accruing those points. We don\u2019t know what they will be redeemable to; we will just pass along those points to csETH holders, considering so much excitement amongst users for EigenLayer points.\u201d\n\nLast November, non-custodial staking services provider Stakin announced a partnership with ClayStack. The collaboration between both providers offers users a new staking experience without compromising security and resilience. Users will also enjoy more control over their staked assets.\n\nIn 2021, ClayStack received $5.2 million in seed funds from several investors, including Solana Foundation and Coinbase Ventures. ParaFi Capital and CoinFund led the seed round."

It reached $2,700 before starting a downward movement. Ethereum plunged below the 38.2 % Fibonacci retracement level (taken from the ATH) before dropping just above its daily support at $2,150. Ethereum\u2019s medium and long-term trend remains bullish. However, the breach of this support could jeopardize the short-term trend of the token.

This development suggests the possibility of a trend reversal, thereby calling for increased vigilance from investors.\n\nRegarding the oscillators, they are currently below the midline, which could suggest that Ethereum is currently in an oversold state. From an optimistic angle, this could indicate that it is undervalued. However, adopting a more pessimistic view, it could be interpreted as a sign that the cryptocurrency\u2019s momentum is turning bearish. Note that the existence of a divergence between the price of Ethereum and its oscillators could reinforce this assumption.\n\nDaily ETH/USD Chart\n\nThe current technical analysis was carried out in collaboration with Elie FT, an investor and trader passionate about the cryptocurrency market. Now a trainer at Family Trading, a community of thousands of proprietary traders active since 2017. Here you will find Live sessions, educational content, and peer assistance around financial markets in a professional and warm atmosphere.\n\nFocus on Derivatives (ETHUSDT)\n\nThe open interest for Ethereum has experienced a notable decline of nearly 15% since Monday, January 22. This decrease represents a withdrawal of over $700 million in ETH/USDT perpetual contracts. Out of these withdrawals, more than $60 million were executed forcibly. Although these amounts may seem significant, their impact on the market requires a more nuanced analysis. When compared to the price evolution of ETH relative to its open interest, it becomes apparent that the latter maintains relative stability compared to the ETH price itself. This observation could indicate that entry and exit of traders in the market are not particularly high, or that new traders are entering the market at the same rate as others leave. Thus, this situation opens the door to various interpretations, such as a period of indecision in the market, possible accumulation of orders, etc.\n\nETHUSD Open Interest\n\nThe Ethereum liquidations heat map shows that the cryptocurrency has recently reached an important liquidation zone, situated between $2,200 and $2,150. At present, the price appears to be stabilizing in this area, indicating a period of uncertainty among investors. If the price cannot maintain itself above this last level, the next significant liquidation zone below its price is around $2,000. Above the current price, the $2,500 zone is also worth monitoring. The approach of the price towards these levels could lead to a massive triggering of orders, thus increasing the possibility of a period of heightened volatility on Ethereum. These zones are therefore crucial points of interest for investors.\n\nETH/USDT Liquidation Heatmap (3 months)\n\nHypotheses for Ethereum\u2019s Price (ETH)\n\nIf the price of Ethereum maintains above the $2,200 \u2013 $2,100 levels, we could anticipate a bullish continuation up to the $2,400 level. The next resistance to consider, should the bullish movement continue, would be the last peak, namely $2,700 and higher if this level is breached. At this stage, that would represent an increase of over +25%.\n\nIf the price of Ethereum fails to maintain itself above the $2,200 \u2013 $2,100 levels, we might expect a return to $2,000. The next support to consider, should the bearish movement continue, would be around the levels of $1,900. At this stage, that would represent a drop of nearly -13%.\n\nConclusion\n\nAfter marking a new high, Ethereum has initiated a correctional phase, leading it towards its former daily resistance. Could this decline be due to the delay in the decision on the Ethereum spot ETFs? What is certain is that it will be crucial to closely observe the price\u2019s reaction to the various key levels to confirm or refute the current hypotheses. It is also important to remain vigilant of potential \u201cfake outs\u201d and market \u201csqueezes\u201d in each scenario. Finally, remember that these analyses are based solely on technical criteria and that the price of cryptocurrencies can also quickly evolve based on other, more fundamental factors.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program!

        "content": "In anticipation of the potential approval of a spot Ethereum ETF, Hester Peirce, a Commissioner with the US SEC, reiterated that the regulator has learned from its past mistakes, signaling the products\u2019 emergence may be smoother.\n\nEarlier this month, the SEC approved 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs to trade in the US. Behind this celebrated milestone was more than ten years of pursuit of the investment product, with the regulator notably rejecting several applications from many asset managers.\n\nRiding on this history, many in the industry are now speculating on whether Ethereum spot ETF might suffer the same fate as Bitcoin.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nPer Hester Peirce\u2019s position, the delays recorded in the approval process for crypto ETFs are long gone, and the commission will approach Ethereum ETFs with a different strategy.\n\nSEC Has Learned from Its Mistake\n\nOne of the major turning points for the market regulator in granting approvals for the spot Bitcoin ETF product was the defeat in the Court case against Grayscale Investments.\n\nThe asset manager sued the regulator when it initially denied its request to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) product into a full-fledged spot ETF.\n\nThe court ruled in favor of Grayscale and ordered the commission to review the applications. When asked by Coinage media\u2019s Zac Guzman whether a court case might be required before the commission approves a spot Ethereum ETF, Hester Peirce responded:\n\n- Advertisement -\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not how we\u2019re going to do our approvals \u2026 We shouldn\u2019t need a court to tell us that our approach is \u2018arbitrary and capricious\u2019 in order for us to get it right.\u201d\n\nWith Bitcoin ETF approval setting a precedent, it might only be a matter of time before Ethereum and even XRP ETF start trading in US markets.\n\nDissenting Views on Potential Ethereum ETF\n\nDespite the filings for several spot Ethereum ETF products, with the US SEC in the queue for decision, there is a diverse opinion on whether the product will be approved or not.\n\nFox Business Journalist Eleanor Terrett highlighted these discrepancies, clearly pointing out how a spot Bitcoin ETF issuer expressed confidence that spot Ethereum ETF will see the light of day.\n\nShe also noted that sources at the SEC confirmed that based on the current disposition of the regulator, Ethereum ETFs are a \u201chard no\u201d based on internal resistance to the idea for now.\n\nHowever, with the presence of BlackRock in the race once again and the firm\u2019s track record of securing approvals, Ethereum ETFs might also be close to being approved."

        "content": "Qadir Ak is the founder of Coinpedia. He has over a decade of experience writing about technology and has been covering the blockchain and cryptocurrency space since 2010. He has also interviewed a few prominent experts within the cryptocurrency space.\n\nThe approval of spot Ethereum Exchange-Traded Funds faces uncertainty as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission exhibits resistance. Fox Business reporter Eleanor Terrett sheds light on diverse expectations surrounding the SEC\u2019s stance, revealing potential challenges and conflicting opinions.\n\nSEC\u2019s Current Position\n\nTerrett reports a \u201chard no\u201d from sources within the SEC, signaling \u201csome internal resistance\u201d to approving spot Ethereum ETF.\n\nIn her tweet, Terrett also mentions SEC commissioner Hester Peirce, known for her pro-cryptocurrency stance, who has been advocating for a more straightforward decision process. Pierce criticized the reliance on legal victories to guide ETF approvals.\n\nDespite SEC resistance, Terrett highlights optimism among asset managers like BlackRock, whose track record of getting ETFs approved has raised hopes of getting Ethereum ETFs approved by summer this year. Blackrock expresses confidence, citing the smooth launch of Bitcoin spots as a potential catalyst for Ethereum spot ETF approval.\n\nTerrett anticipates further insights into the SEC\u2019s stance in the coming months, mainly through engagements with S-1 registration forms.\n\nVarying Expectations\n\nExpectations on spot Ethereum ETF are varying. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas suggests a 70% chance of approval in May, while JP Morgan\u2019s Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou is less optimistic, predicting a 50% chance.\n\nJP Morgan Analysts\u2019 Cautious Stance\n\nJP Morgan analysts, led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, remain cautious, estimating the likelihood of approval to be no higher than 50%. Regulatory and judicial considerations and uncertainty surrounding Ethereum\u2019s classification as a commodity or security contribute to their skepticism.\n\nUpcoming Developments\n\nThe SEC\u2019s recent delay in deciding on Fidelity\u2019s Ethereum Spot ETF until March 5, 2024, extends the evaluation period. The final decision on Spot Ethereum ETFs is expected between late January and August 2024.\n\nThe approval of spot Ethereum ETFs remains clouded in uncertainty, with conflicting signals from the SEC, varying expectations from expert figures, and ongoing regulatory uncertainties."

        "title": "SEC delays BlackRock's Ethereum spot ETF to March - Crypto Briefing",
        "content": "Share this article URL Copied\n\nThe US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has extended its review period for considering a proposed rule change to list the iShares Ethereum Trust spot ETF, designating March 10, 2024 as the new deadline for taking action, according to today\u2019s filing.\n\nOriginally filed by The Nasdaq Stock Market on November 21, 2023, the proposal aims to provide direct exposure to Ethereum\u2019s price movements under Nasdaq Rule 5711(d) for Commodity-Based Trust Shares.\n\nThe SEC extended the original 45-day review period, which would have ended on January 25, 2024, stating it required more time to thoroughly consider the proposal and related issues around a spot Ethereum ETF product.\n\nOriginally published for comment on December 11, 2023, the proposed rule change has received no public comments so far. Under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the longer review period indicates a cautious approach by the SEC towards crypto-based ETFs amid an evolving regulatory landscape.\n\nBlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, has been at the forefront of integrating digital assets into traditional investment vehicles. However, the SEC\u2019s hesitancy reflects ongoing concerns over the volatility, security, and regulatory compliance of crypto products.\n\nInvestors and industry experts are closely watching the SEC\u2019s moves, as approval of such an ETF would mark a significant milestone in the mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrencies. The extended review period suggests that the SEC is taking a thorough approach to ensure that any potential risks associated with the iShares Ethereum Trust are mitigated."
