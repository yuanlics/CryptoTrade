        "title": "Ethereum In An \u2018Obvious Accumulation Range Of All Time\u2019 \u2013 Preparing For $5,000? - NewsBTC",
        "summary": "  Ethereum is in a \"obvious accumulation range of all time,\" according to a crypto analyst, with the potential to reach $5,000 or higher. The coin is currently trading at around $1,580 and has failed to break above the $1,700 resistance level. If buyers can push ETH above February highs and register new Q1 2023 highs, it could set up a bullish breakout and potentially lead to another leg up towards $5,000 to $7,000. However, traders and investors should proceed with caution, as several fundamental factors could impact the crypto markets, including ETH."
