Ethereum's valuation has grown by $100 billion, but it still lags behind Bitcoin's valuation. The fee-flippening (flee-pening?) is awkward, as Bitcoin users are paying miners $40 million in fees, while Ethereum users are paying $27 million. Ordinals, a protocol for inscribing individual units of bitcoin with unique data, has created an on-chain collectibles market worth thousands of BTC, driving up demand for blockspace and transaction fees. Some Bitcoin insiders worry that the network isn't properly equipped to handle the influx of interest in its original use case, BTC payments."

In the past month, over 6 million Ordinal assets have been generated, redistributing over $30 million in fees to the network. The popularity of the Ordinals Protocol has been fueled by the listing of the second-largest BRC-20 token, ORDI, on Binance, leading to a price surge of over 50%. The Taproot Wizards project, built on the Ordinals protocol, has also announced a seed funding round of $7.5 million."

        "summary": "  Ethereum's price has risen 5% over the past weekend, holding above the key psychological level of $2,000 per token. This is driven by investors seeking alternative assets to safeguard their wealth due to geopolitical concerns and a falling U.S. dollar. The circulating supply of Ethereum is at record lows, indicating that investors are viewing it more as a store of value to hold in cold storage. Ethereum's perceived store of value and defensive positioning make it an attractive asset for portfolio managers. However, the low liquidity environment could work in reverse during a bear market. Despite this, the strength in crypto markets this year has been notable, and Ethereum's perceived store of value could continue to drive its momentum into 2024."
