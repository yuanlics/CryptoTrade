The upgrade, also known as Shapella, was tested on three testnets and is now scheduled to take place on the mainnet. The upgrade will implement EIP-4895, enabling the unstaking of ETH tokens and bringing the network closer to a fully functional proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain network. This is a crucial step for those who wish to become validators on the Ethereum 2.0 network, as they were required to stake at least 32 ETH to the network, which was sealed indefinitely.

However, some analysts fear that the upgrade may result in increased sell pressure, as stakers withdraw their ETH. The impact of Shapella on Ethereum's price is expected to be relatively small compared to macroeconomic forces. Liquid Staking Derivatives (LSDs), which allow users to access liquid tokens representing underlying staked Ether while earning staking rewards, have posted impressive growth amid the absence of staked Ether withdrawals.

        "summary": "  Ethereum price metrics suggest that the upcoming Shapella hard fork may not lead to a significant sell-off despite the anticipation. The ETH/BTC price ratio has dropped to its lowest level in nine months, but the majority of the movement can be attributed to the upcoming hard fork. However, the total staked on the Beacon Chain exceeds 18.1 million ETH, which could limit potential selling pressure. Additionally, the Ethereum network's average transaction fee has been above $5 for five weeks, and the Shapella fork does not address the issue. Volume at Ethereum-based decentralized exchanges has also fallen by 84% since a weekly peak. Paul Brody, EY's global blockchain leader, suggests that the battle to keep Ethereum sufficiently and properly decentralized could be a reason for Ether's price underperformance relative to Bitcoin. Ether derivatives metrics indicate that professional traders do not expect a significant price correction as a result of the staking unlock, and there are no obvious reasons for a rally. However, the number of staking unlock requests could increase, which could impact Ether"

The upgrade enabled the withdrawal of staked ETH, but the price of ETH only ticked slightly upwards, with a 3% increase since the previous day. Analysts had expected more than $300 million worth of ETH to be liquidated immediately following the upgrade, but this did not happen. The majority of staked ETH is believed to be liquid through intermediary staking pools and centralized crypto exchanges, which issue staking tokens to customers. This, combined with the fact that much of the capital supposedly kept hostage pre-Shanghai has actually been liquid for some time, may explain why ETH's price did not drop sharply after the upgrade."

        "summary": "  Ethereum's price is expected to reach $3000 this quarter, driven by the upcoming Shanghai upgrade.

Ethereum's quick jump from $1379 to $1900 in March suggests that the market is excited about the upcoming milestone and the potential for solid demand and growth. The altcoin is reversing losses made in 2022 and reclaiming its status as the blue-chip crypto by driving solid demand and growth.\n\nEthereum has a lot to look forward to in 2023, including the Proto-danksharding upgrade, which will reduce transaction costs by moving data from rollups permanently on the Ethereum blockchain to a new temporary 'blob' storage. This can kindle a strong Ethereum bull run. Even if the coin doesn't ascend to its all-time high of $4,8"
