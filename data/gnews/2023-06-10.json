        "content": "Ethereum Price Analysis: Today on June 10th, the crypto market witnessed a massive liquidation amid the US SEC lawsuit against big crypto exchanges Binance(BNB) and Coinbase(COIN). As a result, the market leaders Bitcoin and Ethereum tumbled 2.5% and 6.5% on intraday levels respectively. Amid this downfall, the ETH price lost crucial monthly support of $1775-$1765 indicating the coin holders could experience an extended correction.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum Co-Founder Names Three Key Transitions to Watch as Network Grows\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum Price Daily Chart\n\nA bearish breakdown below the $1765 support sets the ETH price on a 5.5% loss\n\nThe long-term trend for Ethereum stays bullish as long as the support trendline is intact;\n\nThe intraday trading volume in Ether is $4.6 Billion, indicating a 0.27% loss.\n\nSource- Tradingview\n\nToday, the Ethereum price showcased a high momentum breakdown from the $1775-$1765 support level. Losing this last swing low support hints the ETH price may prolong the ongoing correction phase.\n\nIf the daily candle closes below the $1765 support the selling pressure will accelerate and offer trades the opportunity to short sell. With sustained selling the coin price will tumble 5.5% to hit the long-coming support trendline.\n\nPreviously, a retest to this support trendline triggered a significant recovery in the ETH price, validating this level as a crucial accumulation zone. Therefore, potential traders must mark this dynamic support if looking for a dip opportunity.\n\nWill Ethereum Price Reach $1700?\n\nThe intense sell-off today backed by high volume indicates the sellers have a strong conviction to take the Ethereum price lower. With the breakdown of $1775-$1765 support, the coin price will more likely plunge to the next significant support of $1700, followed by the combined support of $1650 and ascending trendline.\n\nAverage Directional Index: The uptick in the daily ADX slope assures sufficient strength in sellers to carry further downfall.\n\nBollinger Band: A downtick in the lower band of the BB indicator accentuates high momentum selling in the market."

        "content": "Ethereum developer proposed final changes to add to the Cancun upgrade.\n\nETH\u2019s price soared alongside its velocity.\n\nThe new Cancun update that is supposed to be launching on Ethereum [ETH] has been a huge subject of discussion for developers over the last few months. Recently, in the \u201cAll Core Developers Consensus Call\u201d, many details of the update were finalized.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nDevelopers come to an agreement\n\nThe main topic of discussion was about blobs. Blobs are chunks of data that can be added to the Ethereum blockchain. An Ethereum developer named Dankrad Feist conducted an experiment to test how well the Ethereum network can handle large blocks with additional data.\n\nFeist found that the Ethereum network successfully processed blocks with 128 kB to 1 MB of extra data without causing any problems. He tested factors like bandwidth usage, block speed, and missed attestations. Everything remained stable regardless of block size.\n\nHowever, there was one instance where a block carrying 1 MB of additional data caused a temporary reorganization of the blockchain.\n\nBased on the experiment, Feist suggested making some changes. He recommended increasing the maximum number of blobs per block from 4 to 6, as specified in EIP 4844. He also suggested reevaluating the deadline for receiving blocks within a certain time frame.\n\nNext, the participants discussed making modifications to EIP-4788. This EIP allows the Beacon block root to be visible in the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine). The suggestion was to restrict the quantity of block roots stored on the EL (Execution Layer) to control the growth of the blockchain\u2019s state.\n\nThough implementing this change would require EL clients to perform additional disk writes, everyone in the discussion agreed that it was a necessary adjustment.\n\nThe team made plans to launch a new testnet called Holesky, which will serve as an alternative platform for implementing changes to the beacon chain. The main goal of Holesky is to run a larger number of validators compared to the mainnet. This will enable them to perform stress tests and evaluate any modifications related to the Beacon chain.\n\nState of ETH\n\nThese developments could have a positive impact on the price of ETH in the future. At press time, ETH was trading at $1,845.16 according to CoinMarketCap.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s ETH market cap in BTC\u2019s terms\n\nIts price grew over the last few days, along with its velocity. This indicated that the number of ETH transfers were increasing. However, the MVRV ratio for ETH grew in tandem with its price. The growing MVRV ratio implied that ETH was slightly in the overbought zone at the time of writing."

        "content": "Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum, and Sandeep Nailwal, co-founder of Polygon, have pledged $100 million to help accelerate COVID-19 research and relief efforts in India.\n\nWith COVID-19 variants continuing to emerge and spread, and with a very high number of people experiencing long-term symptoms speeding up, research efforts are critical.\n\nHow The Donation Will Be Used To Support COVID-19 Research\n\nThe donations from Buterin and Nailwal are some of the largest philanthropic contributions ever made in crypto. Buterin made the announcement in a Twitter thread and according to the thread, the fund will be donated to Crypto Relief, with the funds going directly to researchers working on solutions to combat the long-term effects of coronavirus.\n\nCrypto Relief is a project led by set up by Nailwal during the height of the COVID pandemic as an emergency relief fund. The polygon co-founder said the non-profit organization is now upgrading into a long-term strategic fund for healthcare donations in India. Buterin also confirmed this change of approach in his Twitter post, noting that dealing with Covid and future pandemics needs to take an integrated global approach.\n\n\u201cWork in India continues to be a key part of the solution, but we also need an integrated global approach,\u201d the co-founder said.\n\nThe money will go to fund research projects related to cutting-edge scientific discoveries & inventions in India and other developing nations. Overall, it\u2019s a win for science, a win for global health, and a win for humanity.\n\nETH price falls to the $1,700 level | Source: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nPast Donations Of Vitalik Buterin To COVID Relief\n\nVitalik Buterin has a history of donating to important causes like COVID-19 relief, with him donating cryptocurrencies worth $1.5 billion to several non-profit organizations in 2021. During this period, Buterin donated over $1 billion worth of Shiba Inu coin to aid India\u2019s fight against the coronavirus.\n\nButerin made the donation by offloading 50 trillion SHIB tokens worth $1.2 billion, which he was gifted by the creators of the Shiba Inu coin. With India being one of the most badly affected countries during the pandemic, the fund helped provide medical equipment and supplies as the country battled a deadly second wave of COVID-19 infections.\n\nOutside of the pandemic, Buterin has donated millions of dollars in crypto to various charities and causes. Last year, he quietly donated $5 million to Ukraine relief efforts following the Russian invasion.\n\nFeatured image from Coingape, chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "'Ethereum Fails' Without These 3 Changes, Says Vitalik Buterin - Decrypt",
        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nIf Ethereum is to expand how it's used, it will need to undergo three major transitions or risk undermining its own future, said Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin.\n\nIn a blog post published on Friday, Buterin laid out his ideas for what it will take to help Ethereum mature if it is to expand in use. Calling them \u201cThe Three Transitions,\u201d Buterin said they would need to evolve around transitions in layer-2, or \u201cL2,\u201d scaling solutions, a move to smart contract wallets, and greater privacy for fund transfers.\n\nButerin\u2019s proposals bump into what has been called the \"blockchain trilemma.\" A blockchain's most important traits are being decentralized, secure, and scalable, but it can only usually achieve two of these three.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTo overcome this, Buterin said that it is acknowledged that these transitions would be challenging to coordinate, but said they were needed for Ethereum to survive.\n\nOf the three, Buterin singled out a need to expand use of L2 solutions called \u201crollups\u201d as an important part of this transition. An ordinary L2 function processes transactions off of the main Ethereum blockchain, or the L1.\n\nA rollup is a scaling solution that bundles these transactions and then validates a proof of them as a much smaller piece of data on the mainnet to keep it from getting too clogged. As a result, the cost of an Ethereum transaction can be lower.\n\n\"Layer 2s are critical to the success of Ethereum\u2019s vision of the world computer. Without L2s, Ethereum won\u2019t scale,\" CEO of OP Labs and co-founder of Ethereum scaler Optimism Karl Floersch told Decrypt. \"Without scale, Ethereum will never be able to support the world\u2019s compute demand, and until the world\u2019s compute is fully supported, we can\u2019t fully realize Ethereum\u2019s vision.\"\n\nCritically, said Buterin, the version of Ethereum that does not address the move to rollups \"fails,\" adding that transaction costs would only surge in the face of a bull run and encourage more centralization on its blockchain.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\"The solution isn't simply 'move users off of mainnet.' Rather, the solution lies in extending the capabilities of the Ethereum network,\" Floersch said. \"This means that instead of thinking about it as a migration from mainnet, we can think about it as load balancing the demand for Ethereum mainnet with other highly secure OP chains.\"\n\nBringing Ethereum from the edge\n\nEli Ben-Sasson, co-founder of the Israeli-based company StarkWare behind layer-2 scaling solutions StarkEx and StarkNet, said Buterin was \u201cright\u201d in his diagnosis of what it would take to see an expanded Ethereum.\n\nHe said his company was already using the smart contract wallets as part of its StarkNet, and believes more of this type of scaling is \u201cover the horizon.\u201d\n\n\u201cHaving the leadership from Vitalik which both appreciates the excitement of this moment and urges the community to get on board is a big part of what will propel Ethereum\u2019s success,\u201d Ben-Sasson told Decrypt.\n\nButerin said the move to smart contract wallets has some \"technical issues\" to work through but is \"not a large burden\" to address.\n\nWith a smart contract, contracts automatically execute their terms when predefined conditions are met, and Buterin said they would make some processes easier like covering transactions for non-ETH tokens.\n\nOf the three transitions, Buterin expressed concern that meeting privacy concerns would be among the bigger challenges. He said that without enough data privacy measures in place, users concerned about this will stay away from Ethereum.\n\n\u201cWithout [privacy], Ethereum fails because having all transactions available publicly for literally anyone to see is far too high a privacy sacrifice for many users,\" said Buterin.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTo address this, Buterin suggested using \"stealth address\" to help protect user identities, but these methods are still maturing because of issues around cost and functionality."
