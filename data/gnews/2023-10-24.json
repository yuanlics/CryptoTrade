        "title": "Ethereum Accelerates Toward $2,000 But Can The Bulls Make It? - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Ethereum price started a decent increase after Bitcoin rallied 15% against the US dollar. ETH is rising, but it might struggle to clear the $1,850 resistance.\n\nEthereum started a steady increase above the $1,750 resistance.\n\nThe price is trading above $1,780 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere is a key bullish trend line forming with support near $1,750 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair could struggle to clear the $1,850 and $1,880 resistance levels.\n\nEthereum Price Jumps 10%\n\nEthereum remained in a positive zone above the $1,650 support zone. The recent pump in Bitcoin above the $34,000 resistance sparked more upsides in ETH. There was a steady increase above the $1,720 and $1,750 resistance levels.\n\nThe price even cleared the key $1,800 resistance zone. A high is formed near $1,849 and the price is now consolidating gains. It is trading well above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $1,660 swing low to the $1,849 high.\n\nEthereum is now trading above $1,780 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is also a key bullish trend line forming with support near $1,750 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The trend line is near the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $1,660 swing low to the $1,849 high.\n\nOn the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $1,850 level. The first major resistance is near the $1,880 zone. A close above the $1,880 resistance could send the price further higher. The next key resistance is $1,920, above which the price could accelerate higher.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nIn the stated case, Ether could start a strong increase toward the $2,000 resistance. Any more gains might open the doors for a move toward $2,200.\n\nDownside Correction in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $1,850 resistance, it could start a downside correction. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,800 level.\n\nThe next key support is $1,750 and the trend line zone. A downside break below the $1,750 support might send the price further lower. In the stated case, the price could drop toward the $1,700 level. Any more losses may perhaps send Ether toward the $1,650 level and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bullish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now above the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $1,750\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $1,850\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "Market Pumps, But Ethereum Struggles To Keep Up - Is New Yearly High Ahead? - CCN.com",
        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nEthereum is up by 20% from October 11\n\nBreakout has been seen from a descending channel but today\u2019s high is still a lower one\n\nMore upside potential stands but ETH needs to go above $2,000\n\nThe overall cryptocurrency market has witnessed a significant surge, with its capitalization soaring by 30% from its September 11 low, touching a new yearly high of $1.26 trillion. This slight edge over its previous peak in April underscores the market\u2019s bullish momentum.\n\nBitcoin, leading the charge, has set a fresh yearly record, outpacing its previous best by 11%. Altcoins, too, have been on a tear, with some, like MINA, registering eye-popping gains of up to 120%.\n\nIn contrast, Ethereum\u2018s performance, while commendable, hasn\u2019t quite matched the fervor seen in other coins. Since October 11, it has appreciated by 21%, a respectable figure but somewhat muted compared to the broader market\u2019s exuberance. Currently trading around $1,800, it remains 15% shy of its yearly peak of $2,100.\n\nETH Price Analysis\n\nEthereum\u2019s trajectory since its June 18 low last year has been relatively more optimistic than many of its peers. It embarked on a recovery journey, marking a higher low in November and subsequently achieving a higher peak in April compared to its August high.\n\nPost its $2,100 zenith, Ethereum managed to maintain its value above the $1,500 threshold, charting its course within a descending channel. This resilience stands in stark contrast to several altcoins that plummeted to new bearish lows post-April.\n\nThis descending trajectory Ethereum found itself in likely represented a corrective phase, characterized by a five-wave pattern. However, the tide seems to be turning. Starting from October 11, Ethereum has been exhibiting bullish signals, culminating in a breakout from this channel.\n\nThe rise of Ethereum from November 21 to mid-April presents an analytical conundrum. The movement, characterized by a five-wave impulse, is somewhat ambiguous in its interpretation due to the higher low on November 21.\n\nThis could mean that the surge is merely an extension of the previous ascending structure, rendering it a corrective phase rather than a new bullish cycle.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s an alternative, more optimistic perspective. If we consider this rise as a smaller segment within a broader framework, it could be interpreted as just the initial sub-wave of a more extensive five-wave impulse.\n\nUnder this assumption, the descending channel that followed would represent the second wave of this larger cycle. If this interpretation holds, Ethereum could be poised for a significant upward trajectory. Wave 3, in this context, could propel the price to around $3,310. And if the momentum sustains, wave 5 could push the price even further, breaking previous boundaries.\n\nGiven the undeniable corrective nature of the descending channel, the odds currently favor a continuation of the upward trend for Ethereum. But does this imply an imminent new yearly high?\n\nThe current high, just a touch above $2,000, remains shy of the July 14 peak. By the tenets of technical analysis, this positions Ethereum in a downtrend since mid-April.\n\nHowever, a breach above the $2,000 mark, resulting in a higher high, would disrupt this bearish narrative. Such a move would not only signify a reversal of the downtrend but also set the stage for a potential new yearly high. Conversely, if the current surge falters and pivots into a decline, Ethereum might be subjected to further losses before it can embark on a genuine bull run.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nPlease note that the contents of this article are not financial or investing advice.

        "title": "An in-depth look at the Ethereum market in 2023 - crypto.news",
        "content": "Dive deep into Ethereum\u2019s 2023 market journey, focusing on its NFT dynamics, pivotal metrics, and the emerging world of spot ETFs.\n\nIn 2022, the crypto world witnessed an unexpected downturn, with Ethereum (ETH) facing a sharp 68% decline in value.\n\nAlthough 2023 brought a glimmer of hope, with ETH clawing back nearly 35% of its losses amidst a market-wide resurgence, its price of $1,620 as of Oct. 20 still pales in comparison to its once lofty highs.\n\nEthereum has also grappled with a series of challenges recently, dampening its once meteoric rise. A testament to its struggles is the drastic dip in ETH\u2019s total value locked (TVL) \u2014 plummeting from a whopping $108 billion in November 2021 to a mere $20 billion by October, marking an almost 82% drop.\n\nLet\u2019s delve into the dynamics surrounding Ethereum and try to understand the current market sentiments, key metrics, and insights into what lies ahead for this crypto.\n\nDeclining NFT market\n\nIn Jan. 2023, Ethereum\u2019s NFT space witnessed significant headwinds. The bustling activity that saw more than 28,000 NFTs being minted daily on Ethereum at the beginning of the year took a sharp downturn.\n\nETH NFT mints | Source: The Block\n\nAs of Oct. 20, that enthusiasm has waned, with daily mintings dropping below 3,500. This significant 88% decline can be attributed to increased competition from other blockchain networks, a possible oversupply, and the general volatility of the crypto market.\n\nTrading hasn\u2019t been spared either. Platforms like OpenSea, once brimming with sales, observed a slowdown, particularly after the first quarter, hitting their lowest ebb by Sep. Moreover, from Q1 to Q2 2023, Ethereum\u2019s NFT trading volume shrank by 39.6%, according to CoinGecko.\n\nParallel to the ebb in NFT momentum, 2023 also marked the entry of Ethscriptions. Launched in June, this platform aimed to transform the NFT space by allowing users to inscribe \u201cnon-financial data\u201d on Ethereum\u2019s network.\n\nHowever, its journey was riddled with hurdles. A major setback occurred when a prominent collection named Ethereum Punks had to be withdrawn from Ethscriptions\u2019 official platform.\n\nAt the request of Yuga Labs, the owner of CryptoPunks, I am taking down the Ethereum Punks website, removing all Ethereum Punks images from https://t.co/ZcR9HKlexS, and deleting my Tweets that reference Ethereum Punks, including my Tweet introducing the Ethscriptions Protocol. \u2014 Middlemarch (@dumbnamenumbers) July 11, 2023\n\nThis action was taken upon a request from Yuga Labs, the entity behind CryptoPunks. The ripple effect of this removal was evident as it led to the deletion of numerous tweets by the creator of Ethscriptions, Middlemarch, including the pivotal one introducing the Ethscriptions Protocol.\n\nThese challenges faced by Ethereum\u2019s NFT and Ethscriptions hint at broader concerns within the Ethereum ecosystem, shedding light on competitive, regulatory, and inherent protocol-based challenges.\n\nWhat do the metrics suggest?\n\nSeveral critical metrics can gauge Ethereum\u2019s health and vibrancy. Let\u2019s delve into these to unravel their story about Ethereum in 2023.\n\nETH daily transactions\n\nThese represent the number of transactions processed on the Ethereum blockchain within a day. In May 2023, this number averaged around 1.14 million, but by Oct. 20, it had diminished to 980,000, marking a 14% decline.\n\nEthereum daily transactions | Source: The Block\n\nWhy does this matter? A high transaction count typically indicates robust network usage and utility, making it a bellwether of network health.\n\nYou might also like: Vitalik Buterin discusses Ethereum\u2019s future and innovative projects in AMA\n\nThe reduction hints at a reduced activity level, possibly due to competition from other blockchains or waning enthusiasm from users and developers.\n\nDaily active addresses\n\nThis metric denotes the number of unique addresses that actively send or receive Ethereum on a given day. In April 2023, the daily active addresses averaged 471,000, but this number dwindled to 369,000 by Oct. 20, showcasing a 21.7% drop.\n\nEthereum active addresses | Source: The Block\n\nIts significance lies in its ability to act as a pulse check for user engagement and network popularity. A declining trend in active addresses might imply that fewer users or entities are interacting with the Ethereum network, possibly signaling a shift of interest or a consolidation phase.\n\nDaily onchain volume\n\nRepresenting the total value (in USD) of all transactions on the Ethereum blockchain in a day, the daily onchain volume has witnessed a steady decline. From a substantial $3.92 billion in March, it shrank to $1.41 billion by Oct. 20, reflecting a 64% reduction.\n\nEthereum daily on-chain volume | Source: The Block\n\nThis metric is crucial because it sheds light on the monetary value of assets moving within the network. A decline might suggest that fewer high-value transactions are taking place or that the value of assets on Ethereum has decreased.\n\nETH transaction fee\n\nTransaction fees are payments made by users to compensate for the computational energy required to process and validate transactions on the Ethereum network. These fees had reached a staggering annual peak of $21.89 in May but have since nosedived to a mere $1.99 by Oct. 20, indicating a 90.9% decline.\n\nEthereum transaction fee | Source: The Block\n\nWhile high fees can be discouraging for users, leading to decreased network usage, the sharp decline might indicate improved network efficiency or reduced demand.\n\nNonetheless, it\u2019s a double-edged sword. While it\u2019s more cost-effective for users, it might be less profitable for miners, possibly leading to decreased network security in the long run.\n\nEthereum\u2019s layer 2 evolution in 2023\n\nIn 2023, Ethereum\u2019s layer 2 solutions (L2s) saw increased activity. As Ethereum faced various challenges, L2s emerged as an alternative solution, particularly in addressing scalability.\n\nThe TVL of Ethereum\u2019s L2 platforms reached $10.62 billion as of Oct. 2023. Of these platforms, Arbitrum One recorded a market share of 54.76%. This TVL growth suggests a heightened activity within the L2 platforms.\n\nMeanwhile, centralized exchanges have begun to integrate L2 solutions. Coinbase\u2018s introduction of layer 2 Base indicates a growing interaction between centralized platforms and L2s.\n\nYou might also like: Coinbase launches Ethereum L2 network, Base\n\nIn terms of transaction activity, L2s recorded a higher transaction count than Ethereum\u2019s mainnet during the year. This shift might be attributed to factors such as scalability issues and transaction costs on Ethereum\u2019s mainnet.\n\nOn the financial front, Ethereum\u2019s network revenue experienced a decline, decreasing by 33.3% from $1.27 billion in Q2 2022 to $847 million in Q2 2023. The value of ETH burned also saw a reduction of 35% over the same period. These changes align with the fluctuations observed in the broader crypto market.\n\nEthereum\u2019s position in the decentralized finance sector, however, continues to be notable. The platform constitutes a considerable portion of DeFi\u2019s TVL and is used for multiple on-chain stablecoins.\n\nIn summary, 2023 observed varied dynamics in Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem, with L2 solutions gaining traction amid the platform\u2019s overarching challenges.\n\nEthereum and the influence of spot ETFs\n\nMeanwhile, ETFs have taken center stage recently, with their potential to impact the price and adoption of cryptocurrencies significantly.\n\nGalaxy Digital Fund and Invesco have recently joined forces to delve into the Ethereum spot ETF market in the U.S. This makes them the fifth major player to do so, following in the footsteps of renowned entities like VanEck, ARK Invest, Hashdex, and Grayscale.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s crucial to note that the road ahead for Ethereum spot ETFs is not without hurdles. In many ways, these spot ETFs\u2019 fate is tied to that of Bitcoin spot ETFs.\n\nBefore Ethereum can enjoy the green light for its spot ETFs, Bitcoin spot ETFs are awaiting clearance from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Essentially, Ethereum\u2019s move is pegged to Bitcoin\u2019s lead in this dance of financial products.\n\nTheir introduction could play a pivotal role in influencing Ethereum\u2019s price, adoption, and mainstream acceptance in the financial market.\n\nEthereum price prediction\n\nStandard Chartered\u2019s Geoff Kendrick is optimistic about Ethereum, predicting it could surge past $8,000 and possibly reach between $26,000 and $35,000 by 2025-2026. He cites Ethereum\u2019s growing use cases and the support from layer 2 blockchains as drivers for this growth.\n\nContrarily, analyst FieryTrading expects Ethereum to dip to around $900.\n\nWith such varied forecasts, traders should tread cautiously. It\u2019s vital to remember: never invest more than you can afford to lose.\n\nThe road ahead\n\nAs we approach the end of 2023, Ethereum\u2019s journey has been a roller coaster of highs and lows. From a peak TVL of $108 billion in 2021 to a significant dip to $20 billion this year, it reflects the volatility and uncertainty surrounding the crypto realm.\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum\u2019s once-booming NFT market has also faced headwinds, with daily mintings witnessing a sharp decline.\n\nLayer 2 solutions, like Arbitrum, have provided a silver lining, offering scalable alternatives and showing promise for Ethereum\u2019s scalability concerns.\n\nEthereum\u2019s next significant catalyst might lie in the realm of spot ETFs. With major players like Galaxy Digital Fund and Invesco entering the fray, the potential for Ethereum spot ETFs to drive price, adoption, and mainstream acceptance is palpable.\n\nYet, amidst optimistic forecasts of Ethereum reaching dizzying heights, caution is crucial. The crypto market remains unpredictable, and prudent decision-making remains the order of the day.\n\nYou might also like: Fake news on Bitcoin ETF approval: How rumors can sway the crypto market\n\nFollow Us on Google News"
