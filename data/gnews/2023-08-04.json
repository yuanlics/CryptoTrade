        "content": "Trader Joe, the largest decentralized exchange (DEX) on proof-of-stake blockchain Avalanche, has launched on Ethereum mainnet.\n\nThe pseudonymous Fish, co-founder of Trader Joe, told Blockworks that the DEX\u2019s decision to launch on Ethereum now was driven by the opportunity to capture the stablecoin markets on the network amid the upheaval around Curve.\n\nCurve, a well-known stablecoin DEX, suffered an exploit this week that saw over $70 million in various digital assets attacked due to a bug in Vyper, the coding language used by Curve.\n\nThis latest exploit has led many liquidity providers to sell their holdings of CRV, Curve\u2019s native token. At the time of writing, CRV currently has a token liquidity of $6.75 million, a significant dip from $70.42 million before the hacks.\n\n\u201cLPs (liquidity providers) are moving to other pools, so you\u2019re seeing a lot of volume go to other DEXes,\u201d Fish told Blockworks. \u201cWe want to join and put ourselves into that mix.\u201d\n\nCapturing the stablecoin market\n\nFish notes that Trader Joe\u2019s initial plan was to deploy on Ethereum in a month or two, around the beginning of Q4, after working on improving its auto pool technology.\n\n\u201cBut this opportunity came up, and we felt this is the best time to deploy,\u201d he said.\n\nAuto pools are designed to help automate the balance of liquidity for users passively.\n\n\u201cEthereum runs a little bit slower, it is gas intensive, and our AMMs also use a lot of gas,\u201d Fish explained. \u201cIf you\u2019re managing positions in a concentrated liquidity AMM, which requires you to rebalance often, and make a lot of transactions every day, then for the average Joe it\u2019s going to be very uncomfortable for him to market make.\u201d\n\nLuckily, managing positions in a stable stablecoin market is relatively simple, Fish said.\n\n\u201cThe price of USDC and USDT isn\u2019t going to vary that much,\u201d he said. \u201cSo in most cases, people can just deploy in that range and then earn fees from within that range.\u201d\n\nTrader Joe\u2019s initial launch on Ethereum will include stablecoin pools USDC/USDT and USDC/DAI.\n\nHow Trader Joe compares to Uniswap\n\nLike Uniswap v3, Trader Joe is a concentrated liquidity AMM, providing constrained liquidity within a tight range for its users.\n\nCompared to its competitor, its unique edge is that it offers dynamic fee components, Fish noted.\n\nOn Uniswap v3, liquidity providers are offered three fee tiers, ranging from 0.05%, 0.3% and 1%.\n\nBy contrast, on Trader Joe, there is a base fixed fee and a variable component which is dependent on the volatility within the past few seconds to minutes.\n\nTrader Joe is currently deployed on Avalanche, Arbitrum and BNB chains.\n\nAccording to data on DeFiLlama, Trader Joe has a $57.45 million TVL on Avalanche, making it the largest DEX on the network.\n\nOn Arbitrum, however, it sports a TVL of $31.9 million, a significantly less amount compared to Uniswap v3, which currently reports volumes of $261.7 million.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

The numbers and how they compare to data for August will help the Federal Reserve to decide whether to continue hiking interest rates in September after reinstating its tightening campaign in July.\n\nThe S&P 500 rose at one point on Friday, reacting positively to the data, before bearish pressure came in and dropped the market ETF down under Thursday\u2019s low-of-day. In comparison, the crypto market remained muted, mostly consolidating sideways. The consolidation could continue over the weekend, but if Bitcoin breaks up or down from Wednesday's mother bar, a larger move to the upside or downside could be on the horizon.\n\nIf the general market continues to slide next week, volatility in the stock market is likely to increase.\n\nTraders wishing to trade the potential volatility have multiple options, including the ConvexityShares Daily 1.5x SPIKES Futures ETF SPKY.\n\nSPKY is a 1.5x leveraged fund, which tracks the SPIKES Futures Short-Term Index and measures volatility in broad-based equities in a similar way to the ProShares Ultra VIX Short Term Futures ETF UVXY, which tracks the movement of the S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures Index.\n\nFor every 1% daily movement in the SPIKES Futures Short-Term Index, the SPKY fund seeks to move 1.5%, meaning that it's structured for short-term trades and should not be held for a long period of time.\n\nWant direct analysis?

On Thursday, Dogecoin fell lower and on Friday, the crypto was consolidating with an inside bar pattern.\n\nIn Dogecoin\u2019s case, the inside bar leans bearish because the crypto has been trading steeply lower, but like with Bitcoin and Ethereum, traders can watch for a break up or down from Thursday's mother bar on higher-than-average volume to determine future direction,\n\nDogecoin has resistance above at $0.075 and $0.083 and support below at $0.07 and $0.065.\n\nRead Next: Revolut Pulls Plug On Crypto Trading In US, Blames \u2018Changing Regulatory Climate\u2019\n\nPhoto: Unsplash"
