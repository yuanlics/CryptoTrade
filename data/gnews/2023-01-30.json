        "content": "Around 60% of investors believe that Ethereum (ETH) has a more compelling growth outlook, according to a survey by CoinShares.\n\nAs opposed to the 60% siding with ETH, only 30% of the respondents said Bitcoin (BTC) had the most compelling growth outlook, according to the CoinShares survey.\n\nThe survey included 43 investors who managed a total of $390 billion worth of assets. Among the participants, those who identified as Wealth Managers (25%) and Family Office (25%) accounted for half of the group. Another 22% and 17% identified as Hedge Fund and Institutional, respectively.\n\nYear-to-year changes\n\nIt can be seen that a bulk of investors shifted to ETH from BTC when comparing the latest results with results from 2022.\n\nThe blue columns on the chart below represent the latest results, while the red marks show the results from last year\u2019s survey.\n\nOnly 40% of the respondents said ETH had more compelling growth potential, while only a little less than 40% chose BTC in the 2022 survey. In one year, investors who opted for ETH spiked to 60%, while the ones who voted for BTC fell to 30%.\n\nEven though investors distanced themselves from BTC, this year\u2019s results show an increase in the number of investors who invested in it. 30% of the participants own BTC, which marks an increase from 24% in 2022, according to CoinShares.\n\nDigital assets in portfolios\n\nThe latest numbers indicated that digital assets accounted for 1.1% of portfolios, which marks a significant increase from last year\u2019s 0.7%.\n\nHedge Funds especially have considerably increased their investments in digital assets, CoinShares data revealed.

With Solana\u2019s recent low of $8, a similar move for SOL would suggest a rally to roughly to $462 before the next bear market.\n\nLooking at the rest of crypto markets, Cantering Clark says that the \u201cJanuary effect,\u201d referring to cypto\u2019s tendency to rally at the beginning of the year, is likely over. He predicts a correction in the near term, potentially triggered by poor earnings reports or other macroeconomic announcements.\n\n\u201cThe January effect is done.

        "title": "ENS domains mimicking major exchanges' wallets indicate a new type of scam - crypto.news",
        "content": "Today crypto.news has been investigating the activity involving the wallets of defunct cryptocurrency exchange FTX. While examining the blockchain data, we found an apparent attempt at nefarious activity involving the Ethereum Name Service (ENS).\n\nWhat is an ENS domain?\n\nThe ENS is a decentralized domain name service built on the ethereum blockchain. It provides a more human-readable format for ethereum addresses, allowing users to send and receive funds at addresses like \u201cmyname.eth\u201d instead of the traditional long string of numbers and letters. ENS aims to make interacting with the ethereum network more accessible and more user-friendly by providing a mapping between names and ethereum addresses.\n\nThe service is decentralized and operates on a blockchain, making it resistant to censorship and control by a single entity. ENS is an important infrastructure component of the Ethereum ecosystem, facilitating the widespread adoption of decentralized applications and services built on the Ethereum network. The service does not only support ethereum addresses but also other blockchains and centralized services such as websites and instant messaging profiles.\n\nHow ENS addresses can impersonate wallets\n\nA single address registered 50 different ENS domains \u2014 most of those, if not all, are the complete hexadecimal addresses of highly active addresses with the addition of \u201c.eth\u201d at the end. One example is FTX address 0x2FAF487A4414Fe77e2327F0bf4AE2a264a776AD2 which is present among this peculiar collection as \u201c0x2FAF487A4414Fe77e2327F0bf4AE2a264a776AD2.eth.\u201d\n\nOne likely reason why those ENS domains were registered is in the hope of intercepting payments meant for the addresses that those use as domain names. Many wallets support ENS domains as addresses to which users send assets. It implies that a user sending assets to one such address would only need to misclick once to transfer tokens to the ENS domain mimicking the wallet.\n\nAlleged scammers create ENS domains mimicking crypto exchanges\n\nA quick review of the addresses with the help of blockchain analysis service Arkham Intelligence reveals that they tend to be internal addresses of cryptocurrency exchanges. We can find a Coinbase address, an FTX address, a Binance address, and many other high-profile on-chain addresses \u2014 usually multiple per entity.\n\nThe mentioned address bought a total of 50 ENS domains in March 2022 for well over $3,000 \u2014 all in compliance with the scheme described above. However, the address failed to mislead any network participant into sending funds to the wrong recipient. It has been involved in 102 transactions in total: two for funding its ENS domain shopping and 100 for acquiring and receiving the domains in question.\n\nA visualization of the on-chain activity: funding address (top left), compulsive ENS shopper (bottom left), ENS smart contract (top right.)\n\nThere is one possible reason why no funds were mistakenly sent to the owner of those ENS domains. The addresses involved tended to be ones meant for internal use. Due to this choice, the transactions that could have been misled were sent by those working in the crypto industry. Most likely, they were using a very specific wallet infrastructure that only sent to whitelisted addresses and probably did not support ENS in the first place.\n\nDespite this, there is still plenty of time for somebody to make a mistake considering that those ENS domains will only expire in about four years.\n\nThe findings follow a recent report that Reddit users on the r/CryptoCurrency subreddit raised alarm bells regarding a potential Shiba Inu (SHIB) airdrop scam.\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "title": "Ethereum 2.0: What Exactly is this New Blockchain Version? - Crypto Times",
        "content": "Ethereum \u2014 the second most popular blockchain after Bitcoin \u2014 has continually deduced methods to update its network to become better than its predecessor and major rival.\n\nAnd after a long wait, the upgraded version launched in mid-September 2022 called \u201cEthereum Merge\u201d. Originally referred to as Ethereum 2.0, the merge is an upgraded version of the Ethereum network that now uses proof-of-stake consensus.\n\nThe upgrade will allow Ethereum to scale its transaction throughput, enable new applications to drive greater utility on-chain, and further reduce cost. Let\u2019s understand how this revolutionary Merge upgrade will gear up to be future-proof to follow mass adoption.\n\nWhat is Ethereum 2.0?\n\nEthereum 2.0 is simply an upgrade to Ethereum\u2019s network. It is a multi-phased project that intends to make the blockchain network faster, cheaper, more accessible, more secure, and more effective.\n\nThis upgrade heralded the switch of Ethereum\u2019s consensus mechanism from the Proof-of-Work (PoW) model to the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) model, and brought about \u201cSharding.\u201d Sharding is reportedly the last phase of the Ethereum 2.0 transition which should be finalized by 2023.\n\nThe transition from Ethereum 1.0 to 2.0 was always in the works, and not a random event. To be honest, you hardly find any unplanned incident in the crypto space. Even the rising platform Xbitcoincapex.app (which recently made headlines in several crypto media websites) admits that no events go unprepared for in the ecosystem.\n\nIt commenced in December 2020 with the launch of the Beacon Chain, which introduced staking and PoS to the Ethereum network. Using the proof-of-stake (PoS) model over the proof-of-work (PoW) model was a major game changer for the network.\n\nNormally, with the PoW model \u2014 which was the primary consensus method used by all networks, as started by Bitcoin \u2014 miners use their sophisticated computing power to decipher complicated equations and validate blocks, which are then added to the blockchain. Each block had to be proven unique to prohibit duplication of transactions. This process rendered the whole PoW process expensive, in terms of financial resources and time to undergo.\n\nIn addition, blockchain mining utilizes a lot of electricity which isn\u2019t environmentally friendly. Then there\u2019s the issue of miners who are inferiorly stacked against their competitors, as they don\u2019t have enough resources to compete to solve these equations. There is, however, the option of miners collaborating with other miners in a \u2018mining pool\u2019 to solve these equations. But, the reward is shared amongst the miners.\n\nWith the PoS model, users \u2018validate\u2019 transactions (just like PoW mine) by \u2018staking\u2019 crypto into the network. The more funds the validators stake, the higher their rewards for participating.\n\nIn this method, the bar for entry is low as long as you have the funds to participate, (and there are other ways to get the 32 ETH needed to stake), unlike PoW which involves having expensive hardware and utilizing copious amounts of electricity.\n\nThis level of network accessibility (of Ethereum 2.0) enables better scalability, as more users are connected to the network and validate blockchain transactions. Ultimately, this leads to a higher level of security and decentralization due to multiple peoples\u2019 participation.\n\nUsing the PoS model also prevents a 51% attack, something which is prevalent in PoW models. It simply means when a user commands control of 51% of nodes and validates transactions wrongly. Since it is practically impossible to HODL 51% of tokens on the Ethereum network, the PoS model is more secure.\n\nGenerally speaking, upgrading to Ethereum 2.0 will help secure the network and allow participants, collectors, and cryptocurrency owners to stake their ETH tokens and earn rewards.\n\nWhen did Ethereum 2.0 Start?\n\nWork on Ethereum 2.0 had begun early, as previously stated. It can be summarized into four phases:\n\nPhase 0\n\nIt commenced in 2020 with what was called \u201cBeacon Chain\u201d \u2014 which introduced the PoS model to the Ethereum blockchain \u2014 enabling users to stake their ETH and become validators. Beacon Chain didn\u2019t disrupt the Ethereum 1.0 blockchain but existed alongside Ethereum\u2019s mainnet.\n\nThe first Phase provided three major technological implementations to the Ethereum ecosystem: the Beacon Chain, the PoS consensus mechanism, and validator nodes.\n\nPhase 1\n\nThe next phase was purported to launch in mid-2021 but it was delayed to early 2022, with the Ethereum developers mentioning unfinished work. In Phase 1, there was meant to be a merge of the Mainnet into the Beacon Chain, therefore switching the consensus mechanism from PoW to PoS. Miners were expected to take their holdings and stake them to evolve into validators.\n\nIn addition, the Ethereum developers intended to introduce \u201cSharding\u201d in this Phase. This is because it has a significant effect in ensuring the Ethereum network can handle an increased number of transactions.\n\nRather than settling all operations on just one blockchain, \u201cShard\u201d chains disperse these operations across 64 new chains. This enables parallel processing to decrease the latency that originates from linear processing utilizing a single blockchain.\n\nInvariably, this would lead to an increase in the transaction speed and reduce the load on the network as validators could run their Shards. Also, processing any transactions would become easier from a hardware purview, as there would be reduced data to be stored on a particular machine.\n\nPhase 2\n\nUltimately, Phase 2 came with the introduction of Ethereum Web Assembly (eWASM). It was designed to make the Ethereum 1.0 network more efficient, a subset of the proposed Ethereum smart contract execution layer.\n\nEthereum 1.0 was equipped with an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). This software interacts with dApps, evaluates gas fees for every transaction, and computes the network after each block is added to the blockchain. A fundamental constituent of the Ethereum blockchain, the EVM wears many hats. For one, it executes and terminates smart contracts, and detects if a dApp is deterministic or if a smart contract is isolated and is used by users globally.\n\nAs a result of numerous transactions occurring at once on the Ethereum blockchain, the EVM has become slow. Unfortunately, it is difficult to upgrade since it was written in complicated code, i.e Solidity. So the most likely option was to replace it.\n\nThat\u2019s where eWASM comes in. It was designed to replace the EVM in the Ethereum hierarchy. It speeds up the network process by computing codes fast and it is effectively compatible with various coding languages like C and C++. All of these are poised to make eWASM more accessible for the Ethereum blockchain, which in turn makes the network faster and more efficient.\n\nPhase 3\n\nThis phase \u2014 a miscellaneous stage \u2014 was reserved for any extra upgrade that might have been needed before Ethereum 2.0 was launched completely. For example, creating extra Shard chains to add to the original 64 chains, heightened privacy on the network, or improving the overall technology on the blockchain.\n\nIt was estimated that each phase of Ethereum 2.0 would require about six to eight months to come to total fruition. Admittedly, the long-awaited Ethereum merge finally came, in mid-September 2022. The Ethereum Foundation however remarked that the complete transition to Ethereum 2.0 would occur in 2023, as the network was highly dynamic and ever-evolving.\n\nWhy Shift to Ethereum 2.0?\n\nOver time, the Ethereum network was faced with some constraints that were affecting its efficiencies like scalability, accessibility, and security.\n\nUsers, at times, had to pay over 100% in gas fees and extra costs just to undergo minimal transactions. Plus, the network struggled to approve transactions rapidly too.\n\nAll of these necessitated the need to improve its blockchain network to achieve an expansive level of adoption from investors. This is because Ethereum finds use in dApps \u2014 which are beneficial in governance, supply chain, finance, education, etc.\n\nTherefore, Ethereum developers \u2014 led by the creator, Vitalik Buterin \u2014 established a proposed upgrade (Ethereum 2.0) and worked towards it. It is simply the transition of Ethereum\u2019s consensus mechanism from a proof-of-work (PoW) model to a proof-of-stake (PoS) model.\n\nThis was in hopes to reduce the blockchain\u2019s energy consumption by 99%, and make the network faster, more scalable, and more secure to utilize.\n\nWhat Are the Benefits of Ethereum 2.0?\n\nPreviously, Ethereum was held back by some technical limitations, but all these changed with the advent of Ethereum 2.0. These are the benefits:\n\nLess Computation Power, More Eco-friendly\n\nAs opposed to the proof-of-work (PoW) model which involves using sophisticated power to solve complex equations, the proof-of-stake (PoS) model \u2014 which Ethereum 2.0 utilizes \u2014 doesn\u2019t require such. This in turn makes it to be more eco-friendly as a single PoW transaction is reportedly said to consume as much energy as an average U.S. household in a week. Moreover, the hardware is said to generate electronic waste also.\n\nIncreased Scalability and Efficiency\n\nEthereum 1.0 computed about 25 to 30 transactions per second, but Ethereum 2.0 is said to handle 100,000 transactions per second. This increased Scalability is possible due to the Sharding technique.\n\nSharding enables Ethereum to store and access data, plus \u201cShard chains\u201d would be utilized in transactions which makes it reportedly 64 times faster than the previous blockchain version.\n\nMaking ETH a more Deflationary Asset\n\nDue to the merge, issuing Ether as block rewards would greatly reduce. There are reportedly about 13,000 ETH mined daily. The number would reduce to 1,600 ETH daily as a result of the Merge. All of which would ensure less ETH is in circulation, thereby reducing its inflationary quality.\n\nHigher Security Level\n\nEthereum 2.0 needs a minimum of 16,384 validators, enabling a decentralized network and thus securing the blockchain, by reducing the attack surface area. This prevents a 51% attack from occurring on the network.\n\nMore Network Participation\n\nWith lower hardware requirements, more people can participate in Ethereum 2.0. By using Sharding, validators don\u2019t need to store data by themselves. They can instead employ data techniques to confirm that the data has been made usable by the network. Moreover, more users can join in the staking process \u2014 provided they have 32 ETH to lock in \u2014 thereby increasing network participation.\n\nReduced Costs\n\nWith the PoW model, there was a high cost of hardware equipment, gas fees, and electricity bills. All of these are not present in Ethereum 2.0, as the PoS model doesn\u2019t require as much hardware (with Sharding) and doesn\u2019t have to pay miners gas fees, as the validators who stake ETH secure the network indirectly.\n\nWhat Are the Risks of Ethereum 2.0?\n\nThe Ethereum merge is the most significant upgrade to a blockchain network and it doesn\u2019t come without its risks:\n\nPossible Scams\n\nSome crypto-related organizations pretend as though ETH (Ether) was what was updated to Ethereum 2.0, by calling it \u201cETH 2.\u201d This is in a bid to get users to swap their ETH for the so-called ETH 2 and scam them.\n\nFeasible drop in ETH Value\n\nIf things go awry after the merge, it is possible that the value of ETH would drop, as well as other cryptos that are built on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nWhat is the Future of Ethereum?\n\nThe crux of an updated Ethereum network (Ethereum 2.0) is to enable it to process more transactions speedily while being secure and accessible.\n\nWith the transition to a PoS model from the PoW model and the advent of Sharding, expectations \u2014 from industry experts and enthusiasts alike \u2014 are high. It is expected that the merge would have an all-encompassing impact on the DeFi space. Time would tell what would happen though."
