        "Who": "Sure, here's a brief summary of the news in the aspect of Who:\n\n* Luke Nolan is a CoinShares Ethereum research associate.",
        "What": "Sure, here's a brief summary of the news in the aspect of What:\n\nThe Ethereum Dencun upgrade will enable Layer 2 transactions to be sent to the Ethereum network through blobspace, an alternative to the current transactional calldata mechanism. This could result in reduced gas usage and, consequently, a lower amount of ether being burned.",
        "When": "Sure, here's a brief summary of the news in the aspect of When:\n\nThe Ethereum Dencun upgrade is expected to be activated on the Goerli testnet on Jan. 17, and on the Sepolia and Holesky testnets on Jan. 30 and Feb. 7, respectively.",
        "Where": "The news is about the Ethereum Dencun upgrade, a network upgrade that will enable Layer 2 transactions to be sent to the Ethereum network through blobspace, an alternative to the current transactional calldata mechanism.",
        "Why": "Sure, here's a brief summary of the news in the aspect of Why:\n\nThe Dencun upgrade could potentially reduce gas fees for users transacting on the Ethereum network. This could lead to a lower amount of ether being burned, which could have a positive impact on the growth of ether supply.",
        "How": "Sure, here's a brief summary of the news in the aspect of How:\n\n* The Dencun upgrade will enable Layer 2 transactions to be sent to the Ethereum network through blobspace, an alternative to the current transactional calldata mechanism.\n* This could result in reduced gas usage and, consequently, a lower amount of ether being burned.\n* The Dencun upgrade could see gas prices settle at lower levels, which means less ether is burned.",
        "Sentiment": "The news has a negative sentiment, as it discusses the potential impact of the Ethereum Dencun upgrade on the ether supply and deflation mechanism. The upgrade could potentially lead to lower gas fees and a reduction in ether burned, which could have a negative impact on the growth of ether supply."
