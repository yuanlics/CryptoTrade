        "summary": "  Ethereum developers have separated the ERC and EIP repositories to better manage and evolve the network's application layer. The ERC repository now stores application-related changes that don't affect core network capabilities, while the EIP repository focuses on consensus layer improvements. This separation has been discussed for years but gained attention recently as the community decided to draft EIPs separately as the consensus layer began using the EIP process. An additional repository was created to store ERC requests."

        "title": "Ethereum Price Prediction As Chart Analysis Hints Last Pullback Before a Leap to $2000 - CoinGape",
        "summary": "  Ethereum price is facing resistance around $1,800 after a 22% surge in the past two weeks. Despite the recovery, the asset is facing headwinds as Bitcoin struggles to break past $35,000. The current price behavior raises concerns about an impending correction, with a potential breakdown below $1,760 risking a 15% downside. However, if the ETH price can maintain a price above $1,750, there may be an opportunity for buyers to break out from the falling wedge pattern's upper trendline, potentially leading to a recovery towards $2,000. Technical indicators such as the exponential moving average and the vortex indicator suggest that the market mood is still bullish."

        "summary": "  Ethereum has made a significant move by separating its Ethereum Requests for Comments (ERC) and Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIP) into different repositories. This separation allows for more effective governance and standards in both the application and consensus layers of Ethereum.
