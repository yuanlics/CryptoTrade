        "title": "Ethereum L2s Surprisingly Set New ATH - U.Today",
        "content": "Advertisement\n\nTotal value locked in DeFis, a crucial metric for programmable blockchains, is rallying in the segment of Ethereum-based second-layer solutions. Despite general market apathy, the net TVL of 30 leading platforms added 32% in the last four months.\n\nEthereum L2s set new all-time high in TVL\n\nYesterday, Oct. 27, 2023, the aggregated value of cryptocurrency locked in all Layer-2 platforms on Ethereum (ETH) reached a new all-time high. It briefly touched $12 billion, but then stabilized near $11.87 billion. The previous historic high was registered on April 17, at $11.85 billion.\n\nImage by L2Beat\n\nIn the last hours, it slightly retraced to $11.81 billion. As such, in USD-denominated value, it added over 114% in the last 12 months despite the pale performance of the cryptocurrency market.\n\nIn terms of Ether-denominated value, the record was registered on Oct. 11, 2023. The ecosystem reached 6.72 million Ether (ETH) locked, while it barely surpassed 3.5 million Ether (ETH) a year ago.\n\nIn the last seven days, the ecosystem of L2s added 10.36% of dollar-denominated TVL. An array of the largest L2s \u2014 Arbitrum, OP Mainnet (formerly Optimism), Starknet, ImmutableX and Loopring \u2014 posted even more impressive gains.\n\nEthereum (ETH), the most crucial asset for L2s, is up by 10.14% in the corresponding period. It revisited a multi-month low over $1,836 two days ago.\n\nArbitrum, OP Mainnet remain undisputed, rivalry rages for #3\n\nMeanwhile, the sphere of L2s on Ethereum (ETH) remains highly \"whale-dominated.\" The two largest networks \u2014 Arbitrum and OP Mainnet \u2014 are responsible for over 90% of TVL in the ecosystem.\n\nBase, the fastest-growing L2, is protecting the third position with 4.83%. It is followed by zkSync Era and dYdX with 3.8% and 3%, respectively.\n\nAs covered by U.Today previously, dYdX made the most anticipated announcement this week: It is migrating from the L2 model to being a standalone Tendermint-based Layer 1."

        "title": "Ethereum Price Prediction As Chart Analysis Hints Last Pullback Before a Leap to $2000 - CoinGape",
        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction: In the past two weeks, the Ethereum price has mounted an impressive comeback, rising from $1,527 to a peak of $1,867\u2014a 22.6% surge that has allowed it to reclaim crucial resistance levels at $1,600 and $1,700. Despite this, the asset is facing headwinds as Bitcoin struggles to break past the $35,000 mark, leading to increased selling pressure across the crypto market. This has caused the ETH recovery to stall around the $1,800 level, raising questions about an impending correction.\n\nAlso Read: Mike Novogratz\u2019s Galaxy Digital Going Long On Bitcoin And Ethereum: Lookonchain\n\nadvertisement\n\nWedge Pattern Governs the Current Correction Trend\n\nThe daily candles projecting rejecting wicks on either side reflect uncertainty among market participants.\n\nA bearish breakdown below the $1750 support put Ethereum coin 15% downside risk\n\nThe intraday trading volume in Ether is $6.6 Billion, indicating a 17% gain.\n\nSource- Tradingview\n\nOver the past seven months, the Ethereum coin price has witnessed a correction trend under the influence of a falling wedge pattern. The coin price rebounded thrice from each of the downsloping trendlines, indicating the strong influence this pattern has on market participants.\n\nThe latest recovery stalled around the pattern\u2019s upper trendline, near the $1,850 mark, as sellers continue to defend this territory. The recent price action displays long-wick projections at this resistance level, suggesting that sellers are pressuring the asset for another downward correction.\n\nTaking a bearish outlook, a break below the $1,760 mark could catalyze increased selling, potentially driving the asset back down to the lower trendline near $1,500.\n\nWill ETH Price Regain $2000 Mark?\n\nWhile the current price behavior seems concerning the prevailing bullish sentiment has not been entirely extinguished. If the ETH price can maintain a price above $1,750, there might be an opportunity for buyers to break out from the falling wedge pattern\u2019s upper trendline. Such a breakout would effectively signal the end of the ongoing correction phase, propelling buyers toward an extended recovery with a target at $2,030\u2014an estimated upside of 14%.\n\nExponential Moving Average: A potential bullish crossover between the 20 and 100 EMA slope, could bolster buyers in maintaining current recovery trends.\n\nVortex Indicator: A positive crossover state between the VI+(blue) and VI-(pink) reflects market mood is still bullish."

        "content": "A widely-followed crypto analyst says the Ethereum (ETH) rival Solana (SOL) is on the verge of another breakout that will outperform ETH and Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nPseudonymous crypto trader Bluntz tells his 225,000 followers on the social media platform X that SOL is one of his main \u201calt picks\u201d and is set to run higher not only in USD terms but also versus BTC (SOL/BTC) and ETH (SOL/ETH).\n\n\u201cSOL still one of my favorite alt picks right now.\n\nStructure on the USD pair looks very much impulsive and like an extended wave three underway and its BTC and ETH pair also still look like they are on the cusp of high timeframe accumulation breakouts.\u201d\n\nBluntz utilizes the Elliot Wave Theory in his technical analysis. The theory aims to predict price impulses based on crowd psychology, which tends to manifest in waves. Based on his chart, the analyst suggests that SOL is in the midst of a five-wave impulse to the upside that could top out near the $47 range before making its next move.\n\nWhen asked why he\u2019s so zeroed in on Solana, Bluntz says he\u2019s confident that SOL will outperform BTC and ETH in the near future.\n\nLooking at Bitcoin, the trader says that BTC\u2019s price action strongly suggests that more upside action is imminent and that a dip to $32,000 is unlikely at this point. He forecasts that BTC will make another impulse upward after consolidating within a bullish triangle pattern.\n\n\u201cThe fact that BTC is showing acceptance at these levels after that strong breakout of $32,000 is quite bullish in my opinion.\n\nI don\u2019t think we retest $32,000 at all, too many people missed the move and want that retest and I don\u2019t think the market will give it to them.\n\nI anticipate this to probably end up as a triangle and break higher.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $33,957.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "title": "Solana Vs Ethereum: A Deep-Dive Analysis of Two Popular Coins - CoinGape",
        "content": "In the crypto world, Solana (SOL) and Ethereum (ETH) are two of the most popular crypto coins that have found use cases across the board. While both projects share many similarities, there are still major differences between them. Understanding the key differences between SOL and ETH can help investors and traders make informed decisions to maximize their investments. But what factors should one take into consideration when doing a Solana vs Ethereum analysis? Here, we deep dive into the key aspects that differentiate SOL from ETH and vice versa.\n\nAbout Solana\n\nSolana, or SOL, was created by software developer Anatoly Yakovenko, who first proposed the project in 2017 and finally launched it in 2020. The coin takes inspiration from Etherum and was eventually created to improve upon Etherum. Many crypto enthusiasts and experts considered Solana a potential \u2018Ethereum killer.\u2019\n\nSolana emerged as a new-generation crypto coin that addressed several shortcomings of popular tokens launched before it. The coin\u2019s transactions are conducted on the Solana blockchain, which uses a proof-of-history consensus mechanism instead of a proof-of-work mechanism used by popular initial coins like Bitcoin.\n\nIn layman\u2019s terms, the proof-of-work mechanism depends on miners to unearth the next block and is slow and has a high energy demand. In comparison, the proof-of-history consensus mechanism is fast and requires 99.9% less energy. This is one of the main reasons why Solana took on the likes of Bitcoin and Ethereum right from the beginning.\n\nAbout Ethereum\n\nEthereum, or ETH, which was first proposed by Vitalik Buterin in his white paper in 2013, was finally launched in 2015. Buterin was joined by Gavin Wood, Charles Hoskinson, Amir Chetrit, Anthony Di Iorio, Jeffrey Wilcke, Joseph Lubin, and Mihai Alisie, who further developed and popularised the project its way to the second-largest blockchain project in the world, only behind Bitcoin.\n\nETH is the native currency of Ethereum, a decentralized blockchain that offers smart contract functionality. However, the project was also plagued with issues related to proof-of-work until September 2022, when it shifted to a proof-of-stake mechanism. The move helped it become more fast and reduced its energy needs by over 99%, making it more efficient.\n\nSolana Vs. Ethereum : An Overview\n\nSolana and Ethereum are two of the most widely used crypto tokens globally. But to better understand how these two crypto coins are pitting against each other, we have taken several factors into consideration to provide you with a detailed snapshot.\n\nGoogle Trends: Solana Vs Ethereum\n\nGoogle Trends is one of the key metrics to determine the interest of crypto enthusiasts in particular coins. For the past 12 months in 2023, Ethereum clearly has the edge over Solana in terms of search volumes and interest of the global crypto community.\n\nCaption: Interest over time of Solana and Ethereum {Solana (Blue); Ethereum (Red)}\n\nActive Addresses: Solana Vs. Ethereum\n\nActive Addresses is another important metric that can give you an insight into the adoption of a coin. In simple terms, an active address is a crypto address that has become a direct participant in a successful transaction. It can be either the sender\u2019s or receiver\u2019s address.\n\nActive Addresses Solana\n\nSolana\u2019s active addresses, which peaked at around 39.64 million in April 2022, are nowhere close to its days of glory. However, the token has witnessed a decent rise in active addresses in the last 30 days. In October 2023, active addresses on Solana stood at 5.33 million as of 28 October.\n\nActive Addresses Ethereum\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt that Ethereum is a more popular crypto coin than Solana. Therefore, naturally, the former has a more stable number of active addresses than the latter. In October, Ethereum\u2019s number of active addresses was 10.35 million as of 28 October.\n\nMonthly Transactions (Solana & Ethereum)\n\nMonthly transactions in crypto refer to the buying, selling, and exchanging of digital currencies within a given month. Comparing Ethereum and Solana\u2019s monthly transactions will help you understand which coin is being preferred for transactions by crypto enthusiasts.\n\nSolana Monthly Transactions\n\nNon-vote Solana transactions peaked in November 2021 at 1.5 billion. The last time it was near the 1 billion mark was in July 2022. The number of non-vote transactions has kept fluctuating since then. In October, the number of non-vote transactions showed improvement. As of 28 October, the number of non-vote transactions was up at 550.4 million from 494.7 million in September and 519.83 million in August 2023.\n\nEthereum Monthly Transactions\n\nIn terms of monthly transactions, Ethereum made a record in May 2021, when the token was involved in 20.27 transactions. While ETH\u2019s number of transactions has fallen since then, it has remained stable in the range of 12 million to 17 million. However, in October, the number of Ethereum-based transactions could see a serious fall as it stands at 10.35 million as of 28 October.\n\nAlso Read : Shiba Inu Vs Dogecoin : A Deep Dive Into The Ecosystem\n\nPrice Chart: Solana Vs Ethereum\n\nAnalyzing and comparing Solana and Ethereum price charts can provide key insights that can help in making informed decisions. CoinGape price comparison chart above demonstrates price trend and market performances of both Solana and Ethereum. While Ethereum price is up by over 85%, Solana price is surging significantly by more than 450% as of December 2023 in the last 12 months.\n\nMarket Cap & Trading Volume: Solana Vs Ethereum\n\nThe market cap of cryptocurrencies gives an indication of the coin\u2019s value and size. Ethereum, being the more popular crypto coin, clearly has a higher market cap of over $284 billion while Solana has a market cap of $32billion. On the other hand, Ethereum\u2019s circulating supply at present stands at 120.2 million and that of Solana\u2019s is at 425.9 million.\n\nComing to the trading volume of both the cryptocurrencies, Ethereum\u2019s trading volume stands at over $12 billion with a decrease of 23% in the last 24 hours as of December 9, 2023. And, Solana\u2019s trading volume is more than $3 billion and is down by 21% in the last 24 hours.\n\nConclusion : Which coin is more popular ?\n\nEthereum and Solana are two of the most popular cryptocurrencies in today\u2019s time. Both the coins have found several use cases, and are witnessing an increased adoption in multiple areas. At present, with a larger market cap and higher active addresses, it\u2019s clear that Ethereum is finding more traction among crypto users. However, Solana, which faced a massive setback after its links with FTX were found, is gaining the lost ground, and could soon again give a tough competition to Ethereum. In all likelihood, it\u2019s going to be more interesting from here. Stay tuned!"
