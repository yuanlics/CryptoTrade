        "content": "Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson recently gave a sarcastic response to the plans to redesign Ethereum staking structure by Vitalik Buterin.\n\nAs two protocols that offer similar value propositions, Charles Hoskinson\u2019s latest reaction to Ethereum\u2019s grand staking plans proves the Cardano founder still believes in the former\u2019s design flaws.\n\nDespite ranking below Ethereum in market capitalization, Cardano\u2019s founder often touts the protocol\u2019s liquid staking offering as the de facto standard for judging a decentralized system.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe Ethereum Staking Plans\n\nSpeaking at an event in Turkey, Vitalik Buterin admitted that the centralized nature of Ethereum is not ideal. Notably, he called out the multiple staking pools model and acknowledged Ethereum\u2019s \u201csolo staking being hard.\u201d According to Vitalik Buterin, there is a need to tackle these challenges via the unspent transaction (UTxO) approach.\n\nStaking in the crypto ecosystem is a volatile concept in relation to regulatory allowance. Earlier this year, Kraken paid $30 million to settle a legal case with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for offering staking as an unregistered investment contract.\n\nSince then, Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain protocols started exploring how to change the nature of their Staking features. The plan to redesign the Staking service came as soon as Ethereum transitioned from its Proof-of-Work (PoW) system to PoS.\n\nThough the SEC has not flagged the protocol in this regard, Vitalik Buterin\u2019s proposition to decentralize the offering could make it less susceptible to falling under the regulator\u2019s radar.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nCardano Founder and Community\u2019s Position\n\nDesigned as an Ethereum killer with a mission to help cut on cost and speed of transactions, Charles Hoskinson takes every opportunity to sing Cardano\u2019s praises.\n\nNotably, his simple response to Vitalik Buterin\u2019s proposition reads: \u201cNo worries, Ethereum 3 will have it all sorted.\u201d\n\nEthereum 1 is generally denoted as the PoW era and Ethereum 2.0 is the current stage with a PoS consensus mechanism. Neither Vitalik Buterin nor the Ethereum Foundation has hinted at any potential Ethereum 3 in the future.\n\nThe fight for dominance continues and though Cardano seems ahead in most of the innovations Ethereum plans to implement, as community members pointed out, the DeFi Total Value Locked (TVL) of both protocols shows Cardano has a long way to go before catching up with Ethereum."

        "title": "Ethereum Upgrade EIP 4844 Is Massive for L2s, Here's Why - U.Today",
        "content": "Advertisement\n\nEIP 4844 or \"Proto-Danksharding\" is known as the most anticipated upgrade for Ethereum (ETH), the largest smart contracts blockchain. Besides being a game-changer in transaction fees economy, it is set to significantly increase the transactional capacity of L2s on Ethereum (ETH).\n\nEIP 4844 to lower L2 fees by 7x, Ryan Berckmans says\n\nEthereum's EIP 4844 data blobs are expected to kick off in three months to greatly reduce L2 fees, Ethereum (ETH) veteran Ryan Berckmans stated on X. The drop in L2 transactional commissions will be accompanied by advanced bandwidth on the network.\n\nEthereum's EIP 4844 data blobs launch in ~3 months to greatly reduce L2 fees\n\n\n\nBy now, many people know that blobs initially give us ~7x data bandwidth (iirc), which is huge but not enough for global ubiquity.\n\n\n\nWhat's less well known may be that\n\n\n\n1) blob gas doesn't compete with\u2026 \u2014 Ryan Berckmans ryanb.eth (@ryanberckmans) November 25, 2023\n\nOnce launched, blob gas will not be competing with L1 execution gas, so the entire blob market should clear at substantially lower fees even if every blob is always sold. As a result, both cost-efficiency and throughput of Ethereum (ETH) will be increased by 600%.\n\nWith the EIP 4844 activation, L2 solutions of various types will scale Ethereum (ETH) in a novel way. Both solutions with ZK-secured validity proofs (Polygon zkEVM, Starknet) and hybrid optimistic rollups (Arbitrum Nova) will benefit from the upgrade and contribute to Ethereum (ETH) scaling.\n\nThis will be the next big thing for usability and accessibility of Ethereum (ETH), the investor says:\n\nEthereum's most accessible days are coming soon. In time for the bull!\n\nAs covered by U.Today previously, the Ethereum (ETH) community is expecting the EIP 4844 activation to make all of its L2s faster and cheaper.\n\nMore advances for Ethereum L2 rollups\n\nThe hotly anticipated upgrade is set to be confirmed in Q1, 2024, after a series of shadow forks and testnet updates.\n\nMeanwhile, one more game-changing upgrade might unlock new opportunities for Ethereum (ETH) L2s. As U.Today reported, a proposal to add native account abstraction to Layer 2 solutions was released by developers the previous week.\n\nRIP-7560: Native Account Abstraction is the first-ever rollup-specific performance upgrade proposal.\n\nThe implementation of AA in rollups would require three changes in smart contract accounts: EntryPoint address adjustment, validateUserOp function rewrite and some minor updates to transaction logics."

        "content": "A widely followed crypto strategist believes that two altcoins running on the Ethereum (ETH) network are gearing up for a burst to the upside.\n\nPseudonymous analyst Kaleo tells his 606,600 followers on the social media platform X that he\u2019s bullish on ApeCoin (APE), the digital asset associated with the Bored Ape Yacht Club non-fungible token (NFT) collection.\n\nThe analyst shares a chart that suggests APE is taking out a diagonal resistance that has kept the altcoin in a downtrend for over a year and a half.\n\n\u201cNot fading this APE breakout. Up until the last month, BLUR and LOOKS have both traded in lockstep with APE. NFTs are starting to pick up some momentum. I see it as only a matter of time before APE catches up.\n\nJust for reference: \u2013 BLUR is up 320% from the lows \u2013 LOOKS is up 235% from the lows \u2013 APE is up 65% from the lows.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, APE is trading for $1.69, up over 12% in the last 24 hours.\n\nThe analyst is also keeping a close watch on the move-to-earn crypto project STEPN (GMT). According to Kaleo, GMT has been trading within an ascending channel after moving above its high time frame diagonal resistance.\n\n\u201cAfter seeing BLUR send a post airdrop from the announcement of infinite Ponzi mechanics, I\u2019m open to the idea of it being infinite Ponzi season.\n\nSo, I longed GMT.\n\nDespite the bleed over the past 18 months, STEPN has remained active, and considering how everything in the Solana ecosystem that\u2019s maintained a decent level of activity has been popping off lately \u2013 I think STEPN could run.\n\nThe chart looks great retesting July highs after a high time frame breakout; could easily see a squeeze out of the channel to $0.60 \u2013 $1.00.\u201d\n\nKaleo also says that GMT appears to be following the price action of the smart contract protocol Avalanche (AVAX) when it traded within an ascending channel last month before breaking out.\n\nDropping a comparison of $AVAX trending in an ascending channel after its HTF breakout (first picture) to show how $GMT could accelerate out of its current channel (second picture) pic.twitter.com/3IXHVh7TnM \u2014 K A L E O (@CryptoKaleo) November 24, 2023\n\nAt time of writing, GMT is worth $0.346, up over 20% in the last 24 hours.\n\nAs for Bitcoin (BTC), the analyst thinks that the crypto king is poised to soar above $40,000.\n\n\u201cSniped the bottom down to the minute.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nRecently announced Ethereum layer-2 scaling network Blast, led by the founder of top NFT marketplace Blur, has pulled in over half a billion dollars worth of locked funds from users seeking yield and rewards\u2014but also faced substantial criticism over its rollout. And now early investor Paradigm has joined the list of parties with issues over the launch.\n\nOn Sunday, Paradigm Head of Research and General Partner Dan Robinson shared a post on X (aka Twitter) that took Blast\u2019s launch to task, attributing his comments to \u201cwe at Paradigm,\u201d suggesting it conveyed the prominent crypto-centric venture capital firm\u2019s stance.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of components of Blast that I\u2019m excited about and would be interested in engaging with people on,\u201d Robinson wrote. \u201cThat said, we at Paradigm think the announcement this week crossed lines in both messaging and execution.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cFor example, we don\u2019t agree with the decision to launch the bridge before the L2, or not to allow withdrawals for three months, since we think it sets a bad precedent for other projects,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe also think much of the marketing cheapens the work of a serious team.\u201d\n\nThere are a lot of components of Blast that I\u2019m excited about and would be interested in engaging with people on. That said, we at Paradigm think the announcement this week crossed lines in both messaging and execution. For example, we don\u2019t agree with the decision to launch the\u2026 \u2014 Dan Robinson (@danrobinson) November 26, 2023\n\nBlast is billed as an Ethereum layer-2 network that offers \u201cnative yield for Ethereum and stablecoins,\u201d letting users stake (or lock up) their funds in the network to earn an interest-like return.\n\nThe network also promises Blur-like \u201crewards\u201d ahead for users, enticing early adopters to lock up their funds ahead of a potential airdrop ahead. Blur has already awarded hundreds of millions of dollars worth of its BLUR token to NFT traders, catapulting the marketplace ahead of former leader OpenSea in the process, and that historical example may be enticing for crypto users.\n\nHowever, while users have been excitedly locking up their funds ahead of Blast\u2019s network launch in 2024\u2014bringing Blast\u2019s total value locked (TVL) to about $535 million at present, per data from DeFi Llama\u2014the team has also faced significant criticism in the process.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEssentially, early users are locking their funds into a bridge that will eventually connect from Ethereum to Blast\u2014but the Blast network isn\u2019t actually live yet. And those funds cannot be withdrawn until the expected mainnet rollout in February, drawing security concerns due to the industry\u2019s history of network bridges being exploited for vast sums of crypto. Some traders and industry builders have also called Blast a Ponzi scheme, given its rewards and referral model.\n\nBlast and Blur co-founder Tieshun \u201cPacman\u201d Roquerre has rebuked such complaints, writing in a Twitter thread on Friday that there were \u201ca number of misunderstandings\u201d around Blast and attempting to address them.\n\n1/ There's a meme going around that Blast is a ponzi. The yield that Blast provides users can feel too good to be true, so this meme is understandable. But to put it simply, the yield Blast provides comes (initially) from Lido and MakerDAO. Lido yield comes from ETH staking\u2026 \u2014 Pacman | Blur + Blast (@PacmanBlur) November 24, 2023\n\nHe also said Friday that Paradigm\u2014which was one of the investors in Blast\u2019s $20 million seed round\u2014had no role in Blast\u2019s rollout plans. In fact, Pacman revealed then that Paradigm asked the Blast team to \u201cmake changes\u201d to the launch and that Blast was considering them, but that it would ultimately make any decisions in-house.\n\nRobinson on Sunday praised Pacman and his team for the launch of Blur, which disrupted the NFT market and provided substantial rewards to users in the process. However, Robinson ultimately said that Paradigm and Blast weren\u2019t aligned on certain elements of the rollout, and he felt a need on Paradigm\u2019s behalf to try and advocate for \u201cbest practices\u201d in the industry.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been discussing our concerns with the team and appreciate their willingness to engage with us, but there are still many points of disagreement,\u201d Robinson wrote. \u201cWe invest in strong, independent founders who we don\u2019t always agree with. But we understand that people may look to us to set an example on best practices in crypto.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t endorse these kinds of tactics and take our responsibility in the ecosystem seriously,\u201d Robinson concluded.\n\nDecrypt reached out to both Paradigm and Blast for comment, but did not immediately hear back from either side.\n\nAD\n\nAD"
