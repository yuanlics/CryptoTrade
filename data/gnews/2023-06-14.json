        "content": "Lastly, we see strong growth and a shift toward off-chain execution continuing for several reasons. First, the Ethereum protocol continues to move in this direction and will particularly do so with its next upgrade, including proto-danksharding, which expands Ethereum\u2019s data availability capabilities. Moreover, not only is the base layer itself improving, but so, too, are the layer 2s, with improved decentralization and new paradigms around interconnectivity and shared security ahead. And these base and secondary layer improvements will come together to enable new use cases and functionality, creating a virtuous cycle. Portended by rising ecosystem transaction counts, Ethereum is perhaps on its way to becoming the world\u2019s settlement layer."

        "title": "Ethereum Can Reach $50000 in 2030? Let's Find Out - Watcher Guru",
        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) surpassing Bitcoin (BTC) as the largest crypto ecosystem, has been a major topic of debate over the past few years. The event is sometimes dubbed \u201cthe flippening.\u201d However, regardless of ETH becoming the number one crypto, a report by VanEck said that the token could reach $50,000 in 2030. In the first six months of 2023, ETH has risen by around 45%, which is quite impressive. BTC, on the other hand, has increased by as much as 57%.\n\nVanEck\u2019s valuation method is based on a number of fundamental components. The first part is Ethereum\u2019s business model, which mainly depends on transaction fees. The second part is the ETH coin supply, which falls over time and supports the crypto\u2019s price to increase. Additionally, the third part is what VanEck referred to as the \u201cbroad market capture strategy.\u201d In essence, it means that Ethereum is currently involved in almost everything blockchain-related.\n\nCan Ethereum realistically reach $50k?\n\nETH is one of the most development-heavy blockchain projects in the industry. This is a fundamental metric for future growth. Although rival networks have appeared, none are as significant as ETH. Moreover, the recent pressure from regulators has greatly affected rival networks like Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), and Polygon (MATIC). All three were named by the U.S. SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) in its suit against Coinbase. However, Ethereum (ETH) was said to not be a security. This keeps ETH at a fairly safe distance from the recent chaos.\n\nAdditionally, ETH has a lot of room to grow. The difference between the largest and second-largest crypto projects is massive, and the gap could be lessened in the future. Moreover, ETH has a lot more use cases than BTC. Therefore, it could see even greater adoption in the years to come. In fact, the \u201cflippening\u201d might very well happen within a few years. Therefore, VanEck\u2019s forecast of ETH reaching $50k by 2030, seems very possible. At press time, ETH was trading at $1,745.50, down 0.5% in the last 24 hours."

        "content": "The Graph, a blockchain indexing protocol founded in 2018, is fully migrating to the Arbitrum network from Ethereum on Wednesday.\n\nThe Graph\u2019s move to the popular layer-2 was initiated by network participants in an attempt to lower gas fees, accelerate transactions, and increase the protocol\u2019s accessibility, according to a press release from The Graph Foundation.\n\nEdge & Node CEO Tegan Kline said users weighed the options among layer-2 networks and Arbitrum ultimately came out on top.\n\n\u201cThe Graph users have continually searched for solutions to improve gas efficiencies and enhance other aspects of the network,\u201d Kline said in a statement. \u201cAfter careful consideration of all options on the market, the ecosystem selected Arbitrum as the Layer 2 scaling solution that will bring speed and affordability to protocol developers and network participants.\u201d\n\nThis has been long in the making, with plans to move being known as far back as April 2022 via a governance proposal that suggested creating a set of contracts that would bridge GRT transactions to Arbitrum. Discussions about moving to a layer-2 network because of prohibitively expensive gas prices date back to November 2021 on The Graph\u2019s forums.\n\nA June 2022 proposal was the first to present a deployment of The Graph on Arbitrum. Its proposers, Edge & Node software engineers Pablo Carranza V\u00e9lez and Ariel Barmat, suggested it wasn\u2019t a good idea to migrate in \u201cone go.\u201d\n\nSince then, The Graph has gradually taken more steps to exit the Ethereum network, including enabling indexing rewards on Arbitrum and deploying transfer tools enabling users to move tokens to Arbitrum. Both proposals were passed unanimously.\n\nThe statement from The Graph Foundation further explained that its users should start receiving transition prompts today.\n\n\u201cProtocol users will be presented with an option to transition to Arbitrum across The Graph\u2019s suite of products. Protocol rewards will continue to gradually shift from Ethereum to Arbitrum, and over time, will transition entirely to Arbitrum,\u201d the press release said.\n\nUpdated June 14, 2023 at 2:00 pm ET: A previous version of this article stated that The Graph migrated to Arbitrum on Tuesday. The protocol made the switch on Wednesday.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nIf you\u2019re on the hunt for a casual, free-to-play mobile game that pays you cryptocurrency along the way, Ethereum Blast might do the trick.\n\nWhile I wouldn\u2019t go so far as to say I had a \u201cblast\u201d playing through the simplistic color-matching puzzle stages, it\u2019s a decently fun diversion that can put a little bit of Ethereum or Bitcoin into your wallet while you play.\n\nBling Financial\u2019s free iOS and Android game is a simple color-matching puzzle game with a vibe that\u2019s best described as \u201csci-fi meets Ethereum.\u201d All that really means is that you\u2019ll see the familiar Ethereum symbol floating around the menus and interface here and there, and people who aren\u2019t crypto die-hards shouldn\u2019t be turned off by that modest window dressing.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEthereum Blast is a straightforward puzzler, tasking you with tapping two or more connected, like-colored stones to clear them from the board. As you clear stones, new ones fall from above to fill the space and potentially sets up larger matches that can earn you power-ups in the process. Each level provides certain targets of stones or items to clear within a limited number of moves.\n\nScreenshots from Ethereum Blast on iOS. Image: Decrypt\n\nIt\u2019s all easy to grasp and control, with simple taps used to clear blocks or activate power-ups. But it\u2019s also largely unchallenging and mostly mindless, and you'll earn plenty of power-ups to get you out of any binds. I played through nearly 50 stages and only lost once along the way. But as a simple on-the-go distraction, it\u2019s pleasant enough\u2014much like Tetro Tiles, another mobile puzzler with crypto rewards.\n\nHow much can you reasonably earn by playing? Your mileage may vary, but I earned about $0.20 worth of crypto in about two hours of play. Bling\u2019s games reward you with Bling points that you can then convert into Ethereum or Bitcoin, and then cash out to a Coinbase or PayPal account. I cashed out in ETH, but it would\u2019ve been the same USD value in Bitcoin too.\n\nIt\u2019s not much\u2014but it\u2019s more than I earned playing Bling\u2019s Bitcoin Solitaire, which earned me about $0.09 worth of Bitcoin in a two-hour span. However, your earning potential in Ethereum Blast diminishes the more you play, as the amount of Bling points offered for playing each stage appears to dwindle over time. The game may not hold your interest for long anyway.\n\nAnd to be clear, the amount of ads you\u2019ll watch to earn even pennies\u2019 worth of crypto is pretty overwhelming. You\u2019ll face a full-screen video ad after nearly each completed level, and these typically last for a minute or more before you\u2019re able to tap your way out of them. Given how short the levels are, that means you\u2019ll spend about as much time playing as watching ads.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIs that worth it to make about $0.10 per hour? Honestly, I\u2019d rather spend my time playing a more engaging mobile puzzler without crypto rewards\u2014like Threes or Grindstone, or my on-and-off guilty pleasure, Candy Crush Saga. But if you\u2019re intent on \u201cstacking sats\u201d or eking out ETH while playing games, Ethereum Blast is a solid option."

        "title": "Just How Realistic Is a $50,000 Price Target for Ethereum? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Through the first six months of 2023, Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) has been one of the top-performing cryptocurrencies, up more than 45% year to date. It now trades around $1,745, after briefly breaking through the $2,000 level earlier this year. However, Ethereum is still down by nearly 65% from its all-time high of $4,891.70.\n\nGiven Ethereum's performance this year, some investors are now recalibrating and putting more aggressive price targets on the token. Most recently, New York-based investment firm VanEck put out a head-spinning $50,000 price target for Ethereum by 2030. Given Ethereum's current price, that implies a more than 25x return. But just how realistic is that?\n\nThe bullish scenario for Ethereum\n\nVanEck's valuation model is based on several key building blocks, so this is not the sort of pie-in-the-sky price target that is so commonly promoted by super-bullish crypto enthusiasts. The first building block is Ethereum's revenue model, which relies primarily on transaction fees. The second building block is Ethereum's coin supply, which is actually decreasing over time, helping to prop up the crypto's price. And the third building block is what VanEck calls the \"broad market capture strategy\" of Ethereum. Basically, this means that Ethereum is involved in just about everything blockchain-related these days.\n\nFor each of these building blocks, it is then possible to construct a base, bear, and bull case scenario. For the bullish scenarios to take place, Ethereum needs to remain the market leader in every niche of the blockchain sector, such as non-fungible tokens (NFTs), while also broadening the number of real-world applications in which it is used in areas such as finance, banking, and payments. This is what a broad market-capture strategy would look like for the next seven years.\n\nTransaction volume and growth forecasts\n\nWhen it was founded back in 2015, Ethereum had a clear first-mover advantage. At that time, it had no legitimate Layer 1 blockchain rivals. But now, Ethereum must contend with the likes of Solana, Avalanche, and Cardano. And each of these Layer 1 blockchain rivals will continue to chip away at Ethereum's transaction volume. This makes it highly unlikely that Ethereum will hit the revenue targets in the bull case scenario. Right now, VanEck is projecting that transaction fees (i.e., revenue) will explode by more than 50x between now and 2030.\n\nThat doesn't seem likely, given that Ethereum continues to rely on a patchwork system of Layer 2 blockchains (which sit on top of its main blockchain) to process all of those transactions. VanEck views this Layer 2 ecosystem as a positive for Ethereum, and seems to suggest that the transaction fees generated on these blockchains should be factored into the overall revenue mix of Ethereum.\n\nBut I'm not so convinced that this Layer 2 blockchain activity should be seen as a sign of strength. From my perspective, they are just further proof that Ethereum is having a hard time going one-on-one with its rival Layer 1 blockchains, which are still much faster and much cheaper to use. Ethereum is most likely years away from reaching its peak transaction-processing capabilities.\n\nCan Ethereum reach $50,000?\n\nGiven all of the above, VanEck appears to be too aggressive in its growth assumptions for Ethereum. For example, VanEck currently projects revenue for the category \"metaverse, social, and gaming\" to balloon by 50x in its bull case scenario. Counting on massive growth in this category seems flawed given that the metaverse investment thesis has completely imploded over the past 18 months.\n\nAnd not taking into account all the potential for its Layer 1 rivals to chip away at its dominance seems short-sighted to me. Plus, it's important to keep in mind regulatory risk. If the Securities and Exchange Commission ever rules that Ethereum is a security, that would pose a huge risk to Ethereum's business model.\n\nSimply put, a $50,000 price forecast just seems too aggressive. Remember: the all-time high for Ethereum is under $5,000, and Ethereum has already shown real weakness this year when it comes to pushing past the $2,000 mark. That being said, I'm still bullish on Ethereum both in the short term and the long term. It is a highly diversified crypto with exposure to every sector of the blockchain world. But I am readjusting my own expectations about Ethereum to keep them as realistic as possible."
