        "content": "The hacker behind the largest DeFi exploit of 2023 continues to demonstrate controversial behavior, as this time, they returned the majority of the funds stolen from Euler Finance.\n\nIn two separate transactions, the perpetrator sent back over $100 million worth of ETH to the protocol.\n\nCryptoPotato reported the flash loan attack, which took place earlier in March, that saw $198 million worth of USDC, staked ether, wrapped BTC, and DAI siphoned off the DeFi lending protocol. Later reports suggested that this vulnerability was evident for over eight months before the exploit.\n\nThe team behind the project offered the attacker a $20 million bounty, which they rejected, and started laundering portions of the proceeds via TornadoCash.\n\nInterestingly, the perpetrator returned some funds to an Euler user who complained on Twitter. Shortly after, the attacker also sent back some ether to the DeFi protocol, while reports suggested that they could be linked to the notorious Lazarus Group.\n\nFurther on-chain data from this weekend show that the hacker made two separate transactions returning over $104 million worth of ETH to Euler Finance.\n\nThe first was carried out on March 25, in which they sent back 51,000 ETH. The second, which happened hours later, saw the return of another 7,737 ETH.\n\nThe decision to return the majority of the funds positively affected the protocol\u2019s native EUL token, which is up by more than 35% on a 24-hour scale."

        "content": "Ethereum exchange balance hit a five-year low as more holders moved their assets to self-custody options and DeFi platforms.\n\nThe decline in exchange balance can be attributed to factors such as the rise of DeFi, the switch to PoS, and the downturn in the crypto market.\n\nThe beginning of the year ushered in a whirlwind of events that significantly influenced the crypto industry, with Ethereum being (ETH) no exception.\n\nThe current state of affairs, including the SEC\u2019s regulatory crackdown and potential bank runs, has undoubtedly left ETH holders feeling disillusioned. However, other factors might be responsible for the dwindling ETH exchange balance.\n\nRead Ethereum [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nEthereum exchange balance declines\n\nIn 2022, the FTX crash sent shockwaves through the crypto world, causing many holders to question the safety of keeping their assets on exchanges.\n\nThe incident sparked a renewed interest in self-custody to secure crypto holdings. However, while Ethereum experienced a decrease in exchange balances in the months following the crash, this trend can be attributed to other factors beyond fear of exchange insecurity.\n\nEthereum exchange netflow flashes negative\n\nAccording to a recent Glassnode chart from Glassnode alerts, the balance of Ethereum held on exchanges has been steadily decreasing.\n\nAs of this writing, the exchange balance had reached a five-year low, hovering just above $18 million. This trend indicates that more ETH holders are opting for alternative storage methods rather than leaving their assets on exchanges.\n\nIn addition, a closer examination of Ethereum\u2019s exchange netflow reveals that the outflow of ETH from exchanges has exceeded the inflow, with few exceptions of inflow spikes.\n\nCurrently, the netflow of ETH on exchanges remains negative, with outflow continuing to dominate. At the time of writing, the netflow had surpassed 11,000 ETH already, highlighting the ongoing trend of ETH holders moving their assets away from exchanges.\n\nPossible reasons for declining exchange balance\n\nOne possible factor is the rise of decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms built on the Ethereum network. Many holders have moved their funds from centralized exchanges to DeFi protocols to earn higher yields.\n\nThe yields come through liquidity provision, staking, or other forms of participation in decentralized finance. Also, ETH stakes account for 15% of the coins in circulation per staking rewards.\n\nIt is also possible that some holders took a more long-term investment approach by holding their assets in personal wallets. It is a means of storing value and avoiding short-term trading risks.\n\nAlso, the crypto market experienced a downturn in the latter half of 2022. The downturn may have led some holders to move their assets off exchanges and into personal wallets.\n\nDaily timeframe move and 365-day MVRV\n\nDespite experiencing a decent price run, Ethereum (ETH) had yet to regain the price zone it dropped back in May. As of this writing, it was trading at approximately $1,740 and had sustained losses for two consecutive days. However, ETH had maintained a support level of around $1,732 and $1,630, previously resistance levels.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nThe 365-day Market Value to Realized Value ratio (MVRV) revealed that for most of the period being analyzed, ETH was trading below zero.\n\nHowever, as of this writing, the MVRV had surpassed the zero line and currently sat at 13.60%. This indicated that, on average, the holders of ETH were now profitable, given the price at which they acquired their coins."

        "title": "A Bull Market Is Coming: One Crypto to Buy Now - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "It's no secret that the crypto market has been struggling over the past year. The entire sector has lost nearly two-thirds of its value since late 2021, with its market cap dropping from a staggering $3 trillion to around $1.19 trillion.\n\nMany investors are also concerned that a recession is looming. If that happens, this crypto winter could drag on even longer.\n\nThe good news, though, is that a bull market is coming eventually. And there's one investment you may want to load up on now before prices surge: Ethereum (ETH 1.41%).\n\nWhy Ethereum is well-positioned for a bull market\n\nLaunched in 2015, Ethereum has proven that it can withstand market volatility. It's faced countless downturns over the past several years, including a particularly severe slump in 2018 when its price fell by a whopping 94%.\n\nWhile past performance doesn't predict future returns, Ethereum's long history is more promising than that of many other cryptocurrencies. Currently, its price is down by roughly 64% from its peak, which is far from the worst it's seen.\n\nEthereum's position in the crypto market also gives it a clear advantage. It's the primary blockchain for decentralized applications ranging from NFT marketplaces to DeFi projects to the metaverse. If any of those applications gain widespread usage, Ethereum will be in a great position to benefit from it.\n\nFinally, Ethereum developers have proven that they're committed to improving the blockchain. Last year, The Merge went off without a hitch, successfully moving the network to a proof-of-stake protocol and vastly reducing its energy usage. And future updates will aim to reduce transaction times and fees, making the blockchain faster and more affordable for users.\n\nIs crypto a smart buy right now?\n\nWhen the entire market is shaky, it can be nerve-wracking to invest anywhere -- let alone in an industry that's famous for its volatility. Before investing in Ethereum, it's important to consider whether you're willing to take on the risk involved in buying cryptocurrency.\n\nIt's almost guaranteed that the stock market will recover from this downturn. After all, the market has existed for many decades and recovered from dozens of slumps during that time. Sooner or later, this bear market will give way to a bull market.\n\nBut crypto is still in its infancy, so there are no promises that this sector will survive over the long haul.\n\nIf the crypto market thrives, Ethereum may be a fantastic buy right now. Because prices are lower, you can stock up at a discount and then reap the rewards when the market recovers. But if crypto doesn't succeed over time, even the strongest investments may fail.\n\nBefore you buy, think about whether that's a risk you're willing to take. When in doubt, ask yourself which scenario you'd regret more: investing now and losing money if crypto fails, or not investing and missing out on potentially lucrative returns if crypto succeeds.\n\nThere's no right or wrong answer here, as your risk tolerance is personal. But it's important to understand the potential downsides involved when investing in crypto, as there are never any guarantees in this sector.\n\nWeighing risk versus reward\n\nEthereum is in a unique position, as it's a strong investment in a speculative industry. The blockchain has several distinct advantages and is well-diversified across many different niches within the crypto space -- from NFTs to DeFi to the metaverse, and more.\n\nBut because crypto is still speculative, Ethereum's long-term success may hinge on whether the sector, as a whole, survives. Because nobody knows what the future holds for crypto, Ethereum is still a risky investment.\n\nWhile there are serious risks to consider, it remains one of the strongest players in the field. And if there's one cryptocurrency I'm keeping in my portfolio for the long haul, it's Ethereum."

        "content": "In brief Stealth addresses provide more privacy for transactions on Ethereum.\n\nThe system offers a method of privacy similar to generating a new address for each transaction but without the hassle of manually creating those addresses each time.\n\nA stealth address can be thought of as a wallet address that is cryptographically tied to the recipient's public address, but that is only revealed to the parties transacting.\n\nYour Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nStealth addresses provide privacy for transactions on Ethereum. While it\u2019s impossible to completely hide a blockchain transaction, stealth addresses can, at the very least, conceal the recipient's identity. And in doing so, offer an added layer of protection for anyone who doesn't want the transaction data overtly tied to them.\n\nOn a distributed ledger (a public record of transactions), anyone can view details of a transaction such as the date, the amount, and the wallets or the entities involved. They can search the specific transaction ID or hash on a block explorer, such as etherscan for Ethereum or Blockstream for Bitcoin.\n\nThat said, attempts to enhance privacy in the Ethereum ecosystem aren't without challenges both from a regulatory and technical standpoint. Case in point: the obstacles with Tornado Cash in 2019 (OFAC sanctions aside). Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin noted that the virtual currency mixer is only able to hide ETH or major ERC-20s tokens. This leaves a gap for other widely-used assets native to the Ethereum protocol such as POAPs, NFTs, and ENS names. Hence the reason for stealth addresses.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nStealth addresses can conceal the recipient's identity.\n\nProposed by Buterin in a recent blog post, a \"stealth address system\" would offer enhanced privacy protections for users, regardless of how small the transaction size or the asset in question.\n\nHow do stealth addresses work?\n\nParaphrasing Buterin, this is how stealth addresses work:\n\nEither the recipient (let\u2019s call them \u201cBob\u201d) or the sender (\u201cAlice\u201d) can generate a stealth address for the transaction. However, only the recipient, Bob, can control the transaction. Another way to think of a stealth address is as a wallet address that is cryptographically tied to Bob\u2019s public address, but that is only revealed to the parties transacting.\n\nTo conceal their identity, Bob first needs to generate a secret \u201cspending key,\u201d which is then used to create a stealth \"meta-address.\" The meta-address is then shared with the sender (Alice), who performs a computation to generate a stealth address that belongs to Bob.\n\nAlice can then send any assets she wants to Bob. When Alice sends assets to the stealth address, she also publishes some extra cryptographic data on-chain (called an ephemeral pubkey) that helps Bob find the assets. Bob scans the chain for this cryptographic data; if he finds any, he uses his spending key to claim the assets.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOverall, this system offers a method of privacy similar to that of generating a new address for each transaction, but without the hassle of manually create those addresses each time. Along with sharing the meta-address with Alice, Bob can register it on ENS (Ethereum Name Service) as the stealth meta-address for something like bob.eth. In that scenario, and assuming Alice knows Bob owns bob.eth, Alice can then look up his stealth meta-address on ENS.\n\nChallenges and limitations with stealth addresses\n\nWhile the idea is still fairly embryonic, Buterin stated that the technology would be fairly easy to implement. But there are still several issues to solve; most notably, gas fees. As a newly-generated stealth address would contain no ETH, the owner of said address wouldn't be able to send any assets from it (to pay for gas fees) without first transferring ETH from another address. But by doing so, the transaction data would reflect on-chain data, thus defeating the purpose of it being anonymous.\n\nAnother long-term solution that Buterin proposed would be to use Zero-Knowledge Proofs, despite also being somewhat costly due to the extra gas required. Other potential pathways would be to use specialized transaction aggregators\u2014something where users can pay for multiple transactions at once and then spend these prepaid transactions whenever necessary.\n\nIn his closing thoughts, Buterin stated that supporting stealth addresses would also require significant changes to the functionality of Ethereum-based wallets, and suggests that wallet developers should start working towards a multi-address model that is able to properly encrypt and decrypt transaction data along with create a new address for each application or new addresses for privacy-related reasons as well.\n\nAnd while not perfect, stealth addresses are another tool to help increase the overall privacy in the Ethereum network and thus solve one of the bigger remaining challenges for the ecosystem to scale."
