        "title": "Ethereum Price Analysis: Will $ETH Price Surpass $2000 this Week? - CoinGape",
        "content": "Ethereum Price Analysis: By the press time, the Ethereum price traded at the $1905 mark with an intraday day of 0.7%. The daily chart shows the buyers facing a minor hurdle at the local top $1922 formed during the breakout of the wedge pattern. If the coin price successfully flips this barrier into suitable support, the buyers will obtain excellent follow-up for the bullish breakout and will pave the way for further recovery.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum Advocate Predicts \u201cLayer-2 Summer\u201d Next Year; Which Tokens To Rally?\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum Price Daily Chart\n\nThe recent correction in Ethereum price rebounded below the 38.2 Fibonacci retracement level projecting the overall market trend remains bullish.\n\nA potential breakout above $1922 will trigger a quick 5.5% rise in ETH\n\nThe intraday trading volume in Ether is $3.3 Billion, indicating a 28% loss.\n\nSource- Tradingview\n\nThe June 2nd daily green candle is crucial for the Ethereum price signifying several traits for the upcoming rally. The long bullish candle formed at the recently breached angular trendline and horizontal resistance of $1850 indicates that buyers are sustaining prices at high levels and should maintain further growth.\n\nIn addition, the green candle also engulfed the last three days\u2019 price action with sufficient volume indicating the high momentum of buying. Therefore, a breakout above the overhead barrier of $1922 indicates the next significant resistance is directly at $2000 followed by $2138.\n\nIn addition, the low of the June 2nd candle stands as a important support, and therefore breakdown below it will offset the bullish thesis.\n\nWill Ethereum Price Ready to Hit $2000?\n\nThe wedge pattern breakout was a sign of a trend reversal which set the ETH price on a recovery path. In technical analysis, the swing highs formed during the development of the chart pattern are the significant target. Therefore, if the buyer breach $1922 in the coming week, the price will witness a sharp rally to $2000.\n\nBollinger Band: An uptick in the higher band of BB indicator projects the buying is still aggressive.\n\nStochastic: The indicator slopes K%(blue) and D%(orange) have spent most time above the 80% mark in the past few months, indicating the Ethereum coin is an outperformer."

        "content": "A large entity has struck down the price of the Ethereum (ETH)-based indexing protocol The Graph (GRT), according to crypto analytics firm Santiment.\n\nSantiment says that a whale, likely a crypto exchange, disposed of over $55 million worth of GRT, and the price has been down ever since.\n\n\u201cThe Graph has seen a mid-sized price [correction] after a multi-asset whale disposed of $55.3M worth of GRT, as picked up by [Santiment] data. Pay attention to the altcoins moving into self-custody, and avoid those showing big inflows to exchanges.\u201d\n\nAccording to the firm, the whale sold off its GRT stack at $0.130. At time of writing, The Graph is trading for $0.128.\n\nSantiment says Ethereum itself is also struggling to maintain its price structure as ETH holders appear to be quick in taking profits, even after a relatively soft rally in the last week.\n\n\u201cEthereum is getting a large amount of profit-taking transactions after a mild +5% price jump the past week. Typically, we want to see a lot of traders hodling, and if this ratio comes down to Earth, it would be a signal ETH is on its way to $2,000.\u201d\n\nLooking at Bitcoin (BTC), the firm says the top crypto asset by market cap could be set to play \u201ccatch up\u201d with equities and other altcoins in the coming days, especially with the news that the US government has decided to raise the debt ceiling, which has been generally perceived as bullish by analysts.\n\n\u201cThe US House has passed a key debt ceiling deal, launching the S&P500 to its highest price since August. Altcoins like LTC, LEO, and FGC have jumped today. With crypto lagging behind equities, there could be some BTC catch-up time coming soon.\u201d\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.
