        "title": "Where Will Ethereum Be in 5 Years? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "The latest crypto winter is thawing out as we speak. From crypto-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs) driving institutional investor interest to planned technology upgrades to many of the leading crypto platforms, investors have found many new reasons to pay close attention to this space again.\n\nAs a result, smart-contract leader Ethereum (ETH 0.76%) has enjoyed a 46% price jump from the most recent market trough in October 2023. Archrivals Cardano (CRYPTO: ADA) and Algorand (CRYPTO: ALGO) nearly tripled over the same time span -- and up-and-comer Avalanche (CRYPTO: AVAX) more than tripled.\n\nDoes Ethereum have the right moves to counter these high-stakes gambits from its competitors on the grand chessboard of public opinion and developer interest? Let's see how the next three years might play out for the world's second-largest cryptocurrency.\n\nHow Ethereum echoes Bitcoin's market melody\n\nFirst, let me point out that Ethereum tends to follow the price trends of sector giant Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) in the long run -- sometimes amplified and sometimes muted in comparison to its larger cousin, but almost always moving in the same direction. In other words, the two charts are strongly correlated.\n\nSo when Bitcoin gears up for halving the rewards handed out to its miners, as it does roughly once every four years, that event is expected to drive both cryptocurrencies higher over the following year or so. That trend played out in 2016 and 2020 although Ethereum lagged behind Bitcoin's big gains in the former cycle. So the Bitcoin halving, scheduled for late April 2024, should pour fresh fuel on the fires of most cryptocurrencies -- Ethereum included.\n\nThe journey ahead: Ethereum's planned upgrades\n\nThe halving event should provide a rising tide to lift all encrypted boats, but how will Ethereum tackle the soaring competition? Would investors be better off in speed-focused rivals like Avalanche, Cardano, and Algorand in the long run?\n\nWell, let's see. Ethereum is in the middle of a multiyear platform upgrade, formerly known as Ethereum 2.0 or Eth2. The switch to a proof-of-stake system is already in the books, to be followed by several stepwise technical boosts over the next five to 10 years. The precise order of these updates will vary depending on many external factors, but the process should look something like this, according to the official Ethereum development roadmap:\n\nSharding will split the workload of validating transactions into smaller, more manageable batches. This speed-boosting upgrade is running ahead of schedule, as one early step turned out to be more helpful than expected.\n\nInstead of waiting 15 minutes for validation, the same processing batch could address both the creation and validation of the same transaction. This may be the next step, and a significant upgrade to Ethereum's transaction speed.\n\nSeveral security updates are in the works, aiming to protect the blockchain from different attack types. For example, hardening the blockchain against quantum computing attacks is currently seen as a low priority, but could move up the chain if quantum hardware makes a sudden performance leap. Stay tuned.\n\nCurrently, Ethereum executes every smart contract by referring to externally owned accounts (EOAs). This architecture helps developers pull in real-world data from so-called oracle networks such as Chainlink (CRYPTO: LINK) , resulting in sophisticated contracts tied to stock prices, currency exchange trends, weather patterns, the moon phase, and so on. But it also adds complexity to the smart-contract system, slowing it down and exposing the platform to more bugs. Therefore, the Ethereum community is exploring different ways to replace this approach with a simpler and faster alternative.\n\n, resulting in sophisticated contracts tied to stock prices, currency exchange trends, weather patterns, the moon phase, and so on. But it also adds complexity to the smart-contract system, slowing it down and exposing the platform to more bugs. Therefore, the Ethereum community is exploring different ways to replace this approach with a simpler and faster alternative. Finally, mastermind Vitalik Buterin wants Ethereum to be a stateless system in the long run. This next-level spin on sharding would allow each processing node to manage just a small slice of the blockchain's total data, lowering the costs of participation while increasing processing speeds dramatically. However, this is a true long-term goal requiring dramatic changes to Ethereum's technical platform, and you shouldn't expect it anytime soon.\n\nSo Ethereum is taking steps to match the ultra-fast transaction processing speed of Avalanche and Cardano while also building a more robust and flexible platform for blockchain-based app development. Only time will tell how closely the Ethereum project will stick to its stated long-term plans, but there have been more positive surprises than unexpected snags so far.\n\nEthereum looks ready to rumble\n\nIn my view, the ball is in the court of so-called \"Ethereum killers.\" The leading smart-contract platform looks ready to meet their challenges over the next few years.\n\nOf course, the upstarts aren't sitting on their digital hands. Cardano, Algorand, and Avalanche are also boosting their already fast processing speeds while aiming for greater stability. Any one of them might come up with a game-changing innovation someday.\n\nThe challengers are fighting an uphill battle, though. Ethereum got a head start on the rest of the field, setting industry standards and gathering developer interest several years before the other names even existed. The sheer inertia of an established developer group's existing preferences makes it hard for other platforms to steal Ethereum's smart-contract throne.\n\nBut the presence of several healthy rivals should also drive Ethereum to greater heights in the long run. I can't wait to see how this Gulliver-vs.-Lilliput battle will play out over the years. All four of these cryptocurrencies may have bright futures, but Ethereum has the clearest path to sustained success. The giant isn't even on its knees yet."

        "title": "Key Levels to Watch As Ethereum Price Sparks New Recovery at $2200 - CoinGape",
        "content": "The Ethereum (ETH) price has recently experienced an uptick in demand, particularly noticeable around the $2200 level. This change is highlighted by distinct long-tail rejection candles observed on its daily chart, indicating a decrease in bearish momentum. This shift comes in tandem with the Bitcoin price stabilization above $40000, alongside a broader uptick in altcoin markets, sparking a new relief rally.\n\nOver the past three days, the Ethereum price has seen a nearly 4% increase, now trading around the $2280 mark. Given this renewed buying pressure, can Ethereum leverage this momentum to surpass the $2500 threshold once again?\n\nadvertisement\n\nBear Trap Reboots Recovery Sentiment in ETH\n\nThe Ethereum Fear and Greed Index at 48% reflects a neutral sentiment among traders.\n\nThe $2200 support backed by several technical levels creates a stoned support region.\n\nThe intraday trading volume in Ether is $6.3 Billion, indicating a 10.3% gain.\n\nOver the recent fortnight, the Ethereum price experienced a pronounced correction, with its value plunging from $2714 to a low of $2168, marking a significant 20% decrease. During this pullback, the coin price broke below the channel pattern\u2019s support trendline, which underpinned a recovery rally for nearly three months.\n\nHowever, as the broader market\u2019s bearish momentum began to fade, the ETH price demonstrated resilience around the $2200 mark, successfully reclaiming the previously breached support trendline. This reversal marked the prior downfall as a \u2018Bear Trap,\u2019 and triggered additional buying orders in the market, evidenced by considerable short liquidation.\n\nCurrently trading at $2280, if Ethereum can maintain its position above this reclaimed support, it could initiate a 6.85% relief rally, aiming for the $2430 level. This immediate resistance aligns with the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the recent correction, highlighting a pivotal barrier that sellers are likely to defend vigorously.\n\nTherefore, for Ether to continue its upward trajectory and potentially retest the $2700 mark, a breakout above this critical resistance level is essential to gain further momentum.\n\nHas Ethereum Price Entered Downtrend Momentum?\n\nExamining Ethereum\u2019s daily time frame chart, it\u2019s evident that corrections are a regular occurrence. In November 2023, the cryptocurrency underwent a 38.2% correction, followed by a 23.6% retracement in December 2023. Such trends suggest that these retracements, particularly around the 38.2% Fibonacci level, are typical for Ether, often serving as a precursor to subsequent upward movements.\n\nExponential Moving Average (EMA): Amid the recent downturn, the 100-day EMA slope at $2200 showcased its sustainability as valid pullback support.\n\nRelative Strength Index (RSI): The daily RSI slope below 45% reflects the market sentiment currently bearish.\n\nRelated Articles:"

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nIn the wide world of crypto, there are now many blockchains specifically designed for gaming\u2014but Ronin was among the first to launch.\n\nGaming blockchains are typically built to offer low transaction fees and a higher number of potential transactions, so they\u2019re supposed to be more affordable and more scalable than blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Some gaming chains are also private, meaning that developers must gain approval from a blockchain\u2019s creators in order to join its ecosystem.\n\nRonin is one of those examples\u2014at least for now, though founders have said they intend to open it up sometime in 2024 for more studios to build on. In the meantime, games like Pixels and Axie Infinity are drawing players to the Ethereum sidechain. Here's what you need to know about it.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhat is Ronin?\n\nRonin is a gaming-centric Ethereum sidechain designed to handle transactions at a much faster and cheaper rate than Ethereum's own mainnet. The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible chain originally launched back in February 2021.\n\nIt originally launched a \u201cproof of authority\u201d blockchain (PoA), meaning individuals Ronin deems reputable run validator nodes, a type of computer software, to confirm transactions on its blockchain. One common criticism of the PoA method, however, is that a lot of trust must be placed in a smaller number of validators\u2014so it\u2019s less decentralized than other methods.\n\nIn March 2022, the Ronin\u2019s bridge experienced a massive $622 million hack. The bridge connects Ronin to Ethereum. The U.S. Treasury blamed North Korean hackers for the attack\u2014and some of the lost funds were eventually recovered. Affected users were fully refunded by the Ronin network and developer Sky Mavis in June 2022.\n\nIn April 2023, the Ronin blockchain switched to the delegated proof-of-stake mechanism (DPoS), meaning that it no longer operates as a PoA blockchain. DPoS allows for more decentralization, as now any Ronin (RON) token holder with at least 250,000 RON staked on its blockchain can \u201cdelegate\u201d or select validators for the network.\n\nWhat is RON?\n\nThe Ronin token, also known as RON, is the gas token for the Ronin blockchain. Ronin network users need a bit of RON to pay for transactions on the blockchain. RON can also be staked to participate in the blockchain\u2019s aforementioned DPoS mechanism, or can be staked for other decentralized finance (DeFi) purposes.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhat is the Ronin Wallet?\n\nSky Mavis\u2019 Ronin Wallet is a crypto wallet for the Ronin blockchain ecosystem that exists as both a web browser extension and a mobile app for iOS and Android devices.\n\nIn early 2024, the mobile wallet\u2019s developers announced new features in an effort to expand its capabilities, adding support for other blockchains like Ethereum sidechain Polygon and the EVM-compatible BNB Chain. It\u2019s also added Binance Pay as a feature, which allows users to buy some of the Ronin ecosystem's tokens.\n\nWhat is Sky Mavis?\n\nSky Mavis is a crypto tech startup founded in 2018 that created both the Ronin blockchain and its flagship game, Axie Infinity. Sky Mavis has five co-founders: Trung Nguyen, Aleksander Larsen, Jeffrey Zirlin, Viet Anh Ho Sy, and Tu Doan.\n\nAccording to Tracxn data, Sky Mavis has 26 institutional investors, with Animoca Brands and Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) among them. Sky Mavis has raised $311 million in funding at time of writing, per Tracxn, with its latest round a Series B that raised $150 million in April 2022. That round was raised to help refund Ronin users after the aforementioned hack.\n\nHow does Axie Infinity fit into Ronin?\n\nAxie Infinity is a Pok\u00e9mon-inspired play-to-earn game where players can fight each other in battles where they must pit axolotl-inspired creatures called \u201cAxies\u201d against each other. Every Axie is an NFT that can be bought and sold. Thanks to a recent update, some Axies can now be upgraded, too.\n\nWhich tokens are on Ronin?\n\nThe Ronin blockchain\u2019s best-known tokens so far are RON, AXS, and SLP. AXS is Axie Infinity\u2019s governance token. SLP, also known as Smooth Love Potion, is Axie Infinity\u2019s main in-game currency and play-to-earn reward token.\n\nIn early 2024, Sky Mavis announced that SLP would be getting a rework including a capped token supply and a \u201cstability fund\u201d that will automatically buy SLP at specified times in an effort to keep the token\u2019s price within certain target points. SLP can be earned in Axie Infinity by winning matches.\n\nPixels is also set to launch its own PIXEL token soon on Ronin, while other games are likely to debut tokens in the future as they expand and hold airdrop campaigns.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhich games are on Ronin?\n\nWhile Ronin\u2019s most well-known game is Axie Infinity (which consists of Origins, Raylights, and Homeland games), there\u2019s also games like Axie Classic, Project T prototype, and Defenders of Lunacian Land.\n\nBeyond the Axie IP, Sky Mavis has begun to bring external game developers onto the Ronin blockchain, adding Pixels, Zoids Wild Arena, The Machines Arena, Tribesters: Island of Solas, and Civitas, to name a few.\n\nPixels has been credited with helping to renew interest around the Ronin chain after migrating from Polygon in late 2023 and kicking off a play-to-airdrop campaign that concluded in January 2024. The game has driven a dramatic rise in active users on Ronin, arguably benefitting other games on the platform and driving refreshed enthusiasm around its prospects.\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward\n\nEditor's note: This story was updated after publication to note additional Sky Mavis co-founders and to clarify that Ronin users affected by the bridge hack were fully refunded."

        "title": "Should You Buy Ethereum While It's Below $2,500? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "After tanking 68% in 2022, Ethereum (ETH 0.76%) experienced a resurgence last year, as the digital asset soared 91% in 2023. This was on the back of renewed optimism in the crypto industry.\n\nHowever, Ethereum remains 49% off its all-time high. And the current dip might be a rare opportunity.\n\nShould investors buy this leading cryptocurrency while it's still below $2,500? Let's look at both the bull and bear cases for Ethereum, so that investors can make an informed decision.\n\nWhat the bulls are saying\n\nEthereum was the first cryptocurrency that incorporated functionality for smart contracts. And this means that it had greater potential to introduce various use cases.\n\nThis includes decentralized applications, in verticals including gaming, social, governance, and even art. But one area that has huge potential is decentralized finance (DeFi). According to coinmarketcap.com, Ethereum has 71% of the $105 billion of total value locked in the entire cryptocurrency industry. This metric measures how much capital is staked or locked up in DeFi applications, indicating Ethereum's dominance.\n\nIn September 2022, Ethereum's network transitioned to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. Supporters had long waited for this upgrade, called The Merge, to make the cryptocurrency better capable of scaling up. This also reduced its energy usage by 99.95%. Furthermore, the hope is that Ethereum can process more transactions at lower costs. And this should continue to make this blockchain network a hotbed when it comes to developer activity.\n\nAnother reason why Ethereum might be on your investing radar has to do with the potential for spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to hit the market. The Securities and Exchange Commission approved Bitcoin spot ETFs recently, and there's optimism this could happen with Ethereum as well. So far, BlackRock and Ark Invest, among other asset managers, have filed applications. This could bring in massive amounts of institutional capital to Ethereum, which could support a higher price over time.\n\nThe bears have compelling arguments\n\nThe entire premise of cryptocurrencies is to take power away from central authorities and give it to the community. The goal is to create decentralized networks where individuals are in control. The issue with Ethereum, though, is that it's still controlled by a small group of people. Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum, has an outsize influence on the direction of the crypto. Some might view this as a huge risk because he can take actions that are more favorable to himself.\n\nBesides The Merge, Ethereum's leaders have a comprehensive roadmap that includes numerous other upgrades to the network, called the Surge, Verge, Purge, and Splurge. While this is encouraging, because it shows how well thought out Ethereum's development pipeline is, it adds tremendous technical risk. Anytime software is changed, a lot can go wrong, thus opening up Ethereum to software bugs that could make it easier for hackers to attack the network and steal people's private keys.\n\nInvestors also can't ignore regulatory concerns. SEC chair Gary Gensler has come out and said before that he views Bitcoin as a commodity, while all other cryptocurrencies are likely securities. This means Ethereum could face a more stringent regulatory framework going forward, which could discourage capital and talent from migrating to it.\n\nShould you buy Ethereum? It depends.\n\n\n\nBoth the bull and bear cases hold a lot of weight. Investors should consider the facts and come to their own conclusion about what to do with this cryptocurrency as it relates to their portfolio composition. Everyone has a different perspective.\n\nIf you're willing to take the risk, accept the uncertainty, and understand that there will be lots of volatility, then initiating a tiny position in Ethereum while it's still below $2,500 might make sense. Of course, it's critical to maintain a long-term mindset of at least five to 10 years if you go this route."

After ETH/BTC breaks down, ETH/USD breaks down.\n\nOne of the things about ETH/USD that you might notice is that it doesn\u2019t tend to just put in a low and then never test the integrity of that low.

Despite both cryptocurrencies promising to reinvent finance across the globe, ETH and XRP tackle this monumental task from completely different angles.\n\nWhile David Schwartz, Brad Garlinghouse, and the team at Ripple Labs want to facilitate simpler transactions globally, Vitalik Buterin and the wider Ethereum community are reimagining what\u2019s possible on the internet.\n\nIn this article, we\u2019ll pit two of the blockchain industry\u2019s brightest stars against each other to see who comes out on top.\n\nRipple vs. Ethereum: At a Glance\n\nBefore plunging into the nuts and bolts of these protocols, it\u2019s important to understand what Ripple and Ethereum do and why these ecosystems carry so much gravity in the crypto space.\n\nWhat Is Ripple (XRP)?\n\nOriginally designed by Jed McCaleb as the ultimate Bitcoin (BTC) alternative, Ripple is a cross-border payment protocol that aims to streamline international financial transactions.\n\nWith a focus on central banks and other high-powered financial institutions, Ripple Labs envisions a world where lengthy and expensive international payments are executed in seconds, liberating the flow of money worldwide.\n\nThe Ripple Labs team has wasted no time building a powerful network of strategic partnerships. Dozens of banks and financial institutions, including Santander and the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, have joined the RippleNet. With XRP\u2019s legal dramas mostly behind it, Ripple\u2019s expansive partnerships are expected to grow.\n\nStrengths\n\nAffordable \u2013 A transaction on the XRP Ledger costs an average of $0.0002, making the network more affordable than existing cross-border payment platforms.\n\n\u2013 A transaction on the XRP Ledger costs an average of $0.0002, making the network more affordable than existing cross-border payment platforms. Fast \u2013 While current international payment solutions, like SWIFT, can take days to clear, XRPL payments are settled in as little as 3 seconds.\n\n\u2013 While current international payment solutions, like SWIFT, can take days to clear, XRPL payments are settled in as little as 3 seconds. Sustainable \u2013 XRPL transactions are roughly 61,000 times more energy efficient than proof-of-work blockchains like Bitcoin.\n\nWhat Is Ethereum (ETH)?\n\nEthereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization and is responsible for pioneering many of blockchain technology\u2019s greatest innovations.\n\nA fully decentralized, smart contract-capable network, Ethereum reimagined what we knew possible on the internet, giving us remarkable new use cases like decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\n\nToday, Ethereum boasts the greatest diversity of on-chain technologies and applications seen in the space. Vitalik Buterin\u2019s network has given millions of people worldwide greater control over their funds, eliminating the need for costly intermediaries in dozens of industries and sectors.\n\nStrengths\n\nThe Original Layer One \u2013 Ethereum was the first blockchain to support smart contract development, allowing for a virtually endless range of potential use cases.\n\n\u2013 Ethereum was the first blockchain to support smart contract development, allowing for a virtually endless range of potential use cases. Immense TVL and Activity \u2013 Ethereum boasts greater TVL (Total Value Locked) and activity than all other blockchains, implying that it\u2019s the most commonly used and trusted network in crypto.\n\n\u2013 Ethereum boasts greater TVL (Total Value Locked) and activity than all other blockchains, implying that it\u2019s the most commonly used and trusted network in crypto. Central Hub of Crypto Innovation \u2013 Ethereum offers developers greater flexibility and composability than any other chain, making it the first choice for developers and entrepreneurs looking to test revolutionary new ideas.\n\nKey Differences Between Ripple and Ethereum\n\nAs I\u2019m sure you can understand by now, Ripple and Ethereum are fundamentally different on many levels, and each blockchain is better suited to different tasks. What are the main differences to consider when comparing the two blockchains?\n\nUse Cases\n\nRipple, XRP, and the XRP Ledger are primarily used to transfer funds efficiently across borders. That\u2019s not to say there isn\u2019t some semblance of DeFi activity on the network, but the blockchain\u2019s main focus is to provide services to financial institutions globally.\n\nOn the other hand, Ethereum offers a far more diverse range of utilities. While early activity on the network was centered around decentralized finance, Ethereum developers have spread their wings to provide blockchain-based applications in everything from supply chain management and healthcare to legal services and gaming.\n\nScalability\n\nThe XRP Ledger was designed to eclipse Bitcoin\u2019s limitations and provide an unrivaled payment system. With blazing-fast transaction speeds, high transaction throughput, and low fees, the XPRL can support vast amounts of users without breaking a sweat or breaking the bank.\n\nIn this respect, Ethereum falls short. The network has long suffered from astronomical gas fees, with a simple trade, digital currency transfer, or NFT mint costing upwards of $50. Ethereum is also much slower than Ripple, managing only around 15 transactions per second\n\nHowever, all is not lost for Ethereum. The network supports dozens of layer 2 scaling solutions that help shoulder some of the burden, providing Ethereum\u2019s unmatched developer experience on far more scalable platforms.\n\nOn top of that, Vitalik Buterin and the Ethereum community are constantly working to improve the network. Plans are underway to alleviate Ethereum\u2019s issues and help it compete with more modern and performant Layer Ones.\n\nVision\n\nAs mentioned earlier, Ripple\u2019s primary focus is on delivering solutions for some of the world\u2019s largest financial institutions. While most cryptocurrency industry aims to give power and control back to the individual, Ripple is more interested in sticking with the big players.\n\nBeyond that, Ripple faces some centralization issues. While claiming to be fully decentralized, the XRP Ledger is largely operated by Ripple Labs, a private company.\n\nAs if that wasn\u2019t enough, Ripple Labs holds over 50B XRP tokens in its escrow vaults.\n\nI'm still not sure the escrow was such a good idea. I initially oposed it. Later weakly supported it. And today, I'm right on the fence. \u2014 David \"JoelKatz\" Schwartz (@JoelKatz) January 8, 2024\n\nThis staggering figure makes up more than half of XRP\u2019s total supply, a concept that even Ripple CTO David Schwartz has difficulty supporting.\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum\u2019s development and future are firmly held in the hands of its community. On-chain votes manage the protocol\u2019s governance, and anyone can submit new proposals that might dictate the blockchain\u2019s path forward.\n\nLike Bitcoin itself, Ethereum champions the original ethos of blockchain technology. The network aims to give everyone on earth greater control of their assets and provide a secure, anonymous, and permissionless platform for all.\n\nLooking to the Future\n\nHaving shaken the legal monkey off its back, Ripple can finally look ahead unburdened. At the same time, Ethereum\u2019s network effect is growing larger daily, supported by a comprehensive roadmap expected to resolve its issues. What does the future hold for these iconic cryptocurrencies?\n\nWhat\u2019s Next for Ripple?\n\nWhile Ripple Labs\u2019 legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchanges Commission is far from over, Judge Analisa Torres\u2019 declaration that XRP is not a security has been a great boon for the XRP community.\n\nWith that out of the way, Ripple Labs can focus more on expanding the RippleNet work towards more partnerships with large financial institutions.\n\nRumors have been circulating about a potential Ripple IPO. However, Ripple Labs CEO Brad Garlinghouse has denied these claims, suggesting that Ripple is \u2018not in any hurry\u2019 to go public.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next for Ethereum?\n\nFollowing a successful transition to becoming a more energy-efficient, Proof-of-Stake blockchain in 2022, the next steps of Ethereum\u2019s roadmap are dedicated to scaling the network.\n\nCo-founder Vitalik Buterin has updated the Ethereum roadmap, painting a picture of what to expect in 2024 (ignoring the typo in his post). The plan ahead follows the 6-step path to newfound scalability, separated into comically named sections.\n\nBy popular demand, an updated roadmap diagram for 2023! pic.twitter.com/oxo58A2KuG \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) December 30, 2023\n\nWhile it is unlikely that all this will be achieved in 2024 alone, the Ethereum community is largely happy with the proposal, which aims to bring Ethereum to greater heights.\n\nFinal Verdict\n\nComparisons between crypto projects are not always a great measure of their value. The reality is that it\u2019s hard to compare the perks and potential of two fundamentally different protocols with contrasting values and use cases.\n\nOn paper, Ripple is a far more efficient and scalable payment processor. However, Ethereum\u2019s adaptability and scope are far wider, allowing for a more diverse range of utilities and adoption channels.\n\nUltimately, the question shouldn\u2019t be as simple as \u2018Which is better?\u2019. The question is which blockchain is better suited to your individual needs.\n\nRipple is undoubtedly the better option if you want to transfer funds quickly at a low cost. For everything else, Ethereum offers a much more diverse range of tools and services that Ripple and the XRP Ledger cannot match.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nModern blockchains offer the best of both worlds. Newer, more performant blockchains like Solana can have faster transaction speeds and lower gas fees than the XRP Ledger while maintaining Ethereum-equivalent levels of smart contract composability.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nRipple and Ethereum are two of the most important digital assets in the crypto market. It\u2019s essential to understand what both networks are capable of before making any investment decisions.\n\nFAQs"

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nIn a month marked by the historic approval and listing of 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs, anticipation within the Ethereum community has risen regarding the potential approval of a spot ETH ETF. However, Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler has provided little clarity on the prospects of such an approval.\n\nDecrypting the SEC Chair\u2019s Vague Ethereum ETF Remarks\n\nDuring an interview with CNBC, Gensler refrained from offering substantial encouragement when questioned about the likelihood of a spot Ethereum ETF gaining SEC approval in the near future.\n\nWhile discussing the recent developments, Gensler emphasized the SEC\u2019s approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, drawing a comparison to previously approved commodity-based exchange-traded products.\n\nGensler declined to provide further insights into the status of an Ethereum ETF specifically. Notably, his choice of words, highlighting Bitcoin as a non-security commodity, suggests a potential distinction between Bitcoin\u2019s status and the prospective status of other cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Regulatory Quandary Still a Puzzle\n\nFor years, Gensler has consistently expressed his view that Bitcoin is the only cryptocurrency definitively categorized as a commodity, placing it outside the SEC\u2019s regulatory purview.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile the SEC has not officially declared Ethereum\u2019s security status, previous legal filings indicate the agency\u2019s consideration of Ethereum transactions falling under its jurisdiction.\n\nThe potential classification of Ethereum as a security could present regulatory challenges for a spot Ethereum ETF, potentially exceeding the scrutiny faced by a Bitcoin ETF.\n\nGensler\u2019s statements come amid changing circumstances and legal judgments, such as the court order in October compelling the SEC to review Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin ETF application.\n\nThe court\u2019s decision, which forced the SEC to approve a Bitcoin futures ETF application, also approved an Ethereum futures ETF in the same month, possibly setting the stage for a parallel legal scenario.\n\nThe unfolding developments surrounding Bitcoin spot ETFs and Gensler\u2019s cautious remarks continue to leave investors in suspense regarding the fate of Ethereum ETF aspirations."

If you encounter any issues, kindly report them to [email protected]. Crypto assets/products can be highly risky. Never invest unless you\u2019re prepared to lose all the money you invest.\n\nA new crypto cartoon was just released on YouTube. The 2 minute and 54 second, animated short film explains the importance of a new Bitcoin rival on the Ethereum-Blockchain; A cryptocurrency called Mollars token. It\u2019s an innovative look into the digital asset and the way investors can earn money, in the form of ROI yields, by investing in its initial coin offering today.\n\nThe animated video has received 600 views since its launch on the official Mollars YouTube channel Saturday night. The view count is likely to go much higher as the week progresses and the viral-worthy content is spread about.\n\nWhat does the cartoon short film say about Mollars?\n\n\n\nThe cartoon summarizes many of the biggest key points of the Mollars Project.\n\nThe cryptocurrency is a store-of-value token like Bitcoin It\u2019s\u2019 on the Ethereum blockchain Mollars will offer traders the perks of Bitcoin but with lower transaction fees Buying during the ICO stage, before the token is listed on a public crypto exchange, can generate positive ROI yields for early investors How ICO funds are used aka \u2018tokenomics\u2019\n\n\n\nAfter these key points, the Mollars animation delves deep into how crypto traders make money from token presales. The film breaks down how one token that costs $0.45 cents today will be worth $0.62 cents, as soon as it goes live on a public cryptocurrency exchange.\n\nBeyond initial ROI gains ,the crypto animation also explains how long-term profits are much better on tokens. When the demand is high and a token is offering a solution, as Mollars is, the animation urges users to HODL and wait for much bigger gains that usually parallels how well a brand\u2019s value is built.\n\nHow Token Supply Will Be Sold\n\nThe Total Token Supply [TTS] distribution is also broken down in the cartoon. According to the artsy visual, Mollars TTS will be 10-million tokens. Only 4-million will be sold at discounted prices in the current initial coin offering. Once the ICO is closed, the other 6-million will be sold on a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange [DEX] like Uniswap.\n\nLast, beginning at the 2 minutes and 34 seconds mark, the animated characters elaborate on how investors can acquire the new Bitcoin-alternative. Users can visit the official website, Mollars.cc, and make a purchase by using Ethereum (ETH), Tether (USDT) or a credit card charge.\n\nThe \u201cMollars Cartoon\u201d is a great tool for educating novice investors. It could also attract more money from crypto whales and sharks, who dominate the list of the top 5 single transaction buyers from the $MOLLARS token presale.\n\nBeyond the visual itself, this video continues to show the great leadership and innovative ideas flowing from the creator of this store-of-value token. The launch of this short film was without notice and if there are other surprises to come from Mollars of similar quality, it could further catalyze growth for the initial coin offering, branding value, and demand."

        "content": "Bitcoin and Ethereum Price Prediction as BTC Rallies 10% From Recent Bottom and ETH Sees $5 Billion Flood In \u2013 Time to Buy?\n\nIn the dynamic world of cryptocurrency, Bitcoin\u2019s price prediction seems bullish, especially as it experiences a noteworthy upswing, currently trading at $42,220, marking a nearly 1% increase on Sunday.\n\nThis positive trend in Bitcoin\u2019s valuation coincides with a high-ranking representative\u2019s praise of BlackRock\u2019s Bitcoin ETF, hailing it as a \u201chuge success\u201d across various metrics.\n\nSimultaneously, the US dollar is witnessing a decline in the wake of recent inflation figures, setting a critical stage for the upcoming Federal Reserve meeting next week. These developments collectively paint a complex but intriguing picture for Bitcoin\u2019s future in the financial landscape.\n\nBlackRock\u2019s Bitcoin ETF Declared \u2018Huge Success\u2019 by Top Official\n\n\n\nSince its recent inception, BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has seen strong growth, and in an interview with Yahoo Finance, U.S. Head Rachel Aguirre expressed pleasure with the outcome. After receiving permission from the SEC, IBIT\u2019s trading volume increased to an astounding $3 billion in just two weeks, drawing in $1.6 billion in capital.\n\nAguirre highlighted BlackRock\u2019s dedication to giving investor\u2019s access to Bitcoin, praising the product for its three USPs: better accessibility, the removal of hassles related to direct Bitcoin ownership, and offering high-caliber support.\n\nBREAKING: The BlackRock iShares #Bitcoin Trust is a huge success by multiple metrics, according to Rachel Aguirre, U.S. Head of iShares Products. pic.twitter.com/ZOVZEgR3dC \u2014 sunnydecree (@sunnydecree) January 24, 2024\n\nAlthough Aguirre refuted rumors of a spot Ethereum ETF, she praised BlackRock for being ahead of the curve in gauging investor demand. BlackRock currently has 16,361 BTC in order to fund IBIT.\n\nThe favorable reaction highlights the increasing interest of institutions in cryptocurrencies, which is probably pushing up the price of Bitcoin.\n\nUS Dollar Weakens Post-Inflation Data, Ahead of Fed Meeting\n\n\n\nFriday saw a little decline in the value of the US dollar as December inflation statistics confirmed the market\u2019s expectations of a mid-year interest rate drop by the Federal Reserve. Though it might have gained for a fourth week in a row, the dollar index fell 0.1% to 103.41.\n\nIn line with expectations, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index increased by 0.2%, preventing annual inflation from rising above 3%. Analysts say there is no reason for the market to be concerned about inflation anytime soon, which lessens the chance of more tightening.\n\nUS dollar slips after inflation data, Fed meeting looms next week \u2013 The Economic Times https://t.co/o391aoNCWW \u2014 FOMC Alerts (@FOMCAlerts) January 28, 2024\n\nThe dollar\u2019s rise is being restrained by mounting disinflationary pressures globally, even though U.S. rate futures priced in a 47% chance of a rate decrease in March.\n\nThe situation with Bitcoin (BTC) is becoming better, and if investors continue to be concerned about inflation, they may become more interested in inflation-resistant assets like cryptocurrencies.\n\nBitcoin Price Prediction\n\nOn January 28, Bitcoin (BTC/USD) exhibits a steady uptrend, currently trading at $42,401, marking a 0.66% increase. The four-hour chart highlights pivotal price levels that are key to Bitcoin\u2019s immediate trajectory. The pivot point is placed at $42,161, with the asset facing immediate resistance at $43,394, followed by higher resistance levels at $44,372 and $45,581. Conversely, support levels are established at $40,957, $39,644, and $38,618. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 70, indicating a strong buying interest that borders on overbought conditions. The 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) stands at $40,820, offering a significant support level. A notable chart pattern is Bitcoin\u2019s breakthrough above a double top around the $42,160 level. Closing above this could signal a robust buying trend, with potential for further upward movement. The overall trend for Bitcoin is bullish above the $42,160 mark. Ethereum Price Prediction On January 28, Ethereum exhibits a promising uptrend, trading at $2,289.7, a gain of 0.97%. The four-hour chart analysis highlights critical levels influencing Ethereum\u2019s short-term market dynamics. Its pivot point rests at $2,321, with immediate resistance observed at $2,388. Subsequent resistance levels are marked at $2,476 and $2,560. On the downside, Ethereum finds immediate support at $2,241, with further levels at $2,169 and $2,102. Read More: Ethereum Price The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 54, indicating a neutral market momentum. The 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) is at $2,314, closely aligning with the current price trajectory. Chart analysis reveals that Ethereum has completed a 38.2% Fibonacci retracement at $2,313. However, a downward trendline near the $2,300 mark may pose a hurdle for further upward movement. Overall, Ethereum presents a bullish trend above the $2,320 threshold. In the short term, it is expected to test the resistance levels, especially at $2,388, providing traders and investors with key indicators to watch in the coming days."

        "content": "Ethereum Classic (ETC) was born from a tragic event that happened at Ethereum (ETH). There was a hack on the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain that led to a theft of 3.6 million Ethereum (ETH). Ethereum Classic (ETC) was set up to maintain Ethereum (ETH) reputation as an upstanding crypto project. Ethereum Classic (ETC) is a smart contract project that can host and support the creation of decentralized apps. Ethereum Classic (ETC) is trying to distinguish itself from its parent coin with its road maps moving further away from \u200bEthereum (ETH).\n\nCelestia (TIA) is a Web3 project that is redefining the way we look at blockchain architecture. Celestia (TIA) is a modular blockchain network, Celestia (TIA) is the first to allow anyone to launch their own blockchain with minimal resistance. Celestia (TIA) does not mandate any execution or settlement laws so developers now have more space to innovate than ever before.\n\nExperts have recommended that investors invest in Pushd (PUSHD) because it has great profit projections. Holders of Ethereum Classic (ETC) and Celestia (TIA) are very interested in this new project.\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC) has seen better days\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC) might have many of the same functions that Ethereum (ETH) has but it seems it does not have the same financial success. Ethereum Classic (ETC) is losing investors and with these figures, who can blame them for leaving? Ethereum Classic (ETC) currently costs 23.27% but this equates to a 2.42% drop in value in the last 7 days. Even looking at a longer time frame, we see that Ethereum Classic (ETC) has had a bad year, with its value being in the red for most of the year. The coin has come up a little, but it is already descending.\n\nCelestia (TIA) loses more Investors in 2024\n\nCelestia (TIA) is a good project, but will Celestia (TIA) be a top project in 2024? According to experts, this is not likely. The worth of a Celestia (TIA) token is worrisome, in the last 7 days its value has dropped to $16.66 and this translates to a 2.4% drop in value. In addition to this, Celestia\u2019s (TIA) trading volume is affected, it has pumped by 50% in just 24 hours. Celestia (TIA) holders are now investing in Pushd (PUSHD), they see it as a more profitable investment in 2024.\n\nPushd (PUSHD) has the backing of top analysts\n\nPushd (PUSHD) is new to the crypto space but it is already making rounds in the scene. Top analysts have examined the project and have predicted that it will be a top project in 2024 and will be a blue chip company in no time. But what is this project all about? Pushd (PUSHD) is going to be the first decentralized online marketplace. Users will be able to buy and sell items with crypto. Pushd (PUSHD) will have a monopoly of this marketspace and so it is going to be very profitable. Pushd (PUSHD) is now in its fourth presale stage and is selling for $0.075 with almost 6,000 investors and over 23,000 sign ups.\n\nFind out more about the Pushd presale at their official website.\n\nDisclosure: This is a sponsored press release.

        "content": "Sun 28 Jan 2024 \u25aa 3 min of reading \u25aa by Fenelon L.\n\nEthereum network developers have just announced the deployment schedule for Dencun, the much-anticipated update that is expected to enhance performance and further reduce transaction fees.\n\nEthereum developers are creating buzz with a major announcement about the key milestones of Dencun. According to Tim Beiko, the update will first activate its features on the Sepolia and Holesky testnets, on January 30th and February 7th, respectively.\n\nThese highly anticipated activations on testnets pave the way for a successful deployment of Dencun on the mainnet, after a series of conclusive tests. It\u2019s worth noting that preliminary trials have already taken place on January 17th on Goerli.\n\nThe integration of Dencun into Sepolia and Holesky is critical before its official launch. It aims to validate its robustness and ensure a smooth transition to this new version of Ethereum.\n\nTim Beiko emphasizes: if the tests meet expectations, the launch date of Dencun will be announced on the mainnet. Furthermore, he urges operators to update their nodes for flawless deployment on D-Day.\n\nConcrete changes that crush fees\n\nDencun continues the revolutionary work started by Shapella in 2023, this time by integrating the much anticipated \u201cEIP-4844\u201d update, better known as \u201cProtodanksharding\u201d.\n\nThis fundamental advancement is expected to drastically reduce transaction fees for Ethereum-based layer 2 solutions. We\u2019re talking about a dramatic 90% drop for protocols like Optimism or Arbitrum!\n\nThe implications of Dencun are therefore huge in terms of accessibility and increased use of the Ethereum blockchain, thanks to this radical cost reduction. Its implementation will also undoubtedly stimulate the emergence of new layer 2 innovations.\n\nIn summary, this announcement generates immense interest from both investors and developers. The upcoming activation of Dencun will mark a decisive milestone for Ethereum, thus strengthening its dominant position in the blockchain market. Its rollout is already the talk of the crypto ecosystem!\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program!

        "content": "The NUPL value has not dropped much despite the recent volatility.\n\nThe short-term market sentiment was in favor of the sellers.\n\nEthereum [ETH] prices fell to the $2.2k support level once again after the recent slash in prices. The Bitcoin [BTC] selling pressure meant altcoins suffered too.\n\nYet, AMBCrypto noted that the NUPL metric showed optimism over the past two months.\n\nThe Net Unrealized Profit/Loss is defined as the difference between Relative Unrealized Profit and Relative Unrealized Loss. It has slowly climbed higher since October 2023.\n\nUnderstanding the sentiment behind Ethereum\n\nThe NUPL reached 0.385 on the 11th of January. The last time that the NUPL of ETH was higher was back in May 2022, according to data from Glassnode.\n\nThe Unrealized Profit or Unrealized Loss is calculated by weighting each circulating ETH by the difference between its current price and realized price.\n\nRealized price refers to the price of the ETH when it was last moved.\n\nTheir difference has been useful in gauging the market cycle of Bitcoin and Ethereum in the past. Right now, the 0.385 value is a sign that the sentiment was optimistic in the macrocycle.\n\nA look at the short-term sentiment showed the opposite. The Weighted Sentiment data from Santiment stood near zero to show social media engagement didn\u2019t favor the bears or the bulls.\n\nThe Open Interest slid sharply on the 22nd and the 23rd of January, alongside the price of Ethereum. The OI had not yet recovered at press time.\n\nThe inference was that Futures participants preferred to remain sidelined as ETH traded near its $2.2k support zone.\n\nThe ETF approval caught many participants offside\n\nAfter the 11th of January, ETH has trended downward on the lower timeframe price charts (such as the 1-hour chart). Yet, from the 12th to the 22nd of January, the estimated leverage ratio climbed higher.\n\nHowever, it fell rapidly from 22nd to 24th January as prices nosedived.\n\nThis suggested that, while a good portion of speculators chose to remain sidelined (OI was falling slowly at that time) a large number also sought to increase leverage in the hopes of catching a breakout upward.\n\nAMBCrypto analyzed the estimated liquidation levels of ETH and found that the $2.3k mark was important yet again.\n\nThe Cumulative Liq Levels Delta was negative, meaning that short liquidations outweighed the long ones.\n\nHence, there is a better chance of a bounce in prices to liquidate these short sellers, than a bearish continuation over the next few days.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024-25\n\nTo the north, the $2310 level had close to $100 million in estimated liquidations. Many smaller liquidation levels were clustered around the $2.3k mark.\n\nTherefore, a bounce to the $2310-$2350 area has a good likelihood. Whether Ethereum will face a rejection from there or a bullish recovery remains to be seen."

Bitcoin (BTC) owners increased by 33%, rising from 222 million in January to 296 million by December, representing 51% of global cryptocurrency owners. Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) saw an even more significant rise of 39%, growing from 89 million owners at the start of the year to 124 million by the end, accounting for 21% of the global total.\n\nThe report attributes Bitcoin\u2019s adoption growth primarily to Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the introduction of the Bitcoin Ordinals protocol. This protocol has enabled the minting of both non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and fungible tokens directly on the Bitcoin network, marking a significant advancement in the cryptocurrency\u2019s capabilities and appeal.\n\nIt says :\n\n\u201cStrong interest from institutional investors also contributed to the increase in BTC\u2019s adoption.\u201d\n\nEthereum Adoption Boosted by Liquid Staking Post-Shanghai Upgrade\n\nThe report highlights Ethereum\u2019s significant adoption growth , attributing it largely to the advancements in liquid staking following the Shanghai Upgrade. This upgrade enabled the withdrawals of staked ETH, marking Ethereum\u2019s transition to a Proof of Stake (PoS) blockchain. This development has been a key factor in driving Ethereum\u2019s increased adoption.\n\nThe prices of BTC and ETH saw a substantial rise, with BTC momentarily hitting the $44,000 mark and ETH reaching around $2,400. Concurrently, there was a significant surge in popularity for BRC-20 tokens and inscriptions, drawing in a wide variety of investors and crypto enthusiasts.\n\n\ud83d\udea8SOLD OUT!!\ud83d\udea8 Natively Digital: An Ordinal Curated sale smashed the pre sale estimates ! \u2013 Total: $1,097,000 (26 BTC)\n\n(Double the pre sale low estimate)\n\n\u2013 100% of lots sold\n\n\u2013 641 bids\n\n\u2013 95 bidders and buyers\n\n\u2013 Half of the sale sold for over their high estimates Congrats to\u2026 pic.twitter.com/jEMgMUtajl \u2014 Michael Bouhanna (@michaelbouhanna) January 22, 2024\n\nAdditionally, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) gave the green light to 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs on January 10, including a noteworthy conversion of Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin trust (GBTC) into an ETF.

        "content": "Over the past week, Bitcoin (BTC) price action has been sluggish. However, it has now moved above the $40K mark, indicating a potential recovery path. Ethereum (ETH) also clocked significant losses over the week but has now managed to neutralize its position.\n\nOn Saturday, Bitcoin\u2019s price stood at a level close to $42,200, marking a daily increase of 1% as per CoinGlass data. The trading volume in crypto derivatives dropped significantly, down 55% to $21.50 billion. Despite this, Bitcoin\u2019s total market value stayed at $828.78 billion, with open interest (OI) for Bitcoin reported at $17.98 billion. 24-hour liquidations surpassed $13.37 million, indicating sell pressure.\n\nadvertisement\n\nIn comparison, Ethereum was priced close to $2,280, with a modest daily increase. The amount traded fell by nearly 50% to $8.44 billion, while its total market value was $275.03 billion. Ethereum\u2019s OI stood at $7.79 billion, with liquidations totaling $4.35 million.\n\nBTC vs ETH: Key metrics analysis\n\nIntoTheBlock\u2019s metrics reveal insightful details about the two cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin\u2019s large transaction volume decreased by 39.08% to $25.93 billion, indicating a decrease in high-value transactions. Daily active addresses increased by 7.76% to 979,300, reflecting a rise in user activity. The holder\u2019s balance slightly rose to $581.26 billion. Notably, exchange netflows saw a significant drop of 129.87% and touched negative $71.71 million. The whale participation rate stood at 2.31%. Currently, 82.45% of Bitcoin holders are \u2018in the money,\u2019 showing a positive investment return.\n\nFor Ethereum, the large transaction volume also decreased by 49.58% to $2.14 billion. Daily active addresses were at 595,640, up by 9.94%. Ethereum\u2019s holder\u2019s balance increased to $218.04 billion. Exchange netflows showed a dramatic decrease of 405.1% and touched negative $96.24 million. Ethereum whale participation rate was significantly higher at 36.89%, with 71.70% of holders \u2018in the money.\u2019\n\nBoth Bitcoin and Ethereum are experiencing a decline in large transaction volumes, which implies a relatively reduced trading interest from investors. The negative exchange netflows for both suggest that users are moving their holdings out of exchanges.\n\nIntoTheBlock also noted that Bitcoin and Ethereum saw over a 30% decrease in transaction fees, attributed to reduced market volatility and less urgent need for transactions among users.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum fees declined over 30% as market volatility decreased, leading to relatively less urgency amongst users transacting pic.twitter.com/Bk3Wd1SblY \u2014 IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) January 26, 2024\n\nWhat are analysts betting on?\n\nCrypto analyst Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe recently said in a post on X, \u201cI personally believe that #Ethereum is going to outperform #Bitcoin in the upcoming period and it has started since the ETF approval.\u201d\n\nHe pointed out a \u2018massive weekly bullish divergence\u2019 and crucial resistance at 0.06 BTC.

        "content": "Trading application Unibot will issue a native Solana ecosystem token that accrues value back to holders of the original Ethereum-based UNIBOT tokens, a move that initially met with criticism and caused volatile price action last week.\n\nUnibot expanded to the Solana ecosystem in late December but said last week it would introduce a UNISOL token that accrued revenue in the form of Solana\u2019s SOL tokens. The decision created concerns among long-time UNIBOT holders, who feared dilution as traders would be inclined to choose the newer token in favor of the older one. A sell-off ensued.\n\nBut developers said early Monday that UNISOL could ultimately boost UNIBOT\u2019s value accrual, helping ease some losses from the past few days as traders priced in new information. The Unibot platform connects user wallets to the decentralized exchange Uniswap and lets them punt on tokens just as easily as they would send messages to each other on the popular messaging app by using the messaging application Telegram or a terminal.\n\nUNIBOT slid from over $100 to as low as $48.

You'll link your Ethereum address, which holds $UNIBOT to a Solana address that receives revenue in the form of SOL. Pool #2: holders of $UNISOL on Solana.\u201d\n\nUNIBOT holders are set to receive some 80% of the supply of UNISOL through a snapshot and claim mechanism. Since its early January launch, over 20,000 users have generated more than $130m in total volume, developers claimed Monday.\n\n//ANNOUNCEMENT\n\n\n\nWe'd like to clear the confusion around the path forward.\n\n\n\nThe revenue sharing for protocol revenue generated by @UnibotOnSolana is split 50/50 between two pools, described as follows.\n\nPool #1: simply being a holder of $UNIBOT on Ethereum, no strings attached.\u2026 pic.twitter.com/vqEVVhG1FI \u2014 Unibot (@TeamUnibot) January 28, 2024\n\nOn-chain data shows Unibot has garnered 11,700 ether (ETH) in fees since the platform went live in May, paying out a portion of this straight to token holders. Users have also steadily increased, reaching 41,000 on Monday compared to just over 2,000 at the end of last June.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn Sunday alone, the platform generated $74,000 in fees across Solana and Ethereum on $7.5 million in combined volumes.\n\n(Dune)\n\nPer Dune Analytics, Unibot's average daily volumes are just above $5.5 million, a long way from the $900 million daily on the market-leading DEX Uniswap.\n\nUNIBOT prices are up 21% in the past 24 hours, DEXTools data shows."

Dogecoin\u2019s value spiked, Donald Trump made significant moves in the Ethereum and MAGA Coin markets, a Colorado pastor admitted to fraud charges, and Shiba Inu\u2019s burn rate skyrocketed. Here\u2019s a quick look at what transpired.\n\nDogecoin Value Surges on Musk\u2019s X App Buzz\n\nOver the weekend, Dogecoin DOGE/USD value soared by more than 10% following the establishment of a dedicated account for the planned payment feature on Elon Musk\u2019s \u201ceverything app\u201d X. Pseudonymous cryptocurrency analyst Johnny predicts a rally, with DOGE potentially hitting $0.10. The buzz around the X Payments account has fueled speculation that X/Twitter may soon adopt DOGE as its universal payment method. Read the full article here.\n\nTrump Dumps Ethereum\n\nFormer President Donald Trump is reported to have sold more than 1,000 Ethereum ETH/USD, raking in over $2.4 million. The Ethereum mainly came from royalties for Trump\u2019s non-fungible token (NFT) projects. Despite the sale, the NFTs remain in high demand, with the cheapest one listed for over $600, a significant increase from the original $99 price.

        "content": "The crypto community is currently in a frenzy over Pullix (PLX). It has sold over 80M tokens and raised nearly $5M during its ongoing presale. Some analysts have even pegged this Stage 6 presale star as the next 100x altcoin in 2024. But can this newcomer outshine established players like Solana (SOL) and Ethereum (ETH)? Today, we will find out.\n\nPullix (PLX): One of the Best Cryptos To Buy\n\nWith its ongoing presale, Pullix (PLX) has been making waves in the DeFi market. It recently announced that over 13,000 individuals have signed up for it, and 4000 people are part of its community. Global investors have faith and confidence in Pullix\u2019s long-term growth potential.\n\nPullix aims to change how people trade online by combining the best parts of CEX and DEX. This makes it different from other platforms. With a platform like Binance, you can only trade cryptocurrencies. On Pullix, you can trade all asset classes (Forex, gold, cryptos, etc.) on one account.\n\nBehind the trading services is the PLX native token. Holding this token reduces trading fees and access to specific assets. The remarkable thing about this altcoin is its \u201cTrade-to-Earn\u201d revenue-sharing model. To clarify, just staking PLX will earn users a portion of the daily revenue made by Pullix.\n\nEach PLX token is now valued at $0.10, a 100% ROI if you bought it early. Its long-term growth is excellent thanks to its ties to the OTC derivatives market, which BIS valued at $20.7T in 2022. Market analysts predict that once PLX hits major exchanges in Q1 2024, its value will spike by 100x.\n\nSolana (SOL) Introduces Token Extensions\n\nMeanwhile, Solana (SOL) has introduced token extensions. This is a groundbreaking implementation of complicated pre-built token functionality on the blockchain. Developers can now build their tokens with the extension matching unique needs.\n\nThis exciting Solana news raised interest in this altcoin. On the price charts, SOL has fluctuated between $98.23 and $87.10 in the past week alone. During that time, its market cap has also moved between $42.52B and $37.27B. With the bullish Solana crypto sentiment, market analysts forecast a potential pump to $101.37 before February 2024 ends.\n\nMicha\u00ebl Van De Poppe With a Bullish Ethereum Price Prediction\n\nCrypto analyst Micha\u00ebl Van De Poppe recently predicted a bullish Ethereum (ETH) price. According to his new tweet, Ethereum\u2019s momentum may come in the next few weeks. This rally may be due to the Ethereum ETF hype and Bitcoin\u2019s bottoming out.\n\nThe Ethereum price has fluctuated widely this past week. On both ends, it moved from $2,504 to $2,204. The same goes for market cap, which jumped to $301B just to dip to $264B later. Market analysts foresee the Ethereum crypto soaring to $2,358 within Q1 of 2024.\n\nWill Pullix Outpace Solana and Ethereum?\n\nAt just $20M, Pullix\u2019s early-stage market cap is much smaller than Solana and Ethereum\u2019s. With such a head start, Pullix could surge ahead of them and reach unimaginable heights without needing as much cash. A low market cap plus groundbreaking features make Pullix one of the top altcoins to watch.\n\nFor more information regarding Pullix\u2019s presale see links below:\n\nVisit Pullix\n\nJoin The Pullix Communities\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

The revision is expected to open the doors for the promotion of Bitcoin and exchange-traded funds.\n\nGoogle will revise its advertising policy to accommodate ads from \u201cadvertisers offering Cryptocurrency Coin Trust targeting the United States.\u201d\n\nAccording to data presented by Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart on Jan. 26, the assets under management of BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) have surpassed the $2 billion milestone.\n\nOn Thursday, investors infused approximately $170 million into IBIT, leading to the acquisition of nearly 4,300 Bitcoin. Consequently, the total tokens held by the fund surged to 49,952, coinciding with the surge in the price of bitcoin, which escalated beyond the $40,000 mark early Friday.\n\nThis growth elevated the assets under management (AUM) to over $2 billion. Notably, with AUM surpassing $2 billion, IBIT now ranks as the third highest in asset accumulation among the 600 ETFs launched in the past year.\n\nThe next fund anticipated to exceed the $2 billion threshold is Fidelity\u2019s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC), which as of Jan.25, held just under 44,000 bitcoin.\n\nTop Gainer (24 Hour)\n\nCryptocurrency Gains +/- Price (Recorded 9:30 p.m. EDT) Conflux CRYPTO: CFX) +9.27% $0.24 Injective INJ/USD +5.16% $37.29 Flare FLR/USD +4.49% $0.022\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market cap now stands at $1.56 trillion, showing a 0.48% increase in the past 24 hours.\n\nU.S. stock futures experienced a broad decline Sunday night as Wall Street prepared for the release of several mega-cap tech earnings reports and the Federal Reserve's rate policy decision.

Similarly, S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures saw decreases of 0.2% and 0.3%, respectively.\n\nIn the previous trading week, all three major averages recorded gains following positive economic data. The fourth-quarter economic growth surpassed expectations, while the core inflation rate on a yearly basis was lower than anticipated, indicating a potential slowdown in price increases. However, the market's gains were more subdued compared to the previous week\u2019s surge, attributed to disappointing earnings reports from notable companies such as Intel and Tesla.\n\nLoading...

The real impact on the ETF is going to come in the next few years, resulting into a price of Bitcoin going to $300,000-500,000.\"\n\nCrypto analyst Benjamin Cowen predicts a significant correction for Ethereum, anticipating a sharp decline to below the $1,000 mark.\n\n\"What I'm suggesting is that sometime in the next few months, ETH/BTC breaks down. After ETH/BTC breaks down, ETH/USD breaks down. One of the things about ETH/USD that you might notice is that it doesn't tend to just put in a low and then never test the integrity of that low. Look at all the prior examples\u2026 So at some point, I think Ethereum will test the integrity of that low, back down below $1,000. But, history would also suggest that it won't test it until after ETH/BTC breaks down. And history also suggests that ETH/BTC probably won't break down in January because normally January is a good month for Ethereum.\"\n\nOn-chain analytics firm Santiment reported that Bitcoin has surpassed the $42K mark, while altcoins have not yet followed suit. Interestingly, the SP500 achieved a new all-time highs just yesterday, fueling the bullish argument for crypto.\n\nPhoto by Matt Benzero on Shutterstock\n\nRead Next: Jim Cramer Advises Against Using Binance, Provokes Strong Reactions From Twitter Users"

        "content": "Polygon Labs is introducing a potential solution to the Ethereum blockchain's fragmentation issues. In February, the L2 Ethereum scaling solution plans to launch AggLayer - a decentralized protocol that relies on zk-proofs to unite different blockchains into one single layer of usability.\n\nAggLayer is central to the development team's vision of making Ethereum as easy to navigate and engage with as the everyday internet, to encourage the general public to get on board with Web3. To achieve this, the user experience has to be greatly improved from its current state.\n\nIn the last couple of years, the fast pace of development in the sector has led to many improvements in UX, but these have also introduced new challenges.\n\nA modular blockchain architecture has allowed the ecosystem to surpass the scalability issues of the first monolithic chains. However, their proliferation has created a deeply fragmented ecosystem, where users and liquidity are separated on their own individual chains.\n\nThe purpose of AggLayer is to create an \"environment that feels like a single chain\" for end users to seamlessly transact and move between dApps built on different chains. As Polygon state, \"There will be no mass adoption with siloed liquidity and users.\"\n\nDevelopers will also benefit, as using the protocol will allow them to attract users regardless of where they choose to build their projects. Additionally, as the proposal eliminates the need for complicated bridging schemes, individual chains will be able to maintain their full sovereignty.\n\nIn this way, the protocol is hoping to enable \"near-instant, atomic transactions, unifies liquidity across the ecosystem, creates capital efficiency, and dramatically improves UX.\"\n\nPolygon Labs is just one of the development teams trying to solve the fragmented liquidity issue. Also this week, Ethereum Layer 2 protocol Polymer announced its plans to integrate the Cosmos Inter Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol into the Ethereum ecosystem to allow for cross-chain dApps on the blockchain.\n\nPolygon's vision will likely gain more traction as the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) chain has a much larger user base. According to blockchain analytics firm Flipside, in 2023, Polygon acquired 15.4 million users.\n\nAlmost 40% of these new users joined the chain in January, followed by a steady decline in monthly user acquisition. However, the L2 solution was still the blockchain that gained the second most users in the industry, just 160,000 users less than Ethereum and almost 5 million more than Bitcoin.\n\n'Aggregation Day', planned for next month, will open the way for more users to join the network and, by doing so, take the vision of a united and uniform Web3 forwards."

        "title": "Spot Bitcoin ETF flows show Negative Trend since launch as Ethereum Options out of Sync with Bullish sentiment - Tekedia",
        "content": "The spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) launched by ProShares in October 2021 has seen its first net outflow of funds since its inception, according to data from ETF.com. The fund, which trades under the ticker BITO, had a net outflow of $12.6 million on January 25, 2024, bringing its total assets under management (AUM) to $1.18 billion.\n\nThis marks the first time that BITO has experienced a negative trend in its daily flows, which measure the net amount of money moving in or out of the fund. Since its launch, BITO has attracted significant investor interest, becoming the fastest ETF to reach $1 billion in AUM in just two days.\n\nBITO tracks the price of Bitcoin using futures contracts traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), which are settled in cash and not in actual Bitcoin.\n\nThe negative flow for BITO coincides with a sharp drop in the price of Bitcoin, which fell below $30,000 for the first time since July 2021 on January 25. The cryptocurrency market has been under pressure from regulatory uncertainty, environmental concerns, and competition from other digital assets.\n\nSome analysts have also suggested that the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs, which allow investors to gain exposure to the actual Bitcoin rather than futures contracts, may have reduced the demand for BITO and other futures-based ETFs.\n\nHowever, not all spot Bitcoin ETFs have fared well either. The Valkyrie Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BTF), which launched on January 3, 2024, as the first spot Bitcoin ETF in the U.S., has also seen a net outflow of $3.4 million on January 25, bringing its AUM to $69.4 million. The fund, which trades under the ticker BTF, holds Bitcoin in a trust and charges a 0.9% expense ratio.\n\nThe only spot Bitcoin ETF that has seen a positive flow on January 25 is the VanEck Bitcoin Trust (XBTF), which launched on January 5, 2024, as the second spot Bitcoin ETF in the U.S. The fund, which trades under the ticker XBTF, had a net inflow of $2.7 million on January 25, increasing its AUM to $32.7 million. The fund also holds Bitcoin in a trust and charges a 0.65% expense ratio.\n\nThe performance of the three spot Bitcoin ETFs may indicate that investors are more sensitive to fees and brand recognition when choosing which fund to invest in. VanEck is a well-known name in the ETF industry, having launched several successful funds in the past, such as the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (GDX) and the VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH). Valkyrie and ProShares are relatively new entrants in the ETF space and may have to compete harder to attract and retain investors.\n\nThe future of Bitcoin ETFs remains uncertain, as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has yet to approve any ETF that directly tracks the price of Bitcoin using physical custody or a decentralized network. The SEC has expressed concerns about the potential for fraud, manipulation, and theft in the Bitcoin market, and has asked for more public input on how to address these issues.\n\nUntil then, investors who want to gain exposure to Bitcoin through an ETF will have to choose between futures-based or trust-based funds, each with their own advantages and disadvantages.\n\nEthereum Options out of Sync with Bullish sentiment\n\nEther, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has been on a tear lately, reaching new all-time highs and outperforming bitcoin in terms of percentage gains. However, the options market seems to be lagging behind the bullish momentum, as implied volatility and skew indicators suggest a lack of enthusiasm among traders.\n\nImplied volatility (IV) is a measure of how much the market expects the price of an asset to move in the future. It is derived from the prices of options contracts, which give the buyer the right but not the obligation to buy or sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price and date. The higher the IV, the more expensive the options and the greater the expected price fluctuations.\n\nSkew is a measure of how much the options market favors one direction over another. It is calculated by comparing the IV of out-of-the-money (OTM) calls and puts, which are options that have strike prices above or below the current market price, respectively. A positive skew means that OTM calls have higher IV than OTM puts, indicating a higher demand for bullish bets. A negative skew means that OTM puts have higher IV than OTM calls, indicating a higher demand for bearish bets.\n\nAccording to data from Skew, the one-month IV for ether options has dropped to 86%, the lowest level since October 2020. This implies that the options market is not expecting any major price movements in ether in the next 30 days, despite the recent rally and the upcoming launch of Ethereum 2.0, which is expected to improve the network\u2019s scalability and security.\n\nMoreover, the one-month skew for ether options has turned negative, reaching -7%, the lowest level since November 2020. This means that OTM puts are more expensive than OTM calls, indicating a higher demand for downside protection than upside speculation.\n\nThese indicators suggest that ether options traders are either taking profits after the rally, hedging their long positions against a possible correction, or simply waiting for more clarity on the direction of the market. In contrast, spot and futures markets are showing more bullish signs, as ether\u2019s price and open interest continue to climb to new highs.\n\nOne possible explanation for this divergence is that options traders are more cautious and rational than spot and futures traders, who may be driven by emotions and FOMO (fear of missing out). Another possibility is that options traders are underestimating the potential of ether and Ethereum 2.0 and are missing out on a rare opportunity to profit from a paradigm shift in the crypto space.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nWhatsApp\n\nLinkedIn\n\nEmail\n\nPrint\n\n"

        "title": "Ethereum Price Could Plunge Below $1000 In Coming Months, Warns Crypto Analyst Benjamin Cowen - CryptoGlobe",
        "content": "In a recent video, crypto analyst Benjamin Cowen discussed several key points regarding Ethereum (ETH) and its potential future movements, particularly in relation to Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nHere are the main highlights:\n\nEthereum\u2019s Performance Relative to Bitcoin: Cowen notes that the future direction of Ethereum (ETH) is closely tied to its performance relative to Bitcoin. He points out that if Bitcoin were to experience a significant bounce, it would likely impact Ethereum\u2019s value in USD. However, a key factor to watch is how Ethereum performs against Bitcoin during this period. Historical Price Patterns of Ethereum: Cowen references past cycles to speculate on Ethereum\u2019s potential future movements. He observes that Ethereum has historically followed a pattern of forming a low, then higher lows, before eventually breaking down. This pattern suggests that Ethereum might test the integrity of its previous lows before potentially experiencing a larger drop. Implications of Ethereum-Bitcoin (ETH/BTC) Pair: According to Cowen, the ETH/BTC pair is critical in determining Ethereum\u2019s future. He suggests that if this pair breaks down, it would precede a significant drop in Ethereum\u2019s USD value. This pattern has been observed in previous cycles where a breakdown in the ETH/BTC pair led to substantial corrections in Ethereum\u2019s USD value. Testing of Previous Lows: Cowen speculates that Ethereum will likely test its previous lows below $1,000, but this might not happen until after the ETH/BTC pair breaks down. He emphasizes the historical tendency of Ethereum to retest its low points before any substantial recovery or further decline. Possible Scenarios for Ethereum\u2019s Movement: Cowen discusses various scenarios for Ethereum\u2019s movement in the coming months. He considers the possibility of Ethereum experiencing a slow bleed in value or receiving one more significant push higher, similar to a past movement that saw a substantial increase in its value. Influence of Bitcoin\u2019s Movements: Cowen argues that any significant upward movement in Ethereum\u2019s value is contingent on Bitcoin experiencing a bounce first. He stresses that Ethereum\u2019s future movements are heavily influenced by Bitcoin\u2019s market behavior. Uncertainty and Market Dynamics: Cowen acknowledges the uncertainty in these predictions, highlighting the complexity of market dynamics and the influence of various narratives, such as those around the Ethereum spot ETF and Bitcoin halving.\n\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at around $2,257, down 0.33% in the past 24-hour period.\n\nFeatured Image via Pixabay"

Innovative Ecosystem: Retik Finance has created a comprehensive DeFi ecosystem that goes beyond the typical offerings of many cryptocurrencies. This ecosystem includes the Retik Wallet, DeFi Debit Cards, and Retik Pay, all of which are designed to enhance the user experience by facilitating easy and secure transactions. By leveraging the power of blockchain technology, Retik Finance aims to address the shortcomings of traditional financial systems.\n\n2. The $RETIK Token: At the heart of Retik Finance\u2019s ecosystem lies the $RETIK token, a digital currency that serves as the lifeblood of the platform. However, its utility extends beyond the Retik Finance ecosystem, making it a versatile and attractive investment option for crypto enthusiasts. With a limited supply and growing demand, the $RETIK token has the potential for significant price appreciation.\n\n3. Strong Community Support: Like any successful cryptocurrency, Retik Finance has garnered a dedicated community of supporters who believe in its vision. Community engagement and support are crucial in the crypto world, and Retik Finance has demonstrated its ability to rally enthusiasts around its cause.\n\nRetik Finance: Current Status\n\nAs of the time of writing, Retik Finance finds itself in an exciting stage of its development: Retik Presale Stage 7. During this stage, one RETIK token is priced at a mere $0.09, making it incredibly accessible to a wide range of investors. However, the affordability of RETIK does not diminish its potential; quite the opposite.The Retik Presale Stage 7 is 84.57% filled, indicating strong interest and demand within the crypto community. This level of participation underscores the project\u2019s viability and the belief that RETIK Finance has something valuable to offer. In terms of fundraising, the stage has raised an impressive $13,537,209 out of the $17,200,000 target, indicating that there is substantial backing for the project.In terms of token availability, 224,120,023 RETIK tokens have already been sold during this stage, out of a total supply of 265,000,000. This indicates that there is still room for interested investors to participate in the presale and secure their RETIK tokens at the current attractive price.\n\nWhy RETIK Finance Stands Out\n\n1. Affordability: One of the most striking aspects of RETIK Finance is its affordability. With each token priced at just $0.09 during the Retik Presale Stage 7, it opens the door for a broad spectrum of investors, from newcomers to seasoned traders. This accessibility is a stark contrast to Ethereum, which has seen its price rise significantly over the years, potentially pricing out some prospective investors.\n\n2. Innovation: RETIK Finance\u2019s innovative approach to DeFi and its comprehensive ecosystem set it apart from many other cryptocurrencies. While Ethereum laid the foundation for smart contracts and dApps, RETIK Finance takes these concepts to the next level by offering a complete financial solution that can seamlessly integrate with traditional finance.\n\n3. Growing Community: The enthusiastic and growing community supporting RETIK Finance bodes well for its future. A strong and engaged user base can contribute significantly to a project\u2019s success, and RETIK Finance has managed to cultivate just that.\n\nConclusion\n\nEthereum has long been a frontrunner in the cryptocurrency space, but the emergence of alternatives like Retik Finance (RETIK) is a testament to the dynamism and innovation of the crypto industry. With its affordable price of $0.09 during the Retik Presale Stage 7, Retik Finance offers accessibility and potential that could rival Ethereum.As the crypto landscape continues to evolve, it\u2019s essential to keep an eye on projects like RETIK Finance that bring fresh ideas and solutions to the table. While Ethereum has its merits, the allure of an Ethereum alternative that combines affordability, innovation, and a growing community cannot be ignored. As the crypto journey unfolds, RETIK Finance is a name to watch, and its current status in the Retik Presale Stage 7 only adds to its appeal as a promising Ethereum alternative.\n\nClick Here To Take Part In Retik Finance Presale\n\nVisit the links below for more information about Retik Finance (RETIK):\n\nWebsite: https://retik.com\n\nWhitepaper: https://retik.com/retik-whitepaper.pdf\n\nLinktree: https://linktr.ee/retikfinance"

Trials of Dencun will be conducted on the Sepolia and Holesky test networks on January 30 and February 7, respectively, which puts the update on track to reach the main network in late February or early March.\n\nIt is known so far that a group of Ethereum developers, who are planning the blockchain\u2019s biggest upgrade in a year, known as Dencun, have confirmed in a blog post the dates for making the changes on two key test networks, which are theoretically the last steps before going live on the mainnet .\n\nDencun is a major upgrade or \u201chard fork\u201d planned for the Ethereum blockchain that will enable \u201cproto-danksharding,\u201d a technical feature that will lower the cost of transactions on Layer 2, as well as make data available on the blockchain cheaper.\n\nBefore it goes live on the main blockchain, developers will conduct a dress rehearsal of the protocol changes on the Sepolia and Holesky test networks on Jan. 30 and Feb. 7.\n\nThe announcement follows the upgrade that took place last week on the Goerli testnet, which was successfully activated despite some minor hiccups. Dencun will go live on Sepolia at 22:51 UTC and epoch 132608. If all goes according to plan, the final test for Dencun will take place at Holesky on February 7 at 11:34 UTC, epoch 950272.\n\nAfter that, the developers will set a date for Dencun to hit the Ethereum mainnet, which is now targeted for late February or early March.\n\n."

Its increased trading volumes & higher staking yields pushed the AVAX price to its highest since May 2022. However, Avalanche (AVAX) has been on a decline recently.\n\nThe fall in AVAX price can be attributed partly to fewer people utilizing Avalanche\u2019s C-Chain.

        "content": "SPONSORED POST*\n\nSolana (SOL) was one of the best cryptos to invest in last year, delivering investors over 300% returns. Its prices have dropped considerably since the start of 2024, going from a high of $125 set on Christmas Day to its current price of $86.\n\nHowever, strong support was found at $76 and strong bull patterns have been forming on price charts ever since. A prominent trader who goes by the nickname Bluntz Capital predicts prices will surge by 40% soon.\n\nMeanwhile, an increasing number of Ethereum (ETH) whales are gravitating toward one of the best DeFi altcoins launched on its network: InQubeta (QUBE).\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause InQubeta is on course to earn investors substantially more profits as it opens access to artificial intelligence (AI) investments to people who don\u2019t meet the requisites of traditional avenues and those who don\u2019t have access to them.\n\nQUBE, InQubeta\u2019s governance and native token, has outperformed ETH in the past twelve months, earning investors 220% returns, while ETH only delivered 37% returns to its investors.\n\nAnalysts project InQubeta (QUBE) will be more profitable than investing in BTC ETFs or ETH\n\nThe artificial intelligence industry has passed major milestones in the past couple of decades, taking the technology from a fancy science fiction concept to a reality. Self-driving taxis now exist and humanoid robots are closer than ever to replacing human laborers. InQubeta aims to democratize access to investing in the AI startups that are pushing these changes.\n\nTraditional investing channels usually have income or net worth requirements that disqualify a large portion of the global population from using their services, but InQubeta uses a crowdfunding approach where everyone is welcome.\n\nAI investments have surged considerably in the past several years, from a mere $12 billion in 2015 to more than $120 billion at present. That figure is anticipated to exceed $1.5 trillion by 2030. InQubeta is the first DeFi crypto coin to focus on making AI investments easier to access, which sets it up for exponential growth as it connects AI startups with financiers.\n\nHere\u2019s how the decentralized investment ecosystem works:\n\nAI startups that are eligible to raise capital on the network create ERC20 coins that offer rewards or equity. Rewards might be in the form of discounts on products created or a share of profits made\n\nthat offer rewards or equity. Rewards might be in the form of discounts on products created or a share of profits made ERC20 coins , non-fungible tokens, are split into thousands of smaller pieces that are more affordable for most investors\n\n, non-fungible tokens, are split into thousands of smaller pieces that are more affordable for most investors Investors are provided resources that include information on the different companies seeking capital and expert opinions. They finance companies they find promising with QUBE\n\nThey can resell any tokens they purchase on the marketplace at any time of their choosing\n\nSolana (SOL) prices poised for 40% surge\n\nSOL prices have come down quite a bit since they broke the $125 resistance level, but analysts like Bluntz Capital expect prices to rebound soon. Solana was one of the best DeFi coins in 2023, and it emerged as the Ethereum network\u2019s main competitor after its market cap surpassed rivals like Cardano (ADA).\n\nSolana\u2019s exponential growth has been attributed to its consistent efforts to expand the services it offers and its growing user base. SOL tokens are probably as cheap as they\u2019re going to be right now.\n\nThe improvements made to the Solana blockchain in 2023 earned attention from notable personalities in the investing space, including Franklin Templeton CEO, Jenny Johnson.\n\nSummary\n\nQUBE and SOL are two of the best cryptocurrencies to invest in today. SOL appears poised to surge and it could grow as much as 3x this year. QUBE is set for 37.5% more growth before tokens are released on exchanges, and some projections expect prices to surge as much as 10,000% afterward.\n\nVisit InQubeta Presale\n\nJoin The InQubeta Communities\n\n*This article was paid for.
