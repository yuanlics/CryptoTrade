        "title": "Where Will Ethereum Be in 5 Years? - The Motley Fool",
        "summary": "  Ethereum is expected to continue its upward trend as it upgrades its platform and improves its transaction speed, despite competition from \"Ethereum killers\" like Avalanche, Cardano, and Algorand. The planned upgrade to a proof-of-stake system and the implementation of sharding, which will split the workload of validating transactions into smaller batches, are expected to boost Ethereum's speed. Additionally, security updates and a potential shift towards a stateless system in the long run could further solidify Ethereum's position as the leading smart-contract platform. While the upstarts may pose a challenge, Ethereum's established developer community and industry standards give it a significant advantage."

        "summary": "  Sure, here's a summary of the article in less than 256 tokens:\n\nEthereum price has seen a 4% increase over the past three days, trading at $2280. The $2200 level has acted as a support, and the Fear and Greed Index is neutral. The intraday trading volume is up 10.3%. The recent correction saw a 20% decrease, but the price has demonstrated resilience around $2200. A breakout above the $2430 level could lead to a 6.85% relief rally. However, the $2430 level aligns with the 50% Fibonacci retracement level, and sellers are likely to defend it vigorously. Examining the daily chart, corrections are typical for Ethereum, often serving as a precursor to subsequent upward movements. The 100-day EMA slope at $2200 has shown sustainability as valid pullback support, and the daily RSI slope is bearish below 45%."
