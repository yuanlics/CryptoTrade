Gensler's comments suggest a potential distinction between Bitcoin's status as a commodity and the status of other cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum. The article notes that the SEC has not officially declared Ethereum's security status, but previous legal filings indicate that the agency is considering Ethereum transactions as falling under its jurisdiction.
