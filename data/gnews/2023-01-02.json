        "content": "Ethereum Name Service (ENS), a distributed domain name service based on the Ethereum blockchain, announced that it saw over 2.2 million new registrations in 2022.\n\nThe service celebrated its most successful year yet as it became the most widely integrated blockchain naming standard on the market.\n\nThe 2.2 million new ENS names registered in 2022 also represent around 80% of all of the domains ever created. Data from Dune Analytics showed that the fastest registration rate was recorded in September 2022, with over 400,000 new names registered. As the year came to an end, the registration pace slowed down and December closed with only around 50,000 new names added.\n\nThis brings the total number of ENS names created so far to 2.8 million according to Dune Analytics. Data from the platform itself puts this number at around 2.76 million.\n\nThe 2.8 million names belong to around 600,000 unique participants in the ENS naming service, showing that owning multiple names has become a standard in the community.\n\nThe fast registration rate recorded in September could have been a result of Coinbase\u2019s ENS integration. The exchange enabled users to change their wallet usernames to an ENS subdomain of Coinbase IDs in late August. Coinbase said that the ENS address can be used to send, receive, and trade coins and that it will be available both to regular and pro users.\n\nAt the time, the platform\u2019s native token ENS also reached its all-time high of $20.05. The token dropped significantly since its September peak, bottoming during the FTX collapse, and has now consolidated at around $11.10.\n\nGraph showing the price of ENS from July 2022 to December 2022 (Source: CryptoSlate)\n\nAlmost a year ago, ENS announced that it was working on adopting Ethereum Layer-2 support. At the end of January 2022, the service had the first version of its off-chain resolution implemented and was ready to be tested by developers. While it\u2019s still unclear when Layer-2 support will be launched, the implementation could result in a new wave of name registrations for ENS.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "content": "2022 proved to be a fruitful year for Ethereum Name Service, with the platform recording 2.2 million registered domains despite unfavorable market conditions for the cryptocurrency space.\n\nAccording to the service, over 80% of the total ENS domains created since the project\u2019s inception were registered in 2022. Data from Dune Analytics shows that ENS has around 2.82 million names registered as of Jan. 2, with 630,340 owners of ENS domains.\n\nHappy New Year everyone!\n\n\n\n2022 was an incredible year for ENS!\n\n\n\nOver 2.2m ENS names were registered in 2022 (that's 80% of ALL names created)\n\n\n\nIf you're ready for 2023, drop your ENS below \u2728 \u2014 ens.eth (@ensdomains) January 1, 2023\n\nAs Cointelegraph previously explored in an exclusive interview with founder Nick Johnson, ENS allows users to map human-readable names like \u201cnick.eth\u201d to machine-readable information like cryptocurrency addresses and URLs.\n\nThe service has been driven by users adopting ENS names for decentralized profiles that work across decentralized applications and platforms. ENS domains serve as Ethereum wallet addresses, cryptographic hashes or website URLs and are effectively nonfungible tokens (NFTs).\n\nRelated: Ethereum co-founder\u2019s poll shows people want $100 lifetime .eth domains\n\nThe growing popularity of the service saw a number of partnerships with major exchange operators like Coinbase come to the fore. The American exchange announced the integration of ENS in September 2022, giving users the ability to replace traditional Coinbase cryptocurrency wallet addresses with language-based usernames.\n\nWhile default ENS domains end with .eth, Coinbase\u2019s integration of the service allows users to claim \u201cname.cb.id\u201d usernames using the Coinbase Wallet browser extension. Coinbase\u2019s adoption of the ENS service was driven by the utility of human-readable names in making Web3 more user-friendly.\n\nData shows that September saw the largest number of ENS registrations created in 2022, with 437,000 domains registered. The data suggests that the exchange\u2019s ENS integration significantly impacted new sign-ups in 2022. May 2022 was also a bumper month for the service, with low gas fees on the Ethereum network playing a role in a surge of .eth domain registrations."

Discover SCENE\n\nThe price of embattled cryptocurrency Solana (SOL) has shot up by over 11% over the past 24 hours, per CoinGecko. The New Year price bump has seen the cryptocurrency reclaim $11 after several days trading below double-digits.\n\nThe news follows a show of support from Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin, who tweeted last week that \u201csmart people\u201d have told him there is an \u201cearnest smart developer community in Solana,\u201d and that the chain has \u201ca bright future\u201d now that \u201cthe awful opportunistic money people have been washed out.\u201d Buterin added that he hopes the Solana community \u201cgets its fair chance to thrive.\u201d\n\nHowever, Solana\u2019s New Year pump hasn\u2019t canceled out the battering the would-be \u201cEthereum killer\u201d has taken over recent months.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSome smart people tell me there is an earnest smart developer community in Solana, and now that the awful opportunistic money people have been washed out, the chain has a bright future.

        "content": "First-time NFT creators and collectors often start their journey with a simple Google search.\n\nBut the hunt to find the best place to buy an NFT \u2014 which hinges heavily upon unique digital collectible needs \u2014 now, more than ever, needs the right context and due diligence. Many holders who snapped up their NFTs via FTX were hit with a rude awakening by the exchange\u2019s bankruptcy. Their elaborate and creative expressions of digital art are now, at least for the moment, worth not much more than a 404 error.\n\nNo guide can eliminate entirely the downsides of investing in NFTs, or any other cryptoasset, but this one is designed to break down how and why each exchange can or cannot meet your own NFT wants and needs.\n\nRead more: NFT Investing Explained\n\nBreaking down NFT auctions\n\nDifferent NFT marketplaces come with different standards for the auctions that govern their transactions.\n\nA Dutch auction, for one, uses a declining price format \u2014 unlike the more familiar English model. The seller kicks things off with a relatively high ask price and gradually lowers it until a bidder decides to lock it in. The first bidder to accept the current price wins. Dutch auctions are intended to sell NFTs with enough demand quickly.\n\nAn English NFT auction employs the crypto version of the eBay model. The seller sets a low floor, and bidders compete by placing increasingly higher offers until the auction ends at a pre-determined time \u2014 when the highest roller wins out. English auctions help lesser-known artists sell NFTs at a fair price. But sellers can also use the format to bid and manipulate the price anonymously.\n\nBest NFT Marketplaces\n\nOpenSea\n\nBlockchains Arbitrum, Ethereum, Klatyn, Optimism, Polygon, Solana Focus Art, collectibles, domain names, music, photography, sport, trading cards, utility, virtual worlds Fees 2.5% per sale Auction English, Dutch Royalties 10% maximum per sale Best for Art collectors, NFT flippers Pros Easy onboarding, support for multiple wallets\n\nHigh liquidity\n\nWide variety of listed NFTs, collections\n\nAdvanced tools for creators\n\nEducational guides for beginners\n\nMulti-chain support\n\nAndroid, iOS apps Cons Marketplace can be somewhat cluttered\n\nRecord of security breaches resulting in losses\n\nPast allegations of insider trading Launched in December 2017, OpenSea became the first Ethereum-based NFT trading platform. The marketplace rose in prominence as the industry grew and now handles more than 50% of all NFT trading volume \u2014 good for the largest marketplace, with more than a million registered users.\n\nBut, since OpenSea is the most popular, sellers are especially forced to compete to get their NFTs noticed by buyers. The setup makes it difficult for new sellers to stand out and may result in lower sales.\n\nOpenSea provides a wide suite of tools for creators to mint and list new collections. It also comes with a minimalistic interface to browse and purchase NFTs \u2014 using a range of payment options. From the platform\u2019s Ethereum roots, OpenSea has recently expanded to support NFTs on five additional chains, notably Solana and Polygon.\n\nExample of an OpenSea NFT\n\nSpace Daddie #001\n\nOwned by CASHRULEZ\n\nRead more: As OpenSea Flexes Marketplace Influence, Some Users Are Worried\n\nMagic Eden\n\nBlockchains Ethereum, Solana Focus Collectibles, art, gaming Fees 2% per sale Auction Timed auction Royalties Defined by creator Best for NFT collectors, flippers Pros User-friendly interface\n\nDecent volumes\n\nSlightly lower fees compared to OpenSea, in parts thanks to Solana-nativity\n\nDrop calendar to track upcoming mints\n\nSupports multiple wallets across listed networks\n\niOS app Cons Supports only Ethereum, Solana\n\nLimited options compared to OpenSea\n\nOnly supports verified creators and collections, limiting opportunities for up-and-coming artists\n\nDespite launching in September 2021, Magic Eden is already the most popular NFT marketplace on the Solana (native token, SOL) network. It has the highest number of users among SOL NFT markets, and is the second-largest NFT platform in terms of trading volume, trailing only OpenSea.\n\nMagic Eden is especially sought-after by collectors hunting for fresh, up-and-coming items. The Magic Eden Launchpad hosts regular NFT mints to connect creators with collectors. While the platform started off as Solana-native, it has expanded to enable support for Ethereum-based NFTs \u2014 and has additional networks in the pipeline.\n\nExample of a Magic Eden NFT\n\nRead More: Solana Marketplace Magic Eden To Offer Ethereum NFTs\n\nRarible\n\nBlockchains Ethereum, Flow, ImmutableX, Polygon, Solana, Tezos Focus Collectibles, art, gaming, virtual worlds Fees 1% fee from buyer, 1% fee from seller Auction English auction Royalties 10% maximum per sale Best for Collectors, gamers Pros Multi-chain support\n\nNFT aggregator for seamless purchases across supported marketplaces\n\nEnables creators to launch individual marketplaces\n\nAndroid and iOS apps available\n\nTrading fees distributed between buyer and seller Cons Limited NFT options compared to competitors\n\nRelatively difficult for new creators to break through (platform dominated by influencers)\n\nRarible launched in early 2020 and grabbed a significant portion of overall market share as the NFT industry saw increased adoption later that year. Rarible is one of few NFT marketplaces with a native token, releasing its RARI token roughly one year after launch. The token allows users to influence platform upgrades and access certain unique features.\n\nRARI token holders can submit or vote on proposals regarding trading fees, new features and related governance proposals. Such votes are advisory, not binding, so the Rarible team still has the final call.\n\nToken holders also decide which NFTs to showcase and feature. NFTs listed first are more likely to attract sales than those buried at the bottom of a long list.\n\nRarible has a unique appeal for creators. It provides a filter for buyers to explore top influencers and artists. This feature allows creators to build a closer relationship with their respective collector communities. The platform also offers an aggregator, allowing users to buy NFTs listed on competitors.\n\nExample of a Rarible NFT\n\nRead more: Web3 Watch: Rarible Revamps Marketplace, ApeCoin DAO Adds Bug Bounty\n\nNifty Gateway\n\nBlockchain Ethereum Marketplace focus Art, collectibles, gaming, music, social, style Fees 15% Auction style English auction Royalties Defined by creator \u2014 Nifty Gateway takes 5% royalty fee, plus 30 cents per transaction Best suited for Power NFT collectors Pros Exclusive appeal, rigorous vetting approach attract high-profile buyers\n\nMajority of listed items are top collectibles\n\nSupports fiat payments\n\nAndroid, iOS apps\n\nLive customer service via chat Cons Only supports Ethereum network, Metamask wallet\n\nSupports few NFT categories compared to competitors\n\nNifty Gateway ranks high on the NFT marketplace list for influencers, celebrities and brands to create limited-edition items.

Users need to register and verify their identities with Binance to access the platform. Creators and collectors transact in three main cryptocurrencies: BNB, BUSD and ETH.\n\nUsers can purchase individual items or mystery boxes containing various curated collections. There is also a \u201cpremium\u201d and \u201cstandard\u201d collection listing. Premium collections are exclusive drops from popular influencers, while the standard collection features items minted by typical users.\n\nSince launching, the Binance NFT marketplace has organized NFT drops for popular celebrities and entities, including Russell Simmons, Paulo Del Valle, the Uganda National Museum, Franck Muller and Parimatch. The highest recorded sale on the Binance NFT marketplace for newbies is $2.8 million.\n\nExample of a Binance NFT\n\nBBC Gas\n\nBullBTCCLUB\n\n\n\nRead more: Binance to Debut NFT Marketplace with Warhol, Dali Thursday\n\nCoinbase NFT\n\nBlockchain Ethereum Marketplace focus Art, collectibles, virtual worlds Fees None (could change in future) Auction style Timed auctions Royalties Defined by creator Best suited for Art and collectibles collectors Pros Beginner-friendly\n\nDecent liquidity\n\nAggregate listing option supports direct purchase of NFTs listed on other marketplaces (OpenSea and LooksRare)\n\nNFT drops calendar to track upcoming mints\n\nCurated list of popular creators simplifies decision-making for buyers Cons Supports only Ethereum-based NFTs\n\nLists fewer assets than competitors\n\nCoinbase is another centralized cryptocurrency exchange that recently ventured into the NFT industry.

The platform carved a niche for itself and is widely considered as the best NFT marketplace for buying exclusive artwork from verified creators.\n\nSuperRare, too, has a native asset: its RARE token. RARE holders form the RareDAO and have the chance to curate the marketplace, define listing parameters and influence platform upgrades. Since launching in 2018, artists on SuperRare have earned over $760 million, with secondary sales topping $100 million over the same period.\n\nExample of a SuperRare NFT\n\nTower 01 \u2013 Hydrology\n\nArtistschmooze\n\nRead more: Netgear Joins SuperRare DAO to Develop NFT Art Licensing Model\n\nMakersPlace\n\nBlockchain Ethereum Marketplace focus Art, music, photography Fees 15% Auction style Time-based Royalties 10% paid to creator, 2.5% to MakersPlace Best suited for Digital art collectors Pros User-friendly experience\n\nAdvanced tools for creators to launch digital art storefronts\n\nSupport fiat deposits\n\nBoth live chat and email support for creators Cons: Exorbitant fees\n\nSupports only Ethereum NFTs\n\nLimited access for new creators\n\nMakersPlace launched in 2018 and primarily offers a platform where you can buy NFT art.

Advanced search filters and support for fiat payment also sets the platform apart as one of the best NFT trading platforms.\n\nExample of a MakersPlace NFT\n\nSpace Club\n\nArtchizest\n\nRead more: How NFT Royalties Work \u2013 and Sometimes Don\u2019t\n\nNext steps after choosing an NFT trading platform\n\nEvaluate what NFT you want to buy\n\nThere are millions of NFT collections. The best NFTs to invest in, however, are generally those with a strong community or artwork that personally appeals to you. It could also be the work of an upcoming artist that has the potential to increase in value as the artist rises in prominence. As a rule of thumb, buying an NFT simply because an influencer promotes it may turn out to be a poor investment.\n\nBuy it\n\nOnce you have your mind made up, the next step is to make the purchase. The steps on how to buy an NFT differ from one platform to the next. It typically involves setting up a Web3 wallet, or registering on the NFT marketplace website and completing their KYC process. Next, fund your wallet with the purchase amount, or make the purchase using your credit card if it\u2019s supported by the platform.\n\nStore your NFT in a wallet\n\nLike cryptocurrencies, you can store NFTs in a self-custodied wallet. While it is common practice to use mobile or browser-native wallets for NFT storage, a hardware wallet offers the most secure experience. These devices typically store your assets offline and remove a common attack vector for hackers. Ideally, a hardware wallet is a compulsory option for investors putting huge sums into the NFT market.\n\nSell NFTs later to book profit\n\nWhile most NFTs offer an art appeal, they are also investment assets. If you\u2019re inclined to sell your NFT, we recommend reading a guide on how to sell an NFT on your chosen NFT trading platform. That way, you can avoid potential losses often associated with listing NFTs for the wrong prices or other potential mishaps. It also allows you to use the best withdrawal method to save on fees and get full value for each sale.\n\nThe NFT marketplace as a whole\n\nThis article provides an exhaustive NFT marketplace list, reviewing the likes of features and pros and cons, as well as fees. OpenSea and Magic Eden are the most popular to buy from, with a wide range of collections and support for a number of blockchains.\n\nRarible, SuperRare, MakersPlace and Nifty Gateway specialize in artwork and exclusive drops from influencers and popular artists. Binance and Coinbase\u2019s NFT platforms, meanwhile, have grown in prominence \u2014 providing centralized trading venues for investors.\n\nThe best NFT marketplace is ultimately the one that meets your profile and specific needs as a creator or collector. Each platform has its own pluses and minuses and could come in handy at different stages of your digital collectibles journey."
