Rollups are a scaling solution for the Ethereum network that will allow for faster and cheaper transactions. The development of Rollups is divided into three stages, with the first stage involving full verification of transactions without operator intervention. In the second stage, the technology will have a transaction verification method to accept or reject transactions allowed by smart contracts, and a security council to oversee the process. In the third stage, there will be two distinct fraud provers or validity provers, and upgrades will be supported but with a delay of more than 30 days."
