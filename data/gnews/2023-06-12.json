        "summary": "  Gary Gensler, the current Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair, made remarks in a 2018 video that suggest he does not consider Ethereum and Litecoin to be securities. In a speech at a crypto-themed event hosted by Bloomberg and Fidelity, Gensler stated that over 70% of the crypto market is composed of Bitcoin, Ether, Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash, and that these four cryptocurrencies are not securities. This contradicts his more recent statements suggesting that all cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin are securities. Gensler's remarks were made in a personal capacity and do not reflect the SEC's current legal position, according to crypto lawyer Preston Byrne. The SEC declined to comment on potential conflicts between Gensler's 2018 remarks and the agency's current legal stance."
