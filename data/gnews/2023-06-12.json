        "content": "BOCI, an investment arm of the Bank of China, issued tokenized notes in Hong Kong, marking the first time that a financial institution in China has issued a digital note in the region.\n\nUBS partnered with BOCI to issue the notes, which were tokenized on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nBOCI issued 200 million Chinese yuan worth of notes, which translates to roughly $28 million.\n\n\u201dWorking together with UBS, we are driving the simplification of digital asset markets and products, for customers in Asia Pacific through the development of blockchain-based digital structured products, designed specifically for customers in Asia Pacific. We are encouraged by the evolution of Hong Kong\u2019s digital economy and are committed to promoting the digital transformation and innovative development of Hong Kong\u2019s financial industry,\u201d said Ying Wang, deputy CEO at BOCI.\n\nHong Kong is working toward becoming a crypto hub, with Paul Chan Mo-po, the financial secretary, previously saying that Hong Kong will be embracing regulation.\n\nRead more: Hong Kong is getting cozy with crypto\n\n\u201cThe virtual asset market has fluctuated greatly, and some virtual asset exchanges have closed down recently, which makes some people in the society doubt the prospects of Web3. However, we believe this is the right time to push Web3 forward,\u201d he said in a blog post.\n\nThe special administrative region lifted its crypto retail trading ban this month and has encouraged crypto exchanges to seek licenses in the region.\n\nThe Securities and Futures Commission established exchange guidelines \u2014 and firms such as Huobi, OKX and BitMEX have expressed intentions to apply for a Hong Kong license.\n\nJohnny Ng, a Hong Kong legislator, has even invited Coinbase to establish a Hong Kong hub after the SEC sued the exchange last week.\n\nUBS did not respond to a request for comment asking for the transaction ID by the time of publication.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "Ethereum Price Could Avoid a Major Breakdown if it Closes Above One Key Level - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Ethereum price is moving lower from the $1,780 resistance against the US Dollar. ETH could decline heavily if there is a clear move below the $1,720 support.\n\nEthereum is struggling to clear the $1,780 and $1,800 resistance levels.\n\nThe price is trading below $1,800 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $1,760 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair could decline heavily if there is a close below $1,720.\n\nEthereum Price Remains At Risk\n\nEthereum\u2019s price attempted a fresh increase above the $1,775 and $1,780 resistance levels. ETH failed to gain bullish momentum above the $1,780 resistance, similar to Bitcoin.\n\nEarlier, the price climbed above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the key decline from the $1,854 swing high to the $1,718 low. The price is now back below $1,750 and showing bearish signs. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $1,760 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.\n\nEther is clearly struggling to clear $1,800 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. Immediate resistance is near the $1,755 zone and the trend line. The next major resistance is near the $1,780 level. It is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the key decline from the $1,854 swing high to the $1,718 low.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nA proper move above the $1,775 and $1,780 resistance levels might send Ether toward $1,850. The next resistance sits near $1,880, above which Ethereum could rise toward the key barrier at $1,920. Any more gains above the $1,920 resistance zone might send the price toward the $2,000 resistance.\n\nMore Downsides in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $1,755 resistance, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,720 level.\n\nThe next major support is near the $1,700 level. If there is a break and close below the $1,700 support, the price could decline toward the $1,640 support. Any more losses may perhaps send the price toward the $1,600 level or even $1,550 in the coming sessions.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bearish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $1,720\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $1,780\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "Vitalik Buterin: Ethereum 'fails' without these 3 important 'transitions' - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin believes the success of Ethereum will come down to three major technical \u201ctransitions\u201d that need to happen almost simultaneously \u2014 layer-2 scaling, wallet security and privacy-preserving features.\n\nIn a June 9 post via his personal blog, Buterin explained that the Ethereum blockchain outright \u201cfails\u201d without sufficient scaling infrastructure to make transactions cheap.\n\n\u201cEthereum fails because each transaction costs $3.75 ($82.48 if we have another bull run), and every product aiming for the mass market inevitably forgets about the chain and adopts centralized workarounds for everything,\u201d he said.\n\nAnother point of failure, according to Buterin, relates to smart contract wallets.\n\nHe explained that a move to smart contract wallets has caused some issues, because of complexities from the user experience side of things when users take control of multiple addresses at once.\n\nEthereum needs to improve its layer-2 scalability, wallet security and privacy features, according to Buterin. Source: Vitalik Buterin\u2019s website\n\nIn addition to wallets securing crypto assets, Buterin explained that wallets would need to secure data in order to truly transition into an on-chain world with zero-knowledge rollups:\n\n\u201cIn a ZK world, however, this is no longer true: the wallet is not just protecting authentication credentials, it's also holding your data.\u201d\n\nThe last of Buterin\u2019s three transitions \u2014 privacy \u2014 will need to come in the form of improved identity, reputation and social recovery systems.\n\n\u201cWithout the third, Ethereum fails because having all transactions (and POAPs, etc) available publicly for literally anyone to see is far too high a privacy sacrifice for many users, and everyone moves onto centralized solutions that at least somewhat hide your data,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Ethereum co-founder suggested that stealth addresses could be implemented to resolve this issue.\n\nRelated: Vitalik Buterin reveals 3 \u2018huge\u2019 opportunities for crypto in 2023\n\nButerin said that achieving all three will be \u201cchallenging\u201d because of the \u201cintense coordination\u201d involved between them.\n\nHe admitted that each of the three transitions \u201cweaken\u201d the \u201cone user \u2014 one address\u201d model, which, in turn, may complicate the way transactions are executed.\n\n\u201cIf you want to pay someone, how will you get the information on how to pay them?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf users have many assets stored in different places across different chains, how do they do key changes and social recovery?\" he added.\n\nButerin concluded by stressing the need to build infrastructure that ultimately improvers user experience:\n\n\u201cDespite the challenges, achieving scalability, wallet security, and privacy for regular users is crucial for Ethereum's future. It is not just about technical feasibility but about actual accessibility for regular users. We need to rise to meet this challenge.\u201d\n\nMagazine: ZK-rollups are \u2018the endgame\u2019 for scaling blockchains, Polygon Miden founder"
