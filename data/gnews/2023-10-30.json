        "content": "Ethereum price is consolidating gains below the $1,850 resistance against the US dollar. ETH must stay above the $1,750 support to start a fresh increase.\n\nEthereum is still struggling to gain pace for a move above $1,850.\n\nThe price is trading above $1,770 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere is a key contracting triangle forming with support near $1,780 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair could extend its decline if it fails to stay above the $1,740 support.\n\nEthereum Price Remains In Range\n\nEthereum failed to continue higher above the $1,850 level and started a downside correction. ETH corrected lower below $1,800, but the bulls remained active near $1,750.\n\nA low was formed near $1,741 and the price is now making a fresh attempt to gain pace, like Bitcoin. There was a move above the $1,780 level. The price tested the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1,866 swing high to the $1,741 low.\n\nEthereum is now trading above $1,770 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is also a key contracting triangle forming with support near $1,780 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.\n\nOn the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $1,800 level. The first major resistance is near the $1,815 zone. It is near the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1,866 swing high to the $1,741 low.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nA close above the $1,815 resistance could start a decent increase. In the stated case, Ether could revisit the $1,850 resistance. The next key resistance is near $1,865, above which the price could accelerate higher. In the stated case, the price could rise toward the $1,920 level. The main hurdle sits at $2,000.\n\nAnother Decline in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $1,815 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,780 level, the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average, and the trend line.\n\nThe next key support is $1,740. A downside break below the $1,740 support might send the price further lower. In the stated case, Ether could drop toward the $1,700 level.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bullish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $1,720\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $1,815\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nGlobal investment manager VanEck has made a bold prediction about Solana, suggesting that the SOL token may reach a staggering price of $3,211 by 2030, potentially surpassing the returns of the more established Ethereum.\n\nDespite SOL falling steeply following the FTX debacle, Solana, a high-performance blockchain known for its scalability and speed, has been gaining significant attention in the world of cryptocurrency and decentralized applications.\n\nIn their report, VanEck outlined the factors that led to their bullish prediction for SOL in the next decade. They presented a range of scenarios, with the most conservative estimate being $9.81 and the most optimistic projection reaching a remarkable $3,211.28, depicting a 10,000% surge in price.\n\nOne of the most compelling aspects of VanEck\u2019s prediction is their belief that Solana could become the first blockchain to host an application that onboards over 100 million users. As per the firm, this achievement would be a significant milestone in the blockchain industry and a game-changer for SOL\u2019s adoption and value.\n\nNotably, the report assumed that Solana will monetize at only 20% of Ethereum\u2019s take rate, indicating that even a relatively modest market share could result in substantial returns for SOL token holders.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFurthermore, the firm suggested that Solana might achieve less than half of Ethereum\u2019s market share due to fundamental differences in community philosophy. This perspective highlights that while Ethereum emphasizes decentralization and community governance, Solana has taken a more pragmatic approach to scalability and speed, which could attract a different set of users and developers.\n\nVanEck\u2019s optimistic outlook is based on its vision of a credible path to $8 billion in revenues for SOL token holders by 2030. If this prediction materializes, it would not only be a significant achievement for Solana but also a testament to the growth and potential of the broader blockchain ecosystem.\n\nThe cryptocurrency market has been characterized by its volatility and rapid changes, making long-term predictions a challenging endeavour. However, VanEck has positioned itself to take on the crypto market with safer vehicles.\n\nLast Friday, the New York-based firm submitted a revised application for the highly-anticipated Bitcoin Spot ETF, aligning itself with industry leaders such as BlackRock, Ark Invest, and Fidelity, all eager to capitalize on the promising future of the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency.\n\nAt press time, SOL was trading at $34.65, marking an impressive 6.8% gain in the last 24 hours, possibly spurred by the recent report. Notably, the cryptocurrency has been the top performer among the top 20 coins in the past week, with a substantial 19% increase, according to CoinMarketCap data."

        "content": "Dogecoin, Ethereum, and Everlodge are amongst the more interesting altcoins to watch in the ongoing crypto rally.\n\nAlbeit different, all of these projects are attempting to position themselves the best they can for what seems to be a much-anticipated bull market.\n\nSummary:\n\nDogecoin\u2019s price pumps 5.2%.\n\nAli Martinez predicts Ethereum to reach $1,900.\n\nEverlodge\u2019s price has increased from $0.02 to $0.023.\n\nVisit the Everlodge presale and win a luxury holiday to the Maldives\n\nDogecoin (DOGE) Aiming To Surpass the $0.07 Level\n\nDogecoin, the original meme coin has been popular ever since its launch back in 2021. Dogecoin quickly climbed up the ranks after being promoted by top figures like Elon Musk. The meme coin hit an all-time high of $0.7376 in May 2021 before plummeting to the $0.06 level in October 2023.\n\nDespite this significant price drop, Dogecoin still remains a top ten largest crypto ranked by market capitalization. As of the time of this writing, the price of Dogecoin recently jumped by 7.7% to reach $0.069.\n\nAlso, there was an increase in DOGE\u2019s trading volume, highlighting increasing support for the meme coin. As a result, some analysts have predicted that the Dogecoin price could aim for the $0.07 mark and potentially surpass it in the coming days.\n\nEthereum (ETH) To Reach $1,900\n\nOn October 20th, crypto analyst, Ali Martinez, told his Twitter followers that Ethereum is heading for the $1,900 level. According to the analysts, ETH has formed an ascending triangle pattern, which is a bullish formation.\n\nAli said Ethereum is \u201cready\u201d to bounce off the ascending triangle\u2019s hypotenuse. Moreover, the analyst emphasized that the Ethereum coin must close above the 18-day SMA (around $1,745) to reach $1,900. As of October 30th, the price of Ethereum has increased by 8.1% in the past week to hit $1,818.\n\nEthereum\u2019s price has shown great recovery together with the rest of the crypto market. Meanwhile, the last time Ethereum reached $1,900 was in July 2023.\n\nEverlodge (ELDG) Captures Whale Attention With Unique Features\n\nJust like Dogecoin and Ethereum, investors in the Everlodge presale are sweeping tokens. Everlodge is working on a blockchain real estate marketplace. It will allow more people to invest in vacation homes, hotels, and fancy villas.\n\nWhat makes Everlodge unique over traditional platforms is its NFT fractionalization approach to property co-ownership.

        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction: ETH Rockets Up 8% \u2013 $2,000 ETH Incoming?\n\nThe Ethereum price has risen to $1,815 today, gaining by 1.5% in 24 hours and 8.5% in the past week amid rising investor positivity.\n\nETH has also risen by 14.5% in the past fortnight, while the altcoin is up by 51% since the beginning of the year.\n\nThis makes it one of the best-performing major tokens since January, and with its fundamentals and momentum remaining strong, it could easily see additional gains in the coming days and weeks.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction: ETH Rockets Up 8% \u2013 $2,000 ETH Incoming?\n\n\n\nEthereum\u2019s indicators continue to look very strong, with both its relative strength index (purple) and 30-day moving average (yellow) signalling further rises.\n\nIts RSI has risen back above 70 after dipping a little a few days, implying that buying pressure remains very much with the coin.\n\nLikewise, ETH\u2019s 30-day average is climbing strongly towards its 200-day average (blue), with conventional wisdom suggesting that the current rally won\u2019t peak until the shorter term average is noticeably higher.\n\nThe coin\u2019s support level (green) also points to additional rises, while this indicator also suggests that ETH won\u2019t fall back down to its pre-rally level if it corrects in the near future.\n\nETH continues to be strong as a result of investor positivity regarding Bitcoin ETFs, with the SEC looking increasingly like it will approve a number of recent applications at the start of the next year.\n\nSuch positivity has fed into the rest of the market, with ETH recovering in the past week or so after investors spent a couple of months overselling it.\n\nFundametals\n\n\n\nThe coin\u2019s fundamentals weighed heavily against the selling it witnessed, yet now it has moved into a position where it\u2019s ready to make up for lost ground.\n\nAnd it should rally more than pretty much any over alt if and when the Bitcoin ETFs are approved, and for various reasons.\n\nFor one, the approval of Bitcoin ETFs opens the door to the approval of Ethereum ETFs, with institutions interested in ETH more than any other altcoin.\n\nSecondly, Ethereum continues to be the biggest layer-one blockchain network by some distance, with its total value locked in accounting for roughly 55% of the entire DeFi sector.\n\nThis percentage doesn\u2019t include Ethereum-based layer-two networks, which would bump its total to around 63%.\n\nOn top of this, Ethereum has also attracted the highest-profile adoption in recent months.\n\nThis includes Visa\u2019s stablecoin trials, as well as PayPal\u2019s Ethereum-based stablecoin, and not to mention Coinbase\u2019s own layer-two network.\n\nGiven such ongoing interest, the Ethereum price is likely to reach $2,000 in the next few weeks.\n\nFrom there, it could end 2023 at around $2,500.\n\nOther Altcoins With Strong Potential\n\n\n\nWhile ETH looks set to continue rising, it isn\u2019t the only high-potential altcoin in the market right now.\n\nA number of presale tokens also look very promising, with some of these likely to witness big rallies when they list on exchanges in the coming weeks.\n\nPerhaps the favorite the rise the most is Bitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX), a tokenized cloud mining platform that has already raised over $2.7 million in its presale.\n\n#BitcoinMinetrix hits another major milestone!
