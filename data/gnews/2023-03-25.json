        "title": "Solana [SOL] outshines Ethereum [ETH] on this crucial parameter - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "Solana\u2019s Nakamoto Coefficient stood at 31 as compared to Ethereum\u2019s 1.\n\nSolana was well-distributed across geographies with no country controlling 33% of the active stake.\n\nThe Solana [SOL] Foundation published its latest Validator Health Report wherein it disclosed vital stats like the number of validator nodes and their distribution across the network.\n\nAccording to the report, the network boasted more than 3,400 nodes out of which over 2,400 were nodes that participated in validating transactions on the chain, also called consensus nodes.\n\n1/ The March 2023 Validator Health Report is out. Today, @Solana is one of the largest proof of stake networks in the world by node count, and one of the most distributed by Nakamoto Coefficient. https://t.co/NlxHZqHnV5 pic.twitter.com/1AcDtQK7p2 \u2014 Solana Foundation (@SolanaFndn) March 23, 2023\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Solana Profit Calculator\n\nSolana scores over Ethereum?\n\nThe Nakamoto Coefficient, created by former Coinbase CTO Balaji Srinivasan, is a widely-used measure of the decentralization of a blockchain.\n\nThe Nakamoto coefficient measures decentralization and represents the minimum number of nodes required to disrupt the blockchain\u2019s network.\n\nA higher Nakamoto Coefficient indicates that the network has a large number of nodes and is thus more decentralized and safe.\n\nOne of the major takeaways of the report was the reading of the Nakamoto Coefficient. For the Solana chain, it stood at 31 as compared to just 1 for the biggest proof-of-stake network, Ethereum [ETH].\n\nA look at Ethereum\u2019s validator distribution will most likely sum this up. More than 44% of the staked ETH was held by just four participants.\n\nFurthermore, the report highlighted that Solana was well-distributed across geographies with no country controlling 33% of the active stake. However, in the case of Ethereum, more than 45% of the nodes were concentrated in only one country, the U.S.\n\nSolana\u2019s safety precautions\n\nA bug in a validator client has the potential to shut an entire network down if there\u2019s no backup. Solana stated that it had two validator clients at its disposal to help during exigencies. A third client was under development.\n\nIt should be noted that the network was hit by a major outage on 25 February, which lasted for nearly 20 hours. Tech disruptions for Solana aren\u2019t a new phenomenon. It was hit by several network glitches in 2022 as well.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s SOL market cap in BTC\u2019s terms\n\nIt was clear that Solana was focusing on network enhancements as indicated by the increasing development activity. The investors\u2019 sentiment stayed in the positive terrain as well, which in part was fueled by improving market conditions.\n\nThe transaction volume for SOL declined by over 50% since hitting $1.14 billion on 20 March. Consequently, the price fell by more than 8% until press time, per CoinMarketCap data."

        "title": "Bitcoin and Ethereum Prices Are Heading to these Levels Next Week! Here\u2019s What Traders can Expect - Coinpedia Fintech News",
        "content": "Shayan is a digital nomad and a professional journalist. He delivers high-quality engaging articles to Coinpedia through his in-depth research and analysis.\n\nThe crypto market is buzzing with excitement as Bitcoin and Ethereum, two of the most popular cryptocurrencies, appear to be poised for significant price momentum in the coming week. As we approach the end of the month, traders are eagerly anticipating a continuation of the recent upward trend in the cryptocurrency market. Over the last few weeks, these two leading cryptos showed massive gains, and investors are now waiting for an extended bullish rally to maximize their gain.\n\nVolatility is Waiting for BTC And ETH Prices\n\nAmid high banking crisis and crypto market\u2019s regulatory concerns, Bitcoin and Ethereum prices are not slowing down to reach new highs. Despite overall bearish market sentiments, investors are still betting on long-term gains on BTC and ETH as there is an astronomical spike in trading volume and buying pressure, creating possibilities of a new bull run next week.\n\nBTC Price Analysis\n\nBitcoin reached a new nine-month high by surging past $29,000 recently, but the celebration was short-lived as the asset experienced a sharp retracement in the hours that followed. Following a loss of $28,000 the previous day, weekend trading remained relatively stable as traders awaited a break before the resumption of traditional finance markets, resulting in a lack of usual volatility.\n\nBitcoin price is currently showing an inside-day candlestick pattern, signifying a state of FUD among buyers and sellers. Although the bulls aim to extend the up-move, the bears remain firm and unwilling to give in, leading to the price remaining within a narrow range.\n\nAs of writing, BTC price trades at $27.5K, with a decline of 2% in the last 24 hours. The weekly price chart indicates Bitcoin price will likely consolidate below $30K for the next few days. However, a breakout above $30K is expected next week, and the BTC will head toward the crucial resistance of $34K-$38K.\n\nETH Price Analysis\n\nOut of all the altcoins in the cryptocurrency space, Ethereum\u2019s price closely mirrors the performance trend of Bitcoin. Multiple successful breaches of the $1,800 level have been achieved by the digital asset, resulting in increased profits and attracting more investors.\n\nEther breached the overhead resistance of $1,800, but the bulls could not maintain the breakout, as evidenced by the long wick on the candlestick.\n\nThe bears are currently attempting to reinforce their position by pushing the price towards the 20-day EMA ($1,698), which is a crucial level to monitor for potential downsides. ETH price is currently trading at $1,753, declining by 1% from yesterday.\n\nThe weekly price chart indicates a minor downward correction for ETH price next week, as the altcoin may drop below the EMA-50 trend line and reach the bottom levels of $1,500 before sparking fresh surges."

        "title": "Analyst Predicts Ethereum Rival Will Explode by Over 90%, Updates Outlook on XRP, Cardano and Solana - The Daily Hodl",
        "content": "A top crypto analyst is mapping the path forward for four crypto assets that have witnessed bullish price action in the last seven days.\n\nIn a new strategy session, pseudonymous analyst Cred tells his 49,200 YouTube subscribers that XRP could witness bullish continuation as long as it is above the previous resistance at $0.414.\n\n\u201cIf this breakout sticks and XRP does its sort of trend wiping candles where it just moons and sort of retraces weeks and weeks and weeks of selling in a much smaller number of weeks, if that is the case, I think the bigger magnet if you will, or the clearer level for price is about $0.50 to $0.60.\u201d\n\nXRP, which is up by nearly 10% in the past week, is trading at $0.425 at time of writing.\n\nNext up is smart contract protocol Cardano (ADA). Cred says the seventh largest crypto asset by market cap is \u201crespecting technicals\u201d and could revisit its 2023 high of $0.42, which it hit in February.\n\n\u201cI think as long as you\u2019re not getting daily acceptance below sort of $0.35 and this more recent flip level [of around $0.35]\u2026 I think if this reclaims sticks, the next high timeframe trouble area is this big support resistance flip range high thing at around $0.41.That makes sense to me.\n\nAnd then if that breaks, we can just carve out a range of this thing with $0.40, $0.60-ish and $0.50 is the mid. But I think in the short term, we have pretty clear trading levels between $0.35 and $0.42-ish\u201d\n\nCardano is trading at $0.361 at time of writing.\n\nTurning to Solana (SOL), the pseudonymous analyst says that the 12th-largest crypto by market cap is forming a double bottom pattern after managing to hold support at $20 According to Cred, Solana is still range bound with support at $20, range midpoint at $23 and resistance at $26.\n\n\u201cWe essentially have a double bottom forming just above a high timeframe level of support [at $20]\u2026\n\nSort of range low reclaim as long as you don\u2019t get daily closes back below $20 \u2013 $21. That looks like it\u2019s trading back within the range.\n\nWhen markets do that, we like to look at the mid and the other side of the range, which I think for this [Solana daily timeframe] chart would be something akin to $22 is the range midpoint, $24-ish is the range high.\n\nYou could be a bit more charitable and use something closer to the extremities, the sort of same range local at around $20 and then the $26 range high, giving you a $23, $24 mid.\u201d\n\nSolana is worth $20.89 at time of writing.\n\nThe last coin on the trader\u2019s radar is Ethereum (ETH) rival Fantom (FTM). According to Cred, FTM looks bullish provided it stays above its previous resistance at $0.43.\n\n\u201cAs long as that\u2019s the case, then you\u2019d expect the high [around $0.65] to be traded and then the next big trouble area, if we get a really meaty rotation, is the former range high at like $0.70 to $0.90.\u201d\n\nFantom is trading at $0.46 at time of writing. A move toward the upper bounds of the analyst\u2019s target suggests a rally of over 90% for the Ethereum competitor.\n\nI\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "The cryptocurrency market is constantly evolving, and 2023 is shaping up to be a year of significant developments.\n\nEthereum (ETH), Polygon (MATIC), and RenQ Finance (RENQ) are three cryptocurrencies that have been making waves recently. In this article, we will take a closer look at these projects and what they have in store for investors in 2023.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Shanghai upgrade is almost ready\n\nEthereum is a blockchain platform that allows developers to create decentralized applications. The platform has been around since 2015 and has grown to become the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. However, one of the biggest issues with Ethereum has been its slow transaction times and high gas fees.\n\nThe upcoming hard fork for the Ethereum blockchain, known as the Shanghai upgrade, is set to be launched in March of 2023. In 2022, a test net called Shandong was conducted in preparation for the launch.\n\nThe Shanghai upgrade aims to address these issues by making Ethereum more efficient and scalable. The upgrade will introduce several new features, including a new consensus algorithm called Proof of Stake (PoS) and sharding. These changes will help Ethereum process more transactions and reduce gas fees, making it more accessible to a wider audience.\n\nThe Shanghai upgrade includes multiple improvements, but one of the most significant is the ability for Ethereum stakers to withdraw both their staked ETH and earned rewards. This has been a highly desired feature among Ethereum users and the wider cryptocurrency community, and it is outlined in the EIP-4895 proposal.\n\nPolygon (MATIC) making big strides in the metaverse\n\nPolygon is a layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum that allows for faster and cheaper transactions. It is a platform for building decentralized applications and has been gaining popularity in the metaverse. Polygon\u2019s infrastructure enables seamless interoperability between different blockchain networks, making it an attractive option for developers looking to create cross-chain applications.\n\nPolygon has made significant strides in the metaverse space, with several high-profile projects already using its infrastructure. One example is the virtual world Decentraland, which has integrated Polygon for faster and cheaper transactions. This partnership has helped Decentraland attract more users and increased its popularity.\n\nRenQ Finance (RENQ) crosses the $3M milestone with ease\n\nRenQ Finance is a decentralized exchange that operates on multiple chains and offers non-custodial trading directly through its wallet app. Its goal is to establish a cross-chain network that enables the seamless and affordable exchange of assets between previously isolated blockchains.\n\nRenQ has been making waves in the cryptocurrency market with its impressive ongoing presale stages. In just three stages, RenQ has raised over $3 million, showing the high demand for its unique approach to interoperability and scalability.\n\nRenQ\u2019s user-friendly DeFi platform and verified security, fast and secure network, and limited token supply make it an attractive investment option for both short-term and long-term investors.\n\nAs always, investors should conduct thorough research and exercise caution before investing in any cryptocurrency.\n\nSummary\n\nThe cryptocurrency market is always changing, and Ethereum, Polygon, and RenQ Finance are three projects to watch out for in 2023.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Shanghai upgrade aims to make the platform more efficient and scalable, while Polygon is making significant strides in the metaverse space. RenQ Finance\u2019s unique approach to interoperability and scalability makes it an attractive investment option for both short-term and long-term investors.\n\nIn conclusion, it is important to do your research and understand the risks involved before making any investment decisions.\n\nClick Here to Buy RenQ Finance (RENQ) Tokens.\n\nVisit the links below for more information about RenQ Finance (RENQ):\n\nWebsite: https://renq.io\n\nWhitepaper: https://renq.io/whitepaper.pdf\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Will Bitcoin (BTC) reach new ATH in 2023? Here's why Ethereum (ETH) and RenQ Finance (RENQ) will follow the suit - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "Bitcoin, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency, has had an unprecedented year in 2021. From its low of around $4,000 in March 2020, Bitcoin reached its all-time high (ATH) of over $69,000 in November 2021.\n\nHowever, since then, Bitcoin\u2019s price has been fluctuating, and it has failed to reach a new ATH. This has left many investors wondering if Bitcoin will ever reach new ATH in 2023.\n\nIn this article, we will explore the factors that may contribute to Bitcoin reaching new ATH in 2023 and how Ethereum and RenQ Finance may follow the suit.\n\nThe Bitcoin Market Cap\n\nThe first factor that may contribute to Bitcoin reaching a new ATH in 2023 is the Bitcoin market cap. As of writing, Bitcoin holds the top position in the cryptocurrency market capitalization rankings, with a value of more than $534 billion.\n\nWhile this may seem like a lot, it\u2019s important to note that the total market cap of all cryptocurrencies is around $1.16 trillion according to coinmarketcap. This means that Bitcoin accounts for less than half of the total cryptocurrency market cap.\n\nWith the increasing adoption of cryptocurrencies by institutional investors and corporations, we may see a significant increase in the Bitcoin market cap. This increase in the market cap may push Bitcoin\u2019s price to a new ATH in 2023.\n\nInstitutional Adoption\n\nThe second factor that may contribute to Bitcoin reaching new ATH in 2023 is institutional adoption. Over the past year, we have seen a significant increase in institutional adoption of Bitcoin.\n\nCompanies like MicroStrategy, Tesla, and Square have all invested billions of dollars in Bitcoin. In addition, we have seen the launch of Bitcoin futures on major exchanges like CME Group and the launch of Bitcoin ETFs in Canada.\n\nWith more institutions investing in Bitcoin, we may see a significant increase in demand for Bitcoin, which may push its price to a new ATH in 2023.\n\nEthereum and RenQ Finance\n\nWhile Bitcoin may be the focus of many investors, it\u2019s important to note that other cryptocurrencies may follow the suit. Ethereum and RenQ Finance are two cryptocurrencies that may see significant growth in the coming years.\n\nEthereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, and it\u2019s often referred to as the \u201cworld computer.\u201d Ethereum is the backbone of the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem and is used to build decentralized applications (dApps). Ethereum\u2019s value proposition is that it can do everything that Bitcoin can do, but it can also execute smart contracts. With the increasing adoption of DeFi and the launch of Ethereum 2.0, we may see a significant increase in the demand for Ethereum, which may push its price to a new ATH in 2023.\n\nRenQ Finance is a relatively new cryptocurrency that has gained significant attention in the crypto space. RenQ Finance is a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform built on the Ethereum blockchain. It aims to provide a one-stop solution for all kinds of traders under one platform in the DeFi world. RenQ Finance aims to connect all isolated blockchains and establish a cross-chain asset exchange network, providing all necessary underlying support for the DeFi ecosystem. With the increasing adoption of DeFi and the unique value proposition of RenQ Finance, we may see a significant increase in the demand for RenQ Finance, which may push its price to a new ATH in 2023.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, while Bitcoin may be the focus of many investors, it\u2019s important to note that other cryptocurrencies may follow the suit.\n\nEthereum and RenQ Finance are among the cryptocurrencies that show potential for significant growth in the coming years. As more institutional investors and corporations adopt cryptocurrencies, there is a possibility of a significant increase in their value.\n\nRenQ Finance, in particular, has been gaining attention from investors as experts predict 100x gains soon, making it an attractive option for those looking to boost their investment portfolio.\n\nClick Here to Buy RenQ Finance (RENQ) Tokens.\n\nVisit the links below for more information about RenQ Finance (RENQ):\n\nWebsite: https://renq.io\n\nWhitepaper: https://renq.io/whitepaper.pdf\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"
