        "content": "While many investors appreciated these services, the SEC did not. Its public complaint states, \u201cKraken has offered and sold its crypto asset \u2018staking services\u2019 to the general public, whereby Kraken pools certain crypto assets transferred by investors and stakes them on behalf of those investors. Staking is a process in which investors lock up \u2013 or \u2018stake\u2019 \u2013 their crypto tokens with a blockchain validator with the goal of being rewarded with new tokens when their staked crypto tokens become part of the process for validating data for the blockchain. When investors provide tokens to staking-as-a-service providers, they lose control of those tokens and take on risks associated with those platforms, with very little protection.\u201d"

        "title": "Coinbase Is Building Its Own Ethereum Layer-2 Network Called 'Base' - Decrypt",
        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nCoinbase has today unveiled Base, its own Ethereum layer-2 network. The company says Base will be the new home for the Coinbase\u2019s on-chain products and\u2014it hopes\u2014an open ecosystem for millions of new decentralized apps.\n\nThough only publicly announced today, a testnet for Base has actually been live since the start of the month, Coinbase Senior Director of Engineering Jesse Pollak told Decrypt.\n\n\u201cThis is a bet that we can help enable the next million dapps, which are going to bring in the next billion users. We think that's going to happen on a five- to 10-year horizon and this is our contribution to making that happen sooner rather than later,\u201d he said. \u201cOur goal is to launch mainnet in the next few months.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThat makes Coinbase, which has traded on Nasdaq under the COIN ticker since April 2021, the first publicly traded company to launch a layer-2 blockchain network on top of Ethereum. On Wednesday, COIN ended the day trading at $61.18 per share, down 1% for the day, after trading as high as $67.17 in the wake of beating analyst predictions on its Q4 earnings.\n\nLayer-2 networks help make transactions faster and cheaper than an underlying blockchain, in this case Ethereum, by processing batches of transactions on a separate chain and then sending receipts back to the mainnet. Base will be \u201ca rollup agnostic superchain powered by Optimism,\u201d according to a blog post that Coinbase shared with Decrypt ahead of its Thursday announcement.\n\nBase is entering a crowded and rapidly growing cohort. As of Wednesday evening, there was more than $6 billion worth of ETH on layer 2s, a 17% increase from a month ago, according to L2Beat.\n\nThe website tracks 26 different Ethereum scaling networks, including Arbitrum One and Optimism. Those two networks alone account for 53% and 31% of L2 market share, respectively. But unlike those L2s, Base will not be launching a network token. On other networks, tokens help pay for gas fees and are used to incentivize development.\n\n\u201cWe've seen a lot of people kind of use tokens to drive activity. But our thesis is that tokens are not the only way to drive activity,\u201d Pollak said. \u201cBuilding great products is a great way of driving activity by making things actually useful.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt's worth noting, however, that both Optimism and Arbitrum initially launched their networks without a token either. Optimism has since airdropped its OP governance token to early adopters of its network and Arbitrum has long been rumored to be planning the same.\n\nBase is launching with dozens of partners who\u2019ve committed to building in and supporting the ecosystem, including oracle network Chainlink, Ethereum block explorer Etherscan, and DeFi protocol Aave.\n\nCoinbase said it intends for the governance of Base to be fully decentralized, although it won\u2019t be that way at the start.\n\n\u201cCoinbase is going to gradually transition into a role where we\u2019re a contributor to Base, we provide services and products that are built on top of Base, and we are not the decision maker for everything in the Base network\u2014that\u2019s being done through more decentralized governance,\u201d Pollak said.\n\nTo that end, Coinbase will be joining Optimism as a core developer on the open-source OP Stack. Pollak heads up the small Coinbase team dedicated to working on Base.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to keep the core team really lean and lean into this reality that we can have an outsized impact if we\u2019re building onchain,\u201d he said."

        "title": "Only 0.04% of Ethereum validators have been slashed since 2020, says core dev - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The Ethereum ecosystem has seen only 226 validators slashed since the launch of the Beacon Chain on Dec. 1, 2020 \u2014 amounting to just 0.04% of 524,060 validators, according to an Ethereum core developer.\n\nSlashing is a process where a validator breaches the proof-of-stake consensus rules, which often results in the removal of that validator from the network and slashing a portion of the staked Ether (ETH) that the validator provided as collateral.\n\nSuch slim odds of being slashed were highlighted by Ethereum core developer \u201cSuperphiz\u201d in a Feb. 23 Twitter post, which suggests that people shouldn\u2019t be concerned about staking ETH for that particular reason.\n\n226 out of 523,000 validators on the beacon chain have been slashed. This is nothing to lose sleep over. Many slashings have occurred during failed system migration. Here are four emerging best practice tips to avoid this:https://t.co/wleR4YQmDD \u2014 superphiz.eth (@superphiz) February 22, 2023\n\nThe developer also explained \u201cfour emerging best practices\u201d to reduce those odds even further.\n\nOne of these practices was to wipe any existing chain data on old staking machines and to reinstall and reformat the validator where necessary, said Superphiz, noting that many slashings occur due to \u201cfailed systems migrations.\u201d\n\nSuperphiz then suggested using \u201cdoppelganger detection,\u201d which checks whether the validator\u2019s keys are active before starting the validation process.\n\nWhile this can impact validator uptime, he explained that \u201cperfect uptime\u201d isn\u2019t worth getting slashed in the grand scheme of things:\n\n\u201cIt's wise to throw away $0.06 to save $1700. (A slashing costs about 1 Ether).\u201d\n\nThe developer said it is also worth watching buffers and logs on the Beacon Chain to become aware of any potential problems that may arise.\n\nLog of the slashed validators on the Beacon Chain. Source: Beaconcha.in\n\nIf something feels wrong, Superphiz suggested \u201cunplugging everything\u201d and to \u201ccome back\u201d when the problem has been identified and a proposed solution is set in place.\n\nThe developer also noted that over 150 of the 226 slashings have been caused by services rather than \u201chome stakers.\u201d\n\nStaked ETH and number of active validators on the Beacon Chain. Source: Beaconcha.in\n\nSlashing can occur due to an \u201cattestation\u201d or a \u201cproposal\u201d violation, according to the Ethereum Foundation.\n\nAn attestation violation is one where a malicious validator attempts to change the history of a block or \u201cdouble votes\u201d by attesting two candidates for the same block.\n\nA proposal violation occurs when a validator proposes and signs two different blocks for the same slot.\n\nThe majority of slashing events have come from attestation violations, according to data from beaconcha.in.\n\nOne of the largest slashing events occurred on Feb. 4, 2021, when staking infrastructure provider \u201cStaked\u201d had 75 of its validators slashed for producing competing blocks. Staked said the attestation violation came about due to a \u201ctechnical issue.\u201d\n\nRelated: What are the risks of the Ethereum Merge?\n\nSince the Beacon Chain merged with the Ethereum proof-of-work chain on Sept. 15, only 35 of the total 226 slashings have taken place, according to beaconcha.in, which suggests that the Merge has not had a profound impact on slashing rates.\n\nWith about 16.7 million ETH staked (according to beaconcha.in) out of 120.4 million ETH currently in circulation (according to CoinGecko), the percentage of ETH staked is about 13.9%.\n\nETH can be staked via a centralized exchange, by delegation to a third-party validator network, or by running on an independent node, which requires 32 ETH."
