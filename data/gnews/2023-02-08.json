        "summary": "  Bitcoin developer Casey Rodarmor has launched a new protocol called Bitcoin Ordinals, which assigns unique identities to individual satoshis on the Bitcoin blockchain. This system allows users to track and transfer these uniquely-identified satoshis like any normal bitcoin unit, but with the added functionality of being entirely on-chain. The Ordinal protocol consists of two main parts: Ordinal theory, which assigns a unique identifier value to each satoshi based on periodic events on the Bitcoin blockchain, and inscription, which associates content with a satoshi using a numbering scheme unique to the Ord software. This innovation has already gained traction, with existing Ethereum-based NFT creators expressing interest in launching their collections on the Bitcoin blockchain. The true impact of Ordinals is still emerging, but it has the potential to combat lost NFTs and open up new revenue streams for NFT creators."

        "summary": "  Optimism is an Ethereum scaling solution that aims to improve the mainnet's scalability by taking some of its transactional load. It uses an \"Optimistic Rollup\" mechanism, which runs the computation off-chain and only submits proof of validity to the chain. The Optimism Collective, a group of companies, communities, and citizens, governs the project, with two houses: the Token House and the Citizens' House. The OP token is the native cryptocurrency of the Optimism ecosystem and is used for governance. The project has distributed 5% of its total supply through an airdrop and plans to allocate 19% more for future airdrops. The team has proposed upgrading the Optimism mainnet to Bedrock, a new generation of decentralized Rollup architecture developed by Optimism Labs."

Ethereum is experiencing its fourth consecutive week of deflationary issuance, with the number of tokens being burnt greater than the number of tokens being minted. This suggests that the token is limited in supply compared to demand, giving it greater purchasing power. Growing activity on decentralized platforms such as Uniswap could indicate more people turning to DeFi after the collapse of centralized competitors last year. Ethereum gas fees are at their highest levels since July, with Uniswap accounting for the majority of gas guzzling activity. This is seen as a positive sign for the broader crypto ecosystem."
