        "content": "The percentage of tokens that have moved in the past year has fallen to record lows for both bitcoin and ether, according to data from The Block.\n\nAt its peak, over 59% of bitcoin's supply was active between March 2017 and 2018. However, in the past year, only 30.12% of bitcoin's supply has changed hands. Ether, which saw over 86% of its supply move between July 2016 and 2017, also hit a record low, with only 39.15% of its supply changing hands in the past year.\n\nFor bitcoin, the record low active supply comes ahead of the anticipated halving of block emission rewards, currently projected to occur in April of next year. The percentage of tokens that haven't been touched for three and five years are also at record lows, according to The Block's data.\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nOnly 58.58% of the supply of bitcoin has changed hands in the past three years, compared to over 73% at its peak in late 2019, whereas the five-year active supply has fallen from a maximum of 83% to 70.13%. However, while the supply of inactive coins is higher than ever, transactions on the network are also near their peak."

        "content": "Crypto whales sold off millions of dollars worth of yearn.finance on Saturday prior to YFI sharply correcting by over 40%, according to on-chain data.\n\nSpotted by blockchain-tracking firm Lookonchain, one wallet deposited the better part of $5.8 million worth of YFI to crypto exchanges, likely to be sold off on the open market.\n\n\u201cWhy did YFI suddenly plummet more than 40%?\n\nWallet \u20180x48f9\u2019 transferred 446 YFI ($5.8 million) out, most of which was deposited to exchanges\u2026\n\nAnd a whale was very lucky and sold 96 YFI for 636 ETH ($1.23 million) at a price of $12,893 before YFI plummeted.\u201d\n\nBased on Lookonchain\u2019s chart, YFI dropped to a low of $8,971 as the whales unloaded their holdings. The native asset of the yield-farming protocol has since bounced and is trading for $9,408 at time of writing, up over 2% in the last 24 hours.\n\nLookonchain also spotted a wallet associated with the investment fund behind the decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregator 1inch (1INCH) selling the recent rallies in Uniswap to offload its UNI tokens for $2.13 million.\n\nAccording to Lookonchain, the 1Inch Investment Fund sold its UNI tokens at a loss,\n\n\u201cThe 1inch Team Investment Fund wallet sold all 416,924 UNI for 2.13 million USDC at a price of $5.11\u2026\n\n1inch spent 2 million USDC to buy 299,849 UNI at $6.67 on Feb 10, then provided liquidity on Uniswap.\n\nIt seems 1inch dumped all UNI at a loss!\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, UNI is trading for $5.09, nearly the same price as when the 1inch Investment Fund sold its holdings.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Share:\n\nEthereum price consolidates on the weekly chart inside an ascending triangle.\n\nA successful breakout from this setup forecasts a 43% upswing to $2,943.\n\nBut ETH could rally ahead and tag the MRI\u2019s resistance level of $3,186.\n\nEthereum (ETH) price shows a tightening of the multi-month consolidation. A breakout from this sideways movement could trigger a volatile move to the upside.\n\nAlso read: Ethereum is a commodity, but SEC will not admit it, expert says amid ongoing ETF race\n\nEthereum price edges closer to breakout\n\nEthereum price has set up three higher lows and three roughly equal highs since June 2022. Connecting these swing points using trend lines, reveals an ascending triangle setup. A decisive weekly candlestick close above the triangle\u2019s horizontal resistance level at $2,000 will signal a breakout.\n\nIn such a case, this technical formation forecasts a 43% rally to $2,943, obtained by measuring the distance between the first swing high and swing low to the breakout point of $2,000.\n\nCurrently, Ethereum price sits above the Momentum Reversal Indicator\u2019s (MRI) resistance level of $1,936 and below the ascending triangle\u2019s horizontal resistance level. From the looks of it, ETH seems to have flipped the $1,936 hurdle into a support floor.\n\nIf Bitcoin price does not crash wildly in the upcoming weeks, Ethereum price is set to break out and kickstart an upswing to $2,943. But this move is likely to face resistance around the $2,539 hurdle, which served as a critical support level in March 2022.\n\nWhile $2,943 is the theoretical target, ETH could rise higher and tag the next MRI resistance level of $3,186. This move would constitute a 60% gain.\n\nAlso read: Top 3 Price Prediction Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple: BTC unfazed as the SEC engages exchanges for spot ETFs\n\nETH/USDT 1-week chart\n\nOn the other hand, if Ethereum price fails to stay above the $1,936 support level, it could trigger a correction down to the $1,795 support floor, where buyers could give the breakout another go.\n\nBut if this attempt fails and Ethereum price produces a weekly candlestick close below $1,547, it will create a lower low and invalidate the bullish thesis. In such a case, ETH could slide as low as $1,309.\n\nAlso read: BlackRock\u2019s spot Ethereum ETF filing fails to catalyze ETH price sustained rally"
