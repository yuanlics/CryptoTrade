        "title": "Ethereum price retreats amidst strategic whale moves - AMBCrypto English",
        "summary": "  Two large Ethereum whales have sold off a total of over 28,000 tokens in recent days, causing the price of ETH to retreat. This has led to a net outflow of ETH from exchanges, but there has been a reversal in the netflow as of writing. The whales' sales have been attributed to a strategic profit-taking move, rather than a market dump. The 60-day Market Value to Realized Value Ratio (MVRV) of Ethereum has also decreased, suggesting that the profit derived from the sales of ETH has experienced a substantial reduction. The Ethereum price has been weakening, with a 1.7% decrease in value and the RSI line approaching the point of crossing below the neutral line, suggesting a weakening of the initial bull run."
