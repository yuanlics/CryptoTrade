        "title": "Staked ETH hits 20M milestone, almost doubling in 1 year - Blockworks",
        "content": "Ethereum has reached another milestone, with over 23.5 million ETH deposited for staking.\n\nStaking is the process of locking up a cryptocurrency in a proof-of-stake blockchain to contribute to network security and earn rewards.\n\nSimilar to depositing cash into high-yield accounts at big banks, staking enables token holders to earn passive income on their assets without having to sell or trade them.\n\nThe more people who stake, the more secure the blockchain becomes.\n\nETH price is heavily dependent on its value against the US dollar. In November 2021, when the price of ETH reached an all-time high of $4,400, there had only been 8.2 million staked ETH \u2014 which is roughly $15 billion \u2014 locked in the network.\n\nCurrently, with ETH priced at $1,880, over $38 billion is being used to secure the network.\n\nAlthough validators have had the opportunity to stake ETH since the Ethereum Merge in September last year, staking didn\u2019t grow dramatically in popularity until the Shapella upgrade, which enabled withdrawals.\n\nThere has been a net inflow of 3.6 million staked ETH ($6.9 billion) following the Shanghai upgrade, showing that interest in the Ethereum blockchain has remained at an all-time high.\n\nThe total circulating supply of ether is currently at 120.2 million ETH, and staked ETH makes up roughly 19.4% of all the ether on-chain. That is equivalent to roughly 6.4% of bitcoin\u2019s market capitalization fully staked in Ethereum.\n\nIn fact, staked ETH is becoming so popular, that the raw number of ETH staked on the Ethereum blockchain is about to surpass the total amount of ether that is kept on all cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nThe growing interest in Ethereum staking is a positive sign for the network, and indicates that ETH holders are moving away from centralized entities and into more decentralized spaces.\n\nUpdated Jun. 25, 2023 at 5:01 pm ET: Corrected rate of change in headline.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "Ethereum Price Follows Bitcoin and $2,000 Seems Imminent - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Ethereum price is rallying above $1,850 against the US Dollar. ETH is clearly following Bitcoin\u2019s rally and might soon test the $2,000 resistance zone.\n\nEthereum is moving higher above the $1,850 and $1,880 resistance levels.\n\nThe price is trading above $1,850 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere is a key bullish trend line forming with support near $1,890 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair could rise further above the $1,930 and $1,950 resistance levels.\n\nEthereum Price Surges Over 6%\n\nEthereum\u2019s price started a steady increase above the $1,720 resistance zone. Recently, Bitcoin saw a major increase and helped ETH to clear the $1,850 resistance.\n\nThe price is up over 6% and there was a move above the $1,900 level. A high is formed near $1,930 and the price is now consolidating gains. It is trading well above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent rally from the $1,715 swing low to the $1,930 high.\n\nEther is also well above $1,850 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. Besides, there is a key bullish trend line forming with support near $1,890 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nImmediate resistance is near the $1,930 level. The next major resistance is near the $1,950 level. A successful move above the $1,930 and $1,950 resistance levels might send the price further higher. The next resistance sits near $2,000, above which Ethereum could rise toward the $2,050 level. Any more gains above the $2,050 resistance zone might send the price toward the $2,120 resistance.\n\nAre Dips Supported in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $1,950 resistance, it could start a downside correction. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,900 level.\n\nThe next major support is near the $1,880 level or the recent low. If there is a break and close below the $1,880 support, the price could drop toward the $1,820 support or the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent rally from the $1,715 swing low to the $1,930 high. Any more losses may perhaps send the price toward the $1,780 zone or the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bullish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is in the overbought zone.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $1,780\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $1,950\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "Ethereum Micropayments Solution Volition Aims to Make 'Crypto for Coffee Transactions Viable' - Decrypt",
        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nVolition, a new StarkWare product for the permissionless Starknet network, promises to drastically reduce Ethereum transaction fees, to the point where the network can support micropayments similar to Bitcoin's Lightning Network.\n\nSet to go live with Starknet v0.13.0 later this year, Volition will \"remove the big barrier to microtransactions,\u201d StarkWare CEO Uri Kolodny told Decrypt. \u201cIt will finally make the crypto for coffee transactions viable,\" he said, adding that, \"This will be very important for crypto adoption. It will have particular advantages in developing economies.\u201d\n\nEthereum fees, also known as gas fees, have been a concern for users of the Ethereum network for some time. Despite the network's recent major upgrades, the fees can still be often high, resulting in more challenges for users, particularly those who engage in frequent transactions or use decentralized applications (dapps).\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAs data from Bitinfocharts shows, Ethereum's average transaction fee, which measures the average fee when a transaction is processed and confirmed, was around $4.80 on June 22\u2014significantly lower than at this year\u2019s peak of more than $27 recorded just last month. But while that's considered reasonable for transactions involving larger amounts, it still represents a major roadblock to mainstream adoption of Ethereum.\n\nAside from the proverbial crypto for coffee, Volition's developers argue that it opens up a host of other use cases previously not possible in the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nThese include on-chain voting governance applications that would enable decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) to vote cheaply, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), or buying in-game assets.\n\n\u201cVolition will make on-chain voting so much more accessible by radically reducing its cost. People missing voting because of high fees\u2014currently common in blockchain\u2014will become a thing of the past,\u201d said Kolodny.\n\nFor on-chain gaming, the StarkWare CEO says the new scaling solution \u201csuddenly sets designers free to give a more immersive experience.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s because you want to offer players all sorts of different assets at different price-points, some of them very cheap,\" Kolodny told Decrypt. \"Today, a five cent asset incurs several dollars in fees; with Volition it becomes viable. Volition will set gaming free,\u201d he said.\n\nSeparating data availability\n\nOn a technical level, Starknet is a decentralized, permissionless Validity Rollup that operates as a Layer-2 network built on top of Ethereum. It provides an opportunity for any decentralized app (dapp) to significantly enhance its computational scalability without compromising the security features of the Ethereum network. By utilizing Starknet, dapps can achieve increased scale for their computations while leveraging the robustness and security provided by Ethereum's underlying infrastructure.\n\nHowever, with the introduction of Volition, developers gain the ability to optimize the transaction process by selecting the data availability mode for each individual storage variable. This is achieved by implementing Starknet's state as two separate storage commitment trees: one for Layer-1 data availability mode, which refers to data being available on the Ethereum mainnet, and one for Layer-2 data availability mode, indicating data availability on the Starknet Layer-2.\n\nData availability on a blockchain refers to the accessibility and persistence of the stored data. In a blockchain, data is typically organized into blocks, which are linked together using cryptographic hashes to form a chain. Each block contains a set of transactions or other types of data.\n\nVolition enables developers and users to choose the data availability mode for each contract. Image: StarkWare\n\nIn public networks, such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, all information is stored on every node, meaning that users end up paying for the burden this puts on every block forever as everything you do is saved forever whether you need it or not.\n\nVolition claims to give users the flexibility to store the data in a place where it\u2019s still very accessible, but is distributed less widely. In other words, it implies the option of saving cost by storing data on Layer-2 instead of Layer-1 in instances where high expenditure on data availability isn\u2019t merited economically.\n\nData availability matters because it allows users to calculate the state of the chain by themselves, enabling them to continue transacting with their assets even if other nodes in the system stop cooperating.\n\nAs explained by StarkWare, the default today is that users always pay for L-1 data availability\u2014which, in turn, bloats transaction fees for small-value transactions. That\u2019s why Volition pushing the data for these transactions to Layer-2 paves the way to micro-transactions: the functionality enables developers\u2014and eventually users\u2014to pick and choose exactly when they want to use cheaper or more expensive on-chain storage options.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nStarkWare claims that this could reduce gas fees by up to 90%.\n\nAccording to StarkWare, this is a feature the wider blockchain community has been talking about for some time. It all comes down to giving users a finer degree of control.\n\nFor example, developers can seek compromises by weighing their security and cost requirements on a case by case\u2014or even hour by hour\u2014basis, before deciding on the right data availability solution.\n\nAnother possible use case for Volition is trading at a decentralized exchange (DEX); it could help traders reduce fees by keeping funds on the Layer-2 level, and moving funds to the Layer-1 level when they hit a high amount, making security a priority for the DEX.\n\nFirst used on StarkEx, a permissioned version of Starknet tailored for use by protocols, Volition is expected to go live on Starknet in the third quarter of 2023."
