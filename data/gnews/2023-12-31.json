        "content": "A closely followed crypto strategist believes that Ethereum (ETH) is gearing up for a big rally next year after a bullish December.\n\nPseudonymous analyst Rekt Capital tells his 380,300 followers on the social media platform X that Ethereum looks primed for an over 20% surge if it manages to end December above the key resistance level of $2,274.\n\nThe analyst shares a chart showing ETH retesting $2,274 as support before igniting a rally toward $2,791.\n\n\u201cETH is positioning itself really well for a bullish December monthly close.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, Ethereum is trading for $2,302.\n\nThe crypto strategist is also keeping a close watch on the Ethereum rival MultiversX (EGLD), formerly known as Elrond. Rekt Capital sees EGLD rallying to $85.46 after taking out its resistance at around $60.\n\n\u201cEGLD continues to perform well. First, reclaimed orange area as support. And then the red area as support. Following the black path now.\n\nDips into red = healthy but may not occur.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, EGLD is trading for $68.83.\n\nThe next altcoin on the trader\u2019s radar is fellow Ethereum competitor Near (NEAR). According to Rekt Capital, NEAR could retest $3.35 as support first before breaking out of its immediate resistance at $4.36.\n\n\u201cRejects from $4.36 and may be set for a monthly close below said level.\n\nHowever, NEAR still remains inside this blue-blue range, with scope to retest the range low soon.\n\nStability there could precede another challenge of $4.36+.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, NEAR is worth $3.71.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

This vision, centered on decentralized applications, privacy protection, and peer-to-peer communication, has been somewhat overshadowed by the network\u2019s growing focus on DeFi and other financial applications.\n\nIntegrating rollups, zero-knowledge proofs, and other privacy-enhancing technologies is a step towards restoring this cypherpunk ethos. These advancements could enable developers to create more private and censorship-resistant applications on Ethereum.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nWhile addressing security vulnerabilities is a priority, the transition phase, particularly during the Merge, might expose the network to temporary security vulnerabilities or attacks.\n\nRemoving outdated code and implementing new enhancements could pose compatibility issues for existing applications.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nAs Ethereum continues to evolve, it is crucial to remember the principles that inspired its creation. By embracing privacy protection, decentralization, and peer-to-peer communication, Ethereum can reclaim its cypherpunk roots and become a true force for positive change in the digital world.\n\nTo learn more about Vitalik Buterin\u2019s proposals to enhance Ethereum\u2019s network efficiency, read here:\n\nVitalik Proposes 3 Paths to Enhance ETH Network Efficiency\n\n\n\nTo delve into the details of Trump\u2019s sale of $2.5M ETH following disappointing Mugshot NFT sales, read here:\n\nTrump Sells $2.5M ETH Upon Disappointing Mugshot NFT Sales"

However, starting in 2017, Ethereum\u2019s focus began to shift toward financial applications, according to Buterin.\n\nIn the future, he hopes to revive the quintessential \u201ccypherpunk\u201d ideals, such as decentralization, open participation, resistance to censorship, and trustworthiness.\n\nButerin also noted that recent advancements like rollups, zero-knowledge proofs, account abstraction, and second-generation privacy solutions align well with Ethereum\u2019s original values.\n\nDespite minor setbacks and challenges, his updated 2024 vision for Ethereum points towards an optimistic future, with analysts like Raoul Pal forecasting a potential price rise for ETH of up to $5,300.\n\nETH price to blow in 2024?\n\nFrom Pal\u2019s perspective, Ethereum\u2019s price is poised for a significant uptrend. It isn\u2019t a random prediction\u2014Pal has grounded it in the liquidity indicator, a key tool that analysts leverage to forecast the potential price shifts of assets.\n\nWhile the Real Vision co-founder injected a note of caution, reminding crypto investors that his forecasts aren\u2019t guaranteed, he exhibited an undeniable bullish outlook for Ethereum.\n\nPal further pointed out the potential impact of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on Ethereum\u2019s progress. He postulated that the introduction of a Bitcoin spot ETF could set the stage for an Ethereum ETF, revitalizing the Ethereum ecosystem in the process.\n\nPal\u2019s outlook was shared by analysts at CryptosRUs, who predicted a surge in ETH\u2019s growth starting in Q1 2024.\n\nOver the past few weeks, we have seen rotations of capital through several crypto ecosystems, including #CosmosEcosystem , #Solana, #Injective, #BRC20s, and #Avalanche.\n\n\n\nIn today's #analysis, I am going to explain why I believe Ethereum will be the next ecosystem to see explosive\u2026 pic.twitter.com/XdFxqzkbUP \u2014 CryptosRUs Analysis (@CRUAnalysis) December 26, 2023\n\nAccording to the analysts, ETH\u2019s upward trajectory will be fueled by factors such as positive market sentiment, the seasonality of ETH and Bitcoin (BTC), and the forthcoming Dencun upgrade.\n\nIn November, IntoTheBlock reported that over 75% of Ethereum addresses were profitable at a time when ETH was priced at $2,200. The market intelligence platform also stated that only about 22.5% of Ethereum addresses experienced unrealized losses, with close to 1.17% at the break-even point.\n\nEthereum\u2019s network activity also saw significant rises, with the number of new addresses on the network spiking by about 17.5% and active addresses seeing a boost of roughly 23%.\n\nFurthermore, Ethereum addresses without ETH balances also surged by around 74%, while the number of Ethereum addresses with ETH balances is on a steadily ascending trajectory.\n\nOver the past 30 days, the average count of Ethereum addresses was approximately 102.72 million\u2014more than double the number for Bitcoin.\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "content": "Ethereum is out and Solana is in.\n\nEthereum, its mess of layer-2s and neverending scaling roadmap are doomed to be usurped by its younger \u201cmonolithic\u201d rival.\n\nAt least, that\u2019s what the rabblers on X are saying.\n\nThe sagging ETH-to-BTC ratio surely isn\u2019t helping. Bitcoin has swelled 160% this year, while ETH hasn\u2019t even doubled. Anyone who sold their bitcoin for ether in January would\u2019ve so far lost a quarter of their BTC on that trade.\n\nSolana\u2019s bitcoin ratio is up more than 300%. SOL\u2019s dollar price is now 10 times what it was at the start of the year, although it\u2019s still down almost two-thirds from its record high at the top of the last bull market.\n\nSolana truthers would also point to the network\u2019s cheap fees and engaged community, which have lately inspired a boom in Solana-native NFTs, memecoins and decentralized exchanges. Solana even flipped Ethereum for DEX volume for the first time earlier this month.\n\nProjects are now plotting additional airdrops to incentivize on-chain Solana activity, hinting at far more buzz to come.\n\nBut it\u2019s not all doom and gloom for Vitalik fans.\n\nAn Ethereum vibecession may have given way to a Solanaissance, but these charts should pick up your spirits.\n\nEthereum\u2019s number has definitely gone up\n\nOne could sift through the minutiae of blockchain tech stacks \u2014 debate the finer points of the appchain thesis and the security concerns surrounding consensus. Or, we could just focus on price.\n\nEther\u2019s earliest recorded price was $3 when it opened trade way back in 2015. ETH now trades for $2,300 \u2014 a 76,000% return over its whole history (not counting the additional gains made on its ICO price).\n\nBitcoin\u2019s all-time returns would completely dwarf ether\u2019s and solana\u2019s. Let\u2019s just pretend they wouldn\u2019t\n\nSolana has done well but not that well, posting a meager 40,000% since its debut in mid-2020, about half ether\u2019s returns.\n\nAnd we all know that markets are always right.\n\nEvery second dollar locked is on Ethereum\n\nCrypto has so many use cases. You can buy other cryptocurrencies with it. You can buy NFTs with it, and maybe some Dallas Mavericks merchandise.\n\nYou can even buy movie tickets or Adidas shoes with crypto \u2014 although you\u2019ll have to send your bitcoin to a payment processor who will dump it for fiat on behalf of the merchant.\n\nIf using crypto as actual money doesn\u2019t appeal, you could always lock it up in a blockchain and earn yield on it. Maybe even lend it out to other people who might buy other cryptocurrencies with it.\n\nEven Ethereum layer-2 network Arbitrum has more TVL than Solana\n\nThere\u2019s about $53 billion in crypto locked up in DeFi protocols, and more than half of that is on Ethereum. Only 2.6% is staked with Solana platforms, equal to about $1.4 billion.\n\nTVL gets a bad rap by those who say it doesn\u2019t properly reflect how people interact with competing blockchains. Ignore them, they\u2019re probably Solana fans.\n\nUsers pay more to use Ethereum (a good thing)\n\nWe get it, there are cheaper blockchains to use than Ethereum. Solana is one of them.\n\nLow fees are great for anyone who wants to wash trade NFTs and memecoins, but they\u2019re not so great if you want people to actually make money by contributing to the network.\n\nEthereum users have paid more than $2.3 billion to use the blockchain this year. Over on Solana, users have forked out less than $20 million \u2014 under 1% of Ethereum fees.\n\nEven ignoring Ethereum, crypto users have paid way more to use Bitcoin and Tron than Solana\n\nGranted, Ethereum fees don\u2019t go directly to validators anymore, they\u2019re instead burned to reduce the supply, which, in a roundabout way, benefits all ETH holders.\n\nSolana, on the other hand, subsidizes the network\u2019s low fees by printing tokens, effectively penalizing all SOL holders with inflation.\n\nActive addresses and where to find them\n\nUntil we all scan our eyeballs with the Worldcoin orb and blend our biometrics with the blockchain, nailing down exactly how many people really use crypto is practically impossible.\n\nAll that shouldn\u2019t get in the way of pretending.\n\nAdding up the cumulative number of active addresses every day this year across 29 different blockchains shows Ethereum, Solana and even Bitcoin aren\u2019t even the most popular chains.\n\nThere\u2019s no telling how many of these are unique individuals. Whatever, big numbers are good numbers\n\nThe cumulative daily active addresses for Justin Sun\u2019s Tron is almost 600 million. Binance\u2019s BNB Chain has attracted more than three times the active addresses of Solana.\n\nEthereum mainnet\u2019s count is only slightly ahead of Solana\u2019s, but including layer-2s like zkSync Era, Arbitrum and Optimism gives more than 300 million.\n\nEthereum against the world (wide web 2.0)\n\nCrypto market caps are terribly inaccurate. They\u2019re easily gamed, never take lost supplies into account and hardly ever reflect the real liquidity of the underlying token.\n\nThis often results in valuations far higher than what could be realistically extracted from the market itself. Sounds bad, but most of that can be also said of market capitalizations for stocks.\n\nIn any case, if Ethereum was a stock, with which industries would it compete?\n\nSure, comparing crypto to stocks is apples to oranges. It still feels right\n\nEthereum\u2019s whole \u201cworld computer\u201d shtick could force it alongside cloud stocks like Amazon, Cisco and IBM. The network\u2019s power to process stablecoin payments would otherwise put it against PayPal, Visa and Mastercard.\n\nWell, Ethereum\u2019s market cap, averaged out over the past six months, is three times PayPal\u2019s and seven times more than the stock valuation of Cash App creator Block (formerly Square).\n\nSolana\u2019s current market cap is now above Block\u2019s, but its average since June is lower than all of them.\n\nDavid is an Editor based in the Netherlands focused on data-driven journalism.
