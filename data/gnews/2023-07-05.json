        "content": "Ethereum price failed to test $2,000 and corrected lower against the US Dollar. ETH is testing the $1,930 support and might start a fresh increase.\n\nEthereum is correcting gains from the $1,975 zone.\n\nThe price is trading above $1,930 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere is a short-term declining channel forming with resistance near $1,950 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair could start another increase if it remains stable above $1,930 in the near term.\n\nEthereum Price Holds Support\n\nEthereum\u2019s price attempted an upside break above the $1,975 zone but failed. ETH struggled to gain pace for a move toward $2,000 and corrected gains, similar to Bitcoin.\n\nThere was a drop below the $1,950 support. The price declined below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $1,890 swing low to the $1,975 high. However, the bulls were active near the $1,930 support zone.\n\nIt also tested the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $1,890 swing low to the $1,975 high. Ether price is now trading above $1,930 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nImmediate resistance is near the $1,950 level. There is also a short-term declining channel forming with resistance near $1,950 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The next major resistance is near the $1,975 level. A clear move above the $1,975 resistance could push the price toward $2,000.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nThe next resistance sits near $2,050, above which the price could rise toward the $2,120 level. Any more gains could send Ether toward the $2,200 resistance.\n\nMore Losses in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $1,950 resistance or $1,950, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,930 level and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThe first major support is near the $1,910 level. The next major support is near the $1,900 level. If there is a move below the $1,900 support, the price could drop toward the $1,870 support level. Any more losses may perhaps send the price toward the $1,820 support in the near term.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bullish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $1,930\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $1,975\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Starknet, an Ethereum Layer 2 network, is preparing to launch an upgrade this month to boost its capacity for transactions per second.\n\nScheduled for launch around July 12, the \"Quantum Leap\" upgrade aims to elevate the network's throughput to over hundred transactions per second. This would mark a significant upswing from current levels, according to the team at StarkWare, a key network contributor.\n\nCurrently undergoing testing, Starknet version 12.0 awaits approval from the Starknet community through an ongoing vote. If it passes the community validation, the upgrade will be deployed to the mainnet. After a dedicated period of engineering by StarkWare, LambdaClass, and other participants within the Starknet ecosystem, the upgrade was first released on the Goerli testnet on July 3.\n\n\u201cStarknet\u2019s new version, Quantum Leap, is exactly what the name suggests \u2013 a leap in TPS, the likes of which nobody has yet achieved in the Ethereum ecosystem,\u201d said Eli Ben-Sasson, co-founder of StarkWare.\n\nStarknet, a decentralized Layer 2 network, utilizes a solution classified as a Zero Knowledge roll-up, which condenses multiple transactions on an off-chain layer and publishes them together on the Ethereum network. StarkWare was the original architect of Starknet, employing the Stark cryptographic proofs mechanism invented by the team. Today, StarkWare is among a collaborative group of contributors shaping Starknet\u2019s evolution, with the network\u2019s operations and roadmap now under the purview of the Starknet Foundation.\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nEnhancing Ethereum\u2019s scalability with Starknet\n\nWhile the upgrade is expected to position Starknet at the top of the TPS leaderboards for Ethereum Layer 2 scaling solutions, it will also improve latency, with an expected time-to-inclusion of under 15 seconds under normal conditions. According to StarkWare, this is expected to help scale DeFi applications and the gaming niche by facilitating faster transactions and greater throughput for users.\n\nThe Starknet roadmap includes plans for version 13.0 later this year that aims to cut down transaction costs. Version 14, meanwhile, will introduce a system where developers can pay extra to prioritize transactions, thereby creating a marketplace for block space on the Layer 2 network.\n\nBen-Sasson added that a major focus for the Starknet network in the future will also be leveraging the account abstraction feature. The mechanism could enable innovative integrations within crypto apps, such as the use of two-factor authentication for signing crypto transactions and wallet recovery."

        "title": "Will ERC 6551 transform Ethereum metaverses with NFT-owned wallets? - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "The proposed ERC 6551 token standard for NFTs is generating interest among crypto enthusiasts, as it would enable digital assets to own other tokens, a development that could significantly transform the NFT and metaverse landscape.\n\nSpeaking to Laura Shin on a recent episode of the Unchained Podcast, Benny Giang and Jayden Windle, two of the authors of the Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) for ERC 6551, stated this new standard allows NFTs to own other tokens, essentially equipping them with their own \u2018wallets.\u2019\n\nWhat is ERC 6551?\n\nThe token standard proposal, introduced in February, focuses on creating a system that assigns every ERC-721 (non-fungible token) a smart contract account. This will allow these tokens to own assets and interact with applications without changing existing ERC-721 smart contracts or infrastructure.\n\nThis system comprises two main components: a permissionless registry for deploying token-bound accounts and a standard implementation interface.\n\nThe registry will deploy a unique smart contract account for each ERC-721 token, allowing the token to interact with the blockchain, record transaction history, and own on-chain assets. Control of each token-bound account is delegated to the owner of the ERC-721 token, allowing the owner to initiate on-chain actions on behalf of their token.\n\nThe proposal seeks to be maximally backward compatible with existing non-fungible token contracts. It also uses EIP-155 chain IDs to uniquely identify ERC-721 tokens, allowing for optional support of multi-chain token-bound accounts.\n\nDeveloper reaction\n\nThe initial developer discussion for the proposal centered on potential security implications, such as the risk of duplicating registries and the need for trust verification. Suggestions included creating a registry for broad registration of account Implementations and making the proposal\u2019s registry canonical due to its permissionless nature.\n\nThe proposal\u2019s potential implications for reducing airdrop costs were also highlighted, along with a discussion that also raised security worries about adding metadata to the NFT registry.\n\nMore recently, with over 160 comments from Ethereum developers, concerns were raised about the proposal still being in the \u2018Draft\u2019 status, potentially subjecting it to significant changes. Finally, there were discussions about finalizing the naming of functions and the potential impacts on those implementing the EIP.\n\nBenefits of ERC 6551\n\nAs Giang explained on the Unchained Podcast, ERC 6551 was sparked by a simple query \u2013\n\n\u201cWhat if we had a project that was an NFT project that had a character, and sometimes we call this a PFP (Profile Picture) project, right? Our main question was like, why can\u2019t you change the clothing or the aesthetic of this PFP character?\u201d\n\nThis question led to the inception of the ERC 6551 standard, allowing NFTs to own other tokens, essentially giving them their own \u2018wallets.\u2019\n\nGiang further added,\n\n\u201cDo you pursue the off-chain way where you build a database, and you have all this kind of centralization where you could render the NFT? Or you go the on-chain way, which is like every item an NFT can be applicable on-chain as a transaction. So through this kind of journey, as we were feeling in the dark in the last eight or nine months, we realized that there was a potential solution.\u201d\n\nGiang and Windle also discussed the pros and cons of pursuing the on-chain or off-chain method for applying every item an NFT could own as a transaction.\n\nThey concluded that the ERC 6551 standard was a potential solution to the limitations presented by previous attempts to standardize NFTs owning assets, such as the necessity for custom logic in their smart contract. The ERC 6551 standard overcomes these restrictions, granting NFTs the same rights as Ethereum users, allowing them to own assets and take action.\n\nThe podcast guests also highlighted that while ERC 721, ERC 1155, and soul-bound tokens exist as ways to own items on Ethereum, ERC 6551 is not a token standard in the traditional sense because it gives every existing ERC 721 its own wallet, thus unlocking a new layer of compatibility for NFTs.\n\nUse cases of ERC 6551\n\nThe implementation of ERC 6551 has created exciting prospects across various industries, according to the EIP authors. It allows NFTs to own assets and perform actions autonomously, potentially beneficial in gaming, DAOs, infrastructure and tooling, and social networks.\n\nGiang mentioned several projects like \u2018Sapiens,\u2019 \u2018Fuel Worlds,\u2019 and \u2018Parallel Trading Card Game,\u2019 leveraging the standard for gamification. Giang commented, \u201cIt makes a lot of sense for a decentralized game inventory.\u201d Such games, thus, allow characters to have their own wallets and act independently in the game.\n\nAccording to Giang, Decentralized Autonomous Organizations, or DAOs, such as \u2018Station\u2019 and \u2018Dow House,\u2019 are also exploring this standard to monitor engagement within their communities. Further, the infrastructure and tooling industry, represented by \u2018Manifold,\u2019 \u2018Nosis Guild,\u2019 and \u2018Rabbit Hole,\u2019 are reportedly working on modules around the standard.\n\nGiang suggested a future in which NFTs could become Network Playable Characters (NPCs), digital entities that can perform on-chain actions controlled by either a human or an AI model. This could potentially resolve the \u201cempty world problem\u201d observed in many digital worlds.\n\nThe ERC-6551 proposal, as explained by Jayden Windle, is simple.\n\n\u201cA token-bound account, under this standard, is its own type of wallet. Thus, an NFT can have a unique wallet address that can own any assets \u2014 a concept that Windle describes \u2018gets pretty fractal pretty quickly.\u201d\n\nUnder this standard, a token-bound account is its own type of wallet. Therefore, an NFT can have a unique wallet address to own assets. However, it is important to note that while any Ethereum wallet can control an NFT\u2019s wallet, the ownership of the token-bound account will always be owned by the NFT.\n\nIf approved, the advent and application of the ERC 6551 standard could mark a significant development, expanding the functionality of NFTs and enhancing their utility.\n\nMentioned in this article"
