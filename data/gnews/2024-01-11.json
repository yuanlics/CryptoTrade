Despite the optimism, SEC Chair Gary Gensler\u2019s previous statements suggest a cautious approach to approving crypto asset securities, particularly for assets other than Bitcoin.\n\nThe price increase reflects a broader market sentiment that an Ethereum ETF could soon follow the path of Bitcoin ETFs, with firms like BlackRock and Ark having filed applications.\n\nThe possibility of an Ethereum ETF has sparked discussions about the classification of cryptocurrencies as securities or commodities, a debate that could impact the SEC\u2019s decision-making process."

        "title": "Ether prices spike on hopes of an ETF \u2014 but the SEC signals that's less clear cut than bitcoin - CNBC",
        "content": "In this article BTC.CM=\n\nETH.BF= Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nwatch now\n\nSt. Moritz, SWITZERLAND \u2014 U.S. Securities and Exchange Chair Gary Gensler fired warning shots to the crypto industry, casting doubt over whether digital coin ether would follow next in the footsteps of bitcoin to receive approval for an exchange-traded fund. After the bitcoin ETF approval, prices for ether \u2014 the token linked with Ethereum \u2014 spiked to their highest level since May 2022. That was because investors are betting on an ether \u2014 or ETH \u2014 ETF to be rubberstamped by the SEC next. The agency is due to give decisions on spot ETH ETF applications beginning in May. BlackRock, Invesco, Ark and VanEck are among the firms in line for approval, as well as Grayscale.\n\nThe SEC has long been an opponent of cryptocurrencies, and its bitcoin ETF approval in no way changed its stance in a big way. After the ETF decision, Gensler issued a statement in which he called bitcoin \"speculative\" and said it could be used for \"illicit\" purposes. One comment poured cold water over hopes of an ETH ETF. \"Importantly, today's Commission action is cabined to ETPs holding one non-security commodity, bitcoin. It should in no way signal the Commission's willingness to approve listing standards for crypto asset securities,\" Gensler said Wednesday after the SEC decision on the ETFs.\n\nCrypto as commodities or securities?\n\nA long-running debate in the U.S. is over whether cryptocurrencies are classified as securities or as commodities. Key to Gensler's comments was his reference that bitcoin's status as a \"non-security commodity\" was one of the reasons why the SEC was comfortable approving the ETF. Gensler made clear that \"the vast majority of crypto assets are investment contracts and thus subject to the federal securities laws,\" in the SEC's view. This complicates matters for an ETH ETF. \"One distinction which I think people have to look at which is that bitcoin clearly has been bucketed as a commodity, Ethereum, there's still some question. Is it a security? Is it a commodity? And I think until that's resolved, it cannot be look at exactly like the bitcoin product, in terms of how do you structure and ETF around it,\" Bill Tai, chairperson of Aktai, told CNBC in an interview at the Crypto Finance Conference in St. Moritz. Tai said that approving an ETH ETF is \"not as clear cut\" as was the case of bitcoin. \"I do think that it's not out of the range of possibility, but there are additional factors to consider around that one because of its classification,\" Tai said. Securities and commodities are regulated under different laws and by different agencies.\n\nWill an ETH ETF happen this year?\n\nCommentators are split on when an ETH ETF may come to the market. Some, like Antoni Trenchev, co-founder of cryptocurrency exchange Nexo, think it will happen this year. \"I'd watch what the SEC does and not what it says, because it wasn't long ago that the prospect of a spot Bitcoin ETF seemed like a distant dream. Things move very fast in crypto and investors are front-running what they believe to be the next big spot ETF approval,\" Trenchev told CNBC by email. \"You'd have to say now that bitcoin has knocked down the door it's only a matter of when not if others will follow \u2014 most likely in 2024 \u2014 and ETH is definitely the leader of the pack.\" Christopher Giancarlo, co-founder of the digital dollar project and former chair of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, oversaw the introduction of bitcoin futures in 2017. He said that, in his experience at the regulator, the approval of one product opens the doors for others. \"Once we greenlighted bitcoin futures, there as a tremendous movement in the CFTC jurisdiction area for greenlighting ethereum futures and that did come 18 months later,\" Giancarlo told CNBC on Thursday. He added that he would be \"shocked\" if there weren't growing demand for an ether ETF. \"The SEC's going to have deal with the growing demand for that product,\" Giancarlo added. Others are a little more skeptical that the SEC could approve an ETH ETF in the short term.\n\nwatch now"

        "content": "What Happened in Crypto Today: Ethereum ETFs To Be Approved by May?\n\nAfter days of volatility and months of uncertainty, the SEC finally approved the first Bitcoin spot ETF. And as K33 Research expected, this long-awaited move did not become a \"sell the news\" event, as much of the leverage had already been shaken out last week.\n\nNow that this regulatory barrier has come down, we look ahead to what other opportunities may open up in crypto. But before we gaze too far into the horizon, let's recap today\u2019s top crypto news stories.\n\nTLDR:\n\nSEC approves first-ever spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\n\nFund issuers engage in battle royale for BTC ETF market share, slashing fees \ud83d\udde1\ufe0f\n\nGensler offers warnings despite approving BTC ETFs \ud83d\udea8\n\nUK central banker criticizes BTC's value and efficiency \ud83d\ude10\n\nEthereum ETF approval odds look good for May \ud83e\udd1e\n\nRipple announces $785M stock buyback plan \ud83d\udcb0\n\nNow let's dive deeper into each of those topics\u2026\n\nBTC Spot ETF Approved fr! \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\n\nFirst, the most important news\u2026\n\nIt finally happened - the SEC approved not just one, but ELEVEN spot Bitcoin ETFs!\n\nThis mass greenlighting came on the expected deadline after months of bottled-up anticipation.\n\nFinancial giants like BlackRock, ARK Invest, Invesco and more now have the all-clear for their BTC funds. Even Grayscale's Bitcoin Trust secured conversion authority!\n\nOf course, Gary Gensler couldn't resist throwing some shade amidst his agency's watershed Bitcoin moment. Despite the reversal, he shilled the same old \"illicit activity\" \ud83d\ude44(we will cover this one in detail).\n\nETF approval unlocks billions (or maybe trillions) in fresh institutional capital and mainstream accessibility.\n\nSo is it going to impact BTC\u2019s price eventually? Read the full story!\n\nThe Hunger Games (ETF Edition) \ud83d\udde1\n\nAnd the battle royale begins! After the SEC finally (and reluctantly) approved Bitcoin spot ETFs, fund issuers drew swords to compete over market share.\n\nAnd their chosen weapon? Significant fee cuts to attract capital inflows!\n\nStory continues\n\nBlackRock led the charge - dropping its ratio to 0.25% after originally demanding a 0.3% fee.\n\nNot to be outdone - ARK Invest, 21Shares, Bitwise and Valkyrie matched with reductions down to 0.2% or lower.\n\nOf course, one player remains the elephant in the room - Grayscale still demands 1.5% with its $28 billion GBTC AUM.\n\nWhat does this fee war indicate? Is it going to help crypto in any way? Read the full story!\n\nGensler\u2019s Warnings Continue \ud83d\udea8\n\nThe chief regulator couldn't resist throwing some shade on the assets underlying these new funds. Gensler emphasized the SEC does NOT endorse Bitcoin itself following approvals. He gave the same old narratives of volatility risks and usage for nefarious exploits. \ud83d\ude44\n\nGens even dragged precious metals like gold and silver to emphasize BTC's inferior industrial utility.\n\nCheck out his entire statement!\n\nAnd while we are at it\u2026\n\nUK Central Banker Criticizes Bitcoin Again \ud83d\ude10\n\nBank of England Governor Andrew Bailey also showed his skepticism about Bitcoin this week.\n\nDuring recent UK Parliament hearings, Bailey dragged Bitcoin as an \"inefficient\" payments innovator while doubting its intrinsic value.\n\nEchoing her boss' skepticism, Deputy Governor Breeden also spotlighted crypto's lack of regulatory guardrails as hindering mainstream adoption. But she did acknowledge the landscape is slowly evolving.\n\nThe banking bureaucrats also fretted about stablecoins and their \u201copaque\u201d inner workings. Concerns we've heard ad nauseam at this point.\n\nRead the full story!\n\nEthereum ETF Approval \ud83e\udd1e\n\nAnd something we are looking forward to\u2026\n\nWith Bitcoin's ETF floodgates busting wide open, the expectation now pivots to the impending ETH spot fund verdict!\n\nAnd Bloomberg's Eric Balchunas puts the odds of approval by May at 70%. That's when the SEC deadline hits for multiple Ethereum trust applications.\n\nHe previously said he can't imagine a scenario where BTC gets the green light but not Ethereum. After all - the ETH spot is \"tied to the hip of the Bitcoin spot.\"\n\nSo with OG coin's decade-long issue finally rectified, hopes run high for Ether's emancipation soon after!\n\nEthereum itself felt the warmth of positive sentiment this week. ETH pumped 15% in the last 7 days - piercing above $2.5K resistance as fund approval odds boost bull morale!\n\nIs Ethereum going to enjoy the same price ride as Bitcoin did? Read the full story!\n\nRipple\u2019s Buyback Announcement \ud83d\udcb0\n\nRipple Labs plans to use $285 million to buy back shares from early investors at a $11 billion valuation.\n\nThis liquidity largesse offers investors a chance to offload up to 6% of their holdings. Ripple also pledged an additional $500 million to grease the wheels on payroll tax and RSU conversions.\n\nRather than rushing to IPO, the firm reaffirmed its commitment to supporting native token growth and pursuing regulatory clarity abroad first.\n\nHow is it going to impact XRP? Read the full story!\n\nAnd that wraps up the key crypto news for today.
