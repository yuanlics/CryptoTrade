        "title": "Two Powerful Blockchain Platforms of the Future: Ethereum and Solana - Paxos",
        "content": "Blockchain, once overlooked in the shadow of cryptocurrency, is now a powerhouse player in its own right with implications far beyond the financial sector. From improving supply chain integrity to facilitating transactions for a wide range of digital assets, its use cases are vast and varied.\n\nBut what lies at the heart of this innovative technology, and how can it be harnessed? It is helpful for enterprises across many industries to understand the fundamentals of blockchain and how key platforms like Ethereum and Solana are leading the charge in this technological revolution.\n\nWhat is blockchain?\n\nBlockchain is digital ledger technology that documents transactions across a network of computers. It can log and track everything from cryptocurrency payments to real-world assets to legal agreements.\n\nBlockchain technology is renowned for its security and immutability. The technology\u2019s name stems from the fact that it\u2019s comprised of a series of \u201cblocks,\u201d with each containing transaction data, a timestamp and a cryptographic hash of the previous block. Every transaction is linked in a \u201cchain\u201d and distributed across numerous nodes.\n\nBecause of the decentralized nature of the blockchain, there\u2019s little risk of manipulation from entities like governments or financial institutions. In fact, a blockchain\u2019s structure makes it nearly impossible to retroactively alter any single record without changing all subsequent blocks.\n\nBlockchain technology offers transparency and decentralization, making it an attractive option for transactional applications\u2014among them, money movement, supply chain management and even digital identity verification.\n\nEthereum and Solana\n\nWithin blockchain technology, there are many different blockchain platforms. Two of the most prominent blockchain platforms are Ethereum and Solana, each with unique features and capabilities.\n\nEthereum (ETH): Ethereum, launched in 2015, is both a cryptocurrency and a platform for building decentralized applications. Ethereum introduced the concept of \u201c smart contracts ,\u201d or self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement written directly into lines of code. The latest iteration of Ethereum\u2019s blockchain is secured using a proof-of-stake ( PoS ) consensus mechanism\u2014essentially, th e process by which validators create new blocks. ( Learn more about consensus mechanisms and how they work here .)\n\nSolana (SOL): Solana is a newer blockchain platform that launched to the public in 2020. It\u2019s known for speed and efficiency. It employs a unique hybrid consensus model, combining proof-of-history (PoH) with proof-of-stake (PoS). This enables it to process transactions rapidly and with lower fees compared to Ethereum. As such, Solana is an attractive platform for high-frequency trading and other applications requiring quick transaction times.\n\nEthereum and Solana have gained popularity because they offer solutions to common pain points related to scalability, speed and cost. These platforms have also sparked an entire ecosystem of subsequent innovation: Ethereum\u2019s smart contract functionality has given rise to decentralized applications (dApps), decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\n\nThe future of finance: instant transfers and more\n\nImagine a world where international suppliers are paid the moment goods are shipped, employees receive compensation in real-time and complex financial transactions are settled instantly. This immediacy not only streamlines business operations, but also opens doors to new financial strategies like dynamic pricing. The ripple effects of such capabilities include more agile, responsive and competitive businesses and a transformation of the way global commerce operates.\n\nBlockchains like Ethereum and Solana have the potential to make such hypotheticals into realities. With their ability to power instant, 24/7 financial transactions across borders, blockchains may be particularly attractive to enterprises operating in multiple countries or those engaging in high-volume trade, not to mention the implications for sectors like e-commerce and digital supply chain management.\n\nBlockchain technology is evolving rapidly. Many enterprises need a hand when it comes to adopting it and maximizing its potential and a trusted partner can help you seamlessly integrate blockchain into existing operations.\n\nBlockchain is transforming the way we think about money, assets and transactions and is paving the way for new business models and strategies. With the right partners to help you navigate and implement blockchain systems, your business will be well-positioned to stay a step ahead in the digital finance era."

        "content": "Bitcoin is still down on 21-month highs set directly after the SEC bungled its spot ETF announcement on Tuesday. Ethereum, on the other hand, is way up.\n\nEther (ETH) has rallied more than 16% in that time and is now easily the year-to-date best performing top-20 cryptocurrencies by market cap. Bitcoin (BTC) is so far in second-place, with about half those returns.\n\nMarkets sold the news one day early due to the SEC\u2019s unauthorized announcement and appear to have simultaneously bought the rumor on ether ETFs.\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC) \u2014 the original Ethereum hard fork in 25th position \u2014 is however having a moment. The blockchain\u2019s native token ETC has spiked nearly 50% over the past day.\n\nDue to the timing, there doesn\u2019t appear to be any real rhyme or reason for ETC to be climbing so quickly.\n\nThe devil\u2019s advocate would say that Ethereum Classic is gearing up for a hard fork later this month tipped to better align the network\u2019s EVM with Ethereum\u2019s, which could help inspire projects to work with the chain.\n\nAnd the network\u2019s hashrate did spike to all-time highs following Ethereum\u2019s switched to proof-of-stake in late 2022, as former ETH miners sought a substitute revenue stream at which to direct their GPU mining rigs.\n\nEther has jumped from $2,200 to $2,650 this week. Ethereum Classic has gone from $20 to $30.\n\nMuch of Ethereum Classic\u2019s post-Merge hashrate has stuck around, despite the network only seeing around 30,000 in transactions per day (about the baseline for Bitcoin Cash).\n\nFor scale, Litecoin is currently processing more than half a million transactions per day (boosted by the network\u2019s own brand of inscriptions) while Ethereum mainnet handles about twice as much, per BitInfoCharts.\n\nStill, Ethereum Classic only boasts less than 15% of Ethereum\u2019s hashrate recorded just before the Merge.\n\nETHPoW, the hard fork of Ethereum from around the Merge meant to compete with Ethereum Classic, currently has about one-tenth of the latter\u2019s hashrate.\n\nRead more: Grayscale Still Deciding What To Do With ETHPoW\n\nIn fact, until yesterday\u2019s formal SEC approval of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds, ETC had returned nothing over the past year.\n\nThe more likely explanation is that traders are looking to frontrun the next big media narrative around crypto: the SEC approving spot bitcoin ETFs means an eventual greenlight for spot ether funds.\n\nDue to illiquid markets, dumb money or widespread left-curving, Ethereum Classic has tagged along for the ride but ended up dominating ether for gains over the short-term.\n\nGrayscale does already sell exposure to the token through one of its trusts, and the firm is now set to convert its $29 billion bitcoin trust into an ETF.\n\nSome reckon fund issuers might soon seek approval for ETFs for other cryptocurrencies, including XRP and solana.\n\nThe odds of fund issuers lining up to launch ETFs for Ethereum Classic are slim. Although stranger things have happened in crypto.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

ENS simplifies human-readable Ethereum addresses like john.eth into machine-readable alphanumeric codes commonly associated with wallets such as Metamask. As of the latest data, ENS is sitting at $23.15, following a 55.1% increase in the last 24 hours, amid a positive trend in the overall Ethereum market.\n\nTop crypto gainers of the day | CoinMarketCap\n\nThe surge in ENS price coincides with Ethereum briefly surpassing the $2,400 mark on Jan. 10, marking a 10% rise within the week, in anticipation of the Bitcoin ETF Approval. Additionally, an earlier message from Vitalik.eth underscoring the importance of CCIP resolvers for Layer 2 solutions (L2s) has also been said to feed into positive market sentiment.\n\nYou might also like: Ethereum price to cross $3k after Bitcoin ETF approval?\n\nTaking the second spot in the gainers is Ethereum Classic (ETC), a hard fork of Ethereum (ETH) introduced in July 2016, which primarily operates as a smart contract network supporting decentralized applications (DApps). The live price of Ethereum Classic is recorded at $30.53 USD, after a 46% surge in the past 24 hours. The driving force behind this notable increase is again linked to the approval of Bitcoin ETFs by the U.S. SEC.

Tezos (XTZ) is a blockchain network functioning on smart contracts, although it is said to provide more advanced infrastructure. Its price surge is tied to an announcement from TezFin, the Tezos defi lending platform, which announced the launch of its production version, offering decentralized lending and borrowing on the Tezos blockchain.

        "title": "Should You Buy Ethereum While It's Still Below $2,500? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Amid the current crypto market rally led by Bitcoin, there's one crypto that seems to be getting completely overlooked: Ethereum (ETH 1.13%). That's somewhat surprising, given that Ethereum is the world's second-largest cryptocurrency, with an enormous $290 billion market cap.\n\nHowever, the hype around a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) has focused investor attention squarely on Bitcoin. At the same time, a number of direct Ethereum rivals skyrocketed to triple-digit percentage gains last year, and have become the new darlings of crypto investors looking for maximum upside. But there are several reasons Ethereum might be undervalued at its current price of about $2,400.\n\nEthereum vs. the wannabe Ethereums\n\nAt the end of 2022, Ethereum was the talk of the crypto industry. It had just pulled off The Merge, which fundamentally transformed its blockchain to make it faster, cheaper, easier to use, and much more energy efficient. The hype around Ethereum grew to the point where some investors even thought that Ethereum might eventually surpass Bitcoin in terms of market cap.\n\nBut then came 2023. All of a sudden, rival blockchains like Solana started gaining traction with investors. At one point, Solana was up more than 1,000% for the year. Avalanche, another Ethereum rival, was up nearly 200% for the year. By way of comparison, Ethereum was up 90%, and seemed to be losing the attention of investors.\n\nSo the big question is whether Ethereum is still best-in-class. If you think that the so-called Ethereum killers are just a bunch of Ethereum wannabes with no long-term staying power, then Ethereum could be highly undervalued at its current price. But if you think that Ethereum's long reign as the top Layer-1 blockchain network in the world is coming to an end, then it's a completely different story.\n\nA spot Ethereum ETF incoming?\n\nRight now, the imminent arrival of the first spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) for the U.S. market is getting all the headlines. But, according to a growing number of crypto investors, a spot Ethereum ETF could be coming soon. And that means that Ethereum could soon get the same type of boost Bitcoin is getting right now.\n\nCertainly, the underlying logic makes sense. Wall Street is looking for more reliable ways to invest in crypto, and has apparently determined that the ETF investment product is the best way to achieve this. Once it can show that a spot Bitcoin ETF is successful, then it's time to crank up this formula for every other major cryptocurrency.\n\nGiven Ethereum's market heft -- it now accounts for about 17% of the market value of the entire crypto market, second only to Bitcoin -- it would only make sense that Ethereum would be next in line for a spot ETF. And, indeed, there is already an application in the works for just such a product. In September, Cathie Wood's Ark Invest filed for a spot Ethereum ETF. If the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) decides to approve this (admittedly, a big \"if\"), it could result in billions of dollars flowing into Ethereum, pushing up its price.\n\nA sexy new upgrade\n\nFinally, there's the matter of Ethereum's next big upgrade. Ethereum recently published its strategic roadmap for 2024, and one item on the roadmap that caught the attention of investors was something called EIP-4844 (\"Ethereum Improvement Proposal 4844\"). Basically, this is a proposed technical change that would enable the processing of transactions on the Ethereum blockchain to become much faster and more efficient.\n\nI know, I know. You're probably rolling your eyes right now. What a bunch of blockchain babble, right? But consider that EIP-4844 got J.P. Morgan really excited. In a research note to clients, JPMorgan specifically referred to EIP-4844 as a key reason it thinks Ethereum could outperform Bitcoin in 2024. That's because this major technical change would make it theoretically possible for the Ethereum blockchain to handle 100,000 transactions per second, up from about a dozen or so now. With that type of speed, Ethereum would basically be unstoppable.\n\nHow much higher can Ethereum go?\n\nFirst and foremost, Ethereum needs to convince investors that it is still the preeminent Layer-1 blockchain network. So keep an eye on how Ethereum deals with the growing threat from the likes of Solana. As long as investors buy into the idea that Solana is a faster and more cost-efficient version of Ethereum, it's hard to see Ethereum skyrocketing in price.\n\nWith that in mind, it's certainly possible to find a number of bullish Ethereum price predictions for 2024. Some crypto traders think that Ethereum could double, triple, or even quadruple in value. I may not be as bullish on Ethereum, but I'm certainly open to the idea that Ethereum could surprise a lot of people in 2024."

The asset\u2019s strong fundamentals, growing adoption, and established ecosystem have made it a compelling investment proposition for institutional investors. And with the SEC\u2019s recent decision to approve Bitcoin ETFs, the regulatory hurdles for Ether ETFs have significantly diminished.\n\nThe recent approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs by the SEC has sent Ether prices skyrocketing, as traders speculate that the regulatory agency may soon approve spot Ethereum ETFs as well. ETH traded at over $2,600 in early European hours on Wednesday, up 8% in 24 hours. Meanwhile, Bitcoin prices went up by 1.3% in the same period. BTC had been falling due to a series of tweets from the temporarily hacked SEC\u2019s X account.\n\nConor Ryder, head of research at the stablecoin company Ethena Labs said :\n\n\u201cNow that the Bitcoin ETF speculation has come to fruition it looks like traders are rotating to ether to get ahead of the next narrative, an ETH ETF, while ETH looks relatively cheap compared to most other tokens.\u201d\n\nThe SEC should make a decision on spot ETH ETF applications in May. BlackRock, Invesco , Ark, and VanEck are among the companies vying for approval, with Grayscale also seeking to convert its existing Ethereum Trust (ETHE) into an ETF.\n\nAlright, that\u2019s enough of spot bitcoin ETFs\u2026 Wen spot ether ETFs? \u2014 Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) January 10, 2024\n\nRyder believes the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs has fueled the recent rally in Bitcoin\u2019s price. Meanwhile, he says Ethereum has failed to gain traction compared to smaller blockchain networks like Solana and Cardano.\n\nNew deadline to obsess over just dropped May 23rd is the final deadline for decision on VanEck\u2019s spot ETH ETF pic.twitter.com/dgi5EVbPeQ \u2014 Will (@WClementeIII) January 10, 2024\n\nEthereum ETFs Poised for Breakout\n\nOn January 9, crypto Twitter personality DCInvestor Ethereum would outperform most other assets once the current market cycle ends.\n\ni am not going to tell you that ETH will be the BEST performer this cycle but it will do better and retain more value after this cycle than the vast majority of assets imo it's insanely undervalued at the moment this could be the last great opportunity of a lifetime \u2014 DCinvestor (@iamDCinvestor) January 8, 2024\n\nThe prediction is based on the assumption that Ethereum is the next logical candidate for a spot exchange-traded product (ETP). DCInvestor also noted that Ethereum already has futures-based ETFs. This, he says, indicates that the SEC could well approve a spot ETF soon.\n\nYouTuber Crypto Rover expressed a on Ethereum\u2019s future to his 635,000 YouTube subscribers.\n\nHe :\n\n\u201cAn Ethereum spot ETF is the next big narrative on the horizon.

In the past 90 days, SOL has surged by 360%, while Ethereum\u2019s performance has been relatively modest, with a 48% increase. He believes Ethereum will regain its prominence once the market calms down and the focus turns to its potential for institutional adoption.\n\nInstitutional Demand Drives Approval Prospects\n\nIn a recent analysis, Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart pointed out that the SEC\u2019s approving Ethereum futures and the CFTC\u2019s classifying ETH as a commodity suggest that the possibility of the SEC approving spot Ethereum ETFs this year is increasing.\n\nA host of prominent financial institutions, including BlackRock, VanEck, ARK 21Shares, Fidelity, Invesco Galaxy, Grayscale, and Hashdex, are vying for SEC approval to launch spot Ether ETFs.\n\nThe SEC has set deadlines for each applicant to receive a decision on their proposal:\n\nVanEck: May 23\n\nARK 21Shares: May 24\n\nHashdex: May 30\n\nGrayscale: June 18\n\nInvesco: July 5\n\nFidelity: August 3\n\nBlackRock: August 7\n\nThis intense competition among established financial giants underscores the growing demand for Ether ETFs and the potential impact they could have on the cryptocurrency market."

Crypto industry experts say this signifies investor optimism for a potential ether ETF following the SEC\u2019s approval of eleven spot bitcoin ETFs earlier today.\n\n\u201cStarting with BTC ETF, we are seeing a 'buy the rumor, ignore the news, buy the next rumor' set up,\u201d said Joe Caselin, head of institutional marketing at BIT crypto exchange. \u201cBlackRock filed its ETH ETF application in Nov 2023, and while that is a lot less certain than the numerous BTC ETF applications that were just approved, the potential is huge, as it would mark the first such product for ETH, which already has a large appeal with institutional investors.\u201d\n\nBlackRock, expected to launch its bitcoin ETF on Thursday, has a track record of 575 approvals from the regulator and only one ETF rejection. The first final decision deadline for the SEC on the spot ETH ETF application, from Ark and 21Shares, is on May 23.\n\nUncertainties remain surrounding the spot Ethereum ETF approval, given the current SEC chair Gary Gensler\u2019s adamant stance that every cryptocurrency other than bitcoin is a financial security. Be that as it may, Gensler\u2019s predecessor, Jay Clayton, once mentioned that a small number of tokens might cease to be considered securities if they became broadly decentralized. Former SEC director of corporate finance William Hinman also said during a speech in 2018 that, considering its decentralized nature, ether coins are not financial securities.\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nIs a Solana ETF a possibility?\n\nIf the SEC decides to approve spot Ethereum ETFs, other large-cap cryptocurrencies \u2014 such as Solana \u2014 may be next, Rachael Lucas, crypto technical analyst at Australia-based crypto exchange BTC Markets, told The Block. \u201cAlthough Solana is a comparatively young ecosystem compared to Bitcoin and Ethereum, its noteworthy performance in 2023, marked by positive news and increased developer activity, has captured investor attention. Notably, Solana achieved an impressive price gain of 920%, significantly outpacing Bitcoin's 155% growth in the same period,\u201d Lucas said.\n\nCaselin of BIT shared the same opinion that an Ethereum ETF launch will bring more financial vehicles, giving access to a wider variety of crypto assets. \u201cWe might be looking at a whole range of ETFs that provide access to top market cap tokens and projects, although it may make more sense for a top 50 ETF rather than 50 individual ETFs \u2014 not unlike an S&P 500 for large-cap or 'blue-chip' tokens.\u201d"

However, there was no major increase in Bitcoin, but ETH gained bullish momentum.\n\nThere was a break above a key rising channel with resistance near $2,440 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The pair surged over 5% and even cleared the $2,500 resistance zone. There was a spike above the $2,600 resistance zone. A new multi-week high was formed near $2,642 and the price is now consolidating gains.\n\nThere was a minor decline below $2,600, but Ethereum stayed above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent rally from the $2,346 swing low to the $2,642 high. Ethereum is now trading above $2,500 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nIf there is a fresh increase, the price might face resistance near the $2,650 level. The next major resistance is now near $2,720. A clear move above the $2,720 level might send ETH toward $2,780. A close above the $2,780 resistance could push the price further into a bullish zone.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nThe next key resistance is near $2,840. If the bulls push Ethereum above $2,840, there could be a rally toward $2,920. Any more gains might send the price toward the $3,000 zone.\n\nAre Dips Limited in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $2,650 resistance, it could start a downside correction. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,580 level.\n\nThe first key support could be the $2,500 zone or the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent rally from the $2,346 swing low to the $2,642 high. A downside break and a close below $2,500 might send the price further lower. In the stated case, Ether could test the $2,440 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,350 level.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bullish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now above the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $2,500\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $2,650\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Ethereum ETH +1.29% co-founder Vitalik Buterin voiced support for increasing the block gas limit \u2014 a move that could enhance the network\u2019s capacity.\n\nIn a Reddit ask-me-anything session, when questioned about the safe increment of the gas limit, Buterin recommended a 33.3% increase, proposing to raise the Ethereum block gas limit from its current 30 million to 40 million units of gas.\n\nIf implemented, this adjustment would allow more transactions in each Ethereum block and improve capacity. Buterin stressed that the current gas limit, set at 30 million, has remained unchanged for nearly three years.\n\nThe gas limit in Ethereum represents the maximum computational effort that can be expended on processing transactions or executing smart contracts in a single block.\n\nMartin K\u00f6ppelmann, co-founder of Gnosis, observed that increasing the gas limit would also push the operational requirements for nodes \u2014 likely necessitating more costs. Nevertheless, K\u00f6ppelmann believed that the benefits of a higher gas limit, such as improved network efficiency and capacity, outweigh these potential issues.\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nJesse Pollak, Coinbase protocols lead, also expressed strong support for the change. He stated, \u201cI\u2019m strongly in support of increasing the Ethereum gas limit to 40-45M \u2014 we have the network headroom and it will be beneficial for all parties.\u201d\n\nUnlike several changes to Ethereum that necessitated hard forks, the increase in the Ethereum block gas limit can be achieved through validators adjusting their node configurations.\n\nSince Ethereum\u2019s inception in 2015, the average gas limit was approximately three million. This limit has incrementally risen over time \u2014 reflecting the network\u2019s escalating usage and adoption."

        "content": "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has advocated for a \u201cmodest\u201d gas limit increase to potentially improve network throughput.\n\nDuring a Reddit ask-me-anything (AMA) organized by the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s research team on Jan. 10, Buterin noted that the gas limit has not been increased for nearly three years, the longest time ever in the protocol\u2019s history.\n\n\u201cHonestly, I think doing a modest gas limit increase even today is reasonable,\u201d said Buterin during the research team\u2019s 11th AMA.\n\nButerin also made some brief calculations, saying this would imply an increase to around 40 million. The current gas limit is 30 million, according to Etherscan, so Buterin suggests an increase of 33%.\n\nEthereum average gas limit over time. Source: Etherscan\n\nThe average gas limit just after Ethereum\u2019s genesis in 2015 was around 3 million, which has increased over time along with network usage and adoption.\n\nThe Ethereum gas limit refers to the maximum amount of gas spent on executing transactions or smart contracts in each block. Gas is the fee required to conduct a transaction or execute a contract on the blockchain.\n\nA gas limit is set to ensure that blocks are not too large, which would impact network performance and synchronization. Validators can also adjust the gas limit dynamically within specific parameters as they produce blocks.\n\nIncreasing the gas limit allows more transactions into each block, which theoretically increases the overall throughput and capacity of the network. However, it also increases loads on hardware and the potential risk of network spam and attacks.\n\nRelated: Daily gas spent on EVM inscriptions surges to record high of $8M\n\nAverage gas prices, or the cost of transacting on Ethereum, are currently around 35 gwei or $1.89, according to Etherscan. However, they have increased since the beginning of 2024 and are much higher for complex smart contract operations.\n\nNetwork gas fees spiked to a 2023 high of 150 gwei in May due to the inscriptions craze. A gwei is a denomination of Ethereum that represents one billionth of a single Ether (ETH).\n\nIn November 2023, Ethereum and Bitcoin users reignited the scalability debate as fees surged amid another round of inscriptions hype.\n\nMagazine: Lawmakers\u2019 fear and doubt drives proposed crypto regulations in US"

        "title": "Why is Ethereum Classic (ETC) Going Up? - CoinGape",
        "content": "Ethereum Classic price is continuously going up for the past few hours and is now floating around $28, at the time of writing. It recorded more than 30% gains in the last 24 hours with almost 35% weekly and monthly gains.\n\nThe approval news of the first Bitcoin spot ETF is spreading like wildfire in the crypto industry. And, it is already showing strong signs of impact on all major cryptocurrencies including Ethereum Classic. Let us learn more about what is happening in the industry and why ETC is going up, in the present article.\n\nBitcoin Spot ETF Approved, Finally\n\nThe long-awaited Bitcoin spot ETF was finally approved by the US SEC on 10 January, 2024. Entire crypto industry has been waiting for this news for several months. And, now that it is finally approved, several altcoins and Bitcoin are following an uptrend.\n\nThe anticipation of the Bitcoin ETF approval has itself brought considerable returns for Bitcoin since the past couple of months. From around $26,600 in October, 2023, Bitcoin\u2019s value breached the $45,000 mark as soon as we entered January, 2024.\n\nWhile one of the strong reasons behind this price rally was the awaiting Bitcoin spot ETF approval, another reason is the upcoming Bitcoin halving event.\n\nAs the US SEC final judgment approached, a fake post was posted from the official X account. This caused a sharp price spike in the BTC chart. However, Gary Gensler, chair of the US SEC clarified that the US SEC account was hacked and the ETF approval post was posted by unauthorized individuals. As Gary Gensler stated that the post was fake, the BTC price dropped around 5% within a couple of hours.\n\nHowever, the US SEC finally approved the Bitcoin spot ETF application of Grayscale Investments. As a result, several altcoins like Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, Pepe Coin, and others are rising in value.\n\nEthereum Hits 20-Month High\n\nEthereum Price Chart on Jan 11, 2024\n\nSurprisingly, the Bitcoin spot ETF approval has more impact on altcoins when compared to Bitcoin. The BTC price rose slightly and briefly touched the $47,000 mark whereas the Ether price increased by around 10% in the last 24 hours and is trading above $2,600, at the time of writing.\n\nEthereum has hit its 20-month high as the last time it traded above $2,600 was in May, 2022. At present, Ethereum price is recording 18% weekly gains and 16% monthly gains. And, the ETH price is expected to rise further.\n\nMost of the investors believe that Ethereum is the next best cryptocurrency after Bitcoin. Because of its sophisticated technology and network upgrades Ethereum stands out from the rest of the cryptocurrencies. And, investors don\u2019t hesitate when it comes to Ethereum in the market conditions like present.\n\nEthereum Classic to Reach the $30 Mark\n\nEthereum Classic Price Chart on Jan 11, 2024\n\nThe clear winner among all the altcoins is Ethereum Classic. The ETC price rose by 34% in the last 24 hours and is showing no signs of slowing down with its increasing trading volume. It is currently trading at around $28 and is just $2 away from reaching the $30 mark.\n\nSo far, Ethereum Classic is one of the top performing altcoins in the crypto industry after the Bitcoin spot ETF approval surfaced. In addition to the price, its trading volume is soaring by 276%, standing at $1.8 billion and implying that the price could surge further. Its market capitalization also surged by 34% and crossed the $4 billion mark today.\n\nThe approval of the Bitcoin spot ETF and the upcoming Bitcoin halving event are not only pushing the BTC price but also the prices of altcoins."

        "title": "Why Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin Are on the Move Higher Today - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "It's finally here. The long-awaited spot Bitcoin (BTC 1.93%) ETF has been approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), with 11 spot exchange-traded products officially getting the nod from regulators, after years of denials and a very hawkish regulatory stance. Since the Winkelvoss twins first proposed a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in 2013, investors have effectively been waiting for more than a decade for this product to be launched.\n\nBitcoin briefly surged to nearly $49,000 per token following this announcement, the highest level it's seen in almost two years. Ethereum (ETH 1.09%) and Dogecoin (DOGE 5.05%) saw similar spikes this morning, but have since given up some of these gains. As of 1 p.m. ET, Bitcoin is currently trading flat (having seen a big boost in its valuation yesterday prior to this announcement), but Ethereum and Dogecoin are 6.2% and 7.7% higher over the past 24 hours.\n\nLet's dive into what this approval means for Bitcoin and other top-tier cryptocurrencies right now.\n\nWhat does this spot Bitcoin ETF approval mean for the crypto sector?\n\nThe potential impacts of this approval on Bitcoin are notable. A range of estimates for how much capital could flow into these ETFs has been put forward, but Standard Charter believes that number could be as high as $100 billion. That's a tremendous amount of money, and certainly could change the investing landscape for institutional funds looking to diversify their portfolios into these asset classes.\n\nThe SEC's official approval of a swath of ETFs could pave the way for future spot Ethereum exchange-traded products to be launched. That's a key driver of enthusiasm around the world's second-largest cryptocurrency, with Dogecoin rallying as it usually does in tandem with the sector, in a familiar higher-volatility fashion today.\n\nThe 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs approved by regulators include: Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, iShares Bitcoin Trust, Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund, Ark 21Shares Bitcoin Trust, Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF, VanEck Bitcoin Trust, WisdomTree Bitcoin Trust, Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust, Bitwise Bitcoin ETF, Franklin Bitcoin ETF, and Hashdex Bitcoin ETF. These funds are now trading, and are seeing mixed performance.\n\nSome of this divergence among Bitcoin exchange-traded funds can be linked to the rather wide range of fees offered by providers. Updated pricing provided by a number of funds ahead of today's approvals show many ETFs dropping fees substantially, to as low as 0.2%. Given the similar nature of each of these funds, that could indicate a race to the bottom in terms of management fees, which is great for investors.\n\nNotably, crypto traders betting against Bitcoin have lost a substantial amount of money in the derivatives market. Estimates suggest closed short positions cost bears around $100 million.\n\nIs now the time to buy a Bitcoin ETF?\n\nThe value these ETFs provide is notable. Bitcoin, as representative of crypto and digital assets as whole, gains legitimacy in the eyes of many investors. Additionally, investors now don't have to go through the trouble of setting up a wallet, researching how blockchain technology works, and jumping through what can be perceived as too many hoops to invest in crypto.\n\nFor institutional investors, these ETFs also provide liquidity, allowing for seamless integration within their portfolios, and allowing for things like model portfolios (which are investment products tailored to specific investors) to include some proportion of crypto. Being able to readily trade Bitcoin on the open markets is a big deal for asset managers, and I think the market is correct to assume this will lead to a tsunami of cash headed into this space.\n\nEthereum's prospects in terms of getting proposed spot ETFs approved may be more murky. Given the incredibly long lag between proposals and approvals for Bitcoin ETFs, these products could still have a ways to go. That said, these approvals do provide a blueprint for regulators looking at spot Ethereum ETFs, and given the SEC's rather favorable stance toward both Bitcoin and Ethereum, one might certainly surmise that the probability of future approvals has increased over the past 24 hours.\n\nAs is the case with many asset classes, investing in ETFs has its pros and cons. For those comfortable with buying Bitcoin directly, saving even 20 basis points each year can add up over the long term. That said, for those seeking simplicity and convenience, these products certainly look more intriguing than involving oneself in the rigmarole around buying and selling Bitcoin on exchanges. Personally, I think a race to the bottom in fees could make Bitcoin ETFs the preferred investing option for most investors, and I think these are certainly worth considering right now."

        "content": "A passionate cryptocurrency and blockchain author qualified to cover every event in the crypto space. Researching minute occurrences and bringing new insights lie within the prime focus of my task.\n\nStory Highlights Ethereum is displaying extreme strength against Bitcoin, which suggests the token is extremely bullish in the mid-term\n\nBesides, Bitcoin's dominance experienced a fake-out after a channel breakout, which is an extremely bullish sign for altcoins\n\nThe Ethereum price displayed an epic retest after marking the daily highs above $2600. Besides, the trading volume on the previous trading day was the highest since November 2022, which elevated the levels by more than 10%. While the ETH price is pumping against Bitcoin because of bullish BTC events, it appears that the Ethereum ecosystem is heavily taking off. After marking new highs, there is a huge possibility of a bearish pullback below $2500 before triggering a fresh upswing.\n\nThe ETH price has maintained a decent upswing since the last few days of October, elevating over 70% from the interim lows of around $1522. The recent price action caused the price to pierce through the crucial resistance zone between $2400 and $2500 and closed the previous day\u2019s trade beyond $2600. Moreover, the value sustained above $2600 at press time suggests the bulls have jumped in action, and hence the target at $3000 has now been activated.\n\nAfter consolidating between the $2150 and $2400 price ranges for over a month, the ETH price broke up and reached a high above the $2600 mark. The token is experiencing a minor pullback at the moment, which could be quickly overcome by giant bullish action soon. Being different from the previous price action, the ETH price is expected to hit $2500 any time from now on. The RSI has still not marked highs above the resistance, and the price soared above the crucial resistance, indicating the bullish momentum may prevail for a long time.\n\nThe upward momentum may lift the price beyond the next target at around $2800 in the next few days, but before hitting the milestone at $3000, bulls could lose their momentum. This is when a bearish divergence in RSI will be recorded, which may compel the price to initiate a fresh descending trend. However, the current resistance zone between $2400 & $2500 may act as a strong support base, which may hold and trigger a healthy rebound soon.\n\nTherefore, the next couple of days may be extremely crucial for the Ethereum (ETH) price, as a bullish weekly close may squash the bearish narrative."

        "title": "Why Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum Classic, and Litecoin Are Surging Today - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "The entire crypto world has been shaken, in a positive way, by recent developments around yesterday's approval of certain exchange-traded products. For Bitcoin Cash (BCH -3.65%), Ethereum Classic (ETC -0.50%), and Litecoin (LTC -1.44%), broadly positive sectorwide sentiment appears to be a key driver behind these tokens' impressive moves higher. As of 2 p.m. ET, these three tokens have rocketed 13.9%, 34.3%, and 6.3%, respectively, over the past 24 hours.\n\nThe approvals of 11 spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) yesterday by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has undoubtedly led to significant interest across the cryptocurrency sector today. Much of today's increase can be attributed to expectations that institutional capital will flow into this sector in dramatic fashion. In fact, projections from some analysts peg the impact of these approvals at around $100 billion. That's a win not only for Bitcoin, but for investors considering this entire space, as it legitimizes crypto for institutional and retail investors alike.\n\nLet's dive into what's behind the specific moves in these three cryptos today, over and above the obviously bullish headline news dominating the market right now.\n\nWhy are these three tokens surging today?\n\nFor Bitcoin Cash, a peer-to-peer electronic cash system tied closely to Bitcoin, today's news is obviously a net positive for this network. However, there are other key drivers supporting Bitcoin Cash's recent performance. News that cryptocurrency payments have surged to a record high in 2024 is very bullish for the likes of Bitcoin cash and other payments-focused cryptocurrencies. A report on Jan. 10 cited that nearly 1.3 million Bitcoin transactions were reportedly processed in 2023 alone, bringing the total number of Bitcoin transactions to more than 4 million. For those bullish on crypto as a payments facilitation technology, this is a strong catalyst to consider for Bitcoin Cash.\n\nFor Ethereum classic, the proof-of-work fork of the Ethereum blockchain, excitement around the potential approval for spot Ethereum ETF approvals appears to be driving interest in this adjacent token. Essentially, investors and traders appear to be speculating on a potential hard fork for Ethereum Classic, which would better align the network with Ethereum's, and improve its outlook (if Ethereum surges as a result of ETF approvals, one could argue Ethereum Classic could be due for a rally as well). Of course, such a substantial move of more than 30% may be overdone, so this will certainly be a token traders focus in on in the coming days.\n\nLitecoin's more muted rise today appears to be tied more to sector-specific tailwinds than anything else. Largely viewed as a Bitcoin and Ethereum alternative, this is a token that typically rides the tides higher and lower over specific time frames. Right now, there's a rising tide lifting most boats in this sector, and Litecoin investors are certainly pleased to see momentum taking this token higher over the past 24 hours.\n\nIs this momentum sustainable?\n\nUltimately, we'll have to see if these spot ETF approvals are a \"sell the news\" event, or a strong catalyst that puts a floor beneath crypto prices for the foreseeable future. In many respects, we won't know which outcome will materialize until after the fact. Thus, some amount of hesitation may lead to a waiting period for certain long-term investors, and could present an opportunity for buyers considering these tokens to jump in and ride momentum higher over the medium term.\n\nOverall, I think yesterday's spot ETF approvals are a bullish catalyst for the sector. For one, these approvals legitimize crypto as an asset class institutional investors can buy into. Another key factor driving sectorwide interest is the flurry of institutional capital expected for large-cap cryptos. Accordingly, for those seeking exposure to these trends, and looking for less-visible (and potentially higher-upside) ways to play crypto, these three tokens will likely continue to be in focus in the coming weeks."

His expertise lies in his ability to use both technical and fundamental analysis to make informed predictions about the future direction of cryptocurrency prices. He has a strong understanding of market sentiment and uses this to inform his trading decisions and price predictions.\n\nAfter the approval of a Bitcoin ETF, the Ethereum based tokens, surged to its highest point since May 2022. This increase is attributed to investor speculation that an Ether (ETH) ETF will soon receive approval from the SEC.\n\nThe Ethereum markets experienced substantial growth during Thursday\u2019s session, driven by strong buying interest. This trend suggests that the broader cryptocurrency market might be on the verge of a more significant movement. ETH Price is expected to gain substantially from this momentum.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction 2024 :\n\nThe renowned cryptocurrency expert Anthony Sano has recently expressed an extremely bullish outlook on Ethereum Price Prediction for 2024. In a detailed analysis, he predicted Ethereum\u2019s potential to reach a staggering $10,000 mark within the year.\n\nHe highlighted the significance of Ethereum\u2019s ability to offer yield through staking, a feature he believes gives it an edge over Bitcoin and makes it particularly attractive to institutions. With the increasing likelihood of an Ethereum ETF launching in mid-2024, he anticipates a surge in institutional interest.\n\nComparing Ethereum\u2019s performance with that of Solana, he pointed out that despite Solana\u2019s significant drop and subsequent recovery, Ethereum has maintained a consistent value over the year.\n\noverall, his predictions for 2024 range from a conservative $6,000 to a staggering $10,000, if the market hype intensify, particularly with the advent of the ETF."

The SEC's approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF Wednesday followed days of confusion, including a fake tweet posted by the \"compromised\" SEC Twitter account on Tuesday.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSeveral hopefuls have filed applications for a spot Ethereum ETF with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including Ark 21Shares, BlackRock, Fidelity and Grayscale.\n\nThe SEC's approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF was a long time coming, but traders are betting that an Ethereum ETF might be quicker to market.\n\nBloomberg Intelligence's ETF analyst Eric Balchunas reportedly pointed to a 70% chance of an Ethereum ETF being approved by May, the SEC's final deadline for a decision on multiple spot Ethereum ETF applications. Balchunas noted that he had heard \u201con the back channels\u201d that spot Ethereum ETFs \u201cwill be fine.\u201d\n\nSEC chair Gary Gensler has repeatedly refused to confirm whether the regulator considers Ethereum a security or a commodity.\n\nPrior to taking up his post at the SEC, Gensler himself stated that the regulator considered Ethereum \"sufficiently decentralized\" that it doesn't qualify as a security. At the time, Gensler appeared to be referencing the views of SEC's former Director of Corporate Finance William Hinman, expressed in a much-cited June 2018 speech.\n\nAD\n\nAD"

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nFollowing the SEC\u2019s approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, it looks more likely that the regulator will allow spot Ether funds too.\n\nAfter that, asset managers could turn their attention to altcoins like XRP.\n\nHowever, the regulator is unlikely to allow XRP ETFs while it is battling Ripple in court.\n\nNow that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has finally ended its longstanding resistance to spot Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs), it raises the prospect that it might accept other types of crypto funds too.\n\nSeveral of the asset managers recently granted permission to launch Bitcoin ETFs have already submitted proposals for spot Ether funds. But why stop there? After Ethereum, XRP could emerge as the next crypto ETF frontier.\n\nVanEck CEO Eyes Ripple ETF\n\nIn a recent interview, Valkyrie CIO Steve McClurg suggested that asset managers are eager to branch out into other cryptocurrencies after the approval of Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nWithout digressing what VanEck planned to do next, he said: \u201cI think we\u2019re going to see a lot of filings come out for Ethereum. I even think we might see something for Ripple, given the recent progress.\u201d\n\nEchoing McClurg\u2019s comments, Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart also believes that XRP is the next most likely ETF prospect after Bitcoin and Ether. However, he acknowledged that Ripple\u2019s ongoing legal troubles will probably hold up progress.\n\nXRP Funds Unlikely Until Ripple Lawsuit Concluded\n\nObserving that Ethereum ETFs could be approved in the coming months, Seyffart suggested that the SEC would be unlikely to accept XRP funds while it is in the middle of a court battle with Ripple. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s happening this year unless the court case is completely done,\u201d he said.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, whereas spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs were preceded by funds that invest in crypto futures, there is no equivalent precedent for XRP. Observing that the existence of Bitcoin and Ether futures ETFs strengthens the argument for letting funds hold the cryptocurrencies directly, Seyffart noted that \u201cwe don\u2019t have any of that for Ripple.\u201d"

His expertise lies in his ability to use both technical and fundamental analysis to make informed predictions about the future direction of cryptocurrency prices. He has a strong understanding of market sentiment and uses this to inform his trading decisions and price predictions.\n\nOn January 10, 2024, the SEC approved all Bitcoin Spot ETFs. The first regulated spot, Bitcoin Exchange-traded-funds (ETF), was approved by the SEC a few hours after its fake release, causing $300 Million in Bitcoin liquidation within a few hours.\n\nETF Approval, Opens ETH Gateways to $2800!\n\nOn top of this huge development, Ethereum (ETH) is currently exhibiting notable strength, surpassing Bitcoin\u2019s performance with an 8% surge, driven by the mounting anticipation surrounding the potential approval of spot Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs).\n\nNow that the outcome of Bitcoin ETF approvals is out, there is a growing expectation from analysts that Ethereum might experience a similar trend. Numerous institutions have already submitted applications for spot Ethereum ETFs, contributing to a supply shock as funds pour into the Ethereum market in anticipation of a potential ETF launch.\n\nETH\u2019s price action shows a bullish flag pattern due to consolidation between $2200 support and $2400 resistance. Buyer enthusiasm rises as Ethereum breaks out, suggesting a bullish 2024.\n\nSo, what\u2019s the deal? Is this correction a dip you should buy? Will Ethereum go up?\n\nTechnical, On-Chain Metrics Say\u2019s Possible but with a Twist\u2026\n\nTechnically, Ethereum\u2019s price is navigating within an ascending parallel channel, indicating a bullish stance and the possibility of reclaiming the $2,457 range high. This upward momentum could propel ETH towards the $2,800 level, marking a substantial 15% increase from its current levels. In an exceptionally bullish scenario, Ethereum might even reach the $3000, indicating a 25% surge.\n\nSupporting this optimistic outlook are various on-chain metrics. Santiment\u2019s daily active addresses metric reveals a consistent increase in crowd interaction with Ethereum, reflected in the rise of daily active addresses from 387,000 to 413,000 in under a month\u2014a 6.7% growth. Additionally, whale transactions involving transfers of $100,000 and above have experienced a notable uptick, underlining heightened investor interest.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s crucial to acknowledge the potential for correction, especially if bears take control. A downside correction could lead to ETH losing support at $2,388. In a more adverse scenario, a prolonged decline might push the proof-of-stake (PoS) token down to $2,135, signaling a potential shift in the prevailing bullish sentiment if a lower low is established. Overall, Ethereum\u2019s current dynamics are intricately tied to the broader market sentiment and developments surrounding Bitcoin ETF approvals."

        "content": "What Happened in Crypto Today: Ethereum ETFs To Be Approved by May?\n\nAfter days of volatility and months of uncertainty, the SEC finally approved the first Bitcoin spot ETF. And as K33 Research expected, this long-awaited move did not become a \"sell the news\" event, as much of the leverage had already been shaken out last week.\n\nNow that this regulatory barrier has come down, we look ahead to what other opportunities may open up in crypto. But before we gaze too far into the horizon, let's recap today\u2019s top crypto news stories.\n\nTLDR:\n\nSEC approves first-ever spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\n\nFund issuers engage in battle royale for BTC ETF market share, slashing fees \ud83d\udde1\ufe0f\n\nGensler offers warnings despite approving BTC ETFs \ud83d\udea8\n\nUK central banker criticizes BTC's value and efficiency \ud83d\ude10\n\nEthereum ETF approval odds look good for May \ud83e\udd1e\n\nRipple announces $785M stock buyback plan \ud83d\udcb0\n\nNow let's dive deeper into each of those topics\u2026\n\nBTC Spot ETF Approved fr! \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\n\nFirst, the most important news\u2026\n\nIt finally happened - the SEC approved not just one, but ELEVEN spot Bitcoin ETFs!\n\nThis mass greenlighting came on the expected deadline after months of bottled-up anticipation.\n\nFinancial giants like BlackRock, ARK Invest, Invesco and more now have the all-clear for their BTC funds. Even Grayscale's Bitcoin Trust secured conversion authority!\n\nOf course, Gary Gensler couldn't resist throwing some shade amidst his agency's watershed Bitcoin moment. Despite the reversal, he shilled the same old \"illicit activity\" \ud83d\ude44(we will cover this one in detail).\n\nETF approval unlocks billions (or maybe trillions) in fresh institutional capital and mainstream accessibility.\n\nSo is it going to impact BTC\u2019s price eventually? Read the full story!\n\nThe Hunger Games (ETF Edition) \ud83d\udde1\n\nAnd the battle royale begins! After the SEC finally (and reluctantly) approved Bitcoin spot ETFs, fund issuers drew swords to compete over market share.\n\nAnd their chosen weapon? Significant fee cuts to attract capital inflows!\n\nStory continues\n\nBlackRock led the charge - dropping its ratio to 0.25% after originally demanding a 0.3% fee.\n\nNot to be outdone - ARK Invest, 21Shares, Bitwise and Valkyrie matched with reductions down to 0.2% or lower.\n\nOf course, one player remains the elephant in the room - Grayscale still demands 1.5% with its $28 billion GBTC AUM.\n\nWhat does this fee war indicate? Is it going to help crypto in any way? Read the full story!\n\nGensler\u2019s Warnings Continue \ud83d\udea8\n\nThe chief regulator couldn't resist throwing some shade on the assets underlying these new funds. Gensler emphasized the SEC does NOT endorse Bitcoin itself following approvals.

        "content": "Rep. Mike Collins discloses purchasing up to $65,000 in Ethereum in early 2024, amid market surges and political events. His actions, while legal under the STOCK Act, raise questions about ethical implications and the need for stricter regulations in lawmakers' digital asset investments.\n\nUS Georgia Representative Mike Collins disclosed investments totaling up to $65,000 in Ethereum (ETH) in early 2024. This disclosure, filed on January 9 with the House\u2019s Financial Disclosure Reports Database, includes purchases of $15,000 on January 3 and $50,000 on January 8, adding to his total ETH investments of approximately $110,000 since 2023\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b.\n\nCollins' engagement with Ethereum, a leading cryptocurrency, aligns with his ongoing investments in digital assets. The STOCK Act, a regulatory framework designed to prevent conflicts of interest, mandates such disclosures by US lawmakers. However, it does not prohibit them from overseeing legislation potentially related to their investments, which has been a point of contention and debate regarding the intersection of personal wealth and public service responsibilities\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b.\n\nThe timing of Collins\u2019 investments coincides with a notable surge in Ethereum's price, which experienced an 11% increase in early January 2024. This market behavior is partly attributed to anticipations surrounding the SEC's potential approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF, a development that could have broader implications for the cryptocurrency market\u200b\u200b.\n\nThese financial activities occur against a backdrop of significant political events, including the looming possibility of a US government shutdown and the commencement of the 2024 presidential campaign. The intersection of these political dynamics with market movements underscores the complex relationship between governmental actions and financial markets, particularly in the realm of cryptocurrencies\u200b\u200b.\n\nThis development also highlights the broader trend of lawmakers engaging in cryptocurrency investments, reflecting the growing integration of digital assets into mainstream financial practices. However, it raises questions about the need for more stringent regulatory frameworks to ensure transparency and prevent potential conflicts of interest. The ongoing debates in this arena suggest a growing recognition of the unique challenges posed by the intersection of digital assets and political governance.\n\nImage source: Shutterstock"

        "content": "Fake Airdrop for Ethereum, Solana, Tron Users Carried out by Scammers\n\nHackers target the Ethereum, Solana, and Tron crypto communities by enticing them with a fake airdrop scheme.\n\nWallet drainers, previously fixated on executing crypto scams via EVM chains, have now expanded their horizons to target Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and Tron (TRX) communities.\n\nThis shift marks a concerning trend as these scammers venture into well-established crypto groups.\n\nPhishing Scams via Fake Airdrops\n\nThe modus operandi involves enticing crypto enthusiasts through fraudulent airdrops. The scammers create a webpage where users can supposedly claim Ethereum, Solana, and Tron airdrop rewards.\n\nThese scams are labeled an \"exclusive opportunity\" for the community, urging individuals to link their primary wallets for access. Scam Sniffer highlights that these fraudsters can drain various crypto wallets using this deceptive webpage.\n\nAccording to CoinGape, this development is particularly problematic given the popularity of Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, alongside Solana and Tron.\n\nThe lure of substantial crypto rewards might mislead investors, potentially resulting in significant losses amounting to millions or even billions in digital assets due to these wallet drainer scams.\n\nIdentifying and Avoiding Crypto Scams\n\nWhile scammers occasionally upgrade their strategies, identifying potential scams can still be achieved through simple checks.\n\nAccording to Blockworks, Scam Sniffer's shared snapshot reveals grammatical errors on the fraudulent airdrop webpage, serving as a red flag for cautious users. However, it's crucial to remain vigilant as scammers adapt and refine their tactics over time.\n\nTo stay secure, always verify the source of such links. If a reputable entity is not the source of the airdrop updates, it is advisable to steer clear of such offerings.\n\nFurthermore, heightened caution is necessary, considering recent incidents where hackers compromised verified X accounts of well-known companies like Certik and Mandiant to promote crypto scams.\n\nEarlier this month, Certik experienced a similar attack on its X account, followed by Mandiant on January 4, 2024, raising concerns about the security of even the most established platforms.\n\nPhoto: Nahel Abdul Hadi / Unsplash\n\nTokenPost | [email protected]"

        "content": "Qadir Ak is the founder of Coinpedia. He has over a decade of experience writing about technology and has been covering the blockchain and cryptocurrency space since 2010. He has also interviewed a few prominent experts within the cryptocurrency space.\n\nWith Bitcoin ETFs finally approved, and the call for spot ETH ETFs rising, Ethereum is now standing at the threshold of a potential surge, with pivotal developments setting the stage for a remarkable bull in January. The imminent activation of the Dencun upgrade, known as the protodanksharding upgrade or EIP-4844, on the Goerli testnet on January 17 is poised to be a game-changer.\n\nEIP-4844: Unleashing Efficiency\n\nThe Dencun upgrade, specifically EIP-4844, aims to cut Layer 2 transaction fees on Ethereum by introducing \u201cdata blobs\u201d \u2013 sizable data pieces linked to Ethereum blocks and rollups. This innovation enhances efficiency and lowers transaction costs within the Layer 2 scaling solution.\n\nBy implementing EIP-4844, Ethereum looks forward to freeing up Ethereum\u2019s processing capacity, streamlining operations, and enabling rollups to handle transactions at a much lower cost.\n\nThe Expected Bullish Storm\n\nEthereum is on a positive trajectory, surging to $2,500 after the SEC approved the Spot Bitcoin ETF. Keeping steady above key levels like the 50-day and 200-day Exponential Moving Averages at $2,231 and $1,959, analysts now set their sights on a promising target: the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement level at $3,004.\n\nAs Ethereum gears up with the Dencun upgrade, the optimistic market sentiment following the approval of the Spot Bitcoin ETF has made investors eagerly wait for a potential 50% surge within reach in January."

        "content": "In the weekly chart analysis, Ethereum Classic (ETC) has shown a departure from the lower high formation that characterized the previous bearish trend until 2022. After a year-long consolidation range throughout 2023, ETC struggled to surpass the resistance at $23.\n\nA recent resurgence, however, has resulted in a bullish breakout from the consolidation range, signaling a notable trend reversal for Ethereum Classic. This breakout is seen as a significant entry point for traders on the sidelines.\n\nThe heightened market activity has contributed to a remarkable 250% increase in the 24-hour trading volume, supporting the sharp upward movement and hinting at the potential continuation of an uptrend. Currently trading at $28.43, Ethereum Classic has formed a bullish engulfing candle in the daily chart.\n\nThe breakthrough above the $25 barrier positions Ethereum Classic for a sustained bullish rally. The rising sentiment in the market is fostering increased risk appetite among investors, contributing to the broader uptrend in the altcoin market.\n\nUnder favorable market conditions, Ethereum Classic\u2019s price trajectory may lead to a breakout beyond multiple resistance levels, with a potential target of $40 on the horizon. However, should ETC struggle to maintain its momentum, a retest of the $25 level could be in the cards. Traders and investors are closely monitoring market dynamics to gauge the sustainability of Ethereum Classic\u2019s current bullish momentum."

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) continued its upward trajectory Wednesday, clocking a 10% gain in 24 hours to breach past the vaunted $2,600 mark. Market watchers attribute this surge to a confluence of factors, primarily fueled by anticipation of a forthcoming Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the wake of the expected approval for a Bitcoin ETF in the US.\n\nIn a historic move that cryptocurrency aficionados hope will bring more individual and institutional investors into the market, the US Securities and Exchange Commission has approved the first spot bitcoin exchange traded funds on Thursday.\n\nEthereum ETF Buzz Sparks Strategic Moves\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a noticeable trend towards frontrunning the ether ETF,\u201d noted Alex Onufriychuk, CEO of Kaminari, in a Telegram message. This sentiment aligns with the prevailing belief that Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, would be the next candidate for an ETF after Bitcoin.\n\nAdding fuel to the fire, a prominent investor, dubbed a \u201cwhale\u201d in the crypto universe, made a strategic move by transferring 9,705 ETH (nearly $23 million) from Binance to Compound. This was followed by a 12 million Tether (USDT) loan, seemingly used to further accumulate ETH. The whale subsequently executed three profitable ETH transactions, netting roughly $5 million.\n\nThis decisive action signaled two things: confidence in Ethereum\u2019s future and the potential for profit-taking, which could introduce short-term volatility. Despite the risk, the whale\u2019s activity bolstered positive market sentiment.\n\nEthereum currently trading at $2,607.8 on the daily chart: TradingView.com\n\nFurther validating this optimism, Ethereum\u2019s network metrics experienced a surge. Both network growth and token velocity saw increases, indicating heightened interest from new addresses and more token movement. These on-chain metrics paint a promising picture for ETH\u2019s future.\n\nETH Futures Surge Amid ETF Optimism\n\nAlso adding to the bullish case, Open Interest for ETH futures contracts jumped 15% in recent days, reaching $4.57 billion at the time of writing. This signifies more traders entering the market and anticipating significant price gains following a potential ETF approval.\n\nEthereum vs. Bitcoin Open Interest | Source: Velo Data\n\nAccording to reports, crypto traders expect Ethereum\u2019s price to rise after a favorable ETF judgment, even though Bitcoin is getting more attention in the media. If this situation plays out, the price of ETH could soon go beyond $2,600.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s crucial to remember that the cryptocurrency market remains volatile, and unforeseen factors could still impact prices.\n\nThe timeline for an Ethereum ETF approval is uncertain, and regulatory hurdles could create delays. Additionally, broader market conditions and news on Ethereum development could also play a role.\n\nInvestors should carefully consider their risk tolerance and conduct thorough research before making any investment decisions, particularly in the dynamic and unpredictable world of cryptocurrencies.\n\nFeatured image from Medium\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Bitcoin briefly reached $47,000 in a subdued ascent following the approval by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission of Bitcoin ETFs directly investing in the token. Traders are now monitoring the products to assess their financial impact. While Bitcoin gains stay limited, Ethereum (ETH) and other altcoins have registered maximum gains after the ETF approval.\n\nEthereum Investors Cheer the ETF approval\n\nSoon after the news of Bitcoin ETF approval, the Ethereum (ETH) price surged by a staggering shooting past $2,600 levels. Several market analysts have already predicted that ETH is likely to outperform BTC in Q1 2024.\n\nadvertisement\n\nAs Ether experienced a notable surge, its positive momentum extended to other cryptocurrencies within the Ethereum ecosystem. Tokens affiliated with Polygon observed a 13% increase, Chainlink saw an 11% advance, and Uniswap registered an impressive 14% surge.\n\nThe speculation around a Bitcoin ETF becoming a reality has prompted a shift in trader focus towards Ether, anticipating the next narrative of an Ethereum ETF. Conor Ryder, Head of Research at stablecoin company Ethena Labs, notes that with Ether appearing relatively inexpensive compared to most other tokens, traders are strategically positioning themselves in anticipation of developments in the Ethereum space.\n\nLooking ahead, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is slated to make decisions on spot Ethereum ETF applications starting in May. Major players such as BlackRock, Invesco, Ark, VanEck, and Grayscale, seeking to convert its existing Ethereum Trust (ETHE) into an ETF, are among the firms awaiting approval. Speaking to CNBC, Ryder added:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about getting ahead of the narratives \u2014 bitcoin has rallied versus ether for the last six months thanks to spot ETF speculation, and ETF approval ties a bow on that narrative. Meanwhile ETH has struggled to find any momentum and has underperformed compared to most of the smaller Layer 1s,\u201d or blockchain networks, like Solana and Cardano\u201d.\n\nOver the last 24 hours, ETH has experienced a surge of over 10%, contrasting with a general decline in Ethereum NFTs. Notably, Moonbirds has witnessed a drop exceeding 23%, marking its first instance below 1 ETH in history. Additionally, MAYC has seen a decrease of more than 6%, with approximately 290 MAYC currently in Blend liquidation auction status.\n\nAltcoins Join the Party\n\nApart from Ethereum, other altcoins like Cardano have also joined the party. The Cardano (ADA) price is up 12.48% and is currently trading at $0.58 with a market cap of $20.5 billion. As per the breakout on the technical chart, the ADA price can rally all the way to $1 this year.\n\nAt the same time, the Avalanche (AVAX) and Polkadot (DOT) prices are also up by 11.47% and 14.6% respectively."

This surge not only surpasses the performance of major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum but also positions Ethereum Classic as the top performer among the 100 leading cryptocurrencies by market cap presently.\n\nRemarkable Rally of Ethereum Classic\n\nWhile Bitcoin recorded a modest 1% increase and Ethereum observed a substantial rise of over 9% in the last 24 hours, ETC\u2019s surge has garnered significant attention. This noteworthy upward movement in price has elevated ETC to a prominent position. It has further established it as the leading performer among the top 100.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s recent upswing, triggered by the announcement of a Bitcoin ETF, has propelled its value beyond the $26 mark for the first time since October 2022. The accompanying surge in trading volume indicates considerable interest from major traders.\n\nAlso Read: Robinhood CEO Announces Plan to List Bitcoin ETF Soon\n\nSustainability of Ethereum Classic\u2019s Momentum\n\nThe crucial question on everyone\u2019s mind is whether ETC can maintain its impressive momentum. According to Changelly, a cryptocurrency exchange platform, ETC is anticipated to stay in positive territory over the next few days. The altcoin is predicted to reach as high as $22.59 on Saturday, Jan. 12, following a 5% daily surge. The average anticipated percentage surge for Ethereum Classic in the upcoming days ranges between 3-5%.\n\nSurging Trading Volumes and Neutral Market Sentiment\n\nIn tandem with Ethereum Classic\u2019s surge, there has been a significant spike in trading volumes. It escalated by 234% within a single day and reached a total of $1.54 billion. Despite these substantial movements in price and volume, the overall sentiment surrounding the Ethereum Classic remains neutral. This was indicated by on-chain data provided by Santiment.\n\nInvestor Watch: Monitoring Ethereum Classic Market Developments\n\nInvestors are closely monitoring the developments in the Ethereum Classic market. This is especially true in the aftermath of recent Bitcoin-related news that has stirred the cryptocurrency landscape. As Ethereum Classic continues to defy market expectations, its impressive surge and heightened trading volumes have captured the attention of enthusiasts.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum Breaches $2,400 While BTC Bleeds, Will ETH Hit $3,000 Soon?\n\nThe recent 34% surge of Ethereum Classic serves as a testament to the dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency market.

Investors are advised to remain vigilant, stay informed about the evolving cryptocurrency landscape, and closely monitor any subsequent news that may impact Ethereum Classic\u2019s trajectory."

        "content": "Elena is an expert in technical analysis and risk management in cryptocurrency market. She has 10+year experience in writing - accordingly she is avid journalists with a passion towards researching new insights coming into crypto erena.\n\nThe crypto industry starts the day with a strong bullish sentiment as the SEC has given the approval of the Spot Bitcoin ETF which resulted in the market displaying significant price action. Further, the leader of altcoins, ETH has added over 8% to its portfolio over the past day.\n\nThe Ethereum price traded in a consolidated range between $2,248 and $2,137 for a while, following which the market gained momentum and the price successfully broke out of the range.\n\nHowever, the rally was short-lived as the price faced rejection at $2,342, after which the ETH coin price traded under a bearish sentiment and experienced a pullback within the range. After multiple attempts, the bulls regained momentum and jumped over 11% in its valuation.\n\nTradingView: ETH/USDT\n\nAfter facing a price restriction of $2,450, the star altcoin displayed significant price volatility and after a second failed attempt to break out of the resistance, the bulls lost momentum and recorded a correction of over 10%.\n\nFollowing this, the price traded in a narrow space between $2,200 and $2,300 for a period, after which the bulls regained momentum and successfully broke out of the range. Recently, the price experienced a jump of over 16%, indicating a strong bullish sentiment in the market.\n\nThe technical indicator, MACD, displays a constant rise in the green histogram, indicating increased buying-over-selling pressure in the market. Further, the averages show a significant uptrend, suggesting a bullpower in the space.\n\nWill Ethereum Rise Back Up?\n\nIf the bulls push the price above the resistance level of $2,615, the ETH price will regain momentum and test its upper resistance level of $2,700. Maintaining the price at that level will set the stage for the ETH price to attempt to test its resistance level of $2,750 in the coming time.\n\nNegatively, if the bears overpowered the bulls, the ETH price will lose momentum and fall to test its support level of $2,500. Moreover, if the negative reversal occurs, the Ethereum price will plunge and prepare to test its lower support level of $2,450 by the weekend."

        "title": "Ethereum ETF Countdown: Analysts Optimistic on Potential Approval This Year - Coinspeaker",
        "content": "The SEC faces deadlines ranging from May 23 to August 7 to make decisions on Ethereum ETF applications.\n\nThe crypto market is buzzing with expectations as analysts predict a high likelihood of the approval of Ethereum (ETH) Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) in the coming months.\n\nAnalysts\u2019 Confidence and Comparisons with Bitcoin\n\nEric Balchunas, a notable ETF analyst at Bloomberg, has expressed optimism, estimating a 70% chance of approving an Ethereum spot ETF by May. This potential approval could have huge implications for the crypto market, as Ethereum continues gaining attention from institutional and retail investors.\n\nBalchunas draws parallels between Ethereum and Bitcoin, stating that he couldn\u2019t envision a scenario where spot Bitcoin ETFs are approved while spot Ether ETFs are not. He emphasized the interconnected nature of the two cryptocurrencies, noting that \u201cEther spot is tied to the hip of Bitcoin spot\u201d.\n\nBalchunas, who has reportedly heard positive signals through informal channels, believes that spot Ethereum ETFs \u201cwill be fine\u201d. Balchunas\u2019 70% probability is worth taking note off. This is because the approval odds issued on spot Bitcoin ETFs last year turned out positive.\n\nAdding to the positive sentiment, Digital asset lawyer Joe Carlasare expressed confidence in the eventual approval of Ethereum spot ETFs this year. However, he adds a cautious note, suggesting that the approval process may take longer than expected. Carlasare believes the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is working to establish a precedent that allows it to exercise discretion in determining which digital asset ETFs can enter the market, discouraging a flood of applications for various tokens.\n\nCarlasare anticipates that spot Ethereum ETFs might not commence trading until the third quarter of 2024, contrasting with the optimism of some applicants like Hashdex, which hints at potential trading as early as the second quarter. Notably, the timing of the launch remains uncertain, even though the approval odds are relatively high.\n\nJames Seyffart, another Bloomberg ETF analyst, supports the case for spot ETH ETF approvals, pointing out that the SEC implicitly accepted Ether as a commodity when approving Ether futures ETFs in September. The analyst believes this prior acceptance could pave the way for spot Ether ETFs to gain regulatory approval.\n\nEthereum ETF Application Deadlines\n\nMultiple asset managers, including BlackRock Inc (NYSE: BLK), VanEck, ARK Invest & 21Shares, Fidelity Investments, and Invesco Galaxy, have filed applications for spot Ether ETFs.\n\nThe SEC faces deadlines ranging from May 23 to August 7 to make decisions on these applications. If the SEC approves one, it may potentially approve all, similar to the approach taken with spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nMeanwhile, the anticipation of Ethereum ETF approval is already influencing the market. Following the recent approval of Bitcoin ETFs, ETH experienced a surge of 7.92% in the past 24 hours, with a notable 17% rally over the past week according to data from CoinMarketCap.\n\nEthereum\u2019s open interest also rose by 11.52% to $7.81 billion, signaling increased trading activity and a bullish sentiment."

        "content": "Share:\n\nMarket picture\n\nThe US Securities Commission (SEC) has announced the approval of the Bitcoin-ETP. The initial fake announcement of this created a spike in volatility. This is a stark reminder of how short-term traders are vulnerable to volatility from the news.\n\nBitcoin soared to $48K before returning below $45K. Technically, these moves fit into a trend formed back in late October last year and gained new momentum after December's sideways consolidation. It's worth preparing for a scenario where altcoins, currently appearing undervalued compared to the leading cryptocurrency, start taking centre stage. But that doesn't negate the potential for BTCUSD to reach $50-51K before a significant correction.\n\nEthereum is obviously attracting the attention of speculators, adding over 13% in less than 36 hours, as it is the next favourite for ETP approval. Potentially, these expectations could drive the price of ETH up in the next couple of months all the way to the $3500 area \u2013 the peak in April 2022.\n\nNews background\n\nAccording to CoinMarketCap, traders lost nearly $1 billion due to a fake tweet about ETF approval. According to Bitfinex, the liquidation of positions in the futures market was the largest since August 2023.\n\nAbout a dozen fund companies in Hong Kong are exploring the possibility of launching spot bitcoin ETFs, HashKey reported. Potential issuers include firms with Chinese capital, as well as from other Asian and European countries.\n\nRobert Kiyosaki, author of the best-selling book \"Rich Dad, Poor Dad\", suggested the price of the first cryptocurrency to rise to the $150K level after the ETF was approved. According to him, he will \"buy more gold, silver and bitcoin with fake dollars\"."

While the latter switched to a Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, miners on the network were expected to flock to ETC to mine cryptocurrency.\n\nHowever, the transition took some time, as the blockchain analysis platform Santiment reported that ETC breached $1.23 billion in trading volume on January 10, 2024, for the first time since September 13, 2022.\n\nProfessional crypto trader Javon Marks describes the latest Ethereum Classic\u2019s price movement as \u201cdisplaying major strength towards $127.65,\u201d basing this target on the fact that ETC\u2019s price is still 81% down from its all-time high set at $167.09 over two years ago.\n\nIf the ongoing bullish trend persists, Marks sees potential for an \u201cadditional 380% upside.\u201d Standing at a $4,511,651,295 market cap, ETC added approximately 1.5 billion in the last 24 hours.\n\n$ETC (#EthereumClassic) TAKES OFF, displaying MAJOR STRENGTH towards the $127.65 and we can still be EARLY in this run!\n\n\n\nAs prices continue to hold broken out, this target remains in play, meaning an additional +380% upside can be on the way to reach it\u2026 https://t.co/W4auGOq4MA pic.twitter.com/qRyiqbOSqu \u2014 JAVON\u26a1\ufe0fMARKS (@JavonTM1) January 10, 2024\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nIn a bearish scenario, the Ethereum Classic (ETC) would be heading to retest the $23 resistance, a barrier that has been historically hard to break.\n\nETC\u2019s Relative Strength Index (RSI) turned to an overbought condition, as the RSI metric is approaching 80 on both daily and weekly charts.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nAs the inaugural Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) gained approval, the cryptosphere got a long-awaited entrance to the traditional financial market.\n\nDelve into DailyCoin\u2019s latest cryptocurrency news:\n\nNASDAQ, NYSE, Cboe Gear Up to Offer Approved Bitcoin ETFs\n\nOnly 6% of Funding Goes to Female-Led Blockchain Startups"

        "content": "Shayan is a digital nomad and a professional journalist. He delivers high-quality engaging articles to Coinpedia through his in-depth research and analysis.\n\nContrary to predictions that Bitcoin\u2019s price would quickly exceed $48,000 and settle around $50,000 following SEC\u2019s approval on spot ETF, the pump is yet to occur. Meanwhile, the altcoin market has seen a notable rise, with leading altcoins showing an average growth of 10%-20%. In addition, Ethereum (ETH) has surpassed its $2,500 resistance mark, reaching close to $2,700, with XRP and SOL prices set to capitalize on the current momentum.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Recent Failure Induced An Altcoin Pump\n\nFollowing the SEC\u2019s decision on the spot ETF application, which did not have the expected impact on BTC\u2019s short-term targets, the altcoin market witnessed a surge in buying interest. ETH investors grew more confident about the possibility of a spot ETH ETF approval.\n\nAdditionally, investors are looking forward to a potential XRP ETF, which may materialize in the coming years, given the ongoing SEC lawsuit against Ripple. Furthermore, the recent approval of a Bitcoin ETF is expected to inject billions of dollars into the market, significantly increasing the DeFi market cap and potentially leading to further gains in Solana\u2019s price.\n\nIn the past few hours, the altcoin season index has seen a remarkable exponential increase, rising from a low of 56 to reach 67. It\u2019s worth highlighting that should this metric exceed 75, it could signal the start of an altcoin season. In such a scenario, many investors may shift their focus to altcoins if Bitcoin fails to show any promising trends.\n\nXRP Price Analysis\n\nXRP is currently facing a decline following Bitcoin\u2019s rejection at $49K. However, the downtrend might not intensify as the market holds bullish momentum. As of writing, XRP price trades at $0.598, surging over 6.7% from yesterday\u2019s rate.\n\nCurrently, the 100-day EMA is holding buying confidence and the RSI is trading below the overbought region, suggesting an advantage for the bulls. In the coming days, we might see a bullish attempt to break the crucial resistance at $0.66, pushing XRP\u2019s price above $0.74.\n\nEthereum Price Analysis\n\nEther experienced a significant surge from its 20-day EMA, reflecting strong buying interest at lower prices. However, this upward momentum faced a rejection soon as the price reversed from $2,700, suggesting bearish dominance near that level. As of writing, ETH price trades at $2,585, surging over 6.1% from yesterday\u2019s rate.\n\nShould the price remain stable above $2,500, it would signal a continuation of the upward trend. In this scenario, the ETH price may retest $2,700, followed by a potential climb to the significant $3,000 mark.\n\nSolana Price Analysis\n\nSolana price is hovering within a descending channel pattern as it continues to struggle near the resistance line at $107. However, bulls are defending the SOL price above moving averages. Currently, Solana is trading at $99.3, surging over 4.9% from yesterday\u2019s rate.\n\nThe EMA lines are showing a leveling trend, and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is trading close to the midpoint. This reflects a state of equilibrium between the supply and demand. If SOL breaks the current momentum above the channel\u2019s resistance line, we might see a surge toward $120."

And BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager and also a bitcoin ETF sponsor, filed an S-1 prospectus for its iShares Ethereum Trust in November.\n\nStory continues\n\nSome traders told CoinDesk that an ether ETF could bolster the growth of Ethereum-based financial applications, whose use cases range from on-chain trading and lending to issuance of real-world assets, or tokenization, on the blockchain.\n\n\u201cA potential approval of an ether ETF could further legitimize Ethereum's standing in the mainstream financial world, leading to increased investment and interest in Ethereum-based projects and layer 2 networks,\u201d said RJ Ke, a researcher at Ethereum rollup service Taiko. \u201cThe anticipation could foster more innovation and growth within the Ethereum ecosystem as well.\u201d\n\nBets on Ethereum-based tokens may spark a reversal of fortunes for ETH investors, which underperformed bitcoin in 2023. Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market cap, climbed more than 150% last year while ether, the No. 2, added about 90%.\n\n\u201cThe approval of the Bitcoin ETFs by the SEC has opened the door for other cryptocurrencies,\u201d said Lucy Hu, a senior analyst at Metalpha, in an email. \u201cThe market is now paying close attention to Ethereum ETF applications ... As the ETH spot ETF deadline is coming close, we believe more institutional investors will allocate more ETH in their portfolios this year to capture more returns.\u201d"

        "content": "Influential whales showed keen interest in Ethereum and accumulated large amounts of ETH.\n\nEthereum experienced a large price surge, coupled with increased network growth.\n\nAmid prevailing uncertainty surrounding the crypto market, Ethereum [ETH] became the focus of significant attention from influential whales.\n\nWhale move in\n\nInsights from Lookonchain shed light on a substantial whale transaction. This whale withdrew a considerable 9,705 ETH ($22.9M) from Binance [BNB], subsequently depositing the funds into Compound.\n\nIn a strategic move, the whale borrowed 12M Tether [USDT] to further accumulate ETH. The trading activity involved three ETH transactions, two of which resulted in profits, accumulating roughly $5M.\n\nThe whale\u2019s decisive actions introduce a spectrum of implications for ETH. On one hand, the substantial investment signals a level of confidence in ETH\u2019s future potential, bolstering positive sentiment within the market.\n\nConversely, the increased incentive for profit-taking introduced an element of risk, potentially impacting short-term price stability.\n\nAnalyzing ETH\u2019s price movement\n\nAs of the latest data, ETH was trading at $2,415.34, reflecting a positive growth of 5.07% in the last 24 hours. Crucially, metrics such as network growth and velocity experienced a surge.\n\nThis indicated heightened interest from new addresses and an increase in token movements, collectively contributing to a positive outlook for ETH\u2019s future.\n\nThe MVRV ratio, a metric gauging the profitability of ETH addresses, expanded in tandem with the recent surge in price.\n\nWhile this points to increased profitability for ETH holders, it also raises the specter of potential sell-offs, which could exert downward pressure on prices.\n\nCounterbalancing this, the rising long/short ratio, indicative of a prevalence of long-term addresses over short-term ones, suggests a greater inclination toward holding rather than selling.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ETHs worth today?\n\nA holistic view of Ethereum\u2019s network revealed consistent gas usage, a critical metric for measuring transaction activity. However, a concerning decline in NFT trades on the network raises questions about overall network vitality.\n\nThe reduced engagement with NFT transactions may signify a shift in user preferences or potential challenges faced by the NFT sector within the Ethereum ecosystem."

        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction as Analyst Says ETH ETFs are Coming in 2024 \u2013 Time to Buy?\n\nThe Ethereum price has surged by 10% in the past 24 hours, rising to $2,656 on the day after the SEC approved its first ever batch of spot-based Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nYet ETH seems to be doing better than most coins today, with its 24-hour gain surpassing the 6% rise the market as a whole has made in the past day.\n\nIt\u2019s now up by 19% in a week and by 98% in a year, with experts now suggesting that the altcoin is the next in line to have spot-based ETFs approved for it in the US.\n\nAnd given ETH\u2019s already-strong fundamentals, 2024 could end up being a very big year for the coin.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction as Analyst Says ETH ETFs are Coming in 2024 \u2013 Time to Buy?\n\n\n\nETH is clearly in the middle of a breakout at the moment, with its price shooting well beyond its 30-day average and likely to break its current resistance level (red).\n\nIt will therefore come as little surprise to see that the coin\u2019s relative strength index (purple) has just topped 70, signalling very strong momentum while also leaving room for further gains before we enter overbought territory.\n\nLikewise, the 30-day is now rising more steeply beyond the 200-day average, providing another clear sign that ETH is seeing lots of buying pressure.\n\nIf this weren\u2019t already clear enough, the coin\u2019s trading volume \u2013 at around $53 billion \u2013 also provides a very strong indicator that ETH has likely begun a bull phase.\n\nIt actually seems that, after buying up Bitcoin (BTC) over the past few weeks, whales have now turned to Ethereum, with data showing some very aggressive accumulating at the moment.\n\nAfter the spot #Bitcoin ETF was approved, this whale continued to borrow $WBTC and exchange it for $ETH. This whale borrowed a total of 621 $WBTC($28.95M) and exchanged it for 11,663 $ETH at a rate of 0.05327. The whale is long the ETH/BTC trading pair!https://t.co/4uE6Lhgjzx pic.twitter.com/4x93OmYRHL \u2014 Lookonchain (@lookonchain) January 11, 2024\n\nIndeed, some analysts now predict that it\u2019s only a matter of months before Ethereum benefits from the approval of its own spot-based ETFs in the US.\n\nFor instance, analyst Will Clemente noted yesterday on X that May 23 is the final deadline for the proposed VanEck Ethereum-based ETF.\n\nAs with the now-approved batch of BTC ETFs, these and other ETH ETFs could do wonders for the Ethereum price in the next few months.\n\nAnd when combined with Ethereum\u2019s strong fundamentals as a layer-one blockchain, the launch of such funds could enable ETH to rise to new heights this year.\n\nAs such, now may be the last time to buy ETH this year before it gets too pricey.\n\nEmerging High Potential Altcoins\n\n\n\nFor those who may worry that ETH is heating up too much, there are other promising alts in the market that also have the potential to rally big in the next few weeks.\n\nThis includes Bitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX), an Ethereum-based stake-to-mine platform that has raised over $8 million in its soon-to-ending presale.\n\nOne of the most interesting new projects in crypto, Bitcoin Minetrix will enable users to mine BTC by staking the platform\u2019s native token, BTCMTX.\n\nUsers who stake BTCMTX will receive tokenized mining credits in return, which they can then spend to pay for Bitcoin mining to take place on their behalf.\n\nOn top of this, staking will also earn them a steady income in the form of BTCMTX, making Bitcoin Minetrix potentially one of the most profitable tokens to hold this year.\n\nThe presale has just entered its nineteenth stage, with investors able to join by going to the official Bitcoin Minetrix website.\n\nAdvantages of #BitcoinMinetrix: Convenient accessibility. Efficient cost structure. \ud83d\udcb5 Abundant space and peaceful environment. No concerns about resale value. \ud83d\udd01 pic.twitter.com/slptHOIHNk \u2014 Bitcoinminetrix (@bitcoinminetrix) January 11, 2024\n\nThey can buy BTCMTX at a price of $0.0128 per token, yet this price is likely to rise much higher once the coin lists on exchanges in the next few weeks.\n\nVisit Bitcoin Minetrix NowDisclaimer: Crypto is a high-risk asset class.
