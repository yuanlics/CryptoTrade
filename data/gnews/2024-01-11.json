The sudden increase is likely due to speculation around the upcoming hard fork, which could improve the network's compatibility with Ethereum. However, the exact reason for the spike is unclear. Grayscale, a leading investment firm, has already launched a trust for ETC, and there is a possibility of other fund issuers seeking approval for ETFs for other cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum Classic.

        "title": "Ethereum: Rising whale interest means this for ETH\u2019s future - AMBCrypto News",
        "summary": "  Influential whales are showing increased interest in Ethereum (ETH), accumulating large amounts of the cryptocurrency and driving up prices. Recent transactions have seen whales borrowing substantial amounts of Tether (USDT) to further accumulate ETH, signaling confidence in the asset's future potential. However, this increased incentive for profit-taking also introduces a risk of short-term price instability. ETH's price movement has been positive, with metrics such as network growth and velocity experiencing a surge. The MVRV ratio has expanded, indicating increased profitability for ETH holders, but also raising the possibility of sell-offs. The long/short ratio suggests a greater inclination toward holding rather than selling. As of today, 1,10,100 ETHs are worth approximately $22.9M."
