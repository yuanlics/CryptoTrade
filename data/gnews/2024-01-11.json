The article attributes the sudden interest in ETC to traders looking to capitalize on the potential approval of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The article suggests that the sudden interest in ETC may be due to a desire to front-run the next big media narrative in the crypto space, with the SEC's approval of spot bitcoin ETFs potentially leading to an eventual greenlight for spot ether funds. However, the article also notes that the odds of fund issuers launching ETFs for Ethereum Classic are slim, although stranger things have happened in the crypto space.

He noted that the gas limit has not been increased for nearly three years, the longest time ever in the protocol's history. The average gas limit has increased over time along with network usage and adoption, starting from around 3 million after Ethereum's genesis in 2015.\n\nIncreasing the gas limit can have both positive and negative impacts on the network.
