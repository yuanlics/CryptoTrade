        "content": "Curve Finance has deployed the smart contract for its stablecoin crvUSD on Ethereum.\n\nThe project designed the stablecoin using the Lending-Liquidating Automated Market Maker Algorithm (LLAMMA), which is a combination of both a traditional AMM and a lending market.\n\nAccording to a white paper from last October, LLAMMA uses an external oracle that ensures that crvUSD pools are made up of two different assets: crvUSD and the asset used to mint the stablecoin (such as ETH or BTC). This differs from other AMM designs, where assets are swapped at the price determined by the AMM curve.\n\nWhen the price of the collateral is higher, all of the user\u2019s deposits will be in the deposited collateral, but as the price of the collateral goes lower, the oracle will convert the deposits to crvUSD.\n\nCurve deployed its initial crvUSD smart contracts yesterday, but a minor issue where fees were not flowing to the project\u2019s DAO was noted by its team, Blockworks Research Senior Analyst Dan Smith said.\n\nThis protocol resolved this minor issue after Curve Finance redeployed an updated smart contract this morning.\n\nEven though information on Etherscan shows that Curve minted an initial 20 million crvUSD, Smith notes that this was part of the deployment process and the tokens themselves did not leave the system.\n\n\u201ccrvUSD only becomes circulating after it has been borrowed by an end user,\u201d he said.\n\nAt the time of writing, Michael Egorov, the founder and CEO of Curve Finance, has the only open loan of $1.05 million.\n\nThe final step, Smith noted, will be to push the user interface onto the Curve website.\n\n\u201cWith two major releases during the depths of the bear market (crvUSD and upgraded tri crypto contracts), Curve is well positioned for success when liquidity and volume returns,\u201d Smith said.\n\n\u201cCurve now controls multiple parts of [the] DeFi stack with a DEX, lending market, and stablecoin.\u201d\n\nTo learn more about Curve Finance and its Q1 performance, check out this detailed report by Blockworks Research.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "The Ethereum network has made the switch from proof-of-work mining to proof-of-stake mining. The transition was completed successfully on September 15, 2022. Additionally, the blockchain went through some major changes as the miners were replaced by validators.\n\nRecently, the much-awaited Shapella upgrade went live, allowing these stakers to withdraw their staked ETH. However, ETH is the second-largest cryptocurrency and was created way back before the emergence of dApps.\n\nAlso read: How To Change Slippage Tolerance on PancakeSwap?\n\nThen the real question emerges as to what it is and why it exists. Wrapped Ether was created to give Ethereum-based decentralized applications (dApps) a more standardized approach to interface with Ether, the network\u2019s native coin.\n\nWhat is Wrapped Ethereum (wETH)?\n\nwETH is just Ether wrapped in a smart contract to provide it with a standardized ERC-20 interface, allowing it to be exchanged and utilized within decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and other Ethereum-based services.\n\nGiven that Ether lacked the most widely used standard for tokens, the ERC-20 interface, it was necessary to create wETH. The process of wrapping ether includes moving the ETH to a smart contract. wETH will then be generated in return for this process. Additionally, this is to ensure that there is a reserve backing every wETH.\n\nAlso read: Is MetaMask Safe (2023)?\n\nBefore we look into how to unwrap Ethereum, let us look at how we can wrap it in just a few simple steps.\n\nHow to wrap Ether?\n\nThere are different ways to wrap Ethereum. One method involves the swapping of ETH for wETH through a cryptocurrency exchange. Another common method is the use of a smart contract. Let us look at the step-by-step guide on how to wrap ETH using OpenSea and MetaMask.\n\nGo to OpenSea and connect your MetaMask wallet.\n\nClick on the \u201cWallet\u201d option. You will see three dots in the top-right corner. Click on the three dots next to Ethereum.\n\nClick on \u201cWrap\u201d from the drop-down menu.\n\nEnter the amount and click on \u201cWrap ETH.\u201d\n\nOnce it is done, confirm the MetaMask pop-up for the transaction to be complete.\n\nThat\u2019s it. You will receive wETH which will shine brightly in pink.\n\nNow that we have covered how to wrap Ether, let us look at how to unwrap Ether using MetaMask and OpenSea.\n\nAlso read: How to Buy Crypto with Western Union\n\nHow to unwrap Ethereum?\n\nUnwrapping Ethereum is also a straightforward process. It works similarly to how you convert ETH to wETH. Let us look at the steps below."

        "title": "Ethereum [ETH]: Decoding the possibility of a price correction as failed transactions surge - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "The total number of failed Ethereum transactions exceeded 500,000.\n\nETH\u2019s price craters as network activity experienced a dip.\n\nAccording to data from CryptoQuant, there was a significant surge in the total number of failed Ethereum[ETH] transactions, reaching over 500,000 as of 2 May.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ETHs worth today?\n\nTaking a cue from ETH\u2019s historical performance, pseudonymous CryptoQuant Analyst MACD, found an interesting fact. Whenever the total count of failed ETH transactions exceeded 200,000, it indicated \u201cmarket overheating\u201d and was often followed by price corrections.\n\n\u201cIn the past, when Ethereum\u2019s transaction failures rise above 200,000, it shows a market overheating and has often seen a price correction.\u201d\n\nTo brace for a price correction or not?\n\nIn the last month, ETH\u2019s price oscillated between $2100 and $1800. At press time, the leading altcoin exchanged hands at $1,869, with a 2% price rally within the past 24 hours, data from CoinMarketCap showed.\n\nOn-chain assessment of ETH\u2019s performance revealed a decline in network activity since 14 April. According to Santiment, the count of daily active addresses that have since traded the alt fell by 41%.\n\nAdditionally, the number of new addresses created daily on the ETH network has plummeted as well. Information from the on-chain data provider revealed the creation of 12,492 new addresses on the ETH network on 1 May. This represented an 86% drop from the 91,560 new addresses created on 14 April.\n\nWith the continued decline in the count of new and active addresses trading ETH, the coin\u2019s value fell from $2100 on 14 April to $1,869 at press time.\n\nIn addition to a fall in its network activity, ETH\u2019s funding rates fell to a one-month low of -0.013 on 3 May. When a crypto asset records negative funding rates, it means that most traders in the market are taking short positions or betting against the asset.\n\nAs a result, it is often taken as an indicator of bearish sentiment and sometimes precipitates a decline in an asset\u2019s value.\n\nFurthermore, as ETH\u2019s price fell since mid-April, holders of 1000 to 100,000 ETH coins gradually distributed their ETH holdings, contributing to the decline in value, per data from Santiment.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check the Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nInterestingly, bigger whales, that hold between 100,000 to 10,000,000 ETH coins, increased their holdings during the same period. However, with bearish sentiments still lingering in the market, this has failed to result in any significant price rally.\n\nAt press time, ETH\u2019s Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Money Flow Index (MFI) were positioned beneath their respective neutral spots, in downtrend positions. This indicated waning buying pressure and highlighted the need for new demand to drive up the alt\u2019s value."

        "title": "Joe Lubin: The truth about ETH founders split and 'Crypto Google' - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "\n\nThere\u2019s a narrative that\u2019s grown up around Ethereum\u2019s two most important co-founders, Joe Lubin and Vitalik Buterin, to explain how they went in different directions almost a decade ago.\n\n\n\nIt suggests the pair fell out over the blockchain\u2019s future direction, with the idealistic 20-year-old Buterin determined to turn Ethereum into a nonprofit foundation, while Lubin and others wanted to commercialize the technology via a for-profit company.\n\n\u201cThat wasn\u2019t really what happened,\u201d the billionaire founder of Ethereum infrastructure and software firm ConsenSys tells Magazine during an in-depth interview in Tel Aviv.\n\n\u201cWhat happened was people were looking for a way to explain why these two people were bumped out of the project. And that was a convenient way to label it. But that wasn\u2019t the reason they were moved.\u201d\n\nLubin\u2019s referring to Ethereum\u2019s infamous \u201cRed Wedding\u201d in 2014 when the eight co-founders and the team gathered to incorporate Ethereum as a company.\n\nFormer Ethereum CEO Charles Hoskinson (right) with creator Vitalik Buterin (left) from back in the day. (Flickr)\n\nThe meeting descended into bickering and infighting over internal politics that saw a devastated CEO Charles Hoskinson pushed out of the team, along with underperforming co-founder Amir Chetrit.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s true that I and several people on the team \u2014 like maybe everybody else \u2014 believed that you need to draw businesses in, you needed economic, commercial validation in order to build better things, even open-source software,\u201d the 58-year-old says in his slow, measured tones.\n\n\n\n\u201cBut that wasn\u2019t the root of why I started ConsenSys or why two people were bumped off the project.\u201d\n\nRed Wedding and Crypto Google\n\nAs documented in Camilla Russo\u2019s history of Ethereum, The Infinite Machine, the co-founders had gathered in Zug, Switzerland on June 7, 2014, to sign a document transforming Ethereum into a for-profit company. But instead of signing the contract, tensions boiled over Hoskinson\u2019s management style and personality, Chetrit\u2019s contribution to the project, Ethereum\u2019s future direction and other internal political issues.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter much back and forth, the decisions were all left to the gangly 20-year-old math genius who\u2019d created the project in the first place. After some time alone on the terrace, he returned to say Hoskinson and Chetrit were out, and Ethereum would become a nonprofit foundation instead of a company.\n\n\n\n\u201cVitalik wrote an amazing white paper \u2014 it was right place, right time, incredible vision \u2014 and it attracted lots of people of disparate backgrounds, and we worked together well for chunks of time,\u201d Lubin says by way of context.\n\nJoe Lubin in conversation with Magazine in Tel Aviv.\n\n\u201cWe had differences of opinion, at times, those differences of opinion boiled over famously\u2026 infamously. And there was a moment where two people were bumped out of leadership, and up to that point, we were having discussions about whether we were going to be purely nonprofit, or whether we were going to pursue a nonprofit track, put it under a foundation, and then the same group of people who worked so nicely together would build Crypto Google together.\n\n\u201cAnd it became apparent to all of us that we probably weren\u2019t going to build Crypto Google. But it was also clear to all of us that nobody was even close to being able to build Crypto Google and that we\u2019re just building the foundation and the platform for a long time.\u201d\n\nLubin was already planning his own for-profit company to build out Ethereum\u2019s application layer when the decision was made, and it spun into life not long afterward.\n\nWhile other co-founders, such as Gavin Wood (Polkadot), contributed more to the early protocol itself, arguably none of them, apart from Buterin, has since contributed as much as Lubin to what Ethereum is today. While ConsenSys didn\u2019t turn into Crypto Google, its infrastructure and apps are as important to Ethereum now as Google is to the web.\n\n\u201cConsenSys wasn\u2019t formed to commercialize it. It was formed to continue the vision and the mission of the Ethereum platform,\u201d Lubin explains.\n\n\n\nRelated: The Vitalik I know \u2014 Dmitry Buterin\n\nWho is Joe Lubin?\n\nBorn in Toronto in 1964, Lubin studied electrical engineering and computer science at Princeton in the mid-1980s, where his roommate was another future crypto billionaire, Mike Novogratz of Galaxy Digital. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos was in the same faculty, though Lubin tells Magazine they never met.\n\nJoe Lubin was almost 50 before he jumped on board the Ethereum train and made his first billion.\n\nLubin has had a surprisingly diverse career, working in AI, robotics and autonomous music creation for a number of different employers. He founded a hedge fund and was the vice president of private wealth management at Goldman Sachs, but nothing world-changing, according to Novogratz, as quoted in the Financial Times in 2021.\n\n\u201cJoe was one of the brightest among us, a forward thinker, but by 45 hadn\u2019t done anything to stand out,\u201d Novogratz recalled. \u201cI don\u2019t think any of our gang would have guessed how things would turn out.\u201d\n\n\n\nRelated: Here\u2019s how Ethereum\u2019s ZK-rollups can become interoperable\n\nThe combination of his near-front-row seat to the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and then the global financial crisis shook him to his core. He said at the ConsenSys Ethereal Summit in May 2017 that the events had made him feel as though \u201cwe were living in a global society and economy that was figuratively, literally and morally bankrupt.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe believed a slow, cascading financial collapse was taking place, which made him receptive to the ideas in the Bitcoin white paper, which he read in 2011. The following year he moved to Jamaica with his girlfriend, who was trying to forge a career in dancehall music, and he became a music producer while investing in Bitcoin and waiting for the collapse.\n\nDuring a trip home to Toronto in late 2013, he attended a Bitcoin meetup alongside another co-founder, Anthony Di Iorio, and encountered a kid named Vitalik Buterin, who was touting his just-written white paper for an improved version of Bitcoin called Ethereum. Lubin was \u201cblown away,\u201d and he became an official co-founder in early 2014.\n\nThe core early Ethereum team at the house rented for Bitcoin Miami 2014, including Joe Lubin in the back row, second from right. (yanislav.medium.com)\n\n\n\nApproaching 50, he was an odd fit with a bunch of anti-establishment 20-something-year-old coders, but his Jamaican music production background gave him just enough cachet with the team to get by. And, of course, Lubin and Di Iorio personally bankrolled around $500,000 to $800,000 of the funding necessary to get Ethereum off the ground.\n\nLubin\u2019s experience also helped the team avoid potential pitfalls and roadblocks, and he insisted on early meetings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission and hiring high-priced lawyers to minimize the extraordinary legal risks.\n\nConsenSys arises!\n\nConsenSys was founded in Switzerland in October 2014 for legal reasons, which subsequently led to a nasty ongoing court battle between employees and shareholders who claim they weren\u2019t properly compensated when the assets were transferred to an American entity.\n\nRelated: \u2018Account abstraction\u2019 supercharges Ethereum wallets: Dummies guide\n\nBut it actually operated from a graffiti-covered warehouse in Bushwick, Brooklyn. The aim was to build out applications and infrastructure for Ethereum by investing in startups, incubating projects and consulting with firms like JPMorgan and BHP Billiton on how to incorporate this new technology. It spawned more than 50 businesses early on, including a poker site, a prediction market and a healthcare records firm. But by all accounts, its early years were pretty slapdash, with no real corporate structure.\n\nMetaMask co-founder Dan Finlay spoke about the early days on the Epicenter podcast.\n\n\n\n\u201cConsenSys was this wonderful, just kind of chaotic incubator at the early stages. I don\u2019t know, there must have been hundreds of different experiments getting validated and tried out there. And there was a really exciting energy,\u201d he says, adding that a lot of projects got built before Ethereum could support them:\n\n\u201cBack then, it was very normal to just kind of build your application as if the blockchain was going to scale or did scale already.\u201d\n\nIn 2018, a Forbes investigation suggested that pretty much all of ConsenSys\u2019 projects were in the red, and the company was burning $100 million a year on non-profitable projects, including an asteroid mining company.\n\nForbes took aim at ConsenSys in a 2018 investigation. (Forbes)\n\nNot long after, Lubin axed a bunch of underperforming projects, culled the 1,200-strong headcount and reset the company into ConsenSys 2.0 with a much more corporate and accountable culture.\n\nDespite being worth $7 billion after its most recent $450-million fundraising round in 2022, ConsenSys let go of another 11% of its staff in January of this year. Lubin tells Magazine it was readying itself to survive bad conditions as \u201cmacroeconomic and geopolitical\u201d storm clouds gathered.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to ensure that we had significant runway so that we can stay strong and build,\u201d he says, revealing it was eyeing a number of acquisitions that \u201cif we\u2019re able to bring some on board that will add really valuable pieces.\u201d\n\nI am excited to share news of our Series D fundraise. https://t.co/SZP36mgBfl \u2014 Joseph Lubin (@ethereumJoseph) March 15, 2022\n\nCentralization vs. decentralization\n\nAnyone who\u2019s listened to Lubin speak will know that he\u2019s genuinely committed to, and a proponent of, the benefits of decentralization.\n\n\n\nSo, is there tension between running a centralized company like ConsenSys that provides the crucial infrastructure to a decentralized blockchain?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a tension,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about progressive decentralization. There\u2019s nothing wrong with having an entity that is organized in one way that is trying to build something that is organized in a different way.\u201d\n\nLubin explains that the products ConsenSys is building need to achieve \u201cproduct-market fit; otherwise, they\u2019re kind of useless, and so bringing something forth, wholly and perfectly decentralized, is very difficult \u2014 it may be impossible.\u201d\n\nConsenSys plays a big role in the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nConsenSys\u2019 most crucial infrastructure is called Infura, which offers Ethereum nodes as a service, making it easier for developers and users to connect to the network. It\u2019s basically an intermediary service between decentralized apps (DApps) and the blockchain that projects rely on to stay up and running.\n\nInfura probably works a little too well, as much of the Ethereum ecosystem is dependent on it. That means if Infura goes down, so too do half the network\u2019s projects, including Uniswap, Compound, MetaMask and Aave.\n\nIt\u2019s also a weak point for censorship and was criticized by some for complying with the Tornado Cash sanctions.\n\nDecentralizing Infura\n\nConsenSys has been working on a plan for some time now to \u201cdecentralize Infura.\u201d This will take the form of a marketplace of competing infrastructure providers that offer similar services, of which Infura itself would be one.\n\nLubin believes it\u2019s \u201cextremely important\u201d to make this happen.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been a proponent of decentralizing Infura since the start but more actively since five years ago,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve run into is that our ecosystem keeps having these wicked growth spurts,\u201d he continues, adding, \u201cIt was a sub-priority to keep things going rather than to start a parallel project to parallelize and decentralize \u2014 and that\u2019s going pretty well right now.\u201d\n\nThe protocol will either be called XFura or the Decentralized Infura Network Protocol.\n\n\u201cThe idea is that we believe now that we can take a high-performance product and federate the protocol, initially do a lot of hand-holding with other providers and then we situate Infura on the protocol,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty close. There are a bunch of very sophisticated partners that are working closely with EG [Galano], the lead of the project. I can\u2019t give you a date.\u201d\n\nAlthough Infura researcher Patrick McCorry went out of his way in an interview with Cointelegraph to say censorship resistance was not the point of decentralizing Infura, that\u2019s certainly one of the benefits.\n\n\n\nA decentralized network would enable DApps to pick and choose providers, allowing them potentially to get around censored protocols or addresses like Tornado Cash.\n\n\u201cI like the idea that there\u2019s optionality,\u201d says Lubin, carefully noting that different providers would operate in different nation-states and jurisdictions.\n\n\u201cI think that works well if there\u2019s a lot of them and if there\u2019s real choice, so you can always go to an uncensored service and be sure that they\u2019ve got enough validating power so that you\u2019re gonna get your transaction processed fairly rapidly.\u201d\n\nHowever, he adds it\u2019s equally possible that future aspects of the protocol are obfuscated so that no one actually knows what\u2019s in a packet or a transaction. He says he knows of people already \u201cworking on protocol enhancements\u201d who will make this happen, and the explosion of layer 2s and layer 3s makes it even more likely.\n\n\u201cIf they\u2019re already glommed in and impossible to read, then it\u2019s hard to imagine that regulators will either care that much or have the ability to do anything,\u201d he says.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure [there is] lots of criminal activity that flows through AWS and Azure and every mail server everywhere. So, there\u2019s a level of infrastructure that you just can\u2019t halt because it\u2019s doing mostly useful activity.\u201d\n\nDecentralizing MetaMask\n\nThe other core bit of infrastructure provided by ConsenSys that underpins the entire Ethereum ecosystem is its ubiquitous browser wallet MetaMask. It\u2019s also being sort of decentralized by crowdsourcing the development of new features and the addition of new blockchains.\n\n\n\nCalled MetaMask Snaps, it\u2019ll turn the browser wallet into a permissionless platform for others to build on \u2014 one proof-of-concept Snap enables MetaMask to act as a Bitcoin wallet.\n\nJoe Lubin has arguably made a bigger contribution to Ethereum than any other co-founder apart from Vitalik Buterin.\n\n\u201cThe MetaMask Grants DAO [decentralized autonomous organization] will get increasingly decentralized and will incentivize people to build cool things, to start companies that permissionlessly innovate that we have nothing to do with,\u201d says Lubin.\n\nHe explains that over the years, MetaMask was approached by numerous blockchains looking for support, but after they\u2019d crunched the numbers, there wasn\u2019t enough activity to justify splitting its focus from Ethereum. Snaps, though, will open the doors to everyone.\n\nCrypto regulations\n\nLubin is unconcerned about the possibility of Ethereum being declared a security, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s as likely and would have the same impact as if Uber was made illegal.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThere would be tremendous outcry from not just the crypto community but different politicians, certain regulators.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a sense of frustration from Lubin that this ground even needs to be covered again, saying that ConsenSys has been through all of this in discussions with the SEC and Commodity Futures Trading Commission over many years.\n\n\u201cWe went in there on a voluntary basis five years ago or something like that, when they\u2019re just trying to wrap their heads around what tokens were,\u201d he says.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey thought back then that everything was a security; we think [we] helped them significantly understand that lots of tokens are not securities and then they went away, and Gary and his team now think almost everything\u2019s a security.\u201d\n\nBut he believes that the renewed focus on regulations in the wake of the FTX and stablecoin collapses will ultimately be a good thing.\n\n\u201cWe now have the world\u2019s attention, and smart people who care will prevail because it just makes sense,\u201d he says.\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd sure, there will be people with agendas who don\u2019t want to see it that way. Maybe the banking lobby will help them not see it that way. But in terms of finally paying a lot of attention to trying to regulate an important space, I do believe that clear heads will think through this and that people will start to understand the benefits of decentralization and make good regulation for CeFi [centralized finance] and no regulation for tech, crypto.\u201d\n\nCrisis equals opportunity\n\nIn fact, Lubin is remarkably philosophical and sanguine about all the regulatory, game theory and technological challenges facing Ethereum. For example, he concedes centralization of staking on platforms like Lido could become a concern, but because progressive decentralization is baked into the nature of the ecosystem, it won\u2019t be a problem for long.\n\n\u201cThings don\u2019t start very decentralized,\u201d he says. \u201cThese are still pretty new innovations, and our ecosystem is pretty exacting. If you want to be in the Ethereum ecosystem proper, then you\u2019re not going to want to try to dominate something, you\u2019re not going to want to operate centralized for very long. The ecosystem will identify that as problematic and come up with solutions for it, which is great.\u201d\n\nIn Lubin\u2019s world view, problems are just short-term issues you deal with as part of the process of making the project better.\n\n\u201cI see things as processes. I hope we run into lots of complications in the near term, and all the way through, because every complication just points out how we can build a more robust platform and a more decentralized platform. Yes, hopefully, we\u2019ll run into lots of difficult problems.\u201d\n\n\u201cLots of smart people have good solutions that are being built.\u201d\n\n\n\nAlso read: Ethereum is eating the world \u2014 \u2018You only need one internet\u2019\n\nThe future of Ethereum\n\nThe big question is, where does he see Ethereum heading? Does he believe the world\u2019s entire financial system could end up running on Ethereum using ZK-Rollups?\n\nLubin says the founding conception of Ethereum was that it would become a \u201cworld computer,\u201d and he suggests that was still in the cards.\n\n\u201cI think several of us thought early on that we were building the Star Trek computer essentially,\u201d he says, explaining it handled pretty much anything and everything.\n\n\u201cAnd so, I think that decentralized protocols will be the underlying trust foundation for lots of heterogeneous architectures. So, it\u2019s possible that Ethereum will scale sufficiently so that we can have one trust foundation and then build lots of layer 2s and layer 3s and up.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere have been many computer revolutions for the last 200 and something years and this is another one.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, the answer\u2019s yes. And the answer will take time to unfold. It would be impossible to rearchitect the global economy or global financial system in a short period of time.\u201d"
