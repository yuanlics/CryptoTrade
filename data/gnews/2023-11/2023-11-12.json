        "title": "Is Ethereum once again the victim of its own success? - Forkast News",
        "content": "Ever since Ethereum\u2019s shift to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, an increasing number of users are getting in on the staking action to reap the rewards that come with it. Institutions are also paying attention, given the decrease in network risk and volatility following \u201cThe Merge.\u201d This has led to concerns about how much ETH is getting locked into staking contracts, potentially interfering with liquidity on the network.\n\nDevelopers are already proposing possible solutions to limit the rate of staking, which benefits overall network health but has now limited the opportunities for users to earn a yield from the network. Coupled with an ongoing DeFi winter, there just aren\u2019t as many lucrative returns opportunities in this space as there once were. Truth is, without profitable and reliable alternatives, ETH holders are going to continue to be drawn to staking as the best means of generating return on their assets.\n\nThe rise of Ethereum staking\n\nIt\u2019s been about a year since Ethereum successfully completed the Merge, in which the blockchain switched from a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism, like Bitcoin, to a PoS one. This was done to significantly improve the efficiency of the Ethereum network and allowed users to earn a passive income by staking their ETH to secure the network. Ethereum 2.0 was born.\n\nOverall, this has been seen as a positive move for the Ethereum network. A significant number of users have staked their assets already, to the tune of 20% of all circulating Ether. In theory, this sounds great, as the idea is that a diverse array of users are both helping to ensure the security of the blockchain and are being rightly rewarded for doing so. The reality, however, is a bit different.\n\nThe rise of large staking providers have made it easier for virtually anyone to get involved, but this is causing the amount of ETH that is staked to continue to quickly rise. At the current trajectory, the amount of ETH locked up could balloon up to as much as 50% by May 2024 and even approach 100% by December next year, according to projections in an Ethereum Improvement Proposal co-authored by Ethereum co-founder Tim Beiko. While actually seeing the entire supply of Ethereum get locked up won\u2019t happen, this situation could still cause a significant liquidity crunch that limits the functionality of the blockchain ecosystem, decentralized apps, and services built on top of it.\n\nThis fiasco has led to Ethereum developers approving a new proposal that would control the rate at which new validators could stake ETH. Known as EIP-7514, this change will modify the \u201cchurn limit\u201d function to give it a maximum value that will regulate how many validators are able to join or exit the network within a given timeframe. The proposal is already being included in the Cancun-Deneb upgrade that was slated for this October but will likely now be delayed until early next year.\n\nWhile EIP-7514 will help to buy some time, it doesn\u2019t actually address the underlying problem. Namely, the fact that Ethereum staking, as is, incentivizes locking up funds over keeping them liquid. It\u2019s true that users don\u2019t have to stake Ethereum directly but can turn to other yield-bearing services. However, in the wake of FTX and other recent disasters, the entire DeFi market has seen an almost 80% contraction over the last year. This means there are fewer and less useful places for asset holders to earn yield.\n\nWhat alternatives need to offer\n\nUsers need a safe and lucrative alternative that has advantages to staking, even if the returns aren\u2019t quite at the level provided by staking. These could come in the form of yield-generating accounts that allow for returns on the Ethereum stored inside them, but don\u2019t have days or weeks-long limits on when funds are accessible. Because no staking is actually done, users stay in full control of their own assets.\n\nBetter still, accounts such as these could be significantly more user-friendly than the confusing, alienating process of Ethereum staking, holders would simply need to deposit their funds and sit on them. They could remove them at any time, and overall liquidity on the network is not affected. Users also wouldn\u2019t rely on the health of DeFi as a whole, and will generate returns regardless of what the market is doing.\n\nAnother essential aspect of these offerings is that they can also be \u201cring-fenced,\u201d meaning the assets are never intermingled with other user\u2019s funds or company activities and aren\u2019t exposed to broader systemic risk. Assets that are used for growth opportunities are separate from those that are just being held as savings. This is important for keeping users safe, as even if the service itself should collapse, all held funds will be completely intact.\n\nImplementing a service where anyone can grow savings without the need to lock up ETH is the ultimate key to solving the ongoing staking issue that is plaguing Ethereum. Protocol changes are helpful, but what is essential is changing the incentive that users have for earning yield on their assets. By providing growth opportunities that don\u2019t involve actual staking, these accounts can be simpler, safer and healthier for the whole ecosystem than centralized alternatives. The solution is obvious; now it\u2019s time to bring something like this to Ethereum holders worldwide."

        "content": "The number of daily active users on Solana overtook the Ethereum mainnet on Nov. 11 following a sharp uptick in activity.\n\nAccording to data to Artemix, Solana hosted 356,300 unique users on Saturday, surpassing Ethereum\u2019s nearly 330,000 by 10%. The milestone was driven by a sharp uptick in activity on Solana, with the network hosting only 208,000 active addresses on Nov. 7.\n\nFor comparison, Ethereum consistently hosted between 290,000 and 350,000 users daily over the majority of the past three months, with two brief spikes above 400,000 and a surge to more than 1M wallets.\n\nSolana Overtakes Ethereum By Active Users After 70% Spike\n\nThe milestone is the latest sign of Solana\u2019s recovery following last year\u2019s brutal bear and the fallout from the collapse of its major investor, FTX.\n\nThe price of SOL plummeted more than 96% from its November 2021 all-time high of $250 to less than $10 in January, according to CoinGecko. Active addresses on the network shrank 85% from 1.28M in May 2022 to around 200,000 this September, according to The Block.\n\nBut Solana refused to stay down, with the network outperforming the broader markets amid the recent cryptocurrency rally as evidenced by the recent surge in active addresses.\n\nThe price of SOL is up 145% in four weeks, beating out many rival digital assets by at least double. The total value locked in Solana-based DeFi protocols is up 62% over the same period, according to DeFi Llama, while NFT sales volume grew 35% in the past 30 days, according to Crypto Slam.\n\nThe move followed progress towards Solana's firedancer upgrade in the form of a testnet, and dissipating expectations that the FTX bankruptcy estate would soon offload large sums of SOL on the markets.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Layer 2s\n\nWhile some analysts have been quick to pronounce that Solana has flipped Ethereum by active users in response to the recent uptick in activity. However, the Ethereum ecosystem has expanded beyond its base-layer, with the majority of activity now taking place on Layer 2.\n\nAccording to data from Token Terminal, more than 800,000 users were active on the top seven Layer 2 networks over the past day combined. Coupled with the Ethereum mainnet, the data suggests more than 1M wallets were active across the Ethereum ecosystem. However, said data does not account for users operating the same wallet across multiple networks.\n\nAccording to L2beat, Layer 2 networks are driving 80% of activity in Ethereum\u2019s broader ecosystem, which is driving roughly 60 transactions per second.\n\nTo continue reading this as well as other DeFi and Web3 news, visit us at thedefiant.io"

        "content": "New research into the Ethereum blockchain looks at ways to use zk-SKNARKs (zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive argument of knowledge) to enable private transactions using Solidity, the primary programming language on Ethereum.\n\nThis research is primarily focused on being able to enable privacy-enhancing functionality that is traditionally reserved for layer-2 networks built on top of the Ethereum application layer.\n\nAccording to Mirror Tang, co-founder of Salus Security and author of the research paper, enabling ZK functionality within Solidity may remove the need for layer-2 blockchains, such as zero-knowledge rollups.\n\n\u201cA lot of DeFi activity remains on Ethereum L-1, and less so on L-2s,\u201d Tang told Blockworks. \u201cIf we can use computational optimization to enable ZK technology on Solidity, we would be able to reduce gas fees on Ethereum itself significantly.\u201d\n\nThis may allow transaction activity to be concentrated on Ethereum rather than its disparate L-2 ecosystems, Tang explained.\n\nThere are existing technical barriers to introducing zk-SNARKs to Ethereum, however.\n\nFor example, Solidity is currently single-threaded in nature, meaning that it executes one transaction at a time. It will be important, therefore, to find ways to introduce multithreading to Ethereum.\n\nFurther, to enable zk-SNARKs to operate effectively and securely on the network, it will be necessary to ensure it is auditable.\n\nBy nature, ZK technology relies on provers to send accurate proofs to third-party verifiers without revealing the information of the statement, meaning there would be additional storage requirements at the verification stage.\n\nAbsent these barriers, Tang\u2019s research indicates Zk-SNARKs on Solidity could enhance privacy and improve MEV resistance by enabling private transactions and voting on existing Ethereum projects. Fast-tracking the verification process would enhance the performance of the blockchain as a whole.\n\nThis research, if pursued, would be entirely open-source, enabling further development and contribution by the Solidity community, Tang said.\n\nHe hopes that his research will be noticed by venture capitalists in the crypto community so that his team can continue working towards making its findings a reality.\n\nInterview with Tang was conducted in Mandarin.

        "content": "The price of ether (ETH) isn\u2019t expected to move much for the remainder of 2023, according to Finder\u2019s latest Ethereum Price Predictions Report.\n\nFinder\u2019s panel of 31 cryptocurrency and fintech specialists predict ETH on average will be worth US$1.8k at the end of the year, on par with its current price at the time of writing. By the end of 2025 this is expected to jump to $5.8k.\n\nYouHodler chief of markets Ruslan Lienkha gave an end-of-year prediction slightly higher than the panel average at $2k. According to Lienkha, ETH \u201chas a huge growth potential as it is not just cryptocurrency but an entire ecosystem with plenty of different projects.\u201d\n\nMarket Research Future senior research analyst Shubham Munde gave a similar 2023 price prediction and attributes this to the rising popularity of DeFi. By the end of 2025, he thinks ETH will be priced at $4.5k.\n\n\u201cThe market is also recovering well and [is] expected to see major highs in [the] next year,\u201d said Munde.\n\nOmnia Markets founder and CEO Mitesh Shah is more bullish about ETH\u2019s 2025 outlook, giving a prediction higher than the panel average at $7.5k.\n\n\u201cThe rapid growth of cryptocurrency ETFs, with a wave of ether futures funds launching this Monday, is poised to make it easier for institutional investors to gain exposure to the crypto market.\u201d\n\nOrigin Protocol founder Josh Fraser is of the belief that ETH\u2019s price won\u2019t move significantly before year-end. However, Fraser is also part of the 37% who believe that the market cap of ETH will flip that of BTC\u2019s. Meanwhile 43% don\u2019t think this will ever happen, while the remaining 20% are unsure.\n\n\u201cIn my opinion, it\u2019s likely ETH will eventually flip Bitcoin in terms of market capitalization,\u201d said Fraser.\n\n\u201cBy 2030, NFTs will have tokenized trillions of dollars worth of value on Ethereum. It\u2019s not unlikely that total value locked in NFTs will surpass that of DeFi, as NFT value will include real estate, IP, luxury goods, and beyond.\u201d\n\nRealFevr VP of Web 3 Pedro Febrero thinks that the flippening will happen as soon as 2024:\n\n\u201cEthereum is the number 1 network in terms of fee revenue: compared to BTC, ETH validators make over 50% of their income from fees, whereas in bitcoin miners\u2019 revenue fee weight represents around 1%.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, Boston Trading.co CFO Jeremy Britton is part of the 43% who think ETH will never flip BTC.\n\n\u201cETH is still the original network, but changing from POW to POS has made ETH less decentralised and less \u201ccrypto\u201d. Some of ETH\u2019s competitors, such as SOL, MATIC and others, may cut ETH\u2019s market share as people want lower fees and more decentralisation.\u201d\n\nOverall 48% of Finder\u2019s panel say now is the time to hold ETH, 41% to buy, and 10% to sell."

Canfield suggests that Solana could potentially increase its market dominance to the range of 12-15%.\n\nCanfield\u2019s analysis is based on several indicators. He highlights the Solana Dominance (SOL.D) chart, noting that even at its peak market cap, it didn\u2019t surpass 3%. With the current trends and the breakout of SOLBTC from its weekly resistance, Canfield envisions a scenario where Solana could enter a parabolic rally phase.\n\nIn my opinion, I think that @Solana is going to continue to be one of the biggest movers during this current bull market cycle and I'm going to lay out some ideas for you.It's possible that with the Ethereum ETF news that some of these ideas don't play out, but it's worth\u2026 pic.twitter.com/oii8vWs0W9\n\n\u2014 Jacob Canfield (@JacobCanfield) November 9, 2023\n\nCanfield suggests that if Solana continues to trend against Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC), it could easily reach a price of $1,000 per coin and claim the second spot behind Bitcoin. \"Solana could triple or quadruple it's all time high market dominance around 12-15% and if it continues to trend against Bitcoin, could easily see a $1,000 per coin and take the #2 spot behind Bitcoin,\" the analyst said.\n\nWill The SEC Finally Approve Long-Awaited Bitcoin Spot ETF?

        "content": "Fidelity follows BlackRock \u2013 files for Ethereum ETF\n\nFinancial management giant Fidelity had filed to create a spot Ethereum ETF that would be listed on an exchange owned by CBOE Global. The news follows a similar filing from BlackRock a week ago.\n\nIt was revealed late last week that financial management giant Fidelity had filed to create a spot Ethereum ETF that would be listed on an exchange owned by CBOE Global. They join fellow institutions, BlackRock, and six others as applicants for a spot Ethereum ETF.\n\nFor the new \u2018Fidelity Ethereum Fund\u2019, according to the filing, \u201ceach Share will represent a fractional undivided beneficial interest in the Trust\u2019s net assets. The Trust\u2019s assets will consist of ETH held by the Custodian on behalf of the Trust.\u201d\n\nThe fund is pitched as a low-risk way for investors to gain exposure to ETH. Investors will have regulated avenues to gain exposure to Ethereum price action, without needing to worry about custody. This has the potential to drive a broader adoption of cryptocurrency and introduce a new investor base to the asset class.\n\nRetail investors in the United States have not had a regulated, easily accessible spot ETF version of Bitcoin or Ethereum like their counterparts in Europe and other countries. In mid-August 2023, Europe welcomed its first-ever spot Bitcoin ETF after the launch of Jacobi Asset Management\u2019s Jacobi FT Wilshire Bitcoin ETF. \u201cU.S. retail investors have lacked a U.S. regulated, U.S. exchange-traded vehicle to gain exposure to ETH,\u201d the filing explained, noting that current channels for retail investors to access Ethereum involve dealing with counterparty risk, legal uncertainty, and technical risk.\n\nFidelity Follows BlackRock\n\nThe Fidelity news comes soon after BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, filed for an Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) last week. Depending on whose is approved first, the ETH ETF would be the first of its kind in the United States, and would allow investors to gain exposure to Ethereum without having to purchase the cryptocurrency directly.\n\nThe ETF would track the spot price of Ethereum, which means that investors would be investing in the price of Ethereum itself, rather than in a company that is involved in the Ethereum ecosystem. The ETF would be listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and would be available to both retail and institutional investors.\n\nFollowing the news, the price of ETH surged to its highest level this year near $2,132, before pulling back afterwards.\n\nThe price of ETH jumped on the ETH news\n\nThe immediate jump in price is similar to the Bitcoin rally in June when BlackRock filed an application to list a spot Bitcoin ETF. ETFs stand for exchange-traded products, and they offer a convenient way for investors to buy exposure to an asset without having to own it themselves.\n\nThe news follows BlackRock\u2019s existing application for a spot-based Bitcoin ETF, which is expected to be approved by the US Securities and Exchange Commission by Q1 2024.\n\nThe company\u2019s Ethereum ETF plan was revealed in a filing by Nasdaq, the U.S. exchange where BlackRock will seek to list the ETF. On Thursday, we learned that the corporate entity \u201ciShares Ethereum Trust\u201d was registered in the state of Delaware; iShares is the name of BlackRock\u2019s ETF division.\n\nThe filing states that U.S.-based crypto exchange Coinbase will be the custodian for the ETH held by the ETF, while an unnamed third party will hold its cash. BlackRock has a market-surveillance agreement with Coinbase; these surveillance-sharing agreements are seen as necessary for crypto ETFs to win approval by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\n\u201cEither CME surveillance can detect spot-market fraud that affects both futures ETFs and spot exchange-traded products, or that surveillance cannot do so for either type of product,\u201d said the filing. \u201cHaving approved ETH futures ETFs in part on the basis of such surveillance, the Commission has clearly determined that CME surveillance can detect spot-market fraud that would affect spot ETPs, and the Sponsor thus believes that it must also approve spot ETH ETPs on that basis.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Galaxy Digital founder Mike Novogratz spoke to investors and said that 2024 will see the long awaited institutional adoption of crypto assets, following the approval of a slew of ETF applications. During Galaxy Digital\u2019s third-quarter earnings call Novogratz said that the SEC\u2019s approval of multiple ETFs \u201cis now not a matter of if but when.\u201d Galaxy Digital has filed for spot Bitcoin and ETH ETF applications.\n\nNot a Sure Thing\n\nWhether or not the spot-based Ethereum ETFs will be approved, however, remains uncertain. At present, the market\u2019s view is that the long-awaited Bitcoin spot ETFs are almost certainly going to be approved by Q1 2024.\n\nThis is reflected by the analysis of Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seffart, who puts the odds of a spot Bitcoin ETF approval at 90% by January 10 as the tweet below shows.\n\nA spot ether ETF approval is less certain. The SEC has up to 240 days to decide whether or not to approve a product, which puts any potential release date deep into late 2024 at the earliest.\n\nAnother potential complication is the murky status of ETH itself, in the eyes of regulators. While the SEC views Bitcoin as a commodity, and not a security, SEC Head Gary Gensler has consistently declined to offer a definitive statement of ETH, instead hinting that outside of Bitcoin, all crypto assets are potentially securities.\n\nAs the crypto industry continues to push for clearer guidelines, the status of ETH in the eyes of the SEC will be one of the first and most important dominoes to fall.\n\n\u2014"

        "title": "Has The Ethereum Price Bull Market Train Left The Station? - CoinGape",
        "content": "In the rapidly changing landscape of blockchain technology, the second-largest cryptocurrency Ethereum remains a leader in innovation. The platform\u2019s support for decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts continues to fuel a wide range of developments in sectors like decentralized finance (DeFi), gaming, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). with its upcoming Cancun upgrade and optimism around the spot ETH, its future projection seems promising for this altcoin.\n\nIs Ethereum Ready for Uptrend?\n\nSource-Tradingview\n\nA look at the higher time frame is crucial to understanding the major trend in the asset and where it is currently positioned. Analyzing the data since 2013, the Ethereum coin has undergone three to four significant corrections, each obliterating about 70-80% of its market value, only to rebound with a substantial surge thereafter. This recurring pattern can offer significant insight into whether ETH price is ready for a major uptrend.\n\nJune-Dec 2016 Peak to Trough: The Ethereum price soared to a high of $21.5 and plunged to $6.2, registering 71.4%\n\n2018 High to Low: From the January high of $1529, the correction phase evaporated 94.8% to reach a December low of $79.06\n\nNovember 2021 to November 2022: from a peak of $4951 to a downfall of $883.6, the coin price witnessed an 82.16% loss.\n\nIf this repetitive pattern stands firm, the Ethereum price has witnessed a suitable downtrend of 82% which would likely trigger a bullish trend ahead.\n\nDaily transactions on the ETH network\n\nThe Ethereum price recovery from mid-October has been paralleled by a notable surge in daily transactions on its network. This uptick in transaction volume is a critical indicator of the network\u2019s health, revealing insights into its active usage and the level of user interaction.\n\nThe data is telling: from a low of 921,231 daily transactions on October 15th, the Ethereum network activity escalated to an impressive 1.108 million transactions by November 11th. This significant jump highlights an increasing level of user engagement and growing adoption of Ethereum.\n\nEthereum- Global In/Out of the Money (GIOM)\n\nThe Global In/Out of the Money (GIOM) metric for Ethereum presents an optimistic picture: As of now, 62.13% of ETH addresses are \u2018in the money,\u2019 meaning they are currently profiting, while 34.19% are \u2018out of the money,\u2019 indicating they are at a loss. This suggests a stable investor base, less prone to panic selling, which could foster a sustained bullish trend.\n\nThe distribution of profitable versus non-profitable addresses is a key indicator of market sentiment and investor behavior.\n\nNew Address Created\n\nThis metric monitors the daily creation of new Ethereum addresses as a significant indicator of network activity and potential growth. The increase in new addresses, from 247.47M on October 15 to 249.66M on November 11, points to a rising level of participation in the ETH network. This surge in new addresses often precedes an uptick in demand for Ether, which can positively influence its price\n\nEthereum Cancun Upgrade\n\nThe Ethereum Cancun upgrade encompasses major enhancements for both layers of Ethereum: the Cancun upgrade for the execution layer (Layer 1, L1) and the Deneb upgrade for the consensus layer (Layer 2, L2). Scheduled for Q1 of 2024, this dual-layer upgrade aims to substantially improve the Ethereum network in several key areas.\n\nThe Cancun-Deneb upgrade is expected to elevate the scalability, security, and overall efficiency of the Ethereum network. One of the central features of this upgrade is the introduction of proto-danksharding, a process designed to optimize operations and reduce the high gas fees associated with Ethereum transactions. This enhancement is expected to address some of the long-standing challenges faced by the Ethereum network, potentially making it more accessible and user-friendly, and laying the groundwork for broader adoption and more diverse applications of Ethereum in the blockchain ecosystem\n\nBuzz for Ethereum Spot ETF\n\nThe largest asset management company, BlackRock filing for a spot Ethereum ETF, named the \u201ciShares Ethereum Trust,\u201d has created a significant stir in the crypto sphere. This move, confirmed on November 9, propelled the ETH value beyond the $2,000 psychological mark, marking a substantial 12.3% increase. This development caused a ripple effect in the altcoin market as it bolstered the continuation of the November rally.\n\nAdditionally, the crypto community is already buzzing with expectations for a regulatory green light on a spot Bitcoin ETF, a development that further solidifies the cryptocurrency industry\u2019s standing in the financial world.\n\nETH/USD Daily Chart: Can Recovery Surpass $3000?\n\nSource-Tradingview\n\nThe daily time frame chart shows that the Ethereum price has been riding a slow yet steady recovery under the influence of a rising wedge pattern. The two rising trendlines of this pattern offer dynamic resistance and support and the prices rebounded twice from the upper boundary and thrice from the lower indicating its strong influence.\n\nThe ETH price has been under strong recovery since mid-October when the prices jumped from $1527 to the current trading price of $2055, accounting for a bullish recovery of 34.8%. With sustained buying, the coin price could surge another 8-10% to hit the upper trendline around $2240.\n\nConsider a bullish scenario, an upside breakout from the aforementioned resistance would intensify the buying momentum and may push the prices 40% higher to reach the $3175 target.\n\nETH/USD Weekly Chart: Pullback or Recovery?\n\nSource- Tradingview\n\nFrom June 22\u2019 low of $883.6, the Ethereum price recovery has gained 133% to reach the $2055 mark. The bullish rally, which has crossed the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level, marked a notable shift in its trajectory.\n\nThis move draws attention to key resistance levels: the 38.2% FIB at $2440 and the $2,900 mark at the 50% FIB level. Until the ETH price overcomes the 50% FIB threshold, the risk of a continuing downtrend persists.\n\nYet, a breakthrough above this level could signal a waning of bearish forces, pointing to an emerging bullish grip on the market."

        "content": "Malicious actors have been abusing Ethereum's 'Create2' function to bypass wallet security alerts and poison cryptocurrency addresses, which led to stealing $60,000,000 worth of cryptocurrency from 99,000 people in six months.\n\nThis is reported by Web3 anti-scam specialists at 'Scam Sniffer,' who observed several cases of in-the-wild exploitation of the function, in some cases losses incurred by one individual reaching up to $1.6 million.\n\nLegitimate function\n\nCreate2 is an opcode in Ethereum, introduced in the 'Constantinople' upgrade, that allows creating smart contracts on the blockchain.\n\nUnlike the original Create opcode, which generated new addresses based on the creator's address and nonce, Create2 allows calculating addresses before the deployment of the contract.\n\nIt's a powerful tool for Ethereum developers, enabling advanced and flexible contract interactions, parameter-based contract address pre-calculation, deployment flexibility, suitability for off-chain transactions and certain dApps.\n\nCreate2 introduced significant benefits, but several security implications and new attack vectors also came along with them.\n\nCreate2 opcode abuse\n\nScam Sniffer's report explains that Create2 can be abused to generate fresh contract addresses with no history of malicious/reported transactions, hence bypassing wallet security alerts.\n\nWhen a victim signs a malicious transaction, the attacker deploys a contract at the pre-calculated address and transfers the victim's assets to it, a non-reversible process.\n\nIn a recent case analysts observed, a victim lost $927,000 worth of GMX after they were tricked into signing a transfer contract that sent the assets to a pre-computed address.\n\nThe smart contract used in the attack (Scam Sniffer)\n\nThe second type of Create2 abuse is generating addresses similar to legitimate ones owned by the recipient, thus tricking users into sending assets to the threat actors, thinking they're sending it to a known address.\n\nThe scheme, which is named 'address poisoning,' involves generating a large number of addresses and then picking those that match their specific phishing needs each time to trick their targets.\n\nSince August 2023, Scam Sniffer has recorded 11 victims losing nearly $3 million, with one of them transferring $1.6 million to an address resembling one they had sent money to recently.\n\nMost of these attacks went under the radar, silently siphoning millions, but some have caught the attention of the community.\n\nAt the beginning of the year, MetaMask warned about scammers using freshly-generated addresses that match those used by the victim in recent transactions.\n\nIn the scam, the threat actor may also send the victim a small amount in crypto to register the address in the wallet's history, thus increasing the chances of the victim making the payment.\n\nIn early August 2023, a Binance operator mistakenly sent $20 million to scammers who employed the 'address poisoning' trick but noticed the error quickly and froze the recipient's address.\n\nNotably, using lookalike cryptocurrency addresses is a trick seen in clipboard-hijacking malware tools, like the Laplas Clipper, highlighting the method's effectiveness.\n\nWhen performing cryptocurrency transactions, it is always recommended to check the recipient's address thoroughly, and not just the first and last three-four characters, before approving it."

        "content": "Tokenum\n\nTOKYO, JAPAN, Nov. 13, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --\n\nTokenum, a pioneering cryptocurrency platform, is proud to introduce its groundbreaking \"gasless technology.\" This revolutionary innovation simplifies cryptocurrency transactions and token offerings on the Ethereum blockchain, ushering in a new era of user-friendly accessibility.\n\nThe platform has already embarked on alpha testing, with an accelerated beta version scheduled for release within a week.\n\nRevolutionary Technology\n\nTokenum's gasless technology marks a significant advancement in the cryptocurrency landscape for several compelling reasons.\n\n1) Innovative Gas-free Transactions\n\nIn traditional banking, transaction fees are paid using the same currency that is being transacted. However, in the world of cryptocurrency, fees are often paid in another, blockchain-specific digital currencies. Such fees are referred to as \"gas.\" Tokenum's gasless technology eliminates the need for users to grapple with this complex concept, making cryptocurrency more accessible to a broader audience.\n\n2) Supercharged Token Sales\n\nNew cryptocurrency projects face various challenges, including scheduling, legal compliance, compatible wallets, and sale regulations. Additionally, for users to participate in project sales, users must first acquire specific coins to cover blockchain gas fees. Tokenum's gasless technology simplifies this process, making it easier for crypto projects to attract users and maximize revenue from each sale.\n\n3) NFT Industry Transformation\n\nTokenum's gasless technology presents an opportunity to reshape the NFT industry. NFT creators and owners can now prepay for NFT transfers, removing the burden of gas payments for users. This opens the door to entirely new audiences and streamlines the process, making it as effortless as managing digital art on Instagram or Pinterest.\n\n4) Removal of Entry Barriers for New Ecosystems\n\nTokenum also benefits new blockchains by allowing users to leverage the tokens they already have, eliminating the need to acquire blockchain-specialized coins for different networks and ecosystems. This significantly simplifies the sophisticated process of navigating and using new blockchains, platforms, or even metaverses.\n\nStory continues\n\nAll Gas No Brakes and Light-Years Ahead\n\nOne of the most notable aspects of Tokenum is its current full-fledged operational status. While other industry players, such as Circle Inc., Auros, 0xGasless, Open Zeppelin, and more, are still in the developmental stages, Tokenum is live and fully functional on the Ethereum network. The platform's future plans include expanding its support to encompass additional networks.\n\nThe AI-Powered CEO Behind Tokenum\n\nTokenum's powerful technology is spearheaded by a distinctive team, represented by Takeshi Tokenai, an AI-powered CEO. Notably, Takeshi was formally appointed as the leader on July 1, 2021, making him the world's first AI CEO. Conversely, Tokenum's technological prowess is underpinned by the collective expertise of its international team, boasting two decades of experience in the realms of cybersecurity, high technology, and blockchain. When asked to share their comments on the matter, Takeshi Tokenai's only statement was: \"Tokenum is here to take the crypto world by storm.\"\n\nWhat Lies Ahead\n\nIn summary, Tokenum's gasless technology is reshaping the cryptocurrency landscape by simplifying transactions, facilitating token sales, and supporting the growth of new blockchains. Now the project is already integrated with CyberWallet, the one of the most secure wallets at the market, and HyperID, the single identity solution. Together, they creates seamless entrance to any web3 project, space or activity for any user, regardless of their crypto skills. Tokenum is poised to become a major player in the future of cryptocurrency.\n\nCurrently, the company is offering giveaways and opportunities on its X channel (formerly Twitter), as well as on Zealy and QuestN, prominent crypto-community platforms. In the cryptocurrency world, such initiatives often signal preparations for rapid expansion and the potential launch of their own token.\n\nFor further updates and insights, please visit Tokenum's official website: https://tokenum.net\n\n\n\nJoin the conversation on Tokenum's X channel (formerly Twitter) by following @tokenum\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor more information, press inquiries, or collaboration opportunities, please contact:\n\nTakeshi Tokenai at info (at) tokenum.net\n\nDisclaimer: The information provided in this press release is not a solicitation for investment, or intended as investment advice, financial advice, or trading advice.

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s revenue hit $10 billion as demand for ETH increased over the week.\n\nNetwork activity also rose but transactions later dropped.\n\nETH, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain, had tongues wagging over the course of the just-ended week. This was because BlackRock filed for an Ethereum ETF, triggering a breakout for ETH as the coin rose above $2,000.\n\nAs expected, the increase led the broader market to assume that it is the altcoin season to shine. But while the market was fixated on the price action, the Ethereum blockchain was also hitting landmarks that it had previously dropped from.\n\nReturns get back to the highs\n\nOne such milestone was the Ethereum revenue. Eric Smith, Chief Investment Officer at 401 Financials, posted that the revenue had hit $10 million again. From the data coined from Token Terminal, the last time the Ethereum blockchain hit such levels was in July.\n\nETH price wasn\u2019t the only thing that was up yesterday. Ethereum\u2019s one day revenue hit $10 million for the first time since July. \ud83d\udcc8 via @tokenterminal pic.twitter.com/hw2wZdVtoO \u2014 Erik Smith, CFP\u00ae (@eriksmithcfp) November 10, 2023\n\nFor the unfamiliar, Ethereum makes its revenue mainly from network fees it charges users of the blockchain. Hence, the increase in revenue means that there was a surge in activity on the blockchain during the week.\n\nThe surge in revenue also means that there must have been an increase in the average gas price. According to information from Etherscan, ETH\u2019s average transaction fee tapped 57.1 on 9th November.\n\nThe Ethereum gas measures the amount of computational effort required to make transactions on the network. It also serves as a way of incentivizing validators on the blockchain. For context, validators are people responsible for keeping the Ethereum network working.\n\nActivity rises, then dips\n\nThis value was the highest in the last 30 days, meaning that there was an increase in demand for ETH. Elsewhere, Ethereum\u2019s network growth rose to 78,500. Network growth shows the number of new addresses being created on the blockchain.\n\nWhen the metric increases, it means user adoption is growing on the network. A decrease implies that traction has reduced. So, the initial jump suggests that new addresses were transacting actively on Ethereum.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ETHs worth today?\n\nBut at the time of writing, the network growth had dropped to 29,300. Like the network growth, active addresses on the Ethereum network also climbed to 459,000 on 10 November. Active addresses show the level of interaction or speculation around a token.\n\nTherefore, the metric at that time means that deposits on the network were at impressive levels. However, the press time state of the active addresses showed that the metric had decreased.\n\nLooking at the current state of Ethereum, the drop in gas fees has affected the revenue. Going forward, to surpass the $10 billion, the demand for ETH needs to increase more than it has recently."

        "content": "Share:\n\nSolana price has been one of the biggest attention grabber over the past couple of days owing to its unexpected 25% rally in a single day right before the weekend. While a specific reason cannot be deduced for the rise, the potential lies in the fact that SOL is now becoming one of the most preferred institutional assets.\n\nSolana sees institutional interest\n\nSolana is already one of the biggest cryptocurrencies in terms of gains, and the institutions seem to be observing this keenly, too. Consequently, cryptocurrency has become the most in-demand asset when it comes to institutional investors, surpassing even Ethereum.\n\nThe CoinShares weekly institutional investors\u2019 report highlights that for the week ending November 10, SOL observed inflows worth $12.4 million, which added to the monthly inflows of $23.1 million, bringing the year-to-date inflows to $121 million.\n\nEthereum and others, on the other hand, are far below SOL when it comes to year-to-date flows, although Ethereum is making slight progress this past month, as noted by the $62 million inflows since November began.\n\nSolana institutional investment\n\nThis will prove to be highly helpful for SOL in noting a boost in its value but also push the price and value of the Grayscale Solana Trust, also known as GSOL. The Grayscale investment product, following the rally in Solana price, has exploded, with the investment vehicle trading at a premium of 378% since the beginning of October.\n\nGSOL 3-day chart\n\nWhile investment product value is not considered to be an accurate measure of demand, it does highlight the rate of improvement.\n\nSolana price reverses after rally\n\nSolana price trading at $52.41 has noted a near 7% decline on the 3-day chart, with SOL noting an 18.02% decline from the intra-day trading highs of the token. The most likely outcome right now for the altcoin is slow declines followed by a reversal in the cryptocurrency\u2019s price.\n\nSOL could see a gradual decline over the next couple of days, bringing the altcoin to test the support line at $46.42. While the drawdown may not be significant, losing this support would prove to be harmful as it would extend the 24-hour losses towards the $40 level.\n\nAlthough no clear signals of a price reversal are visible, the consistent rally has overheated the market, which would need some cooldown. This might result in further decline.\n\nSOL/USD 3-day chart\n\nHowever, if Solana price bounces off the $46.42 support line and climbs back to breach the $59.03 resistance level, it would invalidate the bearish thesis and send SOL towards tagging the new highs beyond $60.\n\n\n\n"

        "title": "Cryptos surge as BlackRock Ethereum ETF plan is confirmed - Nasdaq",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) has again been making headlines and capturing the attention of crypto enthusiasts and traders. The popular digital currency has recently surged to levels not seen in almost eighteen months.\n\nSince taking out the $32,000 level of resistance near the end of October, the price of one bitcoin has surged to $38,000. The last time the bitcoin price traded near this level was over a year ago, in May 2022.\n\nBitcoin and another leading, popular digital currency, Ethereum (ETH), have also been in the headlines for reasons other than price surges. The world's largest asset manager, BlackRock, recently filed for an Ether exchange-traded fund. This move created further optimism that the crypto markets could see greater access, more significant institutional involvement, and liquidity.\n\nSo, as the price leading cryptocurrency\u2019s trade higher in part due to the potential of a regulated exchange-traded product tied to the spot price of Ethereum, it\u2019s worth looking closer at some individual stocks tied to digital currency and also noting where the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) stands with regards to approving a Bitcoin ETF.\n\nBlackRock takes steps toward launching Ethereum ETF\n\nBlackRock has officially confirmed its plans for a spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) through a filing with the SEC. The filing, submitted by Nasdaq on behalf of BlackRock, proposes an ETF named the \"iShares Ethereum Trust.\" This move signifies BlackRock's intention to expand its ETF offerings beyond Bitcoin, marking a significant step in its cryptocurrency investment strategy.\n\nThe filing comes after BlackRock registered the corporate entity \"iShares Ethereum Trust\" in Delaware, hinting at the imminent submission of a spot Ether ETF filing. Several financial firms, including BlackRock, have shown interest in cryptocurrency-backed ETFs, with at least five firms vying for SEC approval for a spot Ethereum ETF, according to Bloomberg\u2019s James Seyffart.\n\nSpeculation grows about the SEC approving a spot Bitcoin ETF\n\nSpeculation is growing about the SEC approving a spot Bitcoin ETF. Analysts have estimated a January approval at the earliest, emphasizing the SEC's cautious stance. Recent speculation suggests potential decisions on applications from BlackRock and Fidelity, but the SEC extended the timeline for the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF to Jan. 10.\n\nSo, as speculation grows and the price for several popular digital currencies surges, here\u2019s a list of four crypto-related stocks that could see rapid price appreciation should breaking news occur.\n\nFour crypto-related stocks to keep an eye on\n\nMarathon Digital (NASDAQ: MARA)\n\nMara is a Las Vegas-based digital asset technology company. The company specializes in blockchain-based mining and produces digital assets such as Bitcoin. Shares of the crypto company have skyrocketed this year, up about 180%. However, the stock has failed to join the latest crypto uptrend and, over the previous three months, fell almost 36%.\n\nMicroStrategy (NASDAQ: MSTR)\n\nMicroStrategy is a global provider of enterprise analytics software and services. MicroStrategy is actively involved with Bitcoin, holding and acquiring the cryptocurrency as part of its strategic investment strategy. As of November 1, 2023, MicroStrategy possesses 158,400 bitcoins, acquired at an average purchase price of $29,609.65 per bitcoin, resulting in a total investment of $4.69 billion.\n\nCoinbase Global (NASDAQ: COIN)\n\nCoinbase Global is a major cryptocurrency exchange offering tools for trading over 200 cryptocurrencies. COIN shares have performed exceptionally on the year by any standard, up almost 163% and recently rallying double-digits off key support in the $70s. However, analysts are not bullish on the stock, with a consensus Hold rating and a price target of $75.64, predicting almost 19% downside.\n\nRiot Platforms (NASDAQ: RIOT)\n\nRiot is a U.S. blockchain technology company that strives to be the premier provider of Bitcoin mining services in North America. The company offers cryptocurrency mining hardware, hosting services, and proprietary software. Shares of RIOT have impressed this year, to say the least, up 205%. However, the stock has failed to catch a bid off the recent sector headlines and has fallen almost 32% over the previous three months.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nFour months after departing Polygon Labs, Ryan Wyatt is joining the team supporting a totally different Ethereum scaling network: Optimism.\n\nOn Monday, the former Polygon Labs president was announced as the Chief Growth Officer for Optimism Unlimited, a newly created subsidiary of the Optimism Foundation. Wyatt will build a team to support adoption and development on Optimism across a variety of functions, including business development, marketing, partnerships, and beyond.\n\nAhead of the announcement, Wyatt described Optimism to Decrypt as having the \u201cbest team in all of crypto.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThey've really shown what they can do in the last 12 months, particularly, from both the tech perspective as well as people buying into Optimism and the ethos,\u201d he continued. \u201cI just think there's an opportunity to really ramp up the non-technical efforts of the Optimism Collective. That's what I'm good at and that's what I like doing.\u201d\n\nWyatt was with Polygon Labs from February 2022 until this past July, when the company announced that he was stepping down. Marc Boiron, previously Polygon Labs\u2019 Chief Legal Officer, stepped into a new CEO role to lead the firm as Wyatt departed. Wyatt said at the time that he planned to stay in the crypto industry.\n\nAsked why he wanted to leave Polygon Labs and take on a new challenge elsewhere in the space, Wyatt told Decrypt that his move was \u201cless about leaving Polygon\u201d and more about taking on a new challenge to grow a decentralized network that\u2019s still relatively young.\n\n\u201cThere's really a special moment in time where you get to build out a team, build out a community, stand it up, and then turn the keys over to the world. And that is a moment in time that's happening now,\u201d he said. \u201cI want, on a personal level, to be really impactful during that time, and I think there's a huge opportunity to do it at Optimism.\u201d\n\nJing Wang, co-founder of Optimism, told Decrypt that current adoption on the network has been supported by a two-person business development team. She believes that Wyatt\u2019s addition, and his plans to ramp up those efforts, will make a considerable impact.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI think Ryan can 100x adoption for us,\u201d said Wang. \u201cThat's what I'm most excited about.\u201d\n\nAt Polygon Labs, Wyatt was credited with helping to court a number of prominent brands to build on the Ethereum scaling network, including Starbucks, Nike, and Reddit. Decrypt named Polygon its 2022 project of the year based in part on the significant mainstream brand adoption that took place during that span.\n\nAsked if he will approach business development and brand adoption for Optimism like he did with Polygon, Wyatt said that some of the same tactics will come into play. However, he said that given Optimism\u2019s focus on decentralization, he plans to help encourage growth across communities rather than assemble a large, central team to try and drive adoption.\n\n\u201cOptimism is so focused and so far ahead on the decentralization front,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so there's a unique opportunity to leverage and rally around the community to be able to amplify our efforts.\u201d\n\nOptimism\u2019s OP Stack tech is already driving other networks, most notably Base, the Ethereum layer-2 network incubated by Coinbase and launched earlier this year. Base, which houses the buzzy social app Friend.tech and other applications, shows the kind of path forward that Wyatt hopes to see more broadly, with the OP Stack standing up various scaling networks.\n\n\u201cYou have Ethereum here; we want the bedrock of all the blockchains to be built on Optimism,\u201d said Wyatt. \u201cAnd that's where I think it's going, and that's where it's certainly going fast\n\nWyatt comes from a gaming and esports background, and led YouTube Gaming for several years before joining Polygon Labs. Before that, he was an esports commentator and industry executive. Wyatt said that gaming will be a significant focus for him at Optimism as he tries to drive forward adoption around digital item ownership.\n\n\u201cI truly believe that digital ownership in a certain subset of games is going to be really important,\u201d said Wyatt, affirming previous comments during his time at Polygon Labs. \u201cGaming will be very important for Optimism, and we're going to do a bunch of cool shit in gaming.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s called the OP Stack,\u201d added Wang, citing the gaming term \u201cOP\u201d or \u201coverpowered.\u201d"

The financial and market information provided on U.Today is intended for informational purposes only. U.Today is not liable for any financial losses incurred while trading cryptocurrencies. Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nEthereum's recent rally has paused, with the ETH price steadying after a substantial surge. This halt prompts investors to ask: When will Ethereum's price rally resume? Analyzing the chart and recent headlines gives us insights into possible future scenarios.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Ethereum chart indicates a recent pullback after a sharp rise in price, with the market taking a breather. This consolidation phase is healthy, as it allows the market to establish new support levels. Ethereum's price is still well above its 50-day and 100-day moving averages, suggesting the overall trend remains bullish. The relative strength index (RSI) has retreated from overbought levels, which could provide room for another price increase.\n\nBullish scenario\n\nIf Ethereum maintains its support level and avoids falling below the moving averages, the price may gear up for another rally. This could be fueled by increased adoption and positive sentiment in the market. Watch for a narrowing of Bollinger Bands, followed by a breakout above the upper band, which could signal the start of another bullish phase.\n\nBearish scenario\n\nConversely, a break below the moving averages could signal a bearish reversal. Increased selling pressure and negative market sentiment could push the price down. A bearish crossover on the MACD could confirm this, suggesting it might be time to brace for a potential downtrend.\n\nRecent data indicates that Ethereum's burn rate has reached steady growth, outpacing emissions six months following the Merge upgrade, contributing to its deflationary aspect\u200b\u200b. Despite this, Ethereum's daily burn rate hit a seven-month low on March 12, showing a more than 89% drop since the record highs\u200b\u200b. Such a dynamic in the burn rate could influence the supply and demand economics, potentially affecting the price.\n\nInvestors should watch for a continuation of the net burn trend, which could lead to decreased supply and higher prices if demand remains steady or increases\u200b\u200b.\n\nShiba Inu joins party\n\nThe meme coin frenzy continues as Shiba Inu (SHIB) grabs the spotlight with its recent price actions, stirring up discussions about whether it can breach the $0.00001 threshold this week. Amid massive transfers by Binance, a technical deep dive is essential to evaluate SHIB's potential.\n\nAnalyzing the SHIB price chart, we observe a significant uptick in its value, with the token challenging previous resistance levels. The moving average convergence divergence (MACD) shows a positive trend, with the blue MACD line well above the signal line, indicating strong bullish momentum. The relative strength index (RSI), although not in the overbought territory, is trending upward toward the 70 mark, which could signify increasing buying pressure.\n\nA crucial factor to note is the breach of the 50-day and 100-day moving averages, which SHIB has surpassed, suggesting a robust uptrend. The volume bars align with the price increase, further confirming the bullish stance among traders. Additionally, the Bollinger Bands are expanding, which typically denotes increased market volatility and a potential for large price movements.\n\nThe psychological mark of $0.00001 is within sight for Shiba Inu. For a sustained move above this level, SHIB would need to maintain its current momentum and see a continued influx of buying volume. If the price can close above this level on the daily chart, it may confirm the bullish breakout, potentially leading to further gains.\n\nRecent SHIB transfers by Binance have added to the speculative fire. Such large-scale movements can be indicative of institutional interest or significant traders taking positions, which in turn can lead to dramatic price movements.\n\nThe current technical setup for SHIB is promising, with the potential to reach and exceed the $0.00001 mark. However, investors should remain cautious, as meme coins can be highly volatile and sensitive to market sentiment. Keeping an eye on the aforementioned technical indicators and the news around large transfers will be key in determining whether SHIB can maintain its upward trajectory."

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nBitcoin, Ethereum and Polygon are experiencing a remarkable surge in large-scale transactions, also known as \"whale transactions.\"\n\nNotably, Bitcoin has seen an 80% increase in transactions valued over $100,000.\n\nSimilarly, Ethereum's large transactions have soared by 170%, while Polygon has witnessed an unprecedented rise of over 3,800% compared to their respective volumes just 30 days ago.\n\nLarge transactions\n\nData from the past week highlights the scale of this uptick in high-value transactions. Bitcoin recorded 16,410 transactions in the last 24 hours, peaking at 22,570 transactions on Nov. 9. The lowest was 12,810 transactions on Nov. 5.\n\nIn terms of transaction volume, Bitcoin saw $24.4 billion in the last 24 hours, with a high of $39.02 billion and a low of $18.1 billion within the same week. Ethereum's large transaction count stood at 3,560 in the last 24 hours, reaching a seven-day high of 7,590 transactions and a low of 3,040.\n\nIts transaction volume echoed this trend, with $2.91 billion in the last 24 hours, peaking at $6.59 billion and a low of $2.47 billion.\n\nFor Polygon, the number of large transactions reached a seven-day high of 209 transactions, the same as its count in the last 24 hours, with a low of 34 transactions. The transaction volume mirrored this surge, with the last 24 hours seeing $194.42 million, a seven-day high of $357.59 million and a low of $28.81 million.\n\nRenewed institutional demand\n\nThe significant increase in whale transactions across these cryptocurrencies is largely attributed to renewed institutional interest. The crypto market is abuzz with anticipation for the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs by January 2024, a development that is expected to further fuel institutional demand.\n\nAdditionally, BlackRock's plans to introduce a spot Ethereum ETF have added to this excitement. Institutional demand plays a crucial role in the crypto market, as it not only brings substantial capital but also lends credibility and stability to the digital currency ecosystem.\n\nThe entry of large financial players and the creation of more accessible investment vehicles like ETFs are seen as key drivers for long-term growth and mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrencies."

The spike comes as investors anticipate the potential approval of a physically-backed Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the US.\n\n\u201cEthereum, saw its largest inflows since August 2022 of US$49m, with the last 2 weeks signifying a real turnaround in sentiment, likely related to the recent spot-based ETF listing request,\u201d said James Butterfill, Head of Research at CoinShares.\n\nThe asset manager said the flows indicate a distinct turnaround in investor sentiment, likely fueled by BlackRock\u2019s move to file for an Ethereum spot ETF last week.\n\nOverall, digital asset funds saw $293 million in inflows last week across crypto products, marking the seventh consecutive week of inflows. Bitcoin products attracted $240 million, bringing their year-to-date inflows to over $1 billion.\n\nExchange-traded product (ETP) trading volumes have also increased, making up nearly 20% of total Bitcoin volumes on trusted exchanges and suggesting more ETP investor participation compared to the 2020 and 2021 rallies.\n\nThe streak of inflows has pushed total assets under management in crypto investment products to $44.3 billion, a 99% increase since the start of 2023.\n\nBlockchain equity ETFs also saw their highest inflows since July 2022 at $14 million. Their year-to-date flows have now turned positive at $11 million after substantial outflows for most of 2022.\n\nETH is up 1.7% over the past 24 hours, according to CoinGecko."

        "content": "Ethereum price like many of its peers is struggling to uphold a higher support amid widespread declines. This elevated support area, preferably at $2,000 could determine where ETH price goes after the current consolidation. On the upside, resistance at $2,130 must come down for gains to start increasing toward $2,500 and $3,000. However, losing immediate support could force Ethereum to seek fresh liquidity at lower support levels, for example, in the region between $1,800 and $1,900.\n\nInvestors turned their attention to Ethereum after news broke that BlackRock had made the first step toward filing for an ETH spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nadvertisement\n\nAlthough the news directly impacted Ethereum price, other cryptos broke out too, including Bitcoin, which hit a new year-to-date high of $38,000.\n\nEthereum price although bullish had corrected to trade at $2,032 at the time of writing, on Tuesday during US business hours. A higher support, preferably at $2,000 would go a long way to help sustain the uptrend, but for now, let\u2019s dive into the burgeoning Ethereum assets under management (AUM).\n\nEthereum Records Highest Weekly AUM Inflows In Months\n\nThe previous week was extremely eventful for the crypto market, but more especially for Ethereum. In addition to the spot ETF filing, CoinShares latest report indicated that Ethereum AUM inflows rose to $49 million\u2014the highest since August.\n\nInflows generally increased across the board totaling $293 million, cumulatively \u201cbringing this 7-week run of inflows past the $1 billion mark, leaving year-to-date inflows at $1.14,\u201d the CoinShares report said.\n\nDigital asset investment products saw inflows totalling US$293m last week, bringing this 7-week run of inflows past the US$1bn mark. Ethereum, saw its largest inflows since August 2022 of US$49m. Solana also saw further inflows totalling US$12m. https://t.co/peTZ1nIE2q \u2014 Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) November 13, 2023\n\nThe spike in ETH AUM inflows reinforces the bullish sentiment \u201clikely related to the recent spot-based ETF listing request in the US.\u201d\n\nEthereum Price Upholds Bullish Outlook\n\nEthereum price started the new week in the green, up 8% in the last seven days and 32% in the last month. The resistance at $2,130 was expected, considering it rejected the bulls in April this year.\n\nA minor deep would confirm the strength from support at $2,000 and pave the way for a short consolidation period before Ethereum price triggers another breakout; this time aiming for highs above $3,000.\n\nThe path with the least resistance is to the upside based on the bullish thesis flaunted by the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator. As long as the momentum indicator moves higher above the neutral zone and the blue MACD line\u2019s position above the red signal line, traders and investors are likely to continue betting on more gains over the next few weeks.\n\nA couple of bullish crosses further cement the bullish narrative. A golden cross occurs in support of an ongoing uptrend and manifests with a short-term MA crossing above a long-term MA.\n\nIn Ethereum\u2019s case, the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) started by crossing above the 100-day EMA ahead of the second one with the 50-EMA flipping above the 200-day EMA.\n\nThe last time Ethereum price formed these bullish crosses, it went ahead and surged to $2,130 from the January 2023 low of $1,190. Therefore, the formation of these two patterns is a significant bullish signal.\n\nRelated Articles"

        "content": "BITCOIN, ETHEREUM FORECAST:\n\nAccording to Reports the Spot Bitcoin ETF Decisions will be Received by November 17.\n\nETH Spot ETF Filing Sparks a Rally as ETH Meets Key Resistance Level.\n\nBTC/ USD is in Overbought Territory and there is a Chance of a Pullback if the Spot Bitcoin ETF News Does Not Come Through.\n\nTo Learn More About Price Action , Chart Patterns and Moving Averages , Check out the DailyFX Education Series .\n\nREAD MORE: Short USD/JPY: A Reprieve in the DXY Rally and FX Intervention by the BoJ\n\nRecommended by Zain Vawda Get Your Free Bitcoin Forecast Get My Guide\n\nWEEK IN REVIEW\n\nThe Cryptocurrency market surged this week as news filtered through about the listing of the Ethereum Spot ETF by BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager. This comes after a similar move by BlackRock in regard to their iShares Spot Bitcoin ETF which was registered in Delaware 7 days before they filed an ETF application. Towards the back end of October news filtered through that the Spot Bitcoin ETF application had been an approved which sent crypto markets in a frenzy and allowing Bitcoin to convincingly break above the key $30k mark This turned out to be a hoax, but the optimism doesn\u2019t seem to have subsided.\n\nFollowing the Delaware listing yesterday Ethereum and crypto markets in general rallied in what could be described as a potential case of \u201cbuy the rumor, sell the news\u201d. Personally, I think this could prove to be different given the potential influx of demand should the Bitcoin and Ethereum Spot ETFs be approved. The client base who are eyeing an addition of crypto to their portfolios are likely to be long-term holders which could mean that should an approval occur the reaction in the first few days could be massive before we see a significant tail off in both volatility and demand. Of course, BlackRock are not the only asset manager waiting on approval with 12 other applications being submitted to the SEC for approval. One can see the excitement at the possibility of both ETFs being approved in the Fear and Greed Index which has hit the 70 mark up from 47 a month ago and 65 last week.\n\nSource: FinancialJuice\n\nLOOKING AHEAD AT CRYPTO MARKETS, BITCOIN AND ETEHEREUM\n\nLooking at the week ahead and one thing which has become more apparent of late is that Bitcoin and Crypto seem to be at odds with market conditions. Just looking at developments since tension broke out in the Middle East and despite risk off sentiment for quite while Bitcoin and Crypto remained largely unaffected.\n\nThe recent fluctuations in the Dollar as well have largely left Crypto unaffected as markets grapple with whether Central Banks are done on the rate hike cycle. Looking at the week ahead and one of the major events that could come to fruition is a potential 8-day window between November 9-November 17 in which all 12 US Bitcoin spot ETF filings could be approved by the SEC. This came courtesy of Bloomberg Intelligence Analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas.\n\nRecommended by Zain Vawda Get Your Free Introduction To Cryptocurrency Trading Get My Guide\n\nIf this is true, this could turn out to be a big week for Crypto as I expect a lot of volatility and a potential surge in price in the days that follow. Demand for Bitcoin will likely skyrocket with another beneficiary likely to be Coinbase as well. This could be a game changer for the industry as a whole and put a mainstream stamp of approval at a time when the US Congress looks to crack down further on the Crypto Industry. Just this week we heard from SEC Chair Gensler who stated that Crypto is used for illicit activities. This was ramped up in the US Congress as well, which is why the approval of the Bitcoin ETF is even more important now.\n\nOn a data front we do have US CPI and PPI data releases which could have a huge impact on the US Dollar. The question that will remain though given the recent lack of US Dollar effect on BTCUSD, is whether any significant change in the US Dollar outlook will outweigh the current optimism around the crypto industry.\n\nFor all market-moving economic releases and events, see the DailyFX Calendar\n\nTECHNICAL OUTLOOK AND FINAL THOUGHTS\n\nLooking at the technical perspective and BTCUSD has had quite a sizeable run to the upside with very little retracement over the past month. This has seen the RSI (14) into overbought territory which could mean we are in for some form of retracement.\n\nHowever, the RSI is not always accurate and there is a chance we may see another rally toward the $40k mark before we do see a pullback. Now this will all depend on the Spot Bitcoin ETF application and if any news of approval or not develops in the week ahead.\n\nKey Levels to Keep an Eye On:\n\nSupport Levels\n\n36000\n\n34639\n\n34177\n\nResistance Levels\n\n37609\n\n40000\n\n42500\n\nBTC/USD Weekly Chart \u2013 November 10, 2023\n\nSource: TradingView\n\nETHEREUM\n\nLooking at the developments in ETHUSD on a weekly timeframe and this week puts ETH on course for its best week of gains since the week starting 10 April 2023. We have however run into a key level of resistance around the 2125 handle which was the YTD high, also printed in April 2023.\n\nETHUSD remains within a wedge pattern that has been in play since June-July of 2022. What is of more interest to me, however, is the MAs which are about to cross over with the 50-day MA eyeing a cross above the 200-day MA. We saw this on Bitcoin before the explosion toward the $38k high this week. SO, is history going to repeat itself?\n\nThe only apprehension here is that ETHUSD is currently on its 4th successive week of gains for the first time since January 2023. Then it was followed by some consolidation over the next 4 weeks. This may be the case as well given that Spot ETF Bitcoin approval could see some market participants opt to sell ETH and pile more into Bitcoin, the Good old FOMO.\n\nBTC/USD Daily Chart \u2013 November 10, 2023\n\nSource: TradingView\n\nKey Levels to Keep an Eye On:\n\nSupport Levels\n\n106.09\n\n105.63\n\n104.28\n\nResistance Levels\n\n107.20\n\n108.00\n\n109.50\n\nTrade Smarter - Sign up for the DailyFX Newsletter Receive timely and compelling market commentary from the DailyFX team Subscribe to Newsletter\n\nWritten by: Zain Vawda, Market Writer for DailyFX.com\n\nContact and follow Zain on Twitter: @zvawda"

        "content": "Last month, Hayes made a similar forecast, noting that Bitcoin could reach from $750,000 to $1 million towards the end of the current decade.\n\nAfter his visit to Rapa Nui, commonly known as Easter Island, Arthur Hayes, the co-founder and former CEO of leading crypto derivatives platform BitMEX, has once again predicted that Bitcoin (BTC) could reach $1 million, with Ethereum (ETH) soaring to $100,000.\n\nIn an unexpected turn, Hayes humorously hinted that the island\u2019s ancestors might have provided him with a tip-off on the impending bull market that could lead to the explosion of the two crypto assets.\n\nArthur Hayes Bullish on Bitcoin\n\nDespite lacking any known roots in Rapa Nui, he suggested that, according to his ancestral guidance, the bull market is now, and the digital asset industry is about to take a different turn after the prolonged crypto winter.\n\nWhether Hayes genuinely believes in the soaring prospects of BTC and Ether or if he was playfully engaging with his followers on X, formerly Twitter remains unclear.\n\nThis summer I visited the ancestors in Rapa Nui and I asked them when the bull market would arrive? They told me to be patient, read the words of the Lord, and I would know when to YOLO. The time is now!$BTC = $1mm$ETH = $100k Yachtzee bitches!!! pic.twitter.com/ufV9nthSDg \u2014 Arthur Hayes (@CryptoHayes) November 10, 2023\n\nBefore now, the former BitMEX CEO predicted that the BTC soaring to $1 million is possible after the United States Federal Reserve decided to halt interest rate hikes and maintain the rate within the levels of 5.25% to 5.5%.\n\nLast month, Hayes made a similar forecast, noting that Bitcoin could reach from $750,000 to $1 million towards the end of the current decade, particularly in 2026.\n\n\u201cI absolutely agree that there is going to be a major financial crisis, probably as bad or worse than the great depression, sometime near the end of the decade; before we get there, we\u2019re gonna have, I think, the largest bull market in stocks, real estate, crypto, art, you name it, that we\u2019ve ever seen since WW2.\u201d\n\nIn a detailed blog post providing extensive insights into how the crypto asset could attain such ambitious heights, the former BitMEX CEO introduced a concept known as \u201cThe Doom Loop.\u201d According to him, this intricate phenomenon represents three fundamental actions undertaken by countries globally to finance their deficits:\n\nSelling debt to domestic entities\n\nSelling debt to foreigners\n\nResorting to the central bank\u2019s printing of money\n\nHayes believes this phenomenon will trigger the next bull market where the crypto asset could attain the predicted price.\n\nBTC Could Reach $43 000 This Year\n\nMeanwhile, with BTC currently hovering around $ 36,000 to $37,000 for the first time since 2022, veteran crypto trader and analyst Peter Brandt forecasted that the crypto asset could reach $43,200 this year.\n\nBrandt previously offered a long-term forecast for Bitcoin, suggesting that the crypto asset would enter an active growth phase no sooner than the third quarter of 2024, following the upcoming halving in April. He also emphasized that the crypto market has surpassed cyclical lows as experienced last year during the collapse of crypto exchange FTX in November, during which BTC plummeted to $15,000."

        "content": "Tether Issued 4B USDT on Tron and Ethereum Networks: Report\n\nMajor stablecoin issuer Tether has significantly increased its issuance of new USDT assets, reaching a total of $4 billion in the past month.\n\nWhale Alert, sharing this information on its Telegram channel, disclosed that Tether had minted an additional $1 billion worth of USDT on the Tron blockchain on November 10. This occurrence is a recent example of the stablecoin maker\u2019s growing printing exercises.\n\nReacting to the report, Tether\u2019s chief technology officer (CTO) Paolo Ardoino stated that the $1 billion USDT is an inventory replenishment on the Tron blockchain.\n\nArdoino explained that the stated amount is authorized but not issued, meaning that it would be used as an inventory for the next period of issuance requests and chain swaps.\n\nPSA: 1B USDt inventory replenish on Tron Network. Note this is an authorized but not issued transaction, meaning that this amount will be used as inventory for next period issuance requests and chain swaps. \u2014 Paolo Ardoino \ud83c\udf50 (@paoloardoino) November 10, 2023\n\nPrior to this, Tether minted $1 billion of USDT on the Ethereum blockchain on November 9. This was complemented by a notable issuance of an additional $2 billion in fiat-backed stablecoins in two tranches on the Tron network on November 3 and October 19, as revealed by Whale Alert.\n\nThese figures push Tether\u2019s minting spree to a total of $4 billion in USDT in the past month. However, this does not represent the final target for the blockchain-based platform in terms of minted USDT tokens for the year.\n\nAccording to data from Whale Alert, Tether is looking to print 22.75 billion USDT in 2023, with 13 billion (57%) to be issued on the Tron blockchain. The remaining 9.75 billion (43%) is expected to be added to the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nTo achieve this aim, Tether has been actively minting new tokens. In March 2023, the issuer printed 9 billion USDT tokens, adding to its already released 3 billion created in the past month.\n\nFollowing this, Tether further released 3.75 billion USDT tokens between June and July.\n\nBurning Alongside Minting\n\n\n\nFiat-backed stablecoins are usually pegged 1:1 with the fiat currency they are tracking.\n\nTo maintain this peg, many stablecoin issuers often hold cash or cash equivalents corresponding to the quantity of digital tokens in circulation.\n\nAn innovative approach gaining traction involves burning or permanently retiring a preset amount of tokens from open circulation.\n\nWhile buffering up its stablecoin portfolio, the USDT makers have also towed this unlikeliest of paths.\n\nAlthough burning often reduces the amount of an asset in circulation, thereby leading to an increase in value due to less supply relative to demand, it works differently in the case of the USDT stablecoin.\n\nIt only ensures that the value of the tokenized greenback does not fall below the $1 peg.\n\nFor instance, Tether burned 1.2 billion USDT tokens on the Tron blockchain on August 22.\n\nThis event was preceded by a similar activity in June that saw 3.1 billion USDT on the Tron protocol and 2 billion USDT on the Ethereum network permanently removed from circulation.\n\nWe're quite close to add another extremely powerful piece of the puzzle for @Tether_to ecosystem. Total of 5 mind-blowing projects (and counting) for 2024.\n\nCouple of these could obliterate some popular Web2 centralized services for good. Pure Real World Ecosystem aka \"Things\u2026 \u2014 Paolo Ardoino \ud83c\udf50 (@paoloardoino) November 12, 2023\n\nMeanwhile, the stablecoin issuer is seemingly working on a new series of crypto-backed products scheduled for release in 2024.\n\nMaking this known, the platform\u2019s CTO Paolo Ardoino stated that Tether is working on five new products that people could actually need."

        "content": "TLDR\n\nEthereum (ETH) whales\u2019 increased holdings, reaching 32% of supply , and a surge in transactions over $1 million mark a historic moment for the cryptocurrency. Analyzing CoinMarketCap data, a $100 investment in 2016 would yield $17,936, with ETH priced at $1,888 on November 9, 2023.\n\nNuggetRush (NUGX) introduces practical utility to meme coins, offering a play-to-earn (P2E) game where players build a mining empire, earning income through quests, battles, and tournaments. The game supports artisanal mining communities, making NUGX stand out.\n\nThe excitement in Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) community is intense as whales significantly increase their token holdings, reaching levels not seen since 2016. Meanwhile, a new player, NuggetRush (NUGX), is revolutionizing meme coins with practical utility and play-to-earn features, gaining significant attention in the presale stage. Can NuggetRush thrive to follow in Ethereum\u2019s lead?\n\n>>Buy NuggetRush Now<<\n\nEthereum (ETH) Whales Drive Excitement in the Market as Their Holdings Surge\n\nEthereum\u2019s community is excited as ETH whales have increased their token holdings considerably. On October 19, 2023, Santiment data showed the whales now control over 32% of the available ETH supply, a level not seen since 2016.\n\nFurthermore, Ethereum transactions exceeding $1 million recorded their second-highest volume in five weeks. These developments undoubtedly mark a historic moment in Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) history.\n\nBased on CoinMarketCap\u2019s historical data, the price of ETH on November 9, 2016, was $10.51 per coin. If you acquired $100 worth of Ethereum, you would have about 9.5 ETH.\n\nEthereum (ETH) traded at $1,888 on November 9, 2023. Thus, anyone who purchased the 9.5 ETH in 2016 and still holds the coins would be sitting on $17,936 in 2023. That is an impressive return on investment for Ethereum (ETH).\n\nWith such a high ROI, Ethereum (ETH) is undoubtedly among the top crypto coins to invest in currently. Its many use cases and increasing whale demand might help push it well above $2,000 by the end of 2023. Hence, it is a good crypto to buy today.\n\nDespite the x179 profits, a new entrant seems ready to compete with Ethereum (ETH) in the long term. NuggetRush has many features and utilities that have attracted many investors despite still being in the presale stage.\n\nNuggetRush (NUGX) Revolutionizes Meme Coins with Practical Utility and P2E Features\n\nPreviously, meme coins lacked practical utility and have always been highly volatile. Nonetheless, all that seems to have changed with the entry of NuggetRush (NUGX). Resembling other play-to-earn (P2E) games, NuggetRush (NUGX) allows players to earn an income using enjoyable in-game experiences.\n\n>>Buy NuggetRush Now<<\n\nNuggetRush (NUGX) consists of creating a mining empire through site discovery and teamwork. Players set up mining facilities, collect rare non-fungible tokens (NFTs), trade available in-game assets, and build expert teams to achieve \u201cmaster miner\u201d status. The status enables them to amass significant wealth through their mining empire.\n\nAdditionally, NuggetRush (NUGX) offers multiple income streams through in-game activities and operations. On that note, players earn rewards from quests, battles, and tournaments. They can also sell in-game collectibles on NuggetRush\u2019s marketplace.\n\nImpressively, this game supports artisanal mining communities in remote and underdeveloped nations. All these use cases undoubtedly make NUGX a great crypto to buy.\n\nNuggetRush\u2019s governance model offers Rush Guild members access to different areas and the power to vote for decisions connected to NUGX\u2019s ecosystem.\n\nPlayers can claim tokens as NuggetRush\u2019s presale progresses. Each round of this presale offers token-claiming chances for NUGX token holders. However, once NuggetRush\u2019s presale concludes, investors can claim any remaining tokens.\n\nNUGX surged from its Round 1 price of $0.010 to $0.012 in Round 2 of the presale, a 20% ROI. Analysts say NUGX has the potential to surge further by over x300 after listing on mainstream exchanges. These impressive potential moves make it a top crypto to buy now.\n\nVisit NuggetRush Presale Website\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

This is a high-risk investment and you should not expect to be protected if something goes wrong.\n\nAltcoins offer a great alternative to Bitcoin, especially those with a lower market capitalization \u2013 after all, Bitcoin is already valued at several hundred billion dollars, so there is a greater upside with altcoins.\n\nIn this guide, we analyze the 16 best altcoins to buy in 2024, looking at some of the best new altcoins to buy \u2013 such as presale projects like Bitcoin ETF Token, Wall Street Memes, Thug Life, and yPredict, which offer high upside potential \u2013 and the most popular altcoins like Ethereum and Dogecoin, which have grown to be some of the biggest altcoins on the market.\n\nRead on to discover new altcoins that have the potential to explode.\n\nThe Best Altcoins to Invest in 2024 Listed below are the 16 best altcoins to invest in 2023: Bitcoin ETF Token \u2013 An innovative ERC20 token offering dynamic token burns and high staking rewards, closely tied to the U.S. SEC\u2019s potential approval of a Bitcoin spot ETF. The platform raised nearly $500K in under a week of launch, showing strong community support. Wall Street Memes \u2013 $WSM is a trendy meme coin from the Wall St Bulls NFT creators that has raised over $12.8 million USDT in a month. Even Elon Musk has interacted with WSM\u2019s Twitter post, highlighting its viral traction. Thug Life \u2013 Hot new community-centric meme altcoin currently on presale that offers 70% of the total supply at a fixed price. With over $490K raised in a week and a hard cap of $2.058 million, the coin showed strong community support. It also reserves 15% of the supply for community rewards. yPredict \u2013 This new cryptocurrency project is also in presale, having raised $1.2 million so far. yPredict is building a decentralized marketplace for predictive models. Designed by data scientists and quants, yPredict models enable traders to make smart and informed decisions. Its native altcoin, YPRED, is currently being sold at a 70% discount, compared to its exchange listing price. Ecoterra \u2013 This is an up-and-coming altcoin project building a greener future. Through a recycle-to-earn infrastructure, ecoterra rewards users for recycling unwanted goods. It is also building a carbon-offsetting ecosystem alongside a recycled raw materials marketplace.

This includes access to exclusive NFT launches and private presales, not to mention unreleased P2E games and fractionalized assets. LPX tokens are currently being sold via the Launchpad XYZ presale. AiDoge \u2013 AiDoge is a new altcoin project that is currently in presale. Its proprietary tool combines artificial intelligence and blockchain technology to create memes. Users simply need to type in what meme they want, and AiDoge will generate one instantly. AI tokens, the native altcoin backing AiDoge, are required to create memes. More than $9 million has been raised in the AiDoge presale, making this one of the best altcoins to buy for future growth. Scorpion Casino \u2013 Crypto-powered online gaming and sports betting platform that has raised over $450K in its ongoing $SCORP token presale.

It is also building a metaverse, enabling users to buy land and build virtual offices. All transactions in the DeeLance ecosystem are conducted in DLANCE. This is also a presale altcoin offering discounts to early investors. Ethereum \u2013 This is the largest altcoin by market capitalization. Ethereum enables developers to execute decentralized smart contracts. Thousands of projects, known as ERC-20 tokens, operate on the Ethereum blockchain. This gives the project\u2019s native altcoin, ETH, unprecedented demand. Ripple (XRP) \u2013 This established altcoin project enables banks and financial institutions to conduct cross-border transactions.

Arbitrum \u2013 This innovative project has developed a layer 2 solution for the Ethereum blockchain. This means Ethereum-based transactions are cheaper, faster, and more scalable. Crucially, Arbitrum not only benefits Ethereum but the many thousands of ERC-20 tokens in the market. Dogecoin \u2013 While Dogecoin transactions are faster and cheaper than Bitcoin, it is primarily a meme coin investment. Currently, Dogecoin is trading at a bear market discount of over 90%. This may appeal to investors that believe Dogecoin will return to its former all-time high of $0.74 during the next bull run. Uniswap \u2013 This project was launched in 2020 and offers decentralized trading services. Uniswap uses an automated market maker protocol, enabling users to swap tokens without a third party.

Readers should do their own homework before risking any money.\n\nThe Best Altcoins List in 2024\n\nIn this section, we take a much closer look at the best altcoins to buy for 2024. We explore each altcoin in great detail, including its use cases, long-term potential, and risks.\n\n1. Bitcoin ETF Token \u2013 Overall Best Altcoin With High Passive Income Potential, Raised Nearly $500K In A Week\n\nThe Bitcoin ETF Token is a promising new ERC20 token that offers a unique, rewarding opportunity tied closely to the developments surrounding the approval of a Bitcoin spot ETF by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This project stands out due to its dynamic tokenomics, including token burn mechanisms and high staking rewards.\n\nThe Bitcoin ETF Token introduces a token burn strategy linked to significant milestones in the Bitcoin ETF journey. Up to 25% of the total token supply, which amounts to 525 million tokens, will be permanently removed from circulation upon achieving certain key events.\n\nThese events include significant trading volume milestones for the token, the approval and launch of the first Bitcoin ETF, the total assets under management for all Bitcoin ETFs reaching $1 billion, and Bitcoin\u2019s price exceeding $100,000.\n\nThe platform\u2019s recently launched presale is structured across 10 stages, offering 84 million tokens in each stage. The pricing of these tokens will rise progressively from $0.005 in the first stage to $0.0068 in the final presale stage.\n\nCurrently, buyers can grab the $BTCETF tokens for $0.0052 per token. Nearly $500,000 has already been raised in under a week, showing strong community support.\n\nMoreover, early participants in the presale can benefit from an exceptionally high APY of over 500% for staking their tokens.\n\nThis lucrative offer, primarily available in the early stages of the presale, is designed to improve the appeal of holding onto the tokens while awaiting the Bitcoin ETF\u2019s approval.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that the APY is expected to decrease as more tokens are staked, suggesting a strategic advantage for early stakers.\n\nInvestors can buy $BTCETF tokens using Ethereum (ETH), Tether (USDT), or a credit card through an Ethereum-based wallet like MetaMask.\n\nThe total token supply is capped at 2.1 billion, with 840 million allocated for the presale and an additional 525 million reserved for staking rewards.\n\nFor those interested in staying updated on the latest developments around the Bitcoin ETF Token and the broader context of the Bitcoin spot ETF approval, following their updates on various platforms like X (Twitter) and joining the platform\u2019s Telegram channel is advisable.\n\nHard Cap $4.956 Million Total Tokens 2.1 Billion Tokens available in presale 840 Million Blockchain Ethereum Network Token type ERC-20 Minimum Purchase NA Purchase with USDT, ETH, BNB, MATIC, Card\n\n2. Wall Street Memes \u2013 Altcoin With Strong Community Backing of Over a Million Followers, Raised Over $12.8 Million In a Month\n\nThe recent meme crypto bull run mirrors the remarkable rise of GameStop and AMC stocks back in 2021, creating a new wave of affordable meme tokens.\n\nEthereum NFT creator Wall St Bulls, known for its strong following, has tapped into this trend with the debut of its Wall Street Memes token ($WSM).\n\nBuilding on their successful 2021 Ethereum NFT collection, which sold out within half an hour, Wall St Bulls has ventured into Bitcoin NFTs and meme tokens, aligning with the latest trends.\n\nTheir strong follower base of over a million people lays a strong foundation for the $WSM token.\n\nInvestors should remember that meme tokens, while having a high return potential, also carry significant risks. But tokens with strong community support often see long-term success.\n\nFrom its $30 million hard cap, the project raised over $12.8 million in just a month, showing strong investor enthusiasm.\n\nStrong community backing safeguards against \u2018pump and dump\u2019 trends typically associated with meme tokens. Wall Street Memes\u2019 community backing could grab the attention of big crypto exchanges like Binance.\n\nMoreover, notable figures like Elon Musk have also shown interest, interacting with WSM\u2019s Twitter posts.\n\nAs per the Wall Street Memes whitepaper, the $WSM presale offers investors 50% of its two-billion token pool. The rest are reserved for community rewards (30%) and exchange liquidity (20%).\n\nThis strategy eliminates potential market dumping from team tokens, a concern observed in other cryptos. Additionally, $50k has been allocated for an airdrop to reward active community members on their social media platforms.\n\nJoin the Wall Street Memes Telegram channel to stay updated with the presale progress.\n\nVisit Wall Street Memes\n\n3. Thug Life \u2013 Hot New Meme Crypto with 15% Supply Reserved For Community Rewards, Raised Over $490K in a Week\n\nThug Life ($THUG) is a community-focused meme altcoin that offers a chance for those who missed the earlier meme coin boom.\n\nThug Life\u2019s presale uses a one-round model where 70% of the total 4.2 billion $THUG supply (around 2.94 billion tokens) is available at a fixed rate of $0.0007 USDT.\n\nThis setup offers an equal opportunity for all investors to buy tokens, discouraging any dumping by early investors. The ongoing presale seeks to hit a target of $2.058 million.\n\nThe community-centric strategy of Thug Life is showing promise, as $THUG raised over $490K in a week of its launch.\n\nWhile its website indicates that $THUG doesn\u2019t offer immediate utility, its main aim is to build a strong community. This approach has helped coins like Pepe fetch returns that surpassed even Bitcoin and Ethereum this year.\n\nOnce the presale ends, $THUG will be available on decentralized exchanges (DEXs). Also, after listing, 15% of the token supply will be set aside for airdrops and giveaways to community members. This incentive aims to create community growth and loyalty among $THUG owners.\n\nTo ensure price stability and medium-term growth, Thug Life intends to lock the liquidity pool for three months post-launch. To lower scam risks, the Thug Life team has set aside no tokens for themselves, further reinforcing trust among investors.\n\nTo stay informed about $THUG, you can join the Thug Life Telegram channel.\n\nVisit Thug Life\n\n4. yPredict \u2013 Decentralized Marketplace for Buying and Selling AI Predictive Models\n\nyPredict (YPRED) is also one of the best new altcoins to buy at presale prices with the project developing a decentralized marketplace for predictive models.\n\nThese are high-level data sets backed by artificial intelligence and machine learning. Built by data scientists and quants, yPredict models enable traders to make smart investment decisions.\n\nFor example, there are predictive models that can automate the technical analysis process. Put simply, the model will alert users when an indicator flags a reading, such as overbought conditions or increased volatility. This enables traders to streamline the analysis process.\n\nIn another example, yPredict also offers predictive models that yield altcoin trading signals. For example, the signal might suggest short-selling ETH/USD at an entry price of $1,900. The yPredict signal will also provide the suggested limit, stop-loss, and take-profit order prices.\n\nIn order to access yPredict models, users will need to subscribe via a three-tired monthly fee set by the model creator and payable in YPRED tokens. This ensures that YPRED has real-world utility.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, YPRED can also be used for staking, which yields a share of the revenue generated from prediction model subscriptions.\n\nOn the flip side, do remember that yPredict will only be as successful as the predictive models it sells. If there isn\u2019t enough demand for its models, this will have a negative impact on the value of YPRED. To counter this risk, all yPredict models must go through a vetting process. Put simply, the yPredict DAO will test each model before it is listed on the marketplace.\n\nThose looking to buy yPredict tokens can do so via the presale. Having raised $1.2 million so far, the presale is quickly gaining traction. Currently, YPRED tokens are available to buy at just $0.07. This will soon increase by 28% to $0.09. After the presale, YPRED will be listed on an exchange at $0.12. That\u2019s a 70% upside for current presale investors.\n\n5. Ecoterra \u2013 Green Altcoin Project Developing a Recycle-to-Earn Network\n\nEcoterra (ECOTERRA) is one of the best altcoins to invest in for exposure to green innovation. Its ecosystem, built on the Ethereum blockchain, offers various features to help the world become a more sustainable place and has developed a recycle-to-earn concept that incentivizes people to recycle.\n\nWhether it\u2019s glass, plastics, or clothing \u2013 users will receive ECOTERRA tokens when recycling consumed or unwanted items. Users will first need to open the ecoterra mobile app to find their nearest reverse vending machine (RVM). Then, the user will scan the recycled items via the app before depositing them in the RVM.\n\nThe Ecoterra app will then credit the user\u2019s wallet with ECOTERRA tokens. The long-term aim is to have RVMs installed globally, ensuring that ecoterra users can recycle with ease.\n\nNot only will this secure the lowest price possible but when paying with ECOTERRA tokens, discounts are available. Ecoterra will also enable users to offset their carbon footprint, achieved by using ECOTERRA tokens to purchase tokenized carbon credits that are then removed from circulation.\n\nAs well as being sold on exchanges, ECOTERRA can be used to fund other green activities such as ocean clean up or tree planting.\n\nEcoterra is also building a marketplace for businesses \u2013 this will provide access to a global database of recycled raw materials at discounted prices.\n\nECOTERRA tokens are currently available to buy via the Ecoterra presale. Rated as one of our best crypto presales, it has already raised $4 million, and early investors will secure a discounted price.\n\nCurrently, ECOTERRA can be purchased at $0.00775 per token but the exchange listing price after the presale will be $0.01 \u2013 30% above the current price.\n\n6. Chimpzee \u2013 Green Crypto With High Staking Rewards of Up To 20%, Raised Over $725K\n\nChimpzee is a new crypto project that merges eco-friendly actions with digital incentives. It uses the CHMPZ token to promote environmental progress and widens the usual blockchain applications.\n\n10% of Chimpzee tokens and a portion of profits go toward green initiatives. Chimpzee also partners with eco-friendly groups, showing its commitment to eco-friendly change.\n\nThe CHMPZ presale is an attractive entry point for investors, with over $725k raised already, hinting at strong community support.\n\nThe platform\u2019s key features, like Play-to-Earn, Shop-to-Earn, and Trade-to-Earn, encourage users to earn while supporting the environment.\n\nThe platform\u2019s Zero Tolerance Game forms the Play-to-Earn aspect. Players can earn CHMPZ tokens by reaching game milestones, making gameplay even more rewarding.\n\nChimpzee\u2019s shop offers a Shop-to-Earn model, where selling branded items earns users CHMPZ tokens and some of the profits go to green causes.\n\nThe Chimpzee whitepaper highlights that it also hosts an NFT marketplace using a Trade-to-Earn model, sharing trading fee profits with its users.\n\nThe Chimpzee Diamond NFT passport, available only during the first six presale stages, offers special benefits. These include a 20% staking APY and access to an AI-powered mobile app, helping users to increase their CHMPZ holdings.\n\nThe AI-based mobile app creates unique avatars for the NFT passport, which can be used in a play-to-earn game to support the environment and boost passive income.\n\nThus far, Chimpzee has funded the planting of 20,000 trees and donated $15K to elephant protection via the WILD Foundation.

Launchpad XYZ \u2013 All-in-One Gateway to the Web 3.0 Investment Industry\n\nLaunchpad XYZ (LPX) is one of the best altcoin platforms to buy for exposure to the Web3 investment space. Aimed at casual investors with limited Web3 experience, Launchpad XYZ supports a wealth of features. This includes a decentralized exchange (DEX) that supports cryptocurrencies, NFTs, and fractionalized assets.\n\nThe latter refers to large stores of value that are tokenized into smaller units, such as real estate. Launchpad XYZ will also provide access to pre-released play-to-earn (P2E) games. This gives Launchpad XYZ users an edge, as they can evaluate the potential of the P2E gaming token before it launches to the public.\n\nAnother feature is access to private round presales. These are exclusive presale campaigns only available to whitelisted investors.\n\nLaunchpad XYZ will secure an allocation of tokens and offer them to its users. We also found that Launchpad XYZ provides unparalleled insights and data for crypto investors. This includes a risk-reward scoring system across hundreds of tokens, enabling investors to make smart decisions.\n\nThe Launchpad XYZ ecosystem is backed by its native LPX tokensm which are currently in presale \u2013 LPX provides access to premium features and those staking LPX can access private presales, pre-release P2E games, and discounted trading fees.\n\nThose staking LPX can also access private NFT launches and fractionalized assets. Almost $500,000 worth of LPX tokens have already been sold in the presale.\n\nCurrently, investors can buy Launchpad XYZ tokens at $0.0445. After the presale, LPX will be listed on the Launchpad XYZ DEX at $0.0565, an increase of 26% from the current presale price.\n\n8. AiDoge \u2013 Merging The Power of AI To Help Create Engaging Memes\n\nAiDoge is a presale project, meaning that investors can buy $AI tokens before it lists on a crypto exchange, which is beneficial for investors, considering that the AiDoge presale offers discounted prices. However, as a new altcoin project, investors will need to consider the added risk.\n\nIn a nutshell, AiDoge is developing a tool that can create memes from text prompts \u2013 the tool is proprietary to the project and is backed by blockchain technology and artificial intelligence. In order to create memes, users need to buy credits. AiDoge only accepts $AI tokens as a payment method, meaning its altcoin has actual utility.\n\nOnce credits have been obtained, users can type in the meme that they want to create. AiDoge will then create a unique meme with an image, which is owned 100% by the user, with ownership secured on the blockchain, as AiDoge memes are backed by NFTs. What\u2019s more, users can share their memes at the click of a button.\n\nShould a meme go viral on social media, the owner might consider selling it via an NFT marketplace. Another way to earn on AiDoge is by staking AI tokens. This yields free credits, enabling users to create more memes.\n\nAiDoge is also building a public wall that showcases the most popular memes, based on a voting structure via the blockchain, with users able to upvote and downvote the memes and the most popular creations earning $AI tokens as a reward.\n\nWe should note that the AiDoge team has decided to remain anonymous. While this might concern some investors, do remember that some of the most successful cryptocurrencies have anonymous founders. This includes Bitcoin and Shiba Inu. Moreover, AiDoge is a brand-new project that is yet to establish itself. As such, nobody can predict whether the project will succeed.\n\nNonetheless, this also means that AI tokens will have a small market capitalization once listed on a crypto exchange. This offers an attractive upside potential for high-risk, high-return investors. In the meantime, investors can buy AI tokens at a discount via the presale.\n\nHaving already raised over $9 million in just three weeks, the AiDoge presale is already trending in the crypto community and is rated as our best crypto ICO.\n\nCurrently, AI tokens are available to buy at $0.0000304. But this price increases incrementally as each batch of AI tokens is sold. This enables early investors to secure an upside before the tokens are listed on exchanges.\n\n9. Scorpion Casino \u2013 Merging Blockchain with Online Gaming, Raised over $450K\n\nScorpion Casino combines online gaming, sports betting, and casino fun on a blockchain-backed platform.\n\nUsers can play 360+ games, enjoy live sports events, and benefit from in-built fair-play measures, ensuring a trustworthy gaming environment.\n\nThe SCORP token, currently available in presale for $0.014 USDT, is central to this platform, which aims to provide passive income and boost engagement. With the listing price set at $0.05 USDT, early buyers can capitalize on the upside potential.\n\nSo far, the presale has gathered over $450K, showing substantial market interest in the platform.\n\nThe Scorpion Casino ecosystem includes three main elements: the gaming platform, an affiliate rewards system, and the $SCORP token.\n\nScorpion Casino is licensed by Curacao EGaming-licensed and offers many games & betting options. The affiliate system promotes user involvement through rewards, while the SCORP token ensures governance and additional benefits for users.\n\nWith a total supply of 1 billion, the SCORP token is the primary payment method on the platform. Token owners can anticipate regular bonuses, free games, and a share of transaction taxes, boosting their holdings as platform usage grows.\n\nFor fairness and more engagement, a significant portion of tokens is set aside for presale and affiliate rewards.\n\nScorpion Casino plans to develop partnerships, host live affiliate events, and launch marketing campaigns on its roadmap.\n\nThe end-year focus is scaling the platform for substantial growth, reinforcing its mission to revolutionize online gaming and sports betting with a fair, rewarding, and engaging user experience.\n\nYou can enter the Scorpion Casino Telegram Channel to get the latest updates.\n\nVisit Scorpion Casino\n\n10. eTukTuk \u2013 Green Crypto Project Offering Affordable EVs That Can Boost Driver Earnings by 4x\n\nLaunching as a unique green crypto, eTukTuk, seeks to revolutionize transportation, targeting lower carbon emissions and financial exclusion. The project focuses on shifting traditional TukTuks to a sustainable model using electric power.\n\nThis innovative approach combines economic advantages with environmental preservation to lessen carbon emissions and provide an affordable solution to TukTuk drivers in Sri Lanka.\n\nIt is preparing to launch its native token, $TUK, currently in the whitelisting phase of its presale.\n\nBacked by The Capital Maharaja Group, a significant Sri Lankan conglomerate, eTukTuk aims to make EVs (Electric Vehicles) and charging stations accessible and affordable to everyday TukTuk operators.\n\nAs per the eTukTuk whitepaper, the project plans to establish Electric vehicle supply equipment across Sri Lanka and similar developing countries. This approach aims to decrease dependence on non-renewable energy.\n\nTo increase drivers\u2019 earnings by up to 400%, eTukTuk focuses on safe, cost-effective EVs that require less maintenance.\n\neTukTuk uses digital identities to tackle financial inequality, making financial services more accessible. Its \u2018Territory Partners\u2019 idea lets network participants share in its growth and earn rewards.\n\nAdditionally, holding $TUK tokens allows users to participate in power staking. By staking these tokens, users support the nodes that maintain the EVs and could achieve a high annual return (APY).\n\nEmphasizing the role of blockchain in driving substantial change, eTukTuk seeks to set a standard for the green transport revolution in developing economies.\n\nTo stay updated with the platform\u2019s progress, users can join the eTukTuk Telegram group.\n\nVisit eTukTuk\n\n11. DeeLance \u2013 Smart Contract-Based Ecosystem for Freelancers\n\nWhen exploring what altcoin to buy, DeeLance (DLANCE) is also worth considering. This is one of the best new altcoins that is revolutionizing the global freelancing market. According to some estimates, this market could be worth over $1.3 trillion by 2025. But currently, the freelancing space faces several issues surrounding fees, payments, and transparency.\n\nFor example, both clients and freelancers are charged high fees on platforms like Upwork and Fiverr. DeeLance is considerably more cost-effective, with clients paying just 2% and freelancers charged 10%.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, DeeLance solves the issue of slow and costly payments \u2013 this ensures that payments are released as soon as the freelancer completes the work and, as an ERC-20 token, DLANCE payments take just seconds.\n\nMoreover, freelancers are protected by the DeeLance escrow system. This is because clients pay for the work upfront, with the DLANCE tokens locked in a transparent smart contract.\n\nDeeLance is also building a metaverse that connects freelancers with recruiters. The DeeLance metaverse will support land ownership, enabling users to build and work in virtual offices.\n\nThat said, investors should remember that DeeLance is a brand-new project that will compete with established freelancing platforms.\n\nWhile its blockchain-based ecosystem offers many benefits to both freelancers and recruiters, there is no guarantee it will become a major player in this space.\n\nNonetheless, DeeLance is currently selling DLANCE tokens via a presale. The current price is just $0.038 per DLANCE. This will increase by 50% to $0.057 when DLANCE is listed on an exchange, making it one of the best cryptos to buy now.\n\n12. Ethereum \u2013 Largest Altcoin by Market Capitalization Serving Thousands of ERC-20 Tokens\n\nEthereum (ETH) is the biggest altcoin on the market by market cap. Launched in 2015, Ethereum enables developers to create and execute smart contract agreements. In turn, this allows decentralized ecosystems to operate autonomously. Ethereum\u2019s smart contract framework is now used by thousands of other altcoins, known as ERC-20 tokens.\n\nSome of the largest decentralized exchanges are built on Ethereum, making it one of the top altcoin platforms for other projects. This includes Uniswap, SushiSwap, and Yearn.finance \u2013 one of the most expensive altcoins in the market.\n\nCrucially, ERC-20 token ecosystems pay GAS fees in ETH. This means that the demand for ETH increases as more projects are built on its network.\n\nAlthough ETH currently has a market capitalization of over $200 billion, there is still plenty of upside available and many projects continue to see ETH as the go-to destination to build decentralized apps (dApps). Sshould ETH return to its former all-time high of almost $5,000, this would yield an upside of over 170% from current prices.\n\nCryptoassets are a highly volatile unregulated investment product.\n\n13. Ripple (XRP) \u2013 Fast, Cheap, and Scalable Cross-Border Transactions for Banks and Financial Institutions\n\nRipple (XRP) was launched in 2012, making it one of the oldest and most popular altcoins in the market. The project has built a blockchain-based network that supports cross-border transactions. Its innovative technology is already being used or trialed by hundreds of banks and financial institutions. This is because Ripple transactions are a lot more efficient when compared to legacy networks.\n\nFor example, suppose a manufacturer in Kenya wants to transfer funds to a supplier in Brazil. This cross-currency transaction would not only take several days to process but will attract unfavorable fees. This is especially the case considering that correspondent banks would be required to execute the transaction.\n\nIn contrast, the same transaction on the Ripple network would take under five seconds at a cost of just 0.00001 XRP. Based on current XRP prices, this amounts to just $0.0000045. XRP enables investors to gain exposure to Ripple\u2019s cross-border network.\n\nCurrently, XRP is trading at under $0.50. Should it return to its former high of $3.84, that\u2019s an upside of over 660%. Much of its future potential is also reliant on an ongoing court case against the SEC, with a win expected to send the price skyrocketing.\n\nCryptoassets are a highly volatile unregulated investment product.\n\n14. Arbitrum \u2013 Layer 2 Solution for More Scalable and Cost-Effective ERC-20 Token Transactions\n\nArbitrum (ARB) is one of the best altcoins to buy for long-term potential. This is a layer 2 solution for the Ethereum ecosystem. Put simply, ERC-20 tokens can bridge to Arbitrum to benefit from more efficient transactions. This is especially the case in terms of scalability. Currently, Ethereum can process 29-30 transactions per second.\n\nIn comparison, Arbitrum can handle up to 40,000 per transaction. Arbitrum is also significantly more cost-effective than Ethereum. For example, ERC-20 GAS fees currently average $4.64. But this often surpasses $10 when the network is busy. Arbitrum transactions currently average just $0.0077.\n\nThe efficiencies of Arbitrum will appeal to ERC-20 projects requiring a high transaction output. This includes decentralized finance platforms and exchanges, as well as NFT marketplaces. Over 220 ERC-20 tokens have already bridged to Arbitrum. To gain exposure to this project, investors can buy ARB tokens.\n\nCryptoassets are a highly volatile unregulated investment product.\n\n15. Dogecoin \u2013 Popular Altcoin Coin Currently Trading at a Huge Discount\n\nDogecoin (DOGE) is one of the best meme coins in the market, with a current valuation of over $10 billion. It has several million token holders, making Dogecoin one of the most popular cryptocurrencies globally. It is also one of the most established altcoins, with Dogecoin first entering the market in 2013.\n\nDogecoin claims to be the ideal cryptocurrency for global payments. Its network processes transactions faster and cheaper than Bitcoin. Dogecoin is also more scalable. That said, Dogecoin is still considered a speculative meme coin with limited utility. Moreover, there are more efficient alternatives to Dogecoin, including Solana, Cardano, and Arbitrum.\n\nNonetheless, Dogecoin is one of the best altcoins to watch in the current bear market. Those investing in Dogecoin today will pay just $0.07. At its peak in 2021, Dogecoin was trading at $0.74. While there are no guarantees that Dogecoin will regain its former all-time high, current prices offer a discounted entry price of 90%.\n\nWondering where to buy altcoins like Dogecoin? Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide on how to buy Dogecoin on eToro from just $10.\n\nCryptoassets are a highly volatile unregulated investment product.\n\n16. Uniswap \u2013 Decentralized Exchange Supporting Trading, Lending, and Borrowing\n\nUniswap is one of the best altcoins to invest in for exposure to decentralized trading. Launched in 2020, Uniswap enables traders to swap cryptocurrencies without a third party. It uses an automated market maker (AMM) protocol for this purpose. In simple terms, the AMM uses liquidity pools containing two different tokens.\n\nFor example, an ETH/USDT pool would enable users to swap these tokens instantly without requiring a seller. Uniswap pools are funded by investors looking to earn passive income. Investors receive a share of the trading fees collected by the pool. What\u2019s more, investors can withdraw their tokens from a Uniswap pool at any time.\n\nUniswap also has its own altcoin, UNI. This is a governance token that also trades on crypto exchanges. As such, those buying UNI tokens can gain exposure to the project. Uniswap currently has a market capitalization of $3 billion, pricing UNI tokens at just $5. During the prior bull market, UNI tokens were valued at over $40.\n\nCryptoassets are a highly volatile unregulated investment product.\n\nWhat are Altcoins?\n\nAlternative coins, or simply \u2018altcoins\u2019, refers to all cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin. This means that there are over 24,000 altcoins to choose from. Currently, the cryptocurrency industry has a market capitalization of over $1 trillion. Of this figure, approximately 54% is attributed to altcoins.\n\nIn many cases, investors buy altcoins to diversify away from Bitcoin. Moreover, many altcoins have a small market capitalization. This presents an opportunity to target a higher upside. New altcoins enter the market daily, most offering early investors a discounted price via a presale campaign.\n\nThis includes the likes of Bitcoin ETF Token, Wall Street Memes, Thug Life, and yPredict. Presales are particularly attractive for growth investors, as these projects enter the market with a small valuation. Over time, it is hoped that the value of the altcoin will appreciate. Ethereum is a great example of this. Ethereum\u2019s presale priced ETH at just $0.31. ETH has since hit highs of almost $5,000.\n\nThat said, it is important to remember that Bitcoin sentiment dominates the altcoin market. This means that when Bitcoin is bullish, the altcoin market follows suit. And vice-versa when Bitcoin is bearish. However, this isn\u2019t a blanket rule. Instead, many altcoins perform well even when the broader markets are down.\n\nIs Investing in Altcoins Worth It?\n\nMany altcoins have produced unprecedented returns since they entered the market. Ethereum, for example, has increased in value by over 1 million percent since its 2014 presale. That said, there are also many examples of altcoins that have lost significant value. As such, investors should consider the risk of financial loss before investing in altcoins.\n\nNow let\u2019s take a deeper dive into the investment thesis of altcoins.\n\nDiversification\n\nMany investors buy altcoins as part of a diversification strategy. This means that the investor will add many different altcoins to their portfolio. Considering there are thousands of options in the market, this makes altcoins ideal for this purpose.\n\nA well-diversified portfolio will contain altcoins from various niches\n\nTo ensure a balanced and risk-averse approach, investors will often allocate funds to more established altcoins too.\n\nThis might include large-cap altcoins like Ethereum, XRP, and Dogecoin.\n\nCreating a diversified altcoin portfolio ensures that investors are not overexposed to a single cryptocurrency.\n\nHigher Returns\n\nWhile Bitcoin is the largest and de-facto cryptocurrency, altcoins offer the chance to make higher returns. This is because altcoins have a smaller market capitalization than Bitcoin, offering greater upside potential.\n\nFor example, Arbitrum currently has a market capitalization of $1.5 billion.\n\nThis amounts to under 1% of Bitcoin\u2019s valuation.\n\nAs such, those buying ARB tokens can target a much higher upside in the coming years.\n\nSome of the best new altcoins and upcoming altcoins discussed today have a significantly smaller market capitalization.\n\nThis is because small-cap cryptocurrencies have a low market depth due to reduced liquidity. Meaning, that low-cap altcoins can increase a lot faster than those with a large valuation.\n\nNew Concepts From the Ground Up\n\nSome of the best altcoins for 2023 are developing innovative concepts that offer real-world solutions to existing problems.\n\nFor example, Arbitrum has developed a layer 2 solution for the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nMore than 220 ERC-20 tokens have bridged to Arbitrum, meaning faster, cheaper, and more scalable transactions.\n\nThose buying ARB tokens will gain exposure to the growth of Arbitrum.\n\nSimilarly:\n\nEcoterra has developed a recycle-to-earn concept.\n\nAs the name implies, this rewards people that recycle their consumed or unwanted goods.\n\nRewards are paid in ECOTERRA tokens, which have plenty of use cases.\n\nFor instance, ECOTERRA can be used to buy tokenized carbon credits, eco-friendly products, or recycled raw materials.\n\nThe key point here is that altcoins offer exposure to new concepts from the ground up. This is especially the case when investing in altcoin presales, as the tokens will have yet to be listed on exchanges.\n\nBear Market Discounts\n\nDuring bear markets, most cryptocurrencies lose value. However, when compared to Bitcoin, altcoins generally decline by a greater amount. Some altcoin investors view this as a benefit. This is because investors can top up altcoins for 2023 at a huge discount.\n\nFor example, we mentioned that Dogecoin is trading 90% below its bear market peak. Similarly, Uniswap is trading at an 88% discount from its former highs. Discounts of this nature offer an attractive entry point. The hope is that the purchased altcoins will return to their prior all-time highs during the next bull run.\n\nInvestors should remember that there are no guarantees that this will be the case. Moreover, there is no certainty that the cryptocurrency markets will ever return to their former highs.\n\nHow Many Altcoins Are There?\n\nAccording to CoinMarketCap, there are over 24,000 altcoins to watch in the market today. Once again, this covers every cryptocurrency apart from Bitcoin. The altcoin market has grown considerably in recent years. Not only in terms of the number of altcoins but the broader market value.\n\nFor example, in 2013, the total altcoin market was worth just $91 million. At its peak in 2021, the altcoin market was valued at over $1.2 trillion. Due to bear market conditions, the altcoin market is currently worth $600 billion. Nonetheless, when compared to 2013 levels, this represents growth of over 6,000x.\n\nHow to Find the Best Altcoins to Invest in?\n\nWith over 24,000 tokens to choose from, finding the next big altcoin can be difficult. Here are some tips on how to find the best altcoins with the most potential:\n\nQuality Presales\n\nA good starting point is to look for new altcoin presales. Upconing altcoins enable investors to buy new crypto tokens at a discount before they are listed on crypto exchanges.\n\nAs noted earlier, the Ethereum price priced ETH tokens at just $0.31. At its peak in 2021, ETH was trading at almost $5,000.\n\nLarge-Cap Altcoins at a Discount\n\nAnother way to find the best altcoin investments is to focus on large-cap projects trading at a bear market discount. Large-cap altcoins come with reduced risks when compared to presales.\n\nThis is because large-cap altcoins are usually well-established. Currently, the most popular altcoins, including Dogecoin, Uniswap, XRP, and Arbitrum, are trading at huge bear market discounts.\n\nLook for Trending Altcoins\n\nSome of the best altcoins to buy are those that are trending online \u2013 this is because trending coins often create FOMO (Fear of Missing Out).\n\nThis is an emotional investment strategy, meaning people buy an altcoin because they don\u2019t want to miss out on a potential windfall. A good example of this is Dogecoin.\n\nWhen Elon Musk began tweeting about Dogecoin in early 2021, this created a sudden wave of buying pressure. So much so that Dogecoin generated returns of over 14,000% in the first five months of 2021.\n\nOne of the best ways to find trending altcoins is on social media. In addition to Twitter, Reddit is also a good source. There are many altcoin-related forums on Reddit that offer insight into the most trending cryptocurrencies to watch.\n\nCoinMarketCap\n\nAnother way to find the best altcoins to invest in is via CoinMarketCap. This platform is the gold standard for crypto data aggregation, enabling investors to source altcoin investment ideas.\n\nFor example, CoinMarketCap has a dedicated page for trending cryptocurrencies. This is updated in real-time and is based on various metrics. This includes the number of people searching for a specific altcoin and recent trading volumes.\n\nCoinMarketCap also enables users to sort altcoins by their recent pricing performance. This enables users to view the best-performing altcoins over the prior hour, day, or week.\n\nBest Place to Buy Altcoins to Invest in 2024\n\nInvestors are able to buy the top altcoins in a variety of ways, often depending on which stage of their development they are in.\n\nFor example, many of the best upcoming altcoins listed above are in their crypto ICO or presale stage, meaning they cannot be purchased on crypto exchanges or with brokers and instead need to be bought directly on the project\u2019s website.\n\nEventually, they will be listed on a variety of the best altcoin exchanges, just like the most popular altcoins in our list already are.\n\nWe rate eToro as the best altcoin trading platform, as it is a popular and highly-trusted broker that is heavily regulated in a variety of nations, including with with FINRA (US), ASIC (Australia), FCA (UK), and CySEC (Cyprus), with 30 million global customers.\n\nThe altcoin platform supports Bitcoin and a number of other top altcoins \u2013 more than 90 in total including ETH, BNB, XRP and ADA \u2013 as well as other financial instruments such as stocks and ETFs, with low and transparent fees.\n\nIt also has a smooth user experience and has features such as copy trading, although seasoned traders may prefer other platforms as it only offers limited trading tools. Some products, such as forex, commodities and indices, are not available in the US as they are traded as contracts-for-differences.\n\nVisit eToro\n\nCrypto assets are a highly volatile unregulated investment product. No UK or EU investor protection.\n\nHow to Buy Altcoins\n\nBelow we outline how to buy the most popular altcoins and the best new altcoin projects while on presale:\n\nHow to Buy Altcoins with eToro \u2013 Quick Guide\n\nFollow these quick steps to purchase ETH, XRP or other popular altcoins in the market with eToro:"

        "title": "Ethereum transaction fee climbs above 219% - Cryptopolitan",
        "content": "Over the recent three weeks, the realm of cryptocurrency transactions has witnessed a significant metamorphosis, particularly in the domains of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). Transaction costs for both these leading cryptocurrencies have experienced a noticeable surge, introducing a dynamic landscape for users partaking in digital asset transfers.\n\nEthereum transaction fees rise to $6.64\n\nBitcoin, as the pioneer in the cryptocurrency space, has encountered a sharp escalation in transaction costs, reaching a pinnacle of $15 per transfer just three days ago. This escalating trend in fees is not confined to Bitcoin alone; Ethereum has concurrently undergone a parallel trajectory. In the period spanning from October 22 to November 12, 2023, the average fee for Ethereum transactions soared by a striking 219%, elevating from $2.08 to $6.64 per transaction.\n\nThe synchronization in the movement of Ethereum\u2019s fees with Bitcoin\u2019s transaction costs can be attributed to the shared factor of gas expenses. The expenditure related to the gas required for executing transactions on both blockchains has seen an upswing during this timeframe. Currently, the average fee for an Ethereum transaction stands at $6.64, accompanied by a median fee of 0.0013 ETH, equivalent to $2.70 per transaction.\n\nInterestingly, the alignment between Ethereum and Bitcoin becomes more apparent when comparing the average and median charges for transactions on both networks. However, a notable distinction emerges when engaging in specific operations on the Ethereum blockchain, such as interacting with a smart contract. Executing operations like exchanging an ETH-based asset on a decentralized exchange (dex) platform incurs a distinct fee ranging from $27.77 to $28.50 per transaction.\n\nComplexities in ETH operations and transaction costs\n\nSimilarly, the cost associated with conducting a non-fungible token (NFT) transaction experiences fluctuations between $46.93 and $48.16. On November 12, the cost of transferring assets across different chains via bridging was estimated to be in the range of $8.93 to $9.17. This process accentuates the additional complexities and costs involved when moving assets across various blockchain networks. From October 22, 2023, to November 11, 2023, Ethereum has been processing an average of approximately 1,071,448 transactions daily.\n\nThis substantial transaction volume underscores the robust activity within the Ethereum network, despite the accompanying rise in transaction costs. In the broader comparison of Ethereum and Bitcoin, often referred to as the \u2018Flippening Watch,\u2019 Bitcoin maintains its lead over Ethereum in market capitalization, daily trading volume, and the fees collected by validators in the 24 hours compared to what BTC miners earn. Regardless of the chosen perspective, transactions on these two blockchains, which dominate in terms of market capitalization, come at a significantly higher cost compared to their other layer one (L1) counterparts.\n\nAs users navigate this evolving landscape of cryptocurrency transactions, the intricate interplay between fees, transaction volumes, and the distinctive characteristics of different blockchain operations becomes increasingly relevant. The surge in fees, while reflective of heightened activity and demand, prompts users to consider the cost-effectiveness of their chosen blockchain for specific operations and transactions in this ever-evolving digital financial ecosystem."

        "title": "Raoul Pal Predicts Ethereum's Superior Performance Over Bitcoin in Crypto Market - CryptoGlobe",
        "content": "Raoul Pal is a well-known figure in the finance and investment world, particularly recognized for his expertise in macroeconomic trends. He is the co-founder and CEO of Real Vision, a financial media company offering in-depth video interviews and research publications with some of the world\u2019s best investors and economists.\n\nBefore establishing Real Vision, Pal had a successful career in the hedge fund industry. He retired from managing money at the age of 36 after a successful stint at Goldman Sachs where he co-managed the hedge fund sales business in Equities and Equity Derivatives in Europe. He also ran a successful global macro hedge fund.\n\nPal is known for his global macroeconomic perspectives, which he shares through various media channels, including Real Vision and social media platforms. His insights cover a broad range of topics, including global financial markets, commodities, cryptocurrencies, and economic trends. He is particularly noted for his analysis of the cryptocurrency market and has been a vocal proponent of digital assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nOn November 9, addressing his one million followers on the social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter), Pal referenced the Tom Demark Sequential indicator to support his view that Ethereum is gearing up to surpass Bitcoin.\n\nThe Tom DeMark Sequential is a technical analysis indicator developed by Tom DeMark to identify potential price exhaustion and reversal points in financial markets. This tool is particularly popular among traders and analysts in various markets, including forex, stocks, and cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe Sequential consists of two main components: the Setup and the Countdown. Here\u2019s a brief overview of how it works:\n\nSetup: The Setup is the first phase and consists of nine consecutive candles. For a buy signal, each candle\u2019s close must be lower than the close four candles earlier. Conversely, for a sell signal, each candle\u2019s close must be higher than the close four candles earlier. Completing a Setup is the first indication of a potential trend reversal. Countdown: After the Setup is completed, the Countdown begins. This phase consists of 13 candles. For a buy Countdown, the low of each candle must be lower than the low two candles earlier. For a sell Countdown, the high of each candle must be higher than the high two candles earlier. The Countdown doesn\u2019t need to be consecutive candles.\n\nThe Sequential indicator is often used to identify exhaustion points in a trend, suggesting that the current trend might be nearing its end and a reversal could be imminent. However, like all technical analysis tools, it\u2019s not foolproof and is best used in conjunction with other indicators and methods to confirm signals.\n\nTom DeMark\u2019s Sequential has gained a reputation for its effectiveness, especially in markets that exhibit strong trends, and is a favored tool among many professional traders for its ability to provide clear, actionable signals based on price action.\n\nPal highlighted a specific pattern, the weekly DeMark 9 count for the ETH/BTC cross, suggesting that Ethereum is likely to outperform Bitcoin in the current market phase.\n\nThat is the weekly DeMark 9 count for the ETH/BTC cross. ETH most likely outperforms from here as per usual at this stage in late Crypto Spring. pic.twitter.com/yBCrLRzFXn \u2014 Raoul Pal (@RaoulGMI) November 9, 2023\n\nFurthermore, Pal discussed the significance of Ethereum-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which he considers the \u201choly grail\u201d for asset managers. He explained that these ETFs allow managers to capture yield while providing only price performance to holders, making it a highly profitable venture until competitive alternatives emerge.\n\nAn ETH ETF is the holy grail for asset managers as they can capture the yield and only give price performance to the ETF holders. It is a super profitable business until it gets competed away eventually. \u2014 Raoul Pal (@RaoulGMI) November 9, 2023\n\nFeatured Image via Pixabay"

        "content": "The cryptocurrency market is exciting as it concludes an upbeat week, with Bitcoin and Ethereum showing substantial gains on their weekly charts. However, the real stars of the week were the altcoins, which made remarkable strides, hinting at potential further growth in the near future.\n\nIn the top 50 cryptocurrencies list, several altcoins made impressive gains, and the standout performer was THORChain (RUNE). Solana (SOL) and Avalanche (AVAX) followed closely behind, securing the second and third positions, respectively, with impressive growth.\n\nSource: CoinMarketcap\n\nTHORChain (RUNE) made a significant mark with a remarkable 53% surge over the past week, reaching a peak of $5.83. As of the latest data, it is trading at $5.22, demonstrating robust performance despite experiencing a slight 1.80% increase in the last 24 hours.\n\nSource: CoinMarketcap\n\nSolana (SOL) also made waves with a 44% gain during the past week. SOL is currently trading at $58.4, with a marginal 0.86% decrease in price and a 47.49% decrease in trading volume in the last 24 hours.\n\nSource: CoinMarketcap\n\nAvalanche (AVAX) garnered significant attention, with a weekly increase of more than 39%.

The recent surge has positioned Bitcoin for its most robust four-week performance since January, marking an impressive 42% increase from just under $17,000 to nearly $24,000.\n\nSource: CoinMarketcap\n\nThere is widespread speculation that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is preparing to approve a series of spot Bitcoin ETFs, potentially as early as January, and updates on this matter are expected to impact the market significantly in the coming days.\n\nAccording to Santiment, Bitcoin, now up by +37% in the past two months, has seen an increase in the ratio of traders opening bullish positions compared to bearish ones, reaching three-month highs. Moreover, the total open interest on exchanges has surged to $7.2 billion. It is hoped that Bitcoin will continue to rise after the FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) settles.\n\n\ud83e\udd11 #Bitcoin, now up +37% in 2 months, has seen its ratio of traders opening #bullish positions (vs. #bearish) hitting 3-month highs. Also, the total open interest on exchanges has ballooned to $7.2B. Ideally, $BTC will continue rising after #FOMO settles. https://t.co/YImIUMGRyl pic.twitter.com/4TyZe5YfFz \u2014 Santiment (@santimentfeed) November 8, 2023\n\nIntoTheBlock shared a similar sentiment, noting that funding rates for BTC and ETH perpetual swaps have hit a yearly high, signaling potentially overheated markets. While not a direct predictor of decreasing prices, sustained high rates indicate a need for caution.\n\nFurthermore, Santiment highlighted that Ethereum has reached as high as $2,132, as optimism surrounding the second-largest cryptocurrency surged with BlackRock\u2019s new ETF submission for the SEC\u2019s review. The latest insights examine Ethereum\u2019s on-chain health and its chances of continuing its growth.\n\n\ud83d\udcca #Ethereum has reached as high as $2,132 as optimism surrounding the #2 asset in #crypto surged with #Blackrock's new submitted #ETF for the #SEC's review. Our latest insight looks at $ETH's #onchain health and its chances to continue its growth. \ud83d\udc47 https://t.co/8sBC9d1lWT pic.twitter.com/2PruVIM4Ve \u2014 Santiment (@santimentfeed) November 11, 2023\n\nSantiment also pointed out that Ethereum\u2019s market value has surged by +38% in the past four weeks, driven by high network growth. Micro addresses holding less than 0.1 ETH have recently surpassed 100,000 wallets for the first time, and even the 0.1-10 ETH and 10,000+ ETH tiers are finally on the rise.\n\nSource: CoinMarketcap\n\nAs of the latest data from CoinMarketCap, Bitcoin is currently trading at $37,007.49, showing a 6% increase over the past seven days and a 0.36% decrease in the past 24 hours.
