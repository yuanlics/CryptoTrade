        "content": "Elena is an expert in technical analysis and risk management in cryptocurrency market. She has 10+year experience in writing - accordingly she is avid journalists with a passion towards researching new insights coming into crypto erena.\n\nStory Highlights Ethereum is reaching new highs with a 2.9% surge.\n\nAnalysts forecast a potential climb to $3,500 in the first quarter of 2024.\n\nEthereum outpaced Bitcoin in price growth in November, surging by 13%.\n\nThe world of cryptocurrency is as exciting as ever and this time it\u2019s Ethereum that is taking the stage.\n\nEthereum isn\u2019t just holding its own; it\u2019s reaching new highs. Currently at $2,099 with a 2.9% surge, Ethereum has enthusiasts and investors buzzing about the potential climb to $3,500. What\u2019s driving this upward trend? Let\u2019s explore the intriguing developments shaping Ethereum\u2019s journey.\n\nETH Price\n\nRenowned crypto analyst Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe has shared an optimistic outlook for Ethereum, especially in light of recent developments such as Fidelity\u2019s filing. Van de Poppe forecasts a potential climb to $3,500 in the first quarter of 2024, aligning this projection with the upward trajectory witnessed in Bitcoin.\n\n#Ethereum Spot ETF filing by Fidelity!\n\n\n\nConfirms my thesis that after #Bitcoin gets its shine, we\u2019ll see Ethereum running to $3,500 in Q1 2024. \u2014 Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) November 30, 2023\n\nRead More: Whales Activated: A Massive Breakout in the Ethereum (ETH) Price is on the Horizon\n\nWhales in Action\n\nA recent surge in Ethereum whale accumulation has caught market attention. On-chain data shows a shift: major exchange wallet holdings dropped to 8.03 million ETH, while non-exchange wallets surged to a record 41.03 million ETH, as reported by Coinpedia News. This shift suggests a growing preference for self-custody among investors, with significant Ethereum amounts moving away from centralized exchanges.\n\nNovember\u2019s Win\n\nIn a surprise move, Ethereum outpaced Bitcoin in price growth in November, surging by 13% compared to Bitcoin\u2019s 8%. A key catalyst was BlackRock\u2019s official filing of a spot ETH ETF. Despite less buzz around ETFs, on-chain data suggests Ethereum\u2019s price volatility now exceeds Bitcoin\u2019s, possibly drawing short-term traders to invest more in ETH than BTC in December.\n\nEthereum Takes the Lead\n\nAccording to IntoTheBlock\u2019s recent report, Ethereum\u2019s 30-day Average Intra-Day Volatility score stands at an impressive 0.45%, beating Bitcoin\u2019s 0.32%. This shift in volatility dynamics could reshape investment strategies, drawing more attention to the dynamic opportunities within the Ethereum market.\n\nDespite facing hurdles in November, Ethereum\u2019s price showed a positive pattern known as a Double Bottom on the chart. As we navigate the unpredictable crypto market, the burning question remains: Can Ethereum reach $3,000 by the end of 2023?\n\nAlso Read: Is the SEC Playing Favorites with Bitcoin and Ethereum?\n\nThe excitement continues as Ethereum\u2019s journey unfolds, and the crypto community eagerly awaits the next chapter in its compelling story."

        "content": "The Ethereum network\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions have dropped by an estimated 99.97% since its shift to proof-of-stake, despite a big rise in node count.\n\nThat\u2019s according to new research by the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance. The organization has upped its crypto research effort after in April launching the Cambridge Blockchain Network Sustainability Index (CBNSI) \u2014 a measure that detailed Ethereum\u2019s electricity consumption pre- and post-Merge.\n\nThe Ethereum network currently is responsible for 2.8 kilotonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (KtCO 2 e) on an annualized basis, the CCAF said in a Friday report.\n\n\u201cTo contextualize, this would equate to the emissions from five round-trip airplane flights from London to New York, the annual energy consumption-related emissions of 450 UK households, or the annual carbon sequestration capacity of 270 acres of forest,\u201d the report states.\n\nEthereum switched to a proof-of-stake consensus model in September 2022. The Ethereum Foundation had estimated the Merge would reduce the blockchain\u2019s power consumption by 99.95%.\n\nRead more: Ethereum switches to proof-of-stake after 7 years of work\n\nBut electricity usage is only one piece of an environmental impact assessment, according to the Friday report.\n\nAdditional data was required to convert electricity consumption to greenhouse gas emissions. The CCAF used off-chain data from the peer-to-peer communication of Ethereum nodes to gather both electricity usage and the geolocational distribution of nodes.\n\nThe number of Ethereum validators has grown 57% since April 1, reaching 880,822. Ethereum nodes have grown to 14,072, reflecting a 23.2% increase over that span.\n\nThe network\u2019s annual electricity consumption increased by 21.2% in those eight months, from 6.19 GWh to 7.50 GWh \u2014 roughly the annual electricity use of 2,000 English households, the Cambridge data shows.\n\nAs for where the nodes are, Europe and North America are home to 43.3% and 40.5% of them, respectively, following the Merge.\n\nSource: Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance (CCAF)\n\nThe CCAF estimates pre-Merge greenhouse gas emissions were about 10.3 MCO 2 e. The latest post-Merge figure of 2.8 KtCO 2 e reflects a 99.97% drop despite a substantial increase in the number of Ethereum nodes, the report notes.\n\nThe network is now powered by nearly 48% sustainable energy \u2014 including 32% renewables and 16% nuclear \u2014 the CCAF estimates, with the remaining 52% coming from natural gas, coal-fired power, and oil.\n\nThe CCAF said it next looks to enhance its Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index (CBECI). Despite Ethereum\u2019s shift to proof-of-stake, bitcoin\u2019s proof-of-work consensus model is a cornerstone of its identity, the report acknowledges \u2014 making a similar transition \u201cnot as straightforward as it might appear at first glance.\u201d\n\nThe research institute adds: \u201cThe narrative of Ethereum and Bitcoin\u2019s different paths is not just a tale of technological advancements but also reflects different ideologies and priorities of their communities, highlighting the multifaceted complexity inherent in the evolution of leading blockchain networks.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "Ethereum price rallies toward key resistance but is ETH's strength sustainable? - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Ether (ETH) is trading higher on Dec. 1, despite its inability to breach the $2,100 resistance. This level has prompted several rejections in the past three weeks, which is especially concerning given Ether\u2019s 16.2% gains in November.\n\nEther 12-hour price index, USD. Source: TradingView\n\nHowever, the current positive momentum is supported by several factors, including applications for spot ETFs and the expansion of Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem, driven by layer-2 solutions.\n\nETH benefits from ETF expectations and negative news related to competing blockchains\n\nA pivotal development occurred on Nov. 30, with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) initiating the review process for Fidelity\u2019s spot Ether ETF proposal, filed on Nov. 17. This move, along with similar applications from firms like BlackRock, awaits regulatory green light. If approved, these ETFs would bolster Ether's status as a digital commodity, reducing the likelihood of it being treated as a security.\n\nDespite analysts predicting the SEC might delay its decision to early 2024, interim deadlines for applications by VanEck and ARK 21Shares on Dec. 25 and Dec. 26, respectively, have kept the market engaged. The mounting interest from large mutual funds in Ether products is creating a favorable impact on its price.\n\nThe Ethereum network's growth, especially in transaction activity and layer-2 development, is noteworthy. The Ethereum layer-2 ecosystem has become increasingly important as the average transaction fee held above $4 for the last couple of months. These layer-2 solutions offer more cost-effective and flexible options than the base layer.\n\nThis growth is reflected in Ethereum's total value locked (TVL), which recently hit a two-month high of 13 million ETH, spurred by a 13% weekly gain in Spark and a 60% increase in Blast user deposits.\n\nEthereum network top DApps by TVL. Source: DefiLlama\n\nIn contrast, Tron, another leading blockchain in TVL terms, witnessed a 12% decline over the past ten days. Recent high-profile hacks linked to Tron's founder Justin Sun have also swayed investor confidence toward Ethereum.\n\nTVL growth is based on Ethereum layer-2 innovations\n\nBlast, an Ethereum layer-2 project, has impressively accumulated $647 million in TVL, a testament to the vibrant development within this space. Despite facing criticism over centralization issues and smart contract flexibility, Blast's self-promoted features like auto-compounding and stablecoin yields are attracting significant attention. On the flip side, Blast has suffered criticism for centralization and the flexibility to upgrade its smart contracts.\n\nNotably, Blast is just one part of a larger ecosystem. Ethereum's leading scaling solutions, Arbitrum and Optimism, hold a combined TVL of $2.94 billion. In the context of TVL, it's insightful to compare Ethereum's robust layer-2 ecosystem with other blockchains. Although these solutions are still subject to significant base layer settlement fees, there's no denying the impressive growth and increased activity they've experienced over time.\n\nRelated: Why is the crypto market up today?\n\nTake Solana (SOL) as an example: its entire TVL, encompassing projects like Marinade Finance, Jito, marginfi, Solend, and Orca, is currently valued at $671 million. This stark contrast highlights the edge Ethereum's layer-2 solutions have over its competitors, such as Cardano (ADA), BSC Chain (BNB), and Avalanche (AVAX), blockchains primarily focused on native scaling solutions. However, Ethereum's approach, leveraging layer-2 technologies, seems to have gained more traction and user trust, as evidenced by its growing activity.\n\nIn essence, Ether's recent push towards the $2,100 resistance level is largely influenced by the anticipated approval of spot ETFs in the U.S. and the increased market share in decentralized applications.\n\nThe ongoing evolution and appeal of Ethereum's layer-2 solutions, which mitigate high transaction costs, are also playing a crucial role in attracting users and sustaining Ether's positive market trajectory.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

This move looked like a typical \u201cbuy the rumor, sell the news event.\u201d\n\nThis strategy happens when traders accumulate a token in anticipation of a major development, pushing the price up in return.\n\nHowever, when the development gets to the public domain, the participants involved sell the token for profits.\n\nThe EVM is the \u201cSenSEI\u201d\n\nOn the 29th of November, Sei Network announced via its blog that it would soon become the first parallelized Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) blockchain.\n\nThe EVM is the computational engine for Ethereum [ETH] that enables smart contract functionality.\n\nSei works using the Cosmos Software Development Kit (SDK) as an open-source framework to construct new blockchains within the Cosmos ecosystem. So, the EVM development does not mean that Sie is migrating.\n\nRather, it would be an additional function for the project when it is implemented.\n\nAccording to Sei, the EVM compatibility would enable users to interact with Solana [SOL] and the Ethereum network seamlessly.\n\nThe statement also mentioned that the Sei v2 might lead to an increase in the number of transactions per second. Regarding this, Sei noted that:\n\n\u201cFrom a performance perspective, Sei V2 will offer 28,300 batched transactions per second of throughput, while offering 390 ms block times and 390 ms finality. This allows Sei to support many more users and far more interactive experiences than existing blockchains.\u201d\n\nTVL drops after the disclosure\n\nShould the proposal go live, it could bring about an influx of users on the Sei blockchain.

At press time, TVL was down to $3.26 million.\n\nThis drawdown was because protocols like SeaSwap and Fuzio experienced a decrease in the liquidity locked in them.\n\nThe decrease in the TVL suggests that market participants doubt that Sie would provide the yield desired if assets are locked in the protocol. But 30 days back, that was not the case.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 SEIs worth today?\n\nHowever, there is a chance that the mood sentiment toward the project may change.\n\nOne reason for this assumption is the higher throughput and cheaper transaction costs the network may soon start to offer."

        "content": "In the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrencies, earning passive income has become a tantalizing prospect for investors looking to invest in the ethereum blockchain. With Ethereum staking on the Everstake platform, you can unlock the exciting potential of generating consistent returns while actively participating in the cryptocurrencies ecosystem and the blockchain network. It\u2019s a great investment opportunity. By staking your assets in the crypto ecosystem, specifically on the Ethereum network, you contribute to the security and maintenance of cryptocurrencies while earning investment rewards. This can be done through platforms like Everstake.\n\nStaking in the crypto ecosystem involves locking up your cryptocurrencies to support the network\u2019s operations and validate transactions through smart contracts. Everstake provides liquidity for staking on the Ethereum blockchain. In exchange for your contribution, you earn yields in the form of stETH tokens or other derivative tokens through crypto staking, including liquid staking and smart staking, with Everstake. These crypto staking tokens can be further utilized within ethereum blockchain DeFi protocols or even exchanged for liquidity in many eth exchange.\n\nBy engaging in the staking process with Everstake, you not only contribute to the decentralized Ethereum blockchain network but also open doors to potential high-yield opportunities with staked ETH. So, if you\u2019re looking to explore new avenues for passive income generation within the crypto space, Everstake offers an enticing option for Ethereum investors. With Everstake\u2019s wallet, you can participate in Ethereum staking and earn rewards. Yearn for a profitable venture? Consider Everstake for your staking needs.\n\nUnderstanding the Basics of Ethereum Staking\n\nWhat is Ethereum Staking?\n\nTo gain a clear understanding of Ethereum staking with Everstake, a leading crypto staking provider, it\u2019s important to first differentiate it from traditional mining. Unlike mining, which involves solving complex mathematical problems to validate transactions, staking allows users to participate in the network by holding and securing their crypto assets in private transactions. This can be done individually or through staking pools offered by Everstake. While mining involves solving complex mathematical puzzles to validate transactions and secure the network on the Ethereum blockchain, staking operates on a different principle known as proof-of-stake. Staked ETH is a form of crypto that is used in the staking process. Everstake is a platform that offers staking services for various cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum.\n\nThe Significance of Proof-of-Stake\n\nProof-of-stake, also known as crypto staking, is a consensus mechanism used in blockchain networks like Ethereum. It involves the participation of staking validators, such as Everstake, and can also be done through liquid staking. Unlike proof-of-work (used in mining), where miners compete to solve computational puzzles, proof-of-stake relies on validators who are chosen based on their stake, or the amount of cryptocurrency they hold and \u201cstake\u201d in the network. This applies to liquid staking, eth staking, and staked eth, which are popular methods used by validators like Everstake.\n\nThis shift to proof-of-stake brings several advantages. First, crypto significantly reduces energy consumption since validators don\u2019t need powerful hardware to solve puzzles in liquid staking pools. Additionally, it enables private transactions. This makes staking more environmentally friendly compared to mining.\n\nThe Role of Validators\n\nValidators play a crucial role in the staking process. They are responsible for proposing and validating new blocks on the Ethereum blockchain, including crypto, liquid staking, private transactions, and pools. To become a validator in the crypto world, one needs to meet certain requirements such as holding a minimum amount of Ether (ETH) and running specialized software for liquid staking.\n\nValidators in the crypto network are incentivized through rewards for their participation in securing the network, including liquid staking and eth staking. Additionally, validators play a crucial role in maintaining the privacy of transactions, ensuring private transactions remain secure. These rewards come in the form of additional ETH generated through block validation, private transactions, and transaction fees paid by crypto users participating in liquid staking with their tokens.\n\nValidator Keys and Responsibilities\n\nWhen becoming a validator for private transactions, individuals generate two keys: an activation key and a withdrawal key for liquid staking of their crypto tokens. The activation key is used during the setup process to activate their validator status in private transactions, while the withdrawal key allows them to exit the staking process and withdraw their funds from everstake pools when desired.\n\nOnce activated, validators must perform various tasks efficiently. In private transactions, they need to propose new blocks by creating cryptographic signatures using their activation keys for liquid staking and eth staking. This ensures the security of the token. In liquid staking, participants must attest or confirm the validity of other proposed blocks by signing them with their eth staking keys. This process helps secure the token pools.\n\nLiquid Staking and Smart Staking\n\nLiquid staking is an emerging concept that allows everstake to use staked assets in other financial activities through pools. The steth token is utilized in this process. Everstake\u2019s liquid staking pools allow users to access the value of their staked Ethereum (stETH) without waiting for the lock-up period to end. This flexibility makes staking with Everstake more appealing as it provides liquidity and potential additional earning opportunities through pools and StETH.\n\nSmart staking, also known as everstake, involves the use of smart contracts on the Ethereum network to automate and simplify the staking process in steth pools. These liquid staking contracts handle various aspects such as delegation, rewards distribution, and penalties for misbehavior in eth staking. Everstake is a reliable provider for these contracts.\n\nPros and Cons of Ethereum Staking Yields\n\nAdvantages of Ethereum Staking Yields\n\nEarning yields through Ethereum staking with everstake offers several advantages, especially for those looking for a liquid investment option. One significant benefit of liquid staking and everstake is the reduced energy consumption compared to traditional mining methods. Unlike mining, which requires powerful hardware and consumes substantial amounts of electricity, staking involves validating transactions on the blockchain by holding a certain amount of cryptocurrency in a wallet. With everstake, you can stake your eth and earn rewards while keeping your assets liquid. This process, known as proof-of-stake (PoS), significantly reduces the environmental impact associated with energy-intensive eth staking and mining operations. With liquid staking, you can easily participate in eth staking through platforms like everstake.\n\nAnother advantage of Ethereum staking with Everstake is the potential for higher returns on investment in liquid assets. By participating in staking with Everstake, individuals can earn additional ETH tokens as rewards for helping secure the network in a liquid form. These rewards are typically proportional to the amount of cryptocurrency being staked, including liquid staking and eth staking. Everstake is a popular platform for participating in these staking activities. With the increasing popularity and adoption of cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, stakers have the opportunity to generate passive income over time through liquid staking with everstake.\n\nStaking with Everstake provides an added layer of security to the liquid Ethereum network.

This wallet will serve as your secure storage for ETH tokens and allow you to participate in the staking process effectively. Choose a reputable wallet provider that supports staking, such as MetaMask or Ledger Live, for your eth.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve selected an ETH wallet provider, follow their instructions to create an account and set up your ETH wallet. Make sure to securely store your ETH recovery phrase or seed phrase, as it will be crucial for accessing your ETH wallet in case of any unforeseen circumstances.\n\nChoosing a Reputable Staking Platform\n\nSelecting the right staking platform for eth is crucial for optimizing your yield generation. Consider factors such as reputation, security measures, fees, user experience, and ETH when choosing a platform that aligns with your goals and preferences.\n\nResearch different staking platforms available in the market for eth and evaluate their track records. Look for platforms that have been operating successfully for some time and have positive reviews from users. When searching for platforms to invest in, it is important to consider their track record and the feedback from users. This will help you make an informed decision and choose a platform that has a proven history of success. Additionally, positive reviews from users indicate that the platform is reliable and trustworthy. By considering these factors, you can find a platform that aligns with your investment goals and provides a secure environment for trading eth. Consider the level of decentralization offered by each platform, as this can impact the security and reliability of the staking process, especially when using eth.\n\nSecurely Delegating Your ETH Tokens\n\nOnce you\u2019ve chosen a reputable staking platform, it\u2019s time to delegate your ETH tokens to a validator. Validators are responsible for securing the network and validating transactions on the Ethereum blockchain. By delegating your tokens to an eth validator, you contribute to the network\u2019s security while earning eth rewards in return.\n\nBefore delegating your ETH tokens, ensure that you thoroughly research and select trustworthy validators on the chosen staking platform. Look for validators with high uptime percentages and low commission rates to maximize your yield potential with eth.\n\nWhen delegating your tokens, it is important to follow best practices for securely storing them, especially when dealing with eth. Keep your ETH in cold storage or hardware wallets rather than leaving them on exchanges or online wallets to reduce the risk of unauthorized access or loss of funds.\n\nMaximizing Yield Generation\n\nTo optimize your yield generation through Ethereum staking, it\u2019s essential to stay informed about the latest developments and best practices in the crypto space. Keep an eye on market trends, network upgrades, and changes in staking protocols that may impact your rewards, especially in the eth market.\n\nConsider diversifying your staked assets by allocating them to multiple validators in the eth network. This helps mitigate risks associated with a single ETH validator\u2019s performance or potential slashing events. By spreading your ETH tokens across different validators, you can increase the likelihood of earning consistent yields over time.\n\nRegularly monitor your staking rewards in eth and adjust your strategy accordingly. Some staking platforms offer options for re-delegating rewards automatically or compounding them to maximize long-term gains with eth. Stay proactive in managing your staked ETH assets to ensure optimal yield generation.\n\nExploring Pooled vs. Solo Ethereum Staking\n\nDifferences between pooled and solo staking options\n\nPooled (delegated) and solo (non-delegated) staking are two options available for ETH holders looking to stake their tokens. Pooled staking involves joining a group of validators, while solo staking allows individuals to validate transactions on the Ethereum network independently.\n\nBenefits of joining a pool\n\nJoining a pool can offer several advantages for those interested in Ethereum staking. One benefit is the lower entry barrier. By pooling their funds with other participants, users can contribute a smaller amount of ETH compared to the minimum requirement for solo staking. This makes it more accessible for individuals who may not have large amounts of ETH but still want to participate in staking.\n\nAnother advantage of pooled staking is shared rewards. When validators in an ETH pool successfully validate ETH transactions, the rewards are distributed among all participants based on their contribution. This means that even if an individual\u2019s validator does not produce a block, they can still earn rewards through the collective efforts of the eth pool.\n\nPooled staking contributes to increased decentralization of the network. As more participants join ETH pools, it helps distribute power and decision-making across multiple validators rather than concentrated in the hands of a few large ETH stakeholders. This aligns with one of Ethereum\u2019s core principles: creating a decentralized and secure blockchain network.\n\nConsiderations for solo staking\n\nWhile pooled staking offers benefits, some individuals may prefer solo staking for greater control over their assets and potentially higher rewards. This is especially true for those who hold eth and want to maximize their earnings. Solo stakers have complete autonomy over their eth validator node without relying on any external entities or sharing rewards with others.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s essential to note that solo stakers also face additional technical requirements compared to those who join eth pools. They need to set up and maintain their own validator infrastructure, including hardware, software configuration, security measures, and continuous monitoring.\n\nSolo staking also requires a higher minimum stake than pooled staking, which may limit participation for those with smaller amounts of ETH. Moreover, solo stakers bear the full responsibility of maintaining their validator\u2019s uptime and ensuring it performs optimally to maximize rewards.\n\nMaking an informed decision\n\nWhen deciding between pooled and solo staking, it\u2019s crucial to consider personal preferences and circumstances. Pooled staking offers convenience, lower entry barriers, shared rewards, and contributes to network decentralization. On the other hand, solo staking provides greater control over assets but requires additional technical expertise and a higher minimum stake.\n\nUltimately, the choice depends on factors such as the amount of ETH available for staking, technical proficiency, risk tolerance, and desired level of involvement in the Ethereum network.\n\nThe Impact of the Merge on Ethereum Staking\n\nEthereum 2.0 Upgrade and Implications for Stakers\n\nThe upcoming Ethereum 2.0 upgrade, also known as the merge, is set to bring significant changes to the Ethereum network and its staking ecosystem. This transition involves a shift from the current proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism to a more energy-efficient proof-of-stake (PoS) model. As an Ethereum staker, it\u2019s crucial to understand how this upgrade will impact your staking rewards and the overall security of the network.\n\nChanges in Staking Rewards and Network Security\n\nWith the merge, one of the most notable changes for stakers is likely to be in their yields or returns on their staked Ether. Currently, under PoW, miners are rewarded with newly minted Ether for validating transactions and securing the network. However, once Ethereum transitions to PoS, miners will no longer exist, and instead, validators will play a crucial role.\n\nValidators will need to lock up their Ether as collateral in order to participate in block validation. In return for their participation and maintaining network security, they will receive rewards in the form of additional Ether. These rewards are expected to be significantly lower compared to mining rewards but can still provide attractive returns depending on various factors such as total amount staked and network participation.\n\nTimeline and Potential Changes During Transition\n\nWhile there isn\u2019t an exact timeline for when the merge will occur, it\u2019s important for stakers to stay informed about potential changes that may arise during this transition period. As development progresses and upgrades are implemented, there may be adjustments made to optimize performance or address any unforeseen challenges.\n\nStaying updated with news from official sources like Ethereum Foundation announcements or participating in online communities dedicated to Ethereum can help you navigate through any potential changes smoothly. By staying informed about these developments, you can make necessary adjustments or take advantage of new opportunities that may arise.\n\nEnsuring Network Security and Participation\n\nAs Ethereum moves towards a PoS consensus mechanism, network security becomes paramount. Validators play a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of the network by proposing and validating blocks. To ensure the network\u2019s security, it is essential for a sufficient number of validators to participate actively.\n\nAs an Ethereum staker, you can contribute to the network\u2019s security by becoming a validator yourself or delegating your stake to trusted validators. By actively participating in block validation, you not only help secure the network but also earn rewards for your contribution.\n\nSelecting the Best Platforms for Ethereum Staking\n\nChoosing the right platform is crucial.

This places Bitcoin\u2019s yearly emissions on par with Cambodia\u2019s 2020 output, as reported by Climate Watch.\n\nMeanwhile, the comparative analysis showcases Ethereum\u2019s strides in reducing its ecological footprint and sets a precedent for the broader blockchain and cryptocurrency space.\n\nWhile cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) predominantly function as investment tools, Ethereum\u2019s commitment to reducing emissions provides a blueprint for the industry. As global leaders convene for the COP28 climate summit, Ethereum\u2019s environmental success story challenges the narrative surrounding blockchain\u2019s environmental impact, encouraging further exploration of sustainable practices within the crypto sphere.\n\nAlso Read: Binance Burns 4 Billion Terra Luna Classic (LUNC) Tokens"

        "title": "Why Solana might outshine Ethereum in 2024 - Finbold - Finance in Bold",
        "content": "As the cryptocurrency market anticipates a potential bull market, investors may consider accumulating altcoins in preparation for it.\n\nA notable trend has emerged where altcoins are gaining significant strength, as evidenced by their recent breach of the 50-week simple moving average (SMA) barrier, signaling a more positive investor sentiment toward them.\n\nChart of Altcoins crossing the 50-week SMA barrier. Source CryptoCon\n\nIn the next phase of the market expansion, Solana (SOL) is expected to reach 10% of Ethereum (ETH), according to InvestAnswers, a prominent crypto analyst.\n\nAssuming Ethereum tops $8,000 in the next bull market, the analyst speculates that if Solana reaches 10% of ETH\u2019s market cap, a threshold it has already reached in the past, that would mean a $231 price target for SOL, resulting in a return on investment (ROI) of approximately 278% from the current price of $61.02.\n\nA few days ago, Solana\u2019s DeFi ecosystem reached a significant milestone, with its Total Value Locked (TVL) hitting a new yearly peak of over $655 million. This marks a substantial increase of 211% since the $210.47 million TVL recorded on January 1.\n\n\n\nFurthermore, Solana boasts a remarkable transaction speed of tens of thousands of transactions per second (TPS), far surpassing Ethereum\u2019s 15 TPS. This makes Solana a favorable choice for applications demanding high throughput, such as decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and non-fungible token (NFT) marketplaces.\n\nSOL reaching a new market cap\n\nIn a more optimistic scenario, InvestAnswers suggests that Solana reaching 20% of Ethereum\u2019s market capitalization is not entirely implausible.\n\n\n\nIf Solana were to achieve this milestone, it would translate to a market capitalization of around $192 billion, according to the expert.\n\nConsidering the potential market cap of $192 billion and token quantities, this would translate into a price of $453 for 1 SOL, resulting in a ROI of around 2,038% from the current price of $61.02.\n\nHypothetical price of SOL. Source: Finbold\n\nInvestAnswers highlights that Solana has already exceeded the 10% threshold in the past.\n\nThe analyst presented a chart depicting SOL\u2019s upside potential, where the yellow line represents 10% of ETH\u2019s market cap, and the blue line represents Solana\u2019s price crossing this threshold in October 2021.\n\nMarket caps of SOL and ETH. Source: InvestAnswers\n\nCathie Wood praises Solana\u2019s speed and efficiency\n\nSolana reached a new year-to-day (YTD) high a day after ARK Invest (NYSEARCA: ARKK) CEO Cathie Wood extolled the network for its efficiency and cost-effectiveness.\n\nSOL one-month price performance. Source: Finbold\n\nDuring a CNBC interview on November 15, Wood characterized the Solana network as a significant infrastructure player within the broader blockchain ecosystem.\n\nShe expressed satisfaction with its performance in recent market conditions, stating that Solana has been doing a \u201creally good job.\u201d Drawing a parallel to the historical comparison between Bitcoin and Ethereum, she said:\n\n\u201cEther was faster and cheaper than Bitcoin in the day \u2014 that\u2019s how we got Ether. Solana is even faster and cost-effective than Ether,\u201d Wood said\n\nWood praised Solana for its speed and efficiency compared to the Ethereum network, but predicting the project\u2019s potential remains challenging. Solana is a nascent project, and various factors come into play when determining its future price.\n\nFundamentals: SOL vs ETH\n\nSolana\u2019s innovative proof of history (PoH) consensus mechanism utilizes a verifiable record of past events to achieve network-wide consensus. This approach enables it to complete tens of thousands of transactions per second at a remarkably low fee, making the ecosystem ideal for applications demanding high throughput.\n\nOn the other hand, Ethereum\u2019s transition from proof of work (PoW) to proof of stake (PoS), known as \u2018The Ethereum Merge,\u2019 marked a significant step in the Ethereum roadmap.\n\nThe Merge has brought down Ethereum\u2019s energy consumption by 99.95%, addressing one of the longest-standing issues with PoW-based blockchain systems, but it didn\u2019t address the issues of only 15 TPS and high costs on the network.\n\nSolana Labs Co-Founder Anatoly Yakovenko believes the Merge has minimal impact on improving Ethereum\u2019s scalability based on the number of transactions and users, he said during an interview with Bloomberg Technology on September 21.\n\n\u201cThe Ethereum Merge doesn\u2019t really improve the scalability of the network. When you look at the number of transactions that Solana (SOL) handles from applications and from users on a daily basis, that\u2019s more than not just Ethereum but all Ethereum-based blockchains combined. So I think Ethereum has a long way to go on scalability,\u201d Yakovenko said\n\nTo address the issues of scalability, Ethereum is going to implement sharding and zk rollups. This approach will significantly reduce the load on the main chain, enabling faster transaction processing and lower fees, but it\u2019s years away, according to the Ethereum Foundation.\n\nSome are concert about the Solana ecosystem and question its long-term sustainability and resilience, and while the developer community is growing, it is still far behind Ethereum\u2019s well-established ecosystem of developers and projects.\n\nSolana holds an advantage over Ethereum in terms of transaction speed and scalability, making it an attractive choice for projects with high throughput demands. While Ethereum is working on addressing these limitations, it may take several years to achieve the same level of performance as Solana. This paraphrase might be the main reason SOL will outperform ETH in the next bull market, but the project\u2019s long-term success hinges on its ability to grow and address network stability issues.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "content": "The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) began to accept comments on Fidelity\u2019s proposed spot Ethereum ETF through a Nov. 30 filing.\n\nThat filing indicates that the securities agency is now soliciting comments on a proposed rule change from Cboe BZX. If approved, that rule change will allow the exchange to list and trade Fidelity\u2019s Ethereum Fund shares.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s request for comments resembles similar filings regarding other spot crypto ETF proposals. It asks for comments about surveillance, custodianship, and market manipulation, among other matters. Notably, the filing highlights a surveillance sharing agreement that Coinbase and Cboe BZX established in June, a critical component also found in many other pending spot crypto ETF proposals.\n\nThe filing also acknowledges a lack of existing U.S.-regulated and U.S. exchange-traded investments that provide exposure to ETH, whereas European markets already offer regulated investments that provide exposure to spot crypto assets.\n\nDecision likely by March 2024\n\nThe filing sets a timeline for the SEC to approve, disapprove, or start proceedings to determine whether to disapprove the proposed rule change. These comments are considered in the final decision-making process. The SEC is required to reach a decision within 45 days of the current notice\u2019s publication in the federal register; however, the SEC can extend the decision period by up to 90 days and then further by 60 days if necessary.\n\nThough exact deadlines may differ, Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart estimated that the SEC\u2019s next decision deadline for Fidelity will be Jan. 21, 2024, and its final decision will be March 8, 2024. He added that he will have knowledge of \u201cdefinitive deadlines in the coming weeks.\u201d\n\nFidelity initially filed for its spot Ethereum ETF on Nov. 17, days after its competitor BlackRock filed for an equivalent fund on Nov. 15. Both firms also filed for spot Bitcoin ETFs this summer starting in mid-June.\n\nSeveral other asset managers, including Ark Invest, VanEck, and Grayscale, also have pending spot crypto ETF proposals."

        "content": "The Bitcoin ETF token is not officially affiliated with the spot Bitcoin ETFs currently under review by the United States SEC.\n\nIn a recent episode of the Bankless podcast, analysts David Hoffman and Ryan Adams discussed Solana's (SOL) attributes, such as its speed and low fees, and how these might compare to Ethereum\u2019s (ETH).\n\nWhile both networks have potential, the Bankless experts pointed to SOL\u2019s price performance relative to ETH, suggesting it could be one factor to consider for investors looking to choose between the two.\n\nMeanwhile, some investors are looking towards a brand-new altcoin called Bitcoin ETF Token (BTCETF) that could outpace Solana and Ethereum in the coming year.\n\nBankless podcast explores Solana\u2019s potential to outpace Ethereum\n\nIn a Bankless episode from November 9, co-hosts David and Ryan explored the recent discourse around Solana versus Ethereum.\n\nWhile David and Ryan discussed various aspects of both blockchains, they highlighted certain features of Solana that might appeal to some investors.\n\nFor example, David notes that Solana has \u201ccaptured a narrative moment\u201d with its recent price run-up and mentions the blockchain has attracted a specific type of developer that Ethereum likely couldn\u2019t.\n\nRyan also observes that Solana occupies a unique design space no other blockchain can fill.\n\nLater, the hosts make reference to Chris Burniske, former head of crypto research at ARK Invest.\n\nBurniske tweeted a price chart for the SOL/ETH trading pair on August 31, showing SOL strength.\n\nAlongside the price chart, Burniske also set a much higher price target for the pair, suggesting that he believes Solana will outperform Ethereum soon.\n\nBurniske\u2019s prediction has come true, with the SOL/ETH pair now sitting at 0.029 ETH \u2013 148% higher than when he posted.\n\nUltimately, the optimistic views of the Bankless hosts and Chris Burniske hint that Solana has a chance at outpacing Ethereum in the weeks ahead.\n\nSOL vs. ETH \u2013 Key differences in the race for supremacy\n\nBuilding off the optimistic sentiment towards Solana\u2019s potential, investors often point to some critical differences between the two networks that set them apart.\n\nSolana prioritizes speed and throughput over anything else, using a unique \u201cproof-of-history\u201d mechanism that enables much faster validation times.\n\nFor example, Solana can currently process over 3,900 transactions per second.\n\nIn contrast, Ethereum is far slower, processing 29 transactions per second.\n\nAs such, Solana\u2019s focus on speed attracts developers looking to build high-throughput applications.\n\nHowever, some experts point out that Ethereum's longer history may contribute to its decentralization and security.\n\nEthereum also has a well-established developer ecosystem, with the most developers building out of any blockchain.\n\nBoth blockchains have their merits, but the positive comments from experts like Chris Burniske suggest there\u2019s potential for Solana to overtake Ethereum next year.\n\nNew Bitcoin ETF Token presale looks to benefit from spot BTC ETF buzz\n\nAs Solana and Ethereum battle it out for supremacy, there\u2019s a new project that some speculate could outperform both \u2013 Bitcoin ETF Token (BTCETF).\n\nStill in its presale phase, Bitcoin ETF Token is an ERC-20 token that aims to capitalize on the buzz around spot Bitcoin ETF approval in the US.\n\nThe project has a deflationary model, with plans to burn 25% of the total supply based on certain ETF adoption milestones.\n\nAccording to the project\u2019s whitepaper, Bitcoin ETF Token also taxes sellers to enhance the total burning amount, adding to the deflationary effects.\n\nAs more supply gets burned, the remaining tokens could grow in value \u2013 assuming demand also increases.\n\nMoreover, with the first spot BTC ETF being close to approval after years of delays, a new Bitcoin ETF Token launch will be right on time.\n\nCrypto influencers like Austin Hilton are already covering the presale, and the project is gathering more attention and gearing up for its market debut.\n\nConsidering the widespread excitement around a spot BTC ETF, there\u2019s a belief the project could benefit from this wave of interest \u2013 positioning it for growth beyond what Solana and Ethereum could see.\n\nAlthough there\u2019s no way of telling whether Bitcoin ETF Token will live up to its hype or produce higher returns than SOL or ETH, the community keeps the optimist high, highlighting that the token can surprise many people if executed correctly."

ETH is now rising, and the bulls seem to be aiming for a move toward the $2,200 level.\n\nEthereum is making a fresh attempt to clear the $2,100 and $2,120 resistance levels.\n\nThe price is trading above $2,050 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere was a break above a major contracting triangle with resistance near $2,055 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair could gain bullish momentum if it clears the $2,120 resistance zone.\n\nEthereum Price Regains Strength\n\nEthereum price started a downside correction below the $2,050 level. ETH tested the $2,020 support, where the bulls took a stand. A low was formed near $2,019 before the price climbed higher, like Bitcoin.\n\nThe price cleared the $2,050 resistance zone. There was a break above a major contracting triangle with resistance near $2,055 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The pair climbed above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2,126 swing high to the $1,986 low.\n\nEthereum is now trading above $2,050 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.

        "content": "The Ethereum network has seen a surge in daily validator exit since the beginning of October.\n\nThis may be due to the recent uptick in Ether\u2019s value.\n\nEthereum\u2019s [ETH] staking pool has experienced a shift since the beginning of October, with an increasing number of validators opting to withdraw their staked ETH, Glassnode found in a new report.\n\nAccording to the on-chain data provider, since the beginning of October, an average count of 1018 validators have exited the proof-of-stake (PoS) network daily.\n\nThis trend coincides with the recent upswing in the altcoin\u2019s price in the last month, suggesting that validators are capitalizing on the opportunity to capture gains on their previously staked ETH.\n\nValidator exit has network-wide impacts\n\nTo serve as a validator on the Ethereum network, a minimum amount of 32 ETH is to be staked. Since the October rally began, there has been a steady decline in the number of unique addresses holding this amount of ETH.\n\nAt press time, 125,189 addresses held at least 32 ETH, having declined by 1% since the 1st of October.\n\nGlassnode found further that most exits recorded in the last eight weeks have been voluntary. Validators are deemed to have exited the network voluntarily when they independently decide to exit the ETH 2.0 staking pool.\n\nThis differs from slashing events that account for validators being removed from the network for violating protocol rules. In the last two weeks, only two of such events were recorded, Glassnode said.\n\nIn addition, due to a rise in the daily number of exiting validators on the network, there has been a corresponding fall in ETH issuance. This refers to the total amount of new ETH coins added to its current supply.\n\nAccording to the report:\n\n\u201cAs the growth rate of validators slows and declines, the daily ETH issuance has experienced a corresponding slowdown. Over the last 7-days, the growth rate of ETH issuance has slowed by up to 0.5% per day. Notably, the rate of issuance has decreased for the first time in recent days.\u201d\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ETHs worth today?\n\nRegarding the entity types that have facilitated the most withdrawals since the beginning of October, Glassnode found that centralized exchanges have been responsible."

The regulatory authority is engaging in discussions regarding the potential approval of a spot Ethereum Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF).\n\nThis pivotal development has injected optimism into the Ethereum market, as the prospect of an ETF introduces new possibilities for mainstream adoption and investment, further fueling the current upward trajectory of Ether\u2019s value.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Ascending Triangle: Bullish Breakout Potential\n\nOver the course of several months, the price of Ethereum has been in a consolidation trend that has resulted in the formation of an ascending triangle. Although the technical formation is bullish by nature, this is only true following a profitable breakout.\n\nTrend lines connect the equal highs and higher lows of the ascending triangle configuration. This arrangement indicates that investors are growing more confident and buying the dips at a faster pace.\n\nETHUSD currently trading at $2,066 on the daily chart: TradingView.com\n\nInterestingly, today\u2019s charts show there are no \u201cdips\u201d to buy, as Ethereum broke past the vaunted $2,000 level to welcome December on a high note.\n\nEthereum is not only keeping up, but also rising to unprecedented heights. The price of ETH is currently up 3% at $2,100, and investors and enthusiasts are excited about the possibility of a rally to $3,000 or even higher.\n\nEther\u2019s impressive success against Bitcoin, outperforming the alpha cryptocurrency by almost 5%, is a major indicator of this. Important on-chain signals imply that ETH may continue to outperform BTC this month.\n\nFidelity Filing Fuels Ethereum Optimism\n\nThe first indication of a bullish move was a breakout over the psychological $2,000 barrier, although there has been a lot of see-saw motion around this level. More specifically, ETH is trading between the weekly support level at $1,930 and the high for the second quarter at $2,140. This is the fourth week in a row that this has been happening.\n\n#Ethereum Spot ETF filing by Fidelity!

Given this submission, he affirms his conviction that after Bitcoin\u2019s rapid increase, Ethereum is positioned to attain $3,500 throughout the initial quarter of 2024.\n\nSource: Santiment\n\nIn a related development, research shows there has been a significant increase in Ethereum whale accumulation. On-chain data indicates that the biggest Ethereum wallets, according to Santiment, are showing a positive pattern that suggests a big change.\n\nETH Price Volatility Trends vs. Bitcoin. Source: IntoTheBlock\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum has an amazing 30-day Average Intra-Day Volatility score of 0.45%, surpassing Bitcoin\u2019s 0.32%, a recent research by IntoTheBlock shows.\n\nInvestment strategies may need to change as a result of this change in volatility dynamics, which would highlight the Ethereum market\u2019s dynamic prospects.\n\n(This site\u2019s content should not be construed as investment advice.

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has officially acknowledged Fidelity Investments' filing for a spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF). This follows Fidelity's application on Nov. 17.\n\nThe filing kicks off a public comment period, during which interested parties can voice their views on the viability of such a product. The SEC is supposed to announce its decision after 240 days.\n\nFidelity's Ethereum gambit\n\nEarlier this month Fidelity Investments filed for a spot Ethereum ETF, extending its crypto investment offerings beyond its earlier Bitcoin ETF application.\n\nThe application stressed the importance of such a product for U.S. investors, suggesting that a regulated Ethereum ETF would provide safer investment options compared to the current alternatives.\n\nThis move gained further relevance against the backdrop of a recent court ruling questioning the SEC\u2019s stance on rejecting spot crypto ETFs while allowing futures-based ETFs.\n\nHigh approval odds\n\nAnalysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas have expressed optimism about the approval odds for Ethereum ETFs, citing a recent surge in similar applications and the SEC's evolving approach to crypto-based financial products.\n\nThey estimate a 75% chance of Ethereum futures ETFs being approved, particularly in light of the SEC's prior approval of Bitcoin futures ETFs.\n\nHowever, the market's response to existing Ethereum futures ETFs, which debuted in early October, was underwhelming. These ETFs recorded a total trading volume of around $1.7 million in their initial hours, a sharp contrast to the successful launch of the first futures-based Bitcoin ETFs."

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nIn an unexpected announcement at Devconnect in Turkey, Ethereum\u2019s co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, revealed a visionary proposal that could make drastic changes to the Ethereum network. The proposed redesign, if implemented, could revolutionize the overall experience of users and developers within the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nEnhanced Ethereum Staking\n\nThe main goal of Buterin is to make strategic improvements to Ethereum staking, aiming to make the network more secure and scalable.\n\nAnd in turn, this will position Ethereum as a more affordable and user-friendly platform.\n\nPrivate Mempools\n\nAnother standout feature in Buterin\u2019s proposal is the integration of private mempools.\n\nThis innovative addition elevates user privacy and security by enabling transactions without exposing them to the public mempool.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis protects users from exploitation by miners, providing control over the visibility of their transaction history.\n\nThe Importance of ERC-4337\n\nThe introduction of ERC-4337 marks a significant stride in account abstraction.\n\nThis protocol gives users more control over their accounts and helps with the implementation of multi-signature wallets. Simultaneously, it improves overall security, which benefits the whole Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nCode Precompilation \u2013 Streamlining Smart Contracts\n\nButerin\u2019s proposal also includes the integration of code precompilation, which aims to help with the deployment of smart contracts.\n\nBy preprocessing specific elements of the code, this innovation could potentially increase the efficiency of executing smart contracts, making them quicker and more cost-effective.\n\nDecentralized Liquid Staking\n\nExpressing concerns over the centralization of existing liquid staking solutions, Buterin emphasizes the need for improvement in this area.\n\nLiquid staking allows users to liquidate staked or locked assets, but centralization risks have prompted Buterin to call for a decentralized approach. This move could democratize the staking process and allow more users to participate without sacrificing liquidity.\n\nThe Ripple Effect on Ethereum\u2019s Future\n\nIf Buterin\u2019s proposed redesign becomes a reality, Ethereum could solve its issues with scalability. These changes could significantly lower the barrier to entry for new users and developers, creating a more diverse ecosystem. While the exact impact on Ethereum\u2019s price and the broader crypto market remains speculative, trends suggest that fundamental improvements tend to increase a network\u2019s user base and value.\n\nEthereum is committed to evolving and implementing the latest blockchain technologies. And these upgrades can make it even better in terms of security and scalability. After all, it\u2019s not a surprise that Ethereum is the leading L1 chain."

        "content": "Thu 30 Nov 2023 \u25aa 4 min of reading \u25aa by Fitah\n\nA major transformation is shaking up Ethereum: validators are leaving the ship, slowing the issuance of new tokens. Coupled with a rise in network activity, this is making the global supply of the cryptocurrency ETH deflationary. Let\u2019s decrypt it!\n\n\u201cExodus\u201d of Validators on Ethereum\n\nWhile the price of Ethereum cryptocurrency is stalled around $2000, a significant change is taking place on the network. Indeed, the supply of ETH is undergoing a major shift, becoming deflationary once again.\n\nGlassnode\n\nThis deflation results from two key factors. First, there is the slowdown in the number of validators in the staking pools. Then, there is the increase in daily Ethereum cryptocurrency fees burned via EIP1559, fueled by an intensification of network activity\n\nThe growing number of validators leaving the pool since October indeed slows down the growth of the network. This leads to a decrease in the issuance of new ETH crypto tokens. According to Glassnode\u2019s analysis, the number of participant exits has seen a notable increase. This has gone from an average of 309 per day in October to an impressive average of 1018 validators per day since early November. This trend aligns with the recent rise in crypto prices.\n\nGlassnode\n\nThe massive exits of participants, mostly voluntary, are particularly concentrated among the CEXs such as Kraken and Coinbase. A modest increase in exits at the liquid staking provider, Lido, is also highlighted.\n\nIncreased Activity and Pressure on ETH\n\nAccording to Glassnode\u2019s analysis, the network is also experiencing a significant increase in transaction demand, particularly for token transfers and stablecoins. This increased pressure on the network leads to a rise in gas fees, generating a notable growth in Ethereum fees burned via EIP 1559.\n\nGlassnode\n\nIn October, the daily amount of Ethereum burned reached 899 ETH, a figure that has climbed to 5,368 ETH in less than a month. These figures reflect a spike in activity, pushing Ethereum to new heights of demand and transactions.\n\nThis double pressure translates into a critical situation: ETH is once again becoming a deflationary resource. The reduction in the number of validators leads to a slowdown in the issuance of ETH. While the explosion in network activity exerts upward pressure on gas fees.\n\nThe combined effect of these two factors shows that Ethereum is responding to market changes. This creates a situation where the supply of ETH is once again shrinking, moving towards deflation.\n\nHow will this new dynamic influence the choices of investors in the weeks to come?\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program!

        "content": "Spanish police have arrested a c who helped Ethereum developer Virgil Griffith violate U.S. sanctions and travel to North Korea, Reuters reported on Dec. 1.\n\nLocal authorities reportedly discovered that Alejandro Cao de Benos was in Barcelona under a false identity and intended to travel by train to Madrid. Police arrested Cao de Benos at a Madrid train station on Nov. 30.\n\nCao de Benos was released without conditions after appearing before a High Court judge on Dec. 1. Reportedly, an extradition process is pending, though the U.S. must formalize its extradition request and provide documentation.\n\nThe accused insisted that he would not be extradited, writing on X:\n\n\u201cThere is no extradition. The US accusation, in addition to being false, does not exist in Spain \u2026 My thanks to all your messages and to the [Spanish police] for their good treatment and personal support.\u201d\n\nCao de Benos noted that a particular order was given under former U.S. President Donald Trump. Though the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) charged Cao de Benos and another individual in April 2022 after Trump\u2019s presidency ended, an FBI poster suggests that charges were underway as early as January.\n\nAccused organized conference and arranged travel\n\nVirgil Griffith traveled to North Korea to participate in a crypto and blockchain conference in April 2019. He was arrested that November. In addition to violating sanctions, U.S. authorities said that Griffith provided information that could help North Korea evade sanctions and engage in money laundering. Griffith was convicted in 2021 and sentenced in 2022; he is currently in prison.\n\nThe DOJ alleges that Cao de Benos, through his own Korean Friendship Association and in cooperation with a U.S. businessman named Christopher Emms, helped organize the blockchain conference that Griffith attended.\n\nFurthermore, Cao de Benos and Emms allegedly recruited Griffith and arranged for him to travel to the country. The DOJ also states that Cao de Benos told Griffith that North Korea would not stamp his passport, thereby concealing Griffith\u2019s travel. After the conference concluded, Cao de Benos and Emms supposedly worked with Griffith on other North Korea-related blockchain efforts.\n\nCao De Benos and Emms have each been charged with one count of conspiring to violate and evade U.S. Sanctions for a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. Both are presumed innocent until found guilty."

        "content": "In a significant move for the cryptocurrency market, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has opened the floor for public comments on a proposed rule change. This change could allow Fidelity Investments, a major asset management firm, to offer shares of its spot Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded fund (ETF). This proposal marks a pivotal moment in integrating cryptocurrencies into mainstream financial products.\n\nSEC Reviews Fidelity Ethereum ETF Proposal\n\nThe SEC\u2019s November 30 announcement invites \u201cinterested persons\u201d to share their views on Fidelity\u2019s proposal. This follows Fidelity\u2019s November 17 application for the ETF, which seeks to list and trade shares of its Fidelity Ethereum Fund on the Cboe BZX Exchange. The move by Fidelity is part of a broader trend among asset management firms aiming to launch spot crypto ETFs in the U.S.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe SEC\u2019s decision to solicit public feedback represents a key step in the regulatory process. It reflects the growing interest and potential regulatory acceptance of cryptocurrencies as mainstream financial assets. Public members have a 21-day window to submit their comments, starting from the date of publication in the Federal Register.\n\nSpot ETH ETF Could Protect Investors\n\nFidelity\u2019s filing highlights the gap in the U.S. market for regulated, exchange-traded crypto products. While investors in countries like Germany, Switzerland, and France can access Ether through exchange-traded products, the U.S. market has lagged in offering similar opportunities. According to Fidelity, the lack of a U.S.-regulated, exchange-traded Ether product leaves U.S. investors with limited and riskier options for gaining exposure to Ethereum.\n\nThe filing emphasizes the potential benefits of a spot ETH ETF for U.S. investors, particularly in risk management. Approval of such a product could mark a major advancement in protecting U.S. investors in the crypto asset space.\n\nThe SEC has been cautious in approving spot cryptocurrency ETFs for the U.S. market. Although the commission has greenlit ETFs tied to Bitcoin futures and, more recently, Ether futures, it has yet to approve a spot crypto ETF. Approval of Fidelity\u2019s Ethereum ETF represents a significant development in the cryptocurrency sector, potentially paving the way for broader acceptance and integration of crypto assets in mainstream finance.\n\nRead Also: Ethereum Discussions Spikes Amidst Spot ETF Filings, Is ETH Price Aiming Bulls?"

        "content": "A wallet allegedly belonging to Three Arrows Capital (3AC) co-founder Su Zhu has moved funds for the first time since his arrest months ago.\n\nEtherscan records displayed several incoming and outgoing ERC-20 token transactions to and from an address labeled suzhu.eth on Nov. 29.\n\nOne outgoing transaction involved 3.75 million Gearbox (GEAR) tokens worth under $30,000. Suzhu.eth moved those funds into a decentralized exchange called CoW Protocol just minutes after it received those same tokens.\n\nIn another outgoing transaction, suzhu.eth moved 1 billion of an ERC-20 token named SUZHU into Uniswap V2. Though the SUZHU token has zero value based on Etherscan data, Uniswap data reported $6,274 in volume for the ETH-SUZHU pair over the 24-hour period ending at 11:00 PM UTC on Nov. 29.\n\nSeveral other incoming transactions also originated largely but not entirely from Uniswap. Unlike the outgoing transactions, those incoming transactions would not have required authorized access to Su Zhu\u2019s wallet.\n\nNo other outgoing funds since arrest\n\nUntil now, the most recent outgoing transactions involving Su Zhu\u2019s wallet took place on or before Sept. 21, days prior to his arrest on Sept. 29 in Singapore.\n\nAt that time, Su Zhu was sentenced to four months in prison. It does not appear that Su Zhu has been convicted of any crime. Instead, Three Arrows Capital\u2019s liquidator, Teneo, reportedly obtained a committal order after Su Zhu failed to cooperate, allowing police to arrest and imprison the executive.\n\nUncertainty around Su Zhu\u2019s current situation means that it is unclear whether the transactions are suspicious. It is possible that Su Zhu is no longer in prison, has internet access in prison, has permitted another individual to access his wallet, or has surrendered control of the wallet following his arrest. He may also have arranged for DeFi platforms to automatically access his wallet.\n\nThough it does not seem that Su Zhu has admitted to owning the wallet, data from Arkham Intelligence indicates that the wallet belongs to Su Zhu."

But a closer look at the daily chart shows that a potential correction might ensue, especially if Ether is influenced by Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nEthereum price prediction thesis and short-term bias\n\nAccording to Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) analysts, Bitcoin spot ETF is likely to be approved in January 2024. This development has caused FOMO among market participants, making the overall market outlook resoundingly bullish. Interestingly, this is one of the main drivers of the 2023 bull rally.\n\nRead more: Week Ahead: Bitcoin\u2019s bull trend in question as spot ETF momentum fades\n\nBut as the holiday season begins to kick in, liquidity in the market will diminish. Hence, cryptocurrency prices are likely to face manipulation. Additionally, Bitcoin price has already started to slow down its rally and has flashed multiple sell signals.\n\nIf Bitcoin price faces a minor correction, altcoins will shed double digits easily due to the nature of the connection between the two. Likewise, the Ethereum price will also see a correction to key support levels.\n\nRead more: Bitcoin Weekly Forecast: ETF delay and weekly swing failure could crash BTC to $30,000\n\nThis top-down Ethereum price analysis takes a look at ETH from weekly and daily time frames and forecasts buy-the-dip levels.\n\nEthereum price at critical levels on the weekly chart\n\nEthereum price has been in a multi-month consolidative trend that has produced an ascending triangle setup. While the technical formation is inherently bullish, it is only after a successful breakout. So far, ETH has not produced any discernible breakouts, just failed attempts.\n\nThe ascending triangle setup contains equal highs and higher lows, connected via trend lines. This setup shows that investors are becoming increasingly bullish and buying dips at an increasing rate.\n\nA breakout above the $2,000 psychological level was the first sign of a bullish move, but there has been a lot of back-and-forth around this level. To be precise, ETH is hovering between the second quarter high at $2,141 and weekly support at $1,933. This has been happening for the fourth consecutive week.\n\nWith Bitcoin\u2019s trend weakening and signaling a potential double-digit correction, Ethereum price might also catalyze a downside move to flush early longs. In such a case, ETH might eye a retest of the monthly open at $1,814 and a sweep of the monthly low at $1,782. This move would constitute a 9% to 12% move.\n\nETH/USDT 1-week chart\n\nETH bulls likely to take a backseat soon\n\nThe daily chart for Ethereum price shows more nuanced key levels, some of which coincide with the ones seen on the weekly.\n\nFor starters, this week\u2019s Monday range extends from $2,071 to $1,985. While the Monday high was swept on November 28, investors can expect a sweep of the Monday low in the coming days.\n\nA quick move to the downside with the intention of sweeping Monday\u2019s range could lead to a steep correction, especially if it is backed by BTC bears. In that case, investors need to take a look at the 40% Ethereum price rally witnessed between October 12 and November 10. This upswing created a local top at $2,138, and the midpoint of this move rests at $1,829, which coincides closely with the monthly open at $1,814 and monthly close of $1,782.\n\nAll in all, the $1,750 to $1,850 range seems like a good place to buy the dip if it ever comes to that.\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nWhile the short-term bearish or correction outlook is logical, it is completely contingent on Bitcoin\u2019s sell signals. If BTC lures shorts via a minor correction and proceeds to blast through $40,000, it would obliterate short sellers and cause a massive liquidation event that could sustain a move beyond $40,000.\n\nIn such a case, Ethereum price could overcome the $2,232 hurdle and eye a retest of the weekly resistance level at $2,521."

Despite the permissionless nature of Goerli staking, the departure of validators from client and testing teams, who constitute a significant stake majority, poses potential stability challenges. Concurrently, teams plan to leverage this transition to test delayed finality, inactivity leaks, and mass-slashings.\n\nWhile Goerli is likely to be the first testnet to activate the Dencun upgrade, the Ethereum team will announce the specific date very soon.\n\nGoerli, embodying the collaborative ethos of the Ethereum community, was initiated and maintained by a diverse group of individuals solving technical challenges and inadvertently building a thriving community.\n\nWhat Shall Developers and Stakers Do?\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation encourages developers to turn to Sepolia for testing decentralized applications, smart contracts, and other Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) functionalities. Sepolia\u2019s permissioned validator set ensures a stable testing environment. Alternatively, various local development environments facilitate testing against Ethereum mainnet state copies.\n\nStakers and infrastructure providers with a focus on protocol-level testing can further explore the recently launched Holesky testnet, where anyone can run a validator. For validator setup testing, the Ephemery testnet offers a weekly reset feature, enabling lightweight end-to-end testing of the validator lifecycle.\n\nThe Ethereum blockchain network has come a long way through several upgrades over the years. The forthcoming series of ETH upgrades will primarily focus on enhancing scalability.\n\nDanksharding stands out as the imminent significant Ethereum upgrade, leveraging distributed data sampling to augment the scalability of the Ethereum network. This advancement is crucial for boosting scalability and concurrently fostering decentralization by effectively managing extensive datasets generated by layer2 rollups.\n\nThe initial phase, known as Proto-danksharding or EIP-4844, will precede the complete implementation of danksharding. Additionally, Proto-danksharding introduces temporary data blobs, ensuring their seamless transmission. The comprehensive integration of danksharding is anticipated to be finalized by early 2024.\n\nAt press time, the ETH price is trading 3% up closer to $2,100 as the SEC considers reviewing Fidelity\u2019s spot Ethereum ETF."

        "content": "As the layer-1 blockchain Ethereum continues to grow and evolve, layer-2 blockchains like Optimism are working to alleviate issues of scaling, speed and costs.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been working on the same thing since 2017,\u201d Jing Wang, Optimism\u2019s CEO and co-founder, said on TechCrunch\u2019s Chain Reaction podcast. \u201cWe\u2019ve all been trying to solve the same problem for a long time.\u201d\n\nThe mission to scale Ethereum is ongoing, said Ryan Wyatt, chief growth officer at Optimism. Before joining Optimism, Wyatt was the president of Polygon Labs, the entity building the layer-2 blockchain Polygon.\n\nAs it stands, using and transacting with Ethereum is still relatively clunky, slow and more expensive. That\u2019s why layer-2 (L2) blockchains like Optimism exist: to focus on scaling and speed, while also lowering costs for users. It helps users interact with Ethereum\u2019s chain for about 10x cheaper through its own network and also provides developers the ability to build decentralized applications (dApps) in a faster, scalable way.\n\n\u201cJust as Amazon is a serverless back end for web2 applications, Optimism is a decentralized serverless back end for web3 applications,\u201d Wang said. \u201cWe wanted to scale Ethereum because I think Ethereum stays the most close to the original decentralization values and we wanted to give it a go staying close to those same values.\u201d\n\nBut with scaling also comes the importance of growth. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of facets to it, and I think one missing piece is how we continue to work with developers across the ecosystem,\u201d even if they\u2019re not a part of the Optimism family, Wyatt said.\n\nUsually when you think of scaling, you think of hiring big teams. But although Optimism wants to grow bigger, the ecosystem has to self-govern, and the best way to do that is to have developers across the space contribute.\n\nOptimism wants developers to build dApps using its technology, therefore pushing users to the network. \u201cThere\u2019s a ton of similarities to blockchain infrastructure in the developer ecosystem,\u201d Wyatt said. \u201cFor me, it seems incredibly similar.\u201d\n\nFor some, blockchains are like religious ecosystems, where there\u2019s only one way or the highway. \u201cIt\u2019s one chain versus the second chain,\u201d Wang said. \u201cOptimism\u2019s Superchain vision is trying to get us closer to a world where the chains are closer to containers for compute \u2026 and all these chains interoperate together in what we call the Superchain.\u201d\n\nThe goal is to help users forget which chain developers are building on, because it ultimately won\u2019t matter. \u201cIdeally in the future, there\u2019s applications that are so massive that they\u2019re probably running 100 concurrent chains. But for now, the amount of demand within the industry doesn\u2019t necessitate that, so we have something that looks closer to one application per chain.\u201d\n\nBut when it comes to success stories, it \u201cshould really be about the developers that are building on top of this infrastructure,\u201d Wyatt said. \u201cSo the day that we get away from talking about L2s, I think is going to be a big day because now the story will be about the great apps and experiences that are being built on top of the infrastructure.\u201d\n\nThis story was inspired by an episode of TechCrunch\u2019s podcast Chain Reaction.

        "title": "Ethereum Price Prediction: Crypto Analysts Reveal Catalyst That Will Drive Price Above $3,500 - NewsBTC",
        "content": "A crypto analyst has singled out an event that could be the spark that Ethereum needs to hit the price level of $3,500. He believes that the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap is going to make this run after Bitcoin \u201cgets its shine.\u201d\n\nHow Ethereum Will Hit $3,500\n\nIn a post shared on his X (formerly Twitter) platform, the CEO and founder of MN Trading, Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe, alluded to the Ethereum Spot ETF filing by Fidelity in his price prediction of $3,500. The crypto analyst seemed to be suggesting that approval of an Ethereum Spot ETF could propel Ethereum\u2019s price to such heights.\n\nHis reference to Bitcoin also confirms that this might indeed be van de Poppe\u2019s \u201cthesis.\u201d He spoke about Ethereum \u201crunning to $3,500 in Q1 2024\u201d after Bitcoin has had its shine. The \u201cshine\u201d likely refers to the possible approval of a Spot Bitcoin ETF. Some analysts have predicted that there is a 90% chance that a Spot Bitcoin ETF will be approved by January 10, 2024.\n\nWith this in mind, the crypto analyst possibly believes that approval of an Ethereum Spot ETF could come not long after once the Spot Bitcoin ETF is approved. If that happens, it could spark a massive rally in Ethereum\u2019s price. That could explain why Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe is predicting Ethereum to run to $3,500.\n\nSeveral asset managers have already applied with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to offer an Ethereum Spot ETF. However, all eyes seem to be on the SEC\u2019s decision on the pending Spot Bitcoin ETF applications. This could simply be because a final decision is expected on the pending Spot Bitcoin ETF applications, unlike Ethereum\u2019s, which still have a longer review process.\n\nETH price steadies above $2,000 | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nEthereum Spot ETFs May Not Get The Same Reception\n\nHistorically speaking, there is reason to believe that Ethereum Spot ETFs might not enjoy the same reception that Spot Bitcoin ETFs have gotten so far. This is based on the fact that there was a stark comparison in the numbers when the futures ETF of both crypto tokens launched.\n\nBitcoin futures ETFs were already in place as of 2021, with ProShares Bitcoin Strategy (BITO) ETF being the first to launch. Meanwhile, Ethereum futures ETFs just launched this year. What is most interesting is the trading volume that BITO saw on its launch date in comparison to all Ethereum futures ETFs on their launch date.\n\nBITO is reported to have seen more than $1 billion in trading volume in the first two days of launching. On the other hand, the total trading volume for Ether ETFs on their launch day amounted to just under $2 million.\n\nFeatured image from Tron Weekly, chart from Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

The trend remains to be upward, while the resistance [around $38,100] has been tested several times now. A breakout is very likely to occur.\u201d\n\nThe trader says Bitcoin may experience temporary dips in the near-term, but predicts an overall uptrend ahead of a possible decision by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to approve a spot market Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\n\u201cDips are still relatively short-lived as the markets are heating up for more momentum towards the spot Bitcoin ETF approval.

        "content": "The world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency Ether (ETH) is showing strong moves with its price regaining $2,1000 levels once again. The bullishness comes as the US SEC opens up discussions for the spot Ethereum ETF approval.\n\nAt press time, ETH price is trading 2.9% up at a price of $2,099 with a market cap of $252 billion.\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum Price Can Rally to $3,500\n\nCrypto analyst Michael van de Poppe has expressed his bullishness for Ethereum over the Fidelity filing. In light of this filing, he asserts his belief that following Bitcoin\u2019s surge, Ethereum is poised to reach $3,500 in the first quarter of 2024. As reported by CoinGape, Ethereum also holds the probability to hit a new all-time high in 2024.\n\nAs reported last week, the Ethereum whale accumulation has been going on pretty strongly. Additionally, on-chain data shows the major exchange of wallet holdings. According to Santiment, the largest Ethereum wallets are exhibiting a positive pattern, indicating a significant shift.\n\nExchange wallets have dropped to their lowest in the past six months, standing at 8.03 million ETH, while non-exchange wallets have surged to an all-time high of 41.03 million ETH. This trend suggests a growing preference for self-custody, as more coins are transitioning away from exchanges.\n\nETH Price Volatility and Action Ahead\n\nIn November, ETH\u2019s price surged by 13%, outpacing Bitcoin\u2019s 8%. A significant factor contributing to Ethereum\u2019s growth was Blackrock\u2019s official filing for a spot ETH ETF (Ethereum-based Exchange Traded Fund).\n\nNevertheless, with the diminishing media hype around ETFs, on-chain data reveals that Ethereum\u2019s price volatility has surpassed that of Bitcoin. This trend might entice swing traders and short-term day traders to allocate more investments in ETH than BTC in December as well.\n\nAs per IntoTheBlock, ETH\u2019s 30-day Average Intra-Day Volatility has currently exceeded that of Bitcoin. The provided chart illustrates Ethereum\u2019s Average Volatility score at 0.45%, surpassing Bitcoin\u2019s score of 0.32%.\n\nDuring a significant portion of November, the Ethereum price experienced lateral movement, oscillating between $2133 and $1917. Repeated testing of these horizontal levels twice each indicated a sense of uncertainty among market participants.\n\nDuring the recent two weeks of consolidation, the Ethereum price faced two setbacks from the $2133 resistance, revealing considerable overhead supply. These reversals have underscored the formation of a bullish reversal pattern recognized as a Double Bottom on the daily timeframe chart. The question remains whether the ETH price will hit $3,000 before the end of 2023."

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nEthereum's market dynamics are often a tale of large players whose trades can signal shifts in market sentiment. Recently, a whale transaction caught the eye of many, as 3,150 ETH, valued at approximately $6.37 million, were sold at an average price of around $2,023, netting a substantial profit from an earlier purchase of 2,762 ETH at $1,825 each. This move has prompted discussion among traders: is it time to take profits on Ethereum?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Ethereum chart reveals a critical juncture in price action. After a period of bullish momentum, Ethereum is now testing local resistance levels, creating a moment of decision for investors. The current resistance, formed near the $2,050 mark, is a crucial threshold that has previously prompted sell-offs, suggesting that traders are eyeing this level to secure gains.\n\nConversely, the support levels paint a picture of potential bounce-back zones. The first significant support is visible near the $1,950 level, aligning with the 50-day moving average. This moving average has historically acted as a dynamic support, propelling prices upward upon contact. A break below this, however, could see Ethereum's price target the next support at approximately $1,850, where previous demand coalesced to halt bearish runs.\n\nThe probability of a price reversal hinges on the market's reaction to these critical technical levels. A convincing break above the current resistance could invalidate the bearish thesis, potentially leading to a continuation of the upward trend. However, recent whale activity suggests that some large holders are starting to realize profits, potentially adding to the selling pressure at this price threshold.\n\nVolume trends also provide insight, with a notable decrease in trading volume suggesting that the current price level may be unsustainable in the short term. Combined with the whale's cashout, it could signal a broader sentiment shift among investors, leading to increased volatility and a possible price correction."

According to Pal, the use of Solana comes with a whole different feel that makes it a top contender as a relatively more user-friendly option.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe said once someone starts using Solana, it \"feels super fast, slick, inviting and easy for the user.\" The accolade on Solana underscores the general perception most industry leaders have of the top coin, especially as it has been able to pull off a major comeback in its price action post-FTX implosion.\n\nOnce you play around in the $SOL ecosystem, it feels super fast, slick, inviting and easy for the user.\n\n\n\nThe best comparison is SOL is Apple and ETH is Android.\n\n\n\nBoth win. Huge. \u2014 Raoul Pal (@RaoulGMI) November 29, 2023\n\nRaoul Pal is known for his commentary in the industry with a basis rooted deep in on-chain analytics; however, choosing to comment on the combat between Ethereum and Solana on pure fundamentals is considered a rare move.\n\nIn his analysis, Pal compares Ethereum to the Apple of the blockchain world while he considers Ethereum to be the Android. The connotations are clear as Solana wins the fight for performance based on its speed, while Ethereum's massive hoard of hosted decentralized applications (dApps) makes its Android comparison a well-suited description.\n\nSolana and Ethereum have thriving ecosystems\n\nAlmost everything Ethereum can do, Solana can do as well. It appears that Raoul Pal has broad use of some of Solana's applications, as he attested to the ingenious designs of Phantom Wallet, the most popular unhosted Solana wallet. This he confirmed when an X user asked to know what his feedback is for Phantom Wallet and in his response, he said:\n\nAbsolutely love it. Super easy.\n\nSolana has impressed its holders in a remarkable way, with Raoul Pal confirming he has been bullish all year. The coin soared to its 2023 high earlier this month as it wiggles away from the impacts of the continuous sell-off from FTX, the bankrupt exchange that sought ways to free up funds to pay its investors and creditors."

        "title": "The Fabricant's Fifth Anniversary: Ethereum, Revamped Collection, AI and More - WWD",
        "content": "For its fifth anniversary, The Fabricant makes no bones about its visions of grandeur. In addition to celebrating the occasion with a revamped Deep collection, with artificial intelligence reimagining one of its earliest offerings, it is expanding the digital fashion platform with new integrations.\n\nThese moves matter, executives told WWD in an exclusive interview, because they represent the company\u2019s next step in its evolution \u2014 and its ambitions to advance virtual fashion as a whole. The plan, they said, was to finally turn digital fashion into a mainstream movement.\n\nThe work has already begun. It starts with opening up availability for virtual fashion. For Kerry Murphy, cofounder and chief executive officer, and chief technology officer Marco Marchesi, that translates to expanding The Fabricant\u2019s platform to Ethereum, one of the crypto world\u2019s top decentralized blockchain networks, as a way to become a multichain platform. Meanwhile, it is also integrating with Crossmint, which builds tools that make it easier for businesses to build NFTs at scale.\n\nMetaverse skeptics could criticize moves like this, given the tech\u2019s downturn as a cultural phenomenon. But blockchain evangelists beg to differ, and corporate America as well as global brands seem to agree. Not only have fashion brands continued to invest in virtual technology and metaverse initiatives, but Crossmint \u2014 a popular NFT partner for some of the world\u2019s most recognizable companies \u2014 recently inked another notable deal with Coinbase.\n\nThe original \u201cCopyCopyCopy\u201d look from the 2018 collection. Courtesy image\n\nIn an August social media share, the company announced that \u201cthe world\u2019s coming on-chain. @coinbase is integrating @crossmint to help Coca-Cola, Atari, and other major companies onboard the world to Web3.\u201d That follows the June launch of its NFT \u201cwallet-as-a-service\u201d to help companies put simplified, interoperable blockchain technologies into their existing products. The same month, rapper Snoop Dogg released a \u201cdynamic\u201d NFT collection, which evolves alongside his tour. He used Crossmint, which can work with fiat currency, as the NFT payment processor.\n\n\u201cCrossmint is the perfect partner to really remove the friction between payments and experience that you get with NFTs,\u201d said Marchesi. \u201cThat\u2019s the name of the company itself, \u2018Crossmint,\u2019 so they really don\u2019t care anymore what currency you\u2019re using at other servers. And that\u2019s what we need for our community, for our users.\u201d\n\nWith the Ethereum play, The Fabricant\u2019s digital fashions \u2014 its own or those of its brand partners \u2014 are poised to become more available to a greater number of consumers.\n\nLinking to Ethereum is something of a homecoming for the company. \u201cWe sold the world\u2019s first digital fashion couture NFT on Ethereum, back in 2019,\u201d explained Murphy, referring to a high-profile collaboration between The Fabricant and artist Johanna Jaskowska, CryptoKitties and Dapper Labs that resulted in a digital blockchain dress called \u201cIridescence.\u201d The NFT was hailed as the world\u2019s first virtual-only haute couture dress and sold for close to $10,000.\n\nThe project was more about making a statement about digital fashion, said the CEO, and at the time, it prompted the press to wonder why anybody would pay such a high price for clothing that didn\u2019t actually exist. But soon enough, COVID-19 changed the equation, with people living more of their lives online amid widespread lockdowns. \u201cWe became one of the most relevant companies in the fashion industry, and we had all the physical fashion brands calling us up asking, \u2018What is this digital fashion about?\u2019\u201d he added.\n\nAs he reflected on his company\u2019s five-year journey, it\u2019s clear that it was quite a whirlwind studded with major figures in gaming, from establishment giant Atari to Web3 hit Star Atlas, and notable names in fashion spanning Rtfkt, the digital sneaker start-up-turned-Nike business, to Virgil Abloh. The Fabricant has been at the heart of millions of dollars in NFT transactions and other investments and not just for partners. In 2021, it scored $14 million in series A funding, which was perhaps fortunate timing. The following year saw a cryptomarket crash that took the shine off of cryptocurrencies and, to some degree, NFTs.\n\nMurphy was quick to note that The Fabricant is not a crypto company, but it does work with the same underlying blockchain technology, so it felt the ripples. \u201c[We] had to really detach ourselves from the narrative of crypto NFT and metaverse, and really focus on digital fashion,\u201d he said, describing it as a highly successful shift.\n\nNow the company is ready to move forward and, once again, timing may be on its side, given recent advancements in artificial intelligence, brands\u2019 growing digital sophistication and greater consumer understanding of virtual experiences. Case in point: The revamped version of Amber Jae Slooten\u2019s Deep collection, as reimagined using generative AI. The original was never available \u201con chain\u201d before, but the collection totaling seven items will drop on Dec. 14 as part of The Fabricant\u2019s Ethereum expansion.\n\n\u201cMachine\u201d from the 2018 Deep collection. Courtesy image\n\n\u201cMachine\u201d as reimagined by AI in the 2023 Deep collection. Courtesy image\n\nAs for the future, Marchesi pointed to new experiences in development, such as augmented reality dressing. It remains a holy grail in digital fashion, and The Fabricant partnered with Snap Inc. to enable it and, by doing so, it joined myriad players from Google to DressX pursuing the same thing. The key is to not let the technology or complexity get in the way. The CTO sees it as \u201cpart of our vision, [which] is about, everyone should be able to wear digital fashion in any context with any device.\u201d The Fabricant quietly launched AR try-on as a beta feature of its platform, as it has been a work in progress, but it\u2019s ready to call more attention to it now.\n\nAnother area of interest is using virtual fashion and realistic AI models for photo shoots. The company wouldn\u2019t disclose details on that on the record, but it is actively exploring this.\n\nThere\u2019s more happening on the fashion front, including some sort of upcoming collaboration with a notable luxury brand, though neither Murphy nor Marchesi could offer details at press time. But coming on the heels of this slew of updates, exploratory projects and efforts in development, it\u2019s unlikely to be a rank-and-file debut.\n\nWhether any of it succeeds in drawing mainstream interest remains to be seen. But one thing seems quite clear \u2014 The Fabricant\u2019s swirl of activity in the last five years might be nothing compared to what the next five brings."

        "content": "Research from the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance (CCAF) and the Ethereum Climate Platform (ECP) reveals that the Merge \u2013 the upgrade that switched the ETH consensus mechanism from a proof-of-work protocol to a proof-of-stake system \u2013 ensured that Ethereum now has a much lighter greenhouse gas footprint than other high carbon-emitting blockchains.\n\nThis research, announced at COP28 at two events, reveal that Ethereum has historically created 27.5 million metric tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents (MtCO2e), highlighting the impact of crypto asset technology on sustainability and how technology can be used to help countries access funding for their Nationally Determined Contributions.\n\nA nationally determined contribution (NDC) or intended nationally determined contribution (INDC) is a non-binding national plan highlighting climate change mitigation, including climate-related targets for greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions.\n\nThe ECP, founded by Allinfra and Consensys, also recently welcomed Earthshot prize winner Boomitra as a new partner committed to mitigating one million tonnes of CO\u2082, which was a first step in addressing the historical carbon footprint of Ethereum. Over the next few years, the ECP will be facilitating investment to address this historical footprint and leveraging its digital toolset and vast network of carbon market experts and corporations.\n\nAnna Lerner, executive director of the ECP said: \u201cThis trailblazing research gives us all a wake-up call when it comes to demonstrating how to decarbonise a vastly impactful technology - and how we can put it to work for climate finance. We started the ECP to counteract the historical emissions of Ethereum and now, we have a valid, specific quantitative figure to work with. We call on every business using blockchain to take accountability, commit to using more sustainable methods, and redress the carbon emissions that they have created.\u201d\n\nBill Kentrup, co-founder and head of origination at Allinfra, added: \u201cThese findings mark a significant step forward and allow us to comprehend the magnitude of positive impact achieved through the near-complete decarbonisation of the Ethereum ecosystem. It is a source of inspiration for both the team here at Allinfra and the ECP where we are working to engage in climate mitigation together. We implore others in the global technology and business community to join the fight against the climate crisis by incentivising the financing of real-world, verifiably green projects.\u201d\n\nSteven Haft, head of global partnerships and climate lead, Consensys, continued: \u201cEthereum is the second biggest blockchain in the world by far; Proof of Stake Ethereum, \u2018greened Eth\u2019 and Web3 technology present an irresistible combination for attracting investible climate projects. This is why the Ethereum Climate Platform was formed and is committed to addressing the historical carbon footprint of Ethereum. We welcome the research and will use its peer-reviewed findings as the base of our carbon pledge.\u201d"

Taking to its official X account, the Starknet Foundation said it is making plans to distribute its native token, \"STRK\" to some of its community members on the condition that they must have contributed at one point or the other to its overall development.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile the Starknet Foundation announcement resounded through the community, it had to sound a note of warning to enable community members to manage their expectations the right way. The outfit said tech teams typically develop a lot of products, many of which may not see the light of day - its way of insinuating that there is a small margin of probability that the STRK token may not be launched.\n\nWe have seen that a preview of an iteration of a possible provisions portal has been shared on social media.

Airdrops from Blur, Arbitrum and Optimism are among the biggest the industry has seen in recent times.\n\nWhile the Starknet airdrops frenzy is relatively new to the broader community, the most anticipated for now is that of XRP Ledger (XRPL)-based L2, Evernode (EVERS). Per recent statistics shared by the protocol earlier today, there are lots of community members vying to get their own share of EVERS as the protocol sets a legacy as one of the pioneering L2 protocols on XRPL."

        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction: Ethereum (ETH) price stayed relatively unchanged on Thursday despite the trading volume dropping by 20% to $8.5 billion. Intriguingly, the altcoin\u2019s market cap is holding up above $245 billion, according to market data by CoinMarketCap.\n\nThis has been a week of consolidation with Ethereum price sitting above the $2,000 level. Recovery has become an uphill battle leaving Ether to wobble between support at $2,020 and a short-term resistance at $2,070.\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum Price Prediction: How Far Is Ethereum From Breakout?\n\nThe Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator upholds the mundane sideways trading Ethereum has displayed since Monday. Its downside is protected by the 100 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) (blue) at $2,020 and the ascending trendline.\n\nEthereum price tends to react bullishly every time it has retraced to touch the trendline. Therefore, in case of dips towards the $2,000 mark, bulls could seize the opportunity to buy into ETH while speculating on the next breakout first to $2,200, and later to the subsequent levels at $2,500 and $3,000.\n\nTraders should exercise caution and restraint as long as Ethereum is trading below the short-term resistance at $2,040, as highlighted by the 50 EMA (red). The action above this level and the next resistance between $2,058 and $2,070 would serve as a breakout signal, paving the way for a bigger move to $2,200.\n\nThe momentum indicator will confirm the uptrend\u2019s continuation with the blue MACD line flipping above the red signal line.\n\nA triangle pattern forming on the four-hour chart could nurture a bigger breakout towards $3,000 if validated. Bulls must focus on breaking above resistance at $2,120 to activate the triangle breakout. Most traders would consider going long on Ethereum slightly above the triangle.\n\nRecommended for you: Dogecoin Price Could Blast Through $0.12 Resistance If This Technical Pattern Plays Out\n\nA glimpse of the daily chart assures traders of support at $2,015 but based on the current technical, as depicted by the sell signal from the MACD, ETH might drop again before making another significant recovery attempt.\n\nHowever, backing the bullish outlook in ETH is the position of all three moving averages; the 50-day EMA, the 100-day EMA, and the 200-day EMA. If the MAs uphold the ongoing uptrend, the path with the least resistance is likely to stick to the upside.\n\nEthereum DeFi TVL Shoots To $26 Billion\n\nThe dollar value of all ETH locked in staking protocols and other decentralized finance (DeFi) networks is increasing rapidly. According to data by Defi Llama, the total value locked (TVL) currently stands at $26 billion from approximately $19.4 billion in mid-October.\n\nThe growth in TVL underscores the long-term bullish outlook investors have for Ethereum price. They are willing to lock up their Ether for longer periods, expecting that the uptrend will continue into 2023. A high TVL value significantly reduces the selling pressure.\n\nRelated Articles"

Discover SCENE\n\nThe gaming NFT marketplace Aqua is no more, CEO Sean Ryan announced on Linkedin Friday. The plan was first shared last month, but as of today, it's official.\n\n\u201cAt Aqua, we did some things well and some things not as well, but the Web3 gaming market isn't scaling to a mass market size in a time frame that made sense,\u201d Ryan wrote. \u201cTherefore, it was time to call it a day and move on to other opportunities, especially for our awesome employees.\u201d\n\n\u201cI'm still a firm believer in the idea that gamers will own their gaming assets, but it's going to take a bit longer [than] we had all hoped,\u201d the CEO added.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRyan, who previously worked as a VP at Facebook, launched Aqua in 2022 and partnered with blockchain firms like Immutable and Polygon Labs. Now, after less than two years, the \u201cplayer-focused\u201d NFT gaming startup has closed its doors.\n\nhttps://t.co/GOdYHhqYNu will be ceasing operations as of December 1, 2023. For players with an AQUA Wallet, please follow the instructions in the link below to transfer your funds into a different wallet, or reach out to support@aqua.xyz for assistance.https://t.co/VMZ07tzcUJ pic.twitter.com/CGn6AgRrgS \u2014 AQUA.xyz (@aquadotxyz) November 17, 2023\n\nIn a graphic attached to the post, Ryan also shared that the startup struggled to raise funds in a broader crypto gaming market with \u201cslower-than-expected growth.\u201d\n\n\"I'm a strong believer in the category, but sometimes one is just too early,\" Ryan told Decrypt's GG when reached on Friday.\n\nAqua aimed to offer a gaming NFT marketplace as well as more white-glove, embedded marketplace solutions for game developers. The marketplace supported NFTs on Ethereum, as well as scaling networks Polygon and Immutable X.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEarlier this year, Ryan told Decrypt in an interview that Aqua was designed for true gamers\u2014not \u201cdegen\u201d crypto traders looking to make money by flipping gaming NFTs for profit.\n\nAnd from his conversations with over 50 different blockchain game developers, Ryan found that devs overwhelmingly wanted a seamless game marketplace that doesn\u2019t pull gamers out to a third-party website.\n\nSuch has been said again recently by Aqua\u2019s competitors at Sequence, which just launched its own tool for devs to make their own in-game marketplaces.\n\nFor better or worse, there\u2019s now tons of competition in the gaming NFT marketplace space. Gaming key retailer G2A recently took its leap into NFT sales, OpenSea has revamped its gaming offerings and content (but has laid off staff), and Magic Eden has also emphasized gaming as a core focus going forward.\n\nBut Aqua isn\u2019t the only gaming NFT platform that\u2019s pulled back this year. In August, GameStop announced it was killing its NFT wallet, citing \u201cregulatory uncertainty.\u201d\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

        "content": "Fri 01 Dec 2023 \u25aa 4 min of reading \u25aa by Fenelon L.\n\nAs Solana, the \u201cEthereum killer,\u201d is reborn after a tumultuous period, its spectacular progress against its historic rival reignites the debate: are we witnessing the beginnings of a paradigm shift in the crypto universe?\n\nSolana, the crypto tsunami sweeping towards Ethereum\n\nSolana (SOL) has recorded gains surpassing other major cryptocurrencies with a price increase of 7% on Wednesday morning. At the time of writing, SOL is trading at $60.16 each, representing a 24-hour rise of more than 7% (CoinGecko). Over 7 days, SOL has gained 10%.\n\nThis trend shows a resurgence for the Solana outsider. After a challenging year in 2022, marked by repeated outages and the FTX affair, the decentralized network seems to be attracting investors once again.\n\nSOL has had a phenomenal rally in November. The price of Ethereum\u2019s competitor surpassed $50 for the first time since May 2022, outperforming most cryptos in terms of performance. According to experts, this surge is due to a squeeze caused by the exit of short sellers and renewed institutional interest.\n\nHowever, a month later, Solana continues to rise. In the last 30 days, SOL has increased by more than 70%. Otherwise, the crypto market is relatively stagnant. Bitcoin and Ethereum have barely moved over 24 hours. The same goes for Dogecoin, Tron, and XRP. Only Avalanche (AVAX) is performing as well as SOL over 24 hours, at $20.87 (+80% in a month).\n\nRaoul Pal compares Ethereum and Solana\n\nThe famous crypto trader and investor, Raoul Pal, has recently provided a unique perspective on the comparison between Ethereum and Solana. He notes that the use of Solana is distinguished by a smoother, faster, and more user-friendly experience.\n\nRenowned for his sharp analyses based on the blockchain, his comments comparing the two networks on purely fundamental grounds are exceptional. In his detailed study, he likens Ethereum to Android, praising the vastness of its decentralized ecosystem, while Solana resembles Apple in its focus on user comfort.\n\nHis words summarize his opinion well: \u201cOnce in the Solana ecosystem, everything seems ultra-fast, smooth, engaging, and easy for the user. The best analogy is that SOL is Apple where ETH is Android. Both are winners. Huge.\u201d\n\nIn this novel analysis, Raoul Pal highlights Solana\u2019s ability to compete with Ethereum, and that\u2019s on almost all fronts. He especially praises the excellence of its Phantom wallet, highly prized by SOL holders.\n\nThe skeptical view: Ethereum remains the undisputed leader\n\nAlthough Solana wins on certain points, it is still far from rivalling Ethereum. Indeed, while it impresses with its technical performance, it cannot yet equal the richness of the Ethereum ecosystem nor its dominance in the dApp sector.\n\nFurthermore, Ethereum also boasts a crucial advantage: its credibility and reputation solidly established over the years in the crypto industry. Therefore, despite high fees and scalability limitations, it remains the reference point for institutional players.\n\nWill Solana ever manage to dethrone Ethereum? If it continues on its current trajectory, it\u2019s not impossible. However, the path is still long for this contender to the throne, which must above all consolidate investors\u2019 trust in the long term.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program!

The cryptocurrency market expects a bull market by 2025, and investors are trying to predict its price for the next 24 months.\n\nHowever, predicting volatile cryptocurrencies\u2019 prices poses a challenge, and analysts will often miss their targets. Long-term projections increase the risk of inaccuracy, so investors should regularly revise their estimates.\n\nDespite the challenges, Finbold turned to artificial intelligence (AI) tools and expert cryptocurrency traders to present a conservative Ethereum price prediction for late 2025. Meanwhile, ETH is trading at $2,050 per token by press time.\n\nChatGPT bearish, neutral, and bullish ETH price predictions\n\nTherefore, ChatGPT-4 was prompted to give three conservative Ethereum price predictions for Q4 2025. One with a bearish bias, a neutral prediction, and a bullish forecast for last.\n\n\u201cBearish Prediction: Assuming potential regulatory pressure and competition from other blockchain platforms, Ethereum\u2019s price could face downward pressure. A conservative bearish forecast for Q4 2025 might be $1,500. Neutral Prediction: Factoring in modest market growth and technological advancements within the Ethereum ecosystem, a neutral outlook could place Ethereum at $2,500 by Q4 2025. Bullish Prediction: With the anticipation of a cryptocurrency bull run spurred by Bitcoin\u2019s halving in 2024, and given Ethereum\u2019s historical correlation with Bitcoin\u2019s price action, a bullish but conservative estimate for Ethereum might be $3,500 in Q4 2025.\u201d \u2014 ChatGPT-4\n\nChatGPT-4: 3 conservative Ethereum price predictions for late 2025. Source: Finbold\n\nThe bearish prediction of $1,500 would mean 27% losses from current prices, while the bullish prediction would reward investors with 70% gains in two years. Curiously, ChatGPT also forecasts Ethereum to increase by 20%, even with the neutral prediction of $2,500.\n\nExperts forecast Ethereum price for 2024\n\nNotably, the AI predictions are aligned with Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe\u2019s forecast for 2024. The expert cryptocurrency trader targets $1,800-$1,900 in a retrace and $3,100-$3,600 after an 18-month trend breakout.\n\nPersonally, I'm expecting that $ETH will continue to rally.\n\n\n\nIf there's a dip towards the $1,800-1,900 region, that's an area to enter as Ethereum wants to break out of an 18-month range.\n\n\n\nAfter that, targets at $3,100-3,600. pic.twitter.com/4IYQxRTtX0 \u2014 Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) November 27, 2023\n\nA more aggressive price prediction for late 2025 sees Ethereum outperforming Bitcoin (BTC) with 2,000% gains. Stockmoney Lizard shared a chart pattern backed by fundamental analysis. Confidently, the crypto investor forecasts ETH to trade as high as $28,000 per token.\n\nThis is why #Ethereum will outperform #Bitcoin till the end of 2025.\n\n\n\nA thread by Stockmoney Lizazds\ud83e\udd8e pic.twitter.com/kpHrIc8zJa \u2014 Stockmoney Lizards (@StockmoneyL) November 26, 2023\n\nAI predicts Ethereum price in 2025\n\nIn the meantime, the CoinCodex machine-learning algorithm combines multiple technical analysis indicators. Interestingly, the AI predicts Ethereum will trade as low as $3,746 and as high as $7,511 per token during 2025.\n\nETH price prediction 2024 and 2024. Source: CoinCodex\n\nAll things considered, Ethereum\u2019s performance will depend on the demand for its native token. Positive developments in the Web3 ecosystem, adoption, regulatory pressure, tokenomics, and macro economics will highly influence the leading layer-1 blockchain price in the following years.

It was the first blockchain platform that allowed developers to build decentralized applications and smart contracts on top of its blockchain network. Ethereum\u2019s launch paved the way for the creation of many blockchain-based projects and decentralized applications that we see today.\n\n2. Introduction of Solidity\n\nSolidity is a contract-oriented programming language specifically designed to develop smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. It was introduced in 2015 and has become the most popular programming language for developing smart contracts on Ethereum. Solidity has made it easier for developers to build complex smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\n3. Development of ERC-20 Standard\n\nERC-20 is a technical standard used for creating and implementing tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. It was introduced in 2015 and has become the most widely adopted token standard on Ethereum. The ERC-20 standard has made it easier for developers to create their own tokens on Ethereum, leading to many new blockchain-based projects.\n\n4. Development of the Ethereum Virtual Machine\n\nThe Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is a decentralized runtime environment that executes smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. It was introduced in 2015 and has become an integral part of the Ethereum platform. The EVM has made it possible for developers to build complex decentralized applications and smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\n\u201cOptimistic rollup technology is just more mature, While ZK-Rollups are faster, one thing that ZK-Rollups lack is an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), making them hard to run decentralized applications like DeFi protocols.\u201d -Vitalik Buterin$ARB $100 @arbitrum pic.twitter.com/1gg9RWNvTY \u2014 Bugsy (\ud83d\udc99,\ud83e\udde1) (@EthereumMaxima2) April 4, 2023\n\n5. Introduction of Proof of Stake\n\nProof of Stake (PoS) is a consensus algorithm used by Ethereum to validate transactions and create new blocks on the blockchain. It was introduced in 2017 as an alternative to Proof of Work (PoW) algorithm used by Bitcoin. PoS has many advantages over PoW, including lower energy consumption, reduced centralization, and improved scalability.\n\n6. Introduction of the Ethereum Name Service\n\nThe Ethereum Name Service (ENS) is a decentralized domain name system that enables users to register human-readable names for Ethereum addresses. It was introduced in 2017 and has become an integral part of the Ethereum ecosystem. The ENS has made it easier for users to interact with the Ethereum blockchain by simplifying the process of sending and receiving Ethereum transactions.\n\n7. Development of the Raiden Network\n\nThe Raiden Network is a layer-two scaling solution for the Ethereum blockchain. It was introduced in 2017 and has become an important development for the Ethereum ecosystem. The Raiden Network allows for fast, cheap, and scalable transactions on the Ethereum blockchain, which has made it easier for developers to build decentralized applications.\n\n8. Introduction of the Ethereum Improvement Proposal Process\n\nThe Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) process is a community-driven process that allows developers to propose improvements to the Ethereum platform. It was introduced in 2015 and has become an important part of the Ethereum ecosystem. The EIP process has made it possible for developers to contribute to the development of the Ethereum platform and has led to many important improvements to the platform.\n\n9. Development of the Ethereum 2.0 Upgrade\n\nThe Ethereum 2.0 upgrade, also known as Serenity, is a major milestone in the development of the Ethereum network. It aims to address some of the scalability and energy efficiency issues of the current Ethereum network while also improving security.\n\nOne of the key changes in Ethereum 2.0 is the introduction of a new consensus mechanism called Proof of Stake (PoS), which will replace the current Proof of Work (PoW) mechanism. PoS is a more energy-efficient consensus mechanism that does not require miners to perform complex mathematical calculations, as is the case with PoW. Instead, PoS relies on validators to verify transactions and add new blocks to the blockchain. Validators are required to stake a certain amount of Ether (ETH) as collateral, which is forfeited if they act maliciously.\n\nAnother important change in Ethereum 2.0 is the introduction of shard chains. The current Ethereum network operates as a single chain, which means that all nodes must process all transactions. This limits the scalability of the network and can lead to high gas fees during periods of high network activity. Shard chains, on the other hand, allow the network to be split into smaller chains, each of which can process transactions independently. This increases the network\u2019s capacity to process transactions, making it more scalable and reducing gas fees.\n\nEthereum 2.0 will also introduce a new virtual machine called eWASM (Ethereum WebAssembly), which is designed to improve the efficiency of smart contract execution. eWASM is a more efficient and flexible virtual machine than the current Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and will enable developers to write smart contracts in a wider range of programming languages.\n\nThe Ethereum 2.0 upgrade is being implemented in phases, with each phase introducing new features and improvements. The first phase, Phase 0, launched in December 2020 and introduced the Beacon Chain, the backbone of the Ethereum 2.0 network. The Beacon Chain coordinates the validators and shard chains and is responsible for managing the network\u2019s consensus.\n\nPhase 1 is expected to launch in 2021 and introduce shard chains, allowing the network to process more transactions. Phase 2 will introduce further improvements to the network, including the introduction of smart contract execution on shard chains.\n\nAlso, read \u2013 Top 5 Queries And Their Answers To Decentralized Domain Names\n\n10. Smart Contract Templates\n\nSmart contract templates are pre-built code templates that make it easier for developers to create smart contracts on the Ethereum network. These templates can be customized and modified to suit different use cases, reducing the amount of time and effort required to develop smart contracts.\n\nWhat makes ethereum special and what is its future?\n\nEthereum is a groundbreaking blockchain platform that has played a pivotal role in shaping the decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible token (NFT) ecosystems.

        "content": "Share this article URL Copied\n\nThe US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has acknowledged receipt of an application by asset management giant Fidelity to list a spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF), according to today\u2019s SEC filing.\n\nThe filing from Cboe BZX Exchange proposes listing and trading shares of the Fidelity Ethereum Fund, structured as a commodity-based trust that would hold ether. The trust aims to track the performance of the Fidelity Ethereum Index, less expenses and liabilities.\n\nHas been long known that Fidelity entered the spot ETF race but this filing *essentially* starts the ~240+ day clock for their spot #Ethereum ETF. Just another step in the process. Will have definitive deadline dates in the coming weeks https://t.co/0C6NKcxNNz pic.twitter.com/gdW9ZQDgs9 \u2014 James Seyffart (@JSeyff) November 30, 2023\n\nThe SEC has several Ethereum ETF applications under review that it must approve or deny, including filings by major financial firms BlackRock, ARK Invest, VanEck, Hashdex, Invesco, and Galaxy Digital Holdings.\n\nFidelity Digital Assets Services would serve as the regulated custodian for the trust\u2019s ETH holdings. The filing argues that the CME Ether futures market is of significant size for surveillance-sharing purposes to meet SEC listing standards that aim to prevent fraud and manipulation.\n\nThe SEC has yet to approve a spot Bitcoin or ETH ETF in the US. However, the agency is reportedly preparing to allow simultaneous listings of spot-based Bitcoin ETFs in January. The Fidelity filing aims to make the case that an ether spot ETF should also receive approval.\n\nThe proposal starts a 45-day clock for the SEC to approve, deny, or extend the deadline. The SEC is now seeking public comments on the proposed rule change to list the Fidelity Ethereum Fund ETF.\n\nETH is trading flat -0.1% over the last 24 hours, according to Coingecko."

        "content": "With Christmas on the horizon, astute investors redirect their focus to the cryptocurrency market to pursue opportunities that promise substantial returns. Among the notable cryptocurrencies, Ethereum (ETH) emerges as a top contender for holiday investments.\n\nWhy is this the case? ETH offers a distinctive combination of popularity and potential, making it particularly enticing during the festive season.\n\nGiven these dynamics, Finbold has leveraged PricePredictions for its AI advanced machine learning algorithms. These algorithms meticulously assess the ever-changing market conditions and analyze relevant indicators to estimate the likelihood of Ethereum experiencing gains by Christmas day.\n\nETH price prediction for December 25th. Source: PricePredictions\n\nThe algorithms project that ETH will increase to $2,040 by the end of the month, representing a 0.54% increase from the current asset price at the time of publication.\n\nThe computation is based on a broad range of technical indicators, encompassing moving average convergence divergence (MACD), relative strength index (RSI), Bollinger Bands (BB), and various others.\n\nEthereum price analysis\n\nThe Ethereum price has been undergoing a consolidative trend spanning several months, forming an ascending triangle setup. While this technical pattern is inherently bullish, confirmation only comes with a successful breakout. Up until now, ETH has yet to demonstrate any clear breakouts.\n\nThe ascending triangle configuration consists of highs that are equal and lows that are progressively higher, connected by trend lines. This arrangement indicates a growing bullish sentiment among investors, with an increasing tendency to buy dips.\n\nAt the time of press, ETH was trading at $2,031, representing a decrease of -1.44% in the previous 24 hours. These losses come after a week when this crypto lost 2.38% of its value, contrary to a 12.67% increase over the 30 days.\n\nETH 24-hours chart. Source: Finbold\n\nIn the last year, ETH price has increased by 61%, allowing it to outperform 69% of the top 100 crypto assets in this period.\n\nThis crypto trades above its 200-day simple moving average while experiencing 18 green days in the last 30 days.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nThe Ronin crypto wallet mobile app has added a Binance Pay integration that allows users to directly import funds from Binance exchange accounts to their wallets, Ronin developers announced Friday.\n\nThe new feature also means mobile users can automatically convert cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum into Ronin ecosystem tokens like AXS and SLP from Axie Infinity, according to the announcement. Ronin is an Ethereum sidechain network built for crypto games.\n\nThe Binance exchange itself does not currently list Ronin\u2019s main token, RON\u2014so users will have to buy it on a decentralized exchange (DEX). Binance does list SLP and AXS on its exchange for users in some countries, however.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAt time of writing, the Binance Pay integration is only available for the Ronin mobile app. A quick test of the Ronin wallet browser extension on Chrome in the U.S. only shows Ramp or Ronin\u2019s blockchain bridge as options to deposit funds.\n\nRonin Wallet x @binance Pay \u2694\ufe0f \u2022 Deposit from Binance via mobile Ronin wallet\n\n\u2022 Auto-convert BTC, ETH, and more into AXS, SLP, and USDC on Ronin\n\n\u2022 AMA on Spaces with the Binance Pay team next week (more details coming soon) Learn more here \ud83d\udc47 \ud83d\udcdc | https://t.co/qP8dKO9mh9 pic.twitter.com/xOaF5yNiJi \u2014 Ronin (@Ronin_Network) December 1, 2023\n\nRonin\u2019s partnership with Binance Pay comes less than two weeks after news broke that Binance CEO Changpeng \u201cCZ\u201d Zhao would plead guilty to money laundering charges and step down from his role at the exchange. Binance has already announced its new CEO, Richard Teng, and Binance users have withdrawn over $1 billion in funds from the exchange in the wake of its upheaval.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that Binance also won\u2019t be available for customers in the U.S. for much longer, so Ronin\u2019s Binance Pay integration comes primarily for the benefit of mobile users outside of the U.S.\n\nWhile Binance has seen users pull their funds, Ronin saw a surge in activity and tripled its active user numbers in early November. Interest in Pixels\u2014a browser-based MMORPG that recently migrated to the Ronin blockchain\u2014spiked last month.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhile Pixels has faced some challenges with bot users, the game saw nearly $2 million in total NFT land sales across 1,300 transactions and daily unique active wallets in the high five to low six figures, according to data from CryptoSlam, DappRadar, and Ronin co-founder Jeffrey \u201cJiho\u201d Zirlin.\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

The rumors seem unfounded and the XRP community has failed to present evidence supporting the claims.\n\nAlso read: LUNC ranks among trending tokens alongside Dollar pegged stablecoin USTC, eyes recovery\n\nCharles Hoskinson addresses rumors surrounding Ripple lawsuit\n\nCharles Hoskinson, the founder of Cardano is one of the co-founders of Ethereum. Hoskinson has been embroiled in a debate with the XRP community over alleged rumors of ConsenSys founder Joseph Lubin bribing the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to give Ethereum a \u201cfree pass\u201d and go after Ripple. Here free pass meant Ethereum was allowed to conduct business as usual while Ripple was hit by a lawsuit.\n\nIt is important to note that Hoskinson currently finds himself in a similar situation to Brad Garlinghouse, the CEO of Ripple, in 2020. The US SEC slammed Ripple with a lawsuit, alleging the unregistered sale of securities, here securities meaning XRP. The SEC has listed Cardano as an investment contract in its lawsuit against Kraken, a cryptocurrency exchange. It is therefore clear that the regulator considered Cardano an investment contract.\n\nHoskinson commented on the rumors stating that the XRP community needs to present evidence to back its claims, or else he finds it a \u201cgrand conspiracy.\u201d\n\nFor the argument that Joe bribed the SEC to go after XRP that is the conclusion. That is the entire point of calling it a grand conspiracy. The free pass has nothing to do with the case against Ripple. They are unrelated events. Two years now and you haven't provided any evidence\u2026 \u2014 Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) November 30, 2023\n\nJoseph Lubin is involved here as ConsenSys is software production studio that offers clients enterprise Ethereum solutions.

        "content": "Major cryptocurrencies experienced a surge on Thursday evening, driven by two significant developments, one involving Bitcoin and the other Ethereum.\n\nCryptocurrency Gains +/- Price (Recorded 9:30 p.m. EST) Bitcoin BTC/USD +0.63% $37,947 Ethereum ETH/USD +3.15% $2,089 Dogecoin DOGE/USD +0.32% $0.081\n\nWhat Happened: On the Bitcoin front, Michael Saylor owned Microstrategy Inc MSTR, the largest corporate holder of BTC purchased an additional 16,130 BTC, valued at approximately $608 million based on current prices.\n\nAccording to a regulatory filing on Thursday, Microstrategy acquired bitcoin for $593.3 million in cash, at an average price of around $36,785 per coin. With this purchase, the company now holds a total of 174,530 BTC, acquired at an average price of about $30,252 per coin.\n\nOn the Ethereum front, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has officially acknowledged Fidelity Investments\u2019 filing for a spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF). Fidelity had initially submitted their SEC application on November 17.\n\nTop Gainer (24 Hour)\n\nCryptocurrency Gains +/- Price (Recorded 9:30 p.m. EDT) Celestia +11.96. $6.16 Injective +8.81% $18.25 Render +8.18% $3.19\n\nThe global crypto market cap has reached $1.42 trillion, marking a 0.40% decrease in the last 24 hours.\n\nThe S&P 500 rose by 0.4% to reach 4,567.80, indicating a positive performance. However, the Nasdaq Composite experienced a slight dip of about 0.2% and stood at 14,226.22.\n\nData released on Thursday revealed that the personal consumption expenditures price index, considered the Federal Reserve\u2019s preferred measure of inflation, showed a 3.5% increase on a year-over-year basis. This indicates a slowdown compared to the previous month\u2019s 3.7% annual gain.\n\nMoreover, the 10-year Treasury yield, which had caused concern among investors when it exceeded 5% last month, has seen a decline this month due to the release of cooling inflation data. On Thursday, the 10-year yield ticked slightly higher, reaching 4.34%.\n\nSee More: Best Cryptocurrency Scanners\n\nAnalyst Notes: Eli Taranto, Executive Director at EQI Bank in a note seen by Benzinga said, \"As inflation data coming out of the US shows signs of cooling, BTC remains within the $37K corridor. Interestingly, as more and more industry giants look to tokenization we may see another market driver. JP Morgan and Citibank have both launched tokenization projects. Many industry trials are expected to either near completion or finish this year, with the next stage rollout likely to excite markets.\"\n\nHe added, \"We may see another market driver begin to emerge, as tokenization begins to take center stage in the digital asset space. Two weeks ago, the Bank of Singapore, and the Bank of Korea started CBDC trials that include tokenization of bank assets.\"\n\nCryptocurrency analyst Michael Van de Poppe said that the Fidelity filing for an Ethereum Spot ETF supports his thesis. He predicts that, following Bitcoin\u2019s rise, Ethereum will surge to $3,500 in Q1 2024.\n\nAccording to pseudonymous crypto analyst Daan Crypto Trades, the pricing of Bitcoin has significantly improved, reaching a more \u201cfair value\u201d compared to the past. \"6-8 weeks ago, the value vs expectations just didn\u2019t match up. Clearly.\"\n\nAccording to data from Santiment, an on-chain data analytics firm, the number of exchange wallets has reached its lowest level in 6 months, with only 8.03 million ETH. In contrast, non-exchange wallets have soared to an all-time high of 41.03 million ETH. This data indicates a trend of more people choosing to move their coins to self custody.\n\nPhoto by Igor Faun on Shutterstock\n\nRead Next: Jim Cramer Advises Against Using Binance, Provokes Strong Reactions From Twitter Users"

        "title": "Cryptocurrency wars: Ethereum beats Bitcoin by the most since its inception - HT Tech",
        "content": "Ether is outperforming Bitcoin by the greatest amount this year since the native token of the Ethereum network was launched in 2015 as an alternative to the original cryptocurrency. While both Bitcoin and Ethereum prices are down from record highs set earlier this month, Ether has gained about 530% since December, compared with a doubling in value by Bitcoin, widening the performance gap between the two by more than 400 percentage points. Bitcoin's market value is still almost double that of Ether at about $1.1 trillion, according to data from CoinMarketCap.com.\n\nThe largest difference between Ether and Bitcoin is that the former is seeing much greater association with ancillary growth sectors in crypto, including DeFi, non-fungible tokens and the so-called metaverse, said Stephane Ouellette, chief executive and co-founder of crypto platform FRNT Financial Inc.\n\n\u201cThe current BTC trading window seems to associate the asset more with global currency trends, inflation hedges, etc.,\u201d he said, adding \u201cwhile ETH has, at least from a current market perception standpoint, higher correlations with the growth of crypto sub-sectors.\u201d\n\nEther underpins the Ethereum network, the dominant blockchain used for thousands of decentralized applications, which has seen an uptick in usage and popularity this year. Plus, it underwent an upgrade that was expected to help make it faster and more scalable.\n\nThe token is making a run toward record highs once again, a rally whose trek was upended at the end of last week amid wider risk-asset turmoil. But after it bounced off its 50-day moving average on Monday, Ether has broken out to the upside and has advanced around 13% since Friday.\n\nSo-called meme coins Shiba Inu and Dogecoin climbed in value amid the rally in Ether. Shiba was up 26% in the last 24 hours and Dogecoin edged 3.1% higher, according to Coinmarketcap.com. The Kraken exchange listed Shiba for trading Tuesday.\n\nEther rose as much as 4.9% Tuesday to around $4,671 before paring gains. Last week, investors bought roughly $23 million of Ether, marking its fifth consecutive week of inflows, according to data compiled by CoinShares, a digital-asset manager.\n\nEther has outrun Bitcoin in all but four months so far this year and is closing November with a second straight month of outperformance. Right now, one Ether is the equivalent of about 8% of a Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin dropped about 1.9% to $57,221 on Tuesday, down from a record high of almost $69,000 earlier this month.\n\n\u201cI don't want to get too excited about this move too quickly. However, Ethereum has been outperforming Bitcoin over the past month,\u201d said Matt Maley, chief market strategist for Miller Tabak + Co. Should it break out above its mid-November highs while Bitcoin continues to sit below both its mid-November and its April highs, it will show that Ether has become the new crypto of choice for most investors, he added."

        "content": "Share:\n\nCoinbase stock is up almost 300% in 2023, outpacing Bitcoin and Ether's growth of 130% and 75%.\n\nAmong the drivers for the surge is skyrocketing trading volumes, Q4 numbers stand out with one month to go.\n\nIt comes amid expectation that Coinbase could be the frontrunner after the legal troubles of its industry peer Binance.\n\nCoinbase (COIN) stock has been in an uptrend since late October. COIN stock has gained strength as the US-based exchange gained favor while the sun set on its industry peer and market rival Binance.\n\nAlso Read: Coinbase seen as clear frontrunner after Binance, Changpeng Zhao capitulate to US DoJ\n\nCoinbase stock skyrockets\n\nCoinbase was touted as the clear chalk, betting favorite, or in simple terms, the best bet. This follows Binance\u2019s and former CEO Changpeng Zhao\u2019s (CZ) capitulation to the US Department of Justice (DoJ). Evidence of this has been reported by on-chain aggregator IntoTheBlock, showing that the exchange\u2019s stock, COIN, is up 300% this year, outpacing both Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), which are up 130% and 75% year to date.\n\nPrice performance: COIN, BTC, ETH, MicroStrategy\n\nThe data aggregator indicates that with the 300% value surge this year, trading volume has played a key role in driving the price. Fourth-quarter volumes have already surpassed what was recorded in the third quarter despite there being one full month to go before the final quarter ends.\n\nThe COIN chart on TradingView corroborates this outlook, showing a steep climb in COIN\u2019s share price in Q4. Specifically, it shows an 87% value surge since October 30 and a 61% rally since November 1.\n\nCOIN is already massively overbought, evidenced by the position of the Relative Strength Index (RSI) above 70. Nevertheless, the inclination of this momentum indicator shows that there could still be more upside potential.\n\nSimilarly, the Awesome Oscillator (AO) indicator is in positive territory with green-soaked histogram bars demonstrating that bulls have control of the COIN market.\n\nTradingView: COIN 1-day chart\n\nCoinbase CEO advertises the exchange at Binance\u2019s expense\n\nIt should be noted that Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong already pedaled the exchange following Binance\u2019s bubble bursting on November 21, saying, \u201cWe now have an opportunity to start a new chapter for this industry\u2026Americans should not have to go to offshore, unregulated exchanges to benefit from this technology.\u201d\n\nArmstrong touted the US as the rightful hub for crypto, highlighting that Coinbase believes in economic freedom and that the US democratic system will eventually get things right.\n\nSince the founding of Coinbase back in 2012 we have taken a long-term view. I knew we needed to embrace compliance to become a generational company that stood the test of time. We got the licenses, hired the compliance and legal teams, and made it clear our brand was about trust\u2026 \u2014 Brian Armstrong \ufe0f (@brian_armstrong) November 21, 2023\n\nRipple lawyer John E. Deaton corroborated the allusion. He attributed the assumption to the fact that the exchange has been named in the surveillance sharing agreement (SSA) of multiple institutional players that have filed for spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETF) with the US Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC), as indicated on NASDAQ's 19b-4 form.\n\n@coinbase will be a big winner. I expect to see BlackRock and Vanguard buy more. Btw, 90% of @GaryGensler\u2019s $120M fortune is with Vanguard. See how this works, yet? https://t.co/WHWGNY4vQJ \u2014 John E Deaton (@JohnEDeaton1) November 21, 2023\n\nNevertheless, Coinbase is not free of its own regulatory troubles. In a recent event, the exchange was found guilty of administrative offense and fined 1 million Rubles in Russia for non-compliance. This is aside from its ongoing contention with the SEC over securities law violations."

        "content": "In the vast landscape of cryptocurrencies, where market trends resemble winding trails, enthusiasts and investors often seek the best navigation routes. Today, our journey takes us through the hikers' haven of digital assets, exploring the recent success of GameStop Memes ($GSM) and its $4 million presale triumph. As we traverse the crypto trails, we'll also ascend the peaks of Ethereum (ETH) price analysis, discover why Stellar (XLM) coin has become a shining star, and unveil the allure of top crypto presales.\n\nEthereum Price: Navigating the Peaks and Valleys\n\nOur first stop on this crypto excursion brings us to the Ethereum peaks and valleys. The Ethereum price, akin to rugged mountain terrain, has recently encountered a downward slope from $2,130, currently resting below $2,060. In the cryptocurrency landscape, Ethereum stands tall as one of the best cryptocurrencies, but every trial has its challenges.\n\nAs we tread the Ethereum path, there's a significant resistance near $2,040, a formidable peak that ETH aims to conquer. This journey mirrors the undulating nature of crypto markets, a reminder that even the mightiest can face declines. But fear not, for Ethereum may find its footing like a seasoned hiker and ascend again. In the midst of Ethereum's price analysis, the presence of GameStop Memes is akin to a fellow hiker on this crypto trail. The $4 million presale success of $GSM adds an element of excitement and camaraderie, reminding us that in the dynamic crypto landscape, even the unexpected can become a trailblazer.\n\nStellar Coin: Milestones Ahead\n\nOur journey continues under the celestial canopy as we navigate towards Stellar, a shining star in the crypto night sky. Stellar coin enthusiasts have witnessed forecasts of an astronomical surge, with projections reaching an extraordinary 3,006%, aiming for the symbolic milestone of $3.50.\n\nAs with any celestial body, Stellar coin has experienced a recent dip, dropping by 5.29% to $0.116. However, EGRAG, our stargazing crypto analyst, remains undeterred in its bullish outlook. EGRAG's emphasis on the Fibonacci Circle 1.414 pattern as a support level adds a constellation of hope to Stellar's journey, indicating that this dip might be a passing meteor shower in the broader galaxy of potential growth. In the cosmic ballet of crypto, $GSM emerges as a radiant companion to XLM. The $4 million presale success of GameStop Memes echoes through the stellar expanse, a testament to this financial galaxy's diverse and unpredictable nature.\n\nGo Beyond the Ordinary With $GSM\n\nAs hikers of the crypto trails, we now set our sights on the expansive horizon of top crypto presales. These presales, akin to hidden treasures waiting to be discovered, redefine how investors engage with promising projects before they hit the mainstream and become the best cryptocurrencies.\n\nIn this section, the spotlight falls on GameStop Memes' presale triumph, securing an impressive $4 million. The success of GameStop Memes in the presale arena is a trailhead moment, signalling that this meme-driven token is not just making waves; it's creating a tidal shift in how crypto enthusiasts participate in the financial landscape.\n\nSummit Crypto Peaks with GameStop Memes\n\nAs we reach the summit of our crypto hiking expedition, the echoes of GameStop Memes' $4 million presale success reverberate through the peaks and valleys of Ethereum price analyses, the celestial expanse of Stellar coin forecasts, and the vast landscape of top crypto presales. GameStop Memes, like a seasoned guide on this crypto trail, proves that every dip, surge, and presale can be a transformative experience. As we descend from these heights, let the momentum of GameStop Memes serve as a compass, guiding us through the ever-evolving terrain of the cryptocurrency world. Happy trails, fellow crypto hikers.\n\n\n\nInvest in GSM while it's still in presale!\n\nWebsite: https://gamestmemes.com\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/GameStopMemes\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/GameStopMemes"

There is no bullish fundamental to drive the market, save for speculation around spot BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs). As it turns out, a positive development in this macroeconomy may be the only tune that Bitcoin dances to.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin Spot ETF applications see amendments, holders await January batch approval\n\nBitcoin price remains shy of $40,000\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price remains below the $40,000 mark, unresponsive to the show of confidence demonstrated by MicroStrategy, which has just expanded its portfolio with more than half a billion dollars worth of BTC.\n\nMicroStrategy has acquired an additional 16,130 BTC for ~$593.3 million at an average price of $36,785 per #bitcoin.

Its position at 60 points to a strong momentum, bolstered by the trajectory of the Simple Moving Averages (SMAs) that show upward is the path with the least resistance. Also, the Awesome Oscillator (AO) is still in positive territory, adding credence to the bullish thesis.\n\nIf the bulls can add to their buying power, Bitcoin price could extend past the $38,000 psychological level before overcoming the range high of $38,450 and tag the $40,000 psychological level.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the other hand, if sellers overpower the bulls, Bitcoin price could drop toward the $35,935 support level or even test the 50-day SMA at $34,317.

According to experts, its upside potential is capped at $2,500.\n\nIf the bulls can up their game, the largest altcoin by market capitalization could extend northward, breaking past $2,100 to tag the $2,136 range high.\n\nIn a highly bullish case, the gains could clear the aforementioned local top before tagging the $2,143 range high. Such a move would constitute a 5% climb above current levels.\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nConversely, if selling pressure increases, Ethereum price could lose $2,029 support, falling deep into the midline at $1,935. A break and close below this level would confirm the continuation of the downtrend, with ETH likely to test the confluence between the 50-day SMA and the lower boundary of the order block at $1,862.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum Price Prediction: ETH top-down analysis hints upside is capped at $2,500\n\nRipple price is at an inflection point\n\nRipple (XRP) price is at a crossroads, torn between heading north to breach the critical supply barrier and tagging $0.7000 or moving south. In the latter event, BTC could lose the 50-day SMA at $0.6040 before falling below the $0.5773 support level.\n\nA bullish catalyst could send Ripple price north to the supply zone stretching from $0.6572 to $0.7161.\n\nXRP/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the flipside, enhanced seller momentum could send Ripple price south, potentially going as low as the 200-day SMA at $0.5549.

        "content": "When we talk about the dynamism of the cryptocurrency world, we are in for a great ride on the excitement of potential gains and the ever-evolving market dynamics that make investors\u2019 choices harder and harder. So, today, we will explore the strategies and impacts of three amazing digital assets: Binance Coin (BNB), Ethereum (ETH), and the current innovator, GameStop Memes (GMS).\n\nIn this article, we will shed light on whether these three currencies will be a successful investment in the world of cryptocurrencies in 2024, especially after the $4 million presale of GameStop Memes.\n\nBNB Sees Surge in Popularity\n\nIn the first corner of our crypto battlefront, we have Binance Coin (BNB), the native cryptocurrency of the world-renowned Binance exchange. BNB has been a prominent player in the crypto space, known for its utility and versatility. Originally launched as an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain, BNB transitioned to Binance\u2019s native blockchain, Binance Chain, through a coin swap.\n\nBinance Coin\u2019s primary function is to fuel transactions and interactions within the Binance ecosystem. Users can utilise BNB to pay for trading fees, transaction fees, and even goods and services from merchants that accept them. This utility has solidified BNB\u2019s position in the crypto market and continues to evolve.\n\nOne of the key factors driving Binance Coin\u2019s popularity is its participation in various Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) and token sales on the Binance Launchpad. This has allowed investors to access promising projects at an early stage, potentially reaping significant rewards, which means it is likely to be a good investment in 2024.\n\nEthereum: An Uncertain Investment in 2024?\n\nIn the opposite corner, Ethereum (ETH) stands out for its groundbreaking approach to blockchain technology. While Bitcoin primarily focuses on digital currency, Ethereum takes a broader perspective.\n\nLaunched by Vitalik Buterin in 2015, Ethereum introduced the concept of smart contracts, enabling developers to create decentralised applications (DApps) and customise blockchain solutions. This innovation opened doors to a wide range of applications beyond traditional finance.\n\nHowever, Ethereum has grappled with scalability issues. Its current infrastructure struggles to handle a high volume of transactions efficiently. This has resulted in high gas fees and slower transaction processing times, limiting its potential; therefore, Ethereum may not be a good investment in 2024.\n\nGameStop Memes\u2019 Disruptive Entry to Crypto\n\nNow, let\u2019s shine the spotlight on the disruptor of the hour, GameStop Memes (GMS). Inspired by the GameStop saga that made headlines, GMS takes the meme culture to new heights by turning popular internet memes into tradable assets.\n\nGameStop Memes\u2019 strength lies in its community-driven ethos. It thrives on the collective enthusiasm of its users, who come together to celebrate and invest in their favourite memes. While it may not possess the technological sophistication of Ethereum or the dominance of Binance Coin, it introduces an element of fun and community spirit to the crypto space.\n\nMoreover, GameStop Memes made a significant mark by amassing an impressive $4 million during its presale, signifying growing interest and support for this meme-inspired cryptocurrency. While its long-term impact on the crypto market remains uncertain, it undeniably injects excitement and unpredictability into the scene.\n\nWe\u2019ve explored the strengths and strategies of Binance Coin, Ethereum, and GameStop Memes in this crypto battle. Binance Coin excels in utility and participation in token sales, Ethereum pioneer\u2019s innovation with its smart contracts, and GameStop Memes adds a playful twist to the world of crypto.\n\nSo far, the GameStop Memes method seems effective and distinct after achieving $4 million in presale.\n\nInvest in GSM while it\u2019s still in presale!\n\nWebsite: https://GameStopmemes.com/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/GameStopopMemes\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/GameStopopMemes\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nWhatsApp\n\nLinkedIn\n\nEmail\n\nPrint\n\n"

        "content": "The Ethereum community finds itself buzzing with excitement today as the price of Ether (ETH) experiences a notable surge. Investors, enthusiasts, and market analysts alike are left pondering the driving forces behind this sudden upswing.\n\nFrom fundamental developments within the Ethereum ecosystem to external influences shaping the digital currency landscape, this is the reason behind today\u2019s remarkable surge in Ethereum prices.\n\nEthereum price starts Dec on an upswing\n\nEther (ETH), the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency, has made remarkable gains, with its price reclaiming $2,1000 levels. The bullishness comes as the US SEC opens up discussions for the approval of a spot Ethereum ETF.\n\nAt the time of this publication, the price of ETH is $2,093.73, with a 24-hour trading volume of $15,199,416,151.51. This is a 2.98% increase in the previous 24 hours and a 1.21% increase in the last 7 days.\n\nMichael van de Poppe, a crypto analyst, is bullish on Ethereum following the Fidelity filing. In light of this filing, he reaffirms his conviction that, following the rise of Bitcoin, ETH would reach $3,500 in the first quarter of 2024.\n\n#Ethereum Spot ETF filing by Fidelity!\n\n\n\nConfirms my thesis that after #Bitcoin gets its shine, we\u2019ll see Ethereum running to $3,500 in Q1 2024. \u2014 Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) November 30, 2023\n\nHere are some of the factors influencing the price of ETH. The Ethereum whale accumulation has been quite vigorous. In addition, on-chain data reveals the substantial exchange of wallet holdings. The largest Ethereum wallets, according to Santiment, are exhibiting a bullish pattern, signaling a significant shift.\n\nExchange wallets have reached an all-time low of 8.03 million ETH in the last six months, while non-exchange wallets have reached an all-time high of 41.03 million ETH. As more currencies move away from exchanges, this trend shows an increasing preference for self-custody.\n\nIn November, the price of ETH increased by 13%, beating Bitcoin\u2019s 8% increase. Blackrock\u2019s official filing for a spot ETH ETF (Ether-based Exchange Traded Fund) was a big contributor to Ethereum\u2019s growth.\n\nDespite the dwindling media frenzy around ETFs, on-chain data shows that ETH\u2019s price volatility has overtaken Bitcoin\u2019s. This pattern may attract swing traders and short-term day traders to invest in ETH rather than BTC in December as well.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Goerli Testnet to end support and upgrade\n\nThe Ethereum development team announced on Thursday, November 30, that the blockchain\u2018s multi-client testnet Goerli would no longer receive support from the client and ETH Foundation testing teams.\n\nThe Dencun upgrade will be the final and final implementation, culminating in a team exit three months after Goerli Dencun activation or one month after Dencun mainnet activation.\n\nUsers that rely on Goerli for stable testnet environments are recommended to migrate ahead of time, according to the ETH Foundation. Despite Goerli staking\u2019s permissionless nature, the departure of validators from client and testing teams, who comprise a considerable stake majority, offers possible stability concerns. At the same time, teams intend to use this transition to test delayed finality, inactivity leaks, and mass slashings.\n\nIn the coming months, Goerli, Ethereum\u2019s first multi-client testnet, will stop being supported by client and EF testing teams. The Dencun network upgrade will be the last one implemented on the network. Either three months after the Goerli Dencun activation, or one month after the Dencun mainnet activation, whichever comes later, teams will begin exiting their validators [1]. Anyone relying on Goerli as a stable testnet should migrate elsewhere prior to this. Ethereum\n\nWhile Goerli is likely to be the first testnet to activate the Dencun upgrade, the Ethereum team will disclose the exact date as soon as possible.\n\nThe ETH Foundation recommends that developers use Sepolia to test decentralized applications, smart contracts, and other ETH Virtual Machine (EVM) features. The permissioned validator set provided by Sepolia ensures a stable testing environment. Alternatively, testing against ETH mainnet state copies is made easier by a variety of local development environments.\n\nStakers and infrastructure providers interested in protocol-level testing could look into the freshly launched Holesky testnet, on which anyone can run a validator. The Ephemery testnet provides a weekly reset capability for validator setup testing, allowing for lightweight end-to-end testing of the validator lifecycle.\n\nThe ETH blockchain network has gone a long way through multiple modifications over the years. The upcoming ETH improvements will mostly focus on increasing scalability."

        "title": "Fidelity's Ethereum ETF draws SEC attention for public review - Cryptopolitan",
        "content": "The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is actively inviting public comments on a significant proposal by Fidelity Investments. The investment giant has filed for a spot in the Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF), which could have far-reaching implications for the cryptocurrency sector.\n\nIn a recent development, the SEC released a notice regarding Cboe BZX Exchange\u2019s intent to list Fidelity\u2019s Ethereum Trust shares. This action signifies a pivotal moment for the cryptocurrency industry, as it could lead to the first spot in Ethereum ETF in the United States. The SEC encourages individuals and entities to provide their insights, data, and arguments about this proposed rule change. The deadline for submitting comments is set at 21 days from the notice.\n\nFidelity\u2019s application, filed on November 17, closely follows a similar submission by BlackRock for their spot ETF, the iShares Ethereum Trust. This surge in interest among major financial institutions underscores the growing significance of cryptocurrencies in the global financial landscape.\n\nPotential impacts and industry responses\n\nApproval of Fidelity\u2019s Ethereum ETF could significantly shift the crypto market. It would offer investors a more regulated and arguably safer avenue for crypto investments than the current methods, which often involve high fees and increased risks. The notice from the SEC highlights these concerns, emphasizing the need for a regulated product to mitigate the risks associated with direct cryptocurrency investments.\n\nThe broader implications of this development are substantial. CryptoQuant, a data analytics firm, projects that approving a spot Bitcoin ETF could boost the company\u2019s market capitalization by $900 billion, potentially injecting over $1 trillion into the broader crypto market. This demonstrates the transformative potential of such ETFs in mainstreaming cryptocurrencies within the U.S. financial system.\n\nMoreover, the SEC\u2019s decision to invite public comments follows a recent event where a federal judge, Neomi Reo, questioned the SEC\u2019s denial of a spot Bitcoin ETF by Grayscale Investments. This has increased interest in spot Bitcoin ETF applications from other entities such as VanEck Bitcoin Trust, Invesco Gallery Bitcoin ETF, and Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust.\n\nJames Seyffart, a Bloomberg ETF research analyst, commented that Fidelity\u2019s filing is part of a broader process in the application for a spot Ether ETF. He anticipates definitive deadline dates to be announced in the coming weeks.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s request for public commentary on Fidelity\u2019s spot Ether ETF application is a crucial step in a larger journey towards potentially integrating cryptocurrencies more deeply into the U.S. financial system. With major financial institutions showing increasing interest in cryptocurrency ETFs, the outcome of this application could signal a new era in crypto investments, providing investors with a regulated, mainstream platform for crypto asset exposure. The industry awaits the decision with keen interest, recognizing its potential to reshape cryptocurrency investment landscape in the U.S."

        "content": "In the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrency, the dynamics of market leadership are constantly shifting. While established players like THORChain (RUNE) and Ethereum (ETH) have made significant strides, a new contender, VC Spectra (SPCT), is emerging as a formidable force.\n\nLet\u2019s delve into the recent performances of RUNE and ETH, juxtaposed against the rising star, VC Spectra, to provide a comprehensive market analysis.\n\n>>BUY SPCT TOKENS NOW<<\n\nSummary\n\nTHORChain (RUNE) experienced a dramatic 110.98% price increase in the last month but faced a slight 0.96% decrease in the past week, highlighting its volatile nature.\n\nEthereum (ETH) saw a steady 13.56% growth over the past month, despite a minor 0.68% dip recently, continuing to expand its influence in the blockchain and NFT sectors.\n\nVC Spectra (SPCT) has emerged as a strong investment option with an 862.5% increase in presale token price, offering dividends, buybacks, and access to exclusive ICOs, with an expected further surge.\n\nTHORChain (RUNE) Registers A Decline After A Rollercoaster of Volatility\n\nTHORChain\u2019s recent market performance has been nothing short of a rollercoaster. In the last month, THORChain (RUNE) saw a staggering 110.98% increase in its price, soaring from $2.51 to $5.29, peaking at $6.64.\n\nHowever, the past week paints a different picture, with a slight 0.96% decrease in value. This volatility reflects the crypto market\u2019s dynamic nature and the challenges investors face in predicting future trends.\n\nRecent news highlights THORChain\u2019s growing prominence, particularly its rise as the third-largest decentralized exchange by trading volume. This development, as reported, underscores THORChain\u2019s (RUNE) potential in reshaping the DeFi landscape.\n\nHowever, for beginners in cryptocurrency, such volatility might seem daunting, making it crucial to consider more stable investment options.\n\nEthereum (ETH): Navigating Market Fluctuations With New Partnerships\n\nEthereum (ETH), a veteran in the crypto space, has also experienced its share of fluctuations.

However, the past week saw a minor 0.68% dip, highlighting the inherent unpredictability of the crypto market.\n\nEthereum\u2019s ecosystem continues to expand, with recent news from this month showcasing its influence in the NFT sector through partnerships with major retailers like Walmart. Such developments reinforce Ethereum\u2019s position as a critical player in the blockchain industry.\n\nYet, for those seeking the best cryptocurrency to invest in, Ethereum\u2019s current stagnation might prompt a search for more lucrative opportunities.\n\nVC Spectra (SPCT): The Rising Star In Crypto Is Prime For Investment\n\nAmidst the ebb and flow of established cryptocurrencies, VC Spectra emerges as a compelling investment choice. This decentralized hedge fund offers quarterly dividends and buybacks from its investment profits and grants users access to exclusive ICOs and voting rights.\n\nThe SPCT token, built on the Bitcoin blockchain, stands out with its deflationary nature and a burn mechanism that ensures long-term value. Furthermore, a team of venture capitalists and risk managers protect every investment made by the Spectra blockchain.\n\nVC Spectra\u2019s presale performance has been remarkable, with an 862.5% increase in token price from $0.008 in Stage 1 to $0.077 in Stage 5. This surge is a testament to the project\u2019s robust fundamentals and real-life utility.\n\nAnalysts forecast a further increase to $0.080 by the end of the public presale, marking a 900% surge and positioning SPCT as a top crypto to invest in.\n\nLearn more about the VC Spectra (SPCT) presale here:\n\nPresale: https://invest.vcspectra.io/login\n\nWebsite: https://vcspectra.io\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/VCSpectra\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/spectravcfund"

        "title": "2024 Forecast for Ethereum Classic: Will ETC Reach $50? Expert Insights on Investing in Rebel Satoshi - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "SPONSORED POST*\n\n$50 seems ambitious for Ethereum Classic in 2024; ETC will likely trade in the $25-30 range or higher\n\nExciting developments await the new meme coin, Rebel Satoshi\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC) last hit $50 in March 2022. Can 2024 be the year the \u2018original Ethereum\u2019 returns to this mark? Meanwhile, experts have made promising insights on better crypto to buy \u2013 Rebel Satoshi ($RBLZ). Let\u2019s compare the prospects of the two projects, beginning with Ethereum Classic.\n\nCan Ethereum Classic Reach $50 In 2024?\n\nThe notorious 2016 DAO (decentralized autonomous organization) hack split the then-emerging Ethereum. Some deleted this event from history and \u2018restarted\u2019 Ethereum. Meanwhile, based on the \u2018code is law\u2019 principles, others kept this historical data, renaming the network to Ethereum Classic.\n\nAlthough Ethereum Classic is the original, it receives far less attention and trading volume than Ethereum. Some investors are unaware that Ethereum Classic still exists, as it\u2019s nowhere near the list of top 10 altcoins. The second disadvantage is that Ethereum Classic hasn\u2019t evolved as competitively as Ethereum.\n\nThe main benefit of Ethereum Classic is that it often follows the price of Ethereum. With the massive adoption of the former, ETC\u2019s value can always rise accordingly. But hitting $50 in 2024 would take a huge 164% rise from the current value of $18.95. Conservative forecasts suggest ETC will likely hover in the $25-35 range (or higher) in 2024.\n\nMeanwhile, current investors in Rebel Satoshi can expect a 150% ROI much sooner due to the project\u2019s fast-moving presale.\n\nMuch Excitement In Store For Rebel Satoshi\n\nRebel Satoshi is a unique, rebel-inspired meme coin that will awaken the little guys who elite centralized systems have oppressed. The project is modeled after the heroic rebelliousness of Guy Fawkes and Satoshi Nakamoto. With their energy, Rebel Satoshi will succeed in any objective it sets, demonstrating the power of a unified community.\n\nThe project\u2019s goal is to hit a $100 million market cap before steadily climbing high in the rankings of meme-based top altcoins. It has an attractive ecosystem focused on community-building, meme culture, and financial rewards.\n\nThe Rebellion Secret Council is a space for early supporters to govern the platform and receive insider updates. These adopters can also be inducted into the Rebel Meme Hall of Fame by sharing their best rebel-themed memes for laughs and popularity.\n\nThe second part is the Rebel Artefacts Vault, a splendid NFT marketplace representing the project\u2019s story. It\u2019s a treasure trove of 9,999 collectibles and digital art characters. Finally, the Revolutionary Staking Hub is set to offer excellent passive income from staking the $RBLZ token.\n\n$RBLZ has a fixed supply (250 million) to honor Nakamoto\u2019s deflationary vision. Moreover, Rebel Satoshi will \u2018burn\u2018 any unsold $RBLZ after its presale is complete in a symbolic nod to Guy Fawkes.\n\nSpeaking of which, the presale is in the first or Early Bird Round, with $RBLZ trading for $0.010. The aftermath has many exciting expectations, like a 150% return for current buyers since the token is set to trade at $0.025. So, it\u2019s a no-brainer to join sooner than later!\n\nFor the latest updates and more information, be sure to visit the official Rebel Satoshi Presale Website or contact Rebel Red via Telegram\n\n*This article was paid for Cryptonomist did not write the article or test the platform."
