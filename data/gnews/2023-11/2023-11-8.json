        "content": "Image Source: Getty Images\n\nEthereum (ETH 2.46%) is the decentralized, open-source technology that powers much of the crypto world. Everything from decentralized finance (DeFi) applications and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to enterprise blockchain solutions relies on Ethereum's technology. Ethereum's native token, Ether, is the second-largest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin (BTC 5.7%). The Ethereum Merge, the network's long-awaited shift to a proof-of-stake system, is expected to make the technology remarkably more energy-efficient. The Ethereum Foundation has predicted the shift will cut energy usage by around 99.95%. If you want to profit from the growing use of Ethereum, there are several ways you can invest. The most direct option is buying Ethereum itself. Because it's extremely volatile, this carries the greatest risk but also the greatest potential profits. Another option is buying Ethereum stocks, including managed funds that invest in Ethereum for you and companies with large exposure to Ethereum technology.\n\nWhat is Ethereum? Ethereum is an open-source blockchain technology in the form of software. Software developer Vitalik Buterin originally proposed the idea in 2013, and Ethereum launched in 2015. Any developer making an application that would benefit from blockchain technology can build it on the Ethereum network. While Ethereum is most associated with its native Ether token and other cryptocurrencies, its technology is also enabling widespread innovation in industries as diverse as insurance, logistics, and healthcare. Developers write programs on Ethereum using self-executing, self-enforcing protocols called smart contracts, which are deployed to Ethereum-powered blockchains. The blockchain's network of computers executes the smart contract by performing specified actions when the conditions of the contract are met. Blockchain data can't be modified after it's created, and that gives users confidence in the technology. Although early cryptocurrencies, most notably Bitcoin, are merely stores of value that can be transferred, Ethereum has more uses. If Bitcoin is a smartphone app, Ethereum is more like the device maker. Ethereum's cryptocurrency benefits from its technology because transaction fees for decentralized applications on its blockchain are paid in Ether. What is the Ethereum Merge? The Ethereum Merge is the term for the network's switch from its original proof-of-work system to a proof-of-stake system, scheduled to occur in mid-September 2022. When Ethereum launched, it used proof of work, the same system used by Bitcoin, to validate and record transactions. A notable drawback of this system is extremely high energy usage, which has led to Bitcoin using more power per year than some entire countries. In 2020, Ethereum introduced the Beacon Chain, a proof-of-stake network. However, it continued using its original proof-of-work mainnet for processing transactions. The Merge is when Ethereum will combine the Beacon Chain with the mainnet and make the transition to proof of stake. The primary benefit of The Merge is energy efficiency. Transaction speeds will change a small amount but not enough for most users to notice.\n\nTop Ethereum stocks Here are the best stocks to buy if you want to add Ethereum to your portfolio: 1. Grayscale Ethereum Trust The Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE 2.67%) is a managed fund that makes it easy to add Ethereum to your brokerage account. Each share is backed by a fixed amount of Ether tokens (approximately 0.01 Ether per share). Keep in mind that the fund's share price is often lower than the value of Ethereum at the prevailing conversion rate. Grayscale also charges a somewhat expensive annual management fee of 2.5%. Shareholders can't exchange shares for Ethereum, so there's no price arbitrage opportunity. 2. Bitwise Ethereum Fund Bitwise is the world's biggest crypto index fund manager. It offers managed funds for multiple types of cryptocurrency, and one option is the Bitwise Ethereum Fund. The fund is available to accredited investors and has a minimum investment of $25,000. The fund's managers seek to minimize transaction costs, and they hold the fund's Ethereum offline in cold crypto storage, making it a cost-efficient and secure Ethereum stock. There's an annual management fee of 1.5%. If you want a more diverse digital asset portfolio, check out the Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund (BITW 4.43%), which includes a mix of several of the top cryptocurrencies. 3. Coinbase Coinbase (COIN 2.72%) is the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the U.S. The company charges transaction fees to buyers and sellers of a wide range of cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum. In addition to Ethereum, many other cryptocurrencies traded on Coinbase use the Ethereum blockchain. The exchange rolled out Ethereum staking in 2021, allowing investors to lock up their Ether and earn rewards on it during the upgrade to a proof-of-stake system. Coinbase's staking program is expected to significantly benefit from the completion of The Merge. Analysis from Goldman Sachs (GS 0.15%) predicts that Coinbase will generate $250 million to $600 million in additional revenue from Ethereum staking. 4. Staked ETH Trust The Staked ETH Trust is the first traditional investment vehicle that allowed shareholders to get Ethereum exposure and receive staking rewards. It's open by private placement to accredited investors, with a minimum investment amount of $25,000 and an expense ratio of 1%. Considering the attention that Ethereum staking is getting from The Merge, the fund could become very popular. The staking rewards allow the trust's underlying Ether holdings to grow about 7.5% annually, helping it to outperform non-staking funds. The biggest advantage of the Staked ETH Trust is how much it simplifies staking for investors. You invest in it by buying shares, like any traditional investment vehicle, and the staking itself is handled by the fund administrator. 5. Robinhood Markets Robinhood Markets (HOOD 4.23%) may be best known as the discount broker that ushered in the age of commission-free trading. That's not the only way it has been ahead of the game. In 2018, it began offering crypto trading of Bitcoin and Ethereum. The broker has since expanded its selection to include a few other cryptocurrencies, including Litecoin (LTC 0.18%) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH -1.93%). Although Robinhood isn't a pure cryptocurrency play, it does offer some exposure to Ethereum.\n\nHow to invest in Ethereum If you want to directly invest in Ethereum, you can buy it through a crypto exchange, a stock broker, or even a payment app that carries it. Since Ethereum is one of the largest cryptocurrencies by market cap, it's available on almost all platforms that sell crypto. Here are the different types of platforms you can use to buy Ethereum: Cryptocurrency exchanges : The exchanges let users buy, sell, and trade cryptocurrencies. Examples of popular crypto exchanges include Coinbase and Gemini.\n\nThe exchanges let users buy, sell, and trade cryptocurrencies. Examples of popular crypto exchanges include Coinbase and Gemini. Stock brokers : Some stock brokers have started selling select cryptocurrencies, with Robinhood being the most prominent example.\n\nSome stock brokers have started selling select cryptocurrencies, with Robinhood being the most prominent example. Payment apps: You can buy and sell crypto, including Ethereum, on PayPal ( PYPL 1.4% For serious crypto investors, a crypto exchange is usually the best option. Exchanges offer the widest selection of cryptocurrencies and the most features. They also let you transfer your crypto off the exchange to a crypto wallet that you control. Stock brokers and payment apps often don't let you transfer your crypto anywhere. Related investing topics:\n\nShould you invest in Ethereum? Ethereum technology is at the core of most blockchain applications. Many believe blockchain will play a significant role in the future of finance and other industries, making exposure to Ethereum technology a potentially profitable addition to your investment portfolio. The value of Ether as a digital currency is much more volatile and unpredictable than the growth of Ethereum technology. You can mitigate some of that risk and should take steps to guard against hacking, but, ultimately, the value of any investment directly linked to Ether is likely to fluctuate. Any of the above investment recommendations deserves consideration, especially if you believe that the development of blockchain technology is only just beginning.\n\nEthereum FAQs What is ethereum? angle-down angle-up Ethereum is a blockchain technology in the form of software.

        "title": "Bitcoin approaches $38,000 and Ethereum crosses $2,000 as ETF fever continues to buoy the crypto market - Fortune",
        "content": "The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization continued to push past year-long highs, as Bitcoin approached $38,000 late Thursday morning, an approximately 7% increase in the past 24 hours, according to data from CoinGecko. Its peak of $37,935 was the highest the coin has reached in more than 18 months.\n\nEther, the token for the Ethereum blockchain and second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was also up, crossing the $2,000 mark for the first time since July on the back of an 8% day-over-day price upswing.\n\nThe market capitalization for all cryptocurrencies increased approximately 5.4% day-over-day to $1.45 trillion, as some of the other largest coins on the market saw large gains as of Thursday morning, including Cardano (8.2%), Solana (9.9%), and Chainlink (12.7%). The movements in the crypto markets far outpaced the stock indices, with the NASDAQ and S&P 500 basically flat over the past 24 hours.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s recent upswing is mainly due to \u201coptimism around a near-term spot Bitcoin ETF approval and a resulting short-squeeze,\u201d Brian Rudick, a senior strategist at crypto trading firm GSR, told Fortune, referring to a Bitcoin-based financial product that traditional investors can trade. And on Thursday morning, BlackRock registered the name \u201ciShares Ethereum Trust\u201d in Delaware, an indication \u201cthat it is likely to file a spot ether ETF application soon,\u201d he added.\n\nDavid Lawant, head of research at crypto brokerage and trading platform FalconX, echoed Rudick\u2019s assessment. Bitcoin \u201ccontinues to perform well as the market focuses on the U.S. spot ETF approval process,\u201d he told Fortune, adding that the \u201cbig star of the day\u201d has been Ethereum, following news of BlackRock\u2019s registration of the \u201ciShares Ethereum Trust\u201d name.\n\nThe rapid rise in the prices of major cryptocurrencies continues a month-long rally in the digital assets market. The total market capitalization for all cryptocurrencies has rocketed about 30% since Oct. 9, rising alongside optimism over the likely approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF, or exchange-traded fund.\n\nTraditional investors, who manage trillions of dollars in capital, are largely constrained by the investment products available on portfolio management platforms like Vanguard or TD Ameritrade. If the Securities and Exchange Commission were to approve a spot Bitcoin ETF, which lets traditional investors trade on current Bitcoin prices, crypto industry boosters are betting that tremendous amounts of capital would flow into the Bitcoin\u2014and crypto\u2014markets.\n\nWhile the industry has repeatedly tried and failed to convince the SEC to approve a spot Bitcoin ETF, BlackRock, the largest asset manager in the world, filed an application for its own spot Bitcoin ETF in June. Since then, the crypto markets have rallied, and other financial institutions have filed their own ETF applications, hoping to cash in if the SEC were to approve the application from BlackRock, which has a sterling record of past ETF approvals.\n\nAnd starting Thursday, a brief period for the SEC to approve a spot Bitcoin ETF opened, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analysts, who believe that, even if approvals don't come in November, there is a 90% chance of approval by January.\n\n\"There is significant hype surrounding the recent comments from Bloomberg regarding the ETF 'window,'\" James Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares, told Fortune. \"Admittedly, it is always a little worrying when prices rise so sharply. That said, as we enter into this new bull market, it is worth reflecting on the point that we remain well below the all-time-highs seen in 2021.\""

The price of Ether (ETH/USD) spiked roughly 7% before paring back some of those gains.\n\nBlackrock made a similar move with iShares Bitcoin Trust roughly one week before applying for a spot bitcoin ETF with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nThe possibility of a spot bitcoin ETF receiving approval from the SEC has been all the talk in the crypto industry ever since Blackrock originally filed for its offering in June of this year. Bitcoin's (BTC/USD) price is up more than 40% since that application was filed. Analysts from Bloomberg, JPMorgan Chase, and elsewhere see an approval of at least one spot bitcoin ETF by January of next year as very likely.\n\nA number of futures-based Ether ETFs were already launched roughly one month ago, but they have failed to gain much traction. At this time, it is unclear if Blackrock's potential Ether ETF would be based on futures or spot offerings. It is thought that a spot Ether ETF would have major implications for the crypto asset in terms of putting it on a similar regulatory footing as bitcoin in the eyes of the SEC."

        "content": "BlackRock has taken the initial step toward filing for a spot Ether ETF, with the iShares Ethereum Trust recently registered in Delaware.\n\nThis move is reminiscent of BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust, which was registered in a similar fashion seven days before the ETF application was filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nIn the context of an industry bristling with anticipation for the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF, BlackRock\u2019s move potentially signals a pivotal moment for Ethereum, shedding light on its status as a prospective asset class in institutional investment portfolios.\n\nDespite the positive indications, it\u2019s important to recall the precedent set by the SEC\u2019s handling of Bitcoin ETFs. As reported by CryptoSlate in October 2023 Source, despite rumors indicating otherwise, the SEC had not approved the iShares Bitcoin ETF. The regulator had delayed its verdict on several proposed rule changes, which included applications from leading firms such as Fidelity (Wise Origin), VanEck, WisdomTree, and Invesco.\n\nIn light of this, BlackRock\u2019s iShares Ethereum Trust registration, while a significant development, leads us into a territory of considerable uncertainty. The SEC\u2019s previous hesitance to approve Bitcoin ETFs might cast a long shadow over BlackRock\u2019s budding Ethereum trust, potentially heralding a new cycle of applications, approvals, delays, and rejections.\n\nAs the crypto community watches these developments with bated breath, two things have been game-changers for the industry: Grayscale\u2019s court victory and BlackRock\u2019s entry into the market. Ethereum ETFs, in this context, may just be the next frontier. However, for now, all eyes are trained on the SEC as the crypto industry awaits its verdict on the pending rule changes and the potential approval of BlackRock\u2019s iShares Ethereum Trust.\n\nBlackRock\u2019s Ethereum Trust filing surfaces as another key narrative to monitor closely. As the crypto industry continues to evolve and mature, such developments underscore the increasing intersectionality of traditional finance and digital asset markets, hinting at a prospective future where digital currencies like Ethereum may become more commonplace in institutional investment portfolios."

        "content": "When Ethereum\u2019s \u201cMerge\u201d to proof-of-stake went off without a hitch last September, some felt the layer-1 was primed for a breakout. Speculation arose around a \u201cflippening\u201d and institutional investors waited in the wings.\n\nBut ether\u2019s price did not end up meeting these expectations. NFTs tested new lows, and the bear market muted DeFi engagement. Bitcoin continued to outpace ether in 2023 \u2014 recently reaching dominance levels not seen since 2021. Meanwhile, institutional inflows are largely yet to materialize.\n\nBlockworks spoke with Justin Drake, a researcher at the Ethereum Foundation, about the network\u2019s current standing and future prospects. Keep reading for more excerpts from Blockworks\u2019 interview with Drake.\n\nBlockworks: You can see variations of this stat in different places, but the rewards paid out by Ethereum were larger than the transaction fees that were burned in both September and October. It looks like that\u2019s turned around a little bit, but how should people think about issuance versus burn and when that flips negative?\n\nDrake: The fee market is exceptionally volatile. What you really want to be doing is zooming out, because when you zoom out, you\u2019re smoothing your data over a longer period of time.\n\nIf you look at ultrasound.money, you\u2019ll notice that when it\u2019s profitable, it\u2019s like printing money. It\u2019s really, really profitable. Ethereum has about a profit margin of 50% which is outstanding for a business. Now okay, on some days, especially weekends, it won\u2019t be profitable. In some months, if you\u2019re in the absolute depth of the bear market, then it won\u2019t be profitable. But over a long period of time, it\u2019s extremely profitable.\n\nBlockworks: How important is this deflationary aspect of Ethereum and Ethereum\u2019s ability to generate fees? Because obviously Ethereum is not a company in the traditional sense where your revenues need to outweigh costs. So how should people think about revenue versus issuance? And how important is that metric as a way to gauge the success of the network?\n\nDrake: Broader than just as a company, some people think of ether, the asset, as money for the internet. And in that context, scarcity as a meme is extremely important. There\u2019s this almost obsession with the 21 million Bitcoin meme precisely because it\u2019s all about scarcity. And for the first time in history pretty much, we have money which not only has a fixed supply but actually has a decreasing supply.\n\nSo now there\u2019s what I call memetic potential. Memes are ideas that spread. The 21 million meme is one that spreads far and wide because it\u2019s kind of an attractive thing intellectually. There\u2019s an opportunity potentially for this meme to spread that ether is the scarcest money on Earth. Its supply is going down over time.\n\nBlockworks: And who benefits from this meme?\n\nDrake: Ether the asset is the basis of two very fundamental public goods in any programmable blockchain.\n\nPublic good number one is economic security. We\u2019re trying to build systems here which have a lot of longevity. We want to be in a position where it\u2019s extremely difficult even for the most powerful nation-states out there to attack Ethereum.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s this second really important public good for blockchains which is called economic bandwidth, and that\u2019s the ability to be used as collateral within DeFi. Ether is especially valuable as collateral money because it\u2019s the only so-called pristine collateral. Pristine means that there\u2019s no contract risk. There\u2019s no governance risk. There\u2019s no oracle risk. It\u2019s the one risk free asset.\n\nBlockworks: It sounds like you\u2019re saying the idea of ultrasound money is a means to these larger ends that you described.\n\nDrake: Exactly. It\u2019s a Trojan Horse, but ultimately the value is utilitarian through economic security and economic bandwidth.\n\nBlockworks: Ethereum\u2019s validator queue has been in the hundreds of people waiting to stake ether (ETH), and that\u2019s down from tens of thousands over the summer and even into September. What do you make of this?\n\nDrake: The churn, which is basically the amount of validators that can be processed by the queue, is proportional to the amount of staked ETH. As the amount of staked ETH grows, the churn grows and it becomes easier and easier to clear the queue. And so in that sense, looking at the queue is kind of a totally irrelevant game. The fact that the queue is very low just means that ether is very efficient at processing deposits.\n\nThe better metric is what\u2019s called deposits. Every single day on average, there\u2019s 40,000 ETH coming in, which is a huge amount of money.\n\nBlockworks: How concerned are you about staking yields being down?\n\nDrake: I mean in a way, the lower the better, right? Because it means that we\u2019re not spending as much to secure Ethereum. Ethereum is already extremely secure.\n\nThe security ratio is the value secured by Ethereum, which is all the ETH, all the NFTs, all the ERC-20s divided by the value securing Ethereum, and it\u2019s 7.5, which is extremely healthy. If we were to have more staked ETH, this ratio would keep on going down. But there\u2019s no real need for that. And so having more staked ETH in the way is wastefully paying for security.\n\nBlockworks: Post-Merge, there was a lot of excitement about Ethereum. In 2023, ether\u2019s price has gone up, but especially compared to bitcoin, not as much as some had predicted. Why is that?\n\nRead more: The flippening: Will ether flip bitcoin in the next year?\n\nDrake: What tends to happen, generally speaking, is that during bear markets, dominance of bitcoin goes up, and then during bull markets, it drops down precipitously and then it reaches a new low, so this is all standard behavior.\n\nWhat I\u2019ll say is that bitcoin dominance hasn\u2019t grown as much as what would have been expected in the bear market. So I think expectations were unreasonable thinking that during a bear market, ether will outperform [bitcoin].\n\nThis is all speculation, but my guess is that there will be a flippening in the next bull run.\n\nInterview responses were edited for brevity and clarity.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "Ether surpasses $2,000 for first time since July as BlackRock registers iShares Ethereum Trust entity in Delaware - The Block",
        "content": "Ether's price broke through the $2,000 mark for the first time since July, rallying amidst news that BlackRock appeared to take an initial step in the possible offering of a spot Ethereum ETH +2.29% ETF with a filing to register a new iShares Ethereum Trust entity in Delaware\n\nEther's price jumped over 7% on Thursday to $2,040, at 12:15 p.m. ET, according to CoinGecko. Bitcoin also made notable gains, reaching a daily high of $37,925 before falling back in a swathe of long liquidations to $36,311.\n\nThursday's market uptick is part of a multi-faceted event-led rally, according to analysts at Bitfinex. \"We believe that we are in an accumulation phase for the next cycle and the bottom could very well be in place,\" Bitfinex analysts told The Block.\n\nMarket rally spurred by spot ETF narrative\n\nCoinShares Head of Research James Butterfill said Thursday's price spike was also triggered by spot ETF-related remarks made by Bloomberg Intelligence analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart. On Thursday, a window opened for the SEC to \"theoretically issue approval orders\" for a spot bitcoin ETF, they wrote.\n\n\"A brief window opens on November 9 for the SEC to potentially approve all 12 U.S. spot bitcoin ETF applicants, including Grayscale's GBTC. Even if approvals don't arrive this month, we still believe there's a 90% chance of approval by January 10,\" the Bloomberg analysts noted.\n\nHowever, speaking to The Block, Butterfill cautioned against predicting whether approvals will materialize within this window. The CoinShares analyst added that markets are extremely sensitive to the spot ETF topic.\n\n\"This sensitivity was evident in our recent investor survey, where nearly 60% of investor concerns were centered on government regulation. Therefore, any positive news in this area is likely to be, and has been, eagerly seized upon by investors,\" he added.\n\nFactors driving price appreciation\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nAnalysts see more factors involved in bitcoin's recent price spike. Apart from anticipation over the possible approval of a spot bitcoin ETF, these include bullish movements in the macroeconomic environment, such as major U.S. indices clocking their longest winning streaks in two years, and a shift in the bitcoin market share from short-term holders to long-term holders.\n\n\"This bullish attitude is caused by the synergy of ETF approval expectations and optimism in the U.S. stock market. I think we have a great chance to see a $40,000 level for bitcoin in the near future,\" YouHodler Chief of Markets Ruslan Lienkha told The Block.\n\nLienkha added Thursday's rally looks like it will sustain, \"as interest rates for stablecoins are skyrocketing in the crypto world right now.\"\n\nMajor stock indices post in multi-week gains\n\nRisk assets are catching tailwinds in the wider economy. On Wednesday, the S&P 500 logged its eighth straight session in the green, and the Nasdaq clocked its ninth straight day of gains, its longest winning streak in two years.\n\nYet, James Butterfill does not perceive today's market rally as a response to broader market events. \"Bitcoin has been gradually decoupling from equities since the beginning of 2023, so the correlation between bitcoin and equities has significantly dropped from 72% to just 20% as of now,\" he said.\n\nFRNT Financial Head of Data Strahinja Savic highlighted blockchain data revealing a decline in bitcoin short-term holder supply, with the trend contributing to an upward price trajectory during a phase of increased demand. \"For instance, 69% of bitcoin has moved for over a year, suggesting the majority of investors hodling,\" he noted."

This development follows the recent establishment of the corporate entity \"iShares Ethereum Trust\" in Delaware, suggesting the imminent submission of a spot Ethereum ETF application.\n\nBlackRock enters a competitive arena where various financial firms, including VanEck, ARK 21Shares, Invesco, Grayscale, and Hashdex, are pursuing SEC approval for spot Ethereum ETFs.\n\nThe announcement triggered an 11% surge in Ethereum's value, reaching $2,123 within the last 24 hours. This surge has played a role in Ethereum regaining market dominance, currently standing at 18.1%.\n\nLet us know what you loved about this article, what could be improved, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form."

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nEthereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC) experienced a sudden downturn after what many investors saw as a promising rally. Ethereum's price on the Bitstamp exchange took a sharp dive, falling to $1,973 following a peak of $2,050 earlier in the trading session.\n\nBTC mirrored this fall, plunging down to $35,600 from its day's high of $37,972.\n\nMassive liquidations\n\nIn the span of one hour, the market saw $11.22 million worth of liquidations, according to CoinGlass data. The liquidations were almost evenly split between long positions ($5.67 million) and short positions ($5.55 million).\n\nLooking at a broader timeframe of four hours, the liquidations escalated significantly to $280.76 million. The majority of this amount came from long position liquidations, which totaled $174.08 million, compared to $106.68 million from short positions.\n\nIn a full day, the total liquidations amounted to $475.71 million. Interestingly, in this timeframe, the trend reversed, with short positions seeing more liquidations ($268.07 million) than long positions ($207.64 million).\n\nSpeculation about crypto ETFs\n\nThe crypto community is now abuzz with speculation following the registration of the iShares Ethereum Trust in Delaware.\n\nThis move is reminiscent of the registration of BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust, which occurred just a week before their formal ETF application with the SEC.\n\nThe registration is seen by many as a precursor to mainstream adoption that could potentially pave the way for increased institutional investment in Ethereum.\n\nMeanwhile, the possibility of a Bitcoin ETF in the United States seems to be gaining ground. Analyst Alex Dovbnya has reported a potential \"tsunami\" of spot Bitcoin ETF approvals by January 2024. Seyffart from Bloomberg Intelligence cites a \"90% chance\" by early January 2024."

Since the SEC has approved futures-based ether ETFs, that should make way for spot ether products, Nasdaq wrote in Thursday's filing.\n\n\"Given that the Commission has approved ETFs that offer exposure to ETH futures, which themselves are priced based on the underlying spot ETH market, the Sponsor believes that the Commission must also approve ETPs that offer exposure to spot ETH, like the Trust,\" according to the filing.\n\nUpdated at 5:10 p.m. ET with details"

Bitcoin's price has rallied over the past month due to the prospect of a spot bitcoin ETF approval. Earlier this month, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said that a rally in the price of bitcoin triggered by a false news report that said its spot ETF was approved served as an example of \"pent-up interest in crypto.\""

        "title": "The Power of Decentralization: Unpacking Ethereum's Vision - Green Bay Press Gazette",
        "content": "William Mullane\n\nContributor\n\nImagine a future where power and control are distributed among the masses rather than concentrated in the hands of a few. This is the vision of the blockchain platform, Ethereum. Driven by the mission to decentralize the web, Ethereum aims to redefine the future of technologies, democratizing the web as never seen before.\n\nAt its core, Ethereum is a decentralized platform that enables developers to build and deploy smart contracts, which are self-executing agreements with predefined conditions. These smart contracts run on a blockchain, a distributed ledger that is maintained and validated by a network of computers, or nodes, rather than a central authority. This decentralization ensures transparency, security, and resilience, as no single entity has the power to manipulate or control the system.\n\nEthereum's vision extends far beyond financial applications like cryptocurrencies. It seeks to create a global, open-source platform where developers can build decentralized applications (DApps) without relying on intermediaries or central authorities. This democratization of application development opens up a world of possibilities. Imagine a future where social media platforms are truly decentralized, putting control over data and content in the hands of users rather than centralized corporations. And would give individuals the autonomy to choose how their personal information is used and shared\u2014while fostering an environment of innovation and free expression.\n\nMoreover, Ethereum's vision has profound implications for industries beyond the digital realm. By introducing the concept of programmable money, Ethereum enables the automation of complex financial transactions, eliminating the need for intermediaries and reducing costs. This has the potential to revolutionize sectors such as remittances, lending, and insurance, making financial services more accessible and affordable for individuals around the globe.\n\nFurthermore, Ethereum's technology can play a pivotal role in transforming supply chain management. By leveraging blockchain's transparency and immutability, businesses can trace the journey of products from their origin to the end consumer. This not only ensures authenticity and quality control but also promotes ethical practices and sustainability. Try to picture a world where consumers can verify the authenticity of a product, verify its ingredients, and trace its carbon footprint with a simple scan of their smartphones. Ethereum's vision brings us closer to this reality.\n\nHealthcare is another sector that stands to benefit from Ethereum's decentralized approach. By securely storing and sharing medical records on a blockchain, patients can maintain control over their health data while enabling seamless access for healthcare providers. This could lead to more accurate diagnoses, better coordination of care, and enhanced medical research. The potential to save lives and improve the efficiency of healthcare systems is both inspiring and game-changing.\n\nTo join the decentralized revolution and be a part of Ethereum's vision, learn how to buy Ethereum and become a proud owner of this pioneering cryptocurrency. Ethereum is not just about a technological shift; it is about a shift in power dynamics\u2014a shift from the few to the many, from opaque to transparent, and from exclusive to inclusive. And, as Ethereum's vision unfolds, the implications of this shift will reshape our digital world in profound ways. This is not merely a promise of what might be but a reflection of what is already in motion, galvanizing a future where everyone has a stake and a voice. This is Ethereum's aspiration: a decentralized world empowered by its people.\n\nThis is for informational purposes only. Please invest at your own risk."

        "title": "Has Ethereum (ETH) Formed New Ground Ahead of $2,000? - U.Today",
        "content": "Disclaimer: The opinions expressed by our writers are their own and do not represent the views of U.Today. The financial and market information provided on U.Today is intended for informational purposes only. U.Today is not liable for any financial losses incurred while trading cryptocurrencies. Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEthereum (ETH) presents an intriguing case as it flirts with the psychologically significant $2,000 mark. Recently, ETH has demonstrated commendable strength, breaking through its local resistance level, which now appears to be acting as a solid support zone. This event marks a potential paradigm shift for the second-biggest asset by market capitalization in the crypto arena.\n\nThe recent price action of Ethereum tells a story of resilience and potential. After a period of consolidation, ETH has managed to surge past a resistance level that had previously capped its upward movements. This breakthrough is significant; it indicates a shift in market sentiment and establishes a new foundation upon which Ethereum may build its next climb.\n\nHistorical price patterns suggest that once a resistance level is transcended, it often transforms into a support level. For ETH, this could mean that the price level it has just surpassed may well become a launchpad for further gains.\n\nLooking at the volume profiles, the recent move upward has been accompanied by a noticeable increase in trading volume, lending credence to the breakout's sustainability. High volume is a strong indicator of genuine market movement, implying that the current price level is backed by substantial interest and participation from market participants.\n\nAs Ethereum inches toward the $2,000 level, the crypto community is abuzz with speculation about the potential for a further price movement upward. If the newfound support level holds, ETH may well have paved the groundwork for a sustained upward trajectory.\n\nShiba Inu under pressure\n\nShiba Inu (SHIB) faces a critical juncture as it hovers around the formidable 200-day Exponential Moving Average.\n\nMoving Average (EMA), a significant level that often demarcates the bullish from the bearish territories. The EMA is a trend-following indicator, smoothing out price data over a period of time and placing significant weight on recent prices. For SHIB, the challenge to break and hold above this level is substantial due to its past performance and current market dynamics.\n\nAs of the latest charts, SHIB's price hovers just below the 200 EMA, indicating a troublesome state for the token. The 200 EMA acts as a resistance level, a threshold where selling pressure is likely to be encountered. Traders and investors are watching closely to see if SHIB can muster the buying strength to break through this resistance.\n\nThe volume profile presents a mixed signal; although there has been an uptick in volume, it is not decisively high enough to confirm a robust breakout pattern. This suggests a lack of conviction among buyers, making the possibility of breaking above the 200 EMA less certain.\n\nA sustained break above the 200 EMA could open the door to a potential bullish scenario, where confidence might build and invite further buying pressure. However, without strong volume support, any attempt to rise above this level could be short-lived, potentially leading to a false breakout and subsequent sell-off.\n\nThree scenarios for Cardano\n\nCardano (ADA) has been a standout on the market thanks to outstanding price performance. Its recent price movements have caught the eye of investors and traders alike, looking to decipher the future course of ADA's valuation. Based on the provided daily chart of ADA against USD, we explore three possible scenarios for Cardano's imminent price trajectory.\n\nScenario 1: Bullish continuation\n\nThe current chart shows ADA has been on an upward trend, breaking past previous resistance levels. With the moving averages (MAs) aligning below the price and the trend appearing to move upward, there is a solid argument for continued bullish momentum.\n\nScenario 2: Consolidation before next move\n\nAfter a sharp move upward, assets often enter a period of consolidation, where the price stabilizes before the next significant move. For ADA, this could mean moving sideways as the market decides its next direction.\n\nScenario 3: Bearish reversal\n\nDespite the current bullish appearance, the possibility of a bearish reversal cannot be ignored. If ADA fails to maintain its current support level, it may signal a sell-off. A break below the recent bullish candlesticks and moving averages could indicate a trend reversal."

The rally comes amid rumors that BlackRock may soon file for an Ether ETF.\n\nThe chart shows Ethereum remains in a clear uptrend, with the 50-day SMA and 20-day EMA providing dynamic support.\n\nHowever, the RSI is overbought at 80, signaling the rally may be overextended short-term. This could lead to a pullback or consolidation as the indicator cools off.\n\nUpside resistance may emerge around the current highs and psychological levels above $2,000. Support could be present around the key moving averages.\n\nIf the uptrend continues, Ethereum could target new highs above $2,100. But overbought conditions raise the chance of a correction, which could retest previous lows if the trend shifts bearish.\n\nBlackRock registered the iShares Ethereum Trust this week, sparking speculation it will submit an ETF application to the SEC soon. The asset manager took a similar step before filing for a Bitcoin ETF."

        "content": "Stackr Labs, an Ethereum ETH +2.67% scaling startup, has raised $5.5 million in a seed funding round.\n\nArchetype led the round, with a16z Crypto Startup School, Lemniscap, Scalar Capital and others participating, Stackr said Wednesday. Angel investors including Anurag Arjun of Avail, Sreeram Kanan of EigenLayer, Mustafa Al-Bassam of Celestia Labs and Andrew Keys of Darma Capital also joined the seed round.\n\nStackr said it was the only Indian startup in a16z CSS's 2023 batch. A16z CSS is the venture capital giant's crypto accelerator program that typically invests $500,000 in participating startups in exchange for 7% equity, according to its website.\n\nIt is unclear when Stackr started raising for the seed round and when the firm closed it; a16z Crypto first tweeted about Stackr in May. Stackr founder and CEO Kautuk Kundan declined to comment on the fundraising timeline. He also declined to comment on the structure of the seed round and valuation.\n\nWhat is Stackr?\n\nStackr is developing Ethereum scaling infrastructure focused on \"micro-rollups,\" or app-specific rollups, which are aimed at helping developers launch scalable web3 applications using web2 programming languages. Stackr said that its modular framework will let developers focus solely on their application's specific logic while it manages the underlying rollup infrastructure.\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\n\"Developers will be able to use the Stackr framework to design their own state machines according to their use cases. This gives them complete freedom for designing efficient systems,\" Kautuk told The Block. \"Other Layer 2s lock the developers into their own virtual machine constraints that result in suboptimal developer experience and limit the kind of applications that are possible to be built.\"\n\nKautuk, 25, previously worked as a developer and a research and development engineer at the Ethereum Foundation. In 2022, Stackr received a Layer 2 Community Grant from the Ethereum Foundation.\n\nComparing its micro-rollups with traditional or general-purpose rollups, such as optimistic and zk-rollups, Stackr said traditional rollups resemble monolithic systems, while micro-rollups are akin to microservices or a collection of small, autonomous services that help to scale applications.\n\nStackr is currently focused on scaling Ethereum but is open to integrating other chains in the future, Kautuk said.\n\nWith fresh capital in hand, Stackr plans to expand its team and launch a testnet. The startup, which wants to bring web2 developers into the web3 space, currently employs fewer than ten people, and Kautuk looks to hire more staff across engineering, research and business development functions. Stackr also plans to set up a grant program to attract developers to build on its platform."

        "content": "William Mullane\n\nContributor\n\nIt wasn't too long ago that the cryptocurrency world felt like an exclusive club, accessible only to a select few. But then, a remarkable transformation occurred. A wave of technology swept through the financial landscape, making it as simple as swiping a debit card to invest in cryptocurrencies like Ethereum. This newfound accessibility opened up a world of possibilities for individuals from all walks of life.\n\nSo, how does one navigate the path of buying Ethereum with a debit card? It's surprisingly straightforward. The journey begins by finding a reputable cryptocurrency exchange that accepts debit card payments. These exchanges act as bridges, seamlessly facilitating the conversion of traditional currency into Ethereum. Once you've selected your preferred exchange, you create an account.\n\nNow comes the exciting part: linking your debit card to your exchange account. This process is usually user-friendly, with clear instructions guiding you along the way. You'll input your card details, such as the card number, expiration date, and CVV code. Some exchanges may require an additional layer of verification, like confirming a small charge on your card.\n\nWith your debit card successfully linked, you're ready to make your first Ethereum purchase. Simply specify the amount you wish to invest, double-check the details, and confirm the transaction. In a matter of moments, your Ethereum will find a safe haven in your exchange wallet, poised to join the world of digital finance alongside your other digital currencies like Bitcoin.\n\nThe ease of buying Ethereum with a debit card brings forth numerous advantages.

Unlike traditional bank transfers that can be sluggish, debit card purchases are swift. This quick processing time enables you to seize timely investment opportunities and make prompt decisions, taking full advantage of the dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency market.\n\nIt is important to remember that debit card transactions may incur fees, which vary across exchanges. It's essential to conduct thorough research, comparing fees and rates to find an exchange that aligns with your investment strategy. Doing so can optimize your investment potential and minimize unnecessary expenses.\n\nFurthermore, while the convenience of debit card purchases is undeniable, it's vital to approach the world of cryptocurrencies with caution.

Educating yourself about the risks involved and staying informed about market trends is paramount.\n\nAs the world embraces cryptocurrencies, the option to purchase Ethereum with a debit card has become a powerful tool for individuals seeking to explore this new frontier. With a simple swipe, the doors open to a digital realm where financial possibilities abound.\n\nSo, the next time you reach for your trusty debit card, envision the potential that lies within your grasp.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nAsset management giant BlackRock has further solidified its plans to launch an exchange-traded fund (ETF) for Ethereum.\n\nIn a filing with the Nasdaq stock exchange on Thursday, BlackRock outlined its proposal for an \"iShares Ethereum Trust\" that would allow investors to gain exposure to Ethereum's price movements through a traditional stock exchange.\n\nThe price of Ethereum jumped 10 percent following the news, blowing past $2,100, a threshold not seen since April, according to CoinGecko. Indeed, the last time ETH was this high was in May 2022, during the long crash that began in November 2021.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nETH is now up more than 30% for the month, and a solid 85% up over one year ago.\n\nThe past year of Ethereum price movements. Image: CoinGecko\n\nThe filing comes as BlackRock also registered a trust for Ethereum in Delaware, a move analysts saw as a precursor to applying for regulatory approval of an ETF.\n\nAn Ethereum ETF would allow retail investors to gain exposure to the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization without having to directly hold the asset. It could potentially open the door for billions of dollars of new investment.\n\nThe filing states that the fund's shares would trade under the ticker \"ETH\" and closely track the price of Ethereum held by the trust. BlackRock subsidiary iShares would act as the sponsor.\n\nIt is not yet clear when BlackRock intends to formally apply to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for approval of the ETF. The regulatory agency has rejected several proposals for spot Bitcoin ETFs amid concerns over potential manipulation.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut the SEC recently approved the first U.S. Bitcoin futures ETFs, seen as a step towards acceptance of funds holding the digital assets themselves. Last month, the agency also allowed the first Ethereum futures ETFs to begin trading."

        "content": "Ethereum insider, Steven Nerayoff has vowed to expose alleged fraud schemes which he claims are operating within the Ethereum network. As a result, the crypto community is keeping a close watch and Neyaroff has promised to reveal proof of his accusations in the coming weeks.\n\nUnmasking The \u201cTruth\u201d\n\nFormer Ethereum Advisor, Steven Nerayoff has announced his intentions to unveil evidence regarding the recent allegations he made against Ethereum Founders, Vitalik Buterin and Joseph Lubin in a few weeks.\n\nNerayoff stated that his legal team is working towards ensuring all information regarding the fraud claims is published properly. He said that he had developed a platform that would allow him to release all evidence without being censored.\n\n\u201cWe are making a lot of progress. Information should start flowing within weeks not months. My intent is to make everything I can public. Each can decide for themself. I created another platform that can\u2019t be censored so I\u2019ll publish here and there,\u201d Nerayoff stated.\n\nNerayoff first hinted at possible fraudulent activities at Ethereum in an X (formerly Twitter) post following news of FTX founder, Sam Bankman-Fried being convicted of fraud and conspiracy.\n\nHe alleged that the founders of the blockchain network have been directly involved with corrupt United States government officials and has vowed to expose the individuals involved, providing proof of his accusations to the public through legal and social channels.\n\n\u201cI believe these corrupt government officials will be unmasked and what we all know the public will learn,\u201d Nerayoff stated.\n\nWhile many individuals in the crypto community are looking forward to the evidence Nerayoff has announced will be disclosed in a few weeks, many community members remain skeptical, wondering if the former Ethereum Advisor has been acting out of spite or looking to gain online popularity through his claims.\n\nOne crypto user had asked if Nerayoff\u2019s case existed and why he had not filed it yet. Nerayoff\u2019s Attorney, Michael Scotto responded \u201cYes, Steven Nerayoff has a case. IT EXISTS. We will be releasing all his filings in the near future. Although I won\u2019t go into details I will say everything he has said is true and he has the receipts to prove it.\u201d\n\nNerayoff has also called out people who have relayed their doubts about his claims, stating that his court filings are under the control of his legal team and would not be published on X for legal reasons.\n\n\u201cFor those saying you haven\u2019t seen anything from me yet you\u2019re either trolling or blind. Plus you didn\u2019t read my court filings. Next court filings are in the hands of my legal team, not X,\u201d Nerayoff stated.\n\nEthereum Insider Fearless Stand\n\nIn a rather lengthy X post, Nerayoff outlined all his reasons for stating his fraud accusations against Ethereum Founders, Vitalik Buterin and Joseph Lubin. The former Ethereum Advisor stated that he was not making the fraud claims for his own benefit, rather his speaking out had a counterproductive result by making him a target and potentially endangering him.\n\n\u201cNone of this disclosure in any way benefits me!! It only makes me a target & hated by a lot of people (until they realize I was trying to save them). But I don\u2019t even care about being a target, I\u2019m numb & determined nothing will stop me,\u201d Nerayoff stated.\n\nNerayoff has disclosed that he would continue his pursuit to expose Ethereum and its founders, and he would not be deterred until he accomplishes his goal and justice is achieved.\n\nETH price breaks above $2,000 | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nFeatured image from Blokt, chart from Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

[announcement: I\u2019m moving to @SynopticCom soon] pic.twitter.com/IYafIaxMzA \u2014 Summers (@SummersThings) November 9, 2023\n\nAnalysts are thus anticipating that BlackRock is likewise on the verge of filing a new spot Ether ETF application and that this could kickstart a wave of applications from other major asset managers.\n\nETH was last changing hands around $2,040, its highest level since April.\n\nBitcoin, meanwhile, hit its highest levels of the year earlier on Thursday near $38,000, with the asset having seen a stunning 50% pump since mid-October, mostly as a result of optimism that the US SEC will soon approve spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nWith Ether up a more modest 33% from its mid-October lows, and still below its earlier yearly highs, there may be scope for a bit of \u201ccatch-up\u201d to Bitcoin.\n\nFew would be surprised to see the Ether price vault to the north of earlier yearly highs just under $2,150."

        "title": "Ethereum price hits 6-month high amid BlackRock spot ETF buzz, but where's the retail demand? - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Ether (ETH) experienced a surprising 8% rally on Nov. 9, breaking the $2,000 barrier and achieving its highest price level in six months. This surge, triggered by news of BlackRock registering the iShares Ethereum Trust in Delaware, resulted in $48 million worth of liquidations in ETH short futures. The initial announcement was made by @SummersThings on a social network, later confirmed by Bloomberg ETF analysts.\n\nThe iShares Ethereum Trust has just been registered in Delaware.\n\n\n\nFor context, BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust was registered in a similar manner 7 days before they filed the ETF application with the SEC. Details below.\n\n\n\n[announcement: I\u2019m moving to @SynopticCom soon] pic.twitter.com/IYafIaxMzA \u2014 Summers (@SummersThings) November 9, 2023\n\nThe news fueled optimistic expectations regarding a potential Ether spot ETF filing by BlackRock, a $9 trillion asset manager. This speculation follows BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust registry in Delaware in June 2023, a week prior to their initial spot Bitcoin ETF application. However, with no official statement from BlackRock, investors may have jumped the gun, though the sheer influence of the asset manager in traditional finance leaves those betting against Ether's success in a precarious position.\n\nProfessional traders placed bullish ETH bets using derivatives\n\nTo understand how professional traders are positioned after the surprise rally, one should analyze the ETH derivatives metrics. Normally, Ether monthly futures trade at a 5%\u201310% annualized premium compared to spot markets, indicating that sellers demand additional money to postpone settlement.\n\nEther 2-month futures premium. Source: Laevitas\n\nThe Ether futures premium, jumping to 9.5% on Nov. 9, marked the highest level in over a year and broke above the 5% neutral threshold on Oct. 31. This shift ended a two-month bearish period and low demand for leveraged long positions.\n\nTo assess whether the break above $2,000 has led to excessive optimism, traders should examine the Ether options markets. When traders anticipate a drop in Bitcoin\u2019s price, the delta 25% skew tends to rise above 7%, while periods of excitement typically see it dip below negative 7%.\n\nEther 30-day options 25% delta skew. Source: Laevitas\n\nThe Ether options 25% delta skew shifted from neutral to bullish on Oct. 31, and the current -13% skew is the lowest in over 12 months, but far from being overly optimistic. Such a healthy level has been the norm for the past 9 days, meaning Ether investors were anticipating the bullish momentum.\n\nThere\u2019s little doubt that Ether bulls got the upper hand regardless of the spot ETF narrative as ETH rallied 24% before the BlackRock news, between Oct. 18 and Nov. 8. This price action reflects a higher demand for Ethereum network, as reflected by the top decentralized applications (DApps) 30-day volumes.\n\nEthereum network DApps volume rank. Source: DappRadar\n\nStill, when analyzing the broader cryptocurrency market structure, especially the retail indicators, there\u2019s some inconsistency with the surging optimism and demand for leverage using Ether derivatives.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin ETF launch could be delayed more than a month after SEC approval\n\nRetail indicators point to dormant demand for ETH and cryptocurrencies\n\nFor starters, the Google searches for \u201cBuy Ethereum\u201d, \u201cBuy ETH\u201d and \u201cBuy Bitcoin\u201d have been stagnant for the past week.\n\nSearch trend for buying Ether and cryptocurrency-related terms. Source: Google Trends\n\nOne might argue that retail traders typically lag the bull runs, usually entering the cycle a couple of days or weeks after major price marks and 6-month high have been hit. However, there has been a declining demand for cryptocurrencies, when using stablecoins premium as a gauge for Chinese crypto retail trader activity.\n\nThe stablecoin premium measures the difference between China-based peer-to-peer USD Tether (USDT) trades and the United States dollar. Excessive buying demand tends to pressure the indicator above fair value at 100%, and during bearish markets, Tether\u2019s market offer is flooded, causing a 2% or higher discount.\n\nTether (USDT) peer-to-peer vs. USD/CNY. Source: OKX\n\nCurrently, the Tether premium on OKX stands at 100.9%, indicating a balanced demand from retail investors. Such a level contrasts with the 102% from Oct. 13, for instance, before the crypto total market capitalization jumped 30.6% until Nov. 9. That goes on to show that Chinese investors are yet to present an excessive demand for fiat-to-crypto conversion using stablecoins.\n\nIn essence, Ether\u2019s rally above $2,000 seems to have been driven by derivatives markets and the expectation of a spot ETF approval. The lack of retail demand is not necessarily an indicator of impending correction. However, the hype around BlackRock's Ethereum Trust registry, coupled with excessive leverage longs in ETH derivatives, raises concerns, putting the $2,000 support level to the test.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

        "title": "ETH sees price gains as Blackrock moves toward spot Ethereum ETF filing - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) joins the spot ETH league as Blackrock makes the first move towards its application\n\nThe coin\u2019s price has rallied in the market ever since the news started circulating on crypto Twitter\n\nEthereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency in the market, has seen significant gains in the past hour. The rise comes right when crypto Twitter is abuzz over a possible spot Ethereum ETF application from Blackrock \u2013 the investment management giant. The notion stems from the firm\u2019s move to register its iShares Ethereum Trust in Delaware.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nBlackrock moves ETH\u2019s market\n\nAccording to a Twitter user, Summers, who first noticed the filing, \u201cBlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust was registered in a similar manner 7 days before they filed the ETF application with the SEC. Details below.\u201d The investment management giant reignited the crypto market\u2019s dream of seeing an approved spot Bitcoin ETH by filing for an application back in June 2023. And since then, many other key financial players have joined the race with subsequent filings.\n\nBlackRock has made first step towards filing for a spot Ether ETF. I just confirmed on the website myself. Nice catch by @SummersThings https://t.co/mLKIhKdiI6 \u2014 Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) November 9, 2023\n\nAmidst this news, the second-largest crypto by market cap has breached a key price level. According to CoinMarketCap, at press time, ETH was trading at $2,040 with a market cap of $245.09 billion. The coin registered a growth of over 4 percent in the past hour and over 8 percent in the past day. Meanwhile, the 7-day chart indicated a price gain of over 12 percent, while the past 24-hour trade volume stood at $15.82 billion.\n\nMoreover, Blackrock\u2019s influence is not limited to only the ETH market. The company\u2019s spot Bitcoin ETF filing has even had the price of Bitcoin rallying in as the optimism for its approval grows. The king coin reached its highest level for this year as it breached the $37,000 level. BTC reached a high of $37,999 on Coinbase today.\n\nNotably, according to Bloomberg analysts, the SEC currently has a short window open if it wants to approve all spot Bitcoin ETF applications, starting today. This would be applications from Blackrock, Grayscale, 21Shares and Ark, Invesco & Galaxy, VanEck, Bitwise, Valkyrie, and Fidelity. If the SEC does not make a move in this time frame, it will have to decide its position by January 2024."

        "title": "Nil Foundation CEO on New Ethereum Rollup With Zero-Knowledge Proofs, Sharding - CoinDesk",
        "content": "Ethereum Research and Development Firm Mill Foundation says its new Ethereum roll up will be the first DK roll up that enables sharding. Joining us now is CEO and co-founder of Mill Foundation, Misha Komarov. Welcome to the show, Misha. Hey, it's like, thanks for having me. Thanks for being here. Now, let's talk about this. It combines zero knowledge proofs and sharding, explain what this problem solves. And just I want to put something into context here. Of course, developers watch our show, but we have a very broad audience. So talk to us about what this problem solves and how that relates to developers, but also uh other folks who are operating in this space. OK. Let's go into it. So basically, it's like what's the basic idea of the stink? The basic idea of this thing is to try to solve is to try to break the wall gardens of all the variety of different roll ups which have, which you know, which, which you know were brought up to life, which in the recent years. So basically right now we have a lot of the roll ups. They are all you know, like completely isolated from each other. And it's good if people, you know, it's good if people consider some particular one, like, you know, a good one, like a worthwhile one. And it's like, it's absolutely tremendous that there are whole ecosystems growing on top of them. But in the end of the day, there is a lot of them, they are isolated and we try to, we try to solve this issue, this modularity issue, this uh you know, World Gardens issue by basically bringing what Ethereum, you know what, what was an Ethereum? What was an Ethereum roadmap initially like, you know, long premise charting, we tried to bring it as a ZK roll of think which you know basically solves like which basically solves the modularity concept. Yeah, modulator concept. Drawbacks. That's it. All right, le le let's take it as another step further because that ee explain why that isn't why that's an issue uh for for the lay, for the lay person out there watching this. OK. Why this is an issue? So basically it's like the more the more liquidity fragmentation, the more security fragmentation you have basically what was like, OK. What what the hell is a modular concept, right? It's basically that you have one application, one roll up, that's what it is. And it's a good idea. But the problem is that how much of liquidity can the one can a single one application attract? And what if other applications can also make use of it by increasing the total, the total good of this liquidity, the total outcome of this liquidity from this liquidity. So this means that one application one roll up is might be, you know, not the best idea. OK. So we tried to, we tried to solve this issue so the liquidity and security could stay unified because for example, for lending protocols or like for swaps like different kind of swaps, it's like it's very important to keep the liquidity pools as deep as possible to keep the lending pools as large as possible because that's what defines their economic viability for the user. So that's what it is. We try to solve this issue is keeping liquidity unified. What's the difference? I guess from a developer's perspective, if we build on nil or another roll up like polygon, Zkevm or ZK sync or are they all kind of similar? Uh It's like, let's say it this way, it's like, it's like we target, it's like we target those kinds of applications, those kinds of applications which first of all, you know, very to liquidity fragmentation. So there wouldn't be a requirement for them to keep uh you know, to keep, to keep their liquidity, you know, split. That's the first thing, second thing we target those kind of applications which are, you know, high load applications, something like, you know, it's pretty obvious for everybody right now that, you know, high load applications, I don't know, autonomous worlds OK, autonomous actors. Vita likes to talk about that much or like, I don't know this kind of things, sequencers, builders, decentralized PB, all of these things are not possible to be built, you know, on Ethereum because of the way it is built. And that's the same thing. It's not possible to be. These kind of things are not possible to be built on top of traditional roll ups. So there are, there are intersections with traditional roll ups, of course, but there are parts of, you know, there are parts and segments of applications which are only possible on now. So we try to cover, we try to cover these two parts of markets. You mentioned high load and data intensive applications here. What kind of apps do you think will thrive most in this ecosystem, you mentioned autonomous worlds? But what do you envision what kind of apps living here? Well, first of all, it's like, it's like it's like the first kind of apps which first kind of apps which which I'm personally going to push forward is going to be first of all sequencers. And well, let's say it this way, I mean, obviously, obviously financial applications and things like this. But besides that, it's sequencers, it's anything related to building and minimizing the for the for the user in a decentralized and like, you know, open way. That's what I see, like, you know, right now, that's what I'm going to talk like, right now I'm going to push for it. OK? And obviously, if we're talking about like a lot more long term vision, uh I do support the vision that, you know, I will try to put shared state applications on top of this because that's what, you know, all of those autonomous worlds and autonomous actors are about. I mean, it's like that would be really fun to put up some, you know, autonomous actor to make it smarter than just, you know, trivial and then just trivial like Perron or something. So yeah, so I, you, you, you mentioned uh uh financial application. So for, for people in the financial service industry who might be watching this and, and don't quite understand exactly what this conversation is about. Can you lay it out for them? Explain to them how this, how this would affect them? OK. So basically uh how this particular architecture, how this particular approach affects uh financial applications. OK. Let's just take a look at, I don't know lending protocols or like different swaps. So let's say you have uh let's say you have some, I don't know Unis swap or something and let's say a liquidity in a particular pool on Ethereum is quite deep enough. OK? But it's expensive to use it for like in case you need to swap something often, I mean, really expensive to use it. OK. So what's the, what's the, what's the traditional solution? The traditional solution is you deploy the UNIS swap to like, you know, some roll up, you pay less for the gas fees. You can do it more often, but a little bit of a nuance. It's like the liquidity pool on the roll up is much smaller than on the Ethereum originally. And no matter how you try, it would be really hard for you to, for you to put that liquidity from Ethereum to some roll up and to make a roll up slit pool deeper than the the one. So that what the liquidity fragmentation does to you, you know, this kind of exchanges, this kind of exchange applications. So that's what it is. And obviously the deeper the liquidity pool is the it's like the smaller uh basically this, it's like the smaller um the smaller kind of OK. Well, basically the deeper the deeper liquidity pool is the more you can exchange it OK? That's like, you know, talking in basic terms. So that's what it is. It's like the less slippage is OK? So that's why this is important. This is, that's why the absence of liquidity fragmentation is important to financial applications like on the example of a unit world, for example. So basically, it's all about making a ba basically, it's all about increasing the efficiency of those. All right, Michelle, we got to leave it there, but very quickly before we go, I wanted to see if you have any comment about the news that came out on crack in this week. It said that they're seeking a partner to help build their lay two. And according to people familiar with the situation, the Mill Foundation is one of the partners. They're considering any comments on that. I knew this question would, would arise. Uh That's the first thing. Second thing I would say it's too early to say something or not to say at all. It's like, so let's, you know, let's just leave it there, let's just leave it there. I can't state anything about this currently. All right, Misha, thank you for that. It was a pleasure and congratulations on the upcoming launch. Thanks. Thanks a lot.

        "content": "The association behind Aragon (ANT), a decentralized governance platform on the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain, is dissolving.\n\nThe Aragon Association (AA) says in a new announcement that it will deploy 86,343 ETH worth about $163 million to offer Ethereum redemptions for ANT holders.\n\nAccording to the statement, holders of the governance token may redeem their coins at a fixed rate of 0.0025376 ETH per ANT.\n\nExplains the association,\n\n\u201cThe AA arrived at the best redemption rate it could achieve for all ANT holders by identifying the most compliant and tax-efficient path forward allowing for the continuation and protection of the project. This decision could not be put to a public vote due to legal constraints, specifically regulatory risks triggered by token speculation and market manipulation.\u201d\n\nAragon aimed to serve as a framework for building decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) on the Ethereum blockchain. Its native token, ANT, allows users to vote on proposals.\n\nThe AA says tensions within the project pushed the association into a rushed effort to vest control of the treasury directly to ANT holders.\n\n\u201cHowever, too few ANT were in the hands of users, partners, and builders after years of product pivots, and a volatile gap existed between the value of the treasury and the token market cap. This put Aragon\u2019s mission in jeopardy.\n\nRather than continuing down the current path, after several months of deep introspection, we have concluded that the shaky foundations underlying the current structure cannot be fixed and have been holding back the project for too long. Neither the AA nor ANT are currently suited to govern the project.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the ETH redemptions, the AA says it will commit $11 million to cover its outstanding obligations and combat regulatory issues.

However, that seems to have changed today as the altcoin observed a rally that occurred thanks to a major development in the crypto space affiliated with Ethereum.\n\nBlackRock files for spot Ethereum ETF\n\nThe world's biggest asset management firm, BlackRock, officially filed for a spot in Ethereum ETF (Exchange Traded Fund) with Nasdaq on Thursday. The filing, pending acknowledgment and approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), marked the ETF as a Commodity-Based Trust Shares.\n\nThis was preceded by hours of anticipation from eager crypto investors who, upon discovering the potential filing, pumped the ETH market. As BlackRock filed for iShares Ethereum Trust in Delaware, signs similar to the spot Bitcoin ETF emerged. Just a week after doing the same for Bitcoin, BlackRock went on to file for a spot BTC ETF.\n\nSpot Ethereum ETF filing\n\nHowever, the fanfare was not compromised in any way, as this is the next biggest thing to occur for Ethereum since the SEC approved the ETH Futures ETFs earlier this year.\n\nRegardless, ETH is back rising on the market, and the altcoins might be able to surprise each other in time.\n\nEthereum price goes back up\n\nEthereum price, at the time of writing, could be seen breaching the $2,100 price mark, fuelled by the optimism that exploded after the BlackRock spot ETF filing emerged. The altcoin hit a nearly six-month high.\n\nUp by more than 10% in the span of a day, ETH also breached the $2,000 barrier. It is preparing to reclaim the highest price ETH has been in the past couple of months. A stabilized price rise is generally what is needed from a cryptocurrency to gain profits, and with the \"home of DeFi\" witnessing a groundbreaking filing today, a further increase might not be off the table.\n\nAt the moment, there are no immediate signs of a price correction, but if the overheated market meets impatient investors looking to profit, Ethereum price could decline naturally.\n\nETH/USD 1-day chart\n\nIf this hype fizzles out quickly, the resulting vulnerability may trigger a sell-off, potentially causing the altcoin's price to drop."

Following the slight recovery in the general crypto market, altcoins like Ethereum Classic are also rising. With the rising bullish momentum in the market,, ready for a massive rally in the coming weeks.\n\nThis analysis will provide insights into Ethereum Classic\u2019s potential price trajectory from 2023 to 2030. Furthermore, we\u2019ll give detailed information on what can affect Ethereum Classic\u2019s price soon.\n\nHowever, remember that these projections are based on actual market behavior. Let\u2019s explore the potential scenarios for Ethereum Classic\u2019s journey over the next seven years.\n\nEthereum Classic Price Prediction 2023 \u2013 2030\n\nBased on the daily chart, the Ethereum Classic token has breached above its bearish trendline . Currently, the token is testing support at $15 and trying to rally its price above the 20 and 50-day MA indicators.\n\nTesting the $15 support: Ethereum Classic\u2019s price recently went down , but it successfully reached the $15 level. If it can retest this level, it might surpass its average price and start going up.\n\nLimited Near-term Growth: Right now, it seems challenging for Ethereum Classic\u2019s price to increase significantly in the short term.\n\nSimilar to Ethereum: Ethereum Classic\u2019s price tends to follow Ethereum\u2019s price closely . Sometimes, it even reaches new highest values before Ethereum does.\n\nGood news in 2024: In 2024, important events are happening in the cryptocurrency world that can benefit Ethereum Classic. Ethereum\u2019s planned upgrade and Bitcoin\u2019s Halving event could positively affect Ethereum Classic\u2019s price.\n\nDecentralization Matters: If people start talking more about decentralization in the blockchain world, Ethereum Classic might become more popular because it\u2019s known for being decentralized. This could lead to more interest in Ethereum Classic.\n\nEthereum Classic Price Prediction Summary for 2023 \u2013 2030\n\nYear Maximum Price Average Price Minimum Price 2023 $15.50 $15 $14.72 2024 $100 $48 $15 2025 $387 $210 $120 2030 $860 $690 $520\n\nEthereum Classic Price History\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC) is a cryptocurrency that emerged from a hard fork of the Ethereum network in July 2016. The split resulted from a disagreement within the Ethereum community following the infamous Decentralized Autonomous Organization incident.\n\nThe DAO was a smart contract-based investment fund on the Ethereum blockchain but fell victim to a critical vulnerability. This led to a massive Ether (ETH) theft in July 2016, which resulted in a drift in the community.\n\nSome community members advocated a hard fork to reverse the transactions and recover the stolen funds. In contrast, others believed in preserving the immutability of the blockchain, arguing that \u201ccode is law.\u201d\n\nThose who adhered to the latter viewpoint continued with the original Ethereum chain, which became Ethereum Classic. Following the split from Ethereum in 2016, the project needed to establish its value.\n\nThis was done by listing ETC on two cryptocurrency exchanges on July 20, 2016. CoinMarketCap started recording the price of Ethereum Classic on July 24, 2016.\n\nAt that time, one unit of Ethereum Classic traded at $0.7523. This initial price helped set the foundation for ETC\u2019s value in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nSince its beginning, Ethereum Classic\u2019s price has closely followed its counterpart, Ethereum. It reached its all-time high of $176.16 in May 2021.\n\nBefore a significant upgrade on Ethereum in September 2022, Ethereum Classic\u2019s price rose from $14.20 to $41.59. However, by the end of 2022, it settled back around $15.\n\nFurthermore, in 2023, the Ethereum Classic\u2019s price has been unstable, bouncing between $15 and $23. Remember, these values can change rapidly due to the unpredictable nature of the crypto market.\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum Classic has since developed its ecosystem, community, and development teams. It shares many similarities with Ethereum, including its smart contract capabilities, but operates independently with a separate token, ETC.\n\nDespite facing various challenges and controversies, Ethereum Classic has demonstrated remarkable resilience. This is a testament to the diverse range of ideologies within the blockchain space.\n\nKey Points in Ethereum Classic Price History\n\nThe Ethereum Classic is a fork of the Ethereum chain. It split from Ethereum due to a hack in July 2016.\n\nStart Date and Initial Value (July 24, 2016): Ethereum Classic\u2019s price history began on CoinMarketCap on July 24, 2016, with an initial value of $0.7523.\n\nPrice Tracking with Ethereum: Since its inception, Ethereum Classic\u2019s price movement has closely mirrored that of Ethereum, its sibling cryptocurrency.\n\nAll-Time High and Current Status: Ethereum Classic achieved its highest price of $176.16 on May 06, 2021. As of today, it has decreased by 90.47% from this peak.\n\nThe Merge and Price Movement: Leading up to The Merge, a significant upgrade on Ethereum, Ethereum Classic experienced more considerable percentage gains than Ethereum.\n\nIts price surged nearly 193%, rising from $14.20 to $41.59. This surge was because many miners expected to shift their support to Ethereum Classic.\n\nEthereum Classic shares many similarities with Ethereum, including its smart contract.\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC) Current Price & Stat\n\nIt started the year at $15.69 and is currently at $15.21, marking a decrease of over 34%. Also, in the last 30 days, the coin has been down by 2% and around 7% in the past 14 days trading session.\n\nHowever, in the past hour, there\u2019s a sign of a favorable market as the coin is rising gradually by almost 1%.\n\nBased on its market cap of more than $2 billion, Ethereum Classic is ranked #28 amongst other crypto assets. According to CoinGecko, the trading volume is at $130,977,163, an increase of 97% in the last 24 hours.\n\nInterestingly, despite its bearish momentum, the coin is still massively above its all-time low by 2,372.71%.\n\nCurrent Market Status\n\nCurrent Price $15.22 24-Hour Price Change -0.06% 24-Hours Trading Volume $130,977,163 (97.50%) Market Cap $2,175,151,142 Current Ranking #28 Circulating Supply 140 Million tokens All-Time High $167.09 (May 06, 2021) All-Time Low $0.615038 (July 25, 2016)\n\nEthereum Classic Price Prediction 2023 \u2013 2030\n\nEthereum Classic Price Prediction 2023\n\nSince the start of 2023, the price of Ethereum Classic has ranged between $15 and $23. The price is now lower than at the beginning of the year.\n\nHowever, toward the end of September, there was a significant shift in its price performance. Importantly, Ethereum Classic has breached the solid bearish trend and is forming a new positive trendline.\n\nA rapid climb above key indicators marked this positive trend, the 50-day and 20-day Moving Averages (MAs). Following this positive move, Ethereum Classic\u2019s price climbed to $16.71.\n\nSubsequently, the price dipped below the Moving Averages and is now testing the $15 support level. This level may serve as a turning point, where the price could stabilize or begin to rise again.\n\nNotably, if the Ethereum Classic token could build up intense energy to stay above this support and maintain the trendline for a few days, we can likely see a bullish move.\n\nBased on this, we anticipate the price of Ethereum Classic to reach a high of $17 or an average of $15.50. However, if Ethereum Classic\u2019s price faces challenges at the MAs, it may fall back to $15 since investors are willing to buy the coin at this price.\n\nMeanwhile, if the support doesn\u2019t hold or the momentum is not strong, it could trigger further downward pressure on the coin. If both the lack of support at $15 and the MAs resistance persist, it could create a bearish market sentiment.\n\nImportantly, this could send the price of Ethereum Classic to a low of $14.72.\n\nEthereum Classic must overcome significant challenges and obstacles to record substantial price gains. Based on this, we predicted that Ethereum Classic\u2019s price will stay relatively high.\n\nInstead, it could trade within a narrow range from now to the end of 2023. The projected range is between $15.50 (the highest it might go) and $14.72 (the lowest it might reach).\n\n2023 Price Prediction Maximum Price $15.50 Minimum Price $14.72\n\nEthereum Classic Price Prediction 2024\n\nDue to the upcoming Bitcoin Halving set to occur in April 2024, there are high expectations of a crypto bull market. The Bitcoin Halving is an event that slashes the rewards miners receive for verifying transactions in half.\n\nImportantly, this event happens approximately every four years.\n\nBased on historical price moves, the price of Bitcoin tends to increase due to this event steadily. Since Bitcoin is the mother of altcoins, its price movements often have a ripple effect on the entire cryptocurrency market.\n\nRecall that in the last bull run, which started around the time of the previous Bitcoin Halving, ETC reached an all-time high of $176.16.\n\nEthereum Classic needs a well-defined roadmap for its future development, making it challenging to predict (DeFi) ecosystem developments that could impact its future price. Also, the coin stands out from other cryptocurrencies because it has never had a formal roadmap.\n\nThis sets Ethereum Classic apart from crypto assets that face scrutiny when they lack a clear plan for their future. Therefore, Ethereum Classic experiences less pressure on its price due to the absence of a roadmap.\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum Classic closely watches Ethereum\u2019s price. Ethereum will start testing some significant improvements related to scaling in late 2023, which they call proto-dank sharding. They plan to implement these changes in 2024.\n\nIf all goes well, this could increase Ethereum\u2019s price, and Ethereum Classic will likely increase. Ethereum Classic will apply these changes to its system about 3 to 6 months after implementing them on Ethereum.\n\nConsidering all this, our prediction for Ethereum Classic\u2019s price in 2024 is optimistic. It could reach as high as $100, with a potential year-end fee of $48. At the start of the year, it might be lower, around $15.\n\nEthereum Classic Price Prediction 2025\n\nIf a strong market trend begins in 2024 due to Bitcoin Halving, it\u2019s likely to continue into 2025. During this time, many coins might reach their highest-ever prices.\n\nIn the past, Ethereum Classic has often followed a similar pattern to Ethereum, sometimes even hitting new high prices before Ethereum does.\n\nConsidering Ethereum\u2019s growing popularity and role as the second cryptocurrency, it\u2019s expected to hit a new all-time high in the next bull market.\n\nAlso, ETH could increase significantly with its rise as a preferred proof-of-stake coin and a limited supply asset in the last year.\n\nBased on our projection of Ethereum\u2019s price increasing by 120%, we anticipate Ethereum Classic could reach a top price of $387 in 2025. The lowest price might be around $120, while the average price could be about $210.\n\nEthereum Classic Price Prediction 2030\n\nMany things can influence what might happen to Ethereum Classic\u2019s price in 2030. One major factor is whether cryptocurrencies become widely used by then.\n\nImportantly, if more people start using cryptocurrencies, it\u2019s good news for all crypto, including Ethereum Classic. Additionally, Ethereum Classic could benefit from the growing interest in decentralized solutions, leading to high demand that could drive prices higher.\n\nThe following sections will show that Ethereum Classic is the original, unchanged version of Ethereum. This means that if trust in centralized systems decreases, Ethereum\u2019s history might make people favor Ethereum Classic instead.\n\nEthereum Classic usually follows a similar path as Ethereum, adopting similar upgrades a few months later. This makes it easy for apps and services to switch to Ethereum Classic, potentially bringing more users and increasing demand.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s a concern about how people view proof-of-work blockchains due to their environmental impact. This issue might not improve by 2030. This could lead Ethereum Classic to go in its own direction, separate from Ethereum.\n\nConsidering all this, our guess for Ethereum Classic\u2019s price in 2030 is that it might hit new highest prices, going as high as $860. Meanwhile, the lowest might be around $520, and the average price could be about $690.\n\nPotential Highs & Lows of the Ethereum Classic Price\n\nEthereum Classic wants to be like Ethereum, but it has its own story. Even though it\u2019s a separate coin, it follows the price of Ethereum closely.\n\nWe have to think about what\u2019s happening with Ethereum to guess what might happen to Ethereum Classic. Here\u2019s a short overview of our guesses about Ethereum Classic\u2019s price.\n\nYear Potential Low Price Average Price Potential High Price 2023 $14.72 $15 $15.50 2024 $15 $48 $100 2025 $120 $210 $387 2030 $520 $690 $860\n\nOther Analysts Prediction on Ethereum Classic\n\nDifferent sources have another prediction on Ethereum Classic\u2019s future price:\n\nFirstly, the Cryptopolitan thinks Ethereum Classic might reach $50.94 in 2025 and $317.96 in 2030. Also, by 2032, they predicted the coin to achieve a high of $705.99.\n\nAccording to Changelly, it could hit a high of $317.93 by the end of 2030, with an average price of $237.65.\n\nFurthermore, Wallet Investor has a less optimistic view, suggesting it might drop much in value to around $0.195 by October 2028.\n\nMeanwhile, Coincodex believes it could reach $33.57 in 2025 and $34.98 in 2030. They also expect $74.29 in 2024 and $100.97 in 2028 due to the Bitcoin Halving.\n\nTraders Union has more moderate predictions, estimating prices of $20.54 in 2025 and $33.14 in 2030.\n\nRemember, these predictions above are based on assessments and forecasts made by various sources. They are speculative and do not guarantee ETC\u2019s future performance.\n\nWhat is Ethereum Classic and its Uses?\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC) is an open-source, decentralized, and blockchain-based computing platform and cryptocurrency birthed due to a hard fork from the Ethereum blockchain in 2016.\n\nOrigin of Ethereum Classic\n\nEthereum Classic originated from the Ethereum blockchain conceived by Vitalik Buterin and the Ethereum Foundation and launched in 2015.\n\nEthereum Classic was created after The DAO hack in 2016, which resulted in the loss of millions of dollars worth of Ether. The dispute caused a split in the Ethereum community, with the majority choosing to reverse the hack.\n\nWhat is Ethereum Classic?\n\nEthereum Classic is a decentralized platform that uses smart contracts embedded within a distributed ledger. Smart Contracts are self-executing autonomous digital applications, based on the principle of \u201cCode is Law,\u201d which can run on their own as programmed.\n\nWhy is Ethereum Classic Used?\n\nThe ETC or Ethereum Classic asset facilitates payments for decentralized computations on the Ethereum network. The project aims to develop a global payment network based on smart contracts that can operate with no centralized authority.\n\nEthereum Classic, like other cryptocurrencies, will aspire to be a digital store of value, meaning you can save and exchange it while maintaining its weight.\n\nWhat are the goals of Ethereum Classic?\n\nEthereum Classic aims to provide a platform for developers to build decentralized applications (dApps) that can run on a blockchain. Ethereum Classic aims to provide a secure and decentralized platform for developing smart contracts.\n\nIt aims to provide a platform for developing decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.\n\nHow is Ethereum Classic Different from Ethereum?\n\nEthereum Classic and Ethereum are similar in terms of basic functionalities. Developers can use the open-source code to develop and run their apps.\n\nEthereum Classic preserves the old code of the Ethereum blockchain as it was until the DAO attack. People often regard it as the \u201coriginal\u201d Ethereum crypto. Ethereum Classic is an attempt to preserve the originality of Ethereum.\n\nFactors Influencing the Price of Ethereum Classic?\n\nDue to the relationship between Ethereum Classic and Ethereum, ETC\u2019s price is influenced mainly by the cost of Ethereum. This means that when Ethereum makes any significant move, it affects the price of Ethereum Classic.\n\nSimilarly, the upcoming Bitcoin Halving could influence the price of the general crypto market. Importantly, this bullish move is estimated to continue until 2028. As a result, altcoins like ETC could record new all-time highs.\n\nFurthermore, public statements about Ethereum Classic could significantly impact the coin\u2019s price. For instance, in 2022, a significant endorsement from Vitalik Buterin led to a 20% increase in Ethereum Classic\u2019s price.\n\nHe recommended Ethereum Classic for those who prefer a system called proof-of-work. Buterin states, \u201cIf you like proof-of-work, you should use Ethereum Classic.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, as the Ethereum Classic community and its uses expand, the coin becomes more valuable and attracts more users. Note that when more people actively use it, it encourages others to join in, increasing the demand for the coin.\n\nThis growing activity and interest contribute to potential price movements.\n\nEthereum Classic has been a victim of a series of attacks. This affected its price significantly, dropping from $7.40 to $5.12 in 2020.\n\nIs Ethereum Classic a Good Token to Buy?\n\nBased on this analysis, Ethereum Classic\u2019s price might remain unchanged. The coin may likely finish this year trading around $15.\n\nHowever, in 2024, things could get interesting. With the Bitcoin Halving and upgrades on Ethereum, Ethereum Classic could reach $100.\n\nAs we head into 2025, during a period of solid growth in the crypto market, it might reach as high as $387. By 2030, Ethereum Classic\u2019s price might surge massively, hitting the $860 level.\n\nRemember, these are just projections, and many things can change. The crypto market can be very unpredictable, so prices could go down instead, leading to potential losses.\n\nConclusion\n\nEthereum Classic\u2019s strong connection to the second-largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum, brings positive vibes to its future predictions despite initial doubts due to its name.\n\nSticking to its current proof-of-work consensus mechanism might pose challenges ahead. Yet, if the importance of decentralization grows, Ethereum Classic could stand out as a preferred choice, mainly due to its compatibility with Ethereum.\n\nKeep in mind that the future of any cryptocurrency can be uncertain, so always approach with caution and do thorough research."

        "content": "CELESTIA POSTSCRIPT: Rarely are blockchain projects alone in the pursuit of hot new ideas. That's true of the au courant rush by various efforts to provide \"modular\" solutions for handling the various tasks of a blockchain, including the job of \"data availability,\" which involves managing growing reams of data and efficiently providing it to users or applications when requested. The data-availability network Celestia dominated the headlines last week, especially with the buzzy airdrop of TIA tokens garnering interest from crypto traders. This week, a rival project, Avail, announced a new incentive program on a test network to encourage early adopters to \"battle-test our code base.\" And Near Foundation, hosting an annual conference this week in Lisbon for the layer-1 blockchain NEAR Protocol, announced its own plans to offer a data-availability network for the Ethereum ecosystem. Despite the interest from solutions providers, early usage of Celestia appears to be modest so far. Galaxy Research's Christine Kim wrote in a newsletter on Nov. 3: \"Now that Celestia has launched, the true value of the protocol will come from the rollup ecosystem that is created over the next few months and years on top of Celestia. The adoption of the rollups built on top of Celestia will dictate the revenue and long-term success of the protocol, and ultimately, prove (or disprove) the blockchain modularity thesis. \""

        "content": "Investigations have uncovered the mysterious owner of a crypto wallet that lost the keys to a $450 million fortune in Ethereum (ETH).\n\nAccording to Coinbase director Conor Grogan, the owner of this wallet is Rain Lohmus, co-founder of LHV Bank. The wallet contained as much as 250,000 ETH, most acquired during the coin\u2019s Initial Coin Offering (ICO) in 2014.\n\nOne mystery solved: This address (which now holds $450M of crypto) belongs to Rain Lohmus, founder of LHV Bank Unfortunately he lost his keys and can't access these 100s of millions. If you can help him recover them somehow, he's willing to split them with you https://t.co/wYLAU9gKzb pic.twitter.com/0A1nIjFSyn \u2014 Conor (@jconorgrogan) November 6, 2023\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nRain Lohmus and Recovery Strategy\n\nLosing the keys to wallet addresses is not uncommon in the crypto ecosystem. Infact, according to a computation made by Conor, a minimum of 909,800 ETH with a valuation of over $1.73 billion remains lost on-chain. This accounts for 0.73% of all circulating Ethereum supply.\n\nOne distinguishing trait of Rain Lohmus is that he has chosen not to give up on the push to recover the asset. He has a strategy to power the recovery, but according to what appears as an interview excerpt shared by Conor, he wants as much help as he can get, from anyone.\n\nWhile he said he\u2019s open to any offers from the public on how to recover the funds, he revealed his best plan is to build \u201cRain Lohmus\u201d as an AI to see if his memories can come back to remember the lost keys.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nDaunting as this task is, the LHV Bank founder said he takes it easy on himself. Lohmus acknowledged the possibility of spending a decade trying to hack this challenge and achieving zero results. Based on this, he said he\u2019d rather embrace solutions where he can get visible progress daily.\n\nFor anyone who can help him recover the funds, Lohmus plans to split the funds as compensation.\n\nOnly Untouched ICO Wallet for Now\n\nRecently, we have seen some Ethereum ICO wallets coming alive, but Conor noted that in his research, the Rain Lohmus wallet remains the only address from this era that has stayed dormant.\n\nBased on previous discoveries, the wallet acquired $75,000 worth of ETH at the 2014 ICO and has never made a single transaction. The wallet, over the years, received an intriguing bonus worth $6.5 million just for HODLing, the earlier acquired ETH."

        "title": "Ethereum Breaks Above $2,000 As BlackRock Announces Spot Ethereum ETF Initiative - Coinpedia Fintech News",
        "content": "In the last few minutes, the price of Ethereum broke above the much-anticipated psychological mark of $2,000. This significant increase in value is a reaction to the recent announcement by BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, of its intention to launch a spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nBlackRock Follows Ethereum After Spot Bitcoin ETF\n\nThe Ethereum community and the market have eagerly anticipated a breakthrough, and it has arrived with Ethereum\u2019s price finally vaulting over the $2,000 resistance level. This rally comes in the wake of BlackRock\u2019s increased involvement in the crypto space. The asset management giant has now extended its product offerings to include a spot Ethereum ETF, shortly after filing for a Bitcoin ETF. This expansion into crypto products by BlackRock marks a significant milestone for Ethereum.\n\nBlackRock, the behemoth in asset management with assets over $9 trillion under management, has made a decisive move as it registered an Ethereum trust in Delaware. This development comes following a similar initiative for Bitcoin, where the financial giant registered the iShares Bitcoin Trust. Notably, this registration took place just a week before BlackRock submitted an ETF application for Bitcoin to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), suggesting a pattern that could foresee the future of Ethereum\u2019s ETF proposal.\n\nThe Ethereum trust registration by BlackRock is a significant indicator of institutional interest in the asset, as it simplifies the process for investors to gain exposure to Ethereum without the complexities of direct trading. The move is seen as an acknowledgment of Ethereum\u2019s growing dominance and potential for inclusion in mainstream investment strategies.\n\nFollowing the announcement, the price of ETH reached a peak of $2,050 on the Binance exchange.\n\nWave Of ETF Approvals Incoming\n\nEven though the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) hasn\u2019t given the green light to any bitcoin ETFs that directly invest in bitcoin, people in the market are really excited about the possibility. The price of bitcoin soared to its highest point in a year and a half when there was news that BlackRock and other companies might get approval soon. As BlackRock, the biggest asset manager globally, now shows interest in an Ethereum product, the same excitement is expected.\n\nThe SEC in the United States has the opportunity to give the go-ahead to twelve proposed spot Bitcoin ETFs over the coming week, with decisions possible up until November 17. Bloomberg analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas pointed out that this period starting from November 9 is a chance for the SEC to approve these applications, which also covers Grayscale\u2019s plan to turn its GBTC trust into an ETF.\n\nARK Invest and 21Shares previously took a notable step in the ETF market by filing for a spot Ethereum (ETH) ETF."

        "content": "Ryan Sean Adams, a vocal Ethereum commentator and crypto investor, is bullish on MATIC, the native token of Polygon. Taking to X on November 8, Adams said MATIC should be a top-10 crypto asset, adding that people are asleep on layer-2s.\n\nPolygon (MATIC) Remains In An Uptrend\n\nWhen writing on November 8, MATIC is among the top 15 most valuable coins by market cap. It also remains volatile, fluctuating, and moving up and down the market cap leaderboard rankings. Even so, considering its spot valuation exceeding $7.3 billion according to CoinMarketCap (CMC), a crypto tracker, MATIC remains relatively liquid with a broad user base.\n\nEtherscan data on November 8 shows that there are 629,967 MATIC holders, down roughly 2%, but the number remains higher despite the contraction following the crypto winter of 2022, which spilled over to 2023.\n\nAs of November 8, MATIC is up 60% from September 2023 lows. According to CMC, the coin is also up 13% on the last trading day, pushing weekly gains to over 27%. Looking at the candlestick arrangement in the daily chart, the uptrend momentum is strong, and buyers appear to be doubling down.\n\nPresently, bull bars are aligned along the upper BB, suggesting that there is intense buying pressure. At the same time, MATIC is within a bullish breakout formation, breezing past August highs.\n\nPolygon, a sidechain, is among the many scaling solutions for Ethereum. The platform is compatible with Ethereum, allowing protocols to build on Polygon while enjoying the high activity and security of the first smart contract network. Polygon is also considered a layer-2, though it isn\u2019t technically a layer-2 since it doesn\u2019t depend on roll-ups like Arbitrum or OP Mainnet.\n\nTime To Double Down On MATIC And Layer-2 Tokens\n\nIn Adams\u2019 view, considering layer-2 tokens, including MATIC or ARB, at spot levels could translate to more gains in the next bull run. Nonetheless, it should be noted that MATIC, for instance, is down 72% from 2021 highs.\n\nMoreover, the coin is trending inside June\u2019s bear trade range. A comprehensive close above this level may signal the end of the bear run, possibly anchoring buyers targeting $1.5.\n\nIn late October, Polygon Labs officially launched the POL, a token that will prime Polygon 2.0, Ethereum, signaling the first steps to see MATIC gradually phased out. POL will serve more roles in Polygon 2.0, specifically powering an ecosystem of zero knowledge-based layer-2 chains using Polygon\u2019s infrastructure. News of this smart contract launch seemed to have catalyzed demand, driving token prices higher.\n\nFeature image from Canva, chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "The Ethereum network has usually been criticized for the number of failed transactions that occur on it and how it leads to users losing their money as a result of this. This onslaught was recently renewed after a figure in the crypto community showed the staggering amount that has been lost from failed transactions.\n\nETH Users Lose Over 100,000 To Failed Transactions\n\nIn a post on his X (formerly Twitter) platform, the Marketing and Communications Director of Blockstream, Fernando Nikoli\u0107, shared a screenshot that showed that Ethereum users had lost over $100,000 due to failed transactions. Interestingly, the $100,000 value happened to be only for the top 10 transactions in the screenshot, with Nikoli\u0107 noting that there were other ones.\n\nFrom the screenshot, one can see how a particular user lost over $38,000 in gas fees from a single transaction. The second user on the list lost over $17,000 in gas fees, with others on the list also losing thousands of dollars in gas fees despite the fact that the transaction failed. Usually, gas fees paid on the Ethereum network are gone forever, irrespective of whether the transactions succeed or fail.\n\nNoteworthily, eight out of the transactions from the screenshot occurred back in May during the period of the frenzy around the meme coin PEPE, which caused an unusual surge in traffic on the Ethereum network.\n\nFailed transactions are known to occur rampantly during such periods because a surge in activity on the network leads to a significant increase in gas fees, with some users falling short of the required gas fee (at the point of executing their trade) needed to process a transaction, which causes it to fail.\n\nETH price steady at $1,880 | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nCoordinated Attack On Ethereum?\n\nIn his post, Nikoli\u0107 referred to the failed transactions on the Ethereum network as \u201chot garbage.\u201d Although his post could just be about a concerned member of the crypto community calling out the network, it bears mentioning that he happens to be the second Bitcoin maximalist calling out the network in the space of a week.\n\nAnother Bitcoin maximalist, Bit Paine, had earlier suggested that the network was a scam. The crypto pundit hinted that the Ethereum network has helped facilitate the creation of several \u201cdigital penny\u201d stocks, which he also referred to as unregistered securities.\n\nHowever, both statements could be unrelated and simply two astute members of the Bitcoin community, showing why they believe Bitcoin remains supreme.\n\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum is trading above $1,800, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.\n\nFeatured image from BlockWorks, chart from Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "Ethereum Layer 2's Rise Towards Mass Adoption - BSC NEWS",
        "content": "This guest research article from Footprint Analytics explores one of the hottest topics in the cryptocurrency world - Ethereum Layer 2 Scaling\n\nThe vision of a secure and user-friendly decentralized internet, supported by a shared economic framework and embraced by billions, relies on developing critical infrastructure. Scaling solutions, known as Layer 2, play a crucial role in constructing this foundation and enhancing Ethereum's capabilities. These projects work together, forming a robust ecosystem that propels Ethereum towards its full potential.\n\nIn this article, we will delve into the innovations and narratives surrounding Layer 2 networks. We will discuss the challenges faced by these networks and their potential transformative impact on Ethereum's mass adoption. Our analysis will be based on data from Footprint Analytics' Layer 2 research page, providing valuable insights into this evolving ecosystem.\n\nWhy Do We Need Layer 2?\n\nBlockchain technology has long been praised for its desirable qualities of decentralization, security, and scalability. However, the \"blockchain trilemma\" suggests that achieving all three simultaneously within a simple architecture is challenging. Ethereum, which currently processes over 1 million transactions per day, often faces high transaction fees due to increasing demand. To address this issue, Layer 2 networks have emerged as an innovative solution.\n\nThe primary objective of Layer 2 networks is to enhance transaction throughput by achieving higher transactions per second (TPS) while maintaining decentralization and security. These networks achieve this by consolidating multiple off-chain transactions into a single layer 1 transaction. As a result, transaction fees are significantly reduced, making Ethereum more accessible and inclusive for a wider range of users.\n\nDifferent Types of Layer 2\n\nCurrently, there are three main types of Layer 2, including rollups, state channels and plasma.\n\nRollups\n\nRollups are layer 2 solutions that aggregate numerous transactions into a single transaction on layer 1, resulting in user cost savings by distributing transaction fees across participants within the rollup. There are two main types of rollups: optimistic rollups and zero-knowledge rollups (ZK-rollups). Optimistic rollups utilize fraud proofs to ensure the validity of off-chain transactions, while ZK-rollups employ zero-knowledge proofs to enhance privacy and security.\n\nExamples of optimistic rollups include Arbitrum(Arbitrum One), Optimism(OP Mainnet), and Base.\n\nArbitrum, introduced by the Offchain Labs team in August 2021, has emerged as a prominent player in the industry, capturing a market share of over 50%. With its Nitro upgrade, Arbitrum has achieved full Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) equivalence, enabling developers to seamlessly migrate smart contracts from Ethereum to Layer 2 with minimal or no modifications required.\n\nOptimism, the second-largest Ethereum Layer 2 solution, soft-launched its mainnet in January 2021 and became fully accessible to everyone in December 2021. Built with an EVM-equivalent architecture, Optimism offers a seamless scaling solution for Ethereum applications without encountering significant challenges.\n\nBase, built on OP Stack in collaboration with Optimism, went live on the mainnet in July 2023. Within a few months, it achieved significant success, securing the third position in the Layer 2 market. Incubated by Coinbase, Base leverages Coinbase's expertise in building crypto products.\n\nOn the other hand, ZK-rollup implementations include zkSync Era, Starknet, Linea, and Polygon zkEVM.\n\nzkSync Era, recognized as the world's first zkEVM blockchain, launched on the mainnet for all users in March 2023 and swiftly secured the fourth position in the Layer 2 market in terms of market share. zkSync Era has established itself as the dominant rollup solution in terms of user activities, including TPS and transactions.\n\nStarknet went live on mainnet in November 2021. It achieves secure low-cost transactions and high performance by using the STARK cryptographic proof system. Starknet is powered by Cairo and as such is not EVM compatible. Efforts are underway to enable compatibility between Solidity and Cairo through the transpiler Warp.\n\nLinea, a ConsenSys-powered Layer 2 solution, went live on the Ethereum mainnet in July 2023. It offers EVM compatibility, making it easy for developers to migrate and build applications on its network.\n\nPolygon zkEVM public beta was launched in March 2023 and it provides EVM equivalence. Polygon, previously known as Matic, is a blockchain platform offering diverse blockchain solutions. Polygon zkEVM is one of the offerings from Polygon.\n\nState channels\n\nState channels are a mechanism that allows participants to conduct fast and unrestricted off-chain transactions, settling the final outcome on the Ethereum blockchain. This approach reduces network congestion, fees, and transaction delays.\n\nThe Raiden Network is an off-chain scaling solution that focuses on researching state channel technology, defining protocols, and developing reference implementations. It enables near-instant, low-fee, and scalable payments, making it compatible with any ERC20 token on Ethereum. The network aims to enhance scalability and usability while maintaining compatibility with the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nPlasma\n\nA plasma chain is an independent blockchain that is connected to the main Ethereum chain through anchoring, and it utilizes fraud proofs, similar to optimistic rollups, to resolve disputes.\n\nThe OMG Network utilizes Layer-2 Plasma architecture, which offers robust safety assurances and high throughput. It provides a scalable solution for third-party developers interested in building decentralized payment applications on the Ethereum platform.\n\nData Insights\n\nA consensus is forming: Ethereum will reach mass adoption, a matter of when, not if. So, how far is it?\n\nSimilar to the diffusion of other technologies, the adoption trajectory of Ethereum can be described by a classic bell curve. It begins with a limited number of innovators who are quick to embrace the technology, followed by the engagement of early adopters. As Ethereum continues to evolve and mature, it gradually expands its reach to encompass the early and late majority, leading to a mass adoption phase. Ultimately, the technology reaches the remaining segment of the population, referred to as the laggards, in its final phase of adoption.\n\nLet\u2019s explore the impact Layer 2 has on the mass adoption of Ethereum from these aspects:\n\nTVL\n\nTotal value locked, or TVL, is anticipated to be the leading indicator of where adoption will occur.\n\nAs of October 2023, Arbitrum is leading the pack, with an impressive TVL of $6.00 billion and a market share of 61.03%, solidifying its position as the dominant player in the market. Optimism follows behind with a TVL of $2.60 billion and a market share of 26.41%, showcasing its substantial adoption and user engagement.\n\nOther chains form the second echelon but their market shares fall far behind \u2013 less than 5%. Base, the newcomer, which was launched on the mainnet for everyone on July 13, 2023, secures the third spot with a TVL of $462.91 million. The zkSync Era network holds the fourth position with $450.87 million locked, while Starknet occupies the fifth place with a TVL of $135.27 million.\n\nUnique users and transactions\n\nUser activities, such as the number of unique users (referred to as \"bridgers\" who interact with Ethereum) and the volume of transactions, serve as key adoption indicators for adoption.\n\nAmong the various Layer 2 solutions, zkSync Era stands out as the frontrunner. It has accumulated an impressive 2.67 million unique users, accounting for 37.10% of all rollups, and facilitated 2.23 million transactions, representing 50.84% of rollup activity. zkSync Era's initial airdrop activity attracted a significant number of users, and it has maintained its leading position since then. Starknet follows closely in terms of transaction volume, with 1.70 million transactions, constituting 23.70% of rollup activity.\n\nBase and Linea, both launched on the mainnet in July 2023, have gained remarkable popularity in the market. They have surpassed Optimism and Polygon zkEVM in terms of both unique user engagement and transaction volume.\n\nThroughput\n\nOne of the primary scaling challenges frequently discussed in the blockchain community pertains to transaction throughput.\n\nAt present, the Ethereum Mainnet has a capacity of approximately 15 transactions per second (TPS). In contrast, Visa boasts the ability to handle around 24,000 TPS, while Mastercard can process 5,000 TPS.\n\nLayer 2 is bridging the gap for Ethereum. In October, the average TPS achieved by prominent rollups like Arbitrum and zkSync Era ranged from approximately 9.5 to 10, making them the closest in performance to the Ethereum network among the rollup solutions available. Rollups have collectively made significant contributions to scalability, surpassing the Ethereum mainnet by 321% in throughput, with a scalability factor of 4.21 in October.\n\nWhile rollups contribute to scalability, no individual rollup currently surpasses Ethereum in terms of throughput. In a bear market, attracting and retaining users is challenging for both Layer 1 and Layer 2 networks. Building a prosperous Layer 2 ecosystem requires not only robust solutions but also high-traffic applications. Additionally, the user experience suffers due to the lack of seamless interaction between multiple Layer 2 solutions and between Layer 1 and Layer 2, for example, necessitating wallet switching and incurring liquidity costs.\n\nCost\n\nThe adoption of layer 2 networks has played a crucial role in reducing network fees on Ethereum. By consolidating multiple off-chain transactions into a single layer 1 transaction, Ethereum has witnessed a significant decline in transaction fees.\n\nAccording to Footprint Analytics, the average transaction fee in October 2023 for rollups was currently between 3% and 10% that of Ethereum.\n\nThese figures underscore the increasing popularity and utilization of Layer 2 networks, highlighting their potential to alleviate congestion and enhance scalability on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nInnovations in Layer 2\n\nIn the dynamic landscape of blockchain technology, leading Layer 2 solutions such as Optimism, zkSync, and Arbitrum are actively pursuing innovative approaches to address persistent challenges while maintaining a focus on interoperability. These prominent players maintain a rapid pace of innovation, including technology and application, continually striving to stay ahead and retain their competitive edge in the market.\n\nThe Superchain, proposed within the Optimism ecosystem, is a network of rollup networks that share a common codebase called the OP Stack. This framework aims to establish an interoperable environment where various layer 2 networks can communicate and transact with each other, similar to how the internet enables communication between devices. By providing horizontal scalability, the Superchain addresses challenges associated with traditional multi-chain architectures. These challenges include differentiated security architectures among parallel chains, which can lead to increased systemic risk as more chains are added, and the cost of setting up new nodes for each additional chain.\n\nIn June 2023, zkSync introduced \"Hyperchains\", a novel network that operates as fractal-like instances of zkEVM. These Hyperchains run in parallel with a shared settlement on Layer 1, offering the flexibility of functioning as Layer 2 networks alongside zkSync Era or as Layer 3 Validiums. Hyperchains within the zkSync ecosystem can be developed and deployed by anyone without the need for permission. To ensure trust and seamless interoperability, each Hyperchain must be powered by the same zkEVM engine available on the ZK Stack. GRVT, a hybrid crypto exchange combining centralized and decentralized exchange benefits, will be the first hyperchain in the zkSync ecosystem. Its closed alpha version is expected to launch in November 2023, followed by the mainnet release in Q1 2024.\n\nArbitrum Stylus, launched by Arbitrum in August 2023, allows smart contract development in multiple programming languages such as Rust, C, and C++ on their Layer 2 network. In addition to Solidity, developers can now write smart contracts in languages compatible with WebAssembly (WASM). WASM enables running code from languages like Rust and C++ on the web, and with Arbitrum Stylus, on the blockchain as well. Stylus introduces a second, co-equal virtual machine that is fully interoperable with the EVM, offering a new approach to writing smart contracts.\n\nNarratives in Layer 2\n\nLayer 2 itself has emerged as a prominent narrative in the cryptocurrency space since 2022. Within the realm of Layer 2, narratives have played a significant role in shaping public perception and subsequently influencing market movements. These narratives provide insights into the future of Layer 2 and Ethereum as a whole.\n\nFully on-chain games . These games utilize the blockchain as an alternative to centralized game servers, incorporating every aspect of the game on-chain, including assets, logic, state, and storage. Starknet and COMBO(live on testnet currently) have positioned themselves as a prominent supporter of fully on-chain games within the realm of public chains.\n\n.

Starknet and COMBO(live on testnet currently) have positioned themselves as a prominent supporter of fully on-chain games within the realm of public chains. Modular blockchains. Initially, blockchains were designed with a monolithic approach, where a single blockchain handled all tasks. However, the concept of modular blockchains emerged to specialize in specific functions rather than attempting to cover everything. Celestia is the first modular blockchain network. It\u2019s ready to launch and unveiled the airdrop and launch plans in October 2023.\n\nZero gas fee . Gas fees have been a significant hurdle for the mass adoption of Ethereum. To address this pain point, GasZero(live on testnet currently) has emerged as a Layer 2 blockchain network that offers a unique solution: it charges zero gas fees for trusted end users. On GasZero, users can interact with decentralized networks and smart contracts without the need for any tokens in advance in their wallets.\n\n.

On GasZero, users can interact with decentralized networks and smart contracts without the need for any tokens in advance in their wallets. Layer 3. The concept of \"Layer 3\" in the blockchain industry does not have a widely accepted definition at the moment. Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum, believes that it is premature to establish definitive definitions because the architecture of the multi-rollup ecosystem is still evolving, and most discussions are theoretical in nature. However, Buterin has shared three visions of what Layer 3s could potentially represent in the future.\n\nLayer 2 is for scaling, and Layer 3 is for customized functionality, for example, privacy.\n\nLayer 2 is for general-purpose scaling, and Layer 3 is for customized scaling.\n\nLayer 2 is for trustless scaling (rollups), and Layer 3 is for weakly trusted scaling (validiums).\n\nChallenges Faced by Layer 2\n\nThe growing popularity of cost-effective and efficient Layer 2 networks as alternatives to the congested Ethereum network has gained considerable attention. It is crucial to maintain a robust base layer while cautiously expanding certain aspects of its capabilities. Within the Ethereum community, the evolution of technology and applications is encouraged, but maintaining a delicate balance between user-friendliness and the benefits of decentralization is of utmost importance, as emphasized by Vitalik Buterin during the Ethereum Hong Kong Hackathon in October 2023.\n\nLayer 2 networks face four critical challenges in their quest for scalability on Ethereum according to Buterin.\n\nProof system security and decentralization. Validity (ZK) proofs and fraud proofs are employed to demonstrate the legitimacy of transactions without requiring processing on the main Ethereum chain. However, validity proofs face centralization concerns due to their reliance on specific hardware.\n\nValidity (ZK) proofs and fraud proofs are employed to demonstrate the legitimacy of transactions without requiring processing on the main Ethereum chain. However, validity proofs face centralization concerns due to their reliance on specific hardware. Sequencing decentralization. These sequencers verify, order, and compress transactions for transfer to Layer 1. However, this centralized setup has drawn criticism for its potential as a single point of failure, censorship vulnerability, or susceptibility to shutdown by authorities.\n\nThese sequencers verify, order, and compress transactions for transfer to Layer 1.

They enable seamless interaction with multiple Layer 2 solutions without the need for wallet switching.\n\nThey enable seamless interaction with multiple Layer 2 solutions without the need for wallet switching. Data availability. It refers to on-chain data availability, the challenge of storing a full copy of the blockchain data to validate transactions. It is worth noting that solutions like Validiums and Optimiums are not typically categorized as Layer 2s because they do not publish data on Layer 1. Instead, they introduce additional trust assumptions on top of Layer 1.\n\nIn addition, as we mentioned earlier, no individual Layer 2 currently surpasses Ethereum in terms of throughput. It\u2019s urgent to develop the ecosystem within each network.\n\nEcosystem and dApps. Currently, Layer 2 networks host various protocols in their ecosystems, with the majority of them being in the DeFi space. By bringing in phenomenal dApps, Layer 2 networks can expand their ecosystem and attract more users, encouraging them to stay.\n\nEnding Words\n\nIn conclusion, Layer 2 networks are propelling Ethereum one step closer to mass adoption by effectively tackling the scalability and cost challenges that have hindered its progress. These networks offer innovative solutions that enhance transaction throughput and reduce fees, making Ethereum more accessible and inclusive for a wider audience.\n\nFurthermore, beyond Ethereum's Layer 2 networks, opBNB has emerged as BNB Chain's response to the scalability challenge. In September 2023, opBNB successfully completed the public launch of its mainnet. Indeed, the responses and future directions of other public chains in the face of these challenges are equally tantalizing. The key emphasis remains on ecosystem development and user attraction. The vast expanse of possibilities stretches out before us, as each chain embarks on its own unique path towards scalability and mass adoption.\n\n\u200d\n\nWhat is Footprint Analytics?\n\nFootprint Analytics is a blockchain data solutions provider.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nThe global Ethereum supply has contracted by just over 4,700 ETH, or about $9.5 million, since Monday, according to data aggregator ultrasound.money.\n\nWhile that figure pales in comparison to the cryptocurrency\u2019s massive $243.4 billion market capitalization, it is nonetheless eyebrow-raising: ETH has not experienced such a prolonged deflationary period in months, and the rally appears to have halted the token\u2019s recent inflationary spiral.\n\nAnd perhaps not coincidentally, the market currently likes what it sees when it comes to Ethereum: Earlier today, ETH touched $2,000 for the first time since July. At writing, the token sits at $2,020, up 6.7% in the last 24 hours.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSo, what\u2019s behind ETH\u2019s deflationary sea change this week? And how long can the momentum be expected to last?\n\nThanks to the fee-burning mechanism that\u2019s governed Ethereum since 2021, the more traffic on the network, the higher gas fees rise. And the higher gas fees rise, the more ETH is \u201cburned\u201d by the network, or permanently removed from circulation. That means increased traffic on the Ethereum network could lead to more ETH being removed from circulation than created on a yearly basis.\n\nIndeed, average gas fees on Ethereum have more than doubled since Sunday, according to Etherscan; at writing, for example, the average Uniswap transaction requires $16.35 worth of gas. Transferring an NFT on Rarible currently costs around $21.77.\n\nBut what accounts for the increase in activity on the network?\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNFT trading volume hit a three month high this week. Are degens flipping jpegs again? And are they to thank for Ethereum\u2019s short-term comeback? Probably not, says Alice Kohn, Glassnode\u2019s head ETH analyst\u2014those bumps may be a red herring.\n\n\u201cThere has been a surge in NFT-related activities, hinting at a possible resurgence in the NFT market,\u201d Kohn told Decrypt. \u201cHowever, these activities remain relatively modest compared to the NFT boom witnessed earlier in the year.\u201d\n\nKohn does not believe that this week\u2019s ETH deflation can be attributed to minor fluctuations in NFT trading. Instead, she\u2019s found that the deflation mostly stemmed from another source: altcoins.\n\nEthereum, being the permissionless network that it is, allows for anyone to create a blockchain-based token for just about anything. These tokens, typically of the ERC-20 variety, trade on both centralized and decentralized exchanges, such as Uniswap, and make up a significant portion of the altcoin market.\n\nUniswap currently ranks as the leading gas guzzler on the Ethereum network, per Etherscan, with transactions on the protocol accounting for about 13% of all Ethereum traffic; once-dominant NFT platforms like OpenSea and Blur, which similarly led in gas fees during the NFT bull run, are hardly making a dent these days.\n\n\u201cThe latest uptick in network activities, which led to the deflationary turn for the ETH supply, clearly comes from altcoins,\u201d Kohn said. \u201cThe latest surge in interest, particularly evident in GameFi tokens, underscores the evolving landscape of the crypto market.\u201d\n\nNumerous ETH-based tokens have enjoyed substantial rallies this week\u2014LINK is up 27.2%, and PEPE is up 12%, for example. Those gains appear to be riding a macro tide that, in the last seven days, also lifted altcoins XRP, Cardano, and Solana by between 11% and 20%\u2014potentially indicating renewed investor interest in Bitcoin alternatives.\n\nSome analysts have predicted that Ethereum\u2019s altcoin-fueled deflationary run this week could signal that the bottom is in for the token, and that ETH is now set to climb towards $3,000. But Kohn isn\u2019t so certain that renewed altcoin interest is strictly a good thing for Ethereum\u2019s short-term health.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThere's a possibility that funds may flow into BTC first and then navigate down the risk curve directly into altcoins, bypassing ETH,\u201d she said. \u201cThis could position ETH in a challenging scenario, sandwiched between BTC as the premier crypto asset and more enticing risk-on altcoins.\u201d\n\nDisclaimer The views and opinions expressed by the author are for informational purposes only and do not constitute financial, investment, or other advice."

This timing suggests the Ethereum trust could likewise prelude an official ETH ETF proposal soon.\n\nBlackRock joins major contenders like VanEck in vying to establish the inaugural US Ether ETF and reap the benefits.\n\nEther has solidified itself as the second-largest cryptocurrency, with a rising real-world role in powering decentralized apps and services. This growing utility is driving demand for ETH access among traditional investors.\n\nFollowing the news, the price of ETH surged by over 5%, according to CoinMarketCap data. Ethereum has surpassed the $2,000 level. ETH is trading at $2040 at press time, with the price showing signs of volatility.\n\nIn other ETF updates, according to ETF analyst James Seyffart, bitcoin spot ETF approval odds will sit at 90% by January 2024. He believes the SEC could approve all bitcoin ETF applications simultaneously in a brief upcoming window.\n\nThe parallel Timing suggests both bitcoin and ether ETFs face increasingly favorable prospects, albeit with the SEC\u2019s typical opacity around crypto.

        "content": "Share:\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price continues to pump hard, as speculators front-run a spot BTC exchange-traded fund approval from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Ethereum (ETH) price is also showing remarkable strength, coming on the back of BlackRock hinting at a spot Ether ETF to come soon. Meanwhile, Ripple (XRP) price is showing weakness ahead of a briefing on its longstanding case against the financial regulator.\n\nAlso Read: Week Ahead: Ditch Bitcoin for these altcoins this week likely to be more profitable\n\nCrypto ETF FAQs What is an ETF? An Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) is an investment vehicle or an index that tracks the price of an underlying asset. ETFs can not only track a single asset, but a group of assets and sectors. For example, a Bitcoin ETF tracks Bitcoin\u2019s price. ETF is a tool used by investors to gain exposure to a certain asset. Is Bitcoin futures ETF approved? Yes. The first Bitcoin futures ETF in the US was approved by the US Securities & Exchange Commission in October 2021. A total of seven Bitcoin futures ETFs have been approved, with more than 20 still waiting for the regulator\u2019s permission. The SEC says that the cryptocurrency industry is new and subject to manipulation, which is why it has been delaying crypto-related futures ETFs for the last few years. Is Bitcoin spot ETF approved? Bitcoin spot ETF has been approved outside the US, but the SEC is yet to approve one in the country. After BlackRock filed for a Bitcoin spot ETF on June 15, the interest surrounding crypto ETFs has been renewed. Grayscale \u2013 whose application for a Bitcoin spot ETF was initially rejected by the SEC \u2013 got a victory in court, forcing the US regulator to review its proposal again. The SEC\u2019s loss in this lawsuit has fueled hopes that a Bitcoin spot ETF might be approved by the end of the year.\n\nBitcoin price uptrend stalls, makes $34,000 likely as markets don\u2019t pause\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price uptrend seems to have lost steam. With the king of crypto still consolidating within the confines of an ascending parallel channel, a retest of the lower boundary seems likely following weakening momentum.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator is not only moving flat but also deviating to the south, hinting at buyer exhaustion now that momentum is falling. The Awesome Oscillator (AO) histogram is also moving toward the midlines with a sustained series of red bars as seller count continues to increase. Also, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator has also crossed below the yellow band, another sell signal that arises as longs close their positions.\n\nAs such, Bitcoin price could soon break below the lower boundary of the ascending channel to potentially test the $34,000 level. If this support level fails to hold, the slump could extend to $32,000 or even the $31,190 support level. Such a move would constitute a 12% slip from current levels.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-day chart\n\nThe narrative would be different, however, if sidelined investors join the rush, with the ensuing buying pressure extending the gains for Bitcoin price. In such a turn, BTC could overcome the $35,500 barricade and move higher, breaking past the $35,984 range high.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin price trends above $35,000 after BTC survives sell off by miners\n\nEthereum price could fall out of the supply zone at $1,861\n\nEthereum (ETH) price has faced a rejection from the $1,935 level, the midline of the supply zone that extends from $1,861 to $2,004. The largest altcoin by market capitalization could soon fall out of this supplier congestion zone.\n\nA retracement to the $1,800 level or lower to the $1,748 support level seems likely, with the RSI teasing above the 70 level with a deviation to the south.\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nHowever, judging from the stance of both the AO and MACD indicators moving into positive territory, bulls still have a presence in the ETH market. Increased buying pressure from this cohort of traders could send Ethereum price past the $1,935 level, with a flip of this barrier to a support floor confirming the continuation of the intermediary trend.\n\nIn a highly bullish case, Ethereum price could extricate itself from the grasp of the supply zone above $2,004 to tag the $2,029 resistance level. A flip of this hurdle into support would set the tone for ETH to reach for the $2,141 range high, a level last tested in mid-April.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum whales scoop up the altcoin, likely to catalyze ETH price rally\n\nRipple price in recovery rally, $0.69 level is critical\n\nRipple (XRP) price is in a recovery rally, confronting the $0.69 resistance level. Depending on how the bulls play their hand, it could be a make-or-break moment for the payments token. Overcoming $0.69 would set the tone for an extension to the supply zone between $0.77 and $0.81. A break and close above its midline at $0.79 would embolden XRP to collect sell-side liquidity as it heads toward the $0.93 range high.\n\nThe RSI at 75 shows XRP is overbought, signaling traders should not open new positions but keep their existing ones open until the RSI is at the brink of crossing below 70. A closer look shows a promising deviation of the RSI as bulls fight with their last breath.\n\nMeanwhile, the histogram bars of the AO shows bulls are leading the market. The MACD also supports the outlook, moving north as momentum continues to grow.\n\nXRP/USDT 1-day chart\n\nConversely, increased selling pressure could send Ripple price south, breaching the $0.66 support before ultimately slipping below $0.59. A break and close below $0.59 would invalidate the bullish thesis, sending XRP toward a consolidation phase under $0.53.\n\nAlso Read: Ripple hits new milestone in payments, likely catalyst for XRP price"

This analysis centers around the Bitcoin Vortex bullish cross and the Bollinger Bands Width (BBW) bottoms, indicators used to determine when BTC may embark on its next parabolic rally.\n\nThe analyst\u2019s forecast is based on the upcoming Bitcoin halving event, scheduled to occur in Q2 2024. According to the analyst, this event marks the beginning of the final and most aggressive phase of the Bull Cycle\u2019s Parabolic Rally sequence.\n\nSantiment, the on-chain data analytics firm, has reported that Bitcoin has experienced a remarkable surge of +37% in just 2 months. This surge has resulted in a significant increase in the ratio of traders opening bullish positions compared to bearish positions, reaching its highest level in the past 3 months. Furthermore, the total open interest on exchanges has skyrocketed to an impressive $7.2 billion. With hopes that the fear of missing out (FOMO) will subside, it is anticipated that Bitcoin will continue its upward trajectory.\n\n\ud83e\udd11 #Bitcoin, now up +37% in 2 months, has seen its ratio of traders opening #bullish positions (vs. #bearish) hitting 3-month highs.

        "title": "Bitcoin Dominates: Overtakes Ethereum In 24H NFT Sales Volume For The First Time - NewsBTC",
        "content": "In a turn of events within the non-fungible token (NFT) market, Bitcoin (BTC) has achieved a significant milestone by surpassing Ethereum (ETH) in 24-hour NFT sales volume. This marks the first time that Bitcoin has outperformed Ethereum in this aspect.\n\nBTC\u2019s NFT Breakthrough\n\nBitcoin\u2019s recent achievement of surpassing Ethereum in 24-hour NFT sales volume signals a changing trend and growing interest in the NFT market.\n\nWhile Ethereum has long been recognized as the dominant blockchain for NFTs, Bitcoin\u2019s entrance into the space demonstrates its increasing relevance and appeal to NFT enthusiasts and collectors.\n\nThe data highlights that Bitcoin accounted for $17,291,694 in NFT sales, with 575 buyers participating. On the other hand, Ethereum recorded $26,689,252 in total sales, with 11,225 buyers.\n\nDespite Ethereum maintaining a higher total sales figure, the relatively lower wash percentage of Bitcoin suggests a potentially healthier and more organic market activity.\n\nHowever, when it comes to volatility, data from Deribit, the leading crypto derivatives exchange, shows that the spread between ETH and BTC volatility, commonly referred to as the ETH DVOL vs. BTC DVOL spread, has narrowed significantly since October 23rd from -11.6 to just -0.6. This shift indicates a change in investor sentiment and increased attention towards Ethereum and altcoins.\n\nIn light of this development, Ethereum has outperformed Bitcoin over the past fourteen days. ETH has seen significant price movement, gaining over 2% in the last 24 hours, 6% in the last seven days, and 4% in the last fourteen days, bringing its current price to $1,899.\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin has exhibited a slowdown in its upward momentum and is currently consolidating above $35,400. It has seen a 2% increase in the past 24 hours, 3% in the past seven days, and 1% in the fourteen-day timeframe.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that BTC has gained more than 82% year-to-date, while ETH has only increased by 30% during the same period, according to CoinGecko data.\n\nNasdaq 100 Correlation With Bitcoin Plummets\n\nAccording to recent Kaiko data, BTC has witnessed a significant decline in its correlation with traditional assets throughout the year. One notable development is the diminishing correlation between Bitcoin and the Nasdaq 100 index.\n\nOver the past year, Bitcoin\u2019s 60-day correlation with the Nasdaq 100 has substantially declined, plunging from over 70% in September 2022 to approximately 19% as of last week.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s negative correlation with the US dollar, which ranged from 40% to 50%, has also weakened. Currently, the correlation is around 11%, signifying a reduced tendency for Bitcoin\u2019s value to move in the opposite direction of the US dollar.\n\nWhile Bitcoin\u2019s correlation with gold has seen some upward momentum since August, the average correlation throughout the year has remained relatively low at 12%.\n\nThis suggests that the relationship between Bitcoin and gold has been modest regarding price movements and indicates a potential divergence in investment characteristics between the two assets.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock, chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

Escaping the range that it\u2019s been in for over a year, looks pretty strong.\u201d\n\nPYR was trading at $2.76 on October 19th and reached a Thursday high of $6.39 at time of writing, a more than 131% increase.

        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction as $2,000 Level Comes into Play \u2013 Best Time to Buy?\n\nThe Ethereum price has risen to $1,885 today, marking a 1% gain in 24 hours and a 4.6% increase in the past week.\n\nETH\u2019s trajectory has been upwards for several weeks now, with the altcoin also up by 18% in the last 30 days, helped by increasing market-wide bullishness.\n\nYet as the market moves into a possible bull market next year, what\u2019s especially encouraging about ETH is that it remains 61% down from its all-time high, meaning it has plenty of space for further gains.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction as $2,000 Level Comes into Play \u2013 Best Time to Buy?\n\n\n\nEthererum\u2019s indicators continue to suggest that the altcoin could rise further in the coming days and weeks.\n\nMost bullishly, its 30-day average (yellow) is rising rapidly towards its 200-day average (blue), and when it overtakes the longer term average it could signal another breakout.\n\nLikewise, ETH\u2019s RSI (purple) remains at 70, which suggests that the coin is enjoying good buying pressure yet hasn\u2019t moved into overbought territory.\n\nThe coin\u2019s support level (green) provides another bullish sign, in that it has reached higher levels in the past couple of weeks, each of which have held up against dips.\n\nAs such, ETH is likely to continue rising over the short- and medium-term, and even if it wobbles a little here and there it\u2019s likely to continue climbing for the next few months.\n\nThis is partly because the entire market is due a more bullish phase, with the next Bitcoin halving likely to increase positivity when it arrives in 2024.\n\nHistorically, #Bitcoin bear & bull markets have all taken a similar amount of time. This time around though, it seems that we're ahead of the curve, breaking key levels long before the halving event. Will we top out earlier too? pic.twitter.com/edcNJ2GKma \u2014 Jelle (@CryptoJelleNL) November 8, 2023\n\nIt\u2019s also because ETH itself remains one of the strongest altcoins in the market in terms of fundamentals.\n\nMost of the cryptocurrency industry and ecosystem revolves around the Ethereum blockchain, which accounts for more than half of the sector\u2019s entire total value locked in, and close to two thirds of this total if you include layer-two networks.\n\nOn top of this, it seems that big companies tend to go for Ethereum when using or trialling blockchain technology, as evidenced by the likes of Visa and PayPal.\n\nThis would imply that Ethereum is only likely to strengthen its position in the next few years, especially when it has transitioned to a proof-of-stake mechanism and is working on new scalability updates.\n\nAnd in turn, this is only likely to increase demand for ETH, which could reach $2,000 in the next few weeks.\n\nPromising New Altcoins\n\n\n\nThe only issue with ETH is that, as a well-established token, it may not experience massive surges during the next bull market.\n\nFor that, traders will probably need to look towards newer coins, with a variety of promising new presale tokens currently available.\n\nOne of the most promising of these is Bitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX), a tokenized cloud mining platform that has raised more than $3.6 million in its sale.\n\nRecognising a significant accomplishment for #BitcoinMinetrix! \ud83c\udf1f Exceeding the $3,600,000 milestone! pic.twitter.com/jC0RxzqnTu \u2014 Bitcoinminetrix (@bitcoinminetrix) November 7, 2023\n\nDue for launch in the next few weeks, Bitcoin Minetrix is a stake-to-mine platform.\n\nWhat this means is that users can mine actual Bitcoin by staking the platform\u2019s native token, BTCMTX.\n\nBy staking BTCMTX, users receive tokenized mining credits in return, which they can use to pay for cloud-based miners to mine BTC on their behalf.\n\nStaking more BTCMTX increases the amount of BTC users are likely to receive, and given that stakers will also receive fresh BTCMTX, Bitcoin Minetrix could be a very profitable platform.\n\nDelving into $BTC mining alongside #BitcoinMinetrix! \ud83d\udd0d#Cloudmining opens the door to the world of #Crypto: \ud83d\udca1 Simple start for novices.\n\n\ud83d\udcb8 Economical without hardware costs.\n\n\ud83c\udf03 No concerns about space, noise, or overheating.\n\n\ud83d\udd27 Hassle-free upgrades. pic.twitter.com/N3zwTDRYjq \u2014 Bitcoinminetrix (@bitcoinminetrix) November 7, 2023\n\nThis possibility largely explains why its presale is doing so well, with new investors able to join proceedings by going to the official Bitcoin Minetrix website.\n\n1 BTCMTX currently costs $0.01150, yet this will rise to $0.01190 by the sale\u2019s final stage.\n\nOf course, once the token lists on exchanges, it could rise much higher than this, making its early investors a good profit.\n\nVisit Bitcoin Minetrix NowDisclaimer: Crypto is a high-risk asset class.

The beta will launch through the popular PC gaming storefront.\n\nNews of Illuvium joining the prominent PC gaming marketplace, which claimed 230 million users as of the end of 2022, appears to have had an immediate impact on the price of the Illuvium (ILV) token on Ethereum, which quickly jumped according to data from CoinGecko.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nILV\u2019s price surged from about $65 per token before the news to a peak of $80.49, a nearly 24% rise in a matter of hours.

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s Failed Transactions Result in Major User Losses \u2014 What\u2019s Going On?\n\nEthereum\u2019s network of decentralized applications and smart contracts frequently faces criticism for its high rate of failed transactions, which result in substantial losses for users. According to November 7 data shared by Fernando Nikoli\u0107, the Marketing and Communications Director at Blockstream, Ethereum users have lost over $100,000 in just the top 10 failed transactions on the network.\n\nThe High Costs of Failed Transactions on Ethereum\n\n\n\nThe staggering losses were revealed in a post on Nikoli\u0107\u2019s X (formerly Twitter), where he referred to the failed Ethereum transactions as \u201chot garbage.\u201d The top failed transaction resulted in a loss of more than $38,000 in gas fees for a single user. The second-highest failed transaction led to a loss of over $17,000 in gas fees. The remaining failures in the top 10 list also showed users losing thousands in gas fees.\n\nThroughout this year, Ethereum has seen upwards of $100,000 lost due to failed transactions, with a single failed transaction costing a user $38,000+ What kind of hot garbage is this? pic.twitter.com/i8fA7IPOf9 \u2014 Fernando Nikoli\u0107 \ud83c\udde6\ud83c\uddf7 \ud83d\udfe0 (@basedlayer) November 7, 2023\n\nUnder Ethereum\u2019s structure, gas fees paid for transactions are non-refundable regardless of whether the transactions succeed or fail. This means that when transactions fail on Ethereum\u2019s network, any gas fees paid are lost permanently.\n\nNikoli\u0107\u2019s data draws attention to the losses from transaction failures at a time when traffic on Ethereum spiked in May during a surge in activity around the meme coin PEPE. Increased congestion on the network tends to correlate with a dramatic increase in gas fees. Some users can fall short of having enough gas to process their attempted transactions, leading to rampant failures.\n\nThe Ethereum Criticism Continues\n\n\n\nNikoli\u0107\u2019s harsh criticism of Ethereum follows similar condemnation by other Bitcoin proponents recently. Bit Paine, another Bitcoin advocate, referred to Ethereum as a scam just last week. He argued that the network had facilitated the creation of numerous \u201cdigital penny stocks\u201d in the form of tokens he deems unregistered securities.\n\nA brief history of the rise and fall of ethereum: Guy tries to scam people with \u201cquantum computer emulator.\u201d Rightly fails. Moves on to next scam: \u201cworld computer\u201d \u2013 would have failed except\u2026 It turns out to have one *very potent* use case: a platform for easily creating and\u2026 \u2014 Bit Paine \u26a1\ufe0f (@BitPaine) November 4, 2023\n\nWhile the two critics come from a similar maximalist perspective favoring Bitcoin, their scrutiny spotlights some of Ethereum\u2019s main struggles \u2013 failed transactions and questions around proper token registration. Despite the drawbacks, Ethereum is still the second-largest blockchain network behind Bitcoin, valued at over $226 billion as of writing.\n\nNonetheless, the users losing thousands due to the network\u2019s structural limitations present a pain point the Ethereum community cannot ignore. As activity spikes again, similar to last May\u2019s meme coin mania, the losses from failed transactions will likely plague the network again soon. The developers and researchers behind Ethereum\u2019s roadmap may need to prioritize solutions to the transaction failure rate to avoid preventable losses."

        "title": "Ethereum Returns Outperforms Gold by Close to 40% in 2023 - Bankless Times",
        "content": "Compared to gold, investing in Ethereum (ETH) has proven more lucrative in 2023. That is according to a recent BanklessTimes.com data presentation. The news site reports that ETH returns outperformed gold by nearly 40%. This finding has caught the attention of industry players, including the outlet\u2019s crypto expert, Alice Leetham.\n\nLeetham emphasized shifts in investor sentiment and the pull of blockchain technology as crucial factors behind ETH outperforming gold. She further pointed out its growing adoption in Decentralized Finance (DeFi) as a catalyst for its growth.\n\nShe said:\n\nEthereum's outperformance of gold this year is a clear demonstration of the changing investment landscape. Digital assets like ETH are becoming increasingly attractive to investors seeking high returns as the world embraces blockchain technology and DeFi\n\nAlice explained that the surge in DeFi projects running on the Ethereum network has attracted vast sums of capital and users. These, in turn, have contributed to its growth as a financial hub.\n\nOther Factors Behind ETH's Stellar Performance\n\nFurthermore, Alice suggested that Ethereum's blockchain remains the go-to platform for minting and trading non-fungible tokens (NFTs). From digital art to collectibles and virtual real estate, NFTs have ushered in a new tokenization era. The blockchain\u2019s NFT ecosystem has attracted artists and investors, further driving ETH\u2019s value.\n\nMoreover, the network\u2019s upgrades, including its transition to Ethereum 2.0, have enhanced scalability, reduced energy consumption, and improved security. These upgrades have instilled confidence in developers and investors, bolstering the platform's long-term viability.\n\nAgain, global economic trends have favored digital assets in 2023. Uncertainty in traditional financial markets and concerns about inflation have driven many to seek alternative investments. Thus, cryptocurrencies like ETH are becoming increasingly attractive as a hedge against economic instability.\n\nImplications of Ethereum's Rise\n\nIn Alice\u2019s view, Ethereum's outperformance of gold has far-reaching implications. On the face of it, It underscores the growing acceptance of cryptocurrencies as legitimate investments, potentially threatening traditional assets.\n\nShe held that Investors are increasingly turning to digital assets as a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty\u2014one significant factor explaining that shift is their versatility over the rigidity of precious metals.\n\nPrized for its scarcity and time-tested worth, gold has traditionally been considered the ultimate store of value. However, ETH and other cryptocurrencies are beginning to challenge this age-old belief. As a decentralized digital asset, ETH has shown it can serve as a store of value not limited by physical constraints.\n\nMoreover, ETH\u2019s liquidity and portability make it a more flexible asset for cross-border exchanges. Besides, its network's security, transparency, and robust infrastructure boost its credibility as a store of value."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nRonin may be best known as the Ethereum sidechain network behind Axie Infinity, the play-to-earn monster-battling game that flung NFT gaming into the spotlight back in 2021. But now Ronin is drawing attention for other games\u2014and network activity is surging following last week\u2019s launch of a game called Pixels.\n\nThe number of active wallet addresses on Ronin has effectively tripled in recent days, according to data shared on Twitter by Alex Svanevik, founder and CEO of crypto analytics firm Nansen. As of early Wednesday, it shows a leap from just over 20,000 active daily wallet users to about 70,000.\n\nAll the while, Ronin\u2019s native token RON is pumping, marking a 13% increase over the last 24 hours to a current price of about $0.68, per data from CoinGecko. RON is further up 37% over the past week and 59% in the last 30 days, although other gaming tokens have similarly seen substantial jumps in recent weeks.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPixels, which previously was on Ethereum scaling network Polygon before migrating to Ronin, officially launched on the Axie network on October 31. The game recreates the vibe of a classic 16-bit role-playing adventure, letting players navigate through a pixel-art world as they interact with each other, farm the land, play mini-games, and earn token rewards.\n\nPixels is officially live on @Ronin_network! This release is massive...\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Ronin Migration\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Pixels Carnival\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Pixels Genesis Pets Mint\n\n\ud83d\udc49 @Moku_HQ Partnership Make sure you read through everything below \ud83e\uddf5 pic.twitter.com/Hj1WEEUzjD \u2014 Pixels (@pixels_online) October 31, 2023\n\nIt also lets holders of select NFT profile picture (PFP) collections use their owned avatars in the game, with projects like the Bored Ape Yacht Club and CrypToadz supported.\n\nRonin, developed by Axie Infinity creator Sky Mavis, has onboarded additional games onto the Ethereum scaling network, including The Machines Arena, Zoids Wild Arena, and the CyberKongz Play and Kollect game.\n\nThe Ronin network experienced a $622 million hack to its Ethereum bridge in March 2022, which the U.S. Treasury later blamed the notorious North Korean state-sponsored hacking group, Lazarus. Sky Mavis ultimately reimbursed stolen user funds and recovered about 10% of the stolen funds routed through centralized exchanges.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAxie Infinity\u2019s own tokens have seen price boosts in recent weeks, as well, with the AXS governance token up 42% in the last 30 days to a current price above $6.00, while the SLP reward token has jumped 71% in that span to a price above $0.002 per token.\n\nEdited by Ryan Ozawa."

        "content": "The Ethereum ETF will track the performance of the Ethereum spot price. It will be available to institutional and retail investors in the United States.\n\nThe registration of the Ethereum ETF is a positive development for the crypto industry, as it signals that large institutional investors like BlackRock are becoming increasingly comfortable with crypto assets. It also suggests that the SEC is open to approving crypto ETFs, as long as they meet certain regulatory standards.\n\nThe iShares Ethereum Trust has just been registered in Delaware. For context, BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust was registered in a similar manner 7 days before they filed the ETF application with the SEC. Details below. [announcement: I\u2019m moving to @SynopticCom soon] pic.twitter.com/IYafIaxMzA \u2014 Summers (@SummersThings) November 9, 2023\n\nBlackRock\u2019s Ethereum ETF Registration Reaffirms the Good Path with the SEC\n\nThe SEC has been hesitant to approve crypto ETFs in the past, due to concerns about market manipulation and fraud. However, the SEC has recently softened its stance on crypto ETFs, as the asset class has matured and become more regulated. In October 2021, the SEC approved the first Bitcoin futures ETF, which was launched by ProShares. Since then, the SEC has approved several other Bitcoin futures ETFs.\n\nThe approval of Bitcoin futures ETFs was a significant step forward for the crypto industry, as it paved the way for the SEC to approve spot Bitcoin ETFs. Spot Bitcoin ETFs track the price of Bitcoin directly, unlike Bitcoin futures ETFs, which track the price of Bitcoin futures contracts.\n\nBlackRock\u2019s registration of an Ethereum ETF is a further sign that the SEC is open to approving spot crypto ETFs. The fact that BlackRock is one of the world\u2019s largest and most respected asset managers makes the registration even more significant.\n\nWhat the Approval of BlackRock\u2019s Ethereum ETF Would Mean for the Crypto Industry?\n\nThe approval of BlackRock\u2019s Ethereum ETF would be a major milestone for the crypto industry. It would signal to the world that Bitcoin and other crypto assets are legitimate investment products.\n\nThe approval of the ETF would also likely lead to a significant increase in investment in Bitcoin and other crypto assets from institutional investors. This would boost the liquidity of the crypto market and make it more attractive to retail investors. The approval of BlackRock\u2019s Ethereum ETF would be a major victory for the crypto industry. It would be a sign that the industry is maturing and becoming more mainstream.\n\nBREAKING$ETH BREAKS $2,000 \ud83d\udcc8 \u2192 $9 trillion asset manager BlackRock registers Ethereum Trust in Delaware \ud83d\udcb0 pic.twitter.com/eFP05uviFi \u2014 CABANA (@Cabanaandre1) November 9, 2023\n\nConclusion\n\nBlackRock\u2019s registration of an Ethereum ETF is a positive development for the crypto industry. It reaffirms the good path between BlackRock and the SEC, and it suggests that the approval of BlackRock\u2019s Bitcoin ETF is imminent. It would also likely lead to a significant increase in investment in Bitcoin and other crypto assets from institutional investors.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe information discussed by Altcoin Buzz is not financial advice.

        "title": "Ethereum Price Prediction as the Market Stagnates...Will ETH GO UP? - CryptoTicker.io - Bitcoin Price, Ethereum Price & Crypto News",
        "content": "Ethereum has seen a tremendous uptrend as prices soared high from $1,577.81 to $1,892.37 in the past 2 weeks. With a performance of 2.31% in 7 days, it might be a good idea to know whether the price of Ethereum will continue to go up or adjust lower. Will Ethereum price go higher? Let\u2019s analyze in this Ethereum price prediction article.\n\nEthereum Price Analysis: Why is Ethereum UP?\n\nLast week, rumors surfaced regarding the Bitcoin ETF approval, and Ethereum\u2019s price trajectory has benefited from the speculative buzz. Despite the lack of confirmation, Ethereum\u2019s prices have maintained a higher threshold, signaling renewed hope in the crypto market. The buying power alone was sufficient to propel prices upward. In the past month, Ethereum has seen a price increase of approximately 19.94%, with its market cap now standing at a robust $227.35 billion. Over the last 7 days, Ethereum has slight growth, with a 2.31% increase.\n\nIs Ethereum Coin a Good Buy Today?\n\nEthereum lagged for quite a while, with prices consolidating for more than two months. The market witnessed a hard crash, with Ethereum reaching its lowest price of the year at $1,523.24. However, with the current market trend pointing upwards, it could be a strategic move to invest in Ethereum. The support price of $1,800 seems to be a strong foundation for ETH, suggesting that now might be an opportune time to buy.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction: Will Ethereum reach $2,000?\n\nWhile it might be a bit too late for Ethereum\u2019s prices to reach the all-time high price of $4,800 within the remaining two months of the year, positioning oneself around the support areas could be wise. With a potential target of $2,000 on the horizon, buying at current levels could be beneficial and bring in a hefty 5% return before 2024.\n\nWhere to Buy Ethereum?\n\nBitget stands out as a viable platform to purchase Ethereum. Known for its security and user-friendly interface, Bitget makes starting your cryptocurrency investment journey straightforward. To buy Ethereum on Bitget, simply create an account, complete the necessary KYC procedures, deposit funds, and execute your purchase.\n\nWhat is Ethereum Coin?\n\nEthereum is more than just a cryptocurrency; it\u2019s a platform for decentralized applications (DApps). It aims to create a decentralized suite of financial products that anyone in the world can freely access, regardless of nationality, ethnicity, or faith. This aspect makes the implications for those in some countries more compelling because those without state infrastructure and state identifications can get access to bank accounts, loans, insurance, or a variety of other financial products.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou might also like\n\nMore from Altcoin"

        "content": "\"While it cannot be ruled out that another bug or unintended consequence of an upgrade may happen, we do think the probability of such an event is much lower as the network has become more resilient, and more developers continue to work on it over time. We think the probability is also lessened as the Bitcoin code is completely open source, so anyone from large companies to independent software engineers can view and test it. We also note that if another bug is discovered, it is likely that those with vested interest and large holdings of bitcoin and equipment (miners, etc.) will be incentivized to work together to quickly fix it. Nevertheless, we do think this is a criticism that is worthy of consideration and investors should assign a non-zero chance to the possibility of a severe enough bug in the core Bitcoin network that could cause its value to decline, possibly precipitously.\""

        "content": "Bitcoin price has now surpassed the Terra-LUNA crisis level, touching a high of $37,150 on Thursday. BTC price retraces after hitting a high, with the price now moving near the $36,700 level as a result of shorts liquidation in the last 24 hours. In fact, Bitcoin is now only halfway away from reclaiming the 2021 high of $69,000, which analysts predict to happen next year.\n\nBitcoin Price Reaches $37,000\n\nBitcoin has completed its full recovery to the Terra-Luna crisis level exactly a year after the Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s exchange FTX filed for bankruptcy.\n\nadvertisement\n\n\u201cWith Bitcoin trading back above the level when the Terra stablecoin imploded, crypto traders have officially moved on from those psychological scars,\u201d said Markus Thielen, head of research at Matrixport.\n\nThe crypto market has to overcome the steepest monetary tightening by the U.S. Federal Reserve in four decades, stringent industry regulations, and heightened scrutiny.\n\nBitcoin saw upside moves during the Santa Claus rally earlier this year, the banking crisis in March, and spot Bitcoin ETF hype. The Federal Reserve has also hinted at dovish rate hikes until next year, making institutional investors extremely bullish.\n\nMeanwhile, Bloomberg Intelligence analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas said \u201cEven if approvals don\u2019t arrive this month, we still believe there\u2019s a 90% chance of approval by Jan. 10.\u201d In October, Bloomberg\u2019s analysts raised odds of spot Bitcoin ETF approval from 75% to 90% after Grayscale\u2019s victory in the court case.\n\n\u201cThe ETF expectation is the top of a growing list of catalysts, which gives the current rally further legs,\u201d said Josh Gilbert, market analyst at trading and investing firm eToro. Besides the ETF trigger, bets that the US Federal Reserve is done with rate hikes for now and an upcoming Bitcoin-halving next year are also fueling the rally, Gilbert said.\n\nPopular crypto analyst Michael van de Poppe has also made a somewhat bullish prediction. He said \u201cAnything between $38,000-40,000 is pretty much resistance and I\u2019m not expecting a breakout in one-go.\u201d However, he sees Bitcoin reaching $45,000-50,000 pre-halving.\n\nAs reported by Coingape, world\u2019s largest investment fund Blackrock has filed first Ethereum spot ETF in US for approval with SEC. It is to be noted that Blackrock has already filed for spot Bitcoin ETF earlier.\n\nAlso Read:"

        "content": "Table of Contents\n\nThe world of cryptocurrency is abuzz with activity as Bitcoin has confidently breached the $36,000 threshold, while Ethereum has elegantly surpassed $1,900, echoing their historic highs from two years ago and igniting discussions about the market's potential for sustained growth. The altcoin king\u2019s breach of its local resistance, now a firm support, marks a significant stride, positioning it for a possible rally towards the $2,000 landmark.\n\nWithin this climate of cautious optimism, ScapesMania (MANIA) emerges as a presale project attracting discerning investors with its prospects of high returns and a reputation for predictability, a rare find in the volatile crypto realm. While ETH forges its own path upward, the presale buzz around MANIA is a compelling subplot in the broader crypto narrative.\n\nYet, in the world of cryptocurrency, certainty is a mirage. The market's heartbeat is irregular, always hinting at sudden shifts that could as easily elevate as they could deflate even the most promising of assets.\n\nGet Ahead in Crypto with ScapesMania\n\nWhile some are facing an uncertain future, the trajectory of a presale project is far easier to predict. ScapesMania (MANIA) is a well-balanced, meticulously designed project that acts as a gaming ecosystem. Through DAO governance, backers will be able to influence and benefit from a multi-billion-dollar industry. A wide range of features paired with the best technology, a professional team, and a long-term, highly ambitious vision can make ScapesMania the next big thing in crypto. Presale discounts and stage bonuses only add to the project's appeal.\n\nPresale is Live Now - Join Now for a Chance to Benefit with MANIA\n\nBacked by an award-winning developer crew, ScapesMania stands for transparency: every member\u2019s social media profile is public. The project can achieve this not just by bringing big innovation to the game, but by putting its community front and center. Driving customer engagement and making sure that everyone benefits through great tokenomics and generous rewards is what makes ScapesMania the project with a bright future ahead.\n\nPresale is Live, Learn More About Major Benefits\n\nEthereum (ETH): Approach to a Make-or-Break Point\n\nAs Ethereum (ETH) navigates the market's ebb and flow, its current stance at above $1,910 signals a precarious equilibrium between bullish ambitions and bearish caution. The immediate focus for traders is the second resistance point near $1,920, with a successful closure above this potentially opening the gates to the third level resistance at around $1,935.\n\nSource: TradingView\n\nPaired with a 2% daily and a 4% weekly price uptick, the trading volume of ETH has swelled by roughly 33% almost hitting $17.25 billion, indicative of investor interest, and any persistent demand here could fortify the bulls' charge towards these higher echelons.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Bullish Indicators\n\nIn the bullish camp, the merging of the 13-week and 1-month highs just below the $1,930 level weaves an intriguing story of potential for continued upward momentum. Should Ethereum (ETH) maintain its trajectory and vault over the $1,935 mark, the momentum could be further validated by the 3-10 day MACD oscillator, provided it shakes off its current stagnation.\n\nHowever, traders are mindful that a stalling MACD near the $1,926 level could suggest waning momentum, requiring close monitoring for signs of a potential trend reversal.\n\nEthereum Bearish Indicators\n\nConversely, bearish scenarios unfold below the current plane of trade. The first support point at $1,874 stands as the initial guard against a downward slide, with further safety nets positioned at $1,859 and $1,844, respectively. A drop beneath these levels could trigger a cascade towards more distant supports, such as the 18-day moving average crossing at $1,760, or the more formidable 40-day moving average crossing, observed twice at around $1,675 and $1,630.\n\nFor ETH, these price points serve not only as technical lifelines but also as psychological landmarks that could sway the overall mood of the market.\n\nAs traders navigate this tightrope, the interplay of these technicals sketches a complex landscape where today's support can become tomorrow's resistance, and vice versa, in the ever-unpredictable theater of cryptocurrency trading.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Ethereum (ETH) price\u2019s recent strides toward the $2,000 mark are stirring investor optimism, but the crypto market's fickleness means every step forward is watched warily for signs of a backslide.\n\nAs trading volume swells, ETH fans are riding a wave of hope, yet the seasoned eyes remain fixed on the charts, knowing well that today's gains could slip away if the winds shift.\n\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nThe price of ether jumped Thursday, recapturing the psychologically important $2,000 threshold for the first time since July. The strong upward action came amid a bullish sentiment in the crypto market, bolstered by news that traditional finance giant BlackRock has submitted paperwork for an iShares Ethereum Trust in Delaware \u2014 similar to its registration before applying for a spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nBlackRock ETH ETF Next?\n\nBlackRock submitted a filing for the iShares Bitcoin Trust in June, which moved the crypto markets. Nonetheless, the likelihood of BlackRock filing for a spot-price Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) has been a major subject of debate among market pundits for a while now.\n\nMuch to the delight of ether enthusiasts, the world\u2019s largest asset manager has seemingly registered an iShares Ethereum Trust in Delaware.\n\nThe registration, however, doesn\u2019t indicate that BlackRock has applied with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to offer a spot ETH ETF, but experts today pointed out that the $10 trillion asset manager similarly registered the iShares Bitcoin Trust entity a week before it filed for a spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nThe iShares Ethereum Trust has just been registered in Delaware.\n\n\n\nFor context, BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust was registered in a similar manner 7 days before they filed the ETF application with the SEC. Details below.\n\n\n\n[announcement: I\u2019m moving to @SynopticCom soon] pic.twitter.com/IYafIaxMzA \u2014 Summers (@SummersThings) November 9, 2023\n\nThe filing today was submitted by an entity going by the name BlackRock Advisors. The filing notes BlackRock\u2019s managing director, Daniel Schwieger, as the registered agent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen BlackRock filed paperwork for the formation of a spot BTC ETF, market watchers noted that the asset manager has a nearly perfect track record when it comes to filing for and getting approval from the SEC. But that hasn\u2019t guaranteed a regulatory nod with its iShares Bitcoin Trust.\n\nBloomberg ETF Analysts yesterday observed that starting today, the SEC has a brief window of just eight days when it could technically greenlight all 12 Bitcoin ETF filings.\n\nIf one or all applications are approved, the asset managers will be expected to buy, own, and store Bitcoin for their customers, potentially boosting the price of the flagship crypto and the whole sector.\n\nEther Rockets Past $2,000\n\nEthereum, the second-largest crypto by market cap, today rallied above $2,000 for the first time in four months. The asset has boomed with Bitcoin, the industry\u2019s biggest coin, which soared past $36,000.\n\nEther traded as high as $2,043.38, per data from CoinGecko, but has dipped slightly to a current price of $2,034.23 as of this writing. That\u2019s a 7.2% rise over the past 24 hours and a 12.3% gain over the last week.\n\nEven with today\u2019s price bump, ETH remains down 58.62% from its all-time high price point of $4,878 registered at the peak of the crypto market in November 2021."

        "title": "Ethereum Price Prediction: Can Surging Micro Addresses Trigger ETH Rally To New ATHs? - CoinGape",
        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) bulls are leaving no stone unturned as they deal with FOMO amid what seems like a pre-Christmas rally powered by fresh developments in the area of spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The largest smart contracts token extended the bullish leg above $2,000 for the first time since July after news broke that BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager made the first step toward filing for an Ether spot exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nInvestors and traders immediately found ETH attractive and moved with speed to book profits, paving the way for the second phase of the bull run heading to $3,000.\n\nadvertisement\n\nBitcoin price and other altcoins joined in the bullish party, with the bellwether cryptocurrency climbing to $38,000 before dropping to confirm support above $36,000. At the time of writing on Friday during US business hours, Ethereum price is trading at $2077, up 8.3% in the last 24 hours.\n\nBloomberg\u2019s ETF analyst, Eric Balchunas was the first to share the development on X (formerly Twitter) following a confirmation on the website.\n\nBlackRock has made first step towards filing for a spot Ether ETF. I just confirmed on the website myself. Nice catch by @SummersThings https://t.co/mLKIhKdiI6 \u2014 Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) November 9, 2023\n\nThe news comes amid growing optimism for the likely approval of a bunch of Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETF) in the coming few days by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nThe largest smart contracts token, which had retreated into the $1,800\u2019s range reclaimed support at $2,000, extending the weekly gains to 4% and monthly cumulative gains to 21%.\n\nTraders are now gazing towards the next swing above $2,000 for the first time since July, bolstered by the hope for a Bitcoin spot ETF. A higher support at $1,900 would go a long way to reinforce the bullish thesis, paving the way for a run-up beyond $2,000.\n\nRecommended for you: Ethereum Price Prediction: Is $ETH Ready to Regain $3000 Mark?\n\nEthereum Price Levels To Watch As ETH Eyes $3,000\n\nThe On-Balance-Volume (OBV) indicator affirmed the bullish outlook in ETH price after it resumed the uptrend around mid-October on the weekly chart. This indicator tracks both the inflow and outflow volume of money in the market.\n\nA continued uptrend suggests that traders are willing to bet on Ethereum price moving north as opposed to pulling back. Hence, upholding support above $1,900 would greatly add value to the uptrend.\n\nThe fact that Ethereum price has sustained its position above all the key bull market indicators, implies that a bull run is already upon us. Therefore, gains above $2,100 are bound to occur sooner or later. However, based on the technical outlook, ETH could carry on the journey toward the next key milestone at $3,000 this weekend.\n\nAn ascending triangle as illustrated on the chart further validates the expected breakout. However, bulls must focus on breaking the resistance at $2,100 to entice more buyers to seek exposure to ETH, thus creating the momentum needed to move the price.\n\nIs it Good time to buy Ethereum?\n\nEthereum price is currently in bullish hands and they are unlikely to let go for a long time, especially with the daily chart showing a clear breakout above a long-standing descending channel resistance.\n\nOn top of the channel breakout, Ethereum has presented a couple of bullish crosses. The first golden cross occurred when the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) (red) flipped above the 100-day EMA (blue). Another bullish cross followed closely with the same 50-day EMA (red) moving above the long-term 200-EMA (purple).\n\nEthereum Micro Addresses Surpass 100k\n\nBlockchain data analytics company Santiment has released the latest insights into the Ethereum network, which showed a significant increase in the number of micro wallets (addresses holding small ETH balances) to more than 100,000 for the first time in history.\n\nThis increase can substantiate the strong macro uptrend, as it is backed by strong fundamentals. In other words, the volatility is supported by the growing demand for ETH, creating momentum for the rally.\n\n\ud83d\udcc8 #Ethereum's market value has jumped +38% in 4 weeks, powered by high network growth. Particularly micro addresses (<0.1 $ETH), which recently surpassed over 100K wallets for the first time. Even the 0.1-10 $ETH and 10K+ $ETH tiers are finally rising. https://t.co/O8kQXJkMxG pic.twitter.com/hvKBepNnDJ \u2014 Santiment (@santimentfeed) November 10, 2023\n\nTraders and investors will continue to book positions in Ethereum as long as the bullish thesis stands. Moreover, the panel of specialists brought together by Finder recently predicted a larger breakout in Ethereum price to $5,800 by 2025. The first step to $3,000 would be to uphold support at $2,000.\n\nRelated Articles"

        "content": "Key takeaways:\n\nFounders of Polytope Labs, Seun Lanlege and David Salami, have launched Hyperbridge, a protocol for safe cross-chain transactions.\n\nBuilt to make Africans builders of blockchain technology, Polytope Labs has gotten funding and research grants of up to $130,000.\n\nHyperbridge, which is its first product, is a blockchain network that the founders claim uses a first-of-its-kind infrastructure design.\n\nAfrica has largely been on the consuming end of crypto and blockchain technology for a long time. While crypto evangelists across the world say Africa has the most use cases for blockchain, Africa has not played a major role in the building of critical blockchain infrastructures \u2014 the hard stuff, if you may.\n\nThis is the reason why Seun Lanlege, who used to work with the team that built the Ethereum network and Polkadot network and David Salami built Polytope Labs.\n\nIn a conversation with Techpoint Africa, Lanlege said \"Polytope Labs is an opportunity for Nigerians to build lasting technological infrastructure. If we're going to be using this technology, we should also be building it.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, building blockchain infrastructures is hard.\n\nAnd this is not just because of the complex-looking mathematical equations Lanlege has on his board during blockchain community meets ups or his cryptography and blockchain discussions at the University of London, UK, building blockchain products needs expertise, the kind Salami and Lanlege are hoping to nurture at Polytope Labs.\n\nThey also want to build products and have successfully built Hyperbridge.\n\nWhat is Hyperbridge?\n\nHyperbridge is a cross-chain protocol that allows the exchange of information across blockchains.\n\nNormally, blockchains exist in silos. Ethereum network does not communicate with the Bitcoin Network, while Polkadot does not communicate with Solana. This poses a challenge when you need to send information across these networks.\n\nBe the smartest in the room Join 30,000 subscribers who receive Techpoint Digest, a fun week-daily 5-minute roundup of happenings in African and global tech, directly in your inbox, hours before everyone else. Digest Subscription Email First Name Subscribe Give it a try, you can unsubscribe anytime. Privacy Policy.\n\nA familiar example is sending money across different banks in Nigeria. Imagine every bank had its own currency and do not accept currencies from other banks.\n\nIf your supermarket uses Access Bank and you have a First Bank account, there'll be no way for you to pay because Access Bank does not take transfers from any other bank.\n\nBlockchains are designed this way for security reasons, and Hyperbridge wants to solve this problem.\n\nLanlege pointed out that while Hyperbridge isn't a first when it comes to cross-chain solutions, the design architecture is the first in the world.\n\n\"What we've built is a blockchain that does the cryptography verification on behalf of other blockchains. It is connected to all the chains and does all the verification that needs to happen so that secure messages can be passed between each chain.\"\n\nHe said that existing solutions have led to hacks due to security flaws that emerge because of, how expensive cross-chain protocols are difficult to run.\n\nOther cross-chain solutions include Polkadot, which is described as the blockchain of blockchains by the developer and former Ethereum Co-founder Gavin Wood and Cosmos with the vision of becoming the \"Internet blockchains.\"\n\nInterestingly, Polytope Labs has received up to $130,000 in funding and research grants from the likes of Web3 Foundation and Polkadot.\n\nHowever, Hyperbridge is just the beginning of Polytope Labs' blockchain creations, while Lanlege admits that the space is still growing, he believes Africa can be builders and not just consumers."

        "content": "Low-cap projects have the greatest chance of yielding large rewards if you\u2019re trying to make it in the crypto space. Therefore, you should consider investing in Sui (SUI), Gala (GALA), and InQubeta (QUBE) rather than Ethereum (ETH). These tokens are a strong alternative to ETH since they may surpass it, making them promising altcoins to buy.\n\nIn this article, we will cover why Sui, Gala, and InQubeta are the best coins to invest in, as they could potentially outperform Ethereum.\n\nInQubeta (QUBE): A Unique Opportunity\n\nIt is common knowledge that projects in their early stages have the most growth potential, and InQubeta (QUBE) is no exception. It is currently on the initial coin offering list in its fifth presale stage. It costs just $0.0161 at this stage, which we believe is a steal considering its potential to skyrocket. According to analysts, it will soar by 3,000% after its launch, making it a promising investment along with Sui and Gala.\n\nInQubeta is a blend of blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI). It aims to transform the AI industry by introducing a new fundraising approach. This model will allow AI startups to raise funds through crypto. That isn\u2019t all; it also intends to make the AI market accessible to everybody by utilizing NFTs and a fractional investment model.\n\nThis project also has an ambitious roadmap, including the launch of its staking dApp, NFT marketplace, and listing on centralized exchanges. We believe this will play an important role in its rise. If you wish to join this growing community and potentially earn a significant return on your investment, follow the link below.\n\nSui (SUI): A Unique Smart Contract and Blockchain Platform\n\nSui (SUI) is a unique Layer 1 blockchain and smart contract platform that allows digital assets to be owned in a quick, private, and secure way. With this, we believe that it should be ranked among the top altcoins on the market.\n\nIt further sets itself apart with its scalable processing and storage. This enables it to support a large number of applications at unrivaled speed. The fact that Sui is currently worth less than $1 is a little shocking. Given the space for growth, we believe that it is one of the best cryptos to buy now.\n\nGala (GALA): Revolutionizing Gaming\n\nChances are, if you are a game enthusiast, you will have come across Gala (GALA) at some point. This blockchain-based project was built to bring value back to the players while having fun playing games. It is also unique because it is a pioneer in the play-to-earn (P2E) gaming space and gives players more rewards, control, and freedom.\n\nIn addition, it also has a vision of competing with mainstream platforms. With this, we believe it is a top crypto to invest in. We also think that it is undervalued and has significant growth potential.\n\nConclusion\n\nSui, Gala, and InQubeta are the top alternative investments to Ethereum. These cryptocurrencies have significant room for growth and are priced competitively. They are enticing investments because, in our opinion, they have the potential to surpass ETH.\n\nVisit InQubeta Presale\n\nJoin The InQubeta Communities\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "NEAR Foundation launches NEAR DA to offer secure, cost-effective data availability for ETH rollups and Ethereum ... - CIO News",
        "content": "NEAR moves into the modular blockchain landscape with the lowest-cost DA offering in the Web3 market today.\n\nNovember 8th, 2023, at 2:30 p.m. Lisbon time, NEARCON: The NEAR Foundation today announced the rollout of the NEAR Data Availability (NEAR DA) layer, a groundbreaking innovation that offers robust, cost-efficient data availability for developers building Ethereum rollups.\n\nLaunched with Madara by StarkNet, Caldera, Fluent, Vistara, Dymension RollApps, and Movement Labs as its first users, NEAR DA\u2019s entry into the data availability landscape builds upon the NEAR Protocol\u2019s 3+ years as an established, secure, and reliable blockchain with 100% uptime. NEAR provides all the guarantees of a scalable layer-one network that is also more cost-effective than other DA solutions; for instance, posting rollup data on NEAR would be 8,000 times cheaper than posting on Ethereum.\n\nDesigned to scale Ethereum cheaply and reliably, NEAR DA offers immediate benefits to Web3 founders exploring the modular blockchain development landscape. The new layer supports Ethereum L2s that want to continue building on ETH without the high cost of posting data. It will also support high-quality projects looking to launch an app chain or an L2.\n\nThe negligible, predictable gas fees and cost-effectiveness of NEAR DA let developers build more accessible applications for their end-users. As of September 2023, posting 100kB of calldata on Ethereum L1 for optimistic rollups would cost roughly $26.22, while posting the same amount of data on NEAR Protocol would cost $0.0033. Projects can pass those benefits along to their user base while still remaining integrated with the broader Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nIllia Polosukhin, co-founder of NEAR Protocol, said: \u201cOffering a data availability layer to Ethereum rollups highlights the versatility of NEAR\u2019s tech while also helping founders from across Web3 deliver great products that bring us closer to mainstream adoption of the Open Web. NEAR\u2019s L1 has been live with 100% uptime for more than three years, so it can offer true reliability to projects looking for a secure DA while also being cost-effective. NEAR provides great solutions to developers no matter which stack they\u2019re building on, and now that includes the Ethereum modular blockchain landscape.\u201d\n\nBy opening up its blockchain for data availability, NEAR Protocol is expanding its offerings to deliver a modular blockchain development framework that lets Web3 developers and founders continue building on Ethereum while leveraging NEAR\u2019s state-of-the-art technology for one part of the stack, depending on their requirements. NEAR DA expands the capabilities of NEAR\u2019s Open Web Stack, a common entry point where developers and users alike can easily build, browse, and discover Web3 products and platforms. This includes FastAuth onboarding to an account in seconds with zero crypto or seed phrases required, as well as the ability to create decentralized frontends from a library of thousands of components.\n\nDevelopers and founders building on Ethereum rollups interested in using NEAR DA can visit near.org/data-availability to get started.\n\nAlso read: Global AI Solutions, created in India, Aravind Raghunathan Joins Yavar.ai as CTO\n\nDo Follow: CIO News LinkedIn Account | CIO News Facebook | CIO News Youtube | CIO News Twitter\n\nAbout us:\n\nCIO News, a proprietary of Mercadeo, produces award-winning content and resources for IT leaders across any industry through print articles and recorded video interviews on topics in the technology sector such as Digital Transformation, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), Cloud, Robotics, Cyber-security, Data, Analytics, SOC, SASE, among other technology topics."

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has witnessed a remarkable surge of 7.4% in the past 24 hours, reaching $2,023 since April 2023.\n\nThis surge in Ethereum\u2019s value closely mirrors the recent upward movement of Bitcoin (BTC). It coincides with reports indicating that BlackRock, a renowned asset manager overseeing $9 trillion in assets, has registered an Ethereum Trust in Delaware.\n\nBlackrock Ethereum ETF On The Horizon?\n\nBlackRock made significant waves earlier this year when it submitted a filing for a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nSubsequently, BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust successfully obtained registration, solidifying the firm\u2019s presence in the emerging cryptocurrency industry.\n\nNevertheless, the possibility of BlackRock filing for a spot Ether ETF has been a subject of discussion among industry experts for some time.\n\nThe registration of the Ether Trust by BlackRock reinforces the firm\u2019s confidence in the long-term potential and impact of Ethereum, further strengthening its position within the digital asset industry and, as already seen, can significantly boost the price of ETH.\n\nETH Prepares To Break Key Price Range\n\nIn recent weeks, ETH had been consolidating between $1,800 to $1,890, as observed between October 24 and November 8.\n\nHowever, according to crypto expert Scott Melker, once Ethereum fully breaks and consolidates above the $2,000 to $2,100 range, a significant surge in price can be expected, indicating positive market sentiment.\n\nAs BlackRock continues to explore digital asset services and the potential for an Ether ETF, market participants will closely monitor the developments in the regulatory landscape.\n\nApproving an Ether ETF in the United States would provide investors with a regulated and accessible investment vehicle, potentially expanding the reach of Ethereum and validating its long-term growth potential.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock, chart from TradingView.com"

        "content": "Home \u00bb Journal Ethereum is \u2018On Fire,\u2019 Breaking $2,000 for the First Time Since April Following Major News \u2013 Report Journal Ethereum is \u2018On Fire,\u2019 Breaking $2,000 for the First Time Since April Following Major News \u2013 Report Petar Jovanovi\u0107\n\nEthereum\u2019s price has exploded higher over the past week, surging over 15% to break above the key $2,000 level. This marks the first time ETH has traded above $2,000 since April 2023, signaling a potential trend reversal for the second largest cryptocurrency.\n\nThe registration of an Ethereum Trust by BlackRock, a $9 trillion asset manager, in Delaware has been a significant factor in driving up the value of Ethereum. This move by BlackRock is seen as a major endorsement for Ethereum, potentially attracting a wave of institutional investors to the cryptocurrency.\n\nJUST IN: \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 $9 trillion asset manager BlackRock registers Ethereum Trust in Delaware. \u2014 Watcher.Guru (@WatcherGuru) November 9, 2023\n\nAfter breaking out from a falling wedge pattern, Ethereum staged a powerful rally that allowed it to smash through the $1,800 resistance area as well as the 200-day moving average. This breakout indicates bulls have regained control of the market after months of bearish pressure.\n\nThe recent price action has turned the short-term and medium-term trends bullish for ETH, although the long-term trend remains in a downtrend. Momentum indicators like the MACD have ticked higher into bullish territory, but are showing signs of waning, suggesting the crypto may be due for a pullback or consolidation around $2,000 before continuing higher.\n\nSource: CoinMarketCap\n\nOne indication that Ethereum may be overbought in the short-term is its Relative Strength Index (RSI) reading above 80 on the daily chart. The RSI is a momentum indicator that measures the speed and rate of an asset\u2019s price movement. Readings above 70 generally indicate overbought conditions, while levels below 30 signal oversold.\n\nEthereum\u2019s daily RSI surged to as high as 83 during the recent breakout, its highest level since 2021. The last two times ETH\u2019s RSI hit these elevated levels in early 2021 and mid-2022, a significant pullback followed.\n\nWhile high RSI readings can persist in strong uptrends, the current extremely overbought conditions suggest Ethereum could see a cool-off in the coming days. The key support level to watch is the breakout point near $1,800. As long as bulls can defend this area on any pullbacks, the uptrend should remain intact.\n\nWhile Ethereum\u2019s push above $2,000 is no doubt an exciting development for bulls, it may be too early to call this the start of a true \u201caltcoin season.\u201d ETH remains well below its 2021 high near $5,000 and has significant resistance around $2,400. A sustained move above that level would signal the crypto bull market is back in full swing.\n\nCheck NuggetRush ($NUGX) Sponsored: Invest Responsibly, Do Your Own Research.
