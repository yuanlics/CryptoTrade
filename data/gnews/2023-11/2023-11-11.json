        "content": "BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes is doubling down on his massively bullish Bitcoin (BTC) predictions while forecasting that Ethereum (ETH) could hit a six-figure price.\n\nHayes says that the time to turn bullish on crypto is \u201cnow\u201d while unveiling a target of $100,000 for Ethereum \u2013 an increase of about 4,669% from the current level.\n\nThe BitMEX founder also reiterates his prediction that Bitcoin will hit $1 million.\n\nIn a new blog post, Hayes further says that as currencies debase across the globe, the \u201csmartest trade\u201d would be \u201cgoing long crypto.\u201d According to the BitMEX founder, Bitcoin and Ethereum are \u201ccrypto\u2019s reserve assets\u201d while \u201ceverything else is a sh*tcoin.\u201d\n\nBesides Bitcoin and Ethereum, Hayes says there are other opportunities that exist in the crypto space offering the potential of higher returns at a greater risk.\n\n\u201cThen, we get to other layer-one blockchains that claim to be an improvement on Ether. Solana is an example. These all got beaten up real bad during the bear market. As such, they will levitate off extreme lows and provide great returns for intrepid investors. But, they are still all overhyped, me-too, pieces of sh*t that won\u2019t overtake Ethereum in terms of active developers, decentralized applications (DApps) activity, or Total Value Locked.\n\nFinally, all manner of DApps and their respective tokens will pump. This is the most fun, because down here is where you get the 10,000x returns. Of course, you\u2019re also more likely to get rugged, but where there is no risk there is no return.\u201d\n\nEthereum is trading at $2,097 at time of writing while Bitcoin is worth $37,083.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "The price of ether (ETH) isn\u2019t expected to move much for the remainder of 2023, according to Finder\u2019s latest Ethereum Price Predictions Report.\n\nFinder\u2019s panel of 31 cryptocurrency and fintech specialists predict ETH on average will be worth US$1.8k at the end of the year, on par with its current price at the time of writing. By the end of 2025 this is expected to jump to $5.8k.\n\nYouHodler chief of markets Ruslan Lienkha gave an end-of-year prediction slightly higher than the panel average at $2k. According to Lienkha, ETH \u201chas a huge growth potential as it is not just cryptocurrency but an entire ecosystem with plenty of different projects.\u201d\n\nMarket Research Future senior research analyst Shubham Munde gave a similar 2023 price prediction and attributes this to the rising popularity of DeFi. By the end of 2025, he thinks ETH will be priced at $4.5k.\n\n\u201cThe market is also recovering well and [is] expected to see major highs in [the] next year,\u201d said Munde.\n\nOmnia Markets founder and CEO Mitesh Shah is more bullish about ETH\u2019s 2025 outlook, giving a prediction higher than the panel average at $7.5k.\n\n\u201cThe rapid growth of cryptocurrency ETFs, with a wave of ether futures funds launching this Monday, is poised to make it easier for institutional investors to gain exposure to the crypto market.\u201d\n\nOrigin Protocol founder Josh Fraser is of the belief that ETH\u2019s price won\u2019t move significantly before year-end. However, Fraser is also part of the 37% who believe that the market cap of ETH will flip that of BTC\u2019s. Meanwhile 43% don\u2019t think this will ever happen, while the remaining 20% are unsure.\n\n\u201cIn my opinion, it\u2019s likely ETH will eventually flip Bitcoin in terms of market capitalization,\u201d said Fraser.\n\n\u201cBy 2030, NFTs will have tokenized trillions of dollars worth of value on Ethereum. It\u2019s not unlikely that total value locked in NFTs will surpass that of DeFi, as NFT value will include real estate, IP, luxury goods, and beyond.\u201d\n\nRealFevr VP of Web 3 Pedro Febrero thinks that the flippening will happen as soon as 2024:\n\n\u201cEthereum is the number 1 network in terms of fee revenue: compared to BTC, ETH validators make over 50% of their income from fees, whereas in bitcoin miners\u2019 revenue fee weight represents around 1%.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, Boston Trading.co CFO Jeremy Britton is part of the 43% who think ETH will never flip BTC.\n\n\u201cETH is still the original network, but changing from POW to POS has made ETH less decentralised and less \u201ccrypto\u201d. Some of ETH\u2019s competitors, such as SOL, MATIC and others, may cut ETH\u2019s market share as people want lower fees and more decentralisation.\u201d\n\nOverall 48% of Finder\u2019s panel say now is the time to hold ETH, 41% to buy, and 10% to sell."

        "title": "Ethereum Daily Revenue Soars To A 4-Month High Of $10 Million - NewsBTC",
        "content": "When Ethereum (ETH) exploded past $2,000 on November 9, Erik Smith, the Chief Investment Officer of 401 Capital, observed that the platform\u2019s average daily revenue surged to the highest level in four months.\n\nAccording to data, Ethereum generated $10 million in daily revenue, extending gains registered on the previous day and pushing the metric to the highest point since July.\n\nEthereum Prices Above $2,000, Revenue Rising In November\n\nFor now, ETH prices remain muted but are trading around November 9 highs and remain within a bullish formation backed by decent trading volumes. Prices are still trending above the $2,000 psychological support, a critical reaction level.\n\nA look at the Ethereum candlestick arrangement in the daily chart shows that while there is a notable spike in daily revenue, prices are still below July 2023 highs. Then, the coin soared to as high as $2,100 before pulling back as the momentum triggered by the broader crypto\u2019s expectation of a Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) approval faded. However, prices have since sharply recovered, adding roughly 40% from October lows and shaking off the weakness registered on August 17 when the coin plunged by 14%.\n\nToken Terminal data shows that Ethereum\u2019s daily revenue has steadily risen in the first ten days of November. Looking at trends, the average daily income has doubled from $5 million in the first five days of the month. Usually, an uptick in daily average revenue in a network points to increasing on-chain activity either through smart contract deployment or simple transfers, which necessitates the payment of gas fees.\n\nImproving Scalability In The Long Term\n\nHow the widespread adoption of Ethereum layer-2 and sidechain scaling solutions will impact the network revenue is not immediately apparent. }\n\nWhat\u2019s clear is that the more protocols leverage the protocol, deploying multiple solutions, the more revenue the network will generate for validators and stakers. Staking rewards are drawn partly from transaction fees paid as gas, new issuance, and burned miner extractable value (MEV).\n\nStill, the dollar value of ETH minted as revenue depends on spot rates. If the uptrend is sustained, this figure will continue expanding. Even so, there might be more demand for the network, which is still struggling to scale on-chain.\n\nEthereum 2.0 aims to resolve these challenges in the coming years by increasing the general throughput via solutions like Sharding. Sharding will split Ethereum into small but interconnected networks called shards. Each shard will independently process each set of transactions and maintain its state, allowing the mainnet to scale.\n\nFeature image from Canva, chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "Not everything is about ETH as Ethereum\u2019s revenue raises eyebrows - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s revenue hit $10 billion as demand for ETH increased over the week.\n\nNetwork activity also rose but transactions later dropped.\n\nETH, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain, had tongues wagging over the course of the just-ended week. This was because BlackRock filed for an Ethereum ETF, triggering a breakout for ETH as the coin rose above $2,000.\n\nAs expected, the increase led the broader market to assume that it is the altcoin season to shine. But while the market was fixated on the price action, the Ethereum blockchain was also hitting landmarks that it had previously dropped from.\n\nReturns get back to the highs\n\nOne such milestone was the Ethereum revenue. Eric Smith, Chief Investment Officer at 401 Financials, posted that the revenue had hit $10 million again. From the data coined from Token Terminal, the last time the Ethereum blockchain hit such levels was in July.\n\nETH price wasn\u2019t the only thing that was up yesterday. Ethereum\u2019s one day revenue hit $10 million for the first time since July. \ud83d\udcc8 via @tokenterminal pic.twitter.com/hw2wZdVtoO \u2014 Erik Smith, CFP\u00ae (@eriksmithcfp) November 10, 2023\n\nFor the unfamiliar, Ethereum makes its revenue mainly from network fees it charges users of the blockchain. Hence, the increase in revenue means that there was a surge in activity on the blockchain during the week.\n\nThe surge in revenue also means that there must have been an increase in the average gas price. According to information from Etherscan, ETH\u2019s average transaction fee tapped 57.1 on 9th November.\n\nThe Ethereum gas measures the amount of computational effort required to make transactions on the network. It also serves as a way of incentivizing validators on the blockchain. For context, validators are people responsible for keeping the Ethereum network working.\n\nActivity rises, then dips\n\nThis value was the highest in the last 30 days, meaning that there was an increase in demand for ETH. Elsewhere, Ethereum\u2019s network growth rose to 78,500. Network growth shows the number of new addresses being created on the blockchain.\n\nWhen the metric increases, it means user adoption is growing on the network. A decrease implies that traction has reduced. So, the initial jump suggests that new addresses were transacting actively on Ethereum.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ETHs worth today?\n\nBut at the time of writing, the network growth had dropped to 29,300. Like the network growth, active addresses on the Ethereum network also climbed to 459,000 on 10 November. Active addresses show the level of interaction or speculation around a token.\n\nTherefore, the metric at that time means that deposits on the network were at impressive levels. However, the press time state of the active addresses showed that the metric had decreased.\n\nLooking at the current state of Ethereum, the drop in gas fees has affected the revenue. Going forward, to surpass the $10 billion, the demand for ETH needs to increase more than it has recently."

        "content": "Share:\n\nEthereum price has been consolidating along an ascending trendline for the past eighteen months, with the $2,035 level holding as resistance.\n\nThe overall price action has formed an ascending triangle pattern, which forecasts a $4,736 price target for ETH.\n\nThe bullish thesis will be invalidated once the altcoin breaks and closes below the ascending trendline at the $1,500 psychological level.\n\nEthereum (ETH) price is bullish on lower and higher timeframes alike, as token holders ride the wave of what already seems to be the making of a bull market. On the higher timeframe, however, the target objective for the largest altcoin by market capitalization looks overly ambitious, but not impossible as community members turn faces toward the exchange-traded fund (ETF) narrative and the much-anticipated Bitcoin (BTC) halving, together with their combined effect on asset prices.\n\nAlso Read: Top 3 Price Prediction Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple: BTC rages on, $40,000 may not be hopium after all\n\nEthereum price 18-month ascending triangle forecasts $4,736 target\n\nEthereum (ETH) price consolidating above an ascending triangle, combined with the effect of the formation of multiple local tops around the$2,035 level has led to the formation of an ascending triangle pattern.\n\nSuch a technical formation is created when the asset\u2019s price lead to the formation of a horizontal line connecting the swing highs, while a rising trendline trails it from below connecting the swing lows. Together, the trendlines form a triangle, with traders watching for breakouts from the horizontal trendline. The target objective for such a technical formation is determined by measuring the height of the triangle and superimposing it at the breakout point.\n\nFor Ethereum price, the height of the triangle is around 134%, from $865 to $2,035 on the weekly timeframe. Superimposing this percentage difference on the weekly chart puts a target objective of $4,736.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) spurs optimism, moving north to signify rising momentum while its position at 64 shows there is still more room to the north. Effectively, the Awesome Oscillators (AO) histogram bars are also flashing green to show the bulls maintain a strong presence in the ETH market.\n\nETH/USDT 1-week chart\n\nOn the flip side, profit-taking could nullify the projection by sending Ethereum price south, potentially losing the support offered by the ascending trendline at the $1,500 psychological level. This would invalid the bullish thesis."

        "content": "Into The Cryptoverse CEO Benjamin Cowen recently discussed Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) performance in relation to Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) dominance as the flagship digital asset.\n\nIn a recent YouTube video, Cowen suggests a continued rise in Bitcoin dominance (BTC.D), indicating that Ethereum may lag behind and show smaller gains compared to BTC.\n\nCowen explains that his crypto portfolio has predominantly held more Bitcoin because he anticipates that BTC will outperform numerous assets, though not all.\n\nAdditionally, Cowen notes that Ethereum against Bitcoin (ETH/BTC) is encountering substantial resistance after falling below the trendline and attempting a retest.\n\nYou might also like: Bitcoin and Ethereum outperform traditional assets in 2023\n\nA BTC rally would result in the breakdown of Ether-Bitcoin, he explained. He pointed out how the ETH/BTC pair finally broke the wedge to the downside, highlighting that it\u2019s akin to what happened in the last cycle.\n\nAs he connects the dots, the Ether-Bitcoin pair is potentially backtesting the trendline that served as support in October 2022, March 2023, June 2023, and September 2023. Since the ETH/BTC pair is now testing from beneath the wedge in November 2023, it could offer a significant resistance level.\n\nHowever, Cowen cautions that even if ETH/BTC manages to move above the trendline, the pair will encounter several resistance levels to the upside. These levels must be successfully flipped as support to convincingly reverse the downtrend.\n\nHe further explained, stating that, there are numerous resistance levels. Whether one opts to depict them horizontally or analyze them differently, ETH/BTC still faces a significant challenge. It must have to overcome these resistance levels to indicate a meaningful reversal.\n\nAt the time of writing, ETH/BTC is valued at 0.05578 BTC, equivalent to $2,068.80 on Tradingview. Meanwhile, BTC/USDT is valued at $37,112, according to Coingecko.\n\nETF expectations\n\nThe recent surge in Bitcoin and Ethereum has significantly influenced the cryptocurrency market.\n\nBitcoin has reached $37,000, marking highs not seen since May 2022. This may be driven by the ongoing expectation that U.S. regulators approve a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nSimultaneously, Ethereum has rallied close to $2,100, reclaiming the $2,000 level for the first time since mid-July. The rise in digital assets, especially XRP, may also be attributed to Bitcoin surpassing $35,000.\n\nAdditionally, news about BlackRock planning to file for an ETH-based ETF may have also fueled Ethereum\u2019s upward momentum.\n\nFollowing the anticipation of the ETF approval, which has propelled cryptocurrency prices and related stocks, This rally could be part of a broader uptrend in the crypto sector, recognized as a significant $17.7 trillion opportunity by market strategists.\n\nHowever, altcoins like XRP, DOGE, UNI, and XLM have experienced declines, possibly due to a pause in capital rotation towards smaller tokens.\n\nFed chair Jerome Powell recently delivered a policy address to the Economic Club of New York, providing insights into the current state of the US economy and monetary policy.\n\nThis statement is significant given the critical juncture of the U.S. economy, marked by improving inflation figures alongside surging Treasury yields, creating conflicting signals about the direction of monetary policy.\n\nInterpreted as a signal, Powell\u2019s statement suggests that the Fed might persist with its tightening cycle, contrary to recent market expectations of a more dovish approach.\n\nRead more: Bitwise withdraws bitcoin and ethereum ETF application\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

Bitcoin recorded 16,410 transactions in the last 24 hours, peaking at 22,570 transactions on Nov. 9. The lowest was 12,810 transactions on Nov. 5.\n\nIn terms of transaction volume, Bitcoin saw $24.4 billion in the last 24 hours, with a high of $39.02 billion and a low of $18.1 billion within the same week. Ethereum's large transaction count stood at 3,560 in the last 24 hours, reaching a seven-day high of 7,590 transactions and a low of 3,040.\n\nIts transaction volume echoed this trend, with $2.91 billion in the last 24 hours, peaking at $6.59 billion and a low of $2.47 billion.\n\nFor Polygon, the number of large transactions reached a seven-day high of 209 transactions, the same as its count in the last 24 hours, with a low of 34 transactions. The transaction volume mirrored this surge, with the last 24 hours seeing $194.42 million, a seven-day high of $357.59 million and a low of $28.81 million.\n\nRenewed institutional demand\n\nThe significant increase in whale transactions across these cryptocurrencies is largely attributed to renewed institutional interest. The crypto market is abuzz with anticipation for the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs by January 2024, a development that is expected to further fuel institutional demand.\n\nAdditionally, BlackRock's plans to introduce a spot Ethereum ETF have added to this excitement. Institutional demand plays a crucial role in the crypto market, as it not only brings substantial capital but also lends credibility and stability to the digital currency ecosystem.\n\nThe entry of large financial players and the creation of more accessible investment vehicles like ETFs are seen as key drivers for long-term growth and mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrencies."

        "content": "A widely followed crypto analyst is warning that Ethereum (ETH) will likely underachieve relative to Bitcoin (BTC) for a while.\n\nIn a new video update, crypto trader Benjamin Cowen tells his 788,000 YouTube subscribers that he believes that Bitcoin dominance (BTC.D) will continue to rise, suggesting that Ethereum will lag behind.\n\nBTC.D tracks the percentage of the total market cap that belongs to Bitcoin. A bullish BTC.D chart indicates that altcoins in general, including Ethereum, are printing smaller gains than BTC.\n\nSays Cowen,\n\n\u201cMy crypto portfolio for the last couple of years has been predominantly just Bitcoin because I suspect that it will outperform most of the rest of the market \u2013 not all of the market, but most of the rest of the market \u2013 and that\u2019s why the dominance has gone higher.\u201d\n\nCowen says that Ethereum against Bitcoin (ETH/BTC) is facing significant resistance after dipping below a trendline and attempting to retest it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Bitcoin rallies that break Ether-Bitcoin down. And look at this [ETH/BTC] breakdown. It finally broke this wedge to the downside\u2026\n\nIt\u2019s the same thing that it did last cycle\u2026 And now we find ourselves in a position where if I connect the dots where the Ether-Bitcoin pair is potentially backtesting this trendline, the trendline that it held as support in October of 2022, in March of 2023, and in June of 2023 and in September of 2023. It\u2019s now testing it from beneath in November of 2023. Now, I contend that this could offer a significant resistance level.\u201d\n\nCowen warns that even if ETH/BTC does make a move above the trendline, the pair will still face a number of resistance levels to the upside that it would need to flip as support to convincingly reverse the downtrend.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s all these resistance levels. I mean you could draw them horizontally if you prefer and just sort of look at some of these resistance levels that Ether-Bitcoin tried to hold. It\u2019s got a lot to get through in order to prove something.\u201d\n\nETH/BTC is trading for 0.0560 BTC ($2,093) at time of writing.\n\nI\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Finder\u2019s board of crypto market experts has predicted a positive long-term increase in the price of Ethereum in 2023, 2025, and 2030.\n\nEthereum To Surpass $14,000 By 2030?\n\nThe price of Ethereum has been on a fairly positive sentiment since the news of BlackRock\u2019s Ethereum Spot ETF filing news. The cryptocurrency saw a spike that took its price above $2000 this week.\n\nIndustry specialists from Finder, an independent comparison platform and information service have stated that Ethereum will continue experiencing a price increase in the coming years.\n\nThe comparison platform has predicted that Ethereum would drop to $1,840 by the end of 2023 and Ethereum\u2019s price at the time of writing is $2,060.8. Crypto specialists at Finder also expect Ethereum\u2019s value to increase to $5,824 by 2025 and $14,411 by 2030.\n\nThe financial information service platform has stated that the reason for this price prediction is due to Ethereum\u2019s huge growth potential and the increasing demand for Ethereum staking.\n\nEthereum (ETH) is currently trading at $2,060. Chart: TradingView.com\n\nLead Market Analyst at Swyftx, Pav Hundal has supported Ethereum\u2019s price increase prediction. Hundal stated that the upcoming Bitcoin halving in 2024 may push the cryptocurrency\u2019s price up, as historical patterns have suggested a potential upward movement for Ethereum\u2019s value during past Bitcoin halving events.\n\n\u201cHistorically, as we approach a Bitcoin halving, Ethereum tends to revisit its price valuations from earlier that year. This trend aligns with the repeated observation that Bitcoin\u2019s dominance (proportion of the total [crypto] market capitalization) swells as we near the halving event. We can anticipate that there will be a potential shift from altcoins [like ETH] back into Bitcoin in the lead-up to the halving,\u201d Hundal stated.\n\nFinder Experts Say BTC Still Holds Upper Hand\n\nDespite the positive outlook of Ethereum\u2019s price in the future by Finder\u2019s crypto experts, a large majority of Finder\u2019s specialists have expressed skepticism about Ethereum\u2019s market capitalization surpassing that of Bitcoin.\n\nWhen asked if they saw ETH\u2019s market cap \u201cflipping\u201d BTCs, 43% of the expert panelists remained unconvinced that Ethereum would overtake Bitcoin.\n\nCreator of Seasonal Tokens, Ruadhan O. has stated that he believed that Ethereum\u2019s utility surpassed Bitcoin\u2019s however he does not see ETH\u2019s market cap surpassing BTC\u2019s. He explained that his reasons were due to Ethereum\u2019s high competition with other altcoins in the crypto market.\n\n\u201cEthereum remains expensive to use [and] it will lose market share to cheaper alternatives. Bitcoin isn\u2019t useful. Nobody needs a Bitcoin. There\u2019s no demand for Bitcoin\u2019s utility at a lower price because there\u2019s no utility. This is why Bitcoin isn\u2019t losing market share to other proof-of-work coins,\u201d O stated.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "Ethereum price expected to face corrections as ETH funding rate hits a yearly highs - FXStreet",
        "content": "Share:\n\nEthereum price trading at $2,050 slid slightly over the past two days, still maintaining gains on a weekly basis.\n\nETH funding rate is presently at a yearly high, which suggests the market is overheated and could correct.\n\nAt the moment, nearly 75% of all ETH holders are in profit, which historically has resulted in profit-taking, bolstering the projected outcome of ETH.\n\nEthereum price followed in the footsteps of Bitcoin and rose to trade above $2,000 in the past month. But the consistent rally seems to be reaching its saturation as the potential of profit-taking and correction is seemingly at its highest at the moment.\n\nEthereum price is nearing a decline\n\nEthereum price, trading at $2,050 at the time of writing, has risen by more than 8.5% in the past three days, nearing the 18-month-old barrier marked at $2,124 that has only been tested once since May 2022.\n\nWith ETH breaching the $2,000 mark, it has inched closer to $2,124, but the chances of a breach are unlikely, given the market is overheated at the moment. Thus, a failed breach would result in a drawdown, bringing Ethereum price back to $2,000, which would send it towards $1,800.\n\nETH/USD 1-day chart\n\nBut if the broader market cues remain bullish or Ethereum witnesses a bullish development, such as BlackRock filing for a spot ETH ETF last week, the cryptocurrency could witness a further rise. This would push ETH beyond the $2,124 mark, invalidating the bearish thesis and sending Ethereum price to tag the resistance level at $2,296.\n\nThe chances of a reversal are high\n\nHigh funding rates generally signal that traders are holding more long positions than short positions and expecting a price rise. However, sustained high rates point to overheated markets, which usually are followed by slight corrections in price. Such is the case with Ethereum as well, given its funding rates are presently at a yearly high.\n\nThe funding rates peaked on November 9 when, according to analytics platform Coinglass, the OI-weighted rate hit a high of 0.0657%.\n\nEthereum funding rate\n\nFurthermore, the investors are also likely to begin profit-taking given at the moment 75% of all ETH holders are at a profit at the moment. According to the Global In/Out of the Money (GIOM), about 37 million ETH worth over $75.8 billion bought at an average price of $1,936 is at the cusp of turning profitable.\n\nEthereum GIOM\n\nThese levels have historically witnessed profit-taking from investors and tend to result in short-term pullbacks. However, as noted by analytics platform IntoTheBlock, this does not significantly impact the long-term outlook for Ethereum, which remains bullish, unless ETH fails a breach of $2,124."

        "content": "Macro guru Raoul Pal says that the top smart contract platform Ethereum (ETH) is set to outperform Bitcoin (BTC) as the crypto markets enter into a new \u201cspring\u201d phase.\n\nThe former Goldman Sachs executive tells his one million followers on the social media platform X that based on the Tom Demark Sequential indicator, ETH is setting up to outrun BTC.\n\nThe Demark Sequential aims to identify points of trend exhaustion or price reversal.\n\n\u201cThat is the weekly DeMark 9 count for the ETH/BTC cross.

At time of writing, Ethereum is worth $2,038.\n\nAnother altcoin on the trader\u2019s radar is the artificial intelligence (AI)-focused Fetch.ai (FET).

        "content": "The biggest asset management firm in the world is challenging the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), contending that spot market Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are no different than futures ETFs.\n\nIn a new filing, investment titan BlackRock \u2013 which has over $8 trillion in assets under management \u2013 says that the regulatory agency should approve spot market crypto ETFs as it has already greenlighted futures ETFs.\n\n\u201cGiven that the Commission has approved ETFs that offer exposure to ETH futures, which themselves are priced based on the underlying spot ETH market, the Sponsor (BlackRock) believes that the Commission must also approve ETPs (exchange-traded products) that offer exposure to spot ETH, like the Trust.\u201d\n\nAccording to BlackRock, the SEC is misusing the Investment Company Act of 1940 by applying it to spot ETFs.\n\n\u201cWhile the 1940 Act has certain added investor protections that the 1933 Act does not require, these protections do not seek to allay harms arising from underlying assets or markets of assets that ETFs hold, such as the potential for fraud or manipulation in such markets.\n\nIn other words, the Sponsor does not believe that the application of the 1940 Act supports the purported justifications the Commission has made in denying other spot digital asset ETPs.\n\nThe 1940 Act explicitly lists out the types of abuses it seeks to prevent, and places certain restrictions related to accounting, borrowing, custody, fees, and independent boards, among others.\n\nNotably, none of these restrictions address an ETF\u2019s underlying assets, whether ETH futures or spot ETH, or the markets from which such assets\u2019 pricing is derived, whether the CME ETH futures market or spot ETH markets.\u201d\n\nBlackRock concludes that the distinction created by the SEC between futures ETFs and spot market ETFs is arbitrary.\n\n\u201cThe Sponsor believes that the distinction between registration of ETH futures ETFs under the 1940 Act and the registration of spot ETH ETPs under the 1933 Act is one without a difference in the context of ETH-based ETP proposals.\u201d\n\nLast week, BlackRock registered its iShares Ethereum trust in the state of Delaware, a move similar to the firm\u2019s registration of its Bitcoin trust.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nAfter breaching the psychological price of $2,000, Ethereum (ETH) seems to be going full throttle for the $2,500 price level.\n\nETH had been trying to hit the $2,000 price for a couple of months in vain, but the second largest cryptocurrency based on market cap saw light at the end of the tunnel recently.\n\nAccording to IntoTheBlock\u2019s \u201cIn/Out of the Money\u201d parameter, Ethereum does not face any significant resistance until the $2,500 area, with 75% of ETH holders already smiling to the bank.\n\nThe leading on-chain metrics provider disclosed that even though profit-taking is expected at these levels, which could trigger pullbacks, this is currently unlikely because Ethereum is looking at the long-term picture.\n\nTherefore, based on IntoTheBlock\u2019s data, stakes are high that ETH will soar to the $2,500 zone based on the positive outlook being showcased.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNotably, the number of Ethereum addresses in profit sits at 77.72 million, whereas those in losses are 21.91, according to IntoTheBlock\u2019s statistics.\n\nAn Interesting Tale is Happening Despite Ethereum Hitting $2,000\n\nAli Martinez, a leading market analyst, recently took to X, formerly Twitter, to highlight that despite Ethereum reclaiming the $2,000 threshold, whales were not in the mix because they had not even started buying.\n\nSource: Glassnode\n\nTherefore, this paints a bullish picture on the Ethereum network because if whales buy, the ETH price is destined for greater heights.\n\nThe $2,000 price level illustrates that Ethereum is enjoying a 4-month high because the second largest crypto was in this trajectory in July this year.\n\nZyCrypto recently stipulated that ETH was currently in the $2,000 zone thanks to the world\u2019s largest asset manager, BlackRock, filing for an iShares Ethereum Trust in Delaware, which is similar to the popular spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nFurthermore, a holding culture was showcased in the Ethereum ecosystem, given that ETH supply on exchanges recently hit historic lows.\n\nETH was up by 12% to hit $2,079 at press time, according to CoinGecko. Therefore, time will tell whether Ethereum will scale to the new high of $2,500."

        "content": "BITCOIN, ETHEREUM FORECAST:\n\nAccording to Reports the Spot Bitcoin ETF Decisions will be Received by November 17.\n\nETH Spot ETF Filing Sparks a Rally as ETH Meets Key Resistance Level.\n\nBTC/ USD is in Overbought Territory and there is a Chance of a Pullback if the Spot Bitcoin ETF News Does Not Come Through.\n\nTo Learn More About Price Action , Chart Patterns and Moving Averages , Check out the DailyFX Education Series .\n\nREAD MORE: Short USD/JPY: A Reprieve in the DXY Rally and FX Intervention by the BoJ\n\nRecommended by Zain Vawda Get Your Free Bitcoin Forecast Get My Guide\n\nWEEK IN REVIEW\n\nThe Cryptocurrency market surged this week as news filtered through about the listing of the Ethereum Spot ETF by BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager. This comes after a similar move by BlackRock in regard to their iShares Spot Bitcoin ETF which was registered in Delaware 7 days before they filed an ETF application. Towards the back end of October news filtered through that the Spot Bitcoin ETF application had been an approved which sent crypto markets in a frenzy and allowing Bitcoin to convincingly break above the key $30k mark This turned out to be a hoax, but the optimism doesn\u2019t seem to have subsided.\n\nFollowing the Delaware listing yesterday Ethereum and crypto markets in general rallied in what could be described as a potential case of \u201cbuy the rumor, sell the news\u201d. Personally, I think this could prove to be different given the potential influx of demand should the Bitcoin and Ethereum Spot ETFs be approved. The client base who are eyeing an addition of crypto to their portfolios are likely to be long-term holders which could mean that should an approval occur the reaction in the first few days could be massive before we see a significant tail off in both volatility and demand. Of course, BlackRock are not the only asset manager waiting on approval with 12 other applications being submitted to the SEC for approval. One can see the excitement at the possibility of both ETFs being approved in the Fear and Greed Index which has hit the 70 mark up from 47 a month ago and 65 last week.\n\nSource: FinancialJuice\n\nLOOKING AHEAD AT CRYPTO MARKETS, BITCOIN AND ETEHEREUM\n\nLooking at the week ahead and one thing which has become more apparent of late is that Bitcoin and Crypto seem to be at odds with market conditions. Just looking at developments since tension broke out in the Middle East and despite risk off sentiment for quite while Bitcoin and Crypto remained largely unaffected.\n\nThe recent fluctuations in the Dollar as well have largely left Crypto unaffected as markets grapple with whether Central Banks are done on the rate hike cycle. Looking at the week ahead and one of the major events that could come to fruition is a potential 8-day window between November 9-November 17 in which all 12 US Bitcoin spot ETF filings could be approved by the SEC. This came courtesy of Bloomberg Intelligence Analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas.\n\nRecommended by Zain Vawda Get Your Free Introduction To Cryptocurrency Trading Get My Guide\n\nIf this is true, this could turn out to be a big week for Crypto as I expect a lot of volatility and a potential surge in price in the days that follow. Demand for Bitcoin will likely skyrocket with another beneficiary likely to be Coinbase as well. This could be a game changer for the industry as a whole and put a mainstream stamp of approval at a time when the US Congress looks to crack down further on the Crypto Industry. Just this week we heard from SEC Chair Gensler who stated that Crypto is used for illicit activities. This was ramped up in the US Congress as well, which is why the approval of the Bitcoin ETF is even more important now.\n\nOn a data front we do have US CPI and PPI data releases which could have a huge impact on the US Dollar. The question that will remain though given the recent lack of US Dollar effect on BTCUSD, is whether any significant change in the US Dollar outlook will outweigh the current optimism around the crypto industry.\n\nFor all market-moving economic releases and events, see the DailyFX Calendar\n\nTECHNICAL OUTLOOK AND FINAL THOUGHTS\n\nLooking at the technical perspective and BTCUSD has had quite a sizeable run to the upside with very little retracement over the past month. This has seen the RSI (14) into overbought territory which could mean we are in for some form of retracement.\n\nHowever, the RSI is not always accurate and there is a chance we may see another rally toward the $40k mark before we do see a pullback. Now this will all depend on the Spot Bitcoin ETF application and if any news of approval or not develops in the week ahead.\n\nKey Levels to Keep an Eye On:\n\nSupport Levels\n\n36000\n\n34639\n\n34177\n\nResistance Levels\n\n37609\n\n40000\n\n42500\n\nBTC/USD Weekly Chart \u2013 November 10, 2023\n\nSource: TradingView\n\nETHEREUM\n\nLooking at the developments in ETHUSD on a weekly timeframe and this week puts ETH on course for its best week of gains since the week starting 10 April 2023. We have however run into a key level of resistance around the 2125 handle which was the YTD high, also printed in April 2023.\n\nETHUSD remains within a wedge pattern that has been in play since June-July of 2022. What is of more interest to me, however, is the MAs which are about to cross over with the 50-day MA eyeing a cross above the 200-day MA. We saw this on Bitcoin before the explosion toward the $38k high this week. SO, is history going to repeat itself?\n\nThe only apprehension here is that ETHUSD is currently on its 4th successive week of gains for the first time since January 2023. Then it was followed by some consolidation over the next 4 weeks. This may be the case as well given that Spot ETF Bitcoin approval could see some market participants opt to sell ETH and pile more into Bitcoin, the Good old FOMO.\n\nBTC/USD Daily Chart \u2013 November 10, 2023\n\nSource: TradingView\n\nKey Levels to Keep an Eye On:\n\nSupport Levels\n\n106.09\n\n105.63\n\n104.28\n\nResistance Levels\n\n107.20\n\n108.00\n\n109.50\n\nTrade Smarter - Sign up for the DailyFX Newsletter Receive timely and compelling market commentary from the DailyFX team Subscribe to Newsletter\n\nWritten by: Zain Vawda, Market Writer for DailyFX.com\n\nContact and follow Zain on Twitter: @zvawda"

        "title": "Crypto Giants: Solana, Ethereum, and Bitgert's Meteoric Rise and Latest Developments - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "The cryptocurrency market has been witnessing a surge in activity and interest in recent weeks, with several major coins reaching new highs or breaking records of the year. Among them are Solana, Ethereum, and Bitgert, three projects that have different features and advantages for investors. Here is a brief overview of the latest performance and developments of Solana, Ethereum, and the hot buzz, Bitgert.\n\nSolana (SOL):\n\nSolana (SOL) is a blockchain platform that aims to provide fast, scalable, and low-cost solutions for decentralized applications (DApps). Solana uses a novel consensus mechanism called Proof of History, which allows Solana to process thousands of transactions per second. Solana has recently recorded a significant milestone this year as Solana hit a high for 2023. On November 10, Solana reached $55.47, which was a 150% increase from the previous month and the highest price since May 2022.\n\nThe surge in Solana\u2019s price occurred amid the continuous selling of Solana (SOL) tokens by FTX\u2019s bankruptcy estate, which had 55.75 million SOL in its assets. However, the impact of the sales was limited by a weekly sale limit of $100 million and the possibility that some tokens were locked or vested. Solana also benefited from the growing demand for leverage longs. Solana\u2019s also witnessed increasing deposits and usage of DApps within the Solana ecosystem.\n\nEthereum (ETH):\n\nAlongside Solana, we have the mighty Ethereum (ETH). Ethereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization and the most popular platform for smart contracts and DApps. Ethereum also saw a 14% weekly spike and rallied to levels above $2,000 on November 11. Ethereum has become the most talked-about token, evident from the notable increase in social volume. The main reason behind Ethereum breaking the 2k resistance was the Nasdaq filing that highlighted the intentions of BlackRock to turn its iShares Ethereum Trust into a spot Ethereum Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF). This would be the first ETF of its kind in the US and would boost the liquidity and accessibility of Ethereum (ETH) for investors. Ethereum has witnessed the highest day of whale transactions in 3 months. Ethereum\u2019s social dominance seems to set the course for a positive sentiment in the market.\n\nBitgert (BRISE):\n\nNow that we have looked at Solana and Ethereum, let\u2019s look at the news hot buzz in town. Bitgert (BRISE), a full-suite crypto platform and blockchain, aims to revolutionize the electric vehicle (EV) industry by creating a blockchain-based platform that connects EV manufacturers, dealers, buyers, and service providers. Bitgert has announced the launch of its own EV car in Dubai in December 2023, which will be powered by solar energy and integrated with smart features. Bitgert\u2019s own native token, BRISE, will be used for transactions and rewards within the Bitgert ecosystem. Bitgert has been gaining momentum in the crypto market, reaching a peak of 0.0000001736 on November 11, which was a 37% increase from the previous month. This increase was driven by the anticipation of its EV launch and the growing adoption of its platform by various partners and customers.\n\nIf you are interested in buying Bitgert (BRISE), you will need to follow these steps:\n\n\u2013 Create an account on a crypto exchange that supports Bitgert\u2019s BRISE, such as PancakeSwap.\n\n\u2013 Deposit some funds into your account using fiat currency or another cryptocurrency.\n\n\u2013 Swap your funds for Bitgert\u2019s BRISE tokens at the current market rate.\n\n\u2013 Transfer your Bitgert tokens to a compatible wallet for safekeeping.\n\nYou can also buy Bitgert\u2019s BRISE directly from the Bitgert website using Binance Smart Chain (BSC) or Ethereum.\n\nThe upcoming EV launch in Dubai is expected to boost the demand and price of Bitgert\u2019s BRISE, as it will showcase the potential and innovation of Bitgert\u2019s platform. According to some analysts, BRISE could reach $0.00001, too.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

Analyzing CoinMarketCap data, a $100 investment in 2016 would yield $17,936, with ETH priced at $1,888 on November 9, 2023.\n\nNuggetRush (NUGX) introduces practical utility to meme coins, offering a play-to-earn (P2E) game where players build a mining empire, earning income through quests, battles, and tournaments. The game supports artisanal mining communities, making NUGX stand out.\n\nThe excitement in Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) community is intense as whales significantly increase their token holdings, reaching levels not seen since 2016. Meanwhile, a new player, NuggetRush (NUGX), is revolutionizing meme coins with practical utility and play-to-earn features, gaining significant attention in the presale stage. Can NuggetRush thrive to follow in Ethereum\u2019s lead?\n\n>>Buy NuggetRush Now<<\n\nEthereum (ETH) Whales Drive Excitement in the Market as Their Holdings Surge\n\nEthereum\u2019s community is excited as ETH whales have increased their token holdings considerably. On October 19, 2023, Santiment data showed the whales now control over 32% of the available ETH supply, a level not seen since 2016.\n\nFurthermore, Ethereum transactions exceeding $1 million recorded their second-highest volume in five weeks. These developments undoubtedly mark a historic moment in Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) history.\n\nBased on CoinMarketCap\u2019s historical data, the price of ETH on November 9, 2016, was $10.51 per coin. If you acquired $100 worth of Ethereum, you would have about 9.5 ETH.\n\nEthereum (ETH) traded at $1,888 on November 9, 2023. Thus, anyone who purchased the 9.5 ETH in 2016 and still holds the coins would be sitting on $17,936 in 2023. That is an impressive return on investment for Ethereum (ETH).\n\nWith such a high ROI, Ethereum (ETH) is undoubtedly among the top crypto coins to invest in currently. Its many use cases and increasing whale demand might help push it well above $2,000 by the end of 2023. Hence, it is a good crypto to buy today.\n\nDespite the x179 profits, a new entrant seems ready to compete with Ethereum (ETH) in the long term. NuggetRush has many features and utilities that have attracted many investors despite still being in the presale stage.\n\nNuggetRush (NUGX) Revolutionizes Meme Coins with Practical Utility and P2E Features\n\nPreviously, meme coins lacked practical utility and have always been highly volatile. Nonetheless, all that seems to have changed with the entry of NuggetRush (NUGX). Resembling other play-to-earn (P2E) games, NuggetRush (NUGX) allows players to earn an income using enjoyable in-game experiences.\n\n>>Buy NuggetRush Now<<\n\nNuggetRush (NUGX) consists of creating a mining empire through site discovery and teamwork. Players set up mining facilities, collect rare non-fungible tokens (NFTs), trade available in-game assets, and build expert teams to achieve \u201cmaster miner\u201d status. The status enables them to amass significant wealth through their mining empire.\n\nAdditionally, NuggetRush (NUGX) offers multiple income streams through in-game activities and operations. On that note, players earn rewards from quests, battles, and tournaments. They can also sell in-game collectibles on NuggetRush\u2019s marketplace.\n\nImpressively, this game supports artisanal mining communities in remote and underdeveloped nations. All these use cases undoubtedly make NUGX a great crypto to buy.\n\nNuggetRush\u2019s governance model offers Rush Guild members access to different areas and the power to vote for decisions connected to NUGX\u2019s ecosystem.\n\nPlayers can claim tokens as NuggetRush\u2019s presale progresses. Each round of this presale offers token-claiming chances for NUGX token holders. However, once NuggetRush\u2019s presale concludes, investors can claim any remaining tokens.\n\nNUGX surged from its Round 1 price of $0.010 to $0.012 in Round 2 of the presale, a 20% ROI. Analysts say NUGX has the potential to surge further by over x300 after listing on mainstream exchanges.

        "title": "Ethereum Insider Ready For Battle: ETH Founders' Fraud Proof Coming In 4-5 Days | Bitcoinist.com - Bitcoinist",
        "content": "Steven Nerayoff, one of the earliest advisors for Ethereum, has had various debates and discussions concerning Ethereum in the past few weeks. The former lawyer for the crypto firm has never wavered from his position that Vitalik Buterin and Joseph Lubin, the co-founders of Ethereum, engaged in fraudulent activity during the early days of the network and that the SEC was corrupt in its dealings with Ethereum.\n\nWhile speaking in a Space hosted on social media platform X, Nerayoff revealed he has recorded proof that could heavily implicate Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin.\n\nFormer Ethereum Advisor Claims to Have Proof of Fraud\n\nNerayoff has always asserted that the extent of fraud in the Ethereum ecosystem\u2019s early days surpasses the scale of the FTX scandal, which led to the exchange\u2019s bankruptcy. This saga has continued in this high-stakes battle over the transparency and decentralization of one of crypto\u2019s largest ecosystems.\n\nNerayoff had been initially talking with other speakers on the podcast about the SEC\u2019s plan to ultimately decide who and what becomes a security in the crypto industry before switching topics to the ETHGate scandal.\n\nAccording to Nerayoff, the Ethereum Foundation had run into troubles in 2015 as it actually looked like it was going under. Buterin reportedly ran to Nerayoff for help to save and restructure the foundation, as he had created the utility token and ICO for ETH.\n\nNerayoff mentioned this conversation with Vitalik ran up to three hours, and he had it recorded, and it is ready to be released as a free NFT and a transcript in the next four to five days.\n\n\u201cSo he asked me to restructure the entire Ethereum Foundation to save it and I\u2019ve got the whole thing recorded. I\u2019m going to drop it. We\u2019re doing it as an NFT. It\u2019s free, but everybody can have it,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Ethereum former advisor also talked about how the SEC basically gave a free pass to Ethereum amidst the ETH Gate scandal. The SEC had initially considered ETH\u2019s utility token as a security before former director Will Hinman gave a speech noting that BTC and ETH were decentralized and not securities. On the other hand, the SEC went after Ripple and XRP on claims of centralization.\n\nHowever, Nerayoff is of the notion that ETH was centralized when the speech was made, and neither Joe Lubin nor Vitalik Buterin could boast of its decentralization at that point. Furthermore, Nerayoff noted that there was internal documentation at that point that indicated that the network hadn\u2019t met the requirements in order for it to be decentralized.\n\nThis internal documentation was reportedly only accessible by Nerayoff, prompting regulators to go after him on charges of extortion. Prosecutors have since dropped these charges, but Nerayoff claims it was all a setup. He also claimed the SEC, FBI, and the DOJ fabricated the evidence, and it was all done in a bid to take him out.\n\nNerayoff\u2019s accusations have been explosive and threaten to shake investor confidence in Ethereum. Many members of the XRP community have also questioned the SEC\u2019s inconsistencies.\n\nNerayoff failed to go into details of his conversation with Buterin, and he said he wasn\u2019t going to mention which particular laws were broken. Still, he did insinuate that it contained proof that Ethereum\u2019s early founders themselves did not believe the network was decentralized during its launch.\n\nThe release of Nerayoff\u2019s recording could spur legal action against Buterin and other ETH founders. When asked if his recorded evidence could lead to criminal charges for Buterin and Lubin, Nerayoff said that\u2019s up to the SEC and the DOJ.\n\nETH bulls still holding price steady above $2,000 | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nFeatured image from Cryptopolitan, chart from Tradingview.com"
