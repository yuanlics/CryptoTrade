        "content": "Image Source: Getty Images\n\nEthereum (ETH 2.46%) is the decentralized, open-source technology that powers much of the crypto world. Everything from decentralized finance (DeFi) applications and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to enterprise blockchain solutions relies on Ethereum's technology. Ethereum's native token, Ether, is the second-largest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin (BTC 5.7%). The Ethereum Merge, the network's long-awaited shift to a proof-of-stake system, is expected to make the technology remarkably more energy-efficient. The Ethereum Foundation has predicted the shift will cut energy usage by around 99.95%. If you want to profit from the growing use of Ethereum, there are several ways you can invest. The most direct option is buying Ethereum itself. Because it's extremely volatile, this carries the greatest risk but also the greatest potential profits. Another option is buying Ethereum stocks, including managed funds that invest in Ethereum for you and companies with large exposure to Ethereum technology.\n\nWhat is Ethereum? Ethereum is an open-source blockchain technology in the form of software. Software developer Vitalik Buterin originally proposed the idea in 2013, and Ethereum launched in 2015. Any developer making an application that would benefit from blockchain technology can build it on the Ethereum network. While Ethereum is most associated with its native Ether token and other cryptocurrencies, its technology is also enabling widespread innovation in industries as diverse as insurance, logistics, and healthcare. Developers write programs on Ethereum using self-executing, self-enforcing protocols called smart contracts, which are deployed to Ethereum-powered blockchains. The blockchain's network of computers executes the smart contract by performing specified actions when the conditions of the contract are met. Blockchain data can't be modified after it's created, and that gives users confidence in the technology. Although early cryptocurrencies, most notably Bitcoin, are merely stores of value that can be transferred, Ethereum has more uses. If Bitcoin is a smartphone app, Ethereum is more like the device maker. Ethereum's cryptocurrency benefits from its technology because transaction fees for decentralized applications on its blockchain are paid in Ether. What is the Ethereum Merge? The Ethereum Merge is the term for the network's switch from its original proof-of-work system to a proof-of-stake system, scheduled to occur in mid-September 2022. When Ethereum launched, it used proof of work, the same system used by Bitcoin, to validate and record transactions. A notable drawback of this system is extremely high energy usage, which has led to Bitcoin using more power per year than some entire countries. In 2020, Ethereum introduced the Beacon Chain, a proof-of-stake network. However, it continued using its original proof-of-work mainnet for processing transactions. The Merge is when Ethereum will combine the Beacon Chain with the mainnet and make the transition to proof of stake. The primary benefit of The Merge is energy efficiency. Transaction speeds will change a small amount but not enough for most users to notice.\n\nTop Ethereum stocks Here are the best stocks to buy if you want to add Ethereum to your portfolio: 1. Grayscale Ethereum Trust The Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE 2.67%) is a managed fund that makes it easy to add Ethereum to your brokerage account. Each share is backed by a fixed amount of Ether tokens (approximately 0.01 Ether per share). Keep in mind that the fund's share price is often lower than the value of Ethereum at the prevailing conversion rate. Grayscale also charges a somewhat expensive annual management fee of 2.5%. Shareholders can't exchange shares for Ethereum, so there's no price arbitrage opportunity. 2. Bitwise Ethereum Fund Bitwise is the world's biggest crypto index fund manager. It offers managed funds for multiple types of cryptocurrency, and one option is the Bitwise Ethereum Fund. The fund is available to accredited investors and has a minimum investment of $25,000. The fund's managers seek to minimize transaction costs, and they hold the fund's Ethereum offline in cold crypto storage, making it a cost-efficient and secure Ethereum stock. There's an annual management fee of 1.5%. If you want a more diverse digital asset portfolio, check out the Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund (BITW 4.43%), which includes a mix of several of the top cryptocurrencies. 3. Coinbase Coinbase (COIN 2.72%) is the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the U.S. The company charges transaction fees to buyers and sellers of a wide range of cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum. In addition to Ethereum, many other cryptocurrencies traded on Coinbase use the Ethereum blockchain. The exchange rolled out Ethereum staking in 2021, allowing investors to lock up their Ether and earn rewards on it during the upgrade to a proof-of-stake system. Coinbase's staking program is expected to significantly benefit from the completion of The Merge. Analysis from Goldman Sachs (GS 0.15%) predicts that Coinbase will generate $250 million to $600 million in additional revenue from Ethereum staking. 4. Staked ETH Trust The Staked ETH Trust is the first traditional investment vehicle that allowed shareholders to get Ethereum exposure and receive staking rewards. It's open by private placement to accredited investors, with a minimum investment amount of $25,000 and an expense ratio of 1%. Considering the attention that Ethereum staking is getting from The Merge, the fund could become very popular. The staking rewards allow the trust's underlying Ether holdings to grow about 7.5% annually, helping it to outperform non-staking funds. The biggest advantage of the Staked ETH Trust is how much it simplifies staking for investors. You invest in it by buying shares, like any traditional investment vehicle, and the staking itself is handled by the fund administrator. 5. Robinhood Markets Robinhood Markets (HOOD 4.23%) may be best known as the discount broker that ushered in the age of commission-free trading. That's not the only way it has been ahead of the game. In 2018, it began offering crypto trading of Bitcoin and Ethereum. The broker has since expanded its selection to include a few other cryptocurrencies, including Litecoin (LTC 0.18%) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH -1.93%). Although Robinhood isn't a pure cryptocurrency play, it does offer some exposure to Ethereum.\n\nHow to invest in Ethereum If you want to directly invest in Ethereum, you can buy it through a crypto exchange, a stock broker, or even a payment app that carries it. Since Ethereum is one of the largest cryptocurrencies by market cap, it's available on almost all platforms that sell crypto. Here are the different types of platforms you can use to buy Ethereum: Cryptocurrency exchanges : The exchanges let users buy, sell, and trade cryptocurrencies. Examples of popular crypto exchanges include Coinbase and Gemini.\n\nThe exchanges let users buy, sell, and trade cryptocurrencies. Examples of popular crypto exchanges include Coinbase and Gemini. Stock brokers : Some stock brokers have started selling select cryptocurrencies, with Robinhood being the most prominent example.\n\nSome stock brokers have started selling select cryptocurrencies, with Robinhood being the most prominent example. Payment apps: You can buy and sell crypto, including Ethereum, on PayPal ( PYPL 1.4% For serious crypto investors, a crypto exchange is usually the best option. Exchanges offer the widest selection of cryptocurrencies and the most features. They also let you transfer your crypto off the exchange to a crypto wallet that you control. Stock brokers and payment apps often don't let you transfer your crypto anywhere. Related investing topics:\n\nShould you invest in Ethereum? Ethereum technology is at the core of most blockchain applications. Many believe blockchain will play a significant role in the future of finance and other industries, making exposure to Ethereum technology a potentially profitable addition to your investment portfolio. The value of Ether as a digital currency is much more volatile and unpredictable than the growth of Ethereum technology. You can mitigate some of that risk and should take steps to guard against hacking, but, ultimately, the value of any investment directly linked to Ether is likely to fluctuate. Any of the above investment recommendations deserves consideration, especially if you believe that the development of blockchain technology is only just beginning.\n\nEthereum FAQs What is ethereum? angle-down angle-up Ethereum is a blockchain technology in the form of software.

        "content": "The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization continued to push past year-long highs, as Bitcoin approached $38,000 late Thursday morning, an approximately 7% increase in the past 24 hours, according to data from CoinGecko. Its peak of $37,935 was the highest the coin has reached in more than 18 months.\n\nEther, the token for the Ethereum blockchain and second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was also up, crossing the $2,000 mark for the first time since July on the back of an 8% day-over-day price upswing.\n\nThe market capitalization for all cryptocurrencies increased approximately 5.4% day-over-day to $1.45 trillion, as some of the other largest coins on the market saw large gains as of Thursday morning, including Cardano (8.2%), Solana (9.9%), and Chainlink (12.7%). The movements in the crypto markets far outpaced the stock indices, with the NASDAQ and S&P 500 basically flat over the past 24 hours.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s recent upswing is mainly due to \u201coptimism around a near-term spot Bitcoin ETF approval and a resulting short-squeeze,\u201d Brian Rudick, a senior strategist at crypto trading firm GSR, told Fortune, referring to a Bitcoin-based financial product that traditional investors can trade. And on Thursday morning, BlackRock registered the name \u201ciShares Ethereum Trust\u201d in Delaware, an indication \u201cthat it is likely to file a spot ether ETF application soon,\u201d he added.\n\nDavid Lawant, head of research at crypto brokerage and trading platform FalconX, echoed Rudick\u2019s assessment. Bitcoin \u201ccontinues to perform well as the market focuses on the U.S. spot ETF approval process,\u201d he told Fortune, adding that the \u201cbig star of the day\u201d has been Ethereum, following news of BlackRock\u2019s registration of the \u201ciShares Ethereum Trust\u201d name.\n\nThe rapid rise in the prices of major cryptocurrencies continues a month-long rally in the digital assets market. The total market capitalization for all cryptocurrencies has rocketed about 30% since Oct. 9, rising alongside optimism over the likely approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF, or exchange-traded fund.\n\nTraditional investors, who manage trillions of dollars in capital, are largely constrained by the investment products available on portfolio management platforms like Vanguard or TD Ameritrade. If the Securities and Exchange Commission were to approve a spot Bitcoin ETF, which lets traditional investors trade on current Bitcoin prices, crypto industry boosters are betting that tremendous amounts of capital would flow into the Bitcoin\u2014and crypto\u2014markets.\n\nWhile the industry has repeatedly tried and failed to convince the SEC to approve a spot Bitcoin ETF, BlackRock, the largest asset manager in the world, filed an application for its own spot Bitcoin ETF in June. Since then, the crypto markets have rallied, and other financial institutions have filed their own ETF applications, hoping to cash in if the SEC were to approve the application from BlackRock, which has a sterling record of past ETF approvals.\n\nAnd starting Thursday, a brief period for the SEC to approve a spot Bitcoin ETF opened, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analysts, who believe that, even if approvals don't come in November, there is a 90% chance of approval by January.\n\n\"There is significant hype surrounding the recent comments from Bloomberg regarding the ETF 'window,'\" James Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares, told Fortune. \"Admittedly, it is always a little worrying when prices rise so sharply. That said, as we enter into this new bull market, it is worth reflecting on the point that we remain well below the all-time-highs seen in 2021.\""

The price of Ether (ETH/USD) spiked roughly 7% before paring back some of those gains.\n\nBlackrock made a similar move with iShares Bitcoin Trust roughly one week before applying for a spot bitcoin ETF with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nThe possibility of a spot bitcoin ETF receiving approval from the SEC has been all the talk in the crypto industry ever since Blackrock originally filed for its offering in June of this year. Bitcoin's (BTC/USD) price is up more than 40% since that application was filed. Analysts from Bloomberg, JPMorgan Chase, and elsewhere see an approval of at least one spot bitcoin ETF by January of next year as very likely.\n\nA number of futures-based Ether ETFs were already launched roughly one month ago, but they have failed to gain much traction. At this time, it is unclear if Blackrock's potential Ether ETF would be based on futures or spot offerings. It is thought that a spot Ether ETF would have major implications for the crypto asset in terms of putting it on a similar regulatory footing as bitcoin in the eyes of the SEC."

        "title": "The Power of Decentralization: Unpacking Ethereum's Vision - Green Bay Press Gazette",
        "content": "William Mullane\n\nContributor\n\nImagine a future where power and control are distributed among the masses rather than concentrated in the hands of a few. This is the vision of the blockchain platform, Ethereum. Driven by the mission to decentralize the web, Ethereum aims to redefine the future of technologies, democratizing the web as never seen before.\n\nAt its core, Ethereum is a decentralized platform that enables developers to build and deploy smart contracts, which are self-executing agreements with predefined conditions. These smart contracts run on a blockchain, a distributed ledger that is maintained and validated by a network of computers, or nodes, rather than a central authority. This decentralization ensures transparency, security, and resilience, as no single entity has the power to manipulate or control the system.\n\nEthereum's vision extends far beyond financial applications like cryptocurrencies. It seeks to create a global, open-source platform where developers can build decentralized applications (DApps) without relying on intermediaries or central authorities. This democratization of application development opens up a world of possibilities. Imagine a future where social media platforms are truly decentralized, putting control over data and content in the hands of users rather than centralized corporations. And would give individuals the autonomy to choose how their personal information is used and shared\u2014while fostering an environment of innovation and free expression.\n\nMoreover, Ethereum's vision has profound implications for industries beyond the digital realm. By introducing the concept of programmable money, Ethereum enables the automation of complex financial transactions, eliminating the need for intermediaries and reducing costs. This has the potential to revolutionize sectors such as remittances, lending, and insurance, making financial services more accessible and affordable for individuals around the globe.\n\nFurthermore, Ethereum's technology can play a pivotal role in transforming supply chain management. By leveraging blockchain's transparency and immutability, businesses can trace the journey of products from their origin to the end consumer. This not only ensures authenticity and quality control but also promotes ethical practices and sustainability. Try to picture a world where consumers can verify the authenticity of a product, verify its ingredients, and trace its carbon footprint with a simple scan of their smartphones. Ethereum's vision brings us closer to this reality.\n\nHealthcare is another sector that stands to benefit from Ethereum's decentralized approach. By securely storing and sharing medical records on a blockchain, patients can maintain control over their health data while enabling seamless access for healthcare providers. This could lead to more accurate diagnoses, better coordination of care, and enhanced medical research. The potential to save lives and improve the efficiency of healthcare systems is both inspiring and game-changing.\n\nTo join the decentralized revolution and be a part of Ethereum's vision, learn how to buy Ethereum and become a proud owner of this pioneering cryptocurrency. Ethereum is not just about a technological shift; it is about a shift in power dynamics\u2014a shift from the few to the many, from opaque to transparent, and from exclusive to inclusive. And, as Ethereum's vision unfolds, the implications of this shift will reshape our digital world in profound ways. This is not merely a promise of what might be but a reflection of what is already in motion, galvanizing a future where everyone has a stake and a voice. This is Ethereum's aspiration: a decentralized world empowered by its people.\n\nThis is for informational purposes only. Please invest at your own risk."

        "content": "BlackRock has taken the initial step toward filing for a spot Ether ETF, with the iShares Ethereum Trust recently registered in Delaware.\n\nThis move is reminiscent of BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust, which was registered in a similar fashion seven days before the ETF application was filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nIn the context of an industry bristling with anticipation for the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF, BlackRock\u2019s move potentially signals a pivotal moment for Ethereum, shedding light on its status as a prospective asset class in institutional investment portfolios.\n\nDespite the positive indications, it\u2019s important to recall the precedent set by the SEC\u2019s handling of Bitcoin ETFs. As reported by CryptoSlate in October 2023 Source, despite rumors indicating otherwise, the SEC had not approved the iShares Bitcoin ETF. The regulator had delayed its verdict on several proposed rule changes, which included applications from leading firms such as Fidelity (Wise Origin), VanEck, WisdomTree, and Invesco.\n\nIn light of this, BlackRock\u2019s iShares Ethereum Trust registration, while a significant development, leads us into a territory of considerable uncertainty. The SEC\u2019s previous hesitance to approve Bitcoin ETFs might cast a long shadow over BlackRock\u2019s budding Ethereum trust, potentially heralding a new cycle of applications, approvals, delays, and rejections.\n\nAs the crypto community watches these developments with bated breath, two things have been game-changers for the industry: Grayscale\u2019s court victory and BlackRock\u2019s entry into the market. Ethereum ETFs, in this context, may just be the next frontier. However, for now, all eyes are trained on the SEC as the crypto industry awaits its verdict on the pending rule changes and the potential approval of BlackRock\u2019s iShares Ethereum Trust.\n\nBlackRock\u2019s Ethereum Trust filing surfaces as another key narrative to monitor closely. As the crypto industry continues to evolve and mature, such developments underscore the increasing intersectionality of traditional finance and digital asset markets, hinting at a prospective future where digital currencies like Ethereum may become more commonplace in institutional investment portfolios."

        "content": "The Ethereum network has made the switch from proof-of-work mining to proof-of-stake mining. The transition was completed successfully on September 15, 2022. Additionally, the blockchain went through some major changes as validators replaced miners.\n\nRecently, the much-awaited Shapella upgrade went live, allowing these speakers to withdraw their staked Ethereum 2.0. Additionally, with numerous developments on the Ethereum blockchain, let us learn about ETH a bit more.\n\nEthereum in a nutshell\n\nVitalik Buterin built the decentralized blockchain platform Ethereum in 2015, along with the Ethereum Foundation, to support the development and execution of smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). Additionally, it has developed to become one of the biggest and most popular cryptocurrencies in the world. Ethereum is distinguished from Bitcoin by its programmability.\n\nAlso read: Ben Armstrong Sues Ex-Colleagues Over Alleged Stolen Lamborghini\n\nThe blockchain has grown to accommodate a wide range of applications. Developers on the ETH network can design decentralized applications by using smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts with predefined rules. Additionally, over time, ETH has grown to be the second-largest cryptocurrency in the world.\n\nEthereum Price on Black Friday 2022\n\nAccording to historical data, Ethereum was trading lower than its current market price of $2000 on Black Friday 2022. On November 25, 2022, the price of ETH touched $1203. Additionally, the price surged following Black Friday on the next day to $1227.\n\nCryptocurrency experts at Changelly have predicted the price of Ethereum for Black Friday 2023. Analysts expect ETH to reach a minimum of $1,887 and a maximum of $2,089. Experts also predict Ethereum\u2019s average cost to sit around $2,089.\n\nAlso read: Nearly Half of CFTC Cases in 2023 Targeted Crypto\n\nExamining the historical pricing of an asset can provide crucial context for understanding both current valuation and future performance potential. By analyzing past price actions and trends, investors can identify key support and resistance levels that may continue to be relevant.\n\nHistorical prices also allow investors to compute useful metrics like trading volume and volatility over different periods of time. This can aid in assessing risk and forecasting potential future moves.\n\nWhether the Ethereum price can go up during Black Friday 2023 can vary greatly depending on market sentiment. However, if the market proves to be bullish moving forward, ETH\u2019s price can shoot up."

        "title": "Why Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin Were Up Today - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "The crypto industry is once again moving higher, and three of the biggest cryptocurrencies are leading the way. As of 2 p.m. ET Friday, Bitcoin (BTC 5.28%) was up by 3% from where it traded when the stock market closed Thursday, Ethereum (ETH 2.29%) was up 4%, and Dogecoin (DOGE 0.84%) was up 5.3%.\n\nCryptocurrencies have been volatile over the past year, but have been charging higher since mid-October.\n\nBehind the rise in cryptocurrencies\n\nThe biggest news out relating to crypto Friday is that BlackRock (BLK -0.68%) is pursuing an Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF), just as it has been trying to get permission to launch a Bitcoin ETF. There are already ways for investors to buy crypto on traditional exchanges, but they're not as efficient as ETFs, which is why BlackRock and others are trying to get ETFs approved.\n\nIn theory, more options for investing in crypto will lead to more money pouring into tokens, which will drive prices higher. That's why traders are getting out in front of any ETF approvals, and they could bid values higher.\n\nRight now, the barrier preventing such ETFs from reaching the market is the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which has neither approved crypto ETFs nor laid out rules around cryptocurrencies in general. That has left the industry in limbo, and Congress has yet to agree on a regulatory framework for crypto either. Based on BlackRock's involvement, many investors speculate that ETFs could be the one way to make crypto more mainstream as the SEC and Congress wait to act.\n\nThe interesting thing is, it's not just Bitcoin and Ethereum that are moving higher on the speculation about Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs -- all of the major cryptocurrencies are moving higher as investors expect there will eventually be a flood of crypto ETF products.\n\nGrowth on the blockchain\n\nDespite the drop in crypto prices over the last couple of years, the industry continues to develop, and businesses and developers are creating more meaningful projects on blockchains. Visa is testing using blockchains to complete payments, and so are Shopify and MercadoLibre. There are dozens, if not hundreds, of other projects underway at companies around the world.\n\nThis is the kind of activity that's going to drive value to cryptocurrencies and the blockchain, but investors are currently just speculating about possible future value creation. I tend to think there will be value, but the moves recently aren't necessarily indicative of long-term value.\n\nWhat I would watch for is where developers are building on the blockchain. It's not Bitcoin or Dogecoin that are getting activity -- it's blockchains like Ethereum and Solana that are built for utility and more activity that will ultimately benefit.\n\nI would also expect to see the jump in value subside even if ETFs are approved, based on the \"buy the rumor, sell the news\" pattern. That's why I'm not jumping in on the crypto bounce right now. But I will hold on for the ride as this industry matures."

        "content": "Ether's price broke through the $2,000 mark for the first time since July, rallying amidst news that BlackRock appeared to take an initial step in the possible offering of a spot Ethereum ETH +3.21% ETF with a filing to register a new iShares Ethereum Trust entity in Delaware\n\nEther's price jumped over 7% on Thursday to $2,040, at 12:15 p.m. ET, according to CoinGecko. Bitcoin also made notable gains, reaching a daily high of $37,925 before falling back in a swathe of long liquidations to $36,311.\n\nThursday's market uptick is part of a multi-faceted event-led rally, according to analysts at Bitfinex. \"We believe that we are in an accumulation phase for the next cycle and the bottom could very well be in place,\" Bitfinex analysts told The Block.\n\nMarket rally spurred by spot ETF narrative\n\nCoinShares Head of Research James Butterfill said Thursday's price spike was also triggered by spot ETF-related remarks made by Bloomberg Intelligence analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart. On Thursday, a window opened for the SEC to \"theoretically issue approval orders\" for a spot bitcoin ETF, they wrote.\n\n\"A brief window opens on November 9 for the SEC to potentially approve all 12 U.S. spot bitcoin ETF applicants, including Grayscale's GBTC. Even if approvals don't arrive this month, we still believe there's a 90% chance of approval by January 10,\" the Bloomberg analysts noted.\n\nHowever, speaking to The Block, Butterfill cautioned against predicting whether approvals will materialize within this window. The CoinShares analyst added that markets are extremely sensitive to the spot ETF topic.\n\n\"This sensitivity was evident in our recent investor survey, where nearly 60% of investor concerns were centered on government regulation. Therefore, any positive news in this area is likely to be, and has been, eagerly seized upon by investors,\" he added.\n\nFactors driving price appreciation\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nAnalysts see more factors involved in bitcoin's recent price spike. Apart from anticipation over the possible approval of a spot bitcoin ETF, these include bullish movements in the macroeconomic environment, such as major U.S. indices clocking their longest winning streaks in two years, and a shift in the bitcoin market share from short-term holders to long-term holders.\n\n\"This bullish attitude is caused by the synergy of ETF approval expectations and optimism in the U.S. stock market. I think we have a great chance to see a $40,000 level for bitcoin in the near future,\" YouHodler Chief of Markets Ruslan Lienkha told The Block.\n\nLienkha added Thursday's rally looks like it will sustain, \"as interest rates for stablecoins are skyrocketing in the crypto world right now.\"\n\nMajor stock indices post in multi-week gains\n\nRisk assets are catching tailwinds in the wider economy. On Wednesday, the S&P 500 logged its eighth straight session in the green, and the Nasdaq clocked its ninth straight day of gains, its longest winning streak in two years.\n\nYet, James Butterfill does not perceive today's market rally as a response to broader market events. \"Bitcoin has been gradually decoupling from equities since the beginning of 2023, so the correlation between bitcoin and equities has significantly dropped from 72% to just 20% as of now,\" he said.\n\nFRNT Financial Head of Data Strahinja Savic highlighted blockchain data revealing a decline in bitcoin short-term holder supply, with the trend contributing to an upward price trajectory during a phase of increased demand. \"For instance, 69% of bitcoin has moved for over a year, suggesting the majority of investors hodling,\" he noted."

        "content": "Happy Friday. The week is ending on a high note for Ethereum, which is back in the news after financial giant BlackRock filed to launch an ETF backed by Ether, the blockchain\u2019s native currency. This led the price to jump 10%, back over the $2,000 mark, for the first time in months as investors bet that BlackRock\u2019s entry will attract billions of dollars in new capital.\n\nThis development brings renewed attention to the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency, which has largely been overshadowed by Bitcoin and even Solana during the long-awaited rally of the last two months. But while Ethereum boosters are rightfully enjoying the price surge, the return of the spotlight has also raised some familiar concerns.\n\nThese include griping about Ethereum\u2019s transactions costs, known as gas fees, which have soared along with the burst of activity on the blockchain that has come with more trading. For long-time crypto watchers, this will bring back unpleasant memories of 2017 and 2021 when hype over Ethereum\u2019s smart contract promise led to a surge in price\u2014followed by the blockchain slowing to a crawl, which in turn forced those who wanted to transact to pay outrageous fees.\n\nEthereum\u2019s momentous shift last year to a proof-of-stake system was supposed to alleviate the price and congestion issues, along with so-called layer-2 solutions\u2014sub-layers on the network that process transactions in batches and then record them on the main blockchain.\n\nThe trouble is that while the layer-2 systems do indeed lower costs dramatically, they add complexity and make the Ethereum user experience\u2014already an ordeal for those who aren\u2019t crypto diehards\u2014even more of a headache. They are also less secure. This has led some to gripe that Ethereum should have devoted its energy to making its main network cheaper and efficient rather than outsourcing the task to other projects.\n\nFinally, the switch to proof of stake has also raised concerns over centralization as a relatively small amount of validators are now responsible for maintaining the network\u2014a fact that Bitcoin purists, never gracious at the best of times, have lampooned mercilessly as part of the crypto world\u2019s eternal infighting.\n\nNone of this means that Ethereum is facing major trouble\u2014the network is the leading smart contract for a reason, with by far the most users and a robust and dedicated developer community. But as a new crypto bull market emerges, it will be harder for the platform to blame familiar headaches on growing pains. Ethereum is now almost a decade old, and the time has come for it to show it can deliver on its enormous potential.\n\nJeff John Roberts\n\njeff.roberts@fortune.com\n\n@jeffjohnroberts\n\nDECENTRALIZED NEWS\n\nChainlink's LINK token is up 175% since January as the oracle provider has branched out from pure crypto pricing to tie-ups with the TradFi sector.

They just submitted a 19b-4 filing with Nasdaq pic.twitter.com/pLhuhhK7jo \u2014 James Seyffart (@JSeyff) November 9, 2023\n\nThis pivotal move signals a possible imminent introduction of Ethereum-spot ETFs and has sparked a notable rally in the crypto market. Ethereum (ETH) has notably surged after the news, topping the $2,000 mark, hitting a significant milestone in its market journey.\n\nThis development reflects a deepening institutional interest in cryptocurrencies, especially Ethereum, hinting at the possibility of even higher valuations. With the United States Securities and Exchanges Commission (SEC) closely monitoring these events, the approval of Ethereum-spot ETFs could play a crucial role in shaping Ethereum\u2019s market performance in the coming months.\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum\u2019s price has rebounded, revisiting its highest point of the year, last observed in mid-April. Could this development spark a new annual high by year-end?\n\nETH Price Analysis\n\nEthereum\u2019s price has been underperforming compared to the rest of the market in the year\u2019s second half. Unlike Bitcoin and many other altcoins, that have achieved new yearly highs since mid-April, ETH has revisited $2,100 only today.\n\nThere was a possibility that the recovery since June last year was corrective, but the uptrend from October 12 invalidated that idea. This move can now be considered the starting impulse in a larger bull cycle, possibly forming a slightly ascending triangle, which could be seen as a leading diagonal.\n\nIf this holds true, the recent uptrend from October 12 may be its final wave. There is room for further interaction with the slightly ascending resistance level around $2250. But the five-wave pattern suggests it may have already completed or is close to doing so.\n\nEarly signs of selling pressure are apparent with a red candle on the daily chart. The RSI is at 80%, indicating overbought conditions, making a downturn more likely than a significant uptrend continuation.\n\nThe leading diagonal that began last June may conclude soon, likely leading to the first bull market correction and establishing the first macro higher low, preferably above the $1350 range.\n\nThe target will depend on the endpoint of the ascending pattern, so close monitoring of the price in the coming period is advisable.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nPlease note that the contents of this article are not financial or investing advice.

        "content": "A website for the Delaware Department of State Division of Corporations shows that BlackRock Advisors filed today for an iShares Ethereum ETH +3.21% Trust entity.\n\nThe filing indicates that BlackRock could be doubling down on crypto. The world's largest asset manager is currently awaiting a decision on its spot bitcoin ETF application from the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nA BlackRock spokesperson declined to comment to The Block. Ether's price has jumped nearly 8% today to around $2,040.\n\nBlackRock's bitcoin ETF filing\n\nBlackRock filed for the iShares Bitcoin Trust in June of this year, which moved markets. The iShares brand is associated with BlackRock's exchange-traded fund products. The iShares Bitcoin Trust filing was a registration statement with the SEC, with details such as its custodian (Coinbase Custody Trust Company) and benchmark (the CME CF Bitcoin Reference Rate from Administrator CF Benchmarks, a subsidiary of Kraken).\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nAn iShares Ethereum Trust filing doesn't yet appear on the SEC's website. But notably, the iShares Bitcoin Trust entity was first registered in the Delaware state seven days before BlackRock filed the ETF application with the SEC. That suggests the iShares Ethereum Trust filing might appear on the SEC website next week.\n\nThe SEC is currently reviewing multiple spot bitcoin ETF applications, including one from BlackRock. The asset manager's bitcoin ETF ticker, IBTC, has also appeared on the Depository Trust & Clearing Corp's website since August but was noticed only late last month.\n\nBig trading firms, including Jane Street, Virtu Financial, and Jump Trading, are reportedly already in talks to provide liquidity for BlackRock's proposed spot bitcoin ETF if it obtains regulatory approval. Bitcoin's price has rallied over the past month due to the prospect of a spot bitcoin ETF approval. Earlier this month, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said that a rally in the price of bitcoin triggered by a false news report that said its spot ETF was approved served as an example of \"pent-up interest in crypto.\""

        "title": "Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC) Prices Collapse After Stunning Rally - U.Today",
        "content": "Advertisement\n\nEthereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC) experienced a sudden downturn after what many investors saw as a promising rally. Ethereum's price on the Bitstamp exchange took a sharp dive, falling to $1,973 following a peak of $2,050 earlier in the trading session.\n\nBTC mirrored this fall, plunging down to $35,600 from its day's high of $37,972.\n\nMassive liquidations\n\nIn the span of one hour, the market saw $11.22 million worth of liquidations, according to CoinGlass data. The liquidations were almost evenly split between long positions ($5.67 million) and short positions ($5.55 million).\n\nLooking at a broader timeframe of four hours, the liquidations escalated significantly to $280.76 million. The majority of this amount came from long position liquidations, which totaled $174.08 million, compared to $106.68 million from short positions.\n\nIn a full day, the total liquidations amounted to $475.71 million. Interestingly, in this timeframe, the trend reversed, with short positions seeing more liquidations ($268.07 million) than long positions ($207.64 million).\n\nSpeculation about crypto ETFs\n\nThe crypto community is now abuzz with speculation following the registration of the iShares Ethereum Trust in Delaware.\n\nThis move is reminiscent of the registration of BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust, which occurred just a week before their formal ETF application with the SEC.\n\nThe registration is seen by many as a precursor to mainstream adoption that could potentially pave the way for increased institutional investment in Ethereum.\n\nMeanwhile, the possibility of a Bitcoin ETF in the United States seems to be gaining ground. Analyst Alex Dovbnya has reported a potential \"tsunami\" of spot Bitcoin ETF approvals by January 2024. Seyffart from Bloomberg Intelligence cites a \"90% chance\" by early January 2024."

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nGrayscale's Ethereum Trust (ETHE) has seen its discount narrow significantly, dropping to 16%. This marks a substantial change from its nearly 30% discount a month ago and close to 60% earlier this year.\n\nNate Geraci, an industry analyst, suggests that this trend could be interpreted as a gauge of market expectations regarding the approval of a spot ether ETF.\n\nCurrently, ETHE stands at an impressive $6 billion in assets under management (AUM).\n\nGrayscale's new conversion effort\n\nAs reported by U.Today, Grayscale, the leading crypto asset manager, has applied to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to convert its ETHE into a spot Ethereum ETF.\n\nETHE, launched in early 2019, has become the foremost Ether investment vehicle globally, accounting for 2.5% of the chief altcoin's total circulating supply.\n\nThis followed Grayscale's recent legal victory against the formidable regulator. A federal appeals court has ruled in their favor regarding their Bitcoin trust's ETF conversion application, thus adding momentum to their Ethereum efforts.\n\nConverting the trust into a spot ETF would be a significant development for the company and the crypto market. ETFs are well-known and widely used investment vehicles that are familiar to both retail and institutional investors. This familiarity could attract a broader investor base to Ether. This would enhance liquidity and potentially stabilize the market. Additionally, ETFs generally offer lower fees and greater transparency compared to trusts, making them more appealing to cost-conscious investors.\n\nBlackRock's Ethereum ETF plan\n\nIn parallel, BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, has revealed its intention to bet big on Ethereum. Recently, the financial titan registered the iShares Ethereum Trust and partnered with Nasdaq, intending to list and trade shares of this trust.\n\nFollowing this announcement, Ethereum's price experienced a surge, reaching a high of nearly $2,150.\n\nBlackRock is also attempting to launch a spot Bitcoin ETF. Analysts believe that the SEC is very likely to greenlight such a product in the near future.\n\nLarry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, has notably shifted from skepticism to becoming a vocal crypto proponent."

        "content": "The price of ethereum jumped about 10% on Thursday on news that BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, filed to launch an ETF that tracks the spot price of the cryptocurrency.\n\nEthereum rose above $2,000 and reached its highest price since April. The token was trading at $2,095 on Friday afternoon.\n\nNasdaq filed a 19b-4 form with the SEC on Nov. 9 to launch the ETF. The fund would be called the iShares Ethereum Trust if approved. BlackRock registered the ETF's ethereum trust in Delaware earlier Thursday.\n\nWhile investors have been anticipating a potentially imminent spot bitcoin ETF approval, many see a spot ether fund as the next step after the SEC greenlights bitcoin, if it does.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission allows exchange-traded funds that track bitcoin and ether futures contracts, but has rejected applications for spot bitcoin ETFs on the grounds that the vehicles would be susceptible to market manipulation and fraud.\n\n\u201cGiven the SEC had approved both bitcoin- and ethereum futures-based ETFs, it makes sense that following any approval of a spot bitcoin ETF by the SEC, approval of a spot ethereum ETF would follow closely,\u201d said Bradley Duke, chief strategy officer at ETC Group.\n\nWhen BlackRock first filed for a spot bitcoin ETF in June, the price of bitcoin rose. Because BlackRock is a long-established Wall Street player, the firm\u2019s interest in cryptocurrency ETFs is a pathway to the asset class reaching a market of traditional finance investors if approved.\n\nEthereum ETFs\n\nFor digital-asset investors, ethereum has a unique set of use cases independent from bitcoin.\n\n\u201cYou could point to applications built on ethereum that have hundreds of thousands of users on a daily basis; that just resonates with financial advisors at a level,\u201d said Matt Hougan, chief investment officer of Bitwise.\n\nYet ether futures-based ETFs have garnered far less enthusiasm from investors than bitcoin funds have. The ProShares Ether Strategy ETF (EETH) has pulled in $7.7 million, according to etf.com data. The combined six ETFs that started trading on Oct. 2 garnered only $1.9 million on their first day of trading.\n\nStory continues\n\nA spot product, however, is what many investors have their eye one. As the SEC continues its talks with the firms that are filing for a spot bitcoin ETF, a consensus is building among people familiar with the matter that the SEC could give preliminary approval to multiple spot bitcoin ETFs by the end of this year.\n\nBitcoin was trading at $37,224 on Friday afternoon, up 2.3% in the past 24 hours.\n\nContact Lucy Brewster at lucy.brewster@etf.com.\n\n\n\n\n\nPermalink | \u00a9 Copyright 2023 etf.com.

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nEthereum has witnessed a notable price movement, breaching the $2,000 threshold. The significant market activity coincides with Ethereum cofounder Vitalik Buterin's recent transfer of 50 ETH, valued at approximately $106,000, to Coinbase Custody. It is important to note that such a transfer does not inherently indicate an intent to sell the assets; instead, it might reflect a strategic move for security or part of a broader financial strategy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCoinbase Custody is a service offered by Coinbase, which is specifically designed to provide secure storage for cryptocurrency assets. It is targeted at institutional clients and offers a range of features, including insurance coverage and third-party auditing. The service is built on the premise of providing a secure haven for large cryptocurrency holdings, away from the risks associated with exchange wallets.\n\nSource: TradingView\n\nThe transfer of funds by notable figures such as Buterin often garners attention, potentially influencing market sentiment. However, attributing Ethereum's price surge solely to these transfers would be an oversimplification. A myriad of factors contribute to the price dynamics of cryptocurrencies, including investor sentiment, market trends and significant developments within the ecosystem.\n\nOne such development is the news that BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, is exploring the creation of an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that would include Ethereum's ether. This move underscores the growing interest and acceptance of cryptocurrencies among institutional investors. BlackRock's engagement with Ethereum could be seen as a vote of confidence, potentially attracting more institutional money into the cryptocurrency space and contributing to the bullish momentum of ETH.\n\nEthereum's growth also comes amid a broader trend of increasing institutional interest in cryptocurrencies. As traditional financial entities seek exposure to digital assets, the market is likely to continue to expand and evolve."

        "content": "Ethereum stands out as a transformative force in the blockchain world, extending beyond just cryptocurrency. It's a versatile, open-source platform that revolutionized the creation and functionality of decentralized applications (DApps) through smart contract scripting. Ethereum's framework has opened up new horizons for blockchain functionality, leading it to become a cornerstone in the crypto market.\n\nHow Does Ethereum (ETH) Work?\n\nWhile sharing some foundational principles with Bitcoin, Ethereum introduces unique features and a different approach, particularly in its consensus mechanism. Unlike Bitcoin's pure Proof of Work (PoW) system, Ethereum has transitioned towards a Proof of Stake (PoS) model with its Ethereum 2.0 update. This shift aimed to enhance network efficiency and scalability.\n\nFurthermore, Ethereum incorporates elements from peer-to-peer networks to foster a genuinely decentralized environment, ideal for developing decentralized applications (DApps).\n\nEthereum: Platform vs. Cryptocurrency\n\nA common misconception is to conflate Ethereum with a cryptocurrency. In reality, Ethereum is an extensive blockchain platform, and Ether (ETH) is its native cryptocurrency.\n\nEther plays a crucial role in the ecosystem, primarily used to remunerate validators for executing operations and securing the network, especially in the context of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) computations.\n\nEthereum Virtual Machine (EVM): The Core of Ethereum\n\nAt the core of Ethereum's functionality lies the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). EVMs are embedded in every node of the Ethereum network and are instrumental in simplifying the development of decentralized applications. They serve as a robust and secure runtime environment for executing smart contracts.\n\nEvery node within the Ethereum network operates an instance of the EVM, enabling a decentralized consensus on the execution of code. This setup ensures that all nodes in the network can independently and reliably execute the same instructions, facilitating a trustless ecosystem where code can be run without centralized control.\n\nThe EVM is a Turing-complete system, meaning it has the capability to execute a wide array of computational operations, similar to languages like JavaScript. This Turing completeness allows for the creation and execution of complex smart contracts and decentralized applications.\n\nSupport for Multiple Programming Languages\n\nOne of the standout features of the EVM is its compatibility with various programming languages. Developers can write smart contracts and DApps using popular languages such as C++, Java, JavaScript, Python, and Ruby. Ethereum also introduced its unique programming language, Solidity, specifically designed to create smart contracts. Solidity is object-oriented and high-level, tailored to the Ethereum blockchain's nuances. Regardless of the language used, the code is ultimately compiled into EVM bytecode, making it executable on the Ethereum network.\n\nEthereum's innovative approach, especially with its evolving consensus mechanism and the versatility of the EVM, distinguishes it from other blockchain platforms. It's not just a cryptocurrency but a comprehensive platform enabling a decentralized digital economy and diverse applications.\n\nConsensus Mechanism\n\nFor years, Ethereum had planned a transition from a Proof of Work (PoW) to a Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism \u2013 an update known as Ethereum 2.0. This shift brought considerable improvements in terms of energy efficiency, as PoS systems require substantially less electricity than their PoW counterparts. The transition also aimed to address scalability and energy consumption concerns associated with the traditional mining model.\n\nStaking in PoS: In PoS, network participants \u201cstake\u201d their ETH tokens in a network wallet, contributing to the network's security and transaction validation process. The likelihood of a participant being chosen to validate a block correlates with the amount of Ethereum they have staked. This method not only reduces the need for extensive computational power but also adds a layer of security; potential attackers would need to own and stake a significant amount of ETH, making any attack economically disadvantageous.\n\nSecurity and Sustainability: The PoS model is viewed by many experts as a natural evolution in the blockchain space, offering a more sustainable alternative to the traditional PoW approach. By requiring participants to have skin in the game, PoS also encourages more responsible participation in the network's maintenance.\n\nWhat is GAS?\n\nGas in the Ethereum network is a fundamental concept representing a unit for measuring the computational effort required to execute operations, such as transactions and smart contract executions. It functions as an internal pricing mechanism, crucial for maintaining the network's integrity and efficiency.\n\nGas: The Fuel for Ethereum's Engine\n\nRole of Gas: Gas serves as a metering unit for computational work on the Ethereum blockchain. It's used to allocate resources of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) so that every operation, from simple transactions to complex smart contract executions, is adequately compensated. Quality Control: By quantifying operations in terms of gas, Ethereum ensures the quality of code executed on its network. This system discourages inefficient or malicious code, as such code would require a prohibitive amount of gas, making it uneconomical to execute.\n\nSetting Gas Prices and Limits\n\nGas Limit: This refers to the maximum amount of gas a user is willing to spend on a transaction or smart contract execution. It acts as a safeguard against running into unexpected execution costs. More complex operations require a higher gas limit due to the increased computational work. Gas Price: Users specify the gas price in gwei (1 billionth of an Ether). It's the amount a user is willing to pay per unit of gas for their transaction to be processed. Miners prioritize transactions with higher gas prices, as it's more lucrative for them. Transaction Cost Calculation: The cost of an Ethereum transaction is determined by multiplying the gas used by the gas price. Although gas quantities are calculated internally, the actual transaction fees are paid in Ether.\n\nEconomic Incentives and Network Efficiency\n\nThe gas system in Ethereum creates a market-driven, self-regulating ecosystem. Users are incentivized to offer competitive gas prices to have their transactions processed promptly, while validators are incentivized to process transactions with higher gas prices for greater rewards. This mechanism ensures that resources are allocated efficiently within the network.\n\nBalancing Network Load\n\nBy requiring gas for transactions and smart contract executions, Ethereum balances the network load. Transactions consuming excessive computational resources are naturally limited by higher gas costs, preventing network congestion and abuse. This balance is crucial for maintaining Ethereum's performance and scalability.\n\nOverall, Gas in Ethereum is a critical component that ensures the smooth operation of the Ethereum network. It provides a flexible and efficient way to measure and compensate for computational efforts, aligns the interests of users and validators, and maintains the quality and security of the network. As Ethereum continues to evolve, the role of gas will remain pivotal in its ecosystem.\n\nHistory of the Network\n\nEthereum began its journey in the early days of the crypto market. In 2013, programmer and Bitcoin enthusiast Vitalik Buterin introduced Ethereum through a whitepaper. This document detailed a novel concept: a decentralized, global computer operating on blockchain technology akin to Bitcoin. Buterin's idea was revolutionary at the time, proposing a platform that could run programmable smart contracts and applications beyond mere financial transactions.\n\nThe Inception and Evolution of Ethereum\n\nEarly Development: Buterin, with assistance from the Swiss development firm GmbH, completed Ethereum's initial version by 2014. This development phase culminated in a highly successful Initial Coin Offering (ICO), raising $18 million and establishing a robust network of Ethereum miners and investors.\n\nButerin, with assistance from the Swiss development firm GmbH, completed Ethereum's initial version by 2014.

Homestead \u2013 The First Major Upgrade: In 2016, Ethereum underwent its first major upgrade, dubbed \u201cHomestead.\u201d This period also saw the emergence of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), innovative entities leveraging Ethereum's technology to automate decision-making and operations entirely via smart contracts.\n\nThe DAO: Ambition and Challenge\n\nLaunch and Record-Breaking Crowdfunding: Ethereum's first DAO was launched on April 30, 2016, quickly becoming a landmark in blockchain crowdfunding by raising over $150 million, a record at the time, with participation from over 11,000 investors globally.\n\nEthereum's first DAO was launched on April 30, 2016, quickly becoming a landmark in blockchain crowdfunding by raising over $150 million, a record at the time, with participation from over 11,000 investors globally. The DAO Hack: The initial success was short-lived as a critical vulnerability was exploited by hackers in June 2016, leading to the theft of 3.6 million ETH. This event caused a significant drop in Ethereum's value and exposed the risks associated with smart contract-based systems.\n\nEthereum's Fork: A Controversial Decision\n\nDealing with the Hack: Ethereum's community and developers debated solutions to reclaim the stolen funds in response to the DAO hack. A key proposal was to implement a \u2018soft fork' that would blacklist the hacker's address. However, this idea was soon overshadowed by a more radical approach \u2013 a \u2018hard fork'.\n\nEthereum's community and developers debated solutions to reclaim the stolen funds in response to the DAO hack.

Soft Fork vs. Hard Fork: In the crypto world, a soft fork is a backward-compatible upgrade, whereas a hard fork is a non-compatible upgrade that can result in a split blockchain. Ethereum's team proposed a hard fork to revert transactions to a state before the hack, an unprecedented move in blockchain history.\n\nIn the crypto world, a soft fork is a backward-compatible upgrade, whereas a hard fork is a non-compatible upgrade that can result in a split blockchain. Ethereum's team proposed a hard fork to revert transactions to a state before the hack, an unprecedented move in blockchain history. Community Split and Ethereum Classic: The hard fork proposal was contentious, challenging the blockchain principle of immutability. Despite opposition, the hard fork was executed on July 20, 2016, effectively splitting Ethereum into two blockchains: the original (now Ethereum Classic) and the new version (Ethereum).\n\nThe Aftermath and Ethereum's Resilience\n\nMarket Recovery: Despite the controversy and challenges post-fork, Ethereum managed to recover and strengthen its market position. By 2017, the value of Ether surged, reaching an all-time high in January 2018.\n\nDespite the controversy and challenges post-fork, Ethereum managed to recover and strengthen its market position. By 2017, the value of Ether surged, reaching an all-time high in January 2018. ERC Protocols and Token Standards: Ethereum's introduction of ERC protocols, particularly ERC-20, was a game-changer, simplifying the process of creating new tokens and smart contracts on its platform. This development led to a surge in Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) in 2017, substantially contributing to the cryptocurrency sector's growth.\n\nToday's Ethereum Landscape\n\nAs it stands, Ethereum is a dominant force in the crypto market, known for its innovative approach to decentralized applications and smart contracts. The platform's adaptability, demonstrated through its evolving technology and response to challenges like the DAO hack, continues to keep it at the forefront of the blockchain space. Ethereum's influence is evident in the widespread use of its ERC token standards, underpinning a vast array of digital assets and decentralized applications.\n\nHow to Buy Ethereum (ETH)\n\nCurrently, Ethereum (ETH) is available for purchase on the following exchanges:\n\nUphold \u2013 This is one of the top exchanges for United States & UK residents that offers a wide range of cryptocurrencies. Uphold also offers Ethereum staking. Germany & Netherlands are prohibited.\n\nPaybis \u2013 This truly global company offers services to residents from 180+ countries, including Canada, Europe, UK, & USA.\n\nKraken \u2013 Founded in 2011, Kraken is one of the most trusted names in the industry, with over 9,000,000 users and over $207 billion in quarterly trading volume.

In September 2023, Ethereum\u2019s on-chain volume was around 1.5 billion, which has increased to 2.62 billion as of Nov. 10.\n\nETH on chain volume | Source: The Block\n\nThis metric is crucial as it indicates the level of activity and usage of the Ethereum network. A higher on-chain volume often suggests increased adoption and utilization of the network for transactions.\n\nGenerally, a higher on-chain volume can signify heightened investor and user interest in Ethereum, which can positively influence its price. As more transactions occur, it implies a robust demand for ETH, potentially leading to a rise in its value.\n\nETH deposited to the Beacon Chain\n\nThis refers to the amount of ETH staked in the Ethereum 2.0 Beacon Chain and the number of validators participating in the network. The staked ETH in the Beacon Chain increased from 786,000 in August 2023 to 885,000 as of Nov. 10.\n\nDeposited ETH on the Beacon Chain | Source: The Block\n\nDepositing ETH into the Beacon Chain for staking is vital for the security and operation of the Ethereum 2.0 network. More staked ETH and validators mean a more secure and decentralized network.\n\nAn increase in staked ETH and validators can boost confidence in Ethereum\u2019s long-term stability and demonstrate a commitment from stakeholders to the network\u2019s success, which can be a bullish signal for investors.\n\nEthereum (ETH) price prediction\n\nWhile exploring Ethereum price predictions, it\u2019s crucial to acknowledge the inherent uncertainties in such forecasts. These predictions are speculative and subject to market volatility.\n\nAn ETH price prediction for Nov. 25 projects a value of $2,199.93, showing a 5.17% increase. For December 2024, the ETH prediction is around $3,555.88.\n\nAn ambitious ETH price analysis suggests Ethereum might reach $4,487.64 in 2023 and potentially $6,809.84 by 2025.\n\nRemember, cryptocurrency investments are risky, and market predictions can be inaccurate.

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEthereum (ETH) presents an intriguing case as it flirts with the psychologically significant $2,000 mark. Recently, ETH has demonstrated commendable strength, breaking through its local resistance level, which now appears to be acting as a solid support zone. This event marks a potential paradigm shift for the second-biggest asset by market capitalization in the crypto arena.\n\nThe recent price action of Ethereum tells a story of resilience and potential. After a period of consolidation, ETH has managed to surge past a resistance level that had previously capped its upward movements. This breakthrough is significant; it indicates a shift in market sentiment and establishes a new foundation upon which Ethereum may build its next climb.\n\nHistorical price patterns suggest that once a resistance level is transcended, it often transforms into a support level. For ETH, this could mean that the price level it has just surpassed may well become a launchpad for further gains.\n\nLooking at the volume profiles, the recent move upward has been accompanied by a noticeable increase in trading volume, lending credence to the breakout's sustainability. High volume is a strong indicator of genuine market movement, implying that the current price level is backed by substantial interest and participation from market participants.\n\nAs Ethereum inches toward the $2,000 level, the crypto community is abuzz with speculation about the potential for a further price movement upward. If the newfound support level holds, ETH may well have paved the groundwork for a sustained upward trajectory.\n\nShiba Inu under pressure\n\nShiba Inu (SHIB) faces a critical juncture as it hovers around the formidable 200-day Exponential Moving Average.\n\nMoving Average (EMA), a significant level that often demarcates the bullish from the bearish territories. The EMA is a trend-following indicator, smoothing out price data over a period of time and placing significant weight on recent prices. For SHIB, the challenge to break and hold above this level is substantial due to its past performance and current market dynamics.\n\nAs of the latest charts, SHIB's price hovers just below the 200 EMA, indicating a troublesome state for the token. The 200 EMA acts as a resistance level, a threshold where selling pressure is likely to be encountered. Traders and investors are watching closely to see if SHIB can muster the buying strength to break through this resistance.\n\nThe volume profile presents a mixed signal; although there has been an uptick in volume, it is not decisively high enough to confirm a robust breakout pattern. This suggests a lack of conviction among buyers, making the possibility of breaking above the 200 EMA less certain.\n\nA sustained break above the 200 EMA could open the door to a potential bullish scenario, where confidence might build and invite further buying pressure. However, without strong volume support, any attempt to rise above this level could be short-lived, potentially leading to a false breakout and subsequent sell-off.\n\nThree scenarios for Cardano\n\nCardano (ADA) has been a standout on the market thanks to outstanding price performance. Its recent price movements have caught the eye of investors and traders alike, looking to decipher the future course of ADA's valuation. Based on the provided daily chart of ADA against USD, we explore three possible scenarios for Cardano's imminent price trajectory.\n\nScenario 1: Bullish continuation\n\nThe current chart shows ADA has been on an upward trend, breaking past previous resistance levels. With the moving averages (MAs) aligning below the price and the trend appearing to move upward, there is a solid argument for continued bullish momentum.\n\nScenario 2: Consolidation before next move\n\nAfter a sharp move upward, assets often enter a period of consolidation, where the price stabilizes before the next significant move. For ADA, this could mean moving sideways as the market decides its next direction.\n\nScenario 3: Bearish reversal\n\nDespite the current bullish appearance, the possibility of a bearish reversal cannot be ignored. If ADA fails to maintain its current support level, it may signal a sell-off. A break below the recent bullish candlesticks and moving averages could indicate a trend reversal."

Following BlackRock's registration of the iShares Ethereum Trust, the price of Ethereum soared above the $2,000 level, marking its highest level since April.\n\nThis development echoes a similar pattern observed earlier in the year when BlackRock registered a Bitcoin trust, followed by a proposal for a spot Bitcoin ETF."

Recently, Ethereum, the blockchain at the heart of the DeFi and NFT revolutions, has seen its fees surge to levels that many users find exorbitant. This uptick in gas fees has several implications for the network and its users.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the network becomes congested with transactions, users must pay higher fees to have their transactions prioritized by miners. Currently, the Ethereum network is experiencing such high congestion that the average gas fee has reached 226 gwei, with high fees touching 227 gwei.\n\nThis surge in fees has a direct impact on the cost of network operations. Simple token swaps can cost upwards of $160, while more complex contract interactions, such as those involved in NFT sales, can exceed $270. These costs become prohibitive for smaller transactions, effectively pricing out a significant portion of the user base.\n\nFor developers and projects, these high fees can stifle innovation and slow down the development of new applications, as testing and deployment become more expensive.\n\nThe effects of high fees ripple out to the broader market, impacting the price of Ethereum itself. While high fees can indicate a healthy demand for block space, they can also lead to a decrease in network activity as users and developers seek more cost-effective alternatives. This can create a negative feedback loop, where reduced activity leads to lower network value and could potentially impact the price of ETH negatively.\n\nFurthermore, these fees can slow down the overall growth of the network. The high cost of transactions on Ethereum makes it less competitive compared to other blockchains that offer lower fees. Users and developers might migrate to these alternative platforms, which can offer similar functionalities at a fraction of the cost."

Taking to X on November 8, Adams said MATIC should be a top-10 crypto asset, adding that people are asleep on layer-2s.\n\nPolygon (MATIC) Remains In An Uptrend\n\nWhen writing on November 8, MATIC is among the top 15 most valuable coins by market cap. It also remains volatile, fluctuating, and moving up and down the market cap leaderboard rankings. Even so, considering its spot valuation exceeding $7.3 billion according to CoinMarketCap (CMC), a crypto tracker, MATIC remains relatively liquid with a broad user base.\n\nEtherscan data on November 8 shows that there are 629,967 MATIC holders, down roughly 2%, but the number remains higher despite the contraction following the crypto winter of 2022, which spilled over to 2023.\n\nAs of November 8, MATIC is up 60% from September 2023 lows. According to CMC, the coin is also up 13% on the last trading day, pushing weekly gains to over 27%. Looking at the candlestick arrangement in the daily chart, the uptrend momentum is strong, and buyers appear to be doubling down.\n\nPresently, bull bars are aligned along the upper BB, suggesting that there is intense buying pressure. At the same time, MATIC is within a bullish breakout formation, breezing past August highs.\n\nPolygon, a sidechain, is among the many scaling solutions for Ethereum. The platform is compatible with Ethereum, allowing protocols to build on Polygon while enjoying the high activity and security of the first smart contract network. Polygon is also considered a layer-2, though it isn\u2019t technically a layer-2 since it doesn\u2019t depend on roll-ups like Arbitrum or OP Mainnet.\n\nTime To Double Down On MATIC And Layer-2 Tokens\n\nIn Adams\u2019 view, considering layer-2 tokens, including MATIC or ARB, at spot levels could translate to more gains in the next bull run. Nonetheless, it should be noted that MATIC, for instance, is down 72% from 2021 highs.\n\nMoreover, the coin is trending inside June\u2019s bear trade range. A comprehensive close above this level may signal the end of the bear run, possibly anchoring buyers targeting $1.5.\n\nIn late October, Polygon Labs officially launched the POL, a token that will prime Polygon 2.0, Ethereum, signaling the first steps to see MATIC gradually phased out. POL will serve more roles in Polygon 2.0, specifically powering an ecosystem of zero knowledge-based layer-2 chains using Polygon\u2019s infrastructure. News of this smart contract launch seemed to have catalyzed demand, driving token prices higher.\n\nFeature image from Canva, chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nThe cocreator of the BitMex crypto exchange and CIO of the Maelstrom family office, Arthur Hayes, has told the community about his recent trip to Rapa Nui (better known as Easter Island).\n\n\"Bitcoin to $1 million, Ethereum \u2013 to $100,000\"\n\nThis seems like a partly joking X post since Hayes said that \"the ancestors in Rapa Nui\" tipped him off about when the bull market would finally arrive. Hayes is not known to have any roots there.\n\nThe time is now, they allegedly told him, as the bull market started. Who knows whether Hayes (former CEO of BitMex) indeed believes that Bitcoin and Ethereum can reach these price levels or was just trolling his followers, but he wrote that Bitcoin will reach $1 million and Ethereum will surge to hit $100,000.\n\nHayes frequently shares his expectations of Bitcoin soaring to $1 million in the future.\n\nThis summer I visited the ancestors in Rapa Nui and I asked them when the bull market would arrive?\n\n\n\nThey told me to be patient, read the words of the Lord, and I would know when to YOLO.\n\n\n\nThe time is now!$BTC = $1mm$ETH = $100k\n\n\n\nYachtzee bitches!!! pic.twitter.com/ufV9nthSDg \u2014 Arthur Hayes (@CryptoHayes) November 10, 2023\n\nEarlier today, Hayes shared an ETH/USD chart from BitMex as the second largest cryptocurrency Ethereum briefly soared above the 2,100 level, thus attracting attention to ETH's rise.\n\nBitcoin surpassing $37,000 briefly, almost hits $38,000\n\nOn Thursday, Nov. 9, the world's leading digital currency Bitcoin briefly surged above the $37,000 level, almost hitting $38,000. That price jump took place for the first time over the past 18 months.\n\nThe staggering growth of 5.69% in less than a day (and the addition of $2,000 to the price) was attributed to Bloomberg analysts expecting the U.S. regulator, the SEC, to face a \"brief window\" for giving the green light to 12 Bitcoin spot ETFs, including those of BlackRock and Grayscale for 12 days, starting on Thursday.\n\nAnother analyst of Bloomberg, James Seyffart, shared that he expected the regulator to approve the first BTC ETF by early January and said that there was a 90% probability of that.\n\nEthereum followed Bitcoin's growth soaring to the $2,133 level. By now, both leading cryptos have lost momentum. Bitcoin is trading at $36,943, and Ethereum is exchanging hands at $2,071."

        "title": "Here's Why Bitcoin and Ethereum Are Back From the Dead - New York Magazine",
        "content": "Is bitcoin back? Photo-Illustration: Intelligencer\n\nFor the entirety of crypto\u2019s existence, a large part of digital currency\u2019s appeal was how strange it all was. From its 2008 inception, bitcoin was this new kind of anti-government money, perfect for someone to buy drugs with online anonymously, even as it was susceptible to getting lost or thrown out on garbage day. There were the copycat fads \u2014 the \u201cinitial coin offering\u201d bubble of 2017, the shitcoin mania of 2021 \u2014 as well as the truly weird and dumb stuff, like the NFTs of monkeys that were, briefly, fodder for the art world. Whatever your opinion of all these things, they made many people very, very rich \u2014 at least for a little while, on paper. This year, though, has been different. After last year\u2019s market collapse and last week\u2019s conviction of crypto-fraud kingpin Sam Bankman-Fried, what\u2019s weird about it all isn\u2019t some new trend or some new offense to good taste. On Thursday, crypto had one of its best days in 18 months, and it has everything to do with abandoning its rebel origins and getting approval from Wall Street giants and government regulators.\n\nA single bitcoin rose briefly to nearly $38,000 on Thursday, the highest that it\u2019s been since the early days of the total market collapse triggered by the vaporization of two of the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrencies, terraUSD and luna, in early 2022. Why did it rise from the dead all of a sudden? Crypto investors have a big new story to tell \u2014 and since the price of bitcoin isn\u2019t tied to a physical asset, like oil, or the economic might of a country, like the U.S. dollar, it lives and dies by how persuasive its story is on any given day. This time, the narrative seems to be about crypto growing up and getting a haircut, a suit, and a real job \u2014 on Wall Street. Specifically, the Securities and Exchange Commission appeared to be getting closer to green-lighting an exchange-traded fund from investment behemoth BlackRock that would allow investors to buy bitcoin as easily as they buy the S&P 500. (An ETF trades just like a stock but can represent an index or commodity or a nearly endless variety of other financial bets.) And it wasn\u2019t just bitcoin. Ethereum, the world\u2019s second-most-popular crypto, was also reaching highs not seen since April, topping $2,000 per token, after BlackRock registered a corporate entity in Delaware for an ethereum ETF.\n\nBitcoin is at $37,000 and no one is talking about it. Nobody is saying anything!\n\n\n\nHas anyone checked the price?\n\n\n\nWhy is no one tweeting about crypto?\n\n\n\nHello?\n\n\n\nBitcoin is up a lot!\n\n\n\nDoesn\u2019t anyone see it? \u2014 Zack Voell (@zackvoell) November 9, 2023\n\nFor Wall Street to finally start trading ETFs of bitcoin or ethereum would truly begin a new era in the world of cryptocurrencies. ETFs are part of the finance industry\u2019s lifeblood, and an industry unto itself that, as of last year, was worth $6.5 trillion. At its core, a crypto ETF would make it easier for financial institutions (your pensions, mutual funds, hedge funds, and the like), and the average 401(k) holder, to easily trade and profit from the digital currencies without having to worry about encryption keys, or getting hacked, or anything like that. (At least, not directly. If BlackRock got its bitcoin hacked, though, that would be very bad.) Bitcoin ETFs have largely been a pipe dream for the last ten years, since the Winklevoss twins first tried to get government approval for one. (The SEC rejected it four years later.) What changed recently was a lawsuit from Grayscale, a company owned by Barry Silbert\u2019s Digital Currency Group, a big (if currently troubled) player in the crypto space. In August, an appeals court ruled that the SEC had arbitrarily denied Grayscale\u2019s application for its own ETF, which would have used many of the same market-surveillance and safety protocols that other funds used. Last month, the SEC said it wouldn\u2019t appeal the decision, making the appearance of an ETF all but assured. \u201cThis was fully expected in my eyes and was just a matter of when, not if,\u201d Bloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffart said. \u201cBut BlackRock\u2019s name is obviously huge and just seeing this registration in Delaware sent ether prices skyrocketing.\u201d\n\nAll this appears to fly in the face of what made crypto so \u2026 crypto-y. This was, after all, the money that was most closely associated with Occupy Wall Street and that Jamie Dimon has called a \u201cfraud.\u201d The spike in prices is of the kind that would typically come from secret, anonymous Telegram \u201cpump\u201d groups that would disappear just as soon as they made their profits. That its value is getting pumped because regulators are now okay with it and the likes of BlackRock, which manages over $10 trillion in assets, are getting in on it, is deeply weird and hilarious \u2014 not only because it\u2019s the opposite of what it symbolized for so long, but because \u2026 what\u2019s the difference? For most people who own a bitcoin, what matters is that the price is going to go higher (a.k.a. \u201cnumber go up\u201d), not any of the high-flying rhetoric about its ability make each holder a sovereign wealth fund unto themselves. Maybe this is why Gary Gensler, the SEC chair and chief antagonist of the crypto markets, came out recently and suggested that FTX could soon get relaunched as a crypto exchange, now that Bankman-Fried is no longer a threat. After his remarks, the price of FTX\u2019s digital currency, long assumed to be dead by most investors, spiked by 90 percent \u2014 one of its best days ever."

        "content": "Bitcoin (CRYTO: BTC) was popping up almost 2% higher, reclaiming $37,000 during Friday\u2019s 24-hour trading session. The crypto continued its climb north as hopes grow the U.S. Security and Exchange Commission will approve a spot Bitcoin ETF and more analysts become bullish on the likelihood the approval comes soon.\n\nEthereum (CRYPTO: ETH) heavily outpaced Bitcoin on Thursday, surging about 13% compared to Bitcoin\u2019s 3.24% move north. On Friday, Bitcoin and Ethereum were trading in slightly opposite directions, with both cryptos consolidating.\n\nMust Read: Welcome To 'The Acceleration Phase': Analyst Predicts An 88% Increase For Bitcoin\n\nWhile Bitcoin and Ethereum spiked significantly higher recently, Dogecoin (CRYPTO: DOGE) continued to consolidate mostly sideways above the 200-day simple moving average (SMA), which was healthy. If Bitcoin and Ethereum continued to trek higher following a period of consolidation, Dogecoin was likely to break bullishly from its horizontal pattern.\n\nWant direct analysis? Find me in the BZ Pro lounge! Click here for a free trial.\n\nThe Bitcoin and Ethereum Charts: Bitcoin and Ethereum were trading slightly higher and lower, respectively on Friday, with each forming an inside bar pattern on declining volume. The formation leaned bullish in both Bitcoin\u2019s and Ethereum\u2019s case because the inside bars were forming at the top of the mother bars and both cryptos are in uptrends.\n\nThe sideways consolidation was helping Bitcoin and Ethereum\u2019s eight-day exponential moving averages (EMAs) to catch up to the cryptos\u2019 prices. If the two apex cryptos continue to trade sideways over the weekend, it would also help to lower their relative strength index (RSI), as both Bitcoin and Ethereum were in overbought territory.\n\nWhile a golden cross formed on Bitcoin\u2019s chart on Oct. 29, the 50-day SMA was trending below the 200-day SMA on Ethereum\u2019s chart. If Ethereum continued to trend above the 200-day, the 50-day would eventually cross above the 200-day, which would cause a golden cross to form and give bullish traders more confidence going forward.\n\nBitcoin has resistance above at $38,105 and at $39,600 and support below at $35,593 and at $31,862.\n\nEthereum has resistance above at $2,150 and at $2,317 and support below at $2,020 and at $1,937.\n\nThe Dogecoin Chart: Unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum, which surged Thursday, Dogecoin was highly volatile, losing 8% and climbing over 3% at one point before settling to close the session slightly lower.\n\nDogecoin has been trading mostly sideways between about 7 cents and $0.075 since Sunday, which helped drop the crypto\u2019s RSI down to the 64% mark.\n\nDogecoin\u2019s horizontal consolidation has taken place above the 200-day SMA, which was a likely scenario after a stock or crypto regained that level. Like Ethereum, if Dogecoin continued to trade above the 200-day, the 50-day would cross above the 200-day SMA, which would cause a golden cross to form.\n\nBullish traders want to see Dogecoin continue to trade sideways and then for big bullish volume to come in and break the crypto up above Thursday\u2019s high-of-day. Bearish traders want to see big bearish volume drop Dogecoin back under the 200-day SMA.\n\nDogecoin has resistance above at $0.075 and at $0.083 and support below at $0.069 and at $0.065.\n\nRead Next: EXCLUSIVE: Bitcoin Rally Ahead?

In June, the company filed an application for a spot bitcoin ETF with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), buoying investor hopes that the presence of the world\u2019s largest asset manager alongside 11 other applicants would sway the agency to reverse its pattern of rejections.\n\nIn late October, a report indicated that top market makers Jane Street and Jump Trading have offered to provide liquidity to BlackRock\u2019s bitcoin ETF once approved.\n\nThe largest cryptocurrency in market value was recently changing hands at $36,542, a 2% gain from Wednesday, same time.

This trend, if it repeats itself, might fuel some pullbacks, but ITB expects this will not impact Ethereum\u2019s longer-term prospects.\n\nAnother interesting perspective on Ethereum\u2019s prospects emerged from top market analyst Ali Martinez. Drawing on the coin\u2019s latest run above the psychologically important level at $2,000, Martinez highlighted how intriguing this milestone is, seeing whales have not started accumulating the coin.\n\n#Ethereum has reclaimed the $2,000 threshold, and intriguingly, this is all happening before whales have even started buying $ETH! pic.twitter.com/wrgESGXoU6 \u2014 Ali (@ali_charts) November 10, 2023\n\nThe Ethereum ETF Intrigue\n\nThough Ethereum\u2019s YTD growth of 73% trails behind that of Bitcoin (BTC) at 123%, it remains a high performer. While retail holders can take accolades for the current rally, the prospect of a potential Ethereum spot ETF complements the growing optimism.\n\nIn a not-so-shocking twist, prominent asset manager BlackRock applied to list its iShares Ethereum Trust, a move welcomed with many expectations. The possibility the market might get this product through BlackRock and other applicants like Grayscale underscores the push to create a regulated pathway for corporate or institutional investors to gain exposure to Ethereum.\n\nIf achieved, the long-term prospects of Ethereum look bright, as inferred by IntoTheBlock and other market experts. Ethereum is trading for $2,087, up 2.86% over the past 24 hours and a whopping 33% over the past seven days."

The rise comes right when crypto Twitter is abuzz over a possible spot Ethereum ETF application from Blackrock \u2013 the investment management giant. The notion stems from the firm\u2019s move to register its iShares Ethereum Trust in Delaware.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nBlackrock moves ETH\u2019s market\n\nAccording to a Twitter user, Summers, who first noticed the filing, \u201cBlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust was registered in a similar manner 7 days before they filed the ETF application with the SEC. Details below.\u201d The investment management giant reignited the crypto market\u2019s dream of seeing an approved spot Bitcoin ETH by filing for an application back in June 2023. And since then, many other key financial players have joined the race with subsequent filings.\n\nBlackRock has made first step towards filing for a spot Ether ETF. I just confirmed on the website myself. Nice catch by @SummersThings https://t.co/mLKIhKdiI6 \u2014 Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) November 9, 2023\n\nAmidst this news, the second-largest crypto by market cap has breached a key price level. According to CoinMarketCap, at press time, ETH was trading at $2,040 with a market cap of $245.09 billion. The coin registered a growth of over 4 percent in the past hour and over 8 percent in the past day. Meanwhile, the 7-day chart indicated a price gain of over 12 percent, while the past 24-hour trade volume stood at $15.82 billion.\n\nMoreover, Blackrock\u2019s influence is not limited to only the ETH market. The company\u2019s spot Bitcoin ETF filing has even had the price of Bitcoin rallying in as the optimism for its approval grows. The king coin reached its highest level for this year as it breached the $37,000 level. BTC reached a high of $37,999 on Coinbase today.\n\nNotably, according to Bloomberg analysts, the SEC currently has a short window open if it wants to approve all spot Bitcoin ETF applications, starting today. This would be applications from Blackrock, Grayscale, 21Shares and Ark, Invesco & Galaxy, VanEck, Bitwise, Valkyrie, and Fidelity. If the SEC does not make a move in this time frame, it will have to decide its position by January 2024."

The gaming-centric Ethereum scaling network has made numerous recent announcements, none bigger than a partnership with Assassin\u2019s Creed maker Ubisoft on Thursday.\n\nAnother big winner this week is RON, the token of the Ronin network, an Ethereum sidechain. Ronin\u2019s token popped 53% this week to a current price of $0.78, and is up 88% over the past month. The network, best known for hosting Axie Infinity, has seen surging active users thanks to the recent buzzy launch of Pixels, another play-to-earn title.\n\nGALA, the token of the Gala Games ecosystem, pumped 33% this week and 87% over the past month. Meanwhile, Axie Infinity\u2019s AXS token is up 12% this week and nearly 46% this past month, while The Sandbox\u2019s SAND token marked a 12% weekly jump and 45% rise over the last 30 days.\n\nSuch gains are outpacing the crypto market\u2019s most valuable coins. Bitcoin, for example, is up nearly 8% this week and 39% over 30 days, while Ethereum surged 16% this week and is up almost 35% during the past month."

        "content": "Ethereum insider, Steven Nerayoff has vowed to expose alleged fraud schemes which he claims are operating within the Ethereum network. As a result, the crypto community is keeping a close watch and Neyaroff has promised to reveal proof of his accusations in the coming weeks.\n\nUnmasking The \u201cTruth\u201d\n\nFormer Ethereum Advisor, Steven Nerayoff has announced his intentions to unveil evidence regarding the recent allegations he made against Ethereum Founders, Vitalik Buterin and Joseph Lubin in a few weeks.\n\nNerayoff stated that his legal team is working towards ensuring all information regarding the fraud claims is published properly. He said that he had developed a platform that would allow him to release all evidence without being censored.\n\n\u201cWe are making a lot of progress. Information should start flowing within weeks not months. My intent is to make everything I can public. Each can decide for themself. I created another platform that can\u2019t be censored so I\u2019ll publish here and there,\u201d Nerayoff stated.\n\nNerayoff first hinted at possible fraudulent activities at Ethereum in an X (formerly Twitter) post following news of FTX founder, Sam Bankman-Fried being convicted of fraud and conspiracy.\n\nHe alleged that the founders of the blockchain network have been directly involved with corrupt United States government officials and has vowed to expose the individuals involved, providing proof of his accusations to the public through legal and social channels.\n\n\u201cI believe these corrupt government officials will be unmasked and what we all know the public will learn,\u201d Nerayoff stated.\n\nWhile many individuals in the crypto community are looking forward to the evidence Nerayoff has announced will be disclosed in a few weeks, many community members remain skeptical, wondering if the former Ethereum Advisor has been acting out of spite or looking to gain online popularity through his claims.\n\nOne crypto user had asked if Nerayoff\u2019s case existed and why he had not filed it yet. Nerayoff\u2019s Attorney, Michael Scotto responded \u201cYes, Steven Nerayoff has a case. IT EXISTS. We will be releasing all his filings in the near future. Although I won\u2019t go into details I will say everything he has said is true and he has the receipts to prove it.\u201d\n\nNerayoff has also called out people who have relayed their doubts about his claims, stating that his court filings are under the control of his legal team and would not be published on X for legal reasons.\n\n\u201cFor those saying you haven\u2019t seen anything from me yet you\u2019re either trolling or blind. Plus you didn\u2019t read my court filings. Next court filings are in the hands of my legal team, not X,\u201d Nerayoff stated.\n\nEthereum Insider Fearless Stand\n\nIn a rather lengthy X post, Nerayoff outlined all his reasons for stating his fraud accusations against Ethereum Founders, Vitalik Buterin and Joseph Lubin. The former Ethereum Advisor stated that he was not making the fraud claims for his own benefit, rather his speaking out had a counterproductive result by making him a target and potentially endangering him.\n\n\u201cNone of this disclosure in any way benefits me!! It only makes me a target & hated by a lot of people (until they realize I was trying to save them). But I don\u2019t even care about being a target, I\u2019m numb & determined nothing will stop me,\u201d Nerayoff stated.\n\nNerayoff has disclosed that he would continue his pursuit to expose Ethereum and its founders, and he would not be deterred until he accomplishes his goal and justice is achieved.\n\nETH price breaks above $2,000 | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nFeatured image from Blokt, chart from Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nAs Ethereum (ETH) edges closer to the psychological price of $2000, the second-largest cryptocurrency based on market cap continues to enjoy notable momentum.\n\nWith ETH supply on exchanges recently hitting an all-time low, a holding culture continues to play out on the Ethereum network, and this is one of the factors triggering the bullish trend.\n\nLeading market insight provider Santiment took to X, formerly Twitter, to highlight that if significant ETH network growth continued to be experienced, this could propel the cryptocurrency to breach past the $2,000 mark.\n\nSource: Santiment\n\nSantiment acknowledged that the creation of new addresses had played an instrumental role in enabling Ethereum to cross the $1,800 level.\n\nEthereum was up by 4.2% in the past week to hit $1980 at press time, according to CoinGecko.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLow supply on crypto exchanges signals a holding culture because coins are kept in cold storage or digital wallets for future purposes other than speculation, and this is bullish because of low selling pressure.\n\nIs Ethereum Eyeing Breaking Out of a Right-Angled Expanding Triangle?\n\nAs Ethereum continues making waves based on its significant authority in several crypto sectors, such as decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFT), various analysts have delved deeper into the coin\u2019s next price action.\n\nVeteran analyst Peter Brandt recently pointed out that ETH had completed forming a right-angled expanding triangle.\n\nSource: Peter Brandt\n\nThis pattern is formed based on the expansion of a lower trendline and an upper one, and it can signal the continuation or reversal of the previous trend.\n\nTherefore, if Ethereum breaks this pattern, Brandt suggested the price could soar to the $1,993 zone.\n\nOn the other hand, top analyst Ali took to X to highlight that Ethereum was poised to rise to $1,900 thanks to the formation of an ascending triangle by higher lows, and this pattern has been playing out since June last year.\n\nSource: Ali\n\nWith Ethereum being a stone\u2019s throw away from $2,000, time will tell whether the second-largest crypto will breach this zone.\n\nMeanwhile, significant resistance sits at $1,960, given that approximately 33 million ETH was bought at this level, as previously reported by ZyCrypto."

For context, BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust was registered in a similar manner 7 days before they filed the ETF application with the SEC. Details below. [announcement: I\u2019m moving to @SynopticCom soon] pic.twitter.com/IYafIaxMzA \u2014 Summers (@SummersThings) November 9, 2023\n\nAnalysts are thus anticipating that BlackRock is likewise on the verge of filing a new spot Ether ETF application and that this could kickstart a wave of applications from other major asset managers.\n\nETH was last changing hands around $2,040, its highest level since April.\n\nBitcoin, meanwhile, hit its highest levels of the year earlier on Thursday near $38,000, with the asset having seen a stunning 50% pump since mid-October, mostly as a result of optimism that the US SEC will soon approve spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nWith Ether up a more modest 33% from its mid-October lows, and still below its earlier yearly highs, there may be scope for a bit of \u201ccatch-up\u201d to Bitcoin.\n\nFew would be surprised to see the Ether price vault to the north of earlier yearly highs just under $2,150."

        "content": "Now, the world's largest asset manager seems to be diving deeper into the crypto space. A new filing reveals that Blackrock wants to create an E AN ETF that holds Ether joining us now to discuss this Coin desk, global policy and regulation managing editor Nick Day, who's also the editor of Coin desk's state of crypto newsletter. Good morning to you, Nick. Good morning. Happy Friday. Happy Friday. All right, we're talking about this Black Rock News. So earlier Thursday, Blackrock registered is shares Ethereum Trust in the State of Delaware. Uh Back up for us, explain why this is significant and why we're seeing this market reaction. Yeah. So, you know, um first off Blackrock, obviously, uh we've been saying this for months but speculation is that it's applying for a Bitcoin ETF because it feels that the, you know, current situation around Bitcoin, the, you know, the market, everything is right for an approval for such product. Uh You know, I think we're seeing a similar assessment around this E three TF application that we saw yesterday where Blackrock is not necessarily gonna file for one of these. If it thinks it's a pools errand, it's gonna file if it's confident that, you know, the market is in a place where such product will be approved uh coming on top of the fact that, you know, it's been a, uh there's been a lot of, you know, I think, heightened uh excitement over the possibilities of Bitcoin ETF being approved and it really does seem like, you know, Blackrock if anything uh is um you know, just really kind of adding to this excitement. So, yeah, I imagine markets uh reacting at least in part to just this idea. Ok. Well, you know, the world's biggest asset manager, which is a company that has, you know, serious ties to regulators because it has to do so much business with regulators, uh you know, whatever feedback you're getting seems to suggest that, ok, this is something that is worth pursuing. I I it might be worth pursuing but are, are, are they just taking a again? I mean, this is kind of like a gamble if you will, right? Because of course, we don't know for certain that it will be approved. Um And first of all that, the ones that are up, the nine or so that are up for uh approval are Bitcoin. So even even if those get approved and uh Ether Spot ETF might take some time. Correct? Yeah, yeah, this is uh you know what we saw yesterday was, I think 19 4, which is just the first form. It hasn't even been sent to the SEC itself yet. So, uh this is just Blackrock kind of announcing its intention to send this filing to the SEC. So any process is gonna take a while, certainly, we're not gonna see this in the next few months. But, you know, at the same time, if you look at the filing itself, Blackrock seems to have designed it in such a way to just try and, you know, get a lot of arguments for it and out front, you know, immediately. So it addresses surveillance sharing agreements that has as an agreement with coin base. Uh There's a part of it that seems to kind of harken back to the SEC uh you know, legal fight against Grayscale where uh Grayscale appealed the rejection of its own. ETF and the appeals court said, uh it agreed with Grays skill's position that the SEC acted, you know, arbitrarily and graciously in denying that. So there is an entire part of the new ETF application for Ether that says like, ok, well, these Ether futures ETS are out there and just the exact same market operating under the exact same, you know, whatever. And so if an Ether futures ETF is allowed a spot, Ether ETF should also be allowed. So, you know, clearly they're paying attention to what's going on in this uh you know, broader, you know, ETF battle. And they're saying, ok, well, you know, these are the arguments we seem to deny previous ETF applications and we disagree with uh whatever, like we think that the market is right. All right, Nick. And we, we know that Blackrock Ceo Larry Fink has maybe changed his tune when it comes to crypto within the past year. Have you been following what Larry Fink has been saying about crypto ahead of these two? Well, the one application we know for sure. And the, the spot Ether ETF, well, you know, before he found a way to make money off of it, he seemed pretty skeptical now, uh I forget what exactly the words was. I'm not sure if he was the one who use like change catalyst or whatever the phrase was. But uh yeah, absolutely. He does seem to have changes to, I'm sure it's just a coincidence though, you know, clear, definitely nothing to do with the fact that now they're trying to, you know, file for ETS on top of these crypto products that, you know, will obviously bring his company, uh you know, more money. But you know, that, that's just the case. We're just here to point out the coincidences. All right, Nick, we are going to leave it there. Have a great weekend and we'll see you next week e that Coin Desk Global Policy and regulation managing editor Nick Day and don't forget to sign up for the state of crypto newsletter on coindesk dot com."

A similar notice for the iShares Bitcoin Trust came one week before BlackRock's filing for a bitcoin ETF in June.\n\nBlackRock declined comment on the matter. The firm's iShares product is the leader in exchange-traded funds with more than $2.3 trillion in assets under management.\n\nThe price of ether jumped 7% on Thursday, topping $2,000 for the first time since April. Bitcoin's price saw a similar rise when asset managers began filing to launch ETFs this summer.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission has still not approved a bitcoin ETF. The regulator has long opposed such a fund and blocked Grayscale's attempt to convert its bitcoin trust product into an ETF, though a court overruled that decision in August.\n\nThe SEC did not appeal that court decision but still could choose to block Grayscale's conversion and the other bitcoin funds in the pipeline, including BlackRock's, for other reasons.\n\nIf the SEC does allow bitcoin ETFs, then ether funds would likely be next in line. Ether is the second most popular cryptocurrency behind bitcoin.\n\nDon't miss these stories from CNBC PRO:"

Source: Ali Martinez\n\nAdditionally, crypto expert Trader Tardigrade earlier highlighted Ethereum\u2019s breaking out of the 200-day resistance trendline, while its moving average convergence divergence (MACD) and signal line both turned into position values, and the MACD histogram showed an increase in the upside momentum.\n\nEthereum breakout.

Source: Finbold\n\nAll things considered, ETH might be on a strong bullish trend that could actually see it reach a price between $3,000 and $10,000 in 2024, earlier predicted by the artificial intelligence (AI) tool ChatGPT based on the asset\u2019s expanding institutional adoption, as Finbold reported on November 4.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

On the 9th of this month, ETH price witnessed a massive surge of 12.3% intraday gain which reached a seven-month high of $2,130. This sudden surge in buying pressure is likely aligned with the recent news that BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset management company, has applied for Ethereum spot ETF. Will development prolong the ongoing recovery to $3000?\n\n\n\nAlso Read: BlackRock Files First Ethereum Spot ETF\n\nadvertisement\n\nIs ETH Sustainable Above $2000?\n\nWith the supply pressure at $2136 resistance, the ETH price may witness a minor pullback\n\nCompletion of flag pattern sets a potential target of $2340, followed by $3000\n\nThe intraday trading volume in Ether is $20.2 Billion, indicating a 5.2% gain.\n\nSource- Tradingview\n\nOver the past 30 days, the Ethereum price trajectory has been impressive, climbing from a low of $1,522 to a recent high of $2,136 \u2013 a 40% increase. A key moment in this rally was on November 5th, when coin buyers successfully pushed the price beyond the resistance trendline of a bullish flag pattern.\n\nThis move led to a surge past the significant $2,030 barrier, culminating in the recent 7-month high. With strong accumulations across various Ethereum addresses and BlackRock filling applications for spot Ethereum ETF, the crypto market witnessed positive boasts among traders.\n\nAs of the latest trading sessions, the ETH price at $2,063. Although there is a slight intraday loss of 0.75%, this minor pullback might lead to revisiting the $2,030 level in search of potential support.\n\nShould the coin price stabilize at these higher price levels, the momentum could carry it further up, potentially by another 12% to reach the $2,340 mark, aligned with the first target of the flag pattern, followed by $3000.\n\nEthereum Holders in Profit\n\nSource- intotheblock\n\nThe Global In/Out of the Money (GIOM) metric for Ethereum indicates that currently, 62.13% of ETH addresses are \u2018in the money\u2019 (profiting), while 34.19% are \u2018out of the money\u2019 (at a loss). With the prevailing market recovery sentiment and a majority of holders in profit, there is a reduced likelihood of a panic sell-off, suggesting that investors might continue to support the ongoing bullish rally.\n\nExponential Moving Average (EMA): The positive crossover between the 100-day and 200-day EMA slopes is likely to encourage buyers to maintain the current recovery trend.\n\nDirectional Moving Index (DMI): The significant gap between the DI+ and DI- slopes, currently in a bullish crossover, underscores the prevailing bullish sentiment in the market"

        "content": "A top crypto analytics firm says that deep-pocketed whales are stacking an Ethereum (ETH)-based token that\u2019s surged over the past three months.\n\nAccording to Santiment, traders who own 1,000 to 100,000 tokens of the decentralized oracle protocol Tellor (TRB) now own 46% of the asset\u2019s total supply, up from just 31% seven weeks ago.\n\nAffluent buyers are amassing TRB as the token\u2019s value jumps from under $15 in September to the current price of $134.\n\n\u201cTellor continues to be a force in crypto, jumping as high as $131 today and nearing its May 2021 all-time high. The asset is +1,025% in three months, now 112th in market cap rank, and key 1,000-100,000 TRB wallets have accumulated 15% of the supply in seven weeks.\u201d\n\nSantiment says the indexing protocol The Graph (GRT) also sees the highest amount of whale activity since February with 149 transactions worth over $100,000 each and the addition of 620 more wallets as of November 6th.\n\n\u201cThe Graph has nearly doubled since October 19th, and there has been major whale movement and new addresses being created. To identify whether a bullish trend can continue, the mean dollar age line moving down (like it has for GRT) is often validation.\u201d\n\nSantiment also reveals the crypto assets that traders are currently interested in based on trending keywords. These include Middle East-based Chain X Game\u2019s Revolution Land (REVO) and Ordi (ORDI), the first BRC-20 token on the Bitcoin blockchain that can now be traded on the world\u2019s biggest crypto exchange.\n\n\u201cWhile crypto has had one of its least volatile days in the past month, traders are discussing these top trending topics:\n\nRevoLand: Web3 game ecosystem\n\nQuantum: Computing can potentially make mining more secure\n\nORDI: New listing on Binance.\u201d\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

However, that seems to have changed today as the altcoin observed a rally that occurred thanks to a major development in the crypto space affiliated with Ethereum.\n\nBlackRock files for spot Ethereum ETF\n\nThe world's biggest asset management firm, BlackRock, officially filed for a spot in Ethereum ETF (Exchange Traded Fund) with Nasdaq on Thursday. The filing, pending acknowledgment and approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), marked the ETF as a Commodity-Based Trust Shares.\n\nThis was preceded by hours of anticipation from eager crypto investors who, upon discovering the potential filing, pumped the ETH market. As BlackRock filed for iShares Ethereum Trust in Delaware, signs similar to the spot Bitcoin ETF emerged. Just a week after doing the same for Bitcoin, BlackRock went on to file for a spot BTC ETF.\n\nSpot Ethereum ETF filing\n\nHowever, the fanfare was not compromised in any way, as this is the next biggest thing to occur for Ethereum since the SEC approved the ETH Futures ETFs earlier this year.\n\nRegardless, ETH is back rising on the market, and the altcoins might be able to surprise each other in time.\n\nEthereum price goes back up\n\nEthereum price, at the time of writing, could be seen breaching the $2,100 price mark, fuelled by the optimism that exploded after the BlackRock spot ETF filing emerged. The altcoin hit a nearly six-month high.\n\nUp by more than 10% in the span of a day, ETH also breached the $2,000 barrier. It is preparing to reclaim the highest price ETH has been in the past couple of months. A stabilized price rise is generally what is needed from a cryptocurrency to gain profits, and with the \"home of DeFi\" witnessing a groundbreaking filing today, a further increase might not be off the table.\n\nAt the moment, there are no immediate signs of a price correction, but if the overheated market meets impatient investors looking to profit, Ethereum price could decline naturally.\n\nETH/USD 1-day chart\n\nIf this hype fizzles out quickly, the resulting vulnerability may trigger a sell-off, potentially causing the altcoin's price to drop."

        "content": "SOL more than doubled in the last month. But here\u2019s why Ethereum NFTs continue to outperform Solana NFTs by a mile.\n\nSolana is ripping. Not only has general crypto market sentiment turned more positive, which has boosted assets beyond just bitcoin, but Solana also just completed another one of its attention-grabbing conferences, Breakpoint. That\u2019s all led to SOL more than doubling in the past month.\n\nDespite developer interest in Solana, the jump in its token price, and the fact that the speedy chain is known for NFT activity, as of yet, the leading blockchain for NFTs remains Ethereum.\n\nRead more: NFT Trading Activity on Ethereum Surges, Reaching a Six-Month High\n\nAccording to data from CryptoSlam, in the past 30 days, Ethereum led the NFT market in sales volume with $245 million in sales. Ethereum\u2019s activity underscores its dominance, with a vast number of transactions totaling 745,175 and engaging 70,423 buyers.\n\nComparatively, Solana, which stands fourth in the ranking, reported $30.1 million in sales, just 12% of Ethereum\u2019s volume, even after considering the fact that SOL has outperformed ETH by 127% in the last 30 days.\n\nWith Solana struggling to grab market share in the NFT ecosystem, Hildebert Mouiliere, aka Hildobby, a data scientist at VC firm Dragonfly, told Unchained that \u201ca lot of things that appear on [Solana] are just copying what happened on Ethereum, which isn\u2019t very innovative.\u201d\n\nSolana is also battling the fact that Ethereum\u2019s longer history makes it a hub for many types of activity beyond just NFTs. \u201cI think Ethereum has become a center of liquidity for a lot of things,\u201d said gmoney, NFT collector and founder of 9dcc. \u201cAnd not just NFTs, but also certain tranches of DeFi and what have you. And so I think that\u2019s going to be hard to displace even though there are narratives that build up around other chains.\u201d\n\nHowever, Solana could still become a contender if it builds on the particular advantages of its technology over Ethereum. \u201cI hope that we see in the future some teams actually using what this tech can do to leverage what is lower fees and higher frequency transaction,\u201d said Hildobby.\n\nRead more: Anatoly Yakovenko on Solana\u2019s Astounding Recovery and Its Future Plans\n\nOver a year has passed since marketplaces like Magic Eden sparked a seismic shift in the NFT industry by making creator royalties optional\u2014a move that continues to influence market dynamics.\n\nHildobby noted the complex nature of enforcing such payments and suggested that creators may need to consider additional incentives to encourage voluntary compliance. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to enforce those things,\u201d he said.\n\nAs for where the market could go, Hildobby said he\u2019s looking to the rise of NFT derivatives and lending platforms, which could diversify NFTs as financial instruments. \u201cThe vast majority of volume now is around lending, which allows for those high prices to now land at a much discounted rate,\u201d Hildobby explained, emphasizing the potential for these platforms to broaden market participation.\n\nLearn more: What Are NFT dApps?\n\nGmoney also thinks future innovation in NFTs will come in their financialization and bringing real world assets on chain. As an example, he said, \u201cthe sneaker resell market is huge,\u201d noting that with NFTs, \u201cyou can give them access to credit that they otherwise wouldn\u2019t have.\u201d Once that is a proven application, he said that could show the potential for NFTs to unlock value in other collectors\u2019 items such as watches and handbags. \u201cTo me, one of the most interesting things is obviously, definitely the real world asset side of things, because I just think that you need to see the melding of those two worlds at some point, and I think that starts to happen over the next three to five years.\u201d"

On November 9, BlackRock\u2019s iShares division submitted an official application with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch a spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) tracking ETH, the second largest crypto asset by market capitalization.\n\nIf approved, the fund would trade on the Nasdaq exchange and offer traders exposure to ETH. Notably, the fund will purchase and sell ETH on behalf of investors with exposure reflected as publicly traded shares on the exchange.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nBefore its SEC filing, iShares had registered the planned iShares Ethereum Trust as a Delaware corporation, a first step signaling its intent to launch such a product. However, an official filing means that the SEC has now received the company\u2019s request for the proposed rule change to list the product and will initiate a review process as required by law.\n\nMeanwhile, news of BlackRock\u2019s Ether ETF filing has positively impacted the price of ETH, with the asset rising by 9% in the past 24 hours. ETH is currently trading around $2090, representing a 17% increase in the past seven days and a market cap of $252 billion.\n\nBlackRock Doubling Down on Crypto\n\nBlackRock\u2019s spot ETF application follows its widely publicized move to launch a similar product for Bitcoin (BTC). Per a Fox News report, BlackRock remains increasingly confident of securing approval for the spot Bitcoin ETF early next year.\n\nYet, the fund manager\u2019s move to file for an Ether ETF catches the eye for another reason. It may be considered an indication that BlackRock is eyeing exposure to the broader crypto asset industry and not just Bitcoin.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nIn a recent interview, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink described the surge in crypto prices as a \u201cflight to quality.\u201d The company\u2019s latest Ether ETF backs up that claim and further backs growing evidence that institutional demand for crypto assets is on the rise."

        "content": "In the last few minutes, the price of Ethereum broke above the much-anticipated psychological mark of $2,000. This significant increase in value is a reaction to the recent announcement by BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, of its intention to launch a spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nBlackRock Follows Ethereum After Spot Bitcoin ETF\n\nThe Ethereum community and the market have eagerly anticipated a breakthrough, and it has arrived with Ethereum\u2019s price finally vaulting over the $2,000 resistance level. This rally comes in the wake of BlackRock\u2019s increased involvement in the crypto space. The asset management giant has now extended its product offerings to include a spot Ethereum ETF, shortly after filing for a Bitcoin ETF. This expansion into crypto products by BlackRock marks a significant milestone for Ethereum.\n\nBlackRock, the behemoth in asset management with assets over $9 trillion under management, has made a decisive move as it registered an Ethereum trust in Delaware. This development comes following a similar initiative for Bitcoin, where the financial giant registered the iShares Bitcoin Trust. Notably, this registration took place just a week before BlackRock submitted an ETF application for Bitcoin to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), suggesting a pattern that could foresee the future of Ethereum\u2019s ETF proposal.\n\nThe Ethereum trust registration by BlackRock is a significant indicator of institutional interest in the asset, as it simplifies the process for investors to gain exposure to Ethereum without the complexities of direct trading. The move is seen as an acknowledgment of Ethereum\u2019s growing dominance and potential for inclusion in mainstream investment strategies.\n\nFollowing the announcement, the price of ETH reached a peak of $2,050 on the Binance exchange.\n\nWave Of ETF Approvals Incoming\n\nEven though the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) hasn\u2019t given the green light to any bitcoin ETFs that directly invest in bitcoin, people in the market are really excited about the possibility. The price of bitcoin soared to its highest point in a year and a half when there was news that BlackRock and other companies might get approval soon. As BlackRock, the biggest asset manager globally, now shows interest in an Ethereum product, the same excitement is expected.\n\nThe SEC in the United States has the opportunity to give the go-ahead to twelve proposed spot Bitcoin ETFs over the coming week, with decisions possible up until November 17. Bloomberg analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas pointed out that this period starting from November 9 is a chance for the SEC to approve these applications, which also covers Grayscale\u2019s plan to turn its GBTC trust into an ETF.\n\nARK Invest and 21Shares previously took a notable step in the ETF market by filing for a spot Ethereum (ETH) ETF."

        "content": "Fri 10 Nov 2023 \u25aa 3 min of reading \u25aa by Fitah\n\nThe crypto market has revived optimism among investors for some time now. Most major cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP, have recorded significant gains over the past four weeks. For Ether (ETH), on-chain and technical indicators suggest the imminent arrival of a major bullish wave.\n\nPositive signals from on-chain indicators\n\nAfter hitting critical support around $1520 in October, Ethereum (ETH) has bounced back by over 30% so far. Currently, the price of Ethereum is at $2,020 on Binance.\n\nThis increase is part of a major crypto market recovery, led by Bitcoin, which is now reaching $38,000. For Ethereum, the current rise appears to be the beginning of the long-awaited bull run, as on-chain indicators suggest further upward movement.\n\nAccording to data from IntoTheBlock, the amount of crypto sent to exchanges for selling purposes is lower than the outflows over the past 7 days. Let\u2019s look at the chart below:\n\nChart showing net inflow on Ethereum \u2013 source: IntoTheBlock / Coin-Turk\n\nWe can see that investors have transferred 263,520 ETH from crypto exchange wallets to cold wallets between November 3rd and November 9th. These transactions thus suggest accumulation by long-term investors.\n\nThis indicates that, as the price of Ethereum rises, some investors choose to accumulate more. The total value of these purchases is around half a billion dollars, calculated at the average price. With a cumulative trading volume of about 50 billion, this is particularly exciting accumulation.\n\nEthereum Crypto Price Predictions\n\nOn October 8th, the total value of ongoing investments in Ethereum was $4.2 billion. Today, it has reached more than $5.42 billion, indicating a steady increase in prices in the short and medium term.\n\nAfter consolidating in the range between $1867 and $1766, Ethereum has finally made a major breakthrough. On the daily chart, a significant increase in price can be observed, nearing the annual high of $2138. This level could play a major resistance role for the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.\n\nTechnical analysis on Etherem D1 \u2013 source: TradingView\n\nIf Bitcoin maintains its current trajectory, Ether (ETH) could possibly reach a new annual high of $3000. However, caution should be exercised due to potential profit-taking from investors who bought in since $1520. IntoTheBlock also indicates that 73% of Ether holders are in profit at the current price.\n\nHowever, positive signals from on-chain indicators and technical analysis suggest further upward movement for this cryptocurrency.

        "content": "A popular crypto analyst is remaining bullish on one red-hot altcoin that more than doubled in value within a few weeks.\n\nPseudonymous trader Altcoin Sherpa tells his 197,900 followers on the social media platform X that the gaming studio and NFT (non-fungible token) marketplace platform Vulcan Forged (PYR) has more room to run.\n\nThe trader says that PYR will likely remain in an uptrend after suddenly jumping out of a long-term trading range, similar to what the decentralized oracle provider Chainlink (LINK) has done.\n\n\u201cPYR: this chart reminds me a lot of the LINK chart to be honest. Escaping the range that it\u2019s been in for over a year, looks pretty strong.\u201d\n\nPYR was trading at $2.76 on October 19th and reached a Thursday high of $6.39 at time of writing, a more than 131% increase. PYR has retraced to $5.86 at time of writing.\n\nNext, the trader says he remains bullish on Chainlink, noting how the price remains above key exponential moving averages (EMAs) on the weekly chart.\n\nHe predicts LINK will eventually hit the $20 level, a nearly 36% increase from its current value.\n\n\u201cLINK is going to $20 and there\u2019s nothing you can do about it.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nHot on the heels of BlackRock's newest ETF filing are popular Ethereum-staking tokens.\n\nThe governance token behind Lido Finance has soared more than 20% overnight, per CoinGecko, reaching $2.49 at time of publication. Over the last week, the figure has ballooned even further, hitting 37% since last Friday. Beyond satisfying speculators, LDO also serves as a voting token for the liquid staking protocol Lido Finance. Holders can vote yay or nay on changes to protocol parameters or how Lido should spend its treasury.\n\nLido Finance is the industry's largest liquid staking provider, letting users, notably ETH holders, stake their Ethereum. In exchange, they get a \"stETH\" token which tracks the price of Ethereum and can be used elsewhere in DeFi, keeping users liquid.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRocketPool's native token, the industry's second-largest staking provider, is also on a serious rally, rising over 20% in the past 24 hours to its current value of $32.83. Like Lido, it also gives users access to a staked version of Ethereum called \"RETH.\"\n\nStaking tokens soar on Ethereum ETF hopes\n\nThe price surge for staking tokens appears to be driven by recent news from BlackRock filing a new entity called \"iShares Ethereum Trust\" in Delaware\u2014suggesting plans for an ETF for the cryptocurrency. The news has propelled Ethereum itself to over $2,000 for the first time since July.\n\nIt's not an official ETF filing for Ethereum, but analysts yesterday pointed out how BlackRock executed a similar move ahead of officially filing for its Bitcoin ETF back in June. The asset manager declined to comment on the matter.\n\nThough it's joining a long list of ETF hopefuls for both assets, BlackRock's arrival to the race is notable given its track record for successful application approvals."

Ultimately, Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas confirmed the news in a post to X, calling it the \u201cfirst step towards filing for a spot ETher ETF.\u201d\n\nAlso Read: SEC Charges BlackRock with Failing to Disclose Investments\n\nBlackRock\u2019s eventual filing of a spot Ether ETF has long been pondered by pundits. However, the arrival of such a filing would certainly legitimize the firm\u2019s position within the industry. Subsequently, it reinforces the asset managers\u2019 belief in its long-term potential and impact.\n\nSince its Bitcoin ETF filing, the asset manager has continually praised the asset\u2019s potential. However, the SEC still stands in the way of the first approval of such an offering in the country. Yet, many expect that to change, with approval predicted to occur at some point this year."

Ethereum\u2019s price has reached over $2,100 \u2013 its highest price since April.\n\nThis is also driving Lido\u2019s governance tokens up, showcasing the project\u2019s responsiveness to market conditions.\n\nWith staking capabilities across Ethereum, Solana, Polygon, and other chains, Lido DAO remains well-positioned as a leading staking platform.\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC) has also seen bullish momentum this month. Its price spiked 12.88% to a four-month high of $21.84.\n\nThis aligns with Ethereum\u2019s price rise following the ETF news. The potential for an Ethereum investment product has boosted sentiment around ETC.\n\nWith the Fear & Greed Index at 70, the market mood remains positive. As more users interact with Ethereum, Ethereum Classic stands to benefit from its connected roots.\n\nImmutable (IMX) achieved a nearly 17% price recovery yesterday after bouncing off its 20-day EMA.

While not yet in oversold territory, this downward momentum indicates fading upside strength that could foreshadow additional LDO price declines.\n\nMeanwhile, MACD continues trending upwards but its histogram narrowed from 0.028 to 0.031, highlighting slowing bullish momentum.\n\nThe LDO price has immediate support at the Fib 0.786 level of $2.279, a break below this level could turn it into resistance and open the door for a steeper drop towards the zone between $2.145 to $2.187.\n\nHowever, if the $2.279 support holds, LDO could stabilize and potentially retest upside resistance between $2.407 to $2.523.\n\nOverall, Lido DAO sits at a pivotal juncture between key support and resistance.\n\nPrudent risk management is recommended while awaiting confirmation of the next major price trend.\n\nA decisive breakout past $2.523 resistance or breakdown under $2.145 support should set the tone for LDO\u2019s near-term outlook.\n\nETC Price Prediction: Will Ethereum Classic\u2019s Rally Withstand the Weakness?\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter posting a strong rally over the past few weeks, Ethereum Classic (ETC) experienced its first signs of weakness today, with the ETC price pulling back from multi-month highs amidst declining momentum.\n\nWith ETC stabilizing above key support levels, technical indicators remain at a crossroads, leaving traders to ponder if this is just a temporary blip or the start of a deeper correction.\n\nThe 20-day EMA for the ETC price currently stands at $17.74, crossing above the 50-day EMA of $16.75 for the first time this year.\n\nTypically, this golden cross is seen as a strongly bullish signal. However, with the crossover occurring so recently and the ETC price already extended, caution may be warranted.\n\nThe RSI has pulled back from yesterday\u2019s overbought reading of 80.46 down to 78.85. While still in overbought territory, this shows bullish momentum is slowing.\n\nThe MACD histogram has risen to 0.33, up from 0.27 yesterday. However, the slowing trajectory suggests upside drive may be fading.\n\nETC is currently trading at $20.56, down 0.58% so far today.\n\nThis places ETC just below horizontal resistance between $20.23 and $20.79, which aligns with the Fib 0.236 level at $20.79. Getting rejected in this area could signal a temporary top is in place.\n\nOn the downside, initial support comes in at the Fib 0.382 level of $19.23. If this fails to hold, ETC could quickly descend towards the 20-day EMA around $17.74 which would equate to a 14% drop from current levels.\n\nWhile the multi-week uptrend remains intact for now, early signs of exhaustion suggest Ethereum Classic may be due for a pullback.\n\nKey levels to watch will be the initial support around $19.23 and resistance at $20.79.\n\nA break above resistance could resume the uptrend, while a drop below the $19.23 support warns of a deeper correction ahead.\n\nTrading within defined risk limits is advised over the near term until ETC\u2019s next move becomes apparent.\n\nIMX Price Skyrockets by 19.85% on Ubisoft Collaboration\n\n\n\n\n\nThe IMX price has seen a dramatic surge today, jumping 19.85% amidst news of a major collaboration with video game publisher Ubisoft.\n\nThis has propelled the price to attempt to break through multiple resistance levels as bullish momentum accelerates.\n\nThe 20-day EMA for the IMX price stands at $0.7763, now well below the 50-day EMA of $0.6784.\n\nWith the faster moving average crossing above the slower moving average, this golden cross is a decidedly bullish sign for the IMX price going forward.\n\nMeanwhile, the RSI has skyrocketed to 81.87, up strongly from yesterday\u2019s 73.79 reading.\n\nThis shows IMX is heavily overbought right now after the huge single-day gain, but still has room to climb before hitting extremely overbought territory.\n\nThe MACD histogram is printing at 0.0298, a sizable increase from the previous day\u2019s 0.0207 value.\n\nThis expanding positive momentum points to building bullish sentiment that could continue pushing the IMX price higher in the very near term.\n\nIn terms of key price levels, IMX faced resistance between $0.9841 to $1.0210, near the Fib 0.382 level at $0.9836.\n\nAfter breaking through this zone, it now faces resistance between $1.0606 to $1.0975, close to the Fib 0.236 level at $1.0969.\n\nOn support, IMX has backing between $0.8925 to $0.9308, aligning with the Fib 0.5 level at $0.8921. As long as the IMX price holds above this zone, the path of least resistance remains up.\n\nWith today\u2019s IMX price surge on big news volume, bulls are clearly in control. However, the big one-day jump also means IMX is overextended on the shorter timeframes.\n\nThis signals traders should wait for a pullback or consolidation before looking for additional entries on the long side.\n\nAny retracement that holds the $0.89 support area could offer a buying opportunity.\n\nOtherwise, remaining patient for IMX to establish a new trading range seems prudent.\n\nAs seasoned cryptocurrencies capture the spotlight, new presale tokens like Bitcoin ETF and Meme Kombat look to make a name for themselves among investors seeking the next moonshot.\n\nChecking Crypto Presales as Bitcoin Alternatives\n\n\n\nBitcoin has dominated the crypto market for years, but investors are starting to look beyond it to find other potential breakout cryptocurrencies.\n\nWhile Bitcoin will likely remain the pillar of the crypto space, its reign may slowly give way to upstart competitors.\n\nBy diversifying your cryptocurrency portfolio beyond Bitcoin, you open yourself to higher reward possibilities, albeit with higher risk.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s relatively stagnant price action recently has spurred interest in finding the next big crypto before it takes off.\n\nOne way to gain early exposure is through presales of new cryptocurrencies.\n\nAlso known as presales, these early bird offers allow you to buy tokens at discounted rates compared to their eventual listing price.\n\nTwo presale tokens aspiring to reach Bitcoin-like adoption one day are Bitcoin ETF Token and Meme Kombat.\n\nBitcoin ETF Token: Capitalizing on the Growing Interest in Bitcoin ETFs \u2013 Is This the Best Crypto to Buy Now?\n\nThe cryptocurrency market has seen a resurgence in recent months, with the price of Bitcoin rising above $37,000 on Thursday.\n\nThis recovery has sparked renewed interest in crypto-assets, including a new token called Bitcoin ETF Token.\n\nThe initial coin offering for Bitcoin ETF Token launched just days ago but has already raised over $280,000 so far.\n\nThe token intends to provide exposure to the potential approval of a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nUncovering the secrets behind #BTCETF, as it not only readies itself for the #Bitcoin #ETF surge but also introduces staking incentives, fostering network resilience and steadfastness. \u2728 pic.twitter.com/9UDNGsOOud \u2014 BTCETF_Token (@BTCETF_Token) November 10, 2023\n\nBitcoin ETF Token incorporates features common in decentralized finance (DeFi), including staking rewards.\n\nNearly 33 million tokens have already been staked, earning staking yields of up to 873% APY.\n\nThe staking rewards are dynamic based on the percentage of the staking pool held by each user.\n\nThe possibility of a bitcoin ETF has gained traction recently amid evolving sentiment at the SEC.\n\nWhile firm deadlines are set for proposals by ARK Invest and others, a parallel process for Grayscale Bitcoin Trust has reportedly opened conversations with the SEC.\n\nThe difference between a closed-end fund like Grayscale and an ETF is substantial.\n\nThe potential conversion to an open-ended structure has stoked further speculation of an imminent approval.\n\nThe introduction of a bitcoin ETF would allow mainstream investors easier access to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency.\n\nThis could significantly impact trading volumes and prices given the trillions currently invested in the ETF market.\n\nBitcoin ETF Token provides targeted exposure to a potential ETF approval, while its staking rewards and deflationary token burn offer additional incentives.\n\nThe presale pricing at $0.005 per token has fueled interest in getting in early on one of the best crypto to buy now before its next price increase.\n\nVisit Bitcoin ETF Token Now\n\nMeme Kombat: The Best Crypto to Buy Now for Memes, Gaming, and Gains\n\nMeme Kombat ($MK) seeks to shake up the meme coin market with a one-of-a-kind gaming and betting platform.\n\nThe project has raised over $1.45 million so far in its $MK token presale and introduced a staking feature earning yields of up to 1,518% APY.\n\nMeme Kombat offers a unique blend of blockchain technology and off-chain transactions to facilitate efficient, low-cost staking and gaming.\n\nUsers only pay network fees when staking and unstaking tokens, with all reward claims and gaming interactions gas-less.\n\n\ud83d\udce3 Major Update \ud83d\udce3 The Meme Kombat Staking Dashboard is officially live and ready to be used by you!

        "title": "Ethereum Layer 2's Rise Towards Mass Adoption - BSC NEWS",
        "content": "This guest research article from Footprint Analytics explores one of the hottest topics in the cryptocurrency world - Ethereum Layer 2 Scaling\n\nThe vision of a secure and user-friendly decentralized internet, supported by a shared economic framework and embraced by billions, relies on developing critical infrastructure. Scaling solutions, known as Layer 2, play a crucial role in constructing this foundation and enhancing Ethereum's capabilities. These projects work together, forming a robust ecosystem that propels Ethereum towards its full potential.\n\nIn this article, we will delve into the innovations and narratives surrounding Layer 2 networks. We will discuss the challenges faced by these networks and their potential transformative impact on Ethereum's mass adoption. Our analysis will be based on data from Footprint Analytics' Layer 2 research page, providing valuable insights into this evolving ecosystem.\n\nWhy Do We Need Layer 2?\n\nBlockchain technology has long been praised for its desirable qualities of decentralization, security, and scalability. However, the \"blockchain trilemma\" suggests that achieving all three simultaneously within a simple architecture is challenging. Ethereum, which currently processes over 1 million transactions per day, often faces high transaction fees due to increasing demand. To address this issue, Layer 2 networks have emerged as an innovative solution.\n\nThe primary objective of Layer 2 networks is to enhance transaction throughput by achieving higher transactions per second (TPS) while maintaining decentralization and security. These networks achieve this by consolidating multiple off-chain transactions into a single layer 1 transaction. As a result, transaction fees are significantly reduced, making Ethereum more accessible and inclusive for a wider range of users.\n\nDifferent Types of Layer 2\n\nCurrently, there are three main types of Layer 2, including rollups, state channels and plasma.\n\nRollups\n\nRollups are layer 2 solutions that aggregate numerous transactions into a single transaction on layer 1, resulting in user cost savings by distributing transaction fees across participants within the rollup. There are two main types of rollups: optimistic rollups and zero-knowledge rollups (ZK-rollups). Optimistic rollups utilize fraud proofs to ensure the validity of off-chain transactions, while ZK-rollups employ zero-knowledge proofs to enhance privacy and security.\n\nExamples of optimistic rollups include Arbitrum(Arbitrum One), Optimism(OP Mainnet), and Base.\n\nArbitrum, introduced by the Offchain Labs team in August 2021, has emerged as a prominent player in the industry, capturing a market share of over 50%. With its Nitro upgrade, Arbitrum has achieved full Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) equivalence, enabling developers to seamlessly migrate smart contracts from Ethereum to Layer 2 with minimal or no modifications required.\n\nOptimism, the second-largest Ethereum Layer 2 solution, soft-launched its mainnet in January 2021 and became fully accessible to everyone in December 2021. Built with an EVM-equivalent architecture, Optimism offers a seamless scaling solution for Ethereum applications without encountering significant challenges.\n\nBase, built on OP Stack in collaboration with Optimism, went live on the mainnet in July 2023. Within a few months, it achieved significant success, securing the third position in the Layer 2 market. Incubated by Coinbase, Base leverages Coinbase's expertise in building crypto products.\n\nOn the other hand, ZK-rollup implementations include zkSync Era, Starknet, Linea, and Polygon zkEVM.\n\nzkSync Era, recognized as the world's first zkEVM blockchain, launched on the mainnet for all users in March 2023 and swiftly secured the fourth position in the Layer 2 market in terms of market share. zkSync Era has established itself as the dominant rollup solution in terms of user activities, including TPS and transactions.\n\nStarknet went live on mainnet in November 2021. It achieves secure low-cost transactions and high performance by using the STARK cryptographic proof system. Starknet is powered by Cairo and as such is not EVM compatible. Efforts are underway to enable compatibility between Solidity and Cairo through the transpiler Warp.\n\nLinea, a ConsenSys-powered Layer 2 solution, went live on the Ethereum mainnet in July 2023. It offers EVM compatibility, making it easy for developers to migrate and build applications on its network.\n\nPolygon zkEVM public beta was launched in March 2023 and it provides EVM equivalence. Polygon, previously known as Matic, is a blockchain platform offering diverse blockchain solutions. Polygon zkEVM is one of the offerings from Polygon.\n\nState channels\n\nState channels are a mechanism that allows participants to conduct fast and unrestricted off-chain transactions, settling the final outcome on the Ethereum blockchain. This approach reduces network congestion, fees, and transaction delays.\n\nThe Raiden Network is an off-chain scaling solution that focuses on researching state channel technology, defining protocols, and developing reference implementations. It enables near-instant, low-fee, and scalable payments, making it compatible with any ERC20 token on Ethereum. The network aims to enhance scalability and usability while maintaining compatibility with the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nPlasma\n\nA plasma chain is an independent blockchain that is connected to the main Ethereum chain through anchoring, and it utilizes fraud proofs, similar to optimistic rollups, to resolve disputes.\n\nThe OMG Network utilizes Layer-2 Plasma architecture, which offers robust safety assurances and high throughput. It provides a scalable solution for third-party developers interested in building decentralized payment applications on the Ethereum platform.\n\nData Insights\n\nA consensus is forming: Ethereum will reach mass adoption, a matter of when, not if. So, how far is it?\n\nSimilar to the diffusion of other technologies, the adoption trajectory of Ethereum can be described by a classic bell curve. It begins with a limited number of innovators who are quick to embrace the technology, followed by the engagement of early adopters. As Ethereum continues to evolve and mature, it gradually expands its reach to encompass the early and late majority, leading to a mass adoption phase. Ultimately, the technology reaches the remaining segment of the population, referred to as the laggards, in its final phase of adoption.\n\nLet\u2019s explore the impact Layer 2 has on the mass adoption of Ethereum from these aspects:\n\nTVL\n\nTotal value locked, or TVL, is anticipated to be the leading indicator of where adoption will occur.\n\nAs of October 2023, Arbitrum is leading the pack, with an impressive TVL of $6.00 billion and a market share of 61.03%, solidifying its position as the dominant player in the market. Optimism follows behind with a TVL of $2.60 billion and a market share of 26.41%, showcasing its substantial adoption and user engagement.\n\nOther chains form the second echelon but their market shares fall far behind \u2013 less than 5%. Base, the newcomer, which was launched on the mainnet for everyone on July 13, 2023, secures the third spot with a TVL of $462.91 million. The zkSync Era network holds the fourth position with $450.87 million locked, while Starknet occupies the fifth place with a TVL of $135.27 million.\n\nUnique users and transactions\n\nUser activities, such as the number of unique users (referred to as \"bridgers\" who interact with Ethereum) and the volume of transactions, serve as key adoption indicators for adoption.\n\nAmong the various Layer 2 solutions, zkSync Era stands out as the frontrunner. It has accumulated an impressive 2.67 million unique users, accounting for 37.10% of all rollups, and facilitated 2.23 million transactions, representing 50.84% of rollup activity. zkSync Era's initial airdrop activity attracted a significant number of users, and it has maintained its leading position since then. Starknet follows closely in terms of transaction volume, with 1.70 million transactions, constituting 23.70% of rollup activity.\n\nBase and Linea, both launched on the mainnet in July 2023, have gained remarkable popularity in the market. They have surpassed Optimism and Polygon zkEVM in terms of both unique user engagement and transaction volume.\n\nThroughput\n\nOne of the primary scaling challenges frequently discussed in the blockchain community pertains to transaction throughput.\n\nAt present, the Ethereum Mainnet has a capacity of approximately 15 transactions per second (TPS). In contrast, Visa boasts the ability to handle around 24,000 TPS, while Mastercard can process 5,000 TPS.\n\nLayer 2 is bridging the gap for Ethereum. In October, the average TPS achieved by prominent rollups like Arbitrum and zkSync Era ranged from approximately 9.5 to 10, making them the closest in performance to the Ethereum network among the rollup solutions available. Rollups have collectively made significant contributions to scalability, surpassing the Ethereum mainnet by 321% in throughput, with a scalability factor of 4.21 in October.\n\nWhile rollups contribute to scalability, no individual rollup currently surpasses Ethereum in terms of throughput. In a bear market, attracting and retaining users is challenging for both Layer 1 and Layer 2 networks. Building a prosperous Layer 2 ecosystem requires not only robust solutions but also high-traffic applications. Additionally, the user experience suffers due to the lack of seamless interaction between multiple Layer 2 solutions and between Layer 1 and Layer 2, for example, necessitating wallet switching and incurring liquidity costs.\n\nCost\n\nThe adoption of layer 2 networks has played a crucial role in reducing network fees on Ethereum. By consolidating multiple off-chain transactions into a single layer 1 transaction, Ethereum has witnessed a significant decline in transaction fees.\n\nAccording to Footprint Analytics, the average transaction fee in October 2023 for rollups was currently between 3% and 10% that of Ethereum.\n\nThese figures underscore the increasing popularity and utilization of Layer 2 networks, highlighting their potential to alleviate congestion and enhance scalability on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nInnovations in Layer 2\n\nIn the dynamic landscape of blockchain technology, leading Layer 2 solutions such as Optimism, zkSync, and Arbitrum are actively pursuing innovative approaches to address persistent challenges while maintaining a focus on interoperability. These prominent players maintain a rapid pace of innovation, including technology and application, continually striving to stay ahead and retain their competitive edge in the market.\n\nThe Superchain, proposed within the Optimism ecosystem, is a network of rollup networks that share a common codebase called the OP Stack. This framework aims to establish an interoperable environment where various layer 2 networks can communicate and transact with each other, similar to how the internet enables communication between devices. By providing horizontal scalability, the Superchain addresses challenges associated with traditional multi-chain architectures. These challenges include differentiated security architectures among parallel chains, which can lead to increased systemic risk as more chains are added, and the cost of setting up new nodes for each additional chain.\n\nIn June 2023, zkSync introduced \"Hyperchains\", a novel network that operates as fractal-like instances of zkEVM. These Hyperchains run in parallel with a shared settlement on Layer 1, offering the flexibility of functioning as Layer 2 networks alongside zkSync Era or as Layer 3 Validiums. Hyperchains within the zkSync ecosystem can be developed and deployed by anyone without the need for permission. To ensure trust and seamless interoperability, each Hyperchain must be powered by the same zkEVM engine available on the ZK Stack. GRVT, a hybrid crypto exchange combining centralized and decentralized exchange benefits, will be the first hyperchain in the zkSync ecosystem. Its closed alpha version is expected to launch in November 2023, followed by the mainnet release in Q1 2024.\n\nArbitrum Stylus, launched by Arbitrum in August 2023, allows smart contract development in multiple programming languages such as Rust, C, and C++ on their Layer 2 network. In addition to Solidity, developers can now write smart contracts in languages compatible with WebAssembly (WASM). WASM enables running code from languages like Rust and C++ on the web, and with Arbitrum Stylus, on the blockchain as well. Stylus introduces a second, co-equal virtual machine that is fully interoperable with the EVM, offering a new approach to writing smart contracts.\n\nNarratives in Layer 2\n\nLayer 2 itself has emerged as a prominent narrative in the cryptocurrency space since 2022. Within the realm of Layer 2, narratives have played a significant role in shaping public perception and subsequently influencing market movements. These narratives provide insights into the future of Layer 2 and Ethereum as a whole.\n\nFully on-chain games . These games utilize the blockchain as an alternative to centralized game servers, incorporating every aspect of the game on-chain, including assets, logic, state, and storage. Starknet and COMBO(live on testnet currently) have positioned themselves as a prominent supporter of fully on-chain games within the realm of public chains.\n\n.

Starknet and COMBO(live on testnet currently) have positioned themselves as a prominent supporter of fully on-chain games within the realm of public chains. Modular blockchains. Initially, blockchains were designed with a monolithic approach, where a single blockchain handled all tasks. However, the concept of modular blockchains emerged to specialize in specific functions rather than attempting to cover everything. Celestia is the first modular blockchain network. It\u2019s ready to launch and unveiled the airdrop and launch plans in October 2023.\n\nZero gas fee . Gas fees have been a significant hurdle for the mass adoption of Ethereum. To address this pain point, GasZero(live on testnet currently) has emerged as a Layer 2 blockchain network that offers a unique solution: it charges zero gas fees for trusted end users. On GasZero, users can interact with decentralized networks and smart contracts without the need for any tokens in advance in their wallets.\n\n.

On GasZero, users can interact with decentralized networks and smart contracts without the need for any tokens in advance in their wallets. Layer 3. The concept of \"Layer 3\" in the blockchain industry does not have a widely accepted definition at the moment. Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum, believes that it is premature to establish definitive definitions because the architecture of the multi-rollup ecosystem is still evolving, and most discussions are theoretical in nature. However, Buterin has shared three visions of what Layer 3s could potentially represent in the future.\n\nLayer 2 is for scaling, and Layer 3 is for customized functionality, for example, privacy.\n\nLayer 2 is for general-purpose scaling, and Layer 3 is for customized scaling.\n\nLayer 2 is for trustless scaling (rollups), and Layer 3 is for weakly trusted scaling (validiums).\n\nChallenges Faced by Layer 2\n\nThe growing popularity of cost-effective and efficient Layer 2 networks as alternatives to the congested Ethereum network has gained considerable attention. It is crucial to maintain a robust base layer while cautiously expanding certain aspects of its capabilities. Within the Ethereum community, the evolution of technology and applications is encouraged, but maintaining a delicate balance between user-friendliness and the benefits of decentralization is of utmost importance, as emphasized by Vitalik Buterin during the Ethereum Hong Kong Hackathon in October 2023.\n\nLayer 2 networks face four critical challenges in their quest for scalability on Ethereum according to Buterin.\n\nProof system security and decentralization. Validity (ZK) proofs and fraud proofs are employed to demonstrate the legitimacy of transactions without requiring processing on the main Ethereum chain. However, validity proofs face centralization concerns due to their reliance on specific hardware.\n\nValidity (ZK) proofs and fraud proofs are employed to demonstrate the legitimacy of transactions without requiring processing on the main Ethereum chain. However, validity proofs face centralization concerns due to their reliance on specific hardware. Sequencing decentralization. These sequencers verify, order, and compress transactions for transfer to Layer 1. However, this centralized setup has drawn criticism for its potential as a single point of failure, censorship vulnerability, or susceptibility to shutdown by authorities.\n\nThese sequencers verify, order, and compress transactions for transfer to Layer 1.

They enable seamless interaction with multiple Layer 2 solutions without the need for wallet switching.\n\nThey enable seamless interaction with multiple Layer 2 solutions without the need for wallet switching. Data availability. It refers to on-chain data availability, the challenge of storing a full copy of the blockchain data to validate transactions. It is worth noting that solutions like Validiums and Optimiums are not typically categorized as Layer 2s because they do not publish data on Layer 1. Instead, they introduce additional trust assumptions on top of Layer 1.\n\nIn addition, as we mentioned earlier, no individual Layer 2 currently surpasses Ethereum in terms of throughput. It\u2019s urgent to develop the ecosystem within each network.\n\nEcosystem and dApps. Currently, Layer 2 networks host various protocols in their ecosystems, with the majority of them being in the DeFi space. By bringing in phenomenal dApps, Layer 2 networks can expand their ecosystem and attract more users, encouraging them to stay.\n\nEnding Words\n\nIn conclusion, Layer 2 networks are propelling Ethereum one step closer to mass adoption by effectively tackling the scalability and cost challenges that have hindered its progress. These networks offer innovative solutions that enhance transaction throughput and reduce fees, making Ethereum more accessible and inclusive for a wider audience.\n\nFurthermore, beyond Ethereum's Layer 2 networks, opBNB has emerged as BNB Chain's response to the scalability challenge. In September 2023, opBNB successfully completed the public launch of its mainnet. Indeed, the responses and future directions of other public chains in the face of these challenges are equally tantalizing. The key emphasis remains on ecosystem development and user attraction. The vast expanse of possibilities stretches out before us, as each chain embarks on its own unique path towards scalability and mass adoption.\n\n\u200d\n\nWhat is Footprint Analytics?\n\nFootprint Analytics is a blockchain data solutions provider.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nThe global Ethereum supply has contracted by just over 4,700 ETH, or about $9.5 million, since Monday, according to data aggregator ultrasound.money.\n\nWhile that figure pales in comparison to the cryptocurrency\u2019s massive $243.4 billion market capitalization, it is nonetheless eyebrow-raising: ETH has not experienced such a prolonged deflationary period in months, and the rally appears to have halted the token\u2019s recent inflationary spiral.\n\nAnd perhaps not coincidentally, the market currently likes what it sees when it comes to Ethereum: Earlier today, ETH touched $2,000 for the first time since July. At writing, the token sits at $2,020, up 6.7% in the last 24 hours.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSo, what\u2019s behind ETH\u2019s deflationary sea change this week? And how long can the momentum be expected to last?\n\nThanks to the fee-burning mechanism that\u2019s governed Ethereum since 2021, the more traffic on the network, the higher gas fees rise. And the higher gas fees rise, the more ETH is \u201cburned\u201d by the network, or permanently removed from circulation. That means increased traffic on the Ethereum network could lead to more ETH being removed from circulation than created on a yearly basis.\n\nIndeed, average gas fees on Ethereum have more than doubled since Sunday, according to Etherscan; at writing, for example, the average Uniswap transaction requires $16.35 worth of gas. Transferring an NFT on Rarible currently costs around $21.77.\n\nBut what accounts for the increase in activity on the network?\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNFT trading volume hit a three month high this week. Are degens flipping jpegs again? And are they to thank for Ethereum\u2019s short-term comeback? Probably not, says Alice Kohn, Glassnode\u2019s head ETH analyst\u2014those bumps may be a red herring.\n\n\u201cThere has been a surge in NFT-related activities, hinting at a possible resurgence in the NFT market,\u201d Kohn told Decrypt. \u201cHowever, these activities remain relatively modest compared to the NFT boom witnessed earlier in the year.\u201d\n\nKohn does not believe that this week\u2019s ETH deflation can be attributed to minor fluctuations in NFT trading. Instead, she\u2019s found that the deflation mostly stemmed from another source: altcoins.\n\nEthereum, being the permissionless network that it is, allows for anyone to create a blockchain-based token for just about anything. These tokens, typically of the ERC-20 variety, trade on both centralized and decentralized exchanges, such as Uniswap, and make up a significant portion of the altcoin market.\n\nUniswap currently ranks as the leading gas guzzler on the Ethereum network, per Etherscan, with transactions on the protocol accounting for about 13% of all Ethereum traffic; once-dominant NFT platforms like OpenSea and Blur, which similarly led in gas fees during the NFT bull run, are hardly making a dent these days.\n\n\u201cThe latest uptick in network activities, which led to the deflationary turn for the ETH supply, clearly comes from altcoins,\u201d Kohn said. \u201cThe latest surge in interest, particularly evident in GameFi tokens, underscores the evolving landscape of the crypto market.\u201d\n\nNumerous ETH-based tokens have enjoyed substantial rallies this week\u2014LINK is up 27.2%, and PEPE is up 12%, for example. Those gains appear to be riding a macro tide that, in the last seven days, also lifted altcoins XRP, Cardano, and Solana by between 11% and 20%\u2014potentially indicating renewed investor interest in Bitcoin alternatives.\n\nSome analysts have predicted that Ethereum\u2019s altcoin-fueled deflationary run this week could signal that the bottom is in for the token, and that ETH is now set to climb towards $3,000. But Kohn isn\u2019t so certain that renewed altcoin interest is strictly a good thing for Ethereum\u2019s short-term health.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThere's a possibility that funds may flow into BTC first and then navigate down the risk curve directly into altcoins, bypassing ETH,\u201d she said. \u201cThis could position ETH in a challenging scenario, sandwiched between BTC as the premier crypto asset and more enticing risk-on altcoins.\u201d\n\nDisclaimer The views and opinions expressed by the author are for informational purposes only and do not constitute financial, investment, or other advice."

        "content": "Share:\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price continues to pump hard, as speculators front-run a spot BTC exchange-traded fund approval from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Ethereum (ETH) price is also showing remarkable strength, coming on the back of BlackRock hinting at a spot Ether ETF to come soon. Meanwhile, Ripple (XRP) price is showing weakness ahead of a briefing on its longstanding case against the financial regulator.\n\nAlso Read: Week Ahead: Ditch Bitcoin for these altcoins this week likely to be more profitable\n\nCrypto ETF FAQs What is an ETF? An Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) is an investment vehicle or an index that tracks the price of an underlying asset. ETFs can not only track a single asset, but a group of assets and sectors. For example, a Bitcoin ETF tracks Bitcoin\u2019s price. ETF is a tool used by investors to gain exposure to a certain asset. Is Bitcoin futures ETF approved? Yes. The first Bitcoin futures ETF in the US was approved by the US Securities & Exchange Commission in October 2021. A total of seven Bitcoin futures ETFs have been approved, with more than 20 still waiting for the regulator\u2019s permission. The SEC says that the cryptocurrency industry is new and subject to manipulation, which is why it has been delaying crypto-related futures ETFs for the last few years. Is Bitcoin spot ETF approved? Bitcoin spot ETF has been approved outside the US, but the SEC is yet to approve one in the country. After BlackRock filed for a Bitcoin spot ETF on June 15, the interest surrounding crypto ETFs has been renewed. Grayscale \u2013 whose application for a Bitcoin spot ETF was initially rejected by the SEC \u2013 got a victory in court, forcing the US regulator to review its proposal again. The SEC\u2019s loss in this lawsuit has fueled hopes that a Bitcoin spot ETF might be approved by the end of the year.\n\nBitcoin price uptrend stalls, makes $34,000 likely as markets don\u2019t pause\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price uptrend seems to have lost steam. With the king of crypto still consolidating within the confines of an ascending parallel channel, a retest of the lower boundary seems likely following weakening momentum.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator is not only moving flat but also deviating to the south, hinting at buyer exhaustion now that momentum is falling. The Awesome Oscillator (AO) histogram is also moving toward the midlines with a sustained series of red bars as seller count continues to increase. Also, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator has also crossed below the yellow band, another sell signal that arises as longs close their positions.\n\nAs such, Bitcoin price could soon break below the lower boundary of the ascending channel to potentially test the $34,000 level. If this support level fails to hold, the slump could extend to $32,000 or even the $31,190 support level. Such a move would constitute a 12% slip from current levels.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-day chart\n\nThe narrative would be different, however, if sidelined investors join the rush, with the ensuing buying pressure extending the gains for Bitcoin price. In such a turn, BTC could overcome the $35,500 barricade and move higher, breaking past the $35,984 range high.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin price trends above $35,000 after BTC survives sell off by miners\n\nEthereum price could fall out of the supply zone at $1,861\n\nEthereum (ETH) price has faced a rejection from the $1,935 level, the midline of the supply zone that extends from $1,861 to $2,004. The largest altcoin by market capitalization could soon fall out of this supplier congestion zone.\n\nA retracement to the $1,800 level or lower to the $1,748 support level seems likely, with the RSI teasing above the 70 level with a deviation to the south.\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nHowever, judging from the stance of both the AO and MACD indicators moving into positive territory, bulls still have a presence in the ETH market. Increased buying pressure from this cohort of traders could send Ethereum price past the $1,935 level, with a flip of this barrier to a support floor confirming the continuation of the intermediary trend.\n\nIn a highly bullish case, Ethereum price could extricate itself from the grasp of the supply zone above $2,004 to tag the $2,029 resistance level. A flip of this hurdle into support would set the tone for ETH to reach for the $2,141 range high, a level last tested in mid-April.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum whales scoop up the altcoin, likely to catalyze ETH price rally\n\nRipple price in recovery rally, $0.69 level is critical\n\nRipple (XRP) price is in a recovery rally, confronting the $0.69 resistance level. Depending on how the bulls play their hand, it could be a make-or-break moment for the payments token. Overcoming $0.69 would set the tone for an extension to the supply zone between $0.77 and $0.81. A break and close above its midline at $0.79 would embolden XRP to collect sell-side liquidity as it heads toward the $0.93 range high.\n\nThe RSI at 75 shows XRP is overbought, signaling traders should not open new positions but keep their existing ones open until the RSI is at the brink of crossing below 70. A closer look shows a promising deviation of the RSI as bulls fight with their last breath.\n\nMeanwhile, the histogram bars of the AO shows bulls are leading the market. The MACD also supports the outlook, moving north as momentum continues to grow.\n\nXRP/USDT 1-day chart\n\nConversely, increased selling pressure could send Ripple price south, breaching the $0.66 support before ultimately slipping below $0.59. A break and close below $0.59 would invalidate the bullish thesis, sending XRP toward a consolidation phase under $0.53.\n\nAlso Read: Ripple hits new milestone in payments, likely catalyst for XRP price"

On the other hand, Ethereum recorded $26,689,252 in total sales, with 11,225 buyers.\n\nDespite Ethereum maintaining a higher total sales figure, the relatively lower wash percentage of Bitcoin suggests a potentially healthier and more organic market activity.\n\nHowever, when it comes to volatility, data from Deribit, the leading crypto derivatives exchange, shows that the spread between ETH and BTC volatility, commonly referred to as the ETH DVOL vs. BTC DVOL spread, has narrowed significantly since October 23rd from -11.6 to just -0.6. This shift indicates a change in investor sentiment and increased attention towards Ethereum and altcoins.\n\nIn light of this development, Ethereum has outperformed Bitcoin over the past fourteen days. ETH has seen significant price movement, gaining over 2% in the last 24 hours, 6% in the last seven days, and 4% in the last fourteen days, bringing its current price to $1,899.\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin has exhibited a slowdown in its upward momentum and is currently consolidating above $35,400. It has seen a 2% increase in the past 24 hours, 3% in the past seven days, and 1% in the fourteen-day timeframe.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that BTC has gained more than 82% year-to-date, while ETH has only increased by 30% during the same period, according to CoinGecko data.\n\nNasdaq 100 Correlation With Bitcoin Plummets\n\nAccording to recent Kaiko data, BTC has witnessed a significant decline in its correlation with traditional assets throughout the year. One notable development is the diminishing correlation between Bitcoin and the Nasdaq 100 index.\n\nOver the past year, Bitcoin\u2019s 60-day correlation with the Nasdaq 100 has substantially declined, plunging from over 70% in September 2022 to approximately 19% as of last week.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s negative correlation with the US dollar, which ranged from 40% to 50%, has also weakened. Currently, the correlation is around 11%, signifying a reduced tendency for Bitcoin\u2019s value to move in the opposite direction of the US dollar.\n\nWhile Bitcoin\u2019s correlation with gold has seen some upward momentum since August, the average correlation throughout the year has remained relatively low at 12%.\n\nThis suggests that the relationship between Bitcoin and gold has been modest regarding price movements and indicates a potential divergence in investment characteristics between the two assets.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock, chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Yesterday, BlackRock has submitted a 19b-4 filing with Nasdaq for the iShares Ethereum Trust, indicating plans to trade shares on the Nasdaq exchange. This move follows a similar process used for the iShares Bitcoin Trust earlier this year and suggests BlackRock might soon propose an Ethereum ETF to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. This development comes amid recent actions by BlackRock, including registering the iShares Ethereum Trust in Delaware and proposing a bitcoin fund in June. Ethereum's price rose following these developments, signaling market anticipation for potential new offerings from the asset management giant.\n\nFrom a technical perspective on the Ethereum chart, following the news of BlackRock registering an entity, the second-largest cryptocurrency surged over 10%. The price momentarily approached its previous peak from the first half of this year at the 2130-2140 USD level. Considering Bitcoin's recent breakout of nearly 20% from its latest highs, there is still potential for Ethereum's growth to continue. Currently, a pullback from these highs is observed, but if the narrative intensifies and capital shifts from BTC to ETH, further growth could continue. The maximum extent of the current upward wave appears to be around the 2500 USD level, which coincides with the support level from the last bull run in 2021 and the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement of the downward move from the 2021 highs to the 2022 low. However, if bulls fail to surpass the current level, we might see a retest of the 1930 USD levels as well.\n\nSource: xStation 5"

        "content": "Zameer is a financial analyst and writer with a particular interest in cryptocurrency markets. He has been studying cryptocurrencies and their market behavior for several years and deeply understands the factors that affect the price of cryptocurrencies. His expertise lies in his ability to use both technical and fundamental analysis to make informed predictions about the future direction of cryptocurrency prices. He has a strong understanding of market sentiment and uses this to inform his trading decisions and price predictions.\n\nEthereum (ETH) price experienced one of its best performing days on Thursday as Bitcoin (BTC) price teased $38k for the first time since the crypto capitulation induced by Terra Luna UST implosion. As of Friday during the early Asian market, Ethereum price has been hovering around $2,120, after an impressive 10 percent rally in the past 24 hours. Consequently, Ethereum investors have seen their portfolios grow by about 65 percent year-to-date (YTD).\n\nEthereum ETF at the Horizon\n\nAmid the heightened altcoin speculations in the past few weeks, the recent Ethereum rally was triggered by the revelation that $9 trillion asset manager blackrock blackrock Fintech SolutionAdvisoryInvestment platform filed to offer an Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF). It is worth noting that BlackRock CEO Larry Fink had previously stated he is bullish on crypto as investors flee to quality smart products. The diversification into Ethereum indicates rising demand for the leading intelligent contracts and DeFi ecosystem that will unlock more investments from traditional fund managers, including retirement accounts, in the coming years.\n\nRising Network Sentiments\n\n\ud83d\udcc8 #Ethereum's market value has jumped +38% in 4 weeks, powered by high network growth. Particularly micro addresses (<0.1 $ETH), which recently surpassed over 100K wallets for the first time.

Specifically, Ether\u2019s micro addresses holding less than 0.1 ETH reached an all-time high (ATH) of around 103k wallets. Similarly, Ethereum addresses holding between 0.1 and 10 ETH jumped by about 12.5k in the past two weeks. As for whale addresses, the Ethereum network added two more large investors with more than 10k ETH balances in their accounts."

        "title": "Ethereum Price Prediction: Reasons Why ETH is Primed to Test $2,000 - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "The Ethereum price is trading with a bullish bias at $1,918 as of 1:30 a.m. EST, up 2% on the day.\n\nETH started a recovery in mid-October, rallying an impressive 27% from $1,522 to today\u2019s intraday high at $1,929. As a result, Ether\u2019s price is up 21% over the last 30 days and trades 60% above its Jan.1 opening.\n\nEthereum might maintain the bullish momentum if it clears the barrier at $2,000.\n\nLet\u2019s analyze the price action after the latest recovery and see what factors could lead to a possible price rise above the $2,000 psychological level in the near future.\n\n1. A Significant Support Level\n\nEther\u2019s price started a recovery wave above the $1,600 and $1,800 levels. The buyers tried to pump the price above $1,950, but they were rejected by supplier congestion around the $1,950 area. At the time of writing, the largest altcoin was still trading below $1,950. Bulls were required to flip this level back into support to secure the upside.\n\nETH was trading above an important demand area stretching from $,1850. Buyer congestion around the said support level is likely to provide the tailwinds required to propel Ether\u2019s price above the $1,950 resistance level.\n\nSuch a move would confirm the start of an uptrend that is likely to take the smart contracts token first above the much coveted psychological level at $2,000, and then to the April range high at $2,140.\n\nAbove that, the price of the largest altcoin by market capitalization could rise to confront resistance from the $2,500 level. This would bring the total gains to 30%.\n\nETH/USD Daily Chart\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) was moving upwards within the overbought region suggesting that the bulls were in full control of the price. Moreover, all the major moving averages were positioned below the price price and were facing upwards, adding credence to the bullish outlook.\n\nNote that these trend-following chart overlay indicators had just sent a call to buy Ethereum on the daily chart. This happened on Nov. 8 when the fast-moving 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) crossed above the 200-day EMA \u2013 a golden cross, suggesting that the ETH\u2019s uptrend was strong.\n\n2. IOMAP Metrics\n\nThe daily chart above showed that Ether was trading above a key support zone. Included within this area were the immediate support levels from the $1,900 and $1,850 psychological levels. Further down, bears would be confronted by buying pressure from the $1,800 support floor and the $1,700 area where all the major EMAs lie.\n\nThis was supported by on-chain metrics from IntoTheBlock\u2019s In/Out of the Money Around Price (IOMAP) model, which showed that ETH sat on relatively robust support. For example, the major support level at $1,850 lies close to the $1,857 and $1,915 price range, where approximately 3.64 million ETH were previously bought by roughly 4.82 million addresses.\n\nEthereum IOMAP Chart\n\nAny attempt to push the price below the said level would be met by buying from these investors who may want to increase their profits. The ensuing demand pressure would cause Ether to rise even higher.\n\n3. Increasing Total Value Locked\n\nFurther validating the positive outlook for Ethereum was total value locked (TVL) data that revealed a bullish bias from on-chain investors. An analysis of Ethereum\u2019s TVL data helps understand investor and developer interest in a blockchain or decentralized application (dApp). TVL is similar to bank deposits for decentralized finance (DeFi) projects and may influence the direction the market takes.\n\nTVL On Ethereum\n\nAccording to the chart above, there is clear evidence that the TVL on the Ethereum blockchain has been increasing in tandem with the price. DeFiLlama, an on-chain data and market behavior analytics firm, saw the amount locked on the smart contracts network rise from $19.36 billion when ETH price began rising to the current value of $24.46 billion.\n\nThis increase in TVL is deemed bullish as it signals an increasing demand amongst large on-chain users.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

The funding rate is the highest ever and signals total panic for shorts,\u201d Thielen said in his DeFi Research report today. \u201cThis is nuclear winter for everybody who doubted Ethereum. Market-neutral crypto hedge funds are making a killing with these funding rates. Inflows into crypto hedge funds will be high on the agenda for allocators.\u201d\n\nTrading firm QCP Capital also attributed ether\u2019s outperformance over bitcoin overnight to the BlackRock filing in its latest market report, adding it expects a similar playbook to when the asset management giant applied for a spot bitcoin ETF.\n\nCryptocurrencies traded over $100 billion in volume during the last 24 hours, according to The Block\u2019s price data. Bitcoin BTC +5.91% witnessed $34 billion in trading volume, ether $47 billion and tether $69 billion. Ether rallied to a high of $2,134 overnight and currently trades at $2,098. Bitcoin dropped around 4% from a high of nearly $38,000 yesterday before the BlackRock news, but continues to trade above the $36,000 level at $36,931.\n\nWith ether having lagged behind bitcoin in recent weeks, Thielen argued on Monday that sentiment indicators on the ether/bitcoin ratio indicated that higher beta trades could potentially offer great returns \u2014 adding that the Ethereum ecosystem was showing signs of a resurgence as revenues began to recover from previously low levels, suggesting a potential bottom for ether's price.\n\nThat shift was accompanied by an increase in ether's trading volume and a rise in the perpetual futures funding rate for both bitcoin and ethereum, reflecting growing optimism among traders, Thielen noted at the time.\n\nCME bitcoin futures open interest overtakes Binance, but spot ETF approval expected to be delayed until January\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nBitcoin futures open interest on the CME has also overtaken Binance for the first time \u2014 a sign that institutions are getting increasingly serious about the space, according to QCP\u2019s analysts.\n\nThere has been a flurry of activity across trading venues as participants continue to bet on Securities and Exchange Commission approval for spot bitcoin ETFs, QCP wrote, compounded by a fear of missing out starting to kick in.\n\n\u201cWhile we expect the approval for a spot bitcoin ETF to be delayed until Jan. 2024, a new narrative surrounding a spot ether ETF should be enough fuel for animal spirits to take hold once again with crypto prices steadily grinding higher towards the end of the year,\u201d QCP added, arguing that macro developments were also supportive of risk assets.\n\nHowever, \u201ccaution is still warranted as we are at crucial resistance levels, and bitcoin is printing a triple bear divergence with the RSI which has been a reliable signal for momentum stalling,\u201d QCP warned.\n\n\u201cSome people still appear skeptical about approving a spot bitcoin ETF, but based on our calculations, the probability is 86%, with the market pricing signaling that the approval is coming soon,\u201d Thielen wrote in his report.\n\n\u201cBut most people don\u2019t realize that once the ETF is approved, there will be several weeks before it starts trading, and this window will only see buyers front running the launch. This could be the biggest squeeze,\u201d Thielen added, reiterating his estimation that a BlackRock spot bitcoin ETF could lead to a 48% surge in price."

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) bulls are setting their sights on $3,000 for the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization as positive momentum continues to build.\n\nAccording to analyst Jacob Canfield, Ethereum could rally over 50% to hit $3,000 within the next few weeks if bulls can firmly break through resistance at $2,100.\n\nKeypoints\n\nTop trader Jacob Canfield believes ETH could reach $3,000 within the next few weeks, but it needs to break past resistance at $2,100 first. ETH hit $2,132 recently, its highest since the May 2022 crash.\n\nETH is up over 33% in the past month on Ethereum ETF prospects and overall crypto market optimism. Over $80 million in shorts were liquidated in the past day.\n\nThe ETH rally has boosted related crypto sectors like DeFi, with total DeFi market cap topping $60 billion again. Ethereum L2 TVL also hit an all-time high above $13.6 billion.\n\nOn-chain analysis shows ETH has little major resistance until $2,500 based on investor cost bases. Most ETH holders are now in profit below current prices.\n\nHistorically, some profit-taking is common around these levels which can lead to pullbacks. But this is unlikely to impact ETH\u2019s long-term trajectory.\n\nThe ETH rally so far has occurred without much involvement from mega ETH whales holding over 10,000 ETH.\n\nETH has already gained over 33% in the past month alone, fueled by a confluence of bullish factors including optimism around a potential Ethereum ETF approval and improving sentiment across the broader crypto sector.\n\nThis week, ETH tagged the crucial $2,100 resistance level before surging to highs around $2,132 \u2013 its best level since the devastating market crash in May 2022 induced by Terra\u2019s collapse.\n\nNow, analysts say Ethereum has space to continue running if $2,100 flips to support. This would open the door to a test of $2,500 as the next major hurdle based on on-chain investor distribution metrics. According to data from IntoTheBlock, Ethereum currently has very little resistance from investors that bought around current levels. This suggests limited selling pressure exists between the price now and $2,500.\n\nThere we go. Testing the $2100 resistance zone now. $3k is probably target over the next few weeks https://t.co/IHBYXXQ4sA pic.twitter.com/0glULRTnkb \u2014 Jacob Canfield (@JacobCanfield) November 9, 2023\n\nAdditionally, around 75% of ETH holders are now in profit, reducing risks of a mass capitulation. However, some minor pullbacks due to profit-taking at these highs are still likely according to analysts. Historically, assets often consolidate or retrace slightly after such a strong runup before continuing their uptrend.\n\nWhile the mega ETH whales holding over 10,000 tokens have not participated much in the latest advance, Ethereum\u2019s gains have provided a lift to related sectors like decentralized finance (DeFi).\n\nTotal value locked across Ethereum Layer 2 scaling solutions has hit all-time highs above $13.6 billion as ETH demand drives usage of L2 platforms. The combined market cap of DeFi tokens has also surged back above $60 billion.\n\nIf the bulls can maintain their momentum and finally overcome the pivotal $2,100 resistance zone, Ethereum\u2019s path to $3,000 will look increasingly viable over the coming weeks. The on-chain data remains supportive of further gains as long as ETH holds above $2,100.\n\nHowever, as with any rapid rally, the asset remains vulnerable to bouts of volatility and potential profit-taking tests. Traders may want to closely watch how ETH handles the $2,100 level as the next major signal of where the trend is headed."

The report covers allocations to products like Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin Trust (CBTC) and Bitwise\u2019s 10 Crypto Index Fund (BITW).\n\n\u201cThis year is the third largest year on record in terms of just pure inflows,\u201d Butterfill said, noting that CoinShare\u2019s data goes back to 2015. \u201cIt's just a lot of demand, a lot of interest, and I've not experienced this level of interest since 2021.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe industry weathered a steep drop in digital asset prices last year amid the blowup of several high-profile firms. At the time, Bitcoin fell as low as $15,649 and inflows were relatively subdued at just $389 million, Butterfill said. However, he believes the recent deluge of inflows is representative of a change in sentiment among investors, especially institutions.\n\nDigital Assets, as of yesterday, just surpassed US$1bn of inflows this year so far, as sentiment continues to improve. pic.twitter.com/7qJLPnULrD \u2014 James Butterfill (@jbutterfill) November 10, 2023\n\n\u201cWhen you see very large chunks, then you know institutions really are buying,\u201d he said, acknowledging that the source of inflows into investment products like ETFs is typically hard to tell because allocations are anonymous by nature.\n\nAnticipation for a spot Bitcoin ETF on Wall Street has been the main driver of Bitcoin\u2019s recent rally, analysts say. So far, products associated with crypto\u2019s largest coin have seen $1.03 billion in inflows, representing 96% of allocations this year, according to CoinShares.\n\nThere\u2019s less of a stigma associated with moving capital into digital asset investments now than in times past, Butterfill said, when you have \u201csome of the largest asset managers in the world\u201d like Franklin Templeton and BlackRock wading deeper into crypto waters.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOn Thursday, filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and NASDAQ suggested that BlackRock is laying the groundwork for an Ethereum-based ETF, analysts said. Over the past week, crypto\u2019s second-largest coin has increased 16% to around $2,100, according to CoinGecko.\n\nAt the same time, Ethereum turned deflationary again as activity associated with altcoins on the network rose. Since CoinShare\u2019s report on Monday, annual outflows associated with Ethereum have decreased by $30 million, shrinking from $107 million to $77 million.\n\n\u201cInvestors will slowly realize Ethereum is the only asset which is deflationary and offers a yield,\u201d Butterfill said. \u201cIt\u2019s actually quite different than Bitcoin\u2014more like a high-yield tech stock.\u201d\n\nEdited by Stacy Elliott and Andrew Hayward"
