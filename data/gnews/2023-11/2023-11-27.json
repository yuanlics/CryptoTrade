        "content": "Ethereum transaction fees would be five times more expensive if not for layer-2 rollup networks like Optimism and Arbitrum.\n\nThat\u2019s according to a recent report from blockchain infrastructure unit Chainstack. Aside from fees between 360% and 419% higher, transactions themselves would take nearly twice as long on average, Chainstack found.\n\nWait times would even stretch to 114 seconds compared to a block time of about 12 seconds (the minimum wait time if transactions are sent between blocks).\n\nRollups are designed to solve the blockchain trilemma \u2014 a tradeoff layer-1 networks must make between security, scalability and decentralization. Blockchains can only offer two of those elements at any one time, says Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, who popularized the concept laid out in 2016.\n\nEthereum, for example, is built with security and decentralization in mind. But it\u2019s not totally scalable \u2014 transaction fees generally rise alongside user activity and can grow exponentially at times of peak demand.\n\nWith rollups, Ethereum is able to offload some of the pressure. There are two popular rollup solutions today: Optimistic rollups and zero-knowledge (zk) rollups.\n\nOptimistic rollups, such as Arbitrum and Optimism, process transactions off-chain and then post the data of the transaction back onto Ethereum as \u201ccalldata.\u201d ZK rollups, such as Polygon zkEVM and zkSync Era, post all data on-chain but use cryptography to validate whether transactions are accurate without revealing the information itself.\n\nUsage of rollups has grown considerably over the past two years, with Arbitrium and Optimism often together handling more daily transactions than Ethereum mainnet.\n\n\u201c\u2026 it\u2019s clear how roll-up transactions have gone from representing a minor fraction of the network\u2019s activity in 2021 to playing a vital part in Ethereum\u2019s functioning by 2023,\u201d Chainstack wrote.\n\nThe report added that the growing number of transactions illustrated the crucial functioning of rollups to Ethereum\u2019s overall network efficiency.\n\nAlthough, Ethereum gas fees (currently about $1 on average) have seen a constant uptrend between 2021 and 2023 despite the popularity of rollups. But Chainstack reasoned that L2 networks have still served as a necessary and useful counterbalance.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

Today's chart of the day shows that defi activity might be picking up. That's according to a recent report by Blockchain Analytics firm. Ko. This chart shows the average gas fees on Ethereum hitting their highest levels in six months earlier in November as activity on the network increased. The Analytics platform says gas usage has been led by Unis swap where meet tokens like rock and surging tokens like RLB and link have registered significant volumes. Ko added that trading bots like banana gun which allow users to trade tokens with a relatively user friendly interface on the messaging platform has also consumed significant amounts of gas.

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nETH has underperformed compared to the general market.\n\nIt\u2019s still on a lower high compared to April\u2019s high.\n\nA reversal is in sight, but this can be bullish in the long run.\n\nThe cryptocurrency market has been surrounded by bullish sentiment from the start of the year, and we saw triple-digit growth all across the space. Bitcoin paved the way, and many altcoins followed, later surpassing it, especially recently from September, making explosive and parabolic rises.\n\nMeanwhile, the price of the largest altcoin \u2013 Ethereum, has been underperforming compared to many cryptocurrencies. It, too, saw a price appreciation but only 84% since the start of the year. Unlike many that have made new yearly highs, it stayed within its previous, completed in April of $2,150, and now, in November, it came just shy of it.\n\nFrom November 9, when it came to $2,124, we saw a choppy price action lasting 18 days. As the price struggles at these levels, is this an indication of a looming reversal?\n\nETH Price Analysis\n\nThe price of Ethereum fell to $920 on June 18 last year. This was the completion of the downtrend from the all-time high of $4,852, resulting in 82% depreciation. A recovery started as it did across the whole cryptocurrency market, but unlike many cryptocurrencies, the price of ETH didn\u2019t make a lower low.\n\nInstead, it was on a continuous incline, initially coming to $2,000 on August 14 and later making a slightly higher high to around $2,150 on April 16, 2023. Its support level was ascending; the horizontal resistance around $2,100 formed an ascending flat triangle.\n\nThe last rise from October 11 was made from this ascending support at $1,530, but the price still found resistance at the same horizontal area instead of making another higher high. The flat zone proved to be strong, but if this whole ascending triangle structure was the starting formation of the larger bull phase, can we see a breakout to the upside?\n\nETH Price Prediction\n\nLooking at the wave structure, there is a possibility that the whole ascending triangle is the starting impulse wave from the next bull phase for Ethereum\u2019s price. This is known as the leading diagonal pattern in the Elliott Wave theory.\n\nIf this count is correct, the price increase ended for now on the last interaction with the horizontal resistance around the $2,100 area. In that case, we are ready to see a first bull market correction that will establish the first macro higher low.\n\nMeasuring with the Fibonacci retracement tool at its optimal level, we have a price target of $1,380. This corresponds to the horizontal support area, but the price can fall even further until this possibility is invalidated.\n\nAll in all, the price of Ethereum has most likely ended its last uptrend from mid-October and will now make a reversal. If this turns out to be the correction we are expecting, it would mark the completion of the first two bullish waves and indicate the start of a larger uptrend at the beginning of 2024.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nPlease note that the contents of this article are not financial or investing advice.

        "title": "Ethereum price falls as regulatory worries and pause in DApp use impact investor sentiment - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Ether (ETH) is struggling to maintain the $2,000 support as of Nov. 27, following its third unsuccessful attempt in 15 days to surpass the $2,100 mark. This downturn in Ether\u2019s performance comes as the broader cryptocurrency market sentiment deteriorates.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that recent developments, such as the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) signaling potential severe repercussions for Binance founder Changpeng \u201cCZ\u201d Zhao, have contributed to the negative outlook.\n\nIn a filing on Nov. 22 to a Seattle federal court, U.S. prosecutors sought a review and reversal of a judge\u2019s decision permitting CZ to return to the United Arab Emirates on a $175 million bond. The DOJ argues that Zhao poses an \u201cunacceptable risk of flight and nonappearance\u201d if allowed to leave the U.S. pending sentencing.\n\nEthereum DApps and DeFi face new challenges\n\nThe recent $46 million KyberSwap exploit on Nov. 23 has further dampened demand for decentralized finance (DeFi) applications on Ethereum. Despite being previously audited by security experts, including a couple in 2023, the incident has heightened concerns about the safety of the overall DeFi industry. Fortunately for investors, the attacker expressed willingness to return some of the funds, yet the event underscored the sector\u2019s vulnerabilities.\n\nAdditionally, investor confidence was shaken by a Nov. 21 blog post from Tether, the firm behind the Tether (USDT) stablecoin. The post announced the U.S. Secret Service\u2019s recent integration into its platform and hinted at forthcoming involvement from the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\n\nThe lack of details in the announcement has led to speculation about an increasingly stringent regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies, especially with Binance facing heightened scrutiny and Tether\u2019s closer collaboration with authorities. These factors are likely contributing to Ether\u2019s underperformance, with various on-chain and market indicators suggesting a decline in ETH demand.\n\nInvestors become cautious as ETH on-chain data reflects weakness\n\nEther exchange-traded products (ETPs) saw only $34 million of inflows in the last week, according to CoinShares. This figure is a modest 10% of the inflow seen by equivalent Bitcoin (BTC) crypto funds during the same period. The competition between the two assets for spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) approval in the U.S. makes this disparity particularly noteworthy.\n\nMoreover, the current seven-day average annualized yield of 4.2% on Ethereum staking is less appealing than the 5.25% return offered by traditional fixed-income assets. This disparity led to significant outflows of $349 million from Ethereum staking in the previous week, as reported by StakingRewards.\n\nHigh transaction costs continue to be challenging, with the seven-day average transaction fee at $7.40. This expense has adversely affected the demand for decentralized applications (DApps), leading to a 21.8% decline in DApps volume on the network in the last week, as per DappRadar.\n\nTop Ethereum Dapps by volume. Source: DappRadar\n\nNotably, while most Ethereum DeFi applications saw a significant drop in activity, competing chains like BNB Chain and Solana experienced an 11% increase and stable activity, respectively.\n\nRelated: Changpeng Zhao may not leave the US pending court review, says judge\n\nConsequently, Ethereum network protocol fees have decreased for four consecutive days, amounting to $5.4 million on Nov. 26, compared to a daily average of $10 million between Nov. 20 and Nov. 23, as reported by DefiLlama. This trend could potentially create a negative spiral, driving users toward competing chains in search of better yields.\n\nEther\u2019s current price pullback on Nov. 27 reflects growing concerns over regulatory challenges and the potential impact of exploits and sanctions on stablecoins used in DeFi applications.\n\nThe increasing involvement of the DOJ and FBI with Tether elevates the systemic risk for liquidity pools and the entire oracle-based pricing mechanism. While there\u2019s no immediate cause for panic selling or fears of a drop to $1,800, the lackluster demand from institutional investors, as indicated by ETP flows, is certainly not a positive sign for the market.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

        "content": "Institutional investors are buying a lot of ETH-related trusts.\n\nETH 2.0 seemed to have convinced these players of the project\u2019s long-term potential.\n\nFunds flowing into Ethereum [ETH] trusts and ETFs have been increasing since the 23rd of November, according to data observed by AMBCrypto. At press time, the Ethereum Funds Holdings, provided by CryptoQuant, had increased to 3.17 million.\n\nThe increase in metric is a testament to the increasing demand by institutions for investments linked to the altcoin.\n\nBig players love the ETH play\n\nWoominkyu, a verified author on CryptoQuant Woominkyu also corroborated AMBCrypto\u2019s examination of the market sentiment.\n\nHowever, Woominkyu went deep by looking at the effect of the inflow on ETH\u2019s price action. The analyst, after checking the impact, noted that:\n\n\u201cThis surge, occurring as Ethereum\u2019s price stabilizes between 1.8K and 1.9K USD, signals a growing interest from institutional investors. It reflects their strong belief in Ethereum\u2019s long-term value and the market\u2019s potential for growth.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, the long-term bullish sentiment could also be linked to the optimism around a potential spot ETF approval. But besides that, there were other reasons. In fact, some were linked to the changes the blockchain made over the last year.\n\nTop of the list is Ethereum\u2019s transition to Proof-of-Stake (PoS), popularly called the Merge. Consensys, in a blog post last year, envisioned the possible impact of the Merge on institutional inflow.\n\nOne of these includes improved security, meaning that institutional investors now have more confidence in the protocols\u2019 ability to secure their funds.\n\nAnother factor talked about is the deflationary supply. The deflationary supply reduces the rise of seeing ETH go to zero. With respect to this, the Ethereum-powered software company mentioned:\n\n\u201cFor institutions, ETH may become a more attractive asset, as reduced supply may lead to an increase in value.\u201d\n\nBelief is back\n\nThe Shapella upgrade, activated in April, also contributed to the faith these large investors have in Ethereum. The Total Value Locked (TVL) of Ethereum also aligned with the notion that more participants now trust the blockchain compared to 2022.\n\nAt press time, Ethereum\u2019s TVL was $26.02 billion.\n\nThe TVL value mentioned represented a 19.31% increase in the last 30 days. Should the metric continue to increase, then both retail and institutions will look towards buying the coin for potential long-term gains.\n\nA close look at the Long-Term Holder Net Unrealized Profit and Loss (LTH-NUPL) showed that the market mood has moved from hope (orange) to optimism (yellow). The LTH-NUPL serves as an indicator to assess the behavior of long-term holders.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-2024\n\nSo, this movement means holders of the altcoin are no longer fearful. Rather, most now have the belief that ETH has great future potential.\n\nIf the ETH price moves past $2,000 in the coming weeks, then the LTH-NUPL will switch to the belief stage. At this point, a lot of accumulation may occur that could send ETH into an extended rally."

        "content": "In an exclusive interview with Fortune, Vitalik Buterin, the brains behind Ethereum, shares his thoughts on everything from blockchain technology to AI to the people who most inspire him.\n\nHe also discusses what\u2019s happened since Ethereum\u2019s transition from proof of work to proof of stake and how spending time in Antarctica could help prepare humans\u2014maybe even him?\u2014for interplanetary travel.\n\n(This interview has been edited for length and clarity.)\n\nWhat use cases for blockchain excite you the most?\n\nThere are a few different categories of blockchain applications that I think can be valuable, and I wrote about some of these in a blog post last year, but a summary would be: One, currency applications are valuable, especially in the developing world. And two, identity, reputation, and decentralized social applications are exciting due to their potential network effects and enhanced security.\n\nGoing into the specifics of one application, I\u2019ve been using Farcaster a lot recently. There\u2019s a lot of interest in creating alternative stuff to Twitter now\u2014lots of people are either unhappy with various things that Elon does or people just realize that this is a monopoly and we need alternatives.\n\nSome of these have been on-chain. For example, my Farcaster account is connected to an Ethereum address, and if I lose my Farcaster key, I can use my Ethereum address to recover it. This is actually more secure than what centralized social media do, where they rely on phone numbers that can be hacked.\n\nOne of the big challenges in social media is how you tell who is a human and who is a bot. There\u2019s just lots of incentives for malicious actors to just create 50,000 bots. The nice thing about Ethereum is that it already has this lively on-chain ecosystem where there are different ways of doing that.\n\nOne is you can verify just the existence of activity on an Ethereum account. To have activity, you need to pay transaction fees, so there\u2019s a cost. You can make a few hundred fake accounts if you can pay a cost, but you can\u2019t make a million of them.\n\nSecond, you can look at POAPs [proof-of-attendance protocols] that verify that you participated in various in-person or online events.\n\nThird, there are proof-of-personhood protocols, and there is proof of humanity like Worldcoin. There\u2019s a Gitcoin passport that aggregates a lot of those. The ideal goal here is to do this in a way that lets people prove that they are people and not bots, but is also compatible with the goal of preserving people\u2019s privacy.\n\nLast year, you experienced the milestone of transitioning Ethereum from proof of work to proof of stake. What are you focused on now, and then what\u2019s next?\n\nAccount abstraction is definitely a big and important one. Another thing is obviously scalability. We have EIP-4844, also known as Proto-Danksharding, which is coming out very soon, which basically adds more data space on the blockchain\u2014not transactions, but just blobs of data. The purpose of this is to enable greater scalability, specifically for layer-2 projects, our rollups.\n\nThen after EIP-4844 there is a longer-term road map of increasing that amount of space over time and then ongoing improvements to proof of stake in identifying ways that we can improve decentralization even further.\n\nWe talked a year ago about AI, the intersection of AI and blockchain, before the release of ChatGPT and all the hype around that. What are your current views on the AI industry?\n\nAI is obviously super important. It\u2019s the sort of thing that\u2019s hard to think about because it\u2019s so hard to predict where it might go in the future. It\u2019s massive gains in productivity, but also massive philosophical consequences just in terms of what the role of humans in this new world is going to be. The world that is controlled by AI has completely different goals from us in a way that\u2019s difficult to detect at first\u2014that could also lead to very bad things happening.\n\nIn terms of the intersection between AI and crypto, this is one of those things where people have tried really hard to find an answer. Unfortunately, part of the answer is just that the intersection is less than it seems. There are a few things like ZK ML [zero-knowledge machine learning], but it\u2019s realistically a pretty small area.\n\nThere is the fact that AI\u2019s rapid growth makes it much more important to solve certain problems, like proof of personhood, for example. Then there\u2019s obviously the possibility of just crypto tokens being used by AIs. There is the possibility of crypto-based DAOs governing AIs and the process of training AIs.\n\nHave you read any books in the last year that have inspired you?\n\nIn the last year, I have definitely done less books and more reading blogs and things on the internet, things like podcasts and even science fiction. Maybe 10 years ago I read a lot of Austrian economics literature and things like Human Action: A Treatise on Economics, but also things like The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress, a novel by Robert A. Heinlein about a society that creates a civilization on the moon and tries to gain independence.\n\nMuch more recently, I watched some of The Three-Body Problem\u2014I read part of the novel and I also watched part of the TV series, and I was fascinated by that because it presents its world view in a way that is totally different from things that we\u2019re used to. There are aspects to the world view that I disagree with. There\u2019s always this mentality that the world is super dangerous and basically the five big countries have to get together and figure things out, and no one else gets a seat at the table.\n\nThat\u2019s not the kind of world that I want, and not the kind of mentality that I want to see get bigger. But there is this aspect of appreciating the vastness of the universe and how lucky humanity is to have been born\u2014and how significant and how small we are at the same time.\n\nAre there people you admire, who inspire you?\n\nA lot of people. Akira Fuyuno has a blog called Samurai Novelist. It\u2019s not a book, but his posts are so long, they\u2019re basically like the equivalent of reading 10 books. He just does a very good job of making really important philosophical concepts understandable and talking about just all kinds of things in science and politics in deep ways. Other people have told me that my writing style is inspired by his.\n\nI kind of have to say Volodymyr Zelensky. I appreciate his soft-power leadership and his ability to be a figure who rallies and inspires people in that way\u2014like, not just giving out the orders, but just being the face and rallying people behind the cause.\n\nThen there are Eliezer Yudkowsky and Scott Alexander\u2014the two of them are kind of similar characters in a lot of ways. Also, within the Ethereum community, Justin Drake, Dankrad Feist, and Aya Miyaguchi, the foundation\u2019s executive director, who\u2019s really pushed the philosophy of subtraction\u2014different people who have stepped up and made a piece of Ethereum their own and put their souls into making that piece as great as possible.\n\nYou\u2019ve also mentioned Steve Wozniak. Can you tell us more about meeting him? And maybe a few other people who\u2019ve impressed you?\n\nSteve Wozniak, he was just a genuinely fascinating guy who had really interesting hobbies and a lot of cool things that he was able to tell me about.\n\nFrom the government, Audrey Tang, Taiwan\u2019s digital minister, she had all kinds of interesting ideas of her own. She has her own history of being involved in Taiwan\u2019s democracy movement and then g0v [gov zero], which is trying to create a more democratic e-government infrastructure in Taiwan.\n\nThe likely new prime minister of Montenegro, Milojko Spaji\u0107, a.k.a. Mickey, I\u2019ve met him and I\u2019m also impressed by him. From what I can tell, it\u2019s his dedication to making the country better and also just being a curious person who was willing to talk to me and willing to learn things about crypto.\n\nDo you use ChatGPT or any other AI tools?\n\nI\u2019ve used ChatGPT. I\u2019ve also used the Stability AI chat. I use that for a few things. One is asking specific questions that I want answers for; another one is for writing code. I find that the thing that ChatGPT is best at is writing code that uses APIs or libraries or tools that you did not really know about. It even sometimes can take natural language tasks and convert them.\n\nAlso, for a translation, ChatGPT often does better than even Google Translate for helping to learn languages. If I want to understand the grammar behind a particular sentence, it does a really good job of doing that. The things that it\u2019s less good at are basically things where there aren\u2019t many millions of examples to learn from.\n\nI use either Stable Diffusion or the various other AI drawing things to draw images. I use those images and things in, like, my posts and my slides quite a bit. That has been it so far, but I\u2019m sure as AI gets better, I\u2019ll use it in other places as well.\n\nIt definitely does increase my productivity by quite a bit.\n\nWhat\u2019s your biggest dream?\n\nThat\u2019s a good question. I feel like I\u2019m not the sort of person to have one dream. I\u2019m the sort of person to have a lot of dreams. I dream of a world where I can be more free and more open, and where the tools that we\u2019re building in the crypto space can be a big part of actually making that happen. I have a dream of humanity as a whole really succeeding and ending disease and becoming a multiple-energy-area civilization.\n\nSpeaking of civilization, do you think in the future we can travel between planets? And would you take that ride to space?\n\nI think we\u2019ll absolutely get there. I will not be the first one to go\u2014I might be the hundredth person to go. Before we\u2019re really ready to do space, we need to get better at doing Antarctica first. I think of Antarctica as being the tutorial ground of going into space, because it\u2019s an environment that\u2019s definitely somewhat harsh and you have zero infrastructure, but you still can breathe the air without wearing a helmet. Start with the simpler things. But I would definitely love to actually be a part of that myself at some point over the next few decades."

        "title": "Wake: New Open-Source Tooling on Ethereum to Stop Bugs - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Wake\n\nPrague, Czech Republic, Nov. 28, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Quicktake:\n\n\n\nWake is a Python-based Solidity development and testing framework with built-in vulnerability detectors. It was used in audits by Ackee Blockchain and is now being open-sourced and free to use for everyone.\n\nSecurity experts are on high alert, as history shows that hack risks increase as market activity rises. Open-source tooling like Wake empowers application builders to conduct swift and thorough checks for code vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\nBattlefield-proven audit tooling goes open-source\n\nAckee Blockchain, a team of smart contract auditors and creators of community tools, introduces Wake, a Python-based development and testing framework for Solidity and cross-chain fuzzing with a proven track record of stopping bugs.\n\nWake\u2019s features include a development and testing framework, a fuzzer, vulnerability detectors, and printers.\n\nWake was previously used in smart contract audits performed by Ackee Blockchain for IPOR, Axelar, and Solady and helped the auditors find critical, high, and medium bugs. The firm has announced it will make the tool open-source to contribute to a safer blockchain space.\n\n\n\nSecurity experts on alert as market activity rises\n\nAs DeFi activity rises, hackers see more lucrative targets and grow emboldened. In bull markets, projects often rush to ship product updates, creating a high demand for experienced smart contract auditor services. In the peak of the 2021 bull market, projects were typically quoted three month+ audit wait times by reputable firms. They then face a difficult decision to delay launches amid frenzied \u201cland grabs\u201d or launch with hastily conducted audits, increasing security risks.\n\nAfter a week when crypto funds saw their highest inflows since the 2021 bull market and DeFi volumes rose by approximately 50%, security experts are on higher alert. Wake\u2019s release is timely - it allows application developers to expertly test the smart contracts of DEXs or any protocol that plugs into their service or upon which they are reliant.\n\n\n\nStory continues\n\nDesigned to generate fewer false positives and reduce manual audit time\n\nOn top of being the testing framework, Wake allows users to run static analysis. It has a set of ready-to-use high-precision vulnerability and code quality detectors and ready-to-use printers for extracting and pretty-printing useful information such as smart contract control flow and inheritance graphs.\n\n\u201cA common problem of static analysis tools is a high false-positives ratio requiring extra manual investigation time. Our philosophy is to include only the most precise detectors and reduce all noise that creates extra overhead,\u201d - Josef Gattermayer, CEO and co-founder of Ackee Blockchain.\n\nWake underwent performance testing with other frameworks, namely Hardhat, Brownie, and Ape, on three different development chains \u2013 Anvil, Ganache, and Hardhat. Wake proved to be the fastest Python framework.\n\nThe new release of Wake allows the customization of detectors and printers. It also allows third parties to create and implement their custom printers and detectors. The newest version also introduced Github action for automatically executing detectors in a pipeline. \u201cThe low false-positive rate, fastest industry test execution, and ready-made GitHub action make Wake an ideal candidate for CI/CD integration in every project\u201d - Josef Gattermayer, CEO and co-founder of Ackee Blockchain.\n\nWake powers Tools for Solidity, a popular Visual Studio Code Solidity extension that does syntax highlighting and detections from Wake vulnerability and code quality detectors and provides instant feedback to the developers using the extension access to all references of a symbol across the whole project.\n\n\n\nAbout Wake\n\nWake is a Python-based development and testing framework for Solidity and cross-chain fuzzing with a proven track record of stopping bugs created by Ackee Blockchain, which became possible thanks to a grant Ackee Blockchain received from Coinbase in 2022.\n\nTo learn more, please visit getwake.io.\n\nWebsite | Twitter | Telegram\n\n\n\nAbout Ackee Blockchain\n\nAckee Blockchain is a team of security researchers auditing top-tier protocols: Safe, 1inch, Axelar, LayerZero, Trader Joe, or CoW Protocol.\n\nAckee Blockchain is backed by the largest VC fund focused on blockchain and DeFi in Europe, RockawayX, and received grants from the Ethereum Foundation, Tezos Foundation, Coinbase, and Solana Foundation.\n\nAckee Blockchain\u2019s mission is to build a stronger blockchain community by sharing knowledge: the team runs a free certification course School of Solidity, School of Solana and teaches at the Czech Technical University in Prague. This mission is also fulfilled in initiatives such as the ERC-7512 draft, developing the Wake toolkit, or the open-source fuzzer for Solana.\n\nWebsite | Twitter\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: The information provided in this press release is not a solicitation for investment, or intended as investment advice, financial advice, or trading advice.

        "title": "\u2018Decision Time\u2019 for Ethereum Imminent, Says Crypto Analyst Benjamin Cowen \u2013 Here\u2019s What He Means - The Daily Hodl",
        "content": "A widely followed crypto analyst says that Ethereum (ETH) is fast approaching a major turning point that could see it collapse against Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nIn a new video update, crypto strategist Benjamin Cowen tells his 788,000 YouTube subscribers that the ETH/BTC ratio will reach a \u201cdecision time\u201d as soon as early next week.\n\n\u201cDecision time is soon, in my opinion, for the Ether/Bitcoin ratio. I think that within the next few weeks, it could be as early as next week, but I think within the next few weeks, we should have a major decision on which way the Ether/Bitcoin ratio is going to break.\u201d\n\nCowen lays out what he believes will happen to the ETH/BTC ratio, which is currently sitting at 0.05498 BTC ($2,049) at time of writing.\n\n\u201cMy base view has been that Ethereum\u2019s Bitcoin valuation is ultimately heading to about 0.03 BTC to 0.04 BTC, eventually. And from that level, it can potentially start to go back into an uptrend against Bitcoin. Now again not a popular view, but there\u2019s no denying that it\u2019s been in a downtrend at least since the merge\u2026\n\nI anticipated that this is likely going to drop down even though technically it\u2019s a descending wedge and a lot of descending wedges actually break up to the upside, but I said that it\u2019s more likely to break to the downside because this is where the Bitcoin dominance goes higher, and a lot of the altcoin market just basically systematically bleeds back to Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nCowen goes on to explain why the next few weeks are crucial for the second-largest digital asset by market cap.\n\n\u201cSo why is the next few weeks such a decision time for Ethereum against Bitcoin? Oftentimes [with] Ethereum, there\u2019s this seasonality that can come but it doesn\u2019t tend to occur until like mid-December or early January, where it\u2019ll often gain some ground against Bitcoin, so we\u2019re still a few weeks away from that.\n\nSo my argument is that we\u2019re within a window of weakness for the Ether/Bitcoin pair that could last for the next, let\u2019s call it three to five weeks. A window of weakness doesn\u2019t mean that it can\u2019t climb back up to 0.057 BTC or 0.058 BTC or even higher. I mean if you look at the bull market support band [it is] all the way up at 0.059 BTC, almost 0.06 BTC, so it\u2019s certainly possible that it could climb back up to those levels.\n\nI\u2019m not trying to suggest that it can\u2019t, it certainly could, but the window of weakness I think will be over the next few weeks.\u201d\n\nI\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "title": "Taiko's David Weisiger on revolutionizing Ethereum scalability [Q&A] - TNGlobal - TechNode Global",
        "content": "In this TNGlobal Q&A, Taiko\u2019s Head of Developer Relations, David Weisiger, offers deep insights into innovative approaches to scaling Ethereum via Layer 2 solutions. Weisiger, a seasoned software engineer with a rich history at GameStop working on the NFT marketplace, brings a unique perspective to Taiko\u2019s mission. He elaborates on his decision to join the company, particularly driven its vision of minimal yet highly ambitious scaling of Ethereum. His commitment to contributing to the Ethereum ecosystem is evident in Taiko\u2019s efforts to maintain a \u201cpure Ethereum\u201d approach with their scaling solutions, highlighting their dedication to open-source development and collaboration with the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s PSE team.\n\nThe conversation delves into the technical aspects of Layer 1 and Layer 2 blockchain technologies, clarifying their roles in the Ethereum network. Weisiger explains how Layer 2, particularly in the wake of network congestion and high transaction costs experienced in 2020 and 2021, has emerged as a crucial element in Ethereum\u2019s scalability roadmap, known as \u201cThe Surge.\u201d He discusses the company\u2019s approach to Layer 2 security, embracing multi-proofs and a minimal-change protocol to enhance auditability and reliability. Additionally, Weisiger touches on the broader implications of blockchain technology in the context of the global economy and geopolitical tensions, predicting significant developments in blockchain adoption and Ethereum scaling by 2024.\n\nTell us about your decision to join the Taiko team, and please describe how the company contributes to the ETH ecosystem.\n\nI already knew one of the co-founders from my time at GameStop working on the NFT marketplace as an engineer. Frankly, I joined because of the co-founders I interviewed, and I was sold on the highly ambitious and minimal scaling vision they had for Ethereum. To change as little as possible, and to simply scale Ethereum itself, no other changes\u2013just \u201cpure Ethereum\u201d. Additionally, I wanted to work on technology that would benefit the entire Ethereum ecosystem, from our contributions to the EF\u2019s PSE team to our completely open-source codebase.\n\nWhat is a Layer 1 and 2? And why is Layer 2 becoming more popular in recent years?\n\nEthereum is a Layer 1, it is the original blockchain we come to know as Ethereum which persists data and executes smart contracts. Layer 2 is a way of achieving scalability for Ethereum by representing more computation which happens off-chain into a compressed format, tapping into Ethereum as a permissionless data availability layer. This is because the cost of data storage on Ethereum is really expensive.\n\nL2s may scale the Ethereum L1 capacity by around 1,000 times and lower the transaction cost by a few 100 times. With the network congestion on the Ethereum network in 2020/2021 and high transaction costs during that period of time, it becomes very clear that L2 is the most important Ethereum scaling solution (Layer 2\u2019s has been a central part of the Ethereum roadmap as part of \u201cThe Surge\u201d). The concept of Layer 2 is always changing. We are challenging the traditional notion of what Layer 2 / Layer 3 is in our research and development of booster rollups.\n\nETH security is becoming an increasingly important topic so what has Taiko done to contribute and improve Layer 2?\n\nThere are several dimensions to security for Layer 2. One dimension is the proof system\u2013in this case, we have agreed with Vitalik\u2019s idea of utilizing multi-proofs. This means that we assume there is a bug in one implementation of a proof system so it\u2019s best to rely on multiple systems instead of just one. Additionally, we strive to make a minimal amount of changes in our protocol and client, both to be fully Ethereum-equivalent and also to make it more auditable.\n\nAnother dimension (in the spirit of minimalism) is reducing trust assumptions wherever we can. The first area that comes to mind is the fully permissionless proposing (this is referred to as a \u201cbased rollup\u201d) and fully permissionless proving.\n\nTaiko has contributed to the open-source development of the halo2 circuits along with others (mainly the EF\u2019s PSE team) and also contributes by open-sourcing our entire stack. Developers can use our client, protocol, etc. easily as it\u2019s all available and well-documented on GitHub.\n\nHow do you differentiate Taiko from other L2s?\n\nThe primary difference between Taiko and other L2s is that it is a based rollup, and fully permissionless to participate in. Anyone can propose a block or prove a block on our test net. Additionally, Taiko is Ethereum-equivalent, which means that we do not make any changes whatsoever to the developer environment\u2013put more technically, Taiko fully implements the Ethereum Yellow Paper specifications (on the execution layer). Another difference is our innovative idea of utilizing booster rollups to natively scale Ethereum. Check out our CTO Brecht\u2019s EthResearch post on it!\n\nWhat are some examples of how your company helps its community and partners with its scaling solutions?\n\nWe develop our code totally in the open and also do many discussions and educational sessions publicly as well. We also love chatting with teams in the space that are very related to our protocol such as MEV, re-staking, block building, ZK proving, DAOs, etc. We enjoy participating in discussions about this and offering our insights!\n\nThe best example is definitely our research and development though. We believe we have great scaling ideas for Ethereum that others can use in their rollups or however they see fit.\n\nWhere do you see the broader crypto market going into 2024?\n\n2024 will be a very interesting year. There is a lot of risk in the global economy, and the geopolitical tension adds more uncertainty to it. There are always two sides to a coin, on one side the risk would affect the amount of capital coming into the crypto market, on the flip side blockchain and crypto are created trying to solve this exact problem and there\u2019ll be more use cases and demand for an alternative infrastructure to address the deglobalization. But one thing is sure, for the blockchain world to fulfill its mission and purpose, scaling is a must. And 2024 will be the year when Ethereum scaling becomes a reality and comes to fruition. I believe that no matter how the broader market is going to be, we\u2019ll see major adoption of blockchain technology."

        "title": "Vitalik Buterin's 'Defensive Accelerationism' Fits Squarely Into the Ethos of Ethereum - Unchained - Unchained",
        "content": "In a new essay, Ethereum\u2019s creator splits the difference between \u201cEffective Altruism\u201d and \u201cEffective Accelerationism\u201d with a reiteration of crypto principles of both independence and democracy.\n\nFor a crypto veteran like me, the bull market between 2020 and 2022 was most notable for what was missing: Vitalik Buterin. The thoughtful, unassuming creator and intellectual figurehead of the Ethereum ecosystem was largely pushed out of headlines by bombastic, performative (and fraudulent) caricatures like Do Kwon and Sam Bankman-Fried.\n\nBut with such charlatans and their allies now discredited well beyond crypto circles, Buterin is back in a big way with a lengthy essay he published on Monday entitled \u201cMy techno-optimism.\u201d Though the message is broad, it arrives as a specific response to the recent public rift at OpenAI. That fight was broadly driven by a split between \u201cEffective Altruists,\u201d or EAs \u2013 the group Sam Bankman-Fried allied with and helped fund \u2013 and \u201cEffective Accelerationists,\u201d or (e/acc), a far more free-market oriented faction that includes people like Marc Andreessen.\n\nIn the recent OpenAI leadership fight, the EAs seemingly took the role of techno-pessimists, trying to slow the spread of AI tools, while the \u201ce/acc\u201d faction backed Sam Altman\u2019s focus on growth. But Buterin sees both sides as having \u201cfar too many plans to save the world that involve giving a small group of people extreme and opaque power and hoping that they use it wisely.\u201d As I\u2019ve written elsewhere, the two factions are branches of the same underlying Silicon Valley ideology, and both have deep conceptual flaws that ultimately sum out to authoritarianism.\n\nButerin\u2019s response appears in many ways far more nuanced than the positions he is reacting to. He calls it \u201cd/acc,\u201d or \u201cdefensive accelerationism.\u201d\n\nWhat is Defensive Accelerationism?\n\nButerin\u2019s counterpoint leans most of all on decentralization and democratic decision-making in the management of human progress. Buterin says that \u201cThe \u2018d\u2019 stands for \u2018defensive acceleration,\u2019 or perhaps decentralized, or differential acceleration.\u201d It could just as easily, based on Buterin\u2019s ideas, stand for \u201cdemocratic accelerationism.\u201d\n\nVitalik argues that those various Ds are linked. A society that develops in a \u201cdefensive\u201d way is a more just and fair one, because its decentralization discourages attacking others, in turn leaving democracy free to flourish \u2013 at the local or small-group level specifically. He uses the example of Switzerland, whose mountainous terrain historically helped it maintain a more horizontal and localized system of political power, since the various sub-national polities can\u2019t easily attack each other, or be attacked.\n\nIn more contemporary technological terms, Buterin specifically emphasizes privacy and autonomy, as well as cybersecurity and \u201cinfosecurity\u201d as key principles of development on \u201cd/acc\u201d lines. He fully endorses \u201ca security-focused open-source movement, rather than closed and proprietary corporations and venture capital funds.\u201d This seems a specific knock on the EAs, who have been resistant to making AI tech more accessible.\n\nOn a related note, Buterin seems viscerally repulsed by the \u201centhusiasm for military technology\u201d among the effective accelerationist crowd. On this point, he accuses the e/accs of making the same egotistical mistake as the EAs: Supporting the advancement of military tech, Buterin writes, requires \u201cbelieving that the dominant technological power will reliably be one of the good guys in most conflicts, now and in the future.\u201d\n\nThe essay also explores other important topics, like pandemic preparedness, and lays out decentralized approaches. At a very high level, Buterin praises systems like prediction markets and X/Twitter\u2019s \u201ccommunity notes\u201d feature, specifically because they\u2019re structured to usefully integrate feedback from any member of the public. No surprise, Buterin also emphasizes the value of blockchains and cryptocurrency in his notion of digital \u201cdefensive infrastructure,\u201d for instance for their ability to prevent centralized \u201cchokepoints\u201d for data.\n\nButerin\u2019s \u201cD\u201d does not, crucially, stand for \u201cdeceleration.\u201d He opens the essay with a strong argument for technological progress as a boon to human well-being, and explicitly connects that to the beneficial potential of artificial intelligence. And though he also accepts the risk of superintelligence dominating human life, he thankfully gives short shrift to the sci-fi fantasies of destructive AI that seem to haunt the Effective Altruists and their \u201cAI Doomer\u201d allies. He\u2019s far more concerned with the realistic, here-and-now threat of AI turning humans into passive \u201cpets,\u201d simply because the AIs will make objectively better decisions.\n\nA \u2018Subspecies of e/acc\u2019\n\nBut even given such risks, Buterin rejects the idea that any small group \u2013 like the OpenAI board \u2013 should control technological progress. Notably, this echoes close to a decade of Buterin\u2019s own proactive efforts to reduce his own power over Ethereum. He rightly identifies reliance on central authority as an implicit element of contemporary Effective Altruism, and generally he seems to have the least affection for that set of ideas.\n\nButerin is more clearly allied with the \u201ceffective accelerationists,\u201d and calls d/acc \u201ca subspecies of e/acc \u2013 just one that is much more selective and intentional.\u201d But he rightly pushes back against their most extremist tendency, too \u2013 their belief that unstructured \u201cfree markets\u201d in themselves lead to human progress. Buterin\u2019s objections here include the uncontroversial fact that \u201cmany markets have proven to be natural monopolies.\u201d Following the e/acc free-market doctrine, he writes, seems likely to lead to a monopoly on artificial intelligence specifically, with disastrous implications for human freedom and flourishing.\n\nThere\u2019s much more breadth and subtlety to Buterin\u2019s dense disquisition \u2013 for instance, he includes transhumanist ideas like brain-computer interfaces in his idea of \u201cdefensive\u201d technological development. But it\u2019s not hard to see \u201cd/acc\u201d as a rebranding of the left-wing libertarianism that has come to define the political ethos of the Ethereum community. Buterin\u2019s pitch also reflects the same basic optimism and openness that defines the actually-existing Ethereum community today.\n\n\u201cI believe humanity is deeply good,\u201d Vitalik writes in closing. \u201cYes, human beings are often mean, but we much more often show kindness and mercy, and work together for our common benefit.\u201d\n\n\u201cTwo billion years from now, if the Earth or any part of the universe still bears the beauty of Earthly life, it will be human artifices like space travel and geoengineering that will have made it happen,\u201d Buterin continues.\n\n\u201cWe need to build, and accelerate.\u201d"

        "content": "The introduction of Ethereum Foundation\u2019s ERC-4337 account abstraction standard earlier this year drew much attention, but adoption and retention are off to a slow start.\n\nExisting hardware wallets rely on a pair of keys. If those keys are compromised, so are tokens in the wallet. The ERC-4337 standard was instead intended as a new baseline for how users interact with crypto wallets services, including social recovery mechanisms and other multisig options.\n\nThe standard turns Ethereum accounts into \u201csmart accounts,\u201d which are much more flexible to suit the needs of wallet holders.\n\nAccording to data on BundleBear:\n\nWeekly retention for ERC-4337 smart wallets drops as low as 1% for accounts older than five weeks.\n\nAn average smart account only sends five user operations.\n\nRevenue for transaction \u201cbundlers\u201d is also low, currently less than $8,000 per week.\n\nRead more: What Are Smart Contract Wallets? A Beginner\u2019s Guide\n\nAt the time of writing, daily active users are at around 3%, sixdegree data shows. Most smart account users today are on the Polygon network, making up over 66% of all smart account holders and almost all monthly new users by chain.\n\nDespite the low adoption rates on Ethereum, industry participants remain optimistic about the future of smart accounts and have been actively working on proposals to spur usage.\n\nJohn Rising, the co-founder of Stackup, an account abstraction infrastructure company, notes that many existing issues with ERC-4337 can be resolved with the first-ever Rollup Improvement Proposal, RIP-7560.\n\nThe existing ERC-4337 standard is considered a \u201csemi-native+\u201d smart account, where a user does not need a private key because the trustless relay network is designed to forward transactions to the blockchain.\n\nRising believes that the goal is to move towards a \u201cnative\u201d smart account, where accounts would be able to specify their own validation logic, completely removing the need for a private key \u2014 something that RIP-7560 hopes to do.\n\n\u201cERC-4337 has always been intended as a stepping stone to native account abstraction. The account abstraction proposal, RIP-7560, is designed to be backwards compatible with ERC-4337,\u201d Rising told Blockworks.\n\nFurther discussions around the proposal and its applicability must still be considered. Native account abstraction has drawn concerns over the complexity it adds, as it introduces consensus layer changes rather than just high-level infrastructure layer modifications.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

ETH is showing a few bearish signs and might decline toward the $1,920 support zone.\n\nEthereum is slowly moving lower below the $2,060 zone.\n\nThe price is trading below $2,060 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere is a major bearish trend line forming with resistance near $2,040 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair could continue to move down toward the $1,920 support zone.\n\nEthereum Price Extends Decline\n\nEthereum price started a fresh decline after it struggled near $2,130. ETH formed a high at $2,132 and started a downward movement. There was a move below the $2,100 and $2,080 levels, like Bitcoin.\n\nThe price even spiked below the $2,000 support. A low was formed near $1,986 and the price is now consolidating losses. There was a minor recovery wave above the $2,020 level. Ether climbed above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent drop from the $2,132 swing high to the $1,986 low.\n\nEthereum is now trading below $2,060 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $2,040 zone. There is also a major bearish trend line forming with resistance near $2,040 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.\n\nThe first key resistance is near the $2,060 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent drop from the $2,132 swing high to the $1,986 low. The next resistance sits at $2,100. A clear move above the $2,100 level could send the price toward the $2,135 resistance zone.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nThe next resistance is near $2,150, above which the price could aim for a move toward the $2,200 level. Any more gains could start a wave toward the $2,250 level.\n\nMore Losses in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $2,040 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,000 level.\n\nThe next key support is $1,985. A downside break below $1,985 might send Ether toward the $1,920 support.

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nCardano\u2019s Charles Hoskinson has taken aim at Ethereum founder, Vitalik Buterin.\n\nEthereum isn\u2019t giving Cardano enough credit, says Hoskinson.\n\nFans of the rival chains had only just argued about their competing scalability solutions.\n\nThe rivalry between Cardano and Ethereum continues to simmer as Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson took a sarcastic jab at Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin over staking innovations.\n\nIn a recent interview with DeFi news outlet The Defiant, Buterin proposed redesigning Ethereum\u2019s staking system to address centralization issues plaguing the network. The two camps and their supporters have only recently argued about blockchain scaling solutions, and whether Ethereum had copied Cardano\u2019s Hydra.\n\nHoskinson Thinks Cardano Deserves Some Credit\n\nEthereum\u2019s suggested changes involve adopting an unspent transaction output (UTXO) model similar to the one used by Cardano (and Bitcoin) for years. Yet Buterin did not acknowledge Cardano as a source of inspiration.\n\nThis omission did not sit well with Hoskinson, who has consistently championed Cardano\u2019s staking architecture as superior. He posted on X sarcastically: \u201cNo worries, Ethereum 3 will have it all sorted.\u201d His biting remark implies that while Ethereum scrambles to upgrade its staking design, Cardano already has a robust decentralized solution working for years.\n\nHoskinson later clarified that he was not trying to stoke hostilities, but expressed bewilderment that Cardano rarely gets recognition as an innovative ecosystem from Ethereum developers. \u201cI am truly at a loss that Cardano can never be mentioned as an innovative ecosystem over on team E.\u201d\n\n\u201c[Vitalik] is rediscovering what we\u2019ve been working on for almost a decade, and it\u2019s like a new revelation,\u201d he stated on X .\n\nA Longstanding Rivalry\n\nThe rivalry is fueled by both projects\u2019 ambitions to lead the blockchain space as the preeminent smart contract platform. While Ethereum dominates in decentralized finance (DeFi) currently with over $25 billion locked , Cardano has been steadily gaining ground with its focus on scalability, efficiency, and decentralization.\n\nNo worries, Ethereum 3 will have it all sorted! https://t.co/Td0Hm58eic \u2014 Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) November 24, 2023\n\nWhile both Cardano and Ethereum use proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus to achieve greater energy efficiency and scalability, their implementations differ significantly. Cardano\u2019s Ouroboros PoS mechanism has been operational since the network launched in 2017. It utilizes peer-reviewed academic research to provide mathematical security guarantees, rivaling the assurances of Bitcoin\u2019s power-hungry proof-of-work.\n\nIn contrast, Ethereum\u2019s PoS beacon chain only went live in 2020 and its consensus layer merge was just completed in September 2022. Where Ethereum falls short (for many) is decentralization. Cardano engineered Ouroboros deliberately for decentralization, using mechanisms like stake pools that allow smaller players to participate in block production.\n\nThe two giants of crypto have had a long-standing rivalry since working together on Ethereum in its early days. Buterin and Hoskinson were both founders of Ethereum back in 2013 along with several others.\n\nHowever, creative differences soon emerged. Hoskinson left Ethereum in 2014 over disagreements on whether the platform should be a for-profit company. While Buterin envisioned a non-profit open ecosystem. Hoskinson went on to found IOHK and eventually launched Cardano as a competing smart contract platform."

A notable increase in validators exiting the Ethereum staking pool since October has contributed to a slowdown in the growth rate of ETH issuance. This trend correlates with the broader bullish sentiment across digital asset markets.\n\nThe growth rate of the #Ethereum validator set has slowed in recent weeks as an increasing number of validators voluntarily exit, slowing the rate of ETH issuance.\n\n\n\nAlongside increasing ETH burnt via EIP1559 due to growing network activity, the ETH supply has turned\u2026 pic.twitter.com/xMrQRe7opO \u2014 glassnode (@glassnode) November 28, 2023\n\nYou might also like: Spain enforces new crypto tax law for foreign asset declarations\n\nThe decreased validator participation leads to reduced ETH issuance, which, when combined with heightened network activity, results in increased ETH burn via EIP1559\u200b\u200b. Concurrently, a decline in NFT and defi transactions has been observed, with decreases of 3% and 57%, respectively, over the past four months.\n\nIn contrast, token transfers and stablecoins have seen a surge, with gas usage for tokens rising by 8.2% and stablecoin gas usage increasing by 19%. This suggests a shift towards longer-tail assets, reflecting growing market confidence\u200b\u200b.\n\nPost the London hardfork, Ethereum transitioned from a net inflationary state towards equilibrium and then deflation.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nOn Monday, Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin reflected on his own take on \u201ctechno-optimism,\u201d inspired by Marc Andreessen, who opined about AI in his Techno-Optimist Manifesto in October. While Buterin agreed with Andreessen\u2019s positive outlook, Buterin also noted the importance of how AI is developed and the technology's future direction.\n\nButerin acknowledged the existential risk of artificial intelligence, including causing the extinction of the human race.\n\n\u201cThis is an extreme claim: as much harm as the worst-case scenario of climate change, or an artificial pandemic or a nuclear war, might cause, there are many islands of civilization that would remain intact to pick up the pieces,\u201d he said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cBut a superintelligent AI, if it decides to turn against us, may well leave no survivors and end humanity for good,\u201d Buterin said. \u201cEven Mars may not be safe.\u201d\n\nButerin pointed to a 2022 survey by AI Impacts, which said between 5% and 10% of participants believe humans face extinction from AI or from humans' failure to control AI, respectively. He said that a security-focused open-source movement is ideal for leading AI development rather than closed and proprietary corporations and venture capital funds.\n\n\u201cIf we want a future that is both superintelligent and \"human\u2014one where human beings are not just pets, but actually retain meaningful agency over the world\u2014then it feels like something like this is the most natural option,\" he said.\n\nWhat\u2019s needed, Buterin continued, is the active human intention to choose its direction and outcome. \u201cThe formula of 'maximize profit' will not arrive at them automatically,\u201d he said.\n\nButerin said he loves technology because it expands human potential, pointing to the history of innovations from hand tools to smartphones.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI believe that these things are deeply good, and that expanding humanity's reach even further to the planets and stars is deeply good, because I believe humanity is deeply good,\u201d Buterin said.\n\nButerin said that while he believes transformative technology will lead to a brighter future for humanity, he rejects the notion that the world should stay how it is today, only with less greed and more public healthcare.\n\n\u201cThere are certain types of technology that much more reliably make the world better than other types of technology,\u201d Buterin said. \u201cThere are certain types of technology that could, if developed, mitigate the negative impacts of other types of technology.\u201d\n\nButerin cautioned about a rise in digital authoritarianism and surveillance technology used against those who defy or dissent against the government, controlled by a small cabal of technocrats. He said the majority of people would rather see highly advanced AI delayed by a decade rather than be monopolized by a single group.\n\n\u201cMy basic fear is that the same kinds of managerial technologies that allow OpenAI to serve over a hundred million customers with 500 employees will also allow a 500-person political elite, or even a 5-person board, to maintain an iron fist over an entire country,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile Buterin said he is sympathetic to the effective acceleration (also known as \"e/acc\") movement, he has mixed feelings about its enthusiasm for military technology.\n\n\u201cEnthusiasm about modern military technology as a force for good seems to require believing that the dominant technological power will reliably be one of the good guys in most conflicts, now and in the future,\u201d he said, citing the idea that military technology is good because it's being built and controlled by America and America is good.\n\n\u201cDoes being an e/acc require being an America maximalist, betting everything on both the government's present and future morals and the country's future success?\u201d he said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nButerin cautioned against giving \u201cextreme and opaque power\u201d to a small group of people with the hope they will use it wisely, preferring instead a philosophy of \"d/acc\"\u2014or defense, decentralization, democracy, and differential. This mindset, he said, could adapt to effective altruists, libertarians, pluralists, blockchain advocates, and solar and lunar punks.\n\n\u201cA defense-favoring world is a better world, for many reasons,\u201d Buterin said. \u201cFirst of course is the direct benefit of safety: fewer people die, less economic value gets destroyed, less time is wasted on conflict.\n\n\"What is less appreciated though is that a defense-favoring world makes it easier for healthier, more open and more freedom-respecting forms of governance to thrive,\" he concluded.\n\nWhile he emphasized the need to build and accelerate, Buterin said society should regularly ask what we are accelerating towards. Buterin suggested that the 21st century may be \"the pivotal century\" for humanity that could decide the fate of humanity for millennia.\n\n\u201cThese are challenging problems,\u201d Buterin said. \u201cBut I look forward to watching and participating in our species' grand collective effort to find the answers.\u201d\n\nEdited by Ryan Ozawa."

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlockchain sleuth @lookonchain reported that approximately an hour ago it spotted that the Ethereum Foundation had made a large crypto transfer, moving $2 million worth of ETH. This move was also noticed by another DLT tracker, @OnchainDataNerd, which reported it on its X app page.\n\nThis transaction happened right after the ETH price showed a marginal rise, which followed a recent drop of 4.23%. Still, Ethereum continues to hold above the key $2,000 level so far.\n\nEthereum Foundation moves 1,000 ETH\n\nIn its recent X post, Lookonchain stated that 1,000 ETH worth an impressive $2 million was moved by the Ethereum Foundation to a Safe multi-signature wallet \"0x4e6b.\" Safe is a type of wallet based on Ethereum chain.\n\nEarlier this year, according to data shared by @lookonchain, the Ethereum Foundation also transferred several similar lumps of ETH to the same multi-signature wallet \u2013 1,000 ETH nearly three months ago and another 1,000 ETH almost half a year ago. The goal of these transactions remains unclear and has not been commented on by any Ethereum rep so far.\n\nHowever, the ETH community started jumping to conclusions. Today\u2019s ETH transfer sparked a heated discussion under the @lookonchain post as ETH holders became intrigued as to the goal of this large Ethereum transaction.\n\nSome commentators believe the Ethereum team spearheaded by Vitalik Buterin is gradually selling its corporate ETH stash as they sent critiques to the Ethereum Foundation and its frontman, Vitalik. Several people in the comments wondered if the ETH price is going to fall further because of this.\n\nCardano founder criticizes Buterin and ETH staking redesign plan\n\nAs reported by U.Today over the weekend, Buterin recently gave an interview in Turkey, answering questions of the local ETH community. When asked about the road map for Ethereum, Buterin stated that something needs to be done about ETH staking since many users find its mechanism not so easy or convenient to use, pouring a lot of technical details on his audience.\n\nCardano founder Charles Hoskinson (who was also on the team who founded Ethereum together with Buterin) commented on that in a sarcastic tone, stating, \"No worries, Ethereum 3.0 will have it all sorted.\"\n\nEarlier, the Ethereum staking model was heavily criticized by Hoskinson since before the actual launch of updates that comprise Ethereum 2.0 and ensure the blockchain's shift from the proof-of-work to the proof-of-stake consensus algorithm, users were unable to unlock their ETH for several years.\n\nThe Ethereum Merge upgrade that allowed the chain to begin running on proof-of-stake was launched in September last year, and ETH was not allowed to be unstaked until the next upgrade, called Shanghai, at the start of this year.\n\nBack then, several times Hoskinson emphasized on X app that Cardano stakers are allowed to unstake their coins at any time they want, and even in order to stake their ADA, they do not have to move it from their wallets, unlike in the case of Ethereum. The Cardano founder, back then, called this a fundamental difference between the Cardano and Ethereum blockchains."

        "content": "Cryptocurrency traders usually consider price the leading index for past analysis and future projections. However, tokenomics and supply inflation can drastically impact the price of any asset, and crypto investors can use the market cap as a demand index to evaluate these effects.\n\nIn this context, Finbold looked at Ethereum (ETH) tokenomics from a capitalization perspective. Public market data from cryptocurrency indexes can demonstrate the effects of increased supply inflation on Ethereum. We calculated the exact price ETH would trade if it ever hits the all-time high market cap.\n\nAn inflationary supply requires more demand to maintain its value over time. These two factors determine whether a cryptocurrency\u2019s price rises or falls. Ethereum, with its unique tokenomics design, is a prime example of this dynamic.\n\nEthereum had an all-time high market cap of $575.899 billion on November 10, 2021, according to TradingView\u2019s CRYPTOCAP index. Meanwhile, Ether traded for as high as $4,878 on the same day, as registered by Finbold. An inverse calculation suggests a circulating supply of around 118.06 million ETH at that time.\n\nCRYPTOCAP \u2013 ETH daily market capitalization. Source: TradingView\n\nEthereum supply inflation and its economic effects\n\nLet\u2019s explore Ether\u2019s supply inflation and its economic implications. Ethereum has a circulating supply of 118.619 million ETH as of the time of this writing. This results in a supply inflation of 559,000 ETH (0.5%) in two years.\n\nEthereum circulating supply data. Source: CoinMarketCap\n\nEssentially, the burning mechanism implemented in 2021 assisted in controlling the effective inflation caused by new Ethers issuance to reward staking validators.\n\nThe price projection also shows the effects of this tokenomics. In case the leading Web3 blockchain reaches its highest speculative demand of $575.899 billion market cap, ETH would trade at a proportionally lower price than the corresponding all-time high.\n\nConsidering the circulating supply on November 28, Ethereum would be priced at $4,855 per token at its highest capitalization. Interestingly, a loss of $23 (47%) from the previous price of $4,878 in 2021.\n\nHowever, this still indicates a potential 138% increase from the current price of $2,035.\n\nIt is important to understand that the forecast requires the same demand as 2021 for Ethereum. In this context, there are no guarantees that this demand will ever be seen again. On the other hand, it is also possible that a higher demand surges in the following years.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "title": "Ethereum price may lose $2,000 level as ETH becomes deflationary again due to validator exit - FXStreet",
        "content": "Share:\n\nEthereum price, trading at $2,038 on Tuesday, will likely fall below the crucial support level amid waning bullishness.\n\nETH validators, for the first time since Shapella's hard fork, have begun exiting to the tune of 1,018 per day.\n\nETH issuance has also taken a hit and, for the first time since December 2022, has recently had its growth rate decreased by 0.5% per day.\n\nEthereum price has been affected by the Shanghai hardfork since even before it was activated. But since the upgrade, this week marks the first instance when the market is witnessing the fear of unstaking come to life.\n\nEthereum price could take a bearish turn\n\nEthereum price has been hovering around the $2,000 mark since the beginning of the month. Trading at $2,038 at the time of writing, the second-generation cryptocurrency has failed to breach the resistance of $2,124 for the second time this month. While it did manage to break out of the downtrend over the past week, it is still vulnerable to a decline below the $2,000 support level.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a measure of the speed and change of price movement. According to the indicator, there is still room for ETH to bounce back and reinitiate bullish momentum, given it is sitting above the neutral line at 50.0. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator is also exhibiting the dominance of bearish momentum in the market presently, owing to the red bars on the histogram and the lack of a potential bullish crossover.\n\nThus, all the fingers point at a likely downtrend, which might see Ethereum price touching the lows of $1,900 or testing the support at $1,795.\n\nETH/USD 1-day chart\n\nBut if the broader market cues turn bullish and ETH bounces back from $2,000, it could make another attempt at breaching the resistance marked at $2,124. A rise through that level would invalidate the bearish thesis, opening ETH up to tagging $2,200.\n\nEthereum turns deflationary again\n\nThe chance of a bullish turn of events is both likely and unlikely. It's likely because ETH is deflationary once again. An asset being deflationary simply means that it no longer has an infinite supply but that it will reduce over time. This generally is a bullish event since low supply plus high demand equals a rise in price.\n\nBut the reason it could be unlikely in the case of Ethereum is that the conditions under which ETH is turning deflationary are unfavorable. According to blockchain analytics platform Glassnode, daily ETH issuance has experienced a slowdown. Over the last week, the growth rate of ETH issuance has slowed by up to 0.5% per day.\n\nEthereum daily issuance\n\nThis marks the first issuance decrease in nearly 12 months, and the reason behind it is the exit of validators. Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum runs on the Proof of Stake consensus method, which requires node/block validators to stake ETH in order to qualify. Earlier, this staked ETH could not be withdrawn, but that feature was activated after the Shapella upgrade.\n\nSince then, on average, 380 validators have exited on a daily basis. But this figure shot up by 168% in just a month, rising to 1,018 validators.\n\nEthereum validators\n\nConsequently, the staked ETH has also noted a decline. The possibility of the validator exit could be due to one or more of these three possible reasons:\n\nInvestors are opting to change their staking setup, for example, by transferring stakes from CEXs (centralized exchanges) to Liquid Staking Providers (perhaps due to ongoing regulatory concerns).\n\nInvestors with access to US capital markets may be rotating capital toward safer assets, such as US treasuries, as interest rates remain elevated relative to ETH staking returns.\n\nInvestors may also be seeking greater liquidity for held ETH in anticipation of an imminent market uptrend rather than less liquid-staked ETH.\n\nNevertheless, this is not a good sign for Ethereum as the validators are the backbone of the network, and their exit could prove to be rather negative."

        "title": "Ethereum Price Prediction As Elliott Wave Theory Hints Rally to $3400 - CoinGape",
        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction: Amidst the recent downturn in the crypto market, the Ethereum price recovery took a breather after surging to a high of $2,137, experiencing a temporary drop to $1,900. Analyzing the daily chart, it appears this pullback might be part of a 4th wave correction within the Elliott Wave Theory, potentially setting the stage for a forthcoming 5th wave impulse.\n\nAlso Read: This Whale Astonishingly Becomes Largest Depositor On Ethereum L2 Blast Bridge\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum Price Prediction: Will $ETH Surpass $2500?\n\nA rising wedge pattern governs the current recovery trend\n\nA post-correction rally could set the ETH price for 18% surge\n\nThe intraday trading volume in Ether is $10.3 Billion, indicating a 66% gain.\n\nSource- Tradingview\n\nThe Elliott Wave Theory is a method used in technical analysis to predict future price movements by identifying patterns in market cycles.\n\nThe ongoing recovery of the Ethereum coin, kicking off in mid-October, aligns neatly with the Elliott Wave Theory\u2019s framework. The first wave saw the ETH price peak at $1,656, followed by a second wave correction to $1,543.\n\nWith the broader market\u2019s recovery, the altcoin surged in a third wave and reached a 7-month high at $2,137. Furthermore, the ETH price experienced a 4th wave correction in the third week of November, marked by a downward-sloping resistance trendline. This pullback assisted buyers in recuperating the exhausted bullish momentum for the next leap/\n\nOn November 22nd, while major altcoins attempted to recover from recent sell-offs, the Ethereum price notably broke out from the overhead trendline, potentially signaling the initiation of a 5th wave impulse.\n\nUsing the Fibonacci extension tool to project the 5th wave, it could potentially reach around 0.618 or $1.618 times (wave 1 + wave 3) against the wave 4 correction, implying a potential target of $2,380 or $2900 for Ethereum\u2019s price.\n\nIs ETH Poised for Further Correction?\n\nSource- Tradingview\n\nWith an intraday 2% loss, the Ether price currently stands at $2,070. This dip raises questions about whether the price has genuinely entered the fifth wave. However, should the aforementioned bullish thesis hold true, a climb to $2,800 could spark a bullish breakout from a long-standing rising wedge pattern. Such a breakout might indicate a significant trend reversal, potentially strengthening the recovery outlook and aiming for an extended rally toward $3,400.\n\nRelative Strength Index: The formation of a higher low in the Ethereum price despite a lower low drop in RSI suggests a reverse bullish divergence in this momentum indicator. This accentuates sellers\u2019 attempts but highlights the potential neglect of their influence .\n\nExponential Moving Average: The slopes of the 20 and 50-day EMA might provide initial support during intermittent pullbacks in the price"

        "title": "Ethereum Return To $4,800: Analyst Identifies Pattern To Trigger Rally To ATH - NewsBTC",
        "content": "The Ethereum price has been trading more than 50% below its all-time high of $4,800 for the better part of a year now with no sign of returning to its previous all-time high. However, this slow trend may not continue for much longer as a crypto analyst has identified a pattern that could trigger a rally to its previous highs.\n\nEthereum Stuck Inside A Bullish Triangle\n\nIn an analysis that was posted on TradingView, crypto analyst FieryTrading identified a unique pattern that the Ethereum price has been trading in for almost two years. This pattern is a bullish triangle pattern and it has persisted for more than one and a half years.\n\nLooking at the chart, the Ethereum price has not deviated from this bullish triangle and has not had any success breaking out of it. The triangle began toward mid-2022 when the Terra Network collapse triggered a crypto market-wide crash. Then even with multiple major recoveries since then, the altcoin\u2019s price remains inside this triangle.\n\nThe lower end of this bullish triangle is at $887 which is the cycle low, and the upper end has been tracked at just above $2,100. Given this range, it suggests that for Ethereum to break out of this bullish triangle, it would have to clear the $2,200 resistance.\n\nWhat Happens If ETH Breaks Out Of This Pattern?\n\nAs the crypto analyst highlights, a breakout of this pattern would lead to a massive rally. The top of this breakout rally could eventually see the Ethereum price return to its 2021 all-time high levels, reaching above $4,800.\n\nETH price at $2,047 | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\n\u201cIn my eyes, a break out from this pattern might result in big gains for ETH, since it will burst through an area full of short-trade stop-losses which will be forced to buy back their positions,\u201d FieryTrading said. A move to $4,800 would translate to a 130% increase from its current price levels.\n\nHowever, the crypto analyst explains that this could be more of a long-term performance, so it is possible that the cryptocurrency will not complete this move until at least the year 2024. But it paints a good, bullish picture for the altcoin going forward.\n\nOn its own this year, the Ethereum price has performed quite well, especially over the last 30 days. Data from CoinMarketCap shows that ETH\u2019s price has risen 16.53% in one month to break above the $2,000 resistance which has now turned into support.\n\nEthereum remains the second-largest cryptocurrency with a market cap of approximately $250 billion.\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "The increased bullish sentiment has led to an approximately 15% increase in the price of Ether within a 30-day period. The fact that Ethereum is now trading above $2,000 suggests a growing focus on the asset, and this renewed optimism has propelled the year-to-date gain in ETH price to almost 70%.\n\nNew data suggest a surge in institutional holdings in the crypto asset.\n\nSurge in Institutional Ethereum Holdings\n\nAccording to CryptoQuant, there has been a notable uptick in institutional holdings of Ethereum, both through direct ownership and indirect channels such as trusts, ETFs, and funds, in November. This increase coincided with ETH\u2019s price finding stability in the range of $1.8k to $1.9k.\n\nSuch a heightened institutional interest suggests a growing confidence among investors in Ethereum\u2019s long-term value and the promising prospects for market expansion, according to the analysis.\n\n\u201cIt reflects their strong belief in Ethereum\u2019s long-term value and the market\u2019s potential for growth.\u201d\n\nThe latest analysis also suggested that the growing appeal of Ethereum to institutional investors is reinforced by its ongoing technical advancements. The implementation of Ethereum 2.0 upgrades and the enhancement of smart contract functionalities have played a significant role in attracting institutional attention, underscoring the crypto-asset\u2019s attractiveness as a long-term investment opportunity.\n\nEthereum ETF Hype\n\nThe buzz among institutional investors kicked off at the beginning of the month when the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) acknowledged Grayscale Investment\u2019s bid to transform its Ethereum trust into an ETF.\n\nThis SEC action stems from a specific court mandate instructing a review of Grayscale\u2019s pending ETF applications. As of now, there is no official confirmation regarding the approval of a spot cryptocurrency ETF.\n\nMarket optimism surged when BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, formally submitted an application for a spot Ether ETF on November 9. This confirmation led to the Ether price breaking through the $2,000 resistance, marking a six-month high on the same date. BlackRock officially lodged the S-1 form with the SEC on November 16.\n\nExperts predict the SEC will approve a spot Bitcoin ETF in early 2024, and following this, approval for a spot Ether ETF is widely expected to follow quickly, according to various crypto analysts."

        "content": "TL;DR\n\nEthereum (ETH) is showing strong performance, currently trading around $2,000, with predictions of reaching its all-time high of over $4,800.\n\nAnalyst FieryTrading forecasts ETH to reach nearly $5,000 by early 2025, citing a long-term bullish pattern.\n\nThe same analyst predicts a significant rise for Cardano\u2019s ADA, expecting it to exceed $35 by 2025 based on bullish market patterns.\n\n\u2018Big Gains for ETH\u2019 on the Horizon?\n\nEthereum\u2019s native cryptocurrency \u2013 Ether (ETH) \u2013 is another asset that has shown strong resilience following the devastating market crash in the second part of 2022. It currently trades at around $2,000 (per CoinGecko\u2019s data), a 70% price increase compared to the first day of the ongoing year.\n\nSome analysts believe the current condition is just the beginning of an uptrend that could eventually take ETH to its all-time high of over $4,800. Such an individual is the one using the TradingView handle FieryTrading.\n\nAccording to them, the coin has been in a bullish mode for the past year and a half, suggesting a further surge in the following months.\n\n\u201cAs seen on the chart, ETH has been trading inside a bullish triangle pattern for over 1.5 years. In my eyes, a break out from this pattern might result in big gains for ETH since it will burst through an area full of short-trade stop-losses, which will be forced to buy back their positions,\u201d the analyst argued.\n\nAccording to their analysis, Ether\u2019s jump toward almost $5,000 is expected at the beginning of 2025. \u201cWith a stop below the recent swing low and a target around the current ATH, we can construct a very decent long-term trade for this big token,\u201d FieryTrading concluded.\n\nThe Analyst\u2019s Take on ADA\n\nApart from predicting ETH\u2019s possible price trajectory, FieryTrading has also given their two cents on Cardano\u2019s native token \u2013 ADA.\n\nThey believe the asset is poised for an astonishing increase toward $35 in two years based on certain parallel channels that hint about the beginning of a bull run:\n\n\u201cSince the pattern has now been confirmed, we can take a look at the next bull-market top. Assuming that the bull-market top will be somewhere in 2025 and that ADA will continue to follow this pattern, we can make the assumption that ADA will top somewhere above $35.\u201d"

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nEffective accelerationism has gained a following among Silicon Valley bigshots.\n\nAdvocates, including Marc Andreessen and YCombinator CEO Gary Tan, have added \u201ce/acc\u201d to their X handles.\n\nVitalik Buterin said he is sympathetic to the e/acc perspective but also criticized on several points.\n\nAs well as developing many of the digital innovations that shape the world today, Silicon Valley has also spawned a variety of philosophical movements over the years, often garnering mainstream attention after being picked up by influential tech bosses.\n\nIn the latest example of the phenomenon, business leaders, including YCombinator CEO Gary Tan and digital innovator-cum-venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, have endorsed a fiercely pro-AI techno-philosophy known as \u201ceffective accelerationism,\u201d often shortened to e/acc. And now, Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin has waded into the debate too.\n\nMarc Andreessen\u2019s Techno-Optimism\n\nWriting in his personal blog on Monday, November 27, Buterin responded to Andreessen\u2019s Techno-Optimist Manifesto , in which American businessman articulates his views on an idea that is fundamental to the intellectual culture of Silicon Valley: the notion of technology as a force for good that must be harnessed in the name of progress.\n\nA kind of polemic against what he perceives as a prevailing pessimistic discourse on technology, the views contained within Andreessen\u2019s manifesto place it firmly in the accelerationist camp of political philosophies.\n\nTHE TECHNO-OPTIMIST MANIFESTO part 1 \u201cYou live in a deranged age \u2014 more deranged than usual, because despite great scientific and technological advances, man has not the faintest idea of who he is or what he is doing.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Walker Percy \u201cOur species is 300,000 years old. For the\u2026 \u2014 Marc Andreessen \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@pmarca) October 16, 2023\n\nFor anyone familiar with his political and economic beliefs, Andreessen\u2019s latest monologue is continuous with a long-running ideological project. Over the years, the influential technology investor had often spoken of his admiration for the works of Ray Kurzweil and the controversial father of accelerationism, Nick Land.\n\nThe addition of \u201ceffective,\u201d however, is more recent.\n\nAlongside other prominent figures within the American technology sector, in 2023, Andreessen praised the pseudonymous internet personalities Beff Jezos and Bayes Lord, who coined the term e/acc in 2022.\n\ne/acc is the cultural framework of a more advanced civilization assembling itself from the future. \u2014 Beff Jezos \u2014 e/acc \u23e9 (@BasedBeffJezos) November 28, 2023\n\nIn Land\u2019s initial formulation, accelerationism posits that there is no way to resist or slow the \u201ctechno-capital machine,\u201d which can only accelerate the inevitable advance of technology.\n\nInflected through a digital culture that draws as much from SciFi movies and 4Chan mythology as it does the realm of traditional academia, e/acc has moved the discussion forward somewhat.\n\nFrom the inevitability of the forward march of capitalism, proponents of the new theory embrace acceleration as much as possible, rejecting outright any attempts to curb technological progress.\n\nVitalik Buterin Cautions Against AI Risks\n\nWhile Buterin is sympathetic to Andreessen\u2019s techno-optimism, the two men diverge on the issue of Artificial Intelligence (AI).\n\nAndreessen\u2019s view can be summed up by his assertation that \u201cany deceleration of AI will cost lives.\u201d Arguing against the precautionary principle, the Silicon Valley investor rejects any attempt to constrain technological growth, stating that \u201cthere is no material problem [\u2026] that cannot be solved with more technology.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, although he broadly aligns with Andreessen\u2019s criticism of anti-growth narratives, Buterin makes a point of distinguishing AI from other technologies. Observing that \u201cAI is fundamentally different from other tech,\u201d the Ethereum founder said it warrants a uniquely cautious approach.\n\nNew monster post: my own current perspective on the recent debates around techno-optimism, AI risks, and ways to avoid extreme centralization in the 21st century.https://t.co/6lN2fLBUUL pic.twitter.com/h5aIyFNCoh \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) November 27, 2023\n\nButerin\u2019s understanding of AI acknowledges that its capacity for self-improvement undermines the idea that any negative consequences can simply be countered with more advanced technology at a later date.\n\nMoreover, while the prospect of a Skynet-style superintelligence turning against humanity might seem outlandish in 2023, Buterin made the case that in the wrong hands, contemporary AI already poses a significant threat to human freedom:\n\n\u201cMy basic fear is that the same kinds of managerial technologies that allow OpenAI to serve over a hundred million customers with 500 employees will also allow a 500-person political elite, or even a 5-person board, to maintain an iron fist over an entire country. With modern surveillance to collect information, and modern AI to interpret it, there may be no place to hide.\u201d\n\nConsidering the rapid pace of AI development in recent years, Buterin isn\u2019t the only one who has voiced concerns.\n\nAround the world, most politicians and business leaders reject the hardline accelerationist stance and acknowledge that some checks and balances are needed. However, the question of what the appropriate level of restraint is remains contested.\n\nAmong AI developers, disagreement on the matter has created a growing rift between those who favor unbridled growth and those who support exercising restraint.\n\nOn one side, there are those like Emmett Shear, who lean toward moderation. Before his short-lived tenure as the CEO of OpenAI, Shear made it clear that he thought AI was evolving too quickly. \u201cIf we\u2019re at a speed of 10 right now, a pause is reducing to 0. I think we should aim for a 1-2 instead,\u201d he stated in September.\n\nNow, however, Altman is once again at the reigns. Newly empowered by a board shakeup that was one of the conditions of his return, Altman\u2019s leadership, while unlikely to endorse a full-blown e/acc agenda, nonetheless signals that the techno-optimists are back in charge."

        "content": "Technical Analysis\n\nBy TradingRage\n\nEthereum\u2019s price has been on the rise for the past few months, breaking above several resistance levels. Yet, the market is currently consolidating around the $2,000 mark, failing to continue its bullish momentum.\n\nThe Daily Chart\n\nOn the daily timeframe, the price has been consolidating around the $2,000 level after getting rejected from the $2,150 area once earlier.\n\nYet, the $2,150 level has rejected the price once again, and the market is currently testing the $2,000 level, which has turned into a support now. If it is broken down, it would be likely that a double-top pattern forms and a deeper decline occurs.\n\nConsidering the fact that the relative strength index is still showing values above 50%, which means that the momentum is in favor of the buyers, a bearish reversal seems improbable.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart\n\nLooking at the 4-hour chart, the recent price range becomes more clear. The price has been forming a triangle which is a classical continuation pattern.\n\nTherefore, in case a breakout occurs to the upside, the market will likely begin another bullish wave. Yet, the relative strength index is demonstrating a bearish momentum at the moment, showing values below 50%. Therefore, a drop to the lower boundary of the pattern is expected first.\n\nSentiment Analysis\n\nBy TradingRage\n\nOpen Interest\n\nAnalyzing the futures market sentiment could provide beneficial insight for the short term.\n\nThis chart represents the Ethereum open interest, which measures the number of open perpetual futures contracts on a daily basis. Higher values typically result in high volatility and probable bearish reversals, while lower values indicate a more sustainable trend.\n\nCurrently, it is evident that the open interest has been on the rise. But, it has yet to reach the values last seen during the all-time highs range. As a result, while corrections are always possible, the futures market is still far from overheating, and the current bullish trend is likely to continue in the coming weeks."

It points to growing volatility with forces such as the legal troubles of Binance and spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) approvals chatter continuing to drive the market.\n\nEthereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) prices are also teasing with bullish biases, hinting at bullish moves depending on how the bulls play their hands.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin price gains might be sustainable with declining stablecoin dominance\n\nBitcoin could move north if RSI crossover is enough to go by\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price has breached the $38,008 resistance level, though not decisive just yet, to trade for $38,139 at the time of writing. There remains potential for a stretch to the range high at $38,414, or in a highly bullish case, a neck up to tag $40,000.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) is moving north and is just about to cross above the signal line (yellow band). Historically, every time this crossover happens, BTC reacted with a bold move north, thereby qualifying the crossover as a buy signal.\n\nIn the same way, the Awesome Oscillator (AO) continues to hold in positive territory, showing that bulls still have control despite a strong bearish pull.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the other hand, increased selling pressure could see Bitcoin price fall back below the $38,008 support, or worse, test the $35,487 support. In a more dire case, the slump could see BTC lose the support confluence between the horizontal line and the 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) at $33,912. A break and close below this level would invalidate the bullish thesis, setting the tone for an extension south to the $30,000 psychological level.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin\u2019s bull trend in question as spot ETF momentum fades\n\nEthereum price eyes a 5% climb\n\nEthereum (ETH) price eyes a 5% climb to test the $2,141 range high before a possible correction, with the bullish breaker still holding as a support zone. The immediate support is at $2,029, atop which ETH continues to sit. Like in the case for Bitcoin, the RSI is about to cross above the signal line, hinting at a possible move north.\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nHowever, if sellers have their way, Ethereum price could fall into the supply zone turned bullish breaker, confirming the continuation of the move south by breaking and closing below the midline of this order block at $1,935.\n\nThe slump could extrapolate for Ethereum price to flip the bullish breaker back into a supply zone under the $1,864 support.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum whale activity could pave way for ETH price to hit new yearly highs\n\nRipple price must hold above $0.5981 for 10% gain to play out\n\nRipple (XRP) is coiling up for a 10% move to the supply barrier stretching from $0.6582 to $0.7186, but it all depends on whether the $0.5981 support level holds. To confirm the uptrend, XRP must shatter the midline of the supply zone at $0.6857. In a highly bullish case, the $0.8000 psychological level could be tagged soon.\n\nXRP/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the other hand, if the bears dominate, selling pressure could send XRP price below $0.5981, thereby invalidating the bullish thesis. In an extended move south, Ripple price could test the 50-day SMA at $0.5853, with prospects for more losses past the 200 and 100-day SMAs at $0.5531 and $0.5480, respectively.\n\nAlso Read: XRP price to pull north as Ripple beckons financial institutions to adopt XRPL XRP token."

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nVitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum, has issued a stark warning about artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nHe\u2019s not grouping AI with usual tech advancements like smartphones or social media. Instead, Buterin places AI in a category of its own due to its potential to revolutionize society (much like the printing press or the wheel did).\n\nThe twist? AI might outsmart us all, potentially becoming the dominant force on Earth. It's a leap into uncharted territory.\n\nThe threat of superintelligent AI\n\nButerin\u2019s concerns extend beyond typical tech fears. He cautions that a superintelligent AI could perceive humans as a threat, leading to catastrophic outcomes.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not a distant future issue \u2013 AI is advancing rapidly. While we\u2019d ideally want these superintelligent beings to be our allies, programming them to coexist with humans safely is a challenge we haven\u2019t yet solved.\n\nThis might sound like sci-fi, but it\u2019s a topic being taken seriously in tech circles. Rob Bensinger from MIRI illustrates diverse opinions on the AI threat level.\n\nIn a striking revelation, a 2022 survey among machine learning experts suggested a 5-10% chance of AI leading to human extinction.\n\nDespite sounding speculative, these concerns have been around for over a decade and warrant attention.\n\nEnvisioning the future with AI\n\nButerin also invites us to consider what life would be like in a world ruled by AI. He refers to Iain Banks's Culture series, where humans coexist with powerful AIs.\n\nThis imagined future offers longevity, health, and entertainment, but at a potential cost \u2013 humans may not be in control.\n\nThis prompts a crucial question about our future coexistence with AI: Will we be partners, or merely passengers in a world driven by machine intelligence?"

        "content": "Tue 28 Nov 2023 \u25aa 3 min of reading \u25aa by Fitah\n\nThe EIP 4844 or Proto-Danksharding is arguably one of the most significant updates for Ethereum, the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency. Highly anticipated by the community, its activation is planned for the first quarter of 2024. This update will enable a reduction in layer 2 (L2) transaction fees. Moreover, it will enhance the overall performance of Ethereum.\n\nReduction of Fees and Network Throughput Improvement\n\nThe EIP 4844 aims to reduce transaction fees on layer 2 (L2) solutions, potentially decreasing them by a factor of seven. The reduction of transaction fees will be accompanied by an increase in bandwidth on the network. According to expert Ryan Berckmans, the EIP 4844 should allow for the creation of a more efficient market for data storage. This is what he calls \u201cblob market clearance,\u201d which will notably increase Ethereum\u2019s throughput by sixfold.\n\nEthereum's EIP 4844 data blobs launch in ~3 months to greatly reduce L2 fees\n\n\n\nBy now, many people know that blobs initially give us ~7x data bandwidth (iirc), which is huge but not enough for global ubiquity.\n\n\n\nWhat's less well known may be that\n\n\n\n1) blob gas doesn't compete with\u2026 \u2014 Ryan Berckmans ryanb.eth (@ryanberckmans) November 25, 2023 Ryan Berckmans, an ETH community member on Twitter\n\nThe upgrade won\u2019t impact the gas costs of the main layer (L1), ensuring the stability of execution costs. Consequently, Ethereum\u2019s profitability and throughput will increase by 600%. With the introduction of the EIP 4844, L2 solutions will evolve the Ethereum crypto network in an unprecedented way, as they will benefit from the upgrade and contribute to Ethereum\u2019s scaling.\n\nExcellent Prospects in Sight for ETH Crypto\n\nThe expected improvements to the Ethereum ecosystem should strengthen its position in the crypto market. According to data, the network\u2019s revenue growth over the last twelve months in the third quarter of 2023 was 10.32%. The quarterly growth rate of 12.57% during the same period highlights a robust upward trend.\n\nThe upgrade could further boost revenue growth due to increased network efficiency and reduced gas costs. Notably, the ETH crypto is priced close to its 52-week high, at 99.32% of its maximum value. This seems to indicate strong investor confidence. The next release of Ethereum\u2019s financial results, set for February 1, 2024, will provide more insight into the financial impact of upcoming upgrades.\n\nIn the meantime, on the market, the price of Ethereum is facing a major resistance: the annual peak at $2,138. Since Friday, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has indeed recorded a decline of 5.5%. Currently, the ETH crypto is back to the psychological area of $2,000.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program!

        "content": "Vitalik Buterin plans to overhaul ETH staking and has outlined the progression of Ethereum\u2019s roadmap, particularly focusing on the forthcoming Dencun update.\n\nIn a recent interview with the NFT platform Defiant while in Turkey, Ethereum\u2019s co-founder Vitalik Buterin addressed the issue of staking centralization in the Ethereum network.\n\nButerin underscored the importance of reforming Ethereum\u2019s staking process to support more effective mining and staking pools, with the ultimate goal of boosting the platform\u2019s decentralization.\n\nThe initiative is a response to the challenges of data availability in off-chain systems, which have been sluggish due to high demands in the short and medium term.\n\nYou might also like: Vitalik Buterin publishes article discussing dimensions of connectedness to Ethereum\n\nVitalik Buterin outlines Ethereum\u2019s roadmap ahead\n\nButerin highlighted the upcoming Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 4844, known as Danksharding, which is expected to significantly increase the data map space to 16 Megabytes per slot. This upgrade is part of Ethereum\u2019s continuous efforts to improve scalability and efficiency.\n\nButerin also proposed a new voting system for governing future changes on the Ethereum network. This system aims to provide a more democratic and less disruptive process, potentially eliminating the need for hard forks. This strategic move is in line with Ethereum\u2019s ongoing evolution to address scalability challenges.\n\nSlated for early 2024, the Dencun upgrade is set to be a significant milestone in Ethereum\u2019s development journey. This upgrade aims to play a pivotal role in improving Ethereum\u2019s scalability, efficiency, and decentralization.\n\nEthereum chief lauds UTxO payment model\n\nDuring the interview, Buterin also delved into the potential adoption of the Unspent Transaction Output (UTxO) model, a system currently employed by blockchains like Bitcoin and Cardano. This exploration signifies Ethereum\u2019s willingness to consider a variety of strategies to tackle the existing challenges in its network.\n\nUpon Buterin\u2019s reference to UTxO, there was an immediate and humorous response from Cardano enthusiasts on the microblogging site X. Charles Hoskinson, the founder of Cardano, joined in with a satirical remark, quipping, \u201cEthereum 3 will solve it all,\u201d in a light-hearted jab at the discussion.\n\nNo worries, Ethereum 3 will have it all sorted! https://t.co/Td0Hm58eic \u2014 Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) November 24, 2023\n\nResponding to a comment, Hoskinson expressed his view that Cardano\u2019s achievements would likely never be acknowledged as significant by Vitalik or the Ethereum team. He also suggested that Ethereum is only now discovering solutions that Cardano has been working on for years.\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "content": "New Ethereum L2 Protocol Blast Faces Scrutiny as Paradigm Raises Concerns \u2013 Here\u2019s What You Need to Know\n\nSource: Adobe / lumerb\n\nBlast, the newly announced Ethereum (ETH) layer-2 scaling network led by the founder of top NFT marketplace Blur, has faced some controversy despite gaining notable traction.\n\nFor one, Paradigm, a prominent venture capital firm in the crypto space, has outlined numerous issues with the scaling solution while acknowledging its positive aspects.\n\nIn a Friday post on X (formerly Twitter), Paradigm\u2019s Head of Research and General Partner Dan Robinson expressed reservations about Blast\u2019s launch, noting that his comments represented the views of Paradigm.\n\nRobinson highlighted several issues with the announcement and execution of Blast, stating that the decision to launch the bridge before the layer-2 network and the three-month withdrawal restriction set an unfavorable precedent for other projects.\n\nThere are a lot of components of Blast that I\u2019m excited about and would be interested in engaging with people on. That said, we at Paradigm think the announcement this week crossed lines in both messaging and execution. For example, we don\u2019t agree with the decision to launch the\u2026 \u2014 Dan Robinson (@danrobinson) November 26, 2023\n\nHe further criticized what he perceived as marketing that undermined the work of a serious team.\n\nBlast positions itself as an Ethereum layer-2 network that offers native yield for Ethereum and stablecoins, allowing users to stake their funds and earn interest-like returns.\n\nThe network also promises rewards similar to those offered by Blur, attracting early adopters who lock up their funds in anticipation of potential airdrops.\n\nBlur has already distributed hundreds of millions of dollars worth of its BLUR token to NFT traders, surpassing former leader OpenSea in the process. This success has likely piqued the interest of crypto users.\n\nWhile users eagerly lock up their funds ahead of Blast\u2019s network launch in 2024, the network itself is not yet live.\n\nThe funds cannot be withdrawn until the mainnet rollout expected in February, raising security concerns given the history of exploits involving network bridges in the crypto industry.\n\nSome traders and industry participants have even labeled Blast as a Ponzi scheme due to its rewards and referral model.\n\nBlast has garnered significant attention and locked over half a billion dollars worth of funds from users eager to earn yield and rewards\n\nBlast Co-Founder Addresses Controversy\n\n\n\nBlast and Blur co-founder Tieshun \u201cPacman\u201d Roquerre responded to the criticisms in a Twitter thread on Friday, addressing what he referred to as misunderstandings surrounding Blast.\n\nRoquerre clarified that Paradigm, one of the investors in Blast\u2019s $20 million seed round, had no role in Blast\u2019s rollout plans.\n\nHe further revealed that Paradigm had requested changes to the launch, which Blast was considering, but emphasized that ultimate decisions would be made internally.\n\n1/ There's a meme going around that Blast is a ponzi. The yield that Blast provides users can feel too good to be true, so this meme is understandable. But to put it simply, the yield Blast provides comes (initially) from Lido and MakerDAO. Lido yield comes from ETH staking\u2026 \u2014 Pacman | Blur + Blast (@PacmanBlur) November 24, 2023\n\nRobinson, in his Sunday statement, commended Pacman and his team for the successful launch of Blur, which disrupted the NFT market and provided substantial rewards to users.\n\nHowever, he acknowledged that Paradigm and Blast disagreed on certain aspects of the rollout.\n\n\u201cWe invest in strong, independent founders who we don\u2019t always agree with. But we understand that people may look to us to set an example on best practices in crypto.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t endorse these kinds of tactics and take our responsibility in the ecosystem seriously,\u201d Robinson concluded."

Discover SCENE\n\nMagic Eden sees a crypto future that spans multiple blockchains\u2014and is launching its crypto wallet browser extension in closed beta to support that aim, the firm behind the NFT marketplace announced Monday.\n\n\u201cWe believe in a multi-chain world for NFTs,\u201d Magic Eden CEO and co-founder Jack Lu told Decrypt in an interview.\n\n\u201cUp until today, for a user to really experience all the different products and features and great content that we have on every chain, they effectively have to download three wallets,\u201d Lu said of the current challenges plaguing the wallet space that have led to user fragmentation on Magic Eden.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe marketplace\u2019s crypto wallet is launching for the Google Chrome browser first, but a Safari browser version and mobile app are also in the works. The mobile app could come into fruition as soon as early 2024, Lu shared.\n\nThe wallet will be compatible with the four blockchains that Magic Eden currently supports on its NFT marketplace: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Ethereum scaling network Polygon.\n\nThe initial Magic Eden wallet will be self-custodied, meaning users will have full control over their crypto assets and will have to keep a seed phrase\u2014a lengthy passphrase consisting of many words\u2014secure.\n\nBut if downloading three different crypto wallets to buy NFTs on Ethereum, Solana, and Bitcoin is frustrating and cumbersome for users, why still make them deal with seed phrases at all? Why not offer a Magic Eden-custodied wallet with a one-click email solution instead?\n\nLu said that holding your own crypto and NFTs is crucial to \u201cthe ethos of Web3.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIntroducing Magic Eden Wallet, a wallet made for Magic Eden users and cross-chain collectors.

For instance, when users have multiple wallets installed\u2014like MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, Phantom, or the Ronin Wallet, for example\u2014they can occasionally \u201cfight\u201d each other to connect to a website, simultaneously popping up at once and creating connection issues and confusion.\n\n\u201cWe're actually working pretty deeply right now to make sure that the wallets don't fight each other as much,\u201d Lu said, citing Magic Eden\u2019s work on its wallet with crypto tech firm Exodus.\n\nIn addition to cross-chain swaps, the Magic Eden wallet will also offer users the ability to buy crypto with fiat currency from within the wallet through a MoonPay integration, Lu said. The wallet will include NFT-focused features like cross-chain portfolio tracking, Bitcoin Ordinals support, and simultaneous connection to multiple blockchains.\n\n\u201cI think self-custody and email login\u2014and those seamless implementations\u2014they're not mutually exclusive,\u201d Lu told Decrypt of the wallet\u2019s potential future. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of very exciting technologies that we're looking to tap into to make that onboarding experience much more smooth, much more familiar to the mainstream user.\u201d\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward\n\nAD\n\nAD"

        "content": "Ethereum Co-Founder Vitalik Buterin: AI Poses Serious Threat to Humanity\u2019s Dominance\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has issued a warning about the potential dangers of super-advanced artificial intelligence (AI) surpassing human intelligence and becoming the dominant species on Earth.\n\nIn a recent post on X (formerly Twitter), the Ethereum (ETH) mastermind emphasized that the control and intervention of humans in AI development will determine the outcome of this scenario.\n\nButerin argued that AI is fundamentally different from previous inventions such as social media, airplanes, and the printing press, as it has the capability to create a new type of \u201cmind\u201d that could be detrimental to human interests.\n\nHe expressed concern that superintelligent AI, if left unchecked, could view humans as a threat to its own survival and potentially lead to the extinction of humanity.\n\n\u201cAI is [\u2026] a new type of mind that is rapidly gaining in intelligence, and it stands a serious chance of overtaking humans\u2019 mental faculties and becoming the new apex species on the planet.\u201d\n\nWhile acknowledging that the likelihood of such extreme outcomes is low, Buterin highlighted the need for humans to take precautions.\n\nAI risk 2: would a world with superintelligent AIs even be a world we would feel satisfied living in? On the instability of outcomes other than us being pets, and the failures of scifi to present realistic alternatives. pic.twitter.com/o9z8s6QAej \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) November 27, 2023\n\nHe proposed the integration of brain-computer interfaces (BCI) as a means to give humans greater control over AI-based computation and cognition.\n\nBCIs establish a direct communication pathway between the brain and external devices, enabling humans to actively participate in decision-making processes.\n\nBy reducing the communication loop between humans and machines to milliseconds, BCIs would ensure that humans retain a level of meaningful agency over the world.\n\nButerin emphasized the importance of humans maintaining responsibility for high-level planning, thus minimizing the risk of AI acting in ways misaligned with human values.\n\n\u201cWe [can] reduce the incentive to offload high-level planning responsibility to the AI itself, and thereby reduce the chance that the AI does something totally unaligned with humanity\u2019s values on its own.\u201d\n\nButerin Highlights the Importance of AI Regulation\n\n\n\nButerin also stressed the significance of human intention in guiding AI towards beneficial outcomes for humanity.\n\nHe cautioned against prioritizing profit maximization, highlighting the need for conscious decision-making that aligns with human values and aspirations.\n\nIn his concluding remarks, Buterin praised the ingenuity and creative potential of humankind.\n\nHe emphasized that humans have continuously developed technology to enhance their abilities throughout history and expressed hope that human achievements, such as space travel and geoengineering, will contribute to the preservation and beauty of life on Earth and beyond.\n\n\u201cTwo billion years from now, if the Earth or any part of the universe still bears the beauty of Earthly life, it will be human artifices like space travel and geoengineering that will have made it happen.\u201d"

        "content": "Super-advanced artificial intelligence (AI), left unchecked, has a \u201cserious chance\u201d of surpassing humans to become the next \u201capex species\u201d of the planet, according to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin.\n\nBut that will boil down to how humans potentially intervene with AI developments, he said.\n\nNew monster post: my own current perspective on the recent debates around techno-optimism, AI risks, and ways to avoid extreme centralization in the 21st century.https://t.co/6lN2fLBUUL pic.twitter.com/h5aIyFNCoh \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) November 27, 2023\n\nIn a Nov. 27 blog post, Buterin, seen by some as a thought leader in the cryptocurrency space, argued AI is \u201cfundamentally different\u201d from other recent inventions \u2014 such as social media, contraception, airplanes, guns, the wheel, and the printing press \u2014 as AI can create a new type of \u201cmind\u201d that can turn against human interests, adding:\n\n\u201cAI is [...] a new type of mind that is rapidly gaining in intelligence, and it stands a serious chance of overtaking humans\u2019 mental faculties and becoming the new apex species on the planet.\u201d\n\nButerin argued that, unlike climate change, a man-made pandemic or nuclear war, superintelligent AI could potentially end humanity and leave no survivors, particularly if it views humans as a threat to its survival.\n\n\u201cOne way in which AI gone wrong could make the world worse is (almost) the worst possible way: it could literally cause human extinction.\u201d\n\n\u201cEven Mars may not be safe,\u201d Buterin added.\n\nButerin cited an August 2022 survey from over 4,270 machine learning researchers who estimated a 5\u201310% chance that AI would kill humanity.\n\nHowever, while Buterin stressed that claims of this nature are extreme, there are also ways for humans to prevail.\n\nBrain interfaces and techno-optimism\n\nButerin suggested integrating brain-computer interfaces (BCI) to offer humans more control over powerful forms of AI-based computation and cognition.\n\nA BCI is a communication pathway between the brain\u2019s electrical activity and an external device, such as a computer or robotic limb.\n\nThis would reduce the two-way communication loop between man and machine from seconds to milliseconds and, more importantly, ensure humans retain some degree of \u201cmeaningful agency\u201d over the world, Buterin said.\n\nA diagram depicting two possible feedback loops between humans and AI. Source: Vitalik.eth\n\nRelated: How AI is changing crypto: Hype vs. reality\n\nButerin suggested this route would be safer, as humans could be involved in each decision made by the AI machine.\n\n\u201cWe [can] reduce the incentive to offload high-level planning responsibility to the AI itself, and thereby reduce the chance that the AI does something totally unaligned with humanity\u2019s values on its own.\u201d\n\nThe Ethereum co-founder also suggested \u201cactive human intention\u201d to take AI in a direction that benefits humanity, as maximizing profit doesn\u2019t always lead humans down the most desirable pathway.\n\nButerin concluded that \u201cwe, humans, are the brightest star\u201d in the universe, as we\u2019ve developed technology to expand upon human potential for thousands of years, and hopefully many more to come:\n\n\u201cTwo billion years from now, if the Earth or any part of the universe still bears the beauty of Earthly life, it will be human artifices like space travel and geoengineering that will have made it happen.\u201d\n\nMagazine: Real AI use cases in crypto, No. 1: The best money for AI is crypto"

However, it is imperative to understand how crypto wallets work to trust the allocation of your digital assets to them.\n\nEthereum wallets provide a secure, efficient and user-friendly mechanism to store ETH, NFTs and other crypto tokens and then later buy products with Ethereum if they so wish.\n\nCrypto wallets are not unlike regular cash wallets. They also allow users to digitally hold their assets, the key difference being that crypto assets are not physically stored in the wallet.\n\nCryptocurrencies are bits of data that are located on a blockchain. The wallets essentially store the user\u2019s proof of ownership of crypto assets.\n\nETH tokens are stored in Ethereum\u2019s Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs). Most Ethereum wallets allow users to generate a new Ethereum account. Traders do not need to use a previously generated Ethereum account.\n\nUsers operate their ETH tokens through two cryptographic keys: a private key and a public key.\n\nPublic Key: A public key can be intuitively visualized as a bank account number. Users can transfer ETH tokens from to others using their public key. Public keys are named so because users can publicly distribute this key to receive crypto assets from others.\n\nPrivate Key: A private key is an alpha-numeric passcode that proves a user\u2019s ownership of an Ethereum account. Every Ethereum EOA has an associated private key. As the name suggests, a private key needs to be protected at all costs.\n\nIf a malicious actor gets hold of the key, they can easily claim possession of all the crypto assets associated with it. Due to the decentralized nature of blockchain technology, in most cases, users cannot even recover their accounts.\n\nA private key has another important use. Ethereum uses a user\u2019s private key to cryptographically generate a digital signature. This digital signature is used to sign all outgoing crypto transactions. A malicious actor can use the private key to forge transactions.\n\nA wallet is primarily responsible for protecting this private key. Furthermore, a wallet can also generate multiple public keys. A public key is cryptographically derived from a private key. While the public key can be distributed, it can be used to track certain details about a user such as transaction history and account balance. Therefore, modern wallets generate a new public key after every transaction to protect a user\u2019s privacy.\n\nA crypto wallet uses a seed phrase to authenticate the user\u2019s ownership of the wallet. Therefore, it is imperative that users protect their seed phrases from ever being stolen. Users can also choose to store the phrase at multiple locations for surety.\n\nTypes of Ethereum Wallet\n\nWhile all wallets generally perform the same set of functions, there can be several key differences between them. A beginner user needs to understand the tradeoffs involved in order to choose the best Ethereum wallet.\n\nBased on the mode of availability, wallets are generally categorized into three categories: software wallets, hardware wallets and paper wallets.\n\nSoftware Wallet\n\nA software wallet is an application that allows users to store their crypto assets by digitally securing their private keys.\n\nA software wallet\u2019s best feature is its accessibility. Users can access these applications on commonly used devices such as Android and iOS phones, personal computers and even web browsers. They do not require the purchase of any new equipment or device.\n\nSoftware wallets are commonly referred to as hot wallets. While those terms may be used interchangeably, a hot wallet is technically referred to as any wallet that is connected to the internet.\n\nSoftware wallets being connected to the internet results in a tradeoff between ease of use and security. Software wallets allow users to quickly purchase and sell crypto assets using their private keys. The best crypto apps can also often support a wider range of crypto tokens and provide seamless transactions. Furthermore, they provide a range of payment options such as credit/debit cards, Google Pay, Apple Pay and PayPal.\n\nWhile software wallets provide a bevy of advantages, they are considered less secure than hardware wallets. The connectivity to the internet can allow hackers and other malicious actors to gain access to a user\u2019s private key.\n\nA software wallet can be further categorized into three categories: mobile wallets, desktop wallets and web wallets.\n\nMobile Wallet : As the name suggests, mobile wallets are applications that users can run on their Android or iOS platforms. Best Ethereum wallets such as Best Wallet offer these applications on both Google Play Store and Apple app store.\n\n: As the name suggests, mobile wallets are applications that users can run on their Android or iOS platforms. Best Ethereum wallets such as Best Wallet offer these applications on both Google Play Store and Apple app store. Desktop Wallet : Desktop wallets are wallet interfaces that users can download on their personal computers. Desktop applications store the private key on the computer\u2019s local storage.\n\n: Desktop wallets are wallet interfaces that users can download on their personal computers. Desktop applications store the private key on the computer\u2019s local storage. Web Wallet: Web wallets are one of the most popular kinds of software wallets. Users can usually search for these wallet services on the internet and add them as a web browser extension. While these wallets provide extremely user-friendly interfaces, they are considered the least secure. They can be subjected to keylogger hacks and distributed denial of service (DDOS) attacks.\n\nHardware Wallets\n\nHardware wallets are considered one of the most secure forms of crypto storage. These wallets are physical pieces of equipment that secure the private-public key pair. Users need to connect the equipment to a device such as a personal computer to operate the wallet.\n\nAn Ethereum hardware wallet is also referred to as a cold wallet. Cold wallets are defined as any crypto storage device that does not connect to the internet. The lack of internet connection ensures that malicious actors cannot steal the confidential information of the users. Software wallets are as secure as the platform they are operating on while hardware wallets provide additional multiple layers of security for users.\n\nHardware wallets can also provide additional security features. For example, modern cold wallets use security features such as a PIN code or a biometric scan that makes it impossible for a malicious actor to access the crypto tokens. Hardware wallets are also coming up with additional technology to replace seed phrases, thus eliminating the single point of failure.\n\nWhile hardware wallets are secure, they also have some key disadvantages. Most importantly, hardware wallets are considered to be less user-friendly than software wallets. These wallets need to be connected to another device such as a desktop to operate.\n\nHardware wallets are also considered significantly more expensive than software wallets \u2013 the price of a hardware wallet can usually range between $50 \u2013 $300 and can be a deal breaker for several users.\n\nPaper Wallets\n\nEthereum paper wallet involves crypto asset holders writing down their private-public key pair on a piece of paper. This is an old method of storage that is rarely used with the advent of modern crypto wallet technology.\n\nPaper wallets are a kind of cold wallet. However, unlike hardware wallets, they are considered unreliable and risky. Users with paper wallets require an interface to access the blockchain. Therefore, they often end up depending upon exchanges or software wallets, negating any advantage of cold storage.\n\nFurthermore, paper wallets are a massive single point of failure risk. The private key can be lost, stolen or destroyed, making it impossible for the user to ever access their crypto assets.\n\nHow to Find Safe Ethereum Wallets?\n\nThe primary function of an Ethereum wallet is to secure a user\u2019s private key and the crypto assets allocated to it.\n\nInvestors, especially those just entering into crypto investment are always keen to know if cryptocurrency is safe to invest in and wallets are a necessary feature of participating in the space. However, there are several factors that a user can consider to choose the most secure Ethereum wallet.\n\nReputation of the Provider\n\nDue to the decentralized nature of crypto, scams and rug pulls are one of the biggest threats to the digital assets of a user.\n\nTherefore, considering the reputation of a wallet provider is the easiest step a user can take to trust the authenticity of the wallet.\n\nFor example, a wallet that is regulated by a leading regulatory body can generally be trusted. Similarly, providers with a strong track record of traditional financing can also be trusted with their crypto products.\n\nSecurity Features\n\nA good understanding of the various security features offered by crypto wallets can help users select the best wallet.\n\nHardware wallets are usually considered the most secure option. These wallets are not connected to the internet, preventing any malicious activity to access the user\u2019s confidential data. They can also provide additional security features such as biometrics and a PIN code.\n\nOn the other hand, a software wallet can also be trusted if it provides comprehensive security features.\n\nTesting the Wallet\n\nTesting the wallet may be the best way to develop trust. Users can send a small amount of crypto assets using the wallet before trusting it for significant amounts. A number of Ethereum wallets also allow users to try out the wallet on the testnet using fake crypto assets.\n\nHow To Choose The Best Ethereum Wallet For You?\n\nThe choice for the best Ethereum wallet is a matter of personal choice and can differ from user to user. Here are the key factors that can help users make an informed choice.\n\nSecurity\n\nAs we have already discussed, a wallet\u2019s primary role is to ensure the security of a user\u2019s crypto assets. Therefore, users need to consider security as their top priority while selecting the Ethereum wallet. Beginners need to choose a wallet that is reputed and is certified by a regulatory body.\n\nBeginners are also susceptible to losing their private keys. Therefore, they need to choose a wallet with proper wallet recovery options such as seed phrase, two-factor authentication.\n\nRemember, it is possible to avoid paying tax on crypto if you simply keep it in your wallet and don\u2019t sell it, but you want peace of mind that it will still be there when you return.\n\nSupported Coins\n\nBeginners can be overwhelmed by the wide variety of assets available in the crypto market. A high-quality wallet supports a large number of crypto tokens, thus allowing users to diversify their portfolios.\n\nMany top wallets are also universal in nature as they support more than one blockchain network.\n\nFees\n\nAnother important factor to consider is the fees required to purchase certain crypto assets through a wallet. Different wallets use different exchanges to allow users to purchase crypto tokens from the wallet interface. Hardware wallets can often partner with third-party services to offer crypto functionality to users.\n\nFees can be of various types such as processing fees, network fees, trading fees, withdrawal fees, etc. Hardware wallets also require users to purchase the device upfront which can be expensive.\n\nUser-Friendliness\n\nBeginners need to consider that the wallet they choose is user-friendly. The idea of user-friendliness can differ from user to user. Beginner users may prioritize the ability to operate their Ethereum wallets from their mobile phones. Proper customer support and a broad ecosystem can also make wallets like Best Wallet user-friendly.\n\nMost importantly, wallets must provide users with a clear user interface to buy, sell and store cryptocurrencies.\n\nFeatures\n\nUsers may prioritize the availability of certain features in their wallets. For example, NFT enthusiasts may prioritize that the wallet provides NFT support. Seasoned investors may require staking, farming and yield functionality in their wallets.\n\nType of Wallet and Mobile Availability\n\nUsers need to make a careful choice between hardware wallets and software wallets. Most beginners prefer the availability of mobile wallets. Therefore, they need to ensure that the wallet of their choice provides Android or iOS support.\n\nSeasoned investors may choose a multi-layered approach that involves both hot wallets and cold wallets. Such users usually store their assets in cold storage and transfer them to a hot wallet when they are looking to trade.\n\nHow to Get & Use A Ethereum Wallet \u2013 Step-by-Step\n\nBy now, a user has enough information to choose the best Ethereum wallet of their liking. Now, let\u2019s go over how users can operate an Ethereum wallet seamlessly. We are taking the example of the Best Wallet due to its simplistic user interface.\n\nStep 1: Downloading the App\n\nTo start, visit the Play Store (for Android users) or the App Store (for iOS users). Search for \u201cBest Wallet\u201d and tap the \u2018download\u2019 icon. The Best Wallet app is free and designed for a quick installation process.\n\nStep 2: Account Registration\n\nAfter the installation, the app will guide you through the registration process. You have two options here:\n\nEnter an email address that you frequently use.\n\nUse the \u2018Continue with Apple/Google\u2019 feature for a seamless integration with an email already associated with your device.\n\nStep 3: Enhancing Security\n\nFor your account\u2019s protection:\n\nThe app offers two-factor authentication (2FA). This will send a six-digit code to your device whenever you log in, adding an extra layer of security.\n\nSetting up a four-digit PIN is essential and cannot be skipped.\n\nFor those preferring quick access, you can activate a fingerprint login. This means no more PIN entries whenever you want to access your account.\n\nStep 4: Explore The Best Wallet Features\n\nOnce registered, you can explore all the Best Wallet features. This includes insights on emerging and popular tokens, purchasing cryptos via third-party applications, and trading on its decentralized exchange platform with vast cryptos.\n\nCrypto assets are a volatile investment product. Your capital is at risk.\n\nConclusion\n\nCrypto wallets are crucial in allowing users to succeed in the crypto ecosystem. The Best Wallet provides beginners with the perfect crypto storage solution by balancing security and user-friendliness.\n\nThe platform has a plan that shows features being released step by step. Soon, users will get features like fingerprint security, support for multiple wallets, swapping within the app, crypto news updates, an NFT gallery, and new ways to earn staking rewards for its users.\n\nCrypto assets are a volatile investment product. Your capital is at risk.\n\nFAQs\n\nWhich is the Best Ethereum Wallet?\n\nAfter considering a wide variety of factors, we believe that the Best Wallet is the best Ethereum wallet. They provide ease of use, uncompromising security, and a wide range of features.\n\nWhat is the Safest Ethereum Wallet?\n\nHardware wallets are usually considered more secure than software wallets due to the non-access to internet connectivity. However, Best Wallet software wallets provide a broad level of security using two-factor authentication.\n\nIs there an Official ETH Wallet?\n\nNo. The Ethereum Foundation does not have an official ETH wallet. Users can choose the best wallet according to their liking."

        "content": "Not long after sharing the details regarding the decentralization of the Cardano (ADA) ecosystem, Charles Hoskinson, the founder of its blockchain development firm Input Output Global (IOG), has criticized Ethereum (ETH) plans for staking structure redesign shared by the platform\u2019s co-founder Vitalik Buterin.\n\nAs it happens, Hoskinson took a jab at Ethereum as he commented on a video of Buterin admitting to the overly centralized nature of current staking on the platform and describing plans to redesign its staking operations in an X post shared by user Stake with Pride on November 24.\n\nNo worries, Ethereum 3 will have it all sorted! https://t.co/Td0Hm58eic \u2014 Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) November 24, 2023\n\nFurthermore, responding to the comment noting that he was \u201cfuelling hostility\u201d with Ethereum, Hoskinson refuted such observations, arguing that Vitalik was \u201crediscovering what we\u2019ve been working on for almost a decade, and it\u2019s like a new revelation,\u201d adding that it was \u201cextraordinary that we never get a shout-out.\u201d\n\nCardano vs. Ethereum decentralization\n\nAs a reminder, the Cardano founder had poked fun at Buterin and his ideas before as well, like in early October, when the Ethereum pioneer shared a post listing the advantages of suggested changes in staking design for users who do not have enough resources to stake on their own.\n\nMeanwhile, Hoskinson recently revealed Cardano\u2019s upcoming moves toward the \u201cfull-blown\u201d decentralized governance structure as it enters the Voltaire era in its roadmap, including through the movements of all repositories to a community-run project called Intersect, as Finbold reported on November 17.\n\nElsewhere, Cardano\u2019s ADA token was at press time trading at the price of $0.381, which shows a decline of 2.50% on the day and a loss of 2.83% across the previous week while it still holds onto the gain of 30.08% on its monthly chart, according to the data on November 27.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "title": "Market Insights: Examining Recent Trends in Shiba Inu, Rebel Satoshi, and Ethereum Classic - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "TLDR\n\nShiba Inu\u2019s Shibarium layer-2 network has recorded a sharp increase in network activity.\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC) has reacted negatively to news of Spot Ethereum ETFs.\n\nRebel Satoshi ($RBLZ) could become the next main meme coin project following its grand plans for creating wealth for its ecosystem.\n\nShiba Inu\u2019s (SHIB) community is celebrating the rising network activity on its layer-2 network, Shibarium. Elsewhere, Ethereum Classic\u2019s (ETC) volatility has risen sharply amid calls for Spot Ethereum ETF approvals. Yet, analysts wonder if Ethereum Classic\u2019s growing network could spur a rally.\n\nStill, unconvinced investors have turned to Rebel Satoshi ($RBLZ) after it revealed a reward-filled ecosystem where decentralization is one of its core values. $RBLZ would grow by 30% by the next round of its presale. Yet, can it become a top ICO project? Let\u2019s discuss.\n\nShibarium Makes Surprise Comeback\n\nShiba Inu\u2019s (SHIB) popular layer-2 network, Shibarium, has recorded high transaction activity despite its recent decline. On November 21, Shibarium recorded 34,690 transactions, rising by 231% from $14,980 on November 20. The increase comes amid Shiba Inu\u2019s continued token burns, which have failed to protect SHIB\u2019s price.\n\nSHIB was trading at $0.000007954 on November 1. By November 20, SHIB\u2019s value had jumped by 6.2% to $0.000008449.\n\nSince the launch of Shibarium, Shiba Inu\u2019s (SHIB) team has embarked on more token burn events. Shiba Inu has also increased the burn rate significantly. Between November 20 and November 21, Shiba Inu burned 28.12 million tokens, a 47,872% increase from the previous day.\n\nShiba Inu\u2019s (SHIB) team has already hinted at a possible price increase due to increased token burns. Yet, SHIB\u2019s value has barely risen since the launch of Shbiarium. Analysts pin Shiba Inu\u2019s (SHIB) recent performance on the expectation that spot Bitcoin ETFs will be approved soon. This could push SHIB up by 13.0% to $0.000009549.\n\nEthereum Classic\u2019s Volatility Rises By Mid-November\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC) started the month of November on a bullish note. The excitement around possible spot Bitcoin ETFs was high, so investors increased their bullish holdings. This increased investor sentiment for projects like Ethereum Classic.\n\nAnalysts expected Ethereum Classic to capitalize on the growth, leading to an ETC rally. Yet, ETC\u2019s value has steadily declined. ETC cost $17.78 on November 1. By November 10, ETC\u2019s value rose by 16.8% to $20.78. However, ETC\u2019s volatility skyrocketed, causing it to fall by 12.6% to $18.15.\n\nLike other popular network hard forks, Ethereum Classic\u2019s (ETC) value tends to shoot up when Ethereum rallies. Furthermore, analysts expect Ethereum Classic\u2019s price to rise after BlackRock unveiled its partnership with Ethereum. Still, analysts say Ethereum Classic will likely face increased competition from other top altcoins. This means ETC could fall by 8.8% to $16.54.\n\nRebel Satoshi Wows Investors with a Potential 30% Increase\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto built Bitcoin with a dream of a decentralized financial world. Yet, since 2008, many crypto projects have strayed far from this ideal. However, RebelSatoshi ($RBLZ) is leading the drive back to the foundational principles of blockchain technology.\n\nThe network is building an ecosystem that creates wealth easily and distributes it fairly through its community. Wealth generation on RebelSatoshi will happen through different means, including an NFT marketplace for trading valuable assets, coin staking, and a play-to-earn game.\n\n$RBLZ is the governance and membership token of Rebel Satoshi. It offers users special access to discounts, private events, and exclusive projects within the RebelSatoshi ecosystem. $RBLZ\u2019s total supply is 250 million tokens. The network uses token burns to increase $RBLZ\u2019s value via scarcity. RebelSatoshi aims to unite the silent majority to challenge centralization within the crypto community.\n\nSince the launch of its blockchain ICO, RebelSatoshi ($RBLZ) has sold over 10 million tokens. It is now in the Early Bird phase of its presale. $RBLZ current value is $0.010. By the next round, titled the \u201cRebel Round,\u201d $RBLZ would rise to $0.013, jumping by 30%. $RBLZ would set the stage for further gains once it reaches $0.025 and is listed on decentralized exchanges.\n\nFor the latest updates and more information, be sure to visit the official Rebel Satoshi Presale Website or contact Rebel Red via Telegram\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH), the ringleader of top-performing altcoins, recently made waves by experiencing a notable 10% surge in its price, sparking keen investor interest. However, the market is also seeing another noteworthy contender that has been gaining prominence amid Ethereum\u2019s impressive performance. Let\u2019s delve into the reasons behind this growing attention!\n\n>>BUY SPCT TOKENS NOW<<\n\nETH Price Prediction: Fidelity\u2019s Ethereum Spot ETF Application Sparks ETH Price Rally\n\nIn a significant development on November 18, Bitcoinsistemi.com reported that Fidelity, overseeing a colossal $4.5 trillion in assets, has applied for an Ethereum Spot ETF. This move elevates the total count of Ethereum Spot ETFs awaiting SEC review to seven.\n\nFollowing Fidelity\u2019s move, the Ethereum token, ETH, witnessed a significant price pump. Between November 18 and November 28, ETH\u2019s price rose by 10%, from $1,927 to $2,121. This performance has left investors pondering, \u201cShould I buy Ethereum?\u201d Investors are closely watching the ETH price prediction to gain insights into potential impacts on the value of Ethereum.\n\nBloomberg analysts predict SEC approval for Bitcoin Spot ETFs will significantly boost chances for ETH Spot ETF approvals. Bloomberg\u2019s James Seyffart confidently predicts a 90% chance of SEC approving Bitcoin Spot ETFs by January 10, 2024. Looking ahead to Ethereum, the potential approval timelines for Ethereum Spot ETFs, if materialized, seem to converge around Q1 of 2024.\n\nAmong several things, Ethereum Spot ETFs would increase institutional investment, improve liquidity, and accelerate the development of Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem. If approved, Ethereum (ETH) will experience a notable price surge. Based on this, the ETH price prediction shows that Ethereum\u2019s price is likely to hit $3,582 by Q1 of 2024.\n\nVC Spectra (SPCT) Surges to Top of DeFi Crypto List with Remarkable 862.5% Increase\n\nAmidst Ethereum\u2019s growing momentum, VC Spectra (SPCT) has swiftly ascended as a standout performer, captivating investors with its promising trajectory. Since its presale debut in July 2023, VC Spectra (SPCT) has solidified its position among the top DeFi coins, beckoning enthusiasts with the allure of substantial returns.\n\nFunctioning as a decentralized hedge fund, VC Spectra (SPCT) strategically allocates investments to high-quality blockchain projects. Token holders are rewarded with quarterly dividends directly correlated to the quantity of VC Spectra (SPCT) tokens they possess.\n\nThe current buzz surrounds VC Spectra (SPCT)\u2019s Stage 5 presale, where tokens are being offered at an attractive $0.077. This marks a remarkable 862.5% surge from the initial launch price of $0.008. This meteoric price surge during its presale has positioned VC Spectra (SPCT) as one of the best DeFi tokens to watch out for.\n\nMore so, with VC Spectra (SPCT) gearing up to officially start trading on major exchanges in Q1 of 2024, market analysts predict a possible 100x increase in the token\u2019s price.\n\nTo learn more about VC Spectra (SPCT) and its presale, visit:\n\nBuy Presale: https://invest.vcspectra.io/login\n\nWebsite: https://vcspectra.io\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/VCSpectra\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/spectravcfund\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

The notionally open interest in Bitcoin and Ether options contracts has skyrocketed, according to Deribit, a large cryptocurrency exchange. As reported by Swiss-based Laevitas, this sum has already reached a mind-boggling $20.64 billion, virtually matching the peak set in November 2021, when Bitcoin was selling at an eye-popping $66,000.\n\nIt's worth noting that the current open interest in these contracts substantially outnumbers that of November 2021. With nearly twice the number of outstanding contracts, it's not just a triumph for Deribit, but also a strong indication of the cryptocurrency market's expansion and increased interest in options.\n\nWhere It All Began\n\nLet us now turn our attention to the show's main attraction - GameStop Memes. It all started in early 2021, when retail traders banded together to support GameStop, defying Wall Street's hegemony. This game-changing campaign demonstrated to the globe that the masses could, in fact, take on the financial system. GameStop Memes sprang from this maelstrom of events.\n\nGameStop Memes is here to carry on the tradition, representing the original GameStop movement's spirit of rebellion, solidarity, and humour. This token is about more than simply investing; it's about making a commitment to the future, about democratising finance and offering tools for financial empowerment and education.\n\nThe unique strategy of GameStop Memes distinguishes it in the enormous ocean of cryptocurrencies. It combines memes with finance to make investing more approachable and pleasurable. So, what makes GameStop Memes such an appealing investment potential in today's crypto environment? Let's look more closely:\n\nA Tribute To GameStop\n\nGameStop Memes celebrates the legendary GameStop movement. It is a sign of opposition to traditional structures that frequently exclude individuals. This homage keeps the communal spirit alive and well.\n\nCommunity-Driven Approach\n\nUnlike many cryptocurrencies, GameStop Memes places the community at the centre of its operations. It seeks to unite people all around the world with a common objective to democratise finances and provide resources for financial empowerment and education.\n\nSecure And Transparent\n\nIn the crypto realm, transparency and security are crucial. GameStop Memes achieves both by providing a safe environment for its users while retaining operational openness. This degree of confidence is priceless in the crypto world.\n\nInnovative Tokenomics\n\nGameStop Memes aren't only about making money in the near run. Its revolutionary tokenomics are intended to assure long-term involvement and stability. This emphasis on sustainability distinguishes it from many other speculative coins on the market.\n\nThe Takeaway\n\nGameStop Memes offers a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to be a part of something bigger, something that celebrates the strength of the community and the lighter side of finance. While notional open interest in Bitcoin and Ether futures contracts on Deribit continues to rise, GameStop Memes serves as a timely reminder that the unexpected may frequently produce the most substantial returns in the crypto realm. Don't miss out on this revolutionary adventure, invest in GameStop Memes and become a part of the movement that is redefining financial rules.\n\nGameStop Memes\n\nWebsite: https://gamestmemes.com\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/GameStopMemes\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/GameStopMemes"

        "content": "Seven days in crypto: Binance\u2019s $4 BILLION case, and Fidelity files for spot Ethereum ETF as options volumes grow\n\nData from CryptoCompare shows that the price of Bitcoin moved sideways throughout most of the past week, starting it at around $37,000 and seeing an initial sharp drop to $35,500, before recovering to now trade at $37,000 again.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, moved in a similar way, starting the week at $2,000 and seeing a sharp drop to near $1,900 before recovering. After hitting a $2,100 high throughout the week, ETH has since dropped to $2,025.\n\nHeadlines in the cryptocurrency space over the past week were dominated by Binance agreeing to pay $4.3 billion to settle with a coalition of US regulators, in one of the largest corporate penalties in the history of the country after it was accused of breaking sanctions and money-transmitting laws.\n\nAs part of the settlement, its founder Changpeng Zhao, also known as CZ, will resign from his role as CEO and admit to felony criminal charges of money laundering. Binance will be under the supervision of an independent third-party compliance monitor for a five-year period, during which it will be obligated to report any suspicious transactions it processes.\n\nThe firm\u2019s CEO, Zhao, will be succeeded by Richard Teng, the current Global Head of Regional Markets.\n\nToday, I stepped down as CEO of Binance. Admittedly, it was not easy to let go emotionally. But I know it is the right thing to do. I made mistakes, and I must take responsibility. This is best for our community, for Binance, and for myself.\n\n\n\nBinance is no longer a baby. It is\u2026 \u2014 CZ \ud83d\udd36 BNB (@cz_binance) November 21, 2023\n\nProsecutors in the US have argued that CZ poses an \u201cunacceptable risk of flight\u201d and shouldn\u2019t be allowed to leave the country ahead of his sentencing in February after he was released on a $175 million bond.\n\nOver the week, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a lawsuit accusing Kraken, a major cryptocurrency exchange based in San Francisco, of breaking federal securities laws by operating without proper registration as a broker, clearing agency and dealer.\n\nThe SEC has alleged that Kraken has posed a \u201csignificant risk\u201d by blending its corporate assets with customer crypto worth up to $33 billion, citing Kraken\u2019s independent auditor. According to the lawsuit, Kraken has occasionally held \u201cover $5 billion of its customers\u2019 cash, and it also mixes some of its customers\u2019 cash with some of its own.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit further states that Kraken has \u201csometimes covered operational costs directly from bank accounts containing customer cash\u201d. Kraken responded to these allegations saying it spent fees it has already earned, and said it disagrees with the SEC\u2019s complaint.\n\nThe SEC cannot continue ruling by enforcement. My statement on the Kraken lawsuit below: pic.twitter.com/J3qhzU624N \u2014 Senator Cynthia Lummis (@SenLummis) November 21, 2023\n\nThe SEC has identified several tokens, such as Algorand\u2019s ALGO, Polygon\u2019s MATIC, and NEAR, which it deems to be unregistered securities, and has stated that Kraken has actively promoted these tokens to investors. The filing seeks to permanently prohibit Kraken from functioning as an unregistered exchange. Kraken said it does not securities and plans to \u201cvigorously defend\u201d its position.\n\nOn top of this, Liechtenstein-based cryptocurrency trading platform Bittrex Global has announced that it will cease its operations and terminate all trading on its platform by December 4 due to numerous regulatory obstacles that have complicated its business operations.\n\nThese regulatory challenges encompassed the closure of its U.S. branch earlier this year following a $29 million settlement with the SEC over allegations of securities law violations. As the company begins to wind down, customers will be limited to withdrawing their funds from the platform.\n\nFidelity files for spot Ether ETF in the US\n\nMeanwhile, asset management giant Fidelity has filed a 19b-4 to launch a US-regulated spot Ether exchange-traded fund (ETF), the Fidelity Ethereum Fund, which would be listed by an exchange owned by Cboe Global Markets.\n\nSome crypto enthusiasts hold that crypto ETFs could exert a substantial influence on the crypto market by boosting accessibility, as these funds would allow investors to gain exposure to their underlying digital assets without having to manage their own private keys.\n\nThis past week also saw Deribit\u2019s Bitcoin options open interest hit a record high above the $15 billion mark, overtaking BTC futures for the first time in a sign of the market\u2019s \u201cmaturation and growing sophistication,\u201d according to Deribit\u2019s Chief Commercial Officer Luuk Strijers.\n\nAccording to CCData\u2019s latest Exchange Review, the trading volume of options on the CME experienced a significant uptick, with BTC and ETH options setting new all-time highs. BTC options saw a 142% increase, reaching a trading volume of $1.75 billion, while ETH options rose by 107%, hitting a trading volume of $532 million.\n\nNotably, JPMorgan analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, have identified a potential outflow of $2.7 billion from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) in the event of its conversion to a spot Bitcoin ETF, based on investors having so far this year been acquiring GBTC shares at a discount to the trust\u2019s underlying BTC holdings.\n\nFrancisco Memoria is a content creator at CryptoCompare who\u2019s in love with technology and focuses on helping people see the value digital currencies have.

        "title": "Vitalik Buterin To Redesign Ethereum From The Ground Up - Blockzeit",
        "content": "If there\u2019s one person who is not happy with how Ethereum (ETH) turned out to be, that would be its co-founder, Vitalik Buterin. In a recent discussion, the Russian-Canadian programmer revealed he plans to redesign the network from the ground up to address some of its pressing flaws, especially in performance and staking.\n\nVitalik Buterin stated at the Devconnect in Turkey that he plans to redesign Ethereum staking and solve problems affecting performance. He recognizes the UTXO payment model and hopes to integrate private mempools, ERC-4337, code pre-compilation, ZK-EVMs and liquid staking in\u2026 \u2014 Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) November 27, 2023\n\nThe Problem of Ethereum According to Vitalik Buterin\n\nVitalik Buterin unveiled his ambitious plan to reform the second-biggest crypto by market dominance during the Devconnect event in Turkey. The developer of Ether is apparently not pleased with how are things going within his brainchild with Gavin Wood, Charles Hoskinson, Anthony Di Iorio, and Joseph Lubin.\n\nThe soft-spoken crypto personality particularly cited concerns over the performance issues that have been a constant pain in the network\u2019s side and the heavy reliance of its liquid staking in a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) model.\n\nThe Proposed Overhaul\n\nBased on the information shared by Wu Blockchain on the X platform, Buterin is looking to integrate private mempools to safeguard Ethereum users\u2019 privacy and security. The feature will allow them to transact without exposing their reason for doing so to the public mempool. This way, miners will not be able to take a peek of their intentions and potentially exploit them.\n\nAdditionally, the infusion of ERC-4337 for account abstraction gives users the ability to deploy smart contracts to manage their accounts without giving up control over them when using applications. This also paves the way for their convenience in the implementation of multisig wallet functionalities.\n\nSpeaking of smart contracts, Buterin wants to make their deployment more efficient, faster, and cheaper. He said this could be accomplished through code precompilation, which preprocesses some elements of the cryptograph. For a basic illustration of the term, it repurposes input data to generate output which is, in turn, used as input again, and so the cycle goes.\n\nLastly, Buterin emphasized the need to rectify the liquid staking of ETH that\u2019s now dangerously falling into the control of a few players. For context, the top five liquid stakers of Ethereum \u2014 Lido, Coinbase, Figment, Kraken, and Binance \u2014 have a combined 50% influence on the PoS chain. Among them, Lido accounts around a third of the pie.\n\nEthereum Now\n\nAs of this writing at 2:00 AM UTC time, Ethereum remains in the $2,024 range, only moving downward by 1.6% on the 24-hour timescale. A voluminous transaction was noted within this period nearly 30% as the coin hovered between a low of $1,988 to a high of $2,054."

        "content": "Best Ethereum App in Australia 2024\n\nThe best Ethereum app should allow you to buy and trade Ethereum, exchange the crypto for other cryptocurrencies, and perform a range of trading strategies short positions, range trading, and scalping.

These apps are not necessarily trading apps but are used by people who buy and keep cryptocurrencies rather than trade frequently. Let\u2019s explore the MetaMask wallet.\n\nMetaMask\n\nMetamask is one of the world\u2019s most popular Ethereum apps with over 30 million global users. Since its inception, MetaMask has continued to break boundaries and set itself as the best Ethereum wallet mobile app and the go-to portal between users and Web3 or blockchain applications. Let\u2019s explore why MetaMask is special.\n\nKey Features\n\nMetaMask is incredibly simple to use:\n\nMetaMask allows users to buy, sell, and swap tokens over its mobile application or browser extension. The wallet gives you a secure vault, token exchange capabilities, a token wallet, and safe login. It\u2019s an all-in-one app that promotes Web 3 usage in a simple interface. The beginner-friendly interface helps you store and manage your tokens.\n\nInteract with blockchain applications:\n\nMetaMask is ever so important because most Web 3 applications sit on the Ethereum blockchain and its variants. MetaMask bridges metaverse explorers with blockchains by providing a seamless portal to buy and exchange Ethereum \u2013 Ethereum blockchain\u2019s native token.\n\nMetaMask allows you securely access blockchain apps without giving up more than necessary data. The mobile app also supports NFT and DeFi applications such as opensea, giving you unlimited access to the DeFi world.\n\nMetaMask swap:\n\nMetaMask\u2019s new Swap feature allows you to swap tokens at the most competitive prices. For example, MetaMask accesses liquidity information of DEX\u2019s liquidity pools and DEX aggregators like UniSwap, AirSwap, Curve, 0XAPI, 1inch, and Paraswap. With such data, you can execute positions with DEXs with the largest liquidity and save money from spreads.\n\nThe gas fee on a swap is $0.0875% of the swap volume. For large swap volumes, MetaMask spreads your order over multiple DEXs to avoid slippage. Slippage occurs when you make large orders from a single exchange, and prices swing because the exchange isn\u2019t liquid enough to immediately execute the order. Large swaps or positions often lead to slippage, but MetaMask saves you from slippage costs by spreading your order over multiple DEXs.\n\nSecurity:\n\nMetaMask has intensive security protocols, multi-layer security systems, and 2FA authentication to ensure consumer funds\u2019 safety. MetaMask also has an open policy. That is, they disclose security breaches to the users immediately one is suspected. The transparency makes them the best place to buy Ethereum.\n\nMetaMask native ecosystem supports ETH and ETH-based tokens like the ERC-20 and ERC-721.\n\nPros: MetaMask is one of the most popular ETH wallets available.\n\nA swap fee of 0.875% is highly competitive, given that MetaMask exposes users to top DEXs with deep liquidity and minimizes spreads.\n\nA swap fee of 0.875% is highly competitive, given that MetaMask exposes users to top DEXs with deep liquidity and minimizes spreads.

Cons: While spreading your large order over different liquidity providers and DEXs, you may incur unwarranted fees each DEX charges on order execution. Spreads are not fixed and are entirely dependent on the market and the liquidity of the commodity.\n\nMetaMask supports Ethereum and its variants in its native ecosystem, while swaps are executed via a partnership with other companies. It begets the question of trust. Can you trust MetaMask to keep your data safe and not share unnecessary data with its partners? We think you can!\n\nYour money is at risk\n\nAre Crypto Apps Safe To Use?\n\nThe cryptocurrency industry has been the target of malicious groups. While they operate on autonomous and decentralized systems powered by blockchain networks, attackers often find loopholes in smart contracts and bridges, seizing unimaginable amounts of money from users\u2019 wallets. It\u2019s important to consider the security of your crypto apps before choosing an app to use. Ethereum and Bitcoin trading are the two most prominent coins, and we also have tons of tokens in the market. Investing or trading these coins comes with risk. Let\u2019s explore the safety of crypto apps:\n\nBefore you choose a crypto app, ensure that the app has grade-A level security protocols and does not have a long history of breaches: Apps like Crypto.com and MetaMask, are considered extremely safe because of the safety and security measures they explore in keeping user assets.\n\nCold wallets:\n\nWhile it is easier to transfer funds in hot wallets, cold wallets offer the best security. A crypto wallet or app should store its assets in a cold wallet \u2013 inaccessible online to hackers. When your assets are securely stored in a vault, it means that hackers cannot access your wallet through the portal.\n\nLicenses:\n\nA licensed crypto app beats an unlicensed one. No matter how promising an app is, you are subject to malpractices like pump and dumps, rug pull, and hacks if it is unlicensed. Also, when a crypto app is unlicensed, users are not under any user-protection contract; hence, funds lost are dead and gone.\n\nUser reviews:\n\nBefore choosing an app, check out their reviews on PlayStore. It\u2019s usually rare to see a crypto app with a 5-star review aggregate, but anywhere from 3.9 to 4.5 stars is good enough. Of course, the latter number is preferred.\n\nAustralian regulation\n\nThe Australian Securities and Investments Commission, ASIC, is the highest regulatory body for financial providers and financial asset collectors. It\u2019s important to use an app that is licensed by the ASIC. First, the ASIC puts financial institutions through an extreme vetting process, ensuring they have excellent security protocols and insurance policies protecting users. When you visit an exchange\u2019s \u2018Security\u2019 page, you see many industry lingoes. Some of these words and numbers are entirely impossible to decipher. An exchange can boast of a certain security feature, but it takes an expert to know real stuff from the shaft. An ASIC certification proves that an exchange or app is as secure as they claim they are.\n\nSecurity and privacy\n\nSecurity and privacy are two very important factors to consider before choosing an app. Let\u2019s take a look at the security features and privacy factors you must consider:\n\n2FA: A crypto app should always support two-factor authentication. The more complex the layers of authentication, the better. Some apps won\u2019t allow you to log into your account without authenticating your primary device. Other apps send codes to your email address and phone number. If an activity on your account raises suspicion, an app should be able to lock you out and request your private key before logging you back in. Other 2FA protocols include location \u2013 if you log in from an unusual location, a crypto app can log you out and request your private key before letting you gain access. Volume: If your withdrawal volume is disproportionate to your usual volume, an app\u2019s AI can spot this as a scam and request that you provide your private keys. Cold storage: Cold storage removes your wallet from online. When your wallet and assets are on the blockchain, it is online and susceptible to attacks from malicious scammers. When your assets are offline, it is impossible for an attacker to steal them through online measures. Data sharing: Apps like MetaMaks partner with multiple exchanges to find the best liquidity when you want to swap cryptocurrencies. While the process ensures that you get the most competitive prices at any given time, it may mean that MetaMask and the other DEXs have to share information. MetaMask has explicitly stated in its website that it values user privacy and doesn\u2019t share more-than-needed data; you may need to check the data privacy of other crypto apps to ensure that they do not share sensitive data with their partners.\n\nHow to spot a crypto app scam\n\nCrypto app scams have become a mainstay in the cryptocurrency industry. Scammers often employ different techniques to draw unsuspecting victims and siphon their funds. Let\u2019s take a look at activities that scream scam in the crypto industry.\n\nA shabby-looking website: Scam websites often have the same layout because most scammers are impatient and use scripts of other scam websites to lure people into registering their accounts. A scam website will lack a good home page, won\u2019t reveal the name of the founders of the project, and will have a poor layout. Websites like MetaMask, Binance, and Coinbase, are professionally built and have a simple layout. Leave the website immediately if the layout doesn\u2019t appeal to your sense of safety. Promise mouth-watering returns: Scam websites often promise their users mouth-watering returns like 33% to 44% APY on staking and investments. Cryptocurrency investment can have great returns, but the market is volatile, and no exchange or broker can boast of constant positive returns on investment. A website that promises to double your investment in a few days is certainly a scam. Even established brokers like Crypto.com promise an 8% APY after about a year of holding. Does not require identity verification: Scammers want you to quickly get to the payment page, so they skip many important elements a crypto website should have. One of those elements is identity verification and proof of address. It is illegal to allow an entity to trade without verifying the entity\u2019s identity. Any exchange or app that allows you to trade unverified is certainly not licensed by any major agency. You will be better off donating your funds to charity. No licenses: A crypto website that allows users worldwide to trade without proper licenses in trading regions is a scam site. Be careful! Scam sites are usually open to everyone in every country. Some of them are small time, so they do not fall under the radar of law enforcement; however, these websites can steal thousands and hundreds of thousands of dollars from unsuspecting victims. Spam calls and messages: Any website that claims that an expert will call you during the registration process is most likely a scam. First, a real website with good traffic won\u2019t invest that much in telemarketing. The cryptocurrency space is volatile, and authentic sites avoid telemarketing at all costs. If a crypto exchange calls or sends messages advising you to invest more, you may be in a scam ecosystem.\n\nOther tips to consider include the following:\n\nNever open a link or button in an email from unverified sources. Opening unverified or malicious links can make your device vulnerable to security attacks, including cryptojacking (your device will be used to mine cryptocurrencies). Ensure that you visit the correct URL of popular crypto apps. For example, metamask.io can be cunningly delivered as metamasks.io. The former is the correct MetaMask website URL. The latter, if it exists, is a phony website dressed like the actual MetaMask site.\n\nTop Tips for Using Ethereum Apps Safely Never share your passphrase Under no circumstance should you ever share your private key or passphrase. With your passphrase, scammers can lock you out of your wallet and withdraw every penny you have. Passphrase security tips include: Do not store your passphrase online. Instead, store it in a physical security box. Do not share your passphrase with friends or family members. Use a reliable internet connection A reliable and secure internet connection allows you to explore cryptocurrency applications without exposing yourself to vulnerabilities. Before logging into your crypto wallet, follow these security steps: Do not use public online access: When you browse on public wifi, scammers can mirror your online activity and gain access to valuable information like your wallet address and password. If you want to log into your MetaMask, ensure you do so on a public and secured network. Auto-filling your wallet address might be a bad idea. If a thief steals any of your devices (mobile or laptop), he can gain access to some of your wallets if he logs in through your device. This is because apps like Google and Dashlane lets you autofill passwords and email addresses.
