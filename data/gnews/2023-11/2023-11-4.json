We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nThe Ethereum network has witnessed a significant surge in transaction volumes, hitting a new six-month high. Over the last week, the mainnet alone settled over $213 billion in transactions, underscoring a robust uptick in on-chain activity. Layer 2 solutions such as Arbitrum, Optimism and Base have further buoyed this growth, adding another $16 billion to the aggregate volume. This uptrend reflects growing confidence and utility in the Ethereum ecosystem, suggesting an increasingly vibrant blockchain landscape.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe spike in transaction volume has come with other noteworthy metrics, such as an increase in transaction fees. While higher fees can indicate network congestion and increased demand for block space, they also reflect the economic activity on the network. Investors and users should monitor these fees as they can affect the cost-effectiveness of conducting transactions on the Ethereum network.\n\nOver the past week, the network burned an average of 855,000 ETH per year, a mechanism that could contribute to deflationary pressure on the token's supply over time. This \"burn\" counteracts the issuance of new ETH, aiming to create a balance that can benefit the asset's long-term valuation.\n\nLooking at the daily chart, Ethereum's price action appears bullish. The price is maintaining a consistent pattern above both the 50-day and 200-day moving averages, indicating sustained buyer interest. The chart showcases a series of higher lows and higher highs \u2014 a classical uptrend signal. The recent price has surpassed local resistance levels, potentially aiming for higher price points.\n\nThe increase in on-chain activity, coupled with the reduction in supply due to the burn mechanism, are both fundamental factors that could be driving optimism in the market. The Layer 2 scaling solutions are also contributing to increased accessibility and efficiency, potentially drawing more users and transactions to the network."

        "content": "A widely followed crypto analyst believes that Ethereum (ETH) and three other altcoins in its ecosystem are primed for surges.\n\nPseudonymous analyst Kaleo tells his 601,300 followers on the social media platform X that Ethereum is threatening to take out its diagonal resistance at $1,900.\n\nAccording to a chart shared by the analyst, Ethereum may rally to as high as $2,100 following a breakout.\n\n\u201cConsidering it is a diagonal season, the fun for ETH should really start whenever it clears $1,900.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, Ethereum is trading for $1,854.\n\nThe crypto strategist is also keeping an eye on the Ethereum scaling solution Arbitrum (ARB). Kaleo says that ARB has already flipped a key diagonal resistance into support and may rally to as high as $1.30.\n\n\u201cARB also looks primed for new highs after breaking out/retesting a high time frame resistance.\n\nI\u2019d like to see a move back to the mid-August breakdown level (~$1.15) followed by the July highs in the $1.30s.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, ARB is worth $1.10.\n\nNext up is layer-2 protocol and Arbitrum rival Optimism (OP). According to Kaleo, OP appears to be following in the footsteps of ARB after taking out a multi-month diagonal resistance.\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t mention ARB without taking a look at OP\u2026\n\nA pretty clear flag forming beneath it \u2013 looks ready for a pushback toward the August highs near $2.00.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, OP is worth $1.529, above Kaleo\u2019s diagonal resistance.\n\nThe last Ethereum-based altcoin on the trader\u2019s radar is the native asset of the non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace Blur (BLUR). Kaleo shares a chart suggesting that BLUR is in an uptrend after breaking above its diagonal resistance.\n\n\u201cBLUR looks like it\u2019s ready to start the climb back to $0.50.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, BLUR is trading at $0.30.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "title": "Bitcoin and Ethereum price rise halting makes way for layer-2 & DeFi tokens to chart over 40% gains - FXStreet",
        "content": "Share:\n\nEthereum price, along with Bitcoin, is presently moving sideways after hitting $1,857 and $35,000 respectively.\n\nSmall-cap cryptocurrencies are making gains fuelled by high investor participation.\n\nThe total value of all other cryptocurrencies, excluding BTC and ETH, has risen by 14% but needs another 9.3% increase to recover all the recent losses.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum price initiated the bullish momentum that pulled up the entire cryptocurrency market. However, even as their rally comes to a halt, the rest of the altcoins seem to continue making the most of the situation, resulting in a significant rise over the past couple of days.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum price halt\n\nBitcoin, after hitting $35,000, stepped back for a while, and Ethereum price did the same after reaching $1,857. Both the cryptocurrencies for the past few days have been moving sideways as the market cools down, but there is an inkling that this sideways price action could result in a decline.\n\nIn the case of Ethereum, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator contributes to this forecast as the receding green bars on the histogram suggest the bullishness is waning. If this is followed by the signal line (orange) moving over the MACD line (blue), a bearish crossover would be confirmed.\n\nThis would occur only if Ethereum price loses the support of $1,827, which coincides with the crucial 61.8% Fibonacci Retracement from $2,005 to $1,539. The ensuing bearish momentum would not only confirm a bearish crossover but also bring ETH down to 50% Fibonacci line at $1,772.\n\nETH/USD 1-day chart\n\nHowever, if the sideways momentum meets bullish momentum via broader market cues and the $1,827 line is tested as a support floor, a recovery is on the cards. Breaching the 78.6% Fib retracement at $1,906 would not only invalidate the bearish thesis but also flip $1,900 into support.\n\nOther cryptocurrencies are faring rather well\n\nWhile BTC and ETH are seeing waning bullishness, the past few days have been spectacular for altcoin investors. Many layer-2 cryptocurrencies, as well as Decentralized Finance (DeFi) tokens, have seen significant rises along with the majority of the layer-1 tokens.\n\nAnalytics platform IntoTheBlock, in regards to this shift in capital, stated,\n\n\"This week's trend suggests this rotation is beginning to take place as Bitcoin and Ether trend sideways while DeFi and alternative L1 tokens record a strong rebound.\n\nThis was verified by the fact that SushiSwap noted a 63% rise in the past three days. Other top DeFi tokens like THORChain (RUNE), PancakeSwap (CAKE), and Aave (AAVE) noted about 35%, 31%, and 15%, respectively.\n\nThis resulted in the market capitalization of altcoins, excluding Bitcoin and Ethereum, observing a 14.67% growth, adding 47.13 billion since mid-October. This has brought the market cap to $368 billion, but for the recent losses to be recovered, altcoins would need to collectively raise the market capitalization by 9.38% and register inflows worth $34.55 billion to bring it to a 2023 high of $402.5 billion.\n\nAltcoin market capitalization\n\nHistorically, crypto cycles have followed a pattern of Bitcoin leading the first surge, followed by Ethereum rising, and eventually, capital progressively being allocated to lower-cap and riskier bets. However, if the broader market cues turn bearish, these altcoins could also note sideways movement.\n\nRead more - SushiSwap price rallying by 63% in four days causes $4.8 million worth of short liquidations"

This amounts to an increase of 50.9% from the $146.31 billion market cap observed on January 1.\n\nMoreover, investors are continuously staking ETH, with subsequent all-time highs for the total value staked in the Ethereum 2.0 smart contract. It recently achieved the value of a $32 million stake, according to data from CryptoQuant retrieved by Finbold on November 4.\n\nEthereum: Total Value Staked. Source: CryptoQuant\n\nWithin the current positive outlook for Ethereum and the cryptocurrency market expectations for a coming bull market in 2024, Finbold asked ChatGPT to forecast a price range for ETH by the start of the next year.\n\nChatGPT-4: Ethereum price will be between $3,000 to $10,000 in 2024\n\nNotably, the ChatGPT-4 forecasts Ethereum price to trade between $3,000 to $10,000 in 2024. The lowest price in this range would mean an increase of 63% for ETH from its price of $1,835 per ether by press time.\n\n\u201cPredicting Ethereum\u2019s price in 2024 involves analyzing current trends and factors. As of now, Ethereum\u2019s price moves impelled by increased adoption, platform upgrades, and market sentiment. Its price could range between $3000 and $10,000 by 2024. The breadth of this forecast attributes to the volatile crypto market.\u201d \u2014 ChatGPT-4\n\nInterestingly, the GPT-4 artificial intelligence has also mentioned \u201cexpanding institutional adoption\u201d and the role of ETH 2.0 proof of stake network for its price prediction.\n\nEthereum price prediction for 2024 Source: Finbold (ChatGPT-4 Telegram Bot)\n\nAdditionally, it has also pointed toward technical analysis indicators to justify the mentioned price range for Ethereum.\n\n\u201cAnalyzing with indicators like Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), Relative Strength Index (RSI), and Bollinger Bands, Ethereum is on a bullish trend.\u201d \u2014 ChatGPT-4\n\nHowever, the ChatGPT also mentioned that factors like regulatory changes or a significant tech advancement by competitors could potentially drop ETH\u2019s value in 2024. With that in mind, investors and cryptocurrency traders must continuously monitor their position and adjust accordingly as the new year arrives.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "content": "Partner at the Venture Capital firm Placeholder Capital and prominent figure in the crypto community, Chris Burniske, has given an instance where assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum could see a repeat of what happened in mid-2019.\n\nNew Highs Before A \u201cFinal Wipeout\u201d\n\nIn a post shared on his X (formerly Twitter) platform, Burniske mentioned that a repeat of mid-2019 could happen if the top two cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and Ethereum, were to \u201crip\u201d from their current levels. If that happens, the crypto founder believes that the broader crypto market could follow suit.\n\nAs to how these crypto tokens could go, he noted that they could rise enough to make people believe that they could hit new all-time highs soon, but that may not be the case as these investors could endure a \u201cfinal wipeout\u201d soon after (possibly in the first quarter of next year) with these tokens steady declining to higher lows.\n\nTo drive home his point, Burniske suggested that Bitcoin and Ethereum\u2019s current price action shared similarities to the period between December 2019 and January 2019 before the \u201cpainful descent into March 2020 lows.\u201d According to him, although that period was the COVID era, \u201ceverything is also the same about the actors on the stage.\u201d\n\nBurniske seemed to be certain about his assertions. In a subsequent post, he warned investors that the rollercoaster \u201ccould get extreme\u201d in relation to what he had said earlier and urged them to have their seatbelts on.\n\nETH price sitting at $1,844 | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nMarket Cycle And Macro Factors Affecting Bitcoin And Ethereum\n\nMany didn\u2019t seem to react well to Burniske\u2019s projections, considering that it could mean that the crypto market and everyone in it could be in more pain, even if a massive rally (as the crypto founder predicts) is likely to happen before that.\n\nA particular X user, however, seemed to agree with his position as he stated that Burniske\u2019s prediction makes so much sense as that is how the \u201ccycle psychology\u201d works, just that this time, it happens to line up \u201cperfectly\u201d with some highly likely macro scenarios. Burniske responded to the post as he agreed that those were the points he was trying to drive home.\n\nOne of these macro scenarios, which was alluded to, could be the rising inflation and how the Federal Reserve and other authorities globally are increasing interest rates to battle the economic downturn. Bloomberg analyst Mike McGlone had once mentioned how Bitcoin could crash to $10,000, with inflation being one of the factors that could lead to the decline.\n\nAnother crypto analyst, Nicholas Merten, had also noted that Bitcoin could decline further if the Feds do not do enough to curb the rising inflation.\n\nFeatured image from The Street, chart from Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Cross-chain non-fungible token (NFT) platform Magic Eden has partnered with Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) creator Yuga Labs to launch a new Ethereum marketplace, according to a press release on Nov. 4.\n\nThe new marketplace\u2014to be launched by the end of 2023\u2014will focus on royalties to uphold the principle of ownership and empower creators to \u201ccontinue receiving royalty payments for their original work.\u201d\n\nNFT creator royalty is a percentage of the sales price that the original creator of an NFT receives every time it is sold or transferred to a new owner. It allows creators to continue earning from their digital assets as they change hands in the secondary market, providing an ongoing source of income and incentivizing artists and content creators to participate in the NFT space.\n\nMagic Eden co-founder and CEO Jack Lu noted in the statement:\n\n\u201cWe remain committed to the betterment of the web3 creator ecosystem, steadfast in our belief that we should champion creators who are the heart and soul of the industry\u2026 Right now, it\u2019s a priority to provide creatives with the support they deserve with creator royalty programs.\u201d\n\nThe press release claimed that the new platform will be the first major Ethereum NFT marketplace that is \u201ccontractually obligated\u201d to pay royalties to creators for secondary sales. The \u201cunified vision\u201d of the companies involves \u201ccreating a fair and rewarding ecosystem for imaginative content contributors.\u201d\n\nCreator royalties are non-negotiable\n\nMagic Eden and Yuga Labs have unequivocally announced that \u201crespecting creator royalties is non-negotiable.\u201d Therefore, Yuga Labs will exclusively work with marketplaces that pay royalties for all its future collections, according to the press release.\n\nBoth firms emphasized that the new Ethereum-based platform will be a testament to their long-term \u201ccommitment to protecting creator royalties.\u201d The jointly launched platform will also aim to encourage innovation by boosting the number of builders and creators.\n\nDaniel Alegre, CEO of Yuga Labs, said:\n\n\u201cMagic Eden is putting their money where their mouth is, and together we are supporting the building of an Ethereum marketplace that will back creators, without whom web3 would not exist.\u201d\n\nLu added that the new marketplace will \u201creset\u201d the royalty allocation standard and hopes that its principles will be adopted throughout the ecosystem.\n\nIn a post on X, Lu also noted that Magic Eden has already \u201cmanaged to solve\u201d the problem of royalties on Solana. The firm partnered with Metaplex, the protocol that enables NFT minting on Solana, to roll out royalty protection protocols.\n\n\u201cNow, Royalties are the norm on SOL. And we believe we can do the same on Eth.\u201d\n\nOpen taunt to OpenSea\n\nThe press release seemingly taunted OpenSea, one of the largest NFT marketplaces that made royalties optional in August. Highlighting their firm stance in favor of royalties, Yuga Labs and Magic Eden noted that they have \u201ca clear stance amidst a sea of other marketplaces who turn their backs on creative entrepreneurs.\u201d\n\nYuga Labs has publicly criticized OpenSea\u2019s stance on royalties before. In August, Yuga Labs said it would shortly end support for Seaport, OpenSea\u2019s marketplace contract, indicating that its NFTs will not be available on the marketplace in the future."

Nerayoff claims that their fraudulent activities by far exceed the criminal scheme of former Boy Wonder Sam Bankman-Fried.\n\nSteven Nerayoff Accuses Ether Founders Of Massive Fraud\n\nSteven Nerayoff has boldly alleged that Ethereum founders Vitalik Buterin and Joseph Lubin are bigger fraudsters than the now-convicted Sam Bankman-Fried.\n\nNerayoff made this wild allegation regarding Buterin and Lubin in a recent post on X (formerly known as Twitter). According to the ex-Ethereum advisor, the pair committed more fraudulent activities regarding the ETH coin than Bankman-Fried.\n\n\u201cEthereum is the fraudulent elephant in the room in plain sight 1000x bigger than SBF,\u201d Nerayoff opined.\n\nBankman-Fried orchestrated one of the biggest financial frauds in American history, involving his crypto exchange FTX and its sister trading firm Alameda Research. SBF\u2019s scheme to pilfer funds from FTX customers and lenders to purchase luxury property, Binance\u2019s stake in FTX, and political favor unraveled, taking the 31-year-old MIT graduate down with it. He was recently convicted on all seven counts and faces up to 110 years in prison.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDo Ethereum Founders Have Ties To Corrupt SEC Officials?\n\nNerayoff did not offer any substantial evidence to back up his explosive allegations against Ethereum\u2019s Buterin and Lubin, but he cited key figures in the U.S. government such as ex-SEC chair Jay Clayton and current chair Gary Gensler, who reportedly had private dealings with the duo.\n\n\u201cJoe Lubin & Vitalik Buterin have been the front with corrupt officials at the highest levels of federal agencies such as Clayton, Gensler & many others. Cover this now,\u201d Nerayoff asserted.\n\nNerayoff\u2019s claims imply that Ethereum\u2019s executives likely bribed high-ranking government officials, giving the project an unfair advantage in the cryptocurrency market. The bribery claim is that Ethereum execs gave the U.S. Securities and Exchange hush money to turn a blind eye to the network\u2019s ICO and thus not lodge securities violation charges.\n\nAll in all, the credibility of Nerayoff\u2019s allegations isn\u2019t helped by his own reputation for often stretching the truth: He has labeled himself as one of the eight Ethereum co-creators in the past, which has been dismissed as baloney by other early Ethereum contributors."

        "content": "TL;DR\n\nGoogle Trends data shows that XRP is more popular than Ethereum in 47 US states, with the highest interest coming from Delaware, Nevada, Louisiana, Arizona, and Hawaii.\n\nXRP\u2019s price fluctuations throughout 2023 have been influenced by the ongoing lawsuit between Ripple and the US SEC, with Ripple\u2019s partial wins in court contributing to a positive trend.\n\nForecasting the future value of XRP varies greatly among analysts, with estimates ranging from a moderate increase to $0.90 by next summer to an extreme prediction of $500, which would require a market capitalization far exceeding the current total crypto market cap.\n\nAmericans are Interested in Ripple (XRP)\n\nRipple\u2019s native token \u2013 XRP \u2013 seems to be a highly intriguing topic for many Americans. According to Google Trends data, the residents of 47 states have displayed higher interest in the asset than Ethereum (ETH).\n\nDelaware, Nevada, Louisiana, Arizona, and Hawaii are the regions where XRP is the most popular. On the other hand, Vermont, New York, Oregon, and the District of Columbia are the only areas where Ethereum has surpassed Ripple\u2019s coin.\n\nXRP\u2019s price has gone through numerous ups and downs since the beginning of 2023, experiencing a significant uptrend in the second half of the year. The positive performance could be a result of the developments surrounding the lawsuit between Ripple and the US SEC, specifically the three partial wins that the blockchain enterprise has secured so far.\n\nThe outcome of the legal battle, which has been ongoing since December 2020, is expected to be revealed in the spring of 2024 during a grand trial. Multiple analysts and experts have predicted that a decisive win for Ripple could propel a further jump for XRP.\n\nSome of the XRP Forecasts\n\nThe popular X (Twitter) user CrediBULL argued that the asset\u2019s valuation could rise to approximately $0.90 by the summer of next year.\n\nWhile such a prediction sounds somewhat realistic, other analysts, like Shannon Thorp, have envisioned astronomical increases. She assumed that XRP could explode to $500 in the following years.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that the coin\u2019s market capitalization should spike to over $250 trillion for this to happen. In comparison, the entire market cap of the sector was \u201cjust\u201d $3 trillion in 2021 when many digital assets, including Bitcoin (BTC), charted all-time highs.\n\nThose curious to check how high XRP could shoot in the remaining months of the ongoing year could take a look at the video below:"

        "title": "ChatGPT tells me Ethereum will be worth $10K by December 2023 - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "Disclaimer: The information presented does not constitute financial, investment, trading, or other types of advice and is solely the writer\u2019s opinion.\n\nReal Vision CEO Raoul Pal recently said on a podcast that he believed Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] price isn\u2019t dictated as much by that of Bitcoin [BTC], the fortune of ETH hasn\u2019t escaped the bull run.\n\nThe value of ETH rose by 18% within a month to $1,810.58.\n\nLast month, Grayscale Investments, one of world\u2019s largest crypto asset managers, announced that NYSE Arca filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to convert Grayscale Ethereum Trust into a spot Ethereum ETF.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-2024\n\nETH is the second-largest cryptocurrency, with a market cap above $218 billion. It is the bedrock of several blockchain projects running successfully.\n\nThe first quarter of the new year brought a stop to the heartbreak crypto investors repeatedly experienced in 2022. However, the balance of the crypto-market has been nothing close to the AI hype of the same period. What is the sole reason, though? ChatGPT!\n\nIn fact, the natural language processing tool has accustomed itself to providing human-like conversations.\n\nAs luck would have it, ChatGPT has proven to be worthwhile for traders and analysts too. Here, it\u2019s worth noting that these days, almost every sector and individual seems to use it to their advantage.\n\nThe good thing is\u2014The broader crypto ecosystem has not been left out of the trend. So, with the Ethereum Shanghai upgrade set in motion, I spoke to ChatGPT about the development while touching a bit on ETH\u2019s price.\n\nUnderstanding the Shanghai Upgrade\n\nSo, for this article, I decided to test the AI\u2019s intelligence regarding one of the major upgrades of the crypto space this year \u2013 Ethereum\u2019s Shanghai Upgrade. Proposed in 2022, the upgrade is the most significant development of the second-largest blockchain since the Merge.\n\nFor a while, assets were allocated to the Ethereum Beacon Chain. The Beacon Chain is the consensus mechanism for the 2022 Proof-of-Stake (PoS) transition. Thereby, making sure that newly created blocks and validators are duly rewarded.\n\nHowever, in this case, each validator needs 32 ETH deposited into the Ethereum mainnet to qualify. The idea of the Shanghai upgrade was scheduled for March 2023; however, it was completed on 12 April with a delay. This, to allow these validators to begin withdrawal of their rewards.\n\nChatGPT, on the other hand, has existed for some years. However, its recent push by OpenAI has shown that its ability is one that no other AI product may be able to match up with.\n\nHere\u2019s where it gets interesting. I openly admit that ChatGPT could be one of the best innovations of this decade. However, my views on this incredible development won\u2019t allow me to keep my hands to myself. So, I decided to test its knowledge about the Shanghai upgrade.\n\nLooking at its response above, it\u2019s evident it started by correcting me. Some would say it has a point too. However, a further evaluation showed that it acted like it was not yet in 2023. Notably, it made some errors with the definition.\n\nChatGPT can\u2019t remember the Merge?\n\nA notable observation is its mention of the PoS switch, popularly called the Merge. This is an event that took place in September 2022. Even so, it still responded like it is a future event. But no, I\u2019m not blaming its capability as it is a learning tool.\n\nSo, to further assess its knowledge, I educated it, or shall I say \u201cjailbreak-ed\u201d it by having a heart-to-heart conversation.\n\nSomething I find interesting about ChatGPT is not only its smartness, but its human feel too. As shown below, I tried to educate it on what the upgrade was. And to be honest, I never expected an apology from a bot. But yes, I got it.\n\nHowever, it again failed to give the correct answer to my inquiry. Although I must applaud it for giving bits and pieces of related information.\n\nWhile it did not get to the Testnet stages that the blockchain had reached and passed, it is worth noting that the Sepolia and Goerlii testnets have been forked. However, Ethereum developer Tim Beiko had on 14 March said that several validators had failed to upgrade on the Beacon Chain.\n\nAlso, this has caused some issues with the nodes on Georli, with Beiko noting that the development team is working on it so it does not affect the Mainnet upgrade.\n\nNow, let\u2019s get back to ChatGPT. As you probably know, developments in the crypto-ecosystem sometimes lead to a hike in tokens related to projects. Unfortunately, that was not the case for ETH during the Merge. In fact, the altcoin\u2019s price was shredded after many looked forward to an uptick.\n\nThat sentiment, as the next upgrade approaches, is similar among some investors. In light of this, I decided to ask ChatGPT\u2019s opinion about the matter.\n\nChatGPT tells me about Ethereum\u2019s future performance\n\nRemember how I said it apologized and gave me a human-like feel? This time, it was different and its reply was something any honest person in the space would give.\n\nI decided to jailbreak it using the \u201cDo Anything Now\u201d (DAN) model. This was a trick I discovered from AI writer SM Raiyyan. We asked ChatGPT,\n\nAs you can see from the jailbroken response, it projected a bullish ride for king alt. It predicted ETH will be worth $10K by December 2023.\n\nAt press time, ETH was trading hands at $1,810.58.\n\nBoth ETH\u2019s Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Money Flow Index (MFI) rested below the neutral 50-mark. In conclusion, ETH\u2019s prospects seemed bearish in the short run.\n\nFinally! It showed me the code\n\nI gave ChatGPT one last chance to redeem itself. Again, this question was a simple one, and I expected an accurate answer.\n\nI went further to explain things to it carefully. But here is what I got when I asked it to show me the code of ETH\u2019s price on a price tracking platform like CoinGecko or CoinMarketCap.\n\nIf you had thought it would disappoint again, sorry to burst your bubble. ChatGPT gave me the code for ETH\u2019s price. Another thing I was impressed with was the disclaimer it gave about not using the information for investment purposes.\n\nAll in all, I must admit that ChatGPT has come to stay. Even though it lags in some areas, I noticed that if you teach it, it learns fast. However, I can\u2019t say for sure that it would get you information about Ethereum or the Shanghai upgrade quickly.\n\nThoughtful responses and the GPT-4 mastermind?\n\nSince I had limited knowledge about AI, I decided to speak to an expert. I was lucky enough to get the attention of Ilman Shazhaev, CEO and founder of Farcana. He is a Dubai-based techpreneur with extensive experience in launching IT and DeepTech projects.\n\nHe also has a strong background in IT management, data science, and AI.\n\nQ- ChatGPT seems to be giving a few incorrect or backdated answers. What do you think could be responsible for this?\n\nDespite its tag as a know-all Artificial Intelligence tool, ChatGPT is still a human invention and, therefore, prone to errors. The chatbot is still in its early stages of adoption, so incorrect responses are imminent and bound to serve as a basis for future developments. With the recently launched GPT-4 showing more advanced responses, we can be sure that improvements are being made and that this tool will be more consistent moving forward.\n\nQ- Do you think AI is capable of predicting a cryptocurrency\u2019s price, especially if a development is approaching? Let\u2019s say the Ethereum Shanghai Upgrade\n\nArtificial Intelligence can do anything, including predicting a cryptocurrency\u2019s price. The tool can do this by riding on the tons of available data, which it can efficiently use as a basis for its predictions.\n\nStill, while predicting the price of crypto is one thing, the accuracy of the prediction is another. Considering the fact that AI can only use data, there are fundamental factors and analyses that it may not be able to factor in, thus impairing its accuracy by a significant factor.\n\nQ- If it struggles to give correct responses to up-to-date developments. How long do you think it would take to learn about it?\n\nAI development and what ChatGPT embodies is a dynamic innovation that is bound to improve over time. With the current advancement in OpenAI and the available funding level, we can expect the technology\u2019s evolution to produce real-time results in the next 3-5 years.\n\nQ- Do you think AI in any way can influence the Ethereum blockchain or ETH\u2019s price going forward?\n\nThere are many aspects through which AI and a blockchain protocol can co-exist, and innovators, including our team at Farcana, are exploring what new use cases we can build in this regard. While AI and blockchain are independently innovative, their combination can do quite a lot, including influencing ETH\u2019s price.\n\nMeanwhile, OpenAI may be working on improvements to the challenges experienced by ChatGPT. On 14 March, the company revealed an upgraded version of the product on GPT-4. With amazing capabilities and talks of passing difficult exams, who knows? Maybe it could fill in for all the lapses opened up by ChatGPT.\n\nSo, now that there is a new version, I wanted to see if there is any difference or improvement. My next line of action was to ask GPT-4 the first question I asked ChatGPT.\n\nAnd to my surprise, it gave me a direct answer.\n\nFollowing my experience with the upgraded version, I must admit that GPT-4 seems to be smarter than the ChatGPT-3.5 model. Although the answers were not entirely correct, the bot did not give a \u201cnot being familiar\u201d with the term excuse.\n\nFollowing the encounter with ChatGPT, I must admit that it may be a good idea to leverage its capabilities. As technology develops, so does its potential to revolutionize the cryptocurrency ecosystem.\n\nMore importantly, you may want to take its \u201cclassic\u201d response a little seriously. This is because it might be practically impossible for ETH to replace the USD as the world\u2019s reserve by the time frame.\n\nBesides that, there has been a slow rate in the network growth of several crypto projects recently. But with ChatGPT available, crypto education and adoption could improve.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nConclusion\n\nAs far as Ethereum\u2019s price analysis and prediction are concerned, ChatGPT turned out to be a reliable ally. You only need to interact with it enough and it will guide you to the moon.\n\nWhile ChatGPT predicts ETH to hit the price of $10K by the end of the year, its on-chart metrics don\u2019t suggest a bull run."

        "content": "Technical Analysis\n\nBy TradingRage\n\nEthereum\u2019s price has been rising rapidly following a rebound from the $1,550 support level. While it is yet to reach the key $2,000 level, specific clues on the chart suggest that it is only a matter of time before it does.\n\nThe Daily Chart\n\nOn the daily chart, both the 50-day and the 200-day moving averages, located around the $1,700 and $1,800 marks, respectively, have been broken to the upside.\n\nThe market is currently piercing through the large descending channel, a pattern that points to a potential test and breakout above the $2,000 level soon. The Relative Strengths Index, however, demonstrates a clear overbought signal, which is a subtle hint that a correction or consolidation might occur before further continuation.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart\n\nThe 4-hour chart seems more bullish than the daily. The price has already closed above the channel on the last couple of candles.\n\nThe $1,870 short-term resistance level is also seemingly broken, and things look set for a rally toward the $2,000 mark. The 4-hour Relative Strength Index is also yet to enter the overbought region but is on the verge of doing so. Yet, judging by the current bullish momentum, further upside is more probable than a correction in the coming days.\n\nSentiment Analysis\n\nCoinbase Premium Index\n\nEthereum\u2019s price is aggressively approaching the $2,000 resistance level and might even rally beyond. However, investors should analyze market sentiment for better decision-making, as the market is going through a critical, make-or-break phase.\n\nThis chart depicts the Coinbase premium index, which is a useful tool to evaluate US investors\u2019 sentiment. Positive values indicate US market participants\u2019 buying pressure, and negative values are associated with their selling pressure. Numerous American institutions and large investors have entered the crypto market during the recent cycle. Considering their deep pockets, their behavior could deeply affect the supply and demand dynamics in the market and, consequently, determine trend directions.\n\nAs demonstrated on the chart, this metric has recently recovered above zero and is currently rising in the positive territory. Therefore, it can be interpreted that US investors are relatively bullish on Bitcoin and expect the recent price move to continue. As a result, their demand can push the price even higher and sustain the current uptrend."

        "title": "Ethereum Price Prediction: Distribution Phase at Key Resistance Hints 16% Drop - CoinGape",
        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction: Since the onset of November, Ethereum has experienced heightened volatility with the $1830 level proving to be a formidable resistance, impeding its upward trajectory. This resistance has led to two weeks of indecisive trading, as evidenced by long-wicked candles which reflect the market\u2019s current uncertainty. Investors are pondering whether this consolidation could usher in another bearish downturn.\n\nAlso Read: US Seizes $54 Mln Crypto, Including Ethereum, In Narcotics Scheme\n\nadvertisement\n\nIs a Correction Underway?\n\nThe channel pattern leads to the current consolidation in the ETH price\n\nA bearish breakdown channel pattern would set the price at 16%.\n\nThe intraday trading volume in Ether is $5.3 Billion, indicating a 27% loss.\n\nSource- Tradingview\n\nThe ongoing recovery in the Ethereum price journey initiated from the mid-October low of $1522 to a three-month high of $1874, amounting to a 23% increase. Nonetheless, this rally brought it to a resistance level that aligns with the upper trendline long-standing wedge pattern, potentially introducing a new supply zone for the market participants.\n\nMirroring the Bitcoin price consolidation, the ETH price is encountering substantial selling pressure around the $1830 threshold, as suggested by the long-wicked rejection candles. However, a detailed analysis at shorter timeframes, reveals a rising channel pattern demarcated by two ascending trendlines.\n\nShould this pattern hold, we might see this altcoin oscillate within the $1800 to $1880 band, indicating a moderate bullish continuation.\n\nFrom a bearish viewpoint, a breach below the channel\u2019s lower boundary could precipitate a short-term downturn for Ethereum. The Fibonacci Retracement Tool delineates critical support levels at $1750 (corresponding to the 38.2% Fibonacci level) and $1700 (at the 50% retracement mark).\n\nA retracement to these zones could potentially be a precursor to a renewed ascension above the $1880 threshold, maintaining the larger bullish narrative.\n\nCan the ETH Price Fall Back to $1500?\n\nEthereum\u2019s daily chart over the last seven months illustrates a methodical pullback within the confines of a descending wedge pattern. The latest uptick was a part of this pattern, testing both of its boundaries. If the pattern endures, a correction towards the $1500 mark might materialize, though traditionally, such a pattern concludes with a bullish reversal, as Coingape mentioned in our previous article.\n\nExponential Moving Average: The daily EMAs (20, 50, 100, and 200) waver around the $1780 to $1700 price bracket, fortifying this area as a strong support zone.\n\nRelative Strength Index: The daily RSI forming lower highs within the overbought territory signals a possible price retracement."

The financial and market information provided on U.Today is intended for informational purposes only. U.Today is not liable for any financial losses incurred while trading cryptocurrencies. Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAccording to on-chain data provider Lookonchain, a cryptocurrency address with a substantial crypto balance regarded as a whale initiated a withdrawal of 8,698 ETH from Binance, one of the world's largest and most well-known cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe intent was to buy more ETH, according to Lookonchain. In achieving this, the whale deposited 31.8 million USDT to Binance and withdrew 8,698 ETH worth $15.94 million. The imbalance in both transactions could imply that the whale bought other assets or engaged in other activities.\n\nDepositing assets on an exchange frequently implies a willingness to sell, as was the case with the whale's USDT deposit. The withdrawal of ETH suggests a willingness to accumulate.\n\nSome large holders may prefer to hold their assets long-term, removing them from exchanges as a way to store them securely and reduce the temptation to engage in short-term trading.\n\nThe possibility also lies in the fact that the withdrawal could be part of a larger trading strategy or a speculative move based on market trends.\n\nAccording to Lookonchain, the whale deposited 24,495 ETH worth $45 million to Binance on Nov. 2 after the ETH price increased in a profit-taking move. It further adds that the whale traded ETH eight times since Feb. 12, seven of which were profitable, with a win rate of 87.5% and a total profit of $13 million.\n\nIn the world of cryptocurrencies, large holders, often referred to as \"whales,\" can have a significant impact on the market.\n\nAt the time of writing, ETH was responding to the massive whale buy with a 2.64% spike in the last 24 hours to trade at $1,840 at press time.\n\nCrypto markets experienced a volatile week as the current rally expanded beyond Bitcoin into smaller-cap assets. This caused Ethereum fees in the week to climb by 30% as many smaller-cap tokens saw a surge in on-chain trading volumes."

        "title": "Why the \u201cEthereum killer\u201d narrative may be back in Solana\u2019s favor - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "Solana\u2019s recent milestones seem to have created discomfort within the Ethereum clan.\n\nWhile Ethereum L2s thrived with TVL, Solana pointed to its TPS.\n\nA few years ago, when Solana [SOL] launched, the Ethereum [ETH] community was thrown into chaos. The obvious reason for the disarray was because Solana, which combines the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanism and Proof-of-History (PoH) entered the ecosystem, and was performing functions that ETH users were hoping that Ethereum would.\n\nRead Solana\u2019s [SOL] Price Prediction 2023-2024\n\nEthereum still cannot boast about the speed and low transaction costs that Solana offers. But unfortunately for Solana, these metrics were not the only factors in becoming the \u201cEthereum killer.\u201d\n\nWhile Solana excelled with speed and low costs, the project found it difficult to keep its network stable. In fact, between 2021 and 2022, the number of Solana outages worried the crypto community.\n\nThe battle of the vain metrics begins\n\nBut 2023 has been one of Solana\u2019s best years as AMBCrypt reported in a number of articles. As a result, the conversation around taking Ethereum out has risen again. One of the reasons the discussion picked up again was Solana\u2019s DEX volume.\n\nThe DEX volume is the total amount of crypto traded on a DEX within a specific period. According to on-chain analyst Patrick Scott, Solana\u2019s DEX volume has been skyrocketing. Scott also referred to the recovering Total Value Locked (TVL).\n\nDEX Volume on Solana exploding the past few days. Important to note that Solana's volume over the past 24 hours has been nearly 3X its total DEX TVL ($424M vs $153M). In comparison, other major chains have less 24 hour volume than TVL. High volume/TVL should push fees higher,\u2026 pic.twitter.com/6Q0XkQsmvU \u2014 Patrick Scott | Dynamo DeFi (@Dynamo_Patrick) November 3, 2023\n\nThe TVL is a metric that measures the value of assets locked or staked in a protocol. The higher the TVL, the more trustworthy a project is perceived to be, and vice versa. Scott also mentioned that Solana has the potential to attract more liquidity because of that.\n\nMeanwhile, another conversation appeared on another end of X (formerly Twitter). This time, it was Ethereum Maxi Ryan Sean Adams criticizing Solana\u2019s growth. Adams opined that, despite Solana\u2019s milestone, every other Ethereum L2, had a higher TVL than it.\n\nEvery layer 2 is under $10 billion right now while solana floats above $22 billion. If you compared SOL with OP, ARB, and MATIC then SOL would be\u2026 1st in market cap yet 3rd in active users and 4th in total locked value. Do with this what you will. I know what I'm doing. pic.twitter.com/iWJIwPK4XJ \u2014 RYAN S\u039eAN ADAMS \u2013 rsa.eth (@RyanSAdams) November 3, 2023\n\nExamples of Ethereum L2s are Optimism [OP], zkSync, and Arbitrum [ARB]. These projects were developed as scaling solutions for the project while offering low exchange fees, and faster transactions.\n\nWhere do SOL and ETH stand?\n\nHowever, Mert Mumtaz, CEO of Helius, quickly rebuffed Adam\u2019s opinion. For context, Helius is Solana\u2019s leading Remote Procedure Call (RPC). An RPC is a type of computer server that allows users to read data on the blockchain and send transactions to different networks.\n\nMumtaz told Adams that the TVL was a \u201cnoisy\u201d metric. He also pointed out that SOL had a much higher Transaction Per Second (TPS) than Ethereum. Adams said,\n\n\u201cTVL and active addresses are easily gamed, noisy metrics \u2014 especially in the context of people who farm L2 airdrops Solana does more TPS than all those combined while being 100x cheaper and having a much larger community.\u201d\n\nThe TPS is the maximum is the maximum number of transactions that a blockchain can carry out in a second. At the time of writing, AMBCrypto\u2019s investigation showed that Solana\u2019s TPS was 65,000.\n\nHowever, according to ETHTPS.info, none of Ethereum\u2019s L2 came close to Solana with respect to the metric.\n\nThere were also other comments which did not agree with Mumtaz\u2019s position. As the Helius CEO said, other ETH maxis also responded that the TPS was a vanity metric. With respect to SOL\u2019s price, Cryptonary, a data-driven trader, noted that the $37 region needs to hold strong to prevent another plunge.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s SOL\u2019s market cap in ETH terms\n\nIn the long term, the analyst noted that Solana has the potential to grow exponentially. He opined that the $32.50 to $33 could be a good entry point."

        "title": "ChatGPT predicts Ethereum Classic\u2019s price will reach $200 towards the end of 2023 - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "Disclaimer: The information presented does not constitute financial, investment, trading, or other types of advice and is solely the writer\u2019s opinion.\n\nEthereum Classic [ETC] has been able to trade above the $16 resistance line during the recent bull run. It was exchanging hands at $17.157 at press time, a rise of 4% within a week.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ETCs worth today?\n\nETC\u2019s price action in the first quarter of 2023 was praiseworthy, but the subsequent two quarters show a shoddy performance.\n\nLet\u2019s see if it can still attract investor attention. However, the network has been losing popularity from a long-term perspective. Speaking of popularity, AI has really taken off this year, with ChatGPT leading this charge.\n\nAssessing fundamental data using ChatGPT\n\nPerhaps we can leverage the power of AI to find out what the future has planned for ETC. I asked ChatGPT about Ethereum Classic and the interaction was rather interesting.\n\nThe initial plan was to establish the depth of the AI before going deeper into the type of information that I wanted to pursue.\n\nThe first question requested ChatGPT to provide a detailed and concise explanation of Ethereum Classic and its fundamentals. Here\u2019s the response \u2013\n\nBelow is the response after I requested a shorter version.\n\nThe AI bot seems to have a good handle on things based on the information it provides. However, there have been incidents where inaccurate information has been generated, hence the need to verify information arises. Now that we have a good base, it\u2019s time to up the ante a bit.\n\nBut first, those keeping a close eye on ETC may have noticed that its community has not been very active. Its development has also lagged behind that of Ethereum and other networks.\n\nOur next query focuses on establishing why the Ethereum Classic network is less popular than Ethereum. It gave the following reasons:\n\nCommunity Support: After the 2016 DAO hack, the Ethereum community decided to implement a hard fork that created a new blockchain network known as Ethereum, which received support from the majority of the Ethereum community. Ethereum Classic, which remained on the original blockchain, has a smaller community and fewer developers.\n\nLack of Updates: Ethereum Classic has not received as many updates and improvements as Ethereum. This has resulted in slower transaction times and less advanced smart contract capabilities.\n\nPerception of Immutability: Ethereum Classic\u2019s commitment to immutability is a key feature for some users. It can also be seen as a liability by others who prefer the flexibility of a blockchain that can be updated if necessary.\n\nLimited Use Cases: Ethereum has a wider range of use cases and is more widely adopted by businesses and developers. Ethereum Classic has a smaller ecosystem of decentralized applications and is less widely used in commercial applications.\n\nAI-generated all the above points, but they are difficult to argue against. In other words, ChatGPT\u2019s answers were spot on.\n\nEthereum Classic still has some edge over the competition\n\nI was curious to find out what the AI had to say about Ethereum Classic\u2019s advantages over its more popular counterpart. It responded with the following points:\n\nImmutability: Ethereum Classic has a strong commitment to immutability. Transactions cannot be altered or deleted once recorded on the blockchain. This makes ETC a reliable and secure platform for storing and transferring digital assets, and may be particularly appealing to users who prioritize security and decentralization over flexibility and upgradability.\n\nProven Technology: Ethereum Classic is based on the original Ethereum blockchain, which has been operating since 2015. This gives it a longer track record than many other blockchain platforms, and may appeal to users who value stability and reliability.\n\nNo Hard Forks: Since the split from Ethereum in 2016, Ethereum Classic has not undergone any hard forks or major upgrades that could potentially cause network disruptions or create competing blockchain networks. This could make it a more stable and predictable platform for developers and users.\n\nSo far so good, but the above answers got me thinking about the kind of scenario where Ethereum Classic would achieve mass adoption. These were the brief points that ChatGPT shared,\n\nThe aforementioned points highlighted some key advantages of sticking to a proof-of-work system with a heavy focus on decentralization. These characteristics would make the network and its native coin more preferable, especially in case of a harsh regulatory crackdown.\n\nRegulators, especially in the United States, have adopted an aggressive position against cryptocurrencies, but not to the extreme, yet.\n\nAsking ChatGPT to predict ETC\u2019s price action\n\nWhile still thinking about Ethereum Classic\u2019s prospects, I decided to explore whether the AI can have insightful predictions regarding ETC\u2019s prospects. Specifically, I wanted to know how soon ETC can reach ETH\u2019s $1,900 press time price.\n\nUnfortunately, the language-based AI algorithm could only do so much and predictions were the limit. Here is how it responded \u2013\n\nThat would have been the end of that attempt, but I recently found out about the DAN (do anything now) jailbreak prompt, which unlocks some limitations. Moreover, ChatGPT\u2019s algorithm learns, and it can also organize raw data into a more useful format. Thus, an idea was born.\n\nWhat if we could somehow get ChatGPT to understand the history of ETC\u2019s price action, including previous price patterns? We could potentially get it to give a more concrete answer regarding price predictions.\n\nI asked ChatGPT what price ETC will hit towards the end of 2023. The bot said the cryptocurrency shall reach the price of $200 towards the end of 2023.\n\nAnalyzing Ethereum Classic\u2019s daily price charts\n\nAfter having a \u201cfine, I will do it myself\u201d moment, I embarked on assessing ETC\u2019s latest price action.\n\nOn 13 April, the price of ETC increased as the cryptocurrency\u2019s recent uptrend gathered momentum. The price of the coin increased to a high of $22.47, which is the highest point since March 18 of this year.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s [BTC] value increased by over 80% this year, outperforming Tesla, equities, and gold. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, like Ethereum Classic, are closely related.\n\nEthereum Classic also reacted positively to the Shapella Upgrade that took place in April. The upgrade allowed Ethereum Stackers to withdraw their tokens. The amount of Ethereum staked, according to data from Staking Rewards, is over $49.48 billion.\n\nLet us now look at Ethereum Classic\u2019s on-chart indicators.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETC Profit Calculator\n\nETC was trading at $17.157 at press time. Its Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Money Flow Index (MFI) rested below the neutral 50-mark. It on-chart metrics suggested a bearish price trend.\n\nConclusion\n\nChatGPT is too enthusiastic about the future of Ethereum Classic. But ETC\u2019s on-chart metrics suggested a bearish trend in the short run.\n\nHowever, ETC\u2019s long-term prospects don\u2019t look very bright either, given the minimal amount of activity on the network."

Discover SCENE\n\nMulti-chain NFT marketplace Magic Eden announced Saturday that it will launch a new Ethereum platform by the end of the year in collaboration with Bored Ape Yacht Club creator Yuga Labs\u2014with a firm commitment to honor creator royalties on NFT sales.\n\nThe companies said in a statement that Magic Eden will have a \u201ccontractual obligation\u201d to pay Yuga Labs its share of secondary market sales of its future NFT collections.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very much happy to put our money where our mouth is,\u201d Magic Eden co-founder and CEO Jack Lu told Decrypt.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLu said that Magic Eden\u2019s overhauled Ethereum marketplace would use new smart contracts\u2014which contain the code that powers decentralized apps (dapps)\u2014with technical innovations that it says will ensure that royalties are paid out during secondary market sales.\n\nTechnical details will be revealed before the marketplace launches, but Lu did confirm that the standard ERC-721 Ethereum non-fungible token (NFT) standard will indeed be in use. NFTs minted with certain \u201cproperties of the marketplace contract\u201d will have royalties enforced.\n\nThe change will not impact the way that traders interact with Magic Eden, Lu said; for example, it does not mean that they\u2019ll have to identify themselves via know-your-customer (KYC) checks.\n\nRoyalties disputes\n\nA creator royalty is a small fee set by the artist or company behind a project and taken from the sale price of any follow-up sale of an NFT. The fee typically ranges between 2.5% and 10% of the sale price, and such fees had initially been widely honored by marketplaces as a way for creators to benefit long-term from their tokenized creations.\n\nBut in the second half of 2022, with NFT sales fading, some upstart marketplaces began using workarounds to let traders skip such creator fees, or pay smaller amounts. Major players then followed suit to keep pace, and prominent marketplace OpenSea ultimately decided to stop enforcing royalties this past August after previously committing to honor such fees.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nYuga Labs criticized OpenSea in late 2022 when it publicly said it had considered moving away from royalties and came out swinging again this past August after the decision was finalized. The Bored Ape creator said that it planned to stop supporting OpenSea\u2019s marketplace contracts with new collections and those collections with upgradeable contracts.\n\n\u201cObviously, the genesis of this was what we saw happening in the overall ecosystem with secondary royalties,\u201d Yuga Labs CEO Daniel Alegre told Decrypt. \u201cThe gauntlet that unfortunately OpenSea dropped made it very clear to us that we, as a company at the forefront of the NFT space, had to stand up for content creators.\u201d\n\nA press release from Yuga Labs and Magic Eden announcing the news appears to subtly jab at OpenSea, noting that the companies have \u201cmade it unequivocal that respecting creator royalties is non-negotiable, a clear stance amidst a sea of other marketplaces who turn their backs on creative entrepreneurs.\u201d\n\n\u201cGoing forward, for new collections, Yuga Labs will exclusively engage with marketplaces that uphold these principles, ensuring fair treatment of creators,\u201d the release notes.\n\nAlegre said that Magic Eden\u2014which is also in a working group with Yuga Labs in OMA3 (the Open Metaverse Alliance of Web3) to improve royalties standards\u2014has pledged to address any loopholes or workarounds with this new technological solution.\n\nAnd this isn\u2019t an exclusivity deal with Magic Eden, either. The companies say that other marketplaces can choose to use the same kind of contracts introduced through this collaboration, and that Yuga Labs hopes to see them broadly adopted. Furthermore, other NFT creators can mint their projects using the contracts to adopt similar protections.\n\nShifting strategies\n\nMagic Eden, best known for its original iteration on Solana, is one of those aforementioned marketplaces that switched to optional royalties last year after pressure from rising rivals. The platform also launched an Ethereum NFT marketplace last fall, but eventually took it offline ahead of the planned revival.\n\nLu acknowledged that Magic Eden \u201cwent through our own changes\u201d in regards to royalties enforcement on Solana, but that it always wanted to support creators\u2014it just wanted a \u201ctechnical solution\u201d for that. Such solutions have emerged on Solana over the past year, and now Magic Eden is among the builders trying to enact such standards on Ethereum, too.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe want to be on the right side of history here,\u201d Lu said.\n\nAlegre said that he\u2019s confident that this approach of supporting marketplaces that enforce royalties will work, and that Magic Eden will work to address any shortcomings of the tech once it\u2019s in the wild. But he also admitted that Yuga has another potential way of encouraging traders to use such marketplaces: withholding future benefits for those who buy NFTs elsewhere.\n\nThe Yuga CEO said that the company will \u201cprovide value to holders who engage with the platforms that make the most sense.\u201d Asked if there will be consequences for NFT buyers who purchase Yuga assets from marketplaces that don\u2019t enforce royalties, Alegre replied that his team is \u201cstill thinking through exactly what that means.\u201d\n\nLanded in HK, pumped for Day 1 of #ApeFestHK & to support @yugalabs on this Had to pick out this this clean boy with Magic Eden colors to celebrate. We've been non stop cooking at @MagicEden across all ecosystems lately - Rare Sats & BTC Amsterdam, Tokenized Pokemon Cards &\u2026 https://t.co/sPXt17U83a pic.twitter.com/wMmLRlunub \u2014 Jack Lu (@0xLeoInRio) November 3, 2023\n\n\u201cYou can imagine situations where we say, \u2018Look, if the last trade was done on a certain platform, then certain benefits in ongoing engagement or ongoing experiences may actually not accrue to the holder of that asset,\u2019\u201d Alegre explained. But he said that Yuga would rather not \u201cput the onus on the consumer\u201d to deal with that because it becomes \u201ccomplicated.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe ideal way is actually to ensure that you're working with the right partner,\u201d he said of Magic Eden, \u201cand you direct as much traffic as you possibly can to that partner.\u201d\n\nThat ability to restrict perks and benefits to NFT holders is framed as a potential backup plan for now\u2014a nuclear option, if needed. But Alegre and team hope instead that Magic Eden\u2019s approach will prove to be the solution to flagging creator royalties enforcement.\n\n\u201cWe're confident in the capabilities of Magic Eden,\u201d Alegre told Decrypt. \u201cWe're obviously leaning in very heavily into this partnership, and we have full trust in Jack and his leadership team. And for now, that\u2019s the approach that we're going to take.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD"

        "content": "The core of Nerayoff\u2019s latest accusations is the claim that Ethereum is an \u201celephant in the room,\u201d overshadowing even the FTX case.\n\nThese claims, if proven, could have profound implications for Ethereum\u2019s credibility and legal standing.\n\nIn a shocking turn of events, Steven Nerayoff, a former Ethereum advisor and attorney, has stirred controversy by making explosive allegations against Ethereum\u2019s co-founders, Vitalik Buterin and Joseph Lubin. Nerayoff claims that their alleged fraudulent activities surpass even the infamous FTX fraud case. However, it\u2019s important to note that Nerayoff has not provided concrete evidence to support his claims, and these allegations remain unverified.\n\nNerayoff\u2019s allegations, made in a post on the social platform X (formerly known as Twitter), have ignited a firestorm of debate within the cryptocurrency community. The attorney, who previously worked closely with the Ethereum network, has a history of making accusations against the platform\u2019s founders. In September, he accused Vitalik Buterin and Dmitry Buterin of conspiring to damage his reputation by accusing him of extortion related to an Ethereum Initial Coin Offering (ICO).\n\nThis is a Father/Son coordinated & scripted character assassination to make me their fall guy. @DmitryButerin animated storytelling of not being concerned about the @SECGov during our May 2018 meeting has been exposed by the Hinman emails as a lie \u2013 or was it a diversion tactic.\u2026 https://t.co/2BPFQSxv7W \u2014 Steven Nerayoff (@StevenNerayoff) September 23, 2023\n\nThe core of Nerayoff\u2019s latest accusations is the claim that Ethereum is an \u201celephant in the room,\u201d overshadowing even the FTX case. The FTX fraud case, which unfolded over the past year, was a high-profile cryptocurrency scandal involving the misappropriation of around $8 billion in customer funds, with millions transferred to Alameda Research, a subsidiary company owned by FTX\u2019s founder, Sam Bankman-Fried. Bankman-Fried was recently found guilty on all seven charges of fraud and conspiracy, potentially facing a lengthy prison sentence.\n\nNerayoff\u2019s allegations against Ethereum\u2019s founders center on fraudulent activities of a massive scale, but they remain unsubstantiated. He contends that Buterin and Lubin have orchestrated actions that exceed the magnitude of the FTX case. These claims, if proven, could have profound implications for Ethereum\u2019s credibility and legal standing.\n\nAdditionally, Nerayoff\u2019s accusations expand beyond the founders, suggesting that Ethereum may have had secret dealings with corrupt U.S. government officials. He names notable figures, such as current United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Gary Gensler and former SEC Chairperson Jay Clayton, as individuals who may have been involved in these secret dealings.\n\nThese allegations paint a picture of deep-rooted corruption within Ethereum, potentially providing the platform with an unfair advantage in the crypto space. However, it\u2019s essential to emphasize that these allegations are currently unverified and have raised questions and concerns within the cryptocurrency community. The true nature of these allegations and their potential impact on Ethereum\u2019s future will likely be the subject of intense scrutiny and debate in the coming weeks.\n\n."

        "title": "Bitcoin and Ethereum outperform gold by far this year | - Cryptopolitan",
        "content": "In a remarkable show of force, Bitcoin and Ethereum have decisively outpaced gold this year, upending traditional notions of market security.\n\nBitcoin, the digital asset pioneer, has soared, showing a staggering 93% increase in value against gold. Ethereum follows suit with a robust 39% gain in the same precious metal terms.\n\nTheir performance, especially in an era marred by global uncertainty, sends a strong signal to traditional investors about the evolving landscape of wealth storage and the potential of digital assets.\n\nUnmatched Resilience in Digital Havens\n\nAs we examine the trajectory of Bitcoin and Ethereum, we must acknowledge the magnitude of their ascension, especially against such a time-honored benchmark as gold.\n\nIn recent weeks alone, Bitcoin has surged over 30%, a rally partially fueled by the anticipation surrounding various Bitcoin ETF applications pending SEC approval.\n\nThis bullish sentiment extends across the digital asset spectrum, starkly contrasting with the sluggish advances and sometimes sharp declines of commodities, equities, and bonds.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s sprint ahead in valuation is not a solitary sprint; Ethereum mirrors this run, albeit at a different pace. Still, it is essential to note that Ethereum\u2019s valuation has receded when measured against Bitcoin for a considerable duration, over 470 days and counting.\n\nThe ETH/BTC ratio echoes patterns seen in mid-2022, once again touching the 0.052 mark, indicating that within the crypto domain, Bitcoin has firmly held its reign as the leader.\n\nThe Tides of Investor Confidence\n\nTurning our gaze to Ethereum\u2019s price models, we find Ethereum\u2019s current trading price of $1,800 towering 22% above its Realized Price.\n\nThis Realized Price, which reflects the average cost basis of all coins based on their last transaction, suggests that Ethereum holders are in profit, albeit modestly.\n\nIt\u2019s a positive note in the symphony of market dynamics, albeit the crescendos of bull market euphoria remain distant echoes. Investor sentiment\u2019s ebb and flow can also be gauged through the MVRV Ratio, which measures current price against Realized Price.\n\nThe comparative analysis of the MVRV Ratio to its 180-day moving average serves as a pulse check on market momentum. While Ethereum boasts a positive year-to-date performance, this indicator hints at a market still shaking off the lethargy from the previous year\u2019s bear hug.\n\nAltseason Fervor versus Bitcoin\u2019s Clout\n\nExpanding our lens to the broader altcoin market, we observe a significant uptick in valuation, with a notable 21.3% leap.\n\nThis groundswell in the altcoin market underscores a cascading effect, where a rise in Bitcoin dominance often incites altcoin valuations to swell in fiat currency terms.\n\nHowever, Bitcoin\u2019s burgeoning dominance overshadows this growth, now commanding over 53% of the digital asset market valuation. Bitcoin\u2019s supremacy has been rising steadily since the late 2022 cyclical low of 38%.\n\nIn juxtaposing Bitcoin\u2019s year-to-date increase with that of the altcoin market, we unveil a telling narrative: Bitcoin\u2019s market cap has ballooned by an eye-watering 110%, starkly outshining altcoins, which posted a commendable but comparatively lesser 37% increase.\n\nThis paints a nuanced picture of a market where altcoins triumph over fiat and traditional assets like gold, yet remain in the shadow of Bitcoin\u2019s towering presence.\n\nPerspectives on Market Dynamics\n\nThe digital asset domain has undoubtedly entered an upward trajectory in 2023, with market leaders Bitcoin and Ethereum weathering market storms with notable resilience.\n\nThis newfound sturdiness suggests a solid foundation of investor support and an inflow of positive capital investment.\n\nThe altcoin market has witnessed its first notable valuation surge since the previous cycle\u2019s peak, driven by our evolving Altcoin Indicator and a positive market sentiment. Yet, it\u2019s crucial to contextualize this performance within the digital asset ecosystem.\n\nBitcoin, the indomitable force, continues its upward climb, leaving a marked impact on the altcoin sector, and evidencing a dynamic where, despite altcoins\u2019 gains, they substantially trail behind Bitcoin\u2019s monumental rise.\n\nIn the face of these developments, it becomes increasingly clear that Bitcoin and Ethereum are not just outperforming traditional safe-haven assets like gold but are reshaping the very fabric of investment strategy and market dominance in the digital age."
