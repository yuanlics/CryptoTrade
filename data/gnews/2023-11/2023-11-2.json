        "content": "A new report from on-chain analytics firm Glassnode highlights the strong performance of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) compared to traditional markets in 2023.\n\nAccording to a Nov. 1 Glassnode report, Bitcoin has appreciated 93% against gold so far this year. When priced in gold, Bitcoin is trading at the highest levels since September 2021, right before the major crypto market correction. The data illustrates Bitcoin\u2019s potential as a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty.\n\nEthereum has also significantly outperformed gold in 2023, appreciating 39% against the precious metal. Glassnode notes that in 2023 ETH and BTC returns have been tightly correlated on a 30-day rolling basis, experiencing similar magnitude drawdowns but with Bitcoin seeing stronger performance during uptrends.\n\nNotably, both Bitcoin and Ethereum have also experienced relatively shallow corrections compared to prior crypto cycles. Glassnode highlights that Bitcoin\u2019s maximum drawdown in 2023 has only been 20.1%, compared to over 60% corrections in previous bull markets. For Ethereum, the deepest drawdown has been 44% against the US dollar, much less than the over 60% downturns seen in previous market cycles.\n\nThis data suggests there is growing investor support and more positive capital inflows into Bitcoin and Ethereum this cycle. The coins are not seeing the same extreme volatility and selling pressure compared to the past.\n\nHowever, Glassnode points out that within crypto markets, Bitcoin dominance continues to increase in 2023. Bitcoin\u2019s market capitalization has grown 110% year-to-date, compared to a 37% increase for the altcoin market cap excluding stablecoins. While altcoins have rallied against the dollar recently, Bitcoin remains the clear leader in terms of capital rotation between digital assets.\n\nRead more: Why everyone is talking about Solana in 2023\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "content": "Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC), Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) and Dogecoin (CRYPTO: DOGE) were trading relatively flat during Friday\u2019s trading session on lower-than-average volume despite the general market surging following the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision Wednesday to hold interest rates steady.\n\nThe three popular cryptos have been consolidating since Oct. 24, after Bitcoin, Ethereum and Dogecoin surged on hopes the Security and Exchange Commission is close to approving a spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nFrom a technical analysis standpoint, the cryptos have been consolidating near highly important technical levels, with Bitcoin trading under strong resistance at the $36,000 mark and Ethereum and Dogecoin moving horizontally above the 200-day simple moving average (SMA).\n\nThe 200-day SMA is an important bellwether. Technical traders and investors consider a stock trading above the level on the daily chart to be in a bull cycle, whereas a stock trading under the 200-day SMA is considered to be in a bear cycle.\n\nThe 50-day SMA also plays an important role in technical analysis, especially when paired with the 200-day. When the 50-day SMA crosses below the 200-day SMA, a death cross occurs whereas when the 50-day SMA crosses above the 200-day, a bullish golden cross takes place.\n\nWant direct analysis? Find me in the BZ Pro lounge! Click here for a free trial.\n\nThe Bitcoin Chart: Bitcoin has been consolidating sideways on lower-than-average volume, while rejecting the important $36,000 mark on each attempt. The consolidation has been taking place on declining volume, which is often followed by a burst in high volume.\n\nThe sideways consolidation is helping to lower Bitcoin\u2019s relative strength index (RSI), which has been trading above the 70% level since Oct. 19. When a stock\u2019s or crypto\u2019s RSI is above 70%, it\u2019s considered to be overbought, which can be a sell signal for technical traders.\n\nBullish traders want to see Bitcoin\u2019s RSI continue to lower and then for big bearish volume to come in and break the crypto up through $36,000, which could accelerate a move to the upside toward $40,000. Bearish traders want to see big bearish volume come in and break Bitcoin down below the eight-day exponential moving average, which would negate the crypto\u2019s current uptrend.\n\nIt should be noted that a golden cross, which occurs when the 50-day SMA crosses above the 200-day, formed on Bitcoin\u2019s chart on Oct. 29, which suggests the crypto is in a strong bull cycle.\n\nBitcoin has resistance above at $35,593 and at $38,105 and support below at $31,862 and at $31,418.\n\nThe Ethereum and Dogecoin Charts: Ethereum and Dogecoin have been consolidating sideways near the 200-day SMA, with Ethereum trading sideways above that area and Dogecoin under it. Both Ethereum and Dogecoin have been consolidating near the 200-day on decreasing volume, which like Bitcoin, indicates a larger move in one direction is on the horizon.\n\nWhile Ethereum is trading in an uptrend within its consolidating pattern, Dogecoin is trading in a tightening range, forming a triangle formation. If the cryptos break bullishly from their respective patterns, a more powerful move to the upside could be in the cards.\n\nBearish traders want to see Ethereum break down under the 200-day SMA and for Dogecoin to break down from the lower ascending trendline of the triangle. If either of those two things happens, downside pressure is likely to accelerate.\n\nEthereum has resistance above at $1,825 and at $1,937 and support below at $1,717 and at $1,615.\n\nDogecoin has resistance above at $0.069 and at $0.075 and support below at $0.065 and at $0.061.\n\nRead Next: Jack Dorsey's Block And Michael Saylor's MicroStrategy Are Both Big On Bitcoin \u2014 But Here's The Real Winner - MicroStrategy\n\n\u00a9 2023 Benzinga.com.

        "content": "ProShares, a prominent player in the crypto-linked exchange-traded fund (ETF) market, launched the first short Ethereum (ETH) ETF on Nov. 2.\n\nThe ProShares Short Ether Strategy ETF (SETH) is the world\u2019s first short ETH-linked ETF, designed to provide investors with an opportunity to profit when the price of Ether experiences a decline.\n\nSETH will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange and has been strategically developed to deliver the inverse of the daily performance of the S&P CME Ether Futures Index. Like the other ProShares crypto-linked ETFs, SETH seeks exposure through ETH futures contracts.\n\nProShares CEO Michael L. Sapir said:\n\n\u201cSETH is designed to address the challenge of acquiring short exposure to ether, which can be onerous and expensive. With today\u2019s launch of SETH, ProShares now offers investors opportunities to profit both on days when ether increases and when it drops\u2014all through the convenience of a traditional brokerage account.\u201d\n\nRisks\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that investments in cryptocurrency-related assets come with unique risks. Both bitcoin and ether, along with their respective futures, represent relatively new asset classes and are subject to rapid changes and uncertainty, according to the press release.\n\nProShares added that its actively managed ETFs, including BITO, EETH, BETH, and BETE, face additional challenges associated with using futures contracts, imperfect benchmark correlation, leverage, and market price variance. These factors can increase volatility and affect performance. Notably, SETH is expected to experience losses when the daily price of ether futures rises.\n\nInvestors interested in these ETFs should know that shares are generally bought and sold at market price, not Net Asset Value (NAV), and are not individually redeemed from the fund. It\u2019s also essential to consider brokerage commissions, which may reduce overall returns.\n\nSubdued interest\n\nDespite the launch of the ProShares Short Ether Strategy ETF (SETH), interest in ether futures ETFs remains subdued. The six ETH-based futures ETFs introduced recently have a combined AUM of around $20 million.\n\nExperts suggest investors might be waiting for spot exposure to Ethereum, which the SEC could consider approving by May.\n\nThe macroeconomic environment during the launch of ether futures ETFs may have contributed to their modest performance, unlike the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO), which debuted during a bullish Bitcoin period and quickly amassed assets.\n\nThe simultaneous approval of multiple ether futures ETFs from different providers may have diluted their impact. However, the launch of SETH underscores the industry\u2019s commitment to innovative crypto-linked investment opportunities.\n\nAs optimism grows for spot Bitcoin ETF approval, it\u2019s expected that spot ether ETFs could follow, rendering ether futures ETFs potentially \u201cobsolete.\u201d\n\nThe SEC has until Jan. 10 to rule on a proposed spot Bitcoin ETF, and a decision on spot ether ETFs could follow in May. Several companies are awaiting SEC approval for spot ether ETFs, setting the stage for increased diversity in cryptocurrency investments."

        "title": "Should You Buy Ethereum While It's Below $2,000? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Despite being up nearly 50% for the year, Ethereum (ETH 1.80%) seems to have fallen out of favor with investors. While other cryptos have been soaring in value of late, Ethereum has not. Currently trading at just under $1,800, Ethereum has repeatedly failed to surge past the $2,000 price mark this year and is now significantly underperforming Bitcoin (BTC 4.25%).\n\nAll of which makes Ethereum an intriguing investment right now. It's still the second-largest digital asset in the world (trailing only Bitcoin), and there are at least two good reasons Ethereum's price could start to move upward as we head into 2024.\n\nThe clear market leader\n\nFirst and foremost, Ethereum is still the 800-pound gorilla of the blockchain world. Ever since it pioneered the concept of smart contracts back in 2015, Ethereum has consistently been the first to market with just about every new blockchain innovation. And that has given Ethereum an enviable first-mover advantage in key areas such as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and decentralized finance (DeFi).\n\nIn both areas, Ethereum is still the clear leader. For example, Ethereum is responsible for an eye-popping 54% of total value locked (TVL), arguably the single-best metric for measuring overall DeFi strength. No other blockchain even comes close.\n\nUntil rival blockchains, such as Solana or Avalanche, begin to chip away at Ethereum's market dominance at a faster pace, it's safe to say Ethereum will remain entrenched as the premier Layer 1 blockchain in the world. And that's exactly what I'm looking for in a long-term investment prospect: a clear market leader with an established track record of excellence.\n\nContinuous cycle of improvement\n\nEthereum's success to date has not been an accident. Ethereum boasts the largest developer network in the world, and these developers are highly focused on maintaining Ethereum's market-leading position. Case in point: Last year, Ethereum pulled off The Merge, one of the most difficult and complex technical achievements ever in the blockchain world. Some compared its difficulty to that of changing the engine of an airplane while mid-flight.\n\nWhat makes Ethereum particularly enticing to long-term investors is that it has a very detailed roadmap for future development. Even after The Merge, Ethereum has plans for new technical changes to its blockchain to boost performance, lower fees, and improve overall scalability. The next major upgrade (known as Dencun) is now tentatively scheduled for the first quarter of 2024 and has already received plaudits from Wall Street giant Goldman Sachs.\n\nWhy has Ethereum fallen out of favor?\n\nSo the obvious question becomes, \"If Ethereum is so great, why has it fallen out of favor with investors?\" While there are several possible explanations, the most likely is that The Merge may have over-promised and under-delivered. There was so much buzz and speculation surrounding The Merge that it couldn't possibly live up to the hype.\n\nInvestors woke up the next day to find that nothing really seemed to have changed with the Ethereum blockchain. Transaction processing times were faster but only marginally so. Transaction fees were still high, and there were still pressing questions about the future of staking on the blockchain (something Ethereum fixed in April). On top of all that, Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin himself acknowledged that a lot of work still had to be done. So, The Merge wasn't some kind of magic rocket fuel that was going to send Ethereum soaring. That lack of immediate sizzle certainly disappointed a lot of investors.\n\nAdd in that many of the blockchain sectors that initially generated a lot of buzz for Ethereum -- such as NFTs and the metaverse -- fell out of favor with users, developers, and investors in 2022. And don't forget, the unprecedented rise of ChatGPT out of seemingly nowhere late last year led to a tremendous swing in investor sentiment. Suddenly, generative artificial intelligence (AI) became the talk of the investment world, and Ethereum admittedly didn't have much to offer in this regard.\n\nInvest in Ethereum for the long haul?\n\nFrom my perspective, Ethereum remains a great long-term investment play. Right now, investor sentiment seems to be at a low point, but that could change soon. Buying Ethereum now, while it's still below $2,000, seems like a fantastic bargain. You're getting a proven market leader at a discount price, combined with a potential catalyst (the new Dencun tech upgrade) to start off the New Year with a bang."

        "content": "Ethereum price corrected lower from the $1,875 zone against the US dollar. ETH retested the $1,780 zone and might soon attempt a fresh surge.\n\nEthereum holds the key support at $1,780 and $1,750.\n\nThe price is trading below $1,820 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere was a break above a steep bearish trend line with resistance near $1,795 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair could start a fresh increase toward the $1,850 and $1,875 resistance levels.\n\nEthereum Price Revisits Uptrend Support\n\nEthereum attempted a fresh increase above the $1,850 resistance but upsides were limited, like Bitcoin. ETH traded as high as $1,874 and recently started a downside correction.\n\nThere was a move below the $1,850 and $1,820 levels. The price even spiked below the $1,800 level and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. It retested the $1,780 support zone. A low is formed near $1,777 and the price is now attempting another increase.\n\nThere was a break above a steep bearish trend line with resistance near $1,795 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. Ethereum is now trading near the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent drop from the $1,874 swing high to the $1,777 low.\n\nOn the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $1,810 level and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. The first major resistance sits at $1,825 or the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent drop from the $1,874 swing high to the $1,777 low.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nIf ETH surpasses the $1,825 resistance, it could again start a steady increase and test $1,875. The next key resistance is near $1,920, above which the price could accelerate higher toward the $2,0000 level. Any more gains might call for a move toward the $2,050 level.\n\nMore Losses in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $1,825 resistance, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,780 level or the recent low.\n\nThe next key support is $1,750. A downside break below the $1,750 support might spark a bearish wave. In the stated case, Ether could drop toward the $1,650 level.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bearish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $1,780\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $1,825\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "The Ethereum price has shot another 2% in the last 24 hours moving to $1839 with a market cap of $221 billionAs Solana, XRP, and Cardano grab all the limelight in the altcoin market rally, Ethereum (ETH) has been making silent moves in the meanwhile.\n\nEthereum Network Growth Jumps\n\nAs per on-chain data from Santiment, Ethereum\u2019s recent surge above the $1,800 mark is supported by a significant increase in the creation of new addresses, marking the highest daily number since October 7th.\n\nadvertisement\n\nIf this long-term trend of network expansion persists and the available supply on exchanges continues to decrease, Ethereum\u2019s price ($ETH) could have a strong case for surpassing the $2,000 threshold once more.\n\nA Look Into Ether Derivatives Market\n\nRecently, Vitalike Buterin moving Ethereum to Coinbase sparked the discussion around the ETH price rally. Also, the Ethereum derivatives data shows growing bullish sentiment despite the recent selling pressure.\n\nEthereum (ETH) has experienced a 14.7% decline in its price, dropping from its peak at $2,120 on April 16, 2023. However, two key derivatives metrics indicate a significant increase in investor bullishness, reaching levels not seen in over a year.\n\nFirstly, the Ether futures premium, which measures the variation between two-month futures contracts and the spot price, has surged to its highest point in over a year. In a robust market, the annualized premium, also known as the basis rate, generally falls within the range of 5% to 10%.\n\nThis data signifies a growing demand for leveraged long positions in Ethereum futures, as the futures contract premium skyrocketed from 1% on October 23 to 7.4% on October 30, surpassing the neutral-to-bullish threshold of 5%. This remarkable surge in the metric follows a 15.7% price rally for ETH over a two-week period.\n\nFurthermore, analysis of the options market provides additional insights. The 25% delta skew in Ether options serves as an indicator of when arbitrage desks and market makers might overcharge for upside or downside protection. An Ethereum price drop typically causes the skew metric to rise above 7%, while periods of optimism tend to exhibit a negative 7% skew.\n\nOf particular note, the Ethereum options 25% delta skew reached a negative 16% level on October 27, marking the lowest point in over 12 months. During this period, protective put (sell) options were trading at a discount, reflecting excessive optimism among traders. Additionally, the current 8% discount for put options represents a notable shift from the previously persistent 7% or higher positive skew that extended until October 18."

With the Fed\u2019s decisions having a major impact on the crypto market, the stakes are high for altcoins like Ethereum and Cardano.\n\nWill Ethereum\u2019s price continue to fall, or will it rebound in anticipation of the Fed\u2019s announcements? And will Cardano\u2019s summit provide the catalyst for a much-needed rally? Read on to find out.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Price Crash\n\nEthereum (ETH) saw a 4 percent drop during the early New York trading session on Friday, moving from $1,872 to around $1,788. While Ethereum\u2019s daily 200 Moving Average (MA) remains strong, the price seems set for a mid-term correction due to a developing downward divergence on the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and a potential double-top pattern.\n\nMoreover, Ethereum\u2019s daily average trading volume has dropped by over 50 percent in the past two days, falling from about $20 billion to approximately $8 billion at the time of this report.\n\nCardano Summit Excitement At A High!\n\nThe Cardano (ADA) community is thrilled as the CardanoSummit2023 takes place at the Grand Hyatt Dubai Conference & Exhibition Centre in Dubai. Despite the enthusiasm surrounding the conference, ADA\u2019s price has surged by roughly 12 percent over the past three days, reaching approximately $0.31 on Friday. However, ADA enthusiasts are preparing for a weekend filled with uncertainty, similar to Ethereum\u2019s situation, as indicated by technical indicators.\n\nADA\u2019s price has been supported by a strong bear market rebound and the emergence of a four-hour golden cross between the 50 and 200 Moving Averages. Nonetheless, both the daily and four-hour Relative Strength Indexes (RSI) are showing signs of a mid-term bearish divergence. Therefore, ADA\u2019s price could retrace to the support range between 27 cents and 28 cents before potentially resuming the eagerly anticipated end-of-year crypto rally."

        "content": "We\u2019re thrilled to announce that Kraken now supports deposits and withdrawals of Ethereum (ETH) on zkSync Era!\n\nWhat is zkSync Era?\n\nzkSync Era is an Ethereum virtual machine-compatible Layer-2 rollup protocol by Matter Labs. Formerly known as zkSync 2.0, the project rebranded to zkSync Era in February, 2023. ZkSync Era employs zero knowledge (ZK) rollups to significantly improve Ethereum\u2019s transaction throughput capabilities and lower fees.\n\nEra ZK rollups work by batching together transactions and verifying their validity off-chain (separate from Ethereum\u2019s blockchain). An operator produces a single cryptographic proof, known as a succinct non-interactive argument of knowledge (SNARK), for the block of transactions and submits it on-chain to the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nUnlike other Ethereum Layer-2 protocols, zkSync is EVM-compatible, meaning it can easily integrate with Ethereum\u2019s existing ecosystem of projects and decentralized applications.\n\nFunding\n\nETH funding using zkSync Era is already live. You can transfer Ethereum (ETH) to your Kraken account by navigating to Funding, selecting ETH and in the drop-down box the desired deposit method (network): zkSync Era.\n\nNote: as a security measure during the alpha phase, 7,200 confirmations (typically 24 hours) on layer 1 are required before the funds are available for trading.\n\nGot ETH on zkSync Era? \u2935\ufe0f\n\nHere\u2019s what you need to know about the assets\n\nEthereum (ETH) is a global, open-source platform for decentralized applications. Ethereum is a marketplace of financial services, games and apps that is trustless, decentralized and secure. ETH is the cryptocurrency powering the Ethereum network. It\u2019s used to pay for transactions, as a store of value or peer-to-peer payment method, or as collateral to generate entirely different crypto tokens that run on Ethereum.\n\nLearn how to add ETH to your crypto portfolio with our Learn Center article How to Buy Ethereum (ETH).\n\nReady to deposit but don\u2019t have a Kraken account yet?

        "content": "Business intelligence firm MicroStrategy Inc (NASDAQ:MSTR) has reported a substantial paper gain of $900 million on its stack of 158,400 Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC), profiting from the recent surge in Bitcoin\u2019s price and fueled by optimism surrounding the potential approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\n\nWhat Happened: As of now, Bitcoin is trading above $35,400. The apex cryptocurrency has confidently surpassed the $35,000 resistance level, which had previously limited its upward movement over the past two weeks.\n\nSince the third quarter, MicroStrategy, founded by Michael Saylor, has added 6,067 Bitcoin (BTC) to its holdings, with another 155 acquired in October, according to the company\u2019s November 1 results filing.\n\nAlthough the firm\u2019s revenue increased by 3% year-on-year to $129.5 million over the quarter, it recorded a net loss of $143.4 million. Notably, digital asset impairment losses and income taxes accounted for $33.6 million and $109.6 million of the total net losses, respectively.\n\nDuring the third quarter (July 1 to September 30), while Bitcoin experienced a price decline of 11.5% from $30,480 to $26,970, MicroStrategy capitalized on this downward period by purchasing the 6,067 BTC at an average price of $27,590.\n\nCurrently, MicroStrategy\u2019s BTC holdings amount to 158,245 BTC, with an original investment of $4.715 billion. The current value of the holdings stands at $5.640 billion, reflecting a 20% increase. However, had MicroStrategy invested the same amount in Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH), they would now possess 3,971,678 ETH, resulting in a value of $7.40 billion, significantly higher than the current BTC holdings, data from blockchaincenter.net shows.\n\nWill The SEC Finally Approve Long-Awaited Bitcoin Spot ETF?

Don't let this chance slip away \u2013 secure early bird discounted tickets now!\n\nSee More: A Stay At The Floating Palace From James Bond's \u2018Octopussy\n\nWhy It Matters: Considering staking as an alternative approach, MicroStrategy could have earned 387,460 ETH at a 4% return. This ETH would be worth approximately $722.4 million, bringing the total value (with staking) to 4,359,138 ETH, equivalent to $8.127 billion.\n\nWhile MicroStrategy continues to benefit from the rise in Bitcoin\u2019s value, the narrative raises the question of what might happen if the company were to invest in ETH at the present moment. If MicroStrategy were to trade its BTC for ETH, it could potentially hold 3,025,059 ETH. Moreover, the annual revenue from staking this amount would amount to approximately $282 million, showcasing the significant potential returns that could be achieved.\n\nPrice Action: At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $35,728.12, up 3.66% in the last 24 hours, according to Benzinga Pro.\n\nRead Next: Here\u2019s How Much You Should Invest In Shiba Inu Today For A $1M Payday If SHIB Hits 1 Cent?\n\n\u00a9 2023 Benzinga.com.

        "content": "The assets in question were traced back to Christopher Castelluzo, who conducted narcotic operations from 2010 to 2015. While his illicit activities began in 2010, Castelluzo only transitioned to using Bitcoin (BTC) for narcotic transactions on darknets in 2013.\n\nCastelluzzo is currently serving concurrent 20-year federal and state prison sentences for drug distribution convictions.\n\n30k ETH bought at ICO\n\nWhat is particularly noteworthy is that Castelluzo initially acquired the 30,000 ETH during its Initial Coin Offering (ICO) in July 2014, using 15 BTC stemming from his illegal narcotics business. At the time, the 30,000 ETH was worth a mere $9,000, but its current value has surged to more than $54 million as of press time.\n\nIn addition to Ethereum, Castelluzo also obtained 30,000 Ethereum Classic (ETC) in 2016, which he used to acquire other cryptocurrencies.\n\nSubsequent to his arrest and incarceration, Castelluzzo attempted to launder the 30,000 ETH while in prison. However, U.S. authorities foiled this scheme by intercepting recorded prison telephone calls in 2021, ultimately leading to the seizure of the assets.\n\nU.S. Attorney Philip R. Sellinger stated:\n\n\u201cThe civil action we are taking today seeks to recover millions of dollars of cryptocurrency, which the defendant allegedly obtained from drug sales. Whether it\u2019s as simple as bags of cash or as sophisticated as cryptocurrency, we will take the steps necessary to seize financial gains defendants obtain from criminal activity.\u201d\n\nJames E. Dennehy, the FBI Special Agent overseeing the case, emphasized that the forfeiture action serves as a warning to others involved in criminal activities. He added that the government is committed to holding criminals accountable for their actions."

        "content": "Data from Glassnode shows Ethereum is still experiencing negative momentum despite the year-to-date rise that the asset has observed.\n\nEthereum MVRV Ratio Has Recently Indicated Negative Momentum\n\nAccording to the latest weekly report from Glassnode, the MVRV ratio has recently been below its 180-day moving average (MA). The \u201cMarket Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio\u201d refers to an indicator that measures the ratio between the Ethereum market cap and realized cap.\n\nThe \u201crealized cap\u201d here is a capitalization model for ETH that assumes the true value of any coin in circulation is the price at which it was last moved on the blockchain. This is unlike the market cap, of course, which calculates the asset\u2019s total value using the current spot price.\n\nSince the price at which each coin was last moved on the network can be assumed to be the price it was bought, the realized cap can be looked at as a sum of the total capital that the investors have used to purchase ETH.\n\nAs the MVRV ratio compares the value that the holders are carrying right now (the market cap) against the amount that they have invested into the cryptocurrency, it can provide us with information about their profit/loss status.\n\nNow, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Ethereum MVRV ratio, as well as its 180-day MA, over the last few years:\n\nThe two metrics have gone through a cross in recent days | Source: Glassnode's The Week Onchain - Week 44, 2023\n\nWhen the MVRV ratio is above the 1 mark, it means that the average investor is sitting on some profits right now, while it being below the level implies the dominance of loss in the market.\n\nFrom the graph, it\u2019s visible that the Ethereum MVRV ratio observed some rise as the rally started at the start of this year. During this period, the indicator remained above its 180-day MA.\n\n\u201cPeriods, where the MVRV Ratio trades above this long-term mean, indicate investor profitability is increasingly meaningful, and is often a signal of a rising market,\u201d explains Glassnode.\n\nIn the last few months, though, as the Ethereum price has found some struggle, the metric has gone under its 180-day MA. The analytics firm notes, \u201cdespite the positive market performance for ETH YTD, by this metric the market is still experiencing negative momentum.\u201d\n\nAs is apparent from the chart, the Ethereum MVRV ratio has very recently just started to break above this mark, following the rally towards the $1,800 level. It\u2019s still very early in the breakout, though, so it\u2019s unclear if it will actually sustain there.\n\n\u201cIt seems that the hangover from the 2022 bear is still being slowly worked through,\u201d says the report. It\u2019s not something new that ETH is going through a phase like this; as the graph highlights, the asset has also faced similar periods of uncertainty in the past.\n\nETH Price\n\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum is trading around $1,800, up 1% in the past week.\n\nETH has enjoyed some bullish momentum recently | Source: ETHUSD on TradingView\n\nFeatured image from Kanchanara on Unsplash.com, charts from TradingView.com, Glassnode.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "Could Bitcoin Spark And Ethereum Potentially Be One Of The Gainers This Cycle? - Nasdaq",
        "content": "Among the many digital currencies, Bitcoin and Ethereum have particularly stood out due to their innovative technology and increasing popularity. This article will delve into why Bitcoin Spark and Ethereum could one of the gainers this cycle.\n\nEthereum - Layer Zero Potential\n\nEthereum, since its inception, has gained considerable attention due to powerful smart contracts and scalability. Experts believe that Ethereum has \u2018Layer Zero potential,\u2019 functioning as the foundation of DeFi that enables the existence of numerous other blockchains and applications to run on it.\n\nThe potential of Ethereum lies in its decentralized, secure, and scalable infrastructure for a new generation of applications. It enables the creation of smart contracts, decentralized applications (dApps), and even other cryptocurrencies. Developers can build and launch their projects and create a thriving ecosystem of innovation within the Ethereum ecosystem. However, the Ethereum network can only process a limited number of transactions per second, leading to congestion and high fees during peak times. Once these obstacles are resolved, Ethereum is likely to be a top gainer this upcoming bull season.\n\nBitcoin Spark Fusing PoW and PoS\n\nBitcoin Spark is another contender for one of the biggest gainer this cycle, thanks to its innovative fusion of Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanisms. This combination aims to harness the strengths of both systems and mitigate their weaknesses, creating a more secure, efficient, and sustainable blockchain.\n\nPoW, used by Bitcoin, involves miners solving complex mathematical problems to validate transactions and create new blocks. While this system has proven secure, it is resource-intensive, leading to criticisms about its environmental impact. On the other hand, PoS, employed by Ethereum, allows coin holders to validate transactions based on the number of coins they hold and are willing to 'stake' as collateral. This system is less resource-intensive but has been criticized for potentially favoring the 'rich' who can stake more coins.\n\nBitcoin Spark's fusion of PoW and PoS aims to create a balance, offering the security of PoW with the efficiency of PoS. This innovative hybrid approach culminates in the Proof-of-Process (PoP) consensus mechanism and could make Bitcoin Spark a significant player in the cryptocurrency market, leading to substantial gains in this cycle.\n\nTraders Convinced Smartphone Mining Is The Next Big Thing\n\nThe rise of smartphone mining is another trend that traders are keeping a close eye on. As the name suggests, smartphone mining involves using smartphones to mine cryptocurrencies. This method makes mining more accessible to the masses, as it does not require expensive hardware or high energy consumption.\n\nThe potential of smartphone mining lies in its convenience and accessibility. With billions of smartphone users worldwide, the potential user base for smartphone mining is massive. Furthermore, smartphone mining apps are typically user-friendly, making it easy for even non-tech-savvy individuals to participate in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nThis is where Bitcoin Spark convinces new but also veteran crypto traders to be on top of the next bull run with its innovative Spark App that will enable users to simply mine BTCS via their smartphones.\n\nBottom Line\n\nIn conclusion, the cryptocurrency market is dynamic and ever-evolving, with Bitcoin Spark and Ethereum potentially being the one of the gainers this cycle. Ethereum\u2019s Layer Zero potential and the upcoming upgrades promise a more scalable and efficient platform, while Bitcoin Spark's fusion of PoW and PoS offers a balanced and innovative approach to blockchain technology.\n\nFor more information:\n\nWebsite: https://bitcoinspark.org/\n\nBuy BTCS: https://network.bitcoinspark.org/register\n\nThis post was authored by an external contributor and does not represent Benzinga's opinions and has not been edited for content.

        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction as ETH Hits Three-Month High: Time to Buy?\n\nThe Ethereum price has dropped by 2% in the past 24 hours, falling to $1,792 as the cryptocurrency market as a whole drops by the same percentage.\n\nETH\u2019s fall comes as the market reacts to the news of Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s conviction for fraud, with the altcoin now flat in the past week.\n\nYet its price remains very close to a three-month high, having risen by 11% in a fortnight and by 9% in a month.\n\nAnd with its fundamentals remaining among the strongest in the market, it\u2019s only a matter of time before it rallies again.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction as ETH Hits Three-Month High: Time to Buy?\n\n\n\nETH has dipped in the past day, yet its indicators still look promising, signalling that medium-term momentum is still with the coin.\n\nIts relative strength index (purple) has dipped from over 70 in the past few days to nearly 60 today, suggesting a loss of buying pressure.\n\nYet ETH\u2019s 30-day average (yellow) continues to rise towards its 200-day (blue), a positive sign which suggests that, once the shorter term average crosses its longer term counterpart, a breakout could happen.\n\nIt\u2019s also encouraging to note that ETH\u2019s support level (green) has been rising in recent days, implying that the current dip won\u2019t be too severe.\n\nIt seems that dip has followed yesterday\u2019s news of Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s conviction for fraud.\n\nA New York jury has found the FTX founder guilty on all seven charges he faced, including wire fraud, securities fraud, commodities fraud, and also conspiracy to commit money laundering.\n\nThis news has seemingly weakened investor confidence, dragging down the cryptocurrency market by association, with all major coins affected.\n\nSam Bankman-Fried has been found guilty on all charges. \u2014 Molly White (@molly0xFFF) November 2, 2023\n\nNonetheless, Ethereum remains in a strong position, with the altcoin still close to $1,800.\n\nAnd given that its fundamentals remain very strong, it is very likely to rebound as soon as confidence returns.\n\nIt has plenty going for it as a token, from Ethereum\u2019s dominant position in the DeFi sector and recent adoption news to its deflationary tokenomics.\n\nIt is well known that $ETH has been net deflationary since the merge. Ethereum has seen a negative supply growth of 0.19%, with an issuance of 697K ETH per year and a burn rate of 924K ETH per year. However, a notable shift has been observed since September. In the last 30\u2026 pic.twitter.com/NP3M0cXMHg \u2014 TheBit Research (@TheBitResearch) November 2, 2023\n\nFor such reasons, the Ethereum price is likely to return to $1,800 in the next couple of weeks, before reaching $1,900 or $2,000 by the end of the year.\n\nAnd if 2024 brings Bitcoin ETF approvals, ETH is likely to surge in the following months.\n\nNew Alts With Strong Fundamentals\n\n\n\nWhile Ethereum remains one of the strongest alts in the market, it\u2019s always a good idea to diversify, with traders advised to devote a segment of their portfolios to newer tokens with big upside potential.\n\nThis includes presale coins, which can often rally big when listing on trading platforms for the first time.\n\nAnd probably the highest potential presale token right now is Bitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX), a tokenized cloud mining platform that has raised more than $3.1 million in around a month.\n\nThis figure indicates how enthusiastically investors have taken to Bitcoin Minetrix, which will provide the opportunity to mine Bitcoin (BTC) by staking its native token, BTCMTX.\n\nSuch a stake-to-mine system is likely to open Bitcoin mining up to a wider demographic, with users who stake enough BTCMTX receiving actual BTC in return.\n\nStakers also receive freshly issued BTCMTX, making the token potentially highly profitable, especially if it experiences big price rises.\n\nIt will have a total cap of 4 billion BTCMTX, with buyers able to join its sale at the official Bitcoin Minetrix website.\n\n1 BTCMTX presently costs $0.01140, although this will rise to $0.01190 by the tenth and final stage of the sale.\n\nThis gives investors a limited amount of time in which to buy the coin at the lowest prices, with BTCMTX set to rally once it lists on exchanges in the next few weeks.\n\nVisit Bitcoin Minetrix NowDisclaimer: Crypto is a high-risk asset class.

The $850 billion private credit market is just the beginning. Currently, there are $568 million in active loans issued through credit funds on platforms like Ethereum, Polygon, and Solana. Who\u2019s investing? Demand primarily stems from equatorial regions, specifically emerging markets (EM), with minimal participation from developed markets (DM).\n\nHistorically, private credit was reserved for accredited investors. But now, thanks to public blockchains and the rise of stablecoins, regions plagued by inflation and starved of yields can tap into USD private credit opportunities. While Bitcoin is rightly the leading asset and network for this movement, other blockchains will introduce invaluable opportunities to a global populace that has been underserved and deliberately excluded from the mainstream economy and its outdated regulatory protectors.\u201d\n\nCoutts also says that the private credit market does come with risks and that transparency by issuers is vital to protect investors.\n\n\u201cPrivate credit isn\u2019t risk-free. Just last month, [decentralized lending platform] Goldfinch experienced a write-down in its fund. However, as long as issuers maintain transparency and risks are well-communicated, private investors of all backgrounds can access this traditional asset class in a contemporary, inclusive manner.\u201d\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Discover SCENE\n\nProShares, a U.S.-based issuer of exchange-traded funds, today announced the launch of ProShares Short Ether Strategy ETF (SETH), letting investors profit from declines in the price of Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.\n\nSETH, which is set to start trading on the New York Stock Exchange\u2019s (NYSE) Arca, seeks to deliver the inverse of the daily performance of its underlying benchmark\u2014the Standard & Poor's CME Ether Futures Index.\n\n\u201cYou will lose money when the Index rises\u2014a result that is the opposite from a traditional index fund,\u201d reads the product\u2019s summary prospectus. \u201cObtaining inverse or \u2018short\u2019 exposure may be considered an aggressive investment technique.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt further states that an investment in SETH \u201cmay not be suitable for all investors\u201d because if the Index approaches a 100% increase at any point in the day, \u201cyou could lose your entire investment.\u201d\n\nEthereum was trading at $1,816 by press time, up 1.5% over the day, data from CoinGecko shows.\n\nEarlier this year, ProShares also introduced Bitcoin Short ETF (BITI), a similar product whose performance is inversely correlated to the S&P CME Bitcoin Futures Index.

This can be useful for investors seeking exposure to commodities or cryptocurrencies, which can be difficult to transfer or store.\n\nAccording to the firm, its crypto-linked ETFs offer investors several advantages over other ways of accessing the crypto market, such as direct ownership, trusts, or funds.\n\nAmong those advantages, ProShares said, is the fact that crypto-linked ETFs are traded on regulated exchanges, have transparent pricing and liquidity, and are subject to the same rules and regulations as traditional ETFs.\n\nEdited by Liam Kelly."

        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction Following SEC\u2019s Exemption of ETH as a Security in Binance Lawsuit \u2013 Time to Buy?\n\nSource: TradingView\n\nThe price of Ethereum (ETH) has dropped by 3% in the past 24 hours, slipping to $1,816 as the cryptocurrency market reels from the news that the SEC has sued Binance and its founder Changpeng Zhao with 13 violations.\n\nETH hasn\u2019t been as badly affected as other cryptocurrencies by this news, with the altcoin down by 4.5% in the past week, but still up by 51% since the beginning of the year.\n\nAnd in contrast to other altcoins, ETH has arguably benefitted from not being named as an unregistered security in the SEC\u2019s charges against Binance, with such rivals as Cardano (ADA), Algorand (ALGO), Solana (SOL) and Cosmos (ATOM) being included (and suffering more as a result).\n\nAs such, once the dust has settled on the SEC\u2019s latest legal action, ETH could find itself recovering more strongly than many other utility tokens, particularly when combined with an increase in staking.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction Following SEC\u2019s Exemption of ETH as a Security in Binance Lawsuit \u2013 Time to Buy?\n\nETH\u2019s indicators are all in a pretty weak position right now, in line with the rest of the market.\n\nSource: TradingView\n\nThis includes its relative strength index (purple), which declined below 30 yesterday and has only just begun creeping slowly back up.\n\nSimilarly, ETH\u2019s 30-day moving average (yellow) is now dropping sharply towards its 200-day average (blue), and is likely to fall below the longer-term average in a few days, at which point a rebound is due.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that ETH won\u2019t fall much further in price than it already has, in that its support level (green) has held up fairly well around $1,800.\n\nAnd unlike BNB and various other coins which have been named in the SEC\u2019s charges against Binance, ETH has effectively been provided with a clear path towards recovery.\n\nThe SEC named 10 tokens in addition to $BNB as securities in the Binance lawsuit\n\n\n\nSome big name tokens are on this list such as $ADA, $MATIC, $ALGO, $SOL, $ATOM\n\n\n\nOnce again they are not litigating each of these tokens, just indirectly litigating them which is a scumbag move.\n\n\n\nWe\u2026 pic.twitter.com/avBqdSxBOQ \u2014 Tony Edward (Thinking Crypto Podcast) (@ThinkingCrypto1) June 5, 2023\n\nIn addition to BNB and Binance USD (BUSD), the altcoins cited as securities in the SEC\u2019s complaint are the following:\n\nSOL\n\nADA\n\nMATIC\n\nFIL\n\nATOM\n\nSAND\n\nMANA\n\nALGO\n\nAXS\n\nCOTI\n\nIt\u2019s worth highlighting that the tokens above have fallen harder than many other in the market, with The Sandbox and Axie Infinity, for example, down by 14% and 9% in the past 24 hours.\n\nThe fact that ETH coin was not named in the list above suggests that it may escape any future SEC action against it and/or its founders.\n\nThe SEC will come for $ETH next. The SEC lawsuit mentions the fee burning mechanism of Solana and Polygon, stating that the deflationary effect has led investors to view their purchase of the tokens to have potential for profit. Polygon's fee burning mechanism (EIP-1559) in\u2026 \u2014 Pete Kim (@petejkim) June 5, 2023\n\nHowever, some observers are concerned that the SEC complaint highlights burning as a mechanism which creates an expectation of profit, something which may result in it turning on ETH in the not-too distant future.\n\nOn the other hand, it\u2019s not only an expectation of profit that qualifies something as a security (otherwise BTC would be a security), so it\u2019s certainly not a certainty that ETH will one day face its own data with the SEC.\n\nIn fact, some commentators are actually optimistic that the SEC\u2019s complaint provides a relatively clear outline on how cryptocurrency platforms and organizations can avoid offering unregistered securities in the future.\n\nThrough its complaint against Binance, the SEC just gave crypto projects a 136 page roadmap on how not to be seen as a security.\n\n\n\nIt makes me insanely bullish for the prospects of current and future crypto projects.\n\n\n\nMost people are aware of the Howey Test, which outlines 4\u2026 \u2014 jonwu.eth (@jonwu_) June 6, 2023\n\nEither way, ETH has been less severely affected today by the SEC\u2019s latest legal foray, and it\u2019s likely that it will recover strongly in the coming weeks and months.\n\nAs we\u2019ve written before, it successfully introduced staking withdrawals last month, and in the aftermath of this update Ethereum staking has actually increased.\n\nSince April 11, the total number of #ETH staking deposits has grown by 657%#ETH staked has surged despite last month's Shapella hard fork, a network upgrade that enabled withdrawals from staking\n\n\n\nToday, ~18% of #ETH supply is staking and/or in the activation queue pic.twitter.com/NMsw7zEstB \u2014 Wakem Capital Management (@WakemCapital) June 5, 2023\n\nSuch an increase in staking will inevitably reduce the circulating supply of ETH, and in conjunction with reported increases in ETH outflows away from exchanges, it suggests that the altcoin\u2019s price will recover steadily in the near and more distant future.\n\nFrom its current price of around $1,800, it\u2019s likely to return to $1,900 in the next few weeks, before passing $2,000 in the next few months.\n\nBuy Ethereum Now\n\nHedging Bets with Other High-Growth Alts\n\nWhile ETH continues to have good prospects, even with some uncertainty hanging over it, its recovery may be gradual and may require several months to develop.\n\nAccordingly, some investors may prefer to buy newer altcoins that show more potential in terms of above-average in the shorter term.\n\nSuch altcoins include presale tokens, with some of the best of these likely to experience big rallies once they list on exchanges for the first time.\n\nOne example of such a presale token is Wall Street Memes (WSM), a new cryptocurrency associated with the meme stocks movement that emerged out of the 2021 GameStop and AMC rallies.\n\nWall Street Memes has already raised more than $4.4 million in its presale, which kicked off only last week.\n\nhttps://www.twitter.com/wallstmemes/status/1665448546273820673\n\nAs a meme token, WSM has no real fundamentals other than the community which will support it, and given that it has already raised a large sum of money so quickly, it seems as though its community of holders will be a healthy one.\n\nThis suspicion is also supported by the fact that the Wall Street Memes Twitter account now has more than 225,000 followers, all of which are potential WSM buyers.\n\nWSM could therefore rally big once it lists, with investors able to join its presale by visiting its official website.\n\n1 WSM token is currently selling at a discounted price of $0.0274, although this will climb to $0.03370000 by the time the sale reaches its 30th stage.\n\nVisit Wall Street Memes Now"

        "content": "HodlX Guest Post Submit Your Post\n\nCryptocurrency is changing rapidly. Driven by advancements in blockchain technology, regulation and adoption, the market is looking like it will be changing again.\n\nOne of the seminal moments of Q3 2023 was the avalanche of applications for Bitcoin (BTC) spot ETFs (exchange-traded funds) by major asset management firms.\n\nThis was fueled by Grayscale Investments\u2019 victory against the SEC in August 2023, which gave the firm a green light for its BTC spot ETF initiatives.\n\nThis surge in institutional interest is a sign of mainstream financial acceptance.\n\nThe technical upgrades in Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem \u2013 particularly the upcoming Cancun upgrade \u2013 promise to redefine how decentralized applications (DApps) operate.\n\nThese exciting developments have set the stage for a transformative Q4.\n\nBTC spot ETFs gain regulatory approval\n\nIn Q3, the world watched as traditional asset management giants threw their hats into the cryptocurrency ring.\n\nBlackRock led the way with its application for a BTC spot ETF, followed closely by other players like Fidelity, Franklin Templeton, Valkyrie, Bitwise and VanEck.\n\nThis was not just a bandwagon effect but a strategic move to embrace an asset class that has proven its ability to stay in the game and stay profitable.\n\nAfter Grayscale\u2019s win over the SEC, BTC spot ETFs are set to gain regulatory approval.\n\nA Henley and Partners Crypto Wealth Report showed that as of Q3 2023, there are approximately 425 million cryptocurrency holders globally.\n\nOut of these, a little over 88,000 are \u2018crypto millionaires,\u2019 and nearly half have invested in BTC.\n\nThe coin\u2019s substantial presence in affluent portfolios shows that it is a legitimate asset class that management giants simply cannot ignore.\n\nForbes Advisor also anticipates a bullish Q4, with BTC projecting an increase of 63.3% on the year-to-date and Ethereum set to increase by 40.2%.\n\nBoth BTC and Ethereum are up by 40.9% and 22% respectively as of time of writing.\n\nBitcoin halving and \u2018four-year cycle\u2019 theory\n\nThe four-year cycle theory in cryptocurrency was born from Bitcoin\u2019s halving events.\n\nApproximately every four years, Bitcoin\u2019s mining rewards are halved \u2013 meaning, the number of Bitcoins mined in each new block is reduced by half.\n\nSome groups believe that Bitcoin\u2019s halving event leads to price increases, which in turn affects the entire cryptocurrency market.\n\nWhile this theory seems to have some degree of accuracy, there is no guarantee the four-year pattern will hold.\n\nThe cryptocurrency market is complex and influenced by multiple factors, including the global economy, market sentiment, tech development and regulatory shifts.\n\nEthereum Cancun upgrades and implications\n\nThe Cancun upgrade is set to improve the performance metrics of layer two.\n\nThis is especially relevant for projects within the OP ecosystem like Coinbase\u2019s Base, Binance\u2019s opBNB, Gitcoin, Celo and Loot, which adopted the OP Stack for infrastructure and application development.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Cancun upgrade has far-reaching implications across abstract wallets, cross-chain bridges and decentralized storage systems.\n\nThe upgrade significantly enhances Ethereum\u2019s data processing capabilities with an overhaul in the data storage method.\n\nFor Ethereum and its native currency, this positive development means a stronger position in a landscape that is well-known for experiencing rapid evolution.\n\nThe future holds strong\n\nQ4 2023 is shaping up to be a defining period for the cryptocurrency market.\n\nThe anticipated BTC spot ETF approval and Ethereum\u2019s Cancun upgrade are markers of more extensive changes on the horizon.\n\nThe crypto landscape is at last steering toward mainstream acceptance and integration.\n\nGiven the landscape, tokens with market caps below $5 billion are expected to have a higher chance of growth \u2013 particularly when assessed across utility dimensions.\n\nUtility has increasingly become the goalpost by which tokens are evaluated, especially as the market is inclined towards tokens that deliver on this front.\n\nAccording to several trader forecasts, DeFi (decentralized finance) and tokens with high utility value are likely to rise as the hot sectors in 2024.\n\nThe rapidity of these developments only heightens the need for all market stakeholders to keep up with these changes, given the formative influence they may wield on future markets.\n\nWhether it\u2019s BTC making its way into traditional asset management portfolios or Ethereum and Avalanche pushing technical breakthroughs, the end of 2023 could look very different from its first quarter.\n\nAmid this whirlpool of changes, tokens that can demonstrate real utility should find themselves at the van of market trends.\n\nRyan Lee is the research chief analyst at Bitget.\n\nCheck Latest Headlines on HodlX\n\n\n\nFollow Us on Twitter Facebook Telegram Check out the Latest Industry Announcements Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment

        "content": "Peter Brandt, a veteran trader with over 40 years of experience, has set a target of $1,993 for Ethereum (ETH) following the asset\u2019s breakout of a recently formed right-angled expanding triangle.\n\nBrandt made this projection yesterday during his latest analysis of Ethereum\u2019s recent price movements. The trader shared a daily ETH chart on X, identifying the formation of a right-angled expanding triangle pattern, which was completed on Oct. 23.\n\nA right-angled expanding triangle, or a right-angled broadening wedge, features an upper trendline and a lower trendline, with both lines expanding apart. The pattern can either signal a potential continuation of the previous trend or a reversal.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nData from Brandt\u2019s chart suggests that the beginning of this pattern dates back to Aug. 17. Notably, ETH collapsed 6.76% on the day, dropping to a low of $1,683.5. However, this massive red candlestick formed the base of the right-angled expanding triangle.\n\nAmid Ethereum\u2019s swings and lows since Aug. 17, the asset formed the broadening triangle, as it continued to trade within its confines until Oct. 23. Brandt\u2019s analysis emphasizes that ETH completed the formation of the triangle on Oct. 23 amid a 6.17% increase that day.\n\nETH Forms Flag Pattern, Poised to Rally 8.6%\n\nInterestingly, ETH broke above the upper trendline of the triangle, signaling a potential continuation of an uptrend that began on Oct. 12. However, after the breakout, Ethereum formed a flag pattern that lasted for nine days, from Oct. 24 to Nov. 1.\n\nBrandt identified this flag pattern in his analysis. According to him, ETH recently completed the flag pattern, which is a further re-confirmation of the right-angled expanding triangle, which the asset completed on Oct. 23.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nNotably, flags are typically consolidation patterns that suggest a brief pause in the prevailing trend before a potential resumption of that trend. Since breaking above $1,800, ETH has consolidated between $1,744 and $1,865, but with an upward trajectory.\n\nThe asset has now completed the nine-day flag, and a bullish continuation of the uptrend is expected. Brandt\u2019s chart suggests a target of $1,993 for when Ethereum engineers another massive run. ETH would need to appreciate 8.5% from its current price to hit $1,993.\n\nEthereum trades for $1,836 as of press time, per CoinMarketCap data. The asset is up 1.76% over the past 24 hours, with its eyes set on conquering the $1,874 resistance. Impressively, ETH\u2019s trade volume has increased 71.30% to a current value of $11.6 billion, ranking it third in volume."

        "content": "Share:\n\nRender price slipped to trade at $2.22 after a nearly 8% decline following the failed breach of $2.55.\n\nThe Render Network successfully completed upgrading its core infrastructure to Solana from Ethereum.\n\nRender Foundation, in accordance with the upgrade, allocated $2.5 million worth of RNDR as a reward to migrate RNDR tokens to the Solana blockchain.\n\nRender price exhibited a reaction opposite to market expectations after the Render Network achieved a milestone, upgrading from Ethereum to Solana. The network, seeing as to how the transition might affect its users, is assisting by granting subsidies using RNDR tokens.\n\nRead more - Breaking: FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried found guilty on all counts, including stealing $8 billion from users\n\nRender moves to Solana from Ethereum\n\nRender Network, which is a blockchain and crypto-enabled protocol that enables individuals to contribute unused GPU power to help projects render motion graphics and visual effects, was launched on Ethereum back in 2017. But after six years, the project is moving from the \"home of Decentralized Finance (DeFi)\" to Solana, also known as the \"Ethereum killer\".\n\nThe move was touted to be a \"watershed moment\" for Render and seen as an attempt at capitalizing on the benefits of the Solana blockchain. Jules Urbach, the founder and architect of the Render Network, commenting on the transition, stated,\n\n\"Solana's incredible transaction speeds, low costs, and commitment to web-scale architecture make it a perfect fit for the Render Network as we continue building a scalable and decentralized metaverse infrastructure.\n\nIn the announcement, Render Network noted that the transition of assets from Ethereum to Solana is being facilitated by Wormhole. Furthermore, to ease the transition for its users, Render also stated that it has allocated up to 1.14 million RNDR worth about $2.5 million at the current price in grants.\n\nThis would be used to subsidize user transfer fees on Ethereum associated with the upgrade for up to three months.\n\nInterestingly, the market reacted much differently than what was expected out of RNDR.\n\nRender price takes a hit\n\nRender price at the time of writing, trading at $2.22, noted a 7.8% decline in the past day despite the historic milestone. The influence of the broader market cues trumped the impact of the network upgrade, resulting in RNDR falling through the support level at $2.26.\n\nThe altcoin is still in the bullish zone, as noted on the Relative Strength Index (RSI), albeit observing a downtick. If the investors' sentiment remains negative, a further downfall can be expected, which might bring RNDR down to $2.08 and RSI to test the neutral line at 50.0 as support.\n\nIf the broader market cues further push the Render price downward, losing the support of $2.08 is possible, sending the token to tag the support line at $1.91. This level is also coinciding with the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA).\n\nRNDR/USD 1-day chart\n\nHowever, if the Render price bounces above $2.08, it could invalidate the bearish thesis. The confirmation of the same would be achieved when the RSI bounces off the neutral line. This would enable RNDR to reclaim the support at $2.26."

The recently launched Devnet 11 is up and running. A Goerli shadow fork is also scheduled to occur.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEthereum developers are most likely to launch a new devnet, Devnet 12, for further code testing.\n\ngm, a few updates from the eth dev call yesterday, acdc #121:\n\n- devnet 11 is up and running\n\n- goerli shadow fork today\n\n- devnet 12 launch probably not till early december\n\n- goerli public testnet launch not likely until after the holidays (my opinion)https://t.co/HniCazLSWc \u2014 Christine Kim (@christine_dkim) November 3, 2023\n\nAs stated in a report detailing the latest Ethereum AllCore Developers Consensus Call, if developers do not work on updating client releases during the week of Devconnect, an Ethereum developer-focused conference in mid-November, Devnet 12 will likely launch sometime in early December.\n\nGiven these new estimates for testing, it seems unlikely that developers will also be able to launch the upgrade on the Goerli testnet in late November, as planned. Developers will most likely begin upgrading public Ethereum testnets after the holidays in Q1, 2024.\n\nEthereum fees soar 30%\n\nAccording to on-chain analytics firm IntoTheBlock, total Ethereum fees climbed by 30% this week due to many smaller-cap tokens seeing a surge in on-chain trading volumes.\n\nAccording to Santiment, at the start of November, Ethereum network growth reached its highest level in 24 days, while supply on exchanges fell to its lowest level since ETH's inception.\n\nNew Ethereum addresses surpassed 38,000 by the end of October, as the ETH exchange supply fell further to 8.37%.\n\nThe Ethereum price increased to $1,875 on Nov. 2, which Santiment believes was helped in part by the highest \"day\" of new addresses established since Oct. 7. At the time of writing, ETH had fallen below that high and was down 0.09% in the last 24 hours to $1,808."

Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nAt press time, the king of altcoins exchanged hands at $1,848, up 2.33% in the last 24 hours, reaching levels last seen before the mid-August crash, per CoinMarketCap.\n\nEthereum sees network growth\n\nApparently, the latest upside was boosted by new participants on the network. According to on-chain analytics firm Santiment, new ETH addresses climbed to a 24-day high at the end of October.\n\nTypically, a spike in Network Growth indicates that a project is gaining considerable traction.\n\nAt the same time, ETH\u2019s liquid supply sank to new depths. Indeed, the supply on centralized exchanges was just 8.38% of the total circulating supply as of press time, the lowest since ETH started to move between public hands.\n\nThe fall in exchange supply meant that there was no imminent sell pressure on ETH\u2019s price.\n\nAs things stand, ETH has nearly recouped all the losses made since the market crash in August. Santiment futher noted that if the network continues to grow steadily, and exchange supply falls further, there were strong chances of ETH breaching $2000 in the near future.\n\nETH whales step up their game\n\nMeanwhile, the price rise grabbed the interest of whale investors. Transactions worth more than $1 million in ETH jumped 37% on 1 November. Notably, this was one of the largest single-day spikes in whale transfers over the last three months.\n\nDerivatives market gives bullish signals\n\nThe shift in ETH\u2019s market structure was reflected in the derivatives sectors as well. Open Interest (OI) in ETH futures contracts rose to $5.36 billion, the highest since 17 August, according to Coinglass.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nThe steady upward trajectory of OI, coinciding with a jump in price, implied that new money was coming into the market at press time.\n\nFurthermore, ETH\u2019s funding rates across most exchanges were positive, meaning long traders paid fees to short traders. When funding rates are positive and increase over time, it\u2019s a strong indicator of a bullish market."

This significant upgrade to the Ethereum blockchain promises to transform not only the crypto ecosystem but also the broader world of technology and finance. In this article, we will delve\n\nThe cryptocurrency landscape has seen remarkable growth and innovation over the years, but few developments have generated as much anticipation and excitement as Ethereum 2.0. This significant upgrade to the Ethereum blockchain promises to transform not only the crypto ecosystem but also the broader world of technology and finance. In this article, we will delve into Ethereum 2.0\u2019s potential impact, the problems it aims to solve, and how it might reshape the future.\n\nUnderstanding Ethereum 2.0: The Beacon of Progress\n\nEthereum, often referred to as the \u201cworld computer,\u201d has been a driving force behind blockchain technology since its inception in 2015. Ethereum introduced smart contracts, enabling developers to create decentralized applications (DApps) and launch their tokens via initial coin offerings (ICOs). However, the Ethereum network has faced challenges, primarily scalability issues that have limited its potential for mass adoption.\n\nEthereum 2.0, also known as Eth2 or Serenity, aims to address these fundamental issues by transitioning from a Proof of Work (PoW) to a Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, among other improvements.\n\nLet\u2019s explore the potential impacts of Ethereum 2.0\u2019s transformation.\n\n1. Scalability and Speed: Unleashing the Next Wave of DApps\n\nOne of the most pressing issues Ethereum has faced is scalability. The existing Ethereum network can become congested during periods of high demand, resulting in slow transaction speeds and high gas fees. Ethereum 2.0 introduces shard chains, each capable of processing transactions independently. This enables parallel processing, significantly increasing the network\u2019s capacity and transaction throughput.\n\nThe impact on DApps is profound. With greater scalability and faster transaction speeds, developers can create more sophisticated and responsive applications, potentially unlocking new use cases across various industries, from finance to gaming.\n\n2. Energy Efficiency: A Greener Blockchain\n\nEthereum 2.0\u2019s transition to PoS is not just about scalability; it also addresses environmental concerns associated with PoW blockchains like Bitcoin. PoS reduces the energy consumption required for mining and securing the network. This shift aligns with the growing global emphasis on sustainability and environmentally responsible technology.\n\nAs the world looks for more eco-friendly alternatives, Ethereum 2.0\u2019s green approach might attract more investors and users, leading to broader adoption and investment in the platform.\n\n3. Security and Decentralization: A More Robust Network\n\nThe move to PoS enhances the security and decentralization of the Ethereum network. Validators, who replace miners in validating transactions, are incentivized to act honestly by staking their own cryptocurrency as collateral. This reduces the risk of attacks, making the network more secure and resistant to manipulation.\n\nA more secure and decentralized network can attract a wider range of applications, including those in sectors where data integrity and trust are paramount, such as healthcare and supply chain management.\n\n4. Staking Opportunities: Passive Income for Cryptocurrency Holders\n\nEthereum 2.0 introduces the concept of staking, where users can lock up their cryptocurrency as collateral to validate transactions and earn rewards. This provides an opportunity for passive income for cryptocurrency holders, potentially making Ethereum more attractive for long-term investors.\n\nThe ease of participation in staking can attract a broader demographic of users and investors, further expanding the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\n5. DeFi and NFT Growth: Fueling the Crypto Renaissance\n\nEthereum is already the epicenter of decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and Ethereum 2.0\u2019s improvements will only enhance these sectors. Faster transaction speeds and lower fees will make DeFi applications more efficient and user-friendly. Moreover, the increased security will boost confidence in DeFi platforms.\n\nFor NFTs, Ethereum 2.0\u2019s scalability will enable artists and creators to mint and trade NFTs with less environmental impact and lower costs, potentially fueling the growth of the digital art and collectibles market.\n\n6. Cross-Chain Compatibility: A More Interconnected Crypto Ecosystem\n\nEthereum 2.0\u2019s enhancements are not limited to its own blockchain. The introduction of shard chains and the Beacon Chain will facilitate greater interoperability with other blockchains. This cross-chain compatibility could lead to the creation of a more interconnected crypto ecosystem, where assets and data can flow seamlessly between various networks.\n\n7. The Broader Impact: Eth2 Beyond Crypto\n\nWhile Ethereum 2.0\u2019s primary focus is on blockchain and cryptocurrency, its impact extends beyond these realms. The emphasis on energy efficiency aligns with global sustainability goals. The security and trust elements are applicable to various industries, from logistics to legal, where blockchain can be a transformative force.\n\nAlso, read \u2013 Ethereum 2.0: What\u2019s New and What Is The Future Of Ethereum 2.0\n\nHow ethereum 2.0 has changed the world?\n\nEthereum 2.0, often referred to as Eth2 or Serenity, is poised to bring significant changes to the world, not just within the crypto ecosystem but also in broader technological and financial contexts.

        "content": "Data has shown that Americans are exhibiting a greater degree of enthusiasm toward XRP compared to Ethereum (ETH).\n\nSpecifically, Google Trends data reveals that XRP commands a significantly higher search volume among Americans than ETH and blanket terms like \u2018cryptocurrency.\u2019 Over the past 30 days, XRP consistently ranked higher in search volume by a considerable margin.\n\nGoogle search volume for XRP from the United States peaked on October 24. Interestingly, the date coincided with when the firstborn crypto, Bitcoin, broke out significantly from its passive trend to over $34k for the first time in more than 15 months.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nOrdinarily, crypto enthusiasts would expect that ETH, the closest rival to Bitcoin, would have taken the spotlight as Bitcoin led the market.\n\nHowever, such a scenario failed to materialize. Instead, XRP emerged as the center of attention, with more people from the U.S. showing interest in the asset, as evidenced by Google search data.\n\nFurthermore, Google Trend data indicates that the interest of Americans in XRP is evenly distributed rather than concentrated in a few specific regions across the country. As depicted in the map below, more than 90% of Americans are interested in XRP than Ethereum.\n\nNotably, the regions in the United States leading the ranking of XRP search volumes include Iowa, West Virginia, Louisiana, Montana, and Delaware. Moreover, XRP similarly trumped Ethereum in search interest year-to-date (YTD).\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nXRP and Ethereum Search Interest Worldwide\n\nWhile XRP defeated Ethereum in search interest from Americans, both in the last 30 days and YTD metrics, the battle becomes close on a worldwide scale.\n\nGlobally, the search interest for XRP and Ethereum has been neck and neck in the last 30 days, with no decisive winner. However, when delving into regional breakdowns, it becomes evident that more countries exhibit interest in XRP than Ethereum.\n\nThe regions with the highest search volume for XRP include Japan, South Africa, the Philippines, the United Kingdom, and Australia. Meanwhile, on a YTD scale, Ethereum slightly towers above XRP despite ETH being about seven times bigger than XRP in market valuation."

        "content": "A massive amount of ETH has made its way to centralized exchanges, increasing the Ethereum balances of these exchanges. Given the implications of exchange inflows, it could be a barrier to the cryptocurrency when it comes to claiming the $2,000 resistance.\n\nInvestors Send 13,000 ETH To Exchanges\n\nData from IntoTheBlock shows a massive amount of ETH headed toward exchanges as the price rose. The total inflow volume as of October 31 when the price first cleared the $1,800 resistance was at 480,570. However, by the start of November, this number had blown up massively.\n\nNovember 1 saw the total ETH flowing into exchanges reaching 774,890, and by this time, the bulls had established their dominance above the $1,800 level. With outflows coming out at just around 630,000 ETH, the netflows come out to approximately 130,000 ETH flowing into exchanges on November 1. This showed a willingness among investors to start taking profit from their holdings.\n\nSource: IntoTheBlock\n\nAs the data tracker shows, the majority of Ethereum investors had moved back into profit after crossing $1,800. Even following the retracement, the total percentage of ETH investors in profit is sitting at 55.40% and it is no surprise that some of these investors would want to secure profit.\n\nBy November 2, though, there has been a relaxation from investors when it comes to inflows. Data shows that on Thursday, the ETH inflow figures fell to 637,070, although this is still much higher than the previous week\u2019s figures. The exchange net flow is now down to 31,040 ETH as of Thursday.\n\nETH price recovers above $1,800 | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nEthereum Large Holders Swing Into Action\n\nEthereum has also seen a spike in the number of large transactions being carried out on the network as well as the transaction volume of these large holders. The total number of large transactions sat at 1,900 on October 29. But by November 2, the figure ballooned to 4,320, an over 100% increase in just four days.\n\nThe transaction volumes of these whales also saw a rise in an almost similar manner compared to the number of large transactions. Large transaction volumes were at 741,440 ETH on October 29. But on November 2, the volume reached 2.21 million ETH. In dollar figures, large transaction volumes went from $1.33 billion to $4.04 billion.\n\nLooking at the bullish and bearish transactions (i.e those who are buying versus those who are selling), there isn\u2019t a large difference bulls still continue to lead in the asset. The 7-day total for bulls came out to a total of 98 bulls compared to 87 bears. But the gap is closing further on a daily basis where IntoTheBlock shows 14 bulls and 12 bears.\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nEthereum, the blockchain giant that stands as a formidable rival to recently emerged Solana, has seen its transaction fees soar by an impressive 30%. This sudden increase has left many wondering: Is the Ethereum network experiencing a revival?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBehind this surge lies a whirlwind of network and development activity. Ethereum's ecosystem, known for its flexibility and adaptability, is currently brimming with developers and innovators. The 30% uptick in trading fees is not just a random fluctuation; it's a direct reflection of the intensifying work being done on the Ethereum platform.\n\nTotal Ethereum fees climbed by 30% this week due to many smaller cap tokens seeing a surge in on-chain trading volumes pic.twitter.com/nwmoxiOEat \u2014 IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) November 3, 2023\n\nInterestingly, the state of the Ethereum network mirrors a pattern often seen in the crypto world. Historically, periods of retracement and correction on the cryptocurrency market have been accompanied by spikes in developmental activity. This phenomenon is straightforward to understand: when the market takes a step back, it often presents an opportune moment for developers to dive in. It is akin to building the foundation of a house during calm weather, ensuring that it stands firm during a storm.\n\nThese moments of market calm, paradoxically, are buzzing with innovation. Developers and investors are aware that launching projects during these times can be strategically advantageous. With the market in a lull, newer assets and initiatives have room to grow, breathe and establish themselves. Moreover, these periods are magnets for new investors, many of whom are hungry for fresh opportunities. These investors often perceive newer projects as more lucrative compared to assets that have already peaked and reversed.\n\nAs Ethereum's fees continue their upward trajectory, the underlying message is clear: Ethereum is alive and kicking. The platform, with its decentralized applications and smart contracts, is once again proving its worth in the crypto sphere."

        "title": "Analyst Reveals Why Ethereum Is Underperforming Against Bitcoin - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Ethereum has been notably underperforming Bitcoin through this latest rally. Here\u2019s why this is so, according to a CryptoQuant analyst.\n\nEthereum Net Taker Volume Has Been Mostly Negative Recently\n\nIn a new post on X, CryptoQuant Netherlands community manager Maartunn has pointed out what the \u201cnet taker volume\u201d for Ethereum is looking like.\n\nThe net taker volume here is an indicator that keeps track of the difference between the taker buy volume and taker sell volume on the Bitcoin futures market.\n\nWhen the value of this metric is positive, it means that the taker buy volume is dominating the taker sell volume right now. Such a trend implies buying pressure may be strong in the market currently.\n\nOn the other hand, negative values could suggest the presence of a bearish sentiment among the investors, as selling pressure is higher than the buying pressure.\n\nNow, here is a chart that shows the trend in the 30-day moving average (MA) Ethereum net taker volume over the past few years:\n\nLooks like the 30-day MA value of the metric has been near the neutral mark in recent days | Source: @JA_Maartun on X\n\nAs displayed in the above graph, the Ethereum net taker volume has been mostly negative during the past few months, implying that sentiment around the asset has remained bearish.\n\nBitcoin, on the other hand, has enjoyed periods where the taker buy volume has surpassed the taker sell volume, as the chart shared by the analyst a few days back showed.\n\nThe 30-day MA value of the indicator seems to have been green in the last few weeks | Source: @JA_Maartun on X\n\nMost notably, the net taker volume of Bitcoin is significantly positive right now, suggesting the strong buying pressure present in the market. Unsurprisingly, BTC\u2019s sharp rally has come alongside these positive values of the metric.\n\nEthereum has no such buying pressure present at the moment. Maartunn believes this is why the ETH price has been performing considerably poorly against BTC recently.\n\nEthereum Has Still Not Touched The Highs Set Earlier In The Year\n\nEthereum\u2019s underperformance against Bitcoin is easily visible in the asset\u2019s year-to-date chart.\n\nETH has enjoyed some rise during the past month | Source: ETHUSD on TradingView\n\nAt the same time as Bitcoin observed its rally off the back of the highly positive net taker volume, Ethereum also saw a surge of its own. This rise, though, has been nowhere near as sharp as that of the original cryptocurrency, as ETH is still just trading around $1,800, which is notably less than the top of around $2,100 that the asset set back in April.\n\nNot only has Bitcoin surpassed the $31,000 top it set back in July, it has also done so in spectacular fashion, as it\u2019s now trading above the $34,000 level, which is significantly higher.\n\nIf the net taker volume is anything to go by, the second largest cryptocurrency may continue to underperform versus the largest, so long as investor sentiment around it remains negative.\n\nFeatured image from DrawKit Illustrations on Unsplash.com, charts from TradingView.com, CryptoQuant.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Amidst ongoing speculation about the potential approval of the first-ever spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF) by US regulators, the world of cryptocurrencies has witnessed a significant development.\n\nNotably, ProShares has introduced the first ETF that offers investors the opportunity to take a bearish stance on Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, Reuters revealed on November 2.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nProShares, a leading issuer of ETFs, is launching a \u2018ProShares Short Ether Strategy\u2019 \u2013 an Ether futures ETF designed to deliver the inverse of the daily performance of the Standard & Poor\u2019s CME Ether Futures Index.\n\nPut simply, if the index drops 3%, the ProShares\u2019 ETF will strive to return 1%.\n\nIt is important to note that this is not an ETF tied to Ether\u2019s spot price. Instead, it works like the majority of other crypto ETFs available in the US, focusing on futures contracts on the second-biggest crypto asset.\n\nThe move comes, roughly a month after a batch of first Ether ETFs debuted. Out of a total of nine funds that were launched in early October, three of them belong to ProShares. However, unlike its previous two that combine exposure to both Ether and Bitcoin, the newest one provides investors with exposure to ETH only.\n\nTepid debut\n\nIn contrast to its previous two funds, the launch of the ProShares Short Ether Strategy failed to attract as much attention on its first day. For comparison, the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy saw an influx of $1 billion in assets within its first couple of days, while the largest of the new Ether futures ETFs is yet to clock $10 million in assets.\n\nProShares CEO Michael Sapir said the new inverse Ether investment vehicles are meant \u201cto address the challenge of acquiring short exposure to ether, which can be onerous and expensive.\u201d\n\nThe company also launched an inverse Bitcoin ETF, which currently manages around $74 million in assets.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "title": "Here\u2019s How High AI Predicts Ethereum Price Will Go After the Next Halving - CoinCodex",
        "content": "Key takeaways\n\nEthereum (ETH) price is expected to reach new all-time highs in Q2 2024, following the next Bitcoin halving event\n\nThe Bitcoin halving occurs approximately every four years and has historically ushered in a new bull market for blockchain-based digital assets\n\nETH rose +2133% after the previous BTC halving to reach its all-time high of $4864, Sporia on TradingView expects a similar level of upside this time around\n\nHere\u2019s how high AI predicts Ethereum price will go after next halving\n\nEthereum (ETH) is currently valued at $1788 after dropping -2.67% in the past 24 hours. This follows a period of upside in which ETH climbed +23.22% over the course of a 3-week period at the end of October.\n\nThe recent surge from ETH means that it has now reclaimed the 50% level on its July-October range in a single bullish move. So far, ETH has held up well at the range\u2019s midway point and early forecasts are suggesting that the positive price action could continue over the coming months.\n\nThe ETH price prediction algorithm has forecasted a +253% move by Q2 2024. This would place ETH at $6,339 \u2014 a new all-time high for the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. The main catalyst for the projected move is the Bitcoin (BTC) halving event, where the total mining rewards in each BTC block are cut in half.\n\nWhat is Bitcoin halving and when is it due to happen?\n\nThe Bitcoin halving event occurs every 210,000 blocks, which works out to approximately every four years. The process of reducing the blockchain\u2019s total mining rewards by half provides a greater level of deflationary pressure \u2014 after each halving event, the current circulating supply for BTC becomes increasingly scarce.\n\nWhen each block miner was awarded 12.5 BTC, the circulating supply increased by 1,800 BTC each day. After the 2020 halving event, each block miner was then awarded with 6.25 BTC, which meant that there were just 900 BTC being created each day. As a result, the proportion of the circulating supply that is newly mined is continually reduced, making those that are already in circulation more scarce, and in theory, more valuable.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s deflationary mechanism has historically ushered in a new bull market for blockchain-based digital assets. BTC formed new all-time highs in 2013, 2017, and 2021 \u2014 approximately one year after a halving event took place. Right now, the next Bitcoin halving event is expected to occur on 15th April 2024.\n\nHow high could ETH go after the next halving event?\n\nETH shot up +2133% in total after the previous BTC halving. The move cemented Ethereum\u2019s position as the second-most valuable cryptocurrency by market cap, taking the ecosystem\u2019s native token from $217 to $4,864 in a period of 18 months.\n\nA trader who goes by the username Sporia on TradingView shared a long-term projection for the price of ETH. The chart highlights two parallel channels in which ETH has been trading since the 2018 alt season, including a strong support line that has been held throughout the bear market of 2022 and 2023.\n\nThe reversal indicator signal has fired off just 4 times in ETH\u2019s history, each time preceding a massive rally. Image source: TradingView (@Sporia)\n\nSporia expects that ETH will continue to hold this market structure over the next 5 years. The upper resistance line provides the ETH price target during the next two bull stages of Bitcoin\u2019s 4-year cycles, including a $16,090 price target in 2025. In total, this would be a +799% price increase from the current level.\n\nBottom line: AI sets bullish near-term target for ETH and long-term outlook remains positive\n\nETH has been a relative straggler during recent bullish moves in the crypto markets, climbing +60% while the total crypto market cap climbed +80% over the past year. The relative underperformance of ETH during this time frame has increased Bitcoin dominance to more than 50%, which in itself is a metric that has historically heralded a fresh period of upside for the entire crypto market.\n\nThe slight underperformance from ETH in recent times should not be a cause for concern. The network was upgraded during the bear market as Ethereum\u2019s consensus mechanism changed from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake during The Merge, which helped make the blockchain more energy efficient.\n\nETH also benefits from new ETFs and a degree of regulatory clarity from the SEC. On top of that, Ethereum\u2019s various layer-2s have been making major progress in isolation and each one provides an increasing level of buy pressure for the native ETH token.\n\nTo summarize, there are plenty of bullish catalysts for ETH, and it seems only a matter of time before the digital asset starts gaining momentum. As things stand, the ETH price prediction algorithm expects a +253% move in the next 7 months, which would take ETH to a new all-time high just 2 months after the next BTC halving event."

        "content": "The U.S. government has filed a civil forfeiture action to recover $54 million worth of Ethereum (ETH) previously seized from Christopher Castelluzzo.\n\nIn a press release on Nov. 2, 2023, the office of the U.S. attorney for the District of New Jersey announced the filing of a civil forfeiture action to recover $54 million in ETH belonging to Christopher Castelluzzo, who is currently serving concurrent federal and state sentences for drug distribution.\n\nYou might also like: Australian police seize $1.5m in crypto from dark web drug dealer\n\nCastelluzzo, along with his associates, sold narcotics and trafficked drugs on the darknet between 2010 and 2015. He used about $9,000 from sales in 2014 to purchase 30,000 ETH during Ethereum\u2019s initial public offering (ICO). Later, he received an additional 30,000 Ethereum Classic (ETC) following the Ethereum network\u2019s hard fork in July 2016.\n\nThe 30,000 ETH purchased with $9,000 has grown in value and is currently worth approximately $54 million.\n\nThe U.S. government is also seeking to forfeit other crypto assets, including Cardano (ADA), Solana (SOL), Avalanche (AVAX), Algorand (ALGO), Binance Coin (BNB), Uniswap (UNI), and Polkadot (DOT). Law enforcement moved all seized tokens, including ETH, to government-controlled wallets in July 2022 and August 2023.\n\nWhile Castelluzzo was serving time, the convicted drug trafficker, in a recorded telephone conversation, planned with his associates to evade taxes and move the ETH to places like Malta, Ireland, and the Bahamas, as stated in the court filing.\n\n\u201cOur forfeiture action of $54 million should serve as a lesson to those who mistakenly believe we can\u2019t trace their illicit behavior or their ill-gotten proceeds. We will successfully hold all criminals responsible in the open, with real world consequences.\u201d James E. Dennehy, FBI-Newark Special Agent in Charge\n\nAs previously reported, the U.S. government holds about 200,000 BTC in hardware wallets, making it one of the largest asset holders, with most of the Bitcoin confiscated from criminals.\n\nRead more: Deep web drug vendor misusing crypto faces 96 years in prison\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

So as long as that maintains you could see a little bit of a bounce.\u201d\n\nETH is trading at $1,831 at time of writing.\n\nTurning to Solana (SOL), DonAlt says a buying opportunity could arise if and when the seventh-largest crypto asset by market cap starts consolidating after the recent rally.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no real good pullback level to buy [Solana]. I think if it goes back to $30, that is scary. It\u2019s a pullback level but it\u2019s scarily close to where it\u2019s actually just full-blown invalidated. And it starts looking really shitty.\n\nOn this one, if this consolidates maybe you just buy the consolidation, like that\u2019s a pullback of sorts that I could see.\n\nOtherwise, if Bitcoin tops [out], this probably goes down.

        "title": "Monolithic vs. modular blockchains - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Looking at all the cryptocurrency in tracking sites like Coinmarketcap.com may leave most beginners confused at the number of tokens being offered to the public. Layer-1, layer-2, metaverse, DeFi, gaming, liquid staking, real world assets, memes and the like are like the toys in a large toy shop. Each has its own separate world.\n\nOne of the more recent types of tokens that have hit the market are called layer-2 scaling solutions. Examples of these tokens are Optimism, Arbitrum, zkSync, Polygon zkEVM, Consensys Linea, Coinbase Base, Starkware and a few that are not yet well known.\n\nEthereum founder Vitalik Buterin stated something called the Blockchain Trilemma. A blockchain tries to be secure, fast and decentralized. But according to Buterin, it is very hard to achieve all three. Ethereum, for example, is secure and decentralized, but it is quite slow. Transactions can sometimes take an hour or so to finalize if the network is congested. It is secure and decentralized because more than 500,000 independent validator nodes now secure the network and approve transactions by consensus. That is also why it is slow compared to a blockchain that only has a handful of nodes that validate transactions by consensus.\n\nThe early blockchains like Ethereum, Solana, Cardano, Binance Smart Chain and others basically tried to do all the work of a blockchain by themselves. This is somewhat similar to a restaurant manager who is also the one taking orders, cooking the food, chopping the vegetables, manning the cash register, pouring the drinks and cleaning the tables and floors. The next customer would need to wait until the one-man crew is ready to take their order. Hence, a long line forms outside the restaurant.\n\nThe new layer-2 scaling solutions basically take some of the blockchain functions and only do the final settlement on the Ethereum chain. To the user, they may not notice and might be surprised that Ethereum is still behind the scenes as the one that records the final transaction. But the front end portion of the transactions are handled by the layer-2 chains.\n\nSome time ago Ethereum underwent an upgrade called Shapella. This upgrade allowed the people who staked their ETH for validator nodes to withdraw these. Another upgrade that was done previously was to shift from Proof of Work (like Bitcoin) to Proof of Stake.\n\nThe problem is that Ethereum transactions are still slow and the gas (transaction) fees are still expensive. This is actually what the layer-2 scaling solutions want to address. For example, someone who wants to buy an NFT might not want to pay $50 for transaction fees on a $200 NFT. On the other hand, the buyer might be more amenable if the transaction fee was only $5, but the transaction is done on a layer-2 scaling solution that in turn finalizes on Ethereum.\n\nConversely, if you are transacting something worth a million dollars, having the security of Ethereum might be worth a $20 gas fee just for your own peace of mind.\n\nThe way the layer-2 solutions work is sort of like dealing with the waiter and server at a restaurant, on the ordering, serving and payment. But you don\u2019t actually see the chef who cooked your food. That\u2019s how a layer-2 scaling solution works. It is still working on top of Ethereum, but you just see the scaling solution fee and speed.\n\nOne problem that comes up when you have many Ethereum layer-2 tokens is that when you are using one distributed application (dApp), you need one kind of layer-2; then for another dApp, you need another layer-2. That\u2019s somewhat similar to having non-interchangeable poker chips from one casino to another. Although, right now you can bridge in between these different assets, but everytime you do so, you pay gas fees.\n\nWhether this strategy of performing most functions on layer-2 over Ethereum will dominate other layer-1 monolithic, \u201cdo everything\u201d blockchains is still anyone\u2019s guess. But the upcoming wave of layer-2 tokens looks like they will try to do just that.\n\nZain Jaffer is the CEO of Zain Ventures focused on investments in Web3 and real estate.\n\nThis article was published through Cointelegraph Innovation Circle, a vetted organization of senior executives and experts in the blockchain technology industry who are building the future through the power of connections, collaboration and thought leadership.

        "title": "How to Invest In Ethereum | 4 Simple Methods to Start Now - CoinJournal",
        "content": "What to Consider Before Investing in Ethereum\n\nThere are a variety of issues to consider before investing in Ethereum. We will go over some concepts in this section of the article.\n\nFees\n\nGas fees are paid in Ethereum\u2019s native currency, ether (ETH). Gas prices are denoted in Gwei, which itself is a denomination of ETH\u2014each Gwei is equal to 0.000000001 ETH. As you can probably imagine, this can be a relatively negligible amount of money. Exchanges will also charge fees in relation to Ethereum transactions, but these are usually roughly around 0.1%.\n\nRisks\n\nThere are several risks associated with investing in cryptocurrencies. And the first of these is that the market is highly volatile compared to many other asset classes. This can be an advantage, leading to big profits from relatively small investments, but it can also, naturally, result in the opposite as well.\n\nAnother issue with cryptocurrencies is that they remain relatively unregulated. Both governments and central banks have been involved in crypto regulation in recent years, and the situation has certainly improved. But they are not as regulated as other aspects of the financial system, with debates continuing over whether they should be regarded as commodities or virtual currencies.\n\nCryptocurrencies can also be vulnerable to theft and hacking, while hard forks and discontinuation can also cause problems for cryptocurrency investors. CFD contracts associated with cryptocurrencies are also highly speculative, and can result in both massive gains, but also huge losses when not used diligently.\n\nPayment methods\n\nThere are several payment methods associated with Ethereum. Considering the popularity of cryptocurrency, most fiat currencies are supported, as are such payment methods as PayPal, Neteller and Skrill. Bitcoin can also be exchanged for Ethereum.\n\nWhy Invest in Ethereum?\n\nThere are several viable reasons to invest in Ethereum. Firstly, the cryptocurrency niche is growing, and is expected to expand still further in the future. Considering that Ethereum is one of the most established tokens, this makes it a good investment option as per veteran investors and traders.\n\nEthereum has also expanded on the functionality delivered by Bitcoin, meaning that it is poised to match, or even exceed, this pioneering cryptocurrency.\n\nThe market position of Ethereum also seems to be extremely strong. Ethereum has outperformed a majority of cryptocurrencies in the past few years which is undoubtedly encouraging for investors.\n\nSummary of Investing in Ethereum\n\nEthereum has been one of the major success stories of cryptocurrency, thanks to its technological improvements that have led to a faster blockchain than the market-leading Bitcoin. This means that institutional money has flowed into Ethereum, making it popular among the investment community.\n\nThere are many different ways to take advantage of the potential of Ethereum, with several trading strategies available. And there is no barrier to entry for beginners either, with algorithmic traders ensuring that entry to the cryptocurrency market, and Ethereum investing in particular, is possible for anyone.\n\nThe investment risk can be suitably managed by using some investment strategies such as hedging. Other strategies like day trading aim to take advantage of price movements around-the-clock. Check out our Ethereum price forecast guide for more information on future price movements."

        "content": "Bitcoin and other crypto tokens continued their bullish momentum on Thursday as the oldest crypto asset hit 17-month high after Fed's dovish tone. Crypto tokens posted big gains following the completion of one year of Sam Bankman-Fried's crypto empire- FTX exchange.\n\n\n\nBitcoin continued to remain firm as the largest crypto token surged more than 3 per cent and managed to race-past strongly above 35,500-levels. However, its largest peer, Ethereum, was also seen about 3 per cent up but remained below $1,900-level. Majority of the altcoins were trading with sharp gains.\n\n\n\nBitcoin's price rose to trading above the $35,500 threshold after the U.S. Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) confirmed the anticipated interest rates. This announcement has infused the market with optimism, leading to a steady rise in Bitcoin's price over the past day, said Edul Patel, Co-founcer and CEO at Mudrex.\n\n\n\nBarring the US dollar pegged USD Coin, all of the majority of top crypto tokens were trading sharply higher on Thursday. Solana surged more than 11 per cent, while Polygon was up 8 per cent. Cardano and Polkadot jumped 7 per cent, and Chainlink and Tron gained about 4 per cent each in the early trade.\n\n\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market cap was trading significantly higher, rising up to $1.32 trillion-mark, as it jumped more than 3 per cent in the last 24 hours. However, the total trading volumes surged about 43 per cent to $57.45 billion.\n\n\n\nThe crypto market reacted positively to the unchanged interest rates by the Federal Reserve, pushing the global crypto market cap up by over to around $1.35 trillion. The top 20 cryptos are currently trading in the green, said Parth Chaturvedi, Investments Lead, CoinSwitch Ventures\n\n\n\n\"Despite a strong investor sentiment, amongst the top losers was SafeMoon (SFM) which is down by over 50% in the last 24 hours. The decline, however, comes as the company\u2019s CEO and CTO have been taken into custody for fraud. The defendants are now facing criminal charges,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nTech View by WazirX Trade Desk\n\nSolana(SOL), is an open-source project that leverages the unrestricted nature of blockchain technology and offers decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions. Solana was formally introduced in March 2020 under the stewardship of the Solana Foundation, headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the daily time-frame, the SOL/USDT chart had been traversing within an ascending channel pattern. The trend has broken above the upper trendline with a significant momentum in price. The RSI indicates that the token is in the oversold zone, however we expect the momentum to continue into the coming week. The next resistance is expected at 48.6 USDT and an immediate support is expected at 38 USDT.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Views and recommendations given in this section are the analysts' own and do not represent those of Business Today.

        "content": "Render Network Moves From Ethereum to Solana Blockchain in Major Win \u2013 Where Next for SOL?\n\n3D content rendering platform Render Network has relocated from the Ethereum blockchain to Solana in order to benefit from the latter\u2019s high throughput and lower transaction costs.\n\nAs per an update in a blog posted to Medium, the Render Foundation said that it had successfully implemented an upgrade to its core infrastructure to Solana from Ethereum.\n\nRNDR token holders can now migrate their tokens from the Ethereum blockchain to the Solana blockchain using the Upgrade Assistant at upgrade.rendernetwork.com.\n\nThe Render Network is a decentralized global network of GPUs that come together to offer rendering services for 3D content creators.\n\nThe protocol\u2019s foundation said in its blog post that it had set aside up to 1.14 million RNDR tokens worth over $2.6 million at the current price to facilitate the upgrade and cross-blockchain shift.\n\nAccording to the Render Network Foundation, users will be awarded a share of the 1.14 million tokens based on a points system designed to incentivize upgrading as soon as possible.\n\n\u201cMoving Render\u2019s core infrastructure to Solana is a watershed moment that unlocks major new capabilities like real-time streaming and dynamic NFTs,\u201d commented Jules Urbach, the Render Network\u2019s founder.\n\n\u201cSolana\u2019s incredible transaction speeds, low costs, and commitment to web-scale architecture make it a perfect fit for the Render Network as we continue building a scalable and decentralized metaverse infrastructure,\u201d he added.\n\nA Watershed Moment For the Solana Blockchain Too?\n\nThe fact that the Render Network, a protocol boasting one of the crypto industry\u2019s most promising use cases, is moving to Solana is huge news for the blockchain.\n\nThough it saw explosive growth in late 2021 to reach a market cap high of more than $75 billion, as per CoinMarketCap, Solana has largely lived in Ethereum\u2019s shadow for its entire existence.\n\nIts trade value locked was last around $1.7 billion, more than 20x lower than Ethereum\u2019s TVL of more than $60 billion, as per DeFi Llama.\n\nAs recently as last November, analysts had declared the blockchain a failed project thanks to the collapse of a few key protocols running on it that had liquidity ties to failed crypto exchange FTX and its ex-CEO Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF).\n\nSBF had been a big proponent of the blockchain and his also failed hedge fund Alameda had been a major provider of liquidity there.\n\nWhere Next for Solana (SOL)?\n\n\n\nThe fact that major protocols like the Render Network are opting to utilize Solana\u2019s underlying blockchain infrastructure rather than more trusted networks like Ethereum suggests belief in Solana\u2019s future is returning, a bullish sign for the coin.\n\nAs Ethereum continues to struggle with scaling issues (like high fees and slow transactions), rival protocol\u2019s like Solana may continue to steal market share.\n\nSolana\u2019s native SOL token recently vaulted to 14-month highs above $40, and could be in for further swift gains assuming it can break above key resistance around $48.\n\nBut Solana does have one problem.\n\nEthereum layer-2 scaling solutions like Arbitrum, Polygon and Optimism offer equally cheap and fast transactions, but also the underlying security of the older and more widely used Ethereum network.\n\nSolana may struggle to one up these protocols and take a more serious swipe at Ethereum\u2019s market dominance in the space."

        "content": "In recent developments, US authorities led by US Attorney Philip R. Sellinger successfully seized $54 million worth of Ethereum (ETH) from Christopher Castelluzzo, a convicted drug dealer operating in Lake Hopatcong, New Jersey.\n\nMassive Crypto Bust\n\nThe US Attorney\u2019s Office filed a civil forfeiture action to recover previously seized cryptocurrency that was determined to be the proceeds of an illegal narcotics distribution scheme operating in and around New Jersey.\n\nUS Attorney Philip R. Sellinger emphasized law enforcement\u2019s \u201ccommitment\u201d to seizing financial gains from criminal activity, regardless of the form they take. Sellinger further stated:\n\nThe civil action we are taking today seeks to recover millions of dollars of cryptocurrency, which the defendant allegedly obtained from drug sales. Whether it\u2019s as simple as bags of cash or as sophisticated as cryptocurrency, we will take the steps necessary to seize financial gains defendants obtain from criminal activity.\n\nAccording to the US Department of Justice\u2019s (DOJ) press release on the case, the prosecution sheds light on using cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum by criminals on the darknet to evade detection.\n\nIn addition, James E. Dennehy, Special Agent in Charge of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in Newark, stated that the FBI played a critical role in uncovering the illegal conduct and ill-gotten proceeds.\n\nDrug Trafficker\u2019s Ethereum Stash Seized\n\nAccording to court documents and the investigations conducted, Christopher Castelluzzo and his associates conspired to sell narcotics between 2010 and 2015.\n\nIn 2013, they allegedly began trading drugs on darknet platforms in exchange for Bitcoin. Castelluzzo, using proceeds from narcotics sales, participated in Ethereum\u2019s Initial Coin Offering (ICO) in July 2014, acquiring 30,000 Ethereum. Additionally, Castelluzzo received 30,000 ETH Classic in 2016.\n\nCastelluzzo\u2019s plan to move the funds to a tax haven in Ireland, Malta, or the Bahamas, or potentially keep them in USDT (Tether), was revealed in forfeiture documents.\n\nHowever, a subsequent search warrant led to the raid of Brian Krewson\u2019s residence, an associate of Castelluzzo. Police discovered the relevant crypto wallets under Krewson\u2019s control, and after obtaining the necessary passwords, law enforcement executed the seizure of the Ethereum, valued at $31 million at the time.\n\nCurrently serving concurrent 20-year federal and state prison sentences for drug distribution convictions, Castelluzzo attempted to evade taxes and transfer the 30,000 Ethereum out of the United States while incarcerated.\n\nHowever, Castelluzzo\u2019s plans were intercepted when recorded prison telephone calls exposed his efforts to launder the cryptocurrency. As a result, the United States intervened and seized Castelluzzo\u2019s cryptocurrency holdings linked to his drug trafficking crimes.\n\nThe current value of the 30,000 Ethereum stands at approximately $54 million, underscoring the significant impact of the seizure.\n\nAs of the time of writing, ETH is trading at $1,815, reflecting a 0.9% increase over the past 24 hours and a steady upward trend of over 2% in the past seven days, exhibiting strong bullish momentum in the market.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock, chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "Will Bitcoin and Ethereum hit new highs in Q1 2024? - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "An analyst opined that BTC and ETH could reach new ATHs before Q1 2024 ends.\n\nAnother analyst suggested that altcoins could benefit from the potential buying momentum in November.\n\nThe increase in value recorded by Bitcoin [BTC] and Ethereum [ETH] could only be the tip of the iceberg, according to Chris Burniske.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s ETH\u2019s market cap in BTC\u2019s terms\n\nBurniske, a partner at blockchain network and web3 infrastructure firm Placeholder, noted that a breakout for ETH and BTC could lead to new All-Time Highs (ATHs) for the cryptocurrencies.\n\nIn fact, Burniske noted that the projection could become reality before the end of the first quarter (Q1) of 2024. For context, BTC\u2019s ATH was $68,789 in 2021 while ETH was 4,891 in the same year.\n\nHistory could be set again\n\nTo back up his point, the analyst referred to the historical performance of the coins, particularly the December 2018 to January 2019 period. He also noted that both cryptocurrencies were showing similar price actions.\n\nIf $BTC & $ETH rip here, and then everything else follows, we could be in for a mid-2019 repeat \u2014 going just high enough to get people to believe that maybe, just maybe, new ATHs are around the corner, before enduring a final wipeout (Q1 \u201824?) and putting in firm higher lows. \u2014 Chris Burniske (@cburniske) November 2, 2023\n\nA look at CoinMarketCap\u2019s data showed that Bitcoin moved from around $4,000 to $10,000 within the period mentioned above. For ETH, it jumped from $113 and closed at around $268.\n\nWhile beating the ATH might sound like a challenging record to break, on-chain data showed that a hike could remain in place. AMBCrypto obtained this inference from the Short Term Holder Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio.\n\nBTC and ETH sellers are fatigued\n\nAt press time, Bitcoin\u2019s STH-MVRV was 1.22. This metric measures the behavior of short-term investors whose demographic is less than 155 days.\n\nWith the metric increasing over the last few months, Bitcoin may be able to maintain the increase it has seen lately over the next few months.\n\nFurthermore, AMBCrypto analyzed Ethereum\u2019s Seller Exhaustion Constant, which also seemed to support the bullish thesis.\n\nUsing the 30-day price volatility, the Seller Exhaustion Constant detects periods of possible high losses and the period when it could be a relatively good period to make gains.\n\nAt press time, the metric had left the danger zone (colored red) and was up to 0.025. This implies that ETH\u2019s value has more room to increase in the short term than its chance of a decrease.\n\nAdditionally, another analyst who weighed in on the BTC/ETH price action was Altcoin Sherpa. According to Sherpa, the value of ETH and BTC may drop for a while. However, he added that the month of November remains a good buying period for both coins.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nSherpa, in his tweet, also mentioned that altcoins besides ETH may reap from the buying pressure in December and January.\n\n$ETH: ETHBTC tanking, I think that altcoin buying opportunity is getting better each day. It's looking more and more like the .048 area is going to get tagged. Expecting November to be a good buying period and then alts do really well in December/January. #Ethereum pic.twitter.com/3qTaTAsskB \u2014 Altcoin Sherpa (@AltcoinSherpa) November 1, 2023\n\nAs it stands, both BTC and ETH could hit notable highs. However, making a new ATH is something that looks very difficult to achieve. At the same time, it should not be ruled out."

        "content": "Arbitrum Foundation Eyes Japanese Market for Ethereum Layer 2 Expansion\n\nThe Arbitrum Foundation and Fracton Ventures partner to accelerate Ethereum Layer 2 adoption in Japan. / Image by Arbitrum Foundation\n\nToday, the Arbitrum Foundation, an organization dedicated to supporting Arbitrum, an Ethereum Layer 2 network, announced a strategic partnership with protocol studio Fracton Ventures.\n\nThe collaboration seeks to establish Arbitrum\u2019s footprint in Japan, an outcome to be achieved through the launch of Arbitrum Japan, a platform designed to kickstart ecosystem growth and community education initiatives.\n\nCollaboration to Accelerate Blockchain Adoption in Japan\n\nArbitrum Foundation\u2019s Head of Ecosystem Development, Nina Rong, noted the vast potential inherent in the Japanese market in the press release.\n\n\u201cIn our collaboration with Fracton Ventures, we feel we are uniquely positioned to reach a new demographic of developers, innovators, and blockchain-curious consumers that haven\u2019t previously been exposed to the benefits of blockchain technology,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd how Arbitrum has leveraged that tech to become the leading Layer 2 scaling platform throughout the industry.\u201d\n\nIf you don\u2019t want to miss out Arbitrum\u2019s new growth plan with Fracton in Japan \ud83c\uddef\ud83c\uddf5 few accounts you should follow:@Arbitrum_jpn \u2013 Arbitrum Japan account@wecandaoit \u2013 Fracton, trusted partner in Japan@9dai_5 \u2013 fren of da show at Fracton@vvinyll \u2013 fren of da show at Fracton \u2014 Nina Rong | Arbitrum (\ud83d\udc99,\ud83e\udde1) (@nina_rong) September 29, 2023\n\nSiddharth Pillai, Head of Partnerships at Fracton Ventures, expressed confidence in the ability of his organization to successfully deliver the vision of Arbitrum Japan.\n\nPillai noted the untapped potential in the Japanese blockchain sector, which has not experienced a great amount of exposure to leading technology and developer tools. The introduction of Arbitrum Japan, he believes, will provide the opportunity to fully harness the power of blockchain within the region.\n\nThe partnership between the Arbitrum Foundation and Fracton Ventures is set to adopt a two-pronged approach towards achieving its goals. The first aspect involves business development and ecosystem building, while the second focuses on education and community support.\n\nFracton Ventures, operating out of Japan, will utilize its network of experts, investors, and developers in the region to grow the Arbitrum ecosystem in the Japanese market. This will involve fostering collaboration between companies operating in the web2 and web3 spaces and is expected to drive business development.\n\nThe second prong of the strategy involves the expansion of technical education content through Ask-Me-Anything (AMA) sessions and hackathons. University ambassadors and community managers will also be charged with leading activities to promote the adoption of Arbitrum among consumers.\n\nJapan has established itself as a friendly environment for the growth of the crypto industry. Prime Minister Fumio Kishida expressed optimism about the potential of web3 to transform the internet and contribute to societal change during the WebX conference held in July.\n\nArbitrum\u2019s Journey so Far\n\nArbitrum\u2019s journey began with a token airdrop in March 2023, coinciding with the launch of the Arbitrum Foundation. The airdrop saw 1.16 billion tokens made available as a reward for early users of the Layer 2 network, granting them governance powers on the DAO which controls the Arbitrum One and Nova networks.\n\nDespite experiencing some controversy early on, Arbitrum has made important progress, dominating the Ethereum Layer 2 scaling market in terms of total value locked (TVL).\n\nArbitrum L2 TVL Chart by L2Beat\n\nAs of today, Arbitrum boasts a TVL of $5.9 billion across Layer 2 chains, according to L2BEAT, placing it ahead of rivals such as Optimism and Coinbase\u2019s Base.\n\nThe strategic partnership between the Arbitrum Foundation and Fracton Ventures holds great promise for the expansion of the Arbitrum ecosystem in Japan. With the right execution, this collaboration could boost the adoption of blockchain technology in the region, creating new opportunities and expanding possibilities for developers and investors."

While the market for NFTs was bubbly in 2021 and early 2022, this year has been tough for many profile picture (PFP) projects so far\u2014as hype for collections like Yuga Labs\u2019 Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) chills amid a prolonged crypto winter.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHowever, signs of warmth in the broader digital assets industry could be at play. The uptick in NFT trading volume came as the price of Bitcoin bounced above $35,000\u2014touching its highest price in 16 months on anticipation that a spot Bitcoin ETF could be approved in the U.S. soon, analysts say.\n\nDappRadar\u2019s report highlighted Solana as a notable network in terms of growth. NFT trading volume on the speedy layer-1 grew 15% from $24 million to $27.6 million, DappRadar reported. Meanwhile, the price of Solana itself surged 65% in October, jumping from $23 to around $38, according to CoinGecko.\n\nNFT trading volumes across a breadth of blockchains that support the class of tokens are captured in DappRadar\u2019s report. And across all networks, a 50% jump in NFT trading volume on Ethereum\u2014crypto\u2019s second-largest coin\u2014kept it \u201cleading the pack,\u201d DappRadar said.\n\nAs the flow of JPEGs grew in October, the floor price\u2014or cheapest listed NFT on a secondary marketplace\u2014for some popular PFP projects increased as well. For example, the floor price of NFTs from the aforementioned Bored Ape Yacht Club rose from $40,000 worth of Ethereum to around $55,000.\n\nAn uptick in the price of PFP projects boasting large market capitalizations was recently touched on by Punk9059, director of research at NFT startup Proof. \u201cUptober has arrived,\u201d the pseudonymous researcher said on Twitter last week.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWe've had 4 consecutive weeks of rising NFT volume. pic.twitter.com/GnuqmxA5xN \u2014 NFTstats.eth (@punk9059) November 3, 2023\n\nWhile DappRadar\u2019s report could provoke WAGMI-like hopes among some NFT traders, $405 million in NFT trading volume throughout October is a paltry sum compared to the $2 billion in JPEGs that traded hands in March. Additionally, NFT sales continued to slump last month.\n\nDespite the rise in trading value, the overall number of NFTs sold in October slid by 5%, from 3.58 million in September to 3.4 million last month, DappRadar reported. Still, the decrease was less severe than when NFT sales fell by 290,000 in August.\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAs the cryptocurrency world remains in a state of perpetual flux, one analyst has recently shared a bold prediction that has piqued the interest of both optimists and skeptics alike. The prediction revolves around the prospect of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) reaching new all-time highs (ATHs) by Q1, 2024. While some may see this as an enticing proposition, it is essential to examine the validity of such a forecast by juxtaposing it with historical data and current market sentiment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nComparing past with future: Drawing parallels with mid-2019 can be a risky approach. The cryptocurrency landscape has evolved immensely since then, with institutional investors taking center stage and governmental regulations becoming more defined. While history might repeat itself, the drivers behind the market movements may vary significantly.\n\n\"Everything else follows\": The assertion that if BTC and ETH surge, the rest will follow might be too simplistic. The digital asset ecosystem now comprises a multitude of coins and tokens, each with its unique use cases, partnerships and technological advancements. While BTC and ETH undeniably hold sway over the market, newer assets like Polkadot, Cardano or even niche NFT-based tokens can exhibit independent behavior.\n\n\"Final wipeout\": The concept of a final wipeout in Q1, 2024, leading to the establishment of higher lows, can be seen as a cautious approach, hinting at a potential bear market. While market corrections are natural, predicting an exact timeframe for such an event is challenging, given the volatile nature of cryptocurrencies.\n\nCurrent narket indicators: Most commonly used market metrics indicate a relatively stable capitalization with a mild upward trend. Volume fluctuations and the Crypto Fear & Greed Index suggest that while there is a mix of optimism and caution, we are far from a state of \"extreme greed\" that typically precedes a sharp correction."

        "title": "Ethereum Price As Open Interest Stays Aloft At $5.88B, Is $3000 Next? - CoinGape",
        "content": "Ethereum price alongside other selected tokens like Solana, XRP, Chainlink, Cardano, and more have sustained gains since Bitcoin price broke out in early October. This bull run is riding on optimism around the potential green lighting of spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US. Ethereum price bounced off support at $1,500 as investors and traders alike rushed to book positions ahead of what some have come to refer to as an early \u201cSanta Claus rally.\u201d\n\nThe fear of missing out (FOMO) coupled with rumors around the approval of BlackRock\u2019s Bitcoin spot ETF kept the momentum surging behind Ethereum, which quickly gained ground above key levels, starting with the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) (red), the 100-day EMA (blue) and the 200-day EMA (purple).\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum Price Prediction: Facing The First Litmus Test\n\nThe growing interest in Ethereum provided traders with scalping opportunities, allowing them to buy and sell on short timeframes, further creating liquidity that sustained the run-up above $1,800.\n\nHowever, Ethereum snapped out of the uptrend late last week after trading October highs around $1,862. Traders started to lock in the gains as Ethereum price corrected below a stubborn multi-month falling trendline.\n\nFollowing a few weeks of bullish action, Ethereum currently hovers at $1,815 while bulls fight to reclaim support/resistance at $1,800.\n\nAn immediate recovery seems like a pipe dream based on the prevailing technical outlook as shown by the Directional Moving Index (DMI). The uptrend was sustainable as long as the +DI line in blue was trending higher while the -DI persistently dropped.\n\nHowever, with the +DI falling and the -DI starting to move up, chances of ETH immediately resuming the uptrend are slimming. Traders would be on the lookout for at least two key things.\n\nFirst, Ethereum price must step above $1,800 to keep investors confident in the uptrend. The second would be to watch out for a continued decline \u2014 a move that may break down investor confidence in the uptrend and possibly trigger a sell-off.\n\nThe first major support lies at $1,740 where bulls will try to assert their influence on the trend if declines increase below $1,800. Below this level, we could be staring at a larger breakdown below $1,700, with areas at $1,665, $1,585, and $1,500 ready to serve as tentative support levels.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that a longer downtrend is unlikely, especially with more support expected from all three applied moving averages; the 50-day EMA, the 100-day EMA, and the 200-day EMA.\n\nOn the bright side, an immediate run-up above $1,800 would give bulls another chance to battle the falling trendline. Breaking above this level could signal the start of a prominent rally targeting highs above $2,000 and eventually the much-anticipated bull run.\n\nEthereum Open Interest Still Elevated\n\nAccording to data by Coinglass, a platform tracking the crypto derivatives market, Ethereum\u2019s open interest (OI) is growing consistently, reaching $5.88 billion after falling to $4.76 billion in August.\n\nOpen interest refers to the number of options or futures contracts held by traders in active positions. An increasing OI implies that new or additional capital is coming into the market.\n\nCrypto trader @MacnBTC said via a post on Twitter (now X) that high funding rates on altcoins imply a local top signal. This means that the recent rally could have topped out and pullbacks are likely to occur.\n\nIronically high funding rates on alts = still a local top signal in the bull market this does not apply, which tells me we are still in the very early phases of a run https://t.co/puq7M8KcPC \u2014 Mac \ud83d\udc3a (@MacnBTC) November 3, 2023\n\nHowever, a pullback is not obvious, and leaning on technical analysis might help traders make informed decisions.\n\nWhat\u2019s Ahead for Ethereum Price As ProShares Unveils Inverse ETH ETF\n\nProShares introduced a new product into the market this week, which allows investors to seek exposure to ETH shorts. This means that investors can bet against Ethereum price without actually owning the crypto.\n\nThe ProShares Short Ether Strategy ETF will see investors profit when Ethereum price falls, providing them with returns that are inversely correlated to the usual Standard & Poor\u2019s CME Ether Futures Index.\n\nIn a nutshell, when the index dips by 1% the ETF strategy will ideally gain by 1%. The product is connected to Ethereum futures contracts and not the ETH spot price.\n\nRelated Articles"

        "title": "Solana, Ethereum, and Everlodge: Price Comparison for Q4 2023 - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "Three cryptos, Solana, Ethereum, and Everlodge have stood out in the recent crypto market rally. With the crypto market now in bull territory, all three coins might be in for more gains.\n\nIt\u2019s interesting to take a look at their perspective in the context of a bull market in the last quarter of 2023.\n\nVisit the Everlodge presale and win a luxury holiday to the Maldives\n\nSolana (SOL) Continues Its Uptrend\n\nSolana (SOL), the Ethereum killer, has been gaining a lot of attention lately despite its FTX fiasco in 2022. In the last month alone, its value went up by 50%, catching the interest of the crypto community.\n\nThe Solana price has outperformed most of the crypto market, rallying above $35 in October. What has been the driving force of this upward trend? Analysts explained that more investors have shown interest in Solana again. To back this claim, a report showed that Solana trading volumes reached $1.7 billion. This is the highest value recorded in over 100 days.\n\nIn addition, the SOL price recorded an increase of 80% on the 30-day chart. However, the price of Solana had retracted as some investors cashed out of the recent rally.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Fights at $1,800\n\nEthereum (ETH), the largest altcoin by market capitalization, is under bullish momentum and heading to the $2,000 mark. Ethereum has shown positive momentum in October. On the daily chart, Ethereum\u2019s price has been on a decline since it touched its highest point of $2,141 in April.\n\nHowever, starting from its low point of $1,521 on October 12th, ETH began to climb upward. ETH is currently found at around $1835, up 2.2% in the past 24 hours but down slightly on the weekly chart.\n\nStill, Ethereum technical indicators are bullish. Its RSI is in the overbought position at 74, a sign that the bulls are still in control. Besides, Ethereum has recorded a 3% price increase over the last 30 days.\n\nWhat About Everlodge (ELDG)?\n\nWhile Solana and Ethereum have potential, they depend entirely on the crypto sector. This is not the case with Everlodge. The platform is connected to the crypto market (worth $1.25 trillion) and the real estate sector (worth $280 trillion).\n\nAccording to some analysts, this has made Everlodge a token with interesting potential. It is a platform that is aimed at changing how people invest in real estate. Their plan is to transform valuable properties into digital assets.\n\nThese NFTs will then be divided into smaller portions, each representing a share of property. Unlike other NFTs, the value of these NFTs goes up as the property\u2019s value goes up. As a result, these NFTs can bring in money for NFT holders over the long haul. Additionally, users can choose to sell them whenever they want.\n\nCurrently, Everlodge\u2019s ELDG token is in its sixth presale stage, priced at just $0.023. Meanwhile, the ELDG token has benefits for those who buy it. They include discounts, rewards for staking, VIP membership, and more.\n\nVisit Everlodge\n\nJoin The Everlodge Community\n\nDisclaimer: The above article is sponsored content; it\u2019s written by a third party.

        "title": "Ethereum Price Prediction as ETH Nears $2000 Mark, what is the Best Alternative? - The Tech Report",
        "content": "Since BTC\u2019s price tested $35,000, the broader cryptocurrency market has been moving positively. The positive sentiment influenced the price of the second-largest crypto asset, Ethereum. Today, ETH is approaching the key level of $2,000.\n\nAs Ethereum edges closer to the $2,000 mark, investors are eager to forecast its future trajectory. The question now is, will ETH hit the price mark soon, or will there be a retracement?\n\nFind out more.\n\nRecent Ethereum Price Action\n\nOver the past 24 hours, as reported by CoinGecko, Ethereum has recorded an increase of almost 3% in its trading session. Despite the volatility in the market, ETH maintained its position as the second-largest crypto asset.\n\nLooking at the longer timeframes, Ethereum exhibits a positive strength likely to persist for some time. Over the last week, ETH has gained slightly, signaling signs of improvement in its performance.\n\nAlso, in its two-week price trend, ETH showcased an even more remarkable growth of 18%. In the past 30 days, ETH has consistently displayed a growth rate of 10.7%, solidifying its status as a key player in the broader cryptocurrency market.\n\nMeanwhile, as of 8:2 a.m. EST on November 2, ETH is valued at $1,830, with a trading volume exceeding $20 billion. Notably, CoinGecko reports a trading volume increase of more than 98% within the past 24 hours.\n\nEthereum Price Analysis: Can ETH Hit the $2,000 Price Mark Soon?\n\nLooking at Ethereum\u2019s chart below, the coin has exhibited bullish momentum since October 19, 2023. This has fueled investor confidence and might continue this way if the momentum is sustained.\n\nCurrently, ETH is trading above a key level that used to be a resistance point but is now acting as support at $1,755. This indicates a positive shift in market sentiment.\n\nFurther, the chart shows that there\u2019s an attempt to break through a strong trendline, which, if successful, could push the price toward $2,000. The coin is trading above the Simple Moving Average (SMA) indicator, further reinforcing the optimistic outlook within the market.\n\nLooking at the MACD indicator, it\u2019s above the signal line with green histogram bars, signaling strong bullish momentum. Additionally, ETH\u2019s Relative Strength Index is at 80, validating the bullish pressure in the market.\n\nThe analysis suggests that considering the current momentum, ETH/USDT might reach $2,000 before the end of the year. However, note that if buyers or investors can\u2019t sustain this momentum, the price may drop towards support levels at $1,531 or potentially even down to $1,359.\n\nSo, while ETH\u2019s price is growing today, there\u2019s a need to consider other analyzing tools before deciding. This is because the crypto market is highly volatile, and several factors can affect the price of an asset.\n\nSignificant ETH Transfers to Exchanges: Implications for Price Behaviour\n\nRecently, Whale Alert reported that there have been large movements of ETH to centralized exchanges (CEX). These transactions have sparked reactions among investors and traders alike.\n\nBased on previous actions, when significant amounts of ETH are transferred to exchanges, it often suggests that either investors are preparing to sell or they are positioning themselves for potential trades or transactions.\n\nAccording to Whale Alert, the first transaction was over $15,000 worth of ETH.\n\nThis amount of ETH was moved to the Gate.io exchange on November 1, potentially indicating a readiness to trade or sell ETH. This increased supply of ETH on the exchange can potentially exert downward pressure on its price as more sellers might enter the market.\n\nFurther, the next transaction was more than 20,000 ETH, which was moved to the Coinbase exchange on November 2. Again, this influx of ETH into the exchange could lead to increased selling pressure, potentially influencing the price.\n\nHowever, these transactions are originating from unknown wallets, which means the intentions behind these movements are not clearly stated. Despite this large ETH movement, Santiment data revealed that since October, there has been growth in new Ethereum addresses.\n\nAccording to Santiment, more than 38,000 new addresses have been created in the network. This shows that investors\u2019 confidence is growing significantly.\n\nImportantly, this could potentially affect Ethereum\u2019s price, driving it up to the $2,000 mark. But while all that remains uncertain, investors could diversify to coins on presale.\n\nEthereum Alternative: Meme Kombat Surges Past $1 Million in Presale\n\nThe new web3 meme project, Meme Kombat, has achieved major success in its presale. This project, inspired by the famous Mortal Kombat franchise, has raised $1 million through the presale of its own $MK token.\n\nTraders are eager to get in before the price goes up in a few hours and before the launch of Meme Kombat\u2019s $MK token staking program.\n\nImpressively, the meme project promises high annual percentage yields (APYs) for early participants. Meme Kombat aims to gather at least $5 million by selling 50% of the $MK tokens, currently priced at $0.1667.\n\nEarn 112 APY Via Meme Kombat Staking Feature\n\n>>>Visit Meme Kombat Presale<<<\n\nMeme Kombat\u2019s staking dashboard is set to launch soon, but the date and time have not been revealed by the team. According to the project\u2019s site, early stakers could earn annual percentage yields (APYs) up to 112%.\n\nInvestors who bought $MK tokens in the presale will automatically be part of Meme Kombat\u2019s staking program, so they\u2019ll start earning rewards immediately. Out of all the $MK tokens available, 30% are reserved for staking and rewards, 10% for community rewards, and 10% for providing liquidity on DEX.\n\nThe founder of the project, Matt Whiteman, also serves as the Chief Operations Officer at North Technologies, a Netherlands-based NFT trading and analytics platform. This further strengthens investor\u2019s confidence in the project.\n\nWith that in mind, interested prospects should visit the project\u2019s website and follow the instructions to purchase the token. Note that you can buy the token with USDT or ETH."

        "title": "Why everyone is talking about Solana in 2023 - crypto.news",
        "content": "Solana surges in 2023, joining top blockchains with its unique tech, large user base, and promising price forecasts, challenging Ethereum\u2019s dominance.\n\nAs of 2023, Solana (SOL) has earned its place among the top 3 layer-1 blockchains, sharing the spotlight with giants like Ethereum (ETH) and Binance Chain (BNB).\n\nWhat\u2019s particularly intriguing is that while Solana\u2019s market capitalization sits at about 7.5% of Ethereum\u2019s at nearly $16.5 billion, its daily active user base stands at 66% of Ethereum\u2019s, signaling an engaged and growing community.\n\nOver the last 30 days, SOL\u2019s price experienced a remarkable increase of nearly 90%, with a substantial 30% growth occurring in just the previous week. This aligns with the debut of Firedancer, its highly awaited scaling solution, on the testnet.\n\nMoreover, this year has been kind to Solana, showcasing a marked improvement in metrics such as uptime and transactions per second. Coinbase, a prominent US crypto exchange, acknowledges Solana as a formidable contender to Ethereum in the layer-1 blockchain space.\n\nLet\u2019s uncover the elements fueling Solana\u2019s growth, understand what it is, dissect its technological advancements, and take a closer look at its expanding community and ecosystem.\n\nWhat is Solana, and how does it work?\n\nSolana, often abbreviated as SOL, is a high-performance layer-1 blockchain designed to support decentralized applications (dApps) and crypto projects at large scales.\n\nFor instance, a real-world application on Solana might be a decentralized exchange (DEX) where thousands of trades happen every second. The architecture of Solana facilitates the processing of these trades, aiming for efficiency, security, and accuracy.\n\nSolana introduces a mechanism known as proof of history (PoH), setting it apart from some traditional consensus methods. PoH is designed to generate a historical record to verify the occurrence of an event at a specific time.\n\nThis is achieved by encoding the passage of time in the data before it becomes a part of the ledger. The intention is to streamline the consensus-reaching process across nodes, as they have a shared, trusted notion of time.\n\nThis emphasis on time-saving is further realized in Solana\u2019s Tower BFT, a byzantine fault-tolerant derivative of the Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) consensus.\n\nTower BFT utilizes the synchronized clock provided by PoH to reduce messaging overhead and latency. This allows for faster confirmations of transactions without compromising on security.\n\nSolana also features the Gulf Stream protocol, which attempts to optimize transaction handling by pre-processing and sending them to validators prior to the completion of the previous transaction set. This approach is intended to reduce confirmation times and improve network efficiency.\n\nWhen considering all these mechanisms together, Solana aims to support a high volume of transactions per second, positioning itself as a competitive entity in the blockchain space.\n\nSolana\u2019s tokenomics: understanding SOL\u2019s role and distribution\n\nSolana\u2019s financial structure is centered around its native token, SOL. This token has multiple functions within the network. The primary use of SOL is for transactions and for users to interact with dApps on the Solana platform.\n\nSimply put, if a user wants to carry out an operation or use a dApp on Solana, they need SOL.\n\nYou might also like: Solana close to 1-year high amid declining open interest\n\nStaking is another important function of SOL. Users can help secure the network by staking their SOL tokens. They can do this by either becoming validators themselves or by assigning their tokens to existing validators.\n\nThose who stake their tokens are rewarded, and the annual percentage yield (APY) for this is typically between 7-8%. However, it\u2019s important to mention that this rate can change based on several factors.\n\nValidators play a crucial role in the network\u2019s security. They receive new SOL tokens as rewards, as well as a share of transaction fees. This approach encourages active participation in the network and aims to ensure its stability.\n\nRegarding the distribution of SOL, recent data shows that out of a total supply of 561 million tokens, about 420 million are in circulation. This implies that approximately 141 million SOL tokens have been burned over time.\n\nSolana use cases\n\nSolana\u2019s blockchain technology has nurtured a variety of use cases due to its high scalability and low transaction fees. Here are some notable use cases:\n\nDecentralized finance (defi)\n\nSolana\u2019s high throughput and low transaction fees make it a fertile ground for defi applications like DEXs, lending protocols, and digital wallets. Examples include Solana-based DEXs like Orca and Serum, and lending platforms like Apricot Finance and Solend\u200b.\n\nNon-fungible tokens (NFTs)\n\nSolana facilitates the creation of NFT platforms and marketplaces where users can mint, buy, and sell NFTs. Notable platforms include Metaplex and Solanart, which allow users to interact with digital artwork and other unique assets\u200b.\n\nGaming\n\nSolana hosts games with play-to-earn (P2E) systems, enabling players to earn cryptocurrencies and NFTs through gameplay. Examples include online metaverses like Chainers and Aurory, and survival-puzzle games like Naga Kingdom\u200b.\n\nWeb3 applications\n\nSolana supports the development of web3 apps that leverage modern internet technologies. Examples include Audius, a decentralized audio streaming app, Squads, a treasury fund management application, and Alchemy, a platform for building dApps quickly\u200b.\n\nCross-chain functionality\n\nSolana has also been leveraged for cross-chain transactions, as seen with the integration of USDC-SPL in Trust Wallet, enabling users to send and receive USDC with minimal fees and swift transaction times.\n\nSolana\u2019s hurdles in 2023\n\nIn 2023, Solana navigated a rough path marked by several network outages, casting a shadow on its robustness.\n\nThe most notable was a slowdown in block production on Feb. 25, following an upgrade attempt from validator software version 1.13 to 1.14, which led to considerable disruptions. Efforts to revert to version 1.13 were insufficient, ultimately necessitating a network restart.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/SolanaCompass/status/1629469599774261251?s=20\n\nThe February incident wasn\u2019t singular; Solana contended with multiple outages in the past, spotlighting stability as a critical area for improvement. These technical difficulties attracted criticism from the broader blockchain community and competitors, stirring a debate about Solana\u2019s reliability as a Layer 1 solution.\n\nComplicating matters, the root causes of certain outages remained elusive, even to Solana\u2019s developers, leaving some issues unresolved over extended periods. This ambiguity and the recurring downtimes prompted concerns regarding Solana\u2019s reliability, particularly given the fierce competition in the blockchain space.\n\nSolana long-term trend and price prediction\n\nThe Solana price has attracted attention recently, with many keeping a close eye on insights into its potential trajectory amid bullish market sentiment.\n\nAccording to DigitalCoinPrice, the Solana crypto price is set to reach around $83.44 by the end of 2023. The Solana price prediction for 2024 is approximately $94.60. By 2025, it\u2019s anticipated to climb to $141.53 and $389.83 by 2030.\n\nDespite the potential shown by Solana in various domains, it\u2019s essential to consider the rocky patches it navigated through in 2023, which have led some crypto analysts to project a lower price trajectory for SOL.\n\nReflecting on the slowdown in block production and recurring outages this year, some analysts have exercised caution in their forecasts, predicting an average SOL rate of around $23.89 in January 2024, which could potentially dip to a minimum of $23.34, with a maximum cap at $24.43.\n\nYou might also like: Solana gaining momentum according to Nansen report\n\nYet, those interested in the Solana crypto price should be wary of banking solely on forecasts. The volatile nature of the crypto market, combined with ever-evolving Solana news, suggests that price predictions shouldn\u2019t be the sole basis for investment decisions.\n\nInvestors must exercise caution and adhere to the cardinal rule of investing: never invest more than you can afford to lose. It\u2019s advisable to conduct thorough research, understand the inherent risks, and consider seeking advice from financial advisors before making any investment decisions.\n\nDisclosure: This article does not represent investment advice.

        "title": "Up 300% This Year, Can Solana Regain Its All-Time High of $260? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Solana (SOL 0.72%) has easily been one of the top performing cryptos of the year. If you think Bitcoin is red hot at the moment, just consider Solana's remarkable performance: The crypto is up 70% over the past 30 days and more than 300% for the year. Solana now trades at about $41, roughly where it was when cryptocurrency exchange FTX imploded last November.\n\nSolana's recent stellar performance has analysts trying to figure out how much higher this crypto might go. Some have suggested that Solana will eventually make a run at its all-time high of $260, which it reached back in 2021 during the peak of the last crypto bull market rally. From my perspective, two key things need to happen for that to occur.\n\nWin back investor trust\n\nFirst and foremost, Solana needs to win back investor trust. Due to the role that failed crypto exchange FTX (and former FTX Chief Executive Officer Sam Bankman-Fried) played in the rise of Solana, there is still quite a bit of uneasiness about this crypto. Complicating matters is the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which suggested back in June that Solana might actually be an unregistered security. As a result, there is arguably more fear, uncertainty, and doubt hanging over Solana than many of its rivals.\n\nA big point in Solana's favor, though, has been its ability to win over large institutional investors. CoinShares, which tracks the inflow and outflow of institutional funds into different cryptocurrencies, has found that there have been net inflows into Solana in 28 of 32 weeks this year. Even more impressive, Solana seems to be beating out Ethereum as the altcoin of choice of institutional investors. While Solana has been seeing net inflows, Ethereum has actually been seeing net outflows.\n\nDisplace Ethereum as the top blockchain\n\nHowever, winning back investors is the easy part for Solana. The hard part is creating a world-class blockchain that can take on Ethereum. That was the initial promise of Solana back in 2021, when it was routinely being touted as an Ethereum killer. But that simply hasn't happened. Ethereum, with a $216 billion market cap, still dwarfs Solana, which has a $17 billion market cap.\n\nMoreover, if you take a quick look at blockchain niches where Solana was supposed to challenge Ethereum, the numbers are disappointing. For example, within the world of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), Solana was supposed to overtake Ethereum. But the latest data from CryptoSlam shows that Ethereum is still doing six times more monthly NFT sales volume than Solana, and the figure is even higher when you add in the NFT sales volume from the Layer-2 blockchains reside on top of Ethereum.\n\nBut that doesn't mean that Solana won't eventually overtake Ethereum. After all, Solana has a new mobile crypto strategy that is trying to make Solana the world's first mobile-optimized blockchain. As part of this strategy, Solana recently released its first hardware product, the Saga crypto phone. If successful, continued hardware product launches on an annual basis could drive rapid growth.\n\nInvestment firm VanEck, which recently published a report suggesting that Solana might soar in value by more than 10,000% by 2030, says that Solana needs to develop a \"killer app\" capable of onboarding 100 million users. This could be a new payment app or a new social networking app.\n\nIn a world where ChatGPT was able to attract 100 million users in just two months, it's certainly not out of the range of possibility that Solana might be able to develop a similar type of killer app. But it's not very likely. When discussing Solana in its report, VanEck brought up the Infinite Monkey Theorem. The theorem says that an infinite number of monkeys, incessantly banging away on typewriters, will eventually be able to produce the complete works of William Shakespeare. In the case of Solana, an infinite number of developers banging away on their keyboards might be able to develop a killer app.\n\nWhat is the probability of hitting $260?\n\nUltimately, thinking about Solana's future price requires thinking about probabilities. It's important to assign a range of probabilities to different outcomes to determine which scenario is most likely to happen next. For example, while there is a scenario where Solana increases in value by 10-fold and blows past $260, there's also a scenario where Solana collapses and falls all the way back to $10.\n\nSo keep your expectations for Solana in check. While it's quite likely that Solana will continue its recovery into 2024, especially if Bitcoin continues to rally, a lot needs to go right for Solana to make a realistic run at its all-time high of $260."

        "content": "Former Goldman Sachs executive and macro guru, Raoul Pal, has made a bold prediction, projecting that Ethereum ETH/USD could surge by over 75% by December.\n\nWhat Happened: Pal took to X, to share his thoughts on the matter, \u201cTechnically speaking \u2013 ETH is a gorgeous, gorgeous chart.\u201d\n\nAccording to his chart, Pal envisions ETH reaching $3,250 by the end of the year. At the time of writing, ETH was trading at $1833.\n\nAs Pal shares his optimistic outlook, he is not alone in his beliefs. Analysts in the crypto community are also pinpointing a bullish streak for Ethereum. Crypto Tony expressed his perspective on Twitter, stating, \u201c$2,000 $ETH is only a few weeks away, I would say personally. The Altcoin market looks to be heating up nicely.\u201d\n\nAnother analyst, under the pseudonym Mayne, highlighted the strength of Ethereum\u2019s signal within their system. They tweeted, \u201c$ETH This is a really strong HTF (high time frame) signal for my system. Weekly SFP (swing failure pattern) + breaker on ETH. I\u2019m already super longer, looking to add more.\u201d\n\nAdding weight to these sentiments, veteran trader Peter Brandt chimed in, saying, \u201cAnother example of classical charting principles. Completion today of a small 9-day flag reconfirms Oct 23 completion of right-angled expanding triangle $ETH.\u201d\n\nBrandt\u2019s statement about the completion of a small 9-day flag and a right-angled expanding triangle for Ethereum suggests a positive outlook. These chart patterns are commonly seen as bullish signals in classical technical analysis. Their completion indicates potential upward momentum for ETH, further supporting the predictions of a bullish streak in the near future.\n\nWill The SEC Finally Approve Long-Awaited Bitcoin Spot ETF?

Over the past week, Bitcoin's price has appreciated by over 2%.\n\nEthereum's price didn't lag behind, with a 2.29% increase, now trading at $1,846.22, accompanied by a 66.85% rise in one-day volume, reaching $11.38 billion.\n\nSimultaneously, XRP's price also saw a 3.24% rise, landing at $0.606, while its 24-hour volume decreased by 14.42% to $1.87 billion.\n\nAmong other prominent cryptocurrencies, Solana's price surged by 9.94% to $41.82, while Cardano's price witnessed a 6.42% jump, with trading volumes rising by 151.41% and 13.46% to $3.74 billion and $357.96 million, respectively.\n\nEven meme coins joined in on the optimism, with Dogecoin's price increasing by 2.62% to $0.06889, although with a 0.23% decrease in trading volume to $483.85 million.\n\nOn the other hand, Shiba Inu's price surged by 3.53% to $0.000007959, with trading volume up 5.58% from the previous day, reaching $169.30 million.\n\nThese gains across major cryptocurrencies contributed to a notable upswing in the overall crypto market.\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market cap rose by 2.85% from the previous day, reaching $1.31 trillion, with a market fear and greed index reading of 74, indicating a \"greed\" sentiment.\n\nThe total market cap increased by 43.49% in the last 24 hours, now standing at $57.9 billion.\n\nThe crypto market's surge underscores the growing interest in digital assets, with all eyes on the Federal Reserve's forthcoming stance, set to have a significant impact on the market's future trajectory."

        "title": "Digital Assets Soar In 2023: Bitcoin And Ethereum Outperform Traditional Assets - TronWeekly",
        "content": "The digital asset market in 2023 continues to impress, with both Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) outperforming traditional assets such as gold by 93% and 39%, respectively. Market corrections for these major cryptocurrencies have been shallower than in previous cycles, indicating strong investor support and positive capital inflows.\n\nThe digital asset market continues to post impressive performance, with $BTC and $ETH appreciating meaningfully against USD and gold.#Bitcoin dominance also continues to rise, outpacing traditional and digital assets.\n\n\n\nRead more in our latest analysis\ud83d\udc47https://t.co/e2Js9FinHY pic.twitter.com/yIRh1WRtFA \u2014 glassnode (@glassnode) November 1, 2023\n\nGlassnode\u2019s latest analysis reveals the digital asset market\u2019s robust performance and the data presents various key insights. BTC prices have surged by over 30% in recent weeks, partly due to positive developments related to Bitcoin ETF applications awaiting approval from the SEC. Comparatively, BTC and other digital assets have outperformed traditional asset classes like commodities, precious metals, equities, and bonds.\n\nBoth Bitcoin and Ethereum have exhibited remarkable relative strength in 2023, with BTC gaining 93% in gold terms and Ether rising by 39%. This impressive performance coincides with growing global uncertainty, attracting the attention of traditional investors.\n\nThe correlation between their returns on a rolling 30-day basis is evident, with similar downswings and BTC displaying stronger performance during upswings. Digital assets also exhibit higher volatility compared to gold.\n\nWhen examining the deepest corrections during macro uptrends, Ethereum has outperformed by experiencing a milder correction of -26% from its 2023 high, compared to -60% or more in previous cycles. BTC\u2019s deepest correction in 2023 has been just -20.1%, considerably better than previous cycles.\n\nRising Bitcoin Dominance\n\nHowever, Bitcoin dominance, which measures its market cap relative to the entire digital asset market, has been steadily increasing, reaching 53% in 2023, up from a low of 38% in late 2022. It suggests a prolonged trend where Bitcoin\u2019s dominance rises in the aftermath of bear markets.\n\nThe Altcoin Indicator highlights positive market momentum for digital assets, supported by capital inflows into BTC, Ethereum, and stablecoins. This indicator turned positive on October 20th, preceding a significant BTC price increase.\n\nWhile altcoins have seen a notable 37% increase in market cap, BTC surged 110% in 2023. It indicates that while altcoins are outperforming traditional assets and fiat currencies, they still lag behind the performance of Bitcoin.\n\nRelated Reading | MicroStrategy\u2019s Q3: 158,400 Bitcoin & AI Integration Drive Strong Performance"
