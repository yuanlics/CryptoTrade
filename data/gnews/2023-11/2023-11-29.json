        "title": "Best Places to Buy Ethereum for 2024 - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "What is Ethereum?\n\nEthereum was the first cryptocurrency to introduce smart contracts. A smart contract is a tiny piece of code that lives on the blockchain, and it's the technology behind the decentralized finance (DeFi) industry. A large proportion of decentralized applications are built on the Ethereum ecosystem, although Ethereum now has a lot of competitors that want to take some of its market share.\n\nWhere can you buy Ethereum?\n\nYou can buy Ethereum from almost any cryptocurrency platform. You can even buy Ethereum from some Bitcoin ATMs in the U.S. Let's look at the differences between apps, exchanges and brokers.\n\nCryptocurrency brokers: Several traditional stock brokers offer a limited selection of cryptocurrencies alongside their other products. These are a great option for people who want to add Ethereum to their investment portfolio without opening a new crypto exchange account. Be aware that most crypto brokers don't offer external wallets so it may not be easy to withdraw or deposit crypto assets.\n\nSeveral traditional stock brokers offer a limited selection of cryptocurrencies alongside their other products. These are a great option for people who want to add Ethereum to their investment portfolio without opening a new crypto exchange account. Be aware that most crypto brokers don't offer external wallets so it may not be easy to withdraw or deposit crypto assets. Cryptocurrency exchanges: These are the most common way to buy and sell cryptocurrencies, and plenty of exchanges offer lots of ways to deposit fiat currency (such as U.S. dollars), reasonable fees, and a sizable list of tradable coins. On the downside, these exchanges are not subject to the same regulations as stock brokers.\n\nThese are the most common way to buy and sell cryptocurrencies, and plenty of exchanges offer lots of ways to deposit fiat currency (such as U.S. dollars), reasonable fees, and a sizable list of tradable coins. On the downside, these exchanges are not subject to the same regulations as stock brokers. Cryptocurrency apps: Most cryptocurrency brokers and exchanges also have mobile apps to make it easy to trade on the go. You can also buy Ethereum using payment apps such as Venmo and Paypal.\n\nWhat to look for when buying Ethereum\n\nBuying Ethereum for the first time can be a little daunting. But there are a lot of excellent products out there, it's just a question of finding the right platform for you.\n\nHere are some key questions to help you find the best place to buy Ethereum.\n\n1. What fees will you have to pay?\n\nBroadly speaking, there are three types of fees to watch out for:\n\nDeposit fees\n\nTrading fees\n\nWithdrawal fees\n\nWe'll break these down in more detail below. Just be aware that fees are rarely standard across the various trading platforms. For example, you might find a cryptocurrency exchange that offers free trading but charges you a lot of money to withdraw your funds.\n\nDon't be afraid to open a couple of accounts and experiment. But don't deposit any money until you're comfortable with the fee structure.\n\n2. How will the platform secure your assets?\n\nCryptocurrency investment is an exciting world, but unfortunately it has attracted its fair share of bad actors. In addition to the risk of hacking, the collapse of FTX also demonstrated that we don't always know what an exchange is doing with your money. Simply put, cryptocurrency exchanges don't have the same investor protections and security as you'd find in banks and other financial institutions.\n\nIf a crypto exchange or broker is not transparent about its security systems, this should be a major red flag. Sometimes you'll read that a company doesn't want to disclose these details for security reasons, but that's misleading. There's plenty of information a trading platform can reveal without compromising its systems.\n\n3. Are there any sign-up bonuses?\n\nSome platforms offer sign-up bonuses for new investors. You might find a platform that gives you a small bonus when you start, or one that offers a bonus when you make a certain amount of trades or deposit a certain amount of money. While these are tempting, don't let them drive your decision-making. It may be a great tie breaker, but there's no point in signing up for the wrong exchange just because you want the bonus.\n\n4. Is it available in my country or state?\n\nSome cryptocurrency exchanges can't operate in the U.S., and only a handful are licensed to operate in every state. For example, New York has some of the strictest crypto exchange regulation and will actively pursue rule breakers. As such, it's good to check that the exchange you want to use is allowed to operate where you live.\n\n5. Does it have all the features you need?\n\nIf you're buying Ethereum for the first time, you'll want an easy-to-use platform with plenty of educational resources. If you prefer mobile apps to web browsers, look for an exchange with a good app.\n\nOther useful features include:\n\nThe ability to set up automatic monthly transfers\n\nGood customer service\n\nAn external wallet\n\nWe'll talk about wallets in more detail shortly. If you're an active Ethereum trader, you might also want advanced features such as limit orders and good charting tools.\n\n6. Can I stake or earn interest on my Ethereum?\n\nLast year, Ethereum moved to what's called a proof-of-stake system, changing the way it validates transactions. It is part of a wider upgrade to make the popular blockchain more scalable, more sustainable, and more secure.\n\nWithout getting too technical, one impact is that investors can stake their ETH tokens to earn rewards. Proof-of-stake cryptos pay rewards to holders who are willing to tie up their tokens to contribute to network security. As a long-term investor, this is a great way to earn passive income from your Ethereum investment.\n\nHowever, be aware that there's a difference between staking and the crypto lend-earn products offered by some platforms. Some exchanges use the word \"staking\" for any kind of activity that will generate interest. But there's a big difference. When a crypto earn platform offers high rates of interest, you don't know what risks it is taking with your assets. And if it collapses, you could lose your crypto completely.\n\n7. Does it have a wide selection of cryptocurrencies?\n\nIf you only want to buy Ethereum or Bitcoin (BTC), you won't need an exchange with lots of tokens. However, if you see buying Ethereum as the first step on a longer crypto-trading journey, a long list of altcoins is a bonus. It's worth understanding an exchange's policy on adding new coins too -- does it try to filter out potential scams or is it looking to list as many coins as possible?\n\nCheck out our cryptocurrency exchange reviews for more options."

        "content": "Ethereum has formed a \u201cgolden cross\u201d pattern on the 1-week timeframe, marking the second such signal this year. While the long-term implications could be very positive if history repeats itself, there are reasons to temper expectations.\n\nA weekly golden cross has formed | ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nEthereum Golden Cross And A Possible Target For New ATHs\n\n1W ETHUSD has formed a golden cross for the second time in 2023. A golden cross is a buy signal in moving average-based trading systems. It suggests that the trend is moving in an upward direction and because trends tend to persist, this is notable.\n\nThe golden signal occurs when a shorter-term moving average (the 50-week MA) crosses through a longer-term moving average (the 200-week MA) from below. A death cross forms when the opposite happens.\n\nThe last confirmed golden cross for Ethereum in December 2020 preceded a massive 600% rally over the next year to the asset\u2019s all-time high near $4,900. A repeat move of similar magnitude this time would put Ethereum above $12,000\u2014over six times today\u2019s price of around $2,000.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that not all golden crosses lead to the anticipated upside. In 2023 alone, 1W ETHUSD has death crossed and golden crossed twice now, demonstrating how moving average-based systems are prone to whipsaw without an established trend to follow.\n\nAbove 20 on the ADX confirms the trend | ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nAn Uptrend Or More Whipsaw? How The ADX Confirms Trends\n\nThe whipsawing death cross and golden cross price action on the Ethereum 1-week chart failed to generate follow-through in either direction. So how can we be sure that this isn\u2019t yet another premature crossover?\n\nThis is where the Average Directional Index (ADX) comes in when gauging the validity of moving average crosses. The ADX aims to measure trend strength, typically on a scale of 0 to 100.\n\nAs the 1-week ADX edges up from below 20, it confirms growing momentum that reduces the odds of more whipsawing price action. Traders often use such ADX readings to confirm golden/death crosses and enter only the most high-conviction signals.\n\nThe 1W ETHUSD Average Directional Index isn\u2019t yet above 20, but is approaching this key level. Above it, it gives the golden cross much more validity.\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

Understand that both digital assets have unique features of their own, distinguishable in terms of purpose and functionality.\n\nIn this article, we will help you compare and contrast these two cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and Ethereum. We will also help you see and forecast how they will play out in the future of digital assets.\n\nUnleash the potential of leverage trading!

Don\u2019t miss out on this exclusive offer; claim your bonus now!\n\nWhat is Bitcoin?\n\nBitcoin, a digital currency, operates without reliance on central authorities such as banks or governments. Satoshi Nakamoto, a pseudonym, introduced Bitcoin in 2009. Bitcoin has established a significant presence so far as the pioneer and most valuable asset in the burgeoning cryptocurrency domain.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s goal is to enable decentralized peer-to-peer transactions. In the Bitcoin network, transactions undergo authentication via a proof-of-work consensus mechanism. Bitcoin mining involves users validating transactions on the network. This process confirms the consistency of new transactions with previous ones, ensuring the impossibility of spending non-existent or already spent Bitcoins. This system also incentivizes cryptocurrency miners by rewarding them with BTC for validating transactions.\n\nMining is the backbone of Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain technology. This feature enables a public, unalterable ledger of transactions, organized into interconnected blocks. The blockchain ensures transactional integrity, maintaining a consistent record across the network.\n\nUnleash the potential of leverage trading! Join Bybit today with our link, complete KYC, and earn up to a $40 bonus on a $100 deposit. Don\u2019t miss out on this exclusive offer; claim your bonus now!\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Strengths\n\nCost-Efficiency and Speed \u2013 Bitcoin transactions offer significant cost savings and speed. Bitcoin can be used for global transfers, reducing both time and potential costs associated with peer-to-peer transactions.\n\nEnhanced Privacy \u2013 Unlike traditional transactions, Bitcoin transactions do not record personal information like names or credit card numbers. While wallet ownership can potentially be linked to individuals, Bitcoin transactions generally offer greater privacy than, say, credit card transactions.\n\nDecentralization \u2013 Bitcoin operates independently of conventional banks, governments, or third parties, presenting an attractive alternative for those wary of traditional financial systems.\n\nGrowth Potential \u2013 Many investors hold Bitcoin with the expectation that its value will increase as it becomes more trusted and widely used. This long-term perspective is based on the belief in Bitcoin\u2019s maturing market and potential for value appreciation.\n\nWhat is Ethereum?\n\nEthereum represents a significant evolution in blockchain technology, functioning as a decentralized network backed by the Ether (ETH) token. The platform enables a wide array of activities, such as automated transaction execution, token staking, minting and trading of nonfungible tokens (NFTs), and blockchain games, among others.\n\nOften regarded as the next evolutionary stage of the internet, Ethereum is likened to the transition from Web 2.0 to Web 3.0. It ushered in innovations such as decentralized applications (DApps), decentralized finance (DeFi), and decentralized exchanges (DEXs).\n\nLike Bitcoin, Ethereum transactions are recorded in blocks on the Ethereum blockchain. These transactions are validated by miners. Successful miners receive rewards in ETH, Ethereum\u2019s native cryptocurrency. However, Ethereum is already working on a full transition towards a full proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus model as it shifts to Ethereum 2.0. This step seeks to resolve scalability issues on Ethereum\u2019s blockchain.\n\nDiffering from Bitcoin, ETH functions more as a utility token with an infinite supply. Ether is continually introduced into circulation as mining rewards and will also be issued as staking rewards in the network\u2019s anticipated shift to a proof-of-stake (PoS) model.\n\nUnleash the potential of leverage trading! Join Bybit today with our link, complete KYC, and earn up to a $40 bonus on a $100 deposit. Don\u2019t miss out on this exclusive offer; claim your bonus now!\n\nEthereum\u2019s Strengths\n\nSmart Contracts \u2013 Ethereum revolutionizes traditional finance through smart contracts, enabling different functions and services without the need for middlemen. These contracts are immutable once established, ensuring transparency and fairness in transactions without intermediaries.\n\nEase of Acquiring Ether \u2013 Acquiring Ether has become increasingly accessible with mainstream financial platforms like PayPal and Venmo allowing users to purchase cryptocurrencies directly within their applications. This integration exposes a vast user base to Ethereum.\n\nAccess to DeFi services \u2013 Many DeFi projects in the cryptocurrency space are developed on top of the Ethereum blockchain. Owning ETH makes it easier for holders to access a wide array of DeFi products and services, such as NFT trading, staking, yield farming, and more.\n\nComparing Bitcoin and Ethereum\n\nBoth Bitcoin and Ethereum are blockchain-based, but they differ significantly in their technical specifications. Bitcoin uses a Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism, requiring miners to solve complex problems, limiting scalability and energy efficiency. Ethereum also uses PoW but is transitioning to Proof of Stake (PoS), which is more scalable and environmentally friendly.\n\nThe transaction speed of both is lower compared to traditional payment systems, with Bitcoin at about 7 transactions per second and Ethereum at 15. However, both are developing solutions like SegWit, Lightning Network, and sharding to improve this. Additionally, Ethereum\u2019s use of the Turing-complete language Solidity allows for more complex applications than Bitcoin\u2019s Script language\u200b\u200b.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s primary role is as a store of value and medium of exchange, with secondary functions including remittances and financial inclusion. Ethereum, however, serves primarily as a platform for running smart contracts and dApps, impacting various industries such as finance, gaming, and healthcare. Ethereum also supports the issuance of various digital tokens and is a key player in the decentralized finance (DeFi) movement\u200b\u200b.\n\nFinally, both cryptocurrencies have seen remarkable price fluctuations. BTC\u2019s price has soared since its inception, reflecting its dominance and adoption but also its volatility. ETH, though younger, has shown rapid growth and innovation, hosting numerous dApps and transactions. However, it faces significant price volatility.\n\nUnleash the potential of leverage trading! Join Bybit today with our link, complete KYC, and earn up to a $40 bonus on a $100 deposit. Don\u2019t miss out on this exclusive offer; claim your bonus now!\n\nFuture of Bitcoin and Ethereum\n\nThe future of Bitcoin and Ethereum will primarily be shaped by their ongoing developments. Bitcoin, established as a digital store of value akin to gold, is likely to continue its role as a major player in the cryptocurrency market. Its fixed supply cap and widespread recognition contribute to its potential as a hedge against inflation and economic instability. However, scalability issues and environmental concerns related to its PoW mechanism may continue to influence its adoption.\n\nEthereum\u2019s future is geared towards extensive application in decentralized systems, given its transition to a PoS consensus mechanism and focus on smart contracts and dApps. This shift not only addresses scalability and environmental sustainability but also broadens its utility in various sectors like finance, healthcare, and entertainment. Ethereum\u2019s adaptability and innovation, particularly in the DeFi and NFT spaces, position it as a key driver in the advancement of Web 3.0, potentially revolutionizing how we interact with digital services and assets.\n\nEnhance Your Crypto Trading Skills With Our Legends\u2019 Trading Masterclass\n\nEmpower your crypto trading skills with our Legends Masterclass.

        "content": "Trading-focused Layer 1 blockchain Sei SEI +0.27% will add support for the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) in its upcoming version 2 (V2) upgrade. This will enable developers to port Ethereum-based contracts over to the network and use them on it.\n\nTo add this feature, Sei V2 will incorporate Geth, a Go implementation of the Ethereum Virtual Machine. Geth is the most widely used Ethereum client software.\n\nSei Labs told The Block that it has developed a specialized interface to facilitate interaction of Sei's existing smart contracts component (based on CosmWasm technology) with the EVM component. CosmWasm is a custom Cosmos SDK module that allows chains to operate smart contracts in the Cosmos ecosystem. With V2, the team will enable an efficient integration of EVM support into the Sei network.\n\n\"Sei V2 is an additive change. All of the existing components like CosmWasm will continue to exist. Since this is a proposed chain modification, the different virtual machines will also be able to interact with each other, allowing for Sei V2 to be the first network where EVM and Cosmwasm contracts are able to call each other,\" Jay Jog, co-founder at Sei Labs told The Block.\n\nExpanding on Sei V1\n\nSei has been operational on the mainnet beta since the V1 launch in August, offering support for Cosmos smart contracts written in Rust. With Sei V2, the team behind it aims to broaden its appeal to a wider range of developers. The development will add a fully parallelized EVM-compatible layer with sub-second finality (the speed at which transactions are confirmed).\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nIn addition to EVM support, Sei V2 introduces SeiDB, a data structure that purports to improve the platform\u2019s storage layer. According to the team, SeiDB will prevent state bloat \u2014 where the network becomes excessively data heavy \u2014 and simplify the state synchronization process for new nodes. The objective here is to boost the overall performance and scalability of the Sei blockchain.\n\nThe Sei V2 upgrade is currently nearing completion from a code development perspective and is undergoing a rigorous audit process to ensure its security. It is scheduled to be released on a public testnet in the first quarter of 2024, with the mainnet deployment expected in the first half of the year.\n\nWhat is Sei?\n\nSei is a Cosmos SDK-based proof-of-stake blockchain, designed to be optimized for trading with its ability to execute sub-second blocks. In April 2023, Sei Labs, the core developer of the network, raised $30 million in two strategic funding rounds from venture firms including Jump and Multicoin Capital.\n\nWith functionality that supports fast decentralized trading, Sei targets a specific niche where it competes with other Cosmos chains like Osmosis, Kava, Injective, Neutron and Kujira."

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nHere are the top three news stories by U.Today from the past day.\n\nEthereum's Vitalik Buterin says AI could pose \"existential risk\"\n\nIn a recently published longread essay on his blog, Ethereum cofounder Vitalik Buterin has issued an unsettling warning about AI. According to Buterin, AI could potentially outsmart humans and take over as the dominant power on Earth. He cautions that if a superintelligent AI saw humans as a threat, it could lead to disastrous consequences. Even though these issues seem that they will be a pain in the neck for our descendants in the distant future, one should keep in mind the rapid pace at which AI is advancing. Additionally, we still have not figured out how to program these super intelligent beings to live safely alongside humans. Buterin also challenges his readers to imagine living in a society ruled by artificial intelligence, referring to Iain Banks's Culture series, where humans coexist with powerful AI. In this imagined future, humans are offered longevity, health and entertainment, but at the cost of control over AI.\n\nElon Musk's X secures new payment license in key US state\n\nOn Nov. 27, Elon Musk-owned X platform achieved an important milestone on its path to becoming the \"everything app\"; it secured a money transmitter license from South Dakota regulators. The license enables the company to facilitate seamless cross-border money transfers. In total, X can provide money transmitting services in 10 American states: Arizona, Georgia, Iowa, Maryland, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and, newly added, South Dakota. With its most recent license, X might strengthen its position as a strong competitor in the financial services industry, comparable to well-known firms like Stripe and PayPal.\n\nShiba Inu (SHIB) cryptic text thrills community"

With Everstake\u2019s wallet, you can participate in Ethereum staking and earn rewards. Yearn for a profitable venture? Consider Everstake for your staking needs.\n\nUnderstanding the Basics of Ethereum Staking\n\nWhat is Ethereum Staking?\n\nTo gain a clear understanding of Ethereum staking with Everstake, a leading crypto staking provider, it\u2019s important to first differentiate it from traditional mining. Unlike mining, which involves solving complex mathematical problems to validate transactions, staking allows users to participate in the network by holding and securing their crypto assets in private transactions. This can be done individually or through staking pools offered by Everstake. While mining involves solving complex mathematical puzzles to validate transactions and secure the network on the Ethereum blockchain, staking operates on a different principle known as proof-of-stake. Staked ETH is a form of crypto that is used in the staking process. Everstake is a platform that offers staking services for various cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum.\n\nThe Significance of Proof-of-Stake\n\nProof-of-stake, also known as crypto staking, is a consensus mechanism used in blockchain networks like Ethereum. It involves the participation of staking validators, such as Everstake, and can also be done through liquid staking. Unlike proof-of-work (used in mining), where miners compete to solve computational puzzles, proof-of-stake relies on validators who are chosen based on their stake, or the amount of cryptocurrency they hold and \u201cstake\u201d in the network. This applies to liquid staking, eth staking, and staked eth, which are popular methods used by validators like Everstake.\n\nThis shift to proof-of-stake brings several advantages. First, crypto significantly reduces energy consumption since validators don\u2019t need powerful hardware to solve puzzles in liquid staking pools. Additionally, it enables private transactions. This makes staking more environmentally friendly compared to mining.\n\nThe Role of Validators\n\nValidators play a crucial role in the staking process. They are responsible for proposing and validating new blocks on the Ethereum blockchain, including crypto, liquid staking, private transactions, and pools. To become a validator in the crypto world, one needs to meet certain requirements such as holding a minimum amount of Ether (ETH) and running specialized software for liquid staking.\n\nValidators in the crypto network are incentivized through rewards for their participation in securing the network, including liquid staking and eth staking. Additionally, validators play a crucial role in maintaining the privacy of transactions, ensuring private transactions remain secure. These rewards come in the form of additional ETH generated through block validation, private transactions, and transaction fees paid by crypto users participating in liquid staking with their tokens.\n\nValidator Keys and Responsibilities\n\nWhen becoming a validator for private transactions, individuals generate two keys: an activation key and a withdrawal key for liquid staking of their crypto tokens. The activation key is used during the setup process to activate their validator status in private transactions, while the withdrawal key allows them to exit the staking process and withdraw their funds from everstake pools when desired.\n\nOnce activated, validators must perform various tasks efficiently. In private transactions, they need to propose new blocks by creating cryptographic signatures using their activation keys for liquid staking and eth staking. This ensures the security of the token. In liquid staking, participants must attest or confirm the validity of other proposed blocks by signing them with their eth staking keys. This process helps secure the token pools.\n\nLiquid Staking and Smart Staking\n\nLiquid staking is an emerging concept that allows everstake to use staked assets in other financial activities through pools. The steth token is utilized in this process. Everstake\u2019s liquid staking pools allow users to access the value of their staked Ethereum (stETH) without waiting for the lock-up period to end. This flexibility makes staking with Everstake more appealing as it provides liquidity and potential additional earning opportunities through pools and StETH.\n\nSmart staking, also known as everstake, involves the use of smart contracts on the Ethereum network to automate and simplify the staking process in steth pools. These liquid staking contracts handle various aspects such as delegation, rewards distribution, and penalties for misbehavior in eth staking. Everstake is a reliable provider for these contracts.\n\nPros and Cons of Ethereum Staking Yields\n\nAdvantages of Ethereum Staking Yields\n\nEarning yields through Ethereum staking with everstake offers several advantages, especially for those looking for a liquid investment option. One significant benefit of liquid staking and everstake is the reduced energy consumption compared to traditional mining methods. Unlike mining, which requires powerful hardware and consumes substantial amounts of electricity, staking involves validating transactions on the blockchain by holding a certain amount of cryptocurrency in a wallet. With everstake, you can stake your eth and earn rewards while keeping your assets liquid. This process, known as proof-of-stake (PoS), significantly reduces the environmental impact associated with energy-intensive eth staking and mining operations. With liquid staking, you can easily participate in eth staking through platforms like everstake.\n\nAnother advantage of Ethereum staking with Everstake is the potential for higher returns on investment in liquid assets. By participating in staking with Everstake, individuals can earn additional ETH tokens as rewards for helping secure the network in a liquid form. These rewards are typically proportional to the amount of cryptocurrency being staked, including liquid staking and eth staking. Everstake is a popular platform for participating in these staking activities. With the increasing popularity and adoption of cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, stakers have the opportunity to generate passive income over time through liquid staking with everstake.\n\nStaking with Everstake provides an added layer of security to the liquid Ethereum network. Everstake validators who participate in ETH staking help maintain consensus and verify liquid transactions on the blockchain. By participating in eth staking, individuals contribute to making the network more robust and resistant to attacks or malicious behavior. This can be achieved through liquid staking with Everstake.\n\nDisadvantages of Ethereum Staking Yields\n\nWhile there are numerous benefits to earning yields through Ethereum staking with Everstake, it\u2019s essential to be aware of potential risks and drawbacks associated with this liquid process. One notable risk for validators participating in liquid staking on the Everstake platform is the potential for slashing penalties if they engage in malicious behavior or experience prolonged periods of downtime with their ETH holdings. Slashing refers to a penalty imposed on validators in the liquid staking network, such as Everstake, that can result in a partial or complete loss of their ETH stake if they act against network rules or fail to perform their duties properly.\n\nAnother disadvantage of liquid staking with Everstake is that during times when market conditions are unfavorable, ETH stakers may face potential losses due to price volatility. The value of liquid staking cryptocurrencies like eth can fluctuate significantly within short periods, impacting the overall profitability of staked assets.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to consider that not all cryptocurrencies, such as ETH, support staking or offer comparable yield rates. Liquid cryptocurrencies are particularly noteworthy in this regard. Ethereum, for instance, has been transitioning from a proof-of-work (PoW) to a proof-of-stake (PoS) model through the implementation of Ethereum 2.0, which includes the adoption of liquid staking. While this transition presents exciting opportunities for stakers of eth, it\u2019s crucial to stay informed about any updates or changes that may affect the liquid staking process.\n\nWeighing the Pros and Cons\n\nWhen considering whether Ethereum staking is right for you, it\u2019s essential to carefully weigh the pros and cons of this liquid investment opportunity. The reduced energy consumption of staking ETH and the potential for higher returns make it an attractive option for individuals looking to earn passive income while supporting the network\u2019s security. Staking ETH provides a liquid and sustainable way to participate in the network. However, the risks associated with liquid staking, slashing penalties, and eth price volatility should not be overlooked.\n\nIt\u2019s recommended to conduct thorough research, assess personal risk tolerance, and consider factors such as available capital, time commitment, and understanding of cryptocurrency markets before engaging in Ethereum staking. Staying updated on developments within the Ethereum ecosystem can help make informed decisions regarding participation in staking activities.\n\nMaximizing Returns through Strategic ETH Staking\n\nSelect Reliable Validators for Higher Rewards and Lower Fees\n\nTo optimize your earnings from Ethereum staking, it is crucial to choose reliable validators that offer high rewards and charge low fees. By carefully selecting validators for liquid staking, you can maximize the returns on your staked ETH tokens. When considering liquid staking, it is essential to seek out validators who have a proven track record of consistent payouts and a strong reputation within the eth community.\n\nDiversify Your Portfolio to Mitigate Risk\n\nAllocating your stakes across multiple validators is an effective strategy to mitigate risk in Ethereum staking. By diversifying your portfolio with liquid staking, you reduce the potential impact of any single eth validator\u2019s downtime or slashing events. Liquid staking ensures that even if one eth validator experiences issues, your overall earnings won\u2019t be severely affected. Consider spreading out your stakes among different validators with varying performance histories to maximize the benefits of liquid staking with eth.\n\nStay Updated on Market Trends for Maximum Returns\n\nThe cryptocurrency market is dynamic and constantly evolving. To maximize your returns from Ethereum staking, it\u2019s essential to stay updated on market trends and adjust your stake accordingly.

Choose a reputable wallet provider that supports staking, such as MetaMask or Ledger Live, for your eth.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve selected an ETH wallet provider, follow their instructions to create an account and set up your ETH wallet. Make sure to securely store your ETH recovery phrase or seed phrase, as it will be crucial for accessing your ETH wallet in case of any unforeseen circumstances.\n\nChoosing a Reputable Staking Platform\n\nSelecting the right staking platform for eth is crucial for optimizing your yield generation. Consider factors such as reputation, security measures, fees, user experience, and ETH when choosing a platform that aligns with your goals and preferences.\n\nResearch different staking platforms available in the market for eth and evaluate their track records. Look for platforms that have been operating successfully for some time and have positive reviews from users. When searching for platforms to invest in, it is important to consider their track record and the feedback from users. This will help you make an informed decision and choose a platform that has a proven history of success. Additionally, positive reviews from users indicate that the platform is reliable and trustworthy. By considering these factors, you can find a platform that aligns with your investment goals and provides a secure environment for trading eth. Consider the level of decentralization offered by each platform, as this can impact the security and reliability of the staking process, especially when using eth.\n\nSecurely Delegating Your ETH Tokens\n\nOnce you\u2019ve chosen a reputable staking platform, it\u2019s time to delegate your ETH tokens to a validator. Validators are responsible for securing the network and validating transactions on the Ethereum blockchain. By delegating your tokens to an eth validator, you contribute to the network\u2019s security while earning eth rewards in return.\n\nBefore delegating your ETH tokens, ensure that you thoroughly research and select trustworthy validators on the chosen staking platform. Look for validators with high uptime percentages and low commission rates to maximize your yield potential with eth.\n\nWhen delegating your tokens, it is important to follow best practices for securely storing them, especially when dealing with eth. Keep your ETH in cold storage or hardware wallets rather than leaving them on exchanges or online wallets to reduce the risk of unauthorized access or loss of funds.\n\nMaximizing Yield Generation\n\nTo optimize your yield generation through Ethereum staking, it\u2019s essential to stay informed about the latest developments and best practices in the crypto space. Keep an eye on market trends, network upgrades, and changes in staking protocols that may impact your rewards, especially in the eth market.\n\nConsider diversifying your staked assets by allocating them to multiple validators in the eth network. This helps mitigate risks associated with a single ETH validator\u2019s performance or potential slashing events. By spreading your ETH tokens across different validators, you can increase the likelihood of earning consistent yields over time.\n\nRegularly monitor your staking rewards in eth and adjust your strategy accordingly. Some staking platforms offer options for re-delegating rewards automatically or compounding them to maximize long-term gains with eth. Stay proactive in managing your staked ETH assets to ensure optimal yield generation.\n\nExploring Pooled vs. Solo Ethereum Staking\n\nDifferences between pooled and solo staking options\n\nPooled (delegated) and solo (non-delegated) staking are two options available for ETH holders looking to stake their tokens. Pooled staking involves joining a group of validators, while solo staking allows individuals to validate transactions on the Ethereum network independently.\n\nBenefits of joining a pool\n\nJoining a pool can offer several advantages for those interested in Ethereum staking. One benefit is the lower entry barrier. By pooling their funds with other participants, users can contribute a smaller amount of ETH compared to the minimum requirement for solo staking. This makes it more accessible for individuals who may not have large amounts of ETH but still want to participate in staking.\n\nAnother advantage of pooled staking is shared rewards. When validators in an ETH pool successfully validate ETH transactions, the rewards are distributed among all participants based on their contribution. This means that even if an individual\u2019s validator does not produce a block, they can still earn rewards through the collective efforts of the eth pool.\n\nPooled staking contributes to increased decentralization of the network. As more participants join ETH pools, it helps distribute power and decision-making across multiple validators rather than concentrated in the hands of a few large ETH stakeholders. This aligns with one of Ethereum\u2019s core principles: creating a decentralized and secure blockchain network.\n\nConsiderations for solo staking\n\nWhile pooled staking offers benefits, some individuals may prefer solo staking for greater control over their assets and potentially higher rewards. This is especially true for those who hold eth and want to maximize their earnings. Solo stakers have complete autonomy over their eth validator node without relying on any external entities or sharing rewards with others.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s essential to note that solo stakers also face additional technical requirements compared to those who join eth pools. They need to set up and maintain their own validator infrastructure, including hardware, software configuration, security measures, and continuous monitoring.\n\nSolo staking also requires a higher minimum stake than pooled staking, which may limit participation for those with smaller amounts of ETH. Moreover, solo stakers bear the full responsibility of maintaining their validator\u2019s uptime and ensuring it performs optimally to maximize rewards.\n\nMaking an informed decision\n\nWhen deciding between pooled and solo staking, it\u2019s crucial to consider personal preferences and circumstances. Pooled staking offers convenience, lower entry barriers, shared rewards, and contributes to network decentralization. On the other hand, solo staking provides greater control over assets but requires additional technical expertise and a higher minimum stake.\n\nUltimately, the choice depends on factors such as the amount of ETH available for staking, technical proficiency, risk tolerance, and desired level of involvement in the Ethereum network.\n\nThe Impact of the Merge on Ethereum Staking\n\nEthereum 2.0 Upgrade and Implications for Stakers\n\nThe upcoming Ethereum 2.0 upgrade, also known as the merge, is set to bring significant changes to the Ethereum network and its staking ecosystem. This transition involves a shift from the current proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism to a more energy-efficient proof-of-stake (PoS) model. As an Ethereum staker, it\u2019s crucial to understand how this upgrade will impact your staking rewards and the overall security of the network.\n\nChanges in Staking Rewards and Network Security\n\nWith the merge, one of the most notable changes for stakers is likely to be in their yields or returns on their staked Ether. Currently, under PoW, miners are rewarded with newly minted Ether for validating transactions and securing the network. However, once Ethereum transitions to PoS, miners will no longer exist, and instead, validators will play a crucial role.\n\nValidators will need to lock up their Ether as collateral in order to participate in block validation. In return for their participation and maintaining network security, they will receive rewards in the form of additional Ether. These rewards are expected to be significantly lower compared to mining rewards but can still provide attractive returns depending on various factors such as total amount staked and network participation.\n\nTimeline and Potential Changes During Transition\n\nWhile there isn\u2019t an exact timeline for when the merge will occur, it\u2019s important for stakers to stay informed about potential changes that may arise during this transition period. As development progresses and upgrades are implemented, there may be adjustments made to optimize performance or address any unforeseen challenges.\n\nStaying updated with news from official sources like Ethereum Foundation announcements or participating in online communities dedicated to Ethereum can help you navigate through any potential changes smoothly. By staying informed about these developments, you can make necessary adjustments or take advantage of new opportunities that may arise.\n\nEnsuring Network Security and Participation\n\nAs Ethereum moves towards a PoS consensus mechanism, network security becomes paramount. Validators play a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of the network by proposing and validating blocks. To ensure the network\u2019s security, it is essential for a sufficient number of validators to participate actively.\n\nAs an Ethereum staker, you can contribute to the network\u2019s security by becoming a validator yourself or delegating your stake to trusted validators. By actively participating in block validation, you not only help secure the network but also earn rewards for your contribution.\n\nSelecting the Best Platforms for Ethereum Staking\n\nChoosing the right platform is crucial.

During this time, you won\u2019t be able to freely transfer or use your staked Ether. However, once the lock-up period ends, you regain full control over your Ether and can choose whether to continue staking or withdraw it.\n\nHow Much Can I Earn By Staking Ethereum?\n\nWhen you stake your Ether, it is not locked. Instead, it is used as collateral to participate in the Ethereum network\u2019s proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. By staking your Ether, you contribute to the security and operation of the network, and in return, you can earn rewards.\n\nThe amount you can earn by staking Ethereum varies and depends on several factors. These factors include the total amount of Ether being staked, the length of time you have been staking, and the overall network participation rate. Generally, the more Ether you stake and the longer you stake it, the higher your potential earnings.\n\nIt is important to note that while staking Ethereum can be a lucrative opportunity, it also carries some risks. For example, if you fail to meet the network\u2019s requirements or engage in malicious behavior, you may face penalties or lose a portion of your staked Ether. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the staking process and the associated risks before participating.\n\nOverall, staking Ethereum allows you to actively participate in the network while earning rewards for your contribution. It is a way to put your Ether to work and potentially generate additional income. However, it is essential to weigh the risks and rewards before deciding to stake your Ether."

        "title": "What Is Block Time? What It Measures, Verification, and Example - Investopedia",
        "content": "What Is Block Time?\n\nBlock time measures the time it takes the miners or validators within a network to verify transactions within one block and produce a new block in that blockchain.\n\nBlockchains were first popularized by Bitcoin when it was introduced in 2009. The technology has grown as more cryptocurrencies are created, each of which can use a different or identical blockchain, validation methods, and techniques for creating new blocks.\n\nKey Takeaways Block time is the time it takes to process a block in a cryptocurrency blockchain.\n\nOn the Bitcoin blockchain, a block is verified by miners, who compete against each other to verify the transactions and solve the hash, which creates another block.\n\nOn the Ethereum blockchain, a block is validated by randomly selected nodes, which is must faster because there is no competition.\n\nOther chains might use different mechanisms, which would affect their block times.\n\nUnderstanding Block Time\n\nA blockchain is a distributed database that records all transactions within a cryptocurrency network. You can think of a block within the database as a cell in a spreadsheet where transaction information is stored. Bitcoin miners verify the transactions, which takes time because finding the solution to the encryption problem requires the computers to make a vast number of trial-and-error attempts.\n\nOn the Bitcoin blockchain, this is called hashing\u2014generating random hexadecimal numbers to try and find one that is less than or equal to one set by the network. When the block solution is found or otherwise validated, a new block is opened. The amount of time it takes to find the solution and create a new block is the block time.\n\n\n\nHere are a few key points to remember if you're trying to understand block time:\n\nA block is a record of the most recent cryptocurrency transactions, similar to a cell in a table of columns and rows.\n\nEach block contains the information from the block that preceded it in hashed form (that's why it is theoretically impossible to alter cryptocurrency).\n\nOn the Bitcoin blockchain, cryptocurrency \"miners\" race against each other to generate a random hash plus the nonce that is less than or equal to the target hash. The winner receives a reward.\n\nEthereum validators use a different consensus mechanism, which makes the block times shorter.\n\nBlockchains that use other mechanisms may have shorter or longer block times.\n\nWhy Block Times Differ\n\nConsensus mechanisms are what allow a network of participants to agree that a transaction is valid. Cryptocurrencies can use different consensus mechanisms, which, among other factors, affect the time it takes to verify transactions and create new blocks.\n\nProof-of-work and proof-of-stake are two types of consensus mechanisms that use different transaction verification methods. Each blockchain has a different block time because of the way their mechanisms work\u2014Bitcoin averages about 10 minutes, while Ethereum only takes around 12 seconds.\n\nThe exact amount of time it takes for block generation on the Bitcoin proof-of-work blockchain is governed by the difficulty level, which changes with network traffic and the number of miners on the network to keep block times at 10 minutes.\n\nEthereum uses proof-of-stake, which is much faster because there is no competition for a reward\u2014participants with staked ether are randomly selected to validate the transactions and receive network fees.\n\nBlock Time vs. Confirmation Time\n\nSometimes confused with each other, block times and confirmation times are two different measurements on a blockchain. Confirmation time is the amount of time it takes a blockchain to confirm a transaction.\n\nIt's often thought that a transaction needs six confirmations before it goes through; however, this is a misunderstanding. When a transaction makes it into a block, and the block is closed, the transaction has one confirmation and concludes. The number six comes from the belief that a transaction that was confirmed six times (included in six closed blocks) is secure from any network attacks.\n\nA block may be opened every 10 minutes on the Bitcoin blockchain, but not all transactions that occur within that period can be sent to the current block to be mined and confirmed. Confirmation can take up to several hours on the Bitcoin blockchain because transactions are sent to a mempool, where they are queued in order of the amount of fees paid.\n\nUsers who want their transactions placed in front of others pay more than the average, while those who pay average or below-average fees must wait their turn to be sent to a block, verified, and confirmed at least once.\n\n\n\nHow Many Bitcoins Will Ever Be Created? Bitcoin has a limit of 21 million. There are over 19 million Bitcoins in circulation, and the number of Bitcoins created yearly halves every four years. This slows down Bitcoin creation over time.\n\nHow Many Ethereum Will Ever Be Created? Ethereum, unlike Bitcoin, doesn't have an upper limit on the number of coins that will be created.\n\nHow Do I Get a Bitcoin Block? You never actually receive a Bitcoin block since it is part of Bitcoin's framework. Instead, you receive a reward of bitcoin when your miner solves the hash and creates another block.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nBlocks are one of the structures used in a blockchain that store information. The time it takes to open a new block on a chain is that chain's block time. Block times differ from confirmation times, which can take several hours or days to complete.\n\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes online.

        "content": "The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) opened a forum for the public to comment on a proposed rule change that could allow asset management firm Fidelity to offer shares of its spot Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nWhat Happened: In an official notice, SEC said that \u201cInterested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing, including whether the proposed rule change is consistent with the Act.\u201d\n\nA timeline of 21 days is provided to comment on the proposed change under which Cboe BZX Exchange will be allowed to list and trade shares of its Fidelity Ethereum fund.\n\nFidelity had first filed for approval of the fund on Nov.17, 2023, in hopes of the SEC approving a spot Bitcoin ETF. On approval, the Fidelity Ethereum Fund would be listed on the Cboe BZX Exchange.\n\nWhy It Matters: The filing added, \u201cMeanwhile, investors in other countries, including Germany, Switzerland, and France, are able to use more traditional exchange-listed and traded products (including exchange-traded funds holding physical ETH) to gain exposure to ETH.\n\n\"Investors across Europe have access to products that trade on regulated exchanges and provide exposure to a broad array of spot crypto assets. U.S. investors, by contrast, are left with fewer and more risky means of getting ether exposure.\u201d\n\nAnalyst James Seyffart took to X and stated that with this filing, a 240-day clock (review period) has commenced for a decision on Fidelity\u2019s spot Ethereum ETF. Definitive deadlines are likely to come in the upcoming weeks.\n\nShares tied to Bitcoin Futures ETF were first listed and traded by exchanges in October 2021 and nine Ethereum futures ETFs were launched in October 2023.\n\nRead Next: Bitcoin Edges Up, Dogecoin And Ethereum Diverge As BTC ETF Landscape Expands: Analysts Sees Apex Crypto Breaking $38K\n\nPhoto: Shutterstock"

Before joining Optimism, Wyatt was the president of Polygon Labs, the entity building the layer-2 blockchain Polygon.\n\nAs it stands, using and transacting with Ethereum is still relatively clunky, slow and more expensive. That\u2019s why layer-2 (L2) blockchains like Optimism exist: to focus on scaling and speed, while also lowering costs for users. It helps users interact with Ethereum\u2019s chain for about 10x cheaper through its own network and also provides developers the ability to build decentralized applications (dApps) in a faster, scalable way.\n\n\u201cJust as Amazon is a serverless back end for web2 applications, Optimism is a decentralized serverless back end for web3 applications,\u201d Wang said. \u201cWe wanted to scale Ethereum because I think Ethereum stays the most close to the original decentralization values and we wanted to give it a go staying close to those same values.\u201d"

        "content": "The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) began to accept comments on Fidelity\u2019s proposed spot Ethereum ETF through a Nov. 30 filing.\n\nThat filing indicates that the securities agency is now soliciting comments on a proposed rule change from Cboe BZX. If approved, that rule change will allow the exchange to list and trade Fidelity\u2019s Ethereum Fund shares.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s request for comments resembles similar filings regarding other spot crypto ETF proposals. It asks for comments about surveillance, custodianship, and market manipulation, among other matters. Notably, the filing highlights a surveillance sharing agreement that Coinbase and Cboe BZX established in June, a critical component also found in many other pending spot crypto ETF proposals.\n\nThe filing also acknowledges a lack of existing U.S.-regulated and U.S. exchange-traded investments that provide exposure to ETH, whereas European markets already offer regulated investments that provide exposure to spot crypto assets.\n\nDecision likely by March 2024\n\nThe filing sets a timeline for the SEC to approve, disapprove, or start proceedings to determine whether to disapprove the proposed rule change. These comments are considered in the final decision-making process. The SEC is required to reach a decision within 45 days of the current notice\u2019s publication in the federal register; however, the SEC can extend the decision period by up to 90 days and then further by 60 days if necessary.\n\nThough exact deadlines may differ, Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart estimated that the SEC\u2019s next decision deadline for Fidelity will be Jan. 21, 2024, and its final decision will be March 8, 2024. He added that he will have knowledge of \u201cdefinitive deadlines in the coming weeks.\u201d\n\nFidelity initially filed for its spot Ethereum ETF on Nov. 17, days after its competitor BlackRock filed for an equivalent fund on Nov. 15. Both firms also filed for spot Bitcoin ETFs this summer starting in mid-June.\n\nSeveral other asset managers, including Ark Invest, VanEck, and Grayscale, also have pending spot crypto ETF proposals."

        "content": "The Ethereum network has seen a surge in daily validator exit since the beginning of October.\n\nThis may be due to the recent uptick in Ether\u2019s value.\n\nEthereum\u2019s [ETH] staking pool has experienced a shift since the beginning of October, with an increasing number of validators opting to withdraw their staked ETH, Glassnode found in a new report.\n\nAccording to the on-chain data provider, since the beginning of October, an average count of 1018 validators have exited the proof-of-stake (PoS) network daily.\n\nThis trend coincides with the recent upswing in the altcoin\u2019s price in the last month, suggesting that validators are capitalizing on the opportunity to capture gains on their previously staked ETH.\n\nValidator exit has network-wide impacts\n\nTo serve as a validator on the Ethereum network, a minimum amount of 32 ETH is to be staked. Since the October rally began, there has been a steady decline in the number of unique addresses holding this amount of ETH.\n\nAt press time, 125,189 addresses held at least 32 ETH, having declined by 1% since the 1st of October.\n\nGlassnode found further that most exits recorded in the last eight weeks have been voluntary. Validators are deemed to have exited the network voluntarily when they independently decide to exit the ETH 2.0 staking pool.\n\nThis differs from slashing events that account for validators being removed from the network for violating protocol rules. In the last two weeks, only two of such events were recorded, Glassnode said.\n\nIn addition, due to a rise in the daily number of exiting validators on the network, there has been a corresponding fall in ETH issuance. This refers to the total amount of new ETH coins added to its current supply.\n\nAccording to the report:\n\n\u201cAs the growth rate of validators slows and declines, the daily ETH issuance has experienced a corresponding slowdown. Over the last 7-days, the growth rate of ETH issuance has slowed by up to 0.5% per day. Notably, the rate of issuance has decreased for the first time in recent days.\u201d\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ETHs worth today?\n\nRegarding the entity types that have facilitated the most withdrawals since the beginning of October, Glassnode found that centralized exchanges have been responsible."

These ETFs recorded a total trading volume of around $1.7 million in their initial hours, a sharp contrast to the successful launch of the first futures-based Bitcoin ETFs."

Forbes will launch all categories of the Under 30 list on the blockchain, along with individual profiles of all mentioned persons. The Under 30 list is a set of lists published annually, recognizing notable people across several industries, all under 30 years old. Some categories include Media, Games, Sports, Technology, Finance, Healthcare, Education, Venture Capital, Art & Style, Music, Hollywood & Entertainment, and Social Enterprise.\n\nSpeaking on the development, Forbes Chief Digital and Information Officer Vadim Supitskiy said:\n\n\u201cForbes is at the forefront of marrying traditional media with cutting-edge technology. By launching the Under 30 list on the Ethereum blockchain, we\u2019re not just recognizing the influential young leaders; we\u2019re also demonstrating the vast, untapped potential of blockchain technology in the realm of data storage and security.\u201d\n\nThe 2024 finance list for North America includes several representatives from the crypto industry. Featured persons include Injective Labs cofounders Eric Chen and Albert Chon, Fractal cofounder Aya Kantorovich, and Blockchain Capital general partner Aleks Larsen. Others are Layer3 cofounders Dariya Khojasteh and Brandon Kumar, Bitcoin Depot founder Brandon Mintz, and Sei Labs cofounders Jeff Feng and Jayendra Jog.\n\nForbes Has More than One List Highlighting Crypto and Blockchain Leaders\n\nThe 2022 list had 21 Bitcoin and blockchain leaders, among several notable people from other industries. Some of the featured persons include Alameda Research co-CEOs Caroline Ellison and Sam Trabucco, OpenSea cofounder Alex Atallah, and dYdX founder Antonio Juliano. Others were Slingshot founder Clinton Bembry, 21Shares cofounder Ophelia Snyder, CoinList founder Brian Tubergen, Blockworks cofounders Michael Ippolito and Jason Yanowitz, and pplpleasr cofounder Emily Yang.\n\nLast April, Forbes published a list of the richest crypto and blockchain billionaires in the world. The list featured former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao, FTX founder and former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, Coinbase founder and CEO Brian Armstrong, and Ripple executive chairman and cofounder Chris Larsen, among others.\n\nForbes has previously tried to go public, announcing its intention in 2021. At the time, Forbes Global Media Holdings Inc revealed a decision to publicly list via a merger with Magnum Opus Acquisition, a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC). Forbes planned to raise $600 million, including $200 million in cash from Magnum Opus. Notably, the other $400 million was to come from the private placement of company shares.\n\nHowever, Forbes abandoned plans for an IPO last June. The company reportedly pulled the plug because investor appetite and general enthusiasm for blank-cheque vehicles were not satisfactory. Interest in IPOs launched via SPACs waned for several reasons. A major problem was the increased scrutiny from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)."

By signing a contract, developers can ensure that their work is protected and that they are compensated fairly for their efforts.\n\nFundamental Concepts in Solidity\n\nVariables, Data Types, and Control Structures\n\nVariables, data types, control structures, values, and functions are foundational elements of programming in Solidity. In Solidity, variables are used to store and manipulate data values. These variables can be declared within a contract, which is a stateful entity that contains functions for interacting with the data. In code, variables are declared with specific data types such as integers, strings, or booleans. For example, you can declare a variable to store bytes. These variables can then be assigned values and used throughout the program in the context of a course. For example, code functions can utilize these variables.\n\nControl structures in Solidity programs allow developers to control the flow of execution using code, functions, and contracts. These control structures help manage the state of the program. Conditional statements like if-else statements are a common example of functions in code. They help make decisions based on certain types of conditions. For example, loops such as for loops or while loops use variables and functions to enable repetitive execution of a block of code until a specified condition is met.\n\nFunctions: Executing Actions within Smart Contracts\n\nFunctions are essential in executing actions within smart contracts written in Solidity code. They help manage the state of the contract by manipulating variables. For example, a function can update the value of a variable in a smart contract. Code functions are examples of types of code that encapsulate a set of instructions. These instructions define how specific tasks or operations should be performed. Functions can use parameters to receive inputs in the form of variables, for example, data, when they are called.\n\nSolidity functions in a contract can also return variable data, providing outputs after executing the code logic. This allows for the use of data functions to retrieve computed results or information values from the smart contract.\n\nEvents, Modifiers, and Inheritance: Efficiency and Reusability\n\nUnderstanding events, modifiers, inheritance, functions, constructor, and contract helps developers write efficient and reusable code in Solidity.\n\nEvents are functions in smart contracts that emit signals when certain conditions occur, allowing them to communicate with external entities. This communication is done through the emission of data types in the code. They serve as a means for logging important data that can be observed by external applications or other smart contracts on the Ethereum network. These functions are written in code and can handle different types of information.\n\nModifiers in code enable developers to incorporate additional checks or conditions before executing specific functions within their smart contracts. These modifiers are particularly useful for ensuring the proper handling of different data types and constructor functions. By applying modifiers to code functions, developers can ensure that only authorized users or specific conditions in the data are met before allowing access to particular functionality. This can be achieved by using the constructor function and implementing a contract.\n\nInheritance enables code reuse by allowing one contract (the child contract) to inherit properties and functionalities from another contract (the parent contract). This is done through the use of constructors, functions, and types, which allow the child contract to access and utilize the data and functionality of the parent contract. This promotes modularity and reduces redundancy in code by using functions and constructors, making it easier to maintain and upgrade smart contracts. The functions handle the data and the constructors initialize the value.\n\nBy understanding the functions, data, and constructor in Solidity code, developers can efficiently build robust smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. With variables, functions, data types, constructor, and control structures, they have the tools to store, manipulate, and assign value to data effectively in code. Functions empower them to execute code actions within their smart contracts while events, modifiers, and inheritance enhance efficiency and reusability of data and type.\n\nDiving into Solidity\u2019s Data Structures\n\nArrays: Storing and Manipulating Data Collections\n\nArrays in Solidity provide a convenient way to store and manipulate collections of data within Smart Contracts. They are used to define functions and constructor code that handle and return values. Arrays are useful data structures in programming that can store a variety of values, such as addresses, integers, or custom data types. They are commonly used in code to create functions and define the value of variables within a contract. For example, you can create an array to store a list of names or a collection of transaction details in your code. This data can be organized and accessed using functions. Additionally, you can use contracts to define the behavior and requirements for working with this data.\n\nTo declare an array in a Solidity contract, you specify the data type followed by square brackets [] in the code constructor functions. You can also define the size and value of the data array if you want it to have a fixed length. This can be done using code and functions. However, if you don\u2019t know the exact size of the code, data, or type beforehand or want it to be dynamic, you can omit the size declaration and use a dynamic value.\n\nArrays in Solidity are zero-indexed, meaning the first element in the data constructor is at index 0 in the code contract. You can access individual elements using their respective indices. Arrays are a fundamental data structure in programming. They support various operations such as appending new elements, updating existing values, and iterating over all elements. These operations can be achieved using functions and code. Additionally, arrays can be manipulated using constructors to create new instances or modify existing ones.\n\nStructs: Custom Data Structures with Multiple Properties\n\nIn Solidity, structs are used in the contract code to define custom data structures with multiple properties. Developers can use the constructor function to initialize these structs. They are similar to classes or objects in other programming languages, but with the addition of code, constructor, data, and type. By using a constructor function, you can organize related data variables together and assign them a specific name in your code.\n\nFor instance, let\u2019s say you want to represent a person\u2019s data in your Smart Contract. You can do this by using code that includes a constructor to assign a value to the person\u2019s information. You can define a struct called \u201cPerson\u201d with properties like name (string), age (uint), and address (address) in a contract. The struct can be created using a constructor function to initialize the data. This way, you have a structured way of storing and accessing person-related data within your contract using the constructor function to define the value and type.\n\nStructs enable code reusability as well. Once the constructor is defined, you can create multiple instances of that struct throughout your contract or even across different contracts. This allows you to work with different sets of data and values using the function.\n\nMaps: Efficient Storage and Retrieval of Key-Value Pairs\n\nMaps are a type of data structure in Solidity that serve as a function for efficient storage and retrieval of key-value pairs within Smart Contracts. They are constructed using a constructor and are essential for managing data in Solidity. They are similar to dictionaries or hash maps, which are data structures used in other programming languages. With maps, you can associate data with a specific key and quickly retrieve that data based on the given key. Maps are a function-like constructor that allows you to store and access data based on a key-value contract.\n\nTo declare a map in Solidity, you specify the data type for both the key and value in the contract\u2019s constructor function. For example, you can create a data map where the keys are addresses and the values are integers representing token balances using a function. Additionally, you can define a contract with a constructor to initialize the map.\n\nMaps are a data type that offer fast lookups, making them ideal for scenarios where you need to access values based on specific keys. They function as a contract between keys and values, efficiently organizing and retrieving data.\n\nMastering Smart Contract Development in Solidity\n\nWriting Secure Smart Contracts\n\nWriting secure smart contracts involves implementing proper error handling mechanisms in the function and constructor to ensure the safety of data and type. By incorporating error handling, developers can anticipate and handle potential issues that may arise during the execution of a smart contract constructor function. This ensures that the data and types are properly handled, enhancing the overall functionality and reliability of the smart contract. This function ensures that the constructor operates smoothly by reducing the risk of vulnerabilities or exploits in the data value.\n\nOne approach to implementing error handling in Solidity is through the use of exception handling. This can be achieved by adding a constructor function to the contract that handles any errors that may occur during the execution of the contract\u2019s functions and data operations. With exception handling, developers can define specific conditions under which an exception should be thrown in a function or constructor, allowing for graceful error recovery or termination of contract execution for various data types. By carefully considering potential errors and implementing appropriate exception handling, developers can enhance the security and reliability of their smart contracts. This can be achieved by analyzing and validating the data, using constructors to initialize objects, defining functions to perform specific tasks, and specifying the type of variables to ensure proper data handling.\n\nImplementing Access Control Mechanisms\n\nImplementing access control mechanisms is crucial to ensure that only authorized users can interact with smart contracts. One way to achieve this is by using a constructor function that validates the data provided by users. Access control helps prevent unauthorized individuals from modifying or accessing sensitive data within a contract using the constructor function.\n\nOne common method for access control in Solidity is using modifiers in the contract. Modifiers are functions that can be applied to other functions in order to modify their behavior. They are typically defined in the constructor of the contract and can be used to restrict access to certain data or functions within the contract. Constructors in contracts allow developers to specify conditions that must be met before executing a certain function within the data. Modifiers are used to define these conditions. By applying modifiers to constructor functions, developers can restrict access to data based on user roles or permissions defined in the contract.\n\nAnother approach to managing access control within a contract is by utilizing role-based access control (RBAC). RBAC defines different roles within the contract and assigns them specific permissions. This can be achieved through the use of data, constructors, and functions. This function allows for fine-grained control over who can perform certain actions within the data constructor.\n\nBy implementing robust access control mechanisms, developers can safeguard their smart contracts against unauthorized data access or misuse. The use of constructors and functions can further enhance the security of these contracts.\n\nInteracting with External Contracts\n\nInteracting with external contracts through function calls enables complex interactions between different parts of the Ethereum ecosystem, allowing for the exchange of data and constructor initialization. This capability allows smart contracts to communicate with other contracts on the Ethereum blockchain, facilitating interoperability and enabling more sophisticated functionalities by exchanging data and utilizing the constructor.\n\nDevelopers can utilize the constructor to interact with existing ERC20 tokens or invoke data functions from other deployed contracts. This opens up possibilities for integrating various data decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols into their own smart contracts or leveraging functionalities provided by other constructor contracts.\n\nBy leveraging the power of external contract interactions, developers can enhance the capabilities and utility of their smart contracts by incorporating additional functions and data. This enables them to build more robust and interconnected applications on the Ethereum blockchain using the constructor.\n\nAdvanced Solidity Features and Best Practices\n\nUsing Libraries for Code Reusability\n\nLibraries are a powerful feature in Solidity that allow developers to reuse code across multiple projects, reducing redundancy and improving efficiency. They can be used to define and implement reusable functions and contracts, which can be accessed and utilized by other contracts. This helps in organizing and managing the data and logic within a smart contract. Additionally, libraries can be instantiated through constructors, allowing for customization and flexibility in their usage. By creating a library contract with a constructor, developers can define functions and data structures that can be used by other contracts. This promotes code modularity and makes it easier to maintain and update smart contracts by using the function, constructor, and data.\n\nGas Optimization Techniques for Cost Efficiency\n\nGas optimization is crucial. Gas refers to the cost associated with performing computational tasks on the blockchain data. In a smart contract, a function or constructor may require gas to execute. By utilizing gas optimization techniques, developers can minimize transaction costs and improve the overall efficiency of their smart contracts. These techniques involve optimizing the data, function, and constructor of the contracts.\n\nOne technique to optimize the contract is to avoid unnecessary computations or storage operations within the data function or constructor. For example, when writing a contract function or constructor, using uint8 instead of uint256 when possible can save gas as it requires less storage space for data. Using modifiers in a contract\u2019s function or constructor can reduce gas consumption by avoiding the repetition of code blocks and optimizing data handling.\n\nAnother technique is to use mappings instead of arrays when dealing with large datasets in the context of a function, contract, or constructor. Mappings are a data structure in Solidity that offer constant-time lookup, insertion, and deletion operations. This is unlike arrays, which require iterating through all elements, resulting in higher gas costs. Mappings are commonly used in smart contracts to efficiently store and retrieve data. When defining a mapping, a constructor function is often used to set initial values.\n\nFollowing Best Practices for Code Quality\n\nTo ensure code quality and maintainability, it is essential to follow best practices when developing smart contracts in Solidity. One of these practices is to define a constructor function that initializes the data of the contract. This constructor function is called automatically when the contract is deployed on the blockchain. By properly defining and using the constructor function, developers can ensure that the contract is initialized correctly and ready to perform its intended functions. One such practice is thorough code commenting. By providing clear comments throughout the codebase, developers ensure that the constructor, data, and contract are easily comprehensible to themselves and others. This improves understanding of the functionality and purpose of each section of code.\n\nTesting is another crucial aspect of solid contract development. Writing comprehensive unit tests helps identify bugs or vulnerabilities early on in the development process. These tests ensure that the function, constructor, and data in the code are working correctly and adhering to the contract. Tools like Truffle provide frameworks for writing automated tests that simulate various scenarios and edge cases for contract functions, constructors, and data.\n\nDocumentation also plays a vital role in maintaining well-structured and understandable codebases, especially when it comes to data, function, constructor, and contract. Documenting functions, variables, events, contract interactions, constructor, and data helps other developers easily navigate through the project.\n\nBy adhering to these best practices, developers can enhance the quality of their code by implementing data contracts and constructors, reducing the likelihood of bugs or vulnerabilities, and making it easier for others to collaborate on and understand their projects through well-documented functions.\n\nLearning Resources for Solidity Development\n\nTutorials, Online Courses, and Documentation\n\nTo learn Solidity, there are valuable resources provided by the Ethereum Foundation, including information on contract data, functions, and constructors.

Happy coding!\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nHow can I learn Solidity?\n\nLearning Solidity can be achieved through various methods. You can start by exploring online tutorials, documentation, and interactive coding platforms like Remix or Truffle to learn about contract constructors. Joining developer communities, attending workshops or webinars, and building practical projects will enhance your understanding of Solidity, a programming language used for creating smart contracts.\n\nAre there any prerequisites for learning Solidity?\n\nWhile prior programming knowledge is beneficial, it\u2019s not mandatory to have extensive experience before diving into Solidity, a programming language used for writing smart contracts. However, having a basic understanding of concepts like variables, functions, control structures, constructors, and contracts will expedite your learning process.\n\nWhich resources are recommended for learning Solidity?\n\nTo grasp the fundamentals of Solidity effectively, consider utilizing resources such as the official Ethereum documentation (solidity.readthedocs.io), online courses like Udemy\u2019s \u201cBlockchain A-Z: Learn How To Build Your First Blockchain,\u201d and books like \u201cMastering Ethereum\u201d by Andreas M. Antonopoulos. These resources will help you understand the contract and constructor aspects of Solidity.\n\nCan I practice software development and work on smart contract code in Solidity without deploying on the mainnet during the ethereum developer bootcamp?\n\nAbsolutely! You can utilize Ethereum test networks such as Ropsten or Rinkeby to deploy your smart contracts without using real Ether. Additionally, when writing your smart contract, make sure to include a constructor function to initialize the contract\u2019s state variables. This allows you to experiment with different functionalities and ensure that your code functions correctly before deploying the contract on the mainnet. By using the constructor, you can test and validate the functionality of your contract before deploying it on the mainnet.\n\nWhat are some common mistakes students, who are beginners in learning Solidity as an ethereum developer, make when writing smart contract code?\n\nBeginners often overlook the importance of thoroughly testing their smart contracts or fail to implement proper security measures, including the constructor. It\u2019s crucial to conduct comprehensive unit testing and perform audits to identify vulnerabilities in your code, especially when working with contracts and constructors. Staying updated with best practices and seeking feedback from experienced developers will help avoid common pitfalls."

        "content": "A wallet allegedly belonging to Three Arrows Capital (3AC) co-founder Su Zhu has moved funds for the first time since his arrest months ago.\n\nEtherscan records displayed several incoming and outgoing ERC-20 token transactions to and from an address labeled suzhu.eth on Nov. 29.\n\nOne outgoing transaction involved 3.75 million Gearbox (GEAR) tokens worth under $30,000. Suzhu.eth moved those funds into a decentralized exchange called CoW Protocol just minutes after it received those same tokens.\n\nIn another outgoing transaction, suzhu.eth moved 1 billion of an ERC-20 token named SUZHU into Uniswap V2. Though the SUZHU token has zero value based on Etherscan data, Uniswap data reported $6,274 in volume for the ETH-SUZHU pair over the 24-hour period ending at 11:00 PM UTC on Nov. 29.\n\nSeveral other incoming transactions also originated largely but not entirely from Uniswap. Unlike the outgoing transactions, those incoming transactions would not have required authorized access to Su Zhu\u2019s wallet.\n\nNo other outgoing funds since arrest\n\nUntil now, the most recent outgoing transactions involving Su Zhu\u2019s wallet took place on or before Sept. 21, days prior to his arrest on Sept. 29 in Singapore.\n\nAt that time, Su Zhu was sentenced to four months in prison. It does not appear that Su Zhu has been convicted of any crime. Instead, Three Arrows Capital\u2019s liquidator, Teneo, reportedly obtained a committal order after Su Zhu failed to cooperate, allowing police to arrest and imprison the executive.\n\nUncertainty around Su Zhu\u2019s current situation means that it is unclear whether the transactions are suspicious. It is possible that Su Zhu is no longer in prison, has internet access in prison, has permitted another individual to access his wallet, or has surrendered control of the wallet following his arrest. He may also have arranged for DeFi platforms to automatically access his wallet.\n\nThough it does not seem that Su Zhu has admitted to owning the wallet, data from Arkham Intelligence indicates that the wallet belongs to Su Zhu."

        "content": "Thu 30 Nov 2023 \u25aa 4 min of reading \u25aa by Fitah\n\nA major transformation is shaking up Ethereum: validators are leaving the ship, slowing the issuance of new tokens. Coupled with a rise in network activity, this is making the global supply of the cryptocurrency ETH deflationary. Let\u2019s decrypt it!\n\n\u201cExodus\u201d of Validators on Ethereum\n\nWhile the price of Ethereum cryptocurrency is stalled around $2000, a significant change is taking place on the network. Indeed, the supply of ETH is undergoing a major shift, becoming deflationary once again.\n\nGlassnode\n\nThis deflation results from two key factors. First, there is the slowdown in the number of validators in the staking pools. Then, there is the increase in daily Ethereum cryptocurrency fees burned via EIP1559, fueled by an intensification of network activity\n\nThe growing number of validators leaving the pool since October indeed slows down the growth of the network. This leads to a decrease in the issuance of new ETH crypto tokens. According to Glassnode\u2019s analysis, the number of participant exits has seen a notable increase. This has gone from an average of 309 per day in October to an impressive average of 1018 validators per day since early November. This trend aligns with the recent rise in crypto prices.\n\nGlassnode\n\nThe massive exits of participants, mostly voluntary, are particularly concentrated among the CEXs such as Kraken and Coinbase. A modest increase in exits at the liquid staking provider, Lido, is also highlighted.\n\nIncreased Activity and Pressure on ETH\n\nAccording to Glassnode\u2019s analysis, the network is also experiencing a significant increase in transaction demand, particularly for token transfers and stablecoins. This increased pressure on the network leads to a rise in gas fees, generating a notable growth in Ethereum fees burned via EIP 1559.\n\nGlassnode\n\nIn October, the daily amount of Ethereum burned reached 899 ETH, a figure that has climbed to 5,368 ETH in less than a month. These figures reflect a spike in activity, pushing Ethereum to new heights of demand and transactions.\n\nThis double pressure translates into a critical situation: ETH is once again becoming a deflationary resource. The reduction in the number of validators leads to a slowdown in the issuance of ETH. While the explosion in network activity exerts upward pressure on gas fees.\n\nThe combined effect of these two factors shows that Ethereum is responding to market changes. This creates a situation where the supply of ETH is once again shrinking, moving towards deflation.\n\nHow will this new dynamic influence the choices of investors in the weeks to come?\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program!

        "content": "Wed 29 Nov 2023 \u25aa 3 min of reading \u25aa by Fitah\n\nThe Internet Computer (ICP) team has just unveiled its integration plan with Ethereum. This announcement opens the door to a groundbreaking collaboration between two blockchain giants. This news has the potential to transform the crypto ecosystem and could well be the catalyst for a surge in ICP\u2019s price.\n\nICP and Ethereum join forces\n\nThe integration of Ethereum on Internet Computer will take place in two phases. In the first phase, a canister smart contract will act as a bridge, providing a complete Ethereum node API directly on the ICP blockchain. Thanks to chain-key ECDSA signature technology, every smart contract on Internet Computer will now be able to interact seamlessly with the Ethereum blockchain. This will eliminate the need for a centralized gateway.\n\nAdditionally, this first step will facilitate communication between ICP smart contracts and Ethereum\u2019s diverse ecosystem, offering new and exciting possibilities for creators and users alike.\n\nThe second phase will introduce new tokens called chain-keys (ck), such as ckETH and ckERC-20, on Internet Computer. These tokens will enable very rapid transactions for almost nothing, thus offering great value to users of ICP\u2019s decentralized exchanges (DEXes). With this integration, transactions become ultra-fast and inexpensive, opening many opportunities for the ICP ecosystem.\n\nA surge in ICP crypto?\n\nThis strategic integration with Ethereum could well propel Internet Computer\u2019s native crypto to new heights. In response to DFINITY\u2019s announcement on X, most community members expect this integration to have a positive impact on the ICP crypto price.\n\n\u201cckETH will change the game and send ICP prices soaring.\u201d\n\n\u201cYahooo! ICP to the Moon\u2026\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cThe integration between ETH and Internet Computer is a significant step towards a transparent multi-chain environment.\u201d\n\nWhile some remain skeptical, crypto investors should closely monitor this collaboration, as the potential impact on ICP\u2019s price is undeniable. Currently, the price of Internet Computer is on major resistance around $4.85 after a 50% increase since October. If speculations about a price surge are confirmed, this resistance could be broken.\n\nIn any case, in the world of crypto and blockchain, this alliance between ICP and Ethereum is a crucial step towards increased connectivity and utility.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program!

        "content": "Share:\n\nEthereum price trades in a clear consolidative trend on the weekly time frame between $1,933 and $2,141 barriers.\n\nThe daily chart for ETH shows a sweep of Monday\u2019s high is likely to be followed by a sweep of Monday\u2019s low at $1,985.\n\nIf Bitcoin price undergoes a steep double-digit correction, Ether could also slide to $1,933 and $1,829 support levels.\n\nEthereum (ETH) price shows an ongoing consolidation with no directional bias. But a closer look at the daily chart shows that a potential correction might ensue, especially if Ether is influenced by Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nEthereum price prediction thesis and short-term bias\n\nAccording to Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) analysts, Bitcoin spot ETF is likely to be approved in January 2024. This development has caused FOMO among market participants, making the overall market outlook resoundingly bullish. Interestingly, this is one of the main drivers of the 2023 bull rally.\n\nRead more: Week Ahead: Bitcoin\u2019s bull trend in question as spot ETF momentum fades\n\nBut as the holiday season begins to kick in, liquidity in the market will diminish. Hence, cryptocurrency prices are likely to face manipulation. Additionally, Bitcoin price has already started to slow down its rally and has flashed multiple sell signals.\n\nIf Bitcoin price faces a minor correction, altcoins will shed double digits easily due to the nature of the connection between the two. Likewise, the Ethereum price will also see a correction to key support levels.\n\nRead more: Bitcoin Weekly Forecast: ETF delay and weekly swing failure could crash BTC to $30,000\n\nThis top-down Ethereum price analysis takes a look at ETH from weekly and daily time frames and forecasts buy-the-dip levels.\n\nEthereum price at critical levels on the weekly chart\n\nEthereum price has been in a multi-month consolidative trend that has produced an ascending triangle setup. While the technical formation is inherently bullish, it is only after a successful breakout. So far, ETH has not produced any discernible breakouts, just failed attempts.\n\nThe ascending triangle setup contains equal highs and higher lows, connected via trend lines. This setup shows that investors are becoming increasingly bullish and buying dips at an increasing rate.\n\nA breakout above the $2,000 psychological level was the first sign of a bullish move, but there has been a lot of back-and-forth around this level. To be precise, ETH is hovering between the second quarter high at $2,141 and weekly support at $1,933. This has been happening for the fourth consecutive week.\n\nWith Bitcoin\u2019s trend weakening and signaling a potential double-digit correction, Ethereum price might also catalyze a downside move to flush early longs. In such a case, ETH might eye a retest of the monthly open at $1,814 and a sweep of the monthly low at $1,782. This move would constitute a 9% to 12% move.\n\nETH/USDT 1-week chart\n\nETH bulls likely to take a backseat soon\n\nThe daily chart for Ethereum price shows more nuanced key levels, some of which coincide with the ones seen on the weekly.\n\nFor starters, this week\u2019s Monday range extends from $2,071 to $1,985. While the Monday high was swept on November 28, investors can expect a sweep of the Monday low in the coming days.\n\nA quick move to the downside with the intention of sweeping Monday\u2019s range could lead to a steep correction, especially if it is backed by BTC bears. In that case, investors need to take a look at the 40% Ethereum price rally witnessed between October 12 and November 10. This upswing created a local top at $2,138, and the midpoint of this move rests at $1,829, which coincides closely with the monthly open at $1,814 and monthly close of $1,782.\n\nAll in all, the $1,750 to $1,850 range seems like a good place to buy the dip if it ever comes to that.\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nWhile the short-term bearish or correction outlook is logical, it is completely contingent on Bitcoin\u2019s sell signals. If BTC lures shorts via a minor correction and proceeds to blast through $40,000, it would obliterate short sellers and cause a massive liquidation event that could sustain a move beyond $40,000.\n\nIn such a case, Ethereum price could overcome the $2,232 hurdle and eye a retest of the weekly resistance level at $2,521."

Source: SpotOnChain\n\nThe Ethereum (ETH) ICO\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation announced the ICO on July 22, 2014, starting at a price of 0.0005 BTC per ETH. This means 1 BTC bought 2,000 Ethers at that time, but the price progressed to a final 1,337 ETH per Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nTherefore, it is widely accepted that Ethereum had a final price of $0.311 by August 30, 2014, according to ICODrops. Estimations suggest a total of $16 million raised with the selling, besides 12,009,990.50 ETH kept by the Foundation, as reported by Galaxy. Essentially, close to 72 million ETH were initially distributed from the Genesis block.\n\nEthereum currently has 120.24 million ETH circulating in the cryptocurrency market. The first 72 million accrues for nearly 60% of its entirety. Meanwhile, on average, new tokens are distributed to staking validators every 14 seconds."

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nIn an unexpected announcement at Devconnect in Turkey, Ethereum\u2019s co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, revealed a visionary proposal that could make drastic changes to the Ethereum network. The proposed redesign, if implemented, could revolutionize the overall experience of users and developers within the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nEnhanced Ethereum Staking\n\nThe main goal of Buterin is to make strategic improvements to Ethereum staking, aiming to make the network more secure and scalable.\n\nAnd in turn, this will position Ethereum as a more affordable and user-friendly platform.\n\nPrivate Mempools\n\nAnother standout feature in Buterin\u2019s proposal is the integration of private mempools.\n\nThis innovative addition elevates user privacy and security by enabling transactions without exposing them to the public mempool.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis protects users from exploitation by miners, providing control over the visibility of their transaction history.\n\nThe Importance of ERC-4337\n\nThe introduction of ERC-4337 marks a significant stride in account abstraction.\n\nThis protocol gives users more control over their accounts and helps with the implementation of multi-signature wallets. Simultaneously, it improves overall security, which benefits the whole Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nCode Precompilation \u2013 Streamlining Smart Contracts\n\nButerin\u2019s proposal also includes the integration of code precompilation, which aims to help with the deployment of smart contracts.\n\nBy preprocessing specific elements of the code, this innovation could potentially increase the efficiency of executing smart contracts, making them quicker and more cost-effective.\n\nDecentralized Liquid Staking\n\nExpressing concerns over the centralization of existing liquid staking solutions, Buterin emphasizes the need for improvement in this area.\n\nLiquid staking allows users to liquidate staked or locked assets, but centralization risks have prompted Buterin to call for a decentralized approach. This move could democratize the staking process and allow more users to participate without sacrificing liquidity.\n\nThe Ripple Effect on Ethereum\u2019s Future\n\nIf Buterin\u2019s proposed redesign becomes a reality, Ethereum could solve its issues with scalability. These changes could significantly lower the barrier to entry for new users and developers, creating a more diverse ecosystem. While the exact impact on Ethereum\u2019s price and the broader crypto market remains speculative, trends suggest that fundamental improvements tend to increase a network\u2019s user base and value.\n\nEthereum is committed to evolving and implementing the latest blockchain technologies. And these upgrades can make it even better in terms of security and scalability. After all, it\u2019s not a surprise that Ethereum is the leading L1 chain."

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nAccording to the founder of Cardano, the Ethereum blockchain network appears to be mirroring Cardano\u2019s existing structure, as its co-founder attempts to restructure one of its most notable features. Hoskinson is convinced that Cardano has never been credited for its position in the industry as a prototype.\n\nIn a recent post shared to X, formerly Twitter, Charles Hoskinson has made some remarkable statements on the perceived impact that Cardano has had in the blockchain industry.\n\nThe Ethereum community has failed to commend Cardano as an innovative solution, despite Ethereum\u2019s attempts to reframe its network by replicating the features that Cardano has previously integrated into its platform.\n\n\u201c..I am truly at a loss that Cardano can never be mentioned as an innovative ecosystem on team E. V is rediscovering what we\u2019ve been working on for almost a decade and it\u2019s like a new revelation. It\u2019s extraordinary that we never get a shout-out.\u201d Hoskinson wrote.\n\nNot fueling hostilities but I am truly at a loss that Cardano can never be mentioned as an innovative ecosystem over on team E. V is rediscovering what we've been working on for almost a decade and it's like a new revelation. It's extraordinary that we never get a shout-out \u2014 Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) November 24, 2023\n\nHis statement was made in response to criticism from an X user who claimed that Hoskinson\u2019s recent remarks to Vitalik Buterin could fuel hostility between both communities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile Hoskinson denies this, he maintains that Ethereum\u2019s current version is still behind on innovation. Notably, a Cardano user shared a clip from a recent interview with Vitalik Buterin.\n\nIn the interview, Buterin highlighted the importance of solving the problem of centralization within the staking ecosystem. He added that the structure of staking pools and the difficulties surrounding solar staking have made staking less healthy.\n\nTo alleviate these issues, redesigning the staking system. He proposes introducing a UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) permit system to the network. It bears mentioning that Cardano already utilizes an extended UTXO model, known as the Extended-UTXO (EUTXO).\n\nButerin further observed that transferring funds would become even more decentralized under the UTxO approach.\n\nAs he explained,\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s [UTXO] like a virtual coin where I get a new coin if you pay me money. If I pay you money, I get to break up one of my new coins that are smaller, and then, I get back one of the coins. You get a totally new coin that gains the money you need.\u201d\n\nUsing the UTxO approach, user coins will never be at risk of being changed without their consent. On the other hand, a balanced-based system can only track the amount of funds in a user\u2019s possession.\n\nBalanced systems do not offer the same properties as a UTxO permit system. User funds are subject to external change, with or without their consent."

Both of these horizontal levels were tested twice, signaling uncertainty among market participants. However, this consolidation has formed a bearish reversal pattern, suggesting a potential further downside for ETH.\n\nAlso Read: Here\u2019s Why CBDCs Could Outshine BTC, Ethereum, and Other Private Cryptos\n\nadvertisement\n\nWill $ETH Consolidation Lead to Massive Leap?\n\nThe overhead supply at $2133 assists sellers in developing a bearish reversal pattern called double bottom\n\nThe $1917 level aligned with the 32.8% Fibonacci retracement level creates a strong support zone.\n\nThe intraday trading volume in Ether is $10.5 Billion, indicating a 16% gain.\n\nAmid the past two weeks\u2019 consolidation, the Ethereum price retreated twice from the $2133 resistance, indicating substantial overhead supply. These reversals have emphasized the emergence of a bullish reversal pattern known as a Double Bottom on the daily timeframe chart.\n\nTypically observed near market tops, this pattern signifies a decline in bullish momentum. At present, ETH trades at $2,025 and, with an intraday loss of 1.6%, is gradually approaching the neckline support at $1,970.\n\nA bearish breakdown below this neckline could intensify supply pressure, potentially causing ETH to drop to around the $1700 mark, marking a potential loss of 12%.\n\nHowever, the recent price rejections around the psychological support of $2,000 suggest buyers are attempting to counter the bearish setup. If this buying pressure persists, the ETH price might rebound to challenge the last swing high at $2133 and the upper trendline of a longstanding wedge pattern.\n\nETH Price Recovery to $3400\n\nOver the past 20 months, the ETH price has experienced a shallow recovery within a rising wedge pattern. Historically, the upper boundary of this trendline has resulted in increased supply pressure, leading to significant corrections. Therefore, the current upward movement towards this upper trendline necessitates a definitive breakout to confirm a bullish trend. A post-breakout rally could potentially drive prices up to $3400\n\nRelative Strength Index (RSI): A sharp drop in the daily RSI slope suggests a bearish divergence with the Ethereum price, hinting at potential upcoming downturns.\n\nBollinger Bands: The converging boundaries of the Bollinger Bands indicate an uncertain market sentiment prevailing for Ethereum."

According to Pal, the use of Solana comes with a whole different feel that makes it a top contender as a relatively more user-friendly option.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe said once someone starts using Solana, it \"feels super fast, slick, inviting and easy for the user.\" The accolade on Solana underscores the general perception most industry leaders have of the top coin, especially as it has been able to pull off a major comeback in its price action post-FTX implosion.\n\nOnce you play around in the $SOL ecosystem, it feels super fast, slick, inviting and easy for the user.\n\n\n\nThe best comparison is SOL is Apple and ETH is Android.\n\n\n\nBoth win. Huge. \u2014 Raoul Pal (@RaoulGMI) November 29, 2023\n\nRaoul Pal is known for his commentary in the industry with a basis rooted deep in on-chain analytics; however, choosing to comment on the combat between Ethereum and Solana on pure fundamentals is considered a rare move.\n\nIn his analysis, Pal compares Ethereum to the Apple of the blockchain world while he considers Ethereum to be the Android. The connotations are clear as Solana wins the fight for performance based on its speed, while Ethereum's massive hoard of hosted decentralized applications (dApps) makes its Android comparison a well-suited description.\n\nSolana and Ethereum have thriving ecosystems\n\nAlmost everything Ethereum can do, Solana can do as well. It appears that Raoul Pal has broad use of some of Solana's applications, as he attested to the ingenious designs of Phantom Wallet, the most popular unhosted Solana wallet. This he confirmed when an X user asked to know what his feedback is for Phantom Wallet and in his response, he said:\n\nAbsolutely love it. Super easy.\n\nSolana has impressed its holders in a remarkable way, with Raoul Pal confirming he has been bullish all year. The coin soared to its 2023 high earlier this month as it wiggles away from the impacts of the continuous sell-off from FTX, the bankrupt exchange that sought ways to free up funds to pay its investors and creditors."

Recently, a whale transaction caught the eye of many, as 3,150 ETH, valued at approximately $6.37 million, were sold at an average price of around $2,023, netting a substantial profit from an earlier purchase of 2,762 ETH at $1,825 each. This move has prompted discussion among traders: is it time to take profits on Ethereum?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Ethereum chart reveals a critical juncture in price action. After a period of bullish momentum, Ethereum is now testing local resistance levels, creating a moment of decision for investors. The current resistance, formed near the $2,050 mark, is a crucial threshold that has previously prompted sell-offs, suggesting that traders are eyeing this level to secure gains.\n\nConversely, the support levels paint a picture of potential bounce-back zones. The first significant support is visible near the $1,950 level, aligning with the 50-day moving average. This moving average has historically acted as a dynamic support, propelling prices upward upon contact. A break below this, however, could see Ethereum's price target the next support at approximately $1,850, where previous demand coalesced to halt bearish runs.\n\nThe probability of a price reversal hinges on the market's reaction to these critical technical levels. A convincing break above the current resistance could invalidate the bearish thesis, potentially leading to a continuation of the upward trend. However, recent whale activity suggests that some large holders are starting to realize profits, potentially adding to the selling pressure at this price threshold.\n\nVolume trends also provide insight, with a notable decrease in trading volume suggesting that the current price level may be unsustainable in the short term. Combined with the whale's cashout, it could signal a broader sentiment shift among investors, leading to increased volatility and a possible price correction."

        "content": "With Christmas on the horizon, astute investors redirect their focus to the cryptocurrency market to pursue opportunities that promise substantial returns. Among the notable cryptocurrencies, Ethereum (ETH) emerges as a top contender for holiday investments.\n\nWhy is this the case? ETH offers a distinctive combination of popularity and potential, making it particularly enticing during the festive season.\n\nGiven these dynamics, Finbold has leveraged PricePredictions for its AI advanced machine learning algorithms. These algorithms meticulously assess the ever-changing market conditions and analyze relevant indicators to estimate the likelihood of Ethereum experiencing gains by Christmas day.\n\nETH price prediction for December 25th. Source: PricePredictions\n\nThe algorithms project that ETH will increase to $2,040 by the end of the month, representing a 0.54% increase from the current asset price at the time of publication.\n\nThe computation is based on a broad range of technical indicators, encompassing moving average convergence divergence (MACD), relative strength index (RSI), Bollinger Bands (BB), and various others.\n\nEthereum price analysis\n\nThe Ethereum price has been undergoing a consolidative trend spanning several months, forming an ascending triangle setup. While this technical pattern is inherently bullish, confirmation only comes with a successful breakout. Up until now, ETH has yet to demonstrate any clear breakouts.\n\nThe ascending triangle configuration consists of highs that are equal and lows that are progressively higher, connected by trend lines. This arrangement indicates a growing bullish sentiment among investors, with an increasing tendency to buy dips.\n\nAt the time of press, ETH was trading at $2,031, representing a decrease of -1.44% in the previous 24 hours. These losses come after a week when this crypto lost 2.38% of its value, contrary to a 12.67% increase over the 30 days.\n\nETH 24-hours chart. Source: Finbold\n\nIn the last year, ETH price has increased by 61%, allowing it to outperform 69% of the top 100 crypto assets in this period.\n\nThis crypto trades above its 200-day simple moving average while experiencing 18 green days in the last 30 days.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "content": "Sentiment has been majorly bullish for Ethereum (ETH), particularly with the updates in the last two years. The cryptocurrency market expects a bull market by 2025, and investors are trying to predict its price for the next 24 months.\n\nHowever, predicting volatile cryptocurrencies\u2019 prices poses a challenge, and analysts will often miss their targets. Long-term projections increase the risk of inaccuracy, so investors should regularly revise their estimates.\n\nDespite the challenges, Finbold turned to artificial intelligence (AI) tools and expert cryptocurrency traders to present a conservative Ethereum price prediction for late 2025. Meanwhile, ETH is trading at $2,050 per token by press time.\n\nChatGPT bearish, neutral, and bullish ETH price predictions\n\nTherefore, ChatGPT-4 was prompted to give three conservative Ethereum price predictions for Q4 2025. One with a bearish bias, a neutral prediction, and a bullish forecast for last.\n\n\u201cBearish Prediction: Assuming potential regulatory pressure and competition from other blockchain platforms, Ethereum\u2019s price could face downward pressure. A conservative bearish forecast for Q4 2025 might be $1,500. Neutral Prediction: Factoring in modest market growth and technological advancements within the Ethereum ecosystem, a neutral outlook could place Ethereum at $2,500 by Q4 2025. Bullish Prediction: With the anticipation of a cryptocurrency bull run spurred by Bitcoin\u2019s halving in 2024, and given Ethereum\u2019s historical correlation with Bitcoin\u2019s price action, a bullish but conservative estimate for Ethereum might be $3,500 in Q4 2025.\u201d \u2014 ChatGPT-4\n\nChatGPT-4: 3 conservative Ethereum price predictions for late 2025. Source: Finbold\n\nThe bearish prediction of $1,500 would mean 27% losses from current prices, while the bullish prediction would reward investors with 70% gains in two years. Curiously, ChatGPT also forecasts Ethereum to increase by 20%, even with the neutral prediction of $2,500.\n\nExperts forecast Ethereum price for 2024\n\nNotably, the AI predictions are aligned with Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe\u2019s forecast for 2024. The expert cryptocurrency trader targets $1,800-$1,900 in a retrace and $3,100-$3,600 after an 18-month trend breakout.\n\nPersonally, I'm expecting that $ETH will continue to rally.\n\n\n\nIf there's a dip towards the $1,800-1,900 region, that's an area to enter as Ethereum wants to break out of an 18-month range.\n\n\n\nAfter that, targets at $3,100-3,600. pic.twitter.com/4IYQxRTtX0 \u2014 Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) November 27, 2023\n\nA more aggressive price prediction for late 2025 sees Ethereum outperforming Bitcoin (BTC) with 2,000% gains. Stockmoney Lizard shared a chart pattern backed by fundamental analysis.

        "content": "While the recent headlines may have captured Binance and CZ\u2019s legal troubles and the increased regulatory scrutiny on centralized exchanges, there has been a notable shift in the Ethereum staking pool dynamics.\n\nWith the increase in the number of validators exiting the pool, ETH issuance has seen a slowdown in its growth rate. This has subsequently resulted in the first reduction in the staking pool balance since the Shanghai upgrade.\n\nValidator Exodus\n\nAccording to blockchain intelligence platform Glassnode, an increasing number of validators are currently exiting the Ethereum staking pool.\n\nThe introduction of stake withdrawals in Shanghai acted as a catalyst, leading to a surge in validators leaving the staking pool, claiming rewards, and reshuffling their staking provider and setup. Exiting events averaged 309 validators per day during this time.\n\nThe report also observed a gradual increase in exiting events since early October, ultimately reaching an average of 1,018 validators per day. This uptick aligned with the recent uptrend in spot prices across crypto markets.\n\nAs a result, the Total Effective Balance \u2013 which represents the ETH in the Staking Pool that is actively participating in Proof-of-Stake Consensus \u2013 has slowed in its growth and is now undergoing the first decline since the Shanghai upgrade.\n\n\u201cRecent weeks have seen a notable change in the Ethereum staking pool dynamics, as the number of validators exiting the pool starts to increase. This has resulted in a slowdown of the growth rate for ETH issuance and the first reduction in the staking pool balance since the Shanghai upgrade.\u201d\n\nA majority of the exiting validators have voluntarily withdrawn over the past eight weeks. Meaning the stakers independently decided to exit the staking pool instead of slashing, which is a penalty applied to validators who violate protocol rules.\n\nDuring the same period, there have been only two instances of slashing, with one being significant, which involved the slashing of 100 recently joined validators who were penalized for simultaneously signing two different blocks within the network.\n\nWhat\u2019s Driving This Investor Behavior?\n\nSince October, Glassnode stated that centralized exchanges \u2013 particularly Kraken and Coinbase \u2013 have consistently led to stake withdrawals. Meanwhile, Liquid Staking Providers, dominated by Lido, have seen a modest increase in withdrawn stakes.\n\nInvestor behavior driving these trends includes a shift in staking setups, potentially driven by regulatory concerns, and a possible rotation of capital from CEXs to Liquid Staking Providers or safer assets like US treasuries.\n\nAdditionally, Lido stood out among Liquid Staking Providers for exits. Lido\u2019s dominance is further highlighted by a net increase in its staked balance by 468k ETH. In contrast, Coinbase and Binance showed net increases among CEXs, while Kraken experienced a reduction of -19.4k ETH. Among staking providers, HTX and Staked.us exhibited substantial reductions."

        "title": "2 Cryptocurrencies That Are Down 85% From Their All-Time Highs and Ready to Pop - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Despite the recent bull market rally, many top cryptos are still trading at a hefty discount to their all-time highs. Bitcoin, for example, is still trading at a 45% discount to its all-time high of $68,790. And Ethereum (ETH 3.03%) is still trading 59% below its all-time high of $4,891.\n\nDig a little bit deeper, and you can find billion-dollar cryptos trading anywhere from 70% to 90% below their all-time highs. Two that particularly stand out for me are Cardano (ADA 2.34%) and Avalanche (AVAX 2.51%). Both have market capitalizations north of $7.5 billion, both are former crypto darlings that are now trading at more than 85% discounts, and both have long-term growth catalysts in place. In short, they're both crypto tokens ready to pop.\n\n1. Cardano\n\nCardano, which is trading 87% below its all-time high of $3.10, is a Layer 1 blockchain, similar to Ethereum. In fact, the founder of Cardano (Charles Hoskinson) is one of the founders of Ethereum. As a result, it offers the same core functionality and utility as Ethereum, including non-fungible tokens (NFTs), decentralized finance (DeFi), Web3, and gaming.\n\nThat's why it's so puzzling that Ethereum, with a market cap of $242 billion, is worth nearly 20 times the value of Cardano, which has a market cap of just $13 billion. You can think of this from two different angles. From one perspective, investors have given up on Cardano ever surpassing Ethereum. From the other perspective, Cardano is a hidden gem that investors have somehow overlooked.\n\nI'm in the second group. There's a lot to like about Cardano, including its phenomenal success in DeFi this year.\n\nThis was an area where Cardano had badly lagged other rivals, including Ethereum. But if you look at current total-value-locked (TVL) figures for Cardano, the picture seems to have vastly improved. Cardano now ranks 12th among all blockchains.\n\nCardano's TVL (which is a useful way of measuring how much activity is taking place on a blockchain) has been pushing to new all-time highs this year. Over the past 10 months, Cardano has had success in several areas of DeFi, including the launch of new stablecoins and decentralized exchanges. All of this suggests that more growth could be on the way.\n\n2. Avalanche\n\nAvalanche is another Layer 1 blockchain that could be significantly undervalued. It currently trades around $20, still 86% below its all-time high of $146. Moreover, in terms of market cap, Ethereum is still 30 times more valuable than Avalanche.\n\nThe good news is that there's reason to think that Avalanche will eventually narrow this gap. During the last bull market rally, Avalanche was widely considered to be an \"Ethereum killer.\" Investors viewed it as one of a handful of blockchains ready to challenge Ethereum, primarily due to superior performance in terms of speed, efficiency, and costs.\n\nRight now, investors are willing to pay a premium for any blockchain capable of taking on Ethereum. Another potential \"Ethereum killer\" -- Solana -- is up nearly 450% for the year. If Avalanche starts to trade more like Solana, then it could really pop. While Avalanche is up 89% for the year, it's only recently that it has started to heat up.\n\nTaking a long-term view, what has me particularly intrigued is a partnership that Avalanche signed with the cloud computing unit of Amazon in January. At the time, the vision was for Avalanche to offer blockchain services to large enterprise and government clients, much like Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers cloud computing services to large enterprise and government clients.\n\nCan any blockchain ever overtake Ethereum?\n\nIf you are thinking about investing in Cardano and Avalanche, just ask yourself a simple question: Do you think any blockchain can ever supplant Ethereum as the world's preeminent Layer 1 blockchain?\n\nIf you think the answer is no, then there's no need for further due diligence. But if you think that, yes, there is a chance some other blockchain will eventually surpass Ethereum, then it's worth taking a deeper dive into the prospects of Cardano and Avalanche.\n\nAs Cardano and Avalanche chip away at the market dominance of Ethereum, they should become more valuable. And, as a result, the vast chasm that separates them from Ethereum in terms of market cap should continue to narrow.\n\nIf that's the case, then investing in them now, when they're still bargain-priced, could end up being a fantastic long-term investment strategy."

        "content": "In their quest for scalability and cost-effectiveness, many layer-2 networks adopt a centralized approach to on-chain transaction processing, introducing a single point of failure vulnerability. The Metis blockchain, however, has pioneered a distributed sequencer pool to improve security and decentralization.\n\nThe Ethereum blockchain introduced smart contracts to automate certain events on the network, laying the foundation of decentralized finance (DeFi). As the DeFi ecosystem continues its exponential growth, however, the limitations of Ethereum have become clear.\n\nDespite last year\u2019s migration to proof-of-stake, partially addressing the scalability issues of the Ethereum blockchain, the Ethereum network remains expensive when it comes to gas fees \u2014 the cost of each transaction executed on the blockchain. On top of that, the huge decentralized world built on Ethereum makes network congestion on the base layer a regular occurrence.\n\nThanks to the decentralized and open-source nature of the Ethereum blockchain, developers have built numerous networks on top of the base layer \u2014 called \u201clayer-2 blockchains\u201d \u2014 to fix specific limitations. Soon after, layer-2 (L2) networks that offer faster transaction speed or lower gas fees, including Arbitrum and Optimism, emerged.\n\nSequencer \u2014 key to order on blockchain\n\nHowever, one common aspect found in most layer-2 projects is that they rely on a single sequencer, which creates a vulnerability linked to centralization. But what exactly is a sequencer?\n\nIn blockchain terms, a sequencer operates like a traffic controller for on-chain transactions. A blockchain sequencer first collects on-chain transactions that would be included in a specific block. It puts transactions in order \u2014 an essential step for the network to function normally. The sequencer then places those transactions in a block, ensuring the block is filled correctly and in the right order.\n\nRelying on a single sequencer for ordering and placing on-chain transactions introduces a critical vulnerability known as a single point of failure (SPOF). If this sequencer malfunctions due to a cyberattack, technical glitch, or outside intervention, the entire blockchain network comes to a standstill. Additionally, a single sequencer may struggle to handle the increasing transaction volume, leading to scalability issues. To address these concerns, alternative solutions can be explored.\n\nDecentralizing the network controller\n\nMetis, a layer-2 Ethereum scaling solution, has introduced a decentralized sequencer pool to increase the transaction speed and throughput of blockchain while maintaining Ethereum\u2019s decentralization and security. Going beyond the single-sequencer model used by Arbitrum, Optimism, and other L2 projects, Metis is rolling out a distributed pool of sequencers \u2014 a fresh concept with built-in risk management that keeps the network up even if one of the many sequencers in the pool goes down for any reason.\n\nThe sequencer pool model works with Metis\u2019 existing decentralized peer-to-peer validators and block producer network to enable smooth and secure sequencer transitions while removing faulty or malicious nodes.\n\nThe architecture of Metis\u2019 decentralized sequencer pool. Source: Metis\n\nWith the decentralized approach, individual sequencer nodes can be created by whitelisted users. Metis has also announced a staking mechanism to work alongside the sequencer pool. Users will need to supply many locked METIS, the native token of the Metis network, to operate a sequencer node in the pool. By incentivizing staking with yields, Metis aims to get more sequencers onboard and gradually decrease the circulating supply.\n\nCommunity-driven network\n\nLoyal to the decentralization ethos, Metis plans to utilize the power of community to expand its network while keeping its network highly accessible with an easy-to-use Web3 building environment. The platform offers a streamlined user experience with gas fees that cost \u201cless than a penny\u201d while providing one of the fastest transaction speeds found in any L2 solution.\n\nTo foster community engagement and encourage participation in the upcoming launch of its decentralized sequencer, Metis is hosting its Community Testing event. This event will allow testers to earn rewards and contribute to the development of the project before the sequencer pool goes live.\n\n\u201cMetis is excited to roll out the first-ever layer 2 sequencer pool,\u201d said Tom Ngo, project lead at Metis.\n\n\u201cWe invite the entire blockchain and crypto communities to participate in Community Testing. By joining, users will be helping the core blockchain mission of decentralization while accruing attractive opportunities for each tester.\u201d\n\nAs the blockchain ecosystem grows with new projects, keeping the main pillars of decentralization intact is crucial. With its innovative approach to how blockchain operates, Metis\u2019 decentralized sequencer pool addresses the SPOF vulnerability while keeping its mission of rewarding the blockchain community in focus.\n\nLearn more about Metis"

        "content": "Major cryptocurrencies experienced a surge on Thursday evening, driven by two significant developments, one involving Bitcoin and the other Ethereum.\n\nCryptocurrency Gains +/- Price (Recorded 9:30 p.m. EST) Bitcoin BTC/USD +0.63% $37,947 Ethereum ETH/USD +3.15% $2,089 Dogecoin DOGE/USD +0.32% $0.081\n\nWhat Happened: On the Bitcoin front, Michael Saylor owned Microstrategy Inc MSTR, the largest corporate holder of BTC purchased an additional 16,130 BTC, valued at approximately $608 million based on current prices.\n\nAccording to a regulatory filing on Thursday, Microstrategy acquired bitcoin for $593.3 million in cash, at an average price of around $36,785 per coin. With this purchase, the company now holds a total of 174,530 BTC, acquired at an average price of about $30,252 per coin.\n\nOn the Ethereum front, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has officially acknowledged Fidelity Investments\u2019 filing for a spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF). Fidelity had initially submitted their SEC application on November 17.\n\nTop Gainer (24 Hour)\n\nCryptocurrency Gains +/- Price (Recorded 9:30 p.m. EDT) Celestia +11.96. $6.16 Injective +8.81% $18.25 Render +8.18% $3.19\n\nThe global crypto market cap has reached $1.42 trillion, marking a 0.40% decrease in the last 24 hours.\n\nThe S&P 500 rose by 0.4% to reach 4,567.80, indicating a positive performance. However, the Nasdaq Composite experienced a slight dip of about 0.2% and stood at 14,226.22.\n\nData released on Thursday revealed that the personal consumption expenditures price index, considered the Federal Reserve\u2019s preferred measure of inflation, showed a 3.5% increase on a year-over-year basis. This indicates a slowdown compared to the previous month\u2019s 3.7% annual gain.\n\nMoreover, the 10-year Treasury yield, which had caused concern among investors when it exceeded 5% last month, has seen a decline this month due to the release of cooling inflation data. On Thursday, the 10-year yield ticked slightly higher, reaching 4.34%.\n\nSee More: Best Cryptocurrency Scanners\n\nAnalyst Notes: Eli Taranto, Executive Director at EQI Bank in a note seen by Benzinga said, \"As inflation data coming out of the US shows signs of cooling, BTC remains within the $37K corridor. Interestingly, as more and more industry giants look to tokenization we may see another market driver. JP Morgan and Citibank have both launched tokenization projects. Many industry trials are expected to either near completion or finish this year, with the next stage rollout likely to excite markets.\"\n\nHe added, \"We may see another market driver begin to emerge, as tokenization begins to take center stage in the digital asset space. Two weeks ago, the Bank of Singapore, and the Bank of Korea started CBDC trials that include tokenization of bank assets.\"\n\nCryptocurrency analyst Michael Van de Poppe said that the Fidelity filing for an Ethereum Spot ETF supports his thesis. He predicts that, following Bitcoin\u2019s rise, Ethereum will surge to $3,500 in Q1 2024.\n\nAccording to pseudonymous crypto analyst Daan Crypto Trades, the pricing of Bitcoin has significantly improved, reaching a more \u201cfair value\u201d compared to the past. \"6-8 weeks ago, the value vs expectations just didn\u2019t match up. Clearly.\"\n\nAccording to data from Santiment, an on-chain data analytics firm, the number of exchange wallets has reached its lowest level in 6 months, with only 8.03 million ETH. In contrast, non-exchange wallets have soared to an all-time high of 41.03 million ETH. This data indicates a trend of more people choosing to move their coins to self custody.\n\nPhoto by Igor Faun on Shutterstock\n\nRead Next: Jim Cramer Advises Against Using Binance, Provokes Strong Reactions From Twitter Users"

        "content": "SPONSORED POST*\n\n$50 seems ambitious for Ethereum Classic in 2024; ETC will likely trade in the $25-30 range or higher\n\nExciting developments await the new meme coin, Rebel Satoshi\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC) last hit $50 in March 2022. Can 2024 be the year the \u2018original Ethereum\u2019 returns to this mark? Meanwhile, experts have made promising insights on better crypto to buy \u2013 Rebel Satoshi ($RBLZ). Let\u2019s compare the prospects of the two projects, beginning with Ethereum Classic.\n\nCan Ethereum Classic Reach $50 In 2024?\n\nThe notorious 2016 DAO (decentralized autonomous organization) hack split the then-emerging Ethereum. Some deleted this event from history and \u2018restarted\u2019 Ethereum. Meanwhile, based on the \u2018code is law\u2019 principles, others kept this historical data, renaming the network to Ethereum Classic.\n\nAlthough Ethereum Classic is the original, it receives far less attention and trading volume than Ethereum. Some investors are unaware that Ethereum Classic still exists, as it\u2019s nowhere near the list of top 10 altcoins. The second disadvantage is that Ethereum Classic hasn\u2019t evolved as competitively as Ethereum.\n\nThe main benefit of Ethereum Classic is that it often follows the price of Ethereum. With the massive adoption of the former, ETC\u2019s value can always rise accordingly. But hitting $50 in 2024 would take a huge 164% rise from the current value of $18.95. Conservative forecasts suggest ETC will likely hover in the $25-35 range (or higher) in 2024.\n\nMeanwhile, current investors in Rebel Satoshi can expect a 150% ROI much sooner due to the project\u2019s fast-moving presale.\n\nMuch Excitement In Store For Rebel Satoshi\n\nRebel Satoshi is a unique, rebel-inspired meme coin that will awaken the little guys who elite centralized systems have oppressed. The project is modeled after the heroic rebelliousness of Guy Fawkes and Satoshi Nakamoto. With their energy, Rebel Satoshi will succeed in any objective it sets, demonstrating the power of a unified community.\n\nThe project\u2019s goal is to hit a $100 million market cap before steadily climbing high in the rankings of meme-based top altcoins. It has an attractive ecosystem focused on community-building, meme culture, and financial rewards.\n\nThe Rebellion Secret Council is a space for early supporters to govern the platform and receive insider updates. These adopters can also be inducted into the Rebel Meme Hall of Fame by sharing their best rebel-themed memes for laughs and popularity.\n\nThe second part is the Rebel Artefacts Vault, a splendid NFT marketplace representing the project\u2019s story. It\u2019s a treasure trove of 9,999 collectibles and digital art characters. Finally, the Revolutionary Staking Hub is set to offer excellent passive income from staking the $RBLZ token.\n\n$RBLZ has a fixed supply (250 million) to honor Nakamoto\u2019s deflationary vision. Moreover, Rebel Satoshi will \u2018burn\u2018 any unsold $RBLZ after its presale is complete in a symbolic nod to Guy Fawkes.\n\nSpeaking of which, the presale is in the first or Early Bird Round, with $RBLZ trading for $0.010. The aftermath has many exciting expectations, like a 150% return for current buyers since the token is set to trade at $0.025. So, it\u2019s a no-brainer to join sooner than later!\n\nFor the latest updates and more information, be sure to visit the official Rebel Satoshi Presale Website or contact Rebel Red via Telegram\n\n*This article was paid for Cryptonomist did not write the article or test the platform."
