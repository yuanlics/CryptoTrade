        "content": "What is Ethereum?\n\nEthereum was the first cryptocurrency to introduce smart contracts. A smart contract is a tiny piece of code that lives on the blockchain, and it's the technology behind the decentralized finance (DeFi) industry. A large proportion of decentralized applications are built on the Ethereum ecosystem, although Ethereum now has a lot of competitors that want to take some of its market share.\n\nWhere can you buy Ethereum?\n\nYou can buy Ethereum from almost any cryptocurrency platform. You can even buy Ethereum from some Bitcoin ATMs in the U.S. Let's look at the differences between apps, exchanges and brokers.\n\nCryptocurrency brokers: Several traditional stock brokers offer a limited selection of cryptocurrencies alongside their other products. These are a great option for people who want to add Ethereum to their investment portfolio without opening a new crypto exchange account. Be aware that most crypto brokers don't offer external wallets so it may not be easy to withdraw or deposit crypto assets.\n\nSeveral traditional stock brokers offer a limited selection of cryptocurrencies alongside their other products.

Cryptocurrency exchanges: These are the most common way to buy and sell cryptocurrencies, and plenty of exchanges offer lots of ways to deposit fiat currency (such as U.S. dollars), reasonable fees, and a sizable list of tradable coins. On the downside, these exchanges are not subject to the same regulations as stock brokers.\n\nThese are the most common way to buy and sell cryptocurrencies, and plenty of exchanges offer lots of ways to deposit fiat currency (such as U.S. dollars), reasonable fees, and a sizable list of tradable coins. On the downside, these exchanges are not subject to the same regulations as stock brokers. Cryptocurrency apps: Most cryptocurrency brokers and exchanges also have mobile apps to make it easy to trade on the go. You can also buy Ethereum using payment apps such as Venmo and Paypal.\n\nWhat to look for when buying Ethereum\n\nBuying Ethereum for the first time can be a little daunting. But there are a lot of excellent products out there, it's just a question of finding the right platform for you.\n\nHere are some key questions to help you find the best place to buy Ethereum.\n\n1. What fees will you have to pay?\n\nBroadly speaking, there are three types of fees to watch out for:\n\nDeposit fees\n\nTrading fees\n\nWithdrawal fees\n\nWe'll break these down in more detail below. Just be aware that fees are rarely standard across the various trading platforms. For example, you might find a cryptocurrency exchange that offers free trading but charges you a lot of money to withdraw your funds.\n\nDon't be afraid to open a couple of accounts and experiment. But don't deposit any money until you're comfortable with the fee structure.\n\n2. How will the platform secure your assets?\n\nCryptocurrency investment is an exciting world, but unfortunately it has attracted its fair share of bad actors. In addition to the risk of hacking, the collapse of FTX also demonstrated that we don't always know what an exchange is doing with your money. Simply put, cryptocurrency exchanges don't have the same investor protections and security as you'd find in banks and other financial institutions.\n\nIf a crypto exchange or broker is not transparent about its security systems, this should be a major red flag. Sometimes you'll read that a company doesn't want to disclose these details for security reasons, but that's misleading. There's plenty of information a trading platform can reveal without compromising its systems.\n\n3. Are there any sign-up bonuses?\n\nSome platforms offer sign-up bonuses for new investors. You might find a platform that gives you a small bonus when you start, or one that offers a bonus when you make a certain amount of trades or deposit a certain amount of money. While these are tempting, don't let them drive your decision-making. It may be a great tie breaker, but there's no point in signing up for the wrong exchange just because you want the bonus.\n\n4. Is it available in my country or state?\n\nSome cryptocurrency exchanges can't operate in the U.S., and only a handful are licensed to operate in every state. For example, New York has some of the strictest crypto exchange regulation and will actively pursue rule breakers. As such, it's good to check that the exchange you want to use is allowed to operate where you live.\n\n5. Does it have all the features you need?\n\nIf you're buying Ethereum for the first time, you'll want an easy-to-use platform with plenty of educational resources. If you prefer mobile apps to web browsers, look for an exchange with a good app.\n\nOther useful features include:\n\nThe ability to set up automatic monthly transfers\n\nGood customer service\n\nAn external wallet\n\nWe'll talk about wallets in more detail shortly. If you're an active Ethereum trader, you might also want advanced features such as limit orders and good charting tools.\n\n6. Can I stake or earn interest on my Ethereum?\n\nLast year, Ethereum moved to what's called a proof-of-stake system, changing the way it validates transactions. It is part of a wider upgrade to make the popular blockchain more scalable, more sustainable, and more secure.\n\nWithout getting too technical, one impact is that investors can stake their ETH tokens to earn rewards. Proof-of-stake cryptos pay rewards to holders who are willing to tie up their tokens to contribute to network security. As a long-term investor, this is a great way to earn passive income from your Ethereum investment.\n\nHowever, be aware that there's a difference between staking and the crypto lend-earn products offered by some platforms. Some exchanges use the word \"staking\" for any kind of activity that will generate interest. But there's a big difference. When a crypto earn platform offers high rates of interest, you don't know what risks it is taking with your assets. And if it collapses, you could lose your crypto completely.\n\n7. Does it have a wide selection of cryptocurrencies?\n\nIf you only want to buy Ethereum or Bitcoin (BTC), you won't need an exchange with lots of tokens. However, if you see buying Ethereum as the first step on a longer crypto-trading journey, a long list of altcoins is a bonus. It's worth understanding an exchange's policy on adding new coins too -- does it try to filter out potential scams or is it looking to list as many coins as possible?\n\nCheck out our cryptocurrency exchange reviews for more options."

        "content": "Ethereum has formed a \u201cgolden cross\u201d pattern on the 1-week timeframe, marking the second such signal this year. While the long-term implications could be very positive if history repeats itself, there are reasons to temper expectations.\n\nA weekly golden cross has formed | ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nEthereum Golden Cross And A Possible Target For New ATHs\n\n1W ETHUSD has formed a golden cross for the second time in 2023. A golden cross is a buy signal in moving average-based trading systems. It suggests that the trend is moving in an upward direction and because trends tend to persist, this is notable.\n\nThe golden signal occurs when a shorter-term moving average (the 50-week MA) crosses through a longer-term moving average (the 200-week MA) from below. A death cross forms when the opposite happens.\n\nThe last confirmed golden cross for Ethereum in December 2020 preceded a massive 600% rally over the next year to the asset\u2019s all-time high near $4,900. A repeat move of similar magnitude this time would put Ethereum above $12,000\u2014over six times today\u2019s price of around $2,000.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that not all golden crosses lead to the anticipated upside. In 2023 alone, 1W ETHUSD has death crossed and golden crossed twice now, demonstrating how moving average-based systems are prone to whipsaw without an established trend to follow.\n\nAbove 20 on the ADX confirms the trend | ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nAn Uptrend Or More Whipsaw? How The ADX Confirms Trends\n\nThe whipsawing death cross and golden cross price action on the Ethereum 1-week chart failed to generate follow-through in either direction. So how can we be sure that this isn\u2019t yet another premature crossover?\n\nThis is where the Average Directional Index (ADX) comes in when gauging the validity of moving average crosses. The ADX aims to measure trend strength, typically on a scale of 0 to 100.\n\nAs the 1-week ADX edges up from below 20, it confirms growing momentum that reduces the odds of more whipsawing price action. Traders often use such ADX readings to confirm golden/death crosses and enter only the most high-conviction signals.\n\nThe 1W ETHUSD Average Directional Index isn\u2019t yet above 20, but is approaching this key level. Above it, it gives the golden cross much more validity.\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "The introduction of Ethereum Foundation\u2019s ERC-4337 account abstraction standard earlier this year drew much attention, but adoption and retention are off to a slow start.\n\nExisting hardware wallets rely on a pair of keys. If those keys are compromised, so are tokens in the wallet. The ERC-4337 standard was instead intended as a new baseline for how users interact with crypto wallets services, including social recovery mechanisms and other multisig options.\n\nThe standard turns Ethereum accounts into \u201csmart accounts,\u201d which are much more flexible to suit the needs of wallet holders.\n\nAccording to data on BundleBear:\n\nWeekly retention for ERC-4337 smart wallets drops as low as 1% for accounts older than five weeks.\n\nAn average smart account only sends five user operations.\n\nRevenue for transaction \u201cbundlers\u201d is also low, currently less than $8,000 per week.\n\nRead more: What Are Smart Contract Wallets? A Beginner\u2019s Guide\n\nAt the time of writing, daily active users are at around 3%, sixdegree data shows. Most smart account users today are on the Polygon network, making up over 66% of all smart account holders and almost all monthly new users by chain.\n\nDespite the low adoption rates on Ethereum, industry participants remain optimistic about the future of smart accounts and have been actively working on proposals to spur usage.\n\nJohn Rising, the co-founder of Stackup, an account abstraction infrastructure company, notes that many existing issues with ERC-4337 can be resolved with the first-ever Rollup Improvement Proposal, RIP-7560.\n\nThe existing ERC-4337 standard is considered a \u201csemi-native+\u201d smart account, where a user does not need a private key because the trustless relay network is designed to forward transactions to the blockchain.\n\nRising believes that the goal is to move towards a \u201cnative\u201d smart account, where accounts would be able to specify their own validation logic, completely removing the need for a private key \u2014 something that RIP-7560 hopes to do.\n\n\u201cERC-4337 has always been intended as a stepping stone to native account abstraction. The account abstraction proposal, RIP-7560, is designed to be backwards compatible with ERC-4337,\u201d Rising told Blockworks.\n\nFurther discussions around the proposal and its applicability must still be considered. Native account abstraction has drawn concerns over the complexity it adds, as it introduces consensus layer changes rather than just high-level infrastructure layer modifications.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

Understand that both digital assets have unique features of their own, distinguishable in terms of purpose and functionality.\n\nIn this article, we will help you compare and contrast these two cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and Ethereum. We will also help you see and forecast how they will play out in the future of digital assets.\n\nUnleash the potential of leverage trading!

Don\u2019t miss out on this exclusive offer; claim your bonus now!\n\nWhat is Bitcoin?\n\nBitcoin, a digital currency, operates without reliance on central authorities such as banks or governments. Satoshi Nakamoto, a pseudonym, introduced Bitcoin in 2009. Bitcoin has established a significant presence so far as the pioneer and most valuable asset in the burgeoning cryptocurrency domain.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s goal is to enable decentralized peer-to-peer transactions. In the Bitcoin network, transactions undergo authentication via a proof-of-work consensus mechanism. Bitcoin mining involves users validating transactions on the network. This process confirms the consistency of new transactions with previous ones, ensuring the impossibility of spending non-existent or already spent Bitcoins. This system also incentivizes cryptocurrency miners by rewarding them with BTC for validating transactions.\n\nMining is the backbone of Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain technology. This feature enables a public, unalterable ledger of transactions, organized into interconnected blocks. The blockchain ensures transactional integrity, maintaining a consistent record across the network.\n\nUnleash the potential of leverage trading! Join Bybit today with our link, complete KYC, and earn up to a $40 bonus on a $100 deposit. Don\u2019t miss out on this exclusive offer; claim your bonus now!\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Strengths\n\nCost-Efficiency and Speed \u2013 Bitcoin transactions offer significant cost savings and speed. Bitcoin can be used for global transfers, reducing both time and potential costs associated with peer-to-peer transactions.\n\nEnhanced Privacy \u2013 Unlike traditional transactions, Bitcoin transactions do not record personal information like names or credit card numbers. While wallet ownership can potentially be linked to individuals, Bitcoin transactions generally offer greater privacy than, say, credit card transactions.\n\nDecentralization \u2013 Bitcoin operates independently of conventional banks, governments, or third parties, presenting an attractive alternative for those wary of traditional financial systems.\n\nGrowth Potential \u2013 Many investors hold Bitcoin with the expectation that its value will increase as it becomes more trusted and widely used. This long-term perspective is based on the belief in Bitcoin\u2019s maturing market and potential for value appreciation.\n\nWhat is Ethereum?\n\nEthereum represents a significant evolution in blockchain technology, functioning as a decentralized network backed by the Ether (ETH) token. The platform enables a wide array of activities, such as automated transaction execution, token staking, minting and trading of nonfungible tokens (NFTs), and blockchain games, among others.\n\nOften regarded as the next evolutionary stage of the internet, Ethereum is likened to the transition from Web 2.0 to Web 3.0. It ushered in innovations such as decentralized applications (DApps), decentralized finance (DeFi), and decentralized exchanges (DEXs).\n\nLike Bitcoin, Ethereum transactions are recorded in blocks on the Ethereum blockchain. These transactions are validated by miners. Successful miners receive rewards in ETH, Ethereum\u2019s native cryptocurrency. However, Ethereum is already working on a full transition towards a full proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus model as it shifts to Ethereum 2.0. This step seeks to resolve scalability issues on Ethereum\u2019s blockchain.\n\nDiffering from Bitcoin, ETH functions more as a utility token with an infinite supply. Ether is continually introduced into circulation as mining rewards and will also be issued as staking rewards in the network\u2019s anticipated shift to a proof-of-stake (PoS) model.\n\nUnleash the potential of leverage trading! Join Bybit today with our link, complete KYC, and earn up to a $40 bonus on a $100 deposit. Don\u2019t miss out on this exclusive offer; claim your bonus now!\n\nEthereum\u2019s Strengths\n\nSmart Contracts \u2013 Ethereum revolutionizes traditional finance through smart contracts, enabling different functions and services without the need for middlemen. These contracts are immutable once established, ensuring transparency and fairness in transactions without intermediaries.\n\nEase of Acquiring Ether \u2013 Acquiring Ether has become increasingly accessible with mainstream financial platforms like PayPal and Venmo allowing users to purchase cryptocurrencies directly within their applications. This integration exposes a vast user base to Ethereum.\n\nAccess to DeFi services \u2013 Many DeFi projects in the cryptocurrency space are developed on top of the Ethereum blockchain. Owning ETH makes it easier for holders to access a wide array of DeFi products and services, such as NFT trading, staking, yield farming, and more.\n\nComparing Bitcoin and Ethereum\n\nBoth Bitcoin and Ethereum are blockchain-based, but they differ significantly in their technical specifications. Bitcoin uses a Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism, requiring miners to solve complex problems, limiting scalability and energy efficiency. Ethereum also uses PoW but is transitioning to Proof of Stake (PoS), which is more scalable and environmentally friendly.\n\nThe transaction speed of both is lower compared to traditional payment systems, with Bitcoin at about 7 transactions per second and Ethereum at 15. However, both are developing solutions like SegWit, Lightning Network, and sharding to improve this. Additionally, Ethereum\u2019s use of the Turing-complete language Solidity allows for more complex applications than Bitcoin\u2019s Script language\u200b\u200b.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s primary role is as a store of value and medium of exchange, with secondary functions including remittances and financial inclusion. Ethereum, however, serves primarily as a platform for running smart contracts and dApps, impacting various industries such as finance, gaming, and healthcare. Ethereum also supports the issuance of various digital tokens and is a key player in the decentralized finance (DeFi) movement\u200b\u200b.\n\nFinally, both cryptocurrencies have seen remarkable price fluctuations. BTC\u2019s price has soared since its inception, reflecting its dominance and adoption but also its volatility. ETH, though younger, has shown rapid growth and innovation, hosting numerous dApps and transactions. However, it faces significant price volatility.\n\nUnleash the potential of leverage trading! Join Bybit today with our link, complete KYC, and earn up to a $40 bonus on a $100 deposit. Don\u2019t miss out on this exclusive offer; claim your bonus now!\n\nFuture of Bitcoin and Ethereum\n\nThe future of Bitcoin and Ethereum will primarily be shaped by their ongoing developments. Bitcoin, established as a digital store of value akin to gold, is likely to continue its role as a major player in the cryptocurrency market. Its fixed supply cap and widespread recognition contribute to its potential as a hedge against inflation and economic instability. However, scalability issues and environmental concerns related to its PoW mechanism may continue to influence its adoption.\n\nEthereum\u2019s future is geared towards extensive application in decentralized systems, given its transition to a PoS consensus mechanism and focus on smart contracts and dApps. This shift not only addresses scalability and environmental sustainability but also broadens its utility in various sectors like finance, healthcare, and entertainment. Ethereum\u2019s adaptability and innovation, particularly in the DeFi and NFT spaces, position it as a key driver in the advancement of Web 3.0, potentially revolutionizing how we interact with digital services and assets.\n\nEnhance Your Crypto Trading Skills With Our Legends\u2019 Trading Masterclass\n\nEmpower your crypto trading skills with our Legends Masterclass.

        "content": "Trading-focused Layer 1 blockchain Sei SEI +0.52% will add support for the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) in its upcoming version 2 (V2) upgrade. This will enable developers to port Ethereum-based contracts over to the network and use them on it.\n\nTo add this feature, Sei V2 will incorporate Geth, a Go implementation of the Ethereum Virtual Machine. Geth is the most widely used Ethereum client software.\n\nSei Labs told The Block that it has developed a specialized interface to facilitate interaction of Sei's existing smart contracts component (based on CosmWasm technology) with the EVM component. CosmWasm is a custom Cosmos SDK module that allows chains to operate smart contracts in the Cosmos ecosystem. With V2, the team will enable an efficient integration of EVM support into the Sei network.\n\n\"Sei V2 is an additive change. All of the existing components like CosmWasm will continue to exist. Since this is a proposed chain modification, the different virtual machines will also be able to interact with each other, allowing for Sei V2 to be the first network where EVM and Cosmwasm contracts are able to call each other,\" Jay Jog, co-founder at Sei Labs told The Block.\n\nExpanding on Sei V1\n\nSei has been operational on the mainnet beta since the V1 launch in August, offering support for Cosmos smart contracts written in Rust. With Sei V2, the team behind it aims to broaden its appeal to a wider range of developers. The development will add a fully parallelized EVM-compatible layer with sub-second finality (the speed at which transactions are confirmed).\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nIn addition to EVM support, Sei V2 introduces SeiDB, a data structure that purports to improve the platform\u2019s storage layer. According to the team, SeiDB will prevent state bloat \u2014 where the network becomes excessively data heavy \u2014 and simplify the state synchronization process for new nodes. The objective here is to boost the overall performance and scalability of the Sei blockchain.\n\nThe Sei V2 upgrade is currently nearing completion from a code development perspective and is undergoing a rigorous audit process to ensure its security. It is scheduled to be released on a public testnet in the first quarter of 2024, with the mainnet deployment expected in the first half of the year.\n\nWhat is Sei?\n\nSei is a Cosmos SDK-based proof-of-stake blockchain, designed to be optimized for trading with its ability to execute sub-second blocks. In April 2023, Sei Labs, the core developer of the network, raised $30 million in two strategic funding rounds from venture firms including Jump and Multicoin Capital.\n\nWith functionality that supports fast decentralized trading, Sei targets a specific niche where it competes with other Cosmos chains like Osmosis, Kava, Injective, Neutron and Kujira."

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nHere are the top three news stories by U.Today from the past day.\n\nEthereum's Vitalik Buterin says AI could pose \"existential risk\"\n\nIn a recently published longread essay on his blog, Ethereum cofounder Vitalik Buterin has issued an unsettling warning about AI. According to Buterin, AI could potentially outsmart humans and take over as the dominant power on Earth. He cautions that if a superintelligent AI saw humans as a threat, it could lead to disastrous consequences. Even though these issues seem that they will be a pain in the neck for our descendants in the distant future, one should keep in mind the rapid pace at which AI is advancing. Additionally, we still have not figured out how to program these super intelligent beings to live safely alongside humans. Buterin also challenges his readers to imagine living in a society ruled by artificial intelligence, referring to Iain Banks's Culture series, where humans coexist with powerful AI. In this imagined future, humans are offered longevity, health and entertainment, but at the cost of control over AI.\n\nElon Musk's X secures new payment license in key US state\n\nOn Nov. 27, Elon Musk-owned X platform achieved an important milestone on its path to becoming the \"everything app\"; it secured a money transmitter license from South Dakota regulators. The license enables the company to facilitate seamless cross-border money transfers. In total, X can provide money transmitting services in 10 American states: Arizona, Georgia, Iowa, Maryland, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and, newly added, South Dakota. With its most recent license, X might strengthen its position as a strong competitor in the financial services industry, comparable to well-known firms like Stripe and PayPal.\n\nShiba Inu (SHIB) cryptic text thrills community"

        "title": "What Is Block Time? What It Measures, Verification, and Example - Investopedia",
        "content": "What Is Block Time?\n\nBlock time measures the time it takes the miners or validators within a network to verify transactions within one block and produce a new block in that blockchain.\n\nBlockchains were first popularized by Bitcoin when it was introduced in 2009. The technology has grown as more cryptocurrencies are created, each of which can use a different or identical blockchain, validation methods, and techniques for creating new blocks.\n\nKey Takeaways Block time is the time it takes to process a block in a cryptocurrency blockchain.\n\nOn the Bitcoin blockchain, a block is verified by miners, who compete against each other to verify the transactions and solve the hash, which creates another block.\n\nOn the Ethereum blockchain, a block is validated by randomly selected nodes, which is must faster because there is no competition.\n\nOther chains might use different mechanisms, which would affect their block times.\n\nUnderstanding Block Time\n\nA blockchain is a distributed database that records all transactions within a cryptocurrency network. You can think of a block within the database as a cell in a spreadsheet where transaction information is stored. Bitcoin miners verify the transactions, which takes time because finding the solution to the encryption problem requires the computers to make a vast number of trial-and-error attempts.\n\nOn the Bitcoin blockchain, this is called hashing\u2014generating random hexadecimal numbers to try and find one that is less than or equal to one set by the network. When the block solution is found or otherwise validated, a new block is opened. The amount of time it takes to find the solution and create a new block is the block time.\n\n\n\nHere are a few key points to remember if you're trying to understand block time:\n\nA block is a record of the most recent cryptocurrency transactions, similar to a cell in a table of columns and rows.\n\nEach block contains the information from the block that preceded it in hashed form (that's why it is theoretically impossible to alter cryptocurrency).\n\nOn the Bitcoin blockchain, cryptocurrency \"miners\" race against each other to generate a random hash plus the nonce that is less than or equal to the target hash. The winner receives a reward.\n\nEthereum validators use a different consensus mechanism, which makes the block times shorter.\n\nBlockchains that use other mechanisms may have shorter or longer block times.\n\nWhy Block Times Differ\n\nConsensus mechanisms are what allow a network of participants to agree that a transaction is valid. Cryptocurrencies can use different consensus mechanisms, which, among other factors, affect the time it takes to verify transactions and create new blocks.\n\nProof-of-work and proof-of-stake are two types of consensus mechanisms that use different transaction verification methods. Each blockchain has a different block time because of the way their mechanisms work\u2014Bitcoin averages about 10 minutes, while Ethereum only takes around 12 seconds.\n\nThe exact amount of time it takes for block generation on the Bitcoin proof-of-work blockchain is governed by the difficulty level, which changes with network traffic and the number of miners on the network to keep block times at 10 minutes.\n\nEthereum uses proof-of-stake, which is much faster because there is no competition for a reward\u2014participants with staked ether are randomly selected to validate the transactions and receive network fees.\n\nBlock Time vs. Confirmation Time\n\nSometimes confused with each other, block times and confirmation times are two different measurements on a blockchain. Confirmation time is the amount of time it takes a blockchain to confirm a transaction.\n\nIt's often thought that a transaction needs six confirmations before it goes through; however, this is a misunderstanding. When a transaction makes it into a block, and the block is closed, the transaction has one confirmation and concludes. The number six comes from the belief that a transaction that was confirmed six times (included in six closed blocks) is secure from any network attacks.\n\nA block may be opened every 10 minutes on the Bitcoin blockchain, but not all transactions that occur within that period can be sent to the current block to be mined and confirmed. Confirmation can take up to several hours on the Bitcoin blockchain because transactions are sent to a mempool, where they are queued in order of the amount of fees paid.\n\nUsers who want their transactions placed in front of others pay more than the average, while those who pay average or below-average fees must wait their turn to be sent to a block, verified, and confirmed at least once.\n\n\n\nHow Many Bitcoins Will Ever Be Created? Bitcoin has a limit of 21 million. There are over 19 million Bitcoins in circulation, and the number of Bitcoins created yearly halves every four years. This slows down Bitcoin creation over time.\n\nHow Many Ethereum Will Ever Be Created? Ethereum, unlike Bitcoin, doesn't have an upper limit on the number of coins that will be created.\n\nHow Do I Get a Bitcoin Block? You never actually receive a Bitcoin block since it is part of Bitcoin's framework. Instead, you receive a reward of bitcoin when your miner solves the hash and creates another block.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nBlocks are one of the structures used in a blockchain that store information. The time it takes to open a new block on a chain is that chain's block time. Block times differ from confirmation times, which can take several hours or days to complete.\n\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes online.

        "content": "Institutional investors are buying a lot of ETH-related trusts.\n\nETH 2.0 seemed to have convinced these players of the project\u2019s long-term potential.\n\nFunds flowing into Ethereum [ETH] trusts and ETFs have been increasing since the 23rd of November, according to data observed by AMBCrypto. At press time, the Ethereum Funds Holdings, provided by CryptoQuant, had increased to 3.17 million.\n\nThe increase in metric is a testament to the increasing demand by institutions for investments linked to the altcoin.\n\nBig players love the ETH play\n\nWoominkyu, a verified author on CryptoQuant Woominkyu also corroborated AMBCrypto\u2019s examination of the market sentiment.\n\nHowever, Woominkyu went deep by looking at the effect of the inflow on ETH\u2019s price action. The analyst, after checking the impact, noted that:\n\n\u201cThis surge, occurring as Ethereum\u2019s price stabilizes between 1.8K and 1.9K USD, signals a growing interest from institutional investors. It reflects their strong belief in Ethereum\u2019s long-term value and the market\u2019s potential for growth.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, the long-term bullish sentiment could also be linked to the optimism around a potential spot ETF approval. But besides that, there were other reasons. In fact, some were linked to the changes the blockchain made over the last year.\n\nTop of the list is Ethereum\u2019s transition to Proof-of-Stake (PoS), popularly called the Merge. Consensys, in a blog post last year, envisioned the possible impact of the Merge on institutional inflow.\n\nOne of these includes improved security, meaning that institutional investors now have more confidence in the protocols\u2019 ability to secure their funds.\n\nAnother factor talked about is the deflationary supply. The deflationary supply reduces the rise of seeing ETH go to zero. With respect to this, the Ethereum-powered software company mentioned:\n\n\u201cFor institutions, ETH may become a more attractive asset, as reduced supply may lead to an increase in value.\u201d\n\nBelief is back\n\nThe Shapella upgrade, activated in April, also contributed to the faith these large investors have in Ethereum. The Total Value Locked (TVL) of Ethereum also aligned with the notion that more participants now trust the blockchain compared to 2022.\n\nAt press time, Ethereum\u2019s TVL was $26.02 billion.\n\nThe TVL value mentioned represented a 19.31% increase in the last 30 days. Should the metric continue to increase, then both retail and institutions will look towards buying the coin for potential long-term gains.\n\nA close look at the Long-Term Holder Net Unrealized Profit and Loss (LTH-NUPL) showed that the market mood has moved from hope (orange) to optimism (yellow). The LTH-NUPL serves as an indicator to assess the behavior of long-term holders.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-2024\n\nSo, this movement means holders of the altcoin are no longer fearful. Rather, most now have the belief that ETH has great future potential.\n\nIf the ETH price moves past $2,000 in the coming weeks, then the LTH-NUPL will switch to the belief stage. At this point, a lot of accumulation may occur that could send ETH into an extended rally."

        "content": "In an exclusive interview with Fortune, Vitalik Buterin, the brains behind Ethereum, shares his thoughts on everything from blockchain technology to AI to the people who most inspire him.\n\nHe also discusses what\u2019s happened since Ethereum\u2019s transition from proof of work to proof of stake and how spending time in Antarctica could help prepare humans\u2014maybe even him?\u2014for interplanetary travel.\n\n(This interview has been edited for length and clarity.)\n\nWhat use cases for blockchain excite you the most?\n\nThere are a few different categories of blockchain applications that I think can be valuable, and I wrote about some of these in a blog post last year, but a summary would be: One, currency applications are valuable, especially in the developing world. And two, identity, reputation, and decentralized social applications are exciting due to their potential network effects and enhanced security.\n\nGoing into the specifics of one application, I\u2019ve been using Farcaster a lot recently. There\u2019s a lot of interest in creating alternative stuff to Twitter now\u2014lots of people are either unhappy with various things that Elon does or people just realize that this is a monopoly and we need alternatives.\n\nSome of these have been on-chain. For example, my Farcaster account is connected to an Ethereum address, and if I lose my Farcaster key, I can use my Ethereum address to recover it. This is actually more secure than what centralized social media do, where they rely on phone numbers that can be hacked.\n\nOne of the big challenges in social media is how you tell who is a human and who is a bot. There\u2019s just lots of incentives for malicious actors to just create 50,000 bots. The nice thing about Ethereum is that it already has this lively on-chain ecosystem where there are different ways of doing that.\n\nOne is you can verify just the existence of activity on an Ethereum account. To have activity, you need to pay transaction fees, so there\u2019s a cost. You can make a few hundred fake accounts if you can pay a cost, but you can\u2019t make a million of them.\n\nSecond, you can look at POAPs [proof-of-attendance protocols] that verify that you participated in various in-person or online events.\n\nThird, there are proof-of-personhood protocols, and there is proof of humanity like Worldcoin. There\u2019s a Gitcoin passport that aggregates a lot of those. The ideal goal here is to do this in a way that lets people prove that they are people and not bots, but is also compatible with the goal of preserving people\u2019s privacy.\n\nLast year, you experienced the milestone of transitioning Ethereum from proof of work to proof of stake. What are you focused on now, and then what\u2019s next?\n\nAccount abstraction is definitely a big and important one. Another thing is obviously scalability. We have EIP-4844, also known as Proto-Danksharding, which is coming out very soon, which basically adds more data space on the blockchain\u2014not transactions, but just blobs of data. The purpose of this is to enable greater scalability, specifically for layer-2 projects, our rollups.\n\nThen after EIP-4844 there is a longer-term road map of increasing that amount of space over time and then ongoing improvements to proof of stake in identifying ways that we can improve decentralization even further.\n\nWe talked a year ago about AI, the intersection of AI and blockchain, before the release of ChatGPT and all the hype around that. What are your current views on the AI industry?\n\nAI is obviously super important. It\u2019s the sort of thing that\u2019s hard to think about because it\u2019s so hard to predict where it might go in the future. It\u2019s massive gains in productivity, but also massive philosophical consequences just in terms of what the role of humans in this new world is going to be. The world that is controlled by AI has completely different goals from us in a way that\u2019s difficult to detect at first\u2014that could also lead to very bad things happening.\n\nIn terms of the intersection between AI and crypto, this is one of those things where people have tried really hard to find an answer. Unfortunately, part of the answer is just that the intersection is less than it seems. There are a few things like ZK ML [zero-knowledge machine learning], but it\u2019s realistically a pretty small area.\n\nThere is the fact that AI\u2019s rapid growth makes it much more important to solve certain problems, like proof of personhood, for example. Then there\u2019s obviously the possibility of just crypto tokens being used by AIs. There is the possibility of crypto-based DAOs governing AIs and the process of training AIs.\n\nHave you read any books in the last year that have inspired you?\n\nIn the last year, I have definitely done less books and more reading blogs and things on the internet, things like podcasts and even science fiction. Maybe 10 years ago I read a lot of Austrian economics literature and things like Human Action: A Treatise on Economics, but also things like The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress, a novel by Robert A. Heinlein about a society that creates a civilization on the moon and tries to gain independence.\n\nMuch more recently, I watched some of The Three-Body Problem\u2014I read part of the novel and I also watched part of the TV series, and I was fascinated by that because it presents its world view in a way that is totally different from things that we\u2019re used to. There are aspects to the world view that I disagree with. There\u2019s always this mentality that the world is super dangerous and basically the five big countries have to get together and figure things out, and no one else gets a seat at the table.\n\nThat\u2019s not the kind of world that I want, and not the kind of mentality that I want to see get bigger. But there is this aspect of appreciating the vastness of the universe and how lucky humanity is to have been born\u2014and how significant and how small we are at the same time.\n\nAre there people you admire, who inspire you?\n\nA lot of people. Akira Fuyuno has a blog called Samurai Novelist. It\u2019s not a book, but his posts are so long, they\u2019re basically like the equivalent of reading 10 books. He just does a very good job of making really important philosophical concepts understandable and talking about just all kinds of things in science and politics in deep ways. Other people have told me that my writing style is inspired by his.\n\nI kind of have to say Volodymyr Zelensky. I appreciate his soft-power leadership and his ability to be a figure who rallies and inspires people in that way\u2014like, not just giving out the orders, but just being the face and rallying people behind the cause.\n\nThen there are Eliezer Yudkowsky and Scott Alexander\u2014the two of them are kind of similar characters in a lot of ways. Also, within the Ethereum community, Justin Drake, Dankrad Feist, and Aya Miyaguchi, the foundation\u2019s executive director, who\u2019s really pushed the philosophy of subtraction\u2014different people who have stepped up and made a piece of Ethereum their own and put their souls into making that piece as great as possible.\n\nYou\u2019ve also mentioned Steve Wozniak. Can you tell us more about meeting him? And maybe a few other people who\u2019ve impressed you?\n\nSteve Wozniak, he was just a genuinely fascinating guy who had really interesting hobbies and a lot of cool things that he was able to tell me about.\n\nFrom the government, Audrey Tang, Taiwan\u2019s digital minister, she had all kinds of interesting ideas of her own. She has her own history of being involved in Taiwan\u2019s democracy movement and then g0v [gov zero], which is trying to create a more democratic e-government infrastructure in Taiwan.\n\nThe likely new prime minister of Montenegro, Milojko Spaji\u0107, a.k.a. Mickey, I\u2019ve met him and I\u2019m also impressed by him. From what I can tell, it\u2019s his dedication to making the country better and also just being a curious person who was willing to talk to me and willing to learn things about crypto.\n\nDo you use ChatGPT or any other AI tools?\n\nI\u2019ve used ChatGPT. I\u2019ve also used the Stability AI chat. I use that for a few things. One is asking specific questions that I want answers for; another one is for writing code. I find that the thing that ChatGPT is best at is writing code that uses APIs or libraries or tools that you did not really know about. It even sometimes can take natural language tasks and convert them.\n\nAlso, for a translation, ChatGPT often does better than even Google Translate for helping to learn languages. If I want to understand the grammar behind a particular sentence, it does a really good job of doing that. The things that it\u2019s less good at are basically things where there aren\u2019t many millions of examples to learn from.\n\nI use either Stable Diffusion or the various other AI drawing things to draw images. I use those images and things in, like, my posts and my slides quite a bit. That has been it so far, but I\u2019m sure as AI gets better, I\u2019ll use it in other places as well.\n\nIt definitely does increase my productivity by quite a bit.\n\nWhat\u2019s your biggest dream?\n\nThat\u2019s a good question. I feel like I\u2019m not the sort of person to have one dream. I\u2019m the sort of person to have a lot of dreams. I dream of a world where I can be more free and more open, and where the tools that we\u2019re building in the crypto space can be a big part of actually making that happen. I have a dream of humanity as a whole really succeeding and ending disease and becoming a multiple-energy-area civilization.\n\nSpeaking of civilization, do you think in the future we can travel between planets? And would you take that ride to space?\n\nI think we\u2019ll absolutely get there. I will not be the first one to go\u2014I might be the hundredth person to go. Before we\u2019re really ready to do space, we need to get better at doing Antarctica first. I think of Antarctica as being the tutorial ground of going into space, because it\u2019s an environment that\u2019s definitely somewhat harsh and you have zero infrastructure, but you still can breathe the air without wearing a helmet. Start with the simpler things. But I would definitely love to actually be a part of that myself at some point over the next few decades."

        "title": "Wake: New Open-Source Tooling on Ethereum to Stop Bugs - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Wake\n\nPrague, Czech Republic, Nov. 28, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Quicktake:\n\n\n\nWake is a Python-based Solidity development and testing framework with built-in vulnerability detectors. It was used in audits by Ackee Blockchain and is now being open-sourced and free to use for everyone.\n\nSecurity experts are on high alert, as history shows that hack risks increase as market activity rises. Open-source tooling like Wake empowers application builders to conduct swift and thorough checks for code vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\nBattlefield-proven audit tooling goes open-source\n\nAckee Blockchain, a team of smart contract auditors and creators of community tools, introduces Wake, a Python-based development and testing framework for Solidity and cross-chain fuzzing with a proven track record of stopping bugs.\n\nWake\u2019s features include a development and testing framework, a fuzzer, vulnerability detectors, and printers.\n\nWake was previously used in smart contract audits performed by Ackee Blockchain for IPOR, Axelar, and Solady and helped the auditors find critical, high, and medium bugs. The firm has announced it will make the tool open-source to contribute to a safer blockchain space.\n\n\n\nSecurity experts on alert as market activity rises\n\nAs DeFi activity rises, hackers see more lucrative targets and grow emboldened. In bull markets, projects often rush to ship product updates, creating a high demand for experienced smart contract auditor services. In the peak of the 2021 bull market, projects were typically quoted three month+ audit wait times by reputable firms. They then face a difficult decision to delay launches amid frenzied \u201cland grabs\u201d or launch with hastily conducted audits, increasing security risks.\n\nAfter a week when crypto funds saw their highest inflows since the 2021 bull market and DeFi volumes rose by approximately 50%, security experts are on higher alert. Wake\u2019s release is timely - it allows application developers to expertly test the smart contracts of DEXs or any protocol that plugs into their service or upon which they are reliant.\n\n\n\nStory continues\n\nDesigned to generate fewer false positives and reduce manual audit time\n\nOn top of being the testing framework, Wake allows users to run static analysis. It has a set of ready-to-use high-precision vulnerability and code quality detectors and ready-to-use printers for extracting and pretty-printing useful information such as smart contract control flow and inheritance graphs.\n\n\u201cA common problem of static analysis tools is a high false-positives ratio requiring extra manual investigation time. Our philosophy is to include only the most precise detectors and reduce all noise that creates extra overhead,\u201d - Josef Gattermayer, CEO and co-founder of Ackee Blockchain.\n\nWake underwent performance testing with other frameworks, namely Hardhat, Brownie, and Ape, on three different development chains \u2013 Anvil, Ganache, and Hardhat. Wake proved to be the fastest Python framework.\n\nThe new release of Wake allows the customization of detectors and printers. It also allows third parties to create and implement their custom printers and detectors. The newest version also introduced Github action for automatically executing detectors in a pipeline. \u201cThe low false-positive rate, fastest industry test execution, and ready-made GitHub action make Wake an ideal candidate for CI/CD integration in every project\u201d - Josef Gattermayer, CEO and co-founder of Ackee Blockchain.\n\nWake powers Tools for Solidity, a popular Visual Studio Code Solidity extension that does syntax highlighting and detections from Wake vulnerability and code quality detectors and provides instant feedback to the developers using the extension access to all references of a symbol across the whole project.\n\n\n\nAbout Wake\n\nWake is a Python-based development and testing framework for Solidity and cross-chain fuzzing with a proven track record of stopping bugs created by Ackee Blockchain, which became possible thanks to a grant Ackee Blockchain received from Coinbase in 2022.\n\nTo learn more, please visit getwake.io.\n\nWebsite | Twitter | Telegram\n\n\n\nAbout Ackee Blockchain\n\nAckee Blockchain is a team of security researchers auditing top-tier protocols: Safe, 1inch, Axelar, LayerZero, Trader Joe, or CoW Protocol.\n\nAckee Blockchain is backed by the largest VC fund focused on blockchain and DeFi in Europe, RockawayX, and received grants from the Ethereum Foundation, Tezos Foundation, Coinbase, and Solana Foundation.\n\nAckee Blockchain\u2019s mission is to build a stronger blockchain community by sharing knowledge: the team runs a free certification course School of Solidity, School of Solana and teaches at the Czech Technical University in Prague. This mission is also fulfilled in initiatives such as the ERC-7512 draft, developing the Wake toolkit, or the open-source fuzzer for Solana.\n\nWebsite | Twitter\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: The information provided in this press release is not a solicitation for investment, or intended as investment advice, financial advice, or trading advice.

        "title": "Vitalik Buterin's 'Defensive Accelerationism' Fits Squarely Into the Ethos of Ethereum - Unchained - Unchained",
        "content": "In a new essay, Ethereum\u2019s creator splits the difference between \u201cEffective Altruism\u201d and \u201cEffective Accelerationism\u201d with a reiteration of crypto principles of both independence and democracy.\n\nFor a crypto veteran like me, the bull market between 2020 and 2022 was most notable for what was missing: Vitalik Buterin. The thoughtful, unassuming creator and intellectual figurehead of the Ethereum ecosystem was largely pushed out of headlines by bombastic, performative (and fraudulent) caricatures like Do Kwon and Sam Bankman-Fried.\n\nBut with such charlatans and their allies now discredited well beyond crypto circles, Buterin is back in a big way with a lengthy essay he published on Monday entitled \u201cMy techno-optimism.\u201d Though the message is broad, it arrives as a specific response to the recent public rift at OpenAI. That fight was broadly driven by a split between \u201cEffective Altruists,\u201d or EAs \u2013 the group Sam Bankman-Fried allied with and helped fund \u2013 and \u201cEffective Accelerationists,\u201d or (e/acc), a far more free-market oriented faction that includes people like Marc Andreessen.\n\nIn the recent OpenAI leadership fight, the EAs seemingly took the role of techno-pessimists, trying to slow the spread of AI tools, while the \u201ce/acc\u201d faction backed Sam Altman\u2019s focus on growth. But Buterin sees both sides as having \u201cfar too many plans to save the world that involve giving a small group of people extreme and opaque power and hoping that they use it wisely.\u201d As I\u2019ve written elsewhere, the two factions are branches of the same underlying Silicon Valley ideology, and both have deep conceptual flaws that ultimately sum out to authoritarianism.\n\nButerin\u2019s response appears in many ways far more nuanced than the positions he is reacting to. He calls it \u201cd/acc,\u201d or \u201cdefensive accelerationism.\u201d\n\nWhat is Defensive Accelerationism?\n\nButerin\u2019s counterpoint leans most of all on decentralization and democratic decision-making in the management of human progress. Buterin says that \u201cThe \u2018d\u2019 stands for \u2018defensive acceleration,\u2019 or perhaps decentralized, or differential acceleration.\u201d It could just as easily, based on Buterin\u2019s ideas, stand for \u201cdemocratic accelerationism.\u201d\n\nVitalik argues that those various Ds are linked. A society that develops in a \u201cdefensive\u201d way is a more just and fair one, because its decentralization discourages attacking others, in turn leaving democracy free to flourish \u2013 at the local or small-group level specifically. He uses the example of Switzerland, whose mountainous terrain historically helped it maintain a more horizontal and localized system of political power, since the various sub-national polities can\u2019t easily attack each other, or be attacked.\n\nIn more contemporary technological terms, Buterin specifically emphasizes privacy and autonomy, as well as cybersecurity and \u201cinfosecurity\u201d as key principles of development on \u201cd/acc\u201d lines. He fully endorses \u201ca security-focused open-source movement, rather than closed and proprietary corporations and venture capital funds.\u201d This seems a specific knock on the EAs, who have been resistant to making AI tech more accessible.\n\nOn a related note, Buterin seems viscerally repulsed by the \u201centhusiasm for military technology\u201d among the effective accelerationist crowd. On this point, he accuses the e/accs of making the same egotistical mistake as the EAs: Supporting the advancement of military tech, Buterin writes, requires \u201cbelieving that the dominant technological power will reliably be one of the good guys in most conflicts, now and in the future.\u201d\n\nThe essay also explores other important topics, like pandemic preparedness, and lays out decentralized approaches. At a very high level, Buterin praises systems like prediction markets and X/Twitter\u2019s \u201ccommunity notes\u201d feature, specifically because they\u2019re structured to usefully integrate feedback from any member of the public. No surprise, Buterin also emphasizes the value of blockchains and cryptocurrency in his notion of digital \u201cdefensive infrastructure,\u201d for instance for their ability to prevent centralized \u201cchokepoints\u201d for data.\n\nButerin\u2019s \u201cD\u201d does not, crucially, stand for \u201cdeceleration.\u201d He opens the essay with a strong argument for technological progress as a boon to human well-being, and explicitly connects that to the beneficial potential of artificial intelligence. And though he also accepts the risk of superintelligence dominating human life, he thankfully gives short shrift to the sci-fi fantasies of destructive AI that seem to haunt the Effective Altruists and their \u201cAI Doomer\u201d allies. He\u2019s far more concerned with the realistic, here-and-now threat of AI turning humans into passive \u201cpets,\u201d simply because the AIs will make objectively better decisions.\n\nA \u2018Subspecies of e/acc\u2019\n\nBut even given such risks, Buterin rejects the idea that any small group \u2013 like the OpenAI board \u2013 should control technological progress. Notably, this echoes close to a decade of Buterin\u2019s own proactive efforts to reduce his own power over Ethereum. He rightly identifies reliance on central authority as an implicit element of contemporary Effective Altruism, and generally he seems to have the least affection for that set of ideas.\n\nButerin is more clearly allied with the \u201ceffective accelerationists,\u201d and calls d/acc \u201ca subspecies of e/acc \u2013 just one that is much more selective and intentional.\u201d But he rightly pushes back against their most extremist tendency, too \u2013 their belief that unstructured \u201cfree markets\u201d in themselves lead to human progress. Buterin\u2019s objections here include the uncontroversial fact that \u201cmany markets have proven to be natural monopolies.\u201d Following the e/acc free-market doctrine, he writes, seems likely to lead to a monopoly on artificial intelligence specifically, with disastrous implications for human freedom and flourishing.\n\nThere\u2019s much more breadth and subtlety to Buterin\u2019s dense disquisition \u2013 for instance, he includes transhumanist ideas like brain-computer interfaces in his idea of \u201cdefensive\u201d technological development. But it\u2019s not hard to see \u201cd/acc\u201d as a rebranding of the left-wing libertarianism that has come to define the political ethos of the Ethereum community. Buterin\u2019s pitch also reflects the same basic optimism and openness that defines the actually-existing Ethereum community today.\n\n\u201cI believe humanity is deeply good,\u201d Vitalik writes in closing. \u201cYes, human beings are often mean, but we much more often show kindness and mercy, and work together for our common benefit.\u201d\n\n\u201cTwo billion years from now, if the Earth or any part of the universe still bears the beauty of Earthly life, it will be human artifices like space travel and geoengineering that will have made it happen,\u201d Buterin continues.\n\n\u201cWe need to build, and accelerate.\u201d"

ETH formed a high at $2,132 and started a downward movement. There was a move below the $2,100 and $2,080 levels, like Bitcoin.\n\nThe price even spiked below the $2,000 support. A low was formed near $1,986 and the price is now consolidating losses. There was a minor recovery wave above the $2,020 level. Ether climbed above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent drop from the $2,132 swing high to the $1,986 low.\n\nEthereum is now trading below $2,060 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.

A notable increase in validators exiting the Ethereum staking pool since October has contributed to a slowdown in the growth rate of ETH issuance. This trend correlates with the broader bullish sentiment across digital asset markets.\n\nThe growth rate of the #Ethereum validator set has slowed in recent weeks as an increasing number of validators voluntarily exit, slowing the rate of ETH issuance.\n\n\n\nAlongside increasing ETH burnt via EIP1559 due to growing network activity, the ETH supply has turned\u2026 pic.twitter.com/xMrQRe7opO \u2014 glassnode (@glassnode) November 28, 2023\n\nYou might also like: Spain enforces new crypto tax law for foreign asset declarations\n\nThe decreased validator participation leads to reduced ETH issuance, which, when combined with heightened network activity, results in increased ETH burn via EIP1559\u200b\u200b. Concurrently, a decline in NFT and defi transactions has been observed, with decreases of 3% and 57%, respectively, over the past four months.\n\nIn contrast, token transfers and stablecoins have seen a surge, with gas usage for tokens rising by 8.2% and stablecoin gas usage increasing by 19%.

Discover SCENE\n\nOn Monday, Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin reflected on his own take on \u201ctechno-optimism,\u201d inspired by Marc Andreessen, who opined about AI in his Techno-Optimist Manifesto in October. While Buterin agreed with Andreessen\u2019s positive outlook, Buterin also noted the importance of how AI is developed and the technology's future direction.\n\nButerin acknowledged the existential risk of artificial intelligence, including causing the extinction of the human race.\n\n\u201cThis is an extreme claim: as much harm as the worst-case scenario of climate change, or an artificial pandemic or a nuclear war, might cause, there are many islands of civilization that would remain intact to pick up the pieces,\u201d he said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cBut a superintelligent AI, if it decides to turn against us, may well leave no survivors and end humanity for good,\u201d Buterin said. \u201cEven Mars may not be safe.\u201d\n\nButerin pointed to a 2022 survey by AI Impacts, which said between 5% and 10% of participants believe humans face extinction from AI or from humans' failure to control AI, respectively. He said that a security-focused open-source movement is ideal for leading AI development rather than closed and proprietary corporations and venture capital funds.\n\n\u201cIf we want a future that is both superintelligent and \"human\u2014one where human beings are not just pets, but actually retain meaningful agency over the world\u2014then it feels like something like this is the most natural option,\" he said.\n\nWhat\u2019s needed, Buterin continued, is the active human intention to choose its direction and outcome. \u201cThe formula of 'maximize profit' will not arrive at them automatically,\u201d he said.\n\nButerin said he loves technology because it expands human potential, pointing to the history of innovations from hand tools to smartphones.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI believe that these things are deeply good, and that expanding humanity's reach even further to the planets and stars is deeply good, because I believe humanity is deeply good,\u201d Buterin said.\n\nButerin said that while he believes transformative technology will lead to a brighter future for humanity, he rejects the notion that the world should stay how it is today, only with less greed and more public healthcare.\n\n\u201cThere are certain types of technology that much more reliably make the world better than other types of technology,\u201d Buterin said. \u201cThere are certain types of technology that could, if developed, mitigate the negative impacts of other types of technology.\u201d\n\nButerin cautioned about a rise in digital authoritarianism and surveillance technology used against those who defy or dissent against the government, controlled by a small cabal of technocrats. He said the majority of people would rather see highly advanced AI delayed by a decade rather than be monopolized by a single group.\n\n\u201cMy basic fear is that the same kinds of managerial technologies that allow OpenAI to serve over a hundred million customers with 500 employees will also allow a 500-person political elite, or even a 5-person board, to maintain an iron fist over an entire country,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile Buterin said he is sympathetic to the effective acceleration (also known as \"e/acc\") movement, he has mixed feelings about its enthusiasm for military technology.\n\n\u201cEnthusiasm about modern military technology as a force for good seems to require believing that the dominant technological power will reliably be one of the good guys in most conflicts, now and in the future,\u201d he said, citing the idea that military technology is good because it's being built and controlled by America and America is good.\n\n\u201cDoes being an e/acc require being an America maximalist, betting everything on both the government's present and future morals and the country's future success?\u201d he said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nButerin cautioned against giving \u201cextreme and opaque power\u201d to a small group of people with the hope they will use it wisely, preferring instead a philosophy of \"d/acc\"\u2014or defense, decentralization, democracy, and differential. This mindset, he said, could adapt to effective altruists, libertarians, pluralists, blockchain advocates, and solar and lunar punks.\n\n\u201cA defense-favoring world is a better world, for many reasons,\u201d Buterin said. \u201cFirst of course is the direct benefit of safety: fewer people die, less economic value gets destroyed, less time is wasted on conflict.\n\n\"What is less appreciated though is that a defense-favoring world makes it easier for healthier, more open and more freedom-respecting forms of governance to thrive,\" he concluded.\n\nWhile he emphasized the need to build and accelerate, Buterin said society should regularly ask what we are accelerating towards. Buterin suggested that the 21st century may be \"the pivotal century\" for humanity that could decide the fate of humanity for millennia.\n\n\u201cThese are challenging problems,\u201d Buterin said. \u201cBut I look forward to watching and participating in our species' grand collective effort to find the answers.\u201d\n\nEdited by Ryan Ozawa."

Forbes planned to raise $600 million, including $200 million in cash from Magnum Opus. Notably, the other $400 million was to come from the private placement of company shares.\n\nHowever, Forbes abandoned plans for an IPO last June. The company reportedly pulled the plug because investor appetite and general enthusiasm for blank-cheque vehicles were not satisfactory. Interest in IPOs launched via SPACs waned for several reasons. A major problem was the increased scrutiny from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)."

Understanding the values of clean and efficient code is essential when working on any software development project. Additionally, developers who can effectively communicate and collaborate with others are highly sought after in the job market. By signing a contract, developers can ensure that their work is protected and that they are compensated fairly for their efforts.\n\nFundamental Concepts in Solidity\n\nVariables, Data Types, and Control Structures\n\nVariables, data types, control structures, values, and functions are foundational elements of programming in Solidity. In Solidity, variables are used to store and manipulate data values. These variables can be declared within a contract, which is a stateful entity that contains functions for interacting with the data. In code, variables are declared with specific data types such as integers, strings, or booleans. For example, you can declare a variable to store bytes. These variables can then be assigned values and used throughout the program in the context of a course. For example, code functions can utilize these variables.\n\nControl structures in Solidity programs allow developers to control the flow of execution using code, functions, and contracts. These control structures help manage the state of the program. Conditional statements like if-else statements are a common example of functions in code. They help make decisions based on certain types of conditions. For example, loops such as for loops or while loops use variables and functions to enable repetitive execution of a block of code until a specified condition is met.\n\nFunctions: Executing Actions within Smart Contracts\n\nFunctions are essential in executing actions within smart contracts written in Solidity code. They help manage the state of the contract by manipulating variables. For example, a function can update the value of a variable in a smart contract. Code functions are examples of types of code that encapsulate a set of instructions. These instructions define how specific tasks or operations should be performed. Functions can use parameters to receive inputs in the form of variables, for example, data, when they are called.\n\nSolidity functions in a contract can also return variable data, providing outputs after executing the code logic. This allows for the use of data functions to retrieve computed results or information values from the smart contract.\n\nEvents, Modifiers, and Inheritance: Efficiency and Reusability\n\nUnderstanding events, modifiers, inheritance, functions, constructor, and contract helps developers write efficient and reusable code in Solidity.\n\nEvents are functions in smart contracts that emit signals when certain conditions occur, allowing them to communicate with external entities. This communication is done through the emission of data types in the code. They serve as a means for logging important data that can be observed by external applications or other smart contracts on the Ethereum network. These functions are written in code and can handle different types of information.\n\nModifiers in code enable developers to incorporate additional checks or conditions before executing specific functions within their smart contracts. These modifiers are particularly useful for ensuring the proper handling of different data types and constructor functions. By applying modifiers to code functions, developers can ensure that only authorized users or specific conditions in the data are met before allowing access to particular functionality. This can be achieved by using the constructor function and implementing a contract.\n\nInheritance enables code reuse by allowing one contract (the child contract) to inherit properties and functionalities from another contract (the parent contract). This is done through the use of constructors, functions, and types, which allow the child contract to access and utilize the data and functionality of the parent contract. This promotes modularity and reduces redundancy in code by using functions and constructors, making it easier to maintain and upgrade smart contracts. The functions handle the data and the constructors initialize the value.\n\nBy understanding the functions, data, and constructor in Solidity code, developers can efficiently build robust smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. With variables, functions, data types, constructor, and control structures, they have the tools to store, manipulate, and assign value to data effectively in code. Functions empower them to execute code actions within their smart contracts while events, modifiers, and inheritance enhance efficiency and reusability of data and type.\n\nDiving into Solidity\u2019s Data Structures\n\nArrays: Storing and Manipulating Data Collections\n\nArrays in Solidity provide a convenient way to store and manipulate collections of data within Smart Contracts. They are used to define functions and constructor code that handle and return values. Arrays are useful data structures in programming that can store a variety of values, such as addresses, integers, or custom data types. They are commonly used in code to create functions and define the value of variables within a contract. For example, you can create an array to store a list of names or a collection of transaction details in your code. This data can be organized and accessed using functions. Additionally, you can use contracts to define the behavior and requirements for working with this data.\n\nTo declare an array in a Solidity contract, you specify the data type followed by square brackets [] in the code constructor functions. You can also define the size and value of the data array if you want it to have a fixed length. This can be done using code and functions. However, if you don\u2019t know the exact size of the code, data, or type beforehand or want it to be dynamic, you can omit the size declaration and use a dynamic value.\n\nArrays in Solidity are zero-indexed, meaning the first element in the data constructor is at index 0 in the code contract. You can access individual elements using their respective indices. Arrays are a fundamental data structure in programming. They support various operations such as appending new elements, updating existing values, and iterating over all elements. These operations can be achieved using functions and code. Additionally, arrays can be manipulated using constructors to create new instances or modify existing ones.\n\nStructs: Custom Data Structures with Multiple Properties\n\nIn Solidity, structs are used in the contract code to define custom data structures with multiple properties. Developers can use the constructor function to initialize these structs. They are similar to classes or objects in other programming languages, but with the addition of code, constructor, data, and type. By using a constructor function, you can organize related data variables together and assign them a specific name in your code.\n\nFor instance, let\u2019s say you want to represent a person\u2019s data in your Smart Contract. You can do this by using code that includes a constructor to assign a value to the person\u2019s information. You can define a struct called \u201cPerson\u201d with properties like name (string), age (uint), and address (address) in a contract. The struct can be created using a constructor function to initialize the data. This way, you have a structured way of storing and accessing person-related data within your contract using the constructor function to define the value and type.\n\nStructs enable code reusability as well. Once the constructor is defined, you can create multiple instances of that struct throughout your contract or even across different contracts. This allows you to work with different sets of data and values using the function.\n\nMaps: Efficient Storage and Retrieval of Key-Value Pairs\n\nMaps are a type of data structure in Solidity that serve as a function for efficient storage and retrieval of key-value pairs within Smart Contracts. They are constructed using a constructor and are essential for managing data in Solidity. They are similar to dictionaries or hash maps, which are data structures used in other programming languages. With maps, you can associate data with a specific key and quickly retrieve that data based on the given key. Maps are a function-like constructor that allows you to store and access data based on a key-value contract.\n\nTo declare a map in Solidity, you specify the data type for both the key and value in the contract\u2019s constructor function. For example, you can create a data map where the keys are addresses and the values are integers representing token balances using a function. Additionally, you can define a contract with a constructor to initialize the map.\n\nMaps are a data type that offer fast lookups, making them ideal for scenarios where you need to access values based on specific keys. They function as a contract between keys and values, efficiently organizing and retrieving data.\n\nMastering Smart Contract Development in Solidity\n\nWriting Secure Smart Contracts\n\nWriting secure smart contracts involves implementing proper error handling mechanisms in the function and constructor to ensure the safety of data and type. By incorporating error handling, developers can anticipate and handle potential issues that may arise during the execution of a smart contract constructor function. This ensures that the data and types are properly handled, enhancing the overall functionality and reliability of the smart contract. This function ensures that the constructor operates smoothly by reducing the risk of vulnerabilities or exploits in the data value.\n\nOne approach to implementing error handling in Solidity is through the use of exception handling. This can be achieved by adding a constructor function to the contract that handles any errors that may occur during the execution of the contract\u2019s functions and data operations. With exception handling, developers can define specific conditions under which an exception should be thrown in a function or constructor, allowing for graceful error recovery or termination of contract execution for various data types. By carefully considering potential errors and implementing appropriate exception handling, developers can enhance the security and reliability of their smart contracts. This can be achieved by analyzing and validating the data, using constructors to initialize objects, defining functions to perform specific tasks, and specifying the type of variables to ensure proper data handling.\n\nImplementing Access Control Mechanisms\n\nImplementing access control mechanisms is crucial to ensure that only authorized users can interact with smart contracts. One way to achieve this is by using a constructor function that validates the data provided by users. Access control helps prevent unauthorized individuals from modifying or accessing sensitive data within a contract using the constructor function.\n\nOne common method for access control in Solidity is using modifiers in the contract. Modifiers are functions that can be applied to other functions in order to modify their behavior. They are typically defined in the constructor of the contract and can be used to restrict access to certain data or functions within the contract. Constructors in contracts allow developers to specify conditions that must be met before executing a certain function within the data. Modifiers are used to define these conditions. By applying modifiers to constructor functions, developers can restrict access to data based on user roles or permissions defined in the contract.\n\nAnother approach to managing access control within a contract is by utilizing role-based access control (RBAC). RBAC defines different roles within the contract and assigns them specific permissions. This can be achieved through the use of data, constructors, and functions. This function allows for fine-grained control over who can perform certain actions within the data constructor.\n\nBy implementing robust access control mechanisms, developers can safeguard their smart contracts against unauthorized data access or misuse. The use of constructors and functions can further enhance the security of these contracts.\n\nInteracting with External Contracts\n\nInteracting with external contracts through function calls enables complex interactions between different parts of the Ethereum ecosystem, allowing for the exchange of data and constructor initialization. This capability allows smart contracts to communicate with other contracts on the Ethereum blockchain, facilitating interoperability and enabling more sophisticated functionalities by exchanging data and utilizing the constructor.\n\nDevelopers can utilize the constructor to interact with existing ERC20 tokens or invoke data functions from other deployed contracts. This opens up possibilities for integrating various data decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols into their own smart contracts or leveraging functionalities provided by other constructor contracts.\n\nBy leveraging the power of external contract interactions, developers can enhance the capabilities and utility of their smart contracts by incorporating additional functions and data. This enables them to build more robust and interconnected applications on the Ethereum blockchain using the constructor.\n\nAdvanced Solidity Features and Best Practices\n\nUsing Libraries for Code Reusability\n\nLibraries are a powerful feature in Solidity that allow developers to reuse code across multiple projects, reducing redundancy and improving efficiency. They can be used to define and implement reusable functions and contracts, which can be accessed and utilized by other contracts. This helps in organizing and managing the data and logic within a smart contract. Additionally, libraries can be instantiated through constructors, allowing for customization and flexibility in their usage. By creating a library contract with a constructor, developers can define functions and data structures that can be used by other contracts. This promotes code modularity and makes it easier to maintain and update smart contracts by using the function, constructor, and data.\n\nGas Optimization Techniques for Cost Efficiency\n\nGas optimization is crucial. Gas refers to the cost associated with performing computational tasks on the blockchain data. In a smart contract, a function or constructor may require gas to execute. By utilizing gas optimization techniques, developers can minimize transaction costs and improve the overall efficiency of their smart contracts. These techniques involve optimizing the data, function, and constructor of the contracts.\n\nOne technique to optimize the contract is to avoid unnecessary computations or storage operations within the data function or constructor. For example, when writing a contract function or constructor, using uint8 instead of uint256 when possible can save gas as it requires less storage space for data. Using modifiers in a contract\u2019s function or constructor can reduce gas consumption by avoiding the repetition of code blocks and optimizing data handling.\n\nAnother technique is to use mappings instead of arrays when dealing with large datasets in the context of a function, contract, or constructor. Mappings are a data structure in Solidity that offer constant-time lookup, insertion, and deletion operations. This is unlike arrays, which require iterating through all elements, resulting in higher gas costs. Mappings are commonly used in smart contracts to efficiently store and retrieve data. When defining a mapping, a constructor function is often used to set initial values.\n\nFollowing Best Practices for Code Quality\n\nTo ensure code quality and maintainability, it is essential to follow best practices when developing smart contracts in Solidity. One of these practices is to define a constructor function that initializes the data of the contract. This constructor function is called automatically when the contract is deployed on the blockchain. By properly defining and using the constructor function, developers can ensure that the contract is initialized correctly and ready to perform its intended functions. One such practice is thorough code commenting. By providing clear comments throughout the codebase, developers ensure that the constructor, data, and contract are easily comprehensible to themselves and others. This improves understanding of the functionality and purpose of each section of code.\n\nTesting is another crucial aspect of solid contract development. Writing comprehensive unit tests helps identify bugs or vulnerabilities early on in the development process. These tests ensure that the function, constructor, and data in the code are working correctly and adhering to the contract. Tools like Truffle provide frameworks for writing automated tests that simulate various scenarios and edge cases for contract functions, constructors, and data.\n\nDocumentation also plays a vital role in maintaining well-structured and understandable codebases, especially when it comes to data, function, constructor, and contract. Documenting functions, variables, events, contract interactions, constructor, and data helps other developers easily navigate through the project.\n\nBy adhering to these best practices, developers can enhance the quality of their code by implementing data contracts and constructors, reducing the likelihood of bugs or vulnerabilities, and making it easier for others to collaborate on and understand their projects through well-documented functions.\n\nLearning Resources for Solidity Development\n\nTutorials, Online Courses, and Documentation\n\nTo learn Solidity, there are valuable resources provided by the Ethereum Foundation, including information on contract data, functions, and constructors. Their tutorials, online courses, and documentation offer a comprehensive learning experience for understanding data constructors, contracts, and functions. These resources cover everything from the basics of Solidity to more advanced topics related to contract, data, constructor, and function.

By using the constructor in their smart contract, developers can effectively prevent common vulnerabilities such as reentrancy attacks. Input validation in a smart contract involves verifying that the data entered into the constructor meets certain criteria or constraints. The constructor helps to ensure that only valid and expected inputs are accepted, reducing the risk of malicious actors exploiting vulnerabilities in the contract.\n\nSanitization, on the other hand, involves removing any potentially harmful or malicious content from user inputs before they are processed by the smart contract\u2019s constructor. This process, which includes the use of a constructor and adhering to a contract, helps to mitigate risks associated with code injection attacks or unexpected behavior caused by malformed inputs.\n\nUsing Secure Coding Practices\n\nAnother important aspect of safeguarding smart contracts is adopting secure coding practices, which includes implementing a secure constructor. Developers should avoid using deprecated functions and libraries in their code as they may have known vulnerabilities. It is important to carefully review the constructor and contract of any functions or libraries being used to ensure that they are up-to-date and secure. Instead, developers should choose up-to-date libraries that provide enhanced security features for their contract constructors.\n\nDevelopers should follow best practices when writing their smart contract code, including properly implementing the constructor. This includes properly handling exceptions in the constructor, avoiding unnecessary complexity in code logic in the contract, and ensuring proper access control mechanisms are in place.\n\nBy adhering to these secure coding practices, developers can significantly reduce the potential risks associated with developing decentralized applications (DApps) on blockchain platforms. These practices include properly implementing contract and constructor functionalities.\n\nRegularly Auditing Smart Contracts\n\nEven after implementing input validation, sanitization techniques, secure coding practices, and regularly auditing smart contracts for potential vulnerabilities, it is essential to remember the importance of the constructor. The landscape of blockchain technology is constantly evolving, with new protocols being introduced and existing ones being updated. This includes the development of smart contracts and the implementation of contract constructors. As a result, previously secure contracts may become vulnerable over time due to the absence of a constructor.\n\nRegular audits help identify any weaknesses or flaws in the codebase of a contract constructor that could be exploited by attackers. These audits can be conducted internally by experienced developers or externally through third-party security firms specializing in blockchain audits. Additionally, these audits can also include a thorough examination of the smart contract\u2019s code and its constructor function.\n\nBy conducting regular audits throughout the development lifecycle of a smart contract, developers can ensure ongoing security and reliability. The constructor is an essential component in the development process. This proactive approach helps to identify and address vulnerabilities before they are exploited, safeguarding the integrity of the contract and protecting user funds. The use of the constructor in this approach is crucial to ensuring the effectiveness of this process.\n\nFollowing Blogs, Newsletters, and Social Media Accounts\n\nTo stay informed about the latest updates in Solidity, it is essential for developers to follow blogs, newsletters, and social media accounts dedicated to blockchain development.

        "content": "Cryptocurrency traders usually consider price the leading index for past analysis and future projections. However, tokenomics and supply inflation can drastically impact the price of any asset, and crypto investors can use the market cap as a demand index to evaluate these effects.\n\nIn this context, Finbold looked at Ethereum (ETH) tokenomics from a capitalization perspective. Public market data from cryptocurrency indexes can demonstrate the effects of increased supply inflation on Ethereum. We calculated the exact price ETH would trade if it ever hits the all-time high market cap.\n\nAn inflationary supply requires more demand to maintain its value over time. These two factors determine whether a cryptocurrency\u2019s price rises or falls. Ethereum, with its unique tokenomics design, is a prime example of this dynamic.\n\nEthereum had an all-time high market cap of $575.899 billion on November 10, 2021, according to TradingView\u2019s CRYPTOCAP index. Meanwhile, Ether traded for as high as $4,878 on the same day, as registered by Finbold. An inverse calculation suggests a circulating supply of around 118.06 million ETH at that time.\n\nCRYPTOCAP \u2013 ETH daily market capitalization. Source: TradingView\n\nEthereum supply inflation and its economic effects\n\nLet\u2019s explore Ether\u2019s supply inflation and its economic implications. Ethereum has a circulating supply of 118.619 million ETH as of the time of this writing. This results in a supply inflation of 559,000 ETH (0.5%) in two years.\n\nEthereum circulating supply data. Source: CoinMarketCap\n\nEssentially, the burning mechanism implemented in 2021 assisted in controlling the effective inflation caused by new Ethers issuance to reward staking validators.\n\nThe price projection also shows the effects of this tokenomics. In case the leading Web3 blockchain reaches its highest speculative demand of $575.899 billion market cap, ETH would trade at a proportionally lower price than the corresponding all-time high.\n\nConsidering the circulating supply on November 28, Ethereum would be priced at $4,855 per token at its highest capitalization. Interestingly, a loss of $23 (47%) from the previous price of $4,878 in 2021.\n\nHowever, this still indicates a potential 138% increase from the current price of $2,035.\n\nIt is important to understand that the forecast requires the same demand as 2021 for Ethereum. In this context, there are no guarantees that this demand will ever be seen again. On the other hand, it is also possible that a higher demand surges in the following years.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "title": "Ethereum price may lose $2,000 level as ETH becomes deflationary again due to validator exit - FXStreet",
        "content": "Share:\n\nEthereum price, trading at $2,038 on Tuesday, will likely fall below the crucial support level amid waning bullishness.\n\nETH validators, for the first time since Shapella's hard fork, have begun exiting to the tune of 1,018 per day.\n\nETH issuance has also taken a hit and, for the first time since December 2022, has recently had its growth rate decreased by 0.5% per day.\n\nEthereum price has been affected by the Shanghai hardfork since even before it was activated. But since the upgrade, this week marks the first instance when the market is witnessing the fear of unstaking come to life.\n\nEthereum price could take a bearish turn\n\nEthereum price has been hovering around the $2,000 mark since the beginning of the month. Trading at $2,038 at the time of writing, the second-generation cryptocurrency has failed to breach the resistance of $2,124 for the second time this month. While it did manage to break out of the downtrend over the past week, it is still vulnerable to a decline below the $2,000 support level.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a measure of the speed and change of price movement. According to the indicator, there is still room for ETH to bounce back and reinitiate bullish momentum, given it is sitting above the neutral line at 50.0. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator is also exhibiting the dominance of bearish momentum in the market presently, owing to the red bars on the histogram and the lack of a potential bullish crossover.\n\nThus, all the fingers point at a likely downtrend, which might see Ethereum price touching the lows of $1,900 or testing the support at $1,795.\n\nETH/USD 1-day chart\n\nBut if the broader market cues turn bullish and ETH bounces back from $2,000, it could make another attempt at breaching the resistance marked at $2,124. A rise through that level would invalidate the bearish thesis, opening ETH up to tagging $2,200.\n\nEthereum turns deflationary again\n\nThe chance of a bullish turn of events is both likely and unlikely. It's likely because ETH is deflationary once again. An asset being deflationary simply means that it no longer has an infinite supply but that it will reduce over time. This generally is a bullish event since low supply plus high demand equals a rise in price.\n\nBut the reason it could be unlikely in the case of Ethereum is that the conditions under which ETH is turning deflationary are unfavorable. According to blockchain analytics platform Glassnode, daily ETH issuance has experienced a slowdown. Over the last week, the growth rate of ETH issuance has slowed by up to 0.5% per day.\n\nEthereum daily issuance\n\nThis marks the first issuance decrease in nearly 12 months, and the reason behind it is the exit of validators. Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum runs on the Proof of Stake consensus method, which requires node/block validators to stake ETH in order to qualify. Earlier, this staked ETH could not be withdrawn, but that feature was activated after the Shapella upgrade.\n\nSince then, on average, 380 validators have exited on a daily basis. But this figure shot up by 168% in just a month, rising to 1,018 validators.\n\nEthereum validators\n\nConsequently, the staked ETH has also noted a decline. The possibility of the validator exit could be due to one or more of these three possible reasons:\n\nInvestors are opting to change their staking setup, for example, by transferring stakes from CEXs (centralized exchanges) to Liquid Staking Providers (perhaps due to ongoing regulatory concerns).\n\nInvestors with access to US capital markets may be rotating capital toward safer assets, such as US treasuries, as interest rates remain elevated relative to ETH staking returns.\n\nInvestors may also be seeking greater liquidity for held ETH in anticipation of an imminent market uptrend rather than less liquid-staked ETH.\n\nNevertheless, this is not a good sign for Ethereum as the validators are the backbone of the network, and their exit could prove to be rather negative."

        "content": "TL;DR\n\nEthereum (ETH) is showing strong performance, currently trading around $2,000, with predictions of reaching its all-time high of over $4,800.\n\nAnalyst FieryTrading forecasts ETH to reach nearly $5,000 by early 2025, citing a long-term bullish pattern.\n\nThe same analyst predicts a significant rise for Cardano\u2019s ADA, expecting it to exceed $35 by 2025 based on bullish market patterns.\n\n\u2018Big Gains for ETH\u2019 on the Horizon?\n\nEthereum\u2019s native cryptocurrency \u2013 Ether (ETH) \u2013 is another asset that has shown strong resilience following the devastating market crash in the second part of 2022. It currently trades at around $2,000 (per CoinGecko\u2019s data), a 70% price increase compared to the first day of the ongoing year.\n\nSome analysts believe the current condition is just the beginning of an uptrend that could eventually take ETH to its all-time high of over $4,800. Such an individual is the one using the TradingView handle FieryTrading.\n\nAccording to them, the coin has been in a bullish mode for the past year and a half, suggesting a further surge in the following months.\n\n\u201cAs seen on the chart, ETH has been trading inside a bullish triangle pattern for over 1.5 years. In my eyes, a break out from this pattern might result in big gains for ETH since it will burst through an area full of short-trade stop-losses, which will be forced to buy back their positions,\u201d the analyst argued.\n\nAccording to their analysis, Ether\u2019s jump toward almost $5,000 is expected at the beginning of 2025. \u201cWith a stop below the recent swing low and a target around the current ATH, we can construct a very decent long-term trade for this big token,\u201d FieryTrading concluded.\n\nThe Analyst\u2019s Take on ADA\n\nApart from predicting ETH\u2019s possible price trajectory, FieryTrading has also given their two cents on Cardano\u2019s native token \u2013 ADA.\n\nThey believe the asset is poised for an astonishing increase toward $35 in two years based on certain parallel channels that hint about the beginning of a bull run:\n\n\u201cSince the pattern has now been confirmed, we can take a look at the next bull-market top. Assuming that the bull-market top will be somewhere in 2025 and that ADA will continue to follow this pattern, we can make the assumption that ADA will top somewhere above $35.\u201d"

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nEffective accelerationism has gained a following among Silicon Valley bigshots.\n\nAdvocates, including Marc Andreessen and YCombinator CEO Gary Tan, have added \u201ce/acc\u201d to their X handles.\n\nVitalik Buterin said he is sympathetic to the e/acc perspective but also criticized on several points.\n\nAs well as developing many of the digital innovations that shape the world today, Silicon Valley has also spawned a variety of philosophical movements over the years, often garnering mainstream attention after being picked up by influential tech bosses.\n\nIn the latest example of the phenomenon, business leaders, including YCombinator CEO Gary Tan and digital innovator-cum-venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, have endorsed a fiercely pro-AI techno-philosophy known as \u201ceffective accelerationism,\u201d often shortened to e/acc. And now, Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin has waded into the debate too.\n\nMarc Andreessen\u2019s Techno-Optimism\n\nWriting in his personal blog on Monday, November 27, Buterin responded to Andreessen\u2019s Techno-Optimist Manifesto , in which American businessman articulates his views on an idea that is fundamental to the intellectual culture of Silicon Valley: the notion of technology as a force for good that must be harnessed in the name of progress.\n\nA kind of polemic against what he perceives as a prevailing pessimistic discourse on technology, the views contained within Andreessen\u2019s manifesto place it firmly in the accelerationist camp of political philosophies.\n\nTHE TECHNO-OPTIMIST MANIFESTO part 1 \u201cYou live in a deranged age \u2014 more deranged than usual, because despite great scientific and technological advances, man has not the faintest idea of who he is or what he is doing.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Walker Percy \u201cOur species is 300,000 years old. For the\u2026 \u2014 Marc Andreessen \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@pmarca) October 16, 2023\n\nFor anyone familiar with his political and economic beliefs, Andreessen\u2019s latest monologue is continuous with a long-running ideological project. Over the years, the influential technology investor had often spoken of his admiration for the works of Ray Kurzweil and the controversial father of accelerationism, Nick Land.\n\nThe addition of \u201ceffective,\u201d however, is more recent.\n\nAlongside other prominent figures within the American technology sector, in 2023, Andreessen praised the pseudonymous internet personalities Beff Jezos and Bayes Lord, who coined the term e/acc in 2022.\n\ne/acc is the cultural framework of a more advanced civilization assembling itself from the future. \u2014 Beff Jezos \u2014 e/acc \u23e9 (@BasedBeffJezos) November 28, 2023\n\nIn Land\u2019s initial formulation, accelerationism posits that there is no way to resist or slow the \u201ctechno-capital machine,\u201d which can only accelerate the inevitable advance of technology.\n\nInflected through a digital culture that draws as much from SciFi movies and 4Chan mythology as it does the realm of traditional academia, e/acc has moved the discussion forward somewhat.\n\nFrom the inevitability of the forward march of capitalism, proponents of the new theory embrace acceleration as much as possible, rejecting outright any attempts to curb technological progress.\n\nVitalik Buterin Cautions Against AI Risks\n\nWhile Buterin is sympathetic to Andreessen\u2019s techno-optimism, the two men diverge on the issue of Artificial Intelligence (AI).\n\nAndreessen\u2019s view can be summed up by his assertation that \u201cany deceleration of AI will cost lives.\u201d Arguing against the precautionary principle, the Silicon Valley investor rejects any attempt to constrain technological growth, stating that \u201cthere is no material problem [\u2026] that cannot be solved with more technology.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, although he broadly aligns with Andreessen\u2019s criticism of anti-growth narratives, Buterin makes a point of distinguishing AI from other technologies. Observing that \u201cAI is fundamentally different from other tech,\u201d the Ethereum founder said it warrants a uniquely cautious approach.\n\nNew monster post: my own current perspective on the recent debates around techno-optimism, AI risks, and ways to avoid extreme centralization in the 21st century.https://t.co/6lN2fLBUUL pic.twitter.com/h5aIyFNCoh \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) November 27, 2023\n\nButerin\u2019s understanding of AI acknowledges that its capacity for self-improvement undermines the idea that any negative consequences can simply be countered with more advanced technology at a later date.\n\nMoreover, while the prospect of a Skynet-style superintelligence turning against humanity might seem outlandish in 2023, Buterin made the case that in the wrong hands, contemporary AI already poses a significant threat to human freedom:\n\n\u201cMy basic fear is that the same kinds of managerial technologies that allow OpenAI to serve over a hundred million customers with 500 employees will also allow a 500-person political elite, or even a 5-person board, to maintain an iron fist over an entire country. With modern surveillance to collect information, and modern AI to interpret it, there may be no place to hide.\u201d\n\nConsidering the rapid pace of AI development in recent years, Buterin isn\u2019t the only one who has voiced concerns.\n\nAround the world, most politicians and business leaders reject the hardline accelerationist stance and acknowledge that some checks and balances are needed. However, the question of what the appropriate level of restraint is remains contested.\n\nAmong AI developers, disagreement on the matter has created a growing rift between those who favor unbridled growth and those who support exercising restraint.\n\nOn one side, there are those like Emmett Shear, who lean toward moderation. Before his short-lived tenure as the CEO of OpenAI, Shear made it clear that he thought AI was evolving too quickly. \u201cIf we\u2019re at a speed of 10 right now, a pause is reducing to 0. I think we should aim for a 1-2 instead,\u201d he stated in September.\n\nNow, however, Altman is once again at the reigns. Newly empowered by a board shakeup that was one of the conditions of his return, Altman\u2019s leadership, while unlikely to endorse a full-blown e/acc agenda, nonetheless signals that the techno-optimists are back in charge."

        "content": "Early ETH and ADA investors are considering NuggetRush\n\nWith no buy/sell tax, collectible NFTs, and strategic partnerships, NuggetRush can carve market share in the gaming industry.\n\nEthereum\u2019s decline prompts investors to diversify, while Cardano\u2019s price dip after collaboration with Kraken seems to have triggered more outflow to NuggetRush.\n\nInvestors who previously supported Ethereum and Cardano appear to be considering a new crypto project, NuggetRush (NUGX). These investors have reportedly been accumulating NUGX in the ongoing presale.\n\nNuggetRush offers real-world rewards and opportunities for players worldwide. The project features collectible NFT characters, providing a sense of novelty and value. Additionally, the absence of buy-or-sell tax and a smart contract audit by SolidProof may explain rising interest.\n\nThis article explores why early investors of Ethereum and Cardano are looking at NuggetRush.\n\nNuggetRush: transforming crypto gaming hubs with staked NFTs and rewards\n\nNuggetRush is a platform that combines gold mining, crypto, and real-world artisanal mining in a play-to-earn (P2E) game. The project launched on Ethereum and offers easy access for users.\n\nThe game includes various characters that act as game pieces and collectible memes. NuggetRush aims to partner with gold providers who can ship RUSHGEM winnings directly to miners.\n\nThis strategy adds a tangible and prestigious element to in-game rewards.\n\nYou might also like: Assessing Shiba Inu and Dogecoin alternatives, focus on NuggetRush\n\nThe game also includes a staking feature that allows NFT holders to lock assets in the system, receiving rewards based on the annual percentage yield (APY) and the quantity of staked NFTs. This mechanism prevents owners from selling their NFTs during the staking period.\n\nNuggetRush\u2019s game also incorporates a player-driven marketplace where users can sell or trade character NFTs, rare items, and mined materials.\n\nAdditionally, a percentage of rewards and in-game purchases contribute to supporting artisanal miners in underdeveloped countries.\n\nThis provides income to over 100 million people engaged in informal mining activities in developing nations.\n\nNuggetRush\u2019s holistic approach reflects its commitment to driving gaming innovation and social impact.\n\nState of Cardano prices\n\nOn Nov. 12, 2023, Charles Hoskinson, the creator of Cardano, publicly expressed interest in collaborating with Kraken, a major U.S.-based crypto exchange.\n\nThe partnership is focused on advancing the development of Cardano\u2019s layer-2 solution. It aligns strategically with Kraken\u2019s search for a suitable blockchain partner.\n\nThis update positively impacted ADA prices, which rose from $0.37 to $0.39 within 24 hours.\n\nEven so, the upward trend was short-lived, and between Nov. 12 and 18, ADA prices fell 10.26%, dropping from $0.39 to $0.35.\n\nEthereum investors diversify\n\nEthereum enables functionalities like smart contracts, which automatically execute under predefined conditions, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\n\nETH prices fell in early 2023, affecting investors and their portfolios.\n\nConsequently, early ETH investors looking to diversify their portfolios are looking at other high-growth projects.\n\nConclusion\n\nNuggetRush aims to reshape the GamiFi industry through its technology and features.\n\nIts play-to-earn gaming platform includes accurate word rewards, which make it a potentially valuable addition to any portfolio.\n\nEarly investors of ETH and ADA are exploring NuggetRush, with some considering the token in the ongoing presale.\n\nVisit the NuggetRush presale website\n\nRead more: Berkshire Hathaway vice chair Charlie Munger passes away at age 99\n\nDisclosure: This content is provided by a third party. crypto.news does not endorse any product mentioned on this page.

Discover SCENE\n\nAfter cooling its November rally Solana has shot up again: it's right now the best-performing cryptocurrency out of the top 20 coins and tokens.\n\nAt the time of writing Solana (SOL) is trading for $60.16 per coin\u2014a 24-hour jump of over 7%, according to CoinGecko. Over the past seven days, SOL has gained 10% in value.\n\nSOL experienced a phenomenal rally throughout November. The Ethereum-competitor price soared past $50 for the first time since May 2022, beating most coins and tokens in performance.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAccording to experts, the boom was likely down to a short squeeze caused by short sellers exiting their positions and renewed interest from institutions. But that was nearly a month ago and Solana is still pumping.\n\nSOL was the most oversold asset in the space after rumors swirled that collapsed crypto exchange FTX's new management was thinking about selling large amounts of SOL. But it shot up unexpectedly after short sellers (those who\u2019ve bet on the asset going down) rapidly exited their positions.\n\nOver the past 30 days, SOL is up over 70%.\n\nElsewhere, the crypto market is relatively sleepy. Bitcoin has barely budged over a 24-hour period; the same goes for Ethereum. Other major players like Dogecoin, Tron, and XRP have also not moved by a percentage point.\n\nBitcoin yesterday did experience impressive price movements, breaking past $38,000 per coin for the second time in a week.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe same goes for most of the top digital assets\u2014except for Avalanche (AVAX), which is up in the past day, coming in at $20.87.\n\nAVAX\u2014like SOL\u2014is also a winner over the past 30 days: it has gained 80% in value.

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nAccording to the founder of Cardano, the Ethereum blockchain network appears to be mirroring Cardano\u2019s existing structure, as its co-founder attempts to restructure one of its most notable features. Hoskinson is convinced that Cardano has never been credited for its position in the industry as a prototype.\n\nIn a recent post shared to X, formerly Twitter, Charles Hoskinson has made some remarkable statements on the perceived impact that Cardano has had in the blockchain industry.\n\nThe Ethereum community has failed to commend Cardano as an innovative solution, despite Ethereum\u2019s attempts to reframe its network by replicating the features that Cardano has previously integrated into its platform.\n\n\u201c..I am truly at a loss that Cardano can never be mentioned as an innovative ecosystem on team E. V is rediscovering what we\u2019ve been working on for almost a decade and it\u2019s like a new revelation. It\u2019s extraordinary that we never get a shout-out.\u201d Hoskinson wrote.\n\nNot fueling hostilities but I am truly at a loss that Cardano can never be mentioned as an innovative ecosystem over on team E. V is rediscovering what we've been working on for almost a decade and it's like a new revelation. It's extraordinary that we never get a shout-out \u2014 Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) November 24, 2023\n\nHis statement was made in response to criticism from an X user who claimed that Hoskinson\u2019s recent remarks to Vitalik Buterin could fuel hostility between both communities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile Hoskinson denies this, he maintains that Ethereum\u2019s current version is still behind on innovation. Notably, a Cardano user shared a clip from a recent interview with Vitalik Buterin.\n\nIn the interview, Buterin highlighted the importance of solving the problem of centralization within the staking ecosystem. He added that the structure of staking pools and the difficulties surrounding solar staking have made staking less healthy.\n\nTo alleviate these issues, redesigning the staking system. He proposes introducing a UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) permit system to the network. It bears mentioning that Cardano already utilizes an extended UTXO model, known as the Extended-UTXO (EUTXO).\n\nButerin further observed that transferring funds would become even more decentralized under the UTxO approach.\n\nAs he explained,\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s [UTXO] like a virtual coin where I get a new coin if you pay me money. If I pay you money, I get to break up one of my new coins that are smaller, and then, I get back one of the coins. You get a totally new coin that gains the money you need.\u201d\n\nUsing the UTxO approach, user coins will never be at risk of being changed without their consent. On the other hand, a balanced-based system can only track the amount of funds in a user\u2019s possession.\n\nBalanced systems do not offer the same properties as a UTxO permit system. User funds are subject to external change, with or without their consent."

To confirm the uptrend, XRP must shatter the midline of the supply zone at $0.6857. In a highly bullish case, the $0.8000 psychological level could be tagged soon.\n\nXRP/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the other hand, if the bears dominate, selling pressure could send XRP price below $0.5981, thereby invalidating the bullish thesis. In an extended move south, Ripple price could test the 50-day SMA at $0.5853, with prospects for more losses past the 200 and 100-day SMAs at $0.5531 and $0.5480, respectively.\n\nAlso Read: XRP price to pull north as Ripple beckons financial institutions to adopt XRPL XRP token."

After retracing from that initial jump, both metrics have continued to climb, widening their gap relative to the two largest blockchains.\n\nNEAR has 838,000 daily active addresses, the most out of major Layer 1 chains after Tron, tying with BNB Chain, with Bitcoin, Solana and Ethereum coming next, according to data provider Artemis Terminal. NEAR\u2019s daily transactions of 1.7M beat out Ethereum, Bitcoin and Avalanche, while still trailing Solana, Tron and BNB Chain, the data show.\n\nLayer 1 Daily Active Addresses & Daily Transactions\n\nGames and Payments\n\nGames and payments apps are fueling growth, with KAIKANOW, a shopping app, leading the way in terms of active wallets. Fitness app SWEATCOIN drove the spike in September, when it launched in the U.S., and today reached 1 million on-chain active users for the first time.\n\n\u201cWe built NEAR Protocol to be the entry point to the Open Web and onboard the first billion users,\u201d Illia Polosukhin, co-founder of NEAR Protocol, said in an emailed comment. He said SWEAT\u2019s success is \u201cdemonstrating that a great Web2 business can successfully migrate to Web3 and showcasing the power of NEAR to support global mainstream usage.\u201d\n\nWhile outperforming in terms of network metrics, NEAR\u2019s native token is trailing BTC and ETH this year.

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nVitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum, has issued a stark warning about artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nHe\u2019s not grouping AI with usual tech advancements like smartphones or social media. Instead, Buterin places AI in a category of its own due to its potential to revolutionize society (much like the printing press or the wheel did).\n\nThe twist? AI might outsmart us all, potentially becoming the dominant force on Earth. It's a leap into uncharted territory.\n\nThe threat of superintelligent AI\n\nButerin\u2019s concerns extend beyond typical tech fears. He cautions that a superintelligent AI could perceive humans as a threat, leading to catastrophic outcomes.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not a distant future issue \u2013 AI is advancing rapidly. While we\u2019d ideally want these superintelligent beings to be our allies, programming them to coexist with humans safely is a challenge we haven\u2019t yet solved.\n\nThis might sound like sci-fi, but it\u2019s a topic being taken seriously in tech circles. Rob Bensinger from MIRI illustrates diverse opinions on the AI threat level.\n\nIn a striking revelation, a 2022 survey among machine learning experts suggested a 5-10% chance of AI leading to human extinction.\n\nDespite sounding speculative, these concerns have been around for over a decade and warrant attention.\n\nEnvisioning the future with AI\n\nButerin also invites us to consider what life would be like in a world ruled by AI. He refers to Iain Banks's Culture series, where humans coexist with powerful AIs.\n\nThis imagined future offers longevity, health, and entertainment, but at a potential cost \u2013 humans may not be in control.\n\nThis prompts a crucial question about our future coexistence with AI: Will we be partners, or merely passengers in a world driven by machine intelligence?"

        "content": "Tue 28 Nov 2023 \u25aa 3 min of reading \u25aa by Fitah\n\nThe EIP 4844 or Proto-Danksharding is arguably one of the most significant updates for Ethereum, the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency. Highly anticipated by the community, its activation is planned for the first quarter of 2024. This update will enable a reduction in layer 2 (L2) transaction fees. Moreover, it will enhance the overall performance of Ethereum.\n\nReduction of Fees and Network Throughput Improvement\n\nThe EIP 4844 aims to reduce transaction fees on layer 2 (L2) solutions, potentially decreasing them by a factor of seven. The reduction of transaction fees will be accompanied by an increase in bandwidth on the network. According to expert Ryan Berckmans, the EIP 4844 should allow for the creation of a more efficient market for data storage. This is what he calls \u201cblob market clearance,\u201d which will notably increase Ethereum\u2019s throughput by sixfold.\n\nEthereum's EIP 4844 data blobs launch in ~3 months to greatly reduce L2 fees\n\n\n\nBy now, many people know that blobs initially give us ~7x data bandwidth (iirc), which is huge but not enough for global ubiquity.\n\n\n\nWhat's less well known may be that\n\n\n\n1) blob gas doesn't compete with\u2026 \u2014 Ryan Berckmans ryanb.eth (@ryanberckmans) November 25, 2023 Ryan Berckmans, an ETH community member on Twitter\n\nThe upgrade won\u2019t impact the gas costs of the main layer (L1), ensuring the stability of execution costs. Consequently, Ethereum\u2019s profitability and throughput will increase by 600%. With the introduction of the EIP 4844, L2 solutions will evolve the Ethereum crypto network in an unprecedented way, as they will benefit from the upgrade and contribute to Ethereum\u2019s scaling.\n\nExcellent Prospects in Sight for ETH Crypto\n\nThe expected improvements to the Ethereum ecosystem should strengthen its position in the crypto market. According to data, the network\u2019s revenue growth over the last twelve months in the third quarter of 2023 was 10.32%. The quarterly growth rate of 12.57% during the same period highlights a robust upward trend.\n\nThe upgrade could further boost revenue growth due to increased network efficiency and reduced gas costs. Notably, the ETH crypto is priced close to its 52-week high, at 99.32% of its maximum value. This seems to indicate strong investor confidence. The next release of Ethereum\u2019s financial results, set for February 1, 2024, will provide more insight into the financial impact of upcoming upgrades.\n\nIn the meantime, on the market, the price of Ethereum is facing a major resistance: the annual peak at $2,138. Since Friday, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has indeed recorded a decline of 5.5%. Currently, the ETH crypto is back to the psychological area of $2,000.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program!

        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction: Throughout the major part of November, the Ethereum price remained within a sideways range, fluctuating between $2133 and $1917. Both of these horizontal levels were tested twice, signaling uncertainty among market participants. However, this consolidation has formed a bearish reversal pattern, suggesting a potential further downside for ETH.\n\nAlso Read: Here\u2019s Why CBDCs Could Outshine BTC, Ethereum, and Other Private Cryptos\n\nadvertisement\n\nWill $ETH Consolidation Lead to Massive Leap?\n\nThe overhead supply at $2133 assists sellers in developing a bearish reversal pattern called double bottom\n\nThe $1917 level aligned with the 32.8% Fibonacci retracement level creates a strong support zone.\n\nThe intraday trading volume in Ether is $10.5 Billion, indicating a 16% gain.\n\nAmid the past two weeks\u2019 consolidation, the Ethereum price retreated twice from the $2133 resistance, indicating substantial overhead supply. These reversals have emphasized the emergence of a bullish reversal pattern known as a Double Bottom on the daily timeframe chart.\n\nTypically observed near market tops, this pattern signifies a decline in bullish momentum. At present, ETH trades at $2,025 and, with an intraday loss of 1.6%, is gradually approaching the neckline support at $1,970.\n\nA bearish breakdown below this neckline could intensify supply pressure, potentially causing ETH to drop to around the $1700 mark, marking a potential loss of 12%.\n\nHowever, the recent price rejections around the psychological support of $2,000 suggest buyers are attempting to counter the bearish setup. If this buying pressure persists, the ETH price might rebound to challenge the last swing high at $2133 and the upper trendline of a longstanding wedge pattern.\n\nETH Price Recovery to $3400\n\nOver the past 20 months, the ETH price has experienced a shallow recovery within a rising wedge pattern. Historically, the upper boundary of this trendline has resulted in increased supply pressure, leading to significant corrections. Therefore, the current upward movement towards this upper trendline necessitates a definitive breakout to confirm a bullish trend. A post-breakout rally could potentially drive prices up to $3400\n\nRelative Strength Index (RSI): A sharp drop in the daily RSI slope suggests a bearish divergence with the Ethereum price, hinting at potential upcoming downturns.\n\nBollinger Bands: The converging boundaries of the Bollinger Bands indicate an uncertain market sentiment prevailing for Ethereum."

This has subsequently resulted in the first reduction in the staking pool balance since the Shanghai upgrade.\n\nValidator Exodus\n\nAccording to blockchain intelligence platform Glassnode, an increasing number of validators are currently exiting the Ethereum staking pool.\n\nThe introduction of stake withdrawals in Shanghai acted as a catalyst, leading to a surge in validators leaving the staking pool, claiming rewards, and reshuffling their staking provider and setup. Exiting events averaged 309 validators per day during this time.\n\nThe report also observed a gradual increase in exiting events since early October, ultimately reaching an average of 1,018 validators per day. This uptick aligned with the recent uptrend in spot prices across crypto markets.\n\nAs a result, the Total Effective Balance \u2013 which represents the ETH in the Staking Pool that is actively participating in Proof-of-Stake Consensus \u2013 has slowed in its growth and is now undergoing the first decline since the Shanghai upgrade.\n\n\u201cRecent weeks have seen a notable change in the Ethereum staking pool dynamics, as the number of validators exiting the pool starts to increase. This has resulted in a slowdown of the growth rate for ETH issuance and the first reduction in the staking pool balance since the Shanghai upgrade.\u201d\n\nA majority of the exiting validators have voluntarily withdrawn over the past eight weeks. Meaning the stakers independently decided to exit the staking pool instead of slashing, which is a penalty applied to validators who violate protocol rules.\n\nDuring the same period, there have been only two instances of slashing, with one being significant, which involved the slashing of 100 recently joined validators who were penalized for simultaneously signing two different blocks within the network.\n\nWhat\u2019s Driving This Investor Behavior?\n\nSince October, Glassnode stated that centralized exchanges \u2013 particularly Kraken and Coinbase \u2013 have consistently led to stake withdrawals. Meanwhile, Liquid Staking Providers, dominated by Lido, have seen a modest increase in withdrawn stakes.\n\nInvestor behavior driving these trends includes a shift in staking setups, potentially driven by regulatory concerns, and a possible rotation of capital from CEXs to Liquid Staking Providers or safer assets like US treasuries.\n\nAdditionally, Lido stood out among Liquid Staking Providers for exits. Lido\u2019s dominance is further highlighted by a net increase in its staked balance by 468k ETH. In contrast, Coinbase and Binance showed net increases among CEXs, while Kraken experienced a reduction of -19.4k ETH. Among staking providers, HTX and Staked.us exhibited substantial reductions."

        "title": "2 Cryptocurrencies That Are Down 85% From Their All-Time Highs and Ready to Pop - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Despite the recent bull market rally, many top cryptos are still trading at a hefty discount to their all-time highs. Bitcoin, for example, is still trading at a 45% discount to its all-time high of $68,790. And Ethereum (ETH 3.03%) is still trading 59% below its all-time high of $4,891.\n\nDig a little bit deeper, and you can find billion-dollar cryptos trading anywhere from 70% to 90% below their all-time highs. Two that particularly stand out for me are Cardano (ADA 2.34%) and Avalanche (AVAX 2.51%). Both have market capitalizations north of $7.5 billion, both are former crypto darlings that are now trading at more than 85% discounts, and both have long-term growth catalysts in place. In short, they're both crypto tokens ready to pop.\n\n1. Cardano\n\nCardano, which is trading 87% below its all-time high of $3.10, is a Layer 1 blockchain, similar to Ethereum. In fact, the founder of Cardano (Charles Hoskinson) is one of the founders of Ethereum. As a result, it offers the same core functionality and utility as Ethereum, including non-fungible tokens (NFTs), decentralized finance (DeFi), Web3, and gaming.\n\nThat's why it's so puzzling that Ethereum, with a market cap of $242 billion, is worth nearly 20 times the value of Cardano, which has a market cap of just $13 billion. You can think of this from two different angles. From one perspective, investors have given up on Cardano ever surpassing Ethereum. From the other perspective, Cardano is a hidden gem that investors have somehow overlooked.\n\nI'm in the second group. There's a lot to like about Cardano, including its phenomenal success in DeFi this year.\n\nThis was an area where Cardano had badly lagged other rivals, including Ethereum. But if you look at current total-value-locked (TVL) figures for Cardano, the picture seems to have vastly improved. Cardano now ranks 12th among all blockchains.\n\nCardano's TVL (which is a useful way of measuring how much activity is taking place on a blockchain) has been pushing to new all-time highs this year. Over the past 10 months, Cardano has had success in several areas of DeFi, including the launch of new stablecoins and decentralized exchanges. All of this suggests that more growth could be on the way.\n\n2. Avalanche\n\nAvalanche is another Layer 1 blockchain that could be significantly undervalued. It currently trades around $20, still 86% below its all-time high of $146. Moreover, in terms of market cap, Ethereum is still 30 times more valuable than Avalanche.\n\nThe good news is that there's reason to think that Avalanche will eventually narrow this gap. During the last bull market rally, Avalanche was widely considered to be an \"Ethereum killer.\" Investors viewed it as one of a handful of blockchains ready to challenge Ethereum, primarily due to superior performance in terms of speed, efficiency, and costs.\n\nRight now, investors are willing to pay a premium for any blockchain capable of taking on Ethereum. Another potential \"Ethereum killer\" -- Solana -- is up nearly 450% for the year. If Avalanche starts to trade more like Solana, then it could really pop. While Avalanche is up 89% for the year, it's only recently that it has started to heat up.\n\nTaking a long-term view, what has me particularly intrigued is a partnership that Avalanche signed with the cloud computing unit of Amazon in January. At the time, the vision was for Avalanche to offer blockchain services to large enterprise and government clients, much like Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers cloud computing services to large enterprise and government clients.\n\nCan any blockchain ever overtake Ethereum?\n\nIf you are thinking about investing in Cardano and Avalanche, just ask yourself a simple question: Do you think any blockchain can ever supplant Ethereum as the world's preeminent Layer 1 blockchain?\n\nIf you think the answer is no, then there's no need for further due diligence. But if you think that, yes, there is a chance some other blockchain will eventually surpass Ethereum, then it's worth taking a deeper dive into the prospects of Cardano and Avalanche.\n\nAs Cardano and Avalanche chip away at the market dominance of Ethereum, they should become more valuable. And, as a result, the vast chasm that separates them from Ethereum in terms of market cap should continue to narrow.\n\nIf that's the case, then investing in them now, when they're still bargain-priced, could end up being a fantastic long-term investment strategy."

        "title": "Layer-2 network to launch a decentralized sequencer pool - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "In their quest for scalability and cost-effectiveness, many layer-2 networks adopt a centralized approach to on-chain transaction processing, introducing a single point of failure vulnerability. The Metis blockchain, however, has pioneered a distributed sequencer pool to improve security and decentralization.\n\nThe Ethereum blockchain introduced smart contracts to automate certain events on the network, laying the foundation of decentralized finance (DeFi). As the DeFi ecosystem continues its exponential growth, however, the limitations of Ethereum have become clear.\n\nDespite last year\u2019s migration to proof-of-stake, partially addressing the scalability issues of the Ethereum blockchain, the Ethereum network remains expensive when it comes to gas fees \u2014 the cost of each transaction executed on the blockchain. On top of that, the huge decentralized world built on Ethereum makes network congestion on the base layer a regular occurrence.\n\nThanks to the decentralized and open-source nature of the Ethereum blockchain, developers have built numerous networks on top of the base layer \u2014 called \u201clayer-2 blockchains\u201d \u2014 to fix specific limitations. Soon after, layer-2 (L2) networks that offer faster transaction speed or lower gas fees, including Arbitrum and Optimism, emerged.\n\nSequencer \u2014 key to order on blockchain\n\nHowever, one common aspect found in most layer-2 projects is that they rely on a single sequencer, which creates a vulnerability linked to centralization. But what exactly is a sequencer?\n\nIn blockchain terms, a sequencer operates like a traffic controller for on-chain transactions. A blockchain sequencer first collects on-chain transactions that would be included in a specific block. It puts transactions in order \u2014 an essential step for the network to function normally. The sequencer then places those transactions in a block, ensuring the block is filled correctly and in the right order.\n\nRelying on a single sequencer for ordering and placing on-chain transactions introduces a critical vulnerability known as a single point of failure (SPOF). If this sequencer malfunctions due to a cyberattack, technical glitch, or outside intervention, the entire blockchain network comes to a standstill. Additionally, a single sequencer may struggle to handle the increasing transaction volume, leading to scalability issues. To address these concerns, alternative solutions can be explored.\n\nDecentralizing the network controller\n\nMetis, a layer-2 Ethereum scaling solution, has introduced a decentralized sequencer pool to increase the transaction speed and throughput of blockchain while maintaining Ethereum\u2019s decentralization and security. Going beyond the single-sequencer model used by Arbitrum, Optimism, and other L2 projects, Metis is rolling out a distributed pool of sequencers \u2014 a fresh concept with built-in risk management that keeps the network up even if one of the many sequencers in the pool goes down for any reason.\n\nThe sequencer pool model works with Metis\u2019 existing decentralized peer-to-peer validators and block producer network to enable smooth and secure sequencer transitions while removing faulty or malicious nodes.\n\nThe architecture of Metis\u2019 decentralized sequencer pool. Source: Metis\n\nWith the decentralized approach, individual sequencer nodes can be created by whitelisted users. Metis has also announced a staking mechanism to work alongside the sequencer pool. Users will need to supply many locked METIS, the native token of the Metis network, to operate a sequencer node in the pool. By incentivizing staking with yields, Metis aims to get more sequencers onboard and gradually decrease the circulating supply.\n\nCommunity-driven network\n\nLoyal to the decentralization ethos, Metis plans to utilize the power of community to expand its network while keeping its network highly accessible with an easy-to-use Web3 building environment. The platform offers a streamlined user experience with gas fees that cost \u201cless than a penny\u201d while providing one of the fastest transaction speeds found in any L2 solution.\n\nTo foster community engagement and encourage participation in the upcoming launch of its decentralized sequencer, Metis is hosting its Community Testing event. This event will allow testers to earn rewards and contribute to the development of the project before the sequencer pool goes live.\n\n\u201cMetis is excited to roll out the first-ever layer 2 sequencer pool,\u201d said Tom Ngo, project lead at Metis.\n\n\u201cWe invite the entire blockchain and crypto communities to participate in Community Testing. By joining, users will be helping the core blockchain mission of decentralization while accruing attractive opportunities for each tester.\u201d\n\nAs the blockchain ecosystem grows with new projects, keeping the main pillars of decentralization intact is crucial. With its innovative approach to how blockchain operates, Metis\u2019 decentralized sequencer pool addresses the SPOF vulnerability while keeping its mission of rewarding the blockchain community in focus.\n\nLearn more about Metis"

Source: Vitalik.eth\n\nRelated: How AI is changing crypto: Hype vs. reality\n\nButerin suggested this route would be safer, as humans could be involved in each decision made by the AI machine.\n\n\u201cWe [can] reduce the incentive to offload high-level planning responsibility to the AI itself, and thereby reduce the chance that the AI does something totally unaligned with humanity\u2019s values on its own.\u201d\n\nThe Ethereum co-founder also suggested \u201cactive human intention\u201d to take AI in a direction that benefits humanity, as maximizing profit doesn\u2019t always lead humans down the most desirable pathway.\n\nButerin concluded that \u201cwe, humans, are the brightest star\u201d in the universe, as we\u2019ve developed technology to expand upon human potential for thousands of years, and hopefully many more to come:\n\n\u201cTwo billion years from now, if the Earth or any part of the universe still bears the beauty of Earthly life, it will be human artifices like space travel and geoengineering that will have made it happen.\u201d\n\nMagazine: Real AI use cases in crypto, No. 1: The best money for AI is crypto"

However, it is imperative to understand how crypto wallets work to trust the allocation of your digital assets to them.\n\nEthereum wallets provide a secure, efficient and user-friendly mechanism to store ETH, NFTs and other crypto tokens and then later buy products with Ethereum if they so wish.\n\nCrypto wallets are not unlike regular cash wallets. They also allow users to digitally hold their assets, the key difference being that crypto assets are not physically stored in the wallet.\n\nCryptocurrencies are bits of data that are located on a blockchain. The wallets essentially store the user\u2019s proof of ownership of crypto assets.\n\nETH tokens are stored in Ethereum\u2019s Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs). Most Ethereum wallets allow users to generate a new Ethereum account. Traders do not need to use a previously generated Ethereum account.\n\nUsers operate their ETH tokens through two cryptographic keys: a private key and a public key.\n\nPublic Key: A public key can be intuitively visualized as a bank account number. Users can transfer ETH tokens from to others using their public key. Public keys are named so because users can publicly distribute this key to receive crypto assets from others.\n\nPrivate Key: A private key is an alpha-numeric passcode that proves a user\u2019s ownership of an Ethereum account. Every Ethereum EOA has an associated private key. As the name suggests, a private key needs to be protected at all costs.\n\nIf a malicious actor gets hold of the key, they can easily claim possession of all the crypto assets associated with it. Due to the decentralized nature of blockchain technology, in most cases, users cannot even recover their accounts.\n\nA private key has another important use. Ethereum uses a user\u2019s private key to cryptographically generate a digital signature. This digital signature is used to sign all outgoing crypto transactions. A malicious actor can use the private key to forge transactions.\n\nA wallet is primarily responsible for protecting this private key. Furthermore, a wallet can also generate multiple public keys. A public key is cryptographically derived from a private key. While the public key can be distributed, it can be used to track certain details about a user such as transaction history and account balance. Therefore, modern wallets generate a new public key after every transaction to protect a user\u2019s privacy.\n\nA crypto wallet uses a seed phrase to authenticate the user\u2019s ownership of the wallet. Therefore, it is imperative that users protect their seed phrases from ever being stolen. Users can also choose to store the phrase at multiple locations for surety.\n\nTypes of Ethereum Wallet\n\nWhile all wallets generally perform the same set of functions, there can be several key differences between them. A beginner user needs to understand the tradeoffs involved in order to choose the best Ethereum wallet.\n\nBased on the mode of availability, wallets are generally categorized into three categories: software wallets, hardware wallets and paper wallets.\n\nSoftware Wallet\n\nA software wallet is an application that allows users to store their crypto assets by digitally securing their private keys.\n\nA software wallet\u2019s best feature is its accessibility. Users can access these applications on commonly used devices such as Android and iOS phones, personal computers and even web browsers. They do not require the purchase of any new equipment or device.\n\nSoftware wallets are commonly referred to as hot wallets. While those terms may be used interchangeably, a hot wallet is technically referred to as any wallet that is connected to the internet.\n\nSoftware wallets being connected to the internet results in a tradeoff between ease of use and security. Software wallets allow users to quickly purchase and sell crypto assets using their private keys. The best crypto apps can also often support a wider range of crypto tokens and provide seamless transactions. Furthermore, they provide a range of payment options such as credit/debit cards, Google Pay, Apple Pay and PayPal.\n\nWhile software wallets provide a bevy of advantages, they are considered less secure than hardware wallets. The connectivity to the internet can allow hackers and other malicious actors to gain access to a user\u2019s private key.\n\nA software wallet can be further categorized into three categories: mobile wallets, desktop wallets and web wallets.\n\nMobile Wallet : As the name suggests, mobile wallets are applications that users can run on their Android or iOS platforms. Best Ethereum wallets such as Best Wallet offer these applications on both Google Play Store and Apple app store.\n\n: As the name suggests, mobile wallets are applications that users can run on their Android or iOS platforms. Best Ethereum wallets such as Best Wallet offer these applications on both Google Play Store and Apple app store. Desktop Wallet : Desktop wallets are wallet interfaces that users can download on their personal computers. Desktop applications store the private key on the computer\u2019s local storage.\n\n: Desktop wallets are wallet interfaces that users can download on their personal computers. Desktop applications store the private key on the computer\u2019s local storage. Web Wallet: Web wallets are one of the most popular kinds of software wallets. Users can usually search for these wallet services on the internet and add them as a web browser extension. While these wallets provide extremely user-friendly interfaces, they are considered the least secure. They can be subjected to keylogger hacks and distributed denial of service (DDOS) attacks.\n\nHardware Wallets\n\nHardware wallets are considered one of the most secure forms of crypto storage. These wallets are physical pieces of equipment that secure the private-public key pair. Users need to connect the equipment to a device such as a personal computer to operate the wallet.\n\nAn Ethereum hardware wallet is also referred to as a cold wallet. Cold wallets are defined as any crypto storage device that does not connect to the internet. The lack of internet connection ensures that malicious actors cannot steal the confidential information of the users. Software wallets are as secure as the platform they are operating on while hardware wallets provide additional multiple layers of security for users.\n\nHardware wallets can also provide additional security features. For example, modern cold wallets use security features such as a PIN code or a biometric scan that makes it impossible for a malicious actor to access the crypto tokens. Hardware wallets are also coming up with additional technology to replace seed phrases, thus eliminating the single point of failure.\n\nWhile hardware wallets are secure, they also have some key disadvantages. Most importantly, hardware wallets are considered to be less user-friendly than software wallets. These wallets need to be connected to another device such as a desktop to operate.\n\nHardware wallets are also considered significantly more expensive than software wallets \u2013 the price of a hardware wallet can usually range between $50 \u2013 $300 and can be a deal breaker for several users.\n\nPaper Wallets\n\nEthereum paper wallet involves crypto asset holders writing down their private-public key pair on a piece of paper. This is an old method of storage that is rarely used with the advent of modern crypto wallet technology.\n\nPaper wallets are a kind of cold wallet. However, unlike hardware wallets, they are considered unreliable and risky. Users with paper wallets require an interface to access the blockchain. Therefore, they often end up depending upon exchanges or software wallets, negating any advantage of cold storage.\n\nFurthermore, paper wallets are a massive single point of failure risk. The private key can be lost, stolen or destroyed, making it impossible for the user to ever access their crypto assets.\n\nHow to Find Safe Ethereum Wallets?\n\nThe primary function of an Ethereum wallet is to secure a user\u2019s private key and the crypto assets allocated to it.\n\nInvestors, especially those just entering into crypto investment are always keen to know if cryptocurrency is safe to invest in and wallets are a necessary feature of participating in the space. However, there are several factors that a user can consider to choose the most secure Ethereum wallet.\n\nReputation of the Provider\n\nDue to the decentralized nature of crypto, scams and rug pulls are one of the biggest threats to the digital assets of a user.\n\nTherefore, considering the reputation of a wallet provider is the easiest step a user can take to trust the authenticity of the wallet.\n\nFor example, a wallet that is regulated by a leading regulatory body can generally be trusted. Similarly, providers with a strong track record of traditional financing can also be trusted with their crypto products.\n\nSecurity Features\n\nA good understanding of the various security features offered by crypto wallets can help users select the best wallet.\n\nHardware wallets are usually considered the most secure option. These wallets are not connected to the internet, preventing any malicious activity to access the user\u2019s confidential data. They can also provide additional security features such as biometrics and a PIN code.\n\nOn the other hand, a software wallet can also be trusted if it provides comprehensive security features.\n\nTesting the Wallet\n\nTesting the wallet may be the best way to develop trust. Users can send a small amount of crypto assets using the wallet before trusting it for significant amounts. A number of Ethereum wallets also allow users to try out the wallet on the testnet using fake crypto assets.\n\nHow To Choose The Best Ethereum Wallet For You?\n\nThe choice for the best Ethereum wallet is a matter of personal choice and can differ from user to user. Here are the key factors that can help users make an informed choice.\n\nSecurity\n\nAs we have already discussed, a wallet\u2019s primary role is to ensure the security of a user\u2019s crypto assets. Therefore, users need to consider security as their top priority while selecting the Ethereum wallet. Beginners need to choose a wallet that is reputed and is certified by a regulatory body.\n\nBeginners are also susceptible to losing their private keys. Therefore, they need to choose a wallet with proper wallet recovery options such as seed phrase, two-factor authentication.\n\nRemember, it is possible to avoid paying tax on crypto if you simply keep it in your wallet and don\u2019t sell it, but you want peace of mind that it will still be there when you return.\n\nSupported Coins\n\nBeginners can be overwhelmed by the wide variety of assets available in the crypto market. A high-quality wallet supports a large number of crypto tokens, thus allowing users to diversify their portfolios.\n\nMany top wallets are also universal in nature as they support more than one blockchain network.\n\nFees\n\nAnother important factor to consider is the fees required to purchase certain crypto assets through a wallet. Different wallets use different exchanges to allow users to purchase crypto tokens from the wallet interface. Hardware wallets can often partner with third-party services to offer crypto functionality to users.\n\nFees can be of various types such as processing fees, network fees, trading fees, withdrawal fees, etc. Hardware wallets also require users to purchase the device upfront which can be expensive.\n\nUser-Friendliness\n\nBeginners need to consider that the wallet they choose is user-friendly. The idea of user-friendliness can differ from user to user. Beginner users may prioritize the ability to operate their Ethereum wallets from their mobile phones. Proper customer support and a broad ecosystem can also make wallets like Best Wallet user-friendly.\n\nMost importantly, wallets must provide users with a clear user interface to buy, sell and store cryptocurrencies.\n\nFeatures\n\nUsers may prioritize the availability of certain features in their wallets. For example, NFT enthusiasts may prioritize that the wallet provides NFT support. Seasoned investors may require staking, farming and yield functionality in their wallets.\n\nType of Wallet and Mobile Availability\n\nUsers need to make a careful choice between hardware wallets and software wallets. Most beginners prefer the availability of mobile wallets. Therefore, they need to ensure that the wallet of their choice provides Android or iOS support.\n\nSeasoned investors may choose a multi-layered approach that involves both hot wallets and cold wallets. Such users usually store their assets in cold storage and transfer them to a hot wallet when they are looking to trade.\n\nHow to Get & Use A Ethereum Wallet \u2013 Step-by-Step\n\nBy now, a user has enough information to choose the best Ethereum wallet of their liking.

        "title": "Vitalik Buterin Teases Idea to Redesign Ethereum Staking, Binance Coin Dip Continues Following CEO Departure ... - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "SPONSORED POST*\n\nAs November comes to a close, we will be providing you with an overview of the most recent and exciting developments. This post will begin with Vitalik Buterin\u2019s potential redesign of Ethereum (ETH) staking and Binance Coin (BNB) price fall after the CEO\u2019s departure. It will end with insight into this new ICO, Meme Moguls (MGLS), a token with 100x potential.\n\nEthereum (ETH): Potential Redesign of Ethereum Staking\n\nEthereum (ETH) co-founder Vitalik Buterin proposed an ambitious plan to redesign Ethereum staking. If implemented, it could potentially have significant implications for both users and developers. This idea was teased while speaking at Devconnect in Turkey, outlining a strategy to enhance staking and address pressing performance issues.\n\nAccording to this Ethereum News, Buterin\u2019s vision includes integrating private mempools and ERC-4337. The former will enhance privacy and security, while the latter will give users more advanced control over their accounts.\n\nIt remains to be seen if this idea will be implemented. The Ethereum price today is a little over $2,000, which has been fluctuating.\n\nBinance Coin (BNB): CEO Resignation Results in Price Decline\n\nWhat is Binance Coin (BNB)? It is the utility token of the Binance exchange, along with other projects in the ecosystem. It has tangible applications and is a top-five cryptocurrency by market capitalization.\n\nLast week, Changpeng Zhao, popularly called \u2018CZ,\u2019 resigned as Binance CEO. His resignation was in the wake of his guilty plea to criminal charges and money laundering violations by the DOJ. This Binance Coin news reports that he will pay a fine of $200 million and faces a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison.\n\nFollowing his resignation, the price of Binance Coin declined by over 8% in the weekly timeframe. Will it continue to falter? Well, as it stands, things aren\u2019t looking promising\u2014excessive FUDs are flying around.\n\nMeme Moguls (MGLS): A 100x Token\n\nFinding the next 100x token requires strong research and a cryptocurrency meeting certain criteria. Ticking all the boxes is this top ICO, Meme Moguls (MGLS). Just like its name moguls it seeks to make influential and successful individuals.\n\nMeme Moguls will be a trailblazer in the meme world and the crypto landscape at large. Its unique contribution to the crypto scene is to become the world\u2019s first meme-backed stock market. This novel platform will allow users to buy, sell, and trade meme-based assets in their journey to becoming moguls.\n\nBy engaging with the platform, users will polish their meme-picking strategies. More importantly, they will be able to unearth the next 100x meme token. Ultimately, the platform will cover everything about memes, from trading to learning market insight and generally staying ahead of the curve.\n\nIt is poised to become the go-to platform for wealth accumulation and honing meme trading skills. This will set it apart from the rest and see it skyrocket. According to experts, its value will increase by 100x after launch.\n\nThe presale is ongoing currently in its first stage and a token costs only $0.0021. At the completion of each presale stage, there will be a mouthwatering giveaway of $10,000. To benefit from all its promises, we suggest checking it out.\n\nVisit Meme Moguls\n\n*This article was paid for Cryptonomist did not write the article or test the platform."

        "title": "Vitalik Buterin To Redesign Ethereum From The Ground Up - Blockzeit",
        "content": "If there\u2019s one person who is not happy with how Ethereum (ETH) turned out to be, that would be its co-founder, Vitalik Buterin. In a recent discussion, the Russian-Canadian programmer revealed he plans to redesign the network from the ground up to address some of its pressing flaws, especially in performance and staking.\n\nVitalik Buterin stated at the Devconnect in Turkey that he plans to redesign Ethereum staking and solve problems affecting performance. He recognizes the UTXO payment model and hopes to integrate private mempools, ERC-4337, code pre-compilation, ZK-EVMs and liquid staking in\u2026 \u2014 Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) November 27, 2023\n\nThe Problem of Ethereum According to Vitalik Buterin\n\nVitalik Buterin unveiled his ambitious plan to reform the second-biggest crypto by market dominance during the Devconnect event in Turkey. The developer of Ether is apparently not pleased with how are things going within his brainchild with Gavin Wood, Charles Hoskinson, Anthony Di Iorio, and Joseph Lubin.\n\nThe soft-spoken crypto personality particularly cited concerns over the performance issues that have been a constant pain in the network\u2019s side and the heavy reliance of its liquid staking in a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) model.\n\nThe Proposed Overhaul\n\nBased on the information shared by Wu Blockchain on the X platform, Buterin is looking to integrate private mempools to safeguard Ethereum users\u2019 privacy and security. The feature will allow them to transact without exposing their reason for doing so to the public mempool. This way, miners will not be able to take a peek of their intentions and potentially exploit them.\n\nAdditionally, the infusion of ERC-4337 for account abstraction gives users the ability to deploy smart contracts to manage their accounts without giving up control over them when using applications. This also paves the way for their convenience in the implementation of multisig wallet functionalities.\n\nSpeaking of smart contracts, Buterin wants to make their deployment more efficient, faster, and cheaper. He said this could be accomplished through code precompilation, which preprocesses some elements of the cryptograph. For a basic illustration of the term, it repurposes input data to generate output which is, in turn, used as input again, and so the cycle goes.\n\nLastly, Buterin emphasized the need to rectify the liquid staking of ETH that\u2019s now dangerously falling into the control of a few players. For context, the top five liquid stakers of Ethereum \u2014 Lido, Coinbase, Figment, Kraken, and Binance \u2014 have a combined 50% influence on the PoS chain. Among them, Lido accounts around a third of the pie.\n\nEthereum Now\n\nAs of this writing at 2:00 AM UTC time, Ethereum remains in the $2,024 range, only moving downward by 1.6% on the 24-hour timescale. A voluminous transaction was noted within this period nearly 30% as the coin hovered between a low of $1,988 to a high of $2,054."

        "content": "Best Ethereum App in Australia 2024\n\nThe best Ethereum app should allow you to buy and trade Ethereum, exchange the crypto for other cryptocurrencies, and perform a range of trading strategies short positions, range trading, and scalping.

If it\u2019s any consolation, their fees are very competitive and one of the best in the market.\n\nYour money is at risk\n\nBest Apps For Storing Ethereum\n\nThe best Ethereum apps for storing coins are wallets dedicated to storing ETH and other cryptocurrencies. These apps are not necessarily trading apps but are used by people who buy and keep cryptocurrencies rather than trade frequently. Let\u2019s explore the MetaMask wallet.\n\nMetaMask\n\nMetamask is one of the world\u2019s most popular Ethereum apps with over 30 million global users. Since its inception, MetaMask has continued to break boundaries and set itself as the best Ethereum wallet mobile app and the go-to portal between users and Web3 or blockchain applications. Let\u2019s explore why MetaMask is special.\n\nKey Features\n\nMetaMask is incredibly simple to use:\n\nMetaMask allows users to buy, sell, and swap tokens over its mobile application or browser extension. The wallet gives you a secure vault, token exchange capabilities, a token wallet, and safe login. It\u2019s an all-in-one app that promotes Web 3 usage in a simple interface. The beginner-friendly interface helps you store and manage your tokens.\n\nInteract with blockchain applications:\n\nMetaMask is ever so important because most Web 3 applications sit on the Ethereum blockchain and its variants. MetaMask bridges metaverse explorers with blockchains by providing a seamless portal to buy and exchange Ethereum \u2013 Ethereum blockchain\u2019s native token.\n\nMetaMask allows you securely access blockchain apps without giving up more than necessary data. The mobile app also supports NFT and DeFi applications such as opensea, giving you unlimited access to the DeFi world.\n\nMetaMask swap:\n\nMetaMask\u2019s new Swap feature allows you to swap tokens at the most competitive prices. For example, MetaMask accesses liquidity information of DEX\u2019s liquidity pools and DEX aggregators like UniSwap, AirSwap, Curve, 0XAPI, 1inch, and Paraswap. With such data, you can execute positions with DEXs with the largest liquidity and save money from spreads.\n\nThe gas fee on a swap is $0.0875% of the swap volume. For large swap volumes, MetaMask spreads your order over multiple DEXs to avoid slippage. Slippage occurs when you make large orders from a single exchange, and prices swing because the exchange isn\u2019t liquid enough to immediately execute the order. Large swaps or positions often lead to slippage, but MetaMask saves you from slippage costs by spreading your order over multiple DEXs.\n\nSecurity:\n\nMetaMask has intensive security protocols, multi-layer security systems, and 2FA authentication to ensure consumer funds\u2019 safety. MetaMask also has an open policy. That is, they disclose security breaches to the users immediately one is suspected. The transparency makes them the best place to buy Ethereum.\n\nMetaMask native ecosystem supports ETH and ETH-based tokens like the ERC-20 and ERC-721.\n\nPros: MetaMask is one of the most popular ETH wallets available.\n\nA swap fee of 0.875% is highly competitive, given that MetaMask exposes users to top DEXs with deep liquidity and minimizes spreads.\n\nA swap fee of 0.875% is highly competitive, given that MetaMask exposes users to top DEXs with deep liquidity and minimizes spreads.

Cons: While spreading your large order over different liquidity providers and DEXs, you may incur unwarranted fees each DEX charges on order execution. Spreads are not fixed and are entirely dependent on the market and the liquidity of the commodity.\n\nMetaMask supports Ethereum and its variants in its native ecosystem, while swaps are executed via a partnership with other companies. It begets the question of trust. Can you trust MetaMask to keep your data safe and not share unnecessary data with its partners? We think you can!\n\nYour money is at risk\n\nAre Crypto Apps Safe To Use?\n\nThe cryptocurrency industry has been the target of malicious groups. While they operate on autonomous and decentralized systems powered by blockchain networks, attackers often find loopholes in smart contracts and bridges, seizing unimaginable amounts of money from users\u2019 wallets. It\u2019s important to consider the security of your crypto apps before choosing an app to use. Ethereum and Bitcoin trading are the two most prominent coins, and we also have tons of tokens in the market. Investing or trading these coins comes with risk. Let\u2019s explore the safety of crypto apps:\n\nBefore you choose a crypto app, ensure that the app has grade-A level security protocols and does not have a long history of breaches: Apps like Crypto.com and MetaMask, are considered extremely safe because of the safety and security measures they explore in keeping user assets.\n\nCold wallets:\n\nWhile it is easier to transfer funds in hot wallets, cold wallets offer the best security. A crypto wallet or app should store its assets in a cold wallet \u2013 inaccessible online to hackers. When your assets are securely stored in a vault, it means that hackers cannot access your wallet through the portal.\n\nLicenses:\n\nA licensed crypto app beats an unlicensed one. No matter how promising an app is, you are subject to malpractices like pump and dumps, rug pull, and hacks if it is unlicensed. Also, when a crypto app is unlicensed, users are not under any user-protection contract; hence, funds lost are dead and gone.\n\nUser reviews:\n\nBefore choosing an app, check out their reviews on PlayStore. It\u2019s usually rare to see a crypto app with a 5-star review aggregate, but anywhere from 3.9 to 4.5 stars is good enough. Of course, the latter number is preferred.\n\nAustralian regulation\n\nThe Australian Securities and Investments Commission, ASIC, is the highest regulatory body for financial providers and financial asset collectors. It\u2019s important to use an app that is licensed by the ASIC. First, the ASIC puts financial institutions through an extreme vetting process, ensuring they have excellent security protocols and insurance policies protecting users. When you visit an exchange\u2019s \u2018Security\u2019 page, you see many industry lingoes. Some of these words and numbers are entirely impossible to decipher. An exchange can boast of a certain security feature, but it takes an expert to know real stuff from the shaft. An ASIC certification proves that an exchange or app is as secure as they claim they are.\n\nSecurity and privacy\n\nSecurity and privacy are two very important factors to consider before choosing an app. Let\u2019s take a look at the security features and privacy factors you must consider:\n\n2FA: A crypto app should always support two-factor authentication. The more complex the layers of authentication, the better. Some apps won\u2019t allow you to log into your account without authenticating your primary device. Other apps send codes to your email address and phone number. If an activity on your account raises suspicion, an app should be able to lock you out and request your private key before logging you back in. Other 2FA protocols include location \u2013 if you log in from an unusual location, a crypto app can log you out and request your private key before letting you gain access. Volume: If your withdrawal volume is disproportionate to your usual volume, an app\u2019s AI can spot this as a scam and request that you provide your private keys. Cold storage: Cold storage removes your wallet from online. When your wallet and assets are on the blockchain, it is online and susceptible to attacks from malicious scammers. When your assets are offline, it is impossible for an attacker to steal them through online measures. Data sharing: Apps like MetaMaks partner with multiple exchanges to find the best liquidity when you want to swap cryptocurrencies. While the process ensures that you get the most competitive prices at any given time, it may mean that MetaMask and the other DEXs have to share information. MetaMask has explicitly stated in its website that it values user privacy and doesn\u2019t share more-than-needed data; you may need to check the data privacy of other crypto apps to ensure that they do not share sensitive data with their partners.\n\nHow to spot a crypto app scam\n\nCrypto app scams have become a mainstay in the cryptocurrency industry. Scammers often employ different techniques to draw unsuspecting victims and siphon their funds. Let\u2019s take a look at activities that scream scam in the crypto industry.\n\nA shabby-looking website: Scam websites often have the same layout because most scammers are impatient and use scripts of other scam websites to lure people into registering their accounts. A scam website will lack a good home page, won\u2019t reveal the name of the founders of the project, and will have a poor layout. Websites like MetaMask, Binance, and Coinbase, are professionally built and have a simple layout. Leave the website immediately if the layout doesn\u2019t appeal to your sense of safety. Promise mouth-watering returns: Scam websites often promise their users mouth-watering returns like 33% to 44% APY on staking and investments. Cryptocurrency investment can have great returns, but the market is volatile, and no exchange or broker can boast of constant positive returns on investment. A website that promises to double your investment in a few days is certainly a scam. Even established brokers like Crypto.com promise an 8% APY after about a year of holding. Does not require identity verification: Scammers want you to quickly get to the payment page, so they skip many important elements a crypto website should have. One of those elements is identity verification and proof of address. It is illegal to allow an entity to trade without verifying the entity\u2019s identity. Any exchange or app that allows you to trade unverified is certainly not licensed by any major agency. You will be better off donating your funds to charity. No licenses: A crypto website that allows users worldwide to trade without proper licenses in trading regions is a scam site. Be careful! Scam sites are usually open to everyone in every country. Some of them are small time, so they do not fall under the radar of law enforcement; however, these websites can steal thousands and hundreds of thousands of dollars from unsuspecting victims. Spam calls and messages: Any website that claims that an expert will call you during the registration process is most likely a scam. First, a real website with good traffic won\u2019t invest that much in telemarketing. The cryptocurrency space is volatile, and authentic sites avoid telemarketing at all costs. If a crypto exchange calls or sends messages advising you to invest more, you may be in a scam ecosystem.\n\nOther tips to consider include the following:\n\nNever open a link or button in an email from unverified sources. Opening unverified or malicious links can make your device vulnerable to security attacks, including cryptojacking (your device will be used to mine cryptocurrencies). Ensure that you visit the correct URL of popular crypto apps. For example, metamask.io can be cunningly delivered as metamasks.io. The former is the correct MetaMask website URL. The latter, if it exists, is a phony website dressed like the actual MetaMask site.\n\nTop Tips for Using Ethereum Apps Safely Never share your passphrase Under no circumstance should you ever share your private key or passphrase. With your passphrase, scammers can lock you out of your wallet and withdraw every penny you have. Passphrase security tips include: Do not store your passphrase online. Instead, store it in a physical security box. Do not share your passphrase with friends or family members. Use a reliable internet connection A reliable and secure internet connection allows you to explore cryptocurrency applications without exposing yourself to vulnerabilities. Before logging into your crypto wallet, follow these security steps: Do not use public online access: When you browse on public wifi, scammers can mirror your online activity and gain access to valuable information like your wallet address and password. If you want to log into your MetaMask, ensure you do so on a public and secured network. Auto-filling your wallet address might be a bad idea. If a thief steals any of your devices (mobile or laptop), he can gain access to some of your wallets if he logs in through your device. This is because apps like Google and Dashlane lets you autofill passwords and email addresses. Instead of auto-filling, you can set password-saver apps to request for your fingerprint or facial recognition before providing the password. Read user reviews before signing up User reviews give you practical data on how a wallet or an exchange works. If an exchange has poor customer service or has frequent glitches, many users will use the review section of PlayStore or Apple Store to express their displeasure. If a wallet generally has negative reviews, you should find another decent one for your Ethereum storing and trading needs.
