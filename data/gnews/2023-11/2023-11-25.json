        "title": "Ethereum stakers 'terrified' of slashing. Company coalition looks to make it nearly impossible - DLNews",
        "content": "Slashing is a constant concern for Ethereum staking providers.\n\nCompany Cubist wants to use abstraction to prevent accidental slashing.\n\nDoing so skirts a fine line between keeping blockchains secure and making sure stakers are not unfairly punished.\n\nBitcoin Suisse, a company that provides staking services for institutional clients, encountered a serious problem earlier this month \u2014 a problem that unsettles other Ethereum stakers as well.\n\nIts newly deployed Ethereum validators \u2014 software that helps process transactions and secure the network in return for newly minted Ether \u2014 began getting \u201cslashed,\u201d a term that refers to taking some Ether from validators who don\u2019t publish the correct data to the Ethereum network.\n\nOver the course of almost two hours, nearly 100 of the firm\u2019s validators were knocked offline and fined one Ether each \u2014 an almost $200,000 loss at current prices \u2014 for trying to publish incorrect data.\n\nBitcoin Suisse did not immediately return DL News\u2019 request for comment.\n\nStay ahead of the game with our weekly newsletters Subscribe\n\nWhile slashing exists to punish people who try to attack or cheat Ethereum\u2019s validation system, it more commonly happens because of code bugs or human error.\n\nSince Ethereum started allowing users to stake in 2020, validators on the network have been slashed 400 times, per beaconcha.in data.\n\nWhile the financial damage caused by slashing on Ethereum has historically been much smaller than the losses from hacks or DeFi protocol bugs, many crypto security researchers worry that an event where thousands of validators are simultaneously slashed is a serious risk.\n\nAnd as the Ether staking market swelled to over $57 billion this year, that risk has only become more troubling.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nBitcoin Suisse is not the only Ethereum staking provider to suffer from slashing recently. In October, 20 Ethereum validators controlled by Lido, the biggest liquid staking protocol with over $18.5 billion of deposits, were slashed, resulting in a $30,000 hit. That incident was not the first time Lido\u2019s validators were slashed this year.\n\nLido's deposits climbed higher over the past year as Ethereum staking popularity soared\n\n\u201cEven very sophisticated experienced validator operators are still getting slashed,\u201d Ann Stefan, co-founder and COO of Cubist, a blockchain key management platform, told DL News in an interview.\n\n\u201cHaving best practices in place can really help prevent the incidence of these types of things from happening,\u201d Stefan said.\n\nBecause slashing can occur so easily, the fear of it happening is palpable among staking providers.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re all terrified of this,\u201d Fraser Brown, co-founder and CTO of Cubist, told DL News. \u201cThe way people get slashed in practice most of the time is they just make mistakes with their infrastructure.\u201d\n\nCubist has teamed up with 16 other crypto firms and protocols including Redacted, Swell, and EigenLayer to form the Secure Staking Alliance, a cross-industry partnership with the goal of making crypto staking more secure.\n\nWithin the alliance, Cubist is trying to solve the problem of slashing once and for all by making it almost impossible for stakers to be slashed accidentally.\n\nBut doing so skirts a fine line between keeping blockchains secure and making sure stakers are not unfairly punished.\n\nSlashing serves an important purpose by protecting Ethereum from attack. But the stringent security comes with a downside \u2014 it\u2019s easy for honest stakers to be slashed if they make a mistake.\n\n\u201cWe ended up with this tension where the fundamental security mechanism of Ethereum is actually the fundamental insecurity mechanism for validator node operators,\u201d Brown said.\n\nSolving slashing\n\nCubist\u2019s solution to accidental slashing is to create a layer of abstraction that validators must go through to sign off on the data they send to the Ethereum network.\n\nBlockchains like Ethereum are very similar to databases where the current state must follow on from the previous state. If a validator tries to publish an incorrect state it gets slashed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a database. The problem is databases are actually kind of hard,\u201d Brown said. \u201cIf you\u2019re running a whole bunch of validators, you have to have a global scalable database for every validator key. That\u2019s something you can get wrong.\u201d\n\nWhat Cubist proposes is that all validator clients must send messages to another piece of software \u2014 which Brown refers to as a \u201csky key\u201d \u2014 that is better equipped to make sure the validator\u2019s messages contain the correct data.\n\nAccording to Brown, as long as the sky key has serious slashing protection, the validators that rely on it will also be safe.\n\n\u201cYou just have to get all the hard database stuff right once and then all requests just go through that key,\u201d Brown said.\n\nTo make sure multiple validators aren\u2019t relying on the same abstracted key, Cubist deploys a separate instance for each validator. \u201cIf you have 100 validators there are 100 keys in the sky. One for each,\u201d Brown said.\n\nBeyond Ethereum staking\n\nWhile Cubist\u2019s slashing solution is most relevant to Ethereum, the most popular proof of stake blockchain, it is also relevant to other areas of staking.\n\nOne area which has previously drawn concern from Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin is restaking \u2014 an upcoming blockchain feature that will allow users to double-stake their Ether on other protocols and blockchains.\n\nCubist has signed partnerships with both EigenLayer and Babylon \u2014 two restaking protocols \u2014 specifically to focus on protecting their ecosystems from slashing.\n\nAccording to Stefan, protocols like these all have unique slashing conditions, which presents an additional layer of complexity. \u201cIt\u2019s even more important to have anti-slashers in place on these risk taking protocols,\u201d she said.\n\nAnd while Stefan and Brown say they are confident in Cubist\u2019s anti-slashing standards, they are also mindful of the risk of having all stakers rely on only their specific implementations.\n\n\u201cThe standards are not saying, \u2018You must use this setup, you must use this hardware,\u2019\u201d Stefan said. The message is, she added, here\u2019s how to set up your infrastructure if you want to have the best chance of not messing up.\n\nTim Craig is DL News\u2019 Edinburgh-based DeFi Correspondent.

        "title": "Ethereum vs Cosmos: Understanding the Differences - Blockgeeks",
        "content": "Imagine a world where you could seamlessly transfer digital assets across different blockchains using a smart contract platform, without any friction or limitations. With this smart contract development, cryptocurrencies can be easily transferred between different platforms. It sounds like something out of a sci-fi movie, but this article discusses the high security impact of a project. Well, that\u2019s exactly what Ethereum vs Cosmos are striving to achieve in the realm of specific blockchains and crypto. They are focused on improving transaction speed with the help of tendermint.\n\nBoth Ethereum and Cosmos have their own unique approaches to scalability, interoperability, governance, and the sovereign blockchain project. The Ethereum blockchain network focuses on scalability and interoperability, while the Cosmos blockchain network emphasizes governance and the crypto project. Understanding the strengths and weaknesses of the ethereum network, crypto, and tendermint is crucial for anyone looking to navigate the ever-evolving landscape of blockchain technology and maximize their rewards.\n\nSo whether you\u2019re an investor seeking promising crypto opportunities or simply curious about the future of decentralized networks, join us as we explore the clash of these crypto titans \u2013 Ethereum vs Cosmos. Discover the potential of tendermint, atom, and rollups.\n\nOrigins of Ethereum and Cosmos\n\nEthereum: Revolutionizing the Blockchain Game\n\nEthereum burst onto the scene in 2015, introducing a groundbreaking concept to the world of blockchain technology. The Ethereum network operates through the use of atoms, which are the fundamental units of the blockchain. Additionally, Ethereum has paved the way for the development of cosmos chains and rollups, revolutionizing the scalability and efficiency of blockchain transactions.

The Ethereum network operates through the use of atoms, which are the fundamental units of the blockchain. Additionally, Ethereum has paved the way for the development of cosmos chains and rollups, revolutionizing the scalability and efficiency of blockchain transactions. Created by Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum aimed to go beyond Bitcoin\u2018s capabilities as a mere digital currency in the cosmos blockchain. It sought to provide a platform for developers to build decentralized applications (dApps) and execute smart contracts on the ethereum network, including ethereum l2s and cosmos chains, using the atom token.\n\nWith its native cryptocurrency called Ether (ETH) and the innovative use of the atom, Ethereum quickly gained popularity among developers and investors alike. The ethereum network, with its robust infrastructure, enabled the creation of innovative projects, including decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Ethereum L2s and atoms have also contributed to this ecosystem. Ethereum, the atom of innovation and disruption, became synonymous with the blockchain space.\n\nCosmos: Bridging Blockchains Together\n\nWhile Ethereum and Atom were making waves, another project was quietly brewing in the background. Enter Cosmos, an ambitious endeavor founded by Jae Kwon. The goal? To create an interconnected network of blockchains that could communicate and share information seamlessly, we can utilize the power of atom.\n\nCosmos introduced a novel concept known as \u201cinteroperability,\u201d which essentially means enabling different blockchains, including the atom, to interact with one another. This approach aimed to address one of the biggest challenges facing blockchain technology: siloed networks that operate independently without any means of collaboration. The solution involved implementing an atom, which allowed for seamless communication and collaboration between these independent networks. The solution involved implementing an atom, which allowed for seamless communication and collaboration between these independent networks. The solution involved implementing an atom, which allowed for seamless communication and collaboration between these independent networks.\n\nBy utilizing its native cryptocurrency called ATOM, Cosmos set out to build an ecosystem where multiple blockchains could coexist and exchange data securely and efficiently. This vision of connecting existing blockchain platforms together while preserving their autonomy attracted attention from developers looking for ways to bridge them using the atom.\n\nThe Clash: Ethereum vs. Cosmos\n\nNow that we have a glimpse into the origins of both Ethereum and Cosmos, let\u2019s dive into how they differ from each other. One key difference is that Ethereum focuses on smart contracts, while Cosmos is built on the concept of an atom. One key difference is that Ethereum focuses on smart contracts, while Cosmos is built on the concept of an atom. One key difference is that Ethereum focuses on smart contracts, while Cosmos is built on the concept of an atom.\n\nEthereum focuses on providing a comprehensive platform for building dApps and executing smart contracts within its own ecosystem. It has established itself as the go-to choice for developers looking to leverage blockchain technology for various use cases. With its vast array of tools, libraries, and community support, Ethereum has become the foundation for numerous successful projects.\n\nOn the other hand, Cosmos takes a different approach by prioritizing interoperability. It aims to create an interconnected network of blockchains that can communicate seamlessly with one another. This allows developers to leverage the unique features and capabilities of different blockchains while still benefiting from a shared ecosystem.\n\nWhile Ethereum remains the dominant force in terms of adoption and market capitalization, Cosmos presents an intriguing alternative for those seeking to bridge multiple blockchain platforms together. Its focus on interoperability opens up new possibilities for collaboration and innovation across various blockchain networks.\n\nExamination of Scalability and Performance\n\nScalability: A Key Factor in Blockchain Networks\n\nScalability is a crucial aspect when evaluating the potential of blockchain networks. It refers to the ability of a network to handle an increasing number of transactions efficiently without compromising its performance. In this regard, both Ethereum and Cosmos have implemented different approaches.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Approach to Scalability\n\nEthereum, being one of the pioneering blockchain platforms, has faced scalability challenges due to its design. Its current consensus mechanism, known as Proof of Work (PoW), requires extensive computational power and time-consuming processes for transaction validation. As a result, Ethereum has experienced issues with network congestion and high transaction fees during periods of increased activity.\n\nTo address these concerns, Ethereum is transitioning towards Ethereum 2.0, which introduces a new consensus mechanism called Proof of Stake (PoS). This upgrade aims to enhance scalability by allowing validators to create new blocks based on their stake in the network rather than relying solely on computational power. By doing so, Ethereum hopes to increase its transaction throughput significantly and reduce fees.\n\nCosmos\u2019 Approach to Scalability\n\nCosmos takes a different approach to scalability through its innovative architecture known as the Cosmos Network. Rather than focusing on scaling a single blockchain like Ethereum does, Cosmos enables the creation of multiple interconnected blockchains called \u201czones.\u201d These zones can operate independently while still being able to communicate with each other through the central hub called the \u201cCosmos Hub.\n\nThis modular design allows for horizontal scalability since each zone can process transactions independently and in parallel. Moreover, Cosmos utilizes a consensus algorithm called Tendermint BFT (Byzantine Fault Tolerance), which provides fast finality for transactions while maintaining security.\n\nPerformance: Speed and Efficiency Comparison\n\nSpeed and efficiency play vital roles in determining the usability and practicality of blockchain networks.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Performance Metrics\n\nEthereum\u2018s current architecture faces challenges in terms of transaction speed and efficiency. The PoW consensus mechanism, as mentioned earlier, requires significant computational resources and time for block validation. As a result, Ethereum\u2018s average block time is around 15 seconds, which can lead to delays in transaction confirmations during periods of high network congestion.\n\nHowever, with the upcoming transition to Ethereum 2.0 and the implementation of PoS, the network aims to achieve faster block times and improved efficiency. This upgrade could potentially reduce transaction confirmation times significantly and enhance overall performance.\n\nCosmos\u2019 Performance Metrics\n\nCosmos boasts impressive performance metrics due to its unique design and consensus algorithm. Tendermint BFT allows for fast finality, enabling transactions to be confirmed quickly with a high level of security.\n\nInteroperability Across Networks\n\nInteroperability, a fancy word that basically means the ability of different computer systems or networks to work together smoothly. In the world of blockchain, it refers to the capability of different blockchains to communicate and share information with each other. Now, let\u2019s dive into how Ethereum and Cosmos stack up.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Approach\n\nEthereum, one of the most well-known blockchain platforms out there, has been primarily focused on its own ecosystem. It has built a strong network of decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts. However,Ethereum has faced some challenges.\n\nOne solution that Ethereum has come up with is the concept of \u201cbridges.\u201d These bridges act as connectors between Ethereum and other blockchains, allowing for the transfer of assets and information. For example, projects like Polkadot and Chainlink have developed bridge technologies that enable cross-chain communication with Ethereum.\n\nCosmos\u2019 Solution\n\nOn the other hand, Cosmos takes a different approach to interoperability. Cosmos aims to create an interconnected network of independent blockchains called \u201czones\u201d that can communicate seamlessly with each other through a central hub called the \u201cCosmos Hub.\u201d\n\nThe Cosmos Hub acts as a relay chain that facilitates communication between various zones within the Cosmos ecosystem. This hub utilizes a technology called Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC), which allows for secure and efficient transfer of assets and data across different chains.\n\nComparing the Approaches\n\nWhen comparing Ethereum\u2018s bridge-based approach with Cosmos\u2019 IBC technology, there are some notable differences. While bridges provide a way for Ethereum to connect with external chains, they often require custom development for each specific connection. This can be time-consuming and may lead to compatibility issues.\n\nOn the other hand, Cosmos\u2019 IBC offers a more standardized approach to interoperability by providing a universal protocol for communication between chains. This means that any blockchain built on the Cosmos SDK can easily connect and communicate with other chains within the Cosmos ecosystem.\n\nThe Benefits of Interoperability\n\nHaving interoperability across networks brings several benefits to the blockchain space. First and foremost, it allows for the seamless transfer of assets between different blockchains. This opens up new possibilities for decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, as users can easily move their assets from one chain to another.\n\nInteroperability also promotes collaboration and innovation by enabling developers to leverage functionalities from multiple blockchains. For example, a developer could build a dApp that utilizes smart contracts from Ethereum while leveraging the scalability features of another blockchain like Cosmos.\n\nSmart Contract Capabilities Compared\n\nEthereum: The Pioneer of Smart Contracts\n\nEthereum, often hailed as the pioneer of smart contracts, revolutionized the blockchain industry with its ability to execute self-executing contracts without intermediaries. With Ethereum, developers can create decentralized applications (DApps) and deploy smart contracts that automatically execute predefined conditions.\n\nSmart contracts on Ethereum are written in Solidity, a programming language specifically designed for this purpose. These contracts are executed on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), a runtime environment that ensures their secure and reliable execution.\n\nOne of the key advantages of Ethereum\u2018s smart contract capabilities is its vast ecosystem. It has gained widespread adoption and support from developers worldwide, resulting in a rich collection of DApps and decentralized finance (DeFi) projects built on the platform. This extensive ecosystem offers users a wide range of options for interacting with different services and applications.\n\nCosmos: Enabling Interoperability\n\nWhile Ethereum paved the way for smart contracts, Cosmos takes it a step further by focusing on interoperability between different blockchains. It introduces the concept of \u201cinter-blockchain communication\u201d (IBC), which enables seamless transfer of assets and data across multiple chains within the Cosmos network.\n\nCosmos provides developers with an SDK called \u201cCosmos SDK,\u201d which allows them to build their own customized blockchains known as \u201czones.\u201d These zones can then connect to the Cosmos Hub, forming an interconnected network where transactions can be routed between different chains.\n\nWith Cosmos\u2019 smart contract capabilities, developers can create custom modules using programming languages like Golang or Rust. These modules enable specific functionalities within their zones while still benefiting from cross-chain communication facilitated by IBC.\n\nComparing Smart Contract Capabilities\n\nWhen comparing Ethereum and Cosmos in terms of smart contract capabilities, it\u2019s important to consider their respective strengths:\n\nFunctionality : Ethereum offers a more mature ecosystem for developing complex DApps and executing sophisticated smart contracts. Its extensive tooling and libraries provide developers with a wide range of options for building decentralized applications.\n\nInteroperability : While Ethereum focuses primarily on its own network, Cosmos prioritizes interoperability between different blockchains. This allows for the seamless transfer of assets and data across multiple chains within the Cosmos ecosystem, enabling greater flexibility and scalability.\n\nProgramming Languages: Ethereum uses Solidity as its primary programming language, which has gained significant popularity among developers. On the other hand, Cosmos supports various programming languages like Golang and Rust, providing developers with more flexibility in choosing their preferred language.\n\nConsensus Mechanisms Unveiled\n\nProof of Stake (PoS) vs. Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT)\n\nConsensus mechanisms play a crucial role in the functioning of blockchain networks like Ethereum and Cosmos. Ethereum primarily relies on the Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, while Cosmos utilizes the Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) consensus mechanism.\n\nProof of Stake (PoS)\n\nIn the world of Ethereum, PoS is the name of the game. This consensus mechanism allows participants to validate transactions and create new blocks based on their stake or ownership of cryptocurrency tokens. In simpler terms, the more tokens you hold, the more power you have in validating transactions and securing the network.\n\nWith PoS, there\u2019s no need for energy-intensive mining rigs like in Bitcoin\u2018s Proof of Work (PoW). Instead, validators are chosen randomly to create new blocks and validate transactions based on their token holdings. The idea behind PoS is that it incentivizes participants to act honestly since they have something at stake \u2014 their own tokens.\n\nByzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT)\n\nOn the other hand, Cosmos takes a different approach with its BFT consensus mechanism. BFT is designed to address potential issues related to malicious actors or nodes within a network. It ensures that even if some nodes behave dishonestly or experience failures, overall network security and reliability remain intact.\n\nThe BFT consensus algorithm relies on a voting process where validators reach agreement before adding new blocks to the chain. Validators propose blocks and vote on whether they should be added or not. To achieve consensus, a certain threshold of votes is required.\n\nScalability: Sharding vs. Interoperability\n\nAnother important aspect when comparing Ethereum and Cosmos is scalability \u2013 how well these networks can handle an increasing number of users and transactions.\n\nSharding\n\nEthereum aims to tackle scalability challenges through sharding \u2013 breaking down its network into smaller, more manageable pieces called shards. Each shard can process its own transactions and smart contracts independently, which allows for parallel processing and increased throughput.\n\nThe idea behind sharding is to divide the workload among different shards, reducing congestion and improving overall network performance. This approach has the potential to significantly increase Ethereum\u2018s scalability and accommodate a larger user base.\n\nInteroperability\n\nCosmos takes a different approach to scalability by prioritizing interoperability between different blockchains. It aims to create an \u201cInternet of Blockchains\u201d where various chains can communicate and interact seamlessly.\n\nBy enabling cross-chain communication, Cosmos allows developers to build applications that can leverage the capabilities of multiple blockchains simultaneously. This interoperability not only enhances scalability but also promotes collaboration and innovation in the blockchain ecosystem.\n\nDiverse Use Cases Explored\n\nDecentralized Finance (DeFi)\n\nEthereum and Cosmos are both platforms that have seen significant adoption in the realm of decentralized finance (DeFi). Ethereum, with its smart contract capabilities, has been the go-to platform for developers looking to build DeFi applications. It has paved the way for innovations such as decentralized exchanges, lending platforms, and yield farming protocols. However, Ethereum\u2018s scalability limitations have become apparent as network congestion and high gas fees plague its ecosystem.\n\nCosmos, on the other hand, offers a solution to this scalability challenge through its inter-blockchain communication protocol (IBC). This allows different blockchains within the Cosmos ecosystem to communicate and share assets seamlessly. With its focus on scalability and interoperability, Cosmos provides an alternative platform for DeFi developers to explore.\n\nCross-Chain Interoperability\n\nOne of the key differentiators between Ethereum and Cosmos is their approach to cross-chain interoperability. While Ethereum primarily operates as a single blockchain network, Cosmos takes a more modular approach by enabling multiple independent blockchains to connect with each other through its IBC protocol.\n\nThis cross-chain interoperability opens up new possibilities for developers and users alike. It allows assets to be transferred across different blockchains without relying on centralized exchanges or custodians. For example, users can transfer their ERC-20 tokens from Ethereum to Cosmos-based chains or vice versa seamlessly. This interoperability also enables developers to leverage functionalities from different blockchains and create innovative applications that were not possible before.\n\nScalability Solutions\n\nScalability has long been a challenge for blockchain networks like Ethereum. As more users join the network and demand increases, congestion occurs, leading to slower transaction times and higher fees. To address this issue, both Ethereum and Cosmos have implemented various scalability solutions.\n\nEthereum is currently undergoing a transition from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism through the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade. This shift aims to improve scalability by introducing shard chains, which will allow the network to process transactions in parallel.\n\nCosmos, on the other hand, tackles scalability through its hub-and-zone architecture. The Cosmos Hub acts as a central hub that connects different zones or blockchains within the ecosystem. Each zone can operate independently and handle its own transactions, significantly increasing scalability.\n\nNiche Applications\n\nWhile Ethereum has gained widespread adoption and is often associated with DeFi applications, Cosmos has found its niche in specific industries and use cases. For instance, Cosmos has seen success in gaming and non-fungible token (NFT) markets.\n\nEthereum and Cosmos in the Blockchain Trilemma\n\nDiverse Use Cases Explored\n\nIn the previous section, we delved into the diverse use cases of both Ethereum and Cosmos. Now let\u2019s explore how these two blockchain platforms address the challenges posed by the Blockchain Trilemma.\n\nScalability: Tackling the Need for Speed\n\nScalability is a crucial factor in determining a blockchain platform\u2019s success. Ethereum, with its proof-of-work consensus mechanism, has faced scalability issues due to its limited transaction processing capacity. As more users join the network and demand increases, congestion occurs, resulting in higher fees and slower transactions.\n\nOn the other hand, Cosmos takes a different approach to scalability. It utilizes a modular architecture that allows for multiple interconnected blockchains known as \u201czones.\u201d These zones can process transactions independently, reducing congestion and increasing overall scalability. By enabling interoperability between different chains through its Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol, Cosmos aims to create an internet of blockchains where data can flow seamlessly between different networks.\n\nSecurity: Safeguarding Assets and Transactions\n\nSecurity is paramount in any blockchain ecosystem. Ethereum has established itself as a secure platform over time but still faces occasional vulnerabilities due to its complex smart contract system. While efforts are being made to enhance security through upgrades like Ethereum 2.0 and layer-two solutions such as Optimism and Arbitrum, it remains an ongoing challenge.\n\nCosmos addresses security concerns by implementing a Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus algorithm called Tendermint Core. This consensus mechanism ensures that all nodes within the network agree on the state of transactions, providing robust security against malicious actors or potential attacks.\n\nDecentralization: Empowering Network Participants\n\nDecentralization lies at the heart of blockchain technology, ensuring that power is distributed among network participants rather than concentrated in a single entity\u2019s hands. Ethereum initially achieved significant decentralization but has faced challenges as large mining pools and powerful stakeholders have emerged, potentially impacting the network\u2019s overall governance.\n\nCosmos embraces decentralization by allowing independent blockchains to operate within its ecosystem. Each zone in Cosmos can have its own governance model, enabling participants to have a say in the decision-making process. By fostering a more inclusive and decentralized environment, Cosmos aims to empower users and prevent centralization concerns from arising.\n\nBridging the Gap: Interoperability and Cross-Chain Communication\n\nOne of the key differentiators between Ethereum and Cosmos is their approach to interoperability. Ethereum primarily focuses on building applications within its ecosystem, while Cosmos emphasizes cross-chain communication through its IBC protocol.\n\nGovernance Models and Community Influence\n\nGovernance models play a crucial role in the functioning of blockchain networks like Ethereum and Cosmos. These models determine how decisions are made, rules are enforced, and upgrades are implemented within the respective ecosystems. Community influence is an essential aspect that shapes the direction and growth of these networks.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Governance Model\n\nEthereum follows a decentralized governance model where decisions are made through a process called on-chain governance. This means that stakeholders can participate in decision-making by voting on proposals using their tokens. The Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) system allows anyone to submit proposals for changes or upgrades to the network.\n\nThe community\u2019s influence on Ethereum is significant, as it relies heavily on active participation from developers, miners, token holders, and other stakeholders. This decentralized approach ensures that decisions are made collectively and reflects the will of the majority.\n\nCosmos\u2019 Governance Model\n\nIn contrast to Ethereum, Cosmos employs an innovative governance model known as Tendermint Core-based Proof-of-Stake (PoS). It combines elements of both off-chain and on-chain governance. Validators in the network propose and vote on changes through an off-chain process. If a proposal receives enough votes from validators, it moves to an on-chain voting phase where token holders can cast their votes.\n\nCosmos\u2019 governance model emphasizes community involvement while maintaining efficiency by separating off-chain deliberation from on-chain execution. This approach enables faster decision-making without compromising security or scalability.\n\nCommunity Influence\n\nBoth Ethereum and Cosmos place great importance on community influence. The communities surrounding these networks actively participate in discussions, debates, and voting processes to express their preferences for upgrades or changes.\n\nIn Ethereum\u2018s case, its large user base contributes to a diverse range of opinions regarding proposed improvements or protocol changes. This diversity fosters innovation but can also lead to heated debates within the community before reaching consensus.\n\nSimilarly, Cosmos encourages active participation from its community through the governance process. Validators and token holders have the opportunity to voice their opinions and vote on proposals, ensuring a democratic decision-making system.\n\nThe influence of the community is crucial in maintaining the decentralization and security of these networks. It ensures that decisions are not solely made by a centralized authority but reflect the collective interests of stakeholders.\n\nTo summarize, Ethereum and Cosmos employ different governance models that prioritize community involvement in decision-making processes. Ethereum relies on on-chain governance, where stakeholders vote on proposals, while Cosmos combines off-chain and on-chain processes through its Tendermint Core-based PoS model. Community influence plays a vital role in shaping the direction and growth of both networks, ensuring decentralized decision-making and reflecting the will of the majority.\n\nAdvantages of Ethereum and Cosmos\n\nScalability and Interoperability\n\nEthereum and Cosmos offer distinct advantages.\n\nScalability: Ethereum has been the go-to platform for decentralized applications (DApps) and smart contracts, but its scalability has been a concern. However, with the introduction of Ethereum 2.0, also known as ETH2 or Serenity, the network aims to address this issue by implementing a new consensus algorithm called Proof-of-Stake (PoS). This upgrade is expected to significantly improve scalability by increasing transaction throughput.\n\nOn the other hand, Cosmos takes a different approach to achieve scalability through its unique architecture. It employs a hub-and-spoke model where multiple independent blockchains, known as zones, are connected to a central blockchain called the Cosmos Hub. This design allows for horizontal scaling as each zone can process transactions independently while still being able to communicate with other zones on the network.\n\nInteroperability: One of the key advantages of Cosmos is its focus on interoperability. The Cosmos Network enables seamless communication between different blockchains by utilizing the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol. This means that applications built on one blockchain within the Cosmos ecosystem can easily interact with those on other blockchains in a secure and efficient manner.\n\nEthereum also recognizes the importance of interoperability and has made efforts towards achieving it through projects like Polkadot and Chainlink. These collaborations aim to connect different blockchains together and enable cross-chain functionality.\n\nDeveloper Ecosystem\n\nBoth Ethereum and Cosmos boast vibrant developer ecosystems that contribute to their growth and innovation.\n\nEthereum: As one of the first platforms to introduce smart contracts, Ethereum has attracted a large community of developers who have built an extensive range of DApps across various industries such as finance, gaming, decentralized finance (DeFi), and more. The availability of Solidity as a programming language and the extensive documentation provided by Ethereum make it easier for developers to get started and build on the platform.\n\nCosmos: While Cosmos is relatively newer compared to Ethereum, it has quickly gained traction among developers due to its unique architecture and focus on interoperability. The Cosmos SDK provides a comprehensive framework for building custom blockchains and DApps within the Cosmos ecosystem. This flexibility allows developers to tailor their applications to specific use cases while benefiting from the security and scalability offered by the Cosmos Hub.\n\nUse Cases\n\nBoth Ethereum and Cosmos have demonstrated their versatility through a wide range of real-world use cases.\n\nEthereum\n\nConclusion and Final Thoughts\n\nWe delved into their origins, scalability, interoperability, smart contract capabilities, consensus mechanisms, use cases, governance models, and advantages. Through this examination, we discovered that while Ethereum has established itself as a dominant force in the blockchain space, Cosmos offers unique solutions to address some of its limitations.\n\nBoth Ethereum and Cosmos have their strengths and weaknesses, catering to different needs within the blockchain ecosystem. Ethereum\u2018s robust smart contract capabilities and vast developer community make it an ideal choice for decentralized applications. On the other hand, Cosmos provides a scalable and interoperable framework for building interconnected blockchains.\n\nAs you consider which platform aligns with your goals and requirements, it\u2019s important to weigh the trade-offs and understand the specific use cases each platform excels at. Whether you choose Ethereum or Cosmos, both platforms contribute significantly to the advancement of blockchain technology. So dive deeper into their ecosystems, explore their communities, and embark on your journey toward building innovative decentralized solutions.\n\nFAQs\n\nWhat is the difference between Ethereum and Cosmos?\n\nEthereum is a blockchain platform that enables developers to build decentralized applications, while Cosmos is an ecosystem of interconnected blockchains. Ethereum focuses on smart contracts and has its own native cryptocurrency (Ether), whereas Cosmos aims to facilitate communication between different blockchains.\n\nWhich blockchain offers better scalability, Ethereum or Cosmos?\n\nCosmos has a unique architecture that allows for horizontal scalability by connecting multiple blockchains through its Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol. On the other hand, Ethereum is currently transitioning from Proof of Work (PoW) to Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism to improve scalability. Both projects are actively working on enhancing their scalability solutions.\n\nCan I use Ethereum-based tokens on the Cosmos network?\n\nNo, you cannot directly use Ethereum-based tokens on the Cosmos network. However, there are bridge technologies being developed that aim to enable interoperability between different blockchains, including Ethereum and Cosmos. These bridges would allow for cross-chain token transfers and interactions.\n\nWhich blockchain has a larger developer community, Ethereum or Cosmos?\n\nCurrently, Ethereum has a larger developer community due to its longer history and widespread adoption. It has a vast ecosystem of developers building applications and contributing to its open-source projects. However, as Cosmos continues to grow in popularity and attract more developers, its community is also expanding rapidly.\n\nIs it possible for Ethereum and Cosmos to collaborate or work together?\n\nYes, collaboration between Ethereum and Cosmos is indeed possible. In fact, there have been discussions around potential integration between the two ecosystems.

At press time, ETH exchanged hands at $2,068.\n\nThe bears are under attack\n\nETH\u2019s rally above $2000 coincided with the comeback of green histogram bars on its Awesome Oscillator indicator.\n\nAMBCrypto found that while ETH lingered in a tight price range, it\u2019s Awesome Oscillator returned only red upward-facing bars. This highlighted the state of indecision and low trading activity in the market.\n\nHowever, with the uptick in new demand recorded in the past few days, the green upward-facing bars of ETH\u2019s Awesome Oscillator signaled that the alt\u2019s price is likely to continue to see growth.\n\nGreen upward-facing bars in the Awesome Oscillator are typically seen after a period of consolidation or a pullback. They indicate that the buyers are taking control of the market and that the price rally might continue.\n\nAlso confirming the re-emergence of bullish sentiment, the MACD line of ETH\u2019s Moving average convergence divergence (MACD) indicator was poised to cross above its trend line at press time.\n\nWhen the MACD line of an asset\u2019s MACD indicator is geared to cross above the trend line, it is considered a bullish signal. This means that the momentum of the price is shifting from negative to positive and that the price rally is likely to continue.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ETHs worth today?\n\nETH holders continue to turn a profit\n\nWhile its price consolidated within a tight range, its Market Value To Realized Value ratio (MVRV) remained positive. This meant that investors who sold did so above their cost basis, seeing profit.\n\nAt press time, ETH\u2019s MVRV ratio was 35.02%. This indicated that, given its present value, coin holders would see a minimum of 35% return on their investments if they chose to sell now."

        "title": "Ethereum vs Cardano: Key Differences to Watch Out - CoinGape",
        "content": "Key Takeaways Investing in Ethereum or Cardano depends on your investment preferences and risk appetite.\n\nTransaction fees and transaction speed must be considered before investing in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nThe cryptocurrency market has grown tremendously in terms of user penetration and revenue generation. Revenues are projected to reach US $37.9B in 2023, although these digital currencies are often associated with volatility and uncertainty. Multiple blockchain platforms are there in the crypto market offering different currencies. However, the two cryptocurrencies that have gained the limelight over the years are Ethereum and Cardano. Both of them rank among the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. This is not the only reason to invest in cryptos. This article will discuss similarities and key differences between Ethereum and Cardano\u2013 the two major cryptocurrencies, so you can make an informed investment decision.\n\nUnderstanding Ethereum and Cardano Ethereum in Brief Ethereum is a network of computers across the globe that follows the Ethereum protocol. It is a community-run technology that operates on blockchain to enable smart contracts and crypto trading. It is one of the best altcoins to invest your money in. Ethereum\u2019s History and Vision Ethereum was created by Vitalik Buterin in 2013 but gained public awareness in 2014 after the Bitcoin Conference in Miami, Florida. It promotes itself as a peer-to-peer network that can be used by anyone interested in coordinating globally, creating organizations, building apps, and sharing values. Ethereum cryptocurrency, Ether, can be used for digital global payments. Cardano in Brief Cardano defines itself as the first blockchain platform to be developed through peer-reviewed research. It offers unparalleled security to its users and helps them ease transactions and exchanges & provides a system for organizations to grow. It works on the famous Proof-of-stake model (PoS), with a distinctive two-layer structure. Cardano\u2019s History and Vision Cardano was developed by Charles Hoskinson and Jeremy Wood in 2017. Charles was one of the co-founders of Ethereum. During its launch, this highly valued cryptocurrency created 31 billion tokens. It also raised $60M+ during the initial coin offering in 2017. Cardano\u2019s core vision is to disrupt the way blockchains reach consensus so they utilize a proof-of-stake called Ouroboros to be the most environmentally sustainable blockchain platform.\n\nEthereum vs Cardano: Key Parameters for Comparison The key differences between Ethereum and Cardano blockchain platforms lie in their credibility, ability to process high-volume transactions, and other parameters. Here is a comparative analysis between the two. Points of Difference Cardano Ethereum Token The supply of Cardano cannot exceed the maximum cap set at 45 billion coins. Ethereum has not set any upper restrictions on token supply. In contrast, its supply is set to increase at a fixed rate of 4.5% annually. Transaction Speed Cardano provides a transaction speed of approximately 250 per second. The transaction speed lies between 15 seconds to 5 minutes for Ethereum. Transaction Fees The transaction fee stands at 0.16 USD. The average transaction fee is approximately 1.164 USD. Nodes Cardano also operates on three nodes that take care of crypto transactions, help participate in blockchain governance, and send information between mCore nodes and the public internet. Ethereum works on three popular nodes to run its operations smoothly. These nodes include light, full, and archive nodes. Each node has its function ranging from ensuring accuracy to containing transaction data and history from previous blocks. Scalability Cardano is more flexible than Ethereum and can handle more transaction volumes. Ethereum cannot handle more transactions and the system faces a lag when more investors use the platform at the same time.\n\nFuture Outlook: Which Altcoin is a Better Investment? Whether to invest your money in Ethereum vs Cardano depends on your investment preferences and risk appetite. However, crypto experts believe that investing in Ethereum is more beneficial because of the support it gets from its developer community and large ecosystem. In contrast, investment in Cardano can go high for long-term acquisitions as it is growing in emerging markets. The popularity of this crypto depends on the support it is getting in from its growing user base. However, you need to wait a while to see how it will impact the growth and prices of Cardano.\n\nConclusion Investment in cryptocurrencies might be risky because of market volatility. However, having proper knowledge of different currencies might help you make a better decision. If you are looking to park your funds in the top cryptos, understanding the Ethereum vs Cardano differences helps you learn which crypto is suitable for your investment."

        "content": "Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson recently gave a sarcastic response to the plans to redesign Ethereum staking structure by Vitalik Buterin.\n\nAs two protocols that offer similar value propositions, Charles Hoskinson\u2019s latest reaction to Ethereum\u2019s grand staking plans proves the Cardano founder still believes in the former\u2019s design flaws.\n\nDespite ranking below Ethereum in market capitalization, Cardano\u2019s founder often touts the protocol\u2019s liquid staking offering as the de facto standard for judging a decentralized system.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe Ethereum Staking Plans\n\nSpeaking at an event in Turkey, Vitalik Buterin admitted that the centralized nature of Ethereum is not ideal. Notably, he called out the multiple staking pools model and acknowledged Ethereum\u2019s \u201csolo staking being hard.\u201d According to Vitalik Buterin, there is a need to tackle these challenges via the unspent transaction (UTxO) approach.\n\nStaking in the crypto ecosystem is a volatile concept in relation to regulatory allowance. Earlier this year, Kraken paid $30 million to settle a legal case with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for offering staking as an unregistered investment contract.\n\nSince then, Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain protocols started exploring how to change the nature of their Staking features. The plan to redesign the Staking service came as soon as Ethereum transitioned from its Proof-of-Work (PoW) system to PoS.\n\nThough the SEC has not flagged the protocol in this regard, Vitalik Buterin\u2019s proposition to decentralize the offering could make it less susceptible to falling under the regulator\u2019s radar.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nCardano Founder and Community\u2019s Position\n\nDesigned as an Ethereum killer with a mission to help cut on cost and speed of transactions, Charles Hoskinson takes every opportunity to sing Cardano\u2019s praises.\n\nNotably, his simple response to Vitalik Buterin\u2019s proposition reads: \u201cNo worries, Ethereum 3 will have it all sorted.\u201d\n\nEthereum 1 is generally denoted as the PoW era and Ethereum 2.0 is the current stage with a PoS consensus mechanism. Neither Vitalik Buterin nor the Ethereum Foundation has hinted at any potential Ethereum 3 in the future.\n\nThe fight for dominance continues and though Cardano seems ahead in most of the innovations Ethereum plans to implement, as community members pointed out, the DeFi Total Value Locked (TVL) of both protocols shows Cardano has a long way to go before catching up with Ethereum."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nRecently announced Ethereum layer-2 scaling network Blast, led by the founder of top NFT marketplace Blur, has pulled in over half a billion dollars worth of locked funds from users seeking yield and rewards\u2014but also faced substantial criticism over its rollout. And now early investor Paradigm has joined the list of parties with issues over the launch.\n\nOn Sunday, Paradigm Head of Research and General Partner Dan Robinson shared a post on X (aka Twitter) that took Blast\u2019s launch to task, attributing his comments to \u201cwe at Paradigm,\u201d suggesting it conveyed the prominent crypto-centric venture capital firm\u2019s stance.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of components of Blast that I\u2019m excited about and would be interested in engaging with people on,\u201d Robinson wrote. \u201cThat said, we at Paradigm think the announcement this week crossed lines in both messaging and execution.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cFor example, we don\u2019t agree with the decision to launch the bridge before the L2, or not to allow withdrawals for three months, since we think it sets a bad precedent for other projects,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe also think much of the marketing cheapens the work of a serious team.\u201d\n\nThere are a lot of components of Blast that I\u2019m excited about and would be interested in engaging with people on. That said, we at Paradigm think the announcement this week crossed lines in both messaging and execution. For example, we don\u2019t agree with the decision to launch the\u2026 \u2014 Dan Robinson (@danrobinson) November 26, 2023\n\nBlast is billed as an Ethereum layer-2 network that offers \u201cnative yield for Ethereum and stablecoins,\u201d letting users stake (or lock up) their funds in the network to earn an interest-like return.\n\nThe network also promises Blur-like \u201crewards\u201d ahead for users, enticing early adopters to lock up their funds ahead of a potential airdrop ahead. Blur has already awarded hundreds of millions of dollars worth of its BLUR token to NFT traders, catapulting the marketplace ahead of former leader OpenSea in the process, and that historical example may be enticing for crypto users.\n\nHowever, while users have been excitedly locking up their funds ahead of Blast\u2019s network launch in 2024\u2014bringing Blast\u2019s total value locked (TVL) to about $535 million at present, per data from DeFi Llama\u2014the team has also faced significant criticism in the process.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEssentially, early users are locking their funds into a bridge that will eventually connect from Ethereum to Blast\u2014but the Blast network isn\u2019t actually live yet. And those funds cannot be withdrawn until the expected mainnet rollout in February, drawing security concerns due to the industry\u2019s history of network bridges being exploited for vast sums of crypto. Some traders and industry builders have also called Blast a Ponzi scheme, given its rewards and referral model.\n\nBlast and Blur co-founder Tieshun \u201cPacman\u201d Roquerre has rebuked such complaints, writing in a Twitter thread on Friday that there were \u201ca number of misunderstandings\u201d around Blast and attempting to address them.\n\n1/ There's a meme going around that Blast is a ponzi. The yield that Blast provides users can feel too good to be true, so this meme is understandable. But to put it simply, the yield Blast provides comes (initially) from Lido and MakerDAO. Lido yield comes from ETH staking\u2026 \u2014 Pacman | Blur + Blast (@PacmanBlur) November 24, 2023\n\nHe also said Friday that Paradigm\u2014which was one of the investors in Blast\u2019s $20 million seed round\u2014had no role in Blast\u2019s rollout plans. In fact, Pacman revealed then that Paradigm asked the Blast team to \u201cmake changes\u201d to the launch and that Blast was considering them, but that it would ultimately make any decisions in-house.\n\nRobinson on Sunday praised Pacman and his team for the launch of Blur, which disrupted the NFT market and provided substantial rewards to users in the process. However, Robinson ultimately said that Paradigm and Blast weren\u2019t aligned on certain elements of the rollout, and he felt a need on Paradigm\u2019s behalf to try and advocate for \u201cbest practices\u201d in the industry.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been discussing our concerns with the team and appreciate their willingness to engage with us, but there are still many points of disagreement,\u201d Robinson wrote. \u201cWe invest in strong, independent founders who we don\u2019t always agree with. But we understand that people may look to us to set an example on best practices in crypto.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t endorse these kinds of tactics and take our responsibility in the ecosystem seriously,\u201d Robinson concluded.\n\nDecrypt reached out to both Paradigm and Blast for comment, but did not immediately hear back from either side.\n\nAD\n\nAD"

        "title": "How to buy Bitcoin and Ethereum in the UK - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "To navigate the process of buying Bitcoin effectively, it is essential to explore secure options. In the United Kingdom, acquiring cryptocurrencies is legal, yet it can pose challenges, as the government underscores the need to comprehend the associated risks.\n\nFor an effective traversal of the crypto landscape, investors should follow key steps, including choosing the right crypto exchange or broker, setting up a secure wallet and making informed decisions regarding payments and orders.\n\nThis article examines how to purchase Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) in the U.K. while offering information on legal considerations, secure storage options, cryptocurrency exchanges and brokers for effortless market navigation.\n\nIs it legal to buy Bitcoin and Ether in the U.K.?\n\nWhile the legal status of cryptocurrencies varies from one country to another, buying Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) is entirely legal in the U.K., with a well-defined regulatory framework in place. Cryptocurrencies are categorized as taxable assets by His Majesty\u2019s Revenue and Customs (HMRC), and they are subject to taxation.\n\nAcquiring Bitcoin and Ether in the U.K. triggers the tax reporting and payment obligations associated with cryptocurrency transactions. As such, maintaining accurate records is crucial for individuals planning to purchase BTC and ETH in the United Kingdom. This ensures compliance with tax regulations for both crypto gains and crypto losses.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that in the U.K., cryptocurrencies are not recognized as legal tender like the British pound. This regulatory approach to cryptocurrencies helps to foster innovation and promote awareness of associated risks, creating a transparent, legal environment for buying, selling and holding Bitcoin and Ether.\n\nIn October 2023, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) expanded its regulatory oversight to include crypto asset promotions in the U.K., emphasizing compliance with accurate information and risk warnings. Additionally, starting in September 2023, the Travel Rule mandates that U.K.-based crypto asset businesses are required to collect, verify and share information on transfers, which impacts the pseudonymous nature of cryptocurrencies.\n\nDespite industry engagement, some market players have exited the U.K., highlighting the importance of adhering to rules and regulations when using exchanges to buy cryptocurrencies.\n\nSecure wallet practices to safeguard Bitcoin and Ether holdings\n\nPrior to delving into Bitcoin and Ether investments, it\u2019s essential to have a secure crypto wallet, available in various forms. While leaving holdings on an exchange account is convenient for small quantities, transitioning to a more secure storage solution can be an option for those investors who want to store larger amounts of tokens.\n\nMoreover, it\u2019s crucial to remember that retaining funds on an exchange means lacking control over the keys and, consequently, forfeiting control over the coins, emphasizing the importance of securing private keys for the full control and ownership of digital assets.\n\nBitcoin wallets, including hardware, software and paper options, are used to securely manage and store Bitcoin holdings, while Ethereum wallets act as secure repositories for ETH, providing control over assets and facilitating transactions.\n\nCryptocurrency users rely on Bitcoin and Ether wallets to safeguard and control their digital assets, ensuring the secure management of private keys essential for accessing and managing their holdings.\n\nRelated: A beginner\u2019s guide to filing cryptocurrency taxes in the US, UK and Germany\n\nTo reduce risk, an investor can enhance security by transferring their cryptocurrency from an exchange\u2019s default wallet to their own cold wallet, which is not online and thus less susceptible to hacking.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that these wallets don\u2019t store investor\u2019s cryptocurrencies per se; instead, they safeguard the private keys necessary for accessing the wallet\u2019s address and authorizing transactions. Losing these digital keys means forfeiting access to Bitcoin and Ether holdings.\n\nBuying Bitcoin and Ether in the U.K. through crypto exchanges\n\nInvestors need to choose a broker or cryptocurrency exchange before they can purchase cryptocurrencies. Although both enable cryptocurrency purchases in the U.K., it\u2019s important to note some significant distinctions between them. Due to the growing possibility of hacks in the cryptocurrency space, choosing the best cryptocurrency exchange or broker can be a challenging process, with security being the main priority.\n\nChoose a crypto exchange\n\nIn the U.K., crypto assets and crypto exchanges operate without formal regulation, but the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) mandates registration for crypto exchanges within the country. Notably, some crypto exchanges such as Gemini, Bitpanda, Kraken and Crypto.com are successfully registered with the FCA.\n\nGiven the extreme volatility and absence of government-backed protection for cryptocurrency investments, exercising caution and acknowledging the speculative nature of cryptocurrencies is vital, even when dealing with FCA-authorized and regulated providers. To enhance security, an investor can also diversify their digital currency holdings across multiple exchanges to mitigate the risk of a single exchange failure.\n\nWhen choosing a crypto exchange, check for BTC and ETH availability, but also ensure there\u2019s substantial daily trading volume to guarantee adequate liquidity for smooth transactions in both cryptocurrencies and fiat currency. Also, watch out for fees that can affect returns, especially for high-frequency traders, and ensure the exchange offers desired trading types such as limit orders and margins.\n\nIn response to updated regulatory guidelines from the FCA and the expanded parameters of the Regime of Financial Promotions, CEX.IO and Binance announced in 2023 that they had suspended onboarding new U.K.-based consumers. Therefore, verifying an exchange\u2019s availability in the U.K. and compliance with regulatory changes is essential for informed decision-making.\n\nChoose a cryptocurrency broker\n\nCryptocurrency brokers, such as interactive brokers and eToro, simplify the crypto buying process with user-friendly interfaces that interact with exchanges for investors. While some cryptocurrency brokers charge higher fees, others offer their services for free but profit by selling traders\u2019 data or executing user trades at suboptimal market prices.\n\nWhile brokers offer convenience, they may limit the transfer of cryptocurrency holdings from their trading platforms. This restriction can be a concern for investors seeking enhanced security through crypto wallets, including hardware wallets disconnected from the internet. However, brokers can restrict investors from moving their crypto holdings to external wallets.\n\nDecide on a payment option\n\nAfter selecting a cryptocurrency broker or exchange, investors can sign up to open an account and fund it through options like linking a bank account or using debit or credit cards, though the latter may incur high fees.\n\nUpon creating an account and selecting a payment method, identity verification is mandatory. For example, the submission of an identity document and proof of address is a common requirement in the United Kingdom. Investors may also encounter a crypto risk awareness quiz. Depending on the broker or exchange, there might be a wait of a few days before the deposited funds can be used to buy cryptocurrency.\n\nPlace an order\n\nAfter funding their account, investors can proceed to place their order for purchasing Bitcoin or Ether by entering the desired amount in pounds. The process varies by exchange; some have a straightforward \u201cBuy\u201d button for BTC and ETH, which prompts users to enter the desired amount.\n\nMost exchanges enable the purchase of fractional cryptocurrency shares, making it feasible to own portions of higher-priced tokens like Bitcoin or Ethereum that would typically require significant investment.\n\nStore Bitcoin and Ether\n\nAs previously noted, cryptocurrency exchanges run the additional risk of theft or hacking and are not protected by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme of the United Kingdom. If cryptocurrency owners misplace or forget their private keys or recovery phrases, they could forfeit their entire investment.\n\nWhen purchasing cryptocurrency on a crypto exchange, it is typically retained in a wallet connected to the exchange. If desired, investors can store or withdraw Bitcoin and Ether to a chosen external wallet for added security. However, investors purchasing cryptocurrency through a broker might not have much control over where it is kept.\n\nIf an investor is interested in transferring their digital currency to a securer place or doesn\u2019t like the provider the exchange collaborates with, they may move it off the exchange and into an independent hot or cold wallet. Depending on the exchange and the total amount of a transfer, investors may be required to pay a small charge in order to accomplish this.\n\nCryptocurrency ATMs\n\nCrypto ATMs have been appearing in cities all over the world; however, in February 2023, the FCA imposed a ban on cryptocurrency ATMs and urged operators to shut down their machines or face enforcement actions.\n\nThe FCA warns that using these machines is risky, as they operate unlawfully and provide no protection in case of issues, and communication with operators is often challenging. The FCA aims to keep cautioning the public and taking enforcement measures against unregistered crypto ATM operators.\n\nCrypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs): An alternative to directly holding Bitcoin and Ether\n\nExchange-traded funds (ETFs) provide diversified exposure to multiple holdings within a single investment, including cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ether. Investment trusts pool investors\u2019 funds through the sale of a set number of shares, which may have some initial trust-related challenges upon launch. This structure provides instant diversification and reduces risk compared to picking individual investments.\n\nInvestors can now access multiple cryptocurrencies simultaneously through various firms. ETF providers such as Purpose Investments and VanEck offer opportunities for investors to engage in the crypto market.\n\nOther methods to buy Bitcoin and Ether in the U.K.\n\nSeveral U.K. banking and financial apps, such as PayPal, Revolut, Skrill and MoonPay, have introduced the ability for customers to purchase Bitcoin and Ether directly on their platforms. To purchase shares in companies that are publicly listed, they will require an online account.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s worth noting that JPMorgan\u2019s U.K. bank, Chase, took a different stance in October 2023 by prohibiting cryptocurrency transactions for its British customers due to a notable increase in fraud and scams, including fake investments and deceptive celebrity endorsements.\n\nAdditionally, payment processors, such as BitPay, can be used to buy BTC and ETH. Once connected, users can initiate transactions through the payment processor, converting fiat currency into Bitcoin or Ether.\n\nMoreover, in the U.K., traders can utilize peer-to-peer (P2P) crypto platforms, such as Cash App and Paxful, to trade digital assets, although the government emphasizes the risks associated with these assets. P2P platforms enable direct cryptocurrency transactions between individuals and are a prevalent means of acquiring digital currencies in the United Kingdom. However, it\u2019s important to be aware that U.K. investors have limited legal protections in the event of platform insolvency."

        "title": "Arbitrum vs Optimism: Ethereum's Layer 2 Showdown! - Blockgeeks",
        "content": "Are you ready to take your Ethereum experience to the next level with our future plans? Experience faster transaction times with our airdrop feature and make use of the revolutionary op token. If you\u2019re looking to enhance scalability and reduce transaction fees on the ethereum blockchain, look no further. The ethereum virtual machine provides efficient data availability and exchange. The battle between Arbitrum vs Optimism, two prominent Layer 2 solutions on the ethereum blockchain, has captured the attention of the crypto community. This competition aims to improve transaction times and transaction finality on the ethereum blockchain, with potential benefits for airdrop campaigns. But which one should you choose?\n\nWe\u2019ll examine the pros of their respective chain architectures and consensus mechanisms in order to determine which solution, whether it\u2019s the ARB protocol or another, offers a more seamless user experience. Buckle up as we navigate through the intricacies of Layer 2 scaling solutions, including chains, airdrop, protocol, and arb.\n\nUnraveling Arbitrum\u2019s Functionality\n\nArbitrum and Optimism are two prominent Layer-2 scaling solutions that aim to address the scalability issues of the Ethereum network. These solutions have their own pros and cons, but they both offer significant improvements in terms of scalability and efficiency. Additionally, they introduce their own token, which plays a crucial role in the functioning of the network.\n\nHow does Arbitrum work?\n\nArbitrum, built on Optimistic Rollups technology, has its pros and cons. It bundles multiple transactions together and submits them to the Ethereum mainnet in a compressed format. The pros of this approach are a significant reduction in gas fees and increased transaction throughput, while the cons are not mentioned. Overall, this method offers an op solution for improving efficiency and cost-effectiveness.\n\nArbitrum achieves scalability by employing a technique called \u201coptimistic execution.\u201d This means that instead of executing every transaction on-chain, it assumes that all transactions are valid unless proven otherwise. One of the cons of this approach is that it may lead to potential security risks. By using op, it can op process transactions off-chain op more quickly and efficiently.\n\nThe role of validators\n\nValidators play a crucial role in Arbitrum\u2019s functionality. They are responsible for verifying the correctness of op transactions submitted to the system. Validators op monitor disputes and ensure that any invalid or fraudulent activity is detected and resolved.\n\nValidators also participate in consensus mechanisms to ensure agreement on the state of the op system. They validate blocks produced by other participants and propose their own blocks when necessary. Through this collaborative effort, validators maintain the integrity and security of the Arbitrum network.\n\nCross-chain compatibility\n\nOne notable feature of Arbitrum is its cross-chain compatibility with Ethereum. Users can seamlessly transfer their assets between both networks through a process called bridging. This interoperability enables users to take advantage of Arbitrum\u2019s scalability benefits while still being able to interact with Ethereum\u2019s vibrant ecosystem.\n\nBenefits and limitations\n\nArbitrum offers several advantages over traditional Layer-1 solutions like Ethereum:\n\nScalability: By processing most transactions off-chain, Arbitrum significantly improves throughput and reduces congestion on the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nLower fees: Gas fees have been a major pain point for Ethereum users, but with Arbitrum\u2019s Optimistic Rollups, transaction costs are minimized.\n\nCompatibility: The ability to bridge assets between Ethereum and Arbitrum allows users to tap into the benefits of both networks.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that Arbitrum also has its limitations:\n\nLatency: Due to the optimistic execution approach, there may be a delay in confirming transactions on the mainnet. While this delay is typically minimal, it can still impact real-time applications.\n\nCentralization concerns: Validators play a key role in the functioning of Arbitrum. As such, there are concerns about centralization if a small group of validators gain significant control over the network.\n\nExploring Optimism\u2019s Mechanisms\n\nOptimism is a popular layer 2 scaling solution that aims to improve the scalability and efficiency of Ethereum. Let\u2019s dive into how Optimism achieves this and explore its mechanisms in more detail.\n\nRollup Technology\n\nOne of the key mechanisms behind Optimism is its use of rollup technology. Rollups allow for the processing and verification of transactions off-chain, reducing the burden on the Ethereum mainnet. This means that instead of every transaction being processed directly on Ethereum, they are bundled together and verified in batches, significantly increasing the network\u2019s throughput.\n\nBy utilizing rollups, Optimism can achieve faster transaction times and lower fees compared to conducting transactions solely on the Ethereum mainnet. This scalability improvement is crucial for decentralized applications (dApps) that often face congestion issues due to high demand.\n\nFraud Proof\n\nAnother important mechanism employed by Optimism is fraud proof. Fraud proof ensures the security and integrity of transactions processed on layer 2 by allowing users to challenge any fraudulent or incorrect information submitted to the network. In case of a dispute, users have the ability to provide evidence proving that a transaction was invalid or maliciously executed.\n\nThis mechanism acts as a safeguard against potential attacks or fraudulent activities within the system, providing an additional layer of trust for users interacting with dApps built on top of Optimism.\n\nDecentralized Verification\n\nOptimism also incorporates decentralized verification into its framework. Instead of relying on a single centralized entity for transaction validation, multiple validators are involved in verifying transactions within each rollup batch. These validators work collectively to ensure consensus and validate the correctness of all transactions before they are committed back to Ethereum mainnet.\n\nDecentralized verification not only enhances security but also prevents any single point of failure from impacting the entire network. It distributes responsibility among multiple participants, making it more resilient against attacks or manipulation attempts.\n\nSeamless Interoperability\n\nOptimism is designed to seamlessly integrate with existing Ethereum infrastructure, making it easier for developers to adopt and migrate their dApps onto layer 2. This interoperability allows developers to take advantage of Optimism\u2019s scalability benefits without having to rewrite or significantly modify their smart contracts.\n\nBy providing a smooth transition path, Optimism aims to encourage widespread adoption of layer 2 solutions and contribute to the overall growth and scalability of the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nComparing Arbitrum vs Optimism Architectures\n\nBoth these Layer 2 scaling solutions aim to address the scalability issues faced by Ethereum. Let\u2019s explore their similarities and differences.\n\nSimilarities between Arbitrum and Optimism\n\nEthereum Compatibility: Both Arbitrum and Optimism are designed to be compatible with the Ethereum network. They leverage Ethereum\u2019s security model and infrastructure, allowing developers to seamlessly port their existing smart contracts onto these Layer 2 solutions. Optimistic Rollups: Both architectures employ an optimistic rollup approach, which means that most transactions are processed off-chain while maintaining a high level of security through periodic checkpoints on the Ethereum mainnet. This enables faster transaction processing times and significantly reduces gas fees compared to conducting transactions directly on the Ethereum network. Decentralization: Both Arbitrum and Optimism prioritize decentralization by relying on a network of validators who ensure the correctness of off-chain transactions before submitting them to the Ethereum mainnet for final settlement. This distributed validation process ensures that no single entity has complete control over the system.\n\nDifferences between Arbitrum and Optimism\n\nDesign Philosophy: While both solutions share similar goals, they adopt different design philosophies. Arbitrum focuses on minimizing changes to existing smart contracts, making it easier for developers to migrate their applications without significant modifications. On the other hand, Optimism takes a more opinionated approach by requiring certain code optimizations for better performance. Security Trade-offs: In terms of security trade-offs, Arbitrum prioritizes speed by allowing users to immediately withdraw funds from Layer 2 back to Layer 1 without waiting for any challenge periods or dispute resolutions. However, this comes at the cost of potentially higher fraud risk if malicious actors attempt to submit invalid transactions during this withdrawal period. Developer Experience: Optimism offers a more developer-friendly experience by providing an extensive set of developer tools and documentation. It also supports a wider range of programming languages, making it easier for developers to build on top of the platform. Arbitrum, while still user-friendly, may require additional effort from developers due to its focus on maintaining compatibility with existing Ethereum contracts. Deployment Status: As of now, Optimism has been deployed on the Ethereum mainnet and is available for public use. On the other hand, Arbitrum is currently in a testnet phase but is expected to launch on the mainnet soon.\n\nAnalyzing Account Abstraction in Arbitrum vs Optimism\n\nAccount abstraction is a critical aspect of layer 2 scaling solutions like Arbitrum and Optimism.\n\nAccount Abstraction in Arbitrum:\n\nArbitrum utilizes a technique called \u201caccount abstraction\u201d to enable efficient execution of smart contracts. With account abstraction, users can interact with smart contracts on the Ethereum network without having to hold Ether (ETH) directly. Instead, they can use other assets as collateral, such as ERC-20 tokens or stablecoins.\n\nThis approach offers several advantages. First, it reduces the need for users to hold ETH solely for transaction fees, making it more convenient for them to participate in decentralized applications (DApps). Second, it allows developers to design DApps that accept multiple types of collateral, increasing flexibility for users.\n\nAccount Abstraction in Optimism:\n\nSimilarly, Optimism also employs account abstraction to enhance scalability and usability. Users can interact with smart contracts on the Optimistic Ethereum network without needing ETH directly. Instead, they can use Wrapped Ether (WETH), which is an ERC-20 representation of ETH that can be used as collateral.\n\nBy abstracting away the requirement for direct ETH holdings, Optimism enables a seamless user experience while reducing friction associated with gas fees. This makes it easier for users to engage with DApps on the platform and encourages broader adoption.\n\nSimilarities between Arbitrum and Optimism\u2019s Account Abstraction:\n\nBoth Arbitrum and Optimism share a common goal of improving scalability and usability through account abstraction. By allowing users to utilize alternative assets as collateral instead of requiring direct ETH holdings, both platforms aim to make interacting with smart contracts more accessible and cost-effective.\n\nBoth solutions leverage existing standards like ERC-20 tokens (Arbitrum) and Wrapped Ether (Optimism) to facilitate account abstraction. This approach ensures compatibility with the broader Ethereum ecosystem and simplifies integration for developers.\n\nDifferences between Arbitrum and Optimism\u2019s Account Abstraction:\n\nWhile both platforms employ account abstraction, there are some differences in how they implement this mechanism. For instance, Arbitrum supports a wide range of ERC-20 tokens as collateral, providing users with greater flexibility in choosing their preferred assets. On the other hand, Optimism currently only accepts Wrapped Ether (WETH) as collateral.\n\nMoreover, the underlying technologies used by Arbitrum and Optimism differ. Arbitrum utilizes a rollup-based solution that aggregates transactions off-chain before submitting them to the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nEthereum Scaling Battle: Arbitrum vs Optimism\n\nThe Ethereum network has been facing scalability issues for quite some time now, with high transaction fees and slow confirmation times becoming major pain points. In response to this challenge, several Layer 2 scaling solutions have emerged, including Arbitrum and Optimism. These two platforms aim to enhance the scalability of Ethereum by offloading transactions onto secondary chains while still maintaining a strong connection to the main Ethereum network.\n\nSpeed and Throughput\n\nArbitrum and Optimism both offer significant improvements in terms of speed and throughput compared to the main Ethereum network. Transactions on these Layer 2 solutions can be processed much faster, thanks to their use of a sidechain or rollup technology. This allows for a higher number of transactions per second (TPS), enabling users to carry out their transactions quickly and efficiently.\n\nSecurity and Decentralization\n\nBoth Arbitrum and Optimism prioritize these aspects in their design. They leverage the underlying security of the Ethereum network by anchoring data on-chain at regular intervals, ensuring that any malicious activity can be detected and mitigated effectively.\n\nArbitrum employs an optimistic rollup approach that relies on fraud proofs. In this model, transactions are initially assumed valid unless proven otherwise through fraud proofs submitted by users or validators. On the other hand, Optimism utilizes a similar mechanism called optimistic rollups but with a different implementation known as OVM (Optimistic Virtual Machine). The OVM executes smart contracts off-chain while providing dispute resolution capabilities on-chain if necessary.\n\nUser Experience\n\nBoth Arbitrum and Optimism aim to provide a seamless user experience by allowing users to interact with Layer 2 applications using their existing Ethereum addresses without any additional setup or migration process required. This means that users can continue using their favorite wallets or dapps without any disruption while enjoying improved scalability and lower fees.\n\nAdoption and Ecosystem Support\n\nIn terms of adoption and ecosystem support, both Arbitrum and Optimism have gained significant traction. They have attracted a wide range of projects and developers who are eager to leverage the benefits of Layer 2 scaling. Many popular decentralized applications (dapps) and protocols have already integrated with these platforms, showcasing their potential for widespread adoption in the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nTrade-Offs\n\nWhile Arbitrum and Optimism offer compelling solutions to Ethereum\u2019s scalability challenges, there are trade-offs to consider. Both platforms require users to wait for a certain period before they can withdraw their funds from Layer 2 back to the main Ethereum network.\n\nKey Similarities and Differences\n\nSimilarities between Arbitrum and Optimism\n\nArbitrum and Optimism are both Layer 2 scaling solutions for the Ethereum network. They aim to address the scalability issues of Ethereum by enabling faster and cheaper transactions. These solutions utilize a technique called optimistic rollups, which allows them to process a large number of transactions off-chain while still maintaining the security of the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nBoth Arbitrum and Optimism offer significant improvements in transaction speed compared to the Ethereum mainnet. By processing transactions off-chain and only submitting a summary of those transactions to the mainnet, they can achieve much higher throughput. This means that users can experience faster confirmation times and lower fees when using applications built on these scaling solutions.\n\nDifferences between Arbitrum and Optimism\n\nWhile Arbitrum and Optimism share similarities, there are also some key differences between them.\n\nOne major difference lies in their approach to achieving scalability. Arbitrum uses a technology called \u201cTruebit\u201d to verify the correctness of off-chain computations before submitting them to the Ethereum mainnet. This additional verification step adds an extra layer of security but may result in slightly slower transaction speeds compared to Optimism.\n\nOn the other hand, Optimism takes a different approach by utilizing a technique known as \u201coptimistic execution.\u201d Instead of verifying each off-chain computation individually, it assumes that all computations are correct unless proven otherwise. This allows for faster transaction speeds but introduces some level of risk if malicious actors attempt to manipulate or submit fraudulent transactions.\n\nAnother difference is in their development progress and adoption within the Ethereum ecosystem. While both projects have gained significant attention and support, Optimism was launched earlier than Arbitrum, which has given it a head start in terms of deployment and integration with existing applications. However, this does not necessarily mean that one solution is superior to the other; it simply reflects differences in timing and implementation strategies.\n\nIn terms of user experience, the two solutions may also have slight variations. The way users interact with applications built on Arbitrum and Optimism could differ due to differences in how they handle transaction finality and dispute resolution. It\u2019s important for developers and users to understand these nuances when choosing which solution to utilize.\n\nThe Future Roadmap: Developments and Catalysts\n\nLayer 2 Scaling Solutions\n\nThe future roadmap for both Arbitrum and Optimism involves continuous development and improvement of their respective layer 2 scaling solutions. Both platforms are committed to enhancing scalability, reducing transaction costs, and improving user experience in the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nAdoption by DApps and Users\n\nA crucial factor that will shape the future of Arbitrum and Optimism is the adoption by decentralized applications (DApps) and users. As more DApps integrate with these layer 2 solutions, it will drive increased usage and demand for their services. This adoption will be influenced by factors such as ease of integration, cost-effectiveness, security, and overall performance.\n\nEcosystem Support\n\nThe support from the wider Ethereum ecosystem is also vital for the success of both Arbitrum and Optimism. Collaboration with other projects, including wallets, exchanges, and infrastructure providers, is essential to create a seamless user experience. Developer communities play a significant role in driving innovation on these layer 2 platforms through building new applications or migrating existing ones.\n\nNetwork Effects\n\nNetwork effects can significantly impact the growth trajectory of any technology or platform. In the case of Arbitrum vs Optimism, network effects refer to how each solution attracts users based on its existing user base. As more users join either platform due to its advantages or popularity within certain communities or sectors (such as gaming or DeFi), it creates a positive feedback loop that further drives adoption.\n\nUpcoming Upgrades\n\nBoth Arbitrum and Optimism have plans for upcoming upgrades that aim to address current limitations and introduce new features. These upgrades may include improvements in scalability, security enhancements, compatibility with other blockchains or layer 1 networks beyond Ethereum, cross-chain interoperability solutions, or even novel consensus mechanisms.\n\nRegulatory Landscape\n\nAnother aspect that could shape the future roadmap for both Arbitrum and Optimism is the regulatory landscape. As governments and regulatory bodies around the world develop frameworks for cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, compliance and adherence to these regulations will become increasingly important. Platforms that can navigate this landscape effectively while maintaining decentralization and user privacy may have a competitive advantage.\n\nCommunity and Ecosystem Dynamics\n\nGrowing Communities: Arbitrum and Optimism\n\nArbitrum and Optimism are both scaling solutions for Ethereum, aiming to tackle the network\u2019s scalability issues. These platforms have gained significant traction within the crypto community, attracting developers, users, and investors alike.\n\nDeveloper Adoption and Support\n\nBoth Arbitrum and Optimism have seen a surge in developer adoption due to their compatibility with existing Ethereum smart contracts.

        "content": "ETH addresses with 10,000 or more have increased recently.\n\nETH price has remained above $2,000.\n\nRecently, significant Ethereum holders were on the move, leading to a notable rise in accumulation. This increased accumulation has resulted in a notable amount of ETH being withdrawn from exchanges.\n\nEthereum whales increase accumulation\n\nA look at addresses holding around 10,000 Ethereum or more revealed a recent rise in their numbers.\n\nAMBCrypto\u2019s analysis of the Glassnode chart showed that these addresses started to grow towards the end of October. The chart showed a rise after a notable decline that brought the count down from around 1,090 to 1,063.\n\nAs of this writing, the number of such addresses has risen to around 1,077. This suggests a rise in whale accumulation. How has the movement of Ethereum on exchanges responded to this increased accumulation?\n\nExchange netflow mountains negative trend\n\nThe analysis of Ethereum\u2019s exchange activity for November showed a higher outflow than inflow. This implied that more ETH was leaving exchanges than entering them.\n\nThe statistics suggest a decrease in sell pressure and an uptick in scarcity. Additionally, this reduction in availability tends to increase its value.\n\nAccording to Glassnode\u2019s exchange netflow data, over 47,000 ETH have been withdrawn from exchanges.\n\nThe chart has consistently shown negative values over the past few days, further emphasizing the trend of ETH moving away from exchange platforms.\n\nEthereum supply off exchanges mount\n\nAccording to an analysis of a Santiment chart, the Ethereum supply on exchanges has experienced a decrease. This indicated a reduction in the available volume of ETH on these platforms.\n\nThe chart showed that this decline started around 14th November, with the volume falling from around 10.6 million to about 10.58 million.\n\nCurrently, the supply on exchanges is around 10.5 million. Interestingly, as the supply on exchanges reduced, the supply off-exchanges rose, reaching over 118 million.\n\nAt the beginning of the current month, the off-exchange volume was around 117 million.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s ETH\u2019s market cap in BTC terms\n\nETH continues slight uptrends\n\nAt the time of this update, Ethereum was experiencing a positive price trend on a daily timeframe chart. Over the past two days, a consistent, albeit slight, price increase could be seen.\n\nNotably, Ethereum was still trading above the $2,000 price range. The positive trend has persisted since the golden cross on the daily timeframe, further confirming the current trend\u2019s strength."

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nEIP 4844 or \"Proto-Danksharding\" is known as the most anticipated upgrade for Ethereum (ETH), the largest smart contracts blockchain. Besides being a game-changer in transaction fees economy, it is set to significantly increase the transactional capacity of L2s on Ethereum (ETH).\n\nEIP 4844 to lower L2 fees by 7x, Ryan Berckmans says\n\nEthereum's EIP 4844 data blobs are expected to kick off in three months to greatly reduce L2 fees, Ethereum (ETH) veteran Ryan Berckmans stated on X. The drop in L2 transactional commissions will be accompanied by advanced bandwidth on the network.\n\nEthereum's EIP 4844 data blobs launch in ~3 months to greatly reduce L2 fees\n\n\n\nBy now, many people know that blobs initially give us ~7x data bandwidth (iirc), which is huge but not enough for global ubiquity.\n\n\n\nWhat's less well known may be that\n\n\n\n1) blob gas doesn't compete with\u2026 \u2014 Ryan Berckmans ryanb.eth (@ryanberckmans) November 25, 2023\n\nOnce launched, blob gas will not be competing with L1 execution gas, so the entire blob market should clear at substantially lower fees even if every blob is always sold. As a result, both cost-efficiency and throughput of Ethereum (ETH) will be increased by 600%.\n\nWith the EIP 4844 activation, L2 solutions of various types will scale Ethereum (ETH) in a novel way. Both solutions with ZK-secured validity proofs (Polygon zkEVM, Starknet) and hybrid optimistic rollups (Arbitrum Nova) will benefit from the upgrade and contribute to Ethereum (ETH) scaling.\n\nThis will be the next big thing for usability and accessibility of Ethereum (ETH), the investor says:\n\nEthereum's most accessible days are coming soon. In time for the bull!\n\nAs covered by U.Today previously, the Ethereum (ETH) community is expecting the EIP 4844 activation to make all of its L2s faster and cheaper.\n\nMore advances for Ethereum L2 rollups\n\nThe hotly anticipated upgrade is set to be confirmed in Q1, 2024, after a series of shadow forks and testnet updates.\n\nMeanwhile, one more game-changing upgrade might unlock new opportunities for Ethereum (ETH) L2s. As U.Today reported, a proposal to add native account abstraction to Layer 2 solutions was released by developers the previous week.\n\nRIP-7560: Native Account Abstraction is the first-ever rollup-specific performance upgrade proposal.\n\nThe implementation of AA in rollups would require three changes in smart contract accounts: EntryPoint address adjustment, validateUserOp function rewrite and some minor updates to transaction logics."

This awakening of a crypto giant correlates with movements in the Ethereum market that could have broader implications.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis \"whale,\" a term affectionately given to large-scale holders of cryptocurrency, originally acquired 100,000 ETH at the nascent stage of Ethereum's life, during the initial coin offering (ICO). With the ICO price around $0.31, the cost basis of this investment was a mere $31,000, a sum that pales in comparison to the current valuation of these assets.\n\nThe timing of such a move is critical. The Ethereum price chart shows the currency testing a resistance point, attempting to sustain its momentum above the $2,000 mark. The emergence of such a significant player, particularly one initiating transactions of this magnitude, could signal to the market a shift in sentiment or liquidity that may catalyze further price action.\n\nWhile the transfer of 20,000 ETH is substantial, the current Ethereum market cap is vast enough that such a transaction alone is unlikely to cause disruptive market waves. However, it does bring attention to the potential for large holders to move markets. Should this whale decide to liquidate a significant portion of their holdings, it could introduce a substantial amount of Ethereum into the market, potentially putting downward pressure on the price.\n\nConversely, if this whale were to lock in their holdings or disperse them in a way that suggests a long-term hold strategy, market confidence could be reinforced, possibly driving prices upward. The deposit to Kraken might be an initial step toward liquidity, but it does not necessarily predict a major sell-off."

The ETH/USD pairing on Kraken has seen a notable upward break, crossing the significant $2,000 mark and challenging the resistance at $2,136, setting the stage for possible future price action.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nObserving Ethereum's daily chart, one can see a strong bullish trend that has seized the attention of those in the crypto arena. Ethereum has successfully broken past the $2,000 mark, causing a notable surge in market volatility. This is visible in the larger candlestick sizes and increased trading volume, indicating an intense tug-of-war for control between buyers and sellers.\n\nThe $2,136 resistance level adds a layer of fascination, as it has been a point where Ethereum's upward trajectory has been halted in the past. Yet, the current strength of the market, as evidenced by overcoming nearby resistance levels, suggests we may soon see another attempt to breach this resistance. A stable position above this price could herald a new era of price exploration for Ethereum.\n\nThe moving averages on the chart are converging in a manner that traders often interpret as bullish; the 50-day moving average is crossing over the 100-day line. However, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is approaching levels considered overbought, which could imply an impending pullback as investors potentially begin to lock in gains.\n\nAlso noteworthy is the development of what appears to be a bullish pennant formation, a pattern that suggests a continuation of the recent upward price trend following a period of consolidation. If Ethereum breaks out from this pattern convincingly, it could be setting its sights on previously uncharted territory.\n\nTraders understand that a resistance level like $2,136 is more than just a figure \u2014 it is a zone where multiple trading strategies and orders intersect, thus serving as a critical barometer for market mood. As Ethereum approaches this pivotal level, it will be a true test of whether the market can sustain its bullish enthusiasm.\n\nXRP remains solid\n\nXRP is trading close to a local resistance point, as demonstrated by recent high prices near $0.65. This level is pivotal as it has repeatedly served as a barrier to upward price movements, highlighting areas where the selling pressure has surpassed buying activity. It is crucial for investors to monitor this price point closely; surpassing it could indicate an impending upward surge, reflecting significant buy-side interest and a positive market outlook.\n\nSupport levels hold comparable weight, with XRP's notable support found at approximately $0.55. This price has traditionally acted as a foundation, where an increase in purchasing has helped avert a further decline in value. Investors need to watch this support level carefully, as falling below it may suggest a downward trend is at hand, heightening the liquidation risk for those with leveraged stakes.\n\nAdditionally, the chart includes Moving Average (MA) lines, where a recent \"Golden Cross\" is observed as the 50-day MA (in light blue) ascends past the 200-day MA (in black), traditionally seen as a bullish sign. Nevertheless, with the 100-day MA (in dark blue) still trailing below the 200-day MA, a degree of caution is advised.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) is positioned around the middle, not indicating an immediate reversal, as it is neither in overbought nor oversold conditions. However, traders should be wary of any sudden shifts toward the high or low ends of the scale, as such movements could signal an upcoming price change in either direction."

However, the challenge is that data availability is moving slower in the off-chain systems as the near-term and mid-term demands are high.\n\nAbout the next Ethereum upgrade EIP 4844 a.k.a Danksharding, Buterin said that the data map space will be improvised to 16 Megabytes per slot. Once the upgrade is done, the only hard work to be done is setting the parameters and attributes.\n\nButerin also argued that they could also employ a voting system so there would be no need for hard forks in the future. The Dencun upgrade will be live early in 2024.\n\nAlso Read: CME Bitcoin Futures Turns Mega Bullish, Rally To $45,000 In Play?\n\nCardano Supporters Mocked Buterin Over His UTxO Statement\n\nAs soon as Buterin mentioned UTxO, Cardano advocates mocked him on the microblogging site X hilariously. Taking a dig at Buterin, Cardano\u2019s founder Charles Hoskinson said that \u201cEthereum 3 will solve it all\u201d satirically.\n\nEthereum uses an account-based model while, UTxO (Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO)-based blockchain) is used by Bitcoin and Cardano. While Buterin praised the UTxO approach, the Cardano army couldn\u2019t stop themselves and taunted why Cardano was doing things correctly.\n\nIn response to a comment, Hoskinson mentioned that Cardano would never be lauded as one of the greatest scientific achievements by Vitalik or the Ethereum team. Furthermore, he stated that Vitalik is rediscovering what Cardano has been working on for a decade and that they are never recognized.\n\nAlso Read: Binance\u2019s Ex-CEO Changpeng \u201cCZ\u201d Zhao Fights For UAE Return Post Guilty Plea"

Discover SCENE\n\nIllustration by Mitchell Preffer for Decrypt.\n\nCrypto markets had a sleepy week\u2014until Friday. Bitcoin had barely budged on Thanksgiving but the next day it hit an 18-month high, touching $38,000 per coin.\n\nThe last time it hit that level was before the collapse of crypto mega project Terra in May 2022 which led to a fall in the price of every coin and token and the bankruptcy of major digital asset companies.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBitcoin is today trading for $37,751, flat over 24-hours. Over the week, it's up about 3%.\n\nCNBC's Jim Cramer who famously bought Bitcoin only to then bash it even said that people should buy up the cryptocurrency again.\n\nA surge of cash into crypto investment products from big money investors is helping push up the price of the asset\u2014and the rest of the market.\n\nEthereum also hit an 18-month high before dipping again on Friday. It's right now trading for $2,079, having risen 6.5% in seven days.\n\nSolana, which was on a tear for most of November, slowed right down: the coin is now priced at $58.59. That's a movement of less than 2% over 24 hours and basically flat for the week.\n\nAlso, the original meme coin Dogecoin\u2014which is the 10th biggest digital asset by market cap\u2014is also up 1.3% in the past day, having shed nearly 3% of its value over the week.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt's not just digital coins and tokens that had a good week. Interest in traditional crypto stocks surged. Coinbase's shares also shot up on Friday; by the time trading had closed, Nasdaq's COIN was priced at $115.54 per share\u2014over 6% over 24 hours.\n\nMicroStrategy\u2014which trades as MTSR and is the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin\u2014also shot up. Its shares are at $520.24 a pop right now. They haven't been that high since December 2021.\n\nEdited by Ryan Ozawa."

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nFounder of IOG and Cardano, billionaire Charles Hoskinson, who took part in the creation of Ethereum together with Vitalik Buterin, Joe Lubin and several other individuals, has commented on Buterin's recent ideas about how to improve the centralized Ethereum staking. Cardano founder's comment about Buterin's ideas was pretty sarcastic, though.\n\nButerin wants to redesign Ethereum staking, Hoskinson reacts\n\nIn a recent interview of Vitalik Buterin in Turkey, where he answered questions from the local community, he talked about the Ethereum road map. In particular, Buterin touched on the topic of Ethereum staking as he said that \"there is something to be done about staking centralization.\"\n\nIn particular, he mentioned current issues with multiple staking pools and \"solo staking being hard,\" summarizing that these issues and others about it are \"not really healthy.\" Buterin is considering introducing a redesign to the staking system on his blockchain. As one of the possible solutions here, the Ethereum frontman is considering the UTxO approach, which is based on unspent transactions.\n\nCharles Hoskinson's sarcastic reaction to that was, \"No worries, Ethereum 3 will have it all sorted.\"\n\nNo worries, Ethereum 3 will have it all sorted! https://t.co/Td0Hm58eic \u2014 Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) November 24, 2023\n\nThis is not the first time that Buterin has spoken about the need to redesign the staking system of Ethereum. Earlier this year, Hoskinson and the Cardano army have several times criticized him for admitting certain inconveniences that the staking system adopted by Ethereum bears and slammed Buterin for considering introducing features that Cardano had implemented already to make ADA staking easier for its users.\n\nWhales stocking up on ETH in big way\n\nAccording to prominent whale transactions tracking platform Whale Alert, over the past 30 hours, several massive chunks of Ethereum have been withdrawn from three major crypto exchanges: Bitfinex, Binance and Coincheck.\n\nAnonymous whales have removed 50,000 ETH, 15,000 and 33,330 ETH from these platforms to their cold wallets, respectively. These lumps of Ethereum are evaluated at a massive $105,740,324, $31,138,359 and $68,795,390.\n\nBesides, another anonymous wallet withdrew 1,498 ETH worth $3.13 million earlier today from Binance, while ETH traded at $2,089. Per @OnchainDataNerd blockchain sleuth account, within the past couple of days, this whale has accumulated 4,770 ETH in total, paying $2,079 per coin on average.\n\nCrypto analyst Ali Martinez believes that currently, whales are going on a big Ethereum buying spree. He shared a chart showing that within the last nine days, big ETH holders have been accumulating large amounts of ETH for the first time in the past nine months. He considers this to be a bullish signal for the second-largest crypto."

        "content": "Blast, a recently launched Ethereum layer-2 blockchain, experienced an unusual surge in assets with an inflow of over $500 million a few days after its introduction on November 212023.\n\nIntroducing Blast: The only Ethereum L2 with native yield for ETH and stablecoins. We\u2019ve raised $20m from @Paradigm and @StandardCrypto to build the L2 that helps you earn more. Details on how to get early access at the end of the thread\ud83d\udc47 pic.twitter.com/AYYmK8YFx4 \u2014 Blast (@Blast_L2) November 20, 2023\n\nLayer 2 networks are the hottest projects in crypto in 2023. These networks, which operate on top of layer 1 blockchains like Ethereum, address issues related to speed, cost, and scalability. Blast utilizes bridges, blockchain-based tools that facilitate the transfer of tokens between different networks.\n\nBlast incorporates a native staking feature that aims to generate returns by combining Ethereum staking with real-world assets, providing users with a unique opportunity for investment growth. Depositors start earning yields on the transferred Ether alongside BLAST points.\n\n\u201cBlast natively participates in ETH staking, and the staking yield is passed back to the L2\u2019s users and dapps,\u201d the team said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve redesigned the L2 from the ground up so that if you have 1 ETH in your wallet on Blast, over time, it grows to 1.04, 1.08, 1.12 ETH automatically.\u201d\n\nOut of the total funds bridged, more than $500 million in Ether has been staked on Lido, as of this writing, offering an annualized yield of up to 4%. Additionally, there\u2019s $63 million on Maker, and $468k held in its wallets.\n\nUsers are required to wait until the mainnet launch in February 2024 before being able to withdraw funds from the network or engage in on-chain activities. Blast Bridge is currently invite-only, with access granted through a code from invited users. Additionally, the redemption of BLAST points is set to commence in May 2024.\n\nBlast secured over $20 million in a funding round led by Paradigm and Standard Crypto. The project is led by the pseudonymous @PacmanBlur, who is also one of the co-founders of the NFT marketplace, Blur.\n\nFollow us on Twitter for latest posts and updates\n\nJoin and interact with our Telegram community\n\n_______________________________________\n\n_______________________________________"

        "content": "Could a presale crypto like Slayboy Token actually be a better investment than established giants like Ethereum and Cardano? Ethereum witnessed a whopping $13 billion exit from its market, while Cardano experienced price drops.

By bringing together blockchain technology and the adult entertainment industry, Slayboy Token is braving new frontiers and opening new possibilities. Keep reading to find out more.\n\nThe Bear Market and Its Ripple Effect\n\nA bear market has cast its shadow over the crypto realm, with Ethereum taking a hit as approximately $13 billion drained from its market. This phenomenon raises questions about investor sentiment toward this digital juggernaut. Simultaneously, Cardano has witnessed a slide in prices, adding to the overall market turmoil. The bear market, often considered a precursor to a bull market, is a pivotal moment in the crypto landscape.\n\n<<Explore New Realms Of Pleasure And Profit With Slayboy Token>>\n\nWhile Ethereum\u2019s potential $13 billion drop rings alarm bells, it\u2019s essential to remember that crypto markets are known for their volatility.

        "content": "A new player has entered the crypto scene with enticing features and good potential. That player is Meme Moguls (MGLS). The token which is just in the presale stage has surpassed the performance of great giants like Ethereum and Ripple.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Shows Sell Signal, Says Ali Martinez\n\nEthereum (ETH) started this week on a bullish note rising above the $2,000 mark as high as $2,128. Unfortunately, Ethereum\u2019s price has dipped to $2,000. Currently, various indicators suggest the likelihood of further declines in the coming days.\n\nEven crypto traders like Ali Martinez share this opinion. According to Ali, Ethereum\u2019s \u201cTD Sequential\u201d indicator is signaling a sell on the three-day Ethereum price chart. This comes as the asset tests a significant resistance range ranging from $2,000 to $2,150.\n\nThe analyst pointed at a possible price dump to $1,700. Currently, the price of Ethereum is showing mixed sentiment. It had dropped 2% on the daily chart while holding on to gains of 6.5% and 27.3% on the weekly and monthly Ethereum chart.\n\nRipple (XRP) Loses Gains After Recent XRP ETF Rumour\n\nRipple holders\u2019 positive outlook has grown immensely since Ripple\u2019s partial win against the US SEC in July. Ripple\u2019s price increased by over 80% and reached the $0.8 level. Unfortunately, the bearish market led to high selling pressure as Ripple cryptocurrency lost its gains.\n\nThe Ripple crypto dropped as low as $0.5 before picking pace during the Uptober market rally. So far, Ripple coin\u2019s November performance has been poor compared to other cryptocurrencies. Per CoinMarketCap, Ripple XRP price has dipped 3.4% to $0.6387.\n\nBoth its market cap and trading volume have dropped significantly, due to the recent fake BlackRock XRP ETF Trust filing. Still, Ripple\u2019s technical indicators point towards a price recovery in the coming months to the $0.7 region.\n\nMeme Moguls (MGLS), Bringing New Utility To the Meme Coin Sector\n\nWhile Ethereum and XRP are losing gains, meme coins continue to take over the crypto space. The meme-based asset industry has gained significant recognition in recent years. According to Statistics, the meme coin sector has a market capitalization of over $17.5 billion.\n\nThe interesting part is that these meme coins have little to no utility. In response to this, Meme Moguls has emerged as a solution, as it seeks to launch a meme-backed stock market. The project\u2019s objective is to unite the meme industry to foster a community for meme coin enthusiasts.\n\nUsers will gain access to memes-backed assets. The ecosystem will also encompass a wide range of services, all drawing inspiration from memes. A metaverse platform named Mogul Land will be introduced. This will enable meme traders to interact and mine tokens to enhance their returns.\n\nAnalysts have predicted significant growth for the MGLS token. Currently, Meme lovers have the opportunity to buy MGLS tokens at just $0.0019. Market experts are optimistic about the project and foresee a 1,000% increase in the coming months. Plus, joining the presale gives you a chance to earn up to $10,000 in giveaways at the end of the presale stage.\n\nVisit Meme Moguls\n\n."

        "title": "Ethereum Dominance Indicator: Key Barometer of Trends in the Crypto Sector - Cryptopolitan",
        "content": "From its early days, Ethereum has distinguished itself as a hub of groundbreaking developments in blockchain technology. As the originator of smart contracts, Ethereum has redefined the scope of blockchain applications, paving the way for a diverse range of DApps, innovative DeFi platforms, and the rapidly expanding universe of NFTs. These strides have solidified Ethereum dominance in the blockchain space and have also been instrumental in its market dominance.\n\nEthereum\u2019s journey and commanding market position intertwine with its core ethos of decentralization. This principle has garnered both acclaim and debate within the crypto community. As Ethereum continues to adapt and upgrade in response to the industry\u2019s challenges, its market dominance remains a key barometer of the evolving trends in the cryptocurrency sector.\n\nThe Rise of Ethereum\n\nEthereum\u2019s journey began as a vision in the mind of Vitalik Buterin, a programmer and co-founder of Bitcoin Magazine. Dissatisfied with Bitcoin\u2019s limitations, Buterin proposed a new platform in late 2013, one that would go beyond the financial use cases of Bitcoin. Ethereum\u2019s official launch in 2015 marked a pivotal moment in the history of blockchain technology. It wasn\u2019t just another cryptocurrency but a revolutionary platform designed to leverage blockchain technology for many applications far beyond digital currencies.\n\nThe true game-changer for Ethereum was the introduction of smart contracts. These are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into lines of code. Smart contracts operate autonomously and are immutable once deployed, ensuring high trust and security in digital transactions. This innovation opened the door to endless possibilities, allowing developers to create sophisticated DApps without intermediaries.\n\nBeing the first to market with such a versatile technology, Ethereum quickly established itself as the de facto platform for blockchain development. This first-mover advantage was crucial. It allowed Ethereum to build a strong community of developers and enthusiasts eager to explore and expand the capabilities of blockchain technology. This early start also meant that Ethereum became the standard for measuring other blockchain platforms.\n\nExpansion of Ethereum\u2019s Ecosystem\n\nEthereum\u2019s ecosystem saw exponential growth with the rise of DApps. These applications, from games to social networks, operate on a peer-to-peer network free from central control. Ethereum\u2019s flexible platform enabled developers to build a wide array of DApps, attracting a diverse user base to the Ethereum network.\n\nOne of the most significant developments in Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem has been the emergence of DeFi. These financial services, like lending, borrowing, and trading, operate on the blockchain without traditional financial intermediaries. Ethereum\u2019s smart contract functionality made it an ideal platform for DeFi applications, leading to a surge in innovation and investment in this sector.\n\nThe NFT boom further underscored Ethereum\u2019s dominance. NFTs are unique digital assets verified using blockchain technology, and Ethereum\u2019s blockchain has been the primary platform for minting, buying, and selling NFTs.
