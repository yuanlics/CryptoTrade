        "title": "Ethereum price retreats amidst strategic whale moves - AMBCrypto English",
        "content": "Two Ethereum whales sold off over 28,000 tokens.\n\nETH trades around $1,900 as the bull trend weakens further.\n\nThe price of Ethereum [ETH] has been undergoing a reversal over the last few days. Nevertheless, recent observations of whale activities suggest that these large wallets may be exploiting the current price range.\n\nEthereum on the move\n\nAs reported by LookonChain, an Ethereum whale sold off a substantial volume of ETH on 17th November, selling over 10,000 ETH.\n\nThe total value of this transaction amounted to $19.33 million, at $1,933 per token. Further analysis of the whale\u2019s activity revealed this was not an isolated occurrence.\n\nPrevious reports indicated the sale of over 6,000 tokens, resulting in a $12 million transaction, took place some days ago. These actions have created an impression that the whale is selling off its holdings.\n\nAdditionally, another whale, initially holding a long position on ETH, has recently sold off its ETH holdings.\n\nThis particular whale acquired 12,048 ETH in October for $21.3 million, entering into long positions on Aave and Compound.\n\nAt the time of writing, the whale had sold its ETH for $23.4 million, using the proceeds to settle its debt. Is this a strategic profit-taking move, a market dump, or a combination?\n\nImpact on the Ethereum netflow?\n\nAMBCrypto\u2019s examination of Ethereum movements across various exchanges revealed an interesting trend.\n\nDespite the moves from these whales, as mentioned earlier, there was a net outflow of ETH on 17th November. The netflow chart, as analyzed on CryptoQuant, showed that over 16,000 ETH left the exchanges, indicating a negative netflow during that period.\n\nHowever, as of this writing, there was a reversal in the netflow, with over 10,000 ETH flowing into exchanges.\n\nThis shift suggests that there is now an increase in the amount of ETH being deposited into exchanges, potentially for selling.\n\nWhales tapping into profit\n\nAMBCrypto analyzed the 60-day Market Value to Realized Value Ratio (MVRV) of Ethereum.\n\nThe analysis revealed potential motivations behind the observed market movements from the whales.\n\nAn initial examination of the Santiment chart indicated a rapid decline in MVRV attributed to the changing price trends. Around 9th November, the 60-day MVRV stood at over 25%.\n\nHowever, as of this writing, the MVRV had decreased significantly to around 7%.\n\nThis shift in MVRV suggests that the profit derived from the sales of ETH has experienced a substantial reduction, dropping from over 25% to the current 7%.\n\nRead Ethereum (ETH) Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nETH weakening bull run\n\nA review of the daily timeframe chart indicated that Ethereum continued to trend downward. At the time of this analysis, it reflected a 1.7% decrease in value, trading at around $1,920. This decline is underscored by the movement of its Relative Strength Index (RSI) line.\n\nThe RSI was situated in the overbought zone in the previous period, signifying a strong bull run. However, the current trend shows the RSI approaching the point of crossing below the neutral line, suggesting a weakening of the initial bull run."

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAccording to the on-chain analytics firm IntoTheBlock, Ethereum, the second largest cryptocurrency by market value, has seen significant outflows from exchanges in recent weeks. Over $1 billion in ETH has been removed from crypto exchanges within this said period.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nETH recorded $320M in exchange outflows this week, and over $1B through the last three weeks! pic.twitter.com/g1xJfh5p9U \u2014 IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) November 17, 2023\n\nEthereum has seen $320 million in exchange outflows this week and more than $1 billion in the previous three weeks. Exchange outflows frequently indicate that investors are moving funds from centralized exchanges to private wallets.\n\nOne prominent argument for increased exchange outflows is that long-term investors are removing assets to keep them for a longer period. This can be viewed as a vote of confidence in the long-term prospects of the cryptocurrency.\n\nETH was down 1.39% in the last 24 hours to $1,938 at the time of writing. According to IntoTheBlock, Ethereum fees have risen in tandem with market volatility and DeFi volumes.\n\nFidelity files for Ethereum ETF\n\nAccording to Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart, money management behemoth Fidelity has entered the spot Ethereum ETF competition by filing a 19b-4 with CBOE.\n\nFidelity will be the seventh entity to file for an Ethereum spot ETF, according to Seyffart.\n\nAccording to a Friday filing, Fidelity is looking to launch an exchange-traded fund that owns Ethereum's ETH, joining rival BlackRock in the crypto adoption push.\n\nThe Fidelity Ethereum Fund would be listed on a Cboe Global Markets exchange, but the SEC must decide whether to authorize the Ethereum ETF, as it would for others, including one from BlackRock.\n\nIn the latest development, the Securities and Exchange Commission delayed making a decision this week on whether to approve the Hashdex Nasdaq Ethereum ETF, which seeks to hold both spot Ethereum and futures contracts.\n\nThe SEC stated that it needed additional time to act and that it would make a decision by Jan. 1, 2024."

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nAdvanced developer tools and a thriving community make Ethereum an attractive option for building dApps.\n\nMeanwhile, Solana offers lower fees and faster transactions.\n\nNeon EVM enables Ethereum dApps to settle transactions on Solana.\n\nInteroperability promises to remove friction for users.\n\nWhen Solana was first conceived, supporters expected it to usurp Ethereum\u2019s throne as the world\u2019s preeminent smart contract platform. But these days, the Ethereum-killer narrative has given way to a focus on blockchain interoperability.\n\nMore than just a buzzword, interoperability is central to a Web3 philosophy committed to the free flow of information and value. It is also the driving force behind an increasingly connected ecosystem of decentralized apps (dApps) and services.\n\nThe dApp Developers Dilemma\n\nWith a headstart of several years, by the time the Solana mainnet launched, Ethereum already benefited from a strong network effect. Today, not only does it boast the most active developer community, but a powerful suite of dev tools and an established user base make Ethereum the go-to choice for most dApp builders.\n\nThat being said, the blockchain still has its drawbacks.\n\nCompared to Solana, Ethereum is slow, clunky and expensive. Sidechains and Layer 2s can scale capacity, but each has its trade-offs.\n\nIn 2023, rising interest in Solana\u2019s potential has even seen its native token SOL significantly outperform ETH. As Ark Invest CEO Cathie Woods put it recently, \u201cEther was faster and cheaper than Bitcoin in the day \u2014 that\u2019s how we got Ether. Solana is even faster and [more] cost-effective.\u201d\n\nBringing Solana\u2019s Power To Ethereum Developers\n\nLooking to create an Ethereum-like development environment on Solana, NeonEVM beta-launch occurred earlier this year, allowing Ethereum smart contracts to run on Solana for the first time.\n\n\u201cRight now, Ethereum is the biggest ecosystem in the market,\u201d CTO Andrey Falaleev said in an interview. \u201cBut without efficiency, it will not grow \u2013 there will be no evolution.\u201d\n\nFrom a developer\u2019s perspective, NeonEVM approximates the native Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). But the efficiency boost comes from Solana, with its superior transaction speed and lower gas fees.\n\nNeonEVM was designed to combine the best of Solana and Ethereum\n\nBy creating what Falaleev called \u201cone world of communication,\u201d the new platform allows two otherwise disconnected ecosystems can grow together.\n\nYet, if interoperability was just a matter of translation, a code compiler like Solang would be sufficient. To realize the full potential of Ethereum compatibility, NeonEVM needs a way to bridge assets from one blockchain to the other.\n\nInteroperability For A Frictionless User Experience\n\nTo port tokens from Ethereum, NeonEVM tapped deBridge. The latter is a decentralized interoperability layer that can transfer data and all manner of different tokens between various blockchains.\n\nThe most simple model for cross-chain bridges sees assets locked at one end while minting their wrapped equivalent at the other. But deBridge\u2019s solution is a far more dynamic and general-purpose protocol for cross-chain transport and messaging.\n\nAs CEO Alex Smirnov explained to CCN, deBridge \u201callows any projects or any token holders to bridge any asset from other ecosystems to Neon.\u201d For NeonEVM-based dApps, that means users don\u2019t need to hold the network\u2019s native token \u2013 NEON \u2013 but can pay gas fees in the transaction token.\n\nThe deBridge ecosystem is now seeing its highest daily volumes ever, much of it being passed between Ethereum and @Solana . It's only natural we should have Spaces with @ZetaMarkets and @SquadsProtocol \ud83d\udd25 See you there in an hour\ud83d\udc4bhttps://t.co/gR2yPNSl1A \u2014 deBridge (@deBridgeFinance) November 16, 2023\n\nBecause solutions like NeonEVM and DeBridge increasingly abstract away the moving parts, \u201cusers can interact with any new data without the need to think about the underlying infrastructure, and even without the need to think about switching wallets or switching networks,\u201d Smirnov observed.\n\nWith Web3 technologies seemingly on the cusp of mainstream adoption, this emerging multichain environment demonstrates the true power of interoperability: its potential to transform the experience of everyday dApp users."

        "content": "Fidelity Investments has filed for a spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF), as seen in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Nov. 17.\n\nCboe BZX submitted a 19b-4 filing describing a proposed rule change that would allow it to list and trade shares of Fidelity\u2019s planned fund. The new Ethereum proposal closely resembles Fidelity\u2019s spot Bitcoin ETF proposal, submitted to the SEC in late June.\n\nBoth Fidelity filings follow similar applications from the company\u2019s main competitor, BlackRock. BlackRock submitted an S-1 filing for its spot Ethereum ETF just days ago, on Nov. 15, and applied for its spot Bitcoin ETF months earlier in June.\n\nThe close timing between the competing filings may be explained by each asset manager\u2019s exceptionally high standing. BlackRock is the largest asset manager in the world, with $9 trillion in assets under management. Fidelity, on the other hand, is the third largest asset manager in the world, with $4.2 trillion in assets under management.\n\nOther firms have pending applications\n\nSeveral other asset managers have also applied for their own spot Bitcoin ETFs and spot Ethereum ETFs following the above high-profile filings.\n\nThe SEC is expected to approve or reject a Bitcoin ETF by Jan. 10, 2024. That decision concerns a spot Bitcoin application from ARK Invest, which submitted its application in May \u2014 about one month before BlackRock submitted its more influential filing. The SEC could apply its decision to other pending ETF applications, many of which are intentionally similar to one another, in order to meet expected requirements.\n\nThough the SEC will evaluate any spot Ethereum ETFs separately from spot Bitcoin ETFs, the approval of one type of fund may pave the way for the other.\n\nIt should be noted that although the SEC has not yet approved any Bitcoin or Ethereum spot ETF, it has approved futures ETFs of both types in recent months and years."

        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction: The altcoins market is experiencing a phase of correction amid resistance faced by Bitcoin at the $38,000 level. Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has not been exempt from this trend as It recently underwent a sharp reversal from the $2,136 mark. The coin price witnessed a 10.7% drop in its market value over the past week, bringing it to the current trading price of approximately $1,945. Will this correction be extended further?\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin (BTC) Topples Ethereum in Transaction Fees After 3 Years\n\nadvertisement\n\nWill ETH Price Revist $1700?\n\nThe $1900 and $1830 are strong support amid the current correction.\n\nThe Ethereum price is prevented from a major downfall until the two trendlines are intact.\n\nThe intraday trading volume in Ether is $12.6 Billion, indicating a 16% gain.\n\nSource- Tradingview\n\nThe Ethereum price showed notable growth in October and early November, rising from $1,522 to a high of $2,137, marking a 41% increase. This bullish recovery was significant as it surged above the crucial daily Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) of 20, 50, 100, and 200, reflecting an early sign of trend reversal.\n\nHowever, after forming a local top at around $2,137, the coin entered a minor correction phase. Currently trading at $1,341, the buyers are trying to sustain above the 32.8% Fibonacci retracement level.\n\nUntil the price is still above the 50% retracement level($1830), the overall bullish trend may still be intact. If the ETH price sustains above the $1,830 mark, it could potentially rebound strongly, and continue its bullish trajectory to $2,240, which corresponds to the resistance level of a rising wedge pattern.\n\nA breakout above this barrier could signify a robust bullish trend ahead.\n\nIs ETH Poised for Further Correction?\n\nThe Ethereum price movement is currently confined within the converging trendlines of a wedge pattern, suggesting a potential for a slow yet steady recovery. However, as the price approaches the upper trendline of the wedge, there may be an increase in selling pressure, particularly around the $2200 mark. Historical trends indicate that retests of this upper trendline often lead to significant corrections, potentially driving the price down to the lower trendline of the wedge, which could mean a correction towards the $1,700 level.\n\nExponential Moving Average (EMA): The 20-day EMA is providing dynamic support to the declining Ethereum price.\n\nMoving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD): A bearish crossover between the MACD line and its signal line suggests a correction sentiment in the market."

        "content": "Amid the ongoing Ethereum scandal, former Ethereum advisor and attorney Steven Nerayoff has recently revealed how he plans on sharing proof of Ethereum founders\u2019 fraud activities in the early days of the cryptocurrency asset.\n\nEthereum Founders\u2019 Fraudulent Acts To Be In Lawsuit\n\nFollowing an X (formerly Twitter) post by a user Heidi from Crytotips, the crypto enthusiast was seen trying to underscore the lack of authenticity from Nerayoff\u2019s claims. According to her, his accusations were a no-brainer due to the disclosure lacking proof of his accusations.\n\nHowever, Nerayoff in response to the video, asserted that he never claimed his accusations were going to be in the disclosure highlighting the crypto enthusiast\u2019s lack of proper research. He further added that he is going to reveal the fraudulent acts of the founders in his lawsuit.\n\nNerayoff had always noted that his recording was not actually linked to his accusations but rather his involvement with Vitalik Buterin. \u201cThe recording isn\u2019t directly related to the fraud but will illuminate a lot of what was happening & show my involvement. The fraud will be in the lawsuit,\u201d Nerayoff stated.\n\nFurthermore, the crypto expert also pointed out Nerayoff\u2019s accusations towards federal agencies. According to her, the former advisor was a little paranoid with his accusations.\n\nDuring an X space, Nerayoff accused some high federal agencies of fabricating evidence against him in order to take him out. These include the SEC, FBI, and the DOJ.\n\nTotal crypto market cap currently at $1.3 trillion. Chart: TradingView.com\n\nNonetheless, in response to that, Nerayoff has asserted that this was actually proven and publicly filed. \u201cThe paranoia about the agencies? Well, that\u2019s actually proven & publicly filed,\u201d Nerayoff stated.\n\nCrypto Asset Is Not Decentralized From The Onset\n\nIt appears Nerayoff\u2019s claims about ETH not being decentralized from the early days are authentic.\n\nThe post also saw the crypto enthusiast pointing out Nerayoff\u2019s claims of ETH not being decentralized from the beginning. According to her, cryptocurrencies are not expected to be decentralized from the start and only the core team members know about a crypto asset from the start.\n\nIf the expert is right then this basically means Will Hinman\u2019s speech in 2017, about the asset being decentralized from the start was inaccurate.\n\nDuring the early days of the asset, Hinman asserted the decentralized nature of ETH, when it was considered as a security by the SEC. According to him, ETH was too decentralized to be considered a security.\n\nSo far, both founders still have not responded to Nerayoff\u2019s accusations. Nerayoff believes that their silence is due to the evidence he has against them.\n\n\u201cVitalik & Lubin are vicious if they have leverage. Lubin said to me in July 2018 about a network \u201cIt\u2019s a centralized piece of sh*t\u201d right after the Hinman speech! They stay silent because I\u2019ll drop more receipts,\u201d Nerayoff stated.\n\nFeatured image from Pixabay\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

Connecting these swing points using trend lines, reveals an ascending triangle setup. A decisive weekly candlestick close above the triangle\u2019s horizontal resistance level at $2,000 will signal a breakout.\n\nIn such a case, this technical formation forecasts a 43% rally to $2,943, obtained by measuring the distance between the first swing high and swing low to the breakout point of $2,000.\n\nCurrently, Ethereum price sits above the Momentum Reversal Indicator\u2019s (MRI) resistance level of $1,936 and below the ascending triangle\u2019s horizontal resistance level. From the looks of it, ETH seems to have flipped the $1,936 hurdle into a support floor.\n\nIf Bitcoin price does not crash wildly in the upcoming weeks, Ethereum price is set to break out and kickstart an upswing to $2,943. But this move is likely to face resistance around the $2,539 hurdle, which served as a critical support level in March 2022.\n\nWhile $2,943 is the theoretical target, ETH could rise higher and tag the next MRI resistance level of $3,186.

        "title": "Here\u2019s what ChatGPT expects from Ethereum for 2024 - AMBCrypto English",
        "content": "Disclaimer: The information presented does not constitute financial, investment, trading, or other types of advice and is solely the writer\u2019s opinion.\n\nThe last seven days witnessed some significant developments amid the ongoing bull run.\n\nOn 15 November, asset management giant Blackrock\u2019s spot Ethereum [ETH] exchange-traded fund (ETF) application officially made its way to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) desk.\n\nThe same day, the SEC notified that it had delayed its decision to approve the rule change requested by Grayscale Investments to convert its Ethereum fund to Futures Ether ETF. The SEC now has until 1 January 2024 to make a decision. It was in September that the asset manager had filed for the change.\n\nThe anticipation around ETFs has certainly led to a wild price rally on the charts. It has, however, led many to question how far such developments could adversely affect the decentralized model of the underlying blockchain technology of the crypto market. This is the reason why AMBCrypto too has looked at what\u2019s in the future for Ethereum.\n\nHow it began and subsequently split\n\nA child of Vitalik Buterin, the Ethereum blockchain network was first explored in a whitepaper in 2014. His colleagues on the project included Gavin Wood, Charles Hoskinson, Anthony Di Iorio, and Joseph Lubin.\n\nSubsequently, the team founded a Swiss non-profit foundation, the Ethereum Foundation (Stiftung Ethereum). The project was launched in 2015.\n\nEthereum was created with the goal of being scalable, programmable, secure, and decentralized. It natively supports smart contracts, a key component of decentralized apps. Smart contracts, in tandem with blockchain technology, enable a large number of decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.\n\nUsers can also generate and exchange non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which are tokens that can be linked to specific digital assets such as photos. Furthermore, several other cryptocurrencies use the ERC-20 token standard on top of the Ethereum blockchain and have used it for initial coin offerings.\n\nOnly a year after its launch, the project split into Ethereum and Ethereum Classic [ETC].\n\nWhat happened was that in 2016, a group of network participants gained majority control of the Ethereum blockchain to steal ether worth more than $50 million which had been raised for a project. Most of the Ethereum community opted to reverse the theft by invalidating the existing Ethereum blockchain and approving a blockchain with a revised history\u2014Ethereum.\n\nHowever, a fraction of the community chose to maintain the original version of the Ethereum blockchain. The unaltered version of the blockchain permanently split to become Ethereum Classic.\n\nThe event came to be known as the Hard Fork.\n\nThe Merge and the Shapella\n\nEthereum initially employed the proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism. It required energy-intensive computing referred to as mining to validate blocks.\n\nOwing to criticism around the mechanism\u2019s environmental impact, the project transitioned to proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism in September 2022. The event came to be known as the Merge.\n\nIt is critical at this juncture that we understand what both these mechanisms are and how they differ.\n\nA consensus mechanism consists of the rules and protocols that govern how a blockchain network reaches an agreement on its state. The two most popular mechanisms are PoW and PoS.\n\nPoW requires the utilization of computational power by miners to solve challenging mathematical riddles and validate transactions. The first miner who solves the challenge receives fresh coins and transaction fees. Although it is though to be more secure and decentralized, it also uses a significant amount of energy and resources.\n\nInstead of requiring miners to solve problems, PoS requires validators to stake some of their coins as collateral. The network then chooses a validator at random to construct a new block depending on stake size and other parameters. The validator is compensated with transaction fees rather than fresh currencies.\n\nPoS is considered more scalable and energy-efficient than PoW.\n\nAt press time, a total of 28,195,445 ETH tokens were staked, valued at $55.6 billion.\n\nETH is the second-largest cryptocurrency in the world, with a market cap above $233 billion.\n\nA recent CoinGecko report put Ethereum as the top Layer-1 (L1) blockchain. Its total value locked (TVL) stood at $23.0 billion in October 2023.\n\nIn 2023, it reached its yearly peak TVL of $31.5 billion in April. This was shortly after the Merge.\n\nAt this point, we decided it\u2019s a good time to solicit ChatGPT, the pioneering AI bot, for critical advice on these developments.\n\nChatGPT has proven to be valuable for traders and analysts. I spoke to ChatGPT about these development while touching a bit on ETH\u2019s price.\n\nAt first, ChatGPT wasn\u2019t able to provide any details. So I decided to educate and jailbreak it.\n\nWe then asked it about the impact of the Merge on Ethereum\u2019s price.\n\nThe bot told me that the Merge catalyzed a surge in demand and confidence. Its response was not a departure from real-time data.\n\nIn April 2023, Ethereum\u2019s Shanghai hard fork, also referred to as Shapella, got finalized. The upgrade allowed users to unstake their ETH tokens for the first time since December 2020.\n\nNotably, the Shapella is a combination of the Shanghai and Capella upgrade. The Shanghai upgrade takes place on the execution level, while Capella takes place on the consensus level.\n\nThe upgrade was the most significant development of the second-largest blockchain since the Merge.\n\nIs Ethereum a commodity or a security?\n\nSimilar to most cryptocurrencies, there has been a lot of debate over the fact whether Ethereum is a commodity or a security.\n\nIn a critical Uniswap court case, the judge ruled in August that ETH is a commodity. The SEC has shied away from doing so even if it hasn\u2019t gone after ether like other tokens.\n\nRecently, Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart underlined the SEC\u2019s unsaid stance over the issue.\n\nEven if SEC won\u2019t explicitly claim ETH to be a commodity in the way that they do for Bitcoin. They have implicitly accepted its commodity status for years. Huge shoutout to @SGJohnsson who has been critical in forming some of my views on this topic. https://t.co/vLq2abeJNO \u2014 James Seyffart (@JSeyff) November 16, 2023\n\nHowever, we should also take note of any non-explicit classification so far. The stance of regulatory bodies has also evolved with years, with courts intervening time and again.\n\nI asked ChatGPT about Ethereum\u2019s future performance\n\nEthereum has slowly emerged as one of the most prominent blockchain networks. As ideated, it supports a large number of L2 blockchains. The TVL of Ethereum-based L2 networks recently surged to an all-time high, surpassing $13.8 billion\n\n\ud83d\udcc8 The Total Value Locked (TVL) in all #Ethereum Layer 2 networks has surged to an all-time high, surpassing $13.8 billion. \ud83e\udd47 @Arbitrum takes the lead with TVL of $7.5 billion.https://t.co/5mn1kjq991 pic.twitter.com/Vr4GOgVPGX \u2014 GN Crypto \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\udde6 (@GNcrypto_news) November 16, 2023\n\nThanks to the recent bull run, ETH has been trading around the $2,000-mark for the past few days. At press time, ETH was exchanging hands at $1,986.50.\n\nWhile Ethereum\u2019s Relative Strength Index (RSI) rested below the neutral 50-mark, its Money Flow Index (MFI) rested above it. It seemed that the bears and bulls are engaged in a tug of war in regard to ETH.\n\nWe then asked ChatGPT to predict Ethereum\u2019s price towards the end of the first quarter in 2024.\n\nIt forecasted ETH\u2019s price to git $7,000 by the end of Q1 2024. In essence, it expected ETH to surge more than 3x during the next five months \u2014 an extraordinary expectation, to be frank.\n\nNext, we asked it what it thinks of ETH\u2019s price by the end of the next year.\n\nThe bot told me that it predicted ETH to reach $10,000 by the end of 2024. It expected the cryptocurrency to rise 5x over the next year.\n\nWhile it is a very high expectation, we shouldn\u2019t outright dismiss it. We are yet to see the wider implications of the ETFs on the crypto market. It is quite possible it might lead to wider adoption, leading to a surge in token prices.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nConclusion\n\nFollowing the encounter with ChatGPT, I must admit that it may be a good idea to leverage its capabilities. As technology develops, so does its potential to revolutionize the cryptocurrency ecosystem.\n\nBesides, there has been a slow rate in the network growth of several crypto projects recently. But with ChatGPT available, crypto education and adoption could improve.\n\nMore importantly, you may want to take its \u201cclassic\u201d response a little seriously.\n\nAs far as Ethereum\u2019s price analysis and prediction are concerned, ChatGPT turned out to be a reliable ally. You only need to interact with it enough and it will guide you to the moon.\n\nWhile ChatGPT predicts ETH to hit the price of $10K by the end of 2024, its on-chart metrics don\u2019t suggest a bull run."

A similar groundbreaking development is to arrive to EVM rollups as a detailed rollup improvement proposal is out.\n\nThis proposal might change game in Ethereum-based rollups\n\nAlexander Forshtat, a software developer of Ethereum Foundation, published a proposal dubbed Roadmap for Native Account Abstraction Introduction or RIP-7560: Native Account Abstraction. It is the first attempt to employ the concept of AA within the ecosystem of rollups, i.e., second-layer scaling solutions for Ethereum (ETH).\n\nLet 'er RIP! \u2728\n\n\n\nNative Account Abstraction for rollups standardization that is https://t.co/hR0MU6inuh \u2014 erc4337 (@erc4337) November 18, 2023\n\nThe activation of AA in EVM rollups is a crucial step for the Ethereum (ETH) segment of Web3. Its L1 and L2s should have similar AA designs to establish a \"continuous ecosystem.\"\n\nThe implementation of AA in rollups would require three changes in smart contract accounts: EntryPoint address adjustment, validateUserOp function rewrite and some advances in transaction logics.\n\nSome changes are also required to adjust Paymaster operations and the signature aggregation process. Validation code rules, staking and reputation systems in rollups will look like in the post-ERC 4337 Ethereum (ETH) mainnet.\n\nIn the last two days, Ethereum (ETH) enthusiasts have already submitted a number of comments in the project's GitHub repository.\n\nNative account abstraction standard to land in all L1s and L2s\n\nThe author of the proposal is optimistic about the prospects of its development and adoption as well as its potential role in Ethereum's (ETH) evolution:\n\nWe believe standardization and network effect are critical to the success of any Account Abstraction initiatives, so we are inviting everyone to participate in the creation of the Native Account Abstraction standard that can be adopted by all Layer-2 and Layer-1 networks.\n\nAs covered by U.Today previously, ERC 4337 \"Account Abstraction\" was activated on the Ethereum (ETH) mainnet in March 2023.\n\nWith account abstraction, Ethereum (ETH) on-chain wallets (externally-owned accounts) can be equipped with smart contracts functionality.\n\nThe new class of accounts \u2014 smart contract accounts \u2014 unlocks new opportunities for real-world applications on Ethereum (ETH)."

The token\u2019s demand kept increasing even when its price peaked during the last bull rally. However, ETH witnessed a correction of late as its weekly chart turned red.\n\nEthereum\u2019s demand is skyrocketing\n\nIntoTheBlock posted a tweet on the 18th of November, which highlighted how Ethereum\u2019s exchange outflow increased. For starters, exchange outflow is defined as the number of coins withdrawn from the exchange wallets.\n\nWhenever the metric rises, it indicates that the demand is increasing. As per the tweet, ETH recorded $320 million in exchange outflows this week.\n\nAdditionally, the token also witnessed an exchange outflow of more than $1 billion over the last three weeks, suggesting that buying pressure was high.\n\nETH recorded $320M in exchange outflows this week, and over $1B through the last three weeks! pic.twitter.com/g1xJfh5p9U \u2014 IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) November 17, 2023\n\nThe fact that Ethereum\u2019s demand was high was further proven when AMBCrypto checked Santiment\u2019s chart.

In fact, ETH\u2019s price can plummet further until it tests a key support level of $1,700. Once the token tests the support level, it can then initiate a fresh bull rally.\n\nTherefore, this might be a good opportunity for investors to actually stockpile more tokens, as the chances of an uptrend in the weeks to follow seemed high.\n\nAMBCrypto then checked ETH\u2019s daily chart to better understand what to expect from the token in the short term. Ethereum\u2019s MACD displayed a bearish crossover. The token\u2019s Relative Strength Index (RSI) also registered a downtick and took a sideways path.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nThis hinted at a few more slow-moving days.\n\nNonetheless, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) remained bullish as it went up."

        "title": "Bitcoin Outpaces Ethereum In Transaction Fees For First Time In 3 Years On Spot ETF Excitement - ZyCrypto",
        "content": "Advertisement\n\nThe possibility of a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) hitting the United States market has boosted demand for the crypto king, causing a spike in transaction costs while showering miners of BTC with extra revenue.\n\nBitcoin is now leading the charge in daily transaction fees, usurping ether for the first time in three years ahead of an all-important halving event.\n\nStealing Ether\u2019s Crown\n\nRoughly three years ago, ether toppled its big brother, bitcoin, in terms of transaction fees owing to its multifaceted blockchain network, which supported a wide range of decentralized applications. This utility of the world\u2019s largest programmable blockchain drew considerable user activity, specifically in the fast-growing sector of decentralized finance (DeFi) yield farming and non-fungible token (NFT) trading, which resulted in significantly higher transaction fees on the Ethereum network.\n\nThis period of ethereum being king seems to have ended as Bitcoin\u2019s daily total fees, which users pay to miners, have surged to $11.63 million on Nov 16, as per data from CryptoFees. For comparison, Ethereum registered only $8.44 million during the same timeframe. The average transaction fee on Bitcoin has shot above $18.69, which marks an almost 1,000% increase from the fee seen on Nov. 1.\n\nAs for the price, one bitcoin is now worth $36,527. The premier crypto has been surging on the anticipation that the SEC is close to approving one of several Bitcoin ETFs filed by Wall Street titans like BlackRock. This likely buoyed investor sentiment \u2014 as BTC prices nearly crossed the $38,000 mark.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nImplications For Bitcoin Miners\n\nThe surging transaction fees, although a pain for Bitcoin users are considered a positive development by some market pundits. They contend that the higher fees strengthen the security of the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nMoreover, the significantly expensive transactional activity is a boon to the beleaguered miners who secure and maintain the Bitcoin network as they are rewarded in BTC fees for processing users\u2019 transactions.\n\nThis is particularly important for the miners as Bitcoin\u2019s quadrennial halving event scheduled for April 2024 draws closer, slashing block rewards for the industry by 50%."

        "title": "Ethereum Users Face 219% Increase in Fees; AI Crypto Poised for Significant Uptrend - NullTX",
        "content": "InQubeta (QUBE) and Ethereum (ETH) are two of the top altcoins to buy now thanks to the exponential growth both projects are expected to enjoy in 2024 and beyond. Ethereum prices have surged 31% in the past month, but not without creating some controversy as fees rise by 219%.\n\nThat\u2019s always one of the issues cryptocurrency users often find themselves dealing with during price breakouts. Bitcoin (BTC) fees have grown even more in recent weeks, with users paying as much as $16 to transfer BTC. High fees defeat the purpose of cryptocurrencies since many were initially designed to help people avoid the high fees associated with traditional money transfers.\n\nInQubeta has also enjoyed substantial growth since its presale started, earning early investors 130%, and those who buy tokens now get to earn 90% profits before tokens are launched on exchanges.\n\nInQubeta (QUBE) emerges as one of the top altcoins to buy now\n\nInQubeta takes on traditional investment avenues by creating an easier way to invest in artificial intelligence (AI). It uses its Ethereum-built blockchain to create an investment process that involves ERC20 coins, fractionalization, and smart contracts.\n\nInQubeta\u2019s link to AI has helped propel its presale success as it raises over $4.9 million in token sales. Companies that help to advance artificial intelligence have been a favorite of investors for the past decade as investments in the space grow exponentially.\n\nMore than $1.5 trillion is anticipated to be guided into the AI space by 2030, and InQubeta is positioned to help direct some of these funds to startups in its ecosystem.\n\nHere\u2019s what investing looks like on the InQubeta ecosystem:\n\nAI start-ups are evaluated before getting access to InQubeta\u2019s network\n\nThese companies develop ERC20 coins with investment opportunities minted into them. These tokens are then added to the ERC20 token list on the marketplace\n\nwith investment opportunities minted into them. These tokens are then added to the on the marketplace Investors are provided with all the information they need to make informed decisions on the marketplace, and purchases are made with QUBE\n\nInvestors get custody of their NFTs and they can be resold on the marketplace anytime they choose\n\nInQubeta investors don\u2019t have to invest in AI startups to earn considerable profits. Holding on to QUBE or staking may earn just as much. Tokens are drastically undervalued at their current price of $0.0161, and some projections have QUBE prices reaching a dollar once tokens are available on exchanges.\n\nThe supply of QUBE being capped at 1.5 billion means it also has to build a market capitalization of $1.5 billion for tokens to be priced at a dollar. That\u2019s a feat many expect the project to accomplish in the coming years since meme coins like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) have built up exponentially larger market shares. This means a $1,000 investment in QUBE could be worth over $62,000 by this time next year. No other altcoin is expected to enjoy that much growth during the same period.\n\nEthereum\u2019s high fees become a hot topic again\n\nEthereum transaction fees are once again at ridiculous levels as its prices have surged 30% in the past month. The uptick in fees has led to users paying exorbitant fees, with the average Gwei prices reaching 227. This surge in fees has a considerable impact on the cost of network operations.\n\nToken swaps now cost up to $160, while more complex trades, like those that involve NFTs, can cost as much as $270. These fees price out users who make small trades since they cannot justify spending so much on fees for their small purchases.\n\nDevelopers will have to come up with a better solution to keep fees reasonable regardless of how much prices grow to avoid stifling the development of new applications and the ecosystem\u2019s growth.\n\nSummary\n\nQUBE and ETH are top altcoins to buy now as projections have both projects enjoying exponential growth in 2024. QUBE will likely enjoy more growth as predictions have its prices rising as much as 100x when released on exchanges.\n\nVisit InQubeta Presale\n\nJoin The InQubeta Communities\n\nDisclosure: This is a sponsored press release.

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nA recent flurry of activity by ETH whales has injected both curiosity and anticipation into the market. According to on-chain analytics from Lookonchain, one such whale has repositioned their holdings in a notable manner, selling 12,048 ETH worth approximately $23.4 million to repay debt, after initially acquiring it from Binance when ETH was trading around $1,768\u200b\u200b.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis whale, along with others, has utilized ETH as collateral on DeFi lending platforms such as Aave and Compound to borrow stablecoins, with the intention of purchasing even more ETH. This suggests a strategic vote of confidence in ETH's price appreciation potential. Additionally, the withdrawal of a hefty sum of 21,076 ETH, valued at $41.23 million, from Bitfinex by two new wallets indicates a trend of whales moving their funds to cold storage for long-term holding. This behavior typically results in decreased liquidity on exchanges and can potentially buoy the market price\u200b\u200b.\n\nIn a significant transaction, the aforementioned whale placed 7,324 ETH, equating to $14.3 million, as collateral on Compound to borrow $9 million USDT, which was subsequently transferred to Binance. This sequence of transactions is likely aimed at purchasing additional ETH, thus expanding the whale's position in the currency. Such actions reflect a bullish outlook, with these major players positioning themselves to benefit from anticipated price increases and potentially exerting upward pressure on ETH's value\u200b\u200b.\n\nThe strategic moves by ETH whales underscore a sustained bullish sentiment and a long-term investment perspective. With ETH maintaining support above the $1,970 mark, these investors are seizing opportunities to accumulate more of the cryptocurrency. However, the market remains vigilant, as extensive selling by these whales could prompt a market pullback if they choose to realize profits."

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) gas fees have consistently increased in the last month, driving developers, investors, and cryptocurrency users to look for layer-1 blockchain alternatives.\n\nAs observed, Ethereum average gas fees went from $1.5 on October 15, registered by BitInfoCharts, to the last recorded average of $6.35 on November 17. Notably, users paid $6.9 million in ETH gas fees on a single day, according to data from CryptoQuant.\n\nEthereum average transaction fee historical chart. Source: BitInfoCharts\n\nIn the past, these high-fee scenarios have driven demand and liquidity toward alternative layer-1 blockchain with a similar proposition to Ethereum and lower gas fees. With that in mind, Finbold turned once again to ChatGPT to get insights into possible good picks for this context.\n\nBNB Chain (BNB)\n\nChatGPT\u2019s first pick was the BNB Chain (BNB) a layer-1 blockchain created by the cryptocurrency exchange Binance. Interestingly, BNB\u2019s price is up 14.66% in the last month, since Ethereum gas fees started increasing. At the time of publication, Binance\u2019s native token is trading at $242.13.\n\nBNB 1-month price chart. Source: Finbold\n\n\u201cBinance Smart Chain is known for its low transaction fees and fast confirmation times. It operates in parallel with Binance Chain but adds smart contract functionality. BNB is the native cryptocurrency of Binance Smart Chain and can be used to pay for transaction fees and participate in various decentralized applications (DApps). Binance Smart Chain\u2019s architecture prioritizes high throughput and low fees, making it an attractive option for users seeking alternatives to Ethereum.\u201d \u2014 ChatGPT\n\nSolana (SOL)\n\nNotably, Solana (SOL) was one of the best-performing cryptocurrencies of the year and is ChatGPT\u2019s second pick for more efficient gas fees. Its native token, SOL, is trading at $56.13 by press time, with fantastic monthly gains of 136%.\n\nSOL 1-month price chart. Source: Finbold\n\n\u201cSolana has gained attention for its high throughput and low transaction costs. It uses a unique consensus mechanism called Proof of History (PoH) to improve scalability and reduce transaction confirmation times. Solana aims to provide a fast and cost-effective platform for decentralized applications. Its growing ecosystem includes various projects and decentralized exchanges (DEXs) that leverage its performance advantages over Ethereum.\u201d \u2014 ChatGPT\n\nCardano (ADA)\n\nMeanwhile, Cardano (ADA), ChatGPT\u2019s third pick, is the second-best performer among the three low-fee \u201cEthereum killers.\u201d The native token ADA is priced at $0.36 with 46% gains in the last 30 days.\n\nADA 1-month price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nNevertheless, it is important to say that other factors, such as security, scalability, decentralization, and adoption, must be considered when evaluating each of these mentioned projects.\n\nThere are no guarantees that any of these layer-1 blockchains will be able to conquer any meaningful share of Ethereum\u2019s capitalization and total value locked on DeFi, despite offering a more efficient alternative for gas fees and network scalability.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

Fidelity\u2019s application comes a day after BlackRock filed an S-1 form with the SEC for its spot Ethereum ETF.\n\nSEC Receives Fidelity\u2019s Spot Ether ETF Application\n\nFidelity has joined BlackRock in the race for a spot-based ether ETF.\n\nIn a Nov. 17 filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Fidelity said the ETF aims to \u201ctrack the performance of Ether, as measured by the performance of the Fidelity Ethereum Index.\u201d The index symbolizes the U.S. dollar price of ETH based on trading activity across major ether trading platforms.\n\n\u201cAccording to the Registration Statement, each Share will represent a fractional undivided beneficial interest in the Trust\u2019s net assets. The Trust\u2019s assets will consist of ETH held by the Custodian on behalf of the Trust,\u201d the filing reads.\n\nThe Fidelity Ethereum fund\u2019s shares would trade on the Cboe BZX Exchange under the ticker symbol ETHF.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThey are the seventh filer for spot Ethereum,\u201d Bloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffart posited on the X platform, citing previous filings from BlackRock, Grayscale, Ark Invest, Invesco & Galaxy, VanEck, and Hashdex.\n\nWhy ETF Approval Would Be A Big Deal\n\nCrypto enthusiasts keenly await an SEC approval of one or more ETF applications as the SEC has been reluctant to approve one, often citing possible market manipulation as the biggest risk factor.\n\nAccording to optimists, ETFs that hold BTC or ETH, the market\u2019s largest cryptocurrencies, could drastically shake up the crypto market as they could ease mainstream investors\u2019 path into digital assets.\n\nFidelity noted in the filing that U.S. investors lack a \u201cregulated, U.S. exchange-traded vehicle to gain exposure to ETH\u201d. The giant financial firm further argued that existing venues for gaining exposure to the token entail encountering counter-party risk, legal uncertainty, and technical risk. \u201cMeanwhile, investors in other countries\u2026 are able to use more traditional exchange-listed and traded products,\u201d Fidelity continued.\n\nTo this end, Fidelity believes approval of a spot ether ETF would represent a \u201cmajor win for the protection of U.S. investors in the crypto asset space.\u201d\n\nFidelity submitted paperwork for a spot Bitcoin ETF in June, shortly after BlackRock took the big leap."

        "title": "3 Things You Should Know Before Staking Crypto For Passive Income - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "While crypto staking has existed for years, it really only became mainstream with investors during the past year. This coincided with the transformation of Ethereum (ETH 2.43%) into a proof-of-stake blockchain as part of The Merge. Suddenly, people began asking what crypto staking was, and how they could make money from it. As a result, crypto staking went from something only the early blockchain and crypto pioneers were doing to something the average investor on Main Street was doing.\n\nWhat makes crypto staking so unique is that it is both a technical process that involves the inner workings of a blockchain, and a form of financial investment. At times, this duality can be confusing for investors, who may only be thinking of crypto staking as a form of passive income. With that in mind, here are three things to keep in mind before staking your crypto.\n\nA flawed analogy?\n\nThe classic analogy is that crypto staking is much like depositing your funds in a high-yield savings account. You are depositing your cryptocurrency with a blockchain, much like depositing your dollars with a bank. And, in exchange for doing so, you are paid a specified reward rate, usually expressed in terms of an annual percentage yield (APY). For most cryptos, these APYs range from 2% to 10%. For example, on Coinbase Global (COIN 2.72%), you can currently earn 3.35% on your Ethereum holdings.\n\nBut this analogy has several flaws. For one, blockchains are not banks. That means your deposit is not guaranteed by anyone, and certainly not by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. That helps to explain why APYs for some cryptos can be as high as 45% -- think of this as a risk premium for depositing your funds with a potentially unreliable blockchain counterparty.\n\nMoreover, when you stake your crypto, you are paid rewards in the form of the cryptocurrency you deposited, and not in dollars. Thus, when you compare APYs, you need to be thinking in terms of how much crypto your investment is yielding, and not how many dollars it is yielding.\n\nFinally, keep in mind that staking usually requires you to \"lock up\" your crypto for a specified period of time, during which you will not have access to it. This might not seem like a big deal at first, especially if you are a long-term investor, but what if your crypto starts to lose value while it's locked up? When you get your crypto back at the end of the staking period, it may have lost significant value. The math here can be brutal. If your crypto loses even 10% of its value over a 12-month period, and you are earning a 5% APY, it's hard to see how you're going to make a profit on this investment.\n\nDifferent types of staking\n\nConfusing matters further is that there are different types of staking.\u200b\u200b One form of staking requires you to operate a node on the blockchain network and use your own computer hardware to validate transactions on the blockchain. But this is neither easy nor passive. If you want to become a validator on the Ethereum blockchain, for example, you need to make a minimum investment of 32 ETH (worth almost $64,000 at today's prices) and have the suitable tech hardware to run a blockchain node 24/7.\n\nThat's not what most people are talking about when they talk about crypto staking as a form of passive income. Instead, they are usually talking about staking crypto via a cryptocurrency exchange such as Coinbase. This process is much easier -- it usually only requires a few clicks online, and you're ready to go. As long as you already own the cryptocurrency you want to stake, you just tell the crypto exchange how much you want to stake and for how long, and everything else is done for you.\n\nFor more advanced investors, there's also a form of staking your crypto without the need for a cryptocurrency exchange at all. Instead, you hold funds in your own blockchain wallet and use a third-party staking service. Typically called liquid staking, this process can reduce some of the risks of staking, since you can pull out your crypto at any time. Moreover, the staking rewards can be a bit higher, because there is no intermediary (like a crypto exchange) taking a cut of your rewards.\n\nRegulatory concerns\n\nFinally, there's the pesky little matter of the Securities and Exchange Commission, which has decided that there's something about crypto staking that it does not like. In February, it went after cryptocurrency exchange Kraken for offering staking services to customers. Then, in June, it went after Coinbase. So there's currently a bit of uncertainty about the future of crypto staking.\n\nThe good news, if you want to call it that, is that the SEC is not so much opposed to the concept of staking, as it is to the way staking is pitched to retail investors. If you read the official SEC statement about Kraken, this becomes clear. For example, the SEC said that Kraken did not do a good enough job of explaining potential risks to customers.\n\nCaveat emptor\n\nThat's why I made a big deal about the flawed analogy to a high-yield bank savings account. If you are thinking about crypto staking as just crypto's version of a savings account, then it's easy to see how you might be in for a rude surprise. Unlike with a savings account, you can actually lose money on your staked crypto. So, certainly, before you get involved with crypto staking, make sure you do your due diligence and understand the risks."

        "title": "Bitcoin Passes $30,000 Mark And Ethereum Reaches $1,500, GameStop Memes' Potential For 500x Returns - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "The cryptocurrency market is buzzing with excitement as Bitcoin (BTC) breaks through the $30,000 mark and Ethereum (ETH) surges to new heights, reaching as high as $1,500. With these impressive gains, investors are left wondering how high ETH can go and which ERC20 cryptocurrencies are set to rise alongside it. At the forefront of this list is GameStop Memes (GME), a token that has recently grabbed the attention of crypto enthusiasts and investors alike.\n\nWill Bitcoin ETF Approval Lead The Coin to $100k?\n\nThe impending approval of a US-based Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) has sent ripples through the cryptocurrency community. Bloomberg Intelligence estimates a staggering 90% chance of SEC approval by January 10, 2024. This approval could be a game-changer, potentially propelling Bitcoin\u2019s price to $100,000. The recent interest of financial giants like BlackRock in a Bitcoin ETF has already pushed the price of Bitcoin beyond $35,000, a level not seen in nearly 18 months. This stands in stark contrast to Ethereum\u2019s 50% price increase this year. The recent 27% surge in Bitcoin\u2019s price in October reflects a bullish market sentiment and growing confidence in the potential adoption of Bitcoin ETFs by US institutions.\n\nBecause of these positive perceptions, new ventures like GameStop Memes have the potential to expand in the coming days and provide investors with 500x profits.\n\nEthereum And The Altcoin Rally\n\nEthereum, as the second-largest cryptocurrency, has experienced significant gains in the wake of Bitcoin\u2019s price pump. This has brought relief to investors during what seemed like a prolonged crypto winter. What\u2019s more noteworthy is the effect this has on ERC20 tokens, particularly ones in the presale stage, such as GameStop Memes, which stand to gain prominence during heightened market enthusiasm.\n\nGameStop Memes \u2013 The New Kid On The Block\n\nAmong the ERC20 tokens, GameStop Memes (GME) has captured the spotlight. Inspired by the Wall Street Memes saga, GameStop Memes is poised to carry on the legacy and become the community\u2019s champions. It\u2019s more than just another meme coin; it\u2019s a movement, a testament to the power of unity and resistance against entrenched financial giants.\n\nEvery revolution deserves a sequel, and GameStop Memes is that next chapter. It embodies the spirit of resistance and unity. While meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu cater to the playful side of the internet, GameStop Memes represents the belief that a united community can challenge even the mightiest institutions. It draws inspiration from the GameStop saga, a moment when ordinary individuals, armed with conviction and humour, challenged the giants and emerged victorious.\n\nA Vision Beyond Profit\n\nGameStop Memes is not just about profit, it represents a desire to rewrite the rules and show that unity and defiance can disrupt the established order. It champions the ethos of the GameStop movement, resisting conventional systems, and aims to democratise finance on a global scale. Beyond memes and humour, it seeks to empower its community with resources and knowledge to navigate the financial landscape confidently, promoting financial literacy and independence.\n\nIn a world of cryptocurrencies that constantly evolves, GameStop Memes stands out. It is deeply rooted in a historic financial event and pays homage to the GameStop saga while embodying resilience, unity, and a disruptive spirit. It\u2019s not just a financial decision; it aligns with the core values of the David vs. Goliath narrative.\n\nCommunity-Driven Approach\n\nGameStop Memes follows a community-driven approach where token-related decisions and outreach initiatives are determined by the collective voice of the community. Security and transparency are paramount, with all transactions and movements recorded and verifiable. Innovative tokenomics ensure the ecosystem\u2019s resilience and sustainability, with features like auto-liquidity and token redistribution enhancing stability and rewarding loyal holders.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn the current market scenario, GameStop Memes represent a compelling opportunity for investors seeking substantial returns. Inspired by a historic financial revolution and fueled by the collective strength of its community, GameStop Memes is more than just a meme coin; it\u2019s a movement. As it continues to gain traction and attention, it stands poised to be the next cryptocurrency success story, offering the potential for 500x returns in a market filled with exciting possibilities.\n\nGameStop Memes\n\nWebsite: https://gamestmemes.com/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/GameStopMemes\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/GameStopMemes\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Ethereum Forecasted to Reach $5.8K by 2025; InQubeta's Bullish Forecast Explained - NewsBTC",
        "content": "InQubeta (QUBE) and Ethereum (ETH) are two of the best coins to invest in right now as both projects are projected to enjoy exponential growth in the coming years. Financial firm Finder recently released projections that had ETH prices reaching $5,824 by 2025. The forecast also anticipates prices will reach $14,411 by 2030.\n\nQUBE predictions are even more impressive with some projections expecting prices to grow as much as 100x by 2025 as the new DeFi project opens up access to artificial intelligence (AI) investments with its crowdfunding approach.\n\nEarly InQubeta investors have already earned 130% returns on their capital and they will be up a total of 440% by the time tokens launch on exchanges. Newcomers to its presale can still earn 90% returns on their investment before the event ends.\n\nBest coins to invest in: InQubeta (QUBE) poised to lead altcoins in growth\n\nInQubeta\u2019s blockchain is hosted on the Ethereum network and it enjoys its transparency, security, and functionality. This allows AI companies fundraising on the platform to mint investment opportunities into non-fungible tokens that are sold on its NFT marketplace.\n\nInQubeta\u2019s link to AI and its small token supply at 1.5 billion gives it comparable growth potential to where Bitcoin (BTC) was a decade ago as it helps to advance artificial intelligence by directing capital to companies in the space. Investments in AI have risen exponentially in the past several years and more than $1.5 trillion is anticipated to be poured into the technology by 2030.\n\nAI is on course to shake up the world and it will open new opportunities for investors to earn huge returns on their investments. Governments worldwide are already passing regulations to help limit the disruption the technology causes as it becomes apparent it will be the next major revolution.\n\nMany would say the AI revolution is already moving full steam ahead as some of the most complex AI concepts like autonomous cars and humanoid robots are now a reality. Thanks to InQubeta, investors who don\u2019t have access to mainstream investment avenues can now be part of the AI revolution.\n\nDecentralized finance meets artificial intelligence\n\nSmart contracts, ERC20 coins, and fractionalization come together to create an inventive investment process on the InQubeta network. Stocks don\u2019t exist here, but ERC20 coins (non-fungible tokens) perform the same duties.\n\nThese tokens are made by startups looking for capital and sold on the NFT marketplace to those looking to invest in AI. Some tokens give other rewards like exclusive access to items developed.\n\nInvestment opportunities can be purchased with QUBE on the NFT marketplace and any tokens bought can be resold whenever.\n\nInvesting in InQubeta\n\nQUBE is currently priced at $0.0161 but could reach a dollar by 2025 if its market share reaches $1.5 billion. That\u2019s not some unsurmountable milestone in the cryptocurrency space given the fact that meme coins with no real value or purpose like Dogecoin (DOGE) have raised over $9 billion despite the many issues plaguing their networks.\n\nEthereum (ETH) fails to keep up with Bitcoin\n\nEthereum price charts have historically mimicked BTC charts, but the second most popular crypto hasn\u2019t been able to keep up with its older sibling during its current bull run. Still, ETH prices have risen 34% in the past 30 days and Finder\u2019s projections have prices reaching $5,800 by 2024.\n\nWhile its anticipated growth won\u2019t keep up with QUBE, it will allow investors to almost triple their investment in a few years.\n\nSummary\n\nInQubeta and Ethereum are two of the best coins to invest in right now thanks to their impressive projections. QUBE is expected to see more growth than ETH, thanks to how undervalued tokens currently are, the project\u2019s creative way of advancing AI, and the $1.5 trillion projected to be guided into the space by 2030.\n\nVisit InQubeta Presale\n\nJoin The InQubeta Communities\n\nDisclaimer: This is a paid release.

        "content": "The cryptocurrency market gained momentum on Sunday evening after the news broke that Argentina today elected libertarian candidate Javier Milei, who is a staunch Bitcoin supporter as its new president.\n\nCryptocurrency Gains +/- Price (Recorded 9:30 p.m. EST) Bitcoin BTC/USD +2.31% $37,377 Ethereum ETH/USD +2.78% $2,005 Dogecoin DOGE/USD +2.33% $0.080\n\nWhat Happened: Milei has secured 56% of the tally, while Sergio Massa, his opponent trails behind with 44%, according to Bloomberg. Following Massa\u2019s concession, Bitcoin has experienced a significant increase of nearly 3% in the past 24 hours, reaching $37,350.\n\nMilei has been openly critical of the country\u2019s central bank, going as far as labeling it a scam and a \u201cmechanism used by politicians to deceive the public through inflationary tax.\u201d He believes that Bitcoin represents a pivotal shift towards returning control of money to its rightful creator, the private sector.\n\nTop Gainer (24 Hour)\n\nCryptocurrency Gains +/- Price (Recorded 9:30 p.m. EDT) Render +19.08% $3.41 Kaspa +15.37% $0.13 FTX Token +14.09% $3.41\n\nThe global crypto market cap currently stands at $1.39 trillion, reflecting a decrease of 1.49% in the past 24 hours.\n\nThe U.S. equity futures show a minimal change on Sunday evening as the market anticipates the shortened Thanksgiving holiday week.

        "content": "In the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies, staying informed about the best cryptos to buy now is crucial for investors.

InQubeta (QUBE), a relatively new player in the crypto space, has made a splash with over $4.9 million raised in its presale, drawing the interest of big investors or \u2018whales\u2019.\n\nThe buzz around InQubeta and Ethereum\u2019s consistent upward trajectory underscores the ever-changing landscape of cryptocurrency investments.
