        "title": "ETH Goes up in Flames: Dive into Fiery Depths of Ethereum's 'Fire Sale' - U.Today",
        "content": "Disclaimer: The opinions expressed by our writers are their own and do not represent the views of U.Today. The financial and market information provided on U.Today is intended for informational purposes only. U.Today is not liable for any financial losses incurred while trading cryptocurrencies.

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nCryptocurrency markets often undergo significant price fluctuations, leading to unique buying opportunities known as \"fire sales.\" The term refers to situations when an asset is perceived to be oversold, prompting interested investors to buy in at relatively low prices. For Ethereum (ETH), one of the leading indicators that tracks these opportunities is the rainbow chart, and it is currently signaling a \"fire sale.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo understand what this means, let's first examine the rainbow chart concept, typically used in Bitcoin (BTC) analysis. The Bitcoin rainbow chart is a logarithmic price chart that applies color-coded bands to represent the predicted price growth of BTC over time. Each color corresponds to different levels of price action, from the red \"maximum bubble territory\" to the dark blue \"basically a fire sale.\"\n\nThese charts are based on the assumption that Bitcoin's price will follow a predictable exponential growth pattern over the long term, with periodic boom-and-bust cycles.\n\nTranslating this to Ethereum, the rainbow chart concept suggests that Ethereum is currently in \"fire sale\" territory, indicating that ETH could be significantly undervalued at its current price levels.\n\nHowever, it is crucial to remember that these charts require different calculations when applied to Ethereum. Unlike Bitcoin, which has a capped supply and predictable inflation, Ethereum's monetary policy is more complex, particularly with its transition from proof of work (PoW) to proof of stake (PoS).\n\nThis shift alters Ethereum's inflation rate and introduces a new deflationary mechanism through the burning of transaction fees, fundamentally changing the dynamics that the rainbow chart seeks to model.\n\nWhile Ethereum's rainbow chart may currently indicate a \"fire sale,\" these metrics should not be used in isolation. Investors should account for Ethereum's unique monetary policy changes, market conditions and other technical indicators when making investment decisions."

This loophole allowed the hacker to drain funds worth roughly $455,000 from Ethereum (darcWETH) and Optimism (darcUSDC) vaults.\n\nArcadia Finance code required no validation of untrusted input. Source: PeckShield\n\nArcadia Finance has not yet responded to Cointelegraph\u2019s request for comment about the hack. However, the team told Cointelegraph that the root cause pointed out by PeckShield is wrong.\n\nArcadia Finance confirmed the hack two hours after PeckShield\u2019s intimation and subsequently paused the contracts to prevent further bleeding of funds.\n\nWe are aware of a potential exploit in our protocol.\n\nWe have paused the contracts and are investigating the root-cause with security experts as we speak. More info will follow as it comes available. \u2014 Arcadia Finance (@ArcadiaFi) July 10, 2023\n\nWhile the investigations are underway, Arcadia\u2019s code houses another vulnerability, which could prove catastrophic for the protocol if exploited. According to PeckShield:\n\n\u201cIn addition, there is a lack of reentrancy protection, which allows for the instant liquidation to bypass the internal vault health check.\u201d\n\nMost of the stolen funds were from Optimism \u2014 approximately 180 Ether (ETH) \u2014 and have been washed via Tornado Cash. However, the stolen tokens on Ethereum \u2014 worth over $103,000 at the time of writing \u2014 remain parked at the suspected wallet address.\n\nRelated: Multichain MPC bridge sees $100M+ outflows, sparking fears of exploit\n\nIn the second quarter of 2023, hacks and exploits in the crypto space resulted in a cumulative loss of over $300 million.\n\nA report by blockchain security company CertiK showed that a total of 212 security incidents were recorded in the quarter, resulting in a loss of $313,566,528 from Web3 protocols.\n\nCompared with the previous year\u2019s Q2 data, CertiK found that the crypto hacks declined by 58%.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nJust shy of $45 billion or 20% of Ethereum in circulation has been staked\u2014a milestone reached on Monday that captures coins at work like never before.\n\nPeople pledge tokens to the network to keep it secure and receive rewards for doing so. And close to 24 million Ethereum is currently locked up across 744,000 validators that process transactions, according to a dashboard on Dune Analytics created by a user named hildobby.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEthereum is one of many blockchains that utilizes a proof-of-stake consensus model, which, in the case of Ethereum, involves validators pledging at least 32 Ethereum for the chance to validate transactions and receive associated fees.\n\nBut that hasn\u2019t always been the case. In September of last year, after much anticipation, Ethereum transitioned from proof-of-work\u2014an energy-intensive process used by networks like Bitcoin\u2014to proof-of-stake. And for months, staked Ethereum couldn\u2019t be withdrawn until an upgrade this past April enabled it.\n\nFor reference, around $29 billion worth of Ethereum, or 14.5% of ETH in circulation, was pledged leading up to the pivotal Shanghai upgrade that enabled staking withdrawals.\n\nMonday\u2019s milestone represents a noteworthy achievement and captures the success of Ethereum\u2019s journey toward a consensus model that\u2019s ultimately friendlier on the environment, prominent venture capitalist and crypto analyst Adam Cochran told Decrypt.\n\n\u201cThis is a huge point of progress for the network, aligning economic incentives with security goals works and is critical for a decentralized network,\u201d he said. \u201cWe should all be proud of this milestone.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhen it comes to how people stake their Ethereum, Lido Finance, the crypto market\u2019s largest liquid staking protocol, is by far the most popular choice. Allowing users to stake ETH in any amount and receive a staked Ethereum token called \u201cstETH\u201d in exchange, it accounts for nearly 32% of all staked Ethereum, according to Dune.\n\nCryptocurrency exchanges are also big players. Coinbase, Kraken, Binance, and OKX account for around 19% of all staked Ethereum, according to Dune. In a bear market, where trading volumes are depressed, staking has helped exchanges find an alternative source of revenue.\n\nYet regulators in the U.S. have their qualms with how staking services are offered to customers, alleging they run afoul of securities laws. Both Kraken and Coinbase have faced regulatory heat for staking products this year\u2014Kraken settled a lawsuit in February and Coinbase\u2019s is ongoing.\n\nFinancial institutions are paying attention to staking and exploring how it can bolster the products they offer, in Canada, at least. Two weeks ago, the digital asset manager 3iQ said two of its exchange-traded funds (ETFs) will offer staking to clients in August."
