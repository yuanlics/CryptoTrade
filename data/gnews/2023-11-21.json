        "content": "Average daily transaction fees on Bitcoin (BTC) have flipped with Ethereum following a frenzy of Ordinals-related activity on the Bitcoin network.\n\nOn Nov. 20, the average daily transaction fee for Bitcoin stood at $10.34, while Ethereum transaction fees came to an average of $8.43, according to BitInfoChart data.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s average daily trading fee notched a new six-month high on Nov.16, reaching a peak of $18.67, while Ethereum fees reached $7.90.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s average daily fees have surged above Ethereum in the last five days. Source: BitInfoCharts\n\nThe sudden uptick in Bitcoin transaction fees stems from a renewed market appetite for assets inscribed with the Ordinals Protocol \u2014 a tool for creating nonfungible token (NFT)-like assets and BRC-20 tokens on Bitcoin.\n\nFollowing a significant lull in activity between Sept. 25 and Oct. 23, Ordinals-based assets saw a drastic uptick beginning in late October, according to Dune Analytics data.\n\nThe number of Ordinals inscriptions grew by over six million since late October. Source: Dune Analytics\n\nRelated: Bitcoin Ordinals team launches nonprofit to grow protocol development\n\nSince Oct. 24, over six million Ordinal assets have been created, resulting in more than 800 BTC in fees \u2014 worth roughly $30 million \u2014 being redistributed to the network.\n\nThe uptick in Ordinals inscription activity compounded as ORDI \u2014 the second largest BRC-20 token by market cap \u2014 was listed on Binance on Nov. 7. The listing spurred a wider wave of BRC-20 buying activity from traders with the price of the ORDI token jumping by just over 50% on the day.\n\nAdditionally, on Nov. 17, the Ordinals-based project Taproot Wizards announced a $7.5 million seed round.\n\nMagazine: I spent a week working in VR.

        "content": "Ethereum Layer 2 Kinto has migrated to the Arbitrum ecosystem via the Arbitrum Nitro technology stack after previously launching its testnet using Optimism\u2019s OP Stack in May.\n\nThe migration follows a change in the structure of the Arbitrum Orbit ecosystem of chains that granted the Arbitrum Foundation greater autonomy in negotiating Layer 2 deployments, according to a statement.\n\nKinto claims it can bridge the gap between traditional finance and decentralized finance by building a KYC-compliant Layer 2 to support both modern financial institutions and decentralized protocols. It also aims to reduce the risk of DeFi exploits, providing built-in insurance for all smart contracts.\n\nWhy Arbitrum?\n\nThe decision to migrate to Arbitrum was driven by a need to provide similar levels of security, reliability and regulatory compliance typical in traditional financial systems while reducing the costs and friction associated with traditional asset issuance.\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\n\u201cArbitrum\u2019s ability to provide a credibly neutral, efficient and mature platform, with a strong understanding of decentralized finance, made it a perfect fit for the foundation of Kinto,\u201d the team said.\n\n\u201cArbitrum is the indisputable leader in the rollup space regarding adoption, TVL and technology maturity,\u201d Kinto founder Ramon Recuero added. \u201cArbitrum is a community driven ecosystem with thousands of projects being built by crypto-natives and we are excited to add Kinto into that discussion. We seek to extend a bridge for TradFi into DeFi without alienating the principles and ethos of crypto and Arbitrum is the best place to do so.\u201d\n\nEarlier this month, Kinto announced it had raised $5 million over two funding rounds from investors, including Kyber Capital Crypto, Spartan Group and Parafi. Kinto\u2019s mainnet launch is scheduled for Q1, 2024."
