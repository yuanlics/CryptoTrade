        "title": "Ethereum Price Relatively Muted But Approaches Crucial Breakout - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Ethereum price is consolidating gains below the $2,350 resistance zone. ETH could revisit the $2,200 support before it starts a fresh increase.\n\nEthereum is still holding gains above the $2,250 support zone.\n\nThe price is trading below $2,280 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance near $2,290 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair could extend its decline and revisit the $2,200 support zone.\n\nEthereum Price Remains In A Range\n\nEthereum price started a downside correction from the $2,350 level. ETH declined below the $2,320 and $2,300 levels. It even spiked below the $2,250 level.\n\nA low was formed near $2,247 and the price is now attempting a fresh increase, like Bitcoin. There was a move above the $2,265 level. The price climbed above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2,327 swing high to the $2,247 low.\n\nEthereum is now trading below $2,280 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $2,290 level. There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance near $2,290 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.\n\nThe trend line is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2,327 swing high to the $2,247 low. A close above the $2,290 resistance could send the price toward $2,320.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nThe main resistance sits at $2,350. A clear move above the $2,350 zone could start a major increase. The next resistance sits at $2,420, above which Ethereum might rally and test the $2,550 zone.\n\nMore Losses in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $2,290 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,250 level.\n\nThe first key support could be the $2,220 zone. A downside break and a close below $2,220 might spark more bearish moves. In the stated case, Ether could revisit the $2,120 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,040 level.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bullish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $2,220\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $2,290\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "Anatoly Yakovenko jokes 'Solana is Ethereum' in ironic social media exchange - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "In a recent exchange on social media, Solana creator Anatoly Yakovenko, made a remark that was misinterpreted in our previous coverage.\n\nIn a Dec. 25 tweet, Yakovenko playfully suggested that Solana could be considered an Ethereum layer-2 (L2) solution through its Wormhole eigenlayer. This statement was part of a tongue-in-cheek response to a tweet listing various L2 solutions like Arbitrum, Aztec, and Polygon. He quipped:\n\n\u201cSolana is ethereum! Solana is an ethereum L2 through the wormhole eigenlayer. Once danksharding is scaled up no one is going to stop you from submitting all the Solana blocks into some data validating bridge contract on ethereum.\u201d\n\nThis playful assertion was meant to ironically juxtapose Solana, a distinct and independent blockchain, with Ethereum\u2019s layer-2 solutions. The mention of a Wormhole eigenlayer and the speculative reference to submitting Solana blocks to Ethereum were part of this jest.\n\nOur initial report, however, presented it seriously and failed to recognize its ironic nature, and thus our coverage suggested that he meant it in earnest. We sincerely apologize for the error and for any confusion caused by our failure to recognize the ironic intent behind it.\n\nOn the rise\n\nYakovenko\u2019s jesting aside, Solana is poised to close the year on a high note. December was a particularly active month for the blockchain, showcasing one of the quickest price recoveries in the final quarter. The total value locked (TVL) on Solana more than doubled, escalating from $671.62 million at the beginning of the month to $1.529 billion by December 26th.\n\nHowever, when denominated in SOL, the increase was more modest, from 11.35 million SOL to 12.56 million SOL in the same period. This discrepancy reflects the significant rise in SOL price, which climbed from $59.2 to $121.4, affecting the USD valuation of the TVL.\n\nNotably, Solana overtook XRP in market cap, becoming the fifth-largest cryptocurrency with a market cap of $34.8 billion as of December 20, 2023, following an 11% increase in Solana\u2019s value, which outpaced the broader market\u2019s 3% gain. The SOL/ETH ratio, comparing Solana\u2019s value to Ethereum\u2019s, also shows recovery, highlighting Solana\u2019s competitive stance.\n\nThe SOL/ETH ratio, a metric comparing the value of Solana (SOL) to Ethereum (ETH), is a critical measure of Solana\u2019s competitive position. This ratio has experienced significant fluctuations, with the most recent data showing a recovery in Solana\u2019s standing against Ethereum.\n\nSolana\u2019s blockchain technology, known for its high performance and scalability, is designed to support decentralized applications (dApps) and decentralized finance (DeFi) use cases. The platform\u2019s success is attributed to its unique consensus algorithm, \u201cProof of History,\u201d which enables high transaction speeds and low fees, making it a popular choice among developers for dApps and DeFi projects."
