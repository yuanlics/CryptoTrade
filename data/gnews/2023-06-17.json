        "title": "This Ethereum Upgrade Might Change NFTs Segment for Good, Here's How - U.Today",
        "content": "Advertisement\n\nAn eccentric Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) introduced one month ago can totally change the technical design and economics of the segment of non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Besides paving the way for new generations of NFTs, it can advance the tooling of existing Apes and Mutants.\n\nERC-6551 blurs lines between NFTs, smart contracts and wallets\n\nPresented only five weeks ago, ERC-6551 opens up a plethora of previously unseen opportunities for the NFT and digital identity space. Such conclusion was made by The Spartan Group's VC arm Spartan Labs.\n\nERC-4337 was one of the biggest developments for the wallet space earlier this year.\n\n\n\nBut ERC-6551 is building on that to revolutionise the NFT space. ERC-6551 will change the way we view NFTs and digital identities.\n\n\n\nHere's how, and why you should care \ud83e\uddf5 pic.twitter.com/dHwmXKDmic \u2014 Spartan Labs (@TheSpartanLabs) June 16, 2023\n\nThis EIP, co-authored by the founders of CryptoKitties, the first-ever commercially successful NFT collection, allows non-fungible tokens to control ERC-4337-enabled cryptocurrency wallets. For instance, NFTs can make transactions, store assets and, therefore, interact with DeFi protocols just like regular non-custodial wallets.\n\nThe scope of possibilities of ERC-6551-powered NFTs looks really endless. The owner of such NFTs can collect POAPs and display them in a transparent and tamper-proof form.\n\nIn decentralized games, such NFTs can be associated with in-game wallets. This, in turn, will make the gaming experience more immersive for various generations of players.\n\nAs of today, the ERC-6551: Non-fungible Token Bound Accounts proposal is labeled with a \"Draft\" status on Ethereum Foundation's portal for EIPs.\n\nWeb3 media, decentralized messaging, reputation management: Plenty of new NFT use cases\n\nSpartan Labs' researchers indicated a number of other interesting use cases for NFT-powered wallets. They might finally make Web3 publishing platforms mainstream thanks to more democratic content monetization models.\n\nThen, decentralized messengers' interfaces might be upgraded with such NFTs. Traders can even share the addresses of their NFTs to demonstrate their PnL and trade history \u2014 and this data cannot be altered, being visible to everyone via explorers.\n\nThis ERC is backward compatible, which means all existing NFTs can be equipped with the full range of ERC-6551 functionalities. This can radically change the narrative in the global NFT ecosystem."

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nUniswap\u2019s new upgrade has sparked a new controversy regarding its \u201copen source\u201d description, with developers saying \u201cit is not as advertised.\u201d\n\nThe company released its fourth version on a Business Source License, giving room for critics due to its four-year open-source period.\n\nUniswap has responded to critics explaining that four years is not a long time to balance incentivizing innovation and giving out exclusive rights.\n\nThis week, Uniswap\u2019s developers noted that the new version of the decentralized exchange (DEX) will offer users limitless possibilities; while that may be true, some promises were not.\n\nPrior to the launch of Uniswap\u2019s V4, the management team made several promises from the increased utility of the exchange to its open-source nature which attracted the attention of developers. The promise of it being open-source has been called a \u201cmisrepresentation\u201d by a cross-section of Ethereum\u2019s community.\n\nThe V4 was released as a Business Source License (BSL), which means that its code is open to the public and can be copied, reproduced, and redistributed, but there\u2019s a caveat. All these can only be done after four years when it converts to a General Purpose License (GPL).\n\nLefteris Karapetsas, an Ethereum developer and founder of Rotki, expressed his displeasure stating that \u201cUniswap decided to go with a Business Source License (BSL), continuing what they did with v3. The reason is they don\u2019t understand open source, and they believe their moat is their code which is wrong.\u201d He was the first to call out Uniswap on Twitter and urged them to use the proper terminology as this \u201cis insulting to actual open-source software.\u201d\n\nAnother dev, Scott Lewis, pointed out that Unisawap\u2019s V4 is a four-year proprietary license adding that \u201cIf anyone else misrepresented the truth like this, they would be torn to shreds. That\u2019s the power of being powerful.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUniswap defend their \u201cfalse\u201d claims\n\nHayden Adams the founder of Uniswap alongside his development team addressed the controversy on YouTube. The group noted that the four-year period is not as long time as it appears, and it strikes a healthy balance between \u201cincentivizing innovation and giving exclusive rights to the protocol, which has precedents in \u2018normal\u2019 settings as well.\u201d\n\nGabriel Shapiro describes it as a tax on innovation, explaining further that it would be difficult for young devs to navigate while building from scratch.\n\n\u201cAnyone who\u2019s looked at BSL code even once, and then later codes something similar, is at a risk of catching a copyright claim,\u201d he added.\n\nDespite the criticisms meted out against Uniswap, many have hailed the V4 for rolling out a new smart contract termed \u201chooks\u201d which lets developers expand liquidity pools increasing customizability."
