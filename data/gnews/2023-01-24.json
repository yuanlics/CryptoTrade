Factors driving the latest shift include:\n\n* NFT trading volumes picking up steam, leading to higher gas fees and subsequent base fee burn for traders.\n* Lingering effects of the Merge, which transitioned the network from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake and impacted Ethereum's supply.\n* The upcoming Shanghai upgrade, which will allow stakers to withdraw their locked-up ether for the first time.\n* Ramped-up volatility in ether trading, which affects the token's overall supply.\n\nEther is currently trading around $1,600, up from the start of the year when it was trading in the $1,200 range. The cryptoasset has typically been inflationary, but it took a deflationary turn in November 2022 for the first time since the Merge.\n\nAccording to Blockworks Research, Ethereum has about 18 times more TVL (total"

The 3-month futures annualized premium has entered a neutral area, indicating that derivatives traders are no longer bearish. Additionally, options traders are comfortable with downside risk, as the 25% delta skew has stabilized near 0%. This suggests that pro traders are moving from neutral-to-bearish sentiment to a neutral positioning, which favors Ether bulls. However, the article notes that the demand for shorts using futures contracts remains thin and that investors should conduct their own research before making any investment decisions."

The ETH/BTC pair has been declining since the second half of January, with Ether lagging behind Bitcoin in terms of USD gains. The EMA ribbon indicator shows numerous exponential moving averages of increasing timeframe on the same price chart, and breaking below the ribbon range increases the likelihood of an extended down-move. A multi-month descending trendline resistance is also a concern for ETH/BTC, as sellers have been more active recently. If ETH/BTC breaks below the EMA ribbon range, it may test the 200-week EMA near 0.0550 BTC, which could result in a 20% price drop from current levels."

He suggests that Ethereum may not retract soon, indicating an increase in risk appetite. However, the market's dependence on traditional markets means Solana and Ethereum should not be considered market-moving assets. In recent weeks, the cryptocurrency market has experienced a significant rally, leading to numerous breakthroughs and resistance levels."
