        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s native token, ether, has turned deflationary. Again.\n\nWhat\u2019s driving the latest shift is a combination of factors, according to Blockworks Research analysts, previous reporting and crypto data providers. Among them:\n\nNFT trading volumes picking up steam since the start of 2023 after a period of depressed activity. The result has been rising gas fees, which power transactions on the Ethereum network. That increase, in turn, has triggered \u201csubsequent base fee burn\u201d for traders, Blockworks Research analysts said. (Base fees set a floor for gas and are burnt, or removed from circulation, to control the availability of ether on the market.)\n\nLingering effects from the Merge, which transitioned the network from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake. A Blockworks Research report said the move was \u201cundeniable\u201d in terms of \u201cthe impact [proof-of-stake] has had on Ethereum\u2019s supply.\u201d\n\nEthereum\u2019s pending Shanghai upgrade, which is set to allow stakers that validate the blockchain\u2019s transactions to withdraw their locked-up ether for the first time.\n\nRamped-up volatility in terms of trading ether, which has an impact on the native token\u2019s overall supply. And bullish headwinds to start the year for bitcoin, ether and additional cryptoassets.\n\nEther (ETH) was trading around $1,600 as of Tuesday afternoon in New York, holding relatively flat on the day. That\u2019s significantly up from the start of the year, when ether was trading in the $1,200 range.\n\nThe cryptoasset \u2014 which has typically been inflationary \u2014 took a deflationary turn in November 2022 for the first time since the Merge. It previously had become deflationary in November 2021 and has flip-flopped at least three times this month.\n\n\u201cI strongly believe total ETH burn in the next cycle will be at least as great as the previous cycle,\u201d said Dan Smith, a senior analyst with Blockworks Research.\n\nEthereum has about 18 times more TVL (total value locked) than most layer-2 blockchains, according to Smith, which are \u201cbarely even [layer-2s] in their current state.\u201d Ether now has a peak burn rate of -2.8% compared to its last bull run, he said, based on an analysis of on-chain data from Oct. 26, 2022 to Jan. 24, 2023.\n\nREAD MORE: The effect of Ethereum\u2019s \u201csecurity budget\u201d on its inflation status\n\nNFT marketplaces OpenSea and Blur have burned more than 6,500 ETH over the past month, contributing significantly to the inflation versus deflation narrative, per Blockworks Research.\n\nAdded Smith: \u201cWhile layer-2s showed continued innovation and adoption in 2022, they lack decentralization in their current state.\u201d\n\nDecentralizing elements such as sequencers or provers will come later in 2023 or 2024, developers say.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "Could Ethereum Hit $5,000 in 2023? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Once upon a time, what historians call November 2021, Ethereum (ETH 0.28%) was worth more than $4,890 per digital coin. Then a bitter crypto winter set in, driving Ethereum prices all the way down to $896 last summer.\n\nToday, the roller-coaster ride stands at the $1,633 station. Can the largest and oldest blockchain platform for smart contracts reach new all-time highs of $5,000 or more in 2023?\n\nThe short answer is, \"maybe.\" The most honest answer I can give you is, \"probably not; ask again next year.\"\n\nTo see the long answer, and my recommendations for Ethereum investors, keep reading.\n\nThe final destination\n\nI expect cryptocurrencies and smart contracts to disrupt economic systems around the world. The next generation of banking, money transfers, insurance, and asset management will look radically different. Go-betweens are dropping out of the equation, transactions will be faster and more automated, fees are going lower, and I'm just scratching the surface of what a decentralized financial system will look like.\n\nEthereum is one of the oldest and most respected cryptocurrencies on the market, with a larger group of app developers and projects than its younger rivals. It is also under active development, as seen in last summer's Merge and an ambitious long-term road map. So as the crypto market evolves, Ethereum should stay in the vanguard.\n\nGiven this potentially spectacular future, Ethereum should gain a lot of value over time. And $5,000 should be an early stop on a long ride up. Growth investing superstar Cathie Wood of Ark Invest fame expected Ethereum to reach \"triple-digit\" prices before 2030. That prediction may sound outdated since she published it nearly one year ago, but Wood has also doubled down on her long-term faith in Ethereum more recently.\n\nSpeed bumps in the road ahead\n\nHowever, those promising targets are pointing a few years into the future. Ethereum looks like a robust long-term investment, but I can't guarantee that it will make you a fortune in 2023.\n\nDecentralized finance is in its infancy, with as many stumbles as success stories. The Ethereum 2.0 development is incomplete after The Merge, leaving many crucial technology improvements for future platform upgrades. In addition, investors and consumers need time to rebuild their general trust in cryptocurrencies after multiple cash-burning scandals in 2022. And we are still waiting for sectorwide catalysts such as a firm regulatory system for crypto trading and ownership or large-scale involvement by banks and institutional investors.\n\nThe $5,000 price target is more than triple Ethereum's current price. Meeting it this year is a tall order, requiring many uncertain events to work out in Ethereum's favor -- and quickly.\n\nSo Ethereum may very well double in price this year, and maybe even triple. Crypto winters melting into a new spring can have that effect. At the same time, the gains can also take years to develop and Ethereum's price might dip again along the way.\n\nHow to invest in Ethereum this year\n\nIn other words, it's not a good idea to bet the literal farm on Ethereum right now. Building your holdings more patiently makes far more sense, allowing you to take advantage of the current price dip, as well as the potential potholes of the future.\n\nInvesting in Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies is really not different from buying stocks. Get-rich-quick schemes rarely work out in your favor, while patiently building your portfolio for the long haul is the real secret to lasting wealth.\n\nTherefore, I recommend picking up some Ethereum coins (or fractions of coins) in several buys across 2023. If it reaches that tantalizing $5,000 level, you'll celebrate getting in early enough to triple some of your first investments. And if the price chart dips again, your celebration will be just as heartfelt when Ethereum zooms past $5,000 to Cathie Wood's triple-digit targets in a few years.\n\nIt's just a matter of time and patience. Life in Wall Street's fast lane can be slow sometimes."

        "content": "The price of Ether (ETH) rallied 16% between Jan. 14 and Jan. 21, peaking at $1,680 before facing a 5.4% rejection. Curiously, the same resistance level resulted in a substantial correction in late August and again in early on Nov. 2.\n\nEther/USD price index, 2-day. Source: TradingView\n\nFrom one side, traders are relieved that Ether is trading up 35.5% year-to-date, but the repeated corrections that follow retests of the $1,680 resistance may have weakened investors' sentiment.\n\nNegative newsflow might have limited Ether investors\u2019 appetite after troubled cryptocurrency company Digital Currency Group (DCG) faced more legal issues this week. On Jan. 23, a group of Genesis Capital creditors filed a lawsuit alleging violations of federal securities laws. In addition, the plaintiffs allege the lending firm made false and misleading statements as part of a scheme to defraud potential and existing digital asset lenders.\n\nAnother new concern for Ether holders came on Jan. 22, after a \u201ctemperature check\u201d proposal to deploy Uniswap v3 protocol to BNB Chain received overwhelming support from the Uniswap community. Some 80% of Uniswap\u2019s UNI governance tokenholders have voted to deploy the additional version of the decentralized exchange protocol.\n\nOn the bright side, Ethereum developers have created a testing environment for the upcoming Shanghai network upgrade. According to Ethereum developer Marius Van Der Wijden, the testnet appears to have been created to evaluate staking withdrawals, which are currently disabled on the mainnet. Over 14.5 million ETH (worth $23 billion) has been deposited into the Ethereum staking contract, and harsh criticism followed the multiple delays in enabling withdrawals.\n\nLet\u2019s look at Ether derivatives data to understand if the $1,680 price rejection has impacted crypto investor sentiment.\n\nETH futures finally enter the neutral area\n\nRetail traders usually avoid quarterly futures due to their price difference from spot markets. Meanwhile, professional traders prefer these instruments because they prevent the fluctuation of funding rates in a perpetual futures contract.\n\nThe three-month futures annualized premium should trade between 4% to 8% in healthy markets to cover costs and associated risks. When the futures trade at a discount versus regular spot markets, it shows a lack of confidence from leverage buyers and this is a bearish indicator.\n\nEther 3-month futures annualized premium. Source: Laevitas\n\nThe above chart shows that derivatives traders are no longer bearish because the Ether futures premium reached the 4% threshold for neutral markets. So, bulls can celebrate that the indicator shifted to a modest premium, but that does not mean traders expect the immediate result of positive price action.\n\nFor this reason, traders should analyze Ether\u2019s options markets to understand how whales and market makers are pricing the odds of future price movements.\n\nOptions traders are comfortable with downside risk\n\nThe 25% delta skew is a telling sign when market makers and arbitrage desks are overcharging for upside or downside protection.\n\nIn bear markets, options investors give higher odds for a price dump, causing the skew indicator to rise above 10%. On the other hand, bullish markets tend to drive the skew indicator below -10%, meaning the bearish put options are discounted.\n\nEther 60-day options 25% delta skew: Source: Laevitas\n\nRelated: Why is crypto pumping? Watch The Market Report live\n\nThe delta skew has stabilized near 0% in the past week, signaling that Ether options traders are presenting a neutral sentiment. That is a stark contrast from the end of 2022 when the 25% skew index hovered near 18% \u2014 indicating a lack of comfort in taking downside risks.\n\nUltimately, both options and futures markets point to pro traders moving out of the neutral-to-bearish sentiment to a neutral positioning, meaning there is no discomfort after the rejection at $1,680 and subsequent correction.\n\nConsequently, the odds favor Ether bulls because the negative newsflow could not prevent the 35.5% year-to-date gains and the demand for shorts using futures contracts remains thin.\n\nThe views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors\u2019 alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "Although he\u2019s had a variety of jobs in the industry, including a stint as Arcane Asset\u2019s chief investment officer, Eric Wall is probably best known for shitposting and arguing with people on Crypto Twitter.\n\n\n\n\u201cJust like any other person, I\u2019m scrolling my Twitter feed, and then you see people saying dumb shit that is incorrect, and that is based on a lie. And then I just argue with that person, and then those arguments lead to long-form Medium articles,\u201d he says with just a faint trace of a Swedish accent.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just trying to correct \u2018incorrectness\u2019 in the space.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s been working on a super-secret project ever since he left Arcane early last year, so he doesn\u2019t have an official title apart from \u201cblockchain researcher\u201d and board member for Ethereum scaling solution the StarkNet Foundation.\n\nAfter arguing with people for years for free, more recently, Wall has been attempting to make money from challenging antagonists to a bet and has also (semi-literally) begun collecting the skulls of his enemies. \u201cThat has been paying off in tungsten cubes and actual money,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s multiple cryptocurrency communities who have me as their favorite hate object basically. They want to put you in your place. And they have all sorts of idiotic ideas.\u201d\n\nEric is the \u201cprime antagonist\u201d for Richard Heart and Hex. Source: Twitter\n\nWall recently moved to Portugal from Sweden, attracted by the crypto-friendly regulation and the lifestyle \u2014 and for safety reasons, after the next most prominent crypto personality in Sweden was physically attacked in an attempt to steal his crypto. He explains the tax system there is so transparent that anyone can look up your net wealth. \u201cIf you combine that with the fact you know they\u2019re into crypto, and it\u2019s very easy to pick out targets in Sweden,\u201d he says.\n\nWall says he paid for the rent on his new flat through the hatred of HEXicans. He\u2019s been at loggerheads with the HEX community since 2019 when founder Richard Heart explained the scheme to him. In February last year, he made a bet with HEXican Dixon Piper that HEX \u2014 then trading at $0.18 \u2014 wouldn\u2019t reach a new all-time high by February 2023.\n\nWhile he hasn\u2019t won yet (but almost certainly will, given HEX\u2019s current price), after HEX plunged to $0.04, he was able to hedge the bet and lock in a profit of $16,000 to pay for his apartment in Lisbon.\n\n\u201cI have this place now with just the most amazing view that I\u2019ve ever seen in my life. I see the entire Portuguese coast from that window, from that balcony. I can have these HEXicans telling me how stupid I am while looking at that view.\u201d\n\nUpdate: I rented my dream apartment in Portugal with it. https://t.co/HGGJZir4VM pic.twitter.com/5HbvANfl7J \u2014 Eric Wall (@ercwl) July 16, 2022\n\nSimilarly, he bet Blockstream CEO Adam Back that PlanB\u2019s \u201cfloor model\u201d was going to be wrong \u2014 which it was. \u201cSo, Adam had to pay up a tungsten cube with his face engraved into the cube,\u201d he says. He won another bet against Bitcoin Magazine\u2019s CK Snarks that the Ethereum Merge really would happen in 2022.\n\nHis plan is to build up a collection of 20 tungsten cubes with the faces of his vanquished foes so that people think twice about arguing. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be pretty intimidated,\u201d he says. \u201cDo you want to be the next face in this collection?\u201d\n\n2021 I won a tungsten cube from Adam Back over S2F/PlanB.\n\n\n\n2022 I won a tungsten cube from Christian Keroles (Managing Director at Bitcoin Magazine) over the Merge.\n\n\n\n2023 I plan to win against @bitcoinerrrrr over ETH withdrawals. pic.twitter.com/T2sIy2qolp \u2014 Eric Wall (@ercwl) January 9, 2023\n\nBitcoin maxi to mini\n\nWall is a recovering Bitcoin maximalist who was once known as the \u201caltcoin slayer\u201d for his brutal takedowns of altcoins during the era of ICOs. One of the most qualified critics in the space \u2014 he literally wrote his Master\u2019s thesis about blockchain \u2014 he can zero in on technological issues and communicate those problems effectively to less technical members of the crypto community.\n\nBack when he was pointing out that most ICO altcoins were centralized shitcoins with myriad security issues, he was a hero to Bitcoiners. But ever since he started busting myths about Ethereum and suggesting that Bitcoin was being left behind by smart contracts, scaling and NFTs, they\u2019ve liked him much less.\n\n(in case he deletes it)\n\ni'm enjoying this eric wall arc pic.twitter.com/Qd7lGrHW5j \u2014 Tony Link \u262f (\ud83d\udc99,\ud83e\udde1) (@chainlank) August 2, 2022\n\nAs you have no doubt gathered, Wall goes to great lengths to prove he is correct and once spent a month downloading an Ethereum node purely to bust the Bitcoiner myth that it took 8 terabytes of data to fully validate transactions.\n\n\u201cIt was extremely difficult, but it was possible, and it didn\u2019t take 8 terabytes of space on the hard drive.\u201d\n\nOne of the big reasons for the shift from maxi to mini (he\u2019s still a proponent of Bitcoin) is that Wall has been fascinated for years with building decentralized finance on an open and permissionless settlement layer. That was the essential subject of his thesis, and the need for decentralization to bring it about was only reinforced by seeing the limitations of permissioned blockchain platforms while working for Cinnober and Nasdaq. So, he was naturally drawn to the DeFi sector on Ethereum when it began to emerge in 2019.\n\nThat same year, it became clear that Ethereum and other blockchains could scale using zk-Rollups or optimistic fraud proofs, whereas Bitcoin had \u201calmost entirely abandoned\u201d the idea of doing anything with DeFi. So, he got behind DeFi on Ethereum.\n\n\u201cThat made me fall out of favor with Bitcoin maximalists because I was their golden kid: the one that was supposed to slay the altcoins, not one that was supposed to say actually, there is a use case here though, and this system actually does scale, and it\u2019s not as bad as you think.\u201d\n\nEric Wall. Source: LinkedIn\n\n\u201cSo, then I had to change Bitcoiners\u2019 understanding of the Ethereum system because they were now the ones that were spreading false facts about how the system works.\u201d\n\nHe concedes his former Bitcoiner friends think he\u2019s become a \u201cshitcoiner for financial motives.\u201d But Wall also wants to scale Bitcoin, too, and is involved in a research project with StarkNet and the Human Rights Foundation to investigate how to apply zk-Rollup scaling to Bitcoin, pondering \u201cwhat the benefits of that would be and how feasible it is.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, I am working on that, on trying to introduce that system and those technological benefits to Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s behind the Wall?\n\nWall was born in 1991 in the Swedish city of Link\u00f6ping and spent a gap year after high school traveling through Australia and Norway, working odd jobs from a deckhand on a luxury yacht to a \u201cchugger\u201d (charity mugger).\n\nHe studied computer engineering at Lund University, and his time there was notable for his organizational efforts as the \u201cfunmaker\u201d of \u201cSweden Silent Party,\u201d a series of silent disco events inspired by one the best nights of his life in Byron Bay. He also became one of the first Scandinavian engineers to write a Master\u2019s thesis about using blockchain to run a securities exchange in conjunction with local fintech Cinnober.\n\nEric Wall organized silent discos while at university. Source: Lund University\n\nHe was introduced to Bitcoin in his first year of university in 2011 by a classmate who showed him an article about darknet marketplace Silk Road. Buying Bitcoin at the time for $4 was a week-long process that required wiring money to Mt. Gox in Japan, so he gave up. A year later, Bitcoin had doubled to $8, and he thought he\u2019d \u201cmissed the boat.\u201d \u201cBut I became interested in this asset that increased 100% in one year\u201d and saw an opportunity to \u201cget an edge\u201d in a totally new asset class. He lost everything in Mt. Gox but gained a new career as a blockchain researcher and, later, blockchain lead at Cinnober.\n\nDuring his time there, and later at Nasdaq, he realized that companies or even countries weren\u2019t going to agree to create the sort of infrastructure required to build a genuinely decentralized, cross-jurisdictional system for the settlement of securities.\n\n\u201cIt needs to be something that the Chinese and the Japanese and the U.S. can use as a mutual system,\u201d he says. \u201cBut that was a gargantuan task. That\u2019s never going to happen from the inside. I understood that later. It has to be a system that comes from the outside and keeps growing.\u201d The only likely candidates were Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nHe told his bosses to put a hold on the enterprise blockchain stuff and to instead sell their incredibly fast matching engine tech to the big crypto exchanges. His colleagues thought crypto was a game or a joke \u2014 until Bitstamp turned up in a private jet.\n\n\u201cEven big stock exchange teams didn\u2019t spend that kind of money on a meeting with Cinnober,\u201d he says. \u201cThen they actually did take it seriously, and we did deliver a solution to them.\u201d\n\nMedia crypto commentator\n\nDuring this time, he also became the Swedish media\u2019s go-to guy for crypto commentary. He was determined to seize the opportunity but hated the stressful, anxiety-inducing process of appearing on live TV, so he\u2019d load up on valium to get through it.\n\n\u201cThen everything was fine. It didn\u2019t matter like getting a big camera in my face. I was completely zoned out,\u201d he says.\n\nEric sometimes adopts the persona of the slightly nicer Erica Wall online. Source: Twitter\n\n\u201cBut because I was so into crypto, I was doing crypto 17 hours a day. Even in that state, I could still articulate and explain everything about Bitcoin and what was going on even if I was only half conscious.\u201d\n\nIt was a similar story at crypto conferences, where Wall\u2019s ingrained Swedish standoffishness made the hundreds of brief interactions he had as a well-known figure quite stressful.\n\n\u201cFor them, they only get, like, five seconds with me on an escalator, and that\u2019s how they\u2019re going to remember me for years. So, I always feel like I want to deliver on that interaction. Which makes me feel a lot of pressure.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe\u2019s stopped taking meds these days after realizing he was meeting the same people multiple times at conferences and forgetting them.\n\n\u201cI have realized that now, at this point, like, I\u2019m gonna just be natural. I think I feel comfortable. I\u2019ve overcome my Swedishness eventually.\u201d\n\nNasdaq takeover\n\nCinnober was eventually taken over by Nasdaq in early 2019 for $190 million, and Wall found himself in a massive bureaucratic organization with little agency and lots of rules.\n\n\u201cAfter Nasdaq acquired, they told us, well, \u2018The great thing about Nasdaq is you\u2019re never gonna have more than six bosses above\u2026\u2019 It\u2019s a very flat organization,\u201d he says with dry humor. \u201cEvery tweet that I wrote had to go through the Nasdaq approval department.\u201d\n\nAt the time, Wall was fighting with multiple token projects online about their hyped claims. \u201cI thought that I was doing something very important,\u201d he explains. One notable conflict, still running today, was with the Iota founders after he argued in a 2017 Medium post saying the protocol does not provide any censorship resistance and is centralized around the Iota foundation\u2019s coordinator node.\n\nThis guy bet me 1 BTC that IOTA would disable the Coordinator in 2018 based on a technology I had debunked in detail how it was fraudulent (it was admitted years later and the CTO was fired and the project completely redesigned)\u2014yet he is upset me with *me* for wasting his time. https://t.co/MufJ6E0b0U \u2014 Eric Wall (@ercwl) November 25, 2022\n\nUnfortunately, Iota was also being considered by the Swedish Central Bank to help create a central bank digital currency, so Wall\u2019s online antics were not considered politically helpful.\n\n\u201cPeople were lying about what their technology could do, and you still had to treat them as respected industry participants, which I wasn\u2019t going to do. So, I didn\u2019t ask for permission from Nasdaq to tweet, and it ended up with us going our separate ways.\u201d\n\nArcane Assets\n\nWall then decided the best way to participate in the blockchain revolution was to participate in the economy, \u201cSo, I changed strategy and became a hedge fund manager,\u201d he says.\n\nIt\u2019s quite the leap from engineer to trader, and Wall tried and abandoned a variety of approaches. Initially, he learned technical analysis, using rules-based trading around indicators like Bollinger Bands and moving average convergence/divergence. But after writing an algorithm to backtest the rules, he realized they performed no better than random chance. Similarly, he thinks most charts and models are ludicrous, which is why he constantly jokes about the superiority of the Rainbow Chart (\u201chas emoji\u201d).\n\n1/15 Today, I'm comparing the two currently most popular bitcoin price models: Rainbow chart vs S2F!\n\n\n\nRainbow chart:\n\n\u2705 Tried & tested log regression (2014)\n\n\u2705 Never changed\n\n\u2705 Has emoji \ud83c\udf08\n\n\n\nS2F:\n\n\u274c New & complex (2019)\n\n\u274c Changes often\n\n\u274c Sounds like a sex position\n\n\n\nA thread \ud83d\udc47 pic.twitter.com/1Td6pZXPM4 \u2014 Eric Wall (@ercwl) April 15, 2020\n\nThen he moved on to investigating the technological fundamentals of projects to guide investment decisions, only to see his returns totally dwarfed by people who invested based on what the logo looked like. He\u2019s since settled on a new approach to trading: Work out what unsophisticated investors will buy in the future and buy it first.\n\n\u201cThe price is driven by just social factors. Basically, there\u2019s no fundamentals,\u201d he explains. \u201cWhen I go out and I write some articles about a particular technology component in some cryptocurrency that undermines the whole value proposition, that\u2019s a completely different thought process than the investment process. The investment process is just about, well, are people going to buy it?\u201d\n\nBut having to explain to his serious hedge fund bosses that he was buying tokens because he thought the masses would buy any old token with a dog on it, was tricky.\n\n\u201cThat was one of the things that I didn\u2019t like so much. These are regulated, traditional \u2018we run a pretty posh hedge fund that took capital from institutional level investors\u2019 and they don\u2019t want to hear: \u2018Well, people like the dog picture.\u2019 But that\u2019s how the market works.\u201d\n\nHe recalls investigating whether investing based on the viral growth of crypto hashtags on TikTok could be a path to riches, but the fund wouldn\u2019t give the strategy the go-ahead. Instead, Arcane insisted he invest based on rules and a checklist \u201cto make it an institutional-grade crypto fund that avoided all the bullshit.\u201d\n\n\u201cProblem is if you avoid all the bullshit, you avoid most of the profit.\u201d\n\nSo, again, Wall found himself chafing at the requirements of working for a big organization.\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019m like a degen in my blood. I think that the cryptocurrency space moves extremely fast, and you have to be as nimble as the space is. If the market one day says \u2018Okay, but screw all the technology \u2014 we\u2019re trading pictures of monkeys now,\u2019 you have to make the decision extremely fast that monkeys is what it is all about.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, if I\u2019m going to do something else, now it\u2019s going to be somewhere where the mandate is completely open.\u201d\n\nHe handed in his resignation in the first quarter of 2022 to work on a super-secret project that he\u2019s yet to reveal even a year on.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m now in the process of doing something else that hasn\u2019t been announced yet,\u201d is all he\u2019ll reveal."
