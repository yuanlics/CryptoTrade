        "content": "Asset manager Franklin Templeton, which oversees $1.4 trillion on behalf of clients, today announced that one of its funds is now supported on the Polygon blockchain.\n\nOne of the world\u2019s largest asset managers, Franklin Templeton said Wednesday that its Nasdaq-listed OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund (FOBXX) would use Polygon so it could \u201cbe further compatible with the rest of the digital ecosystem.\u201d\n\nFOBXX is Franklin Templeton\u2019s crypto product which puts cash into American government securities, cash and repurchase agreements. It currently has over $270 million in assets under management (AUM).\n\nIt is the first U.S.-registered fund to use a blockchain to process transactions and record share ownership.\n\nPolygon is the blockchain behind the 10th largest cryptocurrency by market cap, MATIC. It is a scaling platform for Ethereum, meaning that it works to make Ethereum faster and more efficient.\n\nHead of Digital Assets at Franklin Templetonton Roger Bayston said: \u201cExtending the reach of the Franklin OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund to Polygon enables the Fund to be further compatible with the rest of the digital ecosystem, specifically through an Ethereum-based blockchain.\u201d\n\nDecrypt\u2019s 2022 Crypto Project of the Year: Polygon\n\nColin Butler, Global Head of Institutional Capital at Polygon Labs, added that \u201cFranklin Templetonton is at the forefront\u201d of tokenizing assets.\n\nInvestors can buy shares of FOBXX and hold them in digital wallets via the Benji Investments mobile app.\n\nFranklin Templeton has long been involved in crypto: It announced a digital asset venture fund two years ago, and started digitizing shares for a money market fund on Stellar\u2019s blockchain back in 2019.\n\nEditor's note: This article has been updated to correct Franklin Templeton's assets under management and reflect that the firm has had its fund on the Stellar network since 2019.\n\n"

        "content": "Join the most important conversation in crypto and web3! Secure your seat today\n\nVertex, a decentralized exchange for the spot and derivatives trading of digital assets, has gone live on Arbitrum (ARB), a popular network built atop the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nVertex, which had been operating on a test network, combines an off-chain order book layered on top of an on-chain automated market maker on a decentralized, self-custodial exchange. The firm, which has bases in Singapore and the Cayman Islands, counts Jane Street, Dexterity Capital, Hudson River Trading, GSR, Collab+Currency, JST Capital, Big Brain and Lunatic Capital among its early backers.\n\nThe messy collapse of FTX and other centralized trading platform blowups last year has fueled a shift toward decentralized exchanges and self-custody. Ethereum layer 2 system Arbitrum is now the fastest-growing blockchain in total value locked and has surpassed Ethereum in daily transaction volume.\n\nThe Vertex team has been working on the protocol for about a year. Co-founder Darius Tabatabai said the platform has drawn interest from institutional traders and from retail traders who use Arbitrum.\n\n\u201cWe built all the smart contracting ourselves, so we\u2019re not forking anything,\u201d Tabatabai said in an interview with CoinDesk. \u201cThe [automated market maker] is quite conventional, but we have a bunch of tech under the surface that enables you to do leveraged AMMs, to do looping, and we have an inbuilt money market. So you can think of it as a combination of Aave, dYdX and Uniswap, with an order book.\u201d\n\nBuilding Vertex on Arbitrum and using an off-chain sequencer for the order book has enabled the venue to process between 10,000 and 15,000 transactions per second with the ability to match buy and sell orders in 10 to 30 milliseconds, a speed that rivals leading centralized venues and surpasses that on other decentralized exchanges, Tabatabai added.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "content": "Franklin OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund, the first U.S.-registered mutual fund run on blockchain, is now supported on Ethereum via Polygon\n\nSAN MATEO, Calif., April 26, 2023--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Franklin Templeton today announces that the Franklin OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund (FOBXX) (the \"Fund\"), the first U.S.-registered mutual fund to use a public blockchain to process transactions and record share ownership, is now supported on the Polygon blockchain.\n\nFranklin Templeton continues to see operational efficiencies through use of a blockchain-integrated system, including increased security, faster transaction processing and reduced costs, benefiting Fund shareholders. The Fund\u2019s transfer agent maintains the official record of share ownership via a proprietary blockchain-integrated system that utilizes blockchain technology for transaction activity.\n\n\"Extending the reach of the Franklin OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund to Polygon enables the Fund to be further compatible with the rest of the digital ecosystem, specifically through an Ethereum-based blockchain.

The Fund offers a competitive yield and is a regulated 1940 Act fund that invests at least 99.5 percent of its total assets in government securities, cash and repurchase agreements collateralized fully by government securities or cash. The Fund\u2019s investment goal is to provide investors with as high a level of current income as is consistent with the preservation of shareholders\u2019 capital and liquidity and aims to maintain a stable $1.00 share price.\n\nOne share of the Franklin OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund is represented by one BENJI token.
