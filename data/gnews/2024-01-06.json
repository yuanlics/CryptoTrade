The author argues that while Ethereum has potential improvements on its architecture and is more likely to benefit from increased development activity in crypto, Bitcoin is closer to going mainstream and has more institutional investor support, making it the better buy.\n\nThe author highlights the following points as reasons to consider Ethereum:\n\n1. Improvements to Ethereum's blockchain architecture, such as The Merge, which could lead to lower fees, faster transaction speeds, and higher overall throughput.\n2. Ethereum's active involvement in various crypto niches, including NFTs, DeFi, blockchain gaming, the metaverse, and Web3, which could lead to increased development activity and investor interest.\n\nHowever, the author concludes that, if forced to choose, they would still go with Bitcoin due to its institutional investor support and potential for mainstream adoption.

        "summary": "  The Ethereum network is experiencing a high of 15,000 validators exiting, the highest count in the queue, due to Celsius' announcement of unstaking its existing ETH holdings to offset restructuring costs. The collective value of the ETH set to be removed from the validator chain is over $1.09 billion. Despite this significant figure, the exit will barely impact the network or price action due to the large number of validators (905,000) and total staked ETH (28.8 million). The backlog is caused by Celsius' decision to unstake its ETH holdings, which will take a few days to complete given the enormous amount of ETH involved."

        "summary": "  Celsius Network, a crypto firm that filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the US, is in the final stages of its restructuring plan. The company has initiated the unstaking of over 200,000 ETH, worth approximately $470 million, to repay eligible creditors. This move is expected to have a minimal impact on the Ethereum network's security and price action, as there are over 28 million ETH staked by over 900,000 validators.\n\nThe former Celsius CEO, Alex Mashinsky, has been charged by the US Securities and Exchange Commission for falsely promising a safe investment through unregulated securities. However, Mashinsky has been released on a $40 million bail and the trial is scheduled for September 2024.\n\nThe collapse of Celsius had a significant impact on the cryptocurrency industry, with over $8 billion in loans and 1.7 million customers affected. The company had a $1.2 billion deficit and $167 million in c"

        "title": "Ethereum Layer-2: historical record for $21 billion TVL - The Cryptonomist",
        "summary": "  The total value locked (TVL) of Ethereum has reached a new all-time high of $21.16 billion, according to data from L2beat. This represents a 333% increase compared to the beginning of January 2023. The TVL in layer-2 has experienced a 34% increase in the last month, reaching $20.8 billion. Ethereum's layer-2 TVL surpasses the sum of all other layer-1 chains. Arbitrum One is the market leader with $10 billion in TVL, holding almost 50% of the market share. The Ethereum developers have outlined the path of Pectra in empowering decentralization through the implementation of Verkle Trees. The next ACDE call is scheduled for January 18th to provide flexibility in planning in case adjustments to the approach are needed. Dencun, through the implementation of EIP-4844, aims to significantly reduce transaction fees for Layer 2 rollups by replacing call data with lower gas-consuming blobs."

        "title": "\u201cWe Don't Need Layer 2s Like Ethereum\u201d, Posted Solana Co-Founder - The Coin Republic",
        "summary": "  The article discusses the views of Anatoly Yakovenko, co-founder of Solana, on the need for layer-2 solutions in blockchain technology, specifically in relation to Solana's ability to address growing demand for decentralized applications (DApps) without relying on these solutions. Yakovenko believes that Solana's hybrid consensus mechanism is sufficient for achieving scalability without the need for layer-2 solutions, such as side chains and zero-knowledge proofs. He emphasizes that the blockchain's primary mission is to synchronize a global atomic state machine, and that layer-2 solutions do not contribute to this goal.\n\nIn contrast, Ethereum, another major blockchain platform, heavily relies on layer-2 solutions to resolve issues with high transaction fees and congestion. Layer-2 solutions, such as Optimism and Arbitrium, have shown potential in offloading transactions from the main blockchain while maintaining compatibility with smart contracts. The combined total value locked (TVL) for layer-2 solutions is around $20 billion, with Arbitrium managing around $10 billion in assets.\n\nDes"
