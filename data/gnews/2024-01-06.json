        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) surged 90% in 2023, from January 1 to December 31, closing the year at $2,281 per token. At the time of publication, ETH is changing hands by $2,233 while whale investors increase their positions.\n\nIn particular, SpotOnChain spotted a huge purchase of $48 million in 30 minutes by \u2018Whale 0x931\u2019 on January 5, 2024. The mysterious whale used USDT and USDC stablecoins to acquire 21,192 ETH for a $2,265 average price.\n\nRemarkably, this address belongs to a gigantic whale worth around $142 million, with a balance of 79,500 ETH. Moreover, the \u2018Whale 0x931\u2019 has been building its position since January 13, 2023 \u2014 at an average price of $1,790.\n\nOverall, the mysterious whale currently holds more than $35 million in unrealized profit, up approximately 25% in a year.\n\n\u2018Whale 0x931\u2019 inflow Ethereum transactions.

However, increasing its position by 33% at higher prices signals that the mysterious whale is still bullish on Ethereum.\n\nThis recent purchase of $48 million on January 5, 2024, by a so far profitable whale suggests ETH might continue going up.\n\nEthereum (ETH) daily price chart on Binance. Source: TradingView\n\nNevertheless, even a smart gigantic whale is prone to make mistakes. There are no guarantees that Ethereum will continue its 2023 rally in 2024 despite strong indicators pointing to this outcome. ETH depends on an increased demand for its native token, which might come from market speculation and ecosystem growth moving forward.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "content": "Share:\n\nEthereum on-chain data shows that the current exit queue has a wait time of 5 days and 4 hours.\n\nCelsius announced that it would be unstaking its existing ETH holdings in order to offset restructuring costs.\n\nThe collective value of ETH set to be removed from the Ethereum validator chain is over $1.09 billion.\n\nEthereum Shanghai update introduced the option to withdraw the ETH staked by investors, essentially giving validators the option to exit the market. Since then, Friday marked the biggest day for the network as it noted the highest count of validator exits in the queue, all thanks to Celsius\n\nEthereum validator backlog\n\nEthereum is witnessing a historical moment. For the first time since it activated the withdrawal of staked ETH, a mass exit event can be witnessed. At the time of writing, the chain had an exit queue of 15,358 validators, and the expected wait time is presently five days and 4 hours.\n\nThis means that any validator that attempts to exit now will have to wait for five days before they can get their 32 ETH back. Furthermore, based on the value of one validator staking being 32 ETH, the chain is set to note an outflow of $1.09 billion worth of staking over the next few days.\n\nEthereum validator exit queue\n\nHowever, despite being such a humungous figure, it will barely make a dent in the network or sway the price action. This is because, at the moment, Ethereum has over 905,000 validators, and the total amount staked on the network is 28.8 million ETH. This represents nearly 24% of the entire circulating supply of the digital asset.\n\nThe reason behind the backlog\n\nCelsius, a prominent name in the crypto space until its bankruptcy in July 2022, is in the process of restructuring the entire company. This includes asset distribution, for which Celsius has begun recalling and rebalancing assets to ensure ample liquidity.\n\nConsequentially, the company announced that it would be unstaking all its existing ETH holdings in order to offset the costs it has been facing throughout the restructuring process. It also addressed the backlog caused by this decision, stating that the process would take a few days given the enormous amount of ETH set to be unstacked."

        "content": "Ethereum, one of the most prominent cryptocurrencies within the digital assets realm, recently gained significant traction across the broader crypto market following a noteworthy transaction on Saturday. According to the on-chain data floating over the crypto horizon, Paradigm, an institutional liquidity network, dumped substantial amounts of ETH to Coinbase, one of the world\u2019s leading crypto exchanges.\n\nThe dumping of Ethereum to the aforementioned CEX soon nabbed noteworthy attention among crypto market enthusiasts globally as the transaction surfaced within the market amid the token\u2019s price drop. Intriguingly, Ethereum\u2019s price today traded briefly in the green, fueling market optimism. However, with the transaction emerging within the crypto landscape, the price promptly went downwards, curating a hurricane of speculations for the cryptocurrency.\n\nadvertisement\n\nParadigm\u2019s ETH Transfer To CEX: Report\n\nAccording to the data unveiled by Lookonchain, a platform streamlining on-chain metrics, Paradigm deposited 6,500 ETH, worth $14.67 million, to Coinbase today, January 6, 2024. Intriguingly, Paradigm accumulated these ETH at phenomenal price lows.\n\nMoreover, as per past market data, Paradigm seems to be mirroring smart money addresses, gathering colossal amounts of ETH amid bearish market sentiments and thereafter selling the same in bullish markets. Concerning this, even today\u2019s ETH deposit was accumulated at a price low when ETH was evaluated at less than $500. Now, as the price crosses $2,200, Paradigm appears to have sold the aforestated number of ETH to Coinbase, garnering notable profits.\n\nAlso Read: OpenAI & Microsoft Face Another Lawsuit Amid NYT Woes Over AI Training\n\nEthereum Price Dips\n\nAs of writing, the Ethereum price noted a marginal drop of 0.81% over the past 24 hours and is currently trading at $2,236. Moreover, this dip was further accompanied by a weekly drop of 2.83%, followed by a monthly fall of 1.66%.\n\nIntriguingly, today\u2019s price briefly traded in the green, amassing significant attention among crypto market traders and investors globally. However, it soon started moving downwards, aligning with Paradigm\u2019s massive selloff around the same time period.\n\nAlso Read: Solana (SOL) Price Falls Below $95 Amid Wider Crypto Sell-Off"

        "title": "Arbitrum (ARB) Rise: Daily DEX Volume Surges, Outpacing Ethereum By $400 Million - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Arbitrum, a prominent Layer-2 (L2) scaling solution, has been on a remarkable upward trajectory since the launch of its native token, ARB, in March 2023. The past 30 days witnessed a staggering 74% surge in ARB\u2019s value, underscoring the growing market interest in the protocol.\n\nNotably, Arbitrum\u2019s daily decentralized exchange (DEX) volume has experienced a significant surge, propelling the protocol to surpass Ethereum (ETH) for the first time in this key metric.\n\nThis milestone highlights Arbitrum\u2019s increasing adoption and recognition for its scalability within the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem.\n\nArbitrum Sets New DEX Records\n\nAccording to data from DefiLlama, Arbitrum\u2019s daily DEX volume reached an impressive $1.834 billion over the past 24 hours, surpassing Ethereum\u2019s volume of $1.444 billion. Analyzing DefiLlama\u2019s data, it becomes evident that Arbitrum\u2019s growth extends beyond daily DEX volume alone.\n\nThe weekly change in ARB\u2019s value soared by 32.58%, showcasing the token\u2019s strong performance in the market. Moreover, Arbitrum\u2019s seven-day volume reached an impressive $6.804 billion, indicating robust trading activity on the protocol.\n\nIn terms of total value locked (TVL) in DEX, Arbitrum accounted for $1.297 billion, constituting 33.40% of the total TVL. In comparison, Ethereum\u2019s TVL stood at $5.92 billion, making up 26.29% of the total. This demonstrates Arbitrum\u2019s growing prominence as users increasingly recognize its potential for efficient and secure decentralized trading.\n\nARB\u2019s Financial Metrics Soar\n\nFurther demonstrating the growth of the protocol\u2019s ecosystem, token terminal data shows that Arbitrum\u2019s market capitalization (in circulation) has increased by an impressive 83.84% to $2.56 billion.\n\nThe revenue generated by Arbitrum over the past 30 days has also experienced remarkable growth, with a 79.82% increase to reach $11.66 million.\n\nFurthermore, looking at the fully diluted market capitalization, Arbitrum has witnessed an identical 83.84% rise to reach $20.07 billion.\n\nArbitrum\u2019s revenue on an annualized basis has seen a significant boost, surging by 101.67% to reach $141.81 million. This figure represents the projected revenue for a full year based on the current monthly revenue, underscoring the protocol\u2019s sustained growth.\n\nIn terms of fees generated, Arbitrum\u2019s 30-day figures have surged by 79.82% to reach $11.66 million, demonstrating the protocol\u2019s ability to capture a significant share of transactional fees within its ecosystem.\n\nOn an annualized basis, fees have soared by 101.67% to reach $141.81 million, further validating the protocol\u2019s revenue growth and economic potential.\n\nNevertheless, the protocol\u2019s native token, ARB, is trading at $1.8962, down over 8% in the past 24 hours and below its all-time high (ATH) of $2.11 set on Thursday. Despite this pullback, it is still up 36% over the past 14 days, demonstrating the token\u2019s bullish momentum.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock, chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "Better Buy: Bitcoin or Ethereum? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "After Bitcoin (BTC 2.11%) soared by more than 150% last year, investors are now looking far and wide for cryptocurrencies that might be able to outperform Bitcoin in 2024. One intriguing candidate is Ethereum (ETH 1.19%), which is still the world's second-most valuable cryptocurrency with a whopping $270 billion market cap.\n\nWhile Ethereum might not get the same hype as Bitcoin, it's certainly worth a closer look, especially if some of the catalysts expected to push Bitcoin higher fail to materialize. Let's take a closer look.\n\nThe spot Bitcoin ETF\n\nJust about everyone agrees that investor anticipation of a new spot Bitcoin ETF is the key factor pushing Bitcoin higher right now. The underlying logic makes sense: A new regulated financial product for investing in Bitcoin should attract money from both retail and institutional investors. If institutional investors with trillions of dollars of assets under management allocate just 1% of their portfolios to Bitcoin, that could result in literally tens of billions of dollars flowing into Bitcoin. That would almost certainly cause the price of Bitcoin to soar.\n\nBut there are several problems with that argument, says JPMorgan Chase (JPM 0.05%). In a December research note to clients, JPMorgan Chase specifically pointed out that much of the hype around the Bitcoin ETF might be undeserved. For one, spot Bitcoin ETF products exist elsewhere in the world (in both Canada and Europe), and they have experienced relatively weak demand. What's to say that the U.S. market will be different?\n\nMoreover, there are other Bitcoin investment products to choose from right now. Popular choices include Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC 4.57%) and ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO 4.38%). So instead of huge flows of new money into Bitcoin, we might just see a reshuffling of money out of existing Bitcoin investment products and into the new spot Bitcoin ETF. The net impact, in that case, would not be nearly as great as some are now predicting.\n\nThe Bitcoin halving\n\nThe second major catalyst for Bitcoin is the approaching halving event. This event, which occurs only once every four years, is coming up in April, and it's likely to be one of the most talked-about developments in the crypto market this year. In three past halvings, the price of Bitcoin has soared, and many investors are expecting the same to happen again. In fact, some are now predicting that Bitcoin could push through the $100,000 mark by the end of the year.\n\nBut keep in mind that a growing number of influential voices on Wall Street think that much of the Bitcoin halving's impact might already be priced in. If you buy into the efficient market hypothesis, which says that all publicly available information is already factored into prices, then maybe the halving will be a non-event.\n\nAfter all, the entire market knows when the halving is going to take place. There are websites with clocks counting down the seconds. And the entire market has plenty of historical data to work with. Granted, the crypto market may not be as efficient as the equity market at pricing in information, but it's safe to say that every major Wall Street firm is aware of the implications of the Bitcoin halving.\n\nThe case for Ethereum\n\nWhile Ethereum may not have the same kinds of catalysts as Bitcoin, it is working on significant improvements to its overall blockchain architecture. Ethereum has not really delivered on everything it originally promised for The Merge, when it transitioned to a much more energy effective network. This year might be an opportunity to reassure investors that everything is still on track. If these improvements lead to lower fees, faster transaction speeds, and higher overall throughput, it could make Ethereum much more attractive to investors.\n\nMoreover, Ethereum is more likely to benefit from increased development activity in crypto than Bitcoin. That's because Ethereum, unlike Bitcoin, is active in just about every major niche of the blockchain and crypto world, including non-fungible tokens (NFTs), decentralized finance (DeFi), blockchain gaming, the metaverse, and Web3. During the long crypto winter that set in during 2022, many of these areas went into hibernation. But in a crypto spring, they could come back to life.\n\nAnd the better buy is...\n\nI've tried to make a compelling case for Ethereum, but if forced to choose between Bitcoin and Ethereum, I'm still going with Bitcoin. Yes, the new spot Bitcoin ETF might be overhyped. And yes, the Bitcoin halving cycle might be underwhelming this time around. But with so much institutional investor support behind it now, Bitcoin is closer to going mainstream than at any time in its history. If there's just one crypto to buy in 2024, it's Bitcoin."
