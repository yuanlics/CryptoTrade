        "summary": "  The Ethereum Shanghai upgrade is a significant change for the Ethereum network, allowing users to access their staked Ether (ETH) funds for the first time. This upgrade is scheduled to launch in March 2023 and will enable stakers to remove both their staked ETH and the rewards accrued. This change has been sought by Ethereum users and the crypto community at large. The upgrade also includes other proposals related to the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) Object Format (EOF), which will increase scalability by sharding data. The deposit activity on the platform has been experiencing heavy deposits in the lead-up to the Shanghai upgrade, and MetaMask has also joined in by integrating Lido and Rocket Pool to allow users to stake ETH directly from their MetaMask wallets. Overall, the Shanghai upgrade is a major milestone for Ethereum, paving the way for more significant adjustments ahead."

This represents 10.3 million ETH, worth over $16.86 billion, and nearly a third of all staked ETH on liquid staking protocol Lido is sitting at an average loss of 63%. The on-chain analytics platform suggests that the low selling pressure after the upcoming Shanghai upgrade is due to the fact that staked ETH holders are not sitting on extreme profits, and the most profitable staked ETH was staked less than a year ago, with no significant profit-taking events in the past. Ethereum is currently trading at $1,637."
