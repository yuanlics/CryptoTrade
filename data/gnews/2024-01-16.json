        "title": "Ethereum Staking Explained: Is ETH Staking Worth It? - CoinCodex",
        "content": "In September 2022, the Ethereum blockchain received its biggest upgrade to date. The Merge upgrade moved Ethereum from Proof-of-Work over to Proof-of-Stake. The transition to Proof-of-Stake has made the Ethereum much more environmentally friendly and also laid the foundation for future upgrades, which will significantly improve the scalability of the network.\n\nWith the introduction of Proof-of-Stake on Ethereum, ETH holders now have the opportunity to stake their coins and earn staking rewards in the form of additional ETH. In this article, we\u2019ll explain Ethereum staking and present the different options ETH holders have when it comes to earning staking rewards.\n\nKey highlights: The Ethereum network transitioned to a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism in September of 2021.\n\nThis means that ETH holders can now stake their ETH to provide additional security to the network and earn rewards.\n\nIf you want to run your own validator, you need 32 ETH.\n\nIf you don't have 32 ETH, you can still earn staking rewards. You can use liquid staking protocols such as Lido or stake your ETH with the help of a crypto exchange.\n\nWe explain all the different ways of staking ETH and highlight the benefits and disadvantages of each.\n\nWhat is Ethereum staking?\n\nEthereum now uses a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism, in which validators stake ETH in exchange for participating in the consensus process. Validators are rewarded for adding new blocks to the Ethereum blockchain and for checking that blocks proposed by other validators follow the protocol\u2019s rules.\n\nValidators that are reliable and act in the best interests of the network receive ETH as a reward. At the time of writing, validators on Ethereum are earning an APR (annual percentage rate) of about 4%. If you\u2019re investing in Ethereum and don\u2019t plan to sell in the short term, staking ETH is certainly worth considering to passively grow your ETH holdings.\n\nThe rewards earned by each validator depend on the total number of validators that are active on the Ethereum network, as well as network activity (more activity means more potential income from transaction fees).\n\nThe catch is that validators who are not reliable or are found to be breaking the rules are punished by having a portion or the entirety of their ETH stake taken away.\n\nWho can stake ETH?\n\nIn order to launch your own validator, you need to have 32 ETH. At the time of writing, this translates to about $57,000, so it\u2019s definitely not accessible to everyone from a financial perspective.\n\nHowever, the good news is that there are still ways to earn staking rewards with your ETH even if you don\u2019t have the 32 ETH required to launch your own validator. We\u2019ll discuss the different ways to stake ETH a bit further below in the article.\n\nInitially, staked ETH coins could not be withdrawn. However, this was changed with the Shapella upgrade in April of 2023, which gave users the ability to withdraw their staked coins.\n\nWhere to stake ETH?\n\nThere\u2019s four distinct options for ETH holders that want to stake their ETH and earn staking rewards.\n\nSolo staking\n\nStaking as a service\n\nStaking pools\n\nStaking through crypto exchanges\n\nHowever, solo staking and staking as a service are limited to those that have at least 32 ETH.\n\nDo you have 32 ETH to stake?\n\nIf you have 32 or more ETH to stake, you can access solo staking or staking as a service solutions. Of course, you can also use other ways of staking ETH that are also available to users that have less than 32 ETH to stake.\n\nSolo staking\n\nSolo staking involves launching your own Ethereum validator and maintaining it yourself. Each validator you run requires a stake of 32 ETH.\n\nWhen you\u2019re solo staking, you\u2019re directly participating in the consensus process of the Ethereum blockchain and contribute to the network\u2019s decentralization. In addition, you remain in full control of your private keys and receive full staking rewards directly from the Ethereum protocol. This is why the Ethereum Foundation describes solo staking as the \u201cgold standard\u201d for Ethereum staking.\n\nWhile solo staking certainly has a lot of benefits, it is the least accessible way to stake ETH for the average person. The most obvious barrier to entry is that you need at least 32 ETH, which is simply out of reach for most Ethereum investors. Operating a validator also requires some technical expertise, and you need to ensure that your validator stays online continuously to avoid inactivity penalties.\n\nStaking as a service\n\nThere are various staking as a service providers that offer to manage one or more Ethereum validators on your behalf. When using these services, you\u2019re required to provide ETH (32 ETH per validator). In most cases, you get to keep control of your private keys, which is a plus.\n\nOf course, staking as a service providers need some form of compensation for operating validator nodes on your behalf. So, while your validators will be earning ETH staking rewards directly from the Ethereum protocol, you will have to pay a fee to the service provider to keep your validators up and running.\n\nSo, staking as a service can be a good option if you have the sufficient amount of ETH to have your own validators but don\u2019t want to deal with the technical aspects of setting up a node and keeping it operational.\n\nOverall, your returns will be slightly lower than what you\u2019d get with solo staking as you\u2019ll have to pay a fee to the provider. Some examples of staking as a service providers are BloxStaking and Abyss Finance.\n\nDo you have less than 32 ETH to stake?\n\nIf you don't have 32 ETH to stake, you can't engage in solo staking, but there's other options available to you.\n\nStaking pools\n\nStaking pools take ETH deposits from multiple users and pool them together to launch Ethereum validators. This makes it possible for anyone to stake their ETH, even if they don\u2019t have 32 ETH themselves.\n\nStaking pools are a very popular way of staking Ethereum, and many of them offer liquid staking, which is a very handy feature. Here\u2019s two examples of the top two Ethereum staking pools available today.\n\nLido\n\nLido is a liquid staking solution that supports multiple blockchains, including Ethereum. Lido is the most popular way to stake Ethereum. At the time of writing, over 30% of all staked ETH has been staked through Lido.\n\nAfter staking your ETH through Lido, you will receive an equivalent amount of stETH tokens, which represent your staked ETH and any accrued rewards. These stETH tokens can be used in DeFi protocols or even sold if you need liquidity.\n\nHowever, you should keep in mind that the stETH to ETH exchange rate is usually skewed in favor of ETH, so you will likely receive a bit less than 1 ETH for each stETH you sell. Of course, you are also able to redeem your stETH for staked ETH on a 1:1 basis.\n\nRocket Pool\n\nRocket Pool is also a liquid staking solution that allows users to stake smaller amounts of ETH. The minimum amount of ETH that can be staked through Rocket Pool is 0.01 ETH, which makes the service highly accessible.\n\nWhen you stake ETH through Rocket Pool, your staked coins and accrued rewards are represented with rETH tokens. Similarly to stETH, you can use rETH in any way you please. rETH holders can redeem their tokens for ETH on a 1:1 basis.\n\nOverall, staking pools are a good option for anyone that\u2019s looking to earn Ethereum staking rewards but has less than 32 ETH to stake.\n\nCrypto exchanges\n\nMany cryptocurrency exchanges offer Ethereum staking services to their users. For example, you can stake your Ethereum on Binance, which is a solid option since you will be able to retain liquidity thanks to BETH, a token that represents ETH staked through Binance.\n\nWhen staking through an exchange, you deposit ETH to the exchange. The exchange then pools together ETH from multiple users to deploy Ethereum validators. The rewards earned by these validators are then distributed to the users who staked their ETH, but the exchange will typically take a cut from the rewards as a fee for the service they provide.\n\nStaking through exchanges is probably the most convenient way to earn Ethereum staking rewards, but it also requires the most trust. When you deposit your ETH to a centralized crypto exchange, you have to trust that they will manage your funds responsibly. In addition, there could be a negative impact to the decentralization of Ethereum if exchanges control a large number of validators.\n\nComparison of Ethereum staking methods\n\nNow that we\u2019ve briefly explained each different Ethereum staking method, let\u2019s do a quick comparison of their pros and cons.\n\nMinimum amount Pros Cons Solo staking 32 ETH Full control over staking setup\n\nReceive full rewards\n\nContributes most to decentralization High barrier to entry\n\nRequires technical knowledge Staking as a service 32 ETH Much simpler than solo staking\n\nKeep control of keys required to withdraw or transfer staked ETH Service providers take a fee\n\nHigh barrier to entry Staking pools Small (0.01 ETH or less) You can stake smaller amounts of ETH\n\nMany staking pools offer liquidity tokens\n\nNon-custodial options available Smart contract risks\n\nLiquidity token price fluctuations Crypto exchanges Small (0.01 ETH or less) Very convenient way of staking ETH\n\nMany exchanges offer liquid staking options Requires trust in the exchange\n\nExchange takes a cut of the rewards\n\nCentralization risks\n\nEthereum \"restaking\"\n\nRecently, the concept of Ethereum \"restaking\" has started to gain traction in the crypto community. Through protocols such as EigenLayer, users who own staked ETH can choose to \"restake\" their coins to help provide security to applications that function on top of the Ethereum network. Essentially, this means that staked ETH can be used to validate networks and services other than the Ethereum mainnet, allowing users to earn additional rewards on top of the standard ETH staking yield.\n\nCurrently, the most popular Ethereum restaking protocol is EigenLayer, which supports restaking both for ETH as well as liquid staking tokens such as stETH and rETH. Please keep in mind that restaking is a relatively new concept and doesn't have a long track record in real-world conditions. If you're using a protocol such as EigenLayer to restake your ETH, you could be taking on substantially more risk than if you just kept your coins staked normally.\n\nThe bottom line\u2014ETH staking is a good choice for long-term holders\n\nEthereum staking is worth it if you\u2019re an ETH holder and plan to hold your coins over the long term. This is already the position of many ETH holders, as Ethereum is widely perceived as one of the best cryptocurrencies to hold for the long term. Before deciding whether staking is right for you, make sure to check the current ETH staking rewards to see what kind of APR to expect.\n\nIf you\u2019re also interested in cryptocurrencies other than Ethereum, check out our list of the best cryptocurrencies to buy right now."

        "title": "Ethereum outperforms Bitcoin by 20%, but how long can ETH hold $2.5K support? - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Ethereum's native token, Ether (ETH), rallied 20% between Jan. 8 and Jan. 11 but struggled to sustain the $2,600 level. The subsequent 3.5% correction down to $2,560 on Jan. 16 may have disappointed some bulls, but Ether's price has outperformed Bitcoin (BTC) by 19.5% since Jan. 8. Such gaps are quite uncommon and last occurred in October 2022.\n\nEther investors question if the $2,500 level will hold, given that the most obvious drivers are not expected in the short term, namely the Ethereum spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) and the planned Ethereum network upgrades. From a bullish perspective, these events present an opportunity for Ether to further decouple from the remaining cryptocurrency market, but they also present a risk if it either backfires or is postponed.\n\nEther usually does not outperform Bitcoin by 15%\n\nThe price of Ether outperforming Bitcoin by 15% or higher in a week is not something common, at least in the past two years. Besides the high correlation between the two cryptocurrencies, 2023 was marked by disappointment with Ethereum's declining total value locked (TVL) and persistently high gas fees, paving the way for competing blockchains. Meanwhile, Bitcoin benefited from the anticipation of a spot ETF approval, especially after BlackRock joined the race in June 2023.\n\nIn fact, the latest instance happened 14 months ago as Ether's price rallied from $1,305 to $1,615 in the seven days leading to Oct. 29, 2022. After outperforming Bitcoin by 17%, the gap closed in the following 11 days as ETH crashed below $1,100 on Nov. 9, 2022.\n\nEther/USD (blue) vs. Bitcoin/USD (orange), October 2022. Source: TradingView\n\nA single past instance should not serve as guidance for prices, especially considering November 2022 marked the downfall of the FTX exchange after reports of customer funds mismanagement and a potential $8 billion shortfall. A counter-example includes the 31 days between July 13, 2022, and Aug. 13, 2022, where Ether's price outperformed Bitcoin by 63%.\n\nEther/USD (blue) vs. Bitcoin/USD (orange), August 2022. Source: TradingView\n\nETH rallied from $1,080 to $1,990 during the 31 days ending Aug. 13, 2022, and despite failing to break above $2,000, the gap relative to Bitcoin's price persisted in the following month. In essence, a much different type of price action from the short-lived outperformance in October 2022. More importantly, the gap continued even though the cryptocurrency market capitalization faced a correction, which is opposite from what one typically expects given Bitcoin's dominance.\n\nEthereum network activity signals strength and higher demand for ETH\n\nTo understand whether Ether has what it takes to hold the $2,500 support, one should analyze the Ethereum network activity, including its scaling solutions. Decentralized applications (DApps) are at the core of this smart contract-capable blockchain, thus diminishing use in terms of users and volumes is indicative of less demand for ETH.\n\nRelated: Spot Ethereum ETF not coming 'anytime soon,' says Mark Yusko\n\nTo assess network demand, one needs to analyze metrics related to DApp usage, as some projects including games, decentralized finance (DeFi), and nonfungible token marketplaces are not financially intensive, rendering the total value locked (TVL) metric irrelevant. Over the past 30 days, the top Ethereum decentralized applications (DApps) have seen an average 26% decrease in the number of active addresses.\n\nBlockchains ranked by 30-day DApp volumes. Source: DappRadar\n\nOver the past 30 days, Ethereum DApps experienced a 41% gain in volume fueled by increases in Uniswap, Balancer, ParaSwap, and Aave. Consequently, even if one excludes the activity in Ethereum rollups, the base layer holds a 6 to 1 advantage versus its largest competitor, BNB Chain. That shows how bears' criticism toward Ethereum high fees is exaggerated in terms of dominance in the DeFi industry.\n\nBesides the strong on-chain activity, Ether's price could benefit from the \"Dencun\" hard fork, an upgrade that aims to increase data availability and reduce costs for rollup transactions. The test implementations are expected to initiate on Jan. 17. Furthermore, Bloomberg ETF analysts hold 70% odds of an Ethereum ETF approval by May, reinforcing the bullish momentum and the strength of the $2,500 price support.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "Ethereum processed a record high of nearly 2M transactions on Jan. 14\n\nBy: Samuel Haig \u2022 Loading...\n\nDeFi News\n\nEthereum\u2019s throughput surged to a record high as the network\u2019s burn rate pushes the supply of ETH to new post-merge lows.\n\nData from L2beat shows activity on Ethereum jumping to a new all-time high of 22.7 transactions per second (TPS) on Jan. 14 after jumping 62% in a day. Nearly 2M transactions were settled over 24 hours amid the spike in activity.\n\nFor comparison, Ethereum\u2019s throughput has predominantly trended between 11 TPS and 14 TPS since mid-2020, sans a brief spike to 19.9 TPS in May 2021 as the post-DeFi summer boomed peaked.\n\nDespite on-chain activity rocketing to unprecedented levels, throughput on the Ethereum mainnet continues to be overshadowed by the booming Layer 2 ecosystem. Ethereum L2s processed more than 63 TPS on average during Jan. 14, down from an all-time high of more than 152 TPS on Dec. 16 amid surging inscriptions activity.\n\nEthereum mainnet and Layer 2 throughput. Source: L2beat.\n\nETH\u2019s supply hit new local lows\n\nEthereum\u2019s throughput milestone coincides with a persistently high burn-rate pushing the supply of Ether to new post-merge lows. Ethereum\u2019s Shanghai upgrade, also known as The Merge, reduced the rate of new Ether issuance by around 90% in September 2022. The upgrade paved the way for Ether to become deflationary as the network\u2019s burn rate appeared poised to off-set new ETH entering supply.\n\nThe supply of ETH steadily fell throughout most of 2023, excluding two months of inflation as activity lulled during September and October, and again amid the New Year holiday week. Ether\u2019s supply has fallen by 5,745.5 ETH over the past seven days to tag a new post-merge low of roughly 120.76M coins, according to Ultra Sound Money.\n\nUniswap was the leading source of burned Ether with 2,054 ETH destroyed over the past seven days, followed by token transfers with 1,480 ETH, and Tether with 1,033.8. Surgeon Layer 2s Arbitrum and ZkSync Era also accounted for a significant share of burned coins through sequencing fees.\n\nEther supply changes over 30 days.

        "title": "Ethereum: What Q1 2024 holds for investors - AMBCrypto English",
        "content": "Ethereum faced some turmoil after recent volatility muted bullish sentiment.\n\nDespite this, the usage and holder sentiment remained strong, which is good news for investors.\n\nEthereum [ETH] saw a drop in its estimated leverage ratio metric over the past month. This downward trend came at a time when prices managed to scale past significant resistance levels.\n\nThe volatility behind Bitcoin [BTC] was one contributing factor. BTC threatened to break out past $44.3k multiple times (and accomplished it twice), only to fall back within the range formation of the past six weeks.\n\nThis has inspired some doubt in the minds of ETH speculators and investors. Additionally, Ethereum has also lagged behind Bitcoin in terms of price appreciation. AMBCrypto looked closer at relevant on-chain metrics and found that investors have reason to be confident.\n\nWhat are the implications of the Estimated Leverage Ratio falling?\n\nWhen the prices of ETH go up but the leverage ratio trends downward, it points toward reduced speculative activity and leverage trading. This could be due to diminished bullish sentiment. Alternatively, it could also be indicative of a rally that is driven by the spot markets and organic demand instead of Open Interest in the futures market.\n\nThe chart showed that the metric saw sharp drops in the past month. The 14-day simple moving average has trended downward. However, the leverage ratio saw a sizeable bounce after 6 January as prices rebounded higher.\n\nThe volatility in the past few weeks also likely forced leveraged traders to close their positions or liquidate them. This also likely led to a falling estimated leverage ratio.\n\nTo understand whether an accumulation of ETH in the spot markets was a significant contributing factor, AMBCrypto analyzed the exchange outflow metric.\n\nThe 7-day EMA of the exchange outflow was used to see if it trended upward noticeably. While there were individual spikes upward, it was not like the steady uptrend of October.\n\nThis suggested that the idea of a market-wide accumulation of ETH in the spot markets was not backed strongly by the outflows.\n\nThus far, the evidence points toward profit-taking and reduced risk-taking tendency in the Futures market. Once again, given the volatility of the past three weeks, the explanation held credibility. Yet, there\u2019s more to the story.\n\nThe reasons why investors could take heart from the recent developments\n\nTo highlight the market sentiment, AMBCrypto took a look at the Open Interest chart of Ethereum. Once again, the 7-day EMA gave a clearer picture of the current trends.\n\nIt showed that since the 9th of December, the OI has oscillated significantly instead of the uptrend it had been on since mid-September.\n\nThe decline in OI came alongside strong price drops, especially during the rejections that ETH faced at $2.4k throughout December.\n\nThe recent price action suggested that ETH has not found its local top. The multiple rejections at $2.4k were followed by a huge surge in prices after the BTC spot ETF approvals came.\n\nThis saw the prices touch the $2.7k mark, breaking the resistance zone at long last.\n\nTo understand if holders are confident of further gains, the MVRV ratio was analyzed, among other metrics. The MVRV ratio nearly reached December\u2019s highs during the rally.\n\nMore importantly, it remained well above zero to show that a large amount of holders were in profit at press time.\n\nThe Weighted Sentiment also saw a strong peak during the price rally, but has fallen since then. The Active Addresses has steadily trended higher in the past two months, which indicated increased engagement and potential demand.\n\nAdditionally, the transaction volume (30-day SMA) has not fallen dramatically either. It has maintained a roughly steady level in the past two months and saw occasional large peaks as activity surged enormously.\n\nOnce again, this was a sign of steady network usage.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024-25\n\nEven though the price volatility hurt futures traders and diminished the bullish sentiment, the on-chain metrics showed that it was business as usual.\n\nThe high MVRV ratio was encouraging, even though the exchange outflows were not particularly convincing. This is why Ethereum\u2019s prices are expected to climb higher in Q1 2024."

        "content": "The United States Securities and Exchange Commission is unlikely to approve a spot Ether (ETH) exchange-traded fund (ETF) this year despite the optimism sparked by the recent approval of the first spot (BTC) Bitcoin ETF, according to Morgan Creek Capital co-founder and CEO Mark Yusko.\n\nIn a recent interview, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said there is a 70% chance a spot Ether ETF will be approved by May. However, Yusko disagrees.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d probably say less than 50/50,\u201d he told Cointelegraph in an exclusive interview.\n\nDespite the recent Bitcoin ETF approval, Yusko argued that the SEC remains broadly hostile toward cryptocurrencies, as was suggested by the agency\u2019s head, Gary Gensler, in his message on the day of the approval.\n\nAnother obstacle, according to Yusko, is that the SEC may still regard Ether as a security \u2014 unlike Bitcoin, which is considered a commodity.\n\nSwitching topics to Bitcoin, Yusko argued that the approval of the spot ETF will dramatically reduce BTC\u2019s volatility and, therefore, its potential returns. Investors should welcome that, according to Yusko, as it\u2019s a sign of the maturation of the asset.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t invented for day trading,\u201d he said about Bitcoin. \u201cIt was invented to allow you and I to exchange value without asking permission.\u201d\n\nTo find out more about the long-term impact of the spot Bitcoin ETF approval, check out the full interview on Cointelegraph\u2019s YouTube channel, and don\u2019t forget to subscribe!"

        "content": "The recent approval of the first Bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has reverberated across the cryptocurrency landscape, triggering a significant surge in various altcoins, with Ethereum Classic (ETC) taking the spotlight.\n\nOften overshadowed by its more well-known sibling, Ethereum, ETC has emerged as the clear winner in the aftermath of the groundbreaking news, experiencing an impressive surge of over 31% in the past seven days.\n\nEthereum Classic Trading Volume Up\n\nSince the SEC\u2019s approval of the Grayscale Bitcoin ETF on January 10th, Ethereum Classic has skyrocketed by a staggering 30%, currently maintaining a trading value around $26. This meteoric rise has been accompanied by a remarkable 270% increase in trading volume, soaring to a substantial $1.8 billion.\n\nSuch robust figures underscore a palpable surge in investor confidence, suggesting the potential for further gains in the near future.\n\nWhile Bitcoin itself witnessed a modest price increase, briefly touching $47,000, Ethereum stole the limelight by breaking a 20-month barrier and surpassing $2,600.\n\nEthereum Classic currently trading at $26.36 on the daily chart: TradingView.com\n\nThis remarkable 10% surge within a mere 24 hours has positioned Ethereum at its highest value since May 2022. Analysts attribute this impressive performance to Ethereum\u2019s robust underlying technology and recent network upgrades, cementing its status as a favorable option for investors after Bitcoin.\n\nThe approval of the Bitcoin spot ETF is not the sole catalyst for this altcoin rally; the much-anticipated Bitcoin halving event, scheduled for later in the year, is also playing a pivotal role in bolstering bullish sentiment.\n\nETC price action in the weekly timeframe. Source: Coingecko\n\nThis event, occurring approximately every four years, involves a reduction in the number of newly minted Bitcoins and has historically coincided with price appreciation in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nThe confluence of these factors has created a perfect storm for Ethereum Classic, propelling it towards the coveted $30 mark.\n\nETC Strong Performance\n\nIndustry experts anticipate that this milestone may be achieved soon, fueled by Ethereum Classic\u2019s impressive trading volume and market capitalization, which has surged by 34% to cross the $4 billion mark since the ETF news broke.\n\nHowever, amidst the euphoria surrounding this surge, it remains crucial to acknowledge the inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market. While the approval of the Bitcoin spot ETF and the impending halving event offer promising prospects, unforeseen factors can swiftly alter market dynamics.\n\nThe recent ascent of Ethereum Classic serves as a compelling testament to the interconnectedness of the cryptocurrency market and the substantial impact of major regulatory decisions.\n\nAs the industry continues to evolve, it will be intriguing to observe how other altcoins respond to these developments and whether Ethereum Classic can sustain its lead in this post-ETF era.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

Meanwhile, its native token, Ether, aims at the $3,000 price zone, threatening a short squeeze soon.\n\nRemarkably, the total value locked on Ethereum\u2019s first layer surged 231% in the last 24 hours to $100.31 billion.

Tron gets a share of 6.23%, mostly on stablecoins, while BNB Chain (BNB) and Arbitrum have over 2%.

        "content": "The excitement over spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs has calmed, but a fresh wave of enthusiasm is emerging. Could the prospect of an Ethereum (ETH) ETF propel the crypto market to new heights?\n\nIn the United States, competition is unfolding for supremacy in the exchange-traded fund (ETF) market, with a particular emphasis on prominent crypto assets. While the initial funds, both operational and awaiting regulatory approval, were exclusively linked to Bitcoin, a new wave of ETFs has seized the spotlight. These latest offerings enable investors to speculate on the price movements of ETH, the second-largest cryptocurrency.\n\nWhy does the market need cryptocurrency ETFs?\n\nThe launch of the first ETFs pegged to the price of Ethereum occurred two years following the introduction of the first Bitcoin futures ETF in the United States \u2013 the Bitcoin Strategy ETF from ProShares, with shares traded on exchanges under the ticker BITO. At that time, the launch coincided with the pinnacle of excitement surrounding the crypto market, marked by historical record highs for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The landscape has evolved somewhat since then: the crypto industry is currently grappling with substantial regulatory scrutiny globally, and the trading volume on crypto exchanges has dwindled to its lowest point in three years.\n\nYou might also like: Ethereum ETF becomes most attractive prospect, poll shows\n\nIn the context of the cryptocurrency market, ETFs enable investors to track the price movements of coins without directly owning them. Rather than navigating exchanges and wallets independently, investors can purchase ETF shares through standard brokerage accounts. This investment approach is more prevalent among clients of management companies or pension funds in the United States.\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has given the green light to several Bitcoin ETFs, specifically those based on futures contracts. Unlike spot ETFs, futures ETFs do not offer direct ownership of cryptocurrency and do not entail its delivery (i.e., buying it on the market). Instead, they track futures contracts that forecast their price at a future date. Several market players introduced Ethereum futures funds on October 2, 2023.\n\nProShares, Bitwise, and VanEck, among others, debuted their Ethereum funds after receiving regulatory approval to launch them. A few hours before the opening of the American market and the commencement of fund trading, the price of the ETH cryptocurrency surged by almost 5%. However, during the trading session, it started to decline, and within a day, it had dropped even lower, erasing all the previous gains.\n\nSource: CoinMarketCap\n\nDo we need an Ethereum ETF?\n\nInvestor interest in Ethereum could reignite if its prices recover to previous highs, particularly considering that many prefer Ether to Bitcoin due to numerous options for utilizing its blockchain as infrastructure for various projects and financial services.\n\nBack in May 2023, a few months before the launch of their Ethereum-ETF, VanEck analysts published an extensive report in which they shared the results of a study on the technical component of the Ethereum blockchain and its prospects. Based on their calculations and the rationale for the demand for the ETH cryptocurrency as \u201cfuel\u201d for future infrastructure, they predicted a range of future prices for the coin.\n\nSource: VanEck\n\nAccording to their estimates, by 2030, the price of ETH under the \u201cbase\u201d scenario will be $11,848, and under the \u201cbullish\u201d scenario, the coin will exceed $51,000. Moreover, in the worst-case scenario and with a lack of proper demand, the ETH exchange rate, according to their estimates, may drop to almost $300.\n\nSource: VanEck\n\nWho has applied for Ethereum ETFs?\n\nIn August 2023, crypto asset manager Valkyrie announced the conversion of its Bitcoin futures ETF into a fund that invests in Ethereum futures. At the beginning of October, several market players, including ProShares, Bitwise, and VanEck, launched futures ETFs on Ethereum.\n\nIn September 2023, entrepreneur Cathie Wood\u2019s Ark Invest also applied for a spot Ethereum ETF.\n\nIn November 2023, the world\u2019s largest investment firm, BlackRock, filed with the SEC to list a spot ETF on Ethereum.\n\nYou might also like: SEC postpones decision on Grayscale\u2019s application for spot Ethereum ETF\n\nWill applications for spot Ethereum ETFs be approved?\n\n\n\nAnalysts believe that spot Ethereum ETFs could also be approved within a year. Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas said he does not see a scenario in which Bitcoin ETFs will be authorized but Ethereum ETFs will not.\n\nThe expert added that he estimates the likelihood that the SEC will approve spot Ethereum ETFs before May is 70%. Lawyer Joe Carlasar believes the agency will do this before the end of the year, but \u201cthe process will take longer than people expect.\u201d\n\nBloomberg analyst James Seyffart is confident that the SEC will \u201cgive the green light\u201d to spot Ethereum ETFs. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink is now expecting the launch of spot ETH ETFs.\n\nHowever, SEC Chair Gary Gensler is exercising caution on Ethereum. While acknowledging the approval of Bitcoin ETFs, he emphasized that this was specific to Bitcoin as a non-security commodity token.\n\nYou might also like: SEC postpones deadline for decision on Invesco Galaxy spot Ethereum ETF\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nThe rollout of Ethereum layer-2 scaling network Blast hasn\u2019t been without controversy, but even so, users have pumped the project with more than $1.3 billion in search of yield and airdrop rewards. Blast has now launched its test network, and is attempting to bring app developers into its ecosystem with a similar promise of airdropped tokens.\n\nOn Tuesday, Blast announced that its testnet is now live, and that the project is trying to attract developers to start building with the launch of a \u201cBig Bang\u201d competition.\n\nDevelopers who enter their Blast apps into the competition will have the first chance to earn token rewards in the upcoming airdrop, Blast wrote on Twitter, with the winning apps being \u201cpromoted\u201d to the mainnet when it goes live in late February.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBlast founder Tieshun \u201cPacman\u201d Roquerre will judge the contest along with representatives from investors Paradigm and Standard Crypto, among others. Pacman and fellow Blast team members will also offer guidance and mentorship to developers along the way.\n\nThe Blast Testnet is OFFICIALLY LIVE With it, the Blast BIG BANG competition officially begins. Dapps can compete to get in front of 100k users & $1.3B in TVL, connect with top investors, and earn the Blast Airdrop. pic.twitter.com/Cajnmtxtd3 \u2014 Blast (@Blast_L2) January 16, 2024\n\nPacman is also the founder of Blur, the leading NFT marketplace, and Blast\u2019s launch appears to be following much the same strategy as it attempts to leapfrog over existing Ethereum layer-2 networks\u2014that is, by using potentially sizable token incentives.\n\nBlur handed out over $800 million worth of BLUR tokens in 2023 to NFT traders, and the initial round of airdropped tokens in February coincided with the platform topping OpenSea as the most-used marketplace in terms of trading volume.\n\nAccording to a Tuesday tweet thread, blast will hand out half of its total airdrop to users and the other half to developers. On the former front, more than 100,000 total wallets have now locked up over $1.3 billion worth of cryptocurrency to earn \u201cBlast points,\u201d which will eventually convert to airdropped tokens once the Blast mainnet is live.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWith the Big Bang competition and beyond, Blast aims to get decentralized app (dapp) creators to start building to earn a share of the other half of the airdrop.\n\nBlast\u2019s surging deposits and user tally comes following pushback to the platform\u2019s November launch. Crypto users and fellow developers complained about Blast\u2019s approach to launching a bridge to take deposits before the Blast network was actually ready and live, as well as blocking users from withdrawing their funds until the mainnet debuts in February.\n\nParadigm, one of the most prominent backers of both Blast and Blur, took the team to task following the initial launch, with Head of Research and General Partner Dan Robinson tweeting that the announcement \u201ccrossed lines in both messaging and execution.\u201d\n\nEdited by Ryan Ozawa."

        "content": "There has been a steady fall in active validator count on Ethereum since the 4th of January.\n\nETH accumulation persists among coin traders.\n\nThe Ethereum [ETH] Proof-of-Stake (PoS) network has witnessed a sharp drop in active validators, hitting a year-to-date low on the 12th of January, according to data from Glassnode.\n\nAMBCrypto found that the decline began on the 4th of January, the same day that the total number of validators that exited the network\u2019s validator pool voluntarily climbed to an all-time high of 17,821.\n\nThis trend emerged just a day after Matrixport, a prominent crypto investment services provider, predicted a potential rejection of all Bitcoin ETF applications by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nFollowing the report\u2019s publication, the prices of leading assets plummeted, causing over $500 million in liquidations.\n\nMany feared that Matrixport\u2019s predictions might be accurate and result in a severe market decline, hence the surge in the daily count of validators that left the Ethereum network on the 4th of January.\n\nWhile the daily active validator count on the PoS chain has begun to rise, it still sits at low levels recorded in December.\n\nAs of the 14th of January, the active validator count on Ethereum totaled 897,121. Likewise, with the rise in ETH\u2019s price post-ETF approval, voluntary exits from the chain have reduced.\n\nOn the 14th of January, only 124 validators left the network, data from Glassnode showed.\n\nBullish momentum intensifies\n\nAt press time, ETH exchanged hands at $2,517, according to data from CoinMarketCap. The coin\u2019s price has risen by 15% in the last week.\n\nIts price movements assessed on a weekly chart revealed that bullish pressure persisted. This was gleaned from ETH\u2019s momentum indicators, showing that traders have continued accumulating the altcoin.\n\nFor example, the coin\u2019s Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Money Flow Index (MFI) indicators were spotted at 70.37 and 87.02, respectively. These levels suggested that buying pressure exceeded coin sell-offs despite the recent uptick.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nIt is, however, key to note that these RSI and MFI values typically indicate an overheated market. Hence, a minor drawback in ETH\u2019s value should be anticipated.\n\nETH\u2019s Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) remained in an uptrend and positioned above the zero line at press time. Returning a value of 0.16, ETH\u2019s CMF showed a steady supply of liquidity required to sustain a price rally."

        "content": "Staked Ethereum (ETH) withdrawals hit a record high last week.\n\nThe surge appears to be heavily linked to Celsius\u2019 bankruptcy proceedings.\n\nDespite the mass-staked ETH withdrawals, the network impact is expected to be minimal.\n\nOver the past two weeks, the Ethereum (ETH) network has experienced a spike in validator exits. Capping off this trend last week, this surge in validator exits culminated in the network recording over 650,000 ETH in staked ETH withdrawals, the largest amount of redemption in a single week since withdrawals were enabled with the Shanghai upgrade. The record withdrawal begs the question of what is driving this surge.\n\nCelsius Bankruptcy Proceedings at the Helm?\n\nDisclosing last week\u2019s record-staked ETH outflows on Monday, January 15, 21.co researcher Tom Wan shared Dune Analytics data showing that bankrupt crypto lender Celsius and staking service provider Figment were the largest contributors to the withdrawal spike in the past week. Specifically, withdrawals directly attributed to Celsius and Figment accounted for over 85% of staked ETH withdrawals, with 206.9k ETH and 356.4k ETH, respectively.\n\nChart showing staked ETH withdrawals by entity. Source: Tom Wan\n\nWhile the data on face value suggests Figment clients and not Celsius are the primary drivers of the recent surge in staked ETH withdrawals, Wan has previously suggested that the reverse is more likely the case. Wan had noted that Celsius was also a Figment client with at least 197,000 ETH staked through the platform. As such, the analyst suggested that it was likely that the bulk of the ETH being withdrawn by Figment belongs to Celsius.\n\nThe move follows plans revealed by the bankrupt lender earlier in the month to unstake ETH to offset restructuring costs and settle creditors. At the time of writing, Arkham Intelligence data suggests that Celsius holds over 580,000 ETH worth a staggering $1.4 billion at current rates.\n\nUnderstanding The Impact of Celsius\u2019 Staking Withdrawals on Ethereum\n\nCelsius\u2019s staked ETH withdrawals are unlikely to cause dire consequences for the Ethereum network aside from increasing the unstaking wait time due to Ethereum\u2019s \u201cchurn limit,\u201d which limits the number of validators that can exit or enter the network to 2,925 per day.\n\nDespite technically reducing the validator count and amount of ETH securing the network, the Ethereum staking contract still holds over 36 million ETH, per Etherscan data at the time of writing.\n\nAt the same time, while Celsius\u2019 bankruptcy proceedings place selling pressure on the price of ETH, the firm is unlikely to unload its holdings all at once as it would also impact the value of its holdings.\n\nAmid the looming selling pressure, ETH\u2019s price continues to hold steady. ETH is trading over $2,500 at the time of writing, up over 10% in the past seven days per CoinMarketCap data.\n\nETH/USD 4-hour candle chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe asset has seen increased attention as market participants speculate that the U.S. SEC is set to approve spot Ethereum ETFs after issuing approvals for similar products backed by Bitcoin. Amid the asset\u2019s strong showing, analysts like \u201cIncomeSharks\u201d have tipped ETH to surge above the $3,500 price point.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nDespite last week\u2019s record withdrawal, the Ethereum staking contract still holds over 36 million ETH.\n\nDue to potential adverse price effects, Celsius will unlikely dump all its ETH holdings at once.\n\nCelsius is not the only bankrupt crypto firm putting selling pressure on the price of ETH. FTX and Alameda have also unloaded ETH holdings to settle creditors in the past week.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nWith staked ETH withdrawals reaching record highs, it is necessary to understand what is driving the surge and whether it is a cause for panic.\n\nRead this for more on the recent surge in Ethereum validator exits and its impact on the network:\n\nEthereum Validator Exit Leads to Backlogged Queue on Network\n\n\n\nLearn more about the recent allegations facing the Polygon Foundation:\n\nPolygon Foundation Faces 400M MATIC Misappropriation Claims"

        "content": "The native utility token of a South Korean Ethereum (ETH) rival is rallying after news of a new blockchain merger proposal.\n\nLayer-2 smart contract platform Klaytn (KLAY) leaped from a 24-hour-low of $0.189 to a high of $0.262, a 39% gain, following the announced proposal of a merger to create \u201cAsia\u2019s leading blockchain system.\u201d\n\nKLAY has since stabilized and consolidated, trading for $0.219 at time of writing, still up nearly 17% in the last 24 hours.\n\nKlaytn is a public blockchain platform aiming to provide a user-friendly interface and experience. Klaytn is owned by South Korean internet and mobile provider Kakao. KLAY is the native token and medium of exchange within Klaytn\u2019s blockchain ecosystem, used to pay transaction fees and staking.\n\nEarlier today, Klaytn and Finschia, an independent non-profit aimed at expanding Web3 and blockchain technologies, announced a joint proposal to merge blockchains.\n\n\u201cKlaytn Foundation, established to build and decentralize the ecosystem of South Korea\u2019s leading Layer 1 blockchain Klaytn, has teamed up with Finschia Foundation, the operator of the Finschia blockchain developed by LINE Tech Plus, to propose the merger of the two existing blockchains into a new mainnet. The two blockchain foundations will submit the integration proposal to their respective governance members today to open up the proposal for discussion, and voting will take place from 26 January to 2 February 2024.\u201d\n\nAccording to the announcement, the merger will aim to consolidate blockchains and combine the blockchains\u2019 strengths, all while simultaneously creating Asia\u2019s largest blockchain ecosystem.\n\n\u201cThe proposal aims to create a new industry leader with a technologically superior blockchain that supports both EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) and CosmWasm, as well as one of the largest ecosystems of DApps (decentralized applications) and users in Asia. The two foundations will also merge into one organization, combining their technology, services, and business networks which include Kakao, LINE, and many other strategic partners.\u201d\n\nAccording to the proposal, holders of Klaytn and Finschia\u2019s native tokens, KLAY and FNSA, will be able to swap out their old tokens for new native tokens once they are issued.\n\n\u201cDrawing on the combined experience of both foundations, the proposed tokenomics for this new native coin will focus heavily on delivering sustainable value creation. This will be achieved via a lower base inflation rate and a three-layer burning model designed to drive the coin towards deflation as network activity increases.\u201d\n\nThe proposed merger also promises to enhance the blockchain\u2019s level of decentralization, modes of governance, and interoperability with other blockchains.\n\n\u201cWe are excited to be taking the first step toward unlocking the enormous synergy of merging the public blockchains started by Kakao and LINE, which are both leading IT companies in Asia. We will give our best to make this merge an opportunity to innovate and lead the Asian blockchain industry in both technology and adoption.\u201d\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "title": "Ethereum ETFs in Focus As Spot Bitcoin Funds Launch - etf.com",
        "content": "Michael Jordan of the championship Chicago Bulls had Scottie Pippen. Warren Buffett had the late, great Charlie Munger. And bitcoin has ethereum.\n\nWhile the two cryptocurrencies are only related through their connection to the blockchain, these best-known crypto stars are getting more attention than ever. That\u2019s saying something, given how investors have flocked to crypto\u2014especially since the pandemic in 2020.\n\nWith the two most notable \u201ccoins,\u201d the main difference is how ethereum takes bitcoin\u2019s role a step further. Both use the digital ledger known as blockchain, which allows for financial transactions outside of the purview of governments and banks. But ethereum, which launched about ten years ago (and roughly five years after bitcoin) consists of a network designed to build decentralized applications, while bitcoin is closer to a \u201cdigital asset.\u201d\n\nBy way of analogy, it\u2019s the difference between a jewelry store selling gold and the gold itself. Ethereum transactions include executable code that serves as a mechanism to arrange digital contracts between parties. Also, each block on the ethereum network takes a fraction of the time to create compared to that same process on the bitcoin network.\n\nSo now that spot bitcoin ETFs have listed on U.S. stock exchanges (11 of them initially on Jan. 11), will ethereum come next? Wall Street is already chattering about this and a recent surge in ethereum\u2019s price was likely based on that assumption. But as with bitcoin, investors do not have to wait until spot \u201cether\u201d is available in ETF form. Existing ETFs get investors most of the way there.\n\nEthereum Futures ETFs Seek Spot Status\n\nThe dominant player in this area currently is the $7.6 billion Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE), which debuted in December 2017.\n\nLet's be careful because it's a trust traded over-the-counter and not technically an exchange-traded fund. Still, it's seeking to convert to a spot ethereum fund so it bears mentioning.\n\nWith an expense ratio of 2.50%, astronomical for the ETF world, ETHE has \u201cde-fied\u201d (pun intended) the odds. Or has it? ETF investors have been eager to get their hands on anything crypto these past few years. In addition, ETHE currently trades at a discount of 15% compared to the spot price of ethereum, according to YCharts data. This further makes a case where investors would rather own a diluted version of the real thing than nothing at all. Bitcoin presents a similar situation.\n\nOther competitors in the \u201cnot spot ethereum but similar to it\u201d category include the ProShares Ether Strategy ETF (EETH), the VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF (EFUT) and the Bitwise Ethereum Strategy ETF (AETH). That trio holds assets of $19.7 million, $18.4 million and $2.6 million respectively, though all have been around just a few months. However, they also have much lower expense ratios.\n\nSince October 2023, ETHE has been a runaway train, having nearly doubled, while the others are \u201conly\u201d up 19% or more. So far in 2024, ETHE is up 9%, about the same as the three much smaller but much less costly peers.\n\nEthereum to Follow Bitcoin?\n\nAll this could prove moot if the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission treats ethereum exchange-traded products as it did those related to bitcoin\u2014with skepticism and stonewalling. But don\u2019t rule out a bonanza. While spot Bitcoin ETFs are currently the toast of the financial services industry, the fever could potentially spread to ethereum and many of the less commonly used but emerging crypto asset types.\n\nShould that occur, the only prescription won\u2019t be, as the iconic line from Saturday Night Live sketch goes, \u201cmore cowbell.\u201d It will be\u2014yikes!\u2014more ETF industry employees and regulators."

        "content": "Amidst a volatile crypto market, Ethereum (ETH) is gaining momentum, outperforming its long-time rival Bitcoin (BTC). According to Kaiko data, the ETH/BTC ratio has steadily risen, rebounding from multi-year lows.\n\nETH/BTC Ratio Rising, ETH Momentum Building\n\nThe ETH/BTC ratio technically gauges market sentiment towards these two leading crypto. The recent rebound indicates investors are increasingly bullish on Ethereum\u2019s potential relative to Bitcoin.\n\nThis upward trajectory is fueled by growing optimism surrounding the potential approval of spot Ethereum ETFs and the general confidence that markets will trend higher in 2024. The prospect of this product entering the market has also injected fresh energy into the ETH ecosystem, lifting the second most valuable coin by market cap.\n\nRelated Reading: Institutional Inflows Into XRP Surges 244% Amid ETF Speculation\n\nAfter protracted lower lows, the ETH/BTC ratio began rising immediately after the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs last week. This unexpected shift, analysts observe, is primarily because of increasing confidence in the SEC approving a similar product for ETH.\n\nSpot Ethereum ETFs, which would provide direct exposure to the Ethereum market, would make it easier for institutional investors to benefit from the volatility of ETH. So far, the SEC has approved an Ethereum Futures ETF, which, unlike the spot ETF, tracks an index, not the direct price of this asset.\n\nBlackrock is among the leading Wall Street giants interested in issuing a spot Ethereum ETF. Considering its history of success, the decision by one of the world\u2019s leading asset managers to apply for this product is an endorsement of its prospects. Earlier, Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock, said Ethereum, despite its scaling challenge, might spearhead the tokenization drive in the years ahead.\n\nUS SEC Yet To Clarify Whether Ethereum Is A Commodity Or Security\n\nEven so, the SEC has yet to clarify whether ETH, a coin pre-mined with some assets distributed to the Ethereum Foundation, is a commodity like Bitcoin. Earlier, Gary Gensler, the chairperson of the SEC, was cornered by the United States policymakers to give the agency\u2019s stand on the coin but didn\u2019t.\n\nNonetheless, with the prospect of spotting Ethereum ETFs and the dominance of Ethereum in decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), ETH will likely continue outperforming BTC in the coming months. Price action data shows that ETH is already up 20% versus BTC in the past trading week.\n\nFeature image from Canva, chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Nayms, the leading blockchain-based marketplace for alternative risk transfer and capitalization, has announced its successful launch on Base, a secure and low-cost Ethereum layer-2 solution. This collaboration aims to provide investors with streamlined access to tokenized (re)insurance opportunities, revolutionizing the insurance industry by leveraging blockchain technology.\n\nBuilding on the success of its initial investment offerings, Nayms continues to innovate in reshaping the insurance landscape. The first product launched on Base is an Industry Loss Warranty (ILW) contract, specifically reinsuring against weather-related catastrophic events in Florida. Institutional investors can now earn yield on their capital within a Bermuda-regulated segregated account structure. The target returns range from mid to high teens, paid through (re)insurance premiums by real (re)insureds seeking risk coverage. Early investors can also enjoy an additional reward of NAYM tokens, equivalent to up to 15% of their invested capital.\n\nTokenization emerges as a pivotal element in the evolving insurance sector, providing institutional investors with a unique avenue to diversify their portfolios. Nayms\u2019 tokenized offerings span (re)insurance for property and casualty (P&C) risks, including Cyber, Errors and Omissions, Directors and Officers coverage, crime/specie, and various Industry Loss Warranty products. This level of exposure, traditionally limited to major institutional investors, is now accessible to all qualified investors through tokenization.\n\nKey benefits of tokenized (re)insurance exposure for qualified investors include diversification of returns from the broader crypto market, access to historically challenging private markets now in a tokenized wrapper, high-yield returns with liquidity and low volatility, and the safety and security of the decentralized Ethereum network at a low cost, with faster settlement times through Base Layer 2.\n\nNayms\u2019 Co-Founder and CTO, Ted Georgas, expressed enthusiasm about the Base launch, stating, \u201cWe are excited to be launching on Base, our first Ethereum Layer 2 network. Our deployment was seamless as it is fully EVM compliant, and we look forward to leveraging the reduced fees and easy onramp that Base provides.\u201d\n\nThe ILW market targeted by Nayms is a crucial segment of the global catastrophe reinsurance market, generating over $300 billion in annual renewal premiums. Nayms\u2019 ILW introduces an innovative approach by safeguarding buyers against named windstorms in Florida, requiring two independent storms to each cause damage exceeding $10 billion to trigger indemnification during the 2024 in-force period.

        "content": "After the approval of the 11 Spot Bitcoin ETFs, the Bitcoin (BTC) price shot up significantly, nearing $49,000. However, subsequently, the oldest crypto witnessed a bearish turn, now trading at around $43,000. Amid the declines, a crypto analyst sold off a substantial share of his Bitcoin holdings to acquire Ethereum (ETH).\n\nWhy did the crypto analyst sell Bitcoin for Ethereum?\n\nIn a recent video, Crypto Rover, a popular crypto analyst on YouTube and X, stated that he is considering a significant Bitcoin selloff to invest in Ethereum. Additionally, he noted that ETH has a better upside than BTC. He linked this to the upcoming Spot Ethereum ETFs that are expected to launch in four months.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe analyst added that a major Ethereum upgrade is also slated for launch in the next four months. Hence, he expects the coupled impact of both these events to propel the Ethereum price up unprecedentedly. Whilst, he noted that last week, he began selling off Bitcoin when it neared the $49,000 mark.\n\nFurthermore, Rover underscored that Bitcoin has registered over $200 million in short liquidations. He noted that Bitcoin tends to grab the liquidity before significant chart movements. Hence, he expects the BTC price to surge past $43,500 before a notable correction.\n\nMoreover, he added that the surge could be extended to $44,500 prior to the anticipated declines. In addition, the analyst stated that he will place buy orders for BTC when the price falls around $39,750, indicating a massive correction. However, he also noted that if Bitcoin breaks the resistance at $44,500 and sustains over it, a massive surge could follow.\n\nAlso Read: Arthur Hayes Expects Hong Kong To Hinder Bitcoin ETF Adoption In West\n\nBTC Price Today\n\nThe Bitcoin price slumped significantly after attaining a high of $48,969.37 last week. Moreover, it has since experienced significant declines despite attempts to rebound. It retraced the $43,500 mark but faced a rejection.\n\nAt press time, the BTC price witnessed a dip of 0.15% to $42,778.53 on Tuesday, January 16. Whilst, the crypto holds a market cap of 838.70 billion, down by 0.14%. In addition, the 24-hour trade volume dropped by 1.69% to $20.90 billion.\n\nAlso Read: BlackRock CEO Backs Ethereum ETF After Bitcoin Success"

        "content": "Share this article URL Copied\n\nEthereum\u2019s layer-two (L2) blockchain Manta Pacific registered more than $850 million in total value locked (TVL) today, and it is now the 4th largest L2 by TVL, according to data aggregator L2Beat. When compared to the $35 million in TVL on December 15, 2023, this represents more than 2,300% in monthly growth.\n\nThe relevant rise in TVL can be related to Manta\u2019s New Paradigm campaign, which started last year on December 14 and gave rewards to users who bridged Ethereum (ETH) to Manta Pacific. The rewards are \u2018box pieces\u2019 and when a user gets 25 of them, he\u2019s eligible to open a box and get a non-fungible token (NFT). Inviting friends with referral links also boosted the rewards.\n\nManta Pacific is a blockchain ecosystem built by Manta Network on Ethereum. It leverages Polygon\u2019s zkEVM technology and uses Celestia, a modular blockchain, as its data availability layer. This architecture enables Manta Pacific to function as a zero-knowledge rollup (zk rollup) for Ethereum, offering scalability and privacy benefits.\n\nSince the start of the campaign, Manta\u2019s TVL has soared and reached an $870 million peak on January 12. However, this number could sharply decline after January 18, when users will be eligible to claim their rewards after participating in the New Paradigm campaign.\n\nA blog post published by Manta\u2019s team on January 15 reveals that 50 million MANTA tokens will be distributed to New Paradigm\u2019s participants. Another 50 million MANTA will be airdropped to users who interacted with the \u2018Into the Blue\u2019 event, which was similar to New Paradigm\u2019s proposal.\n\nThe value locked growth was not accompanied by a rise in activity and could be seen as a sign that the money flowing into Manta Pacific is coming from investors only interested in the airdrop.\n\nThus, the token distribution could be seen by investors as the end of the period when it\u2019s mandatory to lock ETH in Manta Pacific. Since 2024 is seen as \u2018airdrop season\u2019 by analysts, as Crypto Briefing reported, the money could quickly flow to other protocols where staking crypto is an eligibility requirement."

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nVitalik Buterin has stepped into the ongoing conversation about rollups, offering a fresh perspective on how they interact with external data chains. This update comes at a time when the Ethereum community is deeply engaged in discussions about the architecture and security of layer-2 solutions.\n\nRollups in new light\n\nAt the heart of Buterin's intervention is the distinction between traditional Ethereum rollups and the \"Validium\" solution.\n\nIn a nuanced take, Buterin explained that when an Ethereum rollup uses an external data chain for data availability (DA), it transitions into a validium. This represents a shift from the earlier understanding, where Ethereum's layer-2 solutions were almost exclusively equated with rollups. Central to Buterin's explanation is the concept of an \"unconditional security guarantee,\" a hallmark of rollups that ensures users' assets are retrievable under any circumstances.\n\nHowever, this level of security may not be as robust when an external DA system is in play. Nonetheless, Buterin sees a place for validiums, suggesting that with robust distributed DA systems, they can offer a significant boost to an application's practical security.\n\nDiverse views from Ethereum community\n\nThe Ethereum community has engaged in a lively debate over the nuances of this new direction. Discussions have revolved around the implications of using various external chains, such as Celestia, as DA layers, and how these choices impact the classification of a project as a layer-2 solution.\n\nSome community members pointed out that the integration of external chains adds complexity to the layer-2 landscape and could potentially overlook the unique attributes of each solution.\n\nThere is also a concern that the security of modular blockchain systems could be compromised if any component, like the DA or execution layer, is weak.\n\nDespite these concerns, others in the community believe that categorizing these solutions as \"layer 2\" remains effective for communication purposes, especially when they use Ethereum's layer 1 for security and settlement."

        "content": "In a move that solidifies Manta Pacific\u2019s dominance in the industry, Binance recently introduced MANTA as its 44th project on the Launchpool.\n\nIn a recent development, Manta Pacific, the native layer 2 of Manta Network, has emerged as the fourth-largest scaling solution, surpassing Coinbase\u2019s Base, according to data from L2Beat.\n\nManta Pacific\u2019s Rise to Prominence\n\nThe Total Value Locked (TVL) on Manta Pacific currently stands at an impressive $850 million, leaving Base behind at $756 million. This shift in rankings highlights the growing prominence of Manta Pacific in the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) space. Layer 2 solutions, such as Manta Pacific, are secondary blockchains built atop primary or native blockchains to mitigate congestion issues, enhance speed, and facilitate smoother transactions.\n\nTotal Value Locked (TVL) serves as a crucial metric in gauging the popularity of DeFi protocols. It represents the notional value of tokens deposited within a protocol, reflecting user engagement and the overall health of the platform.\n\nNotably, L2Beat\u2019s TVL methodology considers the dollar value of tokens canonically bridged, externally bridged, and natively minted. In contrast, DeFiLlama, another reputable source, focuses solely on assets actively engaged in decentralized applications. According to DeFiLlama, Manta and Base are in a tight contest for the ninth spot, both boasting a TVL of approximately $420 million.\n\nLast year, Manta Pacific transitioned to a zero-knowledge rollup, leveraging zero-knowledge proofs, a cryptographic technique that gained prominence in 2023 for its ability to ensure rapid transaction settlement, also known as \u201cfinality.\u201d This technological advancement has contributed to Manta Pacific\u2019s success and its ascent in the scaling solution hierarchy.\n\nAdditionally, Manta Pacific\u2019s paradigm bridging program, launched in December, played a pivotal role in the platform\u2019s accelerated growth. Bridging involves transferring assets from one blockchain to another, and Manta Pacific incentivizes users by offering rewards for bridging Ethereum (ETH) and USD Coin (USDC) to its network. The layer 2 solution adopts a strategy reminiscent of Ethereum layer 2 Blast, as noted by Michael Nadeau, founder of the DeFi report.\n\nUsers bridging ETH and USDC to Manta Pacific enjoy a staking yield ranging from 4% to 5%, with their coins locked for a duration of 69 days. Depositors are also eligible for future airdrops of MANTA tokens. The program further offers NFT box pieces to depositors, and staked ETH can be re-staked on the Eigen Layer protocol.\n\nBinance Embraces Manta\n\nIn a move that solidifies Manta Pacific\u2019s dominance in the industry, Binance recently introduced MANTA as its 44th project on the Launchpool.\n\nThis integration allows Binance users to earn MANTA tokens by staking their BNB and FDUSD tokens. The addition of Manta to the Binance ecosystem introduces a modular Layer 2 solution tailored for Zero-Knowledge (ZK) applications. The Launchpool initiative, which began on Monday spans two days and enables users to farm MANTA tokens.\n\nAs Manta Pacific continues to gain traction and secure its position in the scaling solution landscape, the crypto community eagerly awaits further developments and innovations from this project in the DeFi space."

        "content": "Press Releases are sponsored content and not a part of Finbold's editorial content. For a full disclaimer, please click here. If you encounter any issues, kindly report them to [email protected]. Crypto assets/products can be highly risky. Never invest unless you\u2019re prepared to lose all the money you invest.\n\nInvestors are constantly on the lookout for the next big opportunity that promises substantial returns. Ethereum (ETH) has long been regarded as the pioneer, revolutionizing the blockchain space with its introduction of smart contracts and the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). However, in recent times, a new player has emerged on the scene \u2013 Retik Finance (RETIK), touted by many as the giant poised to deliver better returns in 2024.\n\nEthereum (ETH) \u2013 A Trailblazer in Blockchain Technology\n\nEthereum, often referred to as the \u201cworld computer,\u201d has been a driving force behind the adoption and development of decentralized applications (DApps) and smart contracts. Its compatibility with the EVM has fostered a robust ecosystem of tokens and projects. Despite its success, Ethereum faces significant challenges.\n\nETH\u2019s Scalability Issues and High Gas Fees\n\nOne of the major hurdles Ethereum grapples with is scalability. As the popularity of the platform has surged, scalability issues have led to network congestion and higher transaction costs. High gas fees, the cost associated with processing transactions on the Ethereum network, have been a point of concern for users and developers alike. These challenges have prompted a search for alternative solutions within the crypto community.\n\nRetik Finance (RETIK) \u2013 A Rising Star in DeFi\n\nEnter Retik Finance \u2013 a decentralized finance (DeFi) project that aims to address the limitations of existing platforms. Retik Finance has quickly gained attention for its innovative approach, leveraging cutting-edge technology to enhance scalability, reduce transaction costs, and provide a seamless user experience. At its core, Retik Finance is designed to be a community-driven platform, allowing users to actively participate in governance and decision-making processes.\n\nRetik Finance distinguishes itself by focusing on scalability solutions. In a bid to overcome the scalability challenges faced by Ethereum, Retik Finance employs innovative technologies that enhance transaction throughput. This approach not only addresses the limitations of existing platforms but also positions Retik Finance as a potential disruptor in the DeFi space. Moreover, Retik Finance places a strong emphasis on community governance. Users have a significant role in shaping the direction of the platform, fostering a sense of ownership and inclusivity. This community-driven approach sets Retik Finance apart from more traditional, centralized financial systems. One of the significant draws of Retik Finance is its commitment to lowering transaction costs. By minimizing the fees associated with transactions, Retik Finance aims to make DeFi more accessible to a wider audience. This aligns with the broader goal of democratizing finance and ensuring that financial services are not only decentralized but also cost-effective for users.\n\nThe exceptional fundraising achievements of Retik Finance underscore the project\u2019s widespread appeal and investor confidence. Raising $1 million in just nine days and subsequently attracting almost $6 million in less than a month is a testament to the project\u2019s compelling value proposition and the community\u2019s belief in its success. The presale model, featuring 10 stages with incremental token prices, has created a sense of urgency and exclusivity for early investors. Starting at an attractive price of $0.03 in the first stage and gradually increasing, the presale structure incentivizes early participation, allowing supporters to secure tokens at more favorable rates. In parallel, Retik Finance\u2019s mega $333K Giveaway adds an extra layer of excitement to the project. The chance for users to become one of the 10 winners, each receiving $33,300 worth of RETIK, adds a dynamic and engaging element to the platform\u2019s community-building efforts.\n\nEthereum vs. Retik Finance \u2013 Which Will Give Better Returns in 2024?\n\nEthereum\u2019s long-standing dominance is evident. However, increasing competition from other blockchains and layer 2 solutions poses a threat to its continued supremacy. Ethereum 2.0, an upcoming upgrade, aims to address scalability concerns by shifting to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. The success of this upgrade will play a crucial role in determining Ethereum\u2019s trajectory in the years to come. On the other hand, Retik Finance is positioned as an emerging player with the potential to capture market share by providing innovative solutions to existing problems. Strategic partnerships and collaborations can further propel Retik Finance into the spotlight, attracting both users and developers looking for alternatives to traditional financial systems. Ethereum\u2019s historical performance has been marked by periods of significant growth, often influenced by technical developments such as network upgrades. The anticipation and reaction of the market to these upgrades play a pivotal role in determining Ethereum\u2019s price trajectory. Retik Finance, as a newer entrant, presents a different dynamic. Its potential for growth is driven by technological advancements and the support it receives from the community. However, investing in a newer project comes with inherent risks, and investors must weigh these risks against the potential rewards. As we enter into the future of cryptocurrency in 2024, Retik Finance stands as a promising project in the arena. Its commitment to addressing scalability issues, reducing transaction costs, and fostering a community-driven ecosystem positions Retik Finance as a potential giant poised to deliver superior returns. While Ethereum has solidified its place in the history of blockchain technology, the competitive landscape is evolving, and investors must carefully consider the strengths and weaknesses of both Ethereum and Retik Finance to make informed decisions in this dynamic market. The journey ahead promises exciting developments, and the stage is set for Retik Finance to make a significant impact in the years to come.\n\nAbout Retik Finance\n\nRetik Finance (RETIK) is a cutting-edge decentralized finance (DeFi) project revolutionizing global transactions with its innovative suite of financial solutions.

The financial and market information provided on U.Today is intended for informational purposes only. U.Today is not liable for any financial losses incurred while trading cryptocurrencies. Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nShiba Inu currently displays an ascending triangle pattern on the SHIB/USDT chart. This technical formation is widely recognized and could be a signal to a significant price surge for the meme.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAn ascending triangle is characterized by a flat upper resistance line and a rising lower support line. This pattern suggests that buyers are gradually gaining ground against sellers, as each dip is bought up at a higher level than the previous one, indicating accumulating pressure for an upward breakout.\n\nSHIB/USDT Chart by TradingView\n\nFor Shiba Inu, which has been lingering in a period of relatively nonexistent activity, this pattern could serve as massive fuel for volatility in the near future. Recent market conditions have seen a decline in interest toward legacy meme coins, with SHIB being no exception. The lack of significant developments within the Shiba Inu network has contributed to the muted activity around this cryptocurrency.\n\nIn contrast, the majority of the action in the meme coin sector has been taking place on the Solana network. This platform has become a hotbed for the deployment of new meme coins, which are exhibiting far greater volatility than those on the Ethereum network, where Shiba Inu resides. The brisk activity on Solana contrasts sharply with the sluggishness observed in Ethereum's meme coin space, drawing in traders and investors looking for quick gains and high excitement.\n\nEthereum's correction is temporary\n\nThe Ethereum market is currently exhibiting a correction, and there are patterns that suggest a rally may not only be on the horizon but could also be in continuation. The asset has recently experienced a sharp downturn, movement that is readily apparent on intraday timeframes. However, such stark movements are often precursors to reversals, signaling that Ethereum could be gearing up for an upswing.\n\nA closer look at the charts shows Ethereum's price action respecting a series of key technical indicators which, together, build a case for potential upward momentum. The asset has been tracing back to touch base with its moving averages, a behavior that is typically followed by a rebound, as these levels can act as dynamic support zones.\n\nThis corrective phase is noteworthy, especially considering the robust rally Ethereum enjoyed in the preceding weeks. Corrections are a natural and healthy part of any asset's price trajectory, allowing for consolidation before the next leg up. For Ethereum, the current pullback could be shaking out weak hands, setting the stage for a stronger rally propelled by a more committed investor base.\n\nBitcoin's dominance not going anywhere\n\nAfter a brief breach below the 50-day EMA \u2014 a critical indicator of medium-term market sentiment \u2014 Bitcoin has clawed its way back above this pivotal level. This move indicates a bullish signal for market observers, suggesting that Bitcoin is not yet ready to relinquish its market dominance.\n\nHowever, the ascent above the 50 EMA has not been met with the kind of vigorous momentum that bulls would hope for. The growth has been moderate, hinting that Bitcoin might encounter selling pressure as it ascends. This is not unusual on the crypto markets, where significant moves often face immediate resistance as traders take profits and skeptics cast doubts.\n\nThe recent price action has been a roller coaster for Bitcoin, which saw its value tumble from highs around $47,000 to lows near $41,000. This downturn briefly shifted the spotlight to altcoins, which seized the moment to stage local rallies. The diversification of gains across the crypto spectrum during Bitcoin's periods of weakness is a trend that has become more pronounced as the overall market matures.\n\nYet Bitcoin's ability to push back above the 50 EMA serves as a reminder of its underlying strength and the confidence investors have placed in it. Despite the opportunity for altcoins to rise, Bitcoin remains the anchor of the crypto market, with its moves often dictating broader market sentiment. This recent rebound above a crucial technical level could be interpreted as Bitcoin's silent assertion that it is not ready to give up the throne just yet."

        "title": "ETH Still Bullish Despite Drop to $2.5K, What\u2019s the Next Target? (Ethereum Price Analysis) - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s price has encountered a substantial obstacle following a significant surge last week.\n\nThe market is currently correcting, and traders are wondering whether a reversal is on the horizon.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nBy TradingRage\n\nEthereum Price Analysis: The Daily Chart\n\nOn the daily chart, the price has been very bullish over the last quarter of 2023, increasing by more than $1,000. Recently, ETH has experienced an aggressive rally toward the $2,700 resistance zone. However, this level has decisively rejected the price, and a correction toward the $2,400 area has begun.\n\nMeanwhile, the Relative Strength Index still demonstrates values above 50%, indicating that the momentum is still bullish and the price is likely to continue its uptrend after the correction is done.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart\n\nLooking at the 4-hour chart, it is clear that ETH\u2019s price has formed a double-top pattern at the $2,700 resistance level. The relative strength index also signaled that the asset is overbought in this timeframe.\n\nCurrently, the price is forming lower highs and lows, potentially targeting the $2,400 level in the short term. Yet, this level seems likely to hold the price and initiate a rebound back toward the $2,700 level afterward, as the overall market structure is still bullish.\n\nSentiment Analysis\n\nBy TradingRage\n\nEthereum Open Interest\n\nWhile Ethereum\u2019s price is still continuing its bullish trend, some worrying signs are arising from the derivatives market. It is beneficial to have a closer look to determine whether a bearish reversal can be expected or not.\n\nThis chart depicts the Taker Buy Sell Ratio, one of the most valuable metrics for futures market sentiment evaluation. Values over 1 indicate that the bulls are executing their orders more aggressively, while values below 1 point to the bearish selling pressure.\n\nWhile the Taker Buy Sell Ratio has never recovered above one during the recent uptrend, the price has been rallying higher. However, it is currently dropping rapidly, making a new low. This cannot be interpreted well, and the subsequent aggressive selling pressure by the futures trader can soon cause a considerable decline in price."

        "content": "EigenLayer\u2019s weekly ETH deposits doubled.\n\nEigenLayer\u2019s total value locked (TVL) soared to $1.67 billion at press time.\n\nWhile spot ETFs, real-world assets (RWA), layer-2 solutions, and other popular narratives dominate crypto-related talks these days, slowly but surely a lesser-known category was catching up \u2013 Ethereum [ETH] restaking protocols.\n\nIncrease in native ETH on restaking protocols\n\nA significant increase in native ETH deposits into restaking protocols was observed over the last week, according to on-chain analytics firm TK Research.\n\nAs per the post dated 15th of January, the biggest beneficiary was EigenLayer, with a weekly boost of 168K ETH, more than doubling from the previous week.\n\nEtherFi came a distant second with an influx of 14.45K ETH, marking an increase of nearly 28%. Renzo Protocol witnessed a jump of 4.5K ETH, equating to an impressive 55% rise.\n\nCombined, the three protocols attracted around 186.5K ETH in deposits. As per prevailing market prices, this amounted more than $470 million of ETH locked into premier restaking projects.\n\nA relatively young concept, restaking allows ETH stakers to participate in validating new software modules developed on top of the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nPut simply, the same ETH staked on the Ethereum network can be repurposed to extend security to other applications. The security, therefore, gets shared across the ecosystem.\n\nNote that apart from staking ETH natively, validators also have an option of staking liquid derivatives (LSDs) from Lido, Rocket Pool, and Coinbase.\n\nMoreover, validators earn extra yield in return as the staked ETH is used for securing additional applications.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nEigenLayer leads the away\n\nEigenLayer, the largest restaking protocol, saw a sharp surge in deposits since its mainnet launch in June last year. However, the growth has been meteoric over the past month. Total value locked (TVL) logged a 6x jump to $1.67 billion.\n\nThe surge followed a raise in the protocol\u2019s restaking limit to 500,000 ETH from the previous 120,000 ETH."

        "content": "In an unexpected turn of events today, self-proclaimed Satoshi Nakamoto Craig Wright took a swipe at Ethereum's creator, Vitalik Buterin. Wright revisited a series of posts by Buterin in 2017, where he discussed the early versions of the Ethereum protocol.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBack then, Buterin had responded to a question about the possibility of building Ethereum on top of Bitcoin, expressing concerns about potential conflicts with Bitcoin's development team. He cited fears that protocol rules might change, making it difficult for him to build on a base protocol at odds with his vision.\n\nFast forward to January 2024, and Wright seized the opportunity to comment on Buterin's past remarks. He argued that Ethereum only exists due to centralized development teams that have the power to alter the protocol. Wright mused about the hypothetical scenario of having everything built on Bitcoin, envisioning a more streamlined and less fragmented system.\n\nETH only exists because centralised development teams who are centralised as they can change the protocol. https://t.co/6RPBmlKniX \u2014 Dr Craig S Wright (@Dr_CSWright) January 16, 2024\n\nBitcoin v. Ethereum\n\nWright's comments add fuel to the longstanding rivalry between Bitcoin and Ethereum, highlighting fundamental differences in their approaches to decentralization and protocol governance.\n\nWhile Ethereum has achieved considerable success as a platform for smart contracts and applications, Wright argues for the stability and originality of Bitcoin's protocol.\n\nMoreover, it revives the centralization debate in both cryptocurrency ecosystems. On the one side is OFAC's censorship of ETH transactions; on the other side is the enormous concentration of BTC in the hands of whales and miners."

        "title": "An Introduction to ERC-4337 (Account Abstraction) Standard - Unchained - Unchained",
        "content": "The new ERC-4337 token standard enables account abstraction for Ethereum users, allowing for the creation of easier-to-use \u201csmart wallets.\u201d\n\nA significant impediment to crypto adoption is the complexity of account management. But that could soon be a thing of the past, thanks to Ethereum\u2019s newest token standard, ERC-4337.\n\nThis guide will explain what ERC-4337 is, how it works, and its significance to the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nWhat Is the ERC-4337 Token Standard?\n\nERC-4337 is an account abstraction standard for the Ethereum blockchain, seeking to improve user experience and security by introducing smart contract functionality in wallets.\n\nThe standard is Vitalik Buterin\u2019s and other developers\u2019 brainchild, conceptualized in 2021.\n\nWhat Is Account Abstraction?\n\nIn most blockchain systems, users manage their transactions through Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs). These accounts require them to own private keys and use them to process each transaction, creating challenges such as security risks, limited functionality, and usage complexity.\n\nTo address these challenges, Ethereum is adopting account abstraction.\n\nThis blockchain concept shifts user transactions away from exclusive dependence on EOAs. Instead, it embeds smart contracts in users\u2019 wallets, allowing them to interact with other contracts and thus complete exchanges automatically.\n\nBesides automating transactions, these \u201csmart wallets\u201d can determine the appropriate gas fees a user should incur in each exchange. They also support advanced security features, as we shall see later.\n\nKey Features of the ERC-4337 Standard\n\nA deep dive into the ERC-4337 standard reveals the following key features:\n\nUser Operations (UserOps) : Imagine it as a list of all the actions you provide your Ethereum account to execute.\n\nBundlers : The nodes that submit UserOps to the network for verification.\n\nEntryPoin t: The smart contract that performs UserOps.\n\nPaymaster : This entity manages the gas payment system.\n\nHow Does ERC-4337 Work?\n\nERC-4337 token standard transactions undergo a four-stage process.\n\nThe first is the initiation of UserOps, which are instructions for the desired actions, for example, sending tokens. The unconfirmed transactions go to an alternative mempool specifically built for ERC-4337 exchanges.\n\nThe bundlers then select several UserOps from the mempool and pack them into a single transaction called the bundle. Gas fees are the primary determinant of which UserOp the bundlers prioritize. From here, they send the bundle to EntryPoint, a global smart contract on the Ethereum Ecosystem.\n\nFor validation, bundlers trigger the \u201chandleOps\u201d call function on the EntryPoint. That allows the smart contract to receive the bundle transactions. Consequently, it requests a \u201cvalidate UserOp\u201d function for every account, enabling authentication of the operation\u2019s signature.\n\nOnce everything checks out, the EntryPoint processes the appropriate gas fees. Every ERC-4337 wallet must then perform another function to complete the transaction sent to them by the EntryPoint contract. Bundlers receive payments for each successful UserOp to incentivize their facilitation of the process.\n\nBenefits and Limitations of ERC-4337\n\nAccording to its proponents, ERC-4337 will fundamentally transform Ethereum for the better. But as with any technology, it also has its downsides. Let\u2019s look at its potential positives and negatives.\n\nPros\n\nEnhanced Security: The token standard removes the complexity of managing private keys and seed phrases, enhancing security with two-factor authentication and biometrics.\n\nCross-chain compatibility: The standard works across multiple blockchains compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).\n\nPotential Scalability: ERC-4337 batches transactions akin to rollups, which could increase the Ethereum network\u2019s throughput for the benefit of its users.\n\nSupports multi-party transactions: ERC-4337 supports creating shared dealings with other parties through multi-signature operations and sponsored transactions, enabling a third party, such as a dApp or another wallet, to pay your gas fees.\n\nSocial wallet recovery: With ERC-4337, you can whitelist certain addresses to assist in account recovery if you lose your logins.\n\nCons\n\nIt lacks true account abstraction: Currently, ERC-4337 only provides an off-chain medium for managing your transactions before sending them to the mainnet. Proper account abstraction is more comprehensive, requiring a significant update of Ethereum\u2019s consensus protocol.\n\nIncreased DoS risk: The standard\u2019s complex verification process could heighten exposure to denial-of-service (DoS) exploits.\n\nLimited Transaction Volumes: ERC-4337 accounts can only send one transaction to the mempool at a time.\n\nPotentially Higher Gas Costs: Adopters of ERC-4337 transactions could pay more gas than they would do in regular transactions.\n\nWhat Is the Role of the ERC-4337 Standard to Ethereum Users?\n\nThe ERC-4337 token standard is still developing in the Ethereum network and will likely grow in adoption and function. Adopters can put its features to many uses, including:\n\nCustomizing spending: Users can tailor-make their transactions by setting wallet usage instructions and spending limits. Again, they can activate notifications for certain margins. This way, their smart wallets will act similarly to the regular credit card.\n\nSubscribing to Web3 services: As the standard supports account programming, users can factor in periodic spending in their wallet\u2019s code. Similarly, they can set up other crypto-specific pay-to-use plans.\n\nAutomating DeFi functions: Your smart wallet readily interacts with different decentralized applications critical to the DeFi sector . So you can instruct it to automate certain DeFi functions, like seeking the best liquidity pools for your funds.\n\nMulti-token gas payments: ERC-4337 expands your gas-paying options because its account abstraction feature facilitates fee payment with any ERC-20 token. That eliminates the need to hold or convert your holdings to a particular token for gas payments.\n\nFinal Word\n\nThe deployment of the ERC-4337 token standard on the Ethereum mainnet has stirred the crypto community for good reasons. Chief among them is its ability to streamline the crypto adoption process. That said, it comes with its fair share of challenges necessitating care in its adoption.\n\nOne thing that\u2019s for sure is that it is a groundbreaking technology that has the potential to alter the Web3 user experience."
