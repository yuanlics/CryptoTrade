        "summary": "  According to Kaiko, a crypto analytics firm, aggressive bull market speculation on Ethereum (ETH) has not yet begun, despite the token's recent price increase. The firm notes that while there is some hype around ETH ETF applications, the data suggests that traders have not yet begun to position themselves for a rally. Derivatives data also indicates that recent ETH moves have been driven by spot markets rather than perpetual futures, which suggests that traders are not using leverage in anticipation of an ETH ETF. Additionally, open interest in ETH futures has surged ahead of price, but this has not yet led to a major build-up in open interest typical of a bull market. At the time of writing, ETH is trading for $2,473."

With this feature, users can stake at least 32 ETH (currently valued at around $80,000) to run a validator node on their behalf, securing the Ethereum network. This comes after Ethereum's transition to a proof-of-stake network in September 2022, known as 'The Merge.'\n\nUnlike other staking providers that require pooling smaller amounts of funds together, MetaMask's new offering promises no pooling and no hardware or software requirements. Instead, the 32 ETH stake is used to run a validator node through the Consensys Staking service, which already operates validators totaling about 4% of all staked ETH.\n\nMetaMask currently promises about 4% annual yield on the rewards, before taking a 10% fee. However, the company notes that this yield may increase or decrease due to the inherently random chance of any given validator's block being selected to add"
