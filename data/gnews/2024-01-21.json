Increased staking deposits: The article states that users have shown heightened interest in ETH staking since the Shapella Upgrade went live last year, resulting in more ETH getting staked into the network.\n2. Decreased liquid supply: The article notes that ETH's reserves on exchanges have been on a multi-year downtrend, with a liquid supply of just around 11% as of the article's writing. This means that there are fewer ETH available for active buying and selling, creating a scarcity in the market.\n3.

        "Sentiment": "  The sentiment in the article is overwhelmingly positive, with the author suggesting that the increase in Ethereum (ETH) staking is a bullish indicator for the asset's price. The article highlights the scarcity of ETH due to the decreasing liquid supply on exchanges and the increasing staked supply, which could lead to higher demand and prices in the long term. The author also quotes an on-chain analyst who predicts a massive price explosion due to the supply squeeze. The only negative sentiment in the article comes from the decrease in staking yields, but the author notes that this has not deterred users from participating in the activity. Overall, the sentiment in the article is optimistic and suggests that ETH could be a good investment opportunity."
