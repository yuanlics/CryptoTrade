        "summary": "  Ethereum Futures ETFs launched in the US with little fanfare, with only $2 million in trading volume on their first day. The VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF had the lowest trading volume of $425,000. Grayscale Investments is planning to convert its Bitcoin Trust into an ETF, and UBS Asset Management launched a money market fund tokenized on the Ethereum blockchain in a pilot project. JPMorgan's Onyx platform is also using blockchain for repurchase agreements with tokenized treasuries as collateral. Meanwhile, US employees of collapsed exchange FTX found a secret feature in the platform's code that allowed its sister company Alameda Research to access billions of dollars of customer funds, but nothing was done to address the issue. The former FTX boss is facing a criminal trial in New York for allegedly taking funds from FTX's customers using the hidden feature."

        "title": "Ethereum FUD Explodes As ETH Under $1,600, Time To Buy? - Bitcoinist",
        "summary": "  Ethereum's price has dipped below $1,600, leading to a spike in bearish sentiment among investors. Data from Santiment shows that the social dominance of Ethereum has increased significantly, indicating rising FUD in the market. However, this bearish sentiment has historically been a positive sign for the asset's price, with a rebound occurring in March when the social dominance was at high levels. It remains to be seen if Ethereum has found its bottom or if there is more downside to come before a rebound occurs."
