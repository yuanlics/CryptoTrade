We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nEthereum Foundation faced a sandwich attack during its recent sale of 1,700 ETH on Uniswap V3. The foundation, which is a key player in the Ethereum ecosystem, was caught off guard, resulting in a loss of U.S. $9,101.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to data from EigenPhi, the Ethereum Foundation's transaction was targeted by an MEV Bot (0x00...6B40). This bot, capitalizing on the opportunity, managed to make a neat profit of U.S. $4,060 after covering its costs.\n\nThe foundation's sale took place at 16:18 UTC+8, where they exchanged 1.7K ETH for a hefty 2.738 million USDC. A peek into the foundation's wallet reveals a balance of 240.68 ETH, 3.238 million USDC, 49,700 DAI and 10,000 ARB, bringing their total assets to a cool $3.687 million.\n\nBut what exactly is a sandwich attack? For the uninitiated, a sandwich attack is a form of front-running tactic used in the world of decentralized exchanges. In this strategy, a malicious actor spots a pending transaction on the Ethereum network and quickly places their own transaction with a higher gas fee, ensuring it gets processed first.\n\nThey then place another transaction right after the target transaction, effectively \"sandwiching\" the original transaction. This allows the attacker to manipulate the price in a way that they can profit from the victim's trade.\n\nThe fact that the Ethereum Foundation, a central entity in the Ethereum space, fell victim to such an attack raises eyebrows. It brings forth questions about the security measures in place and the vulnerabilities that exist even for seasoned players in the crypto arena.\n\nInterestingly, there is a pattern observed on Ethereum Foundation's sales. It often liquidates Ethereum just before significant sell-offs occur. While it is speculative to draw conclusions, the timing of its sales in relation to market movements has not gone unnoticed by keen market observers."

        "title": "Benjamin Cowen Doubles Down on Ethereum Call, Says Big ETH Collapse By End of the Year Most Likely Outcome - The Daily Hodl",
        "content": "A widely followed crypto analyst is doubling down on his prediction for Ethereum (ETH), the top smart contract platform by market cap.\n\nIn a new strategy session, crypto analyst Benjamin Cowen tells his 787,000 YouTube subscribers that Ethereum is likely to collapse by the end of the year.\n\n\u201cI think Ethereum returns home before it goes on any sustained bull run. A lot of people got excited \u2013 I mean, they can get excited all they want about this rally. It\u2019s still just a 2X move. You can celebrate a 2X move if you want, but you can get that in the stock market pretty easily. I mean, a lot of stocks do 2X moves\u2026\n\nYou ride a 50X move up, and then, you know, you take a side, whether you\u2019re bullish or bearish, and everyone celebrates $100 moves in either direction. But that\u2019s not what you\u2019re here for. What you\u2019ll notice is that every time Ethereum made a rally to new highs, it did not happen until Ethereum went home first. \u2018Home\u2019 is the lower regression band. Right now, we need to see Ethereum go home for new highs to come.\n\n[We\u2019ve] still got to see ETH go home, my friends, and it hasn\u2019t happened yet. So, I think that it will. And again, you can see on these lower time frames, at least over the last year and a little over a year, that it\u2019s trying to hold those levels. But again, at some point, it likely breaks, and when it does, that\u2019s likely when Ethereum starts to head home.\u201d\n\nAccording to an analysis published almost a year ago, Cowen says \u201chome\u201d for ETH is between $600-$800, where his own version of the logarithmic regression band sits.\n\nCowen says ETH will be coming \u201chome\u201d within the next several months.\n\n\u201cI think the most likely outcome is for Ethereum to drop below $1,200 within the next two and a half months and I mean it could certainly go lower.\u201d\n\nETH is worth $1,572 at time of writing, down 5% in the last week.\n\nI\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Ethereum price struggled to clear $1,660 and reacted to the downside against the US dollar. ETH remains at risk of more losses if it breaks the $1,550 support.\n\nEthereum resumed its decline and retested the $1,550 support.\n\nThe price is trading below $1,600 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $1,610 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair could accelerate lower if there is a close below the $1,550 support zone.\n\nEthereum Price Dives Again\n\nEthereum failed to settle above the $1,665 resistance zone. ETH started a fresh decline from the $1,665 resistance zone and dived below the $1,650 level.\n\nThe bears pushed the price below the $1,600 level and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. Ether retested the $1,550 support. A low was formed near $1,549 and the price is now attempting a recovery wave. There was a move above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $1,664 swing high to the $1,549 low.\n\nEthereum is now trading below $1,600 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $1,610 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.\n\nOn the upside, the price might face resistance near the $1,600 level. The first major resistance is near the trend line and $1,610. It is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $1,664 swing high to the $1,549 low.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nThe next major resistance is $1,620 or the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average, above which the price could rise toward the $1,665 resistance zone. A close above the $1,665 resistance might send the price toward the key resistance at $1,750. The next key resistance might be $1,820. Any more gains might open the doors for a move toward $1,880.\n\nDownside Break in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $1,600 resistance, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,565 level. The next key support is $1,550.\n\nA downside break below the $1,550 support might start another strong decline. In the stated case, the price could revisit the $1,465 level. Any more losses may perhaps send Ether toward the $1,420 level.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bearish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $1,550\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $1,620\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

Keep a close watch, as a daily close below $1,530 could signal a steep correction ahead for $ETH. pic.twitter.com/5qLuXTXOtr \u2014 Ali (@ali_charts) October 10, 2023\n\nOn Oct. 8, Ethereum plummeted to a low of $1,548 as the market resorted to profit-taking. Ethereum has been unable to recoup its previous-day losses and is currently in the red. ETH was down 0.54% in the last 24 hours to $1,583 at the time of writing.\n\nAccording to IntoTheBlock data, Ethereum is currently hovering above a demand zone with a lower support level of $1,533. This is where 2.39 million ETH were bought by 1.83 million Ethereum addresses.\n\nA loss of this support might trigger a decline near $1,485, where, unfortunately, Ethereum has little support even to $1,342.\n\nOn the upside, Ethereum faces huge resistance, slightly above where it trades at the moment. This is because 4.38 million addresses purchased 10.92 million ETH from $1,585 to $1,633, at an average price of $1,610.\n\nDerivative data suggests market lacks direction\n\nBlockchain and derivative data paint a less-than-rosy picture of the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value.\n\n#ETH open interest has increased since the start of September.\n\n\n\nFunding rates remain neutral to negative, suggesting the market lacks direction. pic.twitter.com/EHESMQMncw \u2014 Kaiko (@KaikoData) October 10, 2023\n\nCrypto research firm Kaiko said in a new tweet that ETH's open interest has increased since the start of September. Also, funding rates have remained neutral to negative, indicating a lack of direction on the market.\n\nSince February 2023, #Ethereum whales have capitalized on surging prices, offloading or redistributing over 5 million $ETH \u2014 equivalent to roughly $8.5 billion.\n\n\n\nNotably, this selling trend continues with no current indication of a shift towards #ETH accumulation yet. pic.twitter.com/Oz3Lct3hbL \u2014 Ali (@ali_charts) October 9, 2023\n\nIn another tweet, Ali mentioned that Ethereum whales have been offloading their holdings. He claims that since February 2023, Ethereum whales have profited from rising prices, selling or transferring around 5 million ETH worth approximately $8.5 billion. This selling trend is continuing, and there is no present hint of a shift toward ETH accumulation."

        "title": "Bitcoin Ordinals a Success? BTC set to Gain More Ethereum Capabilities - CCN.com",
        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nIt has been nearly two years since the Bitcoin upgrade that introduced Ordinals.\n\nAs the network has evolved, new use cases have expanded.\n\nToday, Bitcoin developers are working on new applications.\n\nThese may give the blockchain Ethereum-style capabilities.\n\nMany often credit Bitcoin Ordinals with significantly boosting the transaction volume on the Bitcoin network. Now, nearly 2 years after the upgrade that first enabled Ordinals, developers are using the technology to build Ethereum-style capabilities into the blockchain.\n\nBut with Ethereum advancing its own roadmap toward greater transaction volumes and more complex on-chain functions, does Bitcoin need to keep up?\n\nHow Ordinals Have Already Changed Bitcoin\n\nFirst introduced in November 2021, Bitcoin Ordinals enable the numbering, identification, and inscription of individual Satoshis, each representing one hundred millionth of a Bitcoin.\n\nThanks to Ordinals, the cost of inscribing data on the Bitcoin blockchain has dramatically reduced, and up to a 4 MB limit, it\u2019s possible to inscribe any kind of data on a single Satoshi.\n\nSince the 2021 upgrade, Ordinals have fueled a surge in activity on the Bitcoin network, driven by the development of new use cases like the BRC-20 NFT standard.\n\nAccording to Dune data, over 35M Ordinals inscriptions have occurred to date. Although the vast majority of these are text-based, more complex data formats have also helped power the surge in Ordinals inscriptions.\n\nOrdinals inscriptions\n\nFor example, users have recorded over 760,000 PNG images and more than 229,000 WEBP images on-chain as Bitcoin Ordinals. Advocates assert that Ordinals play a crucial role in diversifying the functionality of the Bitcoin network and are essential for ensuring its long-term survival.\n\nHowever, not everyone has been happy with Bitcoin\u2019s evolution to embrace a wider variety of transaction types. Purists argue that the blockchain should only be for its original purpose: the peer-to-peer transfer of value.\n\nFacing a slew of Bitcoin-based meme tokens and NFTs, critics have pointed out that transactions stemming from Ordinals inscriptions have occasionally clogged the network, leading to higher fees for users.\n\nIs Bitcoin Due a Layer 2 Revolution?\n\nAs well as expanding the range of Bitcoin token types available, the same upgrade that enabled Ordinals inscriptions is also leading to the development of new off-chain protocols.\n\nFor example, several projects have recently made advances toward realizing the vision of Ethereum-style rollups for Bitcoin.\n\nBy moving computation off-chain, recent innovations by Kasar Labs and Chainway could significantly scale transactions on the Bitcoin network and trigger an L2 revolution akin to Ethereum\u2019s.\n\n1/ We're thrilled to share that we're open-sourcing our Bitcoin Data Availability Adapter which allows Sovereign SDK to be compatible with Bitcoin. This is a crucial step in building our Bitcoin secured rollup \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f\n\nThe significance of this \ud83e\uddf5https://t.co/1dkuVL4Xbj \u2014 Chainway (@chainway_xyz) August 30, 2023\n\nMeanwhile, on October 9, a White Paper for a new system dubbed BitVM was published. The project\u2019s developers claim that BitVM enables the verification of any computable function on Bitcoin. Additionally, unless there are disputes with transactions, the resulting on-chain footprint remains minimal."
