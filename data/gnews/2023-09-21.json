        "content": "A \u201croutine\u201d Binance account consolidation process sent gas fees on Ethereum soaring, prompting accusations of incompetence on Thursday.\n\nAt approximately 6 am ET, an address labeled Binance 14 received hundreds of incoming ether transactions. Per Etherscan, the process sent gas prices as high as 280 gwei \u2014 over twenty times more expensive than the 13 gwei at the time of writing.\n\nThe activity briefly made the address one of the largest gas guzzlers on Ethereum, as the wallet was responsible for 83% of fees at the peak of the transfers. Top spenders tend to include the decentralized exchange Uniswap, various MEV bots, and layer-2 networks settling transactions to the base chain.\n\nThe Binance 14 address has spent $842,000 in total gas fees on a 24-hour basis, and just $562 in the last three hours. Over the course of its existence, the address \u2014 which currently accounts for $250 million of Binance\u2019s nearly $56 billion in holdings \u2014 is responsible for $95 million in gas expenditure between both incoming and outgoing transfers.\n\nIn a statement to Blockworks, a Binance spokesperson said, \u201cBinance carried out a routine consolidation of [ether] ETH to one of its wallets. Any impact to gas prices was unintentional but quickly resolved.\u201d\n\nIndeed, throughout its existence the Binance 14 address has seen a number of gas spend spikes, including one on Dec. 9, 2022 that led to an 880 ETH spend over a 24-hour period.\n\nBinance was the target of ire on social media as a result of the account consolidation process, with many observers noting that if they had simply spread the transactions out over a longer period of time, the gas spike would have been significantly subdued.\n\nAs a result of what some labeled as inefficient methodology, Binance ended up spending more on gas than they would have otherwise and made the network more expensive for others.\n\n\u201cEvery interaction I have had with them screams of incompetence,\u201d said Rotki app founder Lefteris Karapetsas of the transfers.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

The whale has withdrawn 24,548 ETH worth $40 million from Binance since Sept. 5, according to Lookonchain, with an average withdrawal price of $1,631.\n\nThe smart whale withdrew 5,040 $ETH($8.17M) from #Binance again ~20 mins ago.\n\n\n\nAnd the whale has withdrawn a total of 24,548 $ETH($40M) from #Binance since Sept 5, with an average withdrawal price of $1,631.https://t.co/J0BhAsGJhQ pic.twitter.com/xxb6MQ3L19 \u2014 Lookonchain (@lookonchain) September 21, 2023\n\nDepositing assets on an exchange usually indicates a desire to sell, while withdrawals may indicate a desire to accumulate.\n\nAnother whale sent 30,000 ETH (almost $50 million) to Binance, OKX and KuCoin on Sept. 19, according to Lookonchain.\n\nIn a string of moves, a whale that had been dormant for two years awoke and transferred 10,000 ETH worth $16.5 million out. Days later, the whale deposited 10,000 ETH worth $16.5 million to Binance, OKX and KuCoin via three different addresses. The whale then sent out another $10,000 ETH valued at $16.5 million.\n\nIn the most recent move of ETH to exchanges, Ethereum cofounder Vitalik Buterin moved 300 ETH (about $493,000) to Kraken on Tuesday.\n\nThe impact of the move is seen in the ETH price. This is because market participants pay close attention to whales' on-chain actions since they are regarded as well-informed and have an influence on the market.\n\nEthereum has lost the $1,600 level and is currently trading lower daily. The most recent price drop follows after whales, or huge holders, moved ETH to crypto exchanges, increasing concerns about potential price drops.\n\nETH was down 2.69% in the last 24 hours to $1,583 at the time of writing."

        "title": "If This 1 Metric Is Right, Ethereum Could Be Massively Undervalued - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Ethereum (ETH -0.58%) is up a resounding 37% so far this year. That might sound impressive, but keep in mind that Ethereum is still trading at nearly the same level it was 12 months ago when it completed The Merge. Shouldn't Ethereum's price have soared after this much-hyped technological breakthrough?\n\nClearly, crypto investors aren't impressed by technical upgrades and are waiting for the next big catalyst to appear for Ethereum. But that next big catalyst might be right under their noses, and they aren't even aware of it yet. As a result, Ethereum could be massively undervalued at its current price of $1,645.\n\nLayer 2 blockchain activity\n\nThe one metric to keep an eye on is the amount of activity happening on Layer 2 blockchain networks. These Layer 2 blockchains are built directly on top of the main Ethereum network, and help make Ethereum run faster, more efficiently, and more affordably. As such, they are very much part of the broader Ethereum ecosystem, and should be taken into account when thinking about Ethereum's growth prospects.\n\nEven after The Merge, Ethereum needs these Layer 2 blockchains, and founder Vitalik Buterin has always been clear that he supports the development of these Layer 2 networks. They are not cannibalizing the future growth of Ethereum. Instead, they are actively contributing to a much faster rate of growth for Ethereum.\n\nTo give you an idea of just how important these Layer 2 blockchain networks are, there are now five that rank among the top 55 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Granted, many of them are hardly household names. With the exception of Polygon, which garnered a fair amount of attention around the time of The Merge, they are quietly working behind the scenes, helping to scale Ethereum.\n\nImpact on growth\n\nThese Layer 2 blockchains are directly contributing to Ethereum's market dominance in key areas. For example, take non-fungible tokens (NFTs). If you examine the 30-day sales volume for NFTs, Ethereum is still the clear leader, with just under $200 million in sales. The next biggest Layer 1 blockchain network is Solana, with just under $30 million in sales. So, as a quick approximation, it's possible to say that Ethereum is doing nearly 7 times the sales volume of its next closest competitor.\n\nHowever, two of the top blockchains for NFT sales volume are Immutable X and Polygon, and both of these are Layer 2 blockchains for Ethereum. When you add in the 30-day NFT sales volume for both of these (approximately $50 million total), then it's possible to say that Ethereum is doing 8 times or even 9 times the sales volume of its next closest competitor.\n\nAnd the same story is true in the decentralized finance (DeFi) market. Again, Ethereum is the clear market leader here, accounting for nearly 55% of Total Value Locked (TVL). This metric describes how much value is \"locked up\" in various DeFi protocols, and is the single best indicator for overall DeFi strength. But four Layer 2 blockchains also rank in the Top 10 for TVL, and these account for another 10% of TVL on an aggregate basis. Taking this into account, Ethereum is responsible for a staggering two-thirds of all TVL in the blockchain world.\n\nValuation models\n\nAs demonstrated above, taking into account Layer 2 blockchain activity shows just how much Ethereum is potentially undervalued. A new report from crypto research firm RxR came to a similar conclusion. Using a valuation model based on Metcalfe's Law, which states that the value of any network is directly proportional to the square of the number of users, the research firm suggested that Ethereum might be undervalued by as much as 27%. In short, investors are overlooking the massive user growth on Layer 2 blockchain networks, and that is causing them to undervalue Ethereum.\n\nGranted, there are bound to be some skeptics who think that Metcalfe's Law shouldn't be applied to cryptocurrencies. After all, it's inconclusive whether adding a new user to an existing blockchain network should lead to a huge increase in value. It's different in the case of, say, telecom networks, because it's immediately clear how each new user (i.e., the person paying the phone bill each month) can be monetized.\n\nMoreover, Metcalfe's Law can lead to some pretty dizzying price estimates for cryptocurrencies. During the last crypto bull market rally, models based on Metcalfe's Law were projecting a $20,000 price target for Ethereum. The all-time high for Ethereum is just under $5,000, so that price target was wildly off the mark.\n\nSo is Ethereum undervalued or not?\n\nStill, it's easy to see how Ethereum could be significantly undervalued. Ethereum's metrics seem to be flatlining or declining. But dig deeper, and you'll see Layer 2 activity is taking off. The big question you have to ask yourself as an investor is whether this Layer 2 activity should be additive to the overall value of Ethereum.\n\nIt might be a controversial take, but I'm firmly in the camp of investors and analysts who think that Ethereum is trading at a huge discount right now. There's just too much activity happening on Layer 2 blockchain networks to ignore."

        "title": "Ethereum price sees new low vs Bitcoin since switching to proof-of-stake - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Ether (ETH) has seen a 36% year-to-date increase in its price in 2023 in U.S. dollar terms. This recovery, however, is modest given that ETH is currently trading 66% below its November 2021 peak of $4,870.\n\nEthereum vs. Bitcoin: 14-month downtrend and counting\n\nMoreover, on Sept. 20, Ether reached its lowest levels against Bitcoin (BTC) in 14 months, breaching the critical 0.06 BTC support. This has raised questions among Ether investors about the factors behind this price decline and what it will take to reverse the trend.\n\nETH/BTC price on Coinbase. Source: TradingView\n\nETH buyers placed their biggest hopes on protocol upgrades that significantly reduced the need for new coin issuance when the network transitioned to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism.\n\nThese hopes were realized in mid-September 2022, resulting in an annualized issuance rate of just 0.25% of the supply. This transformation aligned with the Ethereum community\u2019s vision of \u201cultrasound money.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, the subsequent Shapella upgrade on April 12 allowed for withdrawals from the native staking protocol, addressing a major concern for investors. Previously, both the 32 ETH deposits and the yield from participating in the network consensus were locked up indefinitely.\n\nConfidence among Ethereum enthusiasts grew as these significant hurdles were crossed with minimal issues. They anticipated that the price of Ether would surpass $2,000, a prediction that came true on April 14.\n\nHowever, this optimism was short-lived, as ETH\u2019s price promptly fell back to the same $1,850 level just a week later.\n\nNotably, instead of witnessing a net withdrawal, Ethereum staking experienced a net inflow of 3.1 million ETH in the 30 days following the Shappela upgrade, surpassing even the most optimistic expectations.\n\nGiven that the Ethereum network\u2019s planned developments have generally been on track, albeit with the customary delays, investors now need to explore other potential catalysts for reversing the current downtrend in Ether\u2019s price relative to BTC.\n\nExternal factors present important triggers for ETH price\n\nOne of these potential catalysts lies in the ongoing legal battle between Ripple (formerly Ripple Labs) and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which could significantly impact Ether\u2019s price momentum.\n\nThe SEC contends that XRP (XRP) sales to retail investors constitute a securities offering. However, in July, Judge Analisa Torres ruled that XRP generally does not qualify as a security under SEC guidelines, especially when distributed through exchanges.\n\nAs noted by the \u201cAmerican lawyer and Bitcoiner\u201d Bryan Jacoutot on X (formerly Twitter), the Ethereum Foundation remains exposed due to the presale of ETH directed toward institutional investors and subject to a lock-up period.\n\n(1/12) ANALYSIS: I've reviewed the district court ruling on XRP and it rests on very shaky ground. Expect an appeal.\n\n\n\nAND Ethereum Foundation remains at risk even if its upheld because of important distinctions in the methods used by Ripple to sell the \"pre-mine\"\n\n\n\n\u2b07\ufe0f\u2b07\ufe0f \u2014 Bryan Jacoutot (@BryanJacoutot) July 13, 2023\n\nAccording to Jacoutot, even if Ripple were to secure a favorable outcome, it wouldn\u2019t immediately mitigate the risks for Ethereum. Nevertheless, it\u2019s undeniable that the regulatory uncertainty surrounding the Ether initial coin offering (ICO) remains a source of concern for investors.\n\nOn Sept. 20, an Ethereum address associated with the ICO era showed its first activity, transferring 32.1 ETH (valued at $52,000 at the time) directly to Coinbase. This additional movement only amplified regulatory concerns since there are no apparent incentives for addresses that have remained dormant for four to eight years to divest at this particular point in the market cycle.\n\nAn Ethereum ICO participant who has been dormant for 8 years transferred 32.1 $ETH to #Coinbase just now.\n\n\n\nThe address received 200 $ETH at Ethereum Genesis.\n\n\n\nAnd the address appears to be related to shemnon.eth (@shemnon).https://t.co/nj5eF8iRT0 pic.twitter.com/6Viytn4dU5 \u2014 Lookonchain (@lookonchain) September 20, 2023\n\nA similar occurrence unfolded with an address linked to Vitalik Buterin, which sent 300 ETH (worth $490,000 at the time) to the Kraken exchange on Sept. 19.\n\nMore positive news gives hope to Ethereum investors\n\nOn the news side, Ethereum has seen some positive surprises, such as the unexpected request for a spot Ether exchange-traded fund by ARK Invest and 21Shares on Sept. 6. This development reduced the risks associated with excessive institutional concentration in Bitcoin, particularly if the ETF is approved.\n\nAdditionally, Canto, a layer-1 Cosmos-native blockchain, announced its expansion to Ethereum\u2019s layer 2 on Sept. 18. This zero-knowledge, permissionless rollup, compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine, is primarily focused on bringing traditional finance into the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nShould Bitcoin\u2019s price surge be driven solely by the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF or inflation concerns in the United States, Ether is well-positioned to follow suit, benefiting from the same catalysts.\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum\u2019s primary competitors in the decentralized applications sector, namely Solana and BNB Chain, face similar risks pertaining to ICO and securities regulations, making it unlikely for them to challenge Ethereum\u2019s dominance in terms of total value locked and trading volumes.\n\nCollect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.
