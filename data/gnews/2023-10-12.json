        "title": "Ethereum Could Explode by Over 2,100%, According to $820,000,000,000 Global Bank: Report - The Daily Hodl",
        "content": "One of the largest banks in the world reportedly believes that the smart contract platform Ethereum (ETH) could soar by more than 2,100%.\n\nAccording to a new CNBC article, the UK-based bank Standard Chartered is predicting that Ethereum will eventually increase to as high as $35,000 after hitting $8,000 in about three years.\n\nGeoff Kendrick, an analyst at the London-based bank, says that increasing use cases and layer-2 scaling solutions built on Ethereum are among the reasons for the price forecast.\n\n\u201cWe think Ethereum\u2019s established dominance in smart contract platforms, along with emerging uses in gaming and tokenization, has the potential to push ETH to the $8,000 level by end-2026 [which is] a stepping stone to our long-term \u2018structural\u2019 valuation estimate of $26,000-$35,000.\u201d\n\nAccording to CNBC, Kendrick believes gaming and tokenization of real-world assets offer some of the greatest growth potential for Ethereum.\n\nHe also expresses optimism about planned Ethereum upgrades. In early 2024, Ethereum is slated to implement \u201cproto-danksharding,\u201d which would increase the network\u2019s transaction speed and lower transaction costs.\n\n\u201cLayer 2 scaling solutions\u2026 are likely to grow in importance over time, particularly as architecture upgrades expected in early 2024 sharply lower fees on these platforms. This should help to cement ETH\u2019s dominance in the smart contract space, thereby increasing its P/E (price to earnings) ratio over the next couple of years.\u201d\n\nWith ETH trading for $1,540 at time of writing, an increase to $35,000 would represent a 2,173% jump, while a move to $8,000 would be a 419% increase.\n\nStandard Chartered is the 43rd largest bank in the world with $820 billion of assets under management.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

From a technical perspective, it's notable that both crypto's are currently trading below the critical 50 and 200 EMA Daily, with BTC below Rs 23,97,000 ($27,000) and ETH below Rs 1,40,700 ($1,575),\" said CoinDCX Research Team.Meanwhile, ZebPay Trade Desk, said, \"The crypto market is currently facing pressure with Bitcoin and major altcoins experiencing a downturn. This decline is partially attributed to the release of the September Producer Price Index (PPI) report, which revealed a surge in wholesale inflation to 0.5%. This exceeded market expectations, indicating higher inflationary pressures.\"The total volume in DeFi is currently $1.88 billion, 7.55% of the total crypto market 24-hour volume.

At the same BTC price, Ethereum was trading at $1,800 in July but now it is trading at $1,560. This trend will likely continue through this month. BTC has to reclaim $27,400 in the upcoming days to negate its bearish momentum. Risks of increased oil prices and negative jobs outlook continue to dampen spirits in the crypto ecosystem,\" Vikram Subburaj, CEO of Giottus Crypto Platform, said.On the 4-hour chart, Bitcoin demonstrated its technical position at $26,780, with a critical point set at $27,000. Notable resistance levels include $27,300, $27,745, and up to $28,280. Conversely, immediate support lies at $26,414, with additional levels at $26,186 and $25,989. Investors and traders are closely monitoring Bitcoin's price action, particularly at the pivot point, to assess its future trajectory."
