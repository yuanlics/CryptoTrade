GSN is an open-sourced community-driven effort that creates a decentralized and trustless mechanism for leveraging meta transactions.\n\nThe Gas Station Network consists of relayers, or gas stations, that accept etherless transactions, fill them with gas, and relay them to the network. Relayers are required to stake ETH to prevent certain attacks.\n\nFrom the user's perspective, everything is done transparently, autonomously, and in a timely"
