        "summary": "  Crypto had a tough year in 2022, with the value of bitcoin dropping 64% and the implosion of FTX. However, some analysts remain optimistic about the space's potential. Bernstein analysts Gautam Chhugani and Manas Agarwal argue that crypto has a \"survival instinct\" and will bounce back due to its decentralized nature, strong foundation in Ethereum, and potential benefits from regulation. They note that crypto has been through similar downturns in the past and has always rallied, and that DeFi projects are largely insulated from FTX's impact. Additionally, they believe that regulation will bring more institutional investors to the space and create a more sustainable ecosystem. Despite the challenges, the analysts see crypto as having strong potential to grow and become a part of the infrastructure of the next decade of internet development."
