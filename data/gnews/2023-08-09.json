        "content": "Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong says that the scaling solutions for Ethereum (ETH) have a better adoption rate than Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) Lightning Network.\n\nIn a recent earnings call, Armstrong says that Ethereum\u2019s scaling solutions, such as Polygon (MATIC), Optimism (OP) and Arbitrum (ARB), are seeing heavy adoption.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been taking a fresh look at it [Lightning Network], and there\u2019s been a number of really great teams from different companies working on open source solutions and some proprietary ones that are trying to help advance the state of technology there. I think the Layer-2 solutions on Ethereum, like Polygon and Optimism and Arbitrum, Base [Coinbase\u2019s layer 2 network built on Ethereum] is built on one of those, Optimism, have \u2014 they\u2019ve actually gotten more adoption.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Coinbase CEO, scaling solutions can enhance the adoption level by becoming more user-friendly.\n\n\u201cA lot of it comes down to usability challenges as well.\n\nIf you\u2019re an average user, they don\u2019t really want to know or maybe they don\u2019t even care about these \u2014 what is it doing underneath, like the average user doesn\u2019t want to have to learn how to bridge from Layer 1 to Layer 2 to send their payment. They just want to pay for something and it \u2018just works.\u2019\n\nI think what needs to happen, and this is something Coinbase can really help with is we can make this seamless in the background.\n\nIf somebody goes to pay for something online or a friend or a remittance payment or something like that, it should really negotiate \u2014 almost do a handshake underneath that would say, OK, what types of cryptocurrencies on what chains and is this recipient accepting, and which ones do I have? And it would basically do the bridge or the conversion in real time for you underneath. And so, you would just see the amount of dollars or something like that going over the wire, and it arrives in one second with $0.01\u2026\n\nAnd you don\u2019t have to worry about Layer 2 and all these kinds of things. That\u2019s the ideal outcome we need to get to\u2026\u201d\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) has always showcased its competency as an open-ended decentralized software platform. It is one of the selling points of the world\u2019s second most-used cryptocurrency. However, PayPal Holdings, Inc.\u2019s (PYPL) announcment on Monday that it would be introducing its own U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin, PayPal USD (PYUSD), could spark some serious debate.\n\nPYUSD is an Ethereum-based stablecoin, which would, after introduction, be pegged to the value of the U.S. dollar. It has been designed for digital payments and the web, and will soon be available for U.S. customers. But even as this is bound to push Ethereum stocks up by establishing its place as the money layer on the Internet, it will also hit the crypto coin\u2019s core value of decentralizing.\n\nCentralization issues are the most common attack areas within the gamut of decentralized finance or DeFi, one of the crypto world\u2019s main differentiating features. In 2021 alone, DeFi hacks amounted to no less than $10 billion, revealing patterns of how the transactions are classified and tracked. Now, with around 430 million accounts actively using PayPal, the chances of cluster attacks would go up.\n\nMany smart contract auditors have highlighted that the PYUSD algo contains \u201cfreezefunds\u201d and \u201cwipefrozenfunds\u201d functions, which are textbook examples of centralization attack vectors. Concerns have also been raised about the digital contract that users would sign, and that these contracts resemble censorship-enabled central bank digital currency.\n\nDespite this, Ethereum would get a massive boost once the project goes live. It would finally give Ethereum the mainstream push that it has been seeking all these years in its competition with Bitcoin (BTC). Coupled with the Shanghai Upgrade, under which it shifted its blockchain validation system from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake, this might be ETH\u2019s year.\n\nPowered by these developments and what has largely been hailed as a crypto rebound, the price of Ethereum has soared 53.9% this year as of Aug 8. So, with Ethereum getting this push, it might be prudent to keep a watch on stocks exposed to this open-source blockchain platform, decentralized or not.\n\nStory continues\n\nAccenture plc ACN is a global system integrator that provides consulting, technology and other services, and markets Ethereum-based blockchain solutions to businesses to make it easier to process payments.\n\nAccenture\u2019s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 8.2%.
