        "summary": "  Ethereum (ETH) is experiencing a bullish momentum, with its price rallying and breaking significant resistance levels. On-chain data shows that over 200,000 addresses have purchased over 18 million ETH at the $2,100-$2,150 level, making it a crucial resistance area for the cryptocurrency. However, if Ethereum can maintain its momentum and surpass this resistance level, it is well-positioned to reach new yearly highs and consolidate above the $2,000 mark. A fractal mirrors a bullish pattern for ETH, and the upcoming Shappella upgrade could further drive its price upwards. Despite the recent surge, Ethereum has also seen a high rate of liquidations, with approximately $30 million worth occurring within 24 hours at the $1,880 level. It is now crucial for ETH to maintain its current level as a support and consolidate above the $1,900 mark to continue its upward trend. As of writing, Ethereum is trading at $1,867,"

However, becoming a successful \"Bundler,\" a node that organizes and submits user operations to the network, may be challenging due to the competitive nature of the market. The introduction of ERC-4337 has also led to an ongoing debate about the potential impact on Ethereum gas fees. While it is still too early to tell, current expectations suggest that gas fees may not change significantly."

The service provided historical blockchain data to developers, students, and researchers, but is no longer necessary due to the existence of robust remote procedure call (RPC) providers offering access to archive data. The project was initiated by \"DeFi Dude\" and received an initial grant of $10,000 from the Ethereum Foundation. While ArchiveNodes are not required for block validation, they require greater storage capacity and were previously the only option for accessing archive data, with Infura charging $250 monthly. The project was never intended to make money or profit, and the shutdown is seen as a success rather than a sad ending."

This could be a sign of capital rotation into ETH ahead of the Shanghai upgrade, which will allow for staked ETH withdrawals. The last time ETH traded at such oversold levels to BTC produced fresh highs on the ETH/BTC chart, raising the possibility of a sustained rebound in the coming weeks. Sustained strength in ETH could bode well for altcoins, but ETH faces a barrier coinciding with moving averages on its BTC chart. On the upside, ETH is breaking out according to on-chain data, with a critical resistance area between $2,100 and $2,150 where over 200K addresses purchased 18 million ETH."

However, the token's price has fallen by 90% since its early price of over $11, as new token owners sold their holdings to lock in profits. Despite this, some bulls predict that the token could double in value by the end of April. The token's growth prospects are tied to the future of Ethereum, as it is a Layer 2 scaling solution for the blockchain. Arbitrum already has a significant share of the total value locked (TVL) on the blockchain, and developers are using it for new blockchain projects. However, the Layer 2 field is becoming more crowded, which could impact future market share projections. The token's early performance issues, including a sharp price drop on the first day of trading, have raised concerns. Some analysts suggest that the price of Arbitrum could reverse soon, while others recommend investing in Ethereum instead."

However, layer 1-based apps could become economically nonviable, and small funds might get stuck with gas fees escalation. An \"open\" zk-EVM system would require different clients with compatible implementations, preserving the multi-client paradigm and facilitating new client development. zk-EVMs could simplify the process of running a full Ethereum node, and significant progress has been made with layer-2 scaling platform Polygon's open-sourced zkEVM.
