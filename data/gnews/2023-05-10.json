        "title": "Ethereum derivatives flirting with bearishness: Mind the $1,820 support - Cointelegraph",
        "summary": "  Ethereum derivatives are flirting with bearishness as the Ether price has been stuck in a tight range between $1,820 and $1,950 for the past three weeks. Professional traders have been unwilling to add neutral-to-bullish positions using derivatives contracts, which favors a break below $1,820. The increased gas fees on the Ethereum network have driven users to layer-2 solutions, which could be interpreted as a weakness. The Ether sale by the Ethereum Foundation and the lack of demand for risk-on assets due to investors' expectations of stable interest rates at the next Federal Reserve meeting may also contribute to the bearish outlook. The Ether futures contract premium and options markets also suggest a lack of appetite from buyers using derivatives contracts, which could lead to a break below $1,820."

        "summary": "  Extremist groups have received large cryptocurrency donations, totaling over $300,000, through a mysterious donor using a cryptocurrency mixer service. The donations were made to groups such as Ammon Bundy's People's Rights Network, white nationalist publication VDARE, and white nationalist organization American Renaissance. The donations continue a pattern of anonymous big-money benefactors using cryptocurrency to conceal their identities and avoid accountability for funding extremists. The donor used a service called Tornado Cash to disguise the origins of the donations, which have been sanctioned by the US government due to their use in money-laundering. The donations were made between August 2021 and April 2022, and some of the groups have received donations from all three accounts used by the donor."

        "summary": "  Ethereum's OFAC-compliant blocks, which are blocks that adhere to US sanctions, have decreased to 27% from a higher percentage in 2022. This means that Ethereum has maintained its censorship-resistance property despite the OFAC sanctions. Relay operators, such as Flashbots, have been filtering transactions that are not OFAC-compliant, but the percentage of OFAC-compliant blocks has decreased. This highlights the importance of censorship resistance in blockchain technology."

        "summary": "  Bitcoin and Ethereum prices rose as US inflation slowed to 4.9% in April, according to the Consumer Price Index. The increase in inflation was largely driven by a jump in housing prices, while core inflation (excluding food and energy costs) rose 5.5%. Despite the slowdown in inflation, the Federal Reserve has continued to raise interest rates to combat soaring prices, which could potentially lead to a recession. The Fed's next meeting in June may see a pause in rate hikes if inflation remains under control."

        "summary": "  Validators on the Ethereum network earned a record $46 million in the first week of May due to a surge in staking rewards. The increase is attributed to the recent trading craze of a new memecoin called Pepe, which has resulted in higher fees on the Ethereum network. The average fees on the network have exceeded 100 gwei, marking the highest level since May 2022. This has resulted in higher fee income for validators from processing transactions and regular validator rewards. The staking rewards rate signifies the anticipated annualized return for validators, who are mandated to stake a minimum of 32 ETH to engage in the network's consensus procedure."

        "summary": "  Arbitrum, an Ethereum-based Layer 2 scaling solution, has shared its fee generation model, which involves sending surplus fees to its decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). This move has led to a bullish price uptick for the ARB token, with a growth of over 3%.

The total funds billed for the Sequencer are approximately $10.9 million, with 582 ETH reserved for the Sequencer and 3,352 ETH to be sent to the DAO as a reward. This distribution of rewards has triggered a buy-up of ARB, extending the positive outlook for the scaling tool on Ethereum."
