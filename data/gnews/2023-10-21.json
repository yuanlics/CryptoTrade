        "title": "Ethereum Price Prediction: Will Broader Market Recovery Push $ETH Above $1800? - CoinGape",
        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction: Despite a recent bullish climate in the crypto market, the ETH price is struggling to recover from the $1,530 support level. Over the past week, the coin has made two unsuccessful attempts to breach the $1,600 mark, indicating strong overhead supply pressure. If this resistance endures, the coin price might remain in a consolidation phase above the $1,500 support level.\n\nAlso Read: Elevated US Treasury Yield Is Hurting Ethereum More Than Bitcoin, Here\u2019s Why\n\nadvertisement\n\nEmerging Pattern Hints a Rally to $1745\n\nEthereum Fear and index at 48% reflect a neutral sentiment in the market\n\nA bullish breakout from $1745 could set a direction trend in the ETH price\n\nThe intraday trading volume in Ether is $6.6 Billion, indicating a 34% gain.\n\nSource- Tradingview\n\nIn today\u2019s trading, the Ethereum price posted an intraday gain of 2.68%, exhibiting a bullish morning Star candle pattern that originated from the $1,530 support. Such a pattern at a crucial support level often signals an imminent bullish reversal.\n\nHowever, the candle formation today shows a high wick, suggesting the presence of sellers around the $1,600 level. If this supply pressure persists, the ETH price could continue its consolidation, potentially revisiting the $1,530 level to regain bullish momentum.\n\nAs of now, the second-largest cryptocurrency Ethereum trades at $1,609. For a more confident recovery to be confirmed, it needs to surpass its October 16th high of $1,556. Achieving this could position Ethereum for a quick 5% rally to $1,572 and complete a bullish Double Bottom reversal pattern.\n\nIs ETH Price Ready for Recovery?\n\nIn the broader context, the ETH price has been traveling in a sideways trend oscillating between $1,745 and $1,530 horizontal level. Amid this consolidation, the daily chart shows the forming of what appears to be a double-bottom pattern, a bullish reversal indicator. Should this pattern play out, the Ethereum price has the potential to break out of its current consolidation range, aiming for a breach above the $1,745 mark, thereby heralding a new recovery trend.\n\nSuper Trend: A red film projected in the daily indicates the sellers pose an upper hand\n\nRelative Strength Index: Contrary to sideways action, the daily RSI slope showing an evident rise indicates the increasing bullish momentum at bottom support."

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nEthereum developers continue in preparation for the Deneb-Cancun upgrade and are teasing the launch of Devnet #10, which will most likely be the final devnet before the upgrade is released on public Ethereum testnets like Goerli.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs stated in the most recent Ethereum ACDE report, Barnabas Busa, a DevOps engineer for Ethereum Foundation, hints at waiting on client teams for new software releases. Once these are ready, the next devnet, and hopefully the last, Devnet #10, might launch.\n\ngm gm, another eth dev call writeup coming at youuu \u2728\n\nyesterday, devs talked about a new deneb release for CL clients, v1.4.0-beta.3, dubbed \"the summoning\" \ud83e\uddd9\n\nthis release includes mainnet kzg configs and a new gossip rule to help prevent blob spam \ud83d\udc21https://t.co/oVYQ65eDDA \u2014 Christine Kim (@christine_dkim) October 20, 2023\n\nIn addition, Ethereum developers have announced a new Deneb release for CL clients, v1.4.0-beta.3, dubbed \"the summoning.\"\n\nThe release of new CL code specifications for the Cancun/Deneb (Dencun) upgrade, dubbed \"the summoning,\" formally tagged as version 1.4.0-beta.3 in the CL GitHub repository, features two main changes.\n\nFirst, mainnet KZG configurations: The formatting work needed to finalize the output from Ethereum's trusted setup ceremony has been completed and is now included in the most recent CL spec release.\n\nSecond is the new gossip rule, which ensures that CL nodes do not transmit more blobs than the maximum amount of blobs per block, which is presently set in the specifications as six blobs per block. This prevents validators from spamming the network with invalid messages that exceed six blobs per block.\n\nPrysm, an Ethereum client, announced the release of its v4.1.0 version earlier this week. Although capabilities such as backward syncing and filesystem-based blob storage are planned for Q4, 2024, this release sets the groundwork for Deneb support.\n\nThis release also includes new features such as decreasing memory with multi-value slices, optimizing block processing with EIP-4881, boosting portable build performance with BLST0.3.11 and providing live previews of multiarch containers."
