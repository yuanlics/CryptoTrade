        "content": "Most notably, the upgrade made ETH \u201cdeflationary\u201d for the first time, meaning that the overall supply of the token is now decreasing rather than increasing. The circulating supply of ETH today is .24% lower than it was a year ago. The decrease in supply stemmed in part from EIP-1559, a network upgrade that preceded the Merge by about a year. That upgrade began \u201cburning\u201d some ETH with every transaction on the network, but ETH didn\u2019t become net-deflationary until the Merge made additional cuts to the rate at which new ETH is issued."

        "title": "Ethereum Funding Rate Turns Negative; Is A Short Squeeze Ahead? - CoinGape",
        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) started the week on a somber note, extending its losses from Sunday. Concerns escalated earlier on Monday as reports emerged of Vitalik Buterin\u2019s transfer of approximately 400 ETH to Coinbase, intensifying fears of further price declines.\n\nThe second largest cryptocurrency has recently been caught in a web of tight price consolidation after several rejections at the $1,650 resistance level, causing concern among traders and sparking a surge in negative funding rates in the cryptocurrency futures market.\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum Negative Funding Rates Surges\n\nCryptocurrency funding rates mirror market sentiment, signifying periodic payments between traders to align perpetual futures contract prices with underlying assets. Positive rates signal bullishness, while negative rates indicate bearishness. Ethereum\u2019s recent narrow trading range has resulted in persistently negative funding rates, fostering a pessimistic outlook as traders brace for potential ETH price drops.\n\nNotably, \u201cGreatest Trader\u201d a pseudonymous analyst with popular crypto analytics firm CryptoQuant emphasized this trend in a post shared by the firm today.\n\nThe Potential for a Short Squeeze\n\nWhile prolonged periods of negative funding rates typically suggest a bearish market, they can also set the stage for a short squeeze, or a scenario where short sellers are forced to buy back their positions to cover their losses, resulting in a sudden price rebound. \u201cGreatest Trader\u201d further underscored the likelihood of such a sequence, explaining, \u201cConsistent negative funding rates bear the potential to initiate a chain reaction of short liquidations, which, in turn, could catalyze an abrupt price rebound.\u201d\n\nWhales and Traditional Investors Prepare for Volatility\n\nIn a related development, Ethereum options on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) have hit a record high of $352 million in open interest, signalling a spike in interest from traditional investors. This coincides with rising expectations of an Ethereum futures Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) approval scheduled for next week.\n\nThis surge in open interest indicates investor positioning for a potential bullish outcome, with data from Santiment showing Ethereum whales holding between 100,000 ETH and 1,000,000 ETH accumulating just over 1 million ETH after the September 11 price dip. Afterwards, the cryptocurrency witnessed a noteworthy uptick indicating significant accumulation by big investors.\n\nAt press time, Ethereum price was trading at $1,574 after a 1.19% drop over the past 24 hours according to CoinMarketCap data."

        "title": "Number Of Ethereum Addresses Losing Money Just Reached A New All-Time High - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Ethereum holders have been subject to uncertainty over the last few months as bulls and bears have struggled for control. With the bears winning at a much higher rate than the bulls, Ethereum holders have found their holdings have continued to lose value. This time around, the plunge has sent the number of investors losing money to a new all-time high.\n\nNumber Of Ethereum Addresses In Loss At ATH\n\nOn-chain data tracker Glassnode Alerts on X (formerly Twitter) has revealed a shocking development regarding Ethereum addresses. According to the tracker, the number of addresses seeing losses on a 7-day moving average (MA) has jumped to its highest level ever.\n\nThis metric takes note of the price at which the ETH coins being held on addresses were last moved. Then it is compared to the current price of the altcoin to figure out if the addresses are seeing gains or losses. The metric had been rapidly climbing in 2023 due to the bear market, culminating in a new all-time high.\n\nAccording to Glassnode\u2019s report, the total number of addresses in loss is now sitting at 49,939,211.006, rising from its previous all-time high of 49,921,736.464 that was reached on September 15. If the price of ETH continues to drop, then this figure will likely hit another all-time high soon.\n\nNumber of addresses in loss hit new all-time high Source: Glassnode\n\nOther ETH Metrics Flashing Bearish\n\nEthereum\u2019s open interest in perpetual futures contracts had also taken a hit with the price struggles. It dropped to a one-month low $445,789,354, just weeks after hitting a previous one-month low of $450,965,900 on September 13.\n\nAccumulation also seems to be dropping among mid-sized investors in the meantime. Glassnode also reports that the number of addresses holding at least 10 ETH had plunged to a 3-month low of 347,825. This suggests that these investors may be offloading their holdings to prevent more losses.\n\nSmall investors are also not left out of this trend. Another metric that tracks the number of Ethereum addresses holding at least 0.1 ETH also showed a decline in recent months. This has led to a 5-month low for the metric, with only 5,120,950 addresses holding 0.1+ ETH.\n\nThese declines come as no surprise as the ETH price had lost support above $1,600. With the bears dragging the price below $1,600, the losses for holders had climbed rapidly as the altcoin\u2019s price fell to two-week lows.\n\nFounder Vitalik Buterin had also made transactions carrying a significant amount of ETH toward centralized exchanges. This has sparked speculations that the founder is selling, which in turn could influence investors to sell as well.\n\nETH bears take control of price | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nFeatured image from Blockchair, chart from Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

Discover SCENE\n\nIllustration by Mitchell Preffer for Decrypt.\n\nPrices of leading cryptocurrencies stayed stable over the last seven days. Market leader Bitcoin (BTC) held the fort at $26,569, more or less exactly the same price as last week, while Ethereum (ETH) dropped a slight 2.8% to trade for $1,592.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt was another of crypto\u2019s relatively less volatile weeks, which seem to be occurring more frequently this year. There were no major price swings among any of the forty biggest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization\u2014except for Chainlink.\n\nHolders of LINK found their stashes swell by 12% this week to hit $7 on Saturday.\n\nOn Wednesday, Toncoin (TON) was posting seven-day gains of 31%, but the coin\u2019s rapid rally\u2014which ran for just over a week on news that parent company Telegram had integrated a TON self-custodial wallet into the messaging app\u2014appears to have cooled off by the weekend.\n\nToncoin enters Saturday just 3.7% up at $2.33.\n\nAdoption news\n\nThis week\u2019s Fed policy meeting concluded with no new interest rate hikes, positively contributing to stabilizing crypto prices. The more difficult it is to borrow, the more people offload speculative assets like stocks and cryptocurrencies.\n\nThere were more headlines indicating that global crypto adoption is continuing apace.\n\nOn Monday, banking giant Citigroup launched a digital token service utilizing blockchain and smart contract technology to facilitate rapid cross-border payments between institutions.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOn Wednesday, PayPal announced that Venmo users will be able to purchase the payments giant\u2019s dollar-pegged Ethereum-based stablecoin PYUSD \u201cin the coming weeks.\u201d\n\nPolitics\n\nThere were also several political developments with regard to crypto this week.\n\nThe former chair of the leading British regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), confessed at a conference on Tuesday that during his tenure (2018\u20132022), the FCA faced \u201cpolitical pressure\u201d to accept several of the 43 firms currently approved to offer crypto services in the UK. He further said that \u201call the evidence\u201d suggested that it \u201cwasn\u2019t a very good idea.\u201d\n\nLater in the week, the FCA publicly urged British crypto companies to register with existing financial promotions legislation. All companies promoting crypto in the UK, whether based in the territory or not, have to make an application and pay a fee to get approved or promote their services through approved parties.\n\n\u201cWe are concerned by the poor engagement from many unregistered, overseas crypto asset firms who have U.K. customers on this important change,\u201d the FCA wrote in its statement.\n\nIn the States on Wednesday, the House Financial Services Committee (HFSC) passed the CBDC Anti-Surveillance State Act, laying the groundwork for a future vote on the legislation on the House floor.\n\nProposed by crypto-friendly Congressman Tom Emmer (R-MN), the legislation hopes to block the Federal Reserve from issuing a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) to individuals. Emmer has called CBDCs \u201cfinancial surveillance tools.\u201d Presidential candidates Ron DeSantis and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. have opposed CBDCs for similar reasons."

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nEthereum\u2019s co-founder Vitalik Buterin deposited $630,000 worth of ETH into Coinbase.\n\nObservers are uncertain if transactions reflect a broader strategy or just portfolio management.\n\nCrypto market has been volatile recently.\n\nAny significant moves by key players can impact market dynamics.\n\nVitalik Buterin, Ethereum\u2019s co-founder, recently deposited a substantial amount of ETH, approximately $0.63 million, into Coinbase during a volatile crypto market. This move has left his intentions and strategy unclear, adding suspense to his cryptocurrency actions.\n\nButerin is one of the most well-known individuals in the cryptocurrency industry. While the cryptocurrency market struggles with unpredictability, Buterin\u2019s moves have generated interest and rumors.\n\nA Standard Transaction?\n\nData from the Ethereum blockchain scanning tool Etherscan show that Buterin made the most recent transfer into Coinbase on Monday, depositing 400 ETH worth approximately $630,000. Many in the crypto world are considering the consequences of this shift.\n\nMeanwhile, Buterin\u2019s ongoing cryptocurrency deposits follow a recent pattern of transactions, adding intrigue to his intentions. His wallet has seen significant ETH movements in the past week, leaving uncertainty about whether this is routine portfolio management or part of a larger strategy.\n\nLooking at Buterin\u2019s most recent transactions, the mystery surrounding his transfer activity intensifies. His wallet address delivered 300 ETH to Kraken, another well-known cryptocurrency exchange, in addition to the 400 ETH put on Coinbase. Additionally, 200 ETH moved from his wallet into USDC, a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar.\n\nPossible Consequences for the Crypto Market\n\nVitalik Buterin\u2019s recent actions are drawing significant attention, particularly in a volatile market. As an Ethereum co-founder, his moves can sway investor sentiment, yet his intentions remain unclear.\n\nEthereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, saw a 3.5% drop last week amidst market turbulence. Key players\u2019 actions can profoundly impact the overall market narrative in such conditions.\n\nHis activities and transactions are being intently watched by market participants and enthusiasts who are trying to determine how they might affect Ethereum and the larger cryptocurrency market.\n\nIn a recent interview , Buterin mentioned that Ethereum might be better equipped to resist government intervention, especially with the current implementation of a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism.\n\nButerin clarified that proof-of-stake offers better anonymity and resistance to shutdown attempts than proof-of-work. He pointed out that proof-of-work relies on extensive physical infrastructure and high energy consumption, areas where law enforcement has experience in detection.\n\nIn the midst of market turmoil, Buterin\u2019s recent transactions have sparked interest in the crypto community. Ethereum\u2019s one-day trading volume surged to $4.7 billion, while its price dipped by 0.6% to $1,630.61 at the time of writing, all while his intentions and strategies remain uncertain.\n\nHacked Twitter Account Results in Theft Of $700K\n\nA cyber attacker successfully breached Vitalik Buterin\u2019s official X account, resulting in a loss exceeding $690,000, as detailed by blockchain investigator ZachXBT.\n\nThe hacking method involved compromising Buterin\u2019s account and posting on his behalf, marking the introduction of Proto-Danksharding to the Ethereum platform.\n\nIn a now-infamous post, Buterin shared his intentions to release a series of commemorative NFTs from ConsenSys. Regrettably, the post included a malicious URL and was sent to his 4.9 million followers, resulting in some falling victim to the deception."
