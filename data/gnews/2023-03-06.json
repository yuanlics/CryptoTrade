        "content": "Stablecoin inflow into Ethereum (ETH) layer 2 (L2) networks increased 5% in the last seven days to over $2 billion, according to DeFillama data.\n\nArbitrum averaged a $10M inflow per day in February\n\nIn February, Arbitrum\u2019s stablecoin inflow averaged over $10 million daily as the network saw a total influx of around $300 million.\n\nThe inflows continued during the early days of March as it recorded a cumulative sum of $32.52 million. The network saw an outflow of $10.15 million during the same period.\n\nThe network\u2019s significant inflow occurred on Mar. 5 when it recorded an inflow of $16.57 million in one day.\n\nDeFillama data showed that USD Coin (USDC) accounts for 67% of all stablecoins on Arbitrum with $968.63 million. Other dominant stablecoins on the network include Tether\u2019s USDT and DAI, with a cumulative balance of $394.81 million.\n\nThe increased stablecoin inflow also coincided with a period when transaction activity on Arbitrum increased. The L2 network saw its transaction volume reach a new all-time high of 690,000 in Feb. Besides that, the increased network activity saw its transaction volume surpass Ethereum for the first time.\n\nMeanwhile, Arbitrum is the second most popular network for decentralized exchanges (DEX). For context, its total volume in the last 24 hours was $207.29 million, ahead of rivals like Polygon, Binance Smart Chain, and Optimism. However, it is miles below Ethereum, which is $1.03 billion.\n\nAccording to L2Beat, the total value of assets (TVL) locked on Arbitrum is $3.37 billion, rising 0.17% in the last seven days.\n\nOptimism stablecoin inflow rises 5% in seven days.\n\nSince the beginning of March, Optimism\u2019s (OP) stablecoin inflow increased 4.89% to $669.11 million, according to DeFillama data.\n\nOptimism\u2019s significant inflow occurred on Mar. 3 when it recorded around $6.3 million.\n\nThe increased inflow is in contrast to February when it recorded an outflow of nearly $120 million.\n\nUSDC is also the dominant stablecoin on Optimism. The Circle-issued stablecoin accounts for roughly 55% of the stablecoins on the network, with $364.56 million. The other stablecoins in the top three include Synthetix protocol\u2019s sUSD and USDT, with a combined value of $145.77 million.\n\nOptimism\u2019s TVL stands at $1.89 billion, according to L2 beats data.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "content": "\u201cCompliance\u201d would seem like an unlikely buzzword at ETHDenver, one of Ethereum\u2019s largest conferences, set literally in the \u201cWild West.\u201d\n\nBy: Owen Fernau \u2022 Loading...\n\nDive\n\n\u201cCompliance\u201d would seem like an unlikely buzzword at ETHDenver, one of Ethereum\u2019s largest conferences, set literally in the \u201cWild West.\u201d\n\nBut developers and founders have warmed up to the idea that crypto projects will need to comply with rules and regulations in order to survive.\n\nAt least seven projects participating in the event were directly involved in compliance solutions with at least five presentations addressing policy and regulation issues.\n\nOrlando Cosme, a former lawyer in the startup and venture capital space who is building a compliance solution called Lexproof, noted a change in attitude toward regulation at the conference.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s definitely a tone shift at ETHDenver compared to other events I went to last year,\u201d he told The Defiant. \u201cI think a lot of people are now accepting that there will probably have to be, for a lot of different applications, especially if the founders are in the U.S., some type of compromise.\u201d\n\nCosme named the know-your-customer (KYC) process and accredited investor verification as examples of traditional financial designations which may need to be more deeply accounted for in the crypto space.\n\nIndeed, it\u2019s clear that, amidst a flurry of regulatory actions taken against crypto, compliance has moved from a sign of betrayal of crypto\u2019s self-regulating ethos to something closer to a value proposition.\n\nAnd it makes sense \u2014 many in the crypto space are on edge after the US\u2019s Securities and Exchange Commision (SEC) took perhaps one of its strongest actions yet last month alleging that the stablecoin UST, and its sister token LUNA, are securities.\n\nSome of those who bet early on tackling the hard problems around compliance say their work is paying off.\n\n\u201cPeople laughed at us because it\u2019s f*cking hard to bring things from the real world in a legally compliant way on-chain,\u201d Maex Ament, co-founder and current board member of Centrifuge, a project built to put debt products on blockchains, told The Defiant at ETHDenver.\n\nCentrifuge started in 2017 and is seeing traction as the so-called \u201creal world asset\u201d space has shown signs of taking off \u2014 the project has facilitated over $300M in loans, according to a data dashboard by RWA.xyz.\n\nDeFi Alpha Premium Content DeFi Daily | Weekdays\n\nDeFi Alpha Letter | Weekly\n\nDefiant Podcast Transcript | Weekly\n\nInbox Dump | Saturday\n\nWeekly Recap | Sunday Looking for Alpha?

Start for free\n\nOriginating a loan using Centrifuge necessitates creating a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV), an independent legal entity, according to the project\u2019s documentation. And those looking to invest in the financing opportunities must go through a KYC and Anti-Money Laundering process.\n\nTo raise money, Centrifuge also did a traditional equity round 2017, said Ament. That was a time when the dominant funding mechanism in crypto was an initial coin offerings (ICO), a simple process whereby investorssent a major crypto asset like ETH to a project in exchange for its tokens.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s website states that some ICOs may constitute securities offerings.\n\nOther projects involved with regulatory compliance at ETHDenver included Yug Network, kycDAO, both of which are working to bring off-chain credentials like KYC, on-chain. Others like Opolis, are focusing on enabling crypto\u2019s swath of freelancers to remain or become tax compliant.\n\nAment said the team didn\u2019t think it could fight the regulation battle around ICOs. Despite the traditional raise, Centrifuge is deep into the decentralization process and is giving control of its platform over to token holders, Ament added.\n\nDavid Liebowitz, who hosts a podcast called Flywheel DeFi, thinks that stablecoins are the most important area to watch in terms of regulation in the digital asset space.\n\n\u201cStablecoins are really the first and last line of defense when it comes to regulation of all of crypto,\u201d he told The Defiant at ETHDenver. Liebowitz gave a talk on stablecoin regulation at the event and cited guidance issued by the state of New York, and also legislation drafted by the former senator Pat Toomey, as guiding lights for U.S. dollar-pegged assets.\n\nLexproof\u2019s Cosme, too, said that he thought that the stablecoin space had a higher chance of seeing new legislation drafted into law, rather than the digital asset industry as a whole.\n\nCosme isn\u2019t optimistic that the United States\u2019 legislative branch will pass new laws for the digital asset industry in the near term. \u201cCongress can pass legislation to make registration easy, in a way that makes sense for crypto companies and their business models and for their value proposition,\u201d Cosme said, but he added that, given the legislative body\u2019s current constituents, it is unlikely to push forward any laws of the sort.\n\nBoth Liebowitz and Cosme acknowledged the SEC\u2019s aggressive stance taken in regards to the crypto space \u2014 Cosme said that the general outlook among lawyers is that the federal agency isn\u2019t going to let up anytime soon.\n\nLiebowitz echoed a similar sentiment. \u201cThe SEC isn\u2019t playing around,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re really taking the mandate of protecting investors to the widest possible conclusion.\u201d\n\nIf ETHDenver is an accurate barometer, the crypto space as a whole is adapting to a more adversarial regulatory environemnt \u2014 and some are even looking to build products for it."
