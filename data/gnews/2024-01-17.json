Firstly, there were $15.03 million of ETH shorts liquidated against $5.3 million long liquidations on January 16, which coincided with the ETH/USD pair rising to highs of $2,614. Secondly, data from on-chain analytics firm Glassnode shows that Ether's share of open interest has increased from 21.8% to 26.5% since the start of the year, indicating a growing demand for ETH. Finally, on-chain metrics from Santiment show that ETH's supply on exchanges is nearing an all-time low, which could signal a move towards self-custody and staking, reducing the risk of an impending selloff. These factors suggest that ETH may outperform BTC in the short term."
