Once Dencun runs smoothly on all three testnets, the Ethereum Foundation plans to roll out the upgrade on the Ethereum mainnet by the end of Q1 2024.\n\nDencun marks the final upgrade for the Goerli testnet. Subsequently, both the client and Ethereum Foundation testing teams will discontinue support for the Goerli testnet after the completion of the Dencun upgrade.\n\nThe Dencun upgrade, known as EIP-4844, aims to increase blockchain space for data blobs and slash layer-2 rollup fees by activating proto-danksharding. This data storage expansion should scale Ethereum\u2019s blockchain, enabling more transaction capacity without hiking gas fees.\n\nRead more: ETH developers voice concern over gas limit hike proposed by Vitalik Buterin\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "content": "The sentiments around Ethereum look to be very bullish at the moment as the second-largest crypto token by market cap has seen its dominance surge against Bitcoin. Ethereum\u2019s rise against the flagship crypto token is also significant, as crypto analyst Jaydee recently suggested that it could usher in the altcoin season.\n\nBullish Predictions For Ethereum\u2019s Price\n\nCrypto analyst Ali Martinez recently highlighted the fact that Ethereum broke out from an ascending triangle on the weekly chart. According to him, the crypto token has its eyes on the $3,400 price level despite the short-term volatility. Backing Ali\u2019s analysis, crypto analyst Mayne shared their belief that $3,400 remains a viable target for ETH\u2019s price.\n\nInterestingly, Mayne hinted that \u201cETH betas\u201d could run alongside ETH when this significant price surge begins to happen. These ETH betas include tokens like the native tokens of Ethereum\u2019s layer-2 networks Optimism and Arbitrum.\n\nCrypto analyst Ash Crypto also offered a bullish prediction for ETH\u2019s price while commenting on the state of the market. He remarked that money was currently flowing from Bitcoin to Ethereum and that it shouldn\u2019t be long before the latter trades above $3,200.\n\nETH trading above the $3,000 price level looks to be the consensus going by these predictions. The CEO and founder of MN Trading, Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe, had before now suggested that ETH was also going to rise above $3,000 on its way to $3,500. Then, Poppe boldly claimed that this price prediction would materialize in the first quarter of 2024.\n\nMeanwhile, crypto analyst ColdBloodedShill stated in a recent X post that ETH is likely planning for higher prices as long as it remains above $2,400. The $2,400 price range looks to be an important support level as ETH looks to break out. Crypto analyst Bluntz Capital also highlighted that price range ($2,495 specifically) as he noted that there will be an eventual breakout as long as ETH holds above that level.\n\nETH bulls struggle at $2,500 | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nConviction On Ethereum Getting Stronger\n\nMarket intelligence platform Santiment recently revealed that the number of new ETH addresses is on the rise as Ethereum continues to outperform Bitcoin. 89.4 thousand addresses are said to have been created daily during this stretch. This represents a significant increase from late last year, when 70.4 addresses were created daily in early November.\n\nSantiment also added that ETH\u2019s supply on exchanges had reduced drastically to 8.10%, almost getting close to its all-time low (since the opening week of trading) of 8.05%. Such a development usually suggests that ETH holders are looking to hold for the long term as they move their holdings to self-custody.\n\nFeatured image from TechRadar, chart from Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "Bitcoin Backs Down: Ethereum Steals The Spotlight With Surge In Market Dominance - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Amidst the lull in the realm of Bitcoin, Ethereum emerges as a trailblazer, confidently charting its course. While the crypto king takes a breather following its ETF approval, Ethereum, undeterred, is experiencing a surge in both price and dominance, propelled by an influx of new users and the prevailing trend of self-custody.\n\nRecent data from Santiment vividly illustrates Ethereum\u2019s ascendancy. The platform\u2019s price dominance, reflecting its market share in comparison to all other cryptocurrencies, has witnessed a remarkable surge of 22.4% within a mere week.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Remarkable Surge: Growing Community, Strong On-Chain\n\nThis surge is not merely a passive spectacle; Ethereum is actively attracting an astonishing 89,400 new addresses on a daily basis, with an unprecedented 96,300 joining the Ethereum community in a single day.\n\nSource: Santiment\n\nThis momentum is not solely about acquiring new participants; it\u2019s about retention. Ethereum\u2019s exchange supply, representing the quantity readily available for sale, is approaching its historical low of 8.05%. This shift signals a notable move towards self-custody and staking, mitigating the immediate risk of a substantial selloff and fortifying Ethereum\u2019s price floor.\n\nThe on-chain strength witnessed translates into tangible market action. Following a brief dip that tested the $2,500 support, Ethereum not only stabilized but turned this once-resilient level into a launchpad.\n\nEthereum currently trading at $2,556 on the daily chart: TradingView.com\n\nAnalysts are now setting their sights on the $2,700 barrier as the gateway to unlocking a potential price surge, with FOMO (fear of missing out) traders anticipated to join the rally. Beyond this juncture, the horizon appears boundless, with $3,400 emerging as an enticing target.\n\nCaution Amid Excitement: Ethereum\u2019s Unpredictable Trajectory\n\nYet, amid the excitement, an air of caution permeates the volatile crypto landscape. A breach below the \u201chammer\u201d formation that materialized on Monday holds the potential to send Ethereum plummeting towards the 20-Day EMA (exponential moving average) at approximately $2,300.\n\nTraders are poised on tenterhooks, meticulously monitoring these crucial levels to decipher the forthcoming trajectory of Ethereum\u2019s journey.\n\nOne undeniable truth emerges: Ethereum is casting off the shadow of Bitcoin and carving out its unique path. With an increasing dominance, a fervent user base, and a focus on self-custody, Ethereum is laying the groundwork for future expansion.\n\nWhether it attains the envisioned $3,400 pinnacle or steers towards an alternate destiny, one certainty prevails\u2014Ethereum is an influential force, and its narrative is only in its nascent stages.\n\nHistory repeating itself.#Bitcoin dominance peaking before the halving and potentially marking a cycle top. Altcoins are likely to outperform coming period. pic.twitter.com/ox36x2M5NG \u2014 Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) January 15, 2024\n\nMeanwhile, in order to bolster Ethereum\u2019s increasing dominance over Bitcoin, Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe, the founder and CEO of trading company MNTrading, observed that Bitcoin was falling behind Ethereum in terms of the total market capitalization of cryptocurrencies.\n\nIn a post on X dated January 12, he included the following graphic with the caption, \u201c#Bitcoin dominance peaking before the halving and maybe signifying a cycle top.\u201d It\u2019s conceivable that altcoins will perform better in the near future.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "What Is Immutable? The Ethereum Network for Crypto and NFT Games - Decrypt",
        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nImmutable X is a layer-2 scaling network built on top of Ethereum, the leading blockchain for decentralized applications. Developed by the Web3 firm Immutable via tech created by StarkWare, Immutable X uses the native ERC-20 token IMX and hosts a number of different blockchain games on its network like Gods Unchained, Guild of Guardians, Illuvium, and Ember Sword, to name a few.\n\nWhile Ethereum proponents argue that its mainnet is among the most decentralized and secure of all cryptocurrencies, it\u2019s also historically suffered from high gas fees and long waits to make transactions. This has long caused friction with NFT creators like those behind the CryptoKitties, who once clogged the mainnet with their digital cats and made it virtually unusable.\n\nBecause NFTs\u2014unique blockchain tokens that signify ownership\u2014are currently so essential to blockchain games, it\u2019s unfeasible for most game developers to build on the Ethereum mainnet. That\u2019s where layer-2 solutions like Immutable X come in, plus Immutable is expanding with another new zkEVM scaling network ahead. Here\u2019s what you need to know about the Immutable platform.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhat is Immutable X?\n\nImmutable X is a gaming-focused protocol that\u2019s built atop the Ethereum mainnet\u2019s security, but with the speed and lower transaction costs of a layer-2 scaling network. In other words, it provides additional benefits on top of the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nAccording to Immutable X\u2019s whitepaper, the network allows users to make transactions with zero gas fees. This is partly possible due to Immutable X\u2019s use of StarkWare\u2019s ZK rollup technology which bundles transactions and can enable over 9,000 NFT transactions per second.\n\nWho created Immutable X?\n\nImmutable is the main Web3 firm behind the Immutable X protocol. The company is part blockchain developer and part game publisher, as Immutable developed the NFT card-battling game Gods Unchained and is publishing the action role-playing game Guild of Guardians.\n\nPer Crunchbase data, Immutable has raised nearly $280 million in funding from 32 investors as of January 2024, with firms like Tencent, GameStop Digital Ventures, King River Capital, and the now-defunct Alameda Research investing.\n\nHow does Immutable X work?\n\nImmutable X supports all Ethereum wallets, such as MetaMask and Coinbase Wallet. Users can also create an Immutable Passport to transact on the network. Immutable Passport is designed to be a streamlined and more approachable crypto wallet for gamers, plus it provides a unified identity across games.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe protocol itself sits on top of the Ethereum mainnet, allowing for Immutable X to leverage the mainnet\u2019s decentralization and security for finalizing transactions. But because Immutable X uses ZK rollups, its transactions on its layer-2 network are still able to be fast and cost-effective.\n\nImmutable has built multiple REST application programming interfaces (APIs), meaning they are APIs that adhere to a specific set of architectural standards. Immutable\u2019s REST APIs mean that transactions can consist of an API call, which takes less time than engaging with a protocol directly via a smart contract.\n\nWho's using Immutable X?\n\nA number of different NFT marketplaces and game developers have chosen to offer their products and services on ImmutableX. In June 2022, Immutable Ventures established a massive $500 million fund to invest in Web3 gaming projects being built on Immutable X and to also provide various developers with grant-based funding.\n\nRarible, Mintable, NFTrade, TokenTrove, OKX, and Kinguin are NFT marketplaces that use Immutable X. Brick-and-mortar video game retailer GameStop also launched its NFT marketplace on Immutable X in 2022, but has since discontinued its own crypto wallet and has said that it will shut down its marketplace in February 2024.\n\nGames like IMVU, Guild of Guardians, Habbo, Cross the Ages, Undead Blocks, Ember Sword, Planet Quest, Gods Unchained, WAGMI Defense, and Tiny Colony are building their Web3 elements on Immutable X.\n\nAs the world of Web3 gaming heats up, Immutable X faces competition with other blockchains like Polygon, Avalanche, Arbitrum Nova, Sui, and Solana to offer a fast and seamless gaming experience.\n\nWhat is Immutable zkEVM?\n\nImmutable is developing more than just Immutable X as its Ethereum gaming platform expands. In March 2023, the firm announced that it is working with competitor Polygon to develop a new Immutable zkEVM scaling network that combines Polygon zkEVM technology with Immutable\u2019s gaming platform.\n\nA number of games have already announced that they\u2019ll be using the Immutable zkEVM, from MetalCore to Shardbound and Elemental Knights. According to an Immutable blog post, the zkEVM network provides native compatibility with Ethereum Virtual Machine smart contracts, potentially making it easier for developers to port over from EVM chains and utilize an array of third-party tools.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAs the Immutable platform grows, the IMX token has become the most valuable gaming token as of this writing, with a market cap of nearly $2.7 billion. That makes it the 37th largest overall cryptocurrency by market cap according to data from CoinGecko, as of January 17, 2024.\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

        "title": "The Protocol: MetaMask's Secret Weapon and Ethereum's Dencun Debacle - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Last month, our feature in The Protocol highlighted how the blockchain design principle of \" intents \" was gaining ascendancy among developers on the industry's cutting edge. This week our Sam Kessler is back with a scoop on how the popular crypto wallet MetaMask, from the Ethereum developer Consensys, has quietly deployed a version of an intents-based routing mechanism that could revolutionize how users interact with blockchains.\n\nWe've also got:\n\nA post-mortem on Ethereum's unexpectedly ugly Dencun upgrade on the Goerli test network.\n\nReactions to Vitalik Buterin's proposed \"gas limit\" increase.\n\nJob cuts at NEAR Foundation as new CEO Illia \"Black Dragon\" Polosukhin goes to work.\n\nHighlights from this week's Protocol Village column on blockchain project updates, featuring Taiko, Chainlink, Hedera, Lagrange and Hacken.\n\nNetwork news\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin. (CoinDesk)\n\nMOORE IS MORE. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin , the de facto high priest of the world's largest smart-contracts blockchain, tossed out last week on a Reddit \"Ask Me Anything\" that it would be \"reasonable\" to raise the network's \"gas limit\" \u2013 a very technical way of referring to the amount of transactions that can get jammed into each new block . He suggested an increase to \"40M or so,\" implying a 33% increase over the current limit of 30 million gas. (Yes, for the underinitiated, a unit of gas, in this context, is just\u2026 a gas .) The main reason this is now possible, according to Buterin, is Moore's law \u2013 the observation that computing power seems to double every year . That's relevant because of the amount of data that it takes to store Ethereum's \"state\" \u2013 the complete record of the blockchain's history; as computers become more powerful, they should theoretically be able to handle the higher transaction capacity \u2013 potentially helping to reduce fees for end-users. \"There appears to be a constructive willingness to explore this topic further,\" analysts at Coinbase Institutional wrote. But some members of the Ethereum community have raised yellow flags. P\u00e9ter Szil\u00e1gyi, an Ethereum developer, tweeted that such an increase could slow the network's \"sync time.\" Galaxy Research's Christine Kim wrote in a weekly newsletter that \"larger blocks would certainly increase block propagation latency and potentially result in a higher number of missed blocks. \" Marius van der Wijden, an Ethereum software developer, estimated that the network's state is currently around 87 gigabytes (GB), and growing at 2 GB per month. That would put it at 111 GB in a year and 207 GB in five years. In an era where a 1 terabyte thumb drive can be bought on Amazon.com for $19.99 , it doesn't sound too terribly daunting. \"The problem here is not the size itself,\" van der Wijden wrote. \"Everyone will be able to store that amount of data. However, accessing and modifying it will become slower and slower.\" One thing there seems to be some agreement on: It's worth waiting a bit to observe the impact of the upcoming \" Dencun \" upgrade on the network, which will introduce a new way of storing data as \"blobs,\" effectively providing a capacity increase .\n\nStory continues\n\nBLACK DRAGON BREATHES FIRE: Just two months after NEAR Protocol co-founder Illia Polosukhin took over as CEO of the supporting NEAR Foundation, he announced drastic cuts last week in the organization's workforce \u2013 impacting 35 colleagues, or a 40% reduction. According to Polosukhin, the decision came after a \"thorough review of the foundation's activities,\" resulting in feedback that \"the foundation has not always been as effective as it could be.\" Polosukhin noted that the financial picture remains sound, with over $285 million in \"fiat\" or government-issued currencies and 305 million NEAR tokens \"worth over $1B,\" along with $70 million of investments and loans. Referred to in the foundation's communications as the \" Black Dragon ,\" Polosukhin may be under pressure to breathe new life into the alternative layer-1 blockchain, which ranks 32nd among networks based on the much-watched metric of total value locked, or TVL, according to DeFi Llama . Notably NEAR is trying some fresh strategies, pivoting last year to serve as a \" data availability \" network and cutting a deal with restaking pioneer EigenLabs to create a \" fast finality layer \" for Ethereum layer-2 networks.\n\nONE BETTER THAN TWO: The Binance-incubated BNB Chain ecosystem has announced a plan called \" Fusion \" that will see the original BNB Beacon Chain decommissioned while reinforcing the primacy of the sister BNB Smart Chain. According to a statement on the open-source software platform GitHub, the proposal will help to \"overcome legacy services and technical debt, enabling faster iteration and development.\" According to the newsletter Wu Blockchain , \"BNB Beacon Chain is set to exit the stage within the next six months.\"\n\nALSO:\n\nImage tweeted early Wednesday by Ethereum's Tim Beiko with the comment,\n\nEthereum\u2019s Dencun upgrade went live on the Goerli test network early Wednesday but failed to finalize in the expected time. Developers expect the apparent issues to be fixed in the coming days. These likely occurred due to low participation and validators not upgrading parts of their software that would have helped with finalization. ( Link ) Interoperability service Socket and its bridging platform, Bungee, restarted operations after an apparent $3.3M exploit led to a temporary pause in trading activity. A wallet connected to the exploit believed to be the attackers' holds nearly $3 million in ether (ETH) and $300,000 worth of other tokens. ( Link ) Vivek Ramaswamy, crypto-friendly U.S. presidential candidate, suspended his campaign. ( Link ) The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission issued a statement on the hack of its X account and the resulting fake Bitcoin ETF approval announcement. ( Link ) Venezuela has reportedly ended its controversial Petro cryptocurrency. ( Link ) Moody's, the bond-rating service, said tokenized fund adoption is growing but brings the risk of \"technological failure.\" ( Link ) Solana Mobile plans to launch a second smartphone, after its predecessor, Saga, sold out quickly once opportunistic crypto traders realized it came with an allocation of BONK tokens that more than covered the price of the device. ( Link ) Uri Kolodny, CEO of StarkWare, the developer behind the Ethereum layer-2 network Starknet, announced he is stepping down due to a family health issue. ( Link ) Taproot Wizards, the Bitcoin Ordinals project led by influencers Udi Wertheimer and Eric Wall that raised an astonishing $7.5M last year, is now moving forward with its first sale of a collection , Quantum Cats.\n\nProtocol Village\n\nHighlighting blockchain tech upgrades and developments.\n\n1. Taiko , developing a so-called type-1 zkEVM to help scale the Ethereum blockchain, announced the launch of \"Katla,\" its alpha-6 testnet, according to a message from the team: \"Katla is laying the foundation for Taiko's mainnet launch in 2024.\"2. Parallel Network has officially launched on mainnet and is open to developers, according to the team , claiming to be the first layer-2 network on Arbitrum Orbit to go live. \"It is also the first non-custodial omni-chain margin protocol, which allows liquidity to be pooled across multiple chains and makes it immediately available on the Parallel Network.\"\n\n3. Chainlink\u2019s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) has integrated Circle\u2019s Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP) to make it easy for users to transfer USDC across chains, according to a press release. Developers can now build cross-chain use cases via CCIP that involve cross-chain transfers of USDC, including payments and other DeFi interactions, the statement said.\n\n4. The Hedera Council announced its newest member, the electronics maker Hitachi America, Ltd. (Hitachi). According to the team: \"Hitachi aims to begin creating proof-of-concepts for end-to-end supply chain and sustainability solutions on Hedera in the next year.\"\n\n5. Lagrange Labs, developer of a blockchain proving system based on zero-knowledge cryptography, has integrated its light client protocol, Lagrange State Committees (LSC), for the Ethereum layer-2 network Mantle, according to the team . LSCs \"are a ZK light client protocol for optimistic rollups (ORUs), designed through combining Lagrange\u2019s ZK MapReduce Coprocessor and EigenLayer restaking. Each state committee borrows security from Ethereum by dual staking, both through EigenLayer restaking and with the rollup\u2019s native token.\"\n\n6. Hacken, a blockchain security auditor, has introduced an open-source Rust library for code coverage generation for WASM-based protocols, according to the team: \"Code Coverage utilities are crucial for automation testing to ascertain the thoroughness of code examination. Without it, some critical components can remain untested. While it is available for Ethereum-based projects, WASM-based protocols don't have it. Wasmcov by Hacken is already integrated into the Radix ecosystem, which enables all Radix-built projects to utilize code coverage measurement. The next protocol to get it will be NEAR. The rest can set it up manually.\"\n\nSee the entire Protocol Village list from this past week here.\n\nMetaMask\u2019s Secret \u2018Intents\u2019 Project Could Radically Change How Users Interact With Blockchains\n\nMetaMask has quietly rolled out a limited version of its new routing tech into the new Smart Swaps feature. (MetaMask, modified by CoinDesk)\n\nMetaMask, the most popular crypto wallet on Ethereum, is testing a new \"transaction routing\" technology that's likely to have major ramifications for how value flows through the second-biggest blockchain network.\n\nCoinDesk learned of the new technology from developers briefed on the plan, and key details were subsequently confirmed by officials with MetaMask's parent company, Consensys.\n\nThe effort capitalizes on a concept known in blockchain circles as \" intents \" that is rapidly gaining momentum, potentially leading to a radical shift in how people interact with blockchains: Rather than specifying how they want to get something done (e.g. \"sell X tokens on Y exchange for Z price\"), blockchain users may only need to specify what they want the outcome to be (e.g. \"I want the best price for my tokens\").\n\nThe \"what\" versus \"how\" distinction might seem subtle, but it's a big departure from how MetaMask and other crypto wallets worked originally \u2013 as neutral, relatively simple pieces of software for connecting users to blockchains. The goal with the new tech is for users to get better execution on their transactions and improved ease of use, but intent-based programs ultimately represent a big shift to where \u2013 and to whom \u2013 value flows on blockchains.\n\nThe new technology is being built by Special Mechanisms Group (SMG), a blockchain infrastructure firm that MetaMask owner Consensys purchased last year.\n\nRead the full story by Sam Kessler here\n\nMoney Center\n\nFundraisings\n\nRenzo , an interface for the liquid restaking protocol EigenLayer , has raised $3.2M, according to the team: \"Maven11 led the Renzo seed round which also saw follow-on investments from Figment Capital, SevenX, IOSG and Paper Ventures.\"\n\nHashKey Group , which operates the Hong Kong-based crypto exchange, has \u201cnearly\u201d met its $100 million fundraising target, the firm said Tuesday. HashKey announced the fundraising round in August, shortly after it won a license from Hong Kong\u2019s security regulator to offer retail crypto trading . The firm did not disclose the investors in the round and now claims a valuation of $1.2 billion post-raise, giving it \u201cunicorn\u201d status.\n\nBitfinity Network , a Web3 infrastructure firm, announced it has successfully secured over $7 million in funding from notable backers, including Polychain Capital and ParaFi Capital, advancing its mission to establish off-chain infrastructure for Bitcoin and Ordinals.\n\nDeals and Grants\n\nPush Protocol , the communication protocol of Web3, recently concluded their Billion Reasons to Build (BRB) developer tour in India, according to the team: \"During the hackathon, Aditya Bisht successfully solved one of its hardest coding challenges belonging to the Ethereum Foundation \u2013 quantum proofing the Ethereum Network. Bisht's creation of an account abstraction smart contract effectively conceals public keys, enhancing the network's defense against quantum decryption.\"\n\nThe Hedera and Algorand ecosystems have joined to Form DeRec Alliance. (DeRec stands for \"decentralized recovery.\") According to the team: \"Entities from across the Hedera and Algorand ecosystems including the HBAR Foundation, Algorand Foundation, Hashgraph Association, Swirlds Labs, and DLT Science Foundation, along with industry partners The Building Blocks and BankSocial, are partnering to develop a new interoperability recovery standard which will simplify the recovery & adoption of crypto and other assets.\"\n\nSui , a layer-1 blockchain, is getting DePIN and DeWi through a groundbreaking partnership with Karrier One, according to the team: \"The deal also includes strategic investment from Sui to fuel the expansion of Karrier One\u2019s global footprint and deployment on Sui. The technical integration will feature DePIN services powered by the Sui blockchain and the launch of a Karrier One Decentralized Wireless (DeWi) network token on Sui.\"\n\nData and Tokens\n\nAmong Major Layer-2 Networks, ZkSync Era Has the Cheapest Average Transactions\n\nWe finally got around to reading Messari analyst Seth Bloomberg's excellent report out a few weeks ago titled, \" The Onchain Economics of ZK Rollups .\" It provides a good snapshot of the competition between major Ethereum layer-2 networks as 2023 closed out. The report reinforced the oft-repeated observation that \"Data publishing (or data availability) generally remains the highest on-chain cost for rollups\" \u2013 thus underscoring the significance of Ethereum's upcoming \"Dencun\" upgrade, which is supposed to lead to drastic reductions in those expenses. But there are different ways to handle the data, of course, and the zkSync Era project stands out in that it \"only posts state diffs to Ethereum,\" while most rollup networks \"publish the full rollup transaction data.\" Per the report: \"In simple terms, publishing state diffs means that if two users send ETH and other tokens to each other multiple times, only the net differences in their account balances need to be published to Ethereum instead of the full transaction history between the two users.\" The upshot? ZkSync Era has the lowest average transaction costs, at 18 cents, seen as a nice bargain compared with Polygon zkEVM's 45 cents.\n\nCalendar"

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s Dencun Upgrade Deployed Successfully on Goerli Testnet\n\nEthereum's core developers have taken a significant step towards improving the network's scalability with the deployment of the Dencun upgrade on the Goerli testnet on January 24, 2024, at around 1:35 a.m. ET. However, the upgrade faced issues in the validator clients' ability to sync with each other.\n\nParithosh Jayanthi, DevOps engineer at the Ethereum Foundation, later announced that the fix was patched in and the Dencun fork on Goerli was finalized. In preparation for this transition, the development team has opted for a phased approach, initially implementing the upgrade on various testnets.\n\nThe successful deployment on the Goerli testnet marks the first phase of a gradual rollout, with subsequent implementations planned for the Sepolia and Holesky testnets before the final mainnet release in Q1 2024.\n\nThe Dencun upgrade introduces EIP-4844, a novel transaction mechanism known as ephemeral blobs or proto-danksharding. This approach allows Ethereum nodes to temporarily store and access off-chain data, reducing storage demands and lowering transaction costs. By reducing transaction costs, EIP-4844 will make it more affordable to use Ethereum dApps and Layer 2 solutions.\n\nThe Dencun upgrade is a positive development for the Ethereum ecosystem, bringing the network closer to enhanced scalability and lower transaction costs. The phased rollout approach minimizes risks and allows for thorough testing, ensuring a successful transition to the upgraded network.\n\nLet us know what you loved about this article, what could be improved, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form."

        "content": "A recent conversation with Vitalik Buterin on X platform sheds light on a few important topics regarding L2 networks \u2013 the main scalability tool for the Ethereum network.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt its core, an L2 solution is a secondary framework or protocol built atop the Ethereum blockchain, designed to increase transaction capacity and speed without compromising the security provided by the main chain, known as layer 1 (L1). This conversation is vital because it helps users understand the types of solutions available and their respective tradeoffs.\n\nYeah I agree with this. I called them \"security-favoring\" vs \"scale-favoring\" here, but we can probably come up with better terms (\"strong L2\" vs \"light L2\" perhaps?)https://t.co/oSPZkB3Xo3 \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) January 16, 2024\n\nButerin participated in a discussion clarifying that \"L2s\" encompass both rollups and validiums. The distinction is important for users to grasp the different security and scalability features. Rollups are \"security-favoring\" solutions that bundle or \"roll up\" transactions into a single proof, which is posted to the main chain.\n\nThis process allows for high security, as the L1 blockchain directly secures them. In contrast, validiums are \"scale-favoring,\" designed to boost capacity by storing data off-chain but with proofs still on-chain, offering slightly less security for much greater scalability.\n\nThe distinction is nuanced but significant. While rollups are more expensive due to the data being posted on-chain, they offer higher security. Validiums, on the other hand, provide a cheaper alternative, with a slight tradeoff in security. Buterin suggests that the terminology should reflect these differences without delegitimizing either option. In the spectrum of L2 solutions, he proposes terms like \"strong L2\" for rollups and \"light L2\" for validiums to help users navigate their choices better.\n\nInterestingly, Buterin also points out that the architecture of L2 solutions is not strictly about security levels. He previously attempted to categorize these layers but recognized that there is a significant \"intermediate space\" between rollups and validiums, further complicating the classification."

This shift in market dynamics is linked to the anticipation of potential approvals for spot ETH ETFs.\n\n6/ The next major crypto events are BTC halving (mid-Apr), and potential ETH Spot ETF approvals from May. In the meantime, crypto might take some direction from macroeconomic events. \u2014 QCP Capital (@QCPCapital) January 17, 2024\n\nRecently, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved multiple spot Bitcoin ETFs, following which Ether\u2019s value saw an uptick of over 5%. In contrast, Bitcoin\u2019s price experienced a decline of more than 6% during the same period.\n\nQCP Capital analysts project that Ethereum\u2019s upward trajectory is likely to persist, especially with the narrative shifting toward the likelihood of ETH spot ETF approvals. Furthermore, the report highlights a notable ETH/BTC exchange rate increase, rising from 0.05 to 0.06 within a week.\n\nYou might also like: QCP Capital doubted market hype after spot Bitcoin ETFs launch\n\nUpcoming significant events in the crypto space, such as Bitcoin\u2019s halving in mid-April and potential spot Ethereum ETF approvals starting from May, are also expected to impact market trends.\n\nThe potential for a spot Ether ETF gained further momentum following remarks from BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, who acknowledged the value of such a product in the United States. BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, had previously filed with the SEC for a spot Ethereum ETF in November, following its application for a spot Bitcoin ETF in June.\n\nThe percentage of Ether\u2019s circulating supply in profit has also risen over the past week, reaching a multi-year high of 91.8%. Bitcoin has decreased to 86.2%, indicating growing investor confidence in Ethereum compared to Bitcoin.\n\nRead more: QCP Capital optimistic about spot BTC and ETH ETFs\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "content": "While the Bitcoin price has been consolidating largely post-ETF approval, Ethereum (ETH) has been making strong upside moves, thereby closing the gap with BTC. At press time, the Ethereum price is trading 1.44% up at a price of $2,564 with a market cap of $308 billion.\n\nThe Ethereum Price Dominance\n\nAccording to insights provided by on-chain data provider Santiment, Ethereum\u2019s price dominance has experienced a notable surge against Bitcoin, marking a +22.4% increase over the past week. This period has witnessed the creation of 89.4K new Ethereum addresses per day, further underscoring the platform\u2019s growing traction. Notably, a staggering 96.3K wallets were created just yesterday.\n\nadvertisement\n\nIn addition to these on-chain activities, Santiment\u2019s data reveals a significant trend in Ethereum\u2019s supply on exchanges, nearing its All-Time Low of 8.05%. This movement toward self-custody and staking implies a reduced risk of an imminent selloff, presenting a more favorable scenario compared to concerns arising from a rising supply on exchanges. These on-chain dynamics shed light on Ethereum\u2019s current market strength and its potential implications for future price movements.\n\nETH Price Action Going Ahead\n\nIn the recent trading session on Tuesday, Ethereum price initially experienced a slight pullback, testing the crucial $2,500 level. Notably, this level had previously served as significant resistance but now appears to be providing substantial support for the cryptocurrency. The price action suggests Ethereum\u2019s attempt to enter a consolidation phase.\n\nThe $2,700 level emerges as a key threshold, representing the upper boundary of the short-term trading range. Analysts consider this level crucial, and a breakthrough could set the stage for a potential market surge, with Fear of Missing Out (FOMO) traders likely to join the rally. Beyond $2,700, the Ethereum price could further rally all the way to $3,400.\n\nConversely, a downside scenario could unfold if the second-largest crypto by market cap breaks below the hammer formed during the Monday session. In such a case, the cryptocurrency might see a downward movement toward the 20-Day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), situated around the $2,300 level. Traders are closely monitoring these critical levels, anticipating potential shifts in Ethereum\u2019s short-term trajectory."

This surge in Inscriptions contributed to a concurrent increase in gas usage on the network.\n\nThe influx of addresses, attracted to the network through Inscriptions, could positively impact Ethereum by enhancing its overall activity and engagement.\n\nInscriptions made up 77% of Ethereum txs for a few hours yesterday, a first for the L1 src: https://t.co/q6ZUx8QT6v pic.twitter.com/vDoflH0ko2 \u2014 hildobby (@hildobby_) January 15, 2024\n\nHowever, amidst this positive development, Ethereum could face a challenge in the form of significant staked ETH redemptions.\n\nAccording to an X (formerly Twitter) post, the start of January saw the largest staked ETH redemption since the Shanghai Upgrade. Notably, a substantial 656,200 ETH was fully withdrawn.\n\nEven though the unstaking was a result of the behavior of bankrupt crypto lender Celsius and staking service provider Figment, this withdrawal could potentially impact Ethereum\u2019s staking ecosystem and affect market dynamics.\n\nLast week was the largest staked ETH redemption (Excl. Rewards) since the Shanghai Upgrade with 656.2k ETH (~$1.6B) being fully withdrawn 85% of the withdrawal is contributed by Figment + Celsius https://t.co/Xr8RWPWBPH pic.twitter.com/8yY4BE3RB3 \u2014 Tom Wan (@tomwanhh) January 15, 2024\n\nProgress on the development front\n\nLooking ahead, Ethereum is gearing up for the Dencun upgrade. In the next 24 hours, the Dencun upgrade will be deployed on the Goerli testnet. This upgrade introduces blobs to the testnet which is also known as \u201cprotodanksharding.\u201d\n\nThis introduction aims to reduce Layer 2 transaction fees, which can help Ethereum in terms of scalability and cost-effectiveness.\n\nGoerli is forking this Wednesday (or Tuesday night, for parts of the world!).

Over the last 24 hours, ETH experienced a decrease of 0.28%.\n\nDespite the price decline, the MVRV ratio continued to grow. This signaled that a significant number of addresses were holding profitable positions.\n\nWhile this might incentivize some addresses to sell their ETH, potentially impacting the price negatively, the Long/Short difference provided a contrasting perspective.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nThe growing Long/Short difference suggested a higher number of long-term holders compared to short-term holders.\n\nLong-term holders, being less likely to sell, can contribute to price stability and resilience in the face of short-term market fluctuations."

Layer 2 is a different blockchain that extends Ethereum.\n\nL2 solution is designed to improve transaction capacity and pace without compromising on the security which is facilitated by the main chain layer1.

The users need to understand the different security features where rollups are \u201csecurity-favoring\u201d solutions that bundle or \u201croll up\u201d transactions into a single proof, which is posted to the main chain. This methodology enables high security, as the L1 blockchain instantly secures them.\n\nComparatively, rollups are a bit expensive due to their ability to its data on-chain which provides higher security on the other hand Validiums provide an inexpensive alternate option to rollups. The founder of Ethereum Vitalik has suggested that terminology should reflect these distinctions without delegitimizing either option. In the spectrum of L2 solutions, he suggests terms like \u201cstrong L2\u201d for rollups and \u201clight L2\u201d for validiums to enable users to guide their choices better.\n\nVitalik also cleared that the whole process of L2 solution is not only about security as both rollups and Validiums have \u201cintermediate space\u201d."

        "content": "David Schwartz, the CTO of Ripple, recently addressed concerns surrounding the missing genesis block on the XRP Ledger (XRPL), citing a similar case with Ethereum.\n\nSchwartz made the latest disclosures while responding to questions raised by community member MetaMan regarding the XRP Ledger\u2019s seemingly unusual start at block 32,569.\n\nMetaMan voiced skepticism and emphasized the importance of transparency for XRP holders. \u201cTell me, is there any blockchain that lost its genesis block,\u201d the XRP community member asked Schwartz on X.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nSimilar Case with Ethereum\n\nIn response, the Ripple CTO drew a parallel to Ethereum\u2019s genesis block ambiguity. He highlighted that Ethereum, despite having transactions predating its official start, does not publicly document them.\n\nThe choice of what to consider the genesis block is arbitrary. For example, ETH has lots of transactions before its genesis block that are not in the publicly available record. 1/2 \u2014 David \"JoelKatz\" Schwartz (@JoelKatz) January 16, 2024\n\nSchwartz pointed to a specific 2,622 ETH transaction on Aug. 3, 2016, moving over $6 million. He questioned, \u201cWhere did that ETH come from? Where\u2019s the transaction that explains it?\u201d\n\nAn XRP community member referenced transactions showing 40,000 ETH transferred during Ethereum\u2019s genesis block.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nSchwartz acknowledged this but stressed that the source of those 40,000 ETH was not publicly visible due to deliberate decisions in defining Ethereum\u2019s genesis block.\n\nSchwartz argued that such decisions, including XRPL\u2019s genesis block starting at ledger 32,569, were arbitrary. He contended that similar choices, like those made in Ethereum\u2019s case, aimed to obscure fund sources.\n\nWhen asked if the 40,000 ETH tokens \u201cjust showed up out of thin air,\u201d the Ripple CTO emphasized that, from the public blockchain perspective, they did. However, he stressed that Ethereum insiders possess more information on the matter.\n\nNonetheless, in the case of the XRP Ledger, being one of the original architects, Schwartz confirmed that the genesis ledger of the chain had no transactions. However, according to him, the first 32,570 ledgers contained 534 transactions, which are presumably lost now.\n\nBefore Schwartz\u2019s response to MetaMan\u2019s initial question, Mayukha Vadari, a Senior Software Developer at RippleX, explained the reason behind the loss of genesis block.\n\nShe noted that the initial set of XRPL servers experienced uniform configuration and simultaneous memory depletion, leading to ledger issues.\n\nSustained Concerns Around the XRPL Genesis Block\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time the genesis block\u2019s peculiarity has been questioned. Critics, in the past, raised concerns about the distribution scheme of XRP, suggesting hidden motives behind the absence of earlier ledgers. Schwartz has consistently debunked such notions.\n\nAn XRP holder asked a similar question in the Bitcoin Stack Exchange forum in October 2013, a year after the XRP Ledger went live. He sought to know the reason behind starting the network at block 32,570.\n\nSchwartz responded to this query, noting that a bug affected Ripple servers, causing ledger headers to be lost.\n\nDespite efforts to collect data, insufficient information hindered ledger reconstruction. He reassured the user that the missing ledgers (1 \u2013 32,570) held no significance for average XRPL users.\n\nMoreover, in a post from December 2019, Schwartz provided a broader historical perspective, emphasizing the XRP Ledger\u2019s evolution since its live debut in June 2012. According to him, after the ledger went live, it featured bugs which they had to fix.\n\nSchwartz confirmed that, as a result of some of these bugs and reset exercises carried out on the network, data from the XRP Ledger\u2019s first week, stored in ledgers 1 \u2013 32,570, was lost. However, he assured that they did not recreate the initial 100 billion XRP supply upon the resets."

        "content": "Ethereum Completes Dencun Network Upgrade on Goerli Testnet\n\nEthereum has successfully implemented the Dencun network upgrade on the Goerli testnet.\n\nOn Jan. 17, Ethereum\u2019s developers have deployed the previously announced Dencun upgrade, succeeding the Shapella upgrade (also known as the Shanghai upgrade) in 2023.\n\nThe Dencun upgrade prominently features the implementation of EIP-4844, known as proto-danksharding. Proto-danksharding, as the main component, allows for the temporary storage of off-chain data, easing the storage demands on Ethereum nodes.\n\nThis development is anticipated to significantly lower transaction fees for decentralized applications (dApps), particularly benefiting Layer 2 rollup chains.\n\nDencun is Goerli Testnet\u2019s Last Upgrade\n\nAccording to the Ethereum core team, the Dencun upgrade will be the last upgrade for the Goerli testnet, Ethereum\u2019s first multi-client testnet, before the developers stop supporting it.\n\n\u201cEither three months after the Goerli Dencun activation, or one month after the Dencun mainnet activation, whichever comes later, teams will begin exiting their validators,\u201d said the team. \u201cAnyone relying on Goerli as a stable testnet should migrate elsewhere prior to this.\u201d\n\n\u201cApplication and tooling developers are encouraged to use Sepolia to test decentralized applications, smart contracts, and other EVM functionality,\u201d said the team. \u201cStakers and infrastructure providers concerned with protocol-level testing are encouraged to use the newly launched Holesky testnet.\u201d\n\nThe upgrade is named \u201cDencun\u201d as it combines the naming conventions for Ethereum\u2019s consensus and execution layer upgrades. Consensus layer upgrades are typically named after stars, while execution layer upgrades follow the names of Devcon city locations.\n\n\u201cDencun\u201d merges \u201cDeneb,\u201d a first-magnitude star in the Cygnus constellation, with \u201cCancun,\u201d the host city for Devcon 3, reflecting the collaborative nature of the upgrade across both layers of Ethereum\u2019s architecture.\n\nThe upgrade was livestreamed by the developers. If no major issues are found following the Goerli implementation, it will be deployed to Sepolia and Holesky.\n\nButerin Says Validiums are Not Genuine Rollup Solutions\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has recently sparked a debate about the classification of layer 2 scaling solutions, particularly focusing on Ethereum\u2019s validiums. Buterin asserts that validiums, which use off-chain data storage, should not be considered true rollup solutions.\n\nValidiums, while offering scalability through zero-knowledge proofs for off-chain transactions, face challenges in terms of data availability, differing from ZK-rollups which post full transaction data on the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nThe discussion in the Ethereum community regarding the evolution and categorization of its scaling solutions has become increasingly relevant as Ethereum now moves forward with its Dencun upgrade."

        "content": "Over the past 30 days, Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency, has experienced a notable surge of 17%, outperforming Bitcoin (BTC), which has recorded a surge of 2.5% over the same period.\n\nThis comes as the initial excitement surrounding the approval of the exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) appears to have waned, with BTC witnessing a 5% drop in the past seven days.\n\nInterestingly, according to crypto trading firm QCP Capital, following the approval of Bitcoin ETFs, the focus has shifted to the potential launch of an ETH spot ETF, which could be one of the factors for Ethereum outperforming BTC.\n\nEthereum Gains Ground Against BTC\n\nAccording to QCP Capital, the total volumes transacted across all 11 ETFs in the past week have reached $9.8 billion. The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) alone accounted for $4.6 billion.\n\nSince converting from a Trust to an ETF, GBTC has experienced outflows of $1.17 billion. This is \u201cunsurprising\u201d for the firm, considering GBTC had been trading at a discount since 2020, offering investors an opportunity to exit at par value.\n\nBTC initially surged to a high of $49,100 upon ETF approval but has since seen a decline, consolidating above the $40,000 support level. Volumes have slowed since the initial launch, and market attention is focused on GBTC outflows.\n\nMeanwhile, ETHBTC, which traded below 0.05, has seen an upward trend to 0.06. According to QCP Capital, Ethereum is anticipated to continue to outperform Bitcoin in the medium term as the narrative shifts towards potential ETH Spot ETF approvals.\n\nBitcoin Forward Contract Yields Decrease\n\nFollowing the launch of the BTC spot ETF, BTC forward contracts have experienced a greater decline compared to ETH forward contracts. BTC 1-month forward fell from 32% annualized to 9% (-23%), while ETH 1-month forward decreased from 28% to 12% (-16%).\n\nAccording to QCP Capital, despite declining yields, ETH forwards still appear attractive, offering 11-13% annualized returns. Additionally, selling ETH 1-month 2200 Puts presents a viable option with yields above 21% annually, and it could be a suitable level to buy in the event of a dip upon potential ETH spot ETF approvals.\n\nUltimately, the crypto firm suggests that the forthcoming BTC halving in mid-April and the potential approval of ETH Spot ETFs from May are anticipated to be significant events for the crypto market.\n\nIn the interim, market movements may also be influenced by macroeconomic events. The January Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, as well as the February Non-Farm Payrolls (NFP) and Consumer Price Index (CPI) reports, are being closely monitored for insights.\n\nThe pace of the balance sheet runoff, discussed briefly in December 2023, is expected to provide further clarity during the January FOMC meeting. The market consensus suggests a slowdown in quantitative tightening (QT), but the timing and extent of these changes remain uncertain.\n\nOverall, the potential launch of an Ethereum spot ETF has sparked speculation and could have a transformative impact on the Ethereum ecosystem. As the market grapples with changing dynamics, attention remains on key events, such as the BTC halving and potential ETH Spot ETF approvals.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock, chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

The trading firm specializing in digital assets and cryptocurrencies shared the report on a Telegram group with 11,000 subscribers.\n\nDespite not mentioning a \u2018flippening,\u2019 QCP Capital mentioned the positive results of a previous report on ETH paired against BTC. Moreover, the trading firm forecasts Ethereum to continue outperforming the leading cryptocurrency due to ETH spot ETF expectations.\n\n\u201cWhen ETHBTC traded below 0.05, we mentioned that the cross looked attractive from both a technical perspective and with ETH as a catchup play. ETHBTC has since traded higher to 0.06. We expect ETH to continue outperforming BTC over the medium term as the narrative rotates to potential ETH Spot ETF approvals.\u201d \u2014 QCP Capital Broadcast\n\nQCP Market update \u2013 17 Jan 24. Source: CQP Capital Broadcast\n\nCould an Ethereum spot ETF approval cause the flippening?\n\nThe narrative started boiling after an interview with Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock Inc. (NYSE: BLK), on CNBC. In particular, Fink explained that BlackRock sees value in tokenization and believes the SEC will approve an Ethereum spot ETF.\n\nNotably, Bitcoin has surged by nearly 150% since January 2, 2023, until its current price of $42,418. Rumors and expectations on a Bitcoin spot ETF approval gained traction during this period while the market was pricing it.\n\nBTC/USD weekly price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nA similar price action on Ethereum would put the leading Web3, and dominating DeFi blockchain, at above $6,235. This would drive ETH capitalization to around $750 billion, still nearly $100 billion lower than Bitcoin\u2019s current market cap. Therefore, would not be enough for a \u2018flippening,\u2019 even if BTC kept its $830 billion value by press time.\n\nETH/USD weekly price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nNevertheless, QCP Capital is still optimistic about a medium-term outperformance for the second-largest cryptocurrency over the largest one. According to the trading firm analysis, ETH could offer a better risk-reward for 2024\u2019s investors.\n\nStill, investing in this market is unpredictable, and having caution is crucial while deploying capital for price speculation.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "content": "The widely-anticipated Dencun upgrade for the Ethereum network is live on the Goerli testnet. However, the upgrade is experiencing some issues.\n\nAccording to a livestream on YouTube, Dencun was launched on Goerli at 6:32 UTC on Wednesday, but the chain appears to have split as it failed to finalize when expected.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Dencun Upgrade Goes Live\n\nThe Dencun upgrade is Ethereum\u2019s biggest since the Shapella upgrade in April 2023. While Shapella enabled the withdrawal of staked ether (stETH) on the network, the former is expected to significantly reduce transaction costs on layer 2 (L2) networks. They are significant steps in Ethereum\u2019s transition from a Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) after the Merge.\n\nDencun is expected to enhance Ethereum L2 rollup efficiency through a mechanism called proto-danksharding or ephemeral blobs (EIP-4844). The approach introduces temporary storage space for higher transactional throughput by allowing access to off-chain data to reduce storage demands. This process will slash L2 transaction costs by 10x or more as analysts believe high costs hamper the growth of the protocols.\n\nThe upgrade was initially slated for October 2023 but moved to late Q1 or early Q2 2024. It will be implemented in three phases, with Goerli\u2019s deployment being the first. The subsequent implementation will be on the Sepolia testnet on January 31 and then the Holesky testnet on February 7 before the final release on the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nFinality Issues\n\nDencun\u2019s deployment on Goerli failed to reach a consensus and finality. Developers believe this may be because of low participation, roughly 80%, and validators being offline. Pseudonymous X user Terence explained that validators could be offline due to operators not upgrading a piece of software or the presence of a bug.\n\nDue to Goerli having a \u201chighly\u201d diverse set of validators, it could take a while before the issue becomes clear. Regardless, developers intend to conduct a proper non-finality test over the next few hours or days.\n\n\u201cPersonally, I will not base my assessment of Goerli Deneb\u2019s readiness on the immediate finality results. It will take time to accurately evaluate the status. Therefore, before someone claims that the Goerli hard fork failed and Deneb is delayed, we should allow time for a proper analysis,\u201d Terence stated."

        "content": "Currently, there are plans to deploy Dencun on the Sepolia testnet on January 31, and then on the Holesky testnet on February 7.\n\nAmong the many things that the crypto industry has to look forward to, there is the Dencun upgrade for the Ethereum network. Touted as a way for Ethereum to increase its data processing abilities and scalability, it is largely seen as a game-changer by those in the industry. Now, we are a step closer to this upgrade as Ethereum developers have deployed a testnet of Dencun on the Goerli test network. This took place on January 17, 2024, at 6:32 UTC.\n\nDencun Coming Soon\n\nWhile the Dencun testnet launch was eventually deployed, it did meet some challenges along the way. Most notably, it wasn\u2019t able to reach finality and this is credited with validators not completing software upgrades and this led to low participation rates.\n\n\u201cAnd it seems like we have a chain split! Client teams are looking into it, but it\u2019s likely to take a while to pin down + fix the issues. Keep an eye out for updates!\u201d Tim Beiko, an Ethereum core developer, said.\n\nFinality, in terms of blockchains, refers to the mechanism that makes transactions irreversible. It is one of the most important parts of any blockchain network and has to be gotten right. The developer teams have confirmed that they are looking into these issues and should resolve them in the next few days.\n\nAt the same time, this is one of the purposes of testnet deployment- to make sure that any potential kinks are worked out before the final launch date. And this isn\u2019t the last deployment we will see before Dencun fully goes live.\n\nCurrently, there are plans to deploy Dencun on the Sepolia testnet on January 31, 2024, and then on the Holesky testnet on February 7. All these will lead up to the final Dencun deployment by the end of the first quarter of the year.\n\nWhy the Dencun Upgrade Is Vital\n\nOne thing that the blockchain community knows very well at this point is that a single network upgrade can change the very trajectory of an ecosystem. Ethereum itself experienced this with its last major upgrade that saw the network moving from a proof-of-work consensus to a proof-of-stake one. This move saw the network\u2019s energy use cut by over 95% and made Ethereum much better for the environment.\n\nThe Dencun upgrade is also on track to be impactful by introducing proto-danksharding. This is a mechanism that will increase Ethereum\u2019s capacity for data handling and make it cheaper to use. As such, Ethereum will become more scalable once it is implemented and naturally, there has been a lot of anticipation for this. While this testnet launch has seen its hiccups, we can hope that they are sorted and the final Dencun upgrade goes off without a hitch."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nIn the last year, thousands of developers have abandoned crypto\u2014but in several other key metrics, the ecosystem looks as robust as ever.\n\nThat\u2019s according to a new report out Wednesday from crypto venture firm Electric Capital, which says that the number of active, open-source crypto developers has dropped a sharp 24% from the end of 2022 through 2023. As of last month, just over 22,000 developers currently operate in the industry, across myriad blockchains.\n\nThe dropoff was all but certainly thanks to the crypto winter that set in after the $60 billion collapse of cryptocurrencies UST and LUNA in May 2022, and the subsequent collapse of FTX in November of that year, which cratered crypto\u2019s reputation and industry growth.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut there\u2019s a silver lining in that trend: The overwhelming majority of developers who left the industry in 2023 appear to have been fairweather builders, who had hardly spent any prior time in crypto.\n\nOver 52% of new crypto developers\u2014with one year or less of experience\u2014left the space by December 2023. In contrast, developers with one to two years of experience only dipped by a marginal 1%, and developers with over two years of experience actually grew as a category by the year\u2019s end, up a resounding 33%.\n\nThe geographic diversity of those developers has also grown over time. In 2018, United States-based builders represented 40% of all crypto developers worldwide, according to Electric Capital. By 2023, that figure shrunk to 26%. Meanwhile, the share of crypto developers from non-Western countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America has comparably ballooned in the same period, from 18% to 36%.\n\nEurope continues to produce the most crypto developers in the world\u201434% last year.\n\nWhat sorts of blockchains these developers work on has also developed promisingly over the years. As of 2023, 34% of all builders work on multiple chains, a marked increase that speaks to the scope and depth of development across the increasingly multi-chain crypto ecosystem.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEthereum, unsurprisingly, continues to attract the majority of crypto developers; over 8,000 coders consistently contributed to the blockchain last year. But Ethereum scaling network Polygon and rival Solana have also seen a marked uptick in numbers of new contributors.\n\nSlightly below those three networks in new developer activity, but impressive in their own right, are BNB Chain, Cosmos, Arbitrum, Polkadot, NEAR, Avalanche, Optimism, and Internet Computer\u2014each of which attracted between 2,000 and 4,000 new developers in 2023.\n\nThe fastest growing new crypto ecosystem of 2023 was Base: Coinbase\u2019s Ethereum layer-2 network, which took the industry by storm after its launch in August. 999 unique developers contributed to Base over the last three months of 2023.\n\nBitcoin, meanwhile, despite its status as the original blockchain, is no longer the coolest kid at the party. Where once the network could brag, way back in 2015, that it attracted more new developers than any other blockchain\u201417%\u2014by last year that figure shrunk to a measly 2%.\n\nThe Bitcoin ecosystem is now maintained by a core group of just over 1,000 developers. But some of those builders may be busier than others.\n\nAccording to Electric Capital\u2019s report, less than 10% of Bitcoin developers work on Ordinals, digital assets inscribed in tiny denominations of BTC that are akin to NFTs. Despite that relatively low figure, Ordinals, which were a runaway phenomenon in 2023, have routinely accounted for over 50% of transaction traffic on the Bitcoin network.\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

Proto-danksharking will allow the network to scale and more cheaply handle over 100,000 transactions per second, according to developers, via Ethereum Layer 2 solutions.\n\nEthereum layer-2 solutions, like Optimism, are where most of Ethereum\u2019s activity takes place, a report by market intelligence firm Messari said in October.\n\nProto-danksharking is the most talked about feature of the upgrade because Ethereum has long struggled with scalability; compared to other blockchains, it is slow and costly to do things on Ethereum, such as minting NFTs or sending ETH.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDevelopers working on the new feature hope to solve this. \u201cDanksharding is how Ethereum becomes a truly scalable blockchain, but there are several protocol upgrades required to get there. Proto-Danksharding is an intermediate step along the way,\u201d developers explain on the Ethereum website.\n\n\u201cBoth aim to make transactions on Layer 2 as cheap as possible for users and should scale Ethereum to >100,000 transactions per second.\u201d\n\nThe Dencun upgrade will be an Ethereum hard fork\u2014when validators on the network have to upgrade to the newest software in order to keep participating. There have been various similar upgrades to the network in the past, most recently 2022\u2019s \u201cmerge\u201d, when the network moved from proof of work to proof of stake."

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s Dencun upgrade has gone live on the Goerli testnet.\n\nDespite preparations, the testnet launch has not gone as many hoped.\n\nThe timeline for when issues would be resolved remains unclear.\n\nThe long-anticipated Ethereum Dencun upgrade is now coming into full view. In line with timelines released in December 2023, developers have launched the upgrade on the Goerli testnet, the soon-to-be-phased-out Ethereum sandbox for staking infrastructure and other protocol-level changes.\n\nDespite months of preparation, however, the upgrade\u2019s first testnet outing faced several roadblocks amid underwhelming participation.\n\nEthereum Dencun Upgrade Off To a Rough Start\n\nThe Dencun upgrade was released on the Goerli testnet around 6:32 UTC on January 17, as promised by developers in December 2023. The upgrade, however, did not get off to the start many would have hoped.\n\nEthereum Foundation protocol support member Tim Beiko reported that the upgrade failed to achieve finality, likely culminating in a chain split. Finality is assurance that crypto transactions cannot be reversed once executed.\n\nDevelopers linked the challenges faced in the upgrade\u2019s first outing to low network participation as more validators failed to upgrade their clients. Ethereum developer Terence Tsao pointed out the lack of sufficient participation ahead of the Goerli fork, predicting that finality could be lost as participation was estimated to be around 80%. For context, finality will likely be lost with 10% of validators offline.\n\nBack to the Drawing Board?\n\nEthereum Foundation\u2019s Beiko has noted that developers are investigating the hurdles faced during the Goerli fork. However, it remains to be seen when these issues will be resolved.\n\n\u201cClient teams are looking into it, but it's likely to a while to pin down + fix the issues. Keep an eye out for updates!,\u201d he wrote.\n\nDevelopers still have to test out the Dencun upgrade on two more testnets, Sepolia and Holesky, before they can launch it on the mainnet. While the initial timeline had indicated that a Q1 launch of the upgrade was likely, it remains to be seen how recent snafus will affect these projections.\n\nThe most anticipated feature of the upgrade is EIP-4844, also known as proto-danksharding, which promises to make fees cheaper on Ethereum Layer 2 chains by reducing the cost of storing data on the network with blobs.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nDevelopers had allocated a minimum of a week to test Dencun on each testnet.\n\nThe upgrade had gone smoothly during the shadow forks of Goerli.\n\nThe Dencun upgrade will be the last upgrade Goerli will see before it is phased out in favor of Holesky.\n\nThe full danksharding vision tipped to address Ethereum\u2019s scalability concerns is still years away.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nRecent hiccups during the Goerli fork may adversely affect Dencun mainnet launch projections.\n\nRead this for more on the Dencun upgrade:\n\nETH Devs Set Tentative Dencun Launch Dates for Key Testnets\n\n\n\nLearn more about Ethereum\u2019s growing dominance against Bitcoin:\n\nStrong Ethereum Fundamentals Fuel 20%+ Surge Against Bitcoin"

We\u2019ll explore what Ethereum is and its potential as an investment in 2024. The guide will then walk you through the practical steps of buying Ethereum, making it a valuable resource for both new and experienced investors in the cryptocurrency realm.\n\nWhat is Ethereum (ETH)?\n\nEthereum, commonly referred to as ETH, is a decentralized, open-source blockchain system. It is known for its native cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH), and its ability to support smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). Ethereum\u2019s blockchain is highly versatile and has been at the forefront of the blockchain revolution, offering a platform where developers can build and deploy various decentralized applications beyond just simple transactions.\n\nIs Ethereum a Good Investment in 2024?\n\nEthereum has been a hot topic in the investment world, and many wonder if it\u2019s a smart choice to invest in it in 2024.

        "content": "P\u00e9ter Szil\u00e1gyi, an Ethereum (ETH) developer, has lauded EIP-1559 and its ETH burning mechanism as \u201cthe great equalizer.\u201d Taking to X on January 16, Szil\u00e1gyi admired EIP-1559\u2019s ability to \u201clevel the playing field between validators and regular users.\u201d\n\nDeveloper: EIP-1559 Is A \u201cGreat Equalizer\u201d\n\nSince the implementation of EIP-1559, Ethereum adjusted how users bid gas fees, introducing the \u201cbase fee,\u201d which was burned or sent to an irretrievable wallet. So far, data from Ultrasound Money shows that over 3.9 million ETH have been destroyed.\n\nIn the last week alone, the Ethereum network automatically sent more than 21,100 ETH out of circulation, \u201cburning\u201d ETH\u2019s supply.\n\nSpecifically, Szil\u00e1gyi mentioned the advantage regular users have with EIP-1559. Through this implementation, validators (previously miners before Ethereum shifted to a proof-of-stake blockchain) no longer have the privilege of arbitrarily adjusting gas limits and transaction fees.\n\nEarlier, that leeway created what the developer described as an \u201cimbalance,\u201d which made it tough for \u201cregular users to compete.\u201d However, following this implementation, everyone must adhere regardless of status as a validator, founder, or user.\n\nWith EIP-1559, the \u201cbase fee\u201d adjustment is set at the protocol level. It is this base fee that the network burns, gradually making ETH deflationary, reading from the number of coins taken out of circulation since EIP-1559 went live in early August 2021. Even so, a sender can \u201ctip\u201d the validator, incentivizing them to prioritize validating a transaction.\n\nStability And Predictability Achieved, Ethereum Upsides Capped At $3,000\n\nSzil\u00e1gyi\u2019s comments reflect a growing consensus among Ethereum supporters regarding the positive impact of EIP-1559. Though a big percentage of EIP-1559 is fixated on the price impact of the proposal, there is more that it achieves.\n\nMost importantly, from a user experience perspective, it is now easier for senders to predict how much they will pay for a transaction. This is crucial, especially when the network is congested. Additionally, though the Ethereum gas fee remains relatively high, EIP-1559, though considered a \u201cbad idea\u201d by Szil\u00e1gyi, has stabilized the network.\n\nETH burning is attributed to reducing inflation in Ethereum, a network whose total supply is not capped like Bitcoin. Over the long term, prices might benefit from this proposal. However, prices are bullish in the short to medium term. Still, upsides are limited to around the $3,000 psychological round number.\n\nFeature image from Canva, chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "In a recent revelation, David Schwartz, the Chief Technology Officer (CTO) at Ripple and one of the key architects behind XRP Ledger, disclosed an intriguing insight into the genesis block secrets of Ethereum (ETH). The discussion unfolded when a curious crypto enthusiast probed Schwartz about the peculiar genesis block numbering in XRPL.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe question pointed to a historical mishap that resulted in the loss of ledgers 1 through 32,569 in XRPL, creating an unconventional void in recorded data. Schwartz responded by asserting that the choice of considering a particular block as the genesis block is arbitrary, drawing parallels to Ethereum's own genesis block.\n\nTo illustrate his point, Schwartz shared a link to an August 2016 transaction moving a substantial 2,622.1 ETH, currently valued at $6.68 million. He questioned the origins of the ETH and emphasized that Ethereum's genesis block, much like XRPL's, had undisclosed transactions that determined the allocation of funds.\n\nSomeone decided to define the genesis of the ETH chain to be before that transaction but after the transaction that explained why 40,000 ETH went to that address. So you cannot publicly see the source of that ETH unless you know where to look for it. \u2014 David \"JoelKatz\" Schwartz (@JoelKatz) January 16, 2024\n\nAs the discussion unfolded, Schwartz delved into the intricacies of Ethereum's genesis block, revealing that certain transactions were deliberately excluded from the public blockchain. He suggested that decisions were made to obscure the source of funds, showcasing the arbitrary nature of defining a blockchain's genesis.\n\nWhat's with XRP?\n\nThe conversation further explored the absence of transactions in XRPL's genesis block, leaving 534 transactions in the first 32,570 ledgers presumed lost. Notably, the breakdown of XRP distribution at ledger 32,570 revealed specific ownership percentages, with individuals like Jed McCaleb, Chris Larssen, Arthur Britto and entities like OpenCoin holding precise and publicly known shares.\n\nEffectively, XRPL has a genesis block with balances in it just as ETH does, but a big difference is that the ownership of all but about .01% of those balances for XRPL is precisely and publicly known:\n\nJed: 9 %\n\nChris: 9 %\n\nArthur: 2 %\n\nOpenCoin: 79.99 %\n\nBeta testers and developers:\u2026 \u2014 David \"JoelKatz\" Schwartz (@JoelKatz) January 16, 2024\n\nThis revelation not only sheds light on the mysterious genesis blocks of both XRPL and Ethereum but also raises questions about the transparency and decision-making processes within blockchain ecosystems."
