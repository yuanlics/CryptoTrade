        "title": "Ethereum Shanghai Upgrade Progress: Will ETH Price Rise Or Fall? - CoinGape",
        "content": "Ethereum Shanghai upgrade news: The network\u2019s highly anticipated upgrade is set to go live sometime in March or April. It will allow ETH stakers to withdraw their cryptocurrency currently locked in the ETH 2.0 smart contract. But the question is, will unlocking this amount cause immense selling pressure?\n\nA dress rehearsal (Zhejiang testnet) for the Ethereum Shanghai upgrade is about to begin. It serves to replace the Shandong testnet because when the latter was launched, it included several EIPs that will not be rolled out with the upgrade.\n\nadvertisement\n\nAccording to Paritosh, Developer at the Ethereum Foundation, the Zhejiang testnet is a great opportunity for all tools to test out how they want to collect, display and use the withdrawal information. Making the experience smooth for users is one of our highest priorities now!\n\nHow Ethereum Shanghai Upgrade Will Impact ETH\u2019s Price?\n\nAt the time of writing, the current price of Ethereum is $1,667.61 with a one-day trading volume of $9,876,481,170. ETH has risen by nearly 5.51% during the past 24 hours. The coin strongly holds the second position on CMC, with a live market cap of $204,071,388,357.\n\nOn the bearish side of things, the cryptocurrency market is still at the edge of a bullish-bearish trend. There are many reasons for it like many investors are not over with Terra Luna and FTX contagion. Also, macroeconomic factors are bearish that might pressure original Ethereum stakers to sell their staked ETH.\n\nIn conclusion, Shanghai Network Upgrade can lead Ethereum toward a massive surge, or investors can witness the price dump. It is just a matter of time until we find out!\n\nAlso Read: How Ethereum Shanghai Upgrade Will Impact ETH Holders?\n\nNote: The information in this article is solely the author\u2019s opinion and not investment advice \u2013 it is provided for educational purposes only."

        "content": "Russia\u2019s largest bank, Sberbank, is moving forward with the plan to launch its decentralized finance (DeFi) platform, preparing to trial the product in a few months.\n\nSberbank expects to launch open trials of its DeFi platform by May 2023, Sber\u2019s Blockchain Lab product director Konstantin Klimenko announced, the local news agency Interfax reported on Feb. 3.\n\nCurrently being tested in private beta, Sberbank\u2019s upcoming DeFi platform will be fully open by the end of April, enabling users to conduct the first commercial transactions, Klimenko said.\n\nThe executive noted that the blockchain platform will be compatible with the Ethereum blockchain, allowing customers to use major wallets, such as MetaMask, to move their assets. Klimenko also noted that users will be able to transfer their assets from other platforms.\n\nThe blockchain executive stated that Sberbank\u2019s DeFi platform aims to become a prime DeFi ecosystem in Russia. He also expressed confidence that DeFi systems are able to displace the traditional market of banking services.\n\nThe announcement comes in line with Sberbank\u2019s previously disclosed plans to enable DeFi applications on the bank\u2019s infrastructure. In November 2022, Sberbank announced a set of new features for its proprietary blockchain platform, including compatibility with smart contracts and applications on the Ethereum network.\n\nIt appears to be unclear how the upcoming platform is going to be regulated because Russia is yet to come up with digital currency regulation. According to Anatoly Aksakov, the head of the Duma\u2019s Committee on Financial Market, Russia will \u201cdefinitely\u201d adopt crypto regulations in 2023.\n\nRelated: Iran and Russia want to issue new stablecoin backed by gold\n\nAs previously reported, Sberbank was struggling to launch some blockchain tools over the past few years due to multiple delays of registration by the Russian central bank. Originally expecting to launch its digital asset issuance platform in 2021, Sberbank eventually received the Bank of Russia\u2019s approval in spring 2022. The Russian government is the majority shareholder in Sberbank, holding 50% + 1 share.\n\nOn Feb. 2, Alfa Bank, one of the largest private banks in Russia, became the fourth financial institution in the country allowed to issue digital assets alongside Sberbank, the state-backed tokenization platform Atomyze and fintech company Lighthouse."

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s price went up by over 40% since January.\n\nNetwork growth, however, declined.\n\nWith a price increase of over 40%, Ethereum [ETH] had a successful January. Although short-term investors can consider this a success, would it be advantageous to hold the asset for the foreseeable future?\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nETH sees a three-day straight increase\n\nA glance at Ethereum on a daily timeline revealed that its surge began at the beginning of 2023. It was up about 1.7% as of this writing, and was trading at about $1,670. The asset would record a third straight gain in three trading periods thanks to the price increase.\n\nAdditionally, a review of the daily timeframe of the Relative Strength Indicator revealed that ETH was in a bull trend. The RSI line was at 65 and displayed a reasonably strong bull trend. However, how favorable is this trend for traders looking to go long?\n\nDeducing ETH\u2019s strength through Aroon\n\nThe daily chart of Ethereum\u2019s Aroon Indicator showed that bullish sentiment had deteriorated dramatically over the previous few weeks. However, as of the time of writing, the Aroon Up line had pumped to 100%, and the Aroon Down line was visible at 42.8%.\n\nThe rise of the Aroon Up line coincided with the latest Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) announcement.\n\nThe Aroon indicator can be used to determine whether an asset is trending or trading sideways. Additionally, it detects when a trend has begun and ended. The indicator\u2019s rise on the ETH chart suggests that the current uptrend is robust, which could be excellent news for long-term buyers.\n\nNetwork growth declines\n\nWhile the indicator mentioned above provided some good news for investors, this other metric suggested that they should proceed cautiously.\n\nAn examination of the network expansion statistic revealed a severe decline. Network growth dropped to roughly 25.9 from its previous steady state of 65. As a gauge of a cryptocurrency\u2019s health and growth prospects, this metric assesses how widely it is being utilized.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nAn increasing network growth indicator may suggest that a cryptocurrency is growing in popularity and adoption, while a decreasing indicator may indicate the opposite.\n\nGiven the convergence of these two important signals, this level may be a favorable chance for investors seeking to go long on Ethereum. They should exercise caution, though, because a dip in price is probable. However, a rally is imminent in the longer term."

        "title": "Ethereum Burning Reaches New High, Is ETH Warming Up For Another Rally? - NewsBTC",
        "content": "While the global cryptocurrency market continues with its ubiquitous movement, Ethereum seems to be sneaking out to break a new record. The latest achievement Ethereum obtained is setting a new high in its burning-per-day mechanism.\n\nPer a recent report from WuBlockchain citing data from oklink, Ethereum\u2019s burning amount exceeded 3,000 ETH at a figure of 3,040 ETH on February 2. This new record sets the crypto asset burning rate highest point ever seen since November 10, 2022. According to the reporter, the primary source where the burning was aggressive was two popular decentralized exchanges, Uniswap and OpenSea.\n\nOver the past months, both platforms have recorded significant usage and trading volumes which correlate with the increased burning of ETH tokens. Data from CoinGecko shows Uniswap trading volume has moved from $558 million seen at the beginning of this year to $1.1 billion as of February 3, up by more than 50% over the last 25 days.\n\nIs ETH Warming Up For Another Rally\n\nWith an upcoming catalyst like the Shanghai upgrade coming soon to the Ethereum network, ETH could be in a warm-up stage before another rally. Following the demand for ETH surging, the crypto asset greed index has also made some significant movements in the past weeks ranging above 60 in recent days.\n\nThe increase in the greed index signifies a massive level of FOMO and anticipation amongst ETH investors waiting for the right moment to buy and result in another rally. Data aside, so far, the Ethereum price chart has only indicated two possible scenarios, which are to either retrace a little bit more or proceed with another bullish trend.\n\nLooking at the 1-day time frame of the ETH/USDT price chart, we can see ETH recently tapped into external liquidity \u2014 a move that signifies a possible retracement to take out the liquidity of the buyers below. A retracement confirmation could mean ETH returns to the $1,300-$1,350 region.\n\nMeanwhile, should ETH invalidate the possible retracement and tap into the $1,684 zone declining a retrace, we could see another upward rally as the crypto asset appears to be consolidating at the moment, waiting for a significant movement (expansion) either to the upside or downside.\n\nEthereum Continues Recording New Highs\n\nNotably, the burning rate hasn\u2019t been the only new high Ethereum recurred in the past weeks. Last month, NewsBTC reported the total staked ETH on the Beacon chain reached an all-time high of over 16.16 million ETH. The figure cumulates to more than 13.28% of the total Ether supply and represents $26.13 billion at current prices\n\nOut of the 16 million ETH staked, about 11.408 million ETH have been staked via staking services providers such as Lido, Coinbase, and Kraken, among others \u2013 representing 70.86% of the total staked on the Beacon chain. Lido dominates ETH staking with 29.3%, Coinbase controls 12.8%, while Kraken holds 7.6%, and Binance controls 6.3% of the total stake, according to Glassnode on-chain data.\n\nAdditionally, Ethereum total validators recently surpassed the 500,000 benchmarks and currently sit at 512,432 as of February 3, according to data from BeaconScan.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock, chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "1 Reason Ethereum Could Lead the Next Bull Market - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "For many years, Bitcoin has been touted as a premier store of value and has even drawn comparisons to gold due to its inherent scarcity and low inflation rate. But another cryptocurrency might be poised to beat Bitcoin at its own game: Ethereum (ETH 0.39%).\n\nIn August 2021, Ethereum developers implemented the London hard fork, an upgrade to the blockchain that added a few new perks to the way the Ethereum network functions. The most meaningful change to come out of this was a new feature that would make Ethereum deflationary.\n\nA crucial upgrade for price increases\n\nUntil the London hard fork, there was no limit to the amount of Ethereum that would enter circulation. And while that still technically is the case, the newly introduced deflationary mechanism will ensure that the rate at which new Ethereum enters circulation is reduced. And rather than only slowing the rate of newly minted coins, developers took it a step further and made it so that the total supply of Ether can actually be reduced.\n\nIt's a complicated process, but essentially, what has happened is that after the switch to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, the fee that previously would have gone to miners is now burned. The size of the fee varies depending on network demand, referred to as gas. Theoretically, the dynamics of the London hard fork make it so that as demand picks up, more Ether is burned.\n\nAs demand increases and more Ether is burned, Ethereum's price will probably climb. At this stage, Ethereum users are more likely to hold and not spend, while investors will look to reap the rewards of price increases. This will lead to fewer transactions and, therefore, less Ether getting burned, thereby increasing supply and perhaps lowering its price.\n\nAs the price comes down, users will have less of an incentive to hold and more pressure to spend. But as more spending occurs, more Ether will be burned, and the cycle between supply and demand and inflation and deflation will unfold once again.\n\nEthereum in the post-Merge world\n\nWe have yet to experience a full iteration of this cycle, but we are in the beginning stages of one. Since the Merge, the number of Ether tokens in circulation has remained nearly stagnant, hovering around 120 million. Before the switch to proof of stake and introducing burning, Ethereum's inflation rate was at about 4.5%, but since the Merge, it has moved to -0.009%. For comparison, Bitcoin's current inflation rate is about 1.7%.\n\nIf Ethereum still utilized proof of work and hadn't introduced the burn mechanism, there would have been an additional 1.5 million tokens in circulation just since the Merge in September 2022. But since implementation, the total supply of Ether has actually dropped by about 4,000.\n\nAn opportunity awaits\n\nDue to the recency of the Merge, we probably still haven't seen the true effects of this phenomenon, but when that day comes, it could bring some serious returns for investors. Despite its price being down more than 60% from its all-time high, Ethereum still is one of the most widely used blockchains in the world. As activity on the network picks up -- which it seems to be doing as of late -- demand should follow and add further deflationary pressure.\n\nOver the coming years and even decades, Ethereum might become subject to the whims of limited supply and increased demand, a phenomenon similar to the one that made Bitcoin the most valuable cryptocurrency today and spurred people to view it as a supreme store of value.\n\nCould Ethereum take over Bitcoin's role? Perhaps. But whether it does isn't too important right now. Instead, investors should use this time as an opportunity to grab some Ethereum while its price is still struggling and enjoy the benefit of its new deflationary feature for the long haul."
