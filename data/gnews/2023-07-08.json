        "title": "Top 2 Reasons Why Ethereum (ETH) Price Is Poised To Rally Hard - Coinpedia Fintech News",
        "content": "Elena is an expert in technical analysis and risk management in cryptocurrency market. She has 10+year experience in writing - accordingly she is avid journalists with a passion towards researching new insights coming into crypto erena.\n\nIn a recent video, Guy Turner, the host of Coin Bureau, has captivated the attention of Coin Bureau\u2019s 2.28 million subscribers by unveiling two key catalysts that could potentially ignite a powerful bullish run for Ethereum (ETH). These upcoming milestones hold the promise of driving ETH\u2019s price to new heights.\n\nProto-dank sharding upgrade\n\nThe first milestone highlighted by Turner is the eagerly anticipated proto-dank sharding upgrade, officially known as EIP-4844. This groundbreaking upgrade seeks to address Ethereum\u2019s long-standing scalability challenge, allowing the network to achieve a level of scalability comparable to centralized computer systems.\n\nBy tackling Ethereum\u2019s primary bottleneck\u2014data availability\u2014proto-dank sharding introduces special blobs of data that enhance transaction data accessibility. This boost in scalability is expected to result in lower fees, faster transaction speeds on layer-2 solutions, and an overall improvement in Ethereum\u2019s performance.\n\n\u201cThe biggest upcoming milestone for Ethereum is the EIP-4844 upgrade\u201d\n\nEnhancing Privacy, Post ETH Staking?\n\nTurner then turns the spotlight to Ethereum\u2019s renewed focus on privacy, marking it as the second significant milestone. Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin has openly acknowledged privacy as one of the Ethereum ecosystem\u2019s major challenges. To tackle this issue, Ethereum developers have been diligently exploring solutions, such as the implementation of stealth addresses.\n\nThe recent attention to privacy has been further intensified by the Shappella upgrade, which has sparked increased interest from institutional investors. Recognizing the growing demand for privacy from these investors, Ethereum aims to deliver enhanced privacy features that align with their requirements.\n\nWith these two powerful catalysts on the horizon, Ethereum\u2019s potential for a remarkable price surge is gaining momentum. As Ethereum continues to address critical challenges and push the boundaries of innovation, investors and enthusiasts eagerly anticipate the impact these developments will have on the cryptocurrency\u2019s value."

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTron Founder Justin Sun is in the headlines today after his latest on-chain transaction was brought to life. According to insights shared by crypto sleuth Lookonchain, Justin Sun transferred a total of 23,000 ETH worth approximately $43 million to Poloniex. While the purpose of the transfer remains unknown, there has been growing speculation from crypto Twitter.\n\nPotential reasons for funds movement\n\nJustin Sun owns the Poloniex exchange and, as a crypto founder with many top Web3.0 companies in his portfolio, the recent funds movement, which is not uncommon with him, can mean a lot of things. First, Justin Sun may set his eyes on gradual liquidation to take advantage of the recent bouts of price surges that Ethereum has experienced over the past few months.\n\nAccording to an extensive review of the associated wallet address, it was discovered that Justin Sun is a functional trader in the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) ecosystem, partaking in a series of staking activities from which he earns regular rewards. As a platform that supports staking, part of the reason for moving the funds to Poloniex might be to also stake it there as he has a record of doing this.\n\nAnother plausible reason is to cushion liquidity on the Poloniex exchange. With Justin Sun's direct oversight on the trading platform, ensuring there is enough liquidity to fulfill all customers' orders is essential, and this funds movement can be directed to this purpose.\n\nJustifiable fears?\n\nJustin Sun is undeniably a market whale with large holdings of different digital currencies beyond Ethereum. While the recent moves with respect to the Ethereum transfer have sparked fear of a possible sell-off, the fear of a sell-off might be unjustified.\n\nThis is because the total sum of the funds might not make a dent in the Ethereum market, which boasts a market capitalization of over $224 billion. Should Justin Sun choose to sell off the quoted ETH tokens, the impact on the market may not be as grievous as is being projected."

        "content": "Coin Bureau host Guy Turner is listing two catalysts that could potentially trigger a bullish run for Ethereum (ETH).\n\nIn a new video, Turner tells Coin Bureau\u2019s 2.28 million subscribers that two upcoming milestones could send \u201ccould send ETH\u2019s price higher.\u201d\n\nAccording to Turner, one of the milestones is the proto-danksharding upgrade.\n\n\u201cThe biggest upcoming milestone for Ethereum is the EIP-4844 upgrade which is colloquially referred to as proto-danksharding. The reason why proto-dank sharding is a big deal is because it will basically allow Ethereum to reach a level of scalability that\u2019s comparable with centralized computer systems. This will be achieved by addressing Ethereum\u2019s main bottleneck to scalability which is data availability\u2026\n\nProto-danksharding solves this by making it possible for special blobs of data to exist on the Ethereum blockchain. These blobs make transaction data more readily available which should increase Ethereum scalability, lower its fees and increase transaction speeds on its layer-2s.\u201d\n\nThe Coin Bureau host further says that the second upcoming milestone for Ethereum is an effort to enhance privacy.\n\n\u201cBesides proto-danksharding, Ethereum developers have apparently been hyper-focused on privacy.\n\nBack in January, [Ethereum creator] Vitalik [Buterin] penned a blog post where he referred to privacy as \u2018one of the largest remaining challenges\u2019 in the Ethereum ecosystem and proposed stealth addresses as one solution.\n\nIn April, privacy on Ethereum came into the spotlight again because of supposed privacy concerns related to ETH staking.\n\nJust last month, Vitalik penned another blog post where he noted privacy as being one of the \u2018three transitions that Ethereum must implement or else it will fail.\u2019\n\nThe sudden focus on privacy is not all that surprising when you realize that institutional investors want privacy more than anyone else. And remember that the Shappella upgrade has increased institutional interest in ETH.\u201d\n\nI\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Ethereum has seen over 580,000 new addresses in the past week.\n\nETH price recovered with less than a 1% increase in price.\n\nThe Ethereum [ETH] merge revolutionized the platform by introducing staking, sparking intense discussions throughout the chain. While this groundbreaking event garnered much attention, there\u2019s another metric steadily ascending in the background, silently shaping the future trajectory of ETH with great potential impact.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nEthereum new addresses surge\n\nAmidst the focus on Ethereum\u2019s staking and price trends, it\u2019s easy to overlook other crucial metrics. However, recent Santiment data sheds light on a quietly surging aspect: the network\u2019s remarkable growth.\n\nThe data indicated a consistent influx of new users joining the network, signaling potential market cap expansion.\n\nA closer examination of the chart revealed that over 580,000 new addresses were created between 1 July and 7 July alone. This remarkable surge further highlighted the underlying strength and promising trajectory of ETH.\n\nETH on exchanges decline\n\nAccording to the latest data from Coin Market Cap, Ethereum held an impressive 19% of the total cryptocurrency market cap. With this, it secured its position as the second-largest cryptocurrency, surpassed only by Bitcoin [BTC], which claimed over 49%. Despite ETH\u2019s market dominance, ETH holders actively withdrew their holdings from exchanges.\n\nSantiment\u2019s chart revealed that the supply of Ethereum on exchanges, relative to the total supply, stood at a mere 9.1%. This suggested that less than 10% of all ETH remained on exchanges, while the majority had been moved to other storage methods.\n\nFurther analysis of the chart revealed that approximately 11.3 million ETH was being held on exchanges at press time, indicating a visible decline. This withdrawal trend underscored the growing preference among Ethereum holders for alternative storage solutions.\n\nAlso, it reflected their confidence in the long-term value of their holdings.\n\nEthereum price declines as TVL dominates\n\nAccording to data from DefiLlama, Ethereum maintained its position as the leading blockchain in terms of Total Value Locked (TVL), compared to other chains. As of this writing, the total TVL across all chains was $44 billion, with Ethereum commanding over $26 billion.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s ETH\u2019s market cap in BTC\u2019s terms\n\nThis meant that Ethereum held more than half of the entire TVL in the market, showcasing its dominant presence in decentralized finance.\n\nHowever, ETH has experienced a recent decline. Nevertheless, there were signs of a potential recovery as of this writing. Ethereum was trading at approximately $1,864, showing a modest increase of almost 1% from its previous value."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nProto-danksharding is going to completely change Ethereum\u2014and for the better, says core developer Mario Havel.\n\nAt ETH Barcelona over the weekend, Havel told Decrypt that the next big Ethereum upgrade, dubbed \"Dencun,\" is nearing the \"final stages of planning.\" The upgrade will do many things, but one of the major changes is the introduction of the proto-danksharding feature, which will allow the network to scale and handle up to 100,000 transaction per second, devs say.\n\n\u201cThe majority of the focus right now is on the implementation of EIP-4844, also known as proto-danksharding,\u201d Havel explained. According to the core developer, EIP-4844 sets the foundation for data sharding through the introduction of a new transaction type\u2014the oddly named \u201cdata blob.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBlob blocks also introduce what\u2019s called a KZG commitment. The name stands for Kate-Zaverucha-Goldberg, the names of the original authors who came up with it.\n\nAccording to Havel, the KZG commitment will point to certain \u201cblobs\u201d of information. That's helpful for layer-2 scaling solutions, like Optimism and Arbitrum, because they batch transactions together in what are known as \"rollups\" and currently have issues accessing data needed to verify those transactions.\n\nThe easier it is for a rollup to access the data it needs, the faster and cheaper the transactions can be verified and reported back to the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nAccording to Carl Beekhuizen and Trent van Epps, two members of the Ethereum Foundation who are working on proto-danksharding, the blobs set the foundation for data sharding.\n\nOn the Epicenter Podcast earlier this year, they clarified the idea, saying that instead of having multiple simultaneous sidechains, there is only one chain but with \u201ccrazy\u201d amounts of information.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe data can then get split up on the one chain, allowing for individual stakers or smaller sized machines to be responsible only for a sliver of that large amount of information. And, says Havel, that data will only be stored for a few weeks at a time.\n\nKZG commitments are at the end of their \u201cKZG summoning ceremony,\u201d or a \u201cmulti party computation ceremony,\u201d said Havel, which calls upon the community to help with the scaling effort.\n\nHavel also explained that blobs will only store data for a limited amount of time, and will never touch the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), the environment where all smart contracts live and interact with one another, nor the Ethereum state directly.\n\n\u201cInstead, they will create a KZG commitment, which will allow us to handle data much more efficiently and in a much cheaper way,\u201d he explained, given the fact that blobs are small enough that they make disk use manageable.\n\nHavel explained that blobs will only store data for a limited amount of time, and will never touch the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). \u201cWe will be able to handle data much more efficiently, and in a cheaper way as well,\u201d he concluded.\n\nAdditional reporting by Rodrigo Martinez."
