        "content": "Payments giant Visa reportedly seeks to meet customer requests to convert digital assets into fiat payments, similar to how it converts foreign currencies.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been testing how to actually accept settlement payments from issuers in USDC starting on Ethereum and paying out in USDC on Ethereum,\u201d Cuy Sheffield, head of crypto at Visa, said during the StarkWare Sessions 2023 event in Tel Aviv. \u201cSo, these are large value settlement payments.\u201d\n\nHe noted that the effort would clone foreign currency exchange executed on the card network\u2019s payment platform.\n\nGlobal settlement with digital assets and fiat currencies is an area in which Visa wants to build \u201cmuscle memory,\u201d Cointelegraph reported, Sunday.\n\n\u201cThe same way that we can convert between dollars in euros on a cross-border transaction, we should be able to convert between digital tokenized dollars and traditional dollars,\u201d he said.\n\nVisa didn\u2019t return Blockworks\u2019 request for comment by press time.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nVisa announced the use of USDC, a stablecoin backed by the US dollar, to settle a transaction with the network over Ethereum in March 2021.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing wallets and crypto native neo-banks building payment products entirely with digital currency, and we want to meet these companies where they are,\u201d Sheffield told Blockworks at the time. \u201cThe ability to make settlement payments to Visa in digital currencies could offer meaningful benefits and efficiencies, particularly for fintechs who run their business in crypto.\u201d\n\nVisa hasn\u2019t yet integrated blockchain tech to support regular money movement on its network, but is currently exploring the move. Still, the company has already launched a blockchain-powered business-to-business payments network called B2B Connect.\n\nIt was among the first financial companies to embrace both blockchain and cryptocurrencies. To help clients and partners explore opportunities in the space, the firm launched a crypto advisory practice in late 2021.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

With its unique set of off-chain and on-chain executions, Arbitrum strives to provide lightning-fast and cost-effective transactions.\n\nIn recent months, Arbitrum has picked up considerable momentum, with increased liquidity flowing to the network.

For example, owners of Bored Ape Yacht Club non-fungible tokens (NFTs) were airdropped tens of thousands of dollars worth of $APE.\n\nAlthough there have been no official announcements yet, several key reasons could explain why an Arbitrum airdrop is more than likely.

Show More\n\nWhat is Arbitrum?\n\nArbitrum is a Layer 2 solution that seeks to address the network congestion, poor efficiency and higher transaction fees on Ethereum \u2014 the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization in the world.\n\nArbitrum improves the capabilities of Ethereum smart contracts through a method called optimistic rollup, a type of data compression technique for blockchain transactions that roll up batches of transactions into a single transaction.\n\nThe benefit of this technique is that blockchains only need to verify one transaction \u2014 the rolled-up transaction \u2014 instead of having to confirm each individual transaction that is part of the rollup. This process improves efficiency, as the blockchain only needs to confirm one transaction, avoiding the need to wait while numerous transactions are validated at once.\n\nAlthough this process takes place on a separate layer to boost speed and scalability, Arbitrum leverages the security provided by the Ethereum mainnet. All validated transactions on Arbitrum are moved back to Ethereum.\n\nArbitrum vs. Other Blockchain Networks\n\nArbitrum is designed to provide a user-friendly platform that developers can work in to launch highly scalable and efficient Ethereum-compatible decentralized applications (dApps). However, it\u2019s not the first platform seeking to overcome Ethereum\u2019s limitations.\n\nNotable competitors include Polygon, Optimism and Metis, among others. The following features separate Arbitrum from the rest.\n\nHigh EVM Compatibility\n\nArbitrum is widely regarded as one of the most EVM-compatible rollups. It\u2019s compatible with the EVM at the bytecode level and any language that can compile to EVM such as Solidity and Vyper.\n\nMarket Leader\n\nIn early February 2023, Arbitrum has the highest total value locked (TVL) out of all Ethereum Layer 2 solutions. Arbitrum takes the slight edge on Polygon with a TVL of $1.76 billion (3.52% of industry TVL) compared to Polygon\u2019s $1.22 billion TVL.\n\nTotal Value Locked (TVL) All Chain - DeFi Llama\n\nSupporting a higher TVL than Polygon is no small feat. Polygon is a top 10 crypto by market capitalization with a market cap of $13 billion. For comparison, the next largest Layer 2, Optimism has a market cap of $650 million.\n\nWell-Developed Ecosystem\n\nArbitrum is already collaborating with a vast range of Ethereum dApps and infrastructure projects, including Uniswap, Sushi, DODO and dozens of others.\n\nWill There Be an Arbitrum Airdrop?\n\nAs of January 2023, no official plans have been announced for an Arbitrum cryptocurrency airdrop. However, here are a few compelling reasons why an Arbitrum airdrop is likely.\n\nAlthough Ethereum Layer 2 networks do not need a native token to operate, many other Layer 2 projects have launched their own tokens to facilitate governance and other use cases. A few notable examples include:\n\nPolygon\n\nOptimism\n\nMetis\n\nLoopring\n\nOn April 20, 2022, the same day that the Optimism airdrop was announced, Steven Goldfeder from Arbitrum tweeted the following message:\n\nAnother key reason why Arbitrum may launch a token airdrop is to reward its early adopters and repeat users. This strategy has been employed by several successful cryptocurrency projects, including Uniswap, a top 20 crypto by market capitalization.\n\nArbitrum AirDrop Guide\n\nUnfortunately, there is no way to guarantee that you will be eligible for Arbitrum airdrop \u2014 if there even is one. However, several strategies can improve your chances of eligibility. These strategies focus on maximizing your activity, consistency and reach across the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\n1. Purchase Ethereum\n\nThe first step you need to take for your best chance at an airdrop is to acquire ETH \u2014 the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum network. ETH is used to pay transaction fees on the Ethereum mainnet and Arbitrum.\n\nEthereum can be purchased through a centralized crypto exchange such as Coinbase, Uphold or KuCoin. After you have acquired ETH, you transfer it to your software wallet of choice.\n\nEnsure that your chosen software wallet supports ETH or runs on the Ethereum mainnet. MetaMask \u2014 an Ethereum-compatible wallet that connects to hundreds of decentralized applications (dApps) \u2014 is a great choice.\n\n2. Connect Arbitrum to MetaMask\n\nTo see ETH in your wallet, add the Arbitrum network to MetaMask (or your other chosen software wallet). This is an extremely easy step.\n\nIn the case of MetaMask, the easiest way to connect to Arbitrum is to use the one-click method. To do so, visit the Arbitrum Bridge website and click on Add/Switch to Arbitrum Network.\n\nYou will receive a pop-up message from MetaMask. Click on Approve, and the Arbitrum Network will be added to your MetaMask wallet.\n\n3. Bridge Funds to Arbitrum\n\nAfter you have purchased ETH, the next step is to bridge your ETH from the Ethereum mainnet to the Arbitrum network.\n\nTo bridge ETH, visit the Arbitrum website and connect your personal wallet to the application. From there, follow the instructions provided \u2014 the entire process can take several minutes to complete.\n\n4. Complete Guild On-Chain Quests\n\nOnce your ETH has been bridged to the Arbitrum network, you will be able to complete a few tasks on Arbitrum that will grant you access to the Arbitrum guild.\n\nCurrently, there are no added benefits of joining the guild other than a corresponding role in Arbitrum\u2019s official Discord; however, it is a great starting point for new users. To join the guild, visit the guild\u2019s official website and complete the necessary tasks.\n\n4. Weekly Arbitrum Interactions\n\nInteract with Arbitrum frequently \u2014 either on a daily or weekly basis. This important step ensures that you are an active and consistent user.\n\nThe rationale is to use as many protocols that support Arbitrum as possible as frequently as possible. The developers have released no specifications for how much ETH (or other tokens) you need to move around. It is up to you to determine an appropriate amount of assets you want to keep on the Arbitrum network based on your unique risk tolerance.\n\nPopular protocols that you can use that support Arbitrum and have interesting use cases include:\n\nGMX\n\nHop Protocol\n\nKyber Network\n\n1inch\n\nShell Protocol\n\nConsider making swaps, taking trades and adding liquidity and staking within liquidity pools.\n\nWhere to Buy Ethereum\n\nETH can be traded on major exchanges such as HYCM, Binance (or Binance.US for U.S. investors), Uphold, Crypto.com and KuCoin. Many of these platforms allow you to purchase ETH using your credit card, through swapping features or via trading pairs such as ETH/USDT or ETH/BTC.\n\nHow to Store Ethereum\n\nEthereum can be stored safely using a crypto wallet. Choose from two types of crypto wallets \u2014 software and hardware wallets. Software wallets allow users to easily manage their cryptocurrency, including buying, selling, swapping and lending through the internet. Hardware wallets, which keep private keys offline, are considered the most secure way to store ETH.\n\nIf you plan to actively engage in these tasks, it is recommended that you use a software wallet. Software wallets are superior at connecting to and interacting with decentralized applications (dApps) on the Arbitrum network.\n\nBest Software Wallet: Trust Wallet\n\nTrust Wallet is an industry-leading software wallet that enables crypto holders to store, buy, exchange and collect cryptocurrencies and NFTs all in one location. Acquired by Binance in 2018, Trust Wallet is trusted by millions of users worldwide. Users can access 250,000+ crypto assets on over 65 blockchains, which makes it a great choice for investors at all ends of the spectrum.\n\nIs Preparing for the Arbitrum Airdrop Worth it?\n\nWhile there is no guarantee that Arbitrum will have an airdrop or launch a utility token, strong evidence suggests that it is likely. To maximize your chances of eligibility, you may consider following a few of these tasks.\n\nWhether or not an airdrop is announced, Arbitrum is still a great Layer 2 solution with a vibrant ecosystem of dApps. Being an active user doesn\u2019t guarantee that you will be rewarded; however, the opportunity to leverage some of Arbitrum\u2019s fascinating dApps and learn more about decentralized finance (DeFi) is a benefit."
