        "summary": "  Sure, here's a summary of the article in less than 256 tokens:\n\nAn 8-year dormant Ethereum wallet has suddenly transferred 8,000 ETH (worth $14.7 million) to a new address. The wallet received the ETH during Ethereum's ICO in 2015 and remained inactive until May 27, when the owner transferred 1 ETH to a new wallet and then transferred the remaining 7,999 ETH to the new address. The transfer has sparked community speculation, with some suggesting the owner may have just been released from prison or made a humorous comment about the wallet being an old Ledger. The transfer represents a 590,000% gain for the owner compared to the initial investment of $2,500. This is the latest in a series of dormant Ethereum wallets reawakening, with others transferring millions of dollars worth of cryptocurrency in recent months."
