        "title": "Another dormant Ethereum wallet reawakens after 8 years, moving millions - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "An Ether (ETH) wallet that has been inactive in 2015 has suddenly awoken after eight years of dormancy, moving a total of 8,000 ETH in just two minutes.\n\nThe wallet received 8,000 ETH after participating in Ethereum\u2019s ICO (initial coin offering) in 2015 and remained inactive until May 27. On that day, its owner began with a cautionary transfer of 1 ETH to a new wallet. One minute later, they transferred the remaining 7,999 ETH to the new wallet address.\n\nAt the time of writing, the ETH stash is worth approximately $14.7 million.\n\nThis transaction was first noticed by blockchain analytics service Lookonchain, which informed its 219,000 Twitter followers of the transfer.\n\nAn Ethereum ICO participant who has been dormant for 8 years woke up today.\n\n\n\nHe transferred all 8000 $ETH($14.7M) to a new address.https://t.co/1griKB9Te9 pic.twitter.com/1bvQh3zsqY \u2014 Lookonchain (@lookonchain) May 28, 2023\n\nIn the comments section of the post, there was some community speculation around the reason for the transfer. One commenter suggested that the owner had just been released from prison, while another made a humorous remark that they were transferring funds from an old Ledger \u2014 a pointed comment about the company\u2019s controversial new Recover upgrade.\n\nAt the time, the 8,000 ETH was purchased at a price of just $0.31 per token, which places the initial investment amount at around $2,500.\n\nAt today\u2019s prices of $1,917, this marks a staggering 590,000% gain for the owner.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the only ICO-era Ether wallet to re-awaken in recent months. On April 24, another wallet that received 2,365 ETH ($4.5 million) made its first transaction in nearly eight years, with the owner transferring 2,360 ETH to a new wallet address.\n\nOn March 5, another ETH wallet transferred 10,226 ETH ($19.6 million) out to new wallet address after remaining dormant for five years.\n\nThe new wallet address is also one with little in the way of any significant transaction history. The only other ETH transaction recorded in the new wallet is a 207 ETH ($380,000) incoming transaction that was made just a few minutes prior to the most recent transfer. Notably, the additional 207 ETH were sent from another wallet that had remained completely inactive since June 12, 2017.\n\nRelated: Arbitrum-based Jimbos Protocol hacked, losing $7.5M in Ether\n\nInterestingly, the new wallet also contains $46 worth of a memecoin called Gensler (GENSLR), and just $0.24 worth of a dragon-inspired token called Dejitaru Tsuka (TSUKA), according to data from Web3 wallet tracker DeBank.\n\nTotal allocation of token holdings in the owner\u2019s new wallet. Source: DeBank\n\nThe Ethereum ICO occurred raised $18 million in two stages between July and September of 2014. The going exchange rate for the pre-sale was 1 Bitcoin for 2,000 ETH. The Ethereum blockchain was not launched until July 30, 2015, meaning that investors had to wait for more than a year to be able to redeem and use their Ether.\n\nDormant wallets with vast sums of crypto can awaken for a variety of reasons. Sometimes dormant wallets reawaken because they\u2019ve been hacked. Other times, it's simply because the owner may have forgotten about it and upon its re-discovery, have decided that it's possibly a good time to sell.\n\nCrypto City: Guide to Osaka, Japan\u2019s second-biggest city"

        "title": "Top 3 Price Prediction Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple: XRP becomes an outlier as outlook turns bullish - FXStreet",
        "content": "Share:\n\nBitcoin price shows a classic Power of Three (PO3) setup in play, forecasting a potential decline to $25,296.\n\nEthereum price could attempt a rally to $2,028 if the bullish outlook persists.\n\nRipple price has set up an inverse head-and-shoulders setup, forecasting a 10.76% increase to $0.515.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price has surprised investors with a quick uptick over the weekend, but it is unclear if this is a spurt in buying pressure or a reentry of sidelined buyers. Judging by the price action, the cause of the uptick is unclear and the bearish outlook explained in previous articles is still valid.\n\nAlso read: Top 3 Price Prediction Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple: BTC set to punish greedy bulls\n\nBitcoin price ready to collapse\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price breached its two-week consolidation on May 28 and collected the buy-stop liquidity resting above May 10 swing high at $28,293. This liquidity run was soon followed by a retracement, which is underway and signals a Power of Three (PO3) setup in play.\n\nThis technical formation has three phases \u2013 accumulation, manipulation and distribution. As the name indicates, the asset usually moves sideways in the first phase and is often followed by a sweep of a critical level, which is termed manipulation.\n\nThe third or the last phase is distribution, which leads to volatile rallies in the opposite direction of manipulation. In Bitcoin\u2019s case, BTC swept a local top at $28,293 and is trading at $27,879, signaling the next move should favor bears.\n\nIf this setup plays out, Bitcoin price could reach the $25,764 support level to collect the sell-stop liquidity. Should the selling pressure persist even after this 7.6% decline, BTC price could hit the next critical support level at $25,296.\n\nThese levels are key accumulation levels, as seen in previous articles.\n\nRead more: Bitcoin Weekly Forecast: BTC delays inevitable crash to $25,000\n\nBTC/USD 4-hour chart\n\nOn the other hand, if Bitcoin price continues to tread above the $28,051 level, it could attempt an extension of this weekend's rally. If the move leads to a flip of the $30,000 psychological level, it would invalidate the bearish thesis.\n\nIn such a case, BTC could attempt a retest of the $32,450 hurdle.\n\nEthereum price needs to stay above this level\n\nEthereum price has overcome the $1,817 hurdle and shot up 7% over the weekend. ETH trades at $1,898 at the time of writing but it needs to hold above the $1,853 support level to resume its uptrend.\n\nIf successful, ETH could eye a retest of the $2,028 hurdle followed by a sweep of the April 16 high at $2,147.\n\nETH/USD 1-day chart\n\nOn the contrary, if Ethereum price breaches the $1,853 support level, investors should pay attention to $1,817. If this level fails to hold, ETH will invalidate the bullish thesis and could trigger a correction to $1,703.\n\nRipple price flips bullish amid confusing times\n\nRipple price has set up an inverse head-and-shoulders set up on the four-hour chart. This technical formation contains three swing lows, with the central one lower than the other two. The ones on each side are defined as the shoulders, while the central one is the head. Connecting the peaks using a trend line reveals a declining resistance level known as the neckline.\n\nThis setup forecasts a 10.76% upswing to $0.515, determined by measuring the distance between the right shoulder\u2019s peak and the head\u2019s lowest point, adding it to the breakout point at $0.465 (see chart below).\n\nSo far, Ripple price has not only breached the neckline but has also rallied nearly 4%, currently trading at $0.481. If the bullish trend continues, XRP price could rally another 7.30% before it hits the theoretical target.\n\nXRP/USD 4-hour chart\n\nInvalidation of the inverse head-and-shoulders setup will occur if Ripple price slices the neckline at $0.465. If this bearish outlook continues, XRP price could slide towards the May 24 low at $0.442."

        "title": "Does This New Ethereum Rival Really Have 400x Upside Potential? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Ethereum (ETH 0.03%) remains one of the great all-time crypto investments. If you had invested in Ethereum way back in 2015 when things were just getting started, you'd be up a head-spinning 63,500% today.\n\nSo it's perhaps no surprise that the arrival of what some are calling the next Ethereum is cause for celebration in the crypto world. We've seen that already with the likes of Solana and Avalanche -- both were tagged as potential Ethereum killers almost as soon as they launched. And we are starting to see the same phenomenon with Sui (CRYPTO: SUI), a highly touted Layer-1 blockchain that just launched in May.\n\nWhat is Sui?\n\nSui is a super-fast, super-scalable proof-of-stake Layer-1 blockchain with a nearly impeccable pedigree. Many of the developers at Sui worked on Diem, the big blockchain project from Meta Platforms. And the founders of Sui have already lined up more than $330 million in venture capital from some high-profile names, including Coinbase Ventures.\n\nThe big draw right now seems to be Sui's transaction processing speed. The blockchain claims to be able to process up to 300,000 transactions per second (TPS), which is way beyond what even Solana (65,000 TPS) can offer. Moreover, the developer team behind Sui claims the blockchain is optimized for digital assets and the brave new world of Web3, due in large part to the programming language they use.\n\nHow high can Sui go?\n\nA little market cap comparison will give you a good idea of how high Sui could soar. Right now, it has a market cap of slightly over $500 million. So if it does a 10 times return on investment, it would give Sui a market cap of approximately $5 billion -- that's Solana and Avalanche territory. Currently, Solana has a market cap of $7.7 billion, and Avalanche's is $4.7 billion.\n\nBut let's say Sui eventually replaces Ethereum simply based on its superior performance characteristics. That's when things will really get interesting. Ethereum has a market cap of more than $200 billion right now, so if Sui ever catches up to Ethereum, that would be a 400-fold return on investment. You can start to see why investors love the concept of the next Ethereum -- the numbers get very big quickly.\n\nIn many ways, this same logic has already played out with Aptos (APT -1.04%), which was introduced in October 2022. Aptos was the other major blockchain project spun out of Diem, and like Sui, it came with an impeccable pedigree, top developer talent, and high-profile venture capital backing. Despite practically launching into the eye of a tornado (the FTX debacle in November 2022), Aptos is now up a staggering 125% year to date and is already one of the top 40 cryptos in the world by market capitalization.\n\nBut do we really need another Ethereum?\n\nThe big question, of course, is whether the blockchain world needs another Ethereum. At one time, we did, because Ethereum was still a slow, old-fashioned proof-of-work blockchain. But then came The Merge last year, and as a result, I'm not convinced we really need another Ethereum. Many speed and performance issues have now been addressed, and Ethereum pulled off The Merge without a hitch.\n\nSo for Sui to hit all its grandiose growth targets, many things would have to go right. For one, developers would have to perceive a real need to abandon Ethereum and switch to another blockchain for all their future development projects. I don't think that's going to happen. Moreover, Sui would have to beat out not just Ethereum but also a long list of previous Ethereum-killers, including (but not limited to) Solana, Avalanche, and now Aptos. That's a big ask.\n\nIt's still Ethereum, and it's not even close\n\nFor now, I cannot recommend Sui as a long-term investment. It's certainly interesting because of its price (still trading for around $1) and pedigree. But I just don't think faster speeds are enough to win over developers, users, and investors.\n\nAt the end of the day, people want to see what's built on top of the platform, and right now, you just can't beat Ethereum, which is dominant in many key areas of the blockchain world. Ethereum is still the world's premier Layer-1 blockchain. As a result, I remain bullish on Ethereum, both short-term and long-term."

The news comes after a Coingraph report indicating that the Ethereum blockchain recorded a trading volume of $3.01 trillion against Visa's $3.08 trillion.\n\nJUST IN: $ETH almost caught up with Visa in processed transaction volume - $3.01 trillion vs. $3.08 trillion, respectively. \u2014 Coingraph | News (@CoingraphNews) May 29, 2023\n\nEthereum premiered in 2016, 58 years after Bank of America (BofA) founded Visa as the BankAmericard credit card program.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum ZK rollups eye Arbitrum's market share as adoption rises\n\nEthereum almost caught up with Visa in processed transaction volume\n\nEthereum (ETH) blockchain has recorded a massive $3.01 trillion trading volume, only about 0.07 trillion less than Visa. The competition is remarkable, especially for Ethereum, because of the bearish market since mid-2022.\n\nWith this information, Ethereum testifies to the growth in blockchain technology so much that it can now rival established players within the payments technology space. It also evidences the growth in mainstream adoption of a budding technology often associated with an enabler of crime. This is because scammers, drug dealers, and cyber criminals are now more inclined to digital assets than traditional finance.\n\nBased on Etherscan data, Ethereum daily transactions hit 968,996 on May 28, with the all-time high being 1,932,711 transactions on December 9, 2022.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum worth $7.5M stolen in Arbitrum-based Jimbos Protocol exploit\n\nAs the second-largest blockchain in the world, Ethereum powers a wide range of financial technology solutions committed to revolutionizing the finance market on a global scale. These solutions include staking, lending, flash loans, and decentralized finance (DeFi).\n\nFurther, the Ethereum blockchain has become a wealthy, agile, and dynamic environment with a wide provision for further development. This is another advantage of Ethereum over traditional financial layers.\n\nEthereum foray into TradeFi\n\nThe famous blockchain is already the choice network for most established traders and investors like Visa, who want to use the novel technology. A May report about Ethereum's economics indicated that Visa employed Ethereum's Goerli testnet to try transaction-free payments using account abstraction.\n\nIt leveraged a smart contract christened 'Paymaster,' which allowed the company to capitalize on account abstraction to perform complex tasks on behalf of accounts and manage transaction costs. Citing Head of Crypto Cuy Sheffield at Visa at the time:\n\nExcited to see Visa deploy our first paymaster smart contract on testnet as we continue to research and experiment with account abstraction and ERC-4337.\n\nERC-4337 is an Ethereum standard that performs account abstraction without a consensus-layer alteration. This allows users to bundle and automate transactions on the network.\n\nEthereum previous triumph over visa: A deep dive into the factors\n\nThis is not the first time Ethereum has shown its gusto against Visa. The blockchain network had outperformed the payments giant in 2021, recording $11.6 trillion against Visa's $10.4 trillion trading volume.\n\nIn 2021, VISA moved $10.4 trillion in payments volume, Ethereum moved $11.6 trillion. \u2014 Blockworks (@Blockworks_) January 19, 2022\n\nThis was attributed to the second largest crypto recording 4.5X as many daily transactions as Visa and was corroborated by Ethereum Foundation's Josh Stark.\n\nFUN FACT: #Ethereum processed 4.5x times more transactions than Visa in 2021. \u2014 Watcher.Guru (@WatcherGuru) May 6, 2022\n\nDespite the difficult conditions in the crypto market, Ethereum survived through regulatory clampdowns, a myriad of bank crises amidst turbulences in traditional finance, and the ensuing Fear, of Uncertainty and Doubt (FUD). The role of developments and upgrades cannot be ignored as these are the major reasons for ETH high volume transactions. The Merge upgrade and Shanghai/Capella (Shapella) upgrade are among the major upgrades, as they reduced the gas fees and spiked the number of transactions between 2022 and 2023."

        "title": "Ethereum's Shanghai upgrade made it easier to detect criminals - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "With its historic Merge event in September, Ethereum has become a proof-of-stake blockchain. The mechanism now used to confirm transactions relies on validators staking their Ether (ETH). Ethereum\u2019s March upgrade, codenamed Shanghai, finally enabled stakers to withdraw their locked Ether.\n\nThe Ethereum ecosystem\u2019s \u201cinvestment themes\u201d have included a) decentralized finance (DeFi) b) stablecoins c) Bitcoin (via wrapped versions of BTC) and d) non-fungible tokens (NFTs). With the upgrade, the network also began providing fixed-income assets.\n\nThere are currently several ways people make money on or using Ethereum. Broadly, they can be grouped into \u201cinvestment themes,\u201d including: a) decentralized finance (DeFi); b) stablecoins; c) Bitcoin (BTC) (via wrapped versions of BTC); and d) nonfungible tokens (NFTs). Following Shanghai, the network began to offer fixed-income assets.\n\nRisk-free rate\n\nYield is one of the core pillars of traditional finance (TradFi). A rise or fall in yield leads to an increase or decrease in the perceived risk of other financial assets. Thus, movements in the benchmark rate set by the United States Federal Reserve provide the rationale behind investment decisions, in general.\n\nRelated: Ethereum is going to transform investing\n\nAccordingly, compliance professionals use trends in the risk-free rate to detect irrational movement of funds in capital markets, as such fund flows might be attempts to launder money. The reasoning here is that launderers of illicit funds do not actively chase financial gains like regular investors, as the sole purpose of money laundering is to obfuscate the trail of dirty money.\n\nWith Ethereum\u2019s staking yield denoting the \u201crisk-free rate\u201d of the crypto ecosystem, the Shanghai upgrade may have enhanced the state of crypto forensics.\n\nTradFi forensics focuses on activity \u2014 crypto forensics focuses on entities\n\nFinancial crime risk in TradFi is managed using automatic systems that alert institutions to probable illicit use of financial assets. While data scientists design and deploy models to raise red flags over suspicious transactions, investigation teams still must assess resultant leads and evaluate if Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) need to be filed.\n\nAn interesting point of contrast between forensics for TradFi and crypto is that the latter focuses more on the criminal entity than the activity itself. In other words, investigators analyze networks of crypto wallets to identify transfers of criminal assets.\n\nMoney laundering occurs in three stages: a) Placement: proceeds of crime enter the financial system; b) Layering: complex movement of funds to obscure the audit trail and sever the link with the original crime; and c) Integration: criminal proceeds are now fully absorbed into the legal economy and can be used for any purpose.\n\nFor crypto assets, it is convenient to design solutions to detect the placement of illicit assets. This is because most laundered money originates from crypto-native crimes such as ransomware attacks, DeFi bridge hacks, smart contract exploits and phishing schemes. In all such offenses, a perpetrator\u2019s wallet addresses are readily available. Consequently, once a crime has been committed, relevant wallets are monitored to analyze asset flows.\n\nIn contrast, forensic experts working for, say, a bank do not have any visibility into the offense \u2014 such as human or drug trafficking, cybercrime or terrorism \u2014 when criminal proceeds are being injected into a bank\u2019s ecosystem. This makes detection extremely difficult. Hence, most Anti-Money Laundering (AML) solutions are designed to identify layering.\n\nEthereum\u2019s staking rewards make it easier to detect unusual activity\n\nTo design solutions to detect layering, it is imperative to think like criminals, who craft complex flows of funds to obfuscate the money trail. The time-tested approach to exposing such activity is to spot the irrational movement of assets. This is because money laundering does not have the goal of generating profit.\n\nWith Ether\u2019s post-Shanghai staking yields providing benchmark interest rates for crypto, we can formulate baseline risk-reward structures. Armed with this, investigators can systematically spot financial behavior running counter-intuitive to trends in the benchmark rate.\n\nRelated: Thanks to Ethereum, \u2018altcoin\u2019 is no longer a slur\n\nTo illustrate, there might be a pattern where an address or a group of addresses that points toward an entity that consistently takes on high risk while earning below the risk-free rate. A situation like that would almost certainly be investigated at a bank.\n\nCase in point, such a transaction surveillance architecture can be used to detect the wash trading of NFTs. Here, multiple market participants collude to carry out numerous NFT trades with the goal of layering criminal assets or manipulating prices. Since earning profits is not the intention behind the vast bulk of these transactions, such activity will raise a red flag.\n\nSimilarly, in a situation where proceeds of terrorism are being layered via DeFi protocols, detection of irrational asset movements can provide substantial leads to investigators, even without knowledge of the actual crime.\n\nFinancial crime and DeFi\n\nTraditional capital markets are often used to covertly move funds to circumvent sanctions and finance terrorist activity. Analogously, DeFi ecosystems present an attractive target for financial crime due to the ability to move vast sums of assets between jurisdictions using blockchain.\n\nFurther, there has been a significant shift in activity from centralized exchanges to decentralized exchanges due to recent fiascos like the collapse of FTX. This increase in DeFi volumes has made it easier for illegal flows to remain obscure.\n\nEven more compelling is the introduction of better compliance controls by centralized crypto service providers \u2013 often mandated by regulators \u2013 which are likely driving criminals to seek out new channels for money laundering.\n\nConsequently, illicit flows to DeFi could originate from an expanded set of crimes. This paradigm shift in crypto markets will require forensics teams to increase their capabilities of investigating complex fund flows across diverse protocols without prior knowledge of the source of criminal assets.\n\nAccordingly, compliance efforts need to pivot around the discovery of layering typologies. In fact, with the rapid progress in blockchain interoperability, systematic surveillance to detect criminal transfers has become even more crucial.\n\nOur ability to detect suspicious activity in crypto is less than ideal, partly due to crypto\u2019s extreme price volatility. The volatility renders static risk thresholds ineffective and can enable money laundering to go undetected. In this sense, if and when Ethereum sets a benchmark rate, it will provide a means of establishing baseline rationality for fund flows and thus spotting outliers.\n\nDebanjan Chatterjee has more than 17 years of experience analyzing trends in financial crime using data science, including more than 13 years at HSBC.
