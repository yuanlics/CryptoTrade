        "content": "The correlation dipped below 80% over the week from ATH levels of 97% at the end of 2022.\n\nThe recent price action of the two coins showed that both have moved on a similar wavelength.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s [BTC] correlation with Ethereum [ETH] dropped to its lowest level since November 2021, indicating a significant divergence in the growth trajectories of the two blue chip cryptocurrencies in the market.\n\nRead Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nBased on a 40-day rolling window, the correlation dipped below 80% over the week, according to market data provider Kaiko. This was a marked departure from the all-time high (ATH) levels of 97% seen during the end of 2022.\n\nIs Shapella the reason?\n\nAs depicted, the correlation between the two cryptos has been falling since mid-to-late March. However, the rift widened after the much-awaited Shapella Upgrade went live in April, bringing some improvements unique to Ethereum.\n\nInterestingly, a similar event in September 2022, known as the Merge, which kickstarted Ethereum\u2019s transition to a proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain, failed to bring about a considerable decoupling between the two assets.\n\nBut the recent Shapella Upgrade closed the loop on some of the key aspects of the transition that couldn\u2019t make it to the Merge last year, thus positioning Ethereum as a full-fledged PoS network.\n\nIt is important to understand that both the assets function very differently from each other.\n\nWhile Ethereum is often used as a platform for the development of decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts, Bitcoin is primarily used as a store of value and a means of payment.\n\nInfact, by virtue of being a chain which hosts numerous applications, the total value locked (TVL) on Ethereum was a whopping $27 billion at the time of writing. In contrast, Bitcoin held assets worth only $183 million.\n\nWhat can be the implications?\n\nAs per a 21 April report by Coinbase, lower BTC-ETH correlation makes a case for portfolio diversification as holding both the assets can result in higher returns. As for institutional investors, the trend could impact their trading strategies like cross-hedging.\n\nRead Ethereum (ETH) Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nHaving said that, recent price action of the two coins showed that both have moved on a near identical wavelength. Earlier this week, BTC\u2019s crash fueled by a false rumor created ripples in the broader crypto market and ETH didn\u2019t go unscathed.\n\nAccording to CoinMarketCap, BTC was down 8.48% over the last week while Ethereum\u2019s weekly losses were 6.44%."

        "content": "The Ethereum (ETH) blockchain had a technical issue on May 12 that led to a stoppage of finalizing blocks for over an hour. The incident followed a previous technical problem on May 11, making it the second one in 24 hours.\n\nA bug could have attacked Ethereum\n\nThe Ethereum Beacon Chain failed to finalize transactions for an unclear reason, causing major security concerns for users. Steven Zheng, the Block research director, mentioned that people speculate that the reason was bugs in staking clients or MEV infrastructures.\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation stated that the unfinalized blocks could lead to the re-ordering or dropping of pending transactions from the network.\n\nThe recent attack was the second one in 24 hours, with the same issue on May 11 when finality paused for about 25 minutes.\n\nYou might also like: Ethereum\u2019s beacon chain experiences temporary halt in finalization, raising alarms\n\nAccording to an Ethereum staker, they found a production incident where all four sets of CL+EL deployed in their system were simultaneously rebooted, which is a rare phenomenon. It was then discovered that these BeaconNode Prysm suddenly doubled their memory usage, which drove the memory limit and triggered OOM.\n\nA self-proclaimed Ethereum Beacon Chain community health consultant, Superphiz.eth, clarified that transactions do not stop due to finality issues like those on Ethereum. In addition, he noted that the lack of finality had no impact on on-chain activity.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/superphiz/status/1656977820315254786?s=20\n\nAs of the time of writing, the network has fixed the issue and restored the block finalization.\n\nChanges need to be implemented on network\n\nSome services built on Ethereum may need to modify operations due to finality issues. DYdX, for example, paused deposits temporarily due to the incident and continues to investigate the matter and monitor it.\n\nSuperphiz.eth noted that he expects a third even with the second wave over. He further advised validators on the network to increase their hardware spec if they can and switch to a minority client if possible. However, he noted not to worry too much about it, even if it looks terrible. The chain keeps going and will eventually finalize.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/superphiz/status/1657106474131136512\n\nMeanwhile, it\u2019s clear that questions about Ethereum\u2019s stability remain and could stain its credibility in the builder\u2019s eyes. The reliability of a network is essential for blockchains that would like to attract capital and grow users. That is important because Ethereum is historically viewed as among the most stable networks on the market.\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "content": "Ethereum developers have taken measures to address the finality issues that occurred on the Beacon chain in the past week. On May 11 and May 12, the Beacon chain, the consensus layer of the Ethereum network, was unable to reach finality on two occasions. The first occurrence lasted for 25 minutes, and the second for over an hour.\n\nAlthough the exact cause of such an incident is yet unknown, it is worth stating that this network glitch had no impact on on-chain activity and transactions were still processed.\n\nEthereum Developers Roll Out Network Patches To Tackle Finality Challenge\n\nIn response to the past week, Ethereum developers have released patches to provide a solution for network users.\n\nAccording to a tweet by Beacom Chain community health analyst superphiz, Teku and Prysm, two of Ethereum\u2019s constitutional clients, have implemented these fixes, which will help prevent further finality issues on the Beacon chain.\n\nWe can start putting this loss of finality issue behind us, @Teku_ConsenSys and @prylabs have deployed fixes that will prevent the attestation flooding. This is one step on our diversity & decentralization journey, let's learn from it and move forward with greater purpose. pic.twitter.com/cSRgPTWeuy \u2014 superphiz.eth \ud83e\udd87\ud83d\udd0a\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f (@superphiz) May 13, 2023\n\nSuperphiz also shared a statement from the Ethereum Foundation in which they are speculating the cause of these \u201cexceptional scenarios\u201d to be the \u201chigh load of some Consensus Layer clients\u201d.\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation applauded client diversity which made it feasible for transactions to occur on the network, as not all client implementations were affected by the finality challenges.\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation also confirmed that the exact cause of the Beacon chain glitch is still unknown. However, they provided assurances that the upgrades implemented by Teku and Prsym would help avoid future occurrences via optimizations that will prevent beacon nodes from high resource usage during these situations.\n\nETH Total Supply Declines Following The Merge\n\nIn other news, Ethereum\u2019s total supply decreased in the months after The Merge.\n\nOn September 15, 2022, The Merge occurred in which the Ethereum network fully transitioned from Proof-of-Work (PoW) to Proof-of-Stake (PoS), leading to Ethereum 2.0.\n\nIn the 241 days after this historical event, data from the Ethereum supply analytics platform, ultrasound.money shows that ETH\u2019s total supply has declined by 0.29%.\n\nSince The Merge, over 653,000 ETH has been burned compared to the 425,000 ETH that has been minted in the last eight months resulting in a net negative change of about -227,000 ETH.\n\nInterestingly, ultrasound.money predicts the total ETH supply to have increased at a rate of 3.244% per year had The Merge not occurred.\n\nThat said, if this deflationary trend continues, it would mean good news for long-term ETH investors. This is because a decrease in supply usually results in a rise in value.\n\nAt the time of writing, ETH is trading at $1,805.77 with a total supply of 122.89 million. Along with most of the market, ETH showed a negative price movement in the last week, losing 5.36% of its value.\n\nETH Trading At $1804.73 | Source: ETHUSD Chart on Tradingview.com\n\nFeatured Image: Forbes, chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "Best Cryptocurrency Investments to Buy Right Now: Solano, Ethereum and Bitcoin - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "Global investors continue to scour the markets and search for the fastest growing, highest yielding cryptocurrencies. 2023 has provided investors with a number of opportunities to make fast profits whilst also providing stability. The crypto market is known for its volatility, traders and enthusiasts must keep their finger on the pulse as selecting the correct investment is critical. With the cryptocurrency market maintaining a market cap above the $1 trillion mark most of the time, many investors are constantly looking for the best cryptocurrencies to invest in.\n\nBest Cryptocurrency Investments to Buy Right Now\n\nInnovative, groundbreaking technology is the key to any successful cryptocurrency. Market movers and shakers, disrupters and enhancers provide investors with the perfect opportunity to make profits. Below are some of the best cryptocurrency investments to buy right now:\n\n1. Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin will always be on the list of the best investments, with a market cap of over $500million the once obscure cryptocurrency has become the bedrock of the cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin currently has a market dominance of more than 45% with crypto experts recognising that the price of many other cryptocurrencies is dependent on Bitcoin\u2019s price.\n\nThe leading cryptocurrency was launched in 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto, a person or group of people still unknown to date. Bitcoin was created to serve as peer-to-peer cash, a currency that would be independent of the government. The lack of governmental control has drawn many to the decentralized asset over the years. Another factor that has attracted users to the asset is its limited supply. The total supply of Bitcoin is limited to 21 million coins, which means that it is a deflationary asset that is resistant to inflation. This scarcity has helped to drive up the price of Bitcoin, making it an attractive option for investors looking to store value and hedge against inflation.\n\nIn 2022, Bitcoin\u2019s price crashed violently. The crypto asset started the year trading around the $45,000 mark. However, Bitcoin ended the year below $20,000, falling as low as $15,000 at some point. Ironically, 2022 seemed to be the year when Bitcoin would reach the $100,000 milestone.\n\nPlan B, a renowned Bitcoin analyst, and proponent, deduced a system for predicting Bitcoin\u2019s price based on supply. This unique system coined by Plan B had been effective in the past, accurately predicting the period when Bitcoin would hit the $10,000 mark and cross the $50,000 mark. The stage seemed set for the next prediction. According to Plan B\u2019s model, BTC would reach the $100,000 mark sometime around late 2021 or early 2022. Unfortunately, that never happened.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price tumbled after a series of negative events in the crypto ecosystem, the most notable being the crash of LUNA and UST. After hitting unexpected lows in 2022, Bitcoin\u2019s price is now due for some relief. Crypto investors realize that Bitcoin below $20,000 is undervalued. More so, the flagship cryptocurrency has always bounced back from black swan events and massive price crashes. In 2023, investors expect Bitcoin to bounce back from the massive fall from its peak experienced the year before.\n\nFurther, Bitcoin\u2019s halving is expected to take place in 2024. The halving of Bitcoin would reduce block rewards to miners. This would make the crypto asset scarcer than it was. Historical price action reveals that Bitcoin always appreciates massively months after the halving. Prudent long-term investors will use the dollar-cost averaging method to invest in the asset before the next halving in 2024.\n\n2. Tradecurve \u2013 A Presale to Purchase\n\nTradecurve.io\u2019s presale is making waves within the cryptocurrency currency market, with phase one of it\u2019s presale rapidly selling out TCRV is showing all the signs of a profitable opportunity for investors. Designed to become the worlds first hybrid trading exchange, Tradecurve will serve as a bridge between the financial and cryptocurrency markets. Tradecurve\u2019s unique privacy policy and disposal of KYC checks allows users of the platform to trade the financial markets in complete anonymity.\n\nTradecurve\u2019s native utility token $TCRV powers the entire Tradecurve ecosystem and is currently priced at $0.01. Tradecurve is as an excellent opportunity for investors who are able to take advantage of its current price, a total of 40% of $TCRV will be sold during the presale.\n\nHolders of the Tradecurve token will also benefit from a number of offerings such as; access to trading academies via the metaverse, automated trading, copy trading, passive income through staking, high-leverage options, lowered subscription and trading fees. Tradecurve will also incorporate algorithmic trading, allowing users to utilize advanced algorithms and AI to execute trades with speed and precision.\n\nProviding access for investors to trade; stocks, shares, currencies, cryptocurrencies, commodities and indices all from one account, Tradecurve has set the precedent for never-seen-before privacy when trading the financial markets. With an experienced team behind the project, multiple use cases and features of the Tradecurve platform, investors are expecting the $TCRV presale to continue gaining rapid momentum.\n\n3. Ethereum\n\nEthereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. The Ethereum network\u2019s native token is Ether. Ether is used to pay for transactions and services on the platform. This has created an economic system within the platform that has helped to drive its adoption and use.\n\nThe protocol is widely utilized in the NFT and DeFi space. Ethereum was launched in 2015, and the project was founded by Vitalik Buterin and co. Notably, Charles Hoskinson, the current founder of the Cardano network, also played an integral role in the development of Ethereum. Ethereum was created to facilitate the development of immutable smart contracts and programs. Today, the blockchain protocol has lived up to expectations, enabling developers to build decentralized applications.\n\nOne of the main advantages of Ethereum is its flexibility. Developers can use the platform to create a wide range of decentralized applications, from DeFi platforms to NFT marketplaces. Notably, the blockchain protocol\u2019s native token (ETH) has made early investors a lot of money. Ether was less than a dollar for most of 2015. Today, however, Ether is valued at around $1800.\n\nInterestingly, despite the massive growth Ethereum has experienced over the years, the protocol still has a long way to go in development. The constant innovation in the Ethereum ecosystem has led the project to continue to see tremendous success. The Ethereum Foundation implemented a means of receiving improvement proposals, that is EIPs. EIP stands for Ethereum Improvement Proposal, and it gives room for innovation in the ecosystem.\n\nOn the 12th of April, Ethereum successfully completed an EIP that has long been pending. The EIP enabled the release of staked tokens to users who had locked their ETH to enable its consensus mechanism transmission. Ethereum previously utilized the proof of work consensus mechanism but has now switched to the proof of stake consensus mechanism. This switch will enable scalability in the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nVitalik Buterin noted that the successful transition of the Ethereum network from proof of work to proof of stake was not the end of Ethereum\u2019s development trajectory. The protocol still has significant upgrades in its roadmap for 2023 and 2024.\n\nWhen investors factor in the upcoming developments waiting on the Ethereum network, the project becomes more appealing. Ethereum currently has very strong fundamentals, and a more scalable Ethereum would attract more investors. This makes Ether a good crypto asset to invest in for long-term gains.\n\n4. Solana\n\nSolana is one of the well-known \u201cEthereum Killers\u201d in the crypto ecosystem. The cryptocurrency made a name as an ETH-killer because of the fascinating features of its blockchain. Solana is a high-performance blockchain platform that was created to solve the scalability and performance issues faced by the Ethereum network. It was launched in 2020 by a team of developers led by Anatoly Yakovenko and has quickly gained popularity among cryptocurrency traders and investors.\n\nSolana has magnificent transaction speed. The platform boasts a transaction speed of 65,000 transactions per second, making it one of the fastest blockchain networks in existence. This has made it an attractive option for developers looking to build decentralized applications that require high-speed transaction processing.\n\nSolana has some disadvantages, though. While Solana stands tall in its speed, the blockchain protocol seems to be slightly deficient in centralization. This relative deficiency is understandable due to the fact that the protocol is relatively new. Newer blockchain networks tend to be less decentralized than long-standing protocols. Further, the Solana network has also been criticized for its security in the past. The blockchain network has been stopped on two occasions due to upgrades.\n\nDespite the setbacks, the Solana ecosystem still has a strong developer community. Its strong community has helped the ecosystem and the native token to survive catastrophic seasons. Last year, during the crypto market meltdown, the SOL token was severely affected.\n\nIts price fell from a high of $250 to as low as $50. While this price crash was massive, the worst was still yet to come. In November, when the FTX exchange was found guilty of mismanaging traders\u2019 funds, the SOL token paid a part of the price. The FTX exchange held most of its assets and collateral in SOL. As the heat intensified, the exchange had to liquidate most of its collateral in FTT and SOL. That month, SOL tumbled from around the $30 mark to as low as $8.\n\nInterestingly though, while it seemed to be the end of the road for the Ethereum killer, a light appeared at the end of the tunnel. A team of developers launched BONK, the first memecoin of the Solana ecosystem. The developers emphasized that their goal was to attract liquidity to the Solana ecosystem and rescue the dying token. Thankfully, their plans were met with success.\n\nLate in December and early in January, memecoin fans joined the Bonk ecosystem, and the Bonk airdrop further contributed in boosting liquidity in the Solana ecosystem. At the moment, Solana still seems miles away from its all-time high. However, the token has continued to survive the crypto market storms and would be set to bounce back when a significant bull run occurs. Solana offers a compelling investment opportunity for those looking to invest in the cryptocurrency market. Its speed, low fees, and strong community support make it an attractive option for developers and investors.\n\n5. Pancakeswap\n\nPancakeSwap is a decentralized exchange running on the Binance Smart Chain network. It was launched in September 2020 and has quickly become one of the largest DEXs. Compared to DEXs built on the Ethereum network, Pancakeswap has low transaction fees. This has attracted many retail traders to the exchange.\n\nAnother advantage of PancakeSwap is its yield farming feature, which allows users to earn rewards by providing liquidity to the platform. Liquidity providers make a share of the fees generated by the exchange, and they can also earn CAKE tokens, the platform\u2019s native cryptocurrency, as a reward for their participation.\n\nNotably, CAKE, the native token of the Pancakeswap ecosystem, was once in the top 20 ranks of cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. However, the price of the CAKE token has fallen drastically recently, and so has its market capitalization. CAKE is now ranked as the 85th largest cryptocurrency.\n\nWhile its current price and decline in the past two years are discouraging, it is worth noting that the exchange has no competition on the BSC network. Cake currently has the largest liquidity for BSC projects and will continue to be widely utilized.\n\nAdditionally, the price decline presents a massive investment opportunity for investors. If the CAKE token is to reclaim its all-time high, that would be a 20X move from its current price. Factoring the project\u2019s fundamentals and its role in the Binance Smart Chain ecosystem, CAKE will have the potential to profit investors in 2023.\n\nConclusion\n\nUndoubtedly, Tradecurve, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and PancakeSwap tokens have solid fundamentals making them great coins to invest in this year. The crypto market is full of opportunities and now is the time to invest. Notably, optimum profits are not made from well established cryptos but young, innovative tokens with real world usage. Tradecurve has all of these credentials and an exciting future ahead, now is an excellent time to get involved in the presale.\n\nFor more information about Tradecurve (TCRV), visit the links below:\n\nBuy presale: https://app.tradecurve.io/sign-up\n\nWebsite: https://tradecurve.io/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Tradecurveapp\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/tradecurve_official\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"
