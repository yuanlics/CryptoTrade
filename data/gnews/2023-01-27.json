We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCosmos (ATOM) is one of the Ethereum (ETH) competitors with one of the best market capitalizations. However, it has failed to draw much attention to itself and is losing the popularity contest and capital to other so-called \u201cEthereum killer\u201d networks such as Cardano (ADA), Solana (SOL) and Tron (TRX).\n\nCosmos had its launch in 2019 and was developed to be an ecosystem where multiple networks can talk to each other, as well as overcome the scalability and interoperability problems that affect many cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC) and its rival Ethereum.\n\nThe cryptocurrency is built around a hub-based architecture, where each hub is an independent blockchain that acts as a bridge between other networks. This allows different cryptocurrencies to be exchanged and used with each other without the need for a centralized crypto exchange, strengthening the idea of an ecosystem free of a centralizer.\n\nBut why does Cosmos not grow like an Ethereum killer?\n\nFirst of all, Cosmos solves the problem of lack of communication between networks only in its ecosystem or hubs. Thus, not just any blockchain can reach Cosmos and exchange smart contracts, for example. This breaks the expectation that Cosmos could be a powerful Layer 0 network.\n\nAnother factor hindering Cosmos\u2019 growth is the value of the token to its ecosystem. You have probably heard that developing on the Ethereum blockchain is expensive and that fees are paid through the network\u2019s native token, ETH. However, the same importance that Ether has for the leading smart contract platform, ATOM does not have for Cosmos.\n\nOn the altcoin network, appchains can create their own logic, which makes ATOM unnecessary since this technology runs its sovereign blockchain instead of a smart contract implemented on another chain.\n\nMoreover, the ATOM community is far removed from the supporters of other ETH rivals such as Solana and Cardano. The community around it is very important for a cryptocurrency because, without it, hardly any project \u2014 even a serious one like Cosmos \u2014 can survive.Without being able to attract more of an audience to itself, the cryptocurrency may continue to lose ground not only to smart contract platforms but also to altcoins with no real value proposition, such as Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB).\n\nDoes this mean that Cosmos is a bad project?\n\nNo. The altcoin, even though it needs to overcome some challenges, remains in the top 10 assets with the most development activity, proving that its network is growing and that more people may soon use it.\n\nIt is also worth noting that, although it is not one of the cryptocurrencies with a large community, Cosmos is regularly present on social media, something that is also very important.\n\nIn addition, it has made important partnerships, and blockchain industry projects are using its network. A great example of this is the arrival of the DeFi dYdX protocol on its blockchain.\n\nOther advantages of Cosmos are:"

        "title": "3 tips for trading Ethereum this year - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Cryptocurrency is a notoriously volatile industry, regardless of what coin you\u2019re trading. During periods of extreme volatility, it\u2019s easy to become disheartened when trades don\u2019t go your way. It\u2019s also easy to become overconfident when you get lucky, falsely attributing it to your trading strategy \u2014 when, in reality, the price often rose or fell for reasons other than you assumed.\n\nDespite the uncertainty, there are sometimes still strategies you can use to trade certain tokens successfully. Ether (ETH) is arguably where you might be able to succeed this year. Here are three tips that might help.\n\nUnderstand what actually affects ETH price movements\n\nThere are many ways to analyze the price of a given cryptocurrency, and different price valuations will be given depending on the model used and how much weight is given to a specific set of conditions.\n\nBut incorrect weighting can produce erroneous conclusions. For instance, a cryptocurrency can generate positive buy signals across the board, but other factors can send the entire market tanking.\n\nNew daily reminder: $ETH will at some point clean up this $1072 area. Whether we go higher first or not pic.twitter.com/786H6iprmB \u2014 Pentoshi (@Pentosh1) January 7, 2023\n\nThis is precisely what happened with Ethereum\u2019s Merge, where a successful transition to proof-of-stake that reduced consumption by 99.9% was not really reflected in the price. In fact, bearish traders ran the price into the ground.\n\nThe crypto market also tends to correlate heavily with Bitcoin (BTC), which is traded by a lot of institutional and hedge fund money that is tied to interest rates and traditional financial markets. ETH currently holds a 0.9 correlation with Bitcoin.\n\nLeading up to May 2021 and November 2021, ETH experienced significant price increases. This was attributed to announcements from big firms, such as the decision of the European Investment Bank to offer a two-year bond on the Ethereum blockchain. Visa also announced plans to transact in USD Coin (USDC) over Ethereum.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin will surge in 2023 \u2014 But be careful what you wish for\n\nA summary of the factors that affect the price of Ether is that it will be affected most heavily by Bitcoin\u2019s price movement, interest rate decisions, institutional investment and macroeconomic conditions that discourage investment.\n\nFundamental blockchain indicators, however, can strongly point toward medium-term appreciation, perhaps over one to three years. Based on these indicators, Ethereum is a very powerful blockchain with a thriving ecosystem set for growth.\n\nAnticipate the seasonality\n\nLike other cryptocurrencies, ETH has specific months where it performs well, and others where it performs poorly. It performs the worst in September, June and March, meaning those may be good times to become a buyer.\n\nIn contrast, it performs well in February, April and May. This is a time for traders to issue sell orders, while buy-and-hold investors might simply avoid these months in terms of investment (though other criteria should also be taken into account).\n\nWhile there are claims that certain hours of the day are more lucrative than others for investment, studies have shown this is not the case, at least where Bitcoin is concerned. The same applies to days of the week.\n\nSeasonality of Ether pricing. Source: FXStreet\n\nEven if there are certain days or times to trade Ethereum, only active traders will be able to gauge this information correctly and withstand the increased fees of more regular trades. More realistically, seasonality can be applied on a monthly and perhaps quarterly basis for most.\n\nSeasonality is something to keep in mind as there are definite monthly trends.\n\nConsider dollar-cost-averaging\n\nA popular and research-backed means to trade Ether (and any other asset) is dollar-cost-averaging (DCA), a technique first popularized by Benjamin Graham and applied to the equity market.\n\nDCA is a means of investing smaller amounts at specific intervals. You could, for instance, invest a specific amount at the start of each month. This ensures that you get all the highs and lows (at least on a month-to-month basis), smoothing out volatility.\n\nRelated: Post-Merge ETH has become obsolete\n\nIt\u2019s a great way for newcomers to enter the market because it requires no technical expertise or time investment. You don\u2019t have to conduct research or learn statistical models or correlations (though you can obviously do this on the side).\n\nDCA can also be a great baseline for more creative investments, providing a stable foundation. For example, you can combine it with seasonality, choosing the three to four months where Ether has historically been priced on the low end.\n\nAt the very least, DCA can help you to avoid the volatility of the cryptocurrency markets with investment spread out across time. Holding on to your investment is as important as making profits, a fact often missed in an industry often overtaken with hype and profits.\n\nOther points to keep in mind\n\nThe upcoming Ethereum Shanghai upgrade in March will allow users to withdraw staked ETH, valued at more than $20 billion as of mid-January, though it isn\u2019t clear whether investors will capitalize on the opportunity \u2014 which would be bearish \u2014 or continue holding their ETH, which would be bullish.\n\nFundamental indicators with regard to a given blockchain \u2014 active addresses, forks, functional upgrades, node diversification, speed, etc. \u2014 are often not factored into the price on a short time horizon. Ethereum\u2019s Merge, for instance, reduced waste by 99.9% but did nothing for the price, being overshadowed by wider economic factors.\n\nBut these are certainly useful indicators on a longer time horizon. The work that has been done to enhance the Ethereum blockchain and ecosystem will, eventually, be reflected in its price.\n\nIn this regard, Ether is a wonderful investment opportunity for late 2023 and perhaps 2024, given recent innovations.\n\nIt is, in many ways, a perfect token for a patient investor.\n\nDaniel O\u2019Keeffe worked for three years as a compliance analyst for JPMorgan and State Street.
