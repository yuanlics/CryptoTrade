        "summary": "  Ethereum is set to undergo a significant transformation called The Merge, which aims to reduce its energy consumption by nearly 99%. The change involves converting Ethereum into a more ecological digital currency by changing the way consensus is reached from Proof of Work (PoW) to Proof of Stake (PoS). This means that traditional mining will no longer apply to Ethereum, and instead, investors who own ETH will be responsible for validating transactions through staking their coins. The change is expected to benefit not only Ethereum but also NFTs by eliminating the barriers to their environmental impact. However, there are also potential disadvantages to the change, such as the possibility of network centralization and the potential for hackers to access obsolete keys and carry out a long-range attack. Despite these concerns, the merge has already achieved its primary objective of reducing energy consumption, making Ethereum a more ecological and competitive digital financial instrument."
