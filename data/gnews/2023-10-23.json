        "content": "Disclaimer: The opinions expressed by our writers are their own and do not represent the views of U.Today. The financial and market information provided on U.Today is intended for informational purposes only. U.Today is not liable for any financial losses incurred while trading cryptocurrencies. Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEthereum has been facing its share of hurdles in the recent market trends. An examination of its daily chart indicates a pivotal juncture at which Ethereum currently finds itself.\n\nFirst and foremost, a glance at the chart reveals a potential resistance level that Ethereum seems to struggle with. This is evident from the multiple touchpoints that gravitate toward this price ceiling. Historically, consistent inability to break through such resistance has often led to sharp retraces. For Ethereum, the implications could be more pronounced, given the other market dynamics currently in play.\n\nOne concerning trend is Ethereum's low network activity. Despite being a hub for countless decentralized apps, the recent lull in on-chain operations signals waning interest or, perhaps, a temporary shift of focus toward newer blockchain platforms. A thriving network is not just about transactions \u2014 it is also about development, upgrades and new projects. Low network activity might hint at a pause in these endeavors.\n\nMoreover, while Ethereum wrestles with its price, competitors like Solana are making substantial gains. With a 34% price increase since its local low, Solana is outpacing Ethereum in the race. This divergence is noteworthy. Ethereum's hegemony in the decentralized space is being tested, and these performance metrics might force investors to reconsider their portfolios.\n\nSolana takes stage\n\nThe cryptocurrency market is no stranger to spectacular price movements, and Solana (SOL) has recently been at the center of attention. Experiencing an astounding 34% price surge, SOL is definitely not staying on the sidelines. But with such rapid appreciation, investors and traders are inevitably asking: When might this bullish rally slow down or reverse?\n\nSolana's recent price action can be attributed to a variety of factors. Labeled as going through its \"second youth,\" the digital asset is enjoying tremendous growth in network activity. This vitality and resurgence can be seen as a testament to the resilience and potential of the Solana blockchain.\n\nOne key element backing this sentiment is Solana's survival through the FTX crisis. Such events can be a death knell for many other cryptos, but not Solana. Its ability to bounce back and even thrive post-crisis underscores its robustness, making it a formidable player in the crypto arena.\n\nA glance at the Solana price chart indicates a powerful uptrend, characterized by higher highs and higher lows. The recent bullish candles reflect the strong buying interest and momentum. However, as with all significant price surges, there is always the possibility of a pullback or correction.\n\nThe chart showcases a potential resistance point, where traders might take profits, leading to a temporary slowdown in the price ascent. Moreover, while the relative strength index (RSI) is not in the overbought territory yet, continued upward movement could push it into that zone, indicating that a potential price correction might be on the horizon.\n\nCardano remains neutral\n\nRecently, Cardano (ADA) has shown promising signs, primarily by its ability to maintain its position above a crucial technical marker \u2014 the 50 exponential moving average (EMA). This development cannot be understated, as it often signifies a crucial pivot in sentiment and price direction.\n\nThe 50 EMA serves as a dynamic support or resistance level, depending on where the price stands in relation to it. In Cardano's case, remaining above the 50 EMA can be interpreted as a bullish sign, indicating that recent price averages are higher than the longer-term averages.\n\nTraders and analysts often regard this positioning as an affirmation of an asset's resilience and potential for upward momentum. In layman's terms, it is a line in the sand, one that ADA is currently on the favorable side of.\n\nAn observable aspect in the current ADA price chart is the downtrend's gradual flattening. After periods of pronounced decline, this leveling out can often precede a trend reversal. Essentially, it can be seen as the market taking a breather, consolidating and potentially gearing up for the next move."

        "title": "Bitcoin Could Get Ethereum-Style Smart Contracts Under 'BitVM' Plan - CoinDesk",
        "content": "The protocol is presented by Garand Fill today with Algo Kit. Welcome back to first mover. Our next guest is out with a recent white paper that outlines a new paradigm to bring Ethereum style smart contracts to the Bitcoin network. Joining us now is zero sync co-founder Robin Linus Robin. Welcome to the show. Hi, thanks for having me. All right. Talk to us about this white paper in it. You know that bit VM is a computing paradigm to express turn complete Bitcoin contracts. Explain to us what's going on here and what the real world problem is that we're solving. Well, the very high level rework problem that we are solving is Bitcoin scalability. Um Yeah, we would love to scale Bitcoin to millions of transactions per second. And currently that's not possible on the main layer unfortunately. And yeah, if we had more expressive smart contracting capabilities on Bitcoin, um we could bridge Bitcoin to like side chain systems or other feature-rich systems such that we can uh essentially scale BT C transactions more or less indefinitely. Uh So this is not the first proposal for smart contracts on Bitcoin correct on the Bitcoin network. So what makes this different than any, anything else that's out there right now. Mm So the scripting capabilities of Bitcoin, they are quite limited. Um It's not a very feature-rich platform in comparison to let's say Ethereum or other smart contracting platforms that we know. And um yeah, actually Bitcoin script is intentionally limited to reduce the attack surface of Bitcoin. And um what BIT BM does, it's uh it's kind of like hacking around these limitations. It's like uh a compilation of a couple tricks that allow you to uh overcome the limitations of Bitcoin script. And yeah, to express more uh expressive smart contracts on Bitcoin. OK. But in terms of what, what's out there right now, what's the difference? Um Yeah, you can express more stuff than you, you were used to like um in Bitcoin script, you can mostly express stuff like multi signatures, maybe also hash logs and um the basic stuff that enables also lightning and stuff like that. But um you cannot, for example, bridge Bitcoin to a side chain that is not possible today. Um But BIT VM might enable that. And, and how do you see it differing from what's available on the Ethereum chain right now? When, when, when you, if this were to to be launched, uh what, what kind of structure makes it either comparable, better or worse if you will uh than what's, what's on Ethereum. Um Yeah, Ethereum is designed to facilitate this smart contracts and Bitcoin is not um what we are doing here is um we are, we are, we are applying tricks to mimic what Ethereum is doing. So, uh in the end, it will not be quite as expressive as Ethereum is. Um however, these bridges uh they can enable or like they, they can allow you to bridge Bitcoin to a side chain and that side chain could run essentially the same code as assume and then you could have essentially um yeah, BT C in uh the EBM in, in, in the same smart contracting machine as on a theory, what would be the need for doing it on Bitcoin and not on Ethereum? Yeah. Well, Bitcoin is a hard asset. Bitcoin is hard to change and Bitcoin is by far the number one asset in the world, it's the strongest brand and it's uh the currency that we all love, I think. And that's why we should do it with B BT C and with it, what are some of the potential applications you see here that would be better run in the Bitcoin ecosystem than the Ethereum? One of course, um you mentioned a bunch of problems that you're trying to solve that exist in the Ethereum network. Of course, layer twos have solved, solved some of the issues that you're trying to solve. What are some of the potential applications that might attract developers and users to Bitcoin versus Ethereum? Yeah, I'm personally mostly interested into scalability um uh I wanna see Bitcoin scaling to, as I said, a million transactions per second. And um yeah, I think that would be great to uh see Bitcoin being used as a currency for, yeah, daily, daily life payments and uh for basically any kinds of payments. And uh it would be great if we could um process that many transactions. And are there any limitations here with uh bit VM that you anticipate? Oh yeah, it's, as I said, it's like that's uh it's piling tricks on top of each other to mimic what Ethereum is doing. And um one thing that is very different than the EVM is that um in, in BVM, you always need a verifier. Um So there is like some party doing this, this pack doing this bridge and then there is um there could be like hundreds of very fires and um all of them, they are uh surveilling uh the uh the person that is facilitating the bridge and they are verifying that um they stay honest and if they don't stay honest, then the verifier can punish um the bridge. So this is a white paper. How, how long do you think it would take to get it uh on the ground? Um Yeah, we are developing um the first version of it. Hopefully, hopefully by the end of this week we have like something that's like very early uh like uh like developers can, can start playing around with um there won't be anything that uh will be usable by, by, by regular people. But um yeah, we, we hope we can get something into the hands of, of developers who uh I really want to go into the nitty gritty and like uh check out all the details of how it works under the hood. And um yeah, from there, we will advance it as, as quickly as possible. Many people are excited about it, many people are supporting it. Uh Many people are contributing ideas and uh also code and um yeah, hopefully by the end of the year, we will see the first experimental use cases. Robin, thank you very much for joining us and unpacking your white paper. We look forward to seeing some of those use cases by the end of the year. Thanks a lot for having me. That was Euro Zinc co-founder, Robin Linus."

        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction as $3 Billion Trading Volume Sends ETH Past $1,600 \u2013 Time to Buy?\n\nAmidst turbulent market conditions, Ethereum has garnered attention as its trading volume surpassed $2.6 billion, propelling its price beyond the $1,600 mark. As of now, Ethereum is trading at $1,632, experiencing a slight dip of 0.20% in the past 24 hours.\n\nHolding its position as the second-ranked cryptocurrency on CoinMarketCap, Ethereum boasts a live market cap of $196 billion with a circulating supply of 120,224,407 ETH coins.\n\nHowever, not everything is smooth sailing. The much-anticipated Holesky testnet launch for Ethereum faced unforeseen challenges, leading to an imminent relaunch in the upcoming weeks.\n\nThis dynamic landscape raises the question: is it the opportune moment to invest in Ethereum?\n\nRelaunch Anticipated: Hiccups & Highlights from Ethereum\u2019s Holesky Testnet Debut\n\nEthereum\u2018s Holesky testnet launch faced a hiccup on September 15th, necessitating a relaunch.\n\nHere\u2019s a quick update on the matter:\n\nIssue Origin : Diederik Loerakker, an Ethereum researcher known as protolambda, pinpointed the problem. An error in the entry of specific data in the network\u2019s genesis files led to a testnet launch failure.\n\n: Diederik Loerakker, an Ethereum researcher known as protolambda, pinpointed the problem. An error in the entry of specific data in the network\u2019s genesis files led to a testnet launch failure. Specifically, incorrect data placement occurred in the EL Holesky genesis.json instead of the CL genesis.ssz.\n\nSomeone put 0x686f77206d7563682069732074686520666973683f (\"how much is the fish?\") as extra-data in the EL Holesky genesis.json, and not in the CL genesis.ssz\n\n\n\nMisconfiguration, network failed to launch.\n\n\n\nAlso, some other fork params in releases are rumored to mismatch too.\n\n\n\nNeed\u2026 \u2014 proto.eth (@protolambda) September 15, 2023\n\nOther Potential Concerns : Apart from this misconfiguration, there are rumors of other mismatched fork parameters. However, Loerakker didn\u2019t delve into specifics.\n\n: Apart from this misconfiguration, there are rumors of other mismatched fork parameters. However, Loerakker didn\u2019t delve into specifics. Previous Concerns Resolved: Despite the current challenges, Holesky did not face anticipated issues related to its network size. In a prior assessment in August, it was determined that Holesky could accommodate 1.4 million validators, leading to the introduction of a staggering 1.6 billion Holesky ETH tokens.\n\nHolesky launch update!\n\n\n\nDue to a misconfiguration in the ExtraData field (applied to EL configs but not to CL ones), #Holesky didn't initiate properly.\n\n\n\nA consensus has been reached among the EF DevOps and client teams to relaunch a week from now. \u2014 Nethermind (@NethermindEth) September 15, 2023\n\nRelaunch Timeline : An official date for Holesky\u2019s relaunch remains unspecified. Nethermind, an Ethereum-focused group, anticipates the next attempt around September 22nd. Michael Sproul, an Ethereum contributor from Sigma Prime, proposed a later date of September 28th in a GitHub pull request.\n\n: Mainnet Unaffected : It\u2019s crucial to note that this setback doesn\u2019t influence Ethereum\u2019s mainnet, which handles transactions with genuine value.

Both platforms cater to testing processes involving staking, validation, and essential network enhancements. Furthermore, there exists another testnet, Sepolia, tailored for developers keen on examining their Ethereum-centric applications. Testnet ETH: Tokens on these testnets, commonly referred to as testnet ETH, can be accessed freely through faucets and typically lack real-world monetary worth.\n\nThis summary explains recent challenges and developments regarding Ethereum\u2019s Holesky testnet. Let\u2019s now examine the technical outlook of Ethereum.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction\n\nEthereum\u2018s current price trajectory indicates potential for an upward shift above the critical $1,650 mark against the US Dollar. A consolidation above this level, particularly between $1,650 and $1,670, could herald a bullish momentum.\n\nHaving built a foundation above $1,580, Ethereum progressed past the $1,620 resistance, aligning its trajectory with Bitcoin.\n\nPresently, it hovers above the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average and the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement from its recent swing, positioning itself favorably against the pivotal $1,650 resistance.\n\nEthereum Price Chart \u2013 Source: Tradingview\n\nAscending beyond this could propel it towards $1,670, and, eventually, the significant $1,750 resistance.\n\nConversely, failure to breach the $1,650 threshold may see it retract to supports at $1,630, $1,610, or even $1,580. A further decline could risk a downturn to approximately $1,520.\n\nIn addition to Ethereum, exploring investment options in the realm of cryptocurrency has become a popular trend among investors.\n\nWall Street Memes \u2013 The Alternative Coin Worth Considering\n\nOne of the emerging investment options that has caught the attention of many is the $WSM presale, which represents a meme coin.\n\nThis coin has generated significant excitement among the investment community, originating from the Wall Street Memes online community that caters to enthusiasts in this field.\n\nThe Wall Street Memes crypto project began its presale on May 26, 2023, and can be accessed through their official portal wallstmemes.com.\n\nDuring its initial stage, the WSM token was offered for $0.025. The first day of the presale earned over $300,000, and the total collection reached $25 million.\n\nLast Call for Wall Street Memes Presale\n\nCountdown to End: 8 days, 8 hours.\n\nOver $25 million already raised.\n\nalready raised.
