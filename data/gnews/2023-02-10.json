        "title": "Ethereum price risks 20% correction amid SEC's crackdown on crypto staking - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s native token, Ether (ETH), saw its worst daily performance of the year as the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) stopped Kraken, a cryptocurrency exchange, from offering crypto staking services.\n\nOn Feb. 9, Kraken agreed to pay $30 million to settle the SEC\u2019s allegation that it broke securities rules by offering crypto staking services to U.S. retail investors.\n\nIn particular, the news pushed down the prices of many proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain project tokens. Ethereum, which switched to a staking-based protocol in September 2022, also suffered.\n\nOn Feb. 9, ETH\u2019s price plunged nearly 6.5% to around $1,525, the largest single-day decline since Dec. 16 of last year.\n\nETH/USD daily price chart. Source: TradingView.com\n\nWill Ethereum staking survive the SEC crackdown?\n\nThe SEC's crackdown on crypto staking begins as Ethereum awaits the release of its key network upgrade, dubbed Shanghai, in March.\n\nThe update will finally allow Ether validators \u2014 entities that have locked approximately $25.6 billion worth of ETH tokens in Ethereum\u2019s PoS smart contract \u2014 to withdraw their assets alongside yield rewards.\n\nAs a result, multiple analysts, including Bitwise Asset Management\u2019s chief investment officer, Matt Hougan, consider Shanghai a bullish event for Ether.\n\n\u201cToday, many investors who would like to stake ETH and earn yield are sitting on the sidelines. After all, most investment strategies can\u2019t tolerate an indefinite lock-up,\u201d wrote Hougan in his letter to investors in January, adding:\n\n\u201cSo, most investors stay out of the market. But once that indefinite lock-up is removed, the percentage of investors willing to stake their ETH will explode.\u201c\n\nBut doubts have been emerging about the future of crypto staking in the U.S., with Brian Armstrong, the CEO of Coinbase crypto exchange, fearing that the SEC would ban staking for retail investors in the future.\n\n1/ We're hearing rumors that the SEC would like to get rid of crypto staking in the U.S. for retail customers. I hope that's not the case as I believe it would be a terrible path for the U.S. if that was allowed to happen. \u2014 Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) February 8, 2023\n\nMoreover, some analysts argue that banning Ether-staking services will force users to move away from Ethereum.\n\nNotably, Ethereum requires stakers to deposit 32 ETH (~$50,000) into its PoS smart contract to be a validator. As a result, retail investors often use third-party staking services that pool smaller amounts of ETH to enable validator status.\n\n\u201cIf the SEC bans crypto staking for the public, then a majority of Ethereum validators will have to come down,\u201d argues independent analyst Ripple Van Winkle, adding:\n\n\u201cBecause you need 32 ETH to stake. Which means the ETH network is going to experience issues.\u201c\n\nETH price sees bearish rejection\n\nFrom a technical perspective, Ether price is positioned for a potential 20% price correction in February.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin price hits 2-week low amid warning $22.5K loss means fresh dip\n\nNotably, on the daily chart, ETH price has been undergoing a pullback move after testing its multimonth descending trendline as resistance. It now holds the 200-day exponential moving average (200-day EMA; the blue wave) near $1,525 as support.\n\nETH/USD daily price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nEther risks dropping below the 200-day EMA support wave owing to its negative market fundamentals. Such a scenario includes the next downside target at $1,200, which coincides with a multimonth ascending trendline support.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "title": "What the Kraken Crackdown Means for Ethereum Staking - Decrypt",
        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nThere\u2019s a lot at stake in how Kraken\u2019s settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission plays out for the crypto industry.\n\nOn Thursday afternoon, the SEC announced that crypto exchange Kraken agreed to pay a $30 million fine for not registering the offering and sale of its crypto asset staking-as-a-service program. Just a day before, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong warned on Twitter that he\u2019d heard \u201cthe SEC would like to get rid of crypto staking in the U.S. for retail customers.\u201d\n\nOn its face, it sounds like something that should have been bad for all crypto staking services. But that\u2019s not quite how the news landed. The governance tokens for Lido and Rocket Pool, two of the largest pooled staking services, soared as high as 11% in the past day, according to CoinGecko.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt\u2019s a sign that the market thinks centralized exchanges acting as staking intermediaries, like Kraken and Coinbase, should worry, but not the rest of the industry. In the past day, Coinbase Wrapped Staked ETH (cbETH) selling volume has outpaced buying at a ratio of almost 3:1, according to GeckoTerminal.\n\nStaked assets on proof-of-stake networks, like Ethereum, help keep networks running. They\u2019re how validators, whose hardware stores data and processes new transactions, prove they have skin in the game. Validators receive rewards for participating on networks, but can lose some of their staked assets for inactivity or other offenses.\n\nBecoming a standalone Ethereum validator, which is now the largest proof of stake network, isn\u2019t easy for most retail-level investors. A user would need 32 ETH, worth roughly $48,000 at current prices, to do it. Instead, users with more modest amounts of ETH to stake turn to staking-as-a-service and pooled staking providers.\n\nThose come in two different flavors: straightforward and liquid staking. The latter is meant to give users the best of both worlds: They get a share of validator rewards for their deposited ETH and a token, redeemable for their staked assets, that can be traded or used as collateral.\n\nAs a category, the 65 liquid-staking protocols tracked by DeFi Llama account for $12 billion, or 26%, of the $47 billion worth of assets in the DeFi ecosystem. That means they\u2019re the third-largest category behind $13 billion in lending, and $19 billion on decentralized exchanges, or DEXes.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMore than $11 billion worth of the assets in liquid-staking protocols is Ethereum. And among the 16 protocols that support ETH staking, Lido is far and away the largest. It accounts for $8 billion, or 75%, of the funds that have been deposited.\n\nIt seems at least part of the problem the SEC had with Kraken\u2019s program was an oversimplification of staking to make it less intimidating for retail customers. A section of the SEC\u2019s complaint takes issue with the fact that Kraken itself determined the returns that its customers would receive, as opposed to the variable rate of rewards determined by the protocol.\n\n\u201cDefendants determine these returns, not the underlying blockchain protocols, and the returns are not necessarily dependent on the actual returns that Kraken receives from staking,\u201d the commission wrote.\n\nBy doing so, Kraken made itself too much of an intermediary, Alex Mogul, senior director of staking and infrastructure at Republic Crypto, told Decrypt.\n\n\u201cWhen you're depositing to Kraken and then Kraken handles the math, that\u2019s far and away easier than trying to switch the network that you're engaging with, then press transact to delegate stake. It is really complicated,\u201d she said.\n\nFor its part, Coinbase has said its staking program is not like Kraken\u2019s.\n\n\u201cStaking on Coinbase continues to be available and staked assets continue to earn protocol rewards. What\u2019s clear from today\u2019s announcement is that Kraken was essentially offering a yield product,\u201d Paul Grewal, Coinbase\u2019s chief legal officer, said in a statement yesterday. \u201cCoinbase\u2019s staking services are fundamentally different and are not securities. For example, our customers\u2019 rewards depend on the rewards paid by the protocol, and commissions we disclose.\u201d\n\nMogul, who leads the Runtime staking-as-a-service offering at Republic Crypto, said she hopes to see software, like better designed wallets, fill the gap that might now be left by centralized exchanges in staking options.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI still think we can build software products that abstract that complexity without sacrificing who's in custody of the assets,\u201d she said.\n\nOn the other end of the investor spectrum, Jaydeep Korde, Launchnodes co-Founder and CEO, said the Kraken settlement will push business towards decentralized alternatives.\n\nHis company offers non-custodial staking solutions for institutions or high-net-worth individuals who have the 32 ETH required to run their own node, but don\u2019t want to handle the tech on their own. The user owns the infrastructure used to operate a validator, but Launchnodes handles all the upkeep.\n\n\u201cBy running your staking operations on infrastructure you own, it avoids needing to trust compliant, regulated or non-regulated crypto businesses that are seemingly ever bigger governance and operational holes,\u201d he told Decrypt in an email."
