The plaintiffs, a group of investors, claimed that Uniswap violated US securities laws by failing to register as an exchange or broker-dealer while offering and soliciting securities on an unregistered exchange. However, the court ruled that the true defendants in the case were the issuers of the \"scam tokens\" listed on Uniswap, and not the DEX itself.\n\nThe ruling is a significant victory for the DeFi (decentralized finance) industry, as it clarifies how US securities laws apply to DeFi transactions. The court also noted that Uniswap, as a decentralized platform, cannot control which tokens are listed or who can interact with it.\n\nThe case against Uniswap was built on the transfer of title theory, which argues that by drafting the smart contracts that enabled token transactions, Uniswap was effectively transferring the title of the tokens to the plaintiffs.
