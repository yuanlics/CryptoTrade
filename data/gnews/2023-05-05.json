This is the first time he has sold any of his ETCG shares, according to SEC filings. The sale represents a small portion of the fund's $225M assets under management and 14M outstanding shares, of which Silbert is a 10% shareholder. The sale was brokered by Cannacord Genuity on April 28 on the OTCQX market. Silbert's shares were originally purchased in privately negotiated transactions between 2017-2018. The sale is somewhat surprising given Silbert's history as a crypto \"permbull.\" DCG-owned lending desk Genesis owes $630M to Gemini, a crypto exchange and custodian owned by the Winklevoss twins, and the companies have entered into a 30-day mediation process to settle the outstanding loan balance."

Hydra introduces a novel scaling solution that could make Cardano the fastest and most scalable network. Cardano has long been vying for a spot among the top cryptocurrency projects, and with Hydra, it has solidified its position as a major player. Hydra is an isomorphic scaling solution that replicates Cardano's functionality and security guarantees on an off-chain ledger network while maintaining communication between the two layers. It operates similarly to state-channel solutions like Bitcoin's Lightning Network and Ethereum's Raiden Network, allowing users to securely and instantly perform transactions on private networks and settle the result on the main chain. Hydra brings a solid solution, allowing Cardano to compete with Ethereum and Bitcoin. However, comparing or saying one is better wouldn't be fair, as each scalability solution has its pros and cons and addresses different challenges."

Issuers use decentralized governance structures like DAOs and proof-of-stake consensus mechanisms to distribute control and reduce reliance on a central group. This makes it less likely for regulators to classify assets as securities, as there is no central coordinator driving up value. By involving multiple parties in the growth and decision-making process, decentralization reduces reliance on a single \"third party\" and meets the Howey test requirement for investment returns."
