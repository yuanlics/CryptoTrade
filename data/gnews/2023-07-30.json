        "title": "Alibaba, silver, gold, Bitcoin, Ethereum: Mike Novogratz's ideal portfolio - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Galaxy Digital founder Mike Novogratz shared what an ideal investment portfolio would look like for a young and high-risk tolerance investor during an interview with Bloomberg Wealth, saying that he\u2019d invest in the Chinese giant Alibaba, silver, gold, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethe(ETH).\n\n\u201cIf they were young and had a high-risk tolerance, I\u2019d be buying Alibaba stock. I\u2019d be buying silver, gold, Bitcoin and Ethereum. That\u2019d be my portfolio,\u201d he said in allusion to someone investing $100,000. For those with lower risk tolerance, he recommended allocating only 30% of a portfolio in the example, with the remaining 70% in bonds and perhaps index funds.\n\nNovogratz\u2019s bullish stance on Bitcoin received a boost from BlackRock's application for a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in June. In his opinion, the application was the biggest Bitcoin development of 2023.\n\n\u201cThe most important thing that happened this year in Bitcoin is Larry Fink.\u201d\n\nRelated: Grayscale urges SEC to approve all Bitcoin ETFs simultaneously\n\nFink, the billionaire CEO of BlackRock, was initially a \u201cnonbeliever,\u201d Novogratz said.\n\n\u201cNow he says, \u2018Hey, this is going to be a global currency. People around the world all trust it.\u2019 He got \u2018orange-pilled,\u2019 as we say. Orange pill is when you take a nonbeliever, and you make them a believer in Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nBlackRock's push into Bitcoin is part of an adoption cycle, according to Novogratz, which could lead the price of Bitcoin to reach new highs, especially if the Federal Reserve starts cutting interest rates.\n\nAlso commenting on the recent decision in Ripple's case vs. the Securities and Exchange Commission, in which Ripple\u2019s XRP (XRP) token has been partially classified as a security, Novogratz stated that the decision was a victory for the crypto industry as it proves that \u201cthe rules are nothing close to clear.\u201d\n\nMagazine: Should you \u2018orange pill\u2019 children?

        "content": "The sales of Ethereum and Polygon-minted NFTs on OpenSea have fallen to their lowest level this year.\n\nBlur continues to overshadow OpenSea in terms of monthly trading volume.\n\nThe monthly sales volume of Ethereum and Polygon-based non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the leading marketplace OpenSea has plummeted to its lowest point this year as July draws to a close, data from Dune Analytics revealed.\n\nInformation from the on-chain data provider revealed that the monthly sales of Ethereum-minted NFTs on the marketplace reached an impressive peak of $659.02 million in February before experiencing a subsequent downturn.\n\nWith one day left in July, the total sales volume at press time was $120.79 million. This represented an 82% drop in monthly sales volume on OpenSea since the February high.\n\nSimilarly, following a record-breaking NFT sales volume of $109.12 million in February, Polygon-based NFTs on OpenSea have received decreased patronage from OpenSea\u2019s users. In fact, following the February high, the NFTs in this category proceeded to close the first quarter of the year with a whopping 98% decline in sales volume.\n\nIn the last 30 days, the sales volume of Polygon-minted NFTs on the marketplace totaled $8.35 million, a 92% decline in under six months.\n\nNaturally, the fall in NFTs sales count in July culminated in the decline in sales volume. According to data from Dune Analytics, only 258,798 Ethereum-minted NFTs have been sold on OpenSea this month. This was a 43% drop from the 450,325 total NFTs sold by the end of June.\n\nThe marketplace recorded its highest monthly count of Ethereum NFTs sold in January. Per data from Dune Analytics, OpenSea ended the 31-day trading period with an NFT sales count of 1.14 million. This has since trended downward.\n\nInterestingly, despite the shortfall in sales volume, the count of Polygon NFTs sold on OpenSea this month has surpassed the total count from June. In the past 30 days, 296,343 Polygon-minted NFTs have been traded on OpenSea. This was a 29% jump from the 228,859 total NFTs sold in June.\n\nBlur leaves OpenSea in a daze\n\nBlur continues to dominate OpenSea regarding monthly NFT trading volume, data from DappRadar revealed. According to the data provider, NFTs trading volume on Blur totaled $378.41 million. OpenSea trailed behind it with a trading volume of $126 million, registering a 25% drop during that period.\n\nHowever, during the period under review, OpenSea recorded an influx of traders than Blur did. According to DappRadar, traders that completed NFTs transactions on OpenSea in the last month totaled 305,295. Blur saw a mere 35,304 traders."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\n\u201cIf you build it, they will come,\u201d a mysterious voice whispered to Kevin Costner in Field of Dreams\u2014yet the phrase seems to ring equally true for degens in search of lucrative gains on Coinbase\u2019s Ethereum layer-2 network Base.\n\nThe network, which Coinbase launched for developers on July 13, has seen an influx of recent activity related to meme coins. Traders are snapping up obscure tokens like BALD, COIN, and BASED on the network using the decentralized exchange LeetSwap.\n\nLeetSwap has recorded nearly $200 million in trading volume over the past day across 377,000 transactions, according to DEX Screener. Aside from RocketSwap, LeetSwap is the only other decentralized exchange on Base where tokens can trade without reliance on financial intermediaries.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMore than half of LeetSwap\u2019s daily trading volume was comprised of BALD transactions. The token, possibly a reference to Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong\u2019s shaved head, has surged close to 3,100% over the past day to $0.06718.\n\nBASED had bounced more than 1,000,000% over the same period, and it currently trades hands at $0.02916. The token, despite being around for less than a day, has already notched a market capitalization of $291 million.\n\nOther nascent tokens have notched dizzying gains. Not to be confused with Coinbase\u2019s stock ticker name on the Nasdaq, COIN eclipsed $0.17 on around $1.1 million in daily trading volume, posting gains of 15,400% over the past 24 hours.\n\nBase\u2019s public launch is slated for August. And at the moment, there\u2019s no official way for traders to bridge Ethereum from its mainnet over to Base. However, a so-called Portal Proxy Contract allows developers to do just that.\n\nOn Sunday alone, $54 million of Ethereum had been bridged to Base, according to a Dune Analytics dashboard. The day before, less than $750,000 worth of Ethereum was ported over to Base.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHowever, withdrawing tokens from Base before its public launch is less straightforward than sending Ethereum to a smart contract. Coinbase provides a link to a GitHub repository for developers with details on how to achieve that.\n\nCoinbase built Base in collaboration with Optimism, the Ethereum scaling solution that uses Optimistic Rollups to process transactions in batches and reduce fees.\n\nDecentralized exchanges are a common venue for meme coin mania to take hold. Anyone can create a token, and without strict parameters for which ones get listed, decentralized exchanges are perhaps about as Wild West as crypto gets.\n\nNoted crypto influencer Lady of Crypto said on Twitter that degens were effectively gambling with their hard-earned Ethereum. While she said she\u2019d bridged over some funds to partake in the mania, she also warned followers to be vigilant against scammers and rug pulls.\n\n\u201cI fully expect to lose it all,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you are going to gamble on BASE, make sure it's money you can afford to lose.\u201d\n\nYou hear some people made 40,000% or whatever buying $BALD. You google how to bridge your ETH to $BASE and you move it over. You are going to be so rich. You know it. You are going to turn $100 into $1 million, retire, buy that Lambo and finally get a gf. It's all so easy... \ud83d\udc47\u2026 \u2014 Lady of Crypto (@LadyofCrypto1) July 30, 2023"
