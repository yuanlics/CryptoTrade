        "summary": "  Ethereum layer-2 (L-2) activity has seen a significant increase since last quarter, with more than 20 separate networks built to improve scalability and efficiency. Airdrop farming is a key driver of this growth, with users performing certain actions to receive free tokens. The most active L-2 networks include zkSync, Polygon (zkEVM), and Optimism, with Stargate, a LayerZero bridge and airdrop candidate, having seven times more active users but only around half the volume of Uniswap. While some have suggested that airdrop hunting may account for a significant portion of L-2 volume, LayerZero CEO Bryan Pellegrino believes it is only around 54%."
