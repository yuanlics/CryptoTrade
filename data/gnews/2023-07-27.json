        "content": "The storage focused layer2 network on Ethereum, EthStorage raised $7 million in the seed funding round.\n\nEthStorage aims to scale Ethereum by a different approach of focusing on storage. It has developed a layer 2 storage rollup which significantly increases Etehreum\u2019s storage capacity.\n\nThe funding round was led by dao5 and participation from investors including SevenX Ventures, Foresight Ventures, Dragon Roark, Sky9 Capital and several others. The funds are raised via SAFT (Simple Agreement for Future Tokens).\n\nEthStorage is currently in the developing phase and it has previously received two development grants from the Ethereum Foundation.\n\nClaiming to increase Ethereum\u2019s storage capacity from terabyte (TB) level to the petabyte (PB) level, EthStorage uses KZG commitment and Reed-Solomon code to boost data upload speed. It utilizes dynamic data sharding to prove data retention.\n\nAmong different L2 networks, EthStorage differs as it focuses on scaling Ethereum\u2019s storage capability. The developer community platform, Gitcoin also announced layer 2 \u2018PGN\u2019 recently."

        "title": "Airdrop farming propelling growth in Ethereum layer-2 activity - Blockworks",
        "content": "Since last quarter, Ethereum layer-2s have witnessed vastly more activity than Ethereum mainnet, marking a significant increase compared to last year.\n\nThe average total transactions per second (TPS) of those chains seeking to scale Ethereum stood at roughly 45.3 \u2014 four times greater than Ethereum\u2019s 11.91 TPS, data shows.\n\nNow that multiple layer-2 rollups have come online, activity is 287% busier than a year ago. There are now more than 20 separate L-2 networks built atop Ethereum, all aiming to improve scalability and efficiency, reducing the cost per transaction.\n\nThe amount of computational resources, known as \u201cgas,\u201d used on the Ethereum network every month to validate and settle transactions taking place on L-2s also remains elevated this year.\n\nL-2 growth appears to be concentrated around airdrop farming transactions Sam Holman, derivatives analyst at Australian trading firm Zerocap, told Blockworks. Airdrop farming is a process where users perform certain actions to be eligible to receive free tokens.\n\n\u201cIf you look into the specific chains the volumes have increased on, you\u2019ll see [zkSync] Era and also Polygon [zkEVM] having an elevated contribution, as well as Optimism.\u201d\n\nA notable uptick in L-2 volume was also observed following Arbitrum\u2019s airdrop in March, as airdrop hunters migrated from there to zkSync speculating on the eventual debut of a native token to reward early adopters.\n\nUsers transacting on Optimism are primarily doing so via platforms like Uniswap V3 and Stargate, DappRadar daily volume data shows.\n\nAs it stands, Stargate, a LayerZero bridge and airdrop candidate, has about seven times more active users though only around half of the volume of Uniswap. Holman pointed to users cycling through different addresses, repeating the same transactions, to inflate their chances of getting a higher airdrop allocation.\n\n\u201cI would put down the consistent volume through Stargate to farmers trying to be eligible for the LayerZero token,\u201d Holman said. \u201cIt\u2019s the cheapest chain to bridge funds on and a lot of the market seems to think the number of transactions will be a primary criterion for a LayerZero airdrop.\u201d\n\nLayerZero CEO Bryan Pellegrino recently told Blockworks\u2019 0xResearch podcast that, in his view, airdrop hunting was not a dominant factor, but perhaps accounts for around 54% of the volume.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t spend too much time thinking about it \u2014 ultimately it\u2019s something that\u2019s outside of my control,\u201d Pellegrino said. \u201cRight now, if 98% of the volume was [airdrop farmers] it would still be the most used bridge in the world by a factor of like 4.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "Top Trader Predicts One Ethereum Rival Will Repeat Parabolic ETH Rallies of Past Cycle - The Daily Hodl",
        "content": "A closely followed strategist is predicting that one Ethereum (ETH) rival will repeat the competitor\u2019s parabolic rally from the last crypto cycle.\n\nPseudonymous analyst The Flow Horse, also known as Cantering Clark, tells his 179,700 Twitter followers that Solana (SOL) is mirroring the price action of ETH before a massive move to the upside.\n\n\u201cIn a private group (can\u2019t dox Excel chart of picks or people), my pick for the best-performing coin of the bounce this year was SOL. The idea that a darling of the last cycle would do very well. I shared this chart of the beginnings of ETH vs. SOL, and I still think SOL probably does more or less the same. The cheering got pretty loud for this one.\u201d\n\nAccording to his chart, SOL\u2019s recent price action to the $27 level mirrors ETH\u2019s sudden move to $280 in 2020. ETH then went on a parabolic rally, which he says SOL will likely mirror as well.\n\nSolana is trading for $25.23 at time of writing, up 8.7% during the last 24 hours.\n\nThe trader also weighs in on Bitcoin (BTC) and ETH and says that the top two performing digital assets are in an uptrend with most investors taking long positions and accumulating.\n\n\u201cI think I have probably beat this drum during every stream, and weekly here on Twitter now for the last six months. The view around BTC, ETH, and a handful of others is much longer now. Spot bags are built and there are no outright shorts. Everything short is trading around a core position.\u201d\n\nBitcoin is trading for $29,459 at time of writing, up 0.8% in the last 24 hours, while Ethereum is worth $1,868, up 0.4% in the last 24 hours.\n\nAlso on the trader\u2019s radar is the declining market cap of stablecoins, which indicates a decline in liquidity in the overall crypto markets.\n\nHe says that the market cap of stablecoins will likely start to increase either when there is an approval of a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) or the halving event expected in April of next year when miners\u2019 rewards are cut in half.\n\n\u201cCryptos own money supply. We aren\u2019t there yet and we need a catalyst.\n\nBlackRock ETF could be it. Halving is a close second.\u201d\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "title": "Crypto Price Today: Bitcoin below $29,500; Ethereum above $1,850; Solana rises 6%, Toncoin falls 4% - Business Today",
        "content": "Bitcoin and other crypto tokens were trading higher on Thursday after the US Federal Reserve announced that it will increase the interest rates by 25 basis points, which was on the expected lines. However, the US central lender said that it is open to push rates again, if need be, which capped the gains in the digital assets.\n\n\n\nBitcoin extended its gains on Thursday as the largest crypto token added as much as a per cent but remained below 29,500-mark. However, Its largest peer, Ethereum outperformed and gained more than a per cent but it also remained below $1,900-levels. Price in the action altcoins was on the higher side.\n\n\n\nAfter the US Federal Reserve raised its interest rates by 25 basis points, as anticipated by the market, most cryptocurrencies experienced a slight increase. This rate hike was the highest since 2001, said Edul Patel, Co-founder and CEO at Mudrex.\n\n\n\n\"Bitcoin, which had dipped to a low of $29,097 on Tuesday, has now shown signs of recovery and is trading above the $29,400 mark. However, to fend off the aggressive bears, the bulls need to drive the price back up and maintain it above the $31,000 threshold. Meanwhile, Ethereum was observed being traded at the $1,870 level,\" he said.\n\n\n\nBarring a few exceptions, all other top crypto tokens were trading higher on Thursday. Solana surged about 6 per cent, while Polygon and Bitcoin Cash added 3 per cent each. Cardano, Litcoin and Polkadot rose 2 per cent each for the day. Among the laggards, Toncoin shed 4 per cent and Dogecoin was down over 2 per cent each.\n\n\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market cap was trading quite higher, rising down to $1.19 trillion-mark as it gained about a per cent in the last 24 hours. However, the total trading volumes jumped more than 16 per cent to $30.56 billion.\n\n\n\nBitcoin has remained relatively stagnant, stuck below the $30,000 level, primarily due to apprehension surrounding the Federal Reserve's upcoming decision on rate hike, which is widely expected to include a 25-basis point. Bitcoin investment products suffered a $13 million outflow last week, said CoinDCX Research Team.\n\n\n\n\"XRP has emerged as the most traded altcoin of 2023 so far, with a record-breaking $150 billion trading volume. The crypto has benefited from the recent court ruling that it is not a security, capturing the attention of traders worldwide and signaling a potential shift in how crypto assets are perceived and regulated,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nTech View by WazirX Trade Desk\n\nClover Finance, also known as Clover, functions as a blockchain operating system that offers a comprehensive and user-friendly blockchain infrastructure. It includes a framework compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) for Substrate-based applications, providing a convenient all-in-one solution.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the weekly time period, the CLV/USDT trend has broken out of the descending triangle pattern with a jump in trading volumes. The token has gained over 2% in the last 24 hours. The price is expected to have a positive trajectory in the coming days. The next resistance is expected at $0.57 and an immediate support is expected at $0.36 levels.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Views and recommendations given in this section are the analysts' own and do not represent those of Business Today.

        "title": "Top 3 Price Prediction Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple: BTC remains unbothered by Fed's diplomatic comments in FOMC - FXStreet",
        "content": "Share:\n\nBitcoin price maintains an overall uptrend with critical support at $29,000 as the FOMC decision comes as expected.\n\nEthereum price requires a substantial push to surpass $1,873 and break from below the 50-day EMA foothold.\n\nRipple price faces initial resistance at $0.7237 (50-day EMA) with pullback potential on the three-hour chart.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price continues to hover above Monday's low at $28,830, not giving traders an opportunity to get in on the recovery rally. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting failed to induce volatility as chairman Jerome Powell hinted at meeting-by-meeting decisions based on data. This sentiment is shared for Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) prices, flashing green with lean margins. The meager surges come as Fed Chairman Jerome Powell committed to a data-dependent approach to interest rate hikes. Despite a sell-off in the US Dollar, Bitcoin price remains rangebound, with little volatility post-FOMC.\n\nMacroeconomics priced in\n\nThe little volatility witnessed in the crypto market, pre and post-FOMC, shows that the macroeconomics had already been priced. Notably, traders anticipated the 0.25% rate hike. Since markets tend to react to developments that investors were not expecting, Fed Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s comments today did not move the market. Now crypto has fallen back to regular programming, driven by natural or plain buying and selling activity.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin and crypto market unphased as FOMC commits to a meeting-by-meeting approach.\n\nBitcoin Price finds support following FOMC report\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price on the four-chart exhibits an ascending broadening wedge pattern. The current support level at $29,000 is critical to watch as a breach of this level could signal a potentially bearish scenario. Despite the current support, the overall uptrend remains intact.\n\nTraders should closely monitor the ascending support trendline, which is crucial in determining future price action. However, a bearish scenario may come into play if the price breaks down below the ascending support trendline; the same trendline then acts as a resistance. This would signal a potential trend reversal and indicate a shift from a bullish to bearish market sentiment.\n\nBTC/USDT 4-hour chart\n\nIn the event of a breakdown below the trendline, the next important support level for Bitcoin price is $28,452, standing 2.93% below the current price level. A breach of this support may lead to further downside momentum. However, it is worth noting that the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) histograms have just crossed above the zero line, indicating a recent increase in buying activity, albeit with limited volume.\n\nAlso Read: Federal Reserve raises interest rates by 25 bps, Bitcoin price floats above $29,000\n\nEthereum price faces consolidation as indicators flash bearish\n\nEthereum (ETH) price for the daily timeframe indicates prices falling below the 50-EMA and encountering resistance at the 38% Fibonacci Retracement level at $1,873. A break and close above this level could potentially change the trend, but technical indicators suggest this is unlikely in the short term. The Awesome Oscillators (AO) histograms show bearish pressure with a red color below the zero line, and the RSI is moving in the middle.\n\nETH/USD 1-Day Chart\n\nCurrently, support is at the 50% Retracement level at $1,827, approximately 1.7% below the current price level. The market seems to be consolidating within the $1,827 and $1,873 range, as the 25 bps rate hike decision of the FOMC has already been priced in.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum classic is looking for more gains\n\nRipple price faces possible pullback - break and close above 25-EMA\n\nRipple (XRP) price on the three-hour chart reveals that the remittance token is encountering initial resistance at $0.7128, coinciding with the position of the 25-EMA. A decisive breakthrough and subsequent close above this level could pave the way for further price gains toward the subsequent resistance at $0.7754.\n\nHowever, the crossover of the higher 50-EMA below the 25-EMA indicates a bearish sentiment, possibly leading to a prolonged consolidation period. In this case, the initial support lies at $0.6673.\n\nXRP/USD 3-hour chart\n\nNonetheless, there are indications of buying pressure as depicted by the AO Oscillator histograms displaying green bars, accompanied by the Relative Strength Index (RSI) trending higher. These factors suggest some positive momentum in XRP price movement in the short run. Traders should wait for any closing above $0.7128 to enter long.\n\nAlso Read: SEC vs. Ripple update: Pro crypto lawyer outlines four options for the regulator to fight the XRP ruling"
