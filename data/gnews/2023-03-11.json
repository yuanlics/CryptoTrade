        "content": "Liquid Staking Narrative Gains Momentum Ahead of Ethereum\u2019s Shapella Upgrades\n\nBy: Samuel Haig \u2022 Loading...\n\nDeFi News\n\nLido, the leading DeFi protocol by total value locked, launched on the Polygon network on Thursday.\n\nUsers can now bridge Lido\u2019s Wrapped Staked Ether (wstETH) onto the Polygon network. The popular DeFi protocols Kyber, Balancer, and Beefy Finance will offer liquidity incentives for wstETH markets on Polygon.\n\nLido said it chose to launch on Polygon due to the volume of its native DeFi activity, track record for security, and the presence of existing Lido partners on the network. Polygon is the fifth-largest smart contract network with a total value locked (TVL) of $1B, according to DeFi Llama.\n\nThe news marks Lido\u2019s third deployment on an Ethereum scaling solution, following its launch on Optimism and Arbitrum in October 2020. Lido is also live on the Solana, Moonbeam, Moonriver, and Terra Classic blockchains.\n\nLiquid Staking\n\nLido\u2019s Ethereum-based stETH token is a liquid staking derivative (LSD), meaning the token represents a share of staked Ether and accrues corresponding staking rewards. Wrapped stETH allows the token to easily be bridged between networks.\n\nUsers deposit ETH with Lido. Lido then divides the Ether among its 29 node operators, who stake the ETH on behalf of the protocol\u2019s users. Users are issued stETH tokens corresponding to the value of the Ether they stake. The stETH can then be utilized across the DeFi ecosystem.\n\nThe token then accrues staking rewards for its holder, who receive 90% of the staking rewards generated. The remaining 10% is evenly split between Lido\u2019s node operators and the Lido DAO.\n\nLido is the largest LSD provider, comprising 80% of the sector\u2019s market cap, according to CoinGecko. It is also the largest DeFi protocol, with $8.8B in TVL, according to The Defiant Terminal.\n\nThe native tokens of Lido and other liquid staking providers have outshone other crypto tokens as crypto markets rebounded this year.\n\nDeFi Alpha Premium Content DeFi Daily | Weekdays\n\nDeFi Alpha Letter | Weekly\n\nDefiant Podcast Transcript | Weekly\n\nInbox Dump | Saturday\n\nWeekly Recap | Sunday Looking for Alpha? Become a premium member of The Defiant and join our DeFi Alpha community. Start for free\n\nStaked ETH Withdrawals\n\nThe LSD sector is riding a wave of anticipation for Ethereum\u2019s imminent Shapella upgrades, which will activate staked Ether withdrawals for the first time. The fork\u2019s final testnet deployment is scheduled to launch on March 14.\n\nUsers have been able to stake their ETH since Ethereum\u2019s Proof of Stake Beacon Chain went live in December 2020. However, the inability of users to withdraw their assets spurred criticism from Ethereum detractors, who highlighted that many in the crypto community expected the function to activate last year.\n\nOver 16M Ether worth more than $26B is currently staked on the Beacon Chain.\n\nThe Shapella upgrades are expected to precipitate a boom in LSD volumes as the activation of withdrawals incentivizes arbitrageurs to step in and minimize the spread between LSD tokens and Ether.\n\nThe increasing integration of LSDs into DeFi protocols also offers opportunities for users to combine staking rewards with other sources of yield. However, some critics argue that the integration of LSDs into DeFi protocols poses a centralization risk to Ethereum\u2019s staking ecosystem."

        "title": "Ethereum layer-2 solutions may focus less on token incentives in the future - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Layer-2 networks continue to gain momentum as the Ethereum ecosystem advances. For example, data from analytics provider Token Terminal found that layer-2 scaling solution Polygon had 313,457 daily active users as of Jan. 17, 2023 \u2014 a 30% increase in activity since October 2022.\n\nMoreover, the Polygon ecosystem recently announced the launch of its beta version Zero-Knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine. As a result, Polygon\u2019s native token, Polygon (MATIC), maintains a bullish narrative.\n\nWhile notable, some believe layer-2 networks offering token incentive models may soon become obsolete. For instance, Jesse Pollak \u2014 head of protocols and Base core contributor at American crypto exchange Coinbase \u2014 told Cointelegraph at ETHDenver 2023 that there are currently no plans to associate a token with Base, the Ethereum layer-2 network recently launched by Coinbase. He said:\n\n\u201cWe think about tokens as a powerful incentive tool that can change user and developer behavior. At the same time, we have seen situations unfold over the last few years where tokens have been used as an incentive mechanism with a lack of product fit for the underlying chain. Tokens have also resulted in nefarious or risky situations in the past.\u201d\n\nAccording to Pollak, Base is a layer-2 solution that allows developers to easily build applications without requiring an incentive mechanism. \u201cOur product will stand on its own. It will be very easy for developers to use to build applications and distribute those to real human beings,\u201d he said.\n\nShifting focus from token models to user experience\n\nFocusing on ease of use and distribution are important points, as Pollak pointed out that many of today\u2019s decentralized applications have been used solely for trading cryptocurrencies. \u201cTrading is not enough to make cryptocurrency the future of the economy. At Base, we are making it easy for developers to build useful applications that people actually want to use,\u201d he added.\n\nPollak explained that Base is investing in core infrastructure, such as Ethereum Improvement Proposal 4844, which will make the network secure and low-cost compared with other layer-2 networks. \u201cIt costs about 10\u201315 cents to conduct transactions on layer-2s. We aim to bring that down,\u201d he mentioned.\n\nWhile Base launched its testnet in February, Pollak shared that the Base mainnet launch will take place in the coming months. Moreover, while no plans exist for Base to offer a native token, several ecosystem participants have already expressed interest in building on Base.\n\nRecent: Next stop Shanghai \u2014 Ethereum\u2019s latest milestone approaches\n\nFor example, Konstantin Richter, chief executive officer and founder of Blockdaemon \u2014 a blockchain infrastructure provider \u2014 told Cointelegraph at ETHDenver 2023 that Blockdaemon will serve as an official infrastructure partner for Base. Richter shared that he thinks Base shouldn\u2019t have a token associated with the network, as he believes proof-of-stake (PoS) is an entirely broken system. \u201cBlockdaemon runs more PoS nodes than anyone else, and I can tell you that proof-of-stake only works when token prices go up,\u201d he said.\n\nRichter further explained that Blockdaemon plans to use the Base network to determine how to allow network participants to run nodes while possibly earning a fixed U.S. dollar fee. \u201cThis may result in a different type of PoS mechanism, possibly around commitment of compute rather than a staked percentage of tokens that may not serve the network well,\u201d he said. Richter added that such a model could result in a better user experience. He said:\n\n\u201cThis could be the biggest paradigm shift within the cryptocurrency ecosystem since the invention of PoS. We are moving away from incentive models that reward users for using a product. We are now focused on ease of functionality and low fees.\u201d\n\nYet it remains questionable how exactly Base will attract users and developers to the platform without a token incentive model. Given Coinbase\u2019s vast understanding of institutions and decentralized finance (DeFi), Richter doesn\u2019t think this should be an issue: \u201cI prefer to work with Base given Coinbase\u2019s understanding of institutions and DeFi. It\u2019s remarkable that a public Fortune 500 company is committed to putting transactions transparently on Base.\u201d\n\nWhile it\u2019s too soon to predict future outcomes, it\u2019s important to note that Arbitrum, another Ethereum layer-2 network, also functions without a native token. This has certainly not stopped users from interacting with the Arbitrum network. According to data from the analytics website L2Beat.com, Arbitrum has about $3.35 billion total value locked, making up about 54% of the market share on Ethereum.\n\nHowever, rumors have been circulating that Arbitrum may initiate a token airdrop in the future. While this may or not be the case, it demonstrates Arbitrum\u2019s ability to determine product market fit before launching a token. Gil Rosen, president of the Stanford Blockchain Accelerator, told Cointelegraph at ETHDenver 2023 that finding product market fit is about ensuring projects acquire the right customers whose value is accretive to the ecosystem, which often isn\u2019t the case with tokens. \u201cEarly projects that launch tokens are often locked into tokenomics models before finding product market fit and then are unable to pivot dynamically,\u201d Rosen said.\n\n\u201cDeFi Dad,\u201d a partner at digital asset investment firm Fourth Revolution Capital, told Cointelegraph that he believes the main driver behind layer-2 tokens is to ensure decentralized control over layer-2 networks.\n\nFor example, he explained that the upcoming launch of zkSync\u2019s Zero-Knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine would use a PoS mechanism to allow zkSync tokenholders to act as stakers. \u201cLayer-2 tokens are necessary for building the decentralized future,\u201d he said.\n\nThanks to our community and the entire ecosystem for an energizing ETHDenver 2023. For the remainder of the week, we\u2019ll share highlights from ETHDenver around ZK scaling and building a future-proof zkEVM. First topic, hyperscalability.\n\n\n\n1/7 pic.twitter.com/qOVSQ475a2 \u2014 zkSync \u220e (@zksync) March 8, 2023\n\nDeFi Dad thinks a layer-2 network without plans to implement a native token could be successful if users are willing to sacrifice decentralization and censorship resistance in the short term.\n\nRecent: Banks with crypto services require new Anti-Money Laundering capabilities\n\nHe said, \u201cBase could be successful as a network for transacting with a user\u2019s crypto. However, make no mistake; Base will be a layer-2 (at least for the foreseeable future) that makes trade-offs. As DeFi users, we tend to deprioritize security and censorship resistance until we really need it.\u201d\n\nWith this point in mind, Rosen mentioned that he believes token models will remain for many decentralized projects with large developer and user communities, but these will launch later. \u201cA project may launch a token when the networks themselves are more mature and have found product market fit.\u201d"

Gil Rosen, president of the Stanford Blockchain Accelerator, told Cointelegraph at ETHDenver 2023 that finding product market fit is about ensuring projects acquire the right customers whose value is accretive to the ecosystem, which often isn\u2019t the case with tokens. \u201cEarly projects that launch tokens are often locked into tokenomics models before finding product market fit and then are unable to pivot dynamically,\u201d Rosen said.\n\n\u201cDeFi Dad,\u201d a partner at digital asset investment firm Fourth Revolution Capital, told Cointelegraph that he believes the main driver behind layer-2 tokens is to ensure decentralized control over layer-2 networks.\n\nFor example, he explained that the upcoming launch of zkSync\u2019s Zero-Knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine would use a PoS mechanism to allow zkSync tokenholders to act as stakers. \u201cLayer-2 tokens are necessary for building the decentralized future,\u201d he said.\n\nThanks to our community and the entire ecosystem for an energizing ETHDenver 2023. For the remainder of the week, we\u2019ll share highlights from ETHDenver around ZK scaling and building a future-proof zkEVM. First topic, hyperscalability.\n\n\n\n1/7 pic.twitter.com/qOVSQ475a2 \u2014 zkSync \u220e (@zksync) March 8, 2023\n\nDeFi Dad thinks a layer-2 network without plans to implement a native token could be successful if users are willing to sacrifice decentralization and censorship resistance in the short term.\n\nRecent: Banks with crypto services require new Anti-Money Laundering capabilities\n\nHe said, \u201cBase could be successful as a network for transacting with a user\u2019s crypto. However, make no mistake; Base will be a layer-2 (at least for the foreseeable future) that makes trade-offs. As DeFi users, we tend to deprioritize security and censorship resistance until we really need it.\u201d\n\nWith this point in mind, Rosen mentioned that he believes token models will remain for many decentralized projects with large developer and user communities, but these will launch later. \u201cA project may launch a token when the networks themselves are more mature and have found product market fit.\u201d"
