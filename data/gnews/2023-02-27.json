        "summary": "  Ethereum developers are planning to \"slowly die\" the Goerli testnet due to the soaring value of its native asset, GETH, which has become a problem as developers are no longer testing their apps on it due to the new costs. The plan is to phase out Goerli and move users to the Sepolia testnet, which is already running but not yet open for anyone to run a validator node. Alternatives, such as the Holli testnet, are being proposed to make it easier for developers to acquire testnet ETH and reduce the need for a secondary market."

        "summary": "  Ethereum (ETH) is poised for a breakout against Bitcoin (BTC), according to former ARK Invest crypto analyst Chris Burniske. After two years of consolidation, ETH is ready to make a monthly breakout, with the last time it had a significant price spike in May 2021. The current consolidation period is shorter than the previous one, indicating a potentially smaller price increase. The question remains whether Ethereum will reach a new all-time high against Bitcoin, with the current mark set at 0.1564 BTC per ETH, which is 123% higher than the current altcoin's price. The \"flippening\" of Ethereum overtaking Bitcoin in terms of capitalization is still 43% away."

The transition to PoS has reduced energy consumption by 99.95%. The number of validators in the network has grown, and assets staked have exceeded 15.85 million ETH. Ethereum is transitioning to a modular model, and decentralized applications are launching on layer 2 networks. Many blockchains are compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). The future of blockchain may resemble other operating systems, with one dominant ecosystem and one or two secondary ones. Ethereum has around 122.4 million coins in circulation, and a portion of coins are burned daily due to network fees. Major changes are expected in 2023, including the Shanghai hard fork and the implementation of EIP-4844. Deflation may occur due to the growth of Layer-2 solutions.

        "summary": "  Ethereum gas fees are increasing as the NFT market rebounds, with the median gas price rising to 38 gwei this month, higher than during key bear market events. Rising demand for gas is primarily driven by NFT transactions, which have seen a 97% increase in gas usage over the past two months. The recent surge in activity is led by Blur, an NFT marketplace that has overtaken OpenSea in trading volume. However, network adoption remains low, with new addresses being generated at 40% below the level of 12 months ago. The competition between OpenSea and Blur is also constricting cash available to many NFT projects that relied on secondary royalties for revenue."

Base is a fork of popular Ethereum L2 Optimism and processes batches of transactions on a separate chain, making transactions faster and cheaper than Ethereum. Base will be fully decentralized, but initially will not have a network token. Coinbase has partnered with several companies, including Chainlink, Etherscan, and Aave, to build and support the ecosystem. The success of Base will depend on how much of the network value add Coinbase is able to capture, and it is expected to be a top dog for big industries. This is part of Coinbase's effort to diversify its revenue model beyond trading volume, as the cyclical nature of cryptocurrency trading makes it difficult to predictably plan and grow."

This solution comes at a time when Solana has been under pressure following the collapse of FTX and Alameda Research, which hold millions worth of SOL, the native currency of Solana. Some projects have already migrated to Polygon in the past few weeks, including DeLabs, the creator of Y00ts, which received a $3 million grant to build on Polygon."
