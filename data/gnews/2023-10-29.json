        "content": "Share:\n\nEthereum price has seen a near-15% ascent in the last since October 22.\n\nDespite the recent rally, ETH needs to hold above the $1,727 and $1,650 barriers to move higher.\n\nA daily candlestick close below $1,650 will invalidate the bullish thesis.\n\nEthereum (ETH) price is in a good position after last week\u2019s rally. But things are not a given, as bulls need to defend a few key levels before they\u2019re in the clear. Investors need to watch the key barriers to know where ETH will head next.\n\nEthereum price at critical point\n\nEthereum (ETH) price has cleared the $1,650, $1,670 and $1,727 hurdles as it rallied 19% between October 19 and 25. This move created a local top at $1,865 and is contemplating its next move.\n\nGoing forward, investors can expect Ethereum price to retrace the aforementioned barriers and finda support. This move will allow the daily Relative Strength Index (RSI) to reset at the 50 mean level, further adding credence to the bullish thesis.\n\nA strong bounce could send Ethereum price to tag the $2,000 psychological level as well as the range high at $2,030. The last time ETH tried to overcome this hurdle in mid-April, it failed. So, a move into this zone will be critical for the long-term outlook of the smart contract token.\n\nClearing the $2,030 hurdle or flipping it into a support floor will open the path to the next key resistance level at $2,424.\n\nRead more: Ethereum\u2019s Dencun upgrade is a step toward a scalable settlement layer: Goldman Sachs\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nWhile the bullish outlook makes logical sense, it is dependent on Ethereum price holding above the $1,727 barrier. A daily candlestick close below this level that leads to a breakdown of the $1,650 support level will invalidate the bullish thesis.\n\nIn such a case, Ethereum price could revisit $1,551 or slide lower to collect the sell-side liquidity resting below swing lows formed on September 10 and October 10.\n\nAlso read: Top 3 Price Prediction Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple: Crypto markets turn bullish on ETF approval hopes"

Thus, the number of active addresses grew at a faster pace compared to Bitcoin [BTC], Ethereum [ETH], and Coinbase\u2019s L2 Base.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s ATOM\u2019s market cap in BTC\u2019s terms\n\nIt seemed necessary to compare Cosmos to Bitcoin and Ethereum because they are the top two blockchains, in a nutshell. For Base, since its introduction, it has amassed a lot of adoption.\n\nHowever, the hype and activity around Base has dropped significantly. In fact, Token Terminal showed that the project\u2019s Daily Active Users reduced by 12.5%.\n\nThe Daily Active Users can offer vital information about a network\u2019s health. Aside from being a metric that measures user adoption, the metric can indicate a shift in market sentiment. Sometimes, it also has a big impact on token prices.\n\nMore data transport, more growth\n\nSurprisingly, Cosmos\u2019 native token ATOM did not feel the impact of the active user growth. At press time, the ATOM\u2019s value was $7.02\u2014 a similar price it was 30 days back.\n\nOne of the factors that influenced the increase could be linked to the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol expansion to the Binance Smart Chain. The IBC is an open-source protocol developed to handle the movement of data between blockchains.\n\nBased on AMBCrypto\u2019s report a few weeks ago, the expansion would also offer more opportunities for those involved in staking ATOM. Besides that, Cosmos is also making movies to ensure that it lasts long in the list of blockchains with a good level of development activity.\n\nThe project seems to be using its builders\u2019 program to this effect.\n\nSentiment goes sideways\n\nInterestingly, Santiment\u2019s data showed that the efforts are paying off for Comsos, as indicated by the Development Activity metric. Development Activity shows the commitment of developers to ensure the proper functioning of a network.\n\nAt press time, Cosmos\u2019 development had jumped to 16.22. This means that there has been an increase in the number of features shipped via the project. Cosmos also experienced an up-and-down trend in terms of market awareness.\n\nTo measure perception, on-chain platform Santiment uses the Weighted Sentiment metric. This metric tracks the positive/commentary about a project via social media platforms.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ATOMs worth today?\n\nAn increase in Weighted Sentiment means a surge in positive comments. Conversely, a decrease means a growing negative perception.\n\nFrom the data above, Cosmos\u2019 Weighted Sentiment was 0.365. Looking at the chart, the comments about the project were largely positive as of press time. However, the optimism seemed to be waning."
