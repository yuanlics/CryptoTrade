The \"Where\" aspect of the news refers to the price action of ETH on various time frames, including the hourly chart. The article highlights the resistance levels for ETH at $2,300 and $2,400, and the support levels at $2,200 and $2,080.

This classification matters because securities and commodities ETFs face different legal requirements, with different taxes and regulatory burdens attached to securities.
