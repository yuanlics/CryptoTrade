        "summary": "  The Ethereum price has been recovering above the $2,200 level after a recent decline, but the upside potential may be limited. The cryptocurrency is facing resistance near $2,300 and a connecting bearish trend line is forming with resistance at this level. If Ethereum fails to clear this resistance, it could start a fresh decline towards $2,200 and potentially lower levels.\n\nOn the upside, a clear move above $2,300 could send the price towards $2,400 and then $2,440. However, the next key resistance is at $2,500, above which a drift towards $2,620 could occur.\n\nTechnical indicators such as the MACD and RSI are gaining momentum in the bullish zone, which could suggest that the uptrend may continue. However, the RSI is still below 50, indicating that the cryptocurrency may face selling pressure near the resistance levels.\n\nThe major support level is at $2,180, and the major resistance level is at $2,300.
