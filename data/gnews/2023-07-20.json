        "content": "A mysterious wallet address that has existed since Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) inception has just moved its entire ETH stash after lying low for about eight years.\n\nAccording to blockchain tracker Lookonchain, the Ethereum whale received 61,216 ETH on July 30th of 2015 after participating in the second-largest crypto asset\u2019s initial coin offering (ICO) the prior year.\n\nHours ago the whale transferred the entire ETH holdings to an address the blockchain tracker has identified as belonging to Kraken, a cryptocurrency exchange.\n\nThe blockchain tracker says that the whale received the ETH from Ethereum\u2019s Genesis contract at an approximate cost of $0.31, translating to a profit of approximately 616,029% in about eight years. The entire ETH holding, which is now worth around $116.9 million, cost the whale slightly less than $19,000 at the time of the ICO.\n\nEthereum is trading at $1,910 at time of writing.\n\nWhile the mysterious wallet now holds zero Ethereum, there are numerous other tokens that it owns.\n\nDuring Ethereum\u2019s ICO more than 50 million ETH were sold raising around $17.3 million at the time. Some of the proceeds went to the nonprofit Ethereum Foundation while a portion was allocated to the crypto asset\u2019s founding team.\n\nA similar transfer of Ethereum by a hitherto dormant whale of coins acquired during the crypto asset\u2019s early days occurred in April. Then, the whale moved 2,635 ETH at an equally eye-popping profit of 594,000%.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "title": "Bitcoin Miner Hive Is Using Old Ethereum Rigs and AI to Make Ordinals Art - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Canadian crypto miner HIVE Digital Technologies wants to use Ordinals in one of its AI initiatives, inscribing generative art on Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain with the help of old Ethereum mining rigs.\n\nHIVE CEO Aydin Kilic described the project as an exercise in technical prowess for one of crypto\u2019s largest miners. He told Decrypt that Ordinals provides a new way for the firm to use its fleet of data-center-grade Nvidia GPUs, which it\u2019s been using to mine altcoins after Ethereum switched to proof-of-stake during the \u201cmerge\u201d and made miners obsolete.\n\n\u201cWe will create generative AI art with our own GPUs, on our own fine-tuned model of Stable Diffusion, [...] and then use our hash power on the Bitcoin network to inscribe those on the Bitcoin blockchain,\u201d he said.\n\nWhat Is 'The Merge'? Ethereum\u2019s Move to Proof of Stake\n\nOrdinals launched earlier this year, and the buzzy Bitcoin protocol has led to a wave of innovation with crypto\u2019s oldest coin. As a way for people to create NFT-like assets on Bitcoin by \u201cinscribing\u201d data on individual satoshi, equal to 1/100,000,000 of a whole Bitcoin, Ordinals has also been a significant windfall for Bitcoin miners that benefit from elevated transaction fees.\n\nEven though Bitcoin transaction fees from Ordinals inscriptions have cooled over the past couple of months\u2014fervor surrounding BRC-20 tokens, which are built on top of Bitcoin using Ordinals, sent them sky high\u2014Kilic said HIVE is definitely \u201cstill leaning into them.\u201d\n\nKilic compared the initiative to jet fighter squadrons like the Blue Angels who show off their skills by flying in tight formations. He described HIVE\u2019s project as ambitious because it taps so many different segments of HIVE\u2019s business, including its cloud computing platforms and custom versions of AI models like Stable Diffusion.\n\nBitcoin Mining Revenue Hits $184 Million in Q2 Amid Ordinals Fervor\n\n\u201cWe want to do a soup-to-nuts AI and Ordinals project that\u2019s fully integrated,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a reflection of our core competencies as a technology leader in the AI and Bitcoin space.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nAside from creating a digital art pipeline, Kilic said HIVE is working with its custody providers to start transacting uncommon sats found through Ordinals. Uncommon sats, which are valued at a premium, are the first sat of each Bitcoin block. Kilic said HIVE has 272 of them. Sat is a common abbreviation for satoshi, the smallest denomination of Bitcoin that data is inscribed on.\n\nWhen Ethereum shifted to proof-of-stake last year, it changed the way that transactions are verified on the network and greatly reduced its energy consumption. With Bitcoin, miners use large amounts of energy to verify transactions through proof-of-work.\n\nEthereum Energy Usage, Carbon Footprint Down 99.99% After Merge: Report\n\nAfter Ethereum\u2019s transition to proof-of-stake, HIVE said it was exploring alternatives to Ethereum mining. Developing a generative art pipeline using new technologies fits into HIVE\u2019s overall corporate strategy of maximizing resources, Kilic said.\n\nHIVE went public in 2017 and trades on the TSX Venture Exchange in Canada under the HIVE.V symbol. It has also traded on the Nasdaq since 2021 under the HIVE symbol. Shares of HIVE currently change hands at $5.66, and the company has a market capitalization of around $477 million.\n\nEchoing comments made by MicroStrategy co-founder and executive chairman Michael Saylor, who said Ordinals holds potential in the realm of app development, Kilic said the protocol enables companies like HIVE to experiment with Bitcoin in previously unimagined ways.\n\n\u201cI think that it\u2019s unleashing a whole new era,\u201d Kilic said. \u201cWe're all super supportive of it.\u201d"
