The system uses zero-knowledge proofs to enable trustless and efficient interoperability between Ethereum and other blockchain networks. Experimental results show that zkBridge can generate Ethereum full-node proofs and verify block headers on other networks within 12 seconds. Polyhedra Network plans to optimize the implementation and add GPU acceleration in the near future."

Despite a positive sentiment in the crypto market, user counts and wallet addresses have plateaued on alternative layer-1 blockchains. Ethereum-based layer-2 solutions, such as Arbitrum and Optimism, are flourishing, with higher total value locked compared to competing chains. Van Bourg believes that the multichain thesis is dead and that Ethereum's dominance will continue. Avi Feldman, head of digital asset trading at GoldenTree, disagrees, arguing that incentive programs will draw value to competing protocols in the next bull cycle. However, Van Bourg questions the advantage of alternative layer-1 blockchains over Ethereum, suggesting that they lack practical use-cases."
