        "title": "What Is Wrapped Ethereum (WETH)? A Beginner's Guide - Unchained - Unchained",
        "content": "Wrapped Ethereum (ETH) enables ETH holders to wrap their tokens and use them in Ethereum\u2019s decentralized finance market in accordance with the ERC-20 token standard.\n\nThe Ethereum blockchain\u2019s native cryptocurrency, ether (ETH), follows different rules from those of the ERC-20 token standard. Wrapped Ethereum helps bridge this gap by offering a more versatile version of ETH.\n\nRead on as we discuss Wrapped Ethereum, how to wrap and unwrap ETH, and the various use cases.\n\nWhat Is Wrapped Ethereum (WETH)?\n\nWrapped Ethereum (WETH) is an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain pegged 1:1 to ETH.\n\nETH plays a critical role in the network by paying gas fees for transactions. However, with ERC-20 tokens following different rules, users cannot use their ETH in the same way as ERC-20 tokens.\n\nWETH\u2019s ERC-20 infrastructure opens this path, allowing compatibility across the blockchain and eliminating the need to develop new smart contracts.\n\nHow Does Wrapped Ethereum Work?\n\nETH preceded the development of the ERC-20 standard, and the lack of compatibility means customized programming for each dApp, which can be costly. With the wrapping technology, an ERC-20 wrapper envelopes the ETH. This eliminates the need for custom programming to ensure compatibility with ERC-20 contracts.\n\nHere\u2019s how you can wrap your ETH, turning it into WETH:\n\nSend the desired amount of ETH to a WETH smart contract.\n\nThe smart contract then returns equal WETH and locks your ETH.\n\nUse the WETH for investment purposes such as providing liquidity , lending, staking, NFT trading, and much more.\n\nWhen you want your ETH back, send the WETH to the smart contract, unlocking your ETH and sending it to your wallet.\n\nThe smart contract then automatically burns the WETH to ensure the 1:1 peg remains.\n\nInstead of exchanging the WETH for your ETH, you can also use a crypto exchange such as Uniswap or SushiSwap to swap it for another token or cryptocurrency.\n\nBenefits & Drawbacks for WETH\n\nWETH presents two key advantages:\n\nDeploy ETH in DeFi: ETH holders can deploy their holdings in decentralized protocols incompatible with ETH. Wrapped ETH presents an ERC-20 version of Ethereum that the holders can use to trade and lend in various DeFi protocols, for example.\n\nNo need to sell ETH: Investments are possible without losing access to ether holdings. Since investors can retrieve the ETH locked in the smart contract at any time, they don\u2019t have to sell their holdings for investment and trading purposes.\n\nThere are some risks associated with WETH:\n\nThe need to trust a third party : The protocol for wrapping Ethereum is not Turing-complete. That means automation via a smart contract on the blockchain is not possible. Centralized programs host the wrapping smart contracts, allowing certain parties to control the assets. This opens the door for potential manipulation and abuse of power.\n\nTarget for hackers : The centralized nature of the WETH smart contracts incentivizes bad actors to exploit any existing vulnerabilities since all the assets are in one place.\n\nWrapped Ethereum Use Cases\n\nThere are two key use cases for WETH:\n\nLiquidity Pools : On decentralized exchanges such as UniSwap, users can add their WETH to liquidity pools and earn fees. The fees come from other users who opt to swap their tokens.\n\nLending : Platforms such as AAVE offer collateralized crypto loans. You can lend your WETH to other users and earn interest. You can recall your assets at any time, provided the smart contract for the lending agreement allows it.\n\nWrapped Ethereum on Other Blockchains\n\nSo far, we have only mentioned the Ethereum blockchain, which may leave you wondering if you can wrap ETH on other blockchains. At its core, wrapping technology aims to achieve interoperability. Therefore, it is possible to wrap Ethereum outside the native blockchain.\n\nBlockchains such as Polygon, Avalanche, and BNB Chain contain different versions of wrapped ETH.\n\nBlockchain bridging services\n\ncan also enhance cross-chain interoperability. A smart contract stores the ETH on the native blockchain and then mints an equivalent amount on the destination blockchain. The bridging process has its risks, with the key being the vulnerability of the smart contracts. Ensure you have all the information about the bridging service you intend to use before risking your ETH.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nWrapped Ethereum provides a user-friendly way to bridge Ethereum\u2019s native token and the blockchain ERC-20 token standard, enabling ETH to be used in wrapped form across the entire dApp ecosystem on Ethereum."

        "title": "How to build a DApp on Ethereum - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The Ethereum DApps ecosystem is thriving, and the potential for decentralized applications (DApps) is immense. Who wouldn\u2019t want to participate?\n\nDevelopers can now build applications with their own native coins or nonfungible tokens (NFTs) on secure blockchain networks to serve any purpose \u2014 from financial and industrial use cases to social media sites and, of course, for gaming.\n\nLet\u2019s look at some questions developers might have and how they can get started on an Ethereum DApp project.\n\nWhat are DApps?\n\nDApps are blockchain-based versions of the applications and software we use daily. They are powered with smart contract technology and built on smart contract-enabled blockchains like Ethereum.\n\nThe main benefits of DApps are that they can run on decentralized blockchains controlled by technology or community methods of governance rather than single corporate entities. With blockchain networks, DApp data doesn\u2019t live in a single place, so there\u2019s higher network security. DApps use cryptocurrencies, which makes allocating and transferring value, or making payments, far easier and less costly than fiat currency transactions.\n\nCan you build DApps on Ethereum without experience?\n\nFor those who are already software or web developers, Ethereum DApp development might come naturally with an understanding of blockchain technology, smart contracts, Solidity programming language and cryptocurrencies.\n\nThere are also platforms in development that will allow developers to build DApps with less blockchain, programming and smart contract knowledge, but it\u2019s helpful to have some development experience.\n\nWhich blockchain is best to create a DApp?\n\nEthereum\u2019s longevity in the crypto space and its popularity often make it the preferred blockchain for DApp building. The network is still innovating; it is tried and tested and has an established ecosystem for DApp development. However, one may consider the transaction or Ethereum gas fees a crucial factor to weigh against other networks before embarking on any development initiatives.\n\nOther smart contract blockchain networks include Solana, Polkadot, BNB Smart Chain, Eos, Tron and Cardano; each has its strengths and weaknesses compared to Ethereum.\n\nThe network chosen may have implications for the interoperability, scalability, security and cost of the DApp development, as well as dictate the community of DApp users that can be reached when launched.\n\nTo decide which blockchain is best to create a DApp, developers can begin by analyzing a DApp\u2019s requirements and goals, as well as looking at the development expertise within the existing team or the team hired.\n\nHow many DApps run on Ethereum?\n\nOver 3,000 DApps are running on Ethereum, with more in development. DappRadar is a popular site to check out the DApps on Ethereum and its competitor networks, as well as how many users each DApp has and how many transactions are processed.\n\nWhy build a DApp on Ethereum?\n\nThere are a number of smart contract blockchains to consider for those planning to build a DApp, but Ethereum is arguably the most popular and has the highest decentralized security.\n\nEthereum was the first smart contract blockchain, and it has a large developer community and repositories of open-source code available for new developers. It\u2019s also a common choice for business developers looking to develop their own enterprise-level blockchain initiatives.\n\nWhat are Ethereum DApps examples?\n\nThere are hundreds of popular Ethereum DApps and many more that are just building their user bases; here are a few established and well-used examples:\n\nUniswap\n\nOne of the most-used Ethereum DApps is the decentralized exchange (DEX) Uniswap, which has now seen over $1 trillion traded on the platform.\n\nOpenSea\n\nThe OpenSea platform is one of the largest NFT marketplaces, with over 2 million NFT collections and 80 million individual NFTs for sale.\n\nMetaMask\n\nBoth a cryptocurrency wallet and a gateway, or browser, for accessing blockchain-based applications, MetaMask is known as a user-friendly crypto tool.\n\nAxie Infinity\n\nThis NFT-based game is a great example of an in-play virtual economy in action, and it\u2019s one of the most popular DApp games.\n\nHow to build an Ethereum DApp\n\nAspiring developers can begin an Ethereum DApp development by considering what a DApp needs and its purpose. Then, the next step is to start researching Ethereum DApp development tools and processes.\n\nDApp and smart contract development can be complex, and it\u2019s certainly different from conventional web or software development. A sensible place to begin in-depth research is Ethereum\u2019s Developer Resources, which is \u201ca builders manual for Ethereum.\u201d As a decentralized application tutorial, it\u2019s one of the most comprehensive.\n\nFive elements to consider while building an Ethereum DApp\n\nAn Ethereum DApp development project will need to be planned in detail, just like any business or project. To map out how to build a DApp on Ethereum, here are a few more components to research first:\n\n1. Development environment, tools and smart contracts\n\nOnce a development team is finalized, a DApp will need a development environment, usually a blockchain-based testnet, where Ethereum DApp architecture can be built and tested using applicable development tools. Smart contracts also have to be expertly designed and written.\n\n2. Security\n\nBlockchain networks can be more secure for financial transactions than traditional systems, but it\u2019s not feasible to skimp on Ethereum DApp security. Cryptographic security is complex, and it needs to be understood well or expert-driven, remembering that blockchain networks and cryptocurrencies are frequently targeted by hackers and scammers.\n\n3. Front-end development and user experience\n\nFront-end DApp development usually happens after the DApp architecture and smart contract build. A front-end web or Web3 application might use more conventional development tools, but the user experience will need to be designed in detail, too, to ensure a project\u2019s success.\n\n4. Ethereum DApp testing and debugging\n\nDevelopers planning to build on Ethereum benefit from blockchain technology that has been used and tested, as well as open-source code repositories to help with new projects. However, developers must also test and debug new DApp builds, smart contracts and UI/UX, as there\u2019s nothing worse than launching software that doesn\u2019t work!\n\n5. DApp deployment\n\nAn Ethereum DApp deployment will be the last element of a project and probably the most exciting. Once testing and debugging is complete, a DApp is taken out of its testnet and deployed to the Ethereum mainnet, where it can be used by customers. At this stage, a project\u2019s sales and marketing will begin in earnest.\n\nHow much does it cost to build a DApp on Ethereum?\n\nDevelopers with experience who build their own DApps using the Ethereum development tools available may experience lower build costs. For developers or entrepreneurs looking to hire a DApp developer or an Ethereum DApp development team, estimates can run from $15,000 and upward for a simple DApp to $30,000 and upward for a more complex DApp or to hire a more experienced developer.\n\nChallenges associated with DApp development on the Ethereum blockchain\n\nBuilding a DApp on Ethereum or any other blockchain will be without its challenges. Here are a few that might need to be anticipated:\n\nMarket saturation\n\nThere are already over 3,000 DApps built on Ethereum, so any new DApp development must compete, at least within the Ethereum community, for attention.\n\nScalability, speed, security, interoperability and decentralization\n\nEvery smart contract blockchain is still working on sufficiently answering blockchain\u2019s promises and the inherent challenge of delivering the ability of projects to scale for mainstream use and become interoperable with other projects and technologies while retaining security and decentralization.\n\nTransaction or gas fees and crypto price volatility\n\nEvery transaction within a DApp generates transaction fees \u2014 in Ethereum\u2019s case, gas fees \u2014 which are usually passed on to DApp users. Crypto coins or tokens associated with DApps will also experience the price volatility felt by the broader market.\n\nAvailability of expertise/smart contract complexity\n\nBlockchain development is still a very new profession, so there\u2019s a real shortage of seasoned experts, and smart contracts still have their technological limitations for developers to navigate.\n\nLack of sector regulation\n\nAs crypto coins and tokens, including those used in DApps, have yet to be comprehensively regulated, there\u2019s much uncertainty when developing these digital currencies.\n\nUser experience\n\nOutside of the crypto community, DApp functionalities can be difficult for consumers used to conventional apps to get to grips with, and many consumers are still unsure about using cryptocurrencies."

        "title": "To enshrine or not to enshrine? Ethereum's existential debate continues - Blockworks",
        "content": "Enshrinement is an often contested topic in \u201cEthereum land\u201d that seems to be trending again, Blockworks co-founder Michael Ippolito says.\n\nThe argument over enshrinement centers on whether more elements should be baked in or pushed out toward the edges of the Ethereum network protocol, he explains. Ippolito notes that the many attempts to enshrine account abstraction \u201cdemonstrate how difficult it is actually to enshrine things in the protocol, even if you can decide as a community that this makes sense.\u201d\n\nOn the Bell Curve podcast (Spotify/Apple), Myles O\u2019Neil, an associate at the advisory and investment firm Reverie, illustrates the enshrinement dilemma with an analogy. Comparing a blockchain to how a government should treat its country, O\u2019Neil says one could argue that \u201cit\u2019s not great to let everything go to the private market. There are certain services that lead to natural monopolies.\u201d\n\nIf private companies entirely capture elements such as utilities, \u201cthat would not be healthy for the underlying ecosystem,\u201d O\u2019Neil says as an example. The idea applies to Ethereum in the sense that certain utilities should be \u201cregulated\u201d or \u201cnationalized\u201d for the \u201cgreater health of the ecosystem,\u201d he says.\n\nRead more: Account abstraction: Finding a balance between on- and off-chain activity\n\nSounds like communism!\n\nThe pushback O\u2019Neil hears is \u201cthat sounds like communism to me!\u201d Such a controlled arrangement may not be healthy for attracting future entrepreneurs and innovators, he says.\n\nAnother way to imagine the situation is to think of Ethereum like an operating system, O\u2019Neil says. Operating systems built by Apple and Microsoft bundle many first-party applications into their systems, O\u2019Neil says, citing examples such as browsers, email clients, calendars and messaging services.\n\nThe first-party apps serve to protect consumers in some ways, he says, \u201cbecause relinquishing this control to the private market could lead to worse user experiences,\u201d but, he adds, \u201cit also is effective in deterring competition.\u201d\n\nEnshrining is, in a sense, building \u201cfirst-party apps\u201d that make the rest of the ecosystem better, O\u2019Neil says. But it\u2019s important, he says, to leave \u201cample room for third parties to come and innovate and build and drive value.\u201d\n\nWinners are emerging\n\nWhether imagining Ethereum as a government or an operating system, O\u2019Neil says the \u201cbig question\u201d is \u201ccan we retain this value of credible neutrality that attracts entrepreneurs and reduces platform risk?\u201d\n\n\u201cWinners have started to emerge,\u201d O\u2019Neil says, which may not be healthy for the rest of the ecosystem. \u201cWhether that is Lido today or Eigenlayer tomorrow,\u201d O\u2019Neil wonders if mechanisms operating \u201csuper close to the metal\u201d should be more directly controlled by the chain.\n\nRead more: EigenLayer\u2019s endgame: \u2018Dissolve into Ethereum itself\u2019\n\n\u201cAnd if we do that, does that actually deter future entrepreneurs from coming and building third-party apps?\u201d he asks.\n\nThe uniting principle should be \u201cgood user experience,\u201d Ippolito says, whether from the perspective of a citizen\u2019s access to a healthy banking and utilities system, or a user\u2019s interactions with a good operating system.\n\nIf the basic utilities in an operating system work well, Ippolito says, \u201cthen it\u2019s going to lead to all of these other profitable activities.\u201d\n\n\u201cSame thing with a country,\u201d he continues. Countries provide \u201cpublic goods\u201d such as roads via taxation and enforce regulation to protect against monopolistic behavior, he says.\n\n\u201cThe middle ground here is some form of regulation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe governance should fit how close you are to the metal,\u201d Ippolito says. At the base, Ethereum is decentralized, with staking services like Lido operating just \u201cone level up.\u201d Therefore, the service should be \u201calmost as flat and decentralized as Ethereum itself,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cThe crux of it is,\u201d Ippolito asks, \u201cwhat is so close to the metal that it actually should just be directly controlled by Ethereum?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd that is what I have less of a solid answer for.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "Six Important Considerations for the Ethereum Price Going in Q4 2023 - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "Ethereum is the longstanding second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Its market cap is in the $180 billion as we head into the second half of October 2023. (Meanwhile, Bitcoin\u2019s market cap is around $530 billion).\n\nEther price has been stuck in the doldrums since March. Sliding to the $1,550 handle last week, ETH is now on par with its March exchange rate to the US dollar.\n\nEther Up +30% Over Jan, But Down -25% Since Apr\n\nAfter a steep but short-lived rally in the first half of April, achieving a YTD high price of $2,120, Ether is now trading at a 7-month low price with two weeks left until November.\n\nAs a result of Ethereum launching out of 2022 with a hot bull run to thaw out the crypto winter frost this January, ETH is up 30% YTD. It started the year off trading at $1,200.\n\nBut on the 6-month chart, Ether\u2019s price is down 25%, with a 4.72% decline in the last 30 days. Investors are keen to know the next moves on major crypto exchanges.\n\nHere are 6 key factors to consider for the near, medium, and long term:\n\n1. Low Fees Driving Ether Inflation (Mixed)\n\nThe rapid development of the Ethereum platform has made it theoretically better than ever. The Merge and a number of Layer-2 scalability chains have made the platform faster and cheaper than ever.\n\nBut lower fees are a mixed bag.\n\nLower gas fees could attract more users and developers to Ethereum. But they are driving Ether inflation by burning fewer tokens than new ETH issuance by stakers.\n\nIn the trailing 30 days, Ether supply has grown by 33,500 ETH (worth $52 million). That is an inflationary headwind for Ether\u2019s price and a far cry from the initially deflationary effects of the merge.\n\n2. Ether Price Looks Good on 1YR, 5YR Charts (Bullish)\n\nThere\u2019s little doubt that Ethereum is here to stay as the world\u2019s leading decentralized computer. Its merge was almost too successful too soon in up-scaling the blockchain\u2019s throughput capacity.\n\nWhile before there was not enough pipe for all the oil, there\u2019s now less oil than a pipe. But the network is ready to take on massive growth when the timing is right.\n\nMeanwhile, on the 1-year chart, Ether price is down to a seven-month low. There\u2019s no telling for sure when it\u2019ll reach the bottom, but in its entire history, we\u2019re near the average length of peak-to-bottom.\n\nEther looks even cheaper on the 5-year chart, with Ether down 76% from its all-time high of $4,600 in Nov 2021. Furthermore, ETH on crypto exchanges is at its lowest level since 2018, according to Santiment data.\n\nThat\u2019s bullish for Ether because such moves \u201creduce selling pressure and show investors\u2019 long-term convictions.\u201d Bag holders are apparently confident in the value of Ethereum\u2019s long-range macro-thesis.\n\n3. ETH Staking Demand Has Crashed Since June (Bearish)\n\nIn June, the validator queue to stake Ether had 96,600 in line to stake as validator nodes for blockchain rewards. By October, that number had fallen to a mere 223. That\u2019s according to Validator Queue with data from Beacon Chain Ethereum Explorer.\n\nThe average wait time to stake ETH has fallen from 45 days to an hour and fifty minutes. This isn\u2019t all bad for the price. One of the reasons for falling staking demand is the rise of liquid staking options like Lido.\n\nHowever, Lido and other liquid staking services create additional risks for Ethereum.\n\nA misconfiguration earlier this month caused 20 Lido validators to get slashed from the network. The failure incurred $30,000 worth of ETH penalties for Lido to withdraw its staked Ether.\n\nFurthermore, staking services are creating a larger target area for SEC action under an aggressive SEC regime. So, the staking outlook for Ethereum is currently leaning bearish.\n\n4. Ether Price and Institutional Demand (Bullish)\n\nStaking demand on Ethereum probably won\u2019t stay low forever, though.\n\nWhile they are slow to move on cryptocurrencies, institutional investors are growing increasingly interested in on-chain BTC and spot ETF Bitcoin. They\u2019re also interested in staking Ether.\n\nInstitutional Tradfi investors like that Ether is more energy efficient and eco-friendly than Bitcoin with staked validators instead of proof-of-work post-merge. That\u2019ll be great for Ethereum when Wall Street finally makes big moves in crypto:\n\n\u201cEarlier this year, BlackRock\u2019s legendary chief executive Larry Fink, who shocked the world when he announced a surprise crypto flip, said he expects bitcoin and crypto to \u2018transcend\u2019 traditional currencies, including the U.S. dollar, thanks to Wall Street adoption.\u201d\n\nOne Tradfi institution, British bank Standard Chartered, is so bullish over these prospects that it recently projected Ether to grow in market value to $8,000 per 1 ETH by the end of 2026.\n\n5. Regulatory Threats (Bearish)\n\nHowever, don\u2019t expect a bevy of institutions to jump into staking Ether by the end of next week. It will still be some time before traditional financial institutions and hedge funds feel ready to make a move.\n\nA big part of that is regulatory ambiguity driven by an overreaching SEC and a scrum of policymakers taking their time to understand and legislate policy for blockchain in the United States.\n\nTraditional investing institutions, meanwhile, are loathe to make any big moves without being sure they won\u2019t endanger their relationship with the immensely powerful Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\n6. Ether price supply and demand economics (Bullish)\n\nAlong with its older cousin, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other major cryptos have an astonishing multi-year track record of high-ROI bull runs based on monetary policy and supply and demand.\n\nWhile the Federal Reserve is committed to taming inflation, it may not be able to avoid a policy of monetary expansion to keep the economy from getting sluggish.\n\nThe US central bank certainly seems poised to enter an interest rate pause in 2024, if not a more dovish regime. That has always buoyed Bitcoin and Ether with macro tailwinds.\n\nFurthermore, Bitcoin\u2019s halving cycle is about to reach another quadrennial cut in new supply this April. That has, in every cycle so far, been a major factor in precipitating bull runs on Bitcoin and Ethereum, as profits spill over into the rest of the ecosystem seeking more ROI, and altcoins ride BTC\u2019s coattails.\n\nThe previously mentioned 5-year low ETH levels on crypto exchanges are worth mentioning again in any current discussion about the supply and demand economics underlying Ether price."

        "content": "A closely followed crypto analyst says that traders may be underestimating Solana\u2019s (SOL) potential in the next bull market.\n\nIn a new strategy session, the host of InvestAnswers says that his base-case thesis for SOL is that it should reach 10% of Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) market cap during the next market expansion.\n\nUnder the presumption that Ethereum tops out at $8,000 in the next bull market, the analyst theorizes that if Solana were to reach 10% of ETH\u2019s market cap, which it already hit in the past, it would imply a $231 price target for SOL.\n\nHowever, InvestAnswers says that SOL reaching 20% of ETH\u2019s market cap isn\u2019t completely out of the realm of possibility.\n\n\u201cIf \u2013 which has always been part of my thesis \u2013 if Solana goes to 20% of the ETH market cap, that would take us to a $192 billion [market cap], and, given today\u2019s prices and the number of tokens, that would take the price to $461, and that would be an ROI (return on investment) of 2,038%, and that would only be 5%, approximately of the crypto market cap. So, it\u2019s not beyond the realm of possibilities at all.\n\nBut what\u2019s even more strange is we got above the 10% threshold already in the past.\n\nThis is the SOL upside chart\u2026 You can see here the yellow line is the 10% of ETH market cap, and the Solana price in blue breached that back in October 2021.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, SOL is trading for $21.99.\n\nI\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Ethereum price managed to recover from the $1,520 level against the US dollar. ETH is now facing hurdles near the $1,565 and $1,600 resistance levels.\n\nEthereum is attempting a recovery wave above the $1,550 level.\n\nThe price is trading just above $1,550 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere was a break above a major bearish trend line with resistance near $1,555 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair could start another decline unless there is a clear move above $1,565 and $1,600.\n\nEthereum Price Starts Minor Recovery\n\nEthereum managed to stay above the $1,500 and $1,520 levels. ETH formed a short-term support base and recently started a fresh increase from the $1,520 zone, like Bitcoin.\n\nThere was a move above the $1,550 resistance level. The price climbed above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the main drop from the $1,664 swing high to the $1,521 low. Besides, there was a break above a major bearish trend line with resistance near $1,555 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.\n\nEthereum is now trading just above $1,550 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. However, the bears seem to be preventing an upside break above the $1,565 resistance.\n\nIf there is a clear move above the $1,565 resistance, Ether could rise toward the next major hurdle at $1,600. It is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the main drop from the $1,664 swing high to the $1,521 low. A close above the $1,600 resistance might start a decent increase.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nIn the stated case, Ether could rise and recover toward the $1,665 resistance. Any more gains might open the doors for a move toward $1,750.\n\nAnother Decline in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $1,565 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,550 level and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThe next key support is $1,520. A downside break below the $1,520 support might send the price further lower. In the stated case, the price could drop toward the $1,440 level. Any more losses may perhaps send Ether toward the $1,420 level.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bullish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now above the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $1,550\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $1,565\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "Payments shouldn't be handled on the Ethereum and Bitcoin networks | Opinion - crypto.news",
        "content": "Disclosure: The views and opinions expressed here belong solely to the author and do not represent the views and opinions of crypto.news\u2019 editorial.\n\nCrypto companies are currently making payments entirely wrong because they are not accounting for the most important people: the end consumers. Earlier this year, it was reported that cryptocurrency investors were facing delays concerning withdrawing funds deposited on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nThis was following its significant software upgrade, and it created persistent headaches for Ethereum, a platform, which aims to have its technology widely used for instant transactions. This resulted in ether worth around $1.4 billion being stuck in a withdrawal queue. The delays were a prime example of the limits in the transactions that Ethereum could process.\n\nYou might also like: Investing in crypto: guide to smarter portfolio rebalancing\n\nThis highlighted its potential shortcomings in terms of becoming a widely-used financial infrastructure. While Ethereum has grown popular within the crypto market, it has yet to be used in mainstream payments, commerce, and finance. Despite these challenges and issues, Ethereum holds a superior position, and users continue to stand by it.\n\nThe reason for this is that it is fairly decentralized, which is key for preventing a chain from being hijacked by those validating it and for network security. It is the most decentralized smart contract blockchain within the crypto world. Ethereum offers a low barrier to entry in that anyone with the ability to set up a miner can validate transactions on the network with its proof-of-work (PoW) consensus model.\n\nThis model also requires computational input to approve the transactions, which dislocates control from the network to control over supply. Bitcoin, on the other hand, has gained acceptance as a payment method for businesses across the globe. However, the volatility of it remains a barrier for others embracing payments on Bitcoin networks.\n\nHandling payments on Bitcoin networks may offer some advantages, like the potential for increased profits. However, its value drop can cause serious losses for users, occasionally exceeding the profit from the transaction. The volatility of Bitcoin\u2019s value and the anonymity increase the risk of fraud. When transactions are verified within the Bitcoin network, each node within the decentralized system has to verify every transaction.\n\nAdditionally, the network can only process a specific number of transactions within a certain timeframe, such as a block. International payments through stablecoins on blockchain networks could provide an improved experience over traditional fiat transactions because they offer increased speed.\n\nUser experience and crypto wold\n\nIn saying that, the overall UX for crypto transactions still lacks integration with existing systems and accessibility. We are far away from having consumer-ready crypto products regular people can use effectively. The UX is obscene, and the steps to make crypto payments are exponentially more than fiat ones.\n\nUX\u2019s problems range from underlying flaws in the architecture to problems with business models and basic UI design issues. UIs are horrible, UX is obscene, and the steps to make crypto payments are exponentially more than fiat ones. Poor UX is everywhere in the crypto world, and the consequences of this are users losing significant amounts of money, but also woefully insufficient levels of security, and sub-optimal user adoption.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges facing transactions on these networks is their limited transaction processing capabilities. This leads to high fees and slow transaction times, which can certainly be barriers to wider adoption. Automatic payments are not really what\u2019s important here. What is important is understanding all the minor things that make up for an excellent experience and seamless payments.\n\nWithout this, crypto payments will not have a future at all. Bitcoin has experimented with some scaling up, such as the Lightning Network, a layer-2 solution built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. Its primary goal is to address Bitcoin\u2019s scalability issues, allowing for cheaper and faster transactions by enabling off-chain transactions via a network of payment channels.\n\nThe mainstream adoption?\n\nThe Lightning Network was launched in 2018 and hit a total value of $140 million. This network is growing, although there are still challenges that hinder its mainstream adoption. Therefore, it is uncertain whether it is the right solution for improving payments on Bitcoin networks. It is, after all, still an experimental technology. Despite the challenges facing Bitcoin as a payment method, it continues to be embraced as a viable alternative to traditional payment methods.\n\nThis only further reinforces the need for users to take an informative yet cautious approach. The future of payments on these networks will depend on their ability to address the current challenges of transaction processing, fraud, volatility, and the user experience whilst still ensuring advantages such as the potential for profit and anonymity.\n\nWhen it comes to Ethereum, the ecosystem is growing due to the surging popularity of its dApps in areas like gaming, finance, and technology. However, although it may seem like a perfect platform to the naked eye, it has considerable issues that must be addressed. These issues surround accessibility and scalability.\n\nAddressing these problems will ensure widespread adoption, but there is no doubt that this network is faced with many challenges. As time goes on, if these issues are not solved, it is difficult to predict whether Ethereum will be able to compete with its competitors. Investing in Ethereum comes with some disadvantages. Scalability is a problem, but there are also issues with its code and its supply.\n\nUltimately, Ethereum often has long transaction times and high gas fees. While Bitcoin is a decentralized currency, and this is generally a benefit, it can also be viewed as a disadvantage since it means Bitcoin is not regulated. It is not like with traditional currencies where they are regulated by central banks.\n\nThese kinds of transactions do not arrive with any legal protection and are irreversible. Due to its decentralized nature, there is also no guarantee of a minimum valuation. If investors decide to stop using them and sell them, their value can decrease significantly and impact users with a vast amount of cryptocurrency.\n\nTo support the worldwide adoption of cryptocurrencies for everyday transactions, we desperately need a network that demonstrates its capabilities to handle a certain amount of transactions without delays or processing issues. The network must also offer credibility that it can handle the growing amount of transactions in the future. In essence, these networks must be scaled up. The transaction capabilities of networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum are still quite low, and the demand to carry out these transactions will only grow.\n\nDaniele Servadei Daniele Servadei is a 20-year-old Italian entrepreneur on a mission to transform online payments and ecommerce.

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) value has experienced another decline this week, dropping to $1,557. This represents a 5% decline over the course of a week that has generally seen negative trends in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nETH last 7 days performance. Source: Finbold.com\n\nThe loss of momentum extends further, as Ethereum\u2019s price has fallen by 8% in the last two weeks and 2% over the past 30 days. However, it\u2019s important to note that despite recent setbacks, the market\u2019s top altcoin has still managed to maintain a year-to-date increase of 29.6%.\n\nEthereum\u2019s situation remains somewhat mixed, but recent overselling may position the asset for a potential rebound in the coming weeks, particularly when considering the fundamental strength of the Ethereum network, and the potential inflow of investors.\n\nIs the bearish trend set to continue?\n\nEthereum\u2019s price has been on a downward trajectory for a couple of months, showing significant weakness in its indicators since mid-August, coinciding with a broader market downturn.\n\nThe relative strength index (RSI) for ETH, represented by the purple line, has dropped from nearly 70 at the beginning of the month to 35 today. Although there has been a slight uptick in the past few hours, it remains weak, indicating that the token is currently oversold.\n\nA similar situation can be observed with ETH\u2019s 30-day exponential moving average (EMA) in yellow, which continues to slide further below its 200-day average (blue). This emphasizes the presence of substantial selling pressure.\n\nOne of the most discouraging signals at present is the decline in the token\u2019s support level, denoted by the green line, over the past few days. This suggests that ETH may struggle to resist further declines in the coming days.\n\nETH last 2 months performance. Source: TradingView\n\nHowever, despite the potential for minor drops in the very near future, the fact that ETH has been heavily sold recently makes it likely that traders will eventually seize the opportunity to purchase the token at an attractive discount.\n\nIn fact, ETH is currently undervalued relative to its underlying fundamentals, making it a favorable time to invest in the cryptocurrency, which is expected to make a full recovery, particularly given its dominant position in the crypto ecosystem.\n\nEthereum maintains a significant share of the Total Value Locked (TVL) in the industry, with its network and major layer-twos like Optimism (OP), Polygon (Matic), Arbitrum (ARB), and Base accounting for approximately 63% of the sector\u2019s total TVL.\n\nEthereum also continues to evolve and expand, as evidenced by the upcoming launch of the Holesky testnet, a development that will contribute to Ethereum\u2019s progress toward the eventual implementation of Proto-Danksharding, which promises significant improvements in scalability.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

An astonishing 4,600 y00ts holders migrated their assets from Polygon to Ethereum within the first seven hours of being feasible via http://bridge.y00ts.com.\n\n4600 y00ts have already migrated in the first 7 hours. y00ts show up. pic.twitter.com/nLhjDD4Iej \u2014 Frank (@frankdegods) October 16, 2023\n\nIncentivizing Early Adopters to Evolve\n\nOnboarding y00ts collectors to quickly switch from Polygon to Ethereum, the NFT project is generously covering all gas fees for first movers within the first 24 hours of viability.\n\nFurther incentivizing early adoption, 10 y00ts NFTs will randomly be distributed to wallets that switch chains within the first day. Notably, such assets have a floor price of approximately $1225 (0.775 ETH), as per OpenSea.\n\nAdditionally \u2014 boosting y00ts holders to act promptly in the next week \u2014 the NFT project is imposing a royalty fee of 33.3% starting October 22.\n\nTech Boosts and Imminent Upgrades\n\ny00ts partnered with Wormhole Crypto\u2019s cross-chain NFT standard to ease this transition, offering a safe and effective process for holders. Moreover, users can access all verified y00ts links with ease through Phantom shortcuts, including the popular bridge link.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s important to note that Ethereum validation can take up to an hour before minting, with a 30 y00ts migration limit per user. The waiting room advises users to \u201cjust chill\u201d, stating the \u201cy00ts are in transit. You can leave this page and come back later.\u201d In comparison, minting on Polygon is much swifter, validating such transactions within just seconds. System enhancements regarding this setback are in the works.\n\nAnother critical differentiation to be aware of is that y00tpoints will operate exclusively on the Ethereum network. Staking y00ts on ETH is not necessary; just holding them in a wallet is sufficient enough.\n\ny00ts\u2019 dedication to becoming the leading cross-chain NFT community is becoming a reality, with the goal of scaling up through Bitcoin after the Polygon and Ethereum transfer fulfillment. The overarching target of y00ts\u2019 creators, Dust Labs, is to cultivate a diverse and thriving NFT ecosystem \u2014 one of which is readily available across a multitude of blockchain networks.\n\nWant more?

        "content": "On-chain data shows that FTX liquidators staked much of their Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) holdings over the weekend.\n\n$30M in Ethereum staked.\n\nPer Etherscan data, the bankrupt crypto exchange staked around $30 million worth of ETH, approximately more than 24,000 ETH, on Oct. 14.\n\nProminent blockchain analytical firm 0xScope confirmed that the exchange was staking its assets. It noted that a wallet associated with the FTX liquidators staked 4416 ETH valued at around $6.85 million via Figment, an institutional-focused staking service provider.\n\nStaking is a process that involves committing crypto assets to support a blockchain network for a set period to earn rewards. According to Figment\u2019s website, its average Staking Rewards Rate (SRR) throughout the third quarter was 4.5%.\n\nMeanwhile, the Ethereum website pegs the reward rate at 3.4% annually.\n\nOver $120M staked in Solana.\n\nLiquidators of the bankrupt firm also staked 5.5 million Solana tokens, valued at around $121 million, via Figment.\n\nThis move would allow FTX to earn a rewards rate of nearly 7%, according to Figment\u2019s website.\n\nFTX was one of the major investors in the Solana blockchain, with court filings revealing that the exchange held more than $1 billion worth of SOL tokens. The exchange also had substantial holdings in other digital assets like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum, etc.\n\nIn September, FTX sought court approval to allow it to liquidate up to $100 million worth of digital assets weekly, with the ability to increase the limit to $200 million temporarily.\n\nMeanwhile, this move comes amid the ongoing criminal trial of the founder of the defunct exchange, Sam Bankman-Fried, in a New York court.\n\nThe trial has unveiled SBF\u2019s alleged involvement in mishandling FTX customers\u2019 funds. Key insiders, including Gary Wang, co-founder of FTX, and Caroline Ellison, former CEO of Alameda, testified that Alameda enjoyed special privileges at the now-defunct exchange, with SBF allegedly responsible for establishing systems that enabled fraudulent activities."

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nThe recent behavior of Ethereum (ETH) on the market and its deflation have gathered the attention of many crypto traders and investors. Since December 2022, the supply of Ether has been on an upward trajectory. Several factors have contributed to this inflationary trend in Ethereum. Notably, the decreased transaction fees, paired with an increased daily issuance, have accelerated the rise in ETH's supply.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe provided graphical representation highlights Ethereum's deflationary trend, juxtaposed with its network activity. An analysis of this chart brings forth some striking revelations. The burn rate is currently at 402K ETH per year, indicating that while transactions are ongoing and fees are being paid, a significant portion of Ether is being destroyed or \"burned\" but it is still not enough.\n\nOn the other hand, the supply growth shows an increase of 0.36% over a 30-day time frame. Moreover, the issuance sits at 834K ETH per year, which underscores the increasing creation of new Ether in the ecosystem.\n\nHowever, even with these factors pushing Ethereum toward an inflationary stance, it is crucial to note that the net issuance for Ethereum stands at a mere 0.44% annually. When juxtaposed with Bitcoin's inflation rate, Ethereum's figure is still considerably lower.\n\nFrom a pricing perspective, Ethereum has recently faced some challenges. The cryptocurrency has seen a retreat below the $1,600 mark, sparking concerns among investors and traders. With the current trajectory, Ethereum's price is inching closer to the critical $1,400 support level, which historically played a pivotal role in March as a point of trend reversal.\n\nFor now, Ethereum's price movement indicates downward pressure. While it is showing some resilience around the $1,575 zone, the continuous testing of this support suggests a potential breakdown. If ETH fails to maintain this stance, the road toward the $1,400 mark might be its next destination."

        "content": "TL;DR\n\nFerrari, the Italian luxury car manufacturer, is now accepting cryptocurrency payments, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and USD Coin (USDC) for its products.\n\nThe decision to accept cryptocurrencies came in response to requests from clients and dealers, including both traditional investors and young cryptocurrency investors.\n\nFerrari has partnered with BitPay as the payment processor, and this move is seen as a positive development for cryptocurrency adoption, although it may not significantly impact the market during bearish periods.\n\nItalian Luxury Car Maker Adopts BTC, ETH, & USDC.\n\nGalliera said many of Ferarri\u2019s clients are invested in cryptocurrencies. As a result, the company decided to accept crypto payments after a number of requests from clients and dealers:\n\n\u201cSome are young investors who have built their fortunes around cryptocurrencies. Some others are more traditional investors, who want to diversify their portfolios.\u201d\n\nMoreover, he said the company is hoping to expand its customer base by accepting crypto:\n\n\u201cThis will help us connect to people who are not necessarily our clients but might afford a Ferrari.\u201d\n\nGalliera assured customers looking to part with their crypto for a Ferarri that they will not have to pay more to use cryptocurrency for their purchase:\n\n\u201cPrices will not change, no fees, no surcharges if you pay through cryptocurrencies.\u201d\n\nFerrari is partnering with BitPay as the payment processor to make this happen. Holders of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and USDC will have the option to spend their tokens on the Italian luxury vehicle.\n\nOf course, purchases will still have to conform to local laws in buyers\u2019 legal jurisdictions. Not long ago, in 2021, a Frenchman got an 18-month jail sentence in Morocco for buying a Ferrari with $440,000 worth of Bitcoin.\n\nFerarri Brand Synergies with Cryptocurrency\n\nThis isn\u2019t the Italian car brand\u2019s first dust-up with crypto. In 2021, Ferrari partnered with Swiss tech firm Velas Network AG to bring NFTs to its fans.\n\nFerarri\u2019s brand reputation aligns well with blockchain. The carmaker is committed to innovation, performance, speed, and community. The most trusted and reliable cryptocurrencies share that same commitment.\n\nHigh finance legacy investor Bill Miller even compared Bitcoin to Ferrari in 2021, meanwhile comparing gold to a horse and buggy.\n\nThere\u2019s no telling for sure exactly how many new purchases Ferrari will transact using crypto. Many Bitcoin and Ether investors prefer to hold.\n\nCrypto investor Scott Melker, who goes by the moniker \u201cThe Wolf of All Streets\u201d on Twitter, pointed out investors will not likely part with their tokens during the bear market:\n\n\u201cMy take: great news for adoption, but unlikely to move the needle. When Tesla accepted bitcoin in 2021 it was viewed as huge news, but few people took advantage of the opportunity\u2026 Cool move by Ferrari, but unimportant for the market during the bear.\u201d\n\nOverall, this is bullish news for cryptocurrency. It\u2019s more earned media coverage, more social and market proof, and more ways for holders to use their crypto tokens. The fact that people won\u2019t likely part with their Bitcoin and Ether shows just how bullish crypto investors are for their holdings over the long term."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nFTX's bankruptcy estate staked roughly $122 million in Solana (SOL) tokens held in the firm's crypto wallets.\n\nThe transaction was tracked through on-chain data when an FTX-identified wallet transferred the tokens to Figment, a staking validator firm catering to institutional investors.\n\nAround the same time early on Saturday, the FTX estate also staked a total of 3,200 Ethereum (ETH) worth roughly $5 million, on-chain data shows.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA Nansen spokesperson told Decrypt that both crypto wallets are Alameda Research wallets, FTX's sister trading firm.\n\nStaking in the world of cryptocurrencies refers to the process of locking up a specific amount of tokens for a predetermined period. In return, holders who participate in staking receive rewards in the form of additional coins. This process plays a vital role in securing proof-of-stake (PoS) networks, such as Ethereum and Solana.\n\nIn August, the FTX\u2019s current leadership helmed by John J. Ray III, filed a motion seeking authorization and approval of guidelines for the sale of cryptocurrencies recovered during the bankruptcy proceedings.\n\n\"Hedging of Bitcoin and Ether\u2014two digital assets for which there is a liquid hedging market\u2014will provide a means to lessen the Debtors\u2019 exposure to adverse price movements in Bitcoin and Ether prior to their sale,\" said the filing.\n\nThe FTX estate's request was approved last month, with Mike Novogratz\u2019s Galaxy Digital appointed as the investment manager overseeing the sale of the assets, valued at a whopping $3.4 billion in Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and several other cryptocurrencies.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe original motion outlining FTX\u2019s \u201cDigital Asset Management and Monetization Program,\u201d however, also included the possibility of staking certain cryptocurrencies to generate passive yield\u2014the option the exchange\u2019s bankruptcy estate has now executed.\n\nFTX and Digital Galaxy didn\u2019t immediately reply to Decrypt\u2019s request for comment.\n\nFTX, Alameda and Solana\n\nFTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, who is currently on trial on fraud charges, was a notable advocate of Solana\u2014through Alameda Research, he invested in the project\u2019s developers Solana Labs, as well as other ecosystem projects.\n\nAdditionally, as the Solana Foundation revealed last year, FTX and Alameda Research purchased over 50.5 million SOL from the Foundation in the period between August 2020 and January 2021, with the larger portion of that amount locked until 2028 with a monthly unlock schedule.\n\nSOL soared to an all-time high of $260 in November 2021, however, is currently trading 91% off that peak\n\n\u201cThere were the Sam coins, including Solano [sic] which he didn't create but played a big role in promoting. It was more liquid than the other Sam coins,\u201d Caroline Ellison, the former CEO of FTX\u2019s sister trading firm Alameda Research and the star witness at the ongoing trial of SBF, said last week in court.\n\nNotably, Solana was also FTX\u2019s largest crypto holding at the time of the September court ruling, with as much as $1.16 billion in SOL sitting in the company\u2019s wallets."

        "content": "Qadir Ak is the founder of Coinpedia. He has over a decade of experience writing about technology and has been covering the blockchain and cryptocurrency space since 2010. He has also interviewed a few prominent experts within the cryptocurrency space.\n\nStory Highlights Ethereum staking interest has paused, with staking yields dropping from 5% to 3.5%.\n\nOther network metrics, such as mainnet activity and roll-up transactions, remain steady.\n\nThe Dencun upgrade in the first half of 2024 could renew interest in Ethereum staking.\n\nCoinbase\u2019s recent report points to a significant change in the world of cryptocurrency. It reveals a pause in investor interest in Ethereum staking, marking the first time since the Shanghai upgrade in May. This shift, alongside staking yields dropping from 5% to 3.5%, hints at a potential turning point for the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector.\n\nThe Shanghai Upgrade\n\nThe Shanghai upgrade of Ethereum, introduced in May, was a big deal because it allowed people to withdraw their staked ether for the first time. Validators, the folks who keep Ethereum running, were eagerly participating in staking, locking up their ether to earn rewards. But the enthusiasm has dwindled. The validator queue is now empty, and staking rewards have taken a nosedive, changing the balance of risk and reward.\n\n\u201cStaking yields provide a floor for the crypto ecosystem,\u201d analysts David Duong and David Han stated. \u201cIt serves as a benchmark for alternative crypto investments.\u201d\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum\u2019s Shanghai Upgrade Falls Short of Expectations, JP Morgan Report Reveals\n\nBeyond Staking: Ethereum Network Metrics\n\nWhile the excitement around staking cools down, other network metrics tell a different story. Ethereum\u2019s mainnet activity has remained steady throughout the third quarter, and the total roll-up transactions have increased. These rollups, which bundle transactions processed off the mainnet, show that Ethereum\u2019s ability to handle more transactions is still improving.\n\nIt\u2019s not just the crypto world facing uncertainty; the global economy might be in for some changes too. Concerns about rising bond yields and Federal Reserve policies are diminishing. Some predict that the United States might go through a recession in the first half of 2024 due to high interest rates and lower returns from government spending. This possible economic downturn could have significant effects on the crypto market, causing shifts in where investors put their money.\n\nDencun Upgrade: A Ray of Hope?\n\nSet for the first half of 2024, the Dencun upgrade is seen as the next big event for Ethereum. It introduces five Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) designed to increase storage capacity and reduce fees, which raises hopes for renewed interest in Ethereum staking.\n\nWhat we\u2019re seeing here seems to be a phase of consolidation and growth for the Ethereum network. According to the Coinbase report, unless major changes or security breaches occur, staking rewards are expected to remain relatively stable."

This puts it above several major global corporations in terms of market capitalization.\n\nEthereum remains above some global giants\n\nEthereum's current market value bests several globally recognized corporations. Thermo Fisher Scientific, a leader in scientific research services, trails just behind Ethereum with a valuation of $186.35 billion.\n\nPetroChina, a major Chinese oil and gas company, stands at $185.28 billion. Linde, a key player in the industrial gases sector, is valued at $184.38 billion. Pfizer, the pharmaceutical titan, holds a value of $181.29 billion. Telecommunications behemoth China Mobile comes in at $181.15 billion.\n\nFinally, the fast-food giant McDonald's, whimsically referenced by Adams, sits at a valuation of $180.95 billion.\n\nWill Ethereum drop below McDonald's?\n\nEthereum has been losing its market share over the past few months due to a confluence of bearish factors. Following the Shanghai upgrade in April, JPMorgan Chase reported a 12% drop in daily transactions on the Ethereum network, sparking concerns over its dwindling activity. The total value locked on the Ethereum network has also seen an 8% dip. Adding to Ethereum's woes, the debut of multiple Ether futures ETFs in the U.S. garnered lackluster attention, with trading volumes termed as \"shockingly low.\"\n\nHowever, some analysts remain uber-bullish in the long term. Banking giant Standard Chartered recently projected a bright future for Ethereum, suggesting that the cryptocurrency's native token, Ether, could touch the $8,000 mark within the next two years."

        "content": "The first half of October has been notably bearish for ETH coin, with the price plummeting 12% from a last recorded high of $1,745 down to a local support level of $1,531. Despite this descent, the appearance of a few green candles at this support level suggests that buyers are attempting to rally and set the stage for a potential recovery.\n\nAlso Read: What Should Ethereum Investors Do Amid Bullish Call for $8000 ETH Price?\n\nadvertisement\n\nWill Buyers Regain the $1700 Mark\n\nThe crypto buyers could witness high demand pressure around $1500\n\nThe Ethereum fear and greed index at 41% indicates neutral to bearish sentiment in the market\n\nThe intraday trading volume in Ether is $2.2 Billion, indicating a 34% loss.\n\nSource- Tradingview\n\nThe short-term trend in Ethereum coin price is currently sideways with its price wobbling between two horizontal levels of $1745 to $1530. With the recent downturn in the crypto market, the ETH price has dropped to the bottom support of the aforementioned range.\n\nOn October 13th, the buyers tried to rebound from this support but could not push the price above the $1573 level. Today, with an insignificant intraday loss of 0.05%, the daily candle shows uncertainty among market participants.\n\nTherefore, for traders to gain a better confirmation of a bullish reversal, the price should surpass the October 13th high of $1573. Under the influence of this range pattern formation, this bullish reversal should surge the prices 12.4% higher to rechallenge the $1745 mark.\n\nWill ETH Price Break Below $1500 Mark\n\nWhile the ETH price struggle to bounce back from the $1,530 mark suggests tepid bullish sentiment, a further slip below this support could find immediate support around the $1,500 level, which aligns with a longstanding trendline. This trendline forms the lower boundary of a rising channel pattern that has historically guided this altcoin\u2019s recovery phases for nearly 500 days. Should market participants continue to respect this pattern, the Ethereum coin could find a footing at $1,500, aiming for a more ambitious target above the last significant swing high of $2,138.\n\nRelative Strength Index: Despite the sideways action, the daily RSI slope rising with a pair for new higher highs and lows reflects the buyers. Attempt to regain higher ground.\n\nPivot levels: the traditional pivot level accentuates the $1573 as significant resistance followed by $1630 and $1732."

        "title": "Best Time to Buy Ethereum Could Be Soon: Last Cycle Suggests - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Ethereum has been in a descending channel against Bitcoin since August of last year, meaning Bitcoin has been the better investment over this time. However, historical trends show the tides could be changing soon, with Ethereum possibly on the brink of entering an accumulation phase.\n\nEthereum Price Action\n\nEthereum is trading at $1600, marking a 22% decrease from its price last August. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is 8% up over the same period.\n\nThis is a common trend that happens during bear markets. Coins with larger market capitalizations tend to be more resilient against price decreases as investors become more risk-averse and look to preserve their capital. While Ethereum isn\u2019t short at a market capitalization of $187 billion, it\u2019s still considerably lower than Bitcoin at $525 billion.\n\nDuring bull markets, coins with lower market capitalization outperform Bitcoin again as investors lean towards assets with greater potential returns.\n\nEthereum Price Compared Against Bitcoin\n\nWhen comparing ETH\u2019s value to BTC, it\u2019s evident that Ethereum has been trading within a descending channel since last August. This pattern, characterized by its lower highs and lower lows, often indicates a bearish trend in the market.\n\nETH's valuation against BTC over time. Source: ETHBTC on TradingView\n\nThe chart above highlights three other distinct phases:\n\nAccumulation phase: During this phase, price tends to stabilize, hinting at an upcoming change in momentum\n\nAscending channel: Here, the price experiences a significant reversal, often on a parabolic trajectory, characterized by highs and higher lows.\n\nDistribution phase: In the final phase, the price ceases its upward movement. Investors typically use this phase to capitalize on their gains and liquidate their positions.\n\nThe accumulation phase is typically the best time for investors to convert their Bitcoin into Ethereum. This phase is marked by price holding on at the bottom and then showing signs of reversal. Ethereum is still forming lower lows against Bitcoin, so it has not entered the accumulation phase yet. However, the last cycle shows that this could be changing soon.\n\nLast Cycle\n\nReflecting on the last cycle, Ethereum was in a descending channel against Bitcoin for 17 months. The accumulation phase then occurred from September 2019 up until February 2020. Based on the four-year theory, which suggests similar phases in the market occur every four years, this shows that the accumulation phase should also be approaching very soon in this cycle.\n\nYet, while the last cycle offers valuable insights, it\u2019s important to note that no two cycles are the same. In the current cycle, ETH\u2019s price action has not seen as much of a drop as in the previous cycle, which could be attributed to changing fundamentals and asset maturation.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nWhile an accumulation phase for Ethereum has not been confirmed yet, there remains the potential for its price to drop even further relative to Bitcoin. However, if the previous cycle is anything to go by, we could enter the accumulation phase soon. This phase typically presents prime buying opportunities for Ethereum.\n\nInvestment Disclaimer: The content provided in this article is for informational and educational purposes only.

        "content": "Bitcoin and other crypto tokens were trading with decent gains in the early week on Monday in Asia as the way cleared for the Bitcoin ETF in the US. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will not appeal the court\u2019s scathing reversal of its decision not to let Grayscale convert its bitcoin trust into an exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\n\n\nBitcoin jumped more than a per cent as the last crypto token managed to regain the 27,000-levels. However, its largest peer, Ethereum, was also in green but inched up only half-a-per cent to hold above $1,550-level. Altcoins were also trading with decent gains in the early morning.\n\n\n\nBitcoin has been trading approximately around the $27,000 level following the SEC's decision not to challenge a recent court ruling that favored Grayscale Investments. The court's verdict requires the SEC to undertake a review of Grayscale's ETF application, said Edul Patel, Co-Founder & CEO at Mudrex.\n\n\n\n\"Market participants are now cautiously hopeful for potential approval of Bitcoin's spot ETF applications by the SEC, resulting in a slightly positive sentiment. Bitcoin will now need to break through the $27,400 mark or find support around $26,900. Meanwhile, Ethereum continues to trade around $1,500,\" he said.\n\n\n\nBarring a few exceptions, the majority of top crypto tokens were trading higher on Monday. Tron and BNB gained 2 per cent each, while Chainlink jumped more than a per cent each. Solana and Litecoin were among the other key gainers in the morning. On the contrary, Polygon and Dogecoin were among the key gainers for the day.\n\n\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market cap was trading significantly higher, jumping to $1.06 trillion-mark, as it declined about one per cent in the last 24 hours. However, the total trading volumes surged as much as 38 per cent to $19.4 billion.\n\n\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum both showed positive gains over the weekend, driven by the news that the SEC won't appeal the court decision regarding Grayscale's spot Bitcoin ETF application. This news has sparked the interest of investors, as it raises the likelihood of a Bitcoin spot ETF approval by the end of the first quarter of 2024, said CoinDCX Research Team.\n\n\n\n\"The positive development of Ferrari, a luxury sports car company, accepting cryptocurrency as payment for its cars in the US and soon in Europe, has contributed to this positive sentiment,\" it added.\n\n\n\nImage: Crypto-chart-price\n\n\n\nTech View by Giottus Crypto Platform\n\nSolana (SOL) isin anascending trend with the asset trading above its 50-day simple moving average ($20.5).After recording short-term gains earlier this month, the asset is trying to regain momentum past two weeks of negative price action.

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nVeteran trader Peter Brandt put his X followers to the test on classical charting principles. Brandt posted an ETH chart that highlighted a pattern. He proceeded to ask his followers if the highlighted pattern was a rising wedge and, if not, what would need to happen to make it a wedge.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor context's sake, a rising wedge is a chart pattern used in technical analysis to predict a likely bearish reversal. It is depicted by a narrowing price range with higher highs and higher lows, both of which are enclosed by upward-sloping trendlines.\n\nThe question posed by the veteran trader does not seem not far-fetched, given that other chart patterns resemble the rising wedge pattern, both in structure and in trading strategies.\n\nThe falling wedge, ascending and descending triangles, symmetrical triangles, flags and pennants are examples.\n\nAn X user responded to Brandt's question by stating that the price action would need to touch the upper trendline a third time for the pattern to meet the definition of a wedge.\n\nBrandt agreed that a third upper contact point would be required for the wedge to properly form while adding that, more than likely, the pattern presented on the ETH chart might morph into something else.\n\nEthereum price action\n\nEthereum experienced declines in the past week, reaching a seven-month low at $1,520. The downward price movement coincided with Ethereum's total transaction fees declining to their lowest levels in years.\n\nAccording to on-chain analytics firm IntoTheBlock, total Ethereum fees hit their lowest point since April 2020. This decrease could be attributed to the migration to Layer 2 and the decreasing usage of applications on the mainnet.\n\nIn another tweet, IntoTheBlock noted that Ethereum's supply has been rising for the first time since December 2022, with the low transaction fees and increasing daily issuance contributing to this inflationary trend.\n\nAt the time of writing, ETH had slightly rebounded and was up 1.89% in the last 24 hours to $1,585."

        "content": "The notorious address tied to the Uranium Finance hack of 2021 has been caught in another financial movement, transferring $3.1 million from BNB Chain to Ethereum (ETH).\n\nThe primary adddess linked to the Uranium Finance hack of April 2021 has again moved another batch of funds, bridging $3.1 million in BUSD from BNB Chain to Ethereum and laundering $1.89 million to Tornado Cash.\n\nLeading blockchain security company Peck Shield first called attention to today\u2019s latest movement. Peck Shield\u2019s disclosure came when the exploiter had moved just $10,000 worth of BUSD to the Ethereum network using Stargate, a cross-chain bridging protocol.\n\nFollowing the alert from Peck Shield, the exploiter has moved more BUSD tokens to Ethereum. They bridged 500,000 BUSD in six separate transactions and 100,000 BUSD in one transaction, amounting to 3.1 million BUSD.\n\nYou might also like: IMF: Global economic stability at risk amid Israel-Hamas conflict\n\nThe recent transactions, which occurred today over one hour, have raised speculation among crypto proponents. After the transfers, the exploiter\u2019s address on the BNB Chain now holds over $15 million in BUSD and Wrapped BNB (WBNB).\n\nSpecifically, the address currently holds $10.29 million worth of BUSD and 22,185 WBNB valued at $4.73 million. Moreover, at the reporting time, their address on the Ethereum network boasts 824 Ether (ETH) worth $1.3 million, $12,980 worth of USDC and $12,487 worth of USDT.\n\nInterestingly, shortly after bridging the 3.1 million BUSD to the Ethereum network, the hacker moved 1,200 ETH (worth $1.89 million) to crypto mixing resource Tornado Cash. These ETH tokens were transferred over 12 transactions of 100 ETH each, between 7:32 AM and 8:09 AM (UTC) today.\n\nPrevious movements\n\nThe latest flow of funds comes 61 days after the address laundered 1,100 ETH through Tornado Cash in August. Interestingly, the exploiter had also moved 530 ETH to Tornado Cash in July, 670 ETH in June, and 650 ETH in May.\n\nThese transactions have followed a similar pattern throughout this year. Notably, the first batch of transfers occurred in March, as the exploiter leveraged a different address to move 2,250 ETH (worth $3.35 million at the time) to Tornado Cash.\n\nThe first batch of transactions came nearly two years after Uranium Finance fell victim to the hack. Recall that the exploiter drained $50 million of crypto assets from the protocol in April 2021. The hacker exploited a vulnerability in the Uranium Finance pair contracts.\n\nRead more: SEC nixes plans to appeal Grayscale Bitcoin ETF decision\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nIn a recent YouTube stream, Charles Hoskinson, the founder of Cardano, addressed persistent conspiracies within the XRP community related to Ethereum's purported influence over the SEC.\n\nA growing section of the vociferous crypto community has speculated that Ethereum backers may have had a role in the SEC's decision to pursue action against XRP. This implies a potential bias in the regulatory body's decision-making process. Hoskinson's comments aimed to provide clarity on the matter.\n\nFacts over conspiracy theories\n\nHoskinson began by emphasizing the importance of distinguishing between two primary concerns. Firstly, whether Ethereum received preferential treatment from the SEC, and secondly, whether individuals or entities associated with Ethereum might have lobbied or influenced the SEC's decision to take action against XRP.\n\nHe stressed that these are separate issues, with different implications, and should be treated as such. He urged the community to base their judgments on facts and evidence rather than conjecture.\n\nAddressing his stance, Hoskinson explicitly mentioned that he does not condone corruption and disapproves of any attempts to unduly influence government policy. At the same time, the cryptocurrency mogul has stressed that there is no evidence, such as texts, photos, or videos, that could point to any instances of corruption.\n\nHe further noted that he has never considered XRP to be a security and felt that making definitive statements on the SEC's motivations without concrete proof would be both unproductive and potentially misleading. He highlighted the necessity of robust discussions within the crypto community based on valid data and transparent sources rather than indulging in conspiracy theories.\n\nBurying the hatchet with XRP fans\n\nHoskinson, who left Ethereum in 2014, has repeatedly refuted ties and implications connected to events after his departure. Despite expressing a desire for peace with the XRP community and acknowledging XRP's win against the SEC, he's shown frustration over continuous associations with Ethereum's post-departure events. Central to the tensions is a conspiracy theory that the SEC showed undue favoritism to Ethereum over Ripple, which Hoskinson deems baseless. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse did not support the conspiracy theories but noted some questionable optics involving key SEC figures."

Well, the altcoin\u2019s bulls have really struggled to secure dominance during the crypto winter. But should anyone expand their portfolio for the short-term and long-term with ETC?\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETC Profit Calculator\n\nThe good news is that the choice is not that difficult for Ethereum Classic.

It is affiliated with Ethereum, one of the most popular blockchain networks in the world.

The cryptocurrency has been on an overall decline since the start of 2023, maintaining the same trend that we saw in the previous year.\n\nETC\u2019s price action suggested that we might see the bulls attempt to challenge the bears from its press time level. The cryptocurrency traded at $14.94 at the time of writing. This was noteworthy, because it was still within the same low range that acted as a long-term support.\n\nA key point here is that the same support level has been retested multiple times in the past. This means it is highly likely that the price could bounce back from the same level for the next short-term rally. The same could be said about its long-term potential.\n\nBut could Ethereum Classic bounce back from the same support level? At the time of writing, the Weighted Sentiment showed some improvement from the lowest price level since the start of October. However, it also highlighted a lack of strong interest.\n\nETC\u2019s Volume metric also reflected the lack of excitement in the cryptocurrency. The press time on-chain observations revealed that Volume fell to its lowest in four weeks.\n\nRead Ethereum Classic\u2019s [ETC] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nOn the other hand, its Binance Funding Rate was back to the positive side of things, suggesting that Ethereum Classic\u2019s demand was growing in the derivatives market.\n\nWhile the positive funding rates may point to recovering demand, it was clear that spot demand was still quite low at the time of writing. As such, there is a chance that short-term price action might remain bearish."

These accounts have processed more than 2.6 million bundled transactions, and they are primarily dominated by Polygon.\n\nERC-4337 Smart Accounts \u2013 Dune Analytics\n\nDeFi analyst Stacy Muur states that smart account transactions have risen over 100%, growing from 7k to a record-breaking 892k within just 6 months of the period from April 2023 to September 2023.\n\nIntents in Focus: Paving the Road for a Better Web3 UX.\n\n\n\nERC-4337 smart account transactions:\n\n\n\n\u276f April 2023: 7,511\n\n\u276f June 2023: 56,844\n\n\u276f September 2023: 892,524\n\n\n\nWe just cannot afford to ignore it.\n\n\n\nAll you need to know about the intent-centric approach, short and simple \u2193\u2026 pic.twitter.com/KIqkC3hHf6 \u2014 Stacy Muur (@stacy_muur) October 15, 2023\n\nRapid innovations and advancements have always been at the forefront of decentralized finance, which frequently changes primitives in a short span of time.\n\nWhile Account Abstraction is quite a new narrative in this industry, it is already widespread among developers, and it has been magnified to stack newer solutions like \u2018Intents\u2019 on top of it.\n\nSmart Accounts are quietly becoming popular within the crypto community with their current little dominance, which is expected to grow further in the coming years."

        "content": "ETMarkets.com\n\nThe crypto tokens surged on Monday after the SEC refrained from appealing against the Bitcoin ETF. Bitcoin was up 3.8% at $27,909, while Ethereum was above the $1,550 level.Meanwhile, the global cryptocurrency market cap surged 2.6% to around $1.08 trillion in the last 24 hours.\"BTC and ETH both showed positive gains over the weekend, driven by the news that the SEC won't appeal the court decision regarding Grayscale's spot Bitcoin ETF application. This news has sparked the interest of investors, as it raises the likelihood of a BTC spot ETF approval by the end of the first quarter of 2024,\" said CoinDCX Research Team.Meanwhile, Parth Chaturvedi, Investments Lead at CoinSwitch Ventures, said, \"In a positive development that underlines the crypto adoption, Ferrari - a well-renowned car manufacturer will now accept crypto as a payment method for its luxury cars in the U.S. To execute this, the company has partnered with BitPay wherein payments will be accepted in BTC, ETH, and USDC. As part of its expansion plans, this payment method will soon be available in Europe as well.\"In today's trade, other crypto tokens were also trading higher. Solana and Tron rose up to 3%, while Toncoin, XRP, BNB, Litecoin, and Polkadot surged up to 2%.In the last 24 hours, the market cap of Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency, surged to $544 billion. Bitcoin's dominance is currently 50.3%, according to CoinMarketCap. BTC volume in the last 24 hours increased 120.4% to $10.94 billion.Bitcoin has been locked in a trading range between moving averages recently, reflecting uncertainty and a standoff between bullish and bearish sentiment regarding its next price movement. Such tight consolidations often precede significant price swings.However, Bitcoin didn't favoured the bulls last week, with its price on track to close with a more than 3% loss. This downward pressure, coupled with regulatory concerns, has contributed to a reduced interest in Altcoins among crypto investors. Consequently, Bitcoin's market dominance has remained near the 50% mark.Bitcoin after testing the crucial support level of $25,000 (Horizontal Trendline & 50% Fibonacci Retracement Level) has witnessed a relief rally and the prices went up almost by 14% to $28,580. The bulls failed to manage their grip on the asset as BTC resisted at $28,500 and corrected to $26,538. Over the past four days, the asset has been trading in a narrow range from $26,550 to $27,250 with low volumes. BTC has strong support at $25,000 and strong resistance at $32,500. Breakouts on either side of these levels with good volumes will further decide the trend of the asset.(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

        "content": "Bitcoin and Ethereum have been in a battle for the top spot as the leading crypto in the digital market. Recent events have proven both digital assets to be resilient assets in the saturated market. Over 15 new whales have joined the market and backed Bitcoin, owning over 100 BTC, elevating the asset\u2019s credibility as a good investment.\n\nOn the other hand, Ethereum\u2019s inflation, seen since late last year, is currently losing to Bitcoin, as its price ranges below the support. Regardless, both assets still show promise in being lucrative investments, with Bitcoin taking the lead in a market cap of $559 billion as of mid-2023.\n\nCrypto whales owning BTC and ETH\n\nBitcoin, the first-generation crypto, has long had solid inventors as it keeps showing promise in the market. Currently, new wallets have been identified, owning large sums of Bitcoin, ranging from 100 to 1000 BTC.\n\nAccording to recent data, 16 newly identified wallets own this number of BTC. As such, this implies a bullish trend for the first generation of crypto.\n\nSince the first quarter of last year, the crypto realm has seen an interesting surge in investments as both sharks and whales accumulate a minimum of 10 BTC. In the past 20 months, over 11,800 addresses have been recorded crossing this level, representing an 8.12% increase in shark and whale wallet holders.\n\nOn the other hand, Ethereum has witnessed a decline in its whale account holders. Ethereum Whales are considered account holders with over 1000 ETH. The number of these holders has seen a decline over the past 3 years. This is a result of Ethereum whales offloading over 20 million ETH, suggesting a shift of confidence in the digital asset.\n\nConsidering this, it\u2019s evident that Bitcoin whales backing BTC have shifted Bitcoin\u2019s growth to a stable market position. Moreover, following the decrease in ETH whales, Ethereum\u2019s losing inflation might be a result of the declining account holders. Since late December 2022, ETH has faced an upward surge in its supply in the digital market, contributing to an inflation trend.\n\nOther factors contributed to its increased inflation based on a rise in ETH supply, among them being reduced transaction fees. However, according to market data, the digital asset is losing inflation.\n\nEthereum inflation is lower than Bitcoin\n\nCurrently, ETH\u2019s burn rate is at 402K ETH per year, and with its whales exchanging their assets, its losing inflation is displaying a potential dip in market price. Regardless, its supply growth is on the rise by 0.36% over the past month and stands at 0.44% annually.\n\nOn a yearly frame, its issuance rests at 834K ETH. This is lower than the increasing creation of Ether, and considering that, its burn rate is still not enough. The transaction burning features have acted on reducing the supply of ETH and, in turn, reducing its inflation rate.\n\nWhen compared to Bitcoin, Ethereum\u2019s inflation is considerably lower. Among the major influences of this is Bitcoin whales, who go long BTC while ETH whales go short. Moreover, Ethereum has seen a decline in its price below the $1,600 mark, testing the support zone of $1,575.\n\nBased on the market sentiments and data recorded, Ethereum\u2019s losing inflation displayed a probable scenario where ETH might reach $1,400.\n\nThe emergence of the new Bitcoin whales has driven the demand for BTC, and this affects its value positively. Additionally, according to Whale Alert, a whale account previously transferred 9,775 BTC last week.\n\nAs the whales buy more BTC that is already limited in supply, it makes it even more scarce, in turn driving up its value. Still, regardless of Bitcoin\u2019s deflationary trend, this has initiated a new wave of BTC whales. It\u2019s evident that Ethereum is showcasing reduced inflation but could still rise as its adoption increases."
