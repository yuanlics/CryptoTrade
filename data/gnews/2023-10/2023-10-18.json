        "content": "In a recent interactive session, Ethereum\u2019s co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, shed light on the platform\u2019s technical advances and celebrated emerging decentralized projects within its ecosystem.\n\nIn a recent Ask Me Anything (AMA) session, Ethereum Co-founder Vitalik Buterin touched on several topics that offer a glimpse into the potential trajectory of the Ethereum ecosystem. Drawing insights from a report by Odaily news, the discourse ranged from technical advancements to acknowledgments of decentralized projects, weaving a narrative of Ethereum\u2019s evolving landscape.\n\nForemost, Buterin delved into the intricacies of quantum resistance\u2014a burgeoning concern in the blockchain community given the potential of quantum computing to challenge existing cryptographic systems. He discussed the role of account abstraction, specifically through Ethereum\u2019s proposal ERC-4337.\n\nThis initiative, according to Buterin, can imbue users\u2019 accounts with quantum-resistant properties, fortifying Ethereum against future threats posed by quantum computers. Such a development underscores the proactive approach the Ethereum community is taking to ensure the blockchain\u2019s continued security and relevance.\n\nYou might also like: Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin calls for privacy and decentralization\n\nBeyond the technical realm, Buterin also spotlighted some decentralized projects that exemplify innovation and impact within the Ethereum ecosystem. Polymarket, a decentralized prediction market platform, garnered Buterin\u2019s praise for its strides in decentralized finance (DeFi).\n\nThe platform allows users to speculate on future events, illustrating the versatility of DeFi applications. PoolTogether, a no-loss lottery system built on Ethereum (ETH), similarly caught Buterin\u2019s attention. This unique model lets users pool funds, earn interest and stand a chance to win prizes\u2014a testament to the creative possibilities of blockchain technology.\n\nOn a more personal tangent, Buterin expressed his admiration for several cities around the globe. Singapore, Taipei, Vienna, Toronto and the New York State\u2019s City of Ithaca made the list, each resonating with Buterin for their distinctive mix of technological innovation and cultural vibrancy.\n\nIn wrapping up, the insights from Buterin\u2019s AMA serve as a compelling indicator of Ethereum\u2019s forward momentum, with an emphasis on both technological foresight and the value of innovative decentralized projects.\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "title": "Should You Buy Ethereum While It's Below $2,000? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "It's hard to deny how wonderful an investment Ethereum (ETH 4.70%) has been. As of this writing, the token's price is up more than 52,000% since its public launch in July 2015.\n\nThat's an impressive gain, but it hasn't been a smooth ride for investors. Ethereum currently sits 68% off its all-time high price, set in November 2021.\n\nIs it smart to buy this top cryptocurrency while it's still below $2,000? Let's look at the reasons both for and against this decision.\n\nBuying the dip could be a smart move\n\nThe obvious reason to be a buyer right now is how beaten-down Ethereum's price is. During the huge bull run in 2021, crypto markets drew a lot of enthusiasm from the investment community looking for quick profits. Things certainly look to have been in bubble territory. In the years since, there has been a bit of a normalization, which might be a good thing.\n\nRapidly rising interest rates crushed the stock and crypto markets in 2022. And it introduced a prolonged market downturn in digital assets, even though Ethereum has climbed this year.\n\nAll else equal, investing in something when its price is lower is a better move. Should things still play out as hoped, the upside is greater than if you had bought at a higher price. This could be the situation with Ethereum right now.\n\nSome investors are bullish on Ethereum for its game-changing potential, primarily in the world of decentralized applications (dApps). That this blockchain has capabilities to build smart contracts has caused many believers to see a lot of use cases developing over time.\n\nWhile the activity around decentralized finance protocols and non-fungible tokens has cooled off, Ethereum remains the leader in these innovations. Thus, when the market rebounds, as it has done in the past, demand for the blockchain could soar once again with a growing dApp ecosystem.\n\nEthereum's transition to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism 13 months ago might have won over a lot of people. This move reduced the network's energy usage by more than 99%, which will certainly go over well with climate activists. It paves the way for a more sustainable future.\n\nEthereum is too risky\n\nThere are also some clear reasons not to buy Ethereum -- despite its price being below $2,000 at the moment. Cryptocurrencies might simply be way too volatile for some investors. This issue is more of a concern for those who are near or in retirement. Owning Ethereum exposes the portfolio to wild valuation swings, which could be too hard to stomach.\n\nSome naysayers might also argue that there isn't even a need for Ethereum. In other words, it's a solution looking for a problem to solve.\n\nTake financial services, for example. DeFi promises to remove intermediaries, which might lead to better consumer pricing and rates. But as we've seen with the failures of major crypto firms, things are opaque and too complex to understand. For all its faults, the current financial system is adequate for most people, and that could eliminate the demand for DeFi services.\n\nEthereum faces regulatory uncertainty, too. Is it a security? If the Securities and Exchange Commission one day rules that it is, that means Ethereum will have to abide by comprehensive reporting requirements. And this could result in heightened public scrutiny of the crypto.\n\nThere's even a possibility that Ethereum won't get back to its all-time high ever. The euphoria that characterized the market in 2021 might be a one-hit wonder.\n\nOn one hand, I can see why some investors might be interested in starting a tiny position in Ethereum, primarily as a result of its potential. But I'm in the camp that says it's better to probably be a bit more critical and avoid the crypto altogether or await further developments."

        "title": "Ethereum restaking: Blockchain innovation or dangerous house of cards? - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Ethereum restaking \u2014 proposed by middleware protocol EigenLayer \u2014 is a controversial innovation over the past year that has some of the brightest minds worried about the potential ramifications.\n\n\n\nRestaking involves reusing staked or locked-up Ether tokens to earn fees and rewards. The restaked tokens can then help secure and validate other protocols.\n\nProponents believe restaking can squeeze additional security and rewards from already staked ETH and grow the crypto ecosystem in a healthier way based on Ethereum\u2019s existing trust mechanisms. Restaking could serve as a security primitive for exporting Ethereum\u2019s trust generated by its validators to other projects.\n\nYet Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin and a number of key devs worry that restaking is a house of cards that will inevitably tumble. Some of those Ethereum devs have even proposed a fork to head off restaking platform EigenLayer.\n\nWhy the project\u2019s founders promote \u201ctrust as a service\u201d from Ethereum without the Ethereum founder and others\u2019 willingness to participate is still to play out. Will the whole concept result in an Ethereum fork to protect the network from catastrophic failure?\n\nThe way eth Community turned on EigenLayer should be studied, it\u2019s not for building, just side @BanklessHQ deals with canto n other grifters, we gonna keep forking yall ideas tho on other non zuzalu shit https://t.co/7Erh6qKVSE \u2014 \u27e0yumatrades.eth\u27e0 \u2013 #6585 (\ud83d\ude08,\ud83d\ude07) (@yumatrades) May 22, 2023\n\nStaking and restaking\n\nStaking is a crypto-native concept. On Ethereum, it means putting up a security bond in ETH so that the validator (validators of new transactions who maintain the security of the blockchain) will behave honestly in verifying transactions rather than lose their staked tokens. Stakers are then paid rewards for locking up this ETH.\n\nIn essence, stakers lock up their tokens to commit to producing Ethereum blocks \u2014 an on-chain way of supporting development, regardless of fluctuations in highly volatile token prices.\n\nSo what is restaking?\n\nIn short, restaking works in that already staked Ethereum tokens can be rehypothecated (when a lender re-uses collateral posted from one loan to take out a new loan) to secure a wider variety of applications and accrue additional rewards.\n\nBut restakers also get penalized or slashed for non-performance of their staking tasks. (More on that below).\n\nSo restaking is a crypto primitive for generating economic security from Ethereum\u2019s nine years of concerted developer activity and project track record.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an extension protocol to extend what Ethereum can do, scaling out Ethereum stakers beyond Ethereum to other bridges and oracles that need to be secured,\u201d EigenLayer founder Sreeram Kannan tells Magazine.\n\n\n\nHe says EigenLayer is commoditizing ETH staking to make it more general purpose, as, in crypto parlance, \u201cstaking is the root of trust.\u201d\n\nKannan is an academic on leave from the University of Washington, and EigenLayer began as academic research into \u201cexported trust\u201d as a consensus protocol. Basically, he sought to piggyback the trust generated by Ethereum to other ecosystems.\n\nKannan essentially seeks to export the \u201ctrust\u201d generated by Ethereum for other projects across the ecosystem and other chains. \u201cIn crypto, mechanisms for trust mean that investors need skin in the game. The pseudonymous world needs carrots and sticks whereby validators are distributed.\u201d He calls it \u201cpermissionless innovation.\u201d\n\nThe best each chain has to offer\n\nThe big idea for EigenLayer is to bridge blockchains and create super applications, taking the best each chain has to offer. Kannan says \u201cevery ecosystem is better in some dimension, but not all dimensions,\u201d and EigenLayer enhancing decentralized tech stacks will actually benefit the industry.\n\nKannan said that what can be built with EigenLayer fits roughly into two categories.\n\n\n\nFirstly, EigenLayer allows for the construction of bridges from chain to chain, say Ethereum to Avalanche. EigenLayer acts as a marketplace for \u201cdecentralized trust,\u201d connecting stakers seeking yields, projects built on EigenLayer offering risk-reward structures for yields, and operators acting as bridges between stakers and projects.\n\nSecondly, a set of smart contracts on Ethereum\u2019s chain lets ETH stakers opt to run other software. EigenLayer could, for example, improve Ethereum transaction finality speeds. ETH stakers can now take the layer-1 blockchain Fantom chain (for better transaction finality times) and fork it on EigenLayer, thereby running a layer as a super fast finalization layer with an EigenLayer trust layer.\n\nBut it\u2019s all still theoretical.\n\nThe idea of restaking makes sense theoretically, helping projects build off Ethereum\u2019s security layer \u2014 but the problems worry many.\n\nIn theory, \u201cit\u2019s like the NATO security alliance; each country is still a sovereign country, but their mutual defense pact is secured by the sum of their military power,\u201d Sunny Aggarwal, co-founder of Osmosis Labs and creator of a similar restaking system \u2014 Mesh, on Cosmos\u2019 chain \u2014 told Magazine.\n\nIn practice, EigenLayer provides two ways to restake: whitelisted liquid staking derivatives can be restaked with EigenLayer or an EigenPod (a smart contract can be created to run a validator while restaking). But most restakers won\u2019t run their own validator, so new networks can build projects without their own communities of validators.\n\nEigenLayer isn\u2019t live yet, and it\u2019s impact is still highly speculative, according to Anthony \u201c0xSassal\u201d Sassano, a full-time Ethereuem educator, founder of YouTube channel The Daily Gwei and an early investor in EigenLayer.\n\nTo date, there\u2019s only a smart contract for staked ETH to bootstrap the EigenLayer network, and perhaps given EigenLayer\u2019s hype, people are depositing their ETH into that network, expecting to farm an unconfirmed airdrop of native EigenLayer tokens.\n\nA force for good or evil?\n\nTo be successful, new consensus protocols need a balanced alignment of incentives. Trust is like a scale weighing competing interests. And trying to export Ethereum security layers to different blockchain ecosystems worries some. Many are still trying to understand if it\u2019s a force for good or evil \u2014 or both.\n\n\u201cThere are two camps: those excited by broadening the use case of ETH staking, and then there are those that worry about potential attack vectors on Ethereum and potential negative consequences for Ethereum if something goes wrong with EigenLayer. My view is in the middle; I understand the concerns and the excitement.\u201d Sassano says.\n\n\u201cInherently, all of this is complex; it depends which rabbit hole you want to go down. The simple answer is that Ethereum, as a network, currently has over 25 million ETH at stake \u2014 that\u2019s tens of billions of dollars. So restaking is asking, what if we could harness that economic security for other purposes than just securing the Ethereum chain?\u201d\n\nSassano continues: \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what EigenLayer is trying to do, to generalize the security that Ethereum has with its stakers and expand that to other things like an oracle network or a data availability network. It\u2019s inherently more technical and complex than that, but that\u2019s the gist of it.\u201d\n\nThere are two types of danger that restaking could pose: first for \u201crestakers\u201d and then for Ethereum itself.\n\nRestaking creates too much leverage\n\nRestaking is controversial as it is akin to leveraged investing through borrowing. Some argue that the danger here is that the hunger for \u201creal yields\u201d or actual revenue that emerged in crypto in 2022 leads to unsavory developments, like restaking.\n\nJae Sik Choi, portfolio manager at Greythorn Asset Management, told Magazine that securing networks through restaking could work, but restaking is akin to leverage:\n\n\u201cJust like how Terra\u2019s over-leveraged \u2018safe\u2019 collateralization of Luna was, there would always be a risk of participants over-leveraging into this new concept, and such a risk won\u2019t be quantifiable until we see more data sets throughout the emergence of this new restaking narrative.\u201d\n\nDan Bar, chief investment officer at Bitfwd Capital \u2014 a boutique crypto assets hedge fund \u2014 agreed that restaking amounts to leverage, telling Magazine: \u201cWhile moderate schemes of restaking could be beneficial for capital efficiency purposes, any crypto assets manager and finance professional worth their salt knows too well how easily and quickly leverage can turn into a slew of synthetic toxic financial instruments that bring disasters into even the most healthy of ecosystems.\u201d\n\n\n\nAnd maybe that\u2019s the first major problem. Investors will only see restaking as quick, easily leveraged financial products. EigenLayer building an open-source, decentralized network security may fail to convince doubters.\n\nRisks to Ethereum itself\n\nOne fear is that slashing on EigenLayer will affect Ethereum itself.\n\n\n\nEthereum\u2019s proof-of-stake trust system keeps everyone in check with slashing conditions \u2014 essentially non-performance penalties. Programmable slashing means restakers have additional computational responsibilities and face consequences for non-execution.\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin fears an overload of the chain\u2019s consensus, basically, computational overloads, if the blockchain\u2019s computational power is suddenly redirected elsewhere.\n\nKannan admits that Vitalik\u2019s concerns are valid. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to shard Ethereum\u2019s trust layer, and we don\u2019t want contagion of nefarious actors leveraging Ethereum\u2019s trust system.\u201d\n\n\n\nSassano also notes that the functionality of Ethereum proof-of-stake was designed to make sure that there won\u2019t be a sudden influx or outflux of validators, which would affect the core properties of Ethereum\u2019s consensus mechanism.\n\nThe issue is that EigenLayer will decide where to take ETH from, but they can\u2019t slash a validator on Ethereum.\n\n\u201cIn Ethereum, there\u2019s also a queue for validators to enter or exit each day. So let\u2019s say, in an extreme example, 30% of all staked ETH begins staking with EigenLayer and say that all 30% gets \u2018slashed\u2019 by EigenLayer. While it depends on what the slashing condition was, let\u2019s say all this ETH was lost because they tried to do something really bad. Even if all 30% had to be exited, there\u2019s a limit on how much can exit per day. It would take literally years to exit 30% of ETH stake. So I understand people\u2019s concerns, but at the same time, other things built on top cannot dictate what happens on Ethereum.\u201d\n\nSo, restakers should have to play by Ethereum\u2019s rules.\n\nYet Sassano\u2019s biggest concern is around the calculus of ETH staking, which may one day become a question of whether stakers get more from staking on EigenLayer than Ethereum itself. This could erode the Ethereum staking model in time.\n\nHe is confident, though, that Ethereum\u2019s tech offsets those systemic risks: \u201cIt\u2019s not a critical risk to Ethereum if you are slashed on EigenLayer. You are not slashed on Ethereum. EigenLayer cannot cause you to be slashed on Ethereum because Ethereum has its own slashing conditions built into the protocol. And EigenLayer has its own separate slashing conditions built into its protocol as well.\u201d\n\nAnything built on top of Ethereum introduces additional complexity and risk. Juan David Mendieta Villegas, co-founder and chairman at crypto market maker Keyrock, tells Magazine:\n\n\u201cEigenLayer is an interesting development but creates additional attack vectors without providing explicit benefits to the Ethereum ecosystem itself. If we take a step back, it\u2019s important to note that ETH staking has introduced a base benchmark yield for the industry, and that is a good development. You can almost think of it as a \u2018risk-free\u2019 rate. Any additional layers, such as liquid staking derivatives and re-staking mechanisms, of course, can carry more concerns such as concentration risk, security and smart contract.\u201d\n\nBut Villegas wishes EigenLayer well. \u201cOverall, we\u2019re advocates of the innovations that are happening around staking and want to see multiple protocols win as this will assist in the decentralization and democratization of the network.\u201d\n\nIn other words, he wishes for competitors to EigenLayer to create similar products.\n\nGreat conversation. The TLDR is that basically Justin, Vitalik, and Dankrad all agree that restaking is a giant existential threat to Ethereum if it gets big (if it even works at all). These guys are all way too nice, but this was a brutal takedown of Eigenlayer. The takeaway\u2026 https://t.co/kY8gKmzxrF \u2014 the_fett (@themandalore9) June 30, 2023\n\nRestaking could make or break new projects\n\nCosmos\u2019 Aggarwal believes restaking will only benefit those blockchains with existing network effects for those with existing economic alliances or overlapping communities.\n\nHe also sees restaking protocols akin to a venture capital arm for layer 1s that might discourage solo stakers and further centralize networks.\n\nIn the end, competing layer-1 blockchains probably won\u2019t engage in restaking across chains. For that reason, he feels that EigenLayer\u2019s design could be improved.\n\nWhile EigenLayer is designed as a security system importing trust from Ethereum, builders will create their own tokens and revenue models. This has pluses and minuses.\n\nIn some cases, dodgy new tokens may benefit from Ethereum\u2019s trust layer. Choi thinks \u201cthis trust layer benefit could potentially be moot due to the tokenomics that these alt layer 1s would want to try and attain (i.e., the use of their own token \u2014 their own agendas) could be problematic and so any supposed trust exported from Ethereum is lost anyway.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, experimental, well-meaning projects may now have a chance at success thanks to EigenLayer. That\u2019s why Choi thinks the ultimate potential benefit EigenLayer is proposing is that other blockchains that do not want to spin up their own validator and staker sets have a chance at scaling to success.\n\nAggarwal also notes that with appropriate checks, restaking should be set within parameters to control risk. Restaking primitives need cleverly programmed governance, such as discounted voting power to restaked tokens on another chain. For example, one restaker can\u2019t have more than 20% of the vote for another chain.\n\nSo, is restaking a good thing for Ethereum?\n\n\u201cThe purists would say Ethereum should only be securing the Ethereum Beacon Chain and nothing else. [They] shouldn\u2019t be exporting Ethereum security to anything else. But I don\u2019t think that is necessarily a bad thing to get node operators to do other work,\u201d says Sassano.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf it can happen on the Ethereum network, it will happen. If the network can\u2019t resist it and Ethreuem\u2019s chain becomes insecure because of it, and there are adverse effects because of it, then Ethereum as a protocol was not designed correctly and needs to be improved.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll find out soon enough."

        "content": "SkyBridge Capital founder, Anthony Scaramucci has shed a bullish light on the future price trajectories of Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC), Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH), and Algorand (CRYPTO: ALGO), suggesting hearty targets for these cryptocurrencies, detailing the intrinsic factors that could drive such a bullish trend.\n\nThis optimistic outlook comes just ahead of Benzinga's Future of Digital Assets conference on Nov. 14, which aims to delve into the evolving dynamics of digital assets. Discussions about these predictions by Scaramucci could form a riveting part of the narrative as industry experts explore the potential future of cryptocurrencies.\n\nScaramucci postulates a bullish scenario for Bitcoin, attributing his confidence to the post-halving cycle which historically propels a surge in demand, in an interview with Altcoin Daily.\n\nHe states, \u201cI believe six to 12 months after the halving cycle, there\u2019s no reason why Bitcoin couldn\u2019t be at $100,000. Just given what I know about demand and given what I know about the cycle and where the miners are, and so forth, plus, we may get some interest rate relief. That\u2019s a 3x bump.\u201d\n\nHis prediction reflects a tripling in Bitcoin\u2019s value, which he analogizes to the technological advancements that have historically witnessed such price surges.\n\nWhile Scaramucci admits to not being as intimately acquainted with Ethereum, he nonetheless holds a positive stance.\n\nAlso Read: Fed Governor Michelle Bowman Says Creation Of US CBDC 'Could Pose Significant Risks'\n\nHighlighting the technological improvements and the increasing utility that Ethereum offers, he said, \u201cCould Ethereum be $4,500 by then? Why not? You know it\u2019s a great utility. Speeds have improved. The layer-2s have helped it. Why not? Why couldn\u2019t it be $4,500? These things are maturing.\u201d\n\nHis optimism extends to Algorand, albeit with a tempered tone due to its current trading price. Despite the crypto\u2019s present modest trading range of around $0.09 to $0.10, Scaramucci sees potential for growth.\n\nHe envisions a path to $0.30 per token as Algorand continues to develop and garner adoption, especially from corporations enamored by its technology.\n\nHe adds, \u201cI\u2019m bullish. I thought at $1 it could have easily gotten to $5... but could Algorand from here... could it be a $0.30 token as they continue their development and continue the adoption of what they\u2019re doing and bringing in corporations that love the technology? I believe it can.\u201d\n\nRead Next: Binance.US Changes Terms: No More Direct Withdrawals Of US Dollars From Platform\n\nJoin Benzinga's Fintech Deal Day & Awards on Nov. 13 and Future of Digital Assets on Nov. 14 in New York City to stay updated on trends like AI, regulations, SEC actions and institutional adoption in the crypto space.

        "content": "Does Ethereum Have A Future?\n\nIn the fast-paced world of cryptocurrencies, Ethereum stands out. But many wonder, does it have a future?\n\nA system eliminating the need for traditional intermediaries through Ethereum\u2019s smart contracts. With the introduction of Ethereum 2.0, there\u2019s talk of greater speed, efficiency, and a smaller environmental footprint. This change signifies a substantial shift.\n\nHowever, challenges persist, including slow transactions, energy demands, and intense competition. Can Ethereum maintain its relevance in the ever-evolving blockchain sphere?\n\nIn this exploration, we\u2019re taking a straightforward look at Ethereum\u2019s capabilities, the shifts in technology, and trends to understand whether this key player in the digital currency space can continue its trajectory of influence.\n\nLet\u2019s explore what the future may hold for Ethereum!\n\nUnderstanding Ethereum\u2019s Core\n\nTo grasp the potential future of Ethereum casino, comprehending its foundational principles is essential. Ethereum extends beyond the simple notion of cryptocurrency, offering a broader technological platform with unique features that have captivated developers and innovators worldwide.\n\nLet\u2019s break down the core components and functionalities that define Ethereum.\n\nWhat is Ethereum?\n\nEthereum is an open-source, blockchain-based platform that enables the creation of decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts. Unlike traditional applications, dApps don\u2019t require a middleman to function or manage user information, which means they connect users and providers directly.\n\nSmart Contracts:\n\nAt the heart of Ethereum are smart contracts, self-executing contracts with the terms directly written into code. They automatically perform actions when predefined conditions are met without requiring intermediaries or external enforcement mechanisms. This trustless environment creates countless possibilities for unmediated interaction, making these contracts a revolutionary aspect of blockchain technology.\n\nEthereum Virtual Machine (EVM):\n\nThe Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is the runtime environment that processes smart contracts and allows the execution of scripts in the Ethereum network. It\u2019s Turing complete, meaning it can solve any computational problem, given enough time and memory. The EVM executes the script through a distributed node network, ensuring redundancy and reliability.\n\nEther \u2013 Fuel for the Network:\n\nEther (ETH) is Ethereum\u2019s native cryptocurrency. It compensates participant nodes for computations performed and as a transaction fee for users who want to change applications, execute smart contracts, or transfer tokens. This prevents the network from being cluttered with unnecessary transactions or suffering from potential DDOS attacks.\n\nDecentralized Applications (dApps):\n\nEthereum\u2019s crypto casino platform enables developers to build dApps that run on its blockchain. These applications can range from games to social networks, financial systems, and more, all operating on a decentralized network, meaning any governing entity does not control them. This fosters a new wave of transparency and resistance to censorship on the internet.\n\nScalability Concerns in Ethereum\n\nEthereum garners attention and becomes a hub for various decentralized applications and financial transactions. Its network faces a critical challenge: scalability. Understanding this hurdle requires diving into what scalability means, why it\u2019s pivotal, and how it\u2019s currently a bottleneck for Ethereum\u2019s potential full-scale adoption.\n\nDefining Scalability:\n\nIn blockchain technology, scalability refers to a network\u2019s capacity to handle a growing amount of work and its potential to be enlarged to accommodate that growth. For Ethereum, this means processing more transactions per second at lower costs, ensuring the network remains fast and affordable as it grows. This scalability is crucial, especially for sectors like crypto casinos, which require rapid, cost-effective transactions to manage the high volume of user activities efficiently and financial dealings inherent in such platforms.\n\nThe Bottleneck Issue:\n\nEthereum, like many blockchain platforms, struggles with a scalability issue. Currently, it can process only a handful of transactions per second. As the number of transactions on the network increases, the time it takes to confirm transactions also rises, leading to a congested network. This limitation is a significant concern because it restricts the platform\u2019s usefulness for global systems requiring fast and numerous transactions.\n\nGas Fees and Network Congestion:\n\nWhen the network becomes congested, users compete to have their transactions processed faster by offering higher \u201cgas fees\u201d (transaction fees). This competition leads to a surge in transaction costs, making Ethereum less attractive, especially for smaller, everyday transactions. It\u2019s akin to a traffic jam where road space is auctioned to the highest bidder, leading to high travel costs.\n\nImpact on dApps Functionality:\n\nFor dApps developers, scalability issues mean their applications can\u2019t operate efficiently under high traffic. Slow transactions and high fees could lead users to alternative platforms with better performance, affecting not just individual dApps but the entire Ethereum ecosystem if the trend becomes widespread.\n\nComparison with Traditional Systems:\n\nWhen compared to traditional financial service systems like Visa or PayPal, Ethereum falls short in transaction speed and efficiency. These conventional systems can handle thousands of transactions per second, while Ethereum\u2019s current structure allows for about 30. This disparity highlights the need for significant improvements if Ethereum aims to compete with or replace traditional systems.\n\nEthereum 2.0 \u2013 A Beacon of Hope\n\nEthereum 2.0 marks a fundamental shift in the Ethereum network\u2019s architecture, aiming to address the scalability, security, and sustainability issues currently limiting its predecessor. This ambitious upgrade stands as a beacon of hope for developers, investors, and users who believe in Ethereum\u2019s potential. Let\u2019s dissect what Ethereum 2.0 entails and why it\u2019s considered the much-needed next phase for this blockchain platform.\n\nThe Transition to Proof of Stake (PoS):\n\nOne of the most significant changes in Ethereum 2.0 is the shift from the energy-intensive Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism to Proof of Stake (PoS). Unlike PoW, which requires massive computational work and energy, PoS secures the network and validates transactions based on how many coins participants are holding and willing to \u201cstake\u201d for the process. This not only dramatically reduces the energy requirement but also incentivizes users to maintain network security.\n\nShard Chains and Scalability:\n\nTo tackle scalability, Ethereum 2.0 introduces shard chains, which are smaller chains that run parallel to the main Ethereum chain. Each shard chain handles its own transactions and smart contracts, meaning the network can process several transactions simultaneously, significantly increasing its capacity. This parallel processing power could potentially propel Ethereum\u2019s transaction throughput to match or even surpass traditional financial networks.\n\nThe Beacon Chain \u2013 Coordination at its Core:\n\nThe Beacon Chain is a central part of Ethereum 2.0, coordinating the network, keeping track of validators, and ensuring smooth communication between shard chains. It employs PoS to select validators responsible for storing data, processing transactions, and adding new blocks to the chain. This foundational layer is crucial for the new Ethereum\u2019s functionality and efficiency.\n\nEnhanced Security:\n\nWith Ethereum 2.0, security is set to improve. The PoS model decreases the likelihood of attacks on the network, as it makes potential attacks exceedingly expensive to carry out. The more decentralized nature of PoS, coupled with the new shard chain architecture, also contributes to a more secure network.\n\nSustainability and Energy Efficiency:\n\nBy abandoning the PoW mechanism, Ethereum 2.0 will significantly reduce its environmental impact. The new PoS system requires far less electricity, addressing one of the most urgent criticisms of cryptocurrency networks and aligning with growing demands for sustainable and eco-friendly technology.\n\nConclusion : Ethereum\u2019s Path Forward: Overcoming Challenges and Embracing Potential\n\nEthereum has problems like limited capacity and high energy use, with competition from other systems. Yet, with Ethereum 2.0, it\u2019ll use less energy and handle more transactions faster.\n\nIts large community, role in DeFi, and leadership in NFTs suggest it\u2019s here for the long haul. It\u2019s hard to know the future in the rapid world of digital money, but Ethereum adapts well and remains strong.\n\nIts continuous updates, diverse user trust, and importance indicate that Ethereum is a lasting part of blockchain\u2019s growth, not a passing phase."

The team also plans to continue using Scroll Sepolia as a testing ground for all upgrades to the Mainnet.\n\nScroll joins a growing list of zkEVM scaling solutions that launched this year, including Polygon\u2019s zkEVM and Matter Labs\u2019 zkSync Era. The scaling solutions essentially provide lower transaction costs at higher throughput by batching transactions together off-chain.\n\nOptimistic rollups, like those offered by Arbitrum and OP Labs, also offer similar functionality to scale Ethereum-based applications but differ from zk rollups in their inherent design.\n\nFor instance, optimistic rollups can run smart contracts on the main blockchain directly, while zk rollups are unable to do so. However, zk rollups don\u2019t require cryptographic validity proofs and hence eliminate the waiting periods during which transaction validity may be challenged on an optimistic rollup.\n\nEthereum cofounder Vitalik Buterin said at an ETH Seoul event that he believes zk rollups will eventually surpass optimistic rollups for this reason, although he acknowledged that the zk technology is still more complicated to build."

        "content": "The crypto market is witnessing high volatility this week as the market participants remain uncertain regarding the updates of Bitcoin spot ETH. As a result, the ETH price recovery from $1530 support has started experiencing notable supply pressure around the $1600 mark. Will the failed excitement lead to further correction in Ethereum?\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum L2 Scroll Mainnet Launch Marks Milestone in Ethereum Scalability\n\nadvertisement\n\nShould you Buy at $1500 Support?\n\nA bullish divergence in the momentum indicator RSI indicates the accelerating buying pressure at the $1500 mark\n\nAn upside breakout from the $1745 resistance would set a new recovery cycle in ETH\n\nThe intraday trading volume in Ether is $4.6 Billion, indicating a 17% loss.\n\nSource- Tradingview\n\nOver the last two months, the Ethereum price has been largely confined to a sideways trend, bounded by $1745 and $1630. Despite the coin making noteworthy price swings within this range, there has been no decisive move in either direction.\n\nThe attempted recovery that began on October 13th, originating from the range support at $1533, faced immediate supply pressure around $1600, stopping the coin\u2019s upward trajectory mid-way. This stalled recovery points towards a likely retest of the $1530 support level and potentially even the lower trendlines of a rising wedge pattern that has been leading ETH\u2019s price movement for the past 16 months.\n\nThus, the ETH price potential retest to the lower trendline could increase the demand pressure needed by buyers to escape the current consolidation. An upside breakout from the overhead resistance of $1745 would give an additional confirmation for traders to go bullish.\n\nIs ETH Price At Risk Of Further Fall?\n\nIn the daily time frame, the ETH price action is governed by the rising wedge formation. As long as the two trendlines defining this setup remain intact, this coin may sustain its upward trajectory, serving as a dynamic support zone for buyers during market corrections. However, if we consider a more pessimistic scenario, a breakdown below this lower boundary could spell the onset of a major correction in the Ethereum coin.\n\nRelative Strength Index. The daily RSI slope rise reflects the buyers\u2019 increasing accumulation at the $1500 mark.\n\nBollinger Band.

        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction as ETH Drops Below $1,700 \u2013 Will ETH Keep Falling?\n\nSource: TradingView\n\nThe Ethereum price has dipped by 1% today, with its fall to $1,653 coming amid a similar loss for the cryptocurrency market as a whole.\n\nETH is now down by 2% in a week and by 10% in the last 30 days, with the market\u2019s biggest altcoin remaining up by 38% since the beginning of the year.\n\nGiven the uncertain state of the wider market (especially in relation to ongoing regulatory actions), it remains possible that ETH could slip a little further in the coming days, especially when it has recently fallen below the key support levels of $1,800 and then $1,700.\n\nHowever, ETH\u2019s solid fundamentals will ultimately translate into a recovery somewhere down the line, especially when Ethereum continues to attract more adoption than the vast majority of its rivals.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction as ETH Drops Below $1,700 \u2013 Will ETH Keep Falling?\n\nEthereum now looks very close to hitting a bottom, with its indicators running out of space to fall and looking as though they could turn positive at any minute.\n\nSource: TradingView\n\nMost notably, the coin\u2019s 30-day moving average (yellow) has dropped below its 200-day average (blue), forming a \u2018death cross\u2019 that can signal more losses in the short-term.\n\nHowever, such a cross is often a necessary precondition of any significant rebound and recovery, with ETH\u2019s relative strength index (purple) also in a low position that should lead to fresh rallies anytime soon.\n\nSuch rallies may not follow immediately, however, sine ETH\u2019s support level (green) has repeatedly failed to hold up against repeated selling pressure, having dropped below the all-important $1,800 last week\n\nThis fall below $1,800 created a weakness that resulted in ETH then dropping below $1,700, implying that it may also struggle to resist a fall below $1,600."

        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction \u2013 Can ETH Hit $10,000 in the Next Bull Market?\n\nEthereum (ETH) has had a challenging time recovering in the bear market of 2022, with multiple unsuccessful attempts to reach highs above $2,000 since its decline to $879 in June. However, the current bullish green candle may indicate that Ethereum is finding support from a triangle pattern as outlined in Wednesday\u2019s article.\n\nEthereum is currently being traded at $1,197 as investors consider which cryptocurrencies to include in their portfolios for 2023. A break above the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $1,255 could potentially attract more buyers to the market.\n\nETH/USD daily chart\n\nFor now, Ethereum\u2019s price must prove to investors that it can hold above immediate resistance at $1,200 and keep off declines to $1,100 and $1,000. Analysts seem to be having conflicting predictions for 2023, with some forecasting a sideways trend and the most bullish hoping to see the Ethereum price above $4,000 by the end of 2023.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction: $10,000 ETH Incoming?\n\nEthereum is a renowned blockchain platform that has revolutionized the cryptocurrency space, with the introduction of smart contracts in 2015.\n\nThe second-largest cryptocurrency\u2019s utility continues to grow exponentially, especially with the transition to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. According to the author of Cryptocurrency Investing For Dummies, Kiana Danial, Ethereum\u2019s value could be attributed to the problems it solves.\n\n\u201cEthereum is valuable because of the problem that it solves, because of the size of its platform, and the number of people who use it to create their own apps.\u201d\n\nIt is difficult to visualize how vast the Ethereum ecosystem is until you learn that the blockchain platform holds over 44 million smart contracts.\n\nThe highly anticipated Shanghai upgrade in Q1 2023 will introduce mechanisms to bring down gas fees and support scaling through the sharding technology.\n\nAs well as this, Ethereum reached more than 200 million unique addresses this week, according to Etherscan.\n\nThe stats above show how valuable the Ethereum platform is and affirm the potential for a spike to $10,000.\n\nIndeed, just last week, a Bloomberg analyst predicted that ETH would outperform BTC in 2023 due to its fundamentals.\n\nWhat Would Take Ethereum Price to Hit $10,000?\n\nEthereum price has been facing a steep uphill battle in its efforts to break free from the dominant bearish trend that has persisted throughout 2022.\n\nMany analysts believe that it is next to impossible for the cryptocurrency to reach $10,000 within the next 12 months. However, it is important to remember that anything is possible in the world of cryptocurrency.\n\nCurrently, Ethereum is attempting to lift itself above the $1,200 mark and the 50-day Exponential Moving Average. It is worth noting that Ether has fallen more than 75% from its all-time high of $4,878 in November 2021, meaning that it would need to experience a bullish move of around 700% to reach the $10,000 mark.\n\nWhile this may seem unlikely, it is worth noting that Ethereum has experienced gains of more than 700% several times in the past. For example, in the last cycle, Ethereum went from around $80 to $4,800.\n\nThe current macroeconomic conditions and the dynamics of the cryptocurrency market are different from those of 2021 and 2017, making it difficult to predict whether Ethereum will be able to rise against the odds and reach $10,000.\n\nHowever, the important upcoming upgrades to Ethereum have the potential to significantly improve the network\u2019s scalability and capacity. If these upgrades go well, then strong bullish momentum may return to ETH and see it hitting $10,000 and above in the coming years.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nIs Ethereum price able to hit $10,000 by the end of 2023? Yes. But it is unlikely.\n\nThe Shanghai upgrade in Q1 2023 will have a positive impact on ETH prices if it goes well.\n\nInvestors are to get access to staked ETH for the first time in Q1 2023.\n\nEthereum developers to start working toward sharding with the Shanghai upgrade.\n\nPromising Altcoins to Consider for 2023\n\nCrypto markets are in a downtrend, but new altcoins with promising outlooks and presale early bird access may help investors recoup losses from the crypto winter. Here are some coins with huge potential in 2023.\n\nFightOut (FGHT) \u2013 Presale Launches\n\nFightOut, a brand-new move-to-earn (M2E) fitness application and gym chain that seeks to bring the fitness lifestyle into web3, has opened its pre-sale and investors think the project could transform the existing web3 M2E landscape.\n\nWhile existing M2E applications such as STEPN only track steps and require expensive non-fungible token (NFT) buy-ins to take part, FightOut takes a more holistic approach to tracking and rewarding its users for their exercise and activity, and doesn\u2019t require any expensive buy-ins to take part.\n\nFightOut\u2019s FGHT tokens are currently selling for 60.06 per 1 USDT, and interested investors are encouraged to move fast to secure their tokens, with the pre-sale having already raised nearly $2.45 million in just a few days. FGHT is the token that will power the FightOut crypto ecosystem.\n\nVisit FightOut Now\n\nDash 2 Trade (D2T) \u2013 Presale Enters Final Stage\n\nThose interested in investing in a promising crypto trading platform start-up should look no further than Dash 2 Trade. The up-and-coming analytics and social trading platform hopes to take the crypto trading space by storm with its host of unique features.\n\nThese include trading signals, social sentiment and on-chain indicators, a pre-sale token scoring system, a token listing alert system and a strategy back-testing tool. Dash 2 Trade\u2019s ecosystem will be powered by the D2T token, which users will need to buy and hold in order to access the platform\u2019s features.\n\nDash 2 Trade is currently conducting a token pre-sale at highly discounted rates and sales recently surpassed $11.2 million. The pre-sale dashboard is going to be released soon, with the development team currently running ahead of schedule. Tokens are currently selling for $0.0533 each and will be listed on multiple centralized exchanges in under one month.\n\nVisit Dash 2 Trade here\n\nC+Charge (CCHG)\n\nThe current electric vehicle (EV) charging system is inadequate maid issues such as lack of standardization. On the other hand, the carbon credits industry, which is projected to be worth $2.44 trillion by 2027 is dominated by big corporations like Tesla, locking out individuals who drive EVs.\n\nHowever, C+Charge hopes to drastically change the narrative by building a blockchain-based Peer-to-Peer (P2P) payment system for EV charging stations that will allow the drivers of electric vehicles (EVs) to earn carbon credits.\n\nUsers on C+Charge will be able to pay to charge their vehicles with CCHG, the token powering the ecosystem and earn carbon credits \u2013 stored in an app. C+Charge presale launched recently with $37k raised so far. Investors can buy 1 CCHG for 0.013 USDT, but the price will soon shoot to $0.0165 USDT.\n\nVisit C+Charge Now.\n\nRelated Articles"

        "content": "Demand for Ethereum Staking has Dropped Significantly \u2013 What\u2019s Going On?\n\nSource: Adobe\n\nEthereum (ETH), the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency, is experiencing a notable drop in demand for staking, leading to the clearing out of its once-crowded validator queue.\n\nEthereum\u2019s transition to a proof-of-stake (PoS) network, marked by the \u201cShapella\u201d upgrade in April, had sparked significant interest in staking, with a peak of over 96,000 validators waiting to join the network in early June.\n\nHowever, data now shows just 257 validators in the queue, marking the lowest count since the transition to PoS.\n\nSource: Validatorqueue.com\n\nThe reduction in queue size has led to a significant decrease in the waiting time to become a validator, down to less than five hours.\n\nSource: Validatorqueue.com\n\nSeveral factors behind reduction in staking demand\n\nThe decline in demand for Ethereum staking can be attributed to several factors, according to analysts that commented on CoinDesk.\n\nNotably, staking rewards have dropped from 5%-6% earlier this year to around 3.5%, primarily due to tepid network activity in generating fee-related revenues and an increasing number of stakers.\n\nWhat this means is that the returns on staking have become less attractive compared to other traditional investment options, such as money market funds and U.S. Treasury bills, which offer returns exceeding 5%.\n\nEthereum\u2019s staking ratio, which measures the proportion of tokens staked in the network relative to its total supply, has increased from 15% in April to over 22%.\n\nHowever, this figure still lags behind other PoS networks like Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), and Avalanche (AVAX).\n\nThe reason for this is that Ethereum\u2019s native token, ETH, is primarily used as a \u201cnetwork resource\u201d and because Ethereum has \u201ca more distributed shareholder base\u201d than the other networks, one analyst said."

        "content": "Here\u2019s Why Ethereum Price Can Reach $5k in 2023, and Love Hate Inu Will Raise $10 Million\n\nThe primary token in the world\u2019s largest smart contract ecosystem, Ethereum has topped $2,100 for the first time since May. Ethereum price blasted through resistance at $2,000 following a successful Shapella upgrade, previously referred to as Shanghai, on April 12.\n\nBoth Bitcoin and Ethereum have continued to surpass investor expectations since the beginning of the year and particularly after emerging stronger during the banking crisis in the United States.\n\nThree crypto-friendly banks collapsed in March including Silvergate Bank, Signature Bank, and Silicon Valley Bank (SVB). Since then, regulators have been on a sprint to provide oversight, a situation that is troubling many crypto-based companies that are unable to find banking partners.\n\nEthereum Price Doubles Down On the Uptrend\n\nEthereum price holds slightly above $2,100 on Saturday, with its uptrend mainly supported by the Shapella upgrade. A daily close above this level is required for bulls to maintain the lead relative to bearish advances.\n\nSuch a move coupled with the optimistic outlook from the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) implies that the path with the least resistance is to the upside.\n\nETH/USD daily chart\n\nCurrently, all eyes are glued on resistance at $2,000 because if broken, it would propel Ethereum price to $2,400, or higher.\n\nThe hype around the beginning of a bull market is driving investors into the market in droves. Often this fear of missing out (FOMO) helps to build momentum during up-trending markets.\n\nCan Ethereum Reach $5,000 in 2023\n\nEthereum price is suitably positioned to rally following its remarkable performance since the beginning of the year. This week\u2019s spike above $2,000 confirmed the initial stages of a bull market.\n\nIts older sibling, Bitcoin blasted above $30,000 changing the technical outlook for a potential rally to $38,000 in the coming few weeks. In addition to the momentum surrounding the Shapella upgrade, Ethereum price tends to follow in Bitcoin\u2019s footsteps.\n\nA massive rally in Ethereum price to $5,000 will only happen if many boxes are checked in the market in the coming months. For instance, Ether must hold the new support at $2,000 at all costs.\n\nHowever, this cannot be guaranteed even with a successful Shapella upgrade, which allowed investors who staked ETH to withdraw their tokens and the rewards earned, for the first time since the network transitioned to become a proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol.\n\nWhales must keep their bags intact if not keep demand for Ethereum rising. Another huge factor to consider is the regulatory landscape in the industry."

        "content": "Ethereum has long been the target of criticism from die-hard Bitcoin maximalists who believe that Bitcoin is the only worthwhile cryptocurrency despite the fact that Ethereum holds the second-highest percentage of the entire cryptocurrency market value.\n\nNow, another Bitcoin maximalist, Steve Barbour, has referred to the leading platform for smart contracts as garbage.\n\nBitcoin Maximalist Makes Controversial Claim About Ethereum\n\nIn a social media post on X, the prominent Bitcoin enthusiast recently called Ethereum \u201cgarbage\u201d and said it has no future. His argument essentially boils down to Ethereum failing to attract investors from the free market and nothing else.\n\nEthereum is garbage. The free market doesn\u2019t want it and the captured market still can\u2019t figure out what it is for. \u2014 Steve Barbour (@SGBarbour) October 16, 2023\n\nBarbour is the founder of Upstream Data, a mining infrastructure company building off-grid Bitcoin mining rigs. His claim comes behind the heels of Ethereum staking rewards falling to new lows.\n\nThe number of Ethereum in staking pools has been steadily growing over the past few months; however, this has not been accompanied by increased profitability. According to CoinGecko, liquid staking protocols accounted for 43.7% of the total 26.4 million ETH staked in August 2023.\n\nThe annual percentage yield (APY) from ETH staking has decreased over the years, going from 18% in 2020 to 3% in October. Since 2022, these protocols have paid out 100,000 ETH in quarterly incentives for staking, but the low APY has led many investors to question if staking ETH is still worthwhile.\n\nBarbour and other Bitcoin maximalists claim that Ethereum is not as decentralized as Bitcoin, particularly given that the blockchain has recently moved from proof-of-work to a proof-of-stake consensus process.\n\nMost of them believe that Bitcoin is the sole \u201ctrue\u201d cryptocurrency and that all other cryptocurrencies are worthless. Bitcoin maximalists have also been critical of other cryptocurrencies apart from Ethereum. Max Kaiser, another strong supporter of Bitcoin, has lately asserted that XRP is centralized.\n\nETH price remains firmly above $1,500 | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nResponses And Reactions\n\nEthereum has proven itself to be more than garbage, as evident in its vast number of supporters and large ecosystem.

It\u2019s full of speculators \u2014 Carnival_Poe (@Carnival_Poe) October 17, 2023\n\nThe free market has Ethereum now at $1,550. ETH has witnessed a 1.65% drop in price in the past 24 hours, and it continues to stay weaker against Bitcoin.\n\nOn the other hand, Bitcoin has increased in dominance against altcoins. Most of the money and attention has flowed into Bitcoin, and the crypto has witnessed a 6.39% increase in the past seven days.\n\nAs a result, ETH bulls have struggled to push above $1,600 and the crypto is now trading around the $1,550 support zone. If bulls fail to hold this level, it could start another decline to as low as $1,430.\n\nFeatured image from Forbes, chart from Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nEthereum cofounder Vitalik Buterin has shared new revelations that show a possible integration with artificial intelligence (AI) in the mid- to long term. Responding to community members in an ask-me-anything (AMA) session hosted on the decentralized social protocol Warpcast, Buterin said AI remains one of the thoughts that has filled his mind for the past two weeks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile Vitalik Buterin was not detailed about the specific things he thought about, he said he is considering the ways in which the Ethereum community could productively engage on AI-related issues. Some of the issues he highlighted include X-risk, a concept that showcases how humanity can be harmed on a massive global scale.\n\nIn recent times, proponents have been citing how possible Blockchain technology can coexist with AI. Drawing on the revolutionary technology underpinning both concepts, a combination of AI and blockchain has been tipped as a futuristic solution to some of the world's biggest challenges to date.\n\nWhile there are a number of crypto projects exploring AI solutions to date, Buterin's assertion of the concept lends another perspective, considering the role he plays in the broader digital currency ecosystem. The possible timeline of any potential engagement was not revealed, and from his actions, we might expect a detailed blog post in this regard in the future.\n\nGrowth of AI-based projects\n\nSome of the blockchain protocols pioneering AI initiatives include Cardano-backed SingularityNET and Render Network, to mention a few.\n\nThe value propositions for these projects differ, and while SingularityNET is building the first decentralized AI network that allows anyone to create, share and monetize AI services at scale, Render is a distributed GPU rendering network that connects artists and studios in need of GPU compute powers with mining partners.\n\nBoth protocols maintain a very robust token economy, and their growth over time highlights growing interest in AI-focused crypto projects."

        "title": "Ether Could Be Ready to Start an Epic Run - ETF Trends",
        "content": "Some investors are rightfully pensive about employing a buy-and-hold approach when it comes to cryptocurrencies. Even when it comes to the largest members of the asset class, bitcoin and ethereum.\n\nCrypto is a notoriously volatile space. That can be unnerving for market participants who can\u2019t or simply don\u2019t want to actively monitor positions. Despite the turbulence so frequently associated with digital currencies, the best gains are accrued over long holding periods. And that could prove to be true with ethereum \u2013 the second-largest digital currency by market value behind bitcoin.\n\nEthereum, the platform for the cryptocurrency known as ether, could be in for massive long-term upside and that could highlight opportunity with the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE). ETHE, which debuted four and a half years ago, follows the CoinDesk Ether Price Index. And it is structured as an index fund.\n\nEther Excellent Opportunities\n\nAs of midday Tuesday, ether traded around $1,564 per token. It also sported a market value of $188 billion, or more than double that of Tether, the third-largest digital currency. Some crypto market observers believe ether could notch a more than fivefold increase over the next few years before embarking upon an even more exponential upside. This would would likely spell good news for ETHE.\n\nIn a recent report to clients, Standard Chartered cryptocurrency analyst Geoff Kendrick notes ether could ascend to $8,000 by the end of 2026.\n\n\u201cWe think Ethereum\u2019s established dominance in smart contract platforms, along with emerging uses in gaming and tokenization, has the potential to push ETH to the $8,000 level by end-2026,\u201d observed the analyst.\n\nOf note to investors considering ETHE, that forecast is s \u201ca stepping stone to our long-term \u2018structural\u2019 valuation estimate of $26,000-$35,000,\u201d added Kendrick.\n\nAlso important to market participants is that the digital currency\u2019s projected upside is rooted in fundamentals. This includes the expanding usage cases for what\u2019s known as \u201clayer 2\u201d solutions. Layer 2 solutions are rooted in the ethereum platform and are designed to bolster efficiencies. When those efficiencies are realized, more transactions will stay on the ethereum network, potentially boosting ether\u2019s price in the process.\n\n\u201cLayer 2 scaling solutions \u2026 are likely to grow in importance over time. Particularly as architecture upgrades expected in early 2024 sharply lower fees on these platforms. This should help to cement ETH\u2019s dominance in the smart contract space, thereby increasing its P/E ratio (if not its earnings) over the next couple of years,\u201d noted the Standard Chartered analyst."

Just given what I know about demand and given what I know about the cycle and where the miners are, and so forth, and plus, we may get some interest rate relief. That\u2019s a 3x bump. That\u2019s happened in the world of technology all over the place, so it certainly could happen to Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nBitcoin\u2019s next halving event, when miners\u2019 rewards cut in half, therefore reducing new supply, is expected to happen in April 2024.\n\nBitcoin is trading for $28,472 at the of writing.\n\nNext, Scaramucci says ETH could soar by more than 185% from its current value in the six to 12 months following BTC\u2019s halving event.\n\n\u201cEthereum, I am not as close to, although we do have a position in it. Could Ethereum be $4,500 by then? Why not? You know it\u2019s a great utility. Speeds have improved. The layer-2s have helped it. Why not? Why couldn\u2019t it be $4,500? These things are maturing.\u201d\n\nEthereum is worth $1,576 at time of writing.\n\nLastly, the trader weighs in on smart contract platform Algorand (ALGO). He predicts it could increase by more than 200% from its current value.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m bullish. I thought at $1 it could have easily gotten to $5. I\u2019ve gotten this wrong. The thing is trading at $0.09 or $0.10\u2026\n\nBut could Algorand from here \u2013 because we can only price ourselves today, we can\u2019t go back into the past \u2013 could it be a $0.30 token as they continue their development and continue the adoption of what they\u2019re doing and bringing in corporations that love the technology?

        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction as ETH Rallies Above $1,600 \u2013 Can ETH Reach $10,000 in 2023?\n\nThe value of the largest smart contracts platform, Ethereum continues to gain strength against the US dollar, especially with its recent move above $1,600. Recovery is expected to continue after the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting and decision on the interest rate hike in two days.\n\nExperts say that cryptos may generally retreat before then, thus shaking out weak hangs before carrying on with the bullish move aiming for highs above $2,000. Ethereum price had pulled back to trade at $1,594 at the time of writing with support around $1,500 expected to absorb the growing selling pressure.\n\nEthereum Price Primed for A Massive Breakout \u2013 Here\u2019re the Levels to Watch\n\nInvestors are anxiously waiting for the Federal Reserve decision on interest rate hikes and expect the regulator to continue with its strict measures to curb economic growth. However, market watchers are eyeing a 25-basis points increase, relatively lower than the December hike of 50-basis points.\n\nThis positive sentiment hails from a general inflation drop for December to 6.5% from 7.1% recorded for November. Although the drop is not big enough to see the Fed lift the foot off the gas pedal completely, it signals that the economy is headed in the right direction.\n\nCPI is an indicator for the Fed to either tighten its monetary measures used to combat inflation or loosen its grip \u2013 allowing markets to recover, especially those considered to have a high volatility index like digital assets.\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum price is still in a position to break out significantly despite the resistance at $1,680. Since the tentative support at $1,600 has already been infiltrated, ETH price might be forced to look down to $1,500 before the resumption of its uptrend. Based on the daily timeframe chart, the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) (in purple) solidifies support in that area.\n\nETH/USD daily chart\n\nAdding credence to the short-term bearish outlook in Ethereum price is a buy signal from the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator. The MACD line in blue confirmed the call to traders to offload their bags while locking in profits (shaking off weak hands) by flipping beneath the signal line in blue.\n\nDoctor Profit, analyst and trader on Twitter shared with his large following on Twitter that \u201cweak hands are getting shaken out, market awaits FOMC in two days.\u201d The analyst terms the pullback a \u201cfake dumb\u201d meant to \u201cshake out weak hands\u201d ahead of the next breakout in a few days."

It recently fell below the $1,200 level despite last week\u2019s positive price movements. There is a risk of it falling below the support level of a triangle pattern.\n\nIn the past 24 hours, trading volume for Ethereum increased by 23% to $4.5 billion. The cryptocurrency\u2019s market cap is $146 billion, having declined by 2% in the same time period.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction: How 2023 Could Be a Big Year For ETH\n\nEthereum has had a difficult year, with its value dropping 70.4% in one year and 75.5% from its all-time high.\n\nHowever, according to a popular crypto analyst, Guy of Coin Bureau, next year could be an exceptional year for the largest smart contracts token.\n\nGuy believes that the upcoming Ethereum Shanghai upgrade scheduled for Q1 2023 could lead to a bullish trend reversal for Ether. The analyst believes that the unlocking of billions of dollars worth of tokens from smart contracts will attract investors to stake their own tokens for a potentially stress-free investment experience.\n\n\u201cWhen they see that that ETH can in fact be unstaked and easily sold, then it might incentivize them to actually stake themselves. So, I really think it could go either way. Now, I wouldn\u2019t at all be surprised if it was slightly bearish in the short term if we do see some selling,\u201d said Guy in his Q&A video.\n\n\u201cI think the future for ETH is so, so bright, and I think Shanghai, assuming it goes off without a hitch as the Merge did, then I think 2023 could be a really big year for Ethereum and for ETH,\u201d Guy continued.\n\nAccording to a crypto expert, it is unlikely that Ethereum will reach five digits in 2023. Instead, Guy predicts a sideways trend for the cryptocurrency during the year.\n\nSimilarly, Rekt Capital, a pseudonymous crypto trader and analyst, told their 330k followers on Twitter that the Ethereum price must hold support at $1,062 to avert a possible drop to $843."

        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction as $6 Billion Trading Volume Rushes In \u2013 Are Whales Buying?\n\nSource: TradingView\n\nThe price of Ethereum (ETH) has dropped by 1% in the past 24 hours, slipping to $1,805 as the cryptocurrency market suffers a similar 1% dip.\n\nETH has risen by 2.5% in the past week but is down by 9% in the last 30 days, although the second-biggest cryptocurrency has also gained by 50% since the beginning of the year.\n\nIts movements come as its 24-hour trading volume raises slightly above $6 billion, suggesting a gradual increase in liquidity that could result in significant rises somewhere down the line.\n\nThis is also suggested by data on large whale transfers of ETH, which may combine with Ethereum\u2019s strong fundamentals to cause a big rally sooner or later.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction as $6 Billion Trading Volume Rushes In \u2013 Are Whales Buying?\n\nDespite today\u2019s slip, ETH\u2019s indicators are in a position that suggests the altcoin may recover soon enough.\n\nSource: TradingView\n\nAfter a fall towards 20 and fully oversold territory, ETH\u2019s relative strength index (purple) has begun rising again and has just crossed 50, signaling that it has begun regaining some positive momentum.\n\nAt the same time, the coin\u2019s price is just about to climb over its 30-day (yellow) and 200-day (blue) moving average, something which also points towards growing buying pressure.\n\nTaken together, these two changes suggest that ETH is likely to recover soon, as does the aforementioned increase in its trading volume, although it should be noted that $6 billion is still some way below the peaks of $16 billion seen in April and $60 billion in March.\n\nAt the moment, it does seem that whales have mostly been preparing to sell ETH, at least based on recent big transfers."

        "title": "What are zk-rollups? Solving Ethereum's scalability issue - crypto.news",
        "content": "Zero-knowledge rollups (zk-rollups), a new scaling solution, can significantly boost a blockchain\u2019s throughput and lower transaction costs. This is achieved by moving computation and data storage off the main blockchain. Learn how zk-rollups work and which projects use them.\n\nZk-rollups are layer-2 protocols built on Ethereum that batch hundreds of transactions off-chain and generate cryptographic proofs that certify the validity of those transactions. Instead of posting transaction data on-chain, zk-rollups submit only these succinct proofs to verify the transactions are correct.\n\nThis allows the blockchain\u2019s capacity to increase exponentially while ensuring users can still benefit from the blockchain\u2019s security. Zk-rollups can process thousands of transactions per second at a fraction of the cost compared to transacting directly on-chain.\n\nYou might also like: Layer 2 projects experiencing a boom after The Merge\n\nHow ZK-rollups work\n\nZk-rollups have an on-chain component that holds funds and tracks account balances. Still, the actual execution of transactions occurs on a separate computational layer.\n\nNodes called operators collect transactions submitted by users, aggregate them into batches, and execute the transactions on an off-chain virtual machine. The operators then generate a cryptographic proof called a validity proof that mathematically guarantees the new state updates result from correctly executing all transactions in the batch.\n\nThese proofs are submitted to a smart contract on-chain along with the latest state of accounts on the zk-rollup. The contract verifies the proof is valid, ensuring the transactions were executed properly off-chain. If valid, the contract updates its state to match the zk-rollup\u2019s.\n\nThis allows transactions in zk-rollups to be finalized instantly once proofs are verified on-chain. Users can also withdraw funds from the rollup anytime without having to wait for security challenges.\n\nYou might also like: Ethereum scalability battle heats up with multiple zkEVM projects\n\nThe key benefits of zk-rollups\n\nScalability: Zk-rollups provide orders of magnitude improvements in transaction throughput because validity proofs are much smaller than full transaction data. Thousands of transactions can be compressed into a proof just a few hundred bytes large. This is possible because zero-knowledge proofs do not have to contain the data to prove it.\n\nSecurity: Zk-rollups inherit the native blockchain\u2019s security guarantees and transaction finality. Validity proofs prevent operators from executing invalid state transitions off-chain. Furthermore, data availability on-chain allows anyone to reconstruct the zk-rollup\u2019s state.\n\nLow costs: Withdrawing funds from zk-rollups is seamless and cheap since transactions rely solely on proof verification, not fraud challenges. Users could also benefit from greatly reduced transaction fees thanks to compression efficiency.\n\nNo liveness assumptions: Zk-rollups are immune to denial-of-service attacks that delay transactions since proofs enforce correct state transitions. Users don\u2019t have to monitor the network to protect funds.\n\nDisadvantages of zk-rollups\n\nZk-rollups have higher computational costs than other solutions like Optimistic Rollups because calculating zero-knowledge proofs is computationally intensive. They have complex cryptographic and engineering framework. As a result, they prove to be costlier and more challenging to implement.\n\nZk-rollup projects\n\nWhich cryptos use ZK-rollups? Various teams are pushing forward the development and adoption of ZK-rollup technology across Ethereum layer-2 scaling solutions and decentralized applications. Scaling Ethereum is what most of those projects focus on, despite some arguing that such as system can bring even more to the table when it comes to Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nPolygon (MATIC) has emerged as one of the most popular zk-rollup solutions. It uses recursive SNARK proofs to bundle transactions with low costs. Polygon also offers EVM compatibility, allowing developers to migrate the Solidity smart contracts used on Ethereum and Ethereum-like blockchains with minimal changes. The network\u2019s growing ecosystem now includes over 7,000 dApps.\n\nYou might also like: Polygon to replace MATIC with POL token\n\nPowered by Cairo language and STARK-proof technology from Starkware, several efficient zk-rollup projects, such as dYdX, operate. Starkware, founded by Eli Ben-Sasson and Alessandro Chiesa, facilitates the development of rollups with developer-friendly APIs and services for exchanges and NFT platforms.\n\nZK-Sync, by Matter Labs, extends full EVM and Solidity support to zk-rollups. With SNARK proofs and emphasis on Ethereum interoperability, it forms a smooth link to layer-2. DeFi apps such as Aave, Yearn.Finance, and 1Inch Network are prominent adopters of ZK-Sync.\n\nLoopring (LRC) presents a decentralized exchange protocol designed for high-volume trading. Its architecture reduces slippage and fees. Loopring\u2019s zkRollup exchange played a pioneering role in Ethereum layer-2 adoption, and it currently supports GameStop\u2019s NFT marketplace.\n\nYou might also like: Loopring Quarterly Report Shows Promising Results in Trading Volume and NFTs Minted\n\nMetaMask, a leading wallet provider, is instrumental in facilitating ZK-rollup use by integrating platforms like Polygon and Loopring. It also enables effortless access to dApps across layers 1 and 2. MetaMask\u2019s endorsement could further promote the adoption of ZK-rollup-based transactions.\n\nWhat is ZkEVM and why build it\n\nSeveral teams are developing zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machines (zkEVMs), a technology that brings compatibility of smart contracts and the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) to zk-rollups.\n\nIn simple terms, a zkEVM enables Ethereum transactions and smart contracts to function with cryptographic proof of validity. This innovation could combine the security and features of the EVM with the scalability offered by zk-rollups.\n\nNotable projects working on zkEVM include Applied ZKP, supported by the Ethereum Foundation, Polygon zkEVM, Scroll, Taiko, and ZKSync. Though each has a unique approach, they all aim to create a decentralized zkEVM capable of managing complicated Ethereum transactions using zero-knowledge proofs.\n\nShould a zkEVM layer-2 become fully operational, it would mark a significant step forward for Ethereum scalability. It would allow developers to use existing tools while benefiting from the high transaction speed and low costs associated with zk-rollups. The success of zkEVM initiatives could hasten the uptake of layer-2 solutions in applications based on Ethereum.\n\nZk-rollups vs optimistic rollups\n\nZk-rollups and Optimistic Rollups are two methods designed to enhance Ethereum\u2019s efficiency, but they use different tactics. Zk-rollups bundle many transactions off-chain and use zero-knowledge proofs to verify their validity before submitting them to the blockchain. This process heightens scalability and lowers costs, despite its high computational requirements. Instant transaction finality, a feature of zk-rollups, eliminates the need for fraud proofs.\n\nOptimistic Rollups, on the other hand, presume transactions are correct. They improve scalability by submitting minimal data to the chain and only produce fraud proofs if they spot invalid transactions. However, transaction finality is delayed until the fraud-proof challenge period ends. Despite having lower costs than zk-rollups, Optimistic Rollups do not require validity proofs for every transaction.\n\nWhile Optimistic Rollups may see quicker adoption in the short-term, zk-rollups offer better privacy and security safeguards. Both solutions aim to significantly increase Ethereum\u2019s transaction processing speed, reduce fees, and improve overall performance.\n\nZk-rollups and Optimistic Rollups are key technological advancements that will contribute to Ethereum\u2019s future growth. However, the choice between the two will depend on each application\u2019s specific needs.\n\nYou might also like: Ethereum\u2019s Dencun upgrade: the next major step in scalability\n\nThe path ahead\n\nZK-rollups require specialized knowledge to operate, so development is still early-stage. But the technology holds promise to help Ethereum reach tens of thousands of transactions per second.\n\nFuture research is focused on making zk-rollups more decentralized and creating Ethereum Virtual Machine compatibility. This would allow zk-rollups to seamlessly support Ethereum smart contracts and decentralized applications.\n\nAs zero-knowledge technology and tooling matures, zk-rollups are poised to become a vital component of Ethereum\u2019s long-term scaling roadmap. Widespread adoption could lead to faster, cheaper decentralized finance and web3 services for millions of users worldwide."

        "content": "Ethereum co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, has denied selling any Ethereum (ETH) for personal gain since 2018. In a Tuesday statement made on the decentralized social network Warpcast, Buterin addressed concerns about his recent cryptocurrency wallet activities, assuring his followers that the transactions were primarily related to charitable donations and covering expenses rather than personal profit.\n\n\u201cRegular reminder: If you see an article saying \u201cVitalik sends XXX ETH to [exchange]\u201d, it\u2019s not actually me selling, it\u2019s almost always me donating to some charity or nonprofit or other project, and the recipient selling because, well, they have to cover expenses. I haven\u2019t \u201csold\u201d ETH for personal gain since 2018,\u201d said Buterin. advertisement\n\nVitalik\u2019s Wallet Movements\n\nButerin\u2019s statement came as a response to growing speculation and concerns regarding his wallet\u2019s significant activity, which had drawn attention for various large-scale transactions involving ETH. Just recently, Blockchain analytics platform Spot On Chain reported that Buterin\u2019s wallet had been involved in a series of transactions throughout September 2023, amounting to over $3.9 million.\n\nAdditional deposits were made to Kraken, Bitstamp, and Paxos during the same period, further raising eyebrows in the crypto community. Spot On Chain also identified a transfer of 2,000 ETH ($4.9 million) from another wallet associated with Buterin to the address conducting these transactions. It\u2019s worth noting that these transactions weren\u2019t isolated incidents. Earlier this month, an address linked to Buterin, transferred 1,000 ETH tokens equivalent to around $1.64 million to Bitstamp, potentially for sale.\n\nThat said, the crypto community has been increasingly concerned about these transactions, fearing they might trigger a market sell-off. Some are worried that Vitalik Buterin\u2019s active selling indicates a lack of confidence in the Ethereum network, potentially undermining its credibility or raising suspicions of a rug pull.\n\nCharity Links\n\nHowever, to support Buterins Tuesday claims, Kanro, a charity affiliated with Buterin, has been actively involved in transferring funds. Kanro, which focuses on researching global solutions to epidemics, received $100 funding from Crypto Relief earlier this year, led by Polygon founder Sandeep, and Vitalik himself.\n\nThis month, Kanro moved a total of 15.43 million USDC to a multi-signature wallet. This included 500,000 USDC transferred to Coinbase on October 14 and a significant 14.93 million USDC sent to Gemini on October 16."

        "content": "Ethereum, the token fueling the world\u2019s leading smart contracts platform, is consolidating its position at $1,800, as it eagerly awaits the release of crucial economic data.\n\nThe Ethereum price experienced a remarkable surge in March, mirroring Bitcoin\u2019s performance, before encountering resistance at $1,850.\n\nWith the weekend just hours away, ETH trades at $1,807, displaying impressive resilience.\n\nMarket watchers anticipate potential volatility in response to Friday\u2019s Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) data release, particularly as US stock markets prepare to open.\n\nThe PCE is a key inflation indicator utilized by the Federal Reserve to make key monetary policy decisions.\n\nIs Ethereum Ready To Take Down Pivotal $2,000 Resistance?\n\nEthereum price remains barely unchanged in 24 hours, although Bitcoin has lost nearly 2% of its value to trade at $28,230 at the time of writing.\n\nIf support at $1,800 holds despite the PCE data, ETH price could strengthen its bullish outlook over the weekend and grind closer to the psychological resistance at $2,000.\n\nETH/USD daily chart\n\nThe second-largest token in the market holds above all the applied major moving averages, starting with the 100-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) (line in blue), which has just flipped above the 200-day EMA (line in purple)\u2014in a move that could validate the anticipated climb to $2,000.\n\nThe 50-day EMA (line in red) at $1,665 is in line to help mitigate the selling pressure in the event of a reversal below $1,700.\n\nOn the same daily chart, the position of the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) suggests the path with the least resistance is now to the upside.\n\nAlthough the MACD is yet to validate a buy signal on the daily timeframe chart, its position above the mean line implies a bullish outcome is highly likely.\n\nOn the four-hour timeframe, Ethereum price has printed a bullish engulfing candle, targeting short-term resistance at $1,850.\n\nLike the daily chart, ETH sits above all the major applied moving averages \u2013 the 50 EMA, 100-day EMA, and 200-day EMA.\n\nETH/USD four-hour chart\n\nThe On-Balance-Volume (OBV) indicator, which underlays the chart like the Relative Strength Index (RSI), while tracking the volume reinforces the bullish grip on Ether as it rebounds.\n\nTherefore, with inflow volume surpassing outflow volume, Ethereum has enough momentum to deal with resistance at $1,850.\n\nHolding above $1,800 on Thursday, assured investors Ethereum price is in an uptrend and is not ready to falter.\n\nThat said, the next and most important confirmation investors need is a break and hold above $1,850 to bring the subsequent hurdle at $2,000 within reach.\n\nIf push comes to shove and Ethereum bows to the seller congestion at $1,850, a retreat to $1,800 would provide fresh liquidity for another stronger rally to $2,000.\n\nThe Ethereum Shanghai Upgrade Is Happening\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation confirmed the Shanghai upgrade earlier in the week around mid-April. It is the second most important hard fork since the Merge in September, particularly among investors who locked ETH tokens in the Beacon Chain Smart Contract.\n\nRecently baptized Shapella, the Shanghai upgrade will see Ethereum unlock its full potential as a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus protocol, as validators will for the first time withdraw from the staking contracts.\n\n\u201cThere is much speculation about what the Shanghai hard fork will mean for the price action of ETH and related liquid staking derivatives (LSDs) such as Lido (LDO) and Rocket Pool (RPL). So far, we have seen large appreciations in the price for LSDs and related protocols,\u201d Bill Xing, head of financial products at Bybit said in an exclusive commentary to Cryptonews.\n\nLike many experts in the market, expects the volatility being experienced to \u201ccontinue leading up to and around the time the Shanghai upgrade is enacted, similar to the situation that unfolded around the time of The Merge in September 2022,\u201d Xing added.\n\nEthereum has been one of the biggest bullish contenders in the last few weeks. Unlike other altcoins, ETH has rallied alongside Bitcoin, allowing investors to hedge against the banking crisis in the US.\n\n\u201cWe expect it to continue to play an important role going forward, primarily if it can deliver what is promised on its roadmap,\u201d Xing said as he concluded his statement.\n\nHowever, the biggest challenge the Ethereum price faces at the moment is the risk associated with regulatory uncertainty in the US. If ETH can ignore the \u2018noise\u2019 it could ease into a substantial rally in 2023.\n\nBuy Ethereum Now\n\nRelated Articles:"

        "title": "Bitcoin is Digital Property, Ethereum is Digital Security - Argues Michael Saylor - Cryptonews",
        "content": "Bitcoin is Digital Property, Ethereum is Digital Security \u2013 Argues Michael Saylor\n\nMichael Saylor. Source: UpOnly / YouTube\n\nUS-based software developer MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor has once again questioned the regulatory status of ethereum (ETH), arguing that it can be best classified as digital security. On the other hand, he insisted that there is no doubt that bitcoin (BTC) is a digital property, and thus not subject to regulatory headaches.\n\nSaylor, who has appeared on a recent episode of the UpOnly podcast, said that the most important thing for a long-term crypto investor to understand is the political status of a cryptoasset \u2014 i.e., is it a cryptocurrency, a crypto property, or crypto security.\n\n\u201cAs far as I can see, Bitcoin is a crypto property and by property, it means it\u2019s viewed as a fair, common piece of property beyond the control of a company or a group of individuals,\u201d Saylor said, adding that it is pretty challenging to create a property.\n\nBitcoin was created by the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto, who released the original Bitcoin white paper in 2008. The coins are created through mining, which means there never was a pre-mine or an initial coin offering (ICO). Bitcoin uses the proof-of-work (PoW) mechanism, which is according to Saylor a \u201cfair distribution.\u201d\n\nPointing these out, Saylor claimed that bitcoin can be easily classified as digital property, saying:\n\n\u201cIt is pretty clear that of everything in the crypto universe the thing that is most likely to be deemed property in any given nation-state is Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nHowever, he classified every coin that enables staking or uses the proof-of-stake (PoS) mechanism as digital security.\n\n\u201cIt has been explicitly stated by the regulators if there is a stake and it generates yield it\u2019s an investment contract and an investment contract is a security,\u201d Saylor added.\n\nRecently, there have been some discussions that Ethereum is actually a security. That is because Ethereum was also originally funded through an ICO, which took place in 2014. At the time, users had the opportunity to exchange their BTC for ETH tokens, and more than 7m ETH tokens were sold in the first 12 hours.\n\nAccording to Saylor, the problem with securities is that they are in a regulatory gray zone. \u201cIn order for you to invest in [securites], you have to be willing to accept the securities risk, the legal risk, the competitive risk, and the literal cyber security risk,\u201d he said.\n\nThis partly explains why Saylor, a bitcoin maximalist, has stayed away from ethereum despite all the recent growth around decentralized finance (DeFi) or non-fungible tokens (NFTs) which are mainly built on Ethereum.\n\nNotably, Saylor\u2019s Microstrategy has continued its BTC buying spree despite all the volatility and dips. By the end of 2021, the company held approximately BTC 124,391, acquired at an aggregate purchase price of USD 3.75bn and an average purchase price of USD 30,159 per bitcoin, inclusive of fees and expenses, according to filings shared with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nAt 10:07 UTC, BTC is trading at USD 36,607. It\u2019s down 3% in a day and 12% in a week. ETH is changing hands at USD 2,444, having dropped 2% in a day and 21% in a week.\n\n____\n\nLearn more:\n\n\u2013 MicroStrategy to Keep Buying Bitcoin\n\n\u2013 MicroStrategy is Only HODLing Bitcoin, Says the CEO\n\n\n\n\u2013 Bitcoin Mining Energy Use \u2018Inconsequential,\u2019 \u2018Rapidly Becoming More Efficient\u2019 \u2013 Saylor\n\n\u2013 MicroStrategy\u2019s and Grayscale Bitcoin Trust\u2019s Shares Now Compete with ETFs\n\n\n\n\u2013 MicroStrategy Insider Sales Hint Executives May Lack CEO\u2019s Conviction\n\n\u2013 This Is How Musk\u2019s and Saylor\u2019s Tweets Steer Bitcoin Price"

        "title": "Ethereum Price Prediction as $7 Billion Trading Volume Rushes In \u2013 Are Whales Buying ETH? - Cryptonews",
        "content": "For the moment, Ethereum price teeters at $1,575 while bulls focus on dealing with resistance at $1,600. On the downside, support at $1,520 must be defended at all costs to avert possible declines to $1,445 and $1,400, respectively.\n\nOver $7 billion in trading volume has been recorded in the past 24 hours, although the ETH price has only changed by +0.15%. The sell-off in the market since the weekend has resulted in a drop in the token\u2019s market cap from $202 billion on January 29 to $192 billion.\n\nThe largest smart contracts token remains relatively stable despite the drop from January\u2019s high, roughly at $1,678. Investors have retreated to the sidelines, awaiting the Fed decision on a likely interest rate hike of 25 basis points. The first US FOMC meeting concluding later today would either keep New Year\u2019s crypto upswings steady, stifle recovery, or culminate in a short-term selloff.\n\nAccording to an analysis carried out by Lookonchain on how ETH reacted after eight FOMC meetings in 2022, investors can expect the Ethereum price to jump by up to 4.25% with 0.25% being the lowest expected change.\n\nEthereum price sits comfortably above critical support provided by the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) (in purple) at $1,517. However, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator has recently flaunted a sell signal, hinting at a longer trend correction in the coming days.\n\nETH/USD daily chart\n\nTraders must follow the position of the MACD line in blue as it builds a divergence below the signal line in red. Declines may intensify if the momentum indicator drops to the mean line and possibly revisits the negative region. The red histograms in the same indicator reinforce the growing bearish advances.\n\nAssessing The Bullish Outlook in Ethereum Price \u2013 Short Analysis\n\nThe Money Flow Index (MFI) on the same daily timeframe chart reveals that investors are ready to pump money into Ethereum markets. We can see the MFI bouncing off the midline in the neutral zone following a major dip from the higher range of the overbought region. As long as more volume is flowing in than Ether\u2019s total outflows, a trend rebound would be the most likely outcome.\n\nIn addition, to support provided by the 200-day EMA, the 50-day EMA (in red) has recently flipped above the 100-day EMA. Although not a golden cross pattern, which forms with the 50-day EMA moving above the 200-day EMA, it implies bulls hold the reins and Ethereum price will likely keep climbing.\n\nShort-term analysis based on the four-hour time frame chart shows Ethereum holding between the 100-day EMA (in blue) and the 50-day EMA (in red) to the upside. While the most popular smart contracts token is trading below the dotted trend line, its support at the 100-day EMA has been reinforced by the lower rising trend line, which means odds still favor a bullish outcome.\n\nETH/USD four-hour chart\n\nFollowing the fall from January\u2019s highs, Ethereum sunk into oversold conditions based on the Stochastic oscillator. However, recovery is already underway with bullish pressure gradually intensifying.\n\nTherefore, with a minor push above the 50-day EMA and the dotted rising trendline, Ethereum price would reignite its uptrend, aiming for $1,800 and $2,000, respectively. The MFI indicator upholds the positive picture, as seen in the daily time frame analysis.\n\nIt would be prudent to assess the possibility of an extended trend correction, especially if support at the 100-day EMA on the four-hour chart weakens. From here, Ethereum will be forced to look toward the 200-day EMA (purple) at $1,486 for support. If push comes to shove, declines might retest the next buyer congestion area at $1,400.\n\nCan This Upgrade Steady Ethereum Price Uptrend?\n\nThe Ethereum Merge upgrade set the ball rolling for many features expected on the proof-of-stake (Pos) blockchain, including Zhejiang \u2013 the staking testnet going live today. Users will for the first time, interact with the new staking protocol that allows the withdrawal of staked ETH.\n\nAccording to the testnet\u2019s developer, the Shanghai+Capella upgrade will be triggered in about six days from today. The testnet will allow developers to monitor the withdrawal process and other related services and resolve any potential issues that may arise."

        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction as Bulls Hold $1,500 Level \u2013 Can ETH Rally Soon?\n\nETH/USD daily chart\n\nETH, the cryptocurrency that holds the second-largest market cap, has remained steady by finding support at $1,500. Despite this, experts predict that a rebound is unlikely before the upcoming Shanghai hard fork.\n\nAt present, the price of Ethereum is hovering around $1,555, having experienced a decrease of 1% in the last 24 hours.\n\nInvestors who locked their ETH in the Beacon Chain smart contract to help the network transition from a proof-of-work (PoW) to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus algorithm are expected to withdraw the tokens when the Shanghai hard fork comes in early April.\n\nAnalysts appear conflicted over the impact of the much-awaited upgrade with some saying it would send Ethereum price above $2,000 while others foresee a further drop in price as stakers gain access to their ETH locked in the smart contract and start to sell.\n\nEthereum Price Wobbles Above $1,500 as Recession Fears Mount\n\nThe cryptocurrency market has remained in a precarious position for several weeks, even as Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell testified before the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday.\n\nPowell did not mince his words when he said that interest rates were most likely to rise and by a larger margin than expected by market watchers, citing extremely unfavorable economic data since the previous review in early February.\n\nThe crypto market is expected to feel the pinch, with bearish forces likely to be in control, as investors choose fixed-income products and the strengthening US dollar over other assets. Powell\u2019s remarks have been interpreted as a warning of a recession beckoning \u2013 if it is not already here.\n\nEthereum\u2019s price and the crypto market must also brave the tough stance from US regulatory agencies, which have vowed to increase oversight of the industry following the sudden collapse of FTX exchange in November.\n\nUS-based crypto firms are feeling the pressure \u2013 made worse by the recent revelation that crypto-friendly bank, Silvergate is evaluating its ability to stay in business.\n\nDissecting the Ethereum Price Short-Term Technical Outlook\n\nIn addition to the Ethereum price staying stable above $1,500, ETH holds onto support provided by the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $1,546 on the daily chart.\n\nThe price of ETH is facing challenges due to low liquidity and strong selling pressure at $1,569, which is reinforced by an upward trendline. The market is currently controlled by sellers, and it remains to be seen when this changes.\n\nETH/USD daily chart\n\nEthereum\u2019s price could drop further before a trend reversal ensues. Traders looking forward to booking long positions in ETH may want to wait until ETH consolidates at support and prepares for a leg up.\n\nFurthermore, the MACD\u2019s recent slide beneath the mean line at 0.00 hints at bears having the upper hand. In that case, support at the 200-day EMA must be protected at all costs. Otherwise, we could see Ethereum\u2019s price dropping to $1,400.\n\nAs per blockchain data presented by IntoTheBlock, around 18.69 million ETH addresses are currently at a loss.\n\nEthereum IOMAP model\n\nRetail investors may opt to sell their crypto assets and instead go for better-performing assets, even if it means taking a loss.\n\nAddresses in the money with unrealized profits are represented by small green circles on the chart, and if selling pressure increases, Ethereum price may fall to retest downstream levels at $1,400 and $1,338, respectively.\n\nThe large circle between $1,600 and $1,647 is where sellers are most concentrated and where bulls may face resistance as they push for an uptrend. If this area is overcome, ETH price could quickly rally up to $1,800 and $2,000.\n\nBuy Ethereum Now\n\nRelated Articles:"

Its zkEVM circuits were reviewed by Trail of Bits, Zellic and Kalos.\n\nAcross its three testnets, over 450,000 smart contracts were deployed, enabling over 90 million transactions across 9 million blocks. 280,000 ZK-proofs were also generated, the firm said.\n\nAbout a month ago, Scroll co-founder Ye Zhang told Cointelegraph Scroll would launch with centralized features but plans to increasingly decentralize over time.\n\n\u201cWe will have a centralized sequencer and the central approver button,\u201d Zhang said. He added that a plan is in place to remove that button, however.\n\n\u201cWe have a roadmap [...] To solve the single point of failure and to incentivize the community to build better proving hardware.\u201d\n\nZhang said the Scroll team will also pitch several proposals to let the community discuss what\u2019s best for Scroll moving forward.\n\nRelated: ConsenSys launches Linea zkEVM to further scale Ethereum\n\nScroll was founded in 2021 with the goal of being more community-driven. Other zkEVM solutions working to scale Ethereum include Polygon, zkSync, StarkWare and Immutable.\n\nJordi Baylina, technical lead of Polygon Hermez zkEVM, recently told Cointelegraph that such competition in the zkEVM space is only going to make the Ethereum ecosystem more robust.\n\n\u201cHaving different projects adds a lot of experience, and it\u2019s also a way to test different approaches, ways of handling things, or solving things,\u201d he said.\n\nMagazine: Attack of the zkEVMs!

The firm clarified that this fee would only be deducted from rewards generated by the Staking Activities.\n\nStaking is an integral part of the Ethereum blockchain network that involves committing at least 32 ETH to support the network for a set period to earn rewards. Ethereum\u2019s website describes the process as \u201ca public good\u201d that \u201ckeeps Ethereum secure for everyone.\u201d According to the website, ETH stakers will earn 3.5% rewards annually.\n\nData from Beaconscan shows that the total number of staked ETH has grown to 27.8 million during the last six months despite the introduction of the Shanghai update, which allowed withdrawals from the beacon chain."

        "content": "A crypto wallet owned by the Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin has seen a series of transactional activities lately, piquing the interest of crypto community members at a time when Ethereum selling pressures are rising.\n\nFollowing this, Buterin has taken the initiative to address the concerns regarding his recent transfer of digital assets to multiple exchanges.\n\nEthereum Co-Founder Discloses Truth Behind Multi-Transfers\n\nIn a recent post on Warp Cast, a decentralized social network, Russian-Canadian computer programmer and founder of Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin publicized the real reason behind the latest ETH transfers made via his wallet address.\n\nButerin explained to the public that the large-scale ETH transactions that were performed using his wallet were not sold by him. He stated that over the years, he has mostly focused on donating large sums of Ethereum funds to charity organizations and other projects. He further solidified his claims saying that he had not sold ETH for personal profits since 2018.\n\n\u201cIf you see an article saying \u2018Vitalik sends XXX ETH to [exchange]\u2019, it\u2019s not actually me selling, it\u2019s almost always me donating to some charity or nonprofit or other projects, and the recipient selling because, well, they have to cover expenses,\u201d Buterin stated.\n\nButerin is well-known for his philanthropic acts toward charity organizations and medical interventions. The Ethereum co-founder made headlines in 2021, after donating $1 billion worth of SHIB tokens to a COVID-19 relief fund in India.\n\nAdditionally, in February 2023, Buterin donated $150,000 to Anka Relief to fund a crypto aid project that would support T\u00fcrkiye after its recent earthquake experiences.\n\nAlthough there have been many proofs of Buterin\u2019s propensity to donate to multiple charities, the crypto community has remained skeptical and vigilant, relentlessly monitoring the Ethereum founder\u2019s cryptocurrency activities, as well as these recent high-value ETH transactions.\n\nETH price settles above $1,570 | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nSpokesperson Reveals $15 Million ETH Transfer From Kanro Charity\n\nAccording to data from PeckShield Alert, a blockchain security and auditing firm, Vitalik Buterin recently made a large-scale transaction of $15 million USDC to the Gemini Exchange.\n\nThis transaction in question is among the list of recent transfers associated with the Ethereum founder. These movements have prompted both curiosity and concern in the crypto community, as observers attempt to determine the underlying motive behind Buterin\u2019s transactions.\n\nA report from Cointelegraph said an Ethereum Foundation Spokesperson has clarified the details behind the lofty transaction. According to the Spokesperson, the $15 million USDC transfer was only executed under Buterin\u2019s Ethereum Name Service (ENS) and not from his wallet address.\n\nThe spokesperson also supposedly confirmed that the funds were from a transfer made by a charity multi-sig wallet, Kanro, which is closely linked to Buterin to sponsor a grant.\n\nFeatured image from U.Today, chart from Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

ETH Price Keeps Falling But Eco Friendly Ecoterra Just Hit $4.5 Million \u2013 100x Potential in 2023?\n\nSource / Sam Cooling x ETH\n\nAfter more than a month of consolidatory ranging, Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) price remains steadfast in a tightly fought range.\n\nCurrently trading at $1,858 (a 24-hour change of -0.79%), Ether appears to have once again been rejected by a tough ceiling of resistance at $1,925.\n\nNow in a minor -3.60% retracement move, markets are on edge as ETH heads for a retest of support at the tricky MA20.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Technical Analysis: Consolidation Continues\u2026\n\nTradingView / ETH USDT\n\nIndeed, the MA20 has formed a critical moving average since April \u2013 suppressing upside price moves for over 35 days.\n\nA breakthrough moment last week could be the last chance at a return to a technical rally structure for Ether on the short-time frame (STF), and a strong bounce from support here could supercharge price action.\n\nBut despite a continuation of the mid-range pattern, Ethereum\u2019s oscillators cloud judgment.\n\nWith an RSI sat at 51, a marginal display of bearish divergence, many are wondering whether the current price level is sustainable.\n\nIndeed, the recent retracement move has failed to flip to an oversold signal on the RSI, and this could demand ETH price pushes lower.\n\nIn contrast, the MACD provides a lot of hope, with an incredibly bullish 8.78 reflecting the newfound support above the MA20.\n\nEthereum On-Chain Analysis: Will Accumulation Window Impact ETH Price?\n\nShifting attention to Ethereum on-chain, there has been a seismic reversal of market behavior worthy of attention.\n\nLooking at Net Transfer Volume from/to Exchanges, there has been a clear change in sentiment towards accumulation behaviour since May 23.\n\nGlassnode / Net Transfer Volume (Ethereum)\n\nNow in the 9th day of net outflow (depicting Ether moving from exchange accounts into cold storage wallets or staking), more than 600,000 ETH has moved off exchanges in recent days (with a value of $1.125bn).\n\nThis accumulation has been characterized by a huge outflow on May 26, which saw a whopping 451,806 ETH (worth $825m) withdrawn in just one day.\n\nOverall, this suggests ETH price is likely to push up as accumulation pressures supply dynamics.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Price Prediction: Rain or Shine?\n\nWith technical structure fighting to resume, and on-chain signaling suggesting a shift in market sentiment from distribution to accumulation, the ostensible downside slide of Ethereum might not be all it seems.\n\nIf Ethereum bulls can successfully defend the MA20 mark, forming a new support level \u2013 then ETH price is likely to push up to $2,000 (+7.4%).\n\nHowever, the downside risk isn\u2019t insignificant. If the MA20 gives way \u2013 then the ETH price could plummet back down to local support at $1,785 (-4.15%).\n\nTradingView / ETH USDT\n\nThis leaves Ethereum with a Risk: Reward ratio of 1.78 \u2013 a fair entry.\n\nBut despite the attractive risk: reward ratio, returns here are limited by price structure \u2013 if an investor committed $1,000 to an Ethereum long position, they could only expect to make a poxy $74 in the best case.\n\nWhile nothing to be laughed at, these aren\u2019t the lucrative returns that draw people to crypto, and indeed many retail traders are looking to assume more aggressive risk profiles in order to fuel seismic gains.\n\nOne such opportunity, leading the pack with the huge promise of using blockchain to unlock the climate change conundrum, is Ecoterra.\n\nEcoterra: The Best ETH Price Downturn Alternative?\n\nSource / Ecoterra\n\nEthereum\u2019s market is facing turbulence, but an exciting newcomer, Ecoterra ($ECOTERRA), is changing the game.\n\nProviding investors with the opportunity to bank on eco-friendly blockchain platforms, this green crypto coin has already raised a staggering $4.5 million.\n\nEcoterra ingeniously combines blockchain technology\u2019s transformative power with an all-out war on climate change and wasteful resource practices.\n\nEcoterra Innovates with Planet Changing Recycle2Earn Technology\n\nSource / Ecoterra Tokenomics\n\nWith its presale currently at the 7th stage, ecoterra has already raised $4.5 million, bringing it astonishingly close to its $4.775 million target.\n\nThe unique appeal of ecoterra lies in its innovative Recycle-to-Earn (R2E) system, which promises to redefine sustainable recycling.\n\nBy leveraging the decentralized nature of blockchain, ecoterra rewards users for responsible recycling practices, attracting global brands like Coca-Cola, Carlsberg, and Evian.\n\nBut why should you care about Ecoterra?\n\nHere are three compelling reasons:\n\n1. Ecoterra Presale: An Exclusive Chance to Invest and Make a Difference\n\nThe ecoterra presale presents a golden opportunity to buy into a project that\u2019s making waves in the crypto world, following a recent award at the Blockchain Economy Summit in Istanbul.\n\nWith the native $ECOTERRA token available at $0.0085 before its jump to $0.00925 upon hitting the presale target, investors are treated to a prime chance to back a sustainable future while enjoying considerable returns.\n\nAs the token\u2019s price ascends, early presale investors stand to gain from significant ROI, alongside future staking protocols for passive income generation.\n\n2. Pioneering the Green Revolution with Blockchain Technology\n\nEcoterra stands out with its unique blend of environmental conservation and blockchain.\n\nBy creating a transparent record of each user\u2019s environmental impact and incentivizing eco-conscious practices with its cryptocurrency, Ecoterra offers an impressive package of environmental responsibility and economic growth.\n\n3. Becoming a Part of Ecoterra\u2019s Eco-friendly Revolution\n\nThere\u2019s never been a better time to be part of the green revolution in crypto, and ecoterra offers an exclusive chance to get on board, and take the fight back to climate change using the latest and greatest in blockchain technology.\n\nDon\u2019t Miss Out on Final Moments of Ecoterra Presale"

I haven\u2019t \u2018sold\u2019 ETH for personal gain since 2018.\u201d\n\nThe controversy goes back to December 2017, when Vitalik Buterin famously liquidated a substantial amount of cryptocurrency holdings, amounting to approximately $50 million. This move had a significant impact on the Ethereum market at the time. However, Buterin\u2019s statement emphasizes that this was the last time he had planned to sell his crypto holdings for personal gain.\n\nButerin\u2019s Recent ETH Transfers Stir Controversy\n\nThe following events come after his recent transfer of approximately $14.9 million worth of USD Coin (USDC) from his wallet, named \u201cVitalik.eth,\u201d to the Gemini cryptocurrency exchange on Oct. 16, as reported by PeckShield, a blockchain analytics firm.\n\nHowever, the situation surrounding the $15 million USDC transfer to Gemini has now been clarified. According to a report from TrustNodes, the USDC sent from Vitalik\u2019s address belonged to Kanro, the biotechnology charity he founded, further reinforcing his commitment to philanthropic efforts.\n\nIn addition to the Gemini transfer, Buterin had previously transferred nearly $500,000 to Coinbase just three days before the Gemini transaction. Throughout September, the total amount transferred from Buterin\u2019s wallets exceeded $3.9 million.\n\nOne particular transaction on Sept. 24 drew significant attention, as Buterin sent 400 ETH, equivalent to $600,000 at the time, to Coinbase. Moreover, in early October, he deposited 600 ETH, valued at approximately $1 million, into the same exchange."

Source: Coinglass\n\nContrary to popular belief, the \u201cOctober effect,\u201d which predicts that October will be a losing month, only applies to traditional stock markets.\n\nOctober is especially significant for cryptocurrency because Satoshi Nakomoto, the project\u2019s pseudonymous founder, published the project\u2019s white paper for the first time on October 31, 2008.\n\nOctober Offers the Highest Returns in Crypto\n\nCryptocurrency strategist James Altucher, the host and creator of InvestAnswers, believes that as the year\u2019s final quarter officially begins, October will traditionally be a strong month for Bitcoin.\n\nJames Altucher said:\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s look at how October benchmarks against other months in the history of Bitcoin. Here you can see September is red August is like breakeven. But October is the third-best month historically. And that\u2019s why many people refer to it as Uptober.\u201d\n\nBased on the historical return for October, he believes Bitcoin could reach $26,000 in the next four weeks.\n\nAccording to James, October had the third-highest average monthly returns. He believes that October is historically the third-best month. As a result, many people refer to it as Uptober.\n\nCrypto Community is Bullish for Ethereum in October\n\nMany cryptocurrencies are trading in the green on their daily and weekly charts. It also includes Ethereum (ETH), one of the largest tokens, which has led the crypto community to predict that the market will continue to rise by the end of October.\n\nAccording to Coinglass data, the Ethereum price has historically performed exceptionally well in October.\n\nEthereum monthly returns. Source: Coinglass\n\nThe community votes at CoinMarketCap predicted that Ethereum\u2019s token would trade at an average price of $1,578 on October 31, 2022, according to the most recent data obtained on September 27 using the platform\u2019s \u2018Price Estimates\u2019 tool.\n\nNotably, the cryptocurrency community\u2019s forecast for Ethereum\u2019s price, which received 2,244 votes, shows a 13.34% increase.\n\nBitcoin Price & Technical Outlook\n\nBitcoin is currently trading near the psychological level of $20,000. In my previous Bitcoin update, I mentioned that the BTC/USD pair had formed a descending triangle pattern, extending significant resistance near $20,478.\n\nBitcoin failed to break above the trendline resistance and now heading south to cross below the 50-day moving average providing immediate support near the psychological level of $20,000 in this case.\n\nBitcoin Price Chart \u2013 Source: Tradingview\n\nLeading technical indicators such as the RSI and moving average convergence and divergence (MACD) are above 50 and 0, still indicating a buying trend. However, the \u201changing man\u201d candlesticks pattern is signaling chances of a bearish correction today.\n\nOn the downside, Bitcoin\u2019s immediate support level remains at $20,000, with $18,650 serving as an immediate support level below this level.\n\nEthereum Price & Technical Outlook\n\nETH is currently consolidating in a narrow trading range of $1,300 to $1,400, possibly awaiting a strong fundamental reason to trigger a breakout. On the technical side, the ETH/USD pair is trading marginally higher after recovering from the psychological support level of $1,300.\n\nOn the daily timeframe, a small ascending triangle pattern provides immediate resistance near the $1,400 level. Ascending triangle patterns have a high likelihood of breaking out on the bullish side, so the odds of an ETH\u2019s bullish bias remain high.\n\nEthereum Price Chart \u2013 Source: Tradingview\n\nAs a result, a positive crossover over $1,400 may clear the way for an uptrend to extend to $1,575 or $1,650. If the price of ETH continues to rise, it might reach $1,795 per coin. Support, on the other hand, remains near $1,300 and $1,227.\n\nNew Altcoin News\n\nIn addition to leading cryptocurrencies, new altcoins are making headlines. IMPT, a new protocol, is being developed to help businesses and people track and control their carbon footprint. The protocol is designed to reward and incentivize users for their participation.\n\nIMPT is on a presale, and it\u2019s exhibiting a massive performance, having raised more than $1.4 million in just four days of its presale.\n\nAlongside, Tamadoge is also under the spotlight, having gained more than 300% from its all-time low of $0.01683. The first Tamadoge NFTs are now available on OpenSea, along with 100 ultra-rare Tamadoge Pets.\n\nFind The Best Price to Buy/Sell Cryptocurrency:"

        "content": "Just weeks ago, The Protocol reported how Ethereum developers were worried that the number of validators on the blockchain was growing so fast that the resulting sprawl might cause latency issues. That problem may have temporarily resolved itself, thanks to what Coinbase analysts attributed to \u201ca plateau in investor demand for Ethereum staking.\u201d As reported by CoinDesk\u2019s Krisztian Sandor, the once month-long queue of validators waiting to get onto the network has now basically been cleared out. One factor is that staking rewards have dropped significantly, to near 3.5% from 5%-6% earlier this year, due to tepid network activity to generate revenue from fees and the increasing number of stakers. That looks like a pretty paltry return for crypto, especially with traditional money market funds and old-fashioned, one-year U.S. Treasury bills yielding north of 5%."

        "content": "In a move to dispel rumors and speculations surrounding his recent Ethereum (ETH) transfers, Vitalik Buterin, the renowned founder of the Ethereum blockchain, took to social media to address the growing concerns of the crypto community.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a tweet, Buterin clarified the nature of the transactions, asserting that any reports indicating his personal selling of ETH were misleading. He clarified that these transfers were primarily charitable donations made to organizations and projects, necessitating liquidation to cover operational expenses.\n\nI haven't \"sold\" ETH for personal gain since 2018 - Vitalik Buterin\n\nThe Ethereum founder's message comes in response to growing confusion within the cryptocurrency community regarding the nature of these transfers. Many perceived them as sell-offs, which led to bearish sentiments on the market.\n\nA notable example emerged recently when Kanro, a charity closely affiliated with Vitalik Buterin, made substantial transfers of approximately 15.43 million USDC. Out of this total, 500,000 USDC found its way to Coinbase on Oct. 14, while a substantial 14.93 million USDC was sent to Gemini on Oct. 16.\n\nButerin had previously introduced Kanro on June 9, 2023, highlighting that it primarily receives funding from Crypto Relief, led by the Polygon founder and Buterin himself. Kanro's mission revolves around researching global solutions for the pandemic and potential future epidemics.\n\nDespite Buterin's attempts to clarify the situation, the enigmatic nature of his recent activities continues to raise eyebrows. While some questions have been answered, a lingering air of mystery surrounds his transactions, leaving many intrigued. As the crypto world speculates about motives, it seems there might be more to this story than meets the eye."

Researching minute occurrences and bringing new insights lie within the prime focus of my task.\n\nThe global crypto market cap witnessed a notable rise in the past few days, as the levels are now raised beyond $1.09 trillion. Despite a drop in trading volume in the past 24 hours, Bitcoin\u2019s price is able to sustain above $28,000. Besides, the Ethereum price trades above $1500, while the other tokens in the top 10 are trying hard to materialize decent gains.\n\nIn times when market sentiments are closer to making a notable shift from being pessimistic to optimistic, the possibility of a bearish turn-down could hinder the progress of the rally for a while. A popular analyst, anonymously known as Colin Talks Crypto, believes that the BTC price could drop below $24,000 while the ETH/BTC pair could make new lows in the next several months.\n\nReferring to the above chart, Colin Talks Crypto believes the BTC price could complete its head and shoulder pattern. With this, the price could drop to levels between $18,000 and $23,000, which is likely to happen by the end of 2023 or the very beginning of 2024. Moreover, the analyst also believes the Bitcoin spot ETF could get approved sometime after the crash, causing a huge \u2018God Candle\u2019 recording a minimum $10,000 jump.\n\nWhile the BTC price is undergoing some compression, the analyst believes the ETH/BTC could get decimated and drop to new lows somewhere between 0.035 and 0.045. As no Ethereum ETF is getting approved, all the liquidity will FOMO into Bitcoin first, pushing the ETHBTC pair down. However, approval may be expected after the ETH/BTC ratio hits new lows. In the meantime, the other altcoins are also expected to make new lows against Bitcoin. Therefore, the Bitcoin price prediction for 2023 and for the beginning of 2024 appears to be bearish at present."

Source: a video screenshot, Grand Amphi Th\u00e9atre / YouTube\n\nEthereum (ETH) co-founder Vitalik Buterin outlined his vision for the second-largest project\u2019s future at the Ethereum Community Conference in Paris on Thursday.\n\nThe vision included an increased focus on security, stability, and decentralization, as well as the following key points:\n\nEthereum is \u201c55% complete once we finish the Merge.\u201d Buterin compared this to the view he said is common in the Bitcoin (BTC) community, where people \u2013 according to Buterin \u2013 see Bitcoin as 80% complete. Ethereum should, over time, \u201csettle down.\u201d A lot of innovations have happened or are in the process of happening, including the famous EIP-1559 and the transition to proof-of-stake (PoS), the Ethereum co-founder explained. He noted that \u201cat some point, the rate of change for the protocol is going to have to slow down.\u201d Ethereum will then \u201clook somewhat more like a system that optimizes for safety and predictability, and less like an ecosystem that optimizes for impressing and dazzling people,\u201d he said. Buterin warned against adding support for multiple virtual machines, and getting too comfortable with technologies like SNARKs (succinct non-interactive argument of knowledge), and said it is a danger if Ethereum becomes so complex that \u201cno single person can understand the whole protocol.\u201d Instead of increasing complexity, the focus should be on decentralization, Buterin opined. He said that this includes having an easy-to-use light client for the consensus layer, execution layer, and Layer-2\u2019s \u201cas a default,\u201d have better support for home stakers, and make sure it\u2019s possible to run a full node on lighter hardware. In terms of changes that are worth making in the future, Buterin pointed to upgrades for quantum resistance as one such change. Quantum computers are coming he said, adding that \u201conce quantum computers come, we have to upgrade to different cryptography.\u201d Commenting on the merits of PoS, Buterin admitted that transitioning to it is \u201ca big change\u201d and said there are also \u201clots of benefits.\u201d He added that the few remaining proof-of-work (PoW) supporters that exist in the Ethereum community can use Ethereum Classic (ETC) instead.

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nShiba Inu's Layer-2 scaling solution Shibarium has been in the spotlight since its inception, and it appears to be moving at a relatively slower speed despite hitting new milestones on a regular basis. One major factor that needs to change in order for Shibarium to change its fortunes in the mid- to long term is its block time which, according to Shibariumscam, is pegged at 5.0 seconds.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor a blockchain protocol, this block time is impressive, but many caveats present themselves with respect to this particular metric. First is the overall transaction load on the protocol in relation to the other competing chains.\n\nOn-chain data revealed that the average daily transaction on Shibarium is pegged at 11.47K, down from an October peak of 33.05K. For better context, while Shibarium has processed a total of 3,497,383 transactions since it was launched on the mainnet in August, other Ethereum-based protocols like Arbitrum (ARB) and Optimism (OP) process an average monthly transaction of 17.68 million and 8.03 million, respectively.\n\nThis figure begs the thesis that should the transaction load on Shibarium grow beyond its current level, the block time might increase in a way that will make transactions clog once again.\n\nGetting ahead of curve\n\nFor a very long time, Shibarium's block time has remained stagnant at 5.0 seconds, without any observable fluctuations. In order to get ahead of the curve, the core team behind Shibarium needs to place more emphasis on improving block time from better to best.\n\nAs a relatively newer player in the L2 arena, Shibarium needs all the competitive edge it can get in order to beat its peers to gain more market share. Though Shibarium continues to hit new records, it needs to work on its block time if it will be able to dominate the L2 ecosystem on Ethereum in the near future."

        "content": "The world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency Ethereum (ETH) has been under some selling pressure and trading 1.21% down at a price of $1,570 and a market cap of $188 billion.\n\nEthereum Whales In Action\n\nETH has been under selling pressure for a while and has been failing to break past the resistance of $1,600. However, the Ethereum whales are making the most of the opportunity. As per on-chain data provider Santiment, Ethereum billionaire wallets have their holdings touch a 7-year high.\n\nadvertisement\n\nWhale addresses on the Ethereum network, characterized by holdings of at least 1 million ETH, currently possess 32.3% of the total supply. This marks the first time such a significant concentration has occurred since 2016. Furthermore, transactions exceeding $1 million in value experienced their second-highest daily volume in the past five weeks. These developments are indicative of a historic moment in Ethereum\u2019s trajectory, reported Santiment.\n\nRecently, there\u2019s been a major buzz over Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin sending large amounts of coins to the exchanges. This development has also kept the ETH price under selling pressure for a while However, Buterin recently clarified that all those coins that he has been selling recently have been only for charity and donations and not for his personal gains.\n\nETH Price Action\n\nEthereum\u2019s price, currently at $1,568, recently rebounded from the support level of $1,533, resulting in a slight increase. However, the cryptocurrency encountered resistance at the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), hindering its progress toward reclaiming the $1,686 resistance as a support level.\n\nNonetheless, there\u2019s still potential for Ethereum\u2019s price to recover, as indicated by the Relative Strength Index (RSI). The RSI hovers around the neutral mark at 50.0, within the bearish zone, but a further uptick could flip it into a support level, confirming a bullish signal.\n\nOn the contrary, if the bullish signal doesn\u2019t materialize and the $1,533 support is breached, the Ethereum price may drop below the $1,500 mark, invalidating the bullish outlook"

        "title": "New Bitcoin: Ethereum hybrid set to explode this winter - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "The world of cryptocurrency is once again on the brink of a revolution. This winter, a new hybrid crypto, a lovechild of Bitcoin and Ethereum, promises to change the way we perceive finance. This article will dive deep into the birth of this new financial model, the rethinking of DeFi by this new altcoin, and how this impacts the world of crypto mining.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum gave birth to a new way of finance\n\nThe new hybrid altcoin, known as Bitcoin Spark (BTCS), is the product of combining the best of Bitcoin and Ethereum. This isn\u2019t just a metaphorical blend; it\u2019s a literal fusion of the two most popular cryptos, bringing together the stability and reliability of Bitcoin with the flexibility and potential of Ethereum.\n\nThe idea behind BTCS is simple: to create an altcoin that can act as a stable store of value, like Bitcoin, while also offering smart contract functionality, like Ethereum. This dual nature allows BTCS to serve both as an investment and a tool for building decentralized applications (dApps), making it a versatile addition to any crypto portfolio.\n\nThe birth of BTCS marks a new era in crypto finance. This is an era where the boundaries between different cryptos are blurred, bringing together the best of each world to create something entirely new and full of potential. It\u2019s a testament to the evolving nature of crypto, a world that\u2019s always pushing the boundaries of what\u2019s possible.\n\nNew Hybrid altcoin rethinks DeFi: Bitcoin Spark\n\nThe world of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) has been one of the most significant developments in the crypto sphere over the past few years. However, the rise of DeFi has also exposed the limitations of existing cryptos. Bitcoin, for all its value, lacks the functionality to fully embrace DeFi. Ethereum, on the other hand, while offering smart contract capabilities, struggles with scalability and high transaction fees.\n\nThat\u2019s where BTCS comes in. By combining the strengths of Bitcoin and Ethereum, BTCS rethinks DeFi. It brings together the best of both worlds to create a new hybrid model of DeFi. This model leverages the stability and reliability of Bitcoin and the versatility and potential of Ethereum to create a more powerful, efficient, and scalable DeFi platform.\n\nThe introduction of BTCS is not just an exciting development for investors but also for developers. With BTCS, developers can build dApps that take advantage of the security of Bitcoin and the flexibility of Ethereum. This opens up a world of possibilities for DeFi, from more efficient lending platforms to more versatile decentralized exchanges (DEXs).\n\nA new way of smartphone mining with BTCS\n\nBut BTCS is not just about redefining DeFi. It\u2019s also about making crypto mining more accessible. Traditionally, crypto mining has been a resource-intensive process, requiring specialized hardware and a significant amount of electricity. This has made it difficult for the average person to participate in mining and benefit from it.\n\nBTCS aims to change this. By leveraging the power of smartphones, BTCS allows anyone with a smartphone to participate in crypto mining. This not only democratizes mining but also makes it more environmentally friendly. Instead of relying on large mining farms that consume a lot of electricity, BTCS mining can be done on a device that most people own and use daily.\n\nSmartphone mining has the potential to bring millions of people into the world of crypto, expanding its reach and influence. It\u2019s a step towards a more inclusive and sustainable crypto ecosystem, one where anyone can participate and benefit.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nThe launch of BTCS is undoubtedly one of the most exciting developments in the crypto world this winter. It brings together the best of Bitcoin and Ethereum, creating a new hybrid altcoin that redefines DeFi and democratizes crypto mining. As we move into this new era of crypto finance, the potential of BTCS is unlimited.\n\nFor more information:\n\nWebsite: https://bitcoinspark.org/\n\nBuy BTCS: https://network.bitcoinspark.org/register\n\nDisclaimer: This is a paid post and should not be treated as news/advice."

        "content": "Ethereum is getting more concentrated into the hands of whales, according to the latest data from on-chain analytics provider Santiment.\n\nOn October 18, Santiment reported that billionaire Ethereum investors with more than 1 million ETH hold 32.2% of the available supply for the first time since 2016.\n\nFurthermore, Ethereum transactions exceeding $1 million hit their second-highest day in a month.\n\n\ud83d\udc0b #Ethereum\u2018s whale addresses in the #billionaire tier (holding at least 1M $ETH) now hold 32.3% of the available supply for the first time since 2016.

History is being made. https://t.co/sywdtn14k5 pic.twitter.com/SdbSrChJCf \u2014 Santiment (@santimentfeed) October 17, 2023\n\nEthereum Selling Continues\n\nWith whales controlling a third of the supply, Ethereum has become very concentrated in the hands of the wealthy. However, Santiment didn\u2019t specify whether these figures included entities such as centralized exchanges or stablecoin issuers that hold a lot of ETH.\n\nWhat has been analyzed, however, is the selling patterns, and whales have been offloading ETH over the past few months.\n\nAccording to data from Glassnode, there is a \u201cstriking difference\u201d in the behavior of major Bitcoin and Ethereum holdings, indicating divergent views among crypto whales.\n\nSince 2020, Ethereum whales, or those that hold over 1,000 ETH in this case, have been progressively lowering their holdings. This has resulted in the sale of about $20 million in ETH.\n\nHowever, Bitcoin whales holding more than 1,000 BTC have primarily maintained their holdings, according to the data shared by CoinMarketCap.\n\nNevertheless, the Ethereum staking narrative has never been stronger, with more of the asset being staked than ever before despite withdrawals opening in April.\n\nThere are currently a record 27.6 million ETH staked valued at around $43.4 billion, according to Beaconcha.in. This represents around 23% of the total supply.\n\nFurthermore, that supply has declined by 260,640 ETH or $409 million since the Merge in September last year, according to Ultrasound.Money.\n\nETH Price Bearish\n\nNone of the bullish staking or deflationary supply fundamentals have been able to beat the Ethereum bears off yet.\n\nETH is down another 1.3% on the day, trading at $1,568 at the time of writing. The asset has lost 4.5% over the past fortnight and continues to decline with the rest of the altcoins.\n\nEthereum is now 68% down from its all-time high, whereas Bitcoin, which has performed better this week, is down 59% from its peak."

        "content": "Valkyrie Investments Receives SEC Approval for First Ethereum Futures ETF\n\nValkyrie Investments receives SEC approval to launch the first Ethereum futures ETF in the United States.\n\nPhoto by Zoltan Tasi on Unsplash\n\nToday, Nashville-based asset management firm Valkyrie Investments secured approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch the first-ever exchange-traded fund (ETF) for Ethereum futures. This could mark an important milestone for digital asset investment in the United States.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s decision comes as the regulatory body is slowly opening up to the crypto market. In October 2021, the SEC allowed the trading of Bitcoin ETFs priced off futures contracts. Valkyrie Investments is now part of a select group of firms that offer crypto-related ETFs, building on its existing Bitcoin Mining ETF.\n\nRising Competition in the Ether ETF Space\n\nValkyrie Investments is not alone in its pursuit of establishing Ethereum futures ETFs. Eight other issuers, including VanEck, Grayscale Investments, and Bitwise, have filed applications with the SEC. These firms look to capitalize on the growing demand for Ethereum, which currently holds the title of the world\u2019s second-largest digital asset.\n\nBeyond Ethereum futures ETFs, Valkyrie Investments, along with Wall Street giants like BlackRock and Fidelity, is also exploring the possibility of introducing a spot Bitcoin ETF. A spot ETF would enable a broader array of investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin\u2019s spot price instead of its future value, which is currently only accessible to accredited investors.\n\nSo far, the SEC has been hesitant to approve this type of ETF, citing regulatory concerns.\n\nAccelerated Approval Amid Government Shutdown Concerns\n\nInterestingly, Valkyrie had initially planned to roll out its fund on October 3. However, concerns over a potential U.S. government shutdown prompted the SEC to fast-track the approval process for Ethereum futures ETFs. If Congress fails to agree on funding, the government could cease most operations, affecting nearly two million federal workers and possibly disrupting SEC activities.\n\nValkyrie\u2019s Chief Investment Officer, Steven McClurg, expressed satisfaction with the SEC\u2019s decision in an interview with Fox Business.\n\n\u201cWe are thrilled to be the first to offer ether futures to our investors as interest in the asset has grown exponentially over the past year,\u201d he said.\n\nThe firm plans to convert its existing Bitcoin futures ETF into a combined fund offering both Bitcoin and Ethereum futures, with trading set to begin today.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s accelerated approval timeline also hints at the agency\u2019s attempt to maintain market stability in case of a government shutdown. Earlier this week, the SEC delayed decisions on other spot Bitcoin ETF applications, including one from Ark 21Shares, a fund owned by tech investor Cathie Wood.\n\nOn the legislative front, SEC Chairman Gary Gensler urged companies planning to go public to expedite their efforts before a possible government shutdown. A shutdown would force the agency to operate with a reduced workforce, affecting its ability to oversee the markets and public offerings.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s approval of Valkyrie Investments\u2019 Ethereum futures ETF represents another step toward the maturation of the crypto market in the U.S. While the SEC remains cautious, particularly concerning spot ETFs, it has shown a willingness to accommodate futures-based products.\n\nWith other firms lining up to offer similar products, competition in the Ether ETF space is bound to intensify."

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s Vitalik Buterin Lists \u2018Worthwhile\u2019 Ideas for Developers to Work On\n\nVitalik Buterin. Source: a video screenshot, KryptoSeoul / YouTube\n\nEthereum (ETH) co-founder Vitalik Buterin has listed several points that he argues are worth working on, during the ETH Seoul 2022, an Ethereum and blockchain-focused event held in South Korea.\n\nIn the first place, the Ethereum mastermind encouraged developers to build rollups, a type of scaling solution that involves rolling-up transactions and presenting them as a single transaction to decrease costs while increasing speed.\n\nHe specifically emphasized the growth of zero-knowledge technologies, and the need for more work on zero-knowledge rollups, aka zk-rollups. Buterin said that succinct non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs (zk-SNARKs), a proof architecture where one can demonstrate ownership of specific knowledge without disclosing that knowledge, are almost as important as the blockchain technology itself.\n\n\u201cI actually think zk-SNARKs might be like almost or even equally as important to the f,,,] privacy, openness, and [\u2026] freedom kind of alternative. decentralized, web tech movement as blockchains are,\u201d Buterin said.\n\nHe said zk-SNARKs are \u201cextremely\u201d effective at giving users privacy and scalability while preserving security, which is comparable to what blockchains are trying to do. He added that zero-knowledge proofs can actually act as a compliment to blockchains.\n\nBlockchains aim to provide a lot of security, but in exchange, they sacrifice privacy and scalability. On the other hand, zk-SNARKs give back privacy and scalability \u2013 \u201cso build ZK apps,\u201d Buterin said.\n\nHe further encouraged developers to focus on privacy, claiming that it is less explored compared to scalability.\n\nNotably, there are already some attempts to create protocols focused on preserving privacy. For instance, there is Proof of Humanity (PoH), a social identity verification system for humans developed on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\n\u201cIn Ethereum, we are starting to have more and more of these protocols. They are issuing some kind of attestation at specific addresses to say something about the person who controls that address,\u201d Buterin said, adding that such protocols can make airdrops and decentralized governance fairer by removing identical users.\n\nProof of Attendance Protocol (POAP), a protocol that creates digital badges or collectibles through the use of blockchain technology, is another such project. This protocol can confirm that an address belongs to someone who participated in an event without revealing the identity of the person.\n\nButerin also encouraged developers to consider working on soulbound tokens, which are tokens that can\u2019t be sold or separated from their owners.\n\nHe has been very vocal about these tokens recently. After initially exploring the idea in a blog post earlier this year, Buterin co-authored a research paper in mid-May explaining how non-transferable Soulbound Tokens (SBTs) can create a richer, pluralistic ecosystem within Ethereum. Buterin suggested that soulbound tokens would be able to encode social relationships of trust.\n\nThese tokens could be used for exclusive airdrops, or \u201csouldrops,\u201d allowing an organization to choose the right members based on their needs.\n\nAnother area that Buterin argues developers should try to improve is public goods funding. He noted that Bitcoiners already have a public goods funding called quadratic funding, which is a more optimal way to fund public goods.\n\nHowever, he said that there are opportunities to improve quadratic funding by making the mechanism better, and by increasing security and privacy.\n\nLastly, Buterin said that developers should aim for better decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) governance. He said the current governance model in DAOs is either centralized or attackable, due to the coin-based governance that they employ.\n\nButerin claimed that the coin-based governance is \u201cfundamentally broken,\u201d encouraging developers to consider governance models that are not coin-driven. This is also where things like souldbound tokens and Proof of Humanity can prove useful as they can help make sure only real and unique humans are participating in governance.\n\n____\n\nLearn more:\n\n\u2013 EthereumPoW Fork Won\u2019t \u2018Significantly\u2019 Harm Ethereum \u2013 Vitalik Buterin\n\n\u2013 Vitalik Buterin says The Merge is Not \u2018Priced in\u2019 as Investor Promises to Fork Ethereum\n\n\n\n\u2013 6 Key Points in Vitalik Buterin\u2019s Vision for Ethereum Presented at EthCC\n\n\u2013 Vitalik Buterin Confirms Post-Merge Ethereum Centralization Concerns, Urges Not to \u2018Overly Catastrophize\u2019 It\n\n\n\n\u2013 Top Blockchain Non-Financial Applications According to Vitalik Buterin\n\n\u2013 Layer 2 in 2022: Get Ready for Rollups, Bridges, New Apps, Life With Ethereum 2.0, and Layer 3"

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRipple Labs Inc. CTO David Schwartz has posed a thought-provoking question to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over the security status of Ethereum (ETH).\n\nRhetorical inquiry about Ethereum\n\nTaking to his official X handle, Schwartz responded to a post from the SEC in which the commission instructed the community to always revert to its own channels for news that pertains to its regulatory affairs.\n\nThe SEC's counsel comes after a piece of fake news broke about the commission approving the iShares Bitcoin spot ETF application from BlackRock. In the SEC's words, investors need to be careful what they read on the internet, noting that \"the best source of information about the SEC is the SEC.\"\n\nDrawing on this, the Ripple CTO asked the SEC if it thinks people selling Ethereum on secondary marketplaces are selling securities. This question is highly impractical to answer over social media as it constitutes the core of what the ongoing Ripple v. SEC legal battle as well as other trading platforms is all about.\n\nAwesome. Does the SEC think people selling ETH on exchanges are selling securities? I'd like to hear from the best source. https://t.co/Mvgaa9DgUH \u2014 David \"JoelKatz\" Schwartz (@JoelKatz) October 17, 2023\n\nTo date, only XRP has been certified as an altcoin whose trading on secondary marketplaces does not constitute a security. This clarity was obtained after more than two years of litigation, with the favorable ruling decided by Judge Analisa Torres in July.\n\nBased on the complexity of the question, any answer given by the market regulator will spark another round of curiosity that it obviously cannot afford at this time.\n\nContinuous pressure for SEC\n\nDespite being empowered by the law to regulate the market, the SEC is obviously not finding its role easy, especially as concerns crypto regulatory affairs. Besides being disfavored by a court ruling in the Grayscale-Bitcoin conversion case, the presence of industry giants like BlackRock and Fidelity in the race for a Bitcoin spot ETF has put the SEC on the edge overall."

        "content": "After strong increases in the last few days, the Ethereum price suffered losses again and continues to lag well behind the price movement of Bitcoin. This is causing sentiment among Ethereum investors to plummet. But there is still massive growth potential. Can Bitcoin Halving Trigger an Altcoin Bull Run? Will we see an Ethereum price of $10,000 in 12 months? Let\u2019s take a look at Ethereum price prediction in more detail.\n\nHow has the Ethereum price moved in the last few weeks?\n\nETH/USD Weekly Chart- TradingView\n\nOverall, the Ethereum price has suffered losses in the last few weeks. The price saw a drop from $1,850 to below $1,600 over the last 4 to 5 weeks. This means that the Ether token has lost between 10 and 15 percent of its value during this time.\n\nTwo weeks ago there was a brief rise in the Ethereum price to over $1,700. But this spike was only visible for a short time and in the last 2 weeks the ETH price has fallen back below the $1,600 mark. In the last few days we have seen a slight upward trend again.\n\nEthereum price prediction: Is a massive increase possible in the next 12 months?\n\nAt the moment, the altcoin market is in a massive crisis. The smaller projects such as Solana, Cardano, Polygon or the Memecoins have already seen massive losses in the summer. Ethereum was initially able to hold up better, but has lost heavily against Bitcoin, especially in the last 2 to 3 months. Can this trend be reversed?\n\nThe Ethereum price could see a recovery again in the coming months. We must not forget that the altcoins have always suffered extremely in bear markets and the Bitcoin price has been able to hold up better.\n\nThe Bitcoin Halving could not only bring about a turning point for BTC, but also bring new hype around altcoins. So far this has always been the case in previous cycles. That\u2019s why we are very positive that the Ethereum price should rise massively again, especially after the Bitcoin Halving.\n\nEthereum price prediction: Will the Ethereum price rise to $10,000 in a year?\n\nThe Ethereum price could rise significantly again in the coming months. But is an increase to $10,000 realistic? Actually, this mark was supposed to fall in the last bull market. At the moment we are again massively underestimating the growth potential of Ethereum, precisely because it is the basis of most of the important altcoins.\n\nA rise to $10,000 in 12 months is an extremely optimistic forecast. But we shouldn\u2019t be surprised if the Ethereum price sees a massive increase again in the coming months.\n\nWhere to Buy Ethereum?\n\nPurchasing cryptocurrencies can seem daunting for newcomers, but platforms like Bitpanda have made the process straightforward and user-friendly. Bitpanda is a reputable exchange known for its ease of use and security features. To buy cryptos on Bitpanda, simply follow these steps:\n\nCreate an account on the Bitpanda platform. Verify your identity for security purposes. Deposit funds using your preferred payment method. Search for the desired cryptocurrency. Select the amount you wish to purchase and confirm the transaction.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou might also like\n\nMore from Altcoin"

        "content": "Coinbase Exec: Altcoin Markets Attracting Institutional Investors Amid Bitcoin and Ethereum Dominance\n\nDavid Duong. Source: a video screenshot, Scott Melker / YouTube\n\nWhile bitcoin (BTC) and ethereum (ETH) remain the top coins, altcoins are still drawing significant interest from institutional investors, argued David Duong, Head of Institutional Research at major crypto exchange Coinbase.\n\nDuong participated in a discussion with popular crypto analyst Scott Melker on March 2, as part of an interview panel that also featured the Founder of crypto options trading platform Hxro Dan Gunsberg and the Founder of investment adviser Morgan Creek Capital Mark Yusko.\n\nDiscussing the crypto market performance over the past year, Duong noted that what he is currently seeing in terms of flows on the exchange from Coinbase\u2019s institutional clients is that,\n\n\u201c55% of this is still on bitcoin and ETH, but that would mean that the remainder is still on altcoin \u2013 so there\u2019s still a lot of attention being paid to what\u2019s happening in the rest of the ecosystem outside of just Bitcoin and Ethereum.\u201d\n\nWhat we are currently witnessing in the market is a lot more macro-focused, he added, arguing that people don\u2019t realize that this is \u201cjust seasonally a weaker period for a lot of risk assets\u201d because everything is now in an in-between state where, on the one side, \u201cpeople have their bonus payments, putting money into their 401(k)\u201d, which are personal pension accounts in the USA, and on the other side, it is the time \u201cright before we\u2019re getting a lot of checks being cut for tax season.\u201d\n\nTherefore, Duong said,\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in this kind of like weak period, but we\u2019re trying to draw conclusions about what\u2019s happening with the [Federal Reserve] or what\u2019s happening with other things, the correlation, which by the way is coming down between crypto and other risk assets.\u201d\n\nHe concluded that, \u201cif anything\u201d, macro conditions for risk assets including crypto are neutral at the moment. However, he did warn that in the second quarter of this year, \u201cwe\u2019re going to hit into the real to debt ceiling issues\u201d when the economy could potentially become weaker.\n\nMelker also commented that we\u2019ve seen \u201cmini-narratives\u201d related to altcoins, but that these seem \u201cmuch smaller and quicker bubbles than the altcoin narratives we used to see in the past,\u201d he said, adding that,\n\nIt seems like \u201cthis is that old sort of washing machine cycle of crypto native people just moving in and out of altcoin narratives with no new money coming in.\u201d\n\nIt does seem very hyper-cyclical compared to what was seen in the past, Duong agreed, adding that we seem to be \u201cmoving very quickly [into it] and then kind of out of it pretty fast.\u201d\n\nAs to how new money would enter the space, Yusko argued that, among other things, it\u2019s people realizing that they\u2019ve got the institutional quality real assets that are uncorrelated, saying that \u201cbitcoin is the most uncorrelated asset I\u2019ve ever seen in my career.\u201d\n\nSpring is here and summer is coming\n\nAccording to Morgan Creek Capital\u2019s Yusko, it is now indeed crypto spring \u2013 but \u201cspring isn\u2019t summer.\u201d Spring comes with unstable weather: it\u2019s \u201cwindy and choppy,\u201d though he admitted that he didn\u2019t see \u201cHurricane Sam\u201d coming, referring to the fall of the FTX exchange and its founder Sam Bankman-Fried.\n\nSummer is coming, however, he suggested, especially with the Bitcoin halving approaching, as well as the incoming Ethereum Shanghai fork.\n\nGunsberg said that, looking at the Bitcoin Futures curve, there are higher prices on the horizon.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s actually a yield being delivered, something that we didn\u2019t see for a while. And that to me, and I\u2019ve been in crypto since 2015, has always been \u2013 ever since they started actually having trading futures, which maybe was like 2017-2018 \u2013 it\u2019s always been a good lead indicator for me of seeing is price higher out in the future.\u201d\n\nOnce the prices go up, Gunsberg said, the crowd comes and takes it even higher, which is a \u201cvery powerful [\u2026] feedback loop in on itself,\u201d but then it also drives the price lower, and \u201cthat is what to me embodies so much of this kind of longer-term volatility that you see in crypto.\u201d\n\nMelker concluded that, unless there is a massive Black Swan event,\n\n\u201cWe actually have a good chance that it\u2019s bottoms in. I also think we\u2019re going to chop sideways and it\u2019s going to be really annoying for quite a long time.\u201d\n\nYou can watch the full interview here:\n\n____\n\nLearn more:\n\n\u2013 Crypto Experts Predict These New Altcoins to See Price Pump Because of Strong Use Cases\n\n\u2013 Crypto Analysts are Saying These Altcoins Have Huge Potential \u2013 Here\u2019s Why\n\n\n\n\u2013 While NEO Price Explodes, These 3 Altcoins May 10x This Year\n\n\u2013 While Aptos Price Explodes, These Cryptos Might 10x in 2023\n\n\n\n\u2013 What Are Altcoins and How Do They Differ From Bitcoin?\n\n\u2013 How To Buy Altcoins"

        "content": "Solana\u2019s price has been experiencing a drop in value due to concerns that Sam Bankman-Fried and venture capital firms may sell their tokens. This has caused SOL\u2019s price to fall below $10 for the first time in over a year and a half. However, the price may be seeing a recovery due to positive comments from Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, who praised the Solana network for its development progress and thriving ecosystem.\n\nSOL must reclaim support above $10 to validate a possible V-Shaped recovery to $14.53.\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin recently tweeted about the current state of the Solana blockchain ecosystem. According to Buterin, he has been informed that there is a strong and dedicated developer community within Solana. However, he also mentioned that the fate of this community may be uncertain due to the recent exit of \u201copportunistic money\u201d seekers. Despite this, Buterin stated that he believes the Solana blockchain has a bright future.\n\nDespite being an outsider to the Solana community, Buterin expressed hope that the community will be given a fair chance to thrive.\n\nButerin\u2019s input on the Solana ecosystem has been seen as a positive sign by many in the cryptocurrency community. His endorsement could potentially pave the way for the rebirth of the once-thriving Solana community and blockchain.\n\nSolana Price Taps Fresh Liquidity Under $10, $14.53 Beckoning?\n\nSolana\u2019s price has recently fallen below a crucial support level that it has not seen since February 2021, leading to concerns of further losses. However, Vitalik Buterin\u2019s recent comments has provided some optimism for the future of the network. As a result, Solana\u2019s price has slightly rebounded and is currently trading at around $9.48, recovering slightly from a low point of $8.\n\nSOL/USD eight-hour chart\n\nBulls must throw all their weight behind SOL to reclaim support above $10 and confirm a possible buy signal from the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator.\n\nTraders will look out for the MACD (line in blue) to cross above the signal line (in red) before triggering their buy orders. The Stochastic already shows that buyers are gaining momentum as it carries on with the uptrend from the oversold area (below 20.00)) into the neutral area (between 20.00 and 80.00).\n\nA V-shaped recovery pattern will likely guide Solana price on a northbound move to $14.53, where many traders would be looking to book profits. This pattern comes into the picture after an extended downtrend leading to oversold market conditions. If SOL breaks above the falling dotted trend line, it may push to $14.53 (medium-term hurdle) and $18.82, if the momentum continues.\n\nAltcoins to Consider for Shorter Term Gains\n\nWith broader cryptocurrency markets having performed poorly in recent weeks, investors may be looking to diversify their holdings with the pre-sale tokens of promising, up-and-coming cryptocurrency projects.\n\nFightOut (FGHT) \u2013 Presale Launched\n\nThey say, \u201cit takes a community to raise a child,\u201d and FightOut believes it takes commitment and incentives to encourage a community to lead a healthy lifestyle.

Claim your free Q4 trading guide now!\n\nRecommended by Manish Jaradi Get Your Free Oil Forecast Get My Guide\n\nBITCOIN: Takes on vital resistance\n\nBitcoin continues to be well supported, now testing a formidable resistance on the 200-day moving average, roughly coinciding with the end-August high of 28150. This follows a hold last month above strong support at the June low of 24750, which has kept intact the higher-top-higher-bottom formation since the end of 2022. Importantly, this keeps alive the possibility of an extended recovery given the 2021-2022 decline and the possibility of Bitcoin shedding some of its underperformance Vs Ethereum in recent years.\n\nBTC/USD Daily Chart\n\nChart Created by Manish Jaradi Using TradingView\n\nAny decisive break above 28150 could clear the path toward the July high of 31800, which would be a significant resistance to crack. A cross-over would trigger a double bottom (the 2023 lows) and importantly reinforce the bullish medium-term trajectory, first highlighted earlier this year \u2013 see \u201cBitcoin Technical Outlook: BTC/USD Turns Bullish\u201d, published January 18.\n\nBTC/USD Vs ETH/USD Daily Chart\n\nChart Created by Manish Jaradi Using TradingView\n\nThe potential price objective of the double bottom pattern (the June and the September lows) works out to around 39000. Such a move would imply a break above the 89-week moving average and a cross above the upper edge of the Ichimoku cloud on the weekly charts \u2013 for the first time since 2022. For the bullish view to unfold, BTC/USD needs to stay above the June low of 24750.\n\n-Curious to learn how market positioning can affect asset prices? Our sentiment guide holds the insights\u2014download it now!\n\nRecommended by Manish Jaradi Improve your trading with IG Client Sentiment Data Get My Guide\n\nETHEREUM: Beginning to look vulnerable\n\nThe lack of a meaningful upward momentum in recent weeks raises the risk of Ethereum staging a secondary/lower high on the weekly charts, relative to early 2023. This would be the first time since the recovery started in late 2022 that the higher-highs-higher-lows sequence would be broken. ETH/USD in August fell below crucial support on the 200-day moving average for the first time since January.\n\nETH/USD Weekly Chart\n\nChart Created by Manish Jaradi Using TradingView\n\nAs highlighted in the previous update, the retreat from key resistance on the 89-day moving average earlier this month coupled with the subsequent fall below the June low keeps the bearish bias intact. ETH/USD is now attempting to break below the key cushion at the August low of 1550. A decisive break below could initially pave the way toward the lower edge of a downtrend channel since April (now at about 1450), potentially the October low of 1370.\n\nETH/USD Daily Chart\n\nChart Created by Manish Jaradi Using TradingView\n\nOn the weekly charts, ETH/USD has been under the influence of the bearish Ichimoku cloud cover and appears to be now succumbing to the cloud pressure. For the immediate downside risks to fade, Ethereum needs to surpass 1750, including the end of August and the early-October highs.\n\nIf you're puzzled by trading losses, why not take a step in the right direction?

We are buzzing as always weather\u2019s getting a little colder. We\u2019re almost into the fall but the pod is buzzin as always, and we have another incredible guest on the pod. Today\u2019s guest is Joel Dietz. Present day, he is the founder of MetaMetaverse. Joel is also a serial entrepreneur and intellectual historian who helped found several key initiatives in the cryptocurrency space, including Ethereum. Wow, never heard of it. Metamask ever heard of it again, the first smart contract educational channel and the first academic work on crypto-economics. His research interests focus on the confluence of blockchain network topologies, and swarm intelligence, especially how the principles undergoing decentralized organizations can be used to fuel global innovation. He also works on holonic philosophy, the evolution of jurisprudence, data-driven approaches to innovation, and smart city data architecture. Wow, I can barely read half those words there. Without further ado, I\u2019m very pleased to welcome Joel Dietz to the Cryptonews Podcast. Joel, welcome to show my friend.\n\nJoel Dietz\n\nOh, no pleasure to be here.\n\nMatt Zahab\n\nJoel, super pumped to have you on man, you have an absolutely bananas background. I got to start with Ethereum and MetaMask. These are applications pieces of software, very powerful that I use almost every single day. I couldn\u2019t imagine navigating web3 without Metamask. When you and the team built this founded this, did you ever think that this would play such an integral part of web3?\n\nJoel Dietz\n\nOh, yeah, it wasn\u2019t, you know, the first you know, working group Skype groups. And I think we talked about the flip bidding back then, you know, the day that the market cap of Ethereum would flip that a Bitcoin. So I don\u2019t know why. But it just feels like there was on the day the white paper came out there were at least 20 or 30 of us that were convinced basically of this, this would happen. And we fed off of each other so.\n\nMatt Zahab\n\nAnd can you walk me through like the process of creating? Let\u2019s start with ETH, for example. What was that, like any crazy stories with Vitalik, any, any stories that you would love to tell, you know, 30 years down the road to perhaps the average Joe or Josephine wouldn\u2019t be cognizant of?\n\nJoel Dietz\n\nYeah, I mean, first of all, I\u2019ll say that, you know, there were probably 50 people involved in the early days of Ethereum. And most of us were engineers by training. And most of the work that needed to be done to build Ethereum was the engineering side of it. So there was so much to be built. And I contributed a little bit, but mainly on the educational side, and kind of bring awareness and building some of the first channels to in that area. So and just in general, it was it was interesting, because sometimes you find something that is so intuitive to you, but then it\u2019s actually kind of somehow hard to explain, you know, to other people. And I worked really hard on that. Because, you know, for at least a while I was the person spending the most effort on trying to educate people who were, you know, necessarily not as technical as some of the core Devs. That\u2019s it.\n\nMatt Zahab\n\nThat must have been nightmare fuel back in the day educating people on Ethereum. Like, what did that pitch even sound like? But what was the most of the one liner? What was the elevator pitch? How would you convince people that we created this, you know, bonkers cryptocurrency, and it\u2019s gonna be the future.\n\nJoel Dietz\n\nYeah, as you probably picked up just from my scripts, I have a bit of academic disposition. And I suppose like to talk about it from the aspect of the nature of money and what money is, you know, and I often said, you know, that, basically, you know, Bitcoin was the first digitization of money, where you could basically transfer some value to one person. And then, you know, Ethereum was the first programmable money. So basically, if I have a token that represents a value, whether it\u2019s a bottle of beer, or a crystal or a gold coin, but then I can put instructions inside of it and say, Okay, now go to Matt after 10 minutes, or now go to Matt after 10 minutes if Atlas says yes, and that sort of idea of building program logic into currency had basically never been done before. And that opens up a whole lot of different possibilities, including new types of organizations, you know, new types of funding DAOs and I could go on for a long time about DAOs, but usually don\u2019t try to do that on the first conversation or at least first few sentences.\n\nMatt Zahab\n\nOh, yeah. Well, we\u2019ll get to DAOs later is still a very trendy topic and a lot of people are very, very much so butchering DAOs nowadays, where it\u2019s still a almost completely centralized organization whole not a lot of autonomy either, but again, we\u2019ll get into that. We\u2019ll jump back into ETH in a couple minutes but I want to move over to Metamask. Metamask is just absolutely incredible. It\u2019s one of the best things about crypto in my opinion. It\u2019s so easy to house everything right from your browser or right from your mobile device. One of the best logos in the space to I have a kinship and love for that little orange Fox, what was it like building this application? Did you guys think that it would be something that people use every single day right now?\n\nJoel Dietz\n\nUm, it\u2019s good question. You know, to me, it was kind of an obvious thing, basically, at DEVCON zero, that people would consume dApps primarily through the browser, I think I was the only person who thought that, but I managed to convince Vitalik. Obviously, influential, and who had some control over the dev grants program, and I also managed to convince Gavin wood. So that was basically the formal birth. And I guess, later on, Joe Lubin was convinced, maybe six months after that, or something. So the Yeah, kind of formal process behind that was just kind of I don\u2019t know, somehow, somehow obvious to me. Now, you know, how to get from A to B. Again, like lots of engineering effort involved. Thankfully, I, my career has been as an engineer for the most part. So I, I can estimate that and know, roughly speaking, like what fits together. But yeah, I, as to the specifics, you know, we did kind of say that to the Y Combinator people in the in the interview, you know, that this was like a big thing. And Ethereum was a big thing. And smart contracts were a big thing. And they kind of were skeptical, you know, so it was it was kind of an uphill battle, even with these kind of, like, you know, reasonably respectable and smart VCs in Silicon Valley at the time, who, I guess didn\u2019t take Ethereum very seriously, back in, I guess, mid 2015 or something?\n\nMatt Zahab\n\nProbably a small regret on their end. What How did you convince Vitalik that Metamask would be so important than having a browser based extension? Would be the spot where most people would house all their ERC 20 tokens with that combo sound like because again, you what you just said, Joel, is you were like, Oh, it was, you know, so obvious to me, and I\u2019m sure it was, you\u2019re very switched on dude. But like, clearly, it wasn\u2019t obvious to anyone else. But how did you had you? Had you pitch them? How do you close them?\n\nJoel Dietz\n\nI guess I don\u2019t know, kind of, like, I\u2019ll say aggressive closing style. But I think I was also the only person at DEVCON zero who was doing like CrossFit in the morning. Like, basically, I went up every morning to, you know, do you know, my burpees and pull ups and stuff before the rest of everyone was doing their technical talks? And you know, there\u2019s just a certain, you know, like, let\u2019s go, let\u2019s go kind of mentality that comes out of that particular like, performance fitness crew. And, you know, I guess I\u2019ve been I know, somehow I\u2019m ingrain that over time. And so I always try to push things forward at the pace that, you know, I wanted to, which often isn\u2019t the pace that other institutions are ready to go, but actually, interestingly enough, Vitalik when he stayed at my house, and Silicon Valley, did CrossFit with us kind of exercises in the morning, so I guess a little bit of that exposure, and maybe it was even from the aspect of him having done that, that he was like, you know, whatever Joel is doing he\u2019s probably serious about it. No.\n\nMatt Zahab\n\nLook, I I\u2019m in I\u2019m in no position to turn Vitalik he\u2019s the GOAT but like, I can\u2019t see him in his noodle arms doing CrossFit. Like.\n\nJoel Dietz\n\nInteresting thing to see. I kind of wish I could do it honestly. And I didn\u2019t expect him to like get up in the morning and come join us for our little CrossFit routine. But he did so props to Vitalik.\n\nMatt Zahab\n\nYou know how viral that would go today that\u2019s like him with his you know, with his hammer in his pants, the classic photo that went viral about a month ago. You know, the one I\u2019m talking about? With his long present in his pants if that was a schlong if it was good for him. He\u2019s got a healthy one. But yeah, you don\u2019t know that what it went like that without that break the internet Vitalik doing CrossFit? Are you kidding me? And it\u2019s like PJ\u2019s are in a crazy Vitalik outfit was noodle arms.\n\nJoel Dietz\n\nI really have some interesting things if you say goodbye, you know repository of photos and videos from that time period. I don\u2019t know I mean, I didn\u2019t really go back and search but.\n\nMatt Zahab\n\nThat\u2019d be a good NFT collection you know OG Vitalik NFT collection.\n\nJoel Dietz\n\nOh, yeah. Good point. Yeah, for sure.\n\nMatt Zahab\n\nThat could pop off while I\u2019m I still don\u2019t know why and this is quite perverse, but I\u2019m just trying to picture what it would look like doing CrossFit. Anyways, back to show here. Metamask so many people have been asking about a Metamask token. Everyone wants it, you know, good old cheeky airdrops similar to you know, an ENS type AirDrop, where you buy a couple domains, and here\u2019s a couple 1000 bucks, including love that that was incredible. Will we ever see a Metamask token?\n\nJoel Dietz\n\nSo I do have to clarify. So I haven\u2019t been involved really in Metamask for five years or whatever. So and the way Joe Lubin tells this story, is he hired them the devs basically into consensus, and then they started rebuilding effectively the project a second time. So I don\u2019t really have any involvement with it currently, and I wish them success in whatever they do. I do hope they, you know, whatever credit me appropriately with the tokens that are planning to issue and all of that, but not, you know, everyone has the same respect, I guess, for founders out there. So.\n\nMatt Zahab\n\nI mean, in your, in your opinion, Joel, like, do you think it would be good for the ecosystem to launch some type of governance token that would almost act as a DAO?\n\nJoel Dietz\n\nWell, it\u2019s so is it as you bring this up today, because I was just reviewing some of this legal paperwork that we had for Metamask. And, and other people were actually picking up on some of the things because we had a few different legal conferences, specifically around this topic back in like 2015, as to how to do like DAO collaborative DAO governance. And in fact, that original governance contracts of Metamask had this embedded in it. So there was like, a collaborative, you know, basically token voting system to decide how the project would evolve. And I think for certain types of community projects, it makes a lot of sense of baby to early when it\u2019s an early stage. But, you know, Metamask is like, it could go in different directions. Obviously, it has an enterprise version of it. And I think, you know, having a private enterprise thing is great, frankly, you know, custodial wallets, all of that. But the, you know, the community driven things, I think there\u2019s a point in kind of turning at least certain aspects of things over the community, once something reaches a certain scale. So I will be super supportive of Metamask, kind of going back in that direction, and maybe even returning to some of these original legal contracts.\n\nMatt Zahab\n\nInteresting.\n\nJoel Dietz\n\nThere\u2019s a legal scholars, you know, from around the world that were really pushing this sort of integration between collaborative governance and DAOs basically, we call it\u2019s called the DCO at the time, and it kind of got off the ground, but never like, fully with like, you know, a reasonable sized project.\n\nMatt Zahab\n\nThat would be the hardest AirDrop present day, whether I guess we\u2019re an Opensea and Opensea or Metamask token that would break web three, in the best of ways possible.\n\nJoel Dietz\n\nWell, yeah, I mean, who knows, maybe the current dev team of Metamask is still open and interested in those more, you know, collaborative side of things. I know that, that the consensus, as you know, organization has kind of gone in and out of it a little bit, you know, but there are hard things to do. So, you know, to pull off, like, appropriately. And it goes back to the DAO question you mentioned before, like DAO has become really centralized, it\u2019s very easy to, you know, control things from behind the scenes. I think that\u2019s kind of one of the things that people have said and some of the, you know, I don\u2019t say like people blacken Ethereum\u2019s reputation from time to time. But you know, the, the story of what\u2019s actually going on versus like, what\u2019s happening behind the scenes is, you know, sometimes it seems like there\u2019s a bit of a gap there. So.\n\nMatt Zahab\n\nYou\u2019re bang on there. That\u2019s getting very interesting. Can we see what happens there? Let\u2019s move forward and jump into your new project. MetaMetaverse. Absolutely popping off you once. Perhaps all in is the wrong word. But you\u2019ve put a lot of eggs in this basket. What before we get into metal Metaverse itself? What tickles your fancy so much about the metaverse? Why? Why go all in on the metaverse and 2022?\n\nJoel Dietz\n\nWell, I like to say Metaverse is three different tracks, I think I explained is different from everyone else out there. So full disclosure, but one of them is you know, tokens web three, like all that governance, like that kind of stuff. Another one is like AR VR, like gaming experiences and stuff like that. And another one is basically the neuroscience of the brain and psychedelic research and all those things where we like tap into the brain and how it works and kind of get integrated at that level.\n\nMatt Zahab\n\nInteresting. That\u2019s I haven\u2019t heard that take before.\n\nJoel Dietz\n\nYeah, no one, as far as I know, really explains it that way. But those are the convergence of interests that brought me into wanting to do things into metaverse. And it\u2019s partially because I see Metaverse at some fundamental level even a philosophical level as like form of communication, where basically we go from a lossy form of communication, and on unreliable form of communication to something that is like highly upgraded and has a lot more visual density and other kind of like density associated with it.\n\nMatt Zahab\n\nOkay, you just made my head spin here, Joel, and in the best of ways. Normally I would start with numero uno, but let\u2019s go straight to numero tres. The psychological psychedelic, sort of all up in the brain that you talked about. Can you go into the depths on that? Like, are we talking neuro link, are we talking, you know, micro dosing psilocybin or LSD or other psychedelic compounds to tap into the metaverse like, Give me Give me your thesis on this, I\u2019m very intrigued by this.\n\nJoel Dietz\n\nYeah, so I just go back to communication or, you know, extended, you know, states of consciousness. But, you know, say you were able to visualize something in your brain, right, and you\u2019re like, I want to share this with you, usually 99.9%, meeting our eyes together does not actually allow you to share the idea. But you have like this pink version of the Eiffel Tower in your head, and you really want me to see it, right. So now we could draw it, if I get communicated verbally, but if it\u2019s something like you don\u2019t know what the Eiffel Tower is, and I start saying, hey, it\u2019s a pink version of the Eiffel Tower, like, it\u2019s not going to get across, right, so and the more complex, the idea is, the more challenging it is for basically me to get it from my, you know, brain into your brain. And, and there are various forms of communicating. Now, psychedelics are kind of in that direction, but they\u2019re kind of unreliable, like, you take a psychedelic, and I think the psychedelic, and we\u2019re gonna have wildly varying experiences. And unless we spend a lot of time drawing them, it\u2019s gonna be hard to see, you know, where they overlap. Whereas virtual reality, on the other hand, you put on a headset that I handed to you, you put it on, we\u2019re gonna have basically the same experience, and be able to then communicate it afterwards or, you know, translate it into something. So, you know, I think that\u2019s one of the benefits. And again, use something like neuro link, and, you know, we\u2019re still digging into the kind of brain thing, but if I can do the same thing, you know, with a more direct kind of neuron based stimulus, or I\u2019ve seen the ones that use, you know, facial muscles, and things like that, to do various control mechanisms. It\u2019s accelerating, that basically, it\u2019s allowing for more rapid and reliable communication about complex objects.\n\nMatt Zahab\n\nHow far away are we, from this becoming a reality, like, you know, like you and I being able to stare into each other\u2019s eyes, and me being able to know that you\u2019re thinking of a pink Eiffel Tower.\n\nJoel Dietz\n\nUm, I think as well as thank you know, that they exist, but it\u2019s not like widely distributed, you know, and there\u2019s various forms of getting there. But I would say that I could guess like, maybe 15 years to a consumer product. So like, within our lifetimes, would be my guess. And even then it\u2019s probably likely to be like a high end consumer project. Yeah. But there\u2019s probably some low level versions that will be there much sooner. You know, for example, like, if I can use my patiently, just saying, Not non hand motions, whatever else, and I have some pre loaded things, you know, in like a version of Google Glass or whatever the next kind of version of that is. And then I can basically toggle and say, hey, you know, this is, from the set of ideas I have, and communicate, I think we\u2019re gonna get there much, much quicker. But it will be like, let\u2019s say, a more limited vocabulary where I have, you know, like, right, there\u2019s like, all these games, you know, there\u2019s like, 10 common commands that everyone uses it over and over again, I think we\u2019ll kind of see like, that version happened, the quickest, probably.\n\nMatt Zahab\n\nOkay, so that was number three. And again, you blew my mind there. Number one was, you said, the tokens and the sharing of information and financial assets, right? And tying those two together? How does one and three, how do they intertwine?\n\nJoel Dietz\n\nUm, well, basically, we\u2019ve got this meta URL system, it\u2019s to address like, basically any type of experience. So it could be something and effectively, right now, it was what works for any kind of Euclidean space, which basically means like all of normal physics, and spaces in the physical Earth, or faces and different metalverses, but anything that\u2019s sort of like a 3d space, we can address it basically. And we can create a unique string URL, basically, that applies to that space. And, and we can basically extend the same concept of space into other types of experiences, like smells and pheromones and more difficult to, like, visualize their C version of it. And the benefit of this basically, is making it accessible and universalizability effectively, so we can, you know, communicate about the same things, if that makes sense.\n\nMatt Zahab\n\nLike, how, how would you tie an address to a smell.\n\nJoel Dietz\n\nUm, that\u2019s, you know, among the more tricky things, you know, but basically, you know, once I have this concept of this URL, string string, I mean, sometimes it\u2019s not that different from like, what IPFS has and things like that. Um, Then I can basically drop a payload in it. And then to specify, you know, right now for we do this already, basically for what rendering engine is needed to render the experience. So we support natively Unreal Engine five, which is the best one for kind of visual assets, and then the file type, you know, and, you know, basically anything that is a smell, or pheromone, or whatever else would still have the concept of a rendering engine, we\u2019re only a certain type of machine basically, that can take that, you know, let\u2019s say, let\u2019s take a slightly simpler example, like you are going into a space in a Metaverse, you know, called Sandbox, Decentraland, you know, one of our kind of meta verses on our platform. And there, you want there to be a blue mist, right? So misters are a technology that exists, right, you have misters, they, they\u2019re connected to current audio visual systems. And, you know, you can push a button on a, you know, standard mixing board and get your login, you know, whatever, smoke smoke machine to start puffing up smoke. So all you need to do basically is take that same technology is already developed, and integrate it into the localized version of it. So instead of just being like, I push the button and the smoke comes out into the whatever, DJ booth, you know, venue, I basically walk into a space, let\u2019s say in Sandbox, and then boom, like all those blue smoke starts like pouring over my, you know, little home office. And that is actually not that hard to build like that technology all exists, it just kind of needs this little glue in between. And the glue in between basically goes from a 3d spatial experience all the way to the you know, spectrum of all of these other that\u2019s a non visual experiences that people are having, and don\u2019t necessarily have an easy way of cataloging right now.\n\nMatt Zahab\n\nSo your digitizing experiences.\n\nJoel Dietz\n\nYeah, I think that\u2019s great way of describing it. Yeah. making them accessible, making them universalize usable.\n\nMatt Zahab\n\nYeah. Crazy.\n\nJoel Dietz\n\nI\u2019m like the Aristotle of experience.\n\nMatt Zahab\n\nWow, so many different things. I want to ask you, but y\u2019all, we don\u2019t have enough time. Geez. Okay. I want to it seems like, again, reading your bio lurking your Twitter. You love history. Like you, you have a huge history Boehner, I can tell I\u2019m a history guy myself nowhere. I know 1,000,000th of what you know, most likely, but how does your knowledge of history impact the decisions you make present day? Because it seems like a lot of what you do present day, just from hearing you speak watching and listening to you from other interviews, you know, lurking your Twitter lurking a lot of the content that you\u2019ve released online, I can\u2019t really piece it together. But it seems like your love and passion and knowledge of history has a lot of impact on your present day thinking. Can you try to explain that? And my apologies for throwing words in your mouth is a difficult question. But how does that impact you today?\n\nJoel Dietz\n\nWell, I\u2019ll give one very clear example that relates to the world of crypto, you know, my first response when, you know, reading about Bitcoin back in whatever 2010 was to get a bunch of books about the history of financial systems and markets and how they developed. And I probably read, you know, a couple dozen of them before deciding what to do. And I wouldn\u2019t say my sense of market timing has always been the best, by the way, or maybe like a good historian, maybe not always the best entrepreneur when it comes to hitting the market at the right time. But I basically decided that, you know, it was very similar to what happened when the stock markets were created. And that, you know, cryptocurrency is a lot like equity. But when people first started putting numbers in, you know, Mississippi company shares on paper, people just kind of made up valuations for it, and, you know, pumped them and then, you know, did some other kind of like nasty things as well behind the scenes, you know, where they basically create the fake value companies, and then, you know, whatever shot the journalists or whatever it were basically trying to say, like this company was actually this, like, everyone\u2019s this literally happened, the King of France, you know, basically loved the Mississippi company, because it bailed him out of his own debt. And he wasn\u2019t respected by the aristocrats at that point. But the problem was at the Mississippi company was like, all the people were dying in the swamp, and they would write back letters to France saying, Hey, we\u2019re dying in the swamp, like nothing, there\u2019s no gold here. But did you promise us blah, blah, blah. And then the king of France basically said, like, don\u2019t print those letters. So no one in France could find out what was really going on in Mississippi. So it kind of creates this, you know, crypto economics, so it\u2019s all about incentives, but it can create a skewed sense of incentive sometimes where the king of France was like very incentivized, basically to prevent anyone from figuring out what was actually going on in Mississippi. So, I have been really bullish about crypto and blockchain and the kind and overall idea of crypto economics, but slightly less bullish on the first implementation of it, which I think sometimes the, you know, incentives need to be calibrated, right. And just one core thing that\u2019s part of that, too, also a lesson from history is that people don\u2019t care about money that much like it\u2019s it, they care about it, but not the only thing they care about. And people want to get to a certain level of wealth maybe and, you know, obviously, some people really like showing off their wealth, other people, it doesn\u2019t really matter to them. But the, you know, it\u2019s not the core consideration of everyone on this planet. And they, at some point, like live life in a fuller sense and giving, you know, other things. So another kind of cool story, if I, if I\u2019m allowed to go further, is actually in one of these old Bitcoin lists right now, where I was laying there cheerleading some of the stuff in the Ukraine, I\u2019m actually very actively involved in supporting Ukrainians on the ground through kind of various means. But I personally believe that, you know, the healthy political system, and thing is when people are actively involved in supporting each other people who value freedom, basically. And that\u2019s the only way that freedom survives, is by you know, people coming together to support freedom. And, you know, it wasn\u2019t not everyone was agreeing with me, let\u2019s just say that they were silent. There were, you know, obviously, some voices, but, you know, other people like Curtis, Dr. Van, who you may know, is quite well known for, you know, his stuff and Irbid and popularizing Bitcoin stuff. Basically, the camo the opposite opinion saying, supporting Ukraine as a bunch of feel good ism, and it doesn\u2019t matter. And let\u2019s just let those people go and sit on our Bitcoins, you know, you know, differences of opinion, basically, but serious ones, and they affect, you know, our future political reality, and including which one we live in personally, you know, do you live with people who love freedom, and are willing to pay for it? Or do you live with people who want to sit on their Bitcoins, and you know, a deal with the rest of the world as little as possible?\n\nMatt Zahab\n\nVery, very well said there. I absolutely love, one. I\u2019m a big story guy. And the king of France and Mississippi Corp. is it Mississippi Corp, Mississippi?\n\nJoel Dietz\n\nThe company I think very French name you know, read it in French. Can\u2019t say.\n\nMatt Zahab\n\nMississippi company, that\u2019s such a good story and one that will stick with me so thanks for telling that. Yeah, any couple more questions on history for a sec? Because that was a great little spiel there. What are your favorite resources to learn? Are you like Dan Carlin Hardcore History guy, what\u2019s the best spot to get some good bite sized nuggets on history?\n\nJoel Dietz\n\nWhoo. Um, you know what I just fell in love with recently. It\u2019s kind of it\u2019s like intellectual history. But these graphic guides for among other things, there\u2019s like I just read a graphic Guide to lecan I read a graphic guide to Hegel, I read a graphic guide and Nietzsche prep guide on Nazism. I read a graphic guide on like, you know, whatever, four or five other topics, and they all presented the topics quite clearly and give you like pointers to go and other things and they\u2019re all free on Kindle Unlimited, so I was, yeah.\n\nMatt Zahab\n\nInteresting. I was just gonna ask Where can I find those Kindle Unlimited, okay, shadowed Amazon. Lovely Joel. We\u2019re gonna take a quick break give a massive shout out to a response to show PrimeXBT.

Now back to the show with Joel who\u2019s been dropping absolute knowledge bombs and alpha bombs left right and center. Joel, this has been an absolute treatment. Let\u2019s keep us in here. Back to the metaverse for a sec. Potential the metaverse it\u2019s 2022. It\u2019s been around for a couple years. Last year was probably the first year where we really saw things take off mind you there still aren\u2019t really any true metaverses that are fully playable at the moment. I know Sandbox has the alpha out. I know Decentraland is playable. I know there are experiences in both of them but it\u2019s not good enough to get the masses in what is the potential the metaverse What do you think the future looks like next year? A couple years down the road. 2030 Give us some hot takes here.\n\nJoel Dietz\n\nYeah, to be perfectly honest, I don\u2019t spend that much time on the other metaversus BMZ because I have like an obsessive personality and I like perfecting our own kind of product as much as people as as possible. And I\u2019m a gamer so it\u2019s like the fusion like gaming you know and all these things is very exciting to me, but it also kind of raises the bar a little bit as far as what gamers are used to when it comes to experiences. But I will give some, you know, little bits and one of them as, like, I think we\u2019re gonna, we\u2019re gonna have a little for sure, I hope someone else is working on the same thing or maybe we work together but procedurally generated manner versus where you can like basically go in and the similar to what you can do in like mid journey or some of these AI things and say, I want a Metaverse that has, you know, three planets and, you know, a starship and whatever, or, you know, Star cruiser and this other thing, and then it will kind of spin it up for you. And then you know, I mean, kind of there\u2019s like, similar thing like squiggles or whatever some of these generative art projects, but like the 3d immersive, interactive, you know, kind of version of those things. And of that working right now that I built, and this is like, why don\u2019t go out sometimes, because I\u2019m like, here like.\n\nMatt Zahab\n\nThat is bonkers. So walk me through that. I literally I type in what I want, or I would do a couple lines of code. And the AI generator was the metaverse AI generator will spit out a Metaverse based on what I want.\n\nJoel Dietz\n\nYeah, exactly. So and we have this cool, like practical ideas. So basically, like, you know, you have a planet inside your Metaverse, and you can subdivide that planet and sell real estate on your planet. You can build cities, you can like keep going, you know, and we support, you know, whatever, uploading all the content to IPFS or wherever you want to store it. We\u2019re on our own servers, but you know, you can design the whole metaverse.\n\nMatt Zahab\n\nSo so so this is this is a side project of yours, which is essentially the Shopify of metaverses.\n\nJoel Dietz\n\nYeah, I guess you could call our platform like the Shopify of metaverses like, we\u2019re gonna make it really accessible for people to get their own technology there. And, and, you know, in theory, anyone can put all their own content in there. But we wanted to give people the option of basically pre populating their Metaverse with some kind of content. And, you know, originally was just like, here\u2019s a planet or whatever, here\u2019s a floating island or something like that. But then I got, you know, I would say, carried away by my own idea of what we could do. And I\u2019d actually, I basically, I was sitting with a professor at Harvard, whose name was Peter super who invented gnomic, which is like this super old school like gaming category where you win points basically, based on the, how you change the rules of the game. So it\u2019s like, a super nerdy game, basically. And, and he had the idea basically, of taking it and turning it into this like, Conway\u2019s Game of Life on steroids. I don\u2019t know if you know, you know, Conway\u2019s Game of Life?\n\nMatt Zahab\n\nI don\u2019t, I don\u2019t.\n\nJoel Dietz\n\nAnyways, it\u2019s like this. Basically, it was used as a screensaver on all the supercomputers back when they were first building the first version. And it\u2019s the simple rules basically, for changing the cells that are alive and die. And usually a 2d grid, although there\u2019s, you know, 3d and sort of multiple dimensional versions available. And it looks cool. And it\u2019s kind of has these like life forms, basically, that are kind of evolving in front of your eyes. So it\u2019s very cool to look at. But no one kind of took it to like the next level basically, where it could be like fully interactive, and you could like insert your own algorithms and see how these things evolve in this kind of 3d space and gotten one Scott going. I was like, this is super cool.\n\nMatt Zahab\n\nSo you\u2019re a perfectionist. I can just tell once you once you start you dial in and there\u2019s nothing stopping you.\n\nJoel Dietz\n\nYeah, so there\u2019s probably again this like it\u2019s some kind of weird thing I have this extra I mean, I learned Mandarin when I was young, you know and it took so much time of copying these you know, characters and stuff like that. But you know, after I got through that, I basically felt like I could do that like enough persistence, you know, you just kind of keep on going keep on going and then maybe that CrossFit stuff on top of it also means that you like really put yourself into something once you\u2019re once you\u2019re in the middle of it so yeah, and I mean, I love this kind of stuff too. Like the comp is gaming that got me into programming you know so with that and so when I get the confluence of these two things coming together I just like I light up I get so happy.\n\nMatt Zahab\n\nFolks for those listening and who aren\u2019t watching this Joel has literally been smiling while speaking for this, you know, for the last 36 minutes. So it\u2019s an absolute treat to see someone so fired up about, you know, passionate about something they do. Joel, let\u2019s keep an eye on Metaverse is here. I know you guys are helping a lot of businesses come in and you know, create their own do their own ish within the metaverse which businesses in particular can benefit the most from the metaverse.\n\nJoel Dietz\n\nUm, I think probably I don\u2019t know sir No, no think of like a government you know, as a business but I did read apologies network state. I think it\u2019s definitely in like kind of right direction of kind of evolution. And in general, I\u2019m a fan of his writings. And I think that basically and when we got this actually inbound, I gave a talk at the World Government Summit before about metaverses and I basically said, like, governance needs to be fun. Like, it needs to be engaging, like you need to actually have some something for people to do. And especially if you\u2019re going after, like, civic engagement, how can people engage more, you know, and be like, like Metaverse, like, I think, for people to have actual and control over and help evolve. So I think that\u2019s going to be maybe the biggest thing overall meant might take a little bit longer to go, you know, because, you know, governments aren\u2019t necessarily known for, like, doing things quickly. But, you know, I think people like biology will help with their own kind of micro governments. And I think there\u2019s, you know, a lot of other things, too, real estate is kind of an obvious one, like, and I\u2019m, I\u2019m a huge fan of, in general, take your 2d architectural rendering, and turn it into an interactive experience, you know, if you want to sell something, it\u2019s maybe like, you know, not obligatory today, but it probably will be in five years where everyone will be used to like wanting to go on a virtual tour of the apartment or booking before they do it. And you want to be on the front end of that curve. And interestingly enough, like in my little weird break between like my version of web3 today, and what I did web3, and like 2014 2015, I built some, you know, virtual reality demoing, you know, real estate, demoing apps and stuff like that. So.\n\nMatt Zahab\n\nThat\u2019s, I always think of Airbnb, whenever I think of this magic, how cool it would be to walk through the place you\u2019re about to stay at, or would potentially choose to stay up for booking. And then just like the actual real estate, you\u2019ve talked about, let\u2019s say you want to buy a rental home somewhere or a vacation home, and you can\u2019t fly across the world to go do that. You\u2019re there. Yeah, it\u2019s no different than what sort of COVID is done to, to the job, you know, industry in industry, wrong word, but marketplace where it\u2019s like now, every single job in the world, most of them, you don\u2019t have to be in person. It\u2019s global. It\u2019s pretty decentralized, and the talent pool has gotten infinite, the times bigger and same thing can happen with that. Very interesting point there. What do you think is the right time for most businesses to jump in? Seemed like last year was sort of the just because of the FOMO. There was so much feel like it slowed down a little. Yes, there are still bigger companies like Starbucks Polygon announcement, which is massive. But what do you think is when you think is the right time for these fortune 500 companies to start joining the party and getting on the dance floor?\n\nJoel Dietz\n\nWell, apparently, they you know, all are to some degree, and they\u2019re aware and they have plans and stuff like that. At least that\u2019s what the I think ladies PwC Survey said. But you know, there\u2019s a good reason to do an activation in like a name brand metaverse. I think Sandbox is the first people, you know, when people go to these days or Decentraland. But there\u2019s also a huge reason to go where the users are, which is more than like a Roblox thing. And Gucci. And some other people have done that. And then, you know, there\u2019s a whole another reason. And you mentioned this earlier to go where the visual quality and quality of the experience is going to be the highest. And I think that\u2019s where we plan to kind of differentiate, and then you know, kind of use that obviously to grow our user base and everything else. But I just, I have been kind of out in space, but I do love voxel art and stuff like that. But yeah, I don\u2019t like it all the time. Once you\u2019ve gone through the, you know, triple A gaming experience and cinematic virtual reality experiences, it sometimes feels a little bit underwhelming.\n\nMatt Zahab\n\nYeah, it\u2019s, it\u2019s tough. It\u2019s just, it doesn\u2019t seem I can\u2019t really put a finger on it. It\u2019s so qualitative, you know, but it\u2019s just it\u2019s tough to grasp and conceptualize living in a world with such you know, outdated visuals and art. Whereas just like you said, these triple A gaming studios have it\u2019s real, like I saw gameplay footage for the new FIFA I think this week I saw it, it literally looks like the freedom game. And then there\u2019s, you know, again, nothing against Sandbox or Decentraland or anything like that. They\u2019re all incredible companies but just doesn\u2019t do it for a lot of people. And that\u2019s it for a lot of the people who aren\u2019t in crypto I feel like that\u2019s one of the biggest nags at the moment is that they\u2019re like we can\u2019t be living in some world with watercolor you know with Pixlr but it is what it is to teach the wrong job. Joel, this is an absolutely incredible man you have just literally taught me so much and put a smile on my face this whole time. There\u2019s a segment on the show called the hot take factory and I feel like you could make an absolute living in half being the hot take factory give me some Joel Dietz takes doesn\u2019t have to be crypto related can be health, wealth, happiness, nutrition, you name it. I know you have a bunch of them, let them fly. I want to hear some.\n\nJoel Dietz\n\nOh, well, I think you know Uh, you know, rest in peace to God Save the Queen, all that but I do think the world is ready for, you know, some new kind of like royalty basically like, I think there\u2019s an interesting thing of the European royalty and what they use to serve the role they used to serve. And then you know, someone was like torn apart during communism, a lot of stuff was basically stripped away a lot of the things and then when democracy took over, so to speak, I don\u2019t know, they just kind of, they didn\u2019t actually adjust itself that well, and Eastern Europe. So I\u2019m very actively following the things that are happening in Ukraine, because I think Ukraine is potentially going to be able to establish a new kind of political and social model around some of these things. So and it\u2019s also like a history buff thing, but you get the combination of new political systems military history, like all this stuff, kind of happening there, and a hawk hot pocket, I personally will be in Kyiv. Basically, as, as soon as I can be, I do have some other obligations here. But we have a lot of developers there and a great stuff on the ground. So very excited about that. Um, and I don\u2019t know, I just, the possibilities are always mind blowing to me. And similar what you said before, but like, there\u2019s certainly the delicate, you know, effort of weaving different kinds of technology together. But I love that I\u2019m kind of, you know, a little bit on the architect D kind of side of things. And another just really cool thing, like, I think Stephen Wolfram new work is amazing. I don\u2019t know if you know much about him, but I think he\u2019s maybe the greatest or if not one of the greatest physicists of our time, and including on this kind of multi computation thing. And his more recent book on the fundamentals, kind of theory of physics, I think, is just potentially extremely groundbreaking, I was really blown away by his concept of the ruli ad and how we do some of this modeling. So if you want to get to like the super, you know, I\u2019ll say nerdy, esoteric, complex side event. I mean, read about that, and engage, we\u2019re actually going to bring on a roulette fellow to work between us and the Wolfram Institute on some of these topics. Because, so, so fascinating. And we\u2019re going to open up a whole lot as week somebody who\u2019s like, rethink some of the concepts in physics, that I think we\u2019ve like, overly accepted. Yeah, including potentially simulating them in virtual environments, which is also very exciting.\n\nMatt Zahab\n\nI have heard him before but Joel, that is so far above my paygrade like, I\u2019m, I\u2019m not even in that arena, like I, you know, I got my grade 11 physics after that it was, you know. I\u2019m good.\n\nJoel Dietz\n\nI will say from my side, I basically didn\u2019t study physics formally. It\u2019s kind of like the sad thing in my head, but I have a lot of respect for people who, who did. I love education, and I love children\u2019s education specifically, and how you learn concepts, you know, that and physics, I think, is one of those things that lends itself well to being kind of reimagined in virtual environments, because you can learn the rules of physics, you know, by experiencing them and you know, how cool would that be? I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m just whenever I think.\n\nMatt Zahab\n\nGive me good resource if I want to, if I want a little physics reading, where should I start? Or what YouTube videos or podcasts like literally for beginner like I\u2019m talking high school level physics I need to start right from square one right from minus one kind of thing. What\u2019s a good place to start?\n\nJoel Dietz\n\nI\u2019m putting us back because I know what Stephens like latest things are, but I don\u2019t really know what is the most easy we\u2019re gonna get going but what maybe read his article Stephen Wolfram\u2019s article on games. And because he put that out recently, and it shows, even with kind of relatively simple games, like Tic Tac Toe, how you can model all of the different permutations of that game. And then the implications of kind of modeling that which, you know, is very interesting. Maybe I\u2019ll write something on that myself about how that relates to like, the multiverse or concepts like that, because.\n\nMatt Zahab\n\nI\u2019d love that.\n\nJoel Dietz\n\nI\u2019m, oh, did you watch Arrival by any chance that film Arrival like a sci fi film these like aliens show up. And then basically, humans have to coordinate to like, figure out what their messages are, you know, without blowing up each other. And then actually design the language that the aliens used in that film. So that is actually a very good like, kind of approach point. Because it\u2019s, it\u2019s kind of interesting conceptually as well. Like, include your question like, if aliens are communicating to us, what language would they use? And you know, how would they basically trying to be introducing to us.\n\nMatt Zahab\n\nHe\u2019s thought of that. Wow, crazy. Joel, I want to go back to the New World royalty for a sec. Who would it be and what country could potentially be the new world royalty?\n\nJoel Dietz\n\nUm, I don\u2019t. Exactly. I am a huge fan. No memes. I know it\u2019s a side topic. But I do think that like, we sort of catapulted you know, memes into this, you know, new I don\u2019t know, financial and social identity. And education.\n\nMatt Zahab\n\nIt\u2019s powerful people, people get it right away, it makes them laugh, it hits them hard sticks with you, love them, keep going.\n\nJoel Dietz\n\nAnd just along those lines, I hope was kind of like, you know, some thought experiment in my mind, but I would hope that the new form of you know, royalty, so to speak, would actually be kind of in this meme sphere, you know, where it basically like, is not so serious. Maybe I just don\u2019t want it to be serious, but I don\u2019t know. I like I like memes.\n\nMatt Zahab\n\nYeah, I love that. Joel, incredible episode, man. I\u2019d love to have you on for round two. I need on for round two, because we just scratched the surface here. I can tell that you have so much more to give, and I would love to get that out of you. Thanks. Thank you so much for coming on. Before you go. Can you please let our listeners know where they can find you? And MetaMetaverse, online and on socials.\n\nJoel Dietz\n\nYeah, Metametaverse.io My Twitter is @JDietz. And yeah, Joel Dietz My name is gonna Google me I guess.\n\nMatt Zahab\n\nYou got it, Joel. Thanks again, man. Absolutely incredible episode, you absolutely crushed this. And next time I\u2019m in Dubai, I will hit you up. I would love to go to dinner and actually get to meet you in person. But until then, wishing you the team all the best. And looking forward to the next time.\n\nJoel Dietz\n\nYou should come to our Metaverse arcade. We\u2019ll have it set up by them. I\u2019m actually doing all that stuff right now. While their desk is like all these controllers and stuff.\n\nMatt Zahab\n\nOh wow, amazing. Yeah, thanks again. Joel. Appreciate it.\n\nJoel Dietz\n\nMy pleasure. Take care.\n\nMatt Zahab\n\nFolks. What an incredible episode of Joel Dietz. Founder of MetaMetaverse also did some incredible work on Ethereum Metamask, the first smart contract educational channel and tons of academic work on crypto economics. Joel brought the heat this episode this was absolutely incredible. I loved it. I really hope you guys did too. I\u2019m sure you did. To the team love you guys. Thank you so much for everything. Justas my amazing sound editor. You\u2019re the GOAT love you bro. And for listeners, you guys are the best. Keep on growing your bags on staying healthy, wealthy and happy. Bye for now and keep in touch."

        "content": "Reviewed and fact-checked by Sayantoni Das\n\nOver the past few years, you have consistently heard the term \u2018blockchain technology,\u2019 probably regarding cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin. In fact, you may be asking yourself, \u201cwhat is blockchain technology?\u201d It seems like blockchain is a platitude but in a hypothetical sense, as there is no real meaning that the layman can understand easily. It is imperative to answer \u201cwhat is blockchain technology, \u201cincluding the technology that is used, how it works, and how it\u2019s becoming vital in the digital world.\n\nAs blockchain continues to grow and become more user-friendly, the onus is on you to learn this evolving technology to prepare for the future. If you are new to blockchain, then this is the right platform to gain solid foundational knowledge. In this article, you learn how to answer the question, \u201cwhat is blockchain technology?\u201d You\u2019ll also learn how blockchain works, why it\u2019s important, and how you can use this field to advance your career.\n\nWhat Is Blockchain Technology?\n\nBlockchain is a method of recording information that makes it impossible or difficult for the system to be changed, hacked, or manipulated. A blockchain is a distributed ledger that duplicates and distributes transactions across the network of computers participating in the blockchain.\n\nBlockchain technology is a structure that stores transactional records, also known as the block, of the public in several databases, known as the \u201cchain,\u201d in a network connected through peer-to-peer nodes. Typically, this storage is referred to as a \u2018digital ledger.\u2019\n\nEvery transaction in this ledger is authorized by the digital signature of the owner, which authenticates the transaction and safeguards it from tampering. Hence, the information the digital ledger contains is highly secure.\n\nIn simpler words, the digital ledger is like a Google spreadsheet shared among numerous computers in a network, in which, the transactional records are stored based on actual purchases. The fascinating angle is that anybody can see the data, but they can\u2019t corrupt it.\n\nBasics to Advanced - Learn It All! Caltech PGP Full Stack Development Explore Program\n\nDive into the transformative world of blockchain technology with our intensive Cyber security Bootcamp. Uncover the revolutionary potential of blockchain while honing your skills in safeguarding these decentralized systems. From understanding the intricacies of smart contracts to fortifying digital transactions, this bootcamp equips you to navigate the evolving landscape of cybersecurity within the blockchain domain. Don't miss this opportunity to become a proficient cybersecurity professional in the realm of blockchain.\n\nWhy is Blockchain Popular?\n\nSuppose you are transferring money to your family or friends from your bank account. You would log in to online banking and transfer the amount to the other person using their account number. When the transaction is done, your bank updates the transaction records. It seems simple enough, right? There is a potential issue which most of us neglect.\n\nThese types of transactions can be tampered with very quickly. People who are familiar with this truth are often wary of using these types of transactions, hence the evolution of third-party payment applications in recent years. But this vulnerability is essentially why Blockchain technology was created.\n\nTechnologically, Blockchain is a digital ledger that is gaining a lot of attention and traction recently. But why has it become so popular? Well, let\u2019s dig into it to fathom the whole concept.\n\nRecord keeping of data and transactions are a crucial part of the business. Often, this information is handled in house or passed through a third party like brokers, bankers, or lawyers increasing time, cost, or both on the business. Fortunately, Blockchain avoids this long process and facilitates the faster movement of the transaction, thereby saving both time and money.\n\nMost people assume Blockchain and Bitcoin can be used interchangeably, but in reality, that\u2019s not the case. Blockchain is the technology capable of supporting various applications related to multiple industries like finance, supply chain, manufacturing, etc., but Bitcoin is a currency that relies on Blockchain technology to be secure.\n\nBlockchain is an emerging technology with many advantages in an increasingly digital world:\n\nHighly Secure It uses a digital signature feature to conduct fraud-free transactions making it impossible to corrupt or change the data of an individual by the other users without a specific digital signature.\n\nIt uses a digital signature feature to conduct fraud-free transactions making it impossible to corrupt or change the data of an individual by the other users without a specific digital signature. Decentralized System Conventionally, you need the approval of regulatory authorities like a government or bank for transactions; however, with Blockchain, transactions are done with the mutual consensus of users resulting in smoother, safer, and faster transactions.\n\nConventionally, you need the approval of regulatory authorities like a government or bank for transactions; however, with Blockchain, transactions are done with the mutual consensus of users resulting in smoother, safer, and faster transactions. Automation Capability It is programmable and can generate systematic actions, events, and payments automatically when the criteria of the trigger are met.\n\nStructure and Design of Blockchain\n\nA blockchain is a distributed, immutable, and decentralized ledger at its core that consists of a chain of blocks and each block contains a set of data. The blocks are linked together using cryptographic techniques and form a chronological chain of information. The structure of a blockchain is designed to ensure the security of data through its consensus mechanism which has a network of nodes that agree on the validity of transactions before adding them to the blockchain.\n\nBlocks:\n\nA block in a blockchain is a combination of three main components:\n\n1. The header contains metadata such as a timestamp which has a random number used in the mining process and the previous block's hash.\n\n2. The data section contains the main and actual information like transactions and smart contracts which are stored in the block.\n\n3. Lastly, the hash is a unique cryptographic value that works as a representative of the entire block which is used for verification purposes.\n\nBlock Time:\n\nBlock time refers to the time taken to generate a new block in a blockchain. Different blockchains have different block times, which can vary from a few seconds to minutes or may be in hours too. Shorter block times can give faster transaction confirmations but the result has higher chances of conflicts but the longer block times may increase the timing for transaction confirmations but reduce the chances of conflicts.\n\nHard Forks:\n\nA hard fork in a blockchain refers to a permanent divergence in the blockchain's history that results in two separate chains. It can happen due to a fundamental change in the protocol of a blockchain and all nodes do not agree on the update. Hard forks can create new cryptocurrencies or the splitting of existing ones and It requires consensus among the network participants to resolve.\n\nDecentralization:\n\nDecentralization is the key feature of blockchain technology. In a decentralized blockchain, there is no single central authority that can control the network. In decentralization,the decision-making power is distributed among a network of nodes that collectively validate and agree on the transactions to be added to the blockchain. This decentralized nature of blockchain technology helps to promote transparency, trust, and security. It also reduces the risk to rely on a single point of failure and minimizes the risks of data manipulation.\n\nFinality:\n\nFinality refers to the irreversible confirmation of transactions in a blockchain. If and when a transaction is added to a block and the block is confirmed by the network, it becomes immutable and cannot be reversed. This feature ensures the integrity of the data and prevents double spending, providing a high level of security and trust in Blockchain Types & Sustainability\n\nOpenness:\n\nOpenness in blockchain technology makes the blockchain accessible to anyone who intends to participate in the network. This implies that it is open for all and anyone can join the network, validate transactions, and can add new blocks to the blockchain, so long as they know the consensus rules. Openness promotes inclusivity, transparency, and innovation, as it allows for participation from various stakeholders.\n\nPublic Blockchain:\n\nIt is a kind of blockchain which is open for the public and allows everyone to join the network to perform transactions and to participate in the consensus process. Public blockchains are transparent, because all transactions are publicly recorded.\n\nHow Does Blockchain Technology Work?\n\nIn recent years, you may have noticed many businesses around the world integrating Blockchain technology. But how exactly does Blockchain technology work? Is this a significant change or a simple addition? The advancements of Blockchain are still young and have the potential to be revolutionary in the future; so, let\u2019s begin demystifying this technology.\n\nBlockchain is a combination of three leading technologies:\n\nCryptographic keys A peer-to-peer network containing a shared ledger A means of computing, to store the transactions and records of the network\n\nCryptography keys consist of two keys \u2013 Private key and Public key. These keys help in performing successful transactions between two parties. Each individual has these two keys, which they use to produce a secure digital identity reference. This secured identity is the most important aspect of Blockchain technology. In the world of cryptocurrency, this identity is referred to as \u2018digital signature\u2019 and is used for authorizing and controlling transactions.\n\nThe digital signature is merged with the peer-to-peer network; a large number of individuals who act as authorities use the digital signature in order to reach a consensus on transactions, among other issues. When they authorize a deal, it is certified by a mathematical verification, which results in a successful secured transaction between the two network-connected parties. So to sum it up, Blockchain users employ cryptography keys to perform different types of digital interactions over the peer-to-peer network.\n\nBasics to Advanced - Learn It All! Caltech PGP Full Stack Development Explore Program\n\nTypes of Blockchain\n\nThere are different types of blockchains. They are as follows:\n\nPrivate Blockchain Networks\n\nPrivate blockchains operate on closed networks, and tend to work well for private businesses and organizations. Companies can use private blockchains to customize their accessibility and authorization preferences, parameters to the network, and other important security options. Only one authority manages a private blockchain network.\n\nPublic Blockchain Networks\n\nBitcoin and other cryptocurrencies originated from public blockchains, which also played a role in popularizing distributed ledger technology (DLT). Public blockchains also help to eliminate certain challenges and issues, such as security flaws and centralization. With DLT, data is distributed across a peer-to-peer network, rather than being stored in a single location. A consensus algorithm is used for verifying information authenticity; proof of stake (PoS) and proof of work (PoW) are two frequently used consensus methods.\n\nPermissioned Blockchain Networks\n\nAlso sometimes known as hybrid blockchains, permissioned blockchain networks are private blockchains that allow special access for authorized individuals. Organizations typically set up these types of blockchains to get the best of both worlds, and it enables better structure when assigning who can participate in the network and in what transactions.\n\nConsortium Blockchains\n\nSimilar to permissioned blockchains, consortium blockchains have both public and private components, except multiple organizations will manage a single consortium blockchain network. Although these types of blockchains can initially be more complex to set up, once they are running, they can offer better security. Additionally, consortium blockchains are optimal for collaboration with multiple organizations.\n\nHybrid Blockchains\n\nHybrid blockchains are the combination of both public and private blockchains. In a hybrid blockchain, some parts of the blockchain are public and transparent, while others are private and accessible only to authorized and specific participants. This makes hybrid blockchains ideal for use in those cases where a balance is required between transparency and privacy. For example, in supply chain management multiple parties can access certain information, but sensitive data can be kept private.\n\nSidechains\n\nSidechains are different blockchains that run parallel to the main blockchain, allowing for additional functionality and scalability. Sidechains enable developers to experiment with new features and applications without affecting the main blockchain's integrity. For example, sidechains can be used for creating decentralized applications and to implement specific consensus mechanisms. Sidechains can also be used to handle transactions of the main blockchain to reduce congestion and increase scalability.\n\nBlockchain Layers\n\nBlockchain layers refer to the concept of building multiple layers of blockchains on top of each other. Each layer can have its own consensus mechanism, rules, and functionality which can interact with other layers. This ensures greater scalability, as transactions can be processed in parallel across different layers. For example, the Lightning Network, built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain, is a second layer solution that enables faster and cheaper transactions by creating payment channels between users.\n\nThe Process of Transaction\n\nOne of Blockchain technology\u2019s cardinal features is the way it confirms and authorizes transactions. For example, if two individuals wish to perform a transaction with a private and public key, respectively, the first person party would attach the transaction information to the public key of the second party. This total information is gathered together into a block.\n\nThe block contains a digital signature, a timestamp, and other important, relevant information. It should be noted that the block doesn\u2019t include the identities of the individuals involved in the transaction. This block is then transmitted across all of the network's nodes, and when the right individual uses his private key and matches it with the block, the transaction gets completed successfully.\n\nIn addition to conducting financial transactions, the Blockchain can also hold transactional details of properties, vehicles, etc.\n\nHere\u2019s a use case that illustrates how Blockchain works:\n\nBasics to Advanced - Learn It All! Caltech PGP Full Stack Development Explore Program Hash Encryptions blockchain technology uses hashing and encryption to secure the data, relying mainly on the SHA256 algorithm to secure the information. The address of the sender (public key), the receiver\u2019s address, the transaction, and his/her private key details are transmitted via the SHA256 algorithm. The encrypted information, called hash encryption, is transmitted across the world and added to the blockchain after verification. The SHA256 algorithm makes it almost impossible to hack the hash encryption, which in turn simplifies the sender and receiver\u2019s authentication.\n\nblockchain technology uses hashing and encryption to secure the data, relying mainly on the SHA256 algorithm to secure the information.

The SHA256 algorithm makes it almost impossible to hack the hash encryption, which in turn simplifies the sender and receiver\u2019s authentication. Proof of Work In a Blockchain, each block consists of 4 main headers. Previous Hash: This hash address locates the previous block. Transaction Details: Details of all the transactions that need to occur. Nonce: An arbitrary number given in cryptography to differentiate the block\u2019s hash address. Hash Address of the Block: All of the above (i.e., preceding hash, transaction details, and nonce) are transmitted through a hashing algorithm. This gives an output containing a 256-bit, 64 character length value, which is called the unique \u2018hash address.\u2019 Consequently, it is referred to as the hash of the block. Numerous people around the world try to figure out the right hash value to meet a pre-determined condition using computational algorithms. The transaction completes when the predetermined condition is met. To put it more plainly, Blockchain miners attempt to solve a mathematical puzzle, which is referred to as a proof of work problem. Whoever solves it first gets a reward.\n\nIn a Blockchain, each block consists of 4 main headers.\n\nMining In Blockchain technology, the process of adding transactional details to the present digital/public ledger is called \u2018mining.\u2019 Though the term is associated with Bitcoin, it is used to refer to other Blockchain technologies as well. Mining involves generating the hash of a block transaction, which is tough to forge, thereby ensuring the safety of the entire Blockchain without needing a central system.\n\nHistory of Blockchain\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto, whose real identity still remains unknown to date, first introduced the concept of blockchains in 2008. The design continued to improve and evolve, with Nakamoto using a Hashcash-like method. It eventually became a primary component of bitcoin, a popular form of cryptocurrency, where it serves as a public ledger for all network transactions. Bitcoin blockchain file sizes, which contained all transactions and records on the network, continued to grow substantially. By August 2014, it had reached 20 gigabytes, and eventually exceeded 200 gigabytes by early 2020.\n\nAdvantages and Disadvantages of Blockchain\n\nLike all forms of technology, blockchain has several advantages and disadvantages to consider.\n\nAdvantages\n\nOne major advantage of blockchains is the level of security it can provide, and this also means that blockchains can protect and secure sensitive data from online transactions. For anyone looking for speedy and convenient transactions, blockchain technology offers this as well. In fact, it only takes a few minutes, whereas other transaction methods can take several days to complete. There is also no third-party interference from financial institutions or government organizations, which many users look at as an advantage.\n\nDisadvantages\n\nBlockchain and cryptography involves the use of public and private keys, and reportedly, there have been problems with private keys. If a user loses their private key, they face numerous challenges, making this one disadvantage of blockchains. Another disadvantage is the scalability restrictions, as the number of transactions per node is limited. Because of this, it can take several hours to finish multiple transactions and other tasks. It can also be difficult to change or add information after it is recorded, which is another significant disadvantage of blockchain.\n\nBasics to Advanced - Learn It All! Caltech PGP Full Stack Development Explore Program\n\nHow is Blockchain Used?\n\nBlockchains store information on monetary transactions using cryptocurrencies, but they also store other types of information, such as product tracking and other data. For example, food products can be tracked from the moment they are shipped out, all throughout their journey, and up until final delivery. This information can be helpful because if there is a contamination outbreak, the source of the outbreak can be easily traced. This is just one of the many ways that blockchains can store important data for organizations.\n\nHyperledger, Hosted by the Linux Foundation\n\nHyperledger is a global collaboration hosted by The Linux Foundation, including finance, banking, IoT, supply chain, manufacturing, and technology leaders. By creating a cross-industry open standard for distributed ledgers, Hyperledger Fabric allows developers to develop blockchain applications to meet specific needs.\n\nTen Steps to Your First Blockchain Application\n\nUnderstand what Blockchain is and its key components. Understand the purpose of your application. Create a use case for your application. Find out if there's already an existing blockchain for your purpose. Explore the different types of Blockchain platforms available for your application. There are many types of Blockchain, each with its strengths and weaknesses. Choose the right platform for developing your app. Select the consensus algorithm you will use. Learn Solidity - Ethereum's programming language for smart contracts and DApps (decentralized applications). Learn how to use Truffle or Remix - development tools for Ethereum DApps and smart contracts. Get an Ethereum account or wallet and buy some Ether (ETH), the currency of the Ethereum network.\n\nDecentralization\n\nDecentralization is difficult to Understand, but it is vital in the world today; decentralization is distributing or dispersing functions, powers, people, or things away from a central location or authority. Within the business world, decentralization typically refers to delegating authority from senior executives to middle managers and other employees further down the organizational hierarchy. The benefits of devolution are many and varied, but the most commonly cited advantages include improved communication, greater employee empowerment, and increased flexibility and responsiveness.\n\nTransparency\n\nOne of the most critical aspects of decentralization is transparency. All employees have access to information and decision-making processes in a decentralized organization. This transparency fosters a greater sense of trust and cooperation among employees. Furthermore, it allows employees to hold managers accountable for their decisions.\n\nBasics to Advanced - Learn It All! Caltech PGP Full Stack Development Explore Program\n\nBitcoin vs. Blockchain\n\nBitcoin is a digital currency that was first introduced in 2009 and has been the most popular and successful cryptocurrency to date. Bitcoin's popularity is attributed to its decentralized nature, which means it doesn't have a central authority or bank controlling its supply. This also means that transactions are anonymous, and no transaction fees are involved when using bitcoin.\n\nBlockchain is a database of transactions that have taken place between two parties, with blocks of data containing information about each transaction being added in chronological order to the chain as it happens. The Blockchain is constantly growing as new blocks are added to it, with records becoming more difficult to change over time due to the number of blocks created after them.\n\nBlockchain vs. Banks\n\nBlockchain has the potential to revolutionize the banking industry. Banks need to be faster to adapt to the changing needs of the digital age, and Blockchain provides a way for them to catch up. By using Blockchain, banks can offer their customers a more secure and efficient way to conduct transactions. In addition, Blockchain can help banks to streamline their operations and reduce costs.\n\nWhy is Blockchain Important?\n\nBlockchain is important because it has the potential to revolutionize the banking industry. Banks need to be faster to adapt to the changing needs of the digital age, and Blockchain provides a way for them to catch up. By using Blockchain, banks can offer their customers a more secure and efficient way to conduct transactions. In addition, Blockchain can help banks to streamline their operations and reduce costs.\n\nWhat is a Blockchain Platform?\n\nA blockchain platform is a shared digital ledger that allows users to record transactions and share information securely, tamper-resistant. A distributed network of computers maintains the register, and each transaction is verified by consensus among the network participants.\n\nProof of Work (PoW) vs. Proof of Stake (PoS)\n\nProof of work (PoW) is an algorithm to create blocks and secure the Blockchain. It requires miners to solve a puzzle to create a block and receive the block reward in return.\n\nProof of stake (PoS) is an alternative algorithm for securing the Blockchain, which does not require mining. Instead, users must lock up some of their coins for a certain time to be eligible for rewards.\n\nEnergy Consumption Concerns of Blockchain\n\nThe main concern with blockchain technology is its energy consumption. Traditional blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum, use a consensus mechanism called PoW( Proof of Work), which requires computational power and electricity to solve complex mathematical puzzles. This energy-intensive process has raised concerns about the environmental impact of blockchain technology because it produces carbon emissions and consumes a huge amount of electricity.\n\nBlockchain or Scalability Trilemma: Decentralization, Security, and Scalability\n\nBlockchain is a distributed database that maintains a continuously growing list of records called blocks. Blockchain is often said to have the potential to disrupt many industries, including banking, law, and healthcare.\n\nBasics to Advanced - Learn It All! Caltech PGP Full Stack Development Explore Program\n\nWhat are the Benefits of Blockchains Over Traditional Finance?\n\nBlockchain offers several potential advantages over traditional finance. One of the most touted advantages is that Blockchain is decentralized, while traditional finance is centralized. This means there is no single point of failure in a blockchain system. Another advantage of Blockchain is that it is more transparent than traditional finance.\n\nPromising Blockchain Use Cases and Killer Applications\n\nPromising Blockchain Use Cases and Killer Applications: Although there are many potential applications for blockchain technology, there are a few that stand out as having the potential to be truly game-changing. These are often referred to as killer applications. Some of the most promising killer applications for blockchain technology include supply chain management, identity management, and data management.\n\nPromising blockchain use cases and killer applications are being developed every day. The Shiba Inu team is committed to finding and developing the most promising applications for the SHIB community. The team has a proven track record in the cryptocurrency space, and they are committed to creating value for the SHIB community.\n\nHow to Invest in Blockchain Technology\n\nBlockchain technology and stocks can be a lucrative investment, and there are several ways to take the next step toward making your first blockchain investment purchase. Bitcoin is typically the first thing that comes to mind when it comes to investing in blockchain technology, and it shouldn\u2019t be overlooked. Aside from Bitcoin, there is also the option of investing in cryptocurrency penny stocks, such as Altcoin and Litecoin. There are also certain apps and services that are in the pre-development phase and that are using blockchain technology to raise funding. As an investor, you can buy coins, with the expectation that prices will go up if the service or app becomes popular. Another way to invest in blockchain technology is to invest in startups built on blockchain technology. Finally, there is always the option to invest in pure blockchain technology.\n\nTraditional Finance and Blockchain Investment Strategies\n\nIn traditional finance, there are two main investment strategies: active and passive. Active investing involves picking stocks or other assets, and then holding onto them for a long period of time. Passive investing, on the other hand, involves investing in a basket of assets, and then holding onto them for a long period of time. Both of these strategies have their pros and cons, but there is one major difference between them: active investing is much more risky than passive investing.\n\nHow Do Different Industries Use Blockchain?\n\nBlockchain has the potential to streamline processes across many different industries.\n\nIn the supply chain industry, for example, Blockchain can track the movement of goods and materials as they change hands. This would allow for greater transparency and accountability and reduce the risk of fraud.\n\nIn the healthcare industry, Blockchain can be used to secure patient data and streamline the process of billing and claims.\n\nBasics to Advanced - Learn It All! Caltech PGP Full Stack Development Explore Program\n\nWhat are the Features of Blockchain Technology?\n\nBlockchain technology is a distributed ledger that is secure, transparent, and immutable.\n\nBlockchain technology can be used to create a decentralized database that is tamper-proof and has the potential to revolutionize the way we interact with the digital world.\n\nBlockchain technology is secure, transparent, and tamper-proof.\n\nWhat are the Key Components of Blockchain Technology?\n\nThere are three key components to blockchain technology:\n\nThe distributed ledger, the consensus mechanism, and the smart contracts.\n\nThe distributed ledger is a database that is spread across a network of computers. The consensus mechanism is what allows the network of computers to agree on the state of the ledger.\n\nThe smart contracts are what allows the blockchain to be used for more than just a database.\n\nWhat are Blockchain Protocols?\n\nThe three most common protocols Bitcoin was the first blockchain protocol and is still the most widely used is:\n\nBitcoin- Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency, often referred to as a cryptocurrency. It exists on a decentralized network of computers, often called a blockchain, that keeps track of all transactions made using the currency. Bitcoin uses a proof-of-work algorithm to validate transactions and add them to the blockchain. Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency to be created and is the most well-known.\n\nRipple- Ripple is a cryptocurrency that is similar to Bitcoin. Ripple uses a decentralized network of computers to keep track of all transactions made using the currency. Ripple uses a proof-of-work algorithm to validate transactions and add them to the blockchain. Ripple was created in 2012 and is the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.\n\nEthereum- The Ethereum blockchain was initially described in a white paper by Vitalik Buterin in 2013. Buterin, a programmer who was born in Russia and raised in Canada, had been involved with bitcoin from its early days. He was excited by the technology, but he thought that bitcoin needed a scripting language for application development. He decided to create a new platform that would be more general than bitcoin.\n\nBasics to Advanced - Learn It All! Caltech PGP Full Stack Development Explore Program\n\nWhat is the Difference Between a Database and a Blockchain?\n\nSo what is the difference between a database and a blockchain? A database is centralized, meaning that a single entity controls it. This entity can be a company, government, or individual. On the other hand, a blockchain is decentralized, meaning that any entity does not control it.\n\nHow is Blockchain Different From the Cloud?\n\nBlockchain is a new technology that is different from the cloud in several ways:\n\nBlockchain is decentralized, while the cloud is centralized. This means that Blockchain is distributed across a network of computers, while the cloud is stored on a central server.\n\nBlockchain is immutable, meaning that once data is written to the Blockchain, it cannot be changed.\n\nWhat is Blockchain as a Service?\n\nBlockchain as a Service is a cloud-based offering that allows customers to build, host, and use their blockchain applications, smart contracts, and functions on the Azure cloud platform. Azure offers integrated services that make it easy to develop, deploy, and manage blockchain applications. Customers can use Azure's managed services to create and deploy blockchain applications without having to set up and manage their infrastructure.\n\nBasics to Advanced - Learn It All! Caltech PGP Full Stack Development Explore Program\n\nWhat are the Implications of Blockchain Technology?\n\nBlockchain technology has made a great impact on society, including:\n\nBitcoin, Blockchain\u2019s prime application and the whole reason the technology was developed in the first place, has helped many people through financial services such as digital wallets. It has provided microloans and allowed micropayments to people in less than ideal economic circumstances, thereby introducing new life in the world economy.\n\nThe next major impact is in the concept of TRUST, especially within the sphere of international transactions. Previously, lawyers were hired to bridge the trust gap between two different parties, but it consumed extra time and money. But the introduction of Cryptocurrency has radically changed the trust equation. Many organizations are located in areas where resources are scarce, and corruption is widespread. In such cases, Blockchain renders a significant advantage to these affected people and organizations, allowing them to escape the tricks of unreliable third-party intermediaries.\n\nThe new reality of the Internet of Things (IoT) is already teeming with smart devices that \u2014 turn on your washing machines; drive your cars; navigate your ships; organize trash pick-up; manage traffic safety in your community \u2014 you name it! This is where blockchain comes in. In all of these cases (and more), leveraging blockchain technology by creating Smart Contracts will enable any organization to \u2012 both \u2014 improve operations and keep more accurate records.\n\nBlockchain technology enables a decentralized peer-to-peer network for organizations or apps like Airbnb and Uber. It allows people to pay for things like toll fees, parking, etc.\n\nBlockchain technology can be used as a secure platform for the healthcare industry for the purposes of storing sensitive patient data. Health-related organizations can create a centralized database with the technology and share the information with only the appropriately authorized people.\n\nIn the private consumer world, blockchain technology can be employed by two parties who wish to conduct a private transaction. However, these kinds of transactions have details that need to be hammered out before both parties can proceed:\n\nWhat are the terms and conditions (T&C) of the exchange? Are all the terms clear? When does the exchange start? When will it finish? When is it unfair to halt the exchange?\n\nSince blockchain technology employs a shared ledger, distributed ledger on a decentralized network, all parties involved can quickly find answers to these questions by researching \u201cblocks\u201d in the \u201cchain.\u201d Transactions on a blockchain platform can be tracked from departure to the destination by all of the transactions on the chain.\n\nHow Can Features of Blockchain Support Sustainability Efforts\n\nIn spite of huge energy consumption the blockchain technology has features that can support sustainability efforts. For example:\n\nBlockchain can give transparency and traceability in supply chains, allowing consumers to verify the origins and sustainability of products. This can encourage sustainable practices and discourage unethical practices such as deforestation, illegal fishing, or labor exploitation.\n\nDecentralization: Blockchain's decentralized nature helps to eliminate the need for intermediaries and reduce costs and also to increase efficiency. This can enable more direct and transparent transactions, reducing the environmental impact associated with traditional intermediaries.\n\nSmart Contracts: These are self-executing contracts that run on blockchain which eliminates the requirements for intermediaries and automating processes. This can reduce paperwork to minimize the disputes and streamline operations. It can help to lead to greater sustainability by reducing paper waste by increasing resource utilization.\n\nTokenization: Blockchain enables tokenization where assets can be represented as digital tokens. This can enable fractional ownership and make the process easier for people who intend to invest in sustainable assets such as renewable energy projects or carbon credits, promoting green investments and supporting sustainability initiatives.\n\nConclusion\n\nAlthough we just skimmed the industry-wide potential of blockchain applications in this article, the career potential in this field is growing exponentially. Getting ahead of the game is always a good strategy for any professional. At Simplilearn, our latest and most up-to-date course on this emerging field is the Professional Blockchain Certificate Program in Blockchain.

        "title": "Ethereum (ETH) and Chainlink (LINK) Holders Should Stay Focused - Opportunity On The Way! - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "The cryptocurrency market recently experienced a significant shakeup due to misinformation surrounding a purported Blackrock ETF approval. This unverified news spread rapidly, causing Bitcoin\u2019s value to surge by over 10% against the U.S. dollar. Such events underscore the volatility and sensitivity of the crypto market to news, both genuine and misleading.\n\nAmidst this backdrop of uncertainty, Ethereum (ETH), Chainlink (LINK) and ScapesMania (MANIA) also present a mixed picture. As speculations run wild in the echo chambers surrounding the two more popular coins, ScapesMania emerges as a preferable option as it approaches a major milestone for its presale.\n\nSummary:\n\nScapesMania (MANIA) establishes itself as a promising new entity in the cryptocurrency realm, gaining traction with its innovative approach and successful initial offerings, indicating potential for future growth amidst the established digital currencies.\n\nEthereum (ETH) faces market apprehension due to a substantial asset liquidation by a \u201cwhale,\u201d leading to uncertainty regarding its immediate stability and value.\n\nChainlink (LINK), despite a recent positive surge, encounters skepticism over its future stability due to aggressive accumulation by large stakeholders, hinting at possible market corrections.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Market Outlook\n\nEthereum (ETH), a dominant force in the cryptocurrency realm, has recently faced turbulence due to unexpected market activities. The abrupt liquidation of a significant amount of Ethereum (ETH) by an unidentified \u201cwhale\u201d has stirred uncertainty and apprehension. This move, involving the liquidation of 13,871 Ethereum (ETH), has raised questions about the stability and future prospects of Ethereum (ETH). Amidst this uncertainty, Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum (ETH) founder, stepped forward to clarify his non-involvement in this move, but the market remains wary\n\nEthereum (ETH) price dynamics are currently under scrutiny. With its value hovering between $1,570 and $1,732, the market sentiment appears cautious. The 10-day moving average at $1,562 suggests a potential downtrend, while the 100-day moving average at $1,713 indicates a more extended period of uncertainty. Ethereum (ETH) support levels at $1,308 and $1,470 might be tested if the market continues its bearish trend. Conversely, resistance levels at $1,794 and $1,955 seem distant in the current climate.\n\nThe crypto market\u2019s volatility is evident, and Ethereum (ETH) seems to be at a crossroads. The recent actions of the Ethereum (ETH) \u201cwhale\u201d have cast a shadow over Ethereum (ETH) short-term prospects. Some analysts are even hinting at a potential decline towards the $1,000 mark. While Ethereum (ETH) has a strong foundation, the current market dynamics suggest a period of consolidation and potential correction. Investors are advised to exercise caution and stay informed about global events and Ethereum (ETH) developmental updates.\n\nHowever, no amount of research can give you the same level of certainty that is presented when you\u2019re dealing with presale projects.

Large investors have indeed accumulated Chainlink (LINK) tokens, but such aggressive moves often precede market corrections. The rapid accumulation by these players might be a short-term strategy, raising concerns about Chainlink (LINK) long-term stability.\n\nChainlink (LINK) current trading range, between $6.529 and $9.051, might face downward pressure given the broader market\u2019s uncertainty. The 10-day moving average of $7.340, although above the current price, might not hold if bearish sentiments persist. The 100-day moving average at $6.974 further underscores the potential for price consolidation. Chainlink (LINK) support levels at $2.356 and $4.877 could be pivotal in the coming weeks, while resistance levels at $9.919 and $12.441 might remain unchallenged for a while.\n\nChainlink (LINK) recent advancements and integrations are commendable, but the broader market\u2019s volatility casts doubt on its immediate future. The crypto market\u2019s unpredictability, combined with Chainlink (LINK) rapid ascent, might lead to price corrections.

        "content": "The cryptocurrency market is no stranger to volatility. A recent incident involving a false report about Blackrock\u2019s Ishares spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) approval sent shockwaves throughout the market. This misinformation led to a surge in Bitcoin\u2019s price by over 10% against the U.S. dollar. However, the euphoria was short-lived as the news was debunked, causing the price to retract. Such events highlight the importance of accurate information in the crypto space and the potential consequences of misinformation.\n\n\n\nWhich direction will the underdogs like Ethereum Classic (ETC), Bitcoin SV (BSV), Pepe (PEPE), and Optimism (OP) take as a result of this market shift? Will ScapesMania\u2019s meteoric rise leave them in the dust? Let\u2019s find out!\n\nSummary:\n\nScapesMania (MANIA) emerges as a noteworthy contender, attracting attention with its innovative strategies and robust presale success.\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC) grapples with market unpredictability, facing both growth opportunities and stability concerns.\n\nBitcoin SV (BSV) stands at a crossroads, with its future hanging between its foundational vision and market skepticism.\n\nPepe (PEPE) rides the wave of meme popularity, though its long-term viability remains an open question.\n\nOptimism (OP) steps into the market with promising solutions, yet must navigate significant adoption barriers.\n\nScapesMania: The Rising Star in Crypto Innovation\n\nScapesMania has rapidly become a synonym for originality in the relatively new cryptocurrency market. ScapesMania stands out from the crowd of underrated altcoins and well-established crypto titans because of its innovative revenue streams and meteoric rise in its presale.\n\nBacked by an award-winning team, ScapesMania is all about safety, having successfully passed audits by top-tier security labs. With a presence on key exchanges on the horizon, ScapesMania is poised for visibility and liquidity, which are going to fuel its growth.\n\n>>> Find Out More on the Official Site <<<\n\nWhat is a Presale?\n\nThe purpose of a crypto presale is to provide interested parties a chance to learn about and perhaps buy a new coin before it is officially released and listed on online trading platforms. Plus, it\u2019s a great way to acquire tokens at a much lower price than they will be once the project goes live.\n\nThe current ScapesMania presale is gathering steam by the day, giving traders a small window of opportunity to leverage this token while it is still in its initial stages. Joining the presale enables you to save significantly as ScapesMania is expected to surge in value upon listing. Such offers don\u2019t last long \u2013 as the clock is ticking, the opportunity to acquire discounted ScapesMania tokens is slipping away.\n\nIs ScapesMania Going to Be the Hottest Altcoin of 2023 and Beyond?\n\nSeveral factors point to ScapesMania being the most promising new cryptocurrency of 2023:\n\nInnovative Mechanisms : ScapesMania allows crypto-savvy people to benefit from the multi-billion gaming industry;\n\nInstantaneous Token Access : ScapesMania distinguishes itself from the crowd by letting purchasers take instant possession of and use their tokens after payment.\n\nStraightforward Tokenomics : The project\u2019s tokenomics are cutting-edge and simple to understand since they avoid any ambiguity;\n\nRising Presale Numbers: ScapesMania\u2019s impressive presale statistics indicate that it is gaining significant traction in the crypto world.\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC): The Classic Contender\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC) has long been recognized as a stalwart in the cryptocurrency realm. Born from a contentious hard fork, Ethereum Classic (ETC) has managed to carve out its own identity separate from its more famous sibling, Ethereum. While it recently experienced a notable spike, market analysts and traders are keeping a close eye, balancing optimism with caution due to the coin\u2019s historical volatility.\n\nNavigating the price range of $14.90-$17.31, Ethereum Classic (ETC) financial trajectory is a topic of much debate. The moving averages, while indicative of potential trends, also underscore the coin\u2019s unpredictability. Resistance levels, suggesting potential price ceilings, are closely watched, but the looming support levels hint at possible downturns that could be on the horizon.\n\nThe road ahead for Ethereum Classic (ETC) is paved with both opportunities and challenges. While the coin has shown moments of impressive growth and has a dedicated community backing it, the broader crypto market\u2019s volatility means that nothing is guaranteed. Traders and investors are advised to keep a close eye on market trends, regulatory news, and technological advancements related to Ethereum Classic (ETC).\n\nBitcoin SV (BSV): The Bitcoin Successor?\n\nBitcoin SV (BSV), standing for \u201cBitcoin Satoshi Vision,\u201d has always been a topic of discussion since its inception. Positioned as the \u201ctrue vision\u201d of Bitcoin\u2019s mysterious creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin SV (BSV) has both its ardent supporters and skeptics. Its recent price movements have further intensified the debates surrounding its potential and future.\n\nWith a trading range of $29.10-$33.41, Bitcoin SV (BSV) financial landscape is as dynamic as its history. The moving averages, while providing some insights, also highlight the coin\u2019s inherent volatility. Resistance levels paint a picture of potential highs, but the support levels serve as a sobering reminder of how quickly tides can turn in the crypto world.\n\nThe future for Bitcoin SV (BSV) is a blend of promise and uncertainty. While its technological vision and commitment to on-chain scaling present opportunities for growth and adoption, the broader crypto market\u2019s fluctuations and the coin\u2019s controversial history mean that its path is far from straightforward. For traders and investors, a keen understanding of BSV\u2019s technological nuances, coupled with a vigilant eye on the market, will be crucial.\n\nPepe (PEPE): The Meme Coin Phenomenon\n\nPepe (PEPE) is not just another coin in the vast crypto universe; it represents the power of internet culture and the unpredictable nature of meme-driven assets. Born from the world of internet memes, Pepe (PEPE) has transitioned from being a simple internet joke to a cryptocurrency that traders are genuinely considering.\n\nPepe (PEPE) 10-Day Moving Average stands at $0.0000006491, slightly below its current lower trading range, suggesting recent upward momentum. The 100-Day Moving Average, at $0.0000009915, indicates a potential long-term bullish sentiment. However, with support levels at $0.0000002906 and $0.0000005167, there\u2019s room for downward movement. Resistance levels at $0.0000009689 and $0.0000011950 provide targets for potential upward breakouts.\n\nWhile Pepe (PEPE) has shown moments of impressive growth, its future, like most meme coins, is uncertain. The crypto landscape is littered with meme coins that have experienced meteoric rises followed by sharp declines. For traders, the key will be to understand the cultural and community-driven forces behind Pepe (PEPE) and to approach it with a mix of enthusiasm and caution.\n\nOptimism (OP): A Ray of Hope in the Crypto World?\n\nOptimism (OP) has entered the crypto scene with a promise to address some of the pressing issues faced by other cryptocurrencies. While it has garnered attention, it\u2019s essential to separate the hype from the reality and understand what truly drives this coin.\n\nOptimism (OP) 10-Day Moving Average is $1.217, suggesting a recent uptrend given its current trading range\u2019s lower limit. The 100-Day Moving Average stands at $1.416, aligning closely with its current upper trading limit. Support levels at $1.106 and $1.416 provide insights into potential price floors, while resistance levels at $1.557 and $1.783 hint at possible future highs.\n\nOptimism (OP) name itself suggests a positive future, but in the ever-evolving world of crypto, nothing is set in stone. While its technological promises offer a ray of hope, the challenges of market adoption, competition, and regulatory hurdles loom large. For traders and investors, a deep dive into Optimism (OP) tech, coupled with a vigilant monitoring of market trends, will be crucial.\n\nConclusion: Assessing Stability and Growth Amidst Uncertainty\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC), Bitcoin SV (BSV), Pepe (PEPE), and Optimism (OP) are experiencing market volatility, with fluctuating prices and uncertain futures. Amidst this instability, ScapesMania is gaining traction due to its innovative approach and strong presale figures.\n\nWhile established coins face skepticism, ScapesMania\u2019s unique market entry points to potential stability and growth. Those who back the project now can take full advantage of the presale bonus, special discount, and the $100,000 giveaway entry.\n\nSite: https://scapesmania.io/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/ScapesMania\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/scapesmania\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC), the world\u2019s oldest and most valued cryptocurrency, managed to remain above the $28,000 mark early Thursday despite reds dominating the price charts. Popular altcoins \u2014 including the likes of Ethereum (ETH), Dogecoin (DOGE), Ripple (XRP), Solana (SOL), and Litecoin (LTC) \u2014 landed in the reds across the board. The Bitcoin SV (BSV) token became the biggest gainer of the lot, with a 24-hour gain of over 5 percent.

As per WazirX, SOL price in India stood at Rs 2,036.\n\nTop Crypto Gainers Today (October 19)\n\nAs per CoinMarketCap data, here are the top five crypto gainers over the past 24 hours:\n\nBitcoin SV (BSV)\n\nPrice: $41.63\n\n24-hour gain: 5.89 percent\n\nUNUS SED LEO (LEO)\n\nPrice: $3.79\n\n24-hour gain: 2.90 percent\n\nMina (MINA)\n\nPrice: $0.3776\n\n24-hour gain: 2.55 percent\n\nMantle (MNT)\n\nPrice: $0.3222\n\n24-hour gain: 2.53 percent\n\nInjective (INJ)\n\nPrice: $8.06\n\n24-hour gain: 2.27 percent\n\nTop Crypto Losers Today (October 19)\n\nAs per CoinMarketCap data, here are the top five crypto losers over the past 24 hours:\n\nConflux (CFX)\n\nPrice: $0.1009\n\n24-hour loss: 7.96 percent\n\nOKB (OKB)\n\nPrice: $43.97\n\n24-hour loss: 5.29 percent\n\nChiliz (CHZ)\n\nPrice: $0.05521\n\n24-hour loss: 5.07 percent\n\nToncoin (TON)\n\nPrice: $2.01\n\n24-hour loss: 4.89 percent\n\nGala (GALA)\n\nPrice: $0.01264\n\n24-hour loss: 3.77 percent\n\nWhat Crypto Exchanges Are Saying About Current Market Scenario\n\nMudrex co-founder and CEO Edul Patel told ABP Live, \u201cIn the past 24 hours, Bitcoin has been trading consistently above the $28,200 level following asset manager Fidelity's submission of an amendment to its proposed spot Bitcoin ETF application to the US SEC. This amendment outlines Fidelity's strategies for securing customers' Bitcoin in custody accounts and transparently disclosing associated risks. Notably, ARK Invest and Invesco made similar amendments to their applications last week. These coordinated efforts have given rise to optimism among market participants, who interpret these actions as potential signs of ongoing discussions between the US SEC and the spot ETF applicants. Furthermore, market attention is focused on the Economic Club of New York, where Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is scheduled to speak later today, just before the US central bank's blackout period leading up to its next interest-rate decision.\u201d\n\nShubham Hudda, Senior Manager, CoinSwitch Markets Desk, said, \u201cBitcoin (BTC, -0.9 percent) has been holding the fort above $28,000 even as it has registered gains due to fake news of ETF acceptance followed by a price correction. Even though nearly $100 million was liquidated within hours, investors seem to be noticing the steadiness in BTC price after its correction. However, reports suggest that the actual BTC ETF approval could boost the crypto market potentially bumping up the global crypto M.Cap by $1 trillion.\u201d\n\nRajagopal Menon, Vice President, WazirX, said, \u201cBitcoin is trading at $28,256 after suffering a decline of 0.75 percent in the past 24 hours. The Bitcoin ETF race garners attention for its potential to offer a regulated means to access Bitcoin price movements. Recent false reports of the SEC approving BlackRock's BTC ETF application briefly sent Bitcoin above $30,000 before falling 8 percent upon clarification. Despite regulatory delays, the market speculates on a forthcoming approval as traditional financial institutions embrace crypto.\u201d\n\nSathvik Vishwanath, CEO and co-founder of Unocoin, said, \u201cBitcoin, the reigning cryptocurrency market leader, is at a pivotal moment as it nears the $29,000 mark. Technical analysis reveals a slightly bullish scenario with RSI at 63, suggesting optimism without overbought. The price remains above the 50-day EMA of $27,712, indicating short-term bullish potential. However, the triple top pattern at the $28,634 resistance raises concerns about a bearish trend, which is amplified by the presence of Doji candles. In short, Bitcoin's current path seems positive above $28,150, but a drop below that level could tip the balance. In the near term, Bitcoin is poised to challenge the $28,634 resistance, influenced by various technical indicators and market sentiment.\u201d\n\nShivam Thakral, CEO, BuyUcoin, said, \"The crypto market is showing optimism around the Bitcoin ETF news. The Blockchain analytics firm CryptoQuant predicted that $155 billion will enter the crypto market if Bitcoin ETFs are approved. Bitcoin remained above the $28,000 mark while Ether was hovering above the $1,500 mark at the time of writing. The crypto market is poised for a healthy growth but uncertain macroeconomic factors may restrict its momentum.\"\n\nCoinDCX Research Team told ABP Live, \u201cIn the past 24 hours, BTC's price briefly climbed to Rs 25,40,000 ($29,000) but quickly retraced below $28,500. Currently, it's trading within the range of $28,100 to $28,500. As long as BTC holds above $28,000, it's considered a positive sign for the overall market. On the other hand, ETH has lost its recent gains and is once again hovering near the major support level of $1,530 to $1,550.\u201d\n\nSubscribe And Follow ABP Live On Telegram: t.me/officialabplive\n\nDisclaimer: Crypto products and NFTs are unregulated and can be highly risky.

        "title": "Solana Is Winning The Energy-Efficiency Race But Ethereum \"Is Too Large To Ignore\" - Bitcoinist",
        "content": "One developer, \u201c0xIchigo,\u201d behind Helius, a software company developing infrastructure for users to build on Solana, thinks Solana is winning the energy efficiency race. However, competing platforms, especially Ethereum, are here to stay.\n\nEthereum Is Here To Stay, Solana Is Winning The Energy Efficiency Race\n\nEthereum and Solana aim to serve the same user base, but the former was the first to launch, with the latter being a generation-4 blockchain. It seeks to resolve challenges faced by the original smart contract platform. For this reason, Solana is more performant and has higher throughput, though there have been instances where its reliability has been questioned.\n\nOn energy efficiency, the developer noted that for every transaction confirmed on Bitcoin, the world\u2019s most valuable network using the proof-of-work consensus algorithm, 5 billion Joules of energy is spent. A similar transaction on Ethereum will see 144k Joules of energy expended. Meanwhile, the same on Solana will see 658 Joules of energy consumed, less than what goes into a \u201cGoogle search.\u201d\n\nThe high energy spent on Bitcoin is primarily because of the ledger\u2019s consensus algorithm, which requires miners to spend electricity as they run gear, competing to solve cryptographic problems. Successful miners add the valid block of transactions to the chain in exchange for a 6.25 BTC reward and transaction fees accumulated from the block.\n\nThe proof-of-work consensus algorithm is usually more energy-intensive and consumes more energy than alternative systems used by Solana and Ethereum. Ethereum shifted to a proof-of-stake system in September 2022.\n\nIt depends on validators who don\u2019t have to run expensive gear but stake at least 32 ETH. As of October 18, there were more than 978,000 validators. Meanwhile, over 1,970 validators were securing and validating transactions on Solana.\n\nEthereum Is \u201cToo Large To Ignore\u201d\n\n\n\nWhile energy efficiency is one of the key metrics being considered, especially by protocols launching on smart contract platforms, activity is critical. So far, Ethereum is one of the most active smart contract platforms, looking at, for instance, the total value locked (TVL) by decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. Ethereum manages over $20 billion of DeFi assets, while Solana trails at around $324 million.\n\nThis could be why 0xIchigo, though pointing out the advantage of Solana, is adamant that Ethereum and its virtual machine (EVM) are \u201ctoo large to ignore.\u201d Still, in the developer\u2019s assessment, this advantage makes the EVM rigid and hard to scale over time. Transaction fees, which fluctuate, greatly impact the virtual machine, making it a less desirable option for payment companies.\n\nRelated Reading: Bitcoin On The Brink: 50% Drop Possible Ahead Of Halving, Analyst Warns\n\nFeature image from Canva, chart from TradingView"

        "title": "Ethereum: Vitalik Buterin has not sold ETH for profit since 2018 - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "A few days ago Vitalik Buterin, founder of Ethereum, revealed in a post on the decentralized social media site Warpcast that he has not sold ETH for personal profit for five years now.\n\nAt most, the creator of the famous smart contract platform, would use part of his ether assets and part of the shitcoins sent to him by different communities, to support non-profit organizations and do charity work.\n\nHence, he is not selling himself but the counterparts who have to bear some expenses.\n\nIn the world of donations Vitalik had made his mark in 2021, when he sold $1 billion in Shiba Inu (SHIB) to the Indian fund \u201cCrypto Relief,\u201d set up by his colleague Sandeep Nailwal to support the Covid-19 emergency.\n\nVitalik Buterin has not sold ETH for personal profit for 5 years: the Ethereum community confuses donations as terminations\n\nTwo days ago, Vitalik Buterin, a Russian computer programmer and inventor of the Ethereum protocol, posted a very interesting tweet within the decentralized social media site Warpcast, in which he reminded his community that he is not a greedy person for money.\n\nSpecifically, he allegedly said that he has not sold ETH for personal profit since as far back as 2018, and that the only transfers from his address involve donations to charities.\n\nhttps://warpcast.com/vitalik.eth/0xb8ccf84d\n\nUsers often confuse donations with terminations, thinking that an ether transfer necessarily implies selling for stablecoin or FIAT with the intent of making cashouts to the personal account of Ethereum\u2019s \u201cboss.\u201d\n\nThe media exploit events in which transactions are recorded leaving Vitalik\u2019s wallet to gain attention through \u201cclickbait\u201d headlines, spreading misinformation.\n\nWhen the founder of the smart contract platform makes a donation in ETH, he is not selling for profit but simply spending the cryptocurrency, while the recipient often decides to sell to cover operational expenses.\n\nAccording to Vitalik Buterin, and by analyzing the histories of the public addresses in his possession (the connection of which was revealed years ago), there are in fact no traces of recent trading or sales on exchanges that suggest personal gains.\n\nThe news does not cause much of a stir and is not surprising to those who by now know the 29-year-old Russian programmer\u2019s personality, since over the years he has never acted for personal gain but always and only for the good of Ethereum.\n\nSuffice it to say that although he came to be a multi-billionaire when Ether\u2019s prices were near all-time highs, he has never sported fancy clothes or driven supercars and, on the contrary, has always behaved modestly and discreetly.\n\nHis attire of garish T-shirts with unicorns, rainbows, and ufos is typical of classic computer nerds who do not care about the social influence of money.\n\nVitalik\u2019s philanthropic activities and historic $1 billion donation to SHIB\n\nOver the years Vitalik Buterin, in addition to ethically supporting Ethereum\u2019s foundation and its affiliated businesses without making substantial personal profits, has often shown that he cares deeply about charity.\n\nIn June this year, he revealed that he and the founder of layer-2 solution Polygon Sandeep Nailwal donated $100 million to India\u2019s \u201cCrypto Relief\u201d fund, established in 2021 to support the Covid-19 emergency.\n\nThis is yet another handout after the same two developers gave away another $100 million in 2022 with the intent of supporting high social impact activities and projects.\n\nLast year @CryptoRelief_ led by @sandeepnailwal allocated $100m to Covid research projects I wanted to fund\n\n\n\nSandeep and I discussed and jointly concluded these and other projects are high-impact and need follow through grants. Hence we decided to put $100m more to these projects \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) June 8, 2023\n\nDespite the mind-boggling figures, the donations of the last 2 years have nothing to do with the historic approximately $1 billion transaction in SHIB, with which Vitalik decided to fund the same \u201cCrypto Relief\u201d fund as soon as the second wave of the health emergency in India broke out in April 2021.\n\nThe curious thing about this affair, is that the Ethereum founder had not purchased SHIB to fund his philanthropic activities, but had received them for free from the Shiba Inu community as a marketing technique to increase the memecoin\u2018s countervalue (it was thought that Vitalik would never sell them and hence a \u201csupply shortage\u201d condition would be created).\n\nThe Indian fund that received the lucky mountain of money today still has a balance sheet of about $200 million, most of it in USDC.\n\nVitalik, on the other hand, also directly manages another charity, called Kanro, through a $70 million multi-signature wallet, with which he funds a wide variety of projects with the intention of making his mark on the world and alleviating the suffering of the less fortunate.\n\nOn the other hand, as for his personal cryptocurrency wallet (his largest one), whose address was made public by himself in 2018, we know that he currently holds a countervalue of $1.66 million, of which about 35 percent is in ETH while the rest consists of shitcoins that Vitalik has never bought.\n\nIn fact, after the SHIB affair, in which the inventor of Ethereum received 50 percent of the coin\u2019s supply for free, several memecoin projects began sending large quantities of tokens to his address."

        "content": "The mBridge project for cross-border CBDC payments is changing the Consensus protocol to the new Chinese blockchain consensus protocol.\n\nUsing Ethereum\u2019s Solidity smart contract language and the Ethereum Virtual Machine, some are speculating it could switch to Ripple technologies.\n\nThe mBridge project, a platform built by central banks to support real-time, peer-to-peer, cross-border payments, is shifting from the mBridge ledger to a new Chinese blockchain consensus protocol. The platform designed and built by a number of countries will utilize wholesale central bank digital currencies (CBDC) from Thailand, Hong Kong, China, and the UAE. In addition, the Swedish and French central banks are also known observers who might also look to join the alliance based on its success.\n\nAs earlier reported, the Bridge utilizes a number of technologies including Ethereum\u2019s Solidity smart contract language and the Ethereum Virtual Machine. Maintaining some of the core technologies that make up the platform, the Bridge ledger is now moving to a new Chinese blockchain consensus protocol.\n\nDriven by a number of countries, the adoption of mBridge could usher in millions of users to the platform. This would make it a direct rival of SWIFT. SWIFT is a vast messaging network banks and other financial institutions use to quickly, accurately, and securely send and receive information. Primarily controlled by the West, the network has been prone to interference, sometimes used as a financial weapon to lock individuals and even states out of the international financial system. The success of mBridge will change the landscape of the international financial system and could have repercussions in politics.\n\nAs CNF has been reporting a global alliance going by the acronym BRICS has been expanding and growing in popularity. The alliance comprises China, Brazil, Russia, India and South Africa. Earlier this year, the bloc further invited six emerging market group countries Argentina, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. One of the key agendas for the bloc is dethroning the U.S. dollar.\n\nWhen Will They Switch to Ripple and XRP?\n\nAs countries look to blockchain technology to launch CBDCs, it\u2019s been clear that Ripple and its revolutionary XRP Ledger is a top contender to deploy these digital assets. Financial technology firm Ripple Labs has already launched its Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) platform where financial institutions, governments, and central banks can mint their stablecoins and CBDCs. As a result, Over 8 countries are constructing their CBDCs on the XRP Ledger.\n\nFor now, Ripple is facing a legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) which has placed its future under great uncertainty and barred it from inking some major partnerships. However, experts believe the company will record a win. In the near future, it could offer the technology utilized in the mBridge blockchain framework.\n\n."
