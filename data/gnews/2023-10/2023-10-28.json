        "content": "Advertisement\n\nTotal value locked in DeFis, a crucial metric for programmable blockchains, is rallying in the segment of Ethereum-based second-layer solutions. Despite general market apathy, the net TVL of 30 leading platforms added 32% in the last four months.\n\nEthereum L2s set new all-time high in TVL\n\nYesterday, Oct. 27, 2023, the aggregated value of cryptocurrency locked in all Layer-2 platforms on Ethereum (ETH) reached a new all-time high. It briefly touched $12 billion, but then stabilized near $11.87 billion. The previous historic high was registered on April 17, at $11.85 billion.\n\nImage by L2Beat\n\nIn the last hours, it slightly retraced to $11.81 billion. As such, in USD-denominated value, it added over 114% in the last 12 months despite the pale performance of the cryptocurrency market.\n\nIn terms of Ether-denominated value, the record was registered on Oct. 11, 2023. The ecosystem reached 6.72 million Ether (ETH) locked, while it barely surpassed 3.5 million Ether (ETH) a year ago.\n\nIn the last seven days, the ecosystem of L2s added 10.36% of dollar-denominated TVL. An array of the largest L2s \u2014 Arbitrum, OP Mainnet (formerly Optimism), Starknet, ImmutableX and Loopring \u2014 posted even more impressive gains.\n\nEthereum (ETH), the most crucial asset for L2s, is up by 10.14% in the corresponding period. It revisited a multi-month low over $1,836 two days ago.\n\nArbitrum, OP Mainnet remain undisputed, rivalry rages for #3\n\nMeanwhile, the sphere of L2s on Ethereum (ETH) remains highly \"whale-dominated.\" The two largest networks \u2014 Arbitrum and OP Mainnet \u2014 are responsible for over 90% of TVL in the ecosystem.\n\nBase, the fastest-growing L2, is protecting the third position with 4.83%. It is followed by zkSync Era and dYdX with 3.8% and 3%, respectively.\n\nAs covered by U.Today previously, dYdX made the most anticipated announcement this week: It is migrating from the L2 model to being a standalone Tendermint-based Layer 1."

        "title": "Solana Vs Ethereum: A Deep-Dive Analysis of Two Popular Coins - CoinGape",
        "content": "In the crypto world, Solana (SOL) and Ethereum (ETH) are two of the most popular crypto coins that have found use cases across the board. While both projects share many similarities, there are still major differences between them. Understanding the key differences between SOL and ETH can help investors and traders make informed decisions to maximize their investments. But what factors should one take into consideration when doing a Solana vs Ethereum analysis? Here, we deep dive into the key aspects that differentiate SOL from ETH and vice versa.\n\nAbout Solana\n\nSolana, or SOL, was created by software developer Anatoly Yakovenko, who first proposed the project in 2017 and finally launched it in 2020. The coin takes inspiration from Etherum and was eventually created to improve upon Etherum. Many crypto enthusiasts and experts considered Solana a potential \u2018Ethereum killer.\u2019\n\nSolana emerged as a new-generation crypto coin that addressed several shortcomings of popular tokens launched before it. The coin\u2019s transactions are conducted on the Solana blockchain, which uses a proof-of-history consensus mechanism instead of a proof-of-work mechanism used by popular initial coins like Bitcoin.\n\nIn layman\u2019s terms, the proof-of-work mechanism depends on miners to unearth the next block and is slow and has a high energy demand. In comparison, the proof-of-history consensus mechanism is fast and requires 99.9% less energy. This is one of the main reasons why Solana took on the likes of Bitcoin and Ethereum right from the beginning.\n\nAbout Ethereum\n\nEthereum, or ETH, which was first proposed by Vitalik Buterin in his white paper in 2013, was finally launched in 2015. Buterin was joined by Gavin Wood, Charles Hoskinson, Amir Chetrit, Anthony Di Iorio, Jeffrey Wilcke, Joseph Lubin, and Mihai Alisie, who further developed and popularised the project its way to the second-largest blockchain project in the world, only behind Bitcoin.\n\nETH is the native currency of Ethereum, a decentralized blockchain that offers smart contract functionality. However, the project was also plagued with issues related to proof-of-work until September 2022, when it shifted to a proof-of-stake mechanism. The move helped it become more fast and reduced its energy needs by over 99%, making it more efficient.\n\nSolana Vs. Ethereum : An Overview\n\nSolana and Ethereum are two of the most widely used crypto tokens globally. But to better understand how these two crypto coins are pitting against each other, we have taken several factors into consideration to provide you with a detailed snapshot.\n\nGoogle Trends: Solana Vs Ethereum\n\nGoogle Trends is one of the key metrics to determine the interest of crypto enthusiasts in particular coins. For the past 12 months in 2023, Ethereum clearly has the edge over Solana in terms of search volumes and interest of the global crypto community.\n\nCaption: Interest over time of Solana and Ethereum {Solana (Blue); Ethereum (Red)}\n\nActive Addresses: Solana Vs. Ethereum\n\nActive Addresses is another important metric that can give you an insight into the adoption of a coin. In simple terms, an active address is a crypto address that has become a direct participant in a successful transaction. It can be either the sender\u2019s or receiver\u2019s address.\n\nActive Addresses Solana\n\nSolana\u2019s active addresses, which peaked at around 39.64 million in April 2022, are nowhere close to its days of glory. However, the token has witnessed a decent rise in active addresses in the last 30 days. In October 2023, active addresses on Solana stood at 5.33 million as of 28 October.\n\nActive Addresses Ethereum\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt that Ethereum is a more popular crypto coin than Solana. Therefore, naturally, the former has a more stable number of active addresses than the latter. In October, Ethereum\u2019s number of active addresses was 10.35 million as of 28 October.\n\nMonthly Transactions (Solana & Ethereum)\n\nMonthly transactions in crypto refer to the buying, selling, and exchanging of digital currencies within a given month. Comparing Ethereum and Solana\u2019s monthly transactions will help you understand which coin is being preferred for transactions by crypto enthusiasts.\n\nSolana Monthly Transactions\n\nNon-vote Solana transactions peaked in November 2021 at 1.5 billion. The last time it was near the 1 billion mark was in July 2022. The number of non-vote transactions has kept fluctuating since then. In October, the number of non-vote transactions showed improvement. As of 28 October, the number of non-vote transactions was up at 550.4 million from 494.7 million in September and 519.83 million in August 2023.\n\nEthereum Monthly Transactions\n\nIn terms of monthly transactions, Ethereum made a record in May 2021, when the token was involved in 20.27 transactions. While ETH\u2019s number of transactions has fallen since then, it has remained stable in the range of 12 million to 17 million. However, in October, the number of Ethereum-based transactions could see a serious fall as it stands at 10.35 million as of 28 October.\n\nAlso Read : Shiba Inu Vs Dogecoin : A Deep Dive Into The Ecosystem\n\nPrice Chart: Solana Vs Ethereum\n\nAnalyzing and comparing Solana and Ethereum price charts can provide key insights that can help in making informed decisions. CoinGape price comparison chart above demonstrates price trend and market performances of both Solana and Ethereum. While Ethereum price is up by over 85%, Solana price is surging significantly by more than 450% as of December 2023 in the last 12 months.\n\nMarket Cap & Trading Volume: Solana Vs Ethereum\n\nThe market cap of cryptocurrencies gives an indication of the coin\u2019s value and size. Ethereum, being the more popular crypto coin, clearly has a higher market cap of over $284 billion while Solana has a market cap of $32billion. On the other hand, Ethereum\u2019s circulating supply at present stands at 120.2 million and that of Solana\u2019s is at 425.9 million.\n\nComing to the trading volume of both the cryptocurrencies, Ethereum\u2019s trading volume stands at over $12 billion with a decrease of 23% in the last 24 hours as of December 9, 2023. And, Solana\u2019s trading volume is more than $3 billion and is down by 21% in the last 24 hours.\n\nConclusion : Which coin is more popular ?\n\nEthereum and Solana are two of the most popular cryptocurrencies in today\u2019s time. Both the coins have found several use cases, and are witnessing an increased adoption in multiple areas. At present, with a larger market cap and higher active addresses, it\u2019s clear that Ethereum is finding more traction among crypto users. However, Solana, which faced a massive setback after its links with FTX were found, is gaining the lost ground, and could soon again give a tough competition to Ethereum. In all likelihood, it\u2019s going to be more interesting from here. Stay tuned!"

        "content": "A widely-followed crypto analyst says the Ethereum (ETH) rival Solana (SOL) is on the verge of another breakout that will outperform ETH and Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nPseudonymous crypto trader Bluntz tells his 225,000 followers on the social media platform X that SOL is one of his main \u201calt picks\u201d and is set to run higher not only in USD terms but also versus BTC (SOL/BTC) and ETH (SOL/ETH).\n\n\u201cSOL still one of my favorite alt picks right now.\n\nStructure on the USD pair looks very much impulsive and like an extended wave three underway and its BTC and ETH pair also still look like they are on the cusp of high timeframe accumulation breakouts.\u201d\n\nBluntz utilizes the Elliot Wave Theory in his technical analysis. The theory aims to predict price impulses based on crowd psychology, which tends to manifest in waves. Based on his chart, the analyst suggests that SOL is in the midst of a five-wave impulse to the upside that could top out near the $47 range before making its next move.\n\nWhen asked why he\u2019s so zeroed in on Solana, Bluntz says he\u2019s confident that SOL will outperform BTC and ETH in the near future.\n\nLooking at Bitcoin, the trader says that BTC\u2019s price action strongly suggests that more upside action is imminent and that a dip to $32,000 is unlikely at this point. He forecasts that BTC will make another impulse upward after consolidating within a bullish triangle pattern.\n\n\u201cThe fact that BTC is showing acceptance at these levels after that strong breakout of $32,000 is quite bullish in my opinion.\n\nI don\u2019t think we retest $32,000 at all, too many people missed the move and want that retest and I don\u2019t think the market will give it to them.\n\nI anticipate this to probably end up as a triangle and break higher.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $33,957.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Share:\n\nEthereum price has seen a near-15% ascent in the last since October 22.\n\nDespite the recent rally, ETH needs to hold above the $1,727 and $1,650 barriers to move higher.\n\nA daily candlestick close below $1,650 will invalidate the bullish thesis.\n\nEthereum (ETH) price is in a good position after last week\u2019s rally. But things are not a given, as bulls need to defend a few key levels before they\u2019re in the clear. Investors need to watch the key barriers to know where ETH will head next.\n\nEthereum price at critical point\n\nEthereum (ETH) price has cleared the $1,650, $1,670 and $1,727 hurdles as it rallied 19% between October 19 and 25. This move created a local top at $1,865 and is contemplating its next move.\n\nGoing forward, investors can expect Ethereum price to retrace the aforementioned barriers and finda support. This move will allow the daily Relative Strength Index (RSI) to reset at the 50 mean level, further adding credence to the bullish thesis.\n\nA strong bounce could send Ethereum price to tag the $2,000 psychological level as well as the range high at $2,030. The last time ETH tried to overcome this hurdle in mid-April, it failed. So, a move into this zone will be critical for the long-term outlook of the smart contract token.\n\nClearing the $2,030 hurdle or flipping it into a support floor will open the path to the next key resistance level at $2,424.\n\nRead more: Ethereum\u2019s Dencun upgrade is a step toward a scalable settlement layer: Goldman Sachs\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nWhile the bullish outlook makes logical sense, it is dependent on Ethereum price holding above the $1,727 barrier. A daily candlestick close below this level that leads to a breakdown of the $1,650 support level will invalidate the bullish thesis.\n\nIn such a case, Ethereum price could revisit $1,551 or slide lower to collect the sell-side liquidity resting below swing lows formed on September 10 and October 10.\n\nAlso read: Top 3 Price Prediction Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple: Crypto markets turn bullish on ETF approval hopes"

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH), a leading player in the cryptocurrency market, has recently witnessed a significant surge in its price, outperforming many of its counterparts. With the current price of Ethereum standing at approximately $1,790.45, the market is abuzz with speculation and predictions about its potential to reach new heights. Will Ethereum reach $2,000 soon? Let\u2019s analyze in this Ethereum price prediction article.\n\nWhy is Ethereum Price Up?\n\nThe recent uptick in Ethereum\u2019s price can be attributed to the overall bullish sentiment in the cryptocurrency market. This positive trend has been fueled by the anticipation of Bitcoin ETFs and the consequent rise in Bitcoin prices, which has positively influenced the entire crypto market. Ethereum, already a strong contender in the space, has benefited from this market optimism, further solidifying its position.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction: Will Ethereum reach $2,000?\n\nWhile Ethereum\u2019s current trajectory is promising, the market may experience a correction, potentially leading to a decrease of around 20% in ETH\u2019s price. However, if the momentum in the Bitcoin market continues to build, Ethereum is likely to follow suit. Current predictions place Ethereum\u2019s potential price between $2,000 and $2,500 in the near future. These targets, while ambitious, are increasingly plausible given the current market dynamics.\n\nIs it Good to Buy Ethereum Crypto?\n\nWith Ethereum\u2019s price currently near the significant support level of $1,680, this could be an opportune moment for investors to consider purchasing ETH. Implementing a strategy that includes a stop loss trigger slightly below the support level could be a prudent approach, allowing investors to manage risk while positioning themselves to benefit from potential upward price movements.\n\nHow to Buy Ethereum Token\n\nFor those interested in buying Ethereum, Bitget stands out as a recommended exchange. Known for its low fees and user-friendly interface, Bitget offers a seamless experience for both new and seasoned traders looking to buy and sell Ethereum. Given Ethereum\u2019s current price trend and the optimistic market outlook, now might be a strategic time to consider adding ETH to your cryptocurrency portfolio.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou might also like\n\nMore from Altcoin"

        "content": "Comsos\u2019 active users increased by 182% in the last 30 days.\n\nThe project was shifting market sentiment at press time.\n\nOver the last 30 days, Daily Active Users on Cosmos [ATOM] grew by 182%, data by Token Terminal revealed. Thus, the number of active addresses grew at a faster pace compared to Bitcoin [BTC], Ethereum [ETH], and Coinbase\u2019s L2 Base.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s ATOM\u2019s market cap in BTC\u2019s terms\n\nIt seemed necessary to compare Cosmos to Bitcoin and Ethereum because they are the top two blockchains, in a nutshell. For Base, since its introduction, it has amassed a lot of adoption.\n\nHowever, the hype and activity around Base has dropped significantly. In fact, Token Terminal showed that the project\u2019s Daily Active Users reduced by 12.5%.\n\nThe Daily Active Users can offer vital information about a network\u2019s health. Aside from being a metric that measures user adoption, the metric can indicate a shift in market sentiment. Sometimes, it also has a big impact on token prices.\n\nMore data transport, more growth\n\nSurprisingly, Cosmos\u2019 native token ATOM did not feel the impact of the active user growth. At press time, the ATOM\u2019s value was $7.02\u2014 a similar price it was 30 days back.\n\nOne of the factors that influenced the increase could be linked to the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol expansion to the Binance Smart Chain. The IBC is an open-source protocol developed to handle the movement of data between blockchains.\n\nBased on AMBCrypto\u2019s report a few weeks ago, the expansion would also offer more opportunities for those involved in staking ATOM. Besides that, Cosmos is also making movies to ensure that it lasts long in the list of blockchains with a good level of development activity.\n\nThe project seems to be using its builders\u2019 program to this effect.\n\nSentiment goes sideways\n\nInterestingly, Santiment\u2019s data showed that the efforts are paying off for Comsos, as indicated by the Development Activity metric. Development Activity shows the commitment of developers to ensure the proper functioning of a network.\n\nAt press time, Cosmos\u2019 development had jumped to 16.22. This means that there has been an increase in the number of features shipped via the project. Cosmos also experienced an up-and-down trend in terms of market awareness.\n\nTo measure perception, on-chain platform Santiment uses the Weighted Sentiment metric. This metric tracks the positive/commentary about a project via social media platforms.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ATOMs worth today?\n\nAn increase in Weighted Sentiment means a surge in positive comments. Conversely, a decrease means a growing negative perception.\n\nFrom the data above, Cosmos\u2019 Weighted Sentiment was 0.365. Looking at the chart, the comments about the project were largely positive as of press time. However, the optimism seemed to be waning."

        "content": "The core developer team behind Ethereum has separated ERC from EIPs and created a new repository for all ERCs.\n\nA proposal to distinguish both from one Github repository was shared with the Ethereum community in July, which sought to split ERC specifications into a new repository. This way, the EIPs would only be associated with core improvement proposals.\n\nAfter years of discussion, the split of ERC and EIP in Ethereum has officially been completed. The goal of ERC is to provide standardized and high-quality documentation for the Ethereum application layer and track past and ongoing improvements to application standards; while the\u2026 \u2014 Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) October 28, 2023\n\nEthereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) are improvements that are centered around changes in the Ethereum network\u2019s consensus layer. Whereas ERCs (Ethereum Request for Comments) are application related changes that do not have any impact on core network capability.\n\nThe separation has been discussed for years, but it has not received much attention. \u201cFor years, we\u2019ve considered separating the repository,\u201d stated the proposal. \u201cThis would allow ERC and EIP specifications to evolve more naturally due to their independence.\u201d\n\nNow the community has made a decision to draft EIPs separately as Ethereum\u2019s consensus layer began utilizing the EIP process. An additional repository has been created to store Ethereum comment requests (ERCs)."

        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction: In the past two weeks, the Ethereum price has mounted an impressive comeback, rising from $1,527 to a peak of $1,867\u2014a 22.6% surge that has allowed it to reclaim crucial resistance levels at $1,600 and $1,700. Despite this, the asset is facing headwinds as Bitcoin struggles to break past the $35,000 mark, leading to increased selling pressure across the crypto market. This has caused the ETH recovery to stall around the $1,800 level, raising questions about an impending correction.\n\nAlso Read: Mike Novogratz\u2019s Galaxy Digital Going Long On Bitcoin And Ethereum: Lookonchain\n\nadvertisement\n\nWedge Pattern Governs the Current Correction Trend\n\nThe daily candles projecting rejecting wicks on either side reflect uncertainty among market participants.\n\nA bearish breakdown below the $1750 support put Ethereum coin 15% downside risk\n\nThe intraday trading volume in Ether is $6.6 Billion, indicating a 17% gain.\n\nSource- Tradingview\n\nOver the past seven months, the Ethereum coin price has witnessed a correction trend under the influence of a falling wedge pattern. The coin price rebounded thrice from each of the downsloping trendlines, indicating the strong influence this pattern has on market participants.\n\nThe latest recovery stalled around the pattern\u2019s upper trendline, near the $1,850 mark, as sellers continue to defend this territory. The recent price action displays long-wick projections at this resistance level, suggesting that sellers are pressuring the asset for another downward correction.\n\nTaking a bearish outlook, a break below the $1,760 mark could catalyze increased selling, potentially driving the asset back down to the lower trendline near $1,500.\n\nWill ETH Price Regain $2000 Mark?\n\nWhile the current price behavior seems concerning the prevailing bullish sentiment has not been entirely extinguished. If the ETH price can maintain a price above $1,750, there might be an opportunity for buyers to break out from the falling wedge pattern\u2019s upper trendline. Such a breakout would effectively signal the end of the ongoing correction phase, propelling buyers toward an extended recovery with a target at $2,030\u2014an estimated upside of 14%.\n\nExponential Moving Average: A potential bullish crossover between the 20 and 100 EMA slope, could bolster buyers in maintaining current recovery trends.\n\nVortex Indicator: A positive crossover state between the VI+(blue) and VI-(pink) reflects market mood is still bullish."

        "content": "After years of deliberation within the developer community, Ethereum has made a pivotal move in its governance. The Ethereum Github documentation now separates Ethereum Request for Comments (ERC) and Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIP) into different repositories. This separation sets the stage for more effective governance and standards in both the application and consensus layers of Ethereum.\n\nDistinct avenues for application and protocol evolution\n\nSignificantly, ERC has emerged as the primary route for maintaining high-quality documentation related to the Ethereum application layer. According to the updated ERC readme file, this mechanism will serve as an essential resource for tracking the evolution of application standards. This encompasses both historical developments and ongoing improvements.\n\nAdditionally, the core EIP has been delineated as the dedicated channel for the enhancement of Ethereum\u2019s underlying consensus mechanisms. The EIP readme file highlights that its main objective is to maintain standardized documentation for Ethereum itself, along with conventions built upon its blockchain. Furthermore, EIP authors are mandated to foster consensus within the community, meticulously documenting any dissenting opinions that may arise during the evaluation of proposals. Hence, EIPs have become the principal instruments for proposing new features, gathering technical insights, and preserving a transparent record of design choices.\n\nThe EIPs will now focus exclusively on core improvement proposals related to changes in the network\u2019s consensus layer. Conversely, ERCs, which pertain to application-related changes, will no longer affect core network capability.\n\nMoreover, an additional repository has been created specifically for Ethereum Request for Comments (ERCs). This move was deliberated for years, according to an earlier proposal.\n\nHowever, it gained traction recently as Ethereum\u2019s consensus layer began increasingly utilizing the EIP process. The proposal noted that separating the repositories would allow ERC and EIP specifications to evolve more naturally, owing to their newfound independence. Consequently, the Ethereum community finally greenlighted the separation, marking a milestone in the platform\u2019s ongoing evolution.\n\nThis development is seen as a positive step towards focused and efficient governance over Ethereum. By segregating ERCs and EIPs into distinct avenues, the Ethereum community paves the way for precise and well-documented improvements in both the application and consensus layers. However, it remains to be seen how these changes will be operationalized and what impact they will have on Ethereum\u2019s broader ecosystem."
