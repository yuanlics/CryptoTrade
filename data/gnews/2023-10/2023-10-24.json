        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction: Fueled by optimism over the potential approval of a Bitcoin spot ETF, the crypto market has seen a surge in buying activity over the past week. As Bitcoin touched the $35,000 mark for the first time in 2023, the ripple effect extended to altcoins which resulted in an extended recovery sentiment. Thus, the second largest cryptocurrency Ethereum broke through its last swing high resistance at $1,745, signaling more room for an upward journey.\n\nAlso Read: 80% of Bitcoin Holders in Profit, What\u2019s Next? Caution or BTC Price Rally?\n\nadvertisement\n\nIs ETH Price Heading to $2000?\n\nAn upside breakout from the $1745 barrier prepares the ETH price for a 12.5% jump\n\nA bullish crossover between the 20-and-50-day EMA could boost the market buying pressure.\n\nThe intraday trading volume in Ether is $6.6 Billion, indicating a 34% gain.\n\nSource- Tradingview\n\nThe ETH price has been on a seven-day ascent, climbing from an October 19 low of $1,643 to its current trading price of $1,786\u2014a notable 14.10% gain. This upswing enabled Ether to shatter a crucial two-month resistance at $1,745 on October 23, liberating the coin from a sideways range and completing a bullish reversal pattern known as a double bottom.\n\nDespite the rally, the presence of supply pressure near the $1,800 level suggests a possible short-term pullback to retest the $1,745 support. Should the Ethereum price successfully validate this level as new support, it would pave the way for an extended rally targeting the $1,970 to $2,000 range.\n\nAccording to Dow Theory, breaking past the last high resistance of $1,745 could indicate an early sign of a trend reversal for Ethereum.\n\nGlobal In/Out of the Money Metric\n\nSource- intotheblock\n\nAs for on-chain analytics, the Global In/Out of the Money (GIOM) metric reveals that 62.13% of Ethereum addresses are currently in the money, realizing profits, while 34.19% are out of the money and experiencing losses. This suggests that a significant majority of ETH holders are in a profitable position, reducing the likelihood of fear selling in the near term.\n\nRelative Strength Index: the daily RSI above 70% marks reflects the active bullish momentum in the crypto market.\n\nExponential Moving Average: For the anticipated pullback, the 200 EMA slope wavering around the $1730 mark could offer strong support."

        "title": "Do rollups actually scale Ethereum or are we fooling ourselves? - Blockworks",
        "content": "In the quest to scale Ethereum, developers have been busily building mechanisms called \u201crollups\u201d that operate more efficiently \u201con top\u201d of the base chain.\n\nBut what exactly is a rollup? When asked the loaded question, Jon Charbonneau laughs.\n\n\u201cOh, this is gonna be tough,\u201d he says. \u201cThis has been, like, a whole big debate with everyone over the last few months.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s important to get the mental model right, he says, in order to determine the true purpose of a rollup \u2014 and whether it\u2019s a genuine scaling solution for Ethereum. After all, if it\u2019s just building \u201con top\u201d of the chain, is it really scaling the chain?\n\nOn the Lightspeed podcast (Spotify/Apple), the co-founder and partner at crypto investment firm DBA gives a simple definition before elaborating: \u201cA rollup is just some state that you derive off of some data, basically, that is posted on another blockchain, another data layer.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo there\u2019s data posted on Ethereum and I can run some state transition function over that data that says, \u2018Hey, this is the state of my rollup.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is all you really need to have a rollup at a fundamental level.\u201d Everything else, while important, is just a matter of implementation, he says.\n\nThe concept can get a little more convoluted when it comes to bridging \u2014 or not \u2014 back to Ethereum, Charbonneau explains. \u201cIf it lacks this bridge from the base layer to the rollup, well, then what the hell is the point of this thing?\u201d\n\nThe researcher notes that a rollup doesn\u2019t necessarily have to bridge back to the original data layer if it is strictly using the base network for its security properties. He suggests that a developer might decide to use another chain\u2019s consensus and other security benefits instead of bootstrapping their own validators, for example, allowing for a much easier setup.\n\nBut the use cases for such a rollup are \u201cunclear,\u201d Charbonneau says. \u201cYou want to be able to bridge assets around,\u201d he says. \u201cThat is what we are using most of these things for.\u201d\n\nDefining scaling\n\nThe discussion centers on the question: Do rollups actually contribute to scaling Ethereum or are they ultimately just offloading the activity elsewhere?\n\nThe crux of the matter is the meaning of \u201cscaling,\u201d Charbonneau explains. He defines it as \u201ctrying to get more throughput through a system relative to whatever the resource requirements are.\u201d\n\nWith rollups, he says \u201cit\u2019s possible to create more efficient execution environments that, for comparable amounts of resources, do get you a lot more throughput.\u201d\n\nIn regards to the question of whether rollups actually scale Ethereum, Charbonneau admits he doesn\u2019t have \u201cthe perfect answer.\u201d\n\nRead more: Blockchain tech narrative is \u2018lightyears ahead of reality,\u2019 says Dudas\n\nThe answer lies within a \u201cfuzzy line,\u201d he says, \u201cwhich is why a lot of people very reasonably say, \u2018okay, rollups aren\u2019t scaling Ethereum \u2014 you just have to consider the base layer itself.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re generally scaling it if you are using the properties of the underlying system in some way and retaining a lot of the underlying security properties of the system.\u201d\n\nScaling with rollups on Ethereum \u201clets you do a lot more interesting things with your [ether] [ETH] that you couldn\u2019t do on the base layer,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cIf I send my [ETH] to Coinbase, and now I can do whatever I want with Coinbase, that\u2019s not really scaling in my mind at that point,\u201d he says, \u201cbecause you effectively just have no security properties derived from it.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "Ethereum Excellence Could Propel This New ETF - ETF Trends",
        "content": "Ethereum serves as the platform for transactions conducted in the digital currency known as ether. It is widely known as the second-largest crypto asset behind bitcoin.\n\nThat\u2019s not necessarily a bad place to be. With a burgeoning usage case for smart contracts and more, ethereum has its own bull thesis that could match or exceed that of bitcoin. Additionally, as is the case with its larger rival, it has a penchant for drawing eye-catching price forecasts.\n\nPut it all together and there\u2019s a budding case for ethereum in the exchange traded funds wrapper. This a concept being met by new ETFs, including the Bitwise Ethereum Strategy ETF (AETH) . The ETF is less than a month old. It invests in CME-listed ethereum futures contracts with an emphasis on front-month contracts.\n\nAETH Could Be a Well-Timed Ethereum ETF\n\nNew ETFs, regardless of underlying asset class, can benefit from good timing. That perk may be enjoyed by AETH. That is because the fund debuted when an increasing number of cryptomarket participants are forecasting sizable gains for ether.\n\nSome ether bulls believe the digital currency will rise to $10,000, a more than fivefold increase from current levels. That outlook is supported by both attractive fundamentals and bullish technicals.\n\n\u201cFor almost its entire history of price action, ETHUSD has been filling out what appears to be a massive rising wedge pattern. Such patterns are predominantly bearish, breaking down roughly 60% of the time,\u201d reported Tony Severino for NewsBTC. \u201cThat leaves 40% of the time that these patterns break upward. Descriptions of the pattern reveal that wedges are notoriously prone to false breakouts and/or false breakdowns, where price violates one trend line, only to reverse and target the other.\u201d\n\nHow long it takes for ether to make good on the promise of its bullish technical setup remains to be seen. But $10,000 is likely a long way off. Some crypto experts believe that if ethereum can conquer $2,100, a significant near-term rally could be in the offing. Fortunately, there is a fundamental case to support ether\u2019s technical objectives and it could make AETH more appealing.\n\n\u201cEthereum is unlike many other crypto assets in that its value is driven directly by the use of the Ethereum blockchain. Every time people use an application built on Ethereum, they have to pay a fee using the Ethereum asset. This fee is returned to Ethereum investors in a manner similar to stock buybacks and dividends, providing an important starting point for valuations,\u201d according to Bitwise."

        "title": "Market Pumps, But Ethereum Struggles To Keep Up - Is New Yearly High Ahead? - CCN.com",
        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nEthereum is up by 20% from October 11\n\nBreakout has been seen from a descending channel but today\u2019s high is still a lower one\n\nMore upside potential stands but ETH needs to go above $2,000\n\nThe overall cryptocurrency market has witnessed a significant surge, with its capitalization soaring by 30% from its September 11 low, touching a new yearly high of $1.26 trillion. This slight edge over its previous peak in April underscores the market\u2019s bullish momentum.\n\nBitcoin, leading the charge, has set a fresh yearly record, outpacing its previous best by 11%. Altcoins, too, have been on a tear, with some, like MINA, registering eye-popping gains of up to 120%.\n\nIn contrast, Ethereum\u2018s performance, while commendable, hasn\u2019t quite matched the fervor seen in other coins. Since October 11, it has appreciated by 21%, a respectable figure but somewhat muted compared to the broader market\u2019s exuberance. Currently trading around $1,800, it remains 15% shy of its yearly peak of $2,100.\n\nETH Price Analysis\n\nEthereum\u2019s trajectory since its June 18 low last year has been relatively more optimistic than many of its peers. It embarked on a recovery journey, marking a higher low in November and subsequently achieving a higher peak in April compared to its August high.\n\nPost its $2,100 zenith, Ethereum managed to maintain its value above the $1,500 threshold, charting its course within a descending channel. This resilience stands in stark contrast to several altcoins that plummeted to new bearish lows post-April.\n\nThis descending trajectory Ethereum found itself in likely represented a corrective phase, characterized by a five-wave pattern. However, the tide seems to be turning. Starting from October 11, Ethereum has been exhibiting bullish signals, culminating in a breakout from this channel.\n\nThe rise of Ethereum from November 21 to mid-April presents an analytical conundrum. The movement, characterized by a five-wave impulse, is somewhat ambiguous in its interpretation due to the higher low on November 21.\n\nThis could mean that the surge is merely an extension of the previous ascending structure, rendering it a corrective phase rather than a new bullish cycle.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s an alternative, more optimistic perspective. If we consider this rise as a smaller segment within a broader framework, it could be interpreted as just the initial sub-wave of a more extensive five-wave impulse.\n\nUnder this assumption, the descending channel that followed would represent the second wave of this larger cycle. If this interpretation holds, Ethereum could be poised for a significant upward trajectory. Wave 3, in this context, could propel the price to around $3,310. And if the momentum sustains, wave 5 could push the price even further, breaking previous boundaries.\n\nGiven the undeniable corrective nature of the descending channel, the odds currently favor a continuation of the upward trend for Ethereum. But does this imply an imminent new yearly high?\n\nThe current high, just a touch above $2,000, remains shy of the July 14 peak. By the tenets of technical analysis, this positions Ethereum in a downtrend since mid-April.\n\nHowever, a breach above the $2,000 mark, resulting in a higher high, would disrupt this bearish narrative. Such a move would not only signify a reversal of the downtrend but also set the stage for a potential new yearly high. Conversely, if the current surge falters and pivots into a decline, Ethereum might be subjected to further losses before it can embark on a genuine bull run.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nPlease note that the contents of this article are not financial or investing advice.

        "title": "An in-depth look at the Ethereum market in 2023 - crypto.news",
        "content": "Dive deep into Ethereum\u2019s 2023 market journey, focusing on its NFT dynamics, pivotal metrics, and the emerging world of spot ETFs.\n\nIn 2022, the crypto world witnessed an unexpected downturn, with Ethereum (ETH) facing a sharp 68% decline in value.\n\nAlthough 2023 brought a glimmer of hope, with ETH clawing back nearly 35% of its losses amidst a market-wide resurgence, its price of $1,620 as of Oct. 20 still pales in comparison to its once lofty highs.\n\nEthereum has also grappled with a series of challenges recently, dampening its once meteoric rise. A testament to its struggles is the drastic dip in ETH\u2019s total value locked (TVL) \u2014 plummeting from a whopping $108 billion in November 2021 to a mere $20 billion by October, marking an almost 82% drop.\n\nLet\u2019s delve into the dynamics surrounding Ethereum and try to understand the current market sentiments, key metrics, and insights into what lies ahead for this crypto.\n\nDeclining NFT market\n\nIn Jan. 2023, Ethereum\u2019s NFT space witnessed significant headwinds. The bustling activity that saw more than 28,000 NFTs being minted daily on Ethereum at the beginning of the year took a sharp downturn.\n\nETH NFT mints | Source: The Block\n\nAs of Oct. 20, that enthusiasm has waned, with daily mintings dropping below 3,500. This significant 88% decline can be attributed to increased competition from other blockchain networks, a possible oversupply, and the general volatility of the crypto market.\n\nTrading hasn\u2019t been spared either. Platforms like OpenSea, once brimming with sales, observed a slowdown, particularly after the first quarter, hitting their lowest ebb by Sep. Moreover, from Q1 to Q2 2023, Ethereum\u2019s NFT trading volume shrank by 39.6%, according to CoinGecko.\n\nParallel to the ebb in NFT momentum, 2023 also marked the entry of Ethscriptions. Launched in June, this platform aimed to transform the NFT space by allowing users to inscribe \u201cnon-financial data\u201d on Ethereum\u2019s network.\n\nHowever, its journey was riddled with hurdles. A major setback occurred when a prominent collection named Ethereum Punks had to be withdrawn from Ethscriptions\u2019 official platform.\n\nAt the request of Yuga Labs, the owner of CryptoPunks, I am taking down the Ethereum Punks website, removing all Ethereum Punks images from https://t.co/ZcR9HKlexS, and deleting my Tweets that reference Ethereum Punks, including my Tweet introducing the Ethscriptions Protocol. \u2014 Middlemarch (@dumbnamenumbers) July 11, 2023\n\nThis action was taken upon a request from Yuga Labs, the entity behind CryptoPunks. The ripple effect of this removal was evident as it led to the deletion of numerous tweets by the creator of Ethscriptions, Middlemarch, including the pivotal one introducing the Ethscriptions Protocol.\n\nThese challenges faced by Ethereum\u2019s NFT and Ethscriptions hint at broader concerns within the Ethereum ecosystem, shedding light on competitive, regulatory, and inherent protocol-based challenges.\n\nWhat do the metrics suggest?\n\nSeveral critical metrics can gauge Ethereum\u2019s health and vibrancy. Let\u2019s delve into these to unravel their story about Ethereum in 2023.\n\nETH daily transactions\n\nThese represent the number of transactions processed on the Ethereum blockchain within a day. In May 2023, this number averaged around 1.14 million, but by Oct. 20, it had diminished to 980,000, marking a 14% decline.\n\nEthereum daily transactions | Source: The Block\n\nWhy does this matter? A high transaction count typically indicates robust network usage and utility, making it a bellwether of network health.\n\nYou might also like: Vitalik Buterin discusses Ethereum\u2019s future and innovative projects in AMA\n\nThe reduction hints at a reduced activity level, possibly due to competition from other blockchains or waning enthusiasm from users and developers.\n\nDaily active addresses\n\nThis metric denotes the number of unique addresses that actively send or receive Ethereum on a given day. In April 2023, the daily active addresses averaged 471,000, but this number dwindled to 369,000 by Oct. 20, showcasing a 21.7% drop.\n\nEthereum active addresses | Source: The Block\n\nIts significance lies in its ability to act as a pulse check for user engagement and network popularity. A declining trend in active addresses might imply that fewer users or entities are interacting with the Ethereum network, possibly signaling a shift of interest or a consolidation phase.\n\nDaily onchain volume\n\nRepresenting the total value (in USD) of all transactions on the Ethereum blockchain in a day, the daily onchain volume has witnessed a steady decline. From a substantial $3.92 billion in March, it shrank to $1.41 billion by Oct. 20, reflecting a 64% reduction.\n\nEthereum daily on-chain volume | Source: The Block\n\nThis metric is crucial because it sheds light on the monetary value of assets moving within the network. A decline might suggest that fewer high-value transactions are taking place or that the value of assets on Ethereum has decreased.\n\nETH transaction fee\n\nTransaction fees are payments made by users to compensate for the computational energy required to process and validate transactions on the Ethereum network. These fees had reached a staggering annual peak of $21.89 in May but have since nosedived to a mere $1.99 by Oct. 20, indicating a 90.9% decline.\n\nEthereum transaction fee | Source: The Block\n\nWhile high fees can be discouraging for users, leading to decreased network usage, the sharp decline might indicate improved network efficiency or reduced demand.\n\nNonetheless, it\u2019s a double-edged sword. While it\u2019s more cost-effective for users, it might be less profitable for miners, possibly leading to decreased network security in the long run.\n\nEthereum\u2019s layer 2 evolution in 2023\n\nIn 2023, Ethereum\u2019s layer 2 solutions (L2s) saw increased activity. As Ethereum faced various challenges, L2s emerged as an alternative solution, particularly in addressing scalability.\n\nThe TVL of Ethereum\u2019s L2 platforms reached $10.62 billion as of Oct. 2023. Of these platforms, Arbitrum One recorded a market share of 54.76%. This TVL growth suggests a heightened activity within the L2 platforms.\n\nMeanwhile, centralized exchanges have begun to integrate L2 solutions. Coinbase\u2018s introduction of layer 2 Base indicates a growing interaction between centralized platforms and L2s.\n\nYou might also like: Coinbase launches Ethereum L2 network, Base\n\nIn terms of transaction activity, L2s recorded a higher transaction count than Ethereum\u2019s mainnet during the year. This shift might be attributed to factors such as scalability issues and transaction costs on Ethereum\u2019s mainnet.\n\nOn the financial front, Ethereum\u2019s network revenue experienced a decline, decreasing by 33.3% from $1.27 billion in Q2 2022 to $847 million in Q2 2023. The value of ETH burned also saw a reduction of 35% over the same period. These changes align with the fluctuations observed in the broader crypto market.\n\nEthereum\u2019s position in the decentralized finance sector, however, continues to be notable. The platform constitutes a considerable portion of DeFi\u2019s TVL and is used for multiple on-chain stablecoins.\n\nIn summary, 2023 observed varied dynamics in Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem, with L2 solutions gaining traction amid the platform\u2019s overarching challenges.\n\nEthereum and the influence of spot ETFs\n\nMeanwhile, ETFs have taken center stage recently, with their potential to impact the price and adoption of cryptocurrencies significantly.\n\nGalaxy Digital Fund and Invesco have recently joined forces to delve into the Ethereum spot ETF market in the U.S. This makes them the fifth major player to do so, following in the footsteps of renowned entities like VanEck, ARK Invest, Hashdex, and Grayscale.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s crucial to note that the road ahead for Ethereum spot ETFs is not without hurdles. In many ways, these spot ETFs\u2019 fate is tied to that of Bitcoin spot ETFs.\n\nBefore Ethereum can enjoy the green light for its spot ETFs, Bitcoin spot ETFs are awaiting clearance from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Essentially, Ethereum\u2019s move is pegged to Bitcoin\u2019s lead in this dance of financial products.\n\nTheir introduction could play a pivotal role in influencing Ethereum\u2019s price, adoption, and mainstream acceptance in the financial market.\n\nEthereum price prediction\n\nStandard Chartered\u2019s Geoff Kendrick is optimistic about Ethereum, predicting it could surge past $8,000 and possibly reach between $26,000 and $35,000 by 2025-2026. He cites Ethereum\u2019s growing use cases and the support from layer 2 blockchains as drivers for this growth.\n\nContrarily, analyst FieryTrading expects Ethereum to dip to around $900.\n\nWith such varied forecasts, traders should tread cautiously. It\u2019s vital to remember: never invest more than you can afford to lose.\n\nThe road ahead\n\nAs we approach the end of 2023, Ethereum\u2019s journey has been a roller coaster of highs and lows. From a peak TVL of $108 billion in 2021 to a significant dip to $20 billion this year, it reflects the volatility and uncertainty surrounding the crypto realm.\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum\u2019s once-booming NFT market has also faced headwinds, with daily mintings witnessing a sharp decline.\n\nLayer 2 solutions, like Arbitrum, have provided a silver lining, offering scalable alternatives and showing promise for Ethereum\u2019s scalability concerns.\n\nEthereum\u2019s next significant catalyst might lie in the realm of spot ETFs. With major players like Galaxy Digital Fund and Invesco entering the fray, the potential for Ethereum spot ETFs to drive price, adoption, and mainstream acceptance is palpable.\n\nYet, amidst optimistic forecasts of Ethereum reaching dizzying heights, caution is crucial. The crypto market remains unpredictable, and prudent decision-making remains the order of the day.\n\nYou might also like: Fake news on Bitcoin ETF approval: How rumors can sway the crypto market\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

ETH is rising, but it might struggle to clear the $1,850 resistance.\n\nEthereum started a steady increase above the $1,750 resistance.\n\nThe price is trading above $1,780 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere is a key bullish trend line forming with support near $1,750 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair could struggle to clear the $1,850 and $1,880 resistance levels.\n\nEthereum Price Jumps 10%\n\nEthereum remained in a positive zone above the $1,650 support zone. The recent pump in Bitcoin above the $34,000 resistance sparked more upsides in ETH. There was a steady increase above the $1,720 and $1,750 resistance levels.\n\nThe price even cleared the key $1,800 resistance zone. A high is formed near $1,849 and the price is now consolidating gains. It is trading well above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $1,660 swing low to the $1,849 high.\n\nEthereum is now trading above $1,780 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is also a key bullish trend line forming with support near $1,750 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The trend line is near the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $1,660 swing low to the $1,849 high.\n\nOn the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $1,850 level. The first major resistance is near the $1,880 zone. A close above the $1,880 resistance could send the price further higher. The next key resistance is $1,920, above which the price could accelerate higher.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nIn the stated case, Ether could start a strong increase toward the $2,000 resistance. Any more gains might open the doors for a move toward $2,200.\n\nDownside Correction in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $1,850 resistance, it could start a downside correction. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,800 level.\n\nThe next key support is $1,750 and the trend line zone. A downside break below the $1,750 support might send the price further lower. In the stated case, the price could drop toward the $1,700 level. Any more losses may perhaps send Ether toward the $1,650 level and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bullish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now above the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $1,750\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $1,850\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "Why Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin Rallied Today - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "The prices of several major cryptocurrencies jumped on Tuesday amid increased speculation over the imminent approval of the first spot Bitcoin (BTC 7.61%) exchange-traded fund (ETF) by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). As of the regular markets' close on Tuesday, Bitcoin was up more than 9%, Ethereum (ETH 4.67%) had gained nearly 7%, and Dogecoin (DOGE 25.97%) had risen 5.5%.\n\nFresh signs of the first spot Bitcoin ETF approvals\n\nLate Monday, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas pointed out on social media platform X that BlackRock's (BLK 1.14%) iShares Bitcoin Trust had been listed on the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) website (the organization that clears all Nasdaq trades) with the planned ticker symbol IBTC. The news subsequently garnered so much attention that the DTCC website briefly crashed due to overwhelming traffic.\n\nIndeed, Tuesday's optimism followed a significant rally in cryptocurrency prices last week, which was spurred by the SEC's reported decision not to appeal a federal court's August reversal of its order preventing crypto asset manager Grayscale from converting its widely popular Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC 5.86%) into an ETF.\n\nSure enough, late Monday the D.C. Circuit of Appeals formalized Grayscale's court win over the SEC, indicating no appeal was filed and putting the onus back on the SEC to move forward with its approval process. The court described the SEC's order preventing Grayscale from converting its bitcoin trust into an ETF -- while simultaneously allowing bitcoin futures funds to launch -- \"arbitrary and capricious.\"\n\n\"This is pretty much checking every box that you need to check before you launch an ETF,\" Balchunas added, noting the timing of the ticker's appearance on the site was \"surprising\" considering any formal approval of a spot bitcoin ETF by the SEC was widely expected to happen sometime over the next several weeks.\n\nWhy the first Bitcoin ETFs are likely still several weeks away\n\nYou shouldn't hold your breath waiting for an imminent approval of the first spot Bitcoin ETFs. Eagle-eyed investors noticed early Tuesday that BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust was no longer present on the DTCC's list this morning -- a change Balchunas speculated may have happened after BlackRock was \"told to or want[ed] to wait until they are days, not weeks or months away\" from the SEC's formal approval.\n\nIt's hard to blame BlackRock, of course, for ensuring all the pieces are in place to move forward as soon as that approval hits the wires. For perspective, the SEC's final deadline to respond to BlackRock's application is March 15, 2024. According to a research report released last week by JPMorgan, however, the first approvals of spot Bitcoin ETFs will most likely arrive before January 10, 2024 -- the final deadline by which the SEC is required to respond to ARK Invest's open application for its \"21Shares\" bitcoin ETF. At that time -- rather than responding to individual applications separately over the course of several months -- the SEC will most likely approve multiple applications at once to level the playing field and prevent any single bitcoin ETF from gaining a so-called \"first-mover\" advantage.\n\nSo why is this a big deal for cryptocurrencies in general? Exchange-traded funds are a much more investor-friendly medium compared to creating separate investment accounts through cryptocurrency trading firms, enabling people to buy and sell shares throughout each trading day through any brokerage firm. Any approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF would significantly broaden investors' access to cryptocurrencies as a widely accepted asset class and source of portfolio diversification.\n\nAs a result, tens of billions of dollars of incremental liquidity would almost certainly flow into cryptocurrencies in short order, likely driving prices even higher in the near term. According to a report from data analytics firm CryptoQuant last week, the overall cryptocurrency market capitalization could ultimately increase by a total of more than $1 trillion after Bitcoin ETFs are approved and become mainstream.\n\nIn any case, it now seems a matter of if, not when we see the SEC finally give its stamp of approval to the first Bitcoin ETFs. Cryptocurrency investors are rightly enthused by the news."

Probably not yet as all short-term focus will be on BTC combined with halving April next year. This is something that might pick up post BTC halving.\u201d\n\nETH/BTC is trading for 0.0526 BTC ($1,771) at time of writing.\n\nHe notes that crypto is potentially one of the best investments due to its global reach.\n\n\u201cThe biggest lesson from the past 10-15 years of financial market is the best investments to own are generally assets that attract global demand in nature and ideally US dollars denominated. What other assets attract global demand and USD denomination besides US equities and fixed incomes? Crypto.\u201d\n\nLastly, he suggests that Solana (SOL) is poised for a correction after a big rally and he suggests other altcoins may start breaking out next.\n\n\u201cMost of the market attention is on SOL but there are some names that are not that far behind with way less attention and not as overbought.

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nEthereum-based memecoins including PEPE have been among the biggest gainers of the recent crypto market rally.\n\nThe price of Pepe coin has climbed over 37% in 24 hours.\n\nIn tandem with the flood of memecoin transactions, Ethereum gas fees have also spiked.\n\nWith Bitcoin currently trading at its highest price since the spring of 2022, it has lifted the entire crypto market. Among the top-gainers of the past 24 hours, several ERC-20 memecoins stand out for their Bitcoin-beating performance.\n\nAs the price of prominent meme tokens has increased, trading activity has exploded. But with an increase in the volume of transactions, Ethereum gas fees spiked to as high as 80 gwei on Tuesday, October 24, and have remained above average since.\n\nMeme Token Transaction Counts Surge\n\nIn the last 24 hours, ERC-20 the number of memecoin transactions has surged in tandem with significant price gains for some of the most popular tokens.\n\nLeading the charge, the volume of Pepe transactions increased by 220% over the course of a day, thanks to more than 14,000 individual transfers. During the same period, the token\u2019s price increased by over 37%, helped along by news that the PEPE administrators had burned 6.9 trillion PEPE coins worth around $6M.\n\n6.9T $PEPE Tokens worth ~$6,000,000 have been burned. https://t.co/aN5LRUFz8u A new team of advisors have been brought on to guide Pepe forward.

Moreover, a notable overlap between previous periods of high fees and past memecoin frenzies points to a positive correlation between fee gas prices and memecoin trading activity.\n\nPeaking just after 11 pm (UTC) on Monday, October 23, median gas fees briefly hit 80 gwei and have averaged 34.9 gwei during the past 24 hours.\n\nIn contrast, just 3 weeks ago, on October 8, the average Ethereum transaction fees dropped to 8.8 gwei, their lowest price since October 2022.\n\nHow Memecoins Affect Ethereum Gas Fees\n\nWith the exception of Dogecoin, the most popular memecoins today utilize the ERC-20 token standard, and therefore incur Ethereum gas fees each time they are transferred from one address to another.\n\n\ud83d\ude80 Meme coins pump, #Ethereum gas fees spike 400% $PEPE , $BITCOIN, and $SPX meme coins surge as much as 40% in the past 24 hours, driving #Ethereum gas fees to a high of over 45 #gwei . pic.twitter.com/4XgrrhoA4Z \u2014 Satoshi Talks (@Satoshi_Talks) October 24, 2023\n\nBut gas fees aren\u2019t fixed at a set rate. Instead, their price fluctuates dynamically according to the level of network activity. When the number of transactions being processed by the Ethereum mainnet increases, so do gas fees. Conversely, when network activity declines, gas prices get cheaper.\n\nConsidering that memecoins make up some of the most actively traded ERC-20 tokens, it follows that a spike in meme coin transactions could bump gas fees for the entire Ethereum network."

        "title": "Ethereum Set To Outperform: Crypto Analyst Predicts 18% Rise To $1,900 - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) has so far relatively underperformed in comparison to the flagship cryptocurrency Bitcoin. However, that could change soon enough as a crypto analyst has predicted the second-largest crypto token by market to gain some momentum soon enough.\n\nEthereum To Hit $1900\n\nIn a post shared on his X (formerly Twitter) platform, prominent crypto analyst Ali Martinez mentioned that Ethereum could rise to as high as $1,900. His prediction was based on data that he had pulled up from the chart which he shared in his post.\n\nThe chart (a 3-day timeframe) featured an ascending triangle pattern, which usually represents a bullish formation. According to Ali, Ethereum is \u201cpoised\u201d to rebound off the hypotenuse of the ascending triangle. Most importantly, for Ethereum to go as high as $1,900, the analyst noted that It has to experience a \u201cfirm close\u201d above the 18-day SMA (Simple Moving Average).\n\nETH getting ready to breakout | Source: X\n\nIf that happens, Ethereum could hit $1,800 and further rise to $1,900 based on Ali\u2019s predictions. It is worth mentioning that the last time Ethereum hit $1,900 was back in July 2023. A rise to that price again will represent about an %18 increase from its current price of $1,600.\n\nAli also had something to say about the flagship cryptocurrency, Bitcoin. In a subsequent post, he noted that the crypto token could see a correction to $28,800; a prediction he made based on the TD Sequential from a 4-hour chart.\n\nBitcoin rose to as high as $30,000 on October 20, with many speculating that a Spot Bitcoin ETF approval could be on the way, something that represents a bullish momentum for Bitcoin and the crypto market in general.\n\nETH price holding $1,600 | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Dominance Is On The Rise\n\nData from TradingView shows that Bitcoin\u2019s dominance has been on the rise this year, with the token currently boasting over 52% coin dominance in the crypto market. Interestingly, it has steadily risen since the Ethereum Merge occurred.\n\nThis is significant considering that many speculated that \u2018the Flippening\u2019 could happen after the Merge, where Ethereum overtakes Bitcoin to become the most dominant crypto token. However, that hasn\u2019t happened so far, with Ethereum\u2019s move from proof-of-work to proof-of-work being seen as \u2018disastrous\u2019 for the crypto token.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum, however, share the podium when it comes to the best-performing assets of the year. Both crypto tokens are said to have outperformed the NASDAQ, S&P500, and Gold. Bitcoin has seen an %80 increase year-to-date (YTD), while Ethereum has seen a %35 increase YTD.\n\nFeatured image from Analytics Insight, chart from Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) is poised for a significant breakthrough as it inches closer to the critical psychological barrier of $2,000, mirroring the bullish sentiment sweeping through the cryptocurrency market, largely led by Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nMarket analysts are optimistic about Ethereum\u2019s potential breakout before October ends, with buy orders anticipated to fuel a substantial 12.25% surge, propelling the price to $1,958.\n\nIn addition, investors have steadfastly held onto their investments in DeFi assets within the Ethereum ecosystem, demonstrating unwavering confidence even in the face of the enduring crypto market challenges.\n\nDespite the tumultuous nature of the crypto market, these investors remain committed to the potential and promise of DeFi, believing in its ability to revolutionize traditional financial systems.\n\nAs per insights provided by DefiLlama, these assets collectively represent an impressive total value locked at $21.27 billion, reflecting the substantial trust and financial commitment placed in the Ethereum DeFi landscape by the investor community. This data solidifies its position as a cornerstone of the broader crypto financial landscape.\n\nEthereum TVL. Source: DeFiLlama\n\nAs traders eagerly await this upswing, trading volume is projected to witness a notable spike, reflecting growing investor interest in securing exposure to Ether beyond the current resistance levels.\n\nReinforcing the positive outlook, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 75, indicating that Ethereum\u2019s upward trajectory is poised to persist. Nevertheless, caution prevails as oversold conditions may trigger profit-taking among traders keen on safeguarding their capital.\n\nThis dual sentiment of optimism and caution sets the stage for a crucial juncture in Ethereum\u2019s price action.\n\nETH Signs Of Struggle Amidst A Resistance\n\nA separate analytical report underscores Ethereum\u2019s recurring struggle with a key resistance level, evident from the persistent price fluctuations converging around this threshold. Historical data points to the ramifications of prolonged resistance, often resulting in sharp price retracements.\n\nFor Ethereum, this could imply a more pronounced market correction, particularly considering the broader market dynamics currently at play. Investors and traders are advised to closely monitor these resistance levels, which could significantly impact short-term market sentiment and price movements.\n\nETH market cap currently trading at $218.356 Billion on the daily chart: TradingView.com\n\nUnveiling Ethereum: Low Network Activity\n\nUnderlying Ethereum\u2019s price fluctuations, an alarming trend emerges concerning the platform\u2019s subdued network activity. Despite its reputation as a thriving ecosystem for decentralized applications, the recent dip in on-chain operations raises concerns about waning interest or a potential shift of focus towards alternative blockchain platforms.\n\nAn active network isn\u2019t solely reliant on transaction volumes; it signifies ongoing development, upgrades, and the launch of new projects. The recent decline in network activity suggests a potential lull in these critical endeavors, prompting market participants to reevaluate the long-term sustainability of Ethereum\u2019s dominance within the blockchain space.\n\nETH seven-day price action. Source: Coingecko\n\nAs Ethereum\u2019s price hovers at $1,813, notching a 7.0% surge within 24 hours and a 14% upward trend over the past seven days, market observers remain vigilant as the cryptocurrency continues to navigate through critical resistance levels and grapples with network activity concerns.\n\nAs the cryptocurrency market continues to mature, Ethereum\u2019s future trajectory is intricately linked to its ability to address these challenges and uphold its position as a leading blockchain platform, vital for the broader ecosystem\u2019s growth and stability.\n\n(This site\u2019s content should not be construed as investment advice.

I\u2019ve also done this myself from time to time, but it\u2019s worth remembering that there usually isn\u2019t \u2018the next LINK\u2019 or \u2018the next SOL.\u2019\n\nThe next LINK and SOL are going to keep being LINK and SOL IMO (in my opinion).\u201d\n\nThe trader also weighs in on Ethereum (ETH) against Bitcoin (BTC) and predicts ETH/BTC may be at the start of an uptrend based on several indicators, including an engulfing candle.\n\nTraders watch for a bullish engulfing candle since it may suggest an asset\u2019s downtrend is about to undergo a reversal.\n\n\u201cNot only did ETH manage to close the weekly as an engulfing [candle], but also a confirmed weekly bull divergence.\n\nCouple that with the first test of the weekly 200 MA (moving average) on ETH/BTC and I think it\u2019s setting up for quite a nice move up. A very welcome change after months of chop which feels like it might finally have come to an end.\u201d\n\nA bullish ETH/BTC chart suggests that Ethereum will likely outperform Bitcoin.\n\nETH/BTC is trading for 0.0511 BTC ($1,753) at time of writing.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s price has found renewed momentum this week, with bulls attempting to extend the uptrend towards the key $2,000 level.\n\nAfter consolidating under $1,700 for multiple weeks, Ethereum saw a bounce as Bitcoin rallied 15% higher in recent days. This allowed ETH to clear crucial resistance levels at $1,750 and $1,800.\n\nKeypoints\n\nEthereum price has started a decent increase after Bitcoin\u2019s 15% rally, now trading above $1,780.\n\nETH price cleared the $1,750 and $1,800 resistance levels to reach a high of $1,849 before consolidating.\n\nKey support lies at $1,750 where a bullish trendline has formed on the hourly chart.\n\nResistance is seen at $1,850 and $1,880 levels. Breaking $1,880 could accelerate gains toward $2,000.\n\nThe hourly MACD is gaining momentum in the bullish zone, supporting the uptrend.\n\nHowever, failure to clear overhead resistances could lead to a downside correction. Strong support lies at $1,700 and $1,650.\n\nEther hit a weekly high of $1,849 before pulling back slightly. However, the bullish sentiment is evident by the rally clearing the 100-hour SMA and a rising trendline forming on the hourly chart.\n\nThe hourly MACD indicator also flipped bullish, supporting the building upside momentum. Analysts say ETH needs to break above the resistors at $1,850 and $1,880 to sustain the uptrend.\n\nThis could open the doors for an accelerated rally toward the $2,000 mark if buyers can flip these levels into support. Further gains above $2,000 would bring the 2022 high of $2,200 into play.\n\nOn the flip side, failure to hold the $1,750 trendline support could lead to a downward move toward $1,700 and $1,650 in the near-term. Traders expect strong defense of these levels from the bulls.\n\nBut for now, buyers seem to be back in control after weeks of bearish sentiment. The recent surge also comes as Bitcoin reclaimed $34,000, lifting the overall crypto market sentiment.\n\nIf the Ethereum bulls can build on this momentum, we could be in the early stages of a new uptrend after months of depressed prices across crypto assets."

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) has showcased strong performance over the past week, with the token\u2019s price up 15% since Thursday.\n\nWith growing retail and institutional interest, many ETH holders are optimistic about it reaching the $2,000 level before the end of the year.\n\nMeanwhile, the newly launched Bitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX) project is also making waves, offering investors an intriguing opportunity to get in on the ground floor before the token hits the open market.\n\nEthereum Poised to Hit $2,000 Amid Renewed Bullish Momentum\n\nETH is trading around the $1,787 level after posting six bullish daily closes in a row.\n\nThis sharp surge has taken ETH above the 50-day and 200-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) on the daily time frame, indicating that the token\u2019s trend has definitively shifted.\n\nETH has also breached the strong resistance level at $1,740, which had capped price twice since August.\n\nZooming out, the token has emerged from the tight trading range it was trapped in for over two months, signaling newfound bullish momentum that could pave the way toward $2,000 in the near term.\n\nIf ETH were to hit $2,000, it would represent a further 12% push from today\u2019s price and take the token to its highest value since July.\n\nWith spot trading volumes exceeding $11.7 billion in the past day and investor sentiment positive, Ethereum is in a solid position to sustain its trajectory and potentially reach this key milestone in the weeks ahead.\n\nConfluence of Factors Propels Ethereum\u2019s Price Rally\n\nEthereum\u2019s bullish momentum can be attributed to a confluence of positive factors.\n\nFirst, the recent Bitcoin price surge to $35,000 for the first time in over a year is lifting the broader crypto market.\n\nAs the world\u2019s second-largest coin, Ethereum often benefits from Bitcoin\u2019s price rallies.\n\nSecond, Ethereum is surging in part thanks to renewed optimism around a potential spot Bitcoin ETF approval.\n\nIf approved, a spot BTC ETF is expected to bring significant new institutional investment into the crypto space, likely benefiting Ethereum.\n\nLastly, recent outflows from major crypto exchanges, such as over $500 million from Binance in 24 hours, signals that traders are moving assets into secure storage in anticipation of rising crypto prices.\n\nWith all these factors at play, many crypto community members believe Ethereum is poised to continue its surge to $2,000 \u2013 and possibly even higher.\n\nBitcoin Minetrix Also Bullish, Project Offers Exciting New Way to Earn as Crypto Bull Run Accelerates\n\nAs Ethereum and the broader crypto market continue to build momentum, another emerging token that looks well-positioned to surge is Bitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX).\n\nStill, in the early stages of its presale, Bitcoin Minetrix aims to disrupt the world of Bitcoin mining by tokenizing cloud mining credits on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nBy doing this, Bitcoin Minetrix enables everyday investors to gain exposure to BTC mining rewards, not just the coin\u2019s price movements.\n\nGiven Bitcoin\u2019s recent resurgence and the growing expectations of a prolonged bull run, the timing looks ideal for Bitcoin Minetrix to launch and allow users to earn recurring BTC payouts.\n\nNot only that, but Bitcoin Minetrix allows users to stake their BTCMTX tokens to earn yields of 259% per year \u2013 with over 161 million tokens staked already.\n\nEarly investors can buy BTCMTX tokens for just $0.0112 during Stage 3 of the ongoing presale event.\n\nHowever, the presale price will increase by 10% once the stage\u2019s funding goal of $3.1 million has been met \u2013 a milestone expected to be hit in the coming days, given the current investment momentum.\n\nOnce Bitcoin Minetrix\u2019s presale ends, the developers plan to launch BTCMTX on numerous top exchanges, creating additional liquidity and potentially driving up demand.\n\nWith over 4,100 people following the project\u2019s Twitter page and the official Telegram channel seeing robust growth, Bitcoin Minetrix looks primed to capitalize on this engagement and make a strong market entrance.\n\nVisit Bitcoin Minetrix Presale\n\nDisclaimer: The above article is sponsored content; it\u2019s written by a third party.

        "title": "Ethereum (ETH) Price On The Move To $2,000 As DeFi TVL Hits $23 Billion - CoinGape",
        "content": "Ethereum price is on the verge of breaking out and closing in the coveted psychological resistance at $2,000. Interest in the largest smart contracts token has continued to increase with Bitcoin price reclaiming resistance/support at $31,000.\n\nMost traders anticipate a continued bullish action across the market, with ETH following closely in the footsteps of the bellwether cryptocurrency and starting the second recovery phase beyond $2,000 and targeting areas around $2,500 and $3,000 respectively.\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum Price Prediction: ETH On The Cusp of Validating 12% Move\n\nEthereum completed the formation of a double-bottom pattern following a rebound from support at $1,530, which currently awaits validation at $1,745 (neckline resistance).\n\nThe presence of two golden cross patterns formed when the 21-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) (red) crossed above the 1000-day EMA (blue) and subsequently above the 200-day EMA (purple), hints at the uptrend\u2019s continuation.\n\nIf traders keep their buy orders open, they are likely to build momentum for a 12.25% breakout to $1,958. Following the breakout, trading volume is expected to surge significantly as traders seek fresh exposure to Ether above the neckline resistance.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) with a strength of 75 reveals that Ethereum price is in a position to keep the uptrend intact. However, caution is advised due to the oversold conditions likely to encourage traders to sell ETH to book profits, or protect their capital.\n\nBased on the money floor index (MFI), bulls have the upper hand. This indicator tracks the inflow and outflow of money, hence a persistent increase implies that buyers are in control of the uptrend.\n\nThe MFI with a strength of 76 is not yet oversold implying that there is still room for growth. With Ethereum price at $1,690 on Monday, a break above $1,700 is required to secure the uptrend and affirm the bullish outlook to $2,000.\n\nTrading above $2,000 would be a game changer for Ethereum bulls and might be the catalyst the token has been waiting for to start the bull run. On the downside, failure to retain support at $1,670 and $1,630 could trigger another sell-off to $1,550. However, as long as Ethereum holds above all the moving averages, the path with the least resistance will remain to the upside.\n\nEthereum DeFi TVL Grows To $23 Billion\n\nThe transition to the proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism from a proof-of-work (PoW) protocol opened Ethereum to a whole new decentralized finance (DeFi) world backed by the rise of liquid staking tokens like Lido and Rocket Pool.\n\nDespite the lengthy crypto winter, investors have maintained exposure to DeFi products within the Ethereum ecosystem, which according to data by Defi Llama has a total value locked of $21.27 billion. The ecosystem\u2019s 24-hour inflows increased to $45 million with with $1.49 million recorded as revenue.\n\nRelated Articles"

        "content": "Anticipation of a spot Bitcoin ETF being approved has driven up the price of Bitcoin in the past week.\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum\u2019s lack of a \u201ccompelling long-term narrative\u201d and concerns related to Ethereum staking and its implications for the network have moderated its gains.\n\nEthereum\u2019s price in Bitcoin, as tracked by a trading pair called ETHBTC, continues to lose ground amid hype around potential Bitcoin spot ETF approval in the US.\n\nETHBTC fell to 0.051 yesterday, falling to its lowest level this year and slipping close to its June 2022 lows of around 0.049, per TradingView. Traders monitor ETHBTC to gauge the strength of Ethereum against the benchmark cryptocurrency, Bitcoin.\n\nThe last time this ratio dipped below 0.049 was prior to May 2021.\n\nOver the past week, Bitcoin has gained nearly 20% to reach a new yearly peak of $35,157 on Coinbase, likely due to optimism around Bitcoin ETF approval in the US.\n\nStay ahead of the game with our weekly newsletters Subscribe\n\nOn the other hand, Ethereum\u2019s price had a more modest increase of 13.4% during the same period. The asset was last trading 15% lower from its 2023 peak of $2,140.\n\nBitcoin and Solana-based investment products saw inflows of around $112 million and $43 million, respectively, compared to $4.7 million in outflows from Ethereum-based funds this month to date, per a report from digital asset management firm CoinShares published on Monday.\n\nIn fact, Ethereum has experienced the highest outflows this year, totaling $119 million, followed by Tron, per the CoinShares\u2019 report.\n\nJames Butterfill, the head of research at CoinShares, attributed the positive flows in Bitcoin to \u201canticipation of a spot Bitcoin ETF\u201d and \u201ccontinued concerns over Ethereum.\u201d\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nRecently, the market has grown hopeful around an approval by the US securities regulator in light of the recent court victory by Grayscale over a previous rejection and a flurry of applications for Bitcoin spot ETF by traditional finance heavyweights such as BlackRock, Fidelity, and Ark Invest.\n\nBitfinex analysts told DL News that the \u201cprimary bullish narrative for the market has been ETF products\u201d while Ethereum has lacked a \u201ccompelling long-term narrative.\u201d\n\nThey added \u201cevery bullish narrative for Ethereum has resulted in less significant spikes for the Bitcoin-Ethereum ratio.\u201d\n\nBenjamin Jarvis, co-founder of analytics outlet JLabs Digital told DL News that, \u201cInstitutions might feel more comfortable investing in a Bitcoin spot ETF because they perceive it as less risky compared to Ethereum futures.\u201d\n\nEarlier this month, six Ethereum-futures-based ETFs launched in the US. However, their opening trading was sluggish, and they haven\u2019t garnered significant demand since their introduction.\n\nMoreover, the Bitfinex analysts added that \u201cwe are in the early phases of a bull market where it is normal for Bitcoin to move up first and then allow a rotation of capital as investors search for lagging beta plays\u201d like Ethereum.\n\nConcerns over Ethereum\n\nCoinShares analyst Luke Nolan discussed various concerns related to Ethereum staking and its implications for the network in a recent report.\n\nEthereum staking refers to securing the network\u2019s proof-of-stake consensus mechanism by depositing Ether into the staking contract and earning rewards in return.\n\nNolan raised centralisation concerns over Lido, the leading liquid staking derivative platform on Ethereum, which commands a dominant share of 31.5% of all the staked Ether, or 8.7 million Ether\u2014 worth $15.6 billion \u2014 per a Dune dashboard by Hildobby, the pseudonymous head of data at crypto venture fund Dragonfly.\n\nHe also addressed the concern of the growing number of validators. More validators mean more load on the existing validators, which can impact the network\u2019s performance and require significant hardware upgrades.\n\nAn increase in the number of validators also reduces the yields for individual validators, which can lead to an exodus of Ether stakers.\n\nAdditionally, Nolan suggested the possibility of an \u201cuntested economic regime\u201d where the staked Ether market cap becomes larger than the unstaked Ether market cap, which could raise unfounded risk.\n\nLastly, the recent drop in fees and Ethereum turning inflationary also contribute to the lack of demand.\n\nEthereum\u2019s supply has grown at a rate equivalent to 0.37% per annum over the last 30 days as the staking rewards exceeded the amount of Ether burnt in transaction fees, according to Ethereum data tracker ultra sound money.\n\nCorrection: The article has been updated to reflect that 8.7 million Ether was staked via Lido."

        "content": "Elena is an expert in technical analysis and risk management in cryptocurrency market. She has 10+year experience in writing - accordingly she is avid journalists with a passion towards researching new insights coming into crypto erena.\n\nFollowing the news of Bitcoin ETF, the crypto market has gained significant value movement. The information has attracted more institutional traders, resulting in the price experiencing a massive jump in value.\n\nBitcoin price has recorded a surge of over 19% in value in the past week, breaking the price out of its important resistance level of $31,000.\n\nThe Ethereum price has displayed a massive price action in its value and has followed the footsteps of the market leader as it has jumped over 14% within the past week, resulting in the altcoin breaking out of its key resistance at $1,745.26 for the first time in over 50 days, further indicating a bullpower in the market.\n\nTradingView: ETH/USDT\n\nETH price had witnessed a significant fall in its value from $1,850 to $1,650 during mid-August, following which the star altcoin lost momentum and started trading in a closed range of $1,600 and $1,686. The coin attempted to break out and start a bullish jump, but the price repeatedly got rejected at $1,745.26, making it a key resistance level.\n\nFurther, the ETH coin was seen trading under a bearish influence, resulting in the coin breaking down its crucial support level at $1,600. Ethereum then started trading close to its lower support level at $1,539.01 for a short period, following which the market gained momentum.\n\nThe ETH price broke out of multiple resistance levels to test its important resistance level at $1,800 and successfully managed to cross it, but the rally was short-lived as the bears pulled back the price below the $1,800 mark, forming a long wick in the chart.\n\nThe MACD displays a robust rising green histogram in its chart, indicating a massive ongoing price action for the Altcoin. Further, the averages show a rising pattern, suggesting the price to continue rising in the coming days.\n\nWill ETH Price Rise Again?\n\nIf the bulls continue to hold the price and push it above the $1,800 mark, the ETH price will regain momentum and prepare to test the upper resistance level of $1,916.13 soon.\n\nFurther, if the bulls continue to dominate the market, the price will make a run to reclaim its $2,000 mark in the coming month.\n\nConversely, suppose the bears regain power over the bulls, and a trend reversal occurs. In that case, the ETH price will experience a drop below its support level at $1,745.26 and continue to plunge and test its lower support level of $1,686.77 in the coming days.\n\nMoreover, if the bulls fail to hold the price at that level, the price will continue to dip and test its crucial support level at $1,600 in the coming days."

        "content": "Elena is an expert in technical analysis and risk management in cryptocurrency market. She has 10+year experience in writing - accordingly she is avid journalists with a passion towards researching new insights coming into crypto erena.\n\nCryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, experienced an upswing on Monday as the recent bullish trend in the crypto market extended through the weekend. The prospect of a potential approval for a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States added to the positive momentum, resulting in interest from investors.\n\nBitcoin maintained its upward trajectory, climbing over 3% and hovering around the $31,000 mark. Meanwhile, Ethereum also recorded a similar gain with a more than 3% increase, approaching the $1,700 level. Many other altcoins also saw gains.\n\nAccording to analyst Rekt Capital, breaking past the critical resistance level of approximately $31,000 is the last step in negating a bearish Bitcoin pattern. Should it reclaim this level as support or achieve a weekly close above it, this would likely confirm a breakout from the current trading range.\n\nHowever, until that happens, there remains a possibility of a pullback to around the $27,000 level. It\u2019s interesting to note that, historically, Bitcoin retraced around -25% in 2015 and -38% in 2019 during similar points in its market cycle, less than 190 days before the Halving event.\n\nCrypto Tony, another market analyst, highlighted the cyclical nature of the cryptocurrency market, noting that Bitcoin tends to lead the way with liquidity moving in its direction. This explains the drop in the Ethereum-to-Bitcoin ratio as investors divert their funds towards Bitcoin.\n\nRegarding Ethereum, he stressed the significance of breaking above the $1,745 price level. In terms of Bitcoin, he expects a level of resistance and a minor pullback at around the range highs of $31,500. This point is where bears may challenge the bullish momentum."

        "content": "This week, Bitcoin and other altcoins livened up the crypto market, potentially lifting up Ethereum price and saving it from further collapse.\n\nWith ETH now moving away from the bottom trend line of a massive long-term price pattern, the next possible target is the upper trend line of the same pattern. That target points to $10,000 per Ether, but how long might it take to reach the lofty price objective?\n\nEthereum Rising Wedge Targets $10,000 Or More\n\nFor almost its entire history of price action, ETHUSD has been filling out what appears to be a massive rising wedge pattern. Such patterns are predominantly bearish, breaking down roughly 60% of the time.\n\nThat leaves 40% of the time that these patterns break upward. Descriptions of the pattern reveal that wedges are notoriously prone to false breakouts and/or false breakdowns, where price violates one trend line, only to reverse and target the other.\n\nIn the latest case, however, Ethereum is holding the bottom line. This makes the next logical target the upper trend line, with at least some probability that it can break upward still. The trend line, happens to be located at around $10,000 per ETH currently and rises with each passing day.\n\nWhen ETHUSD touches the upper trend line is still up for question, but considering the length of past rallies lasting anywhere between six months to a year, it may be less of a wait than many expect.\n\nIs $10,000 per ETH next? | ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nIs This The Beginning Or End of ETH?\n\nEver wonder why a rising wedge pattern can break upward if it is a bearish pattern? In Elliott Wave Principle, wedges fall into the diagonal family of patterns. Diagonals can be leading or ending, expanding on contracting.\n\nA leading diagonal kicks off a sustained move. It\u2019s wedge-like appearance is deceiving as traders expect the pattern to break down, yet instead it breaks upward. In contrast, an ending diagonal finishes off a sustained move. In this case, the bearish breakdown that should be expected in a rising wedge plays out.\n\nEthereum is potentially in a massive diagonal pattern, not the rising wedge that it appears. What we also don\u2019t know is if this is the beginning of a larger sustained move and a leading diagonal, or the end of the largest altcoin\u2019s dominance capped off by an ending diagonal.\n\nBoth patterns form in a five-wave pattern. Unlike standard Elliott Wave patterns, diagonals have unique rules. For example, wave 1 must be the longest, wave 4 must enter wave 1 territory, and wave 5 is the shortest of the waves. Since this is the last wave and potentially the shortest of them all, the touch of the upper trend line could be on the way soon.\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "New POL token will facilitate restaking for multi-chain Polygon ecosystem\n\nBy: Samuel Haig \u2022 Loading...\n\nDeFi News\n\nPolygon's new POL token is live on the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nPolygon announced the news on Oct. 25, comprising a major milestone in the project\u2019s ongoing \u201c2.0\u201d overhaul. The roadmap seeks to establish Polygon\u2019s various scaling solutions as an interoperable ecosystem, launch a new staking layer, and unify its PoS Chain and ZkEVM networks.\n\nPOL will power Polygon's upcoming revamped staking layer. The layer will support restaking, allowing stakers to simultaneously perform multiple tasks for different Polygon networks \u2014 including transaction sequencing, proof generation, and committee participation. POL will also comprise the network token for Polygon chains.\n\n\u201cThe launch of POL is a major milestone on the Polygon 2.0 roadmap, but it\u2019s only the beginning,\u201d said Mihailo Bjelic, the co-founder of Polygon. \u201cIt paves the way for a number of upgrades, including launching a new staking layer to power Polygon L2s, upgrading Polygon PoS to zkRollup, and implementing an... interoperability and shared liquidity protocol for all these L2s.\u201d\n\nThe launch follows months of development and a successful testnet deployment. Polygon previously said it aims to enable migrations from its existing MATIC token to POL by the end of the year.\n\nPolygon 2.0\n\nPolygon first unveiled its 2.0 roadmap in June before outlining plans for a governance overhaul in July. The upgrades seek to consolidate and unify Polygon\u2019s various scaling solutions into an interconnected ecosystem secured by a shared staking layer.\n\nPolygon\u2019s ecosystem currently spans its Layer 2 rollup, ZkEVM, its long-standing Ethereum sidechain, PoS Chain, and its Layer 3 architecture, Supernets. Polygon also continues to develop Miden, a ZK-STARK-based L2.\n\nPolygon\u2019s new staking layer will leverage \u201crestaking\u201d to allow validators to secure its various chains using a single token.\n\nRestaking was pioneered with the launch of EigenLayer on Ethereum in June. EigenLayer allows Ethereum stakers to validate third-party services while also securing the Ethereum blockchain to earn additional yields on top of staking rewards. However, the mechanism also comes with increased slashing risks, meaning restakers could be penalized if the services they secure misbehave.\n\nPolygon designed its restaking mechanism to exclusively service chains within its own ecosystem, reducing the threat of slashing penalties.\n\nDeFi Alpha Premium Content DeFi Daily | Weekdays\n\nDeFi Alpha Letter | Weekly\n\nDefiant Podcast Transcript | Weekly\n\nInbox Dump | Saturday\n\nWeekly Recap | Sunday Looking for Alpha?

I've told more than one young financial journalist over the years that clearing is a vital part of financial markets, yet it's generally a dull topic, so it's important when writing about clearing to stress the former to overcome the latter. But it turns out DTCC can spark excitement! BlackRock's proposed ETF showed up on a DTCC webpage, complete with a CUSIP and ticker symbol. Crypto folks thought that was good news, maybe even a sign BlackRock's application had been approved. It definitely didn't mean that, though it's not exactly bad news that BlackRock is completing this prep work, getting a CUSIP and ticker, etc. This possibly misguided optimism likely fueled some, or maybe even most, of Monday's big bitcoin rally. But boring websites giveth and boring websites taketh away. By Tuesday, BlackRock's ETF had vanished from the DTCC site. Bitcoin fell . Later in the day, DTCC revealed something to CoinDesk that meant people probably shouldn\u2019t have gotten so worked up this week: The BlackRock ETF has been on that page since August."

Discover SCENE\n\nNew Polygon, new token.\n\nAs the multi-chain scaling solution continues to roll out its updated roadmap, Polygon today finally deployed the token contracts for its new POL token on Ethereum.\n\nA token contract is a type of smart contract that has the records and utilities powering a token, like its supply and who holds what balance.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPOL will replace the network's current MATIC token; the network will not support two tokens. MATIC holders will have four years to migrate their holdings to the new token.\n\nThe POL token was first announced back in July and is expected to play a critical role in the network's wider upgrade.\n\nOriginally launched as a proof-of-stake network to help Ethereum scale, Polygon has become a sprawling series of different tech solutions, including application-specific blockchains and zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine-based (EVMs) networks.\n\nThe former refers to networks optimized for a specific use case, like gaming or stablecoins, for instance, and may even have their own native cryptocurrency.\n\nThe latter is a broader spectrum scaling solution and joins a host of zk-specific scaling solutions like zkSync Era, Starknet, and Linea.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTo help secure all these networks, the POL token will reportedly let users stake their holdings across as many compatible chains as they wish.\n\nThis means that as soon as they deposit their holdings, they start earning protocol rewards and transaction fees on each staked chain.\n\nIn terms of what's next on the roadmap, Polygon has hinted at moving its PoS chain to a pure-play zkRollup as well as introducing a new interoperability standard for its various chains.\n\nEdited by Stephen Graves"

Those shares, however, have traded at a hefty discount of late as holders aren't able to redeem the underlying. Grayscale aims to fix that by filing to convert the Trust into a full-blown Bitcoin ETF.\n\nThe filing was first rejected by the SEC, but earlier this month a court ruled against the SEC's rejection, and yesterday the Commission was ordered to review the filing once more.\n\nAnother key driver of this recent surge in Bitcoin's value is the appearance of BlackRocks\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust on a list of Nasdaq-traded ETFs, which is maintained by the world\u2019s leading financial clearinghouse, the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC).\n\nJust last week. BlackRock filed an amended prospectus for its spot Bitcoin ETF application, which included detailed explanations on the proposed product\u2019s pricing and reporting mechanism, and the news of the DTCC listing its ticker before the actual trading commenced certainly fuels speculation of the imminent launch.\n\n\u201cRumors are flying since the appearance of BlackRock\u2019s Bitcoin spot ETF ticker on a list at the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC), including that the world\u2019s largest asset manager has already started purchasing Bitcoin for the fund,\" Stefan Rust, CEO of independent inflation data aggregator Truflation said in an emailed statement. \"It could be we are seeing the early signs of the long-awaited 'Crypto Spring.' There is a sense that this U.S. ETF is actually real now\u2014after years and years of waiting.\"\n\nEdited by Liam Kelly.\n\nDisclaimer The views and opinions expressed by the author are for informational purposes only and do not constitute financial, investment, or other advice."

However, the profit booking an impulsive buying in crypto is nothing new.\n\n\n\nBitcoin saw some profit booking after a strong secular rally as the largest crypto token declined over a per cent but managed to hold about 34,000-levels. However, its largest peer, Ethereum, dropped almost 2 per cent but remained below $1,800-level. Majority of the altcoins were trading lower.\n\n\n\nBitcoin's value recently crossed the $35,000 threshold following the sudden appearance of BlackRock's spot bitcoin ETF (IBTC) ticker on the US Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation's website. However, within the last 24 hours, prices settled back around $34,000 after the ticker's temporary disappearance and subsequent reappearance, said Edul Patel,Co-Founder & CEO at Mudrex.\n\n\n\n\"This bullish momentum may also be linked to Grayscale's legal triumph over the US SEC, as the DC Circuit Court of Appeals ordered the agency to reconsider its rejection of Grayscale's spot bitcoin ETF application. These combined factors have fostered optimism among market participants, who are hopeful about the imminent approval of the Bitcoin spot ETF applications,\" he said.\n\n\n\nBarring a few exceptions, the majority of top crypto tokens were trading lower on Wednesday. Dogecoin and Polkadot tumbled over 3 per cent each, while Toncoin, Polygon, Solana and BNB were down 2 per cent each. Among the gainers, Chainlink rallied over 11 per cent, while XRP added about a per cent.\n\n\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market cap was trading significantly lower, falling down to $1.25 trillion-mark, as it declined about a per cent in the last 24 hours. However, the total trading volumes dropped over 13 per cent to $69.61 billion.\n\n\n\nOver the past 24 hours, both Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) have experienced a decline, which could be linked to the temporary removal of BlackRock's (BLK) spot Bitcoin ETF ticker, IBTC, from the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation's (DTCC) website. However, it's important to note that the ticker was relisted after a few hours, said CoinDCX Research Team.\n\n\n\n\"From a technical perspective, both BTC and ETH are trading above the 50-day and 200-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMA-D) and are currently consolidating after their recent upward momentum. While ETH faces a few resistance levels to clear for its uptrend, BTC is showing strength as it reaches a 52-week high,\" he said.\n\n\n\nImage: Crypto-chart-price\n\n\n\nTech View by Giottus Crypto Platform\n\nAptos (APT), trading above its 50-day exponential moving average, is in an ascending trend. The asset has broken above the previous key resistance of $5.5 and is currently experiencing a rally, due to wider positive sentiment in the market. After successfully breaching the upper limit of the flat bottom pattern APT was able to sustain support and has entered the accumulation phase.\n\n\n\nImage: Chart-Aptos\n\n\n\nIt faces immediate resistance at $6.65 with next resistance at $7.61. Its 14-day RSI remains overbought, and is currently around 75. These values suggest that the bullish break may continue in the near term. On the down side, $5.27 is the key support level.\n\nMajor Levels:\n\nSupport: $5.27, $4.68\n\nResistance: $6.65, $7.61\n\n\n\n\n\n(Views and recommendations given in this section are the analysts' own and do not represent those of Business Today.

        "content": "Share:\n\nBitcoin price rallied nearly 15% as it overcame the $30,000 psychological level.\n\nEthereum price has shot up 12% in the last two days, clearing $1,727, a key resistance level.\n\nRipple price has risen above the $0.540 resistance level, but it is uncertain whether bulls will defend this barrier.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price has kick-started a massive rally in the third week of October, dragging Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP) and other altcoins to follow its lead. The rally seems to be driven by a potential spot Bitcoin ETF approval.\n\nRead more: Bitcoin price nears $35,000 after BlackRock\u2019s iShares BTC trust listing on DTTC and Grayscale victory upheld\n\nBitcoin price sustains 2023 bull rally\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price has sustained the 2023 bull rally by producing a fourth higher high. This bullish move has propelled BTC past the $30,000 psychological level, currently trading around $34,152.\n\nThe next hurdle that Bitcoin price will encounter is $36,294, where a potential top might form, especially if the circumstances around the spot ETF approval remain the same. On the other hand, if a spot ETF is officially approved, it could catalyze a massively bullish ascent that could propel BTC to the $40,000 psychological level.\n\nBTC/USD 3-day chart\n\nOn the off chance that this rally is a fluke, Bitcoin price could retrace to the immediate support levels of $31,777 and $30,616. These barriers are key to producing another lower high, but a breakdown of these levels could send BTC down by 15% to $25,941.\n\nIf Bitcoin price produces a three-day or weekly candlestick close below $25,941 support level, it will create a lower low on a higher time frame. This move would put an end to the 2023 bull rally and potentially send BTC down to $19,294.\n\nEthereum price shoots up\n\nEthereum (ETH) price cleared the key hurdle of $1,727 as it rallied 11.48% in the last two days. This move has caused the Relative Strength Index (RSI) to increase above the 50 mean level, showcasing the spike in bullish momentum.\n\nBulls need to sustain above this $1,727 level, after which investors can expect the extension of the uptrend to the next critical level of $2,030.\n\nETH/USD 3-day chart\n\nOn the other hand, if Ethereum price fails to sustain above $1,727, it would denote a bearish outlook. In such a case, investors can expect the bearish trend to take over and trigger a correction to $1,551.\n\nRipple price at crossroads\n\nRipple price has cleared the $0.500 and $0.540 resistance levels after a 12% rally in the last five days. This move has been successful in partially collecting the buy-side liquidity resting above the $0.547 level.\n\nGoing forward, investors need to exercise caution as XRP price is likely to pull back to retest the $0.540 level. Another bounce from here could see the remittance token extend its rally to retest the next key hurdle at $0.668. This move would constitute a 22% upswing.\n\nRead more: Ripple price could kickstart 140% rally to $1.23 after SEC's \u201csurrender\u201d\n\nXRP/USD 3-day chart\n\nOn the other hand, if Ripple price breaks below the $0.540 barrier, it would signal that the bullish momentum is not strong enough. In such a case, XRP price is likely to fall back to find support at the $0.500 and $0.469 levels."

This shows an increasing impact on the broader staking landscape.\n\nSource: ValidatorQueue\n\nThe average wait time (queue) for validators to join the blockchain network is zero minutes, compared to the 45 days and 22 hours validators had to queue in for in early June.\n\nAt press time, the activation and exit limit for validators, known as Churn Limit, has increased from 12 to 13 epochs. This means a daily limit of 2,925 validators can join or exit the Ethereum network.\n\nEthereum Staking Rewards Continues To Plummet\n\nThe dwindling rate of Ethereum\u2019s entry and exit queues for validators is the first for the network since it launched \u201c Shanghai ,\u201d also referred to as Shapella upgrade, in April.\n\nThe upgrade signaled Ethereum\u2019s upcoming transition to an anticipated and fully functional proof-of-stake network (PoS) and propelled the rise of institutional investors depositing large amounts of ETH.\n\nValidators maintain and secure Ethereum\u2019s proof-of-stake blockchain by locking up their Ether. In exchange, they earn staking rewards.\n\nValidators were granted the ability to withdraw their staked ETH for the first time, eliminating risk factors for investors concerned about not getting their funds back. Unfortunately, things have now started to cool off.\n\nAccording to Glassnode\u2019s Ethereum on-chain data metrics , staking rewards have dropped significantly to nearly 3.3% from the previous 7% earlier this year.\n\nDespite the slump in yields, ETH supply increased by $47M last week. Many analysts attributed this increase in supply to the decline in transaction activity in the past few days.\n\nNevertheless, while the demand for staking ETH has dropped, the number of active validators has also increased.\n\nValidator Queues report shows that there are currently 861,938 active validators on the Ethereum network, with 22.79% of the cryptocurrency\u2019s supply staked.\n\nSource: ValidatorQueue"

        "content": "Quick Take\n\nThe evolving dynamics in the cryptocurrency market are clearly reflected in the Ethereum-Bitcoin ratio, which is inching closer to 0.05, a level not seen since mid-2021. Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) position against Bitcoin (BTC) has been in a steady decline. Notably, it was above 0.07 in early 2023, but the persistent momentum has significantly impacted it, leading to a drop to 0.06 in September of that year.\n\nEven as Bitcoin\u2019s dominance surges to 54%, a fascinating trend is the endurance of Ethereum\u2019s dominance against Bitcoin, albeit fast diminishing. Historical data, represented by the pink line, showcases Ethereum\u2019s peak dominance at -0.085, typically seen during bull markets when Ethereum outperforms. However, the tables turn in bear markets, with Bitcoin taking the lead.\n\nAs current trends suggest, we might be on the verge of a market shift with Bitcoin potentially regaining its dominance in terms of market cap."

        "content": "Polygon Labs has launched the Ethereum contract for the new Polygon token, POL, according to an Oct. 25 announcement. The new token is intended to replace the ecosystem\u2019s current token, MATIC (MATIC). However, the team said users presently don\u2019t need to exchange their MATIC for POL.\n\nThe POL token upgrade is now live on Ethereum mainnet.\n\n\n\nPolygon 2.0, released this summer, is a roadmap for scaling Ethereum to build the Value Layer of the Internet. POL unlocks that future.\n\n\n\nPOL is a next-generation token that can power a vast ecosystem of ZK-based L2 chains.\u2026 pic.twitter.com/gmrsu0ZqLz \u2014 Polygon (Labs) (@0xPolygonLabs) October 25, 2023\n\nAccording to blockchain data, the new token was created on Oct. 25 at 9:06 am UTC. Its full name is the \u201cPolygon Ecosystem Token.\u201d In the announcement, the Polygon team claimed that POL would \u201cpower a vast ecosystem of zero knowledge-based Layer 2 chains\u201d by implementing a \u201cre-staking protocol\u201d that allows tokenholders to stake it on multiple chains, performing multiple functions in the process.\n\nThe token\u2019s launch will now pave the way for other aspects of the Polygon 2.0 roadmap to be implemented, including the launch of a new staking layer for the Polygon ecosystem, upgrading the current proof-of-stake (PoS) network to zkEVM layer-2, and creating a shared liquidity protocol for all Polygon networks, the post stated.\n\nRelated: ZK-focused Manta Pacific opts out of OP Stack for Polygon CDK\n\nThe team emphasized that POL is not currently being used for any systems in the Polygon network. Staking on both Polygon PoS and Polygon zkEVM is still being performed via the old token, MATIC, and gas fees on the PoS network are still being paid for with MATIC. So, users, validators,and app developers do not need to exchange their MATIC for POL at present.\n\nPolygon Labs first announced it was developing a new layer-2 ecosystem on June 29. It called the new ecosystem \u201cPolygon 2.0.\u201d On Sept. 14, the team announced that Polygon 2.0 would use a new token, POL. But at the time, the token was just a proposal and had not been deployed to Ethereum.\n\nPolygon\u2019s proposed layer-2 ecosystem will use zero-knowledge proofs to validate transactions between networks. It will face competition from the Optimism ecosystem proposed by Optimism Labs, which will use optimistic rollup technology to secure messages between networks."

        "content": "Table of Contents\n\nDespite the recent downward performance of the broader crypto market, there are cryptocurrencies that are heading in an upward direction. For example, Dogecoin (DOGE) and Ethereum (ETH) recently saw a price increase, and analysts are bullish on their future. Furthermore, the presale-stage project Everlodge (ELDG) can soon reach Stage 6, as investors are accumulating the crypto rapidly.\n\nSummary\n\n\u25cf Dogecoin will rise to $0.098 by the end of Q4\n\n\u25cf Ethereum to spike in value as high as $2,335.71 by the end of 2023\n\n\u25cf Everlodge is projected to grow by 45x at launch\n\nJoin the Everlodge presale and win a luxury holiday to the Maldives\n\nDogecoin (DOGE) Future Outlook\n\nDogecoin (DOGE) is once again getting accumulated by investors on a global scale following its most recent upswing in value. During the previous week, the Dogecoin crypto made the jump from a low point of $0.057 to $0.060\n\nIn addition, the Dogecoin crypto also has a market cap of $8,323,587,328, placing it 10th on the crypto top 100 list. As a result, analysts are now bullish on the future performance of the cryptocurrency. Based on the Dogecoin price prediction, it can rise as high as $0.098 by the end of 2023.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Price Prediction\n\nEthereum (ETH) also showcased significant updates within its ecosystem. Specifically, we saw the launch of the Scroll network. This is a zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual machine (zkEVM) space that can scale the network. Blockchain data from Etherscan indicates that it launched a week ago, but the team made the official announcement on October 17. Existing Ethereum applications and developer tool kits can migrate to the new solution.\n\nAs for the ETH price during the past week, it traded between $1,528.77 and $1,601.75. Based on the Ethereum price prediction made by analysts, it can surge as high as $2,335.71 by the end of 2023.\n\nEverlodge (ELDG) to Spike in Value As High As 45x at Launch\n\nAside from Dogecoin and Ethereum, another crypto that\u2019s getting a lot of attention is Everlodge. It's building the world's first real estate blockchain marketplace. It operates within the hospitality sector and will digitize luxury apartments, hotels, and vacation homes.\n\nThe marketplace will list all of these properties as NFTs. This model will create real-estate-backed NFTs. They will hold all of the ownership details, like the deeds, for example. The prices of the NFTs will move in tandem with the value of the properties.\n\nThrough the usage of NFT fractionalization, Everlodge will operate its unique co-ownership model. This means that they can be divided into smaller fragments, and each represents a share of the property. As a result, anyone can begin making investments with as little as $100.\n\nPortfolio optimization is also important, and on Everlodge, anyone can build a diversified portfolio, as costs are kept as accessible as possible. During Stage 6 of the presale, the ELDG crypto trades at $0.023. At launch, analysts project that it can surge by 45x.\n\nFind out more about the Everlodge (ELDG) Presale\n\nWebsite: https://www.everlodge.io/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/everlodge\n\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored press release and is for informational purposes only.

        "content": "NEW YORK, Oct. 25, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Nocturne , a protocol enabling on-chain private accounts, today announced its $6 million seed funding round co-led by Bain Capital Crypto and Polychain Capital with participation from Vitalik Buterin and other members of the Ethereum community. Other investors include Bankless Ventures, HackVC and Robot Ventures. The company plans to launch on mainnet within the next month.\n\n\n\nBy default, all transactions and user data on Ethereum are completely transparent. Nocturne unveils a pioneering solution that combines the best of stealth addresses, zero-knowledge proofs, and account abstraction to enable private accounts on public blockchains. These accounts seamlessly function like conventional Ethereum accounts but with built-in asset privacy. This initiative marks a first in the Ethereum landscape, representing a stride toward broader accessibility of usable and compliant privacy on-chain.\n\n\u201cNocturne is pushing the boundaries, tackling one of the most foundational problems facing Ethereum,\u201d said Luke Tchang, CEO and co-founder of Nocturne. \u201cOnchain privacy solves a key pain point for many existing users, enables new use cases, and allows new players to enter our industry. Using and integrating privacy into applications will be easier than it\u2019s ever been before.\u201d\n\nThis seed round will accelerate the production and deployment of Nocturne\u2019s protocol across various ecosystems. In addition, the round will help fund legal work as the team continues to navigate and accommodate the changing regulatory environment. The initial launch will provide a usable and compliant non-custodial privacy option to retail users while allowing for integrations with wallets, payment companies, and other strategic partners.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine satiating consumer or institutional demand for permissionless, composable applications without privacy. But it\u2019s also hard to imagine most users adopting new platforms purely for privacy\u2019s sake,\u201d said Alex Evans, Partner at Bain Capital Crypto. \u201cNocturne seeks to close this gap by bringing privacy to existing applications and assets while striving for feature parity as a minimum requirement. We believe that approach is valuable.\u201d\n\nTo learn more about Nocturne, visit https://nocturnelabs.xyz/ .\n\nAbout Nocturne Labs\n\nNocturne Labs is a forward-thinking blockchain technology company committed to addressing the most critical privacy and user experience challenges within the Ethereum ecosystem.

Altcoins has joined the Bitcoin party pushing the entire crypto market up by 7.5% while adding over $150 billion to investors.\n\nEthereum leads the Altcoins Party\n\nAs the Bitcoin price hit its new 2023 high at $23,000, top altcoins like Ethereum (ETH) have gained 8% moving past the $1,8000 level and eyeing the next move to $2,000. With its current move, Ethereum too has extended its year-to-date gains to more than 50%.\n\nadvertisement\n\nAnother interesting development is that the US SEC has acknowledged Grayscale\u2019s application of converting its Ethereum Trust (ETHE) into a spot Ethereum ETF.\n\nAs per the technical chart, the Ethereum price has given a breakout above the $1,745 level after making a double bottom formation. Other technical indicators also hint at the continuation of the rally going ahead.\n\nIf traders maintain their open buy orders, they may propel a potential 12.25% breakout to reach $1,958. Once the breakout occurs, an accompanying surge in trading volume is likely, as traders look for fresh opportunities with Ether above the neckline resistance.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently at 75 signals that Ethereum\u2019s price is positioned to uphold the uptrend. However, investors need to warrant caution as overbought conditions could tempt traders to take profits or protect their investments.\n\nAs indicated by the money flow index (MFI), the advantage lies with the bulls. This metric monitors the flow of money in and out of the market, with a consistent increase indicating buyer dominance in the uptrend.\n\nSurpassing the $2,000 mark could prove to be a significant turning point for Ethereum bulls. It will potentially act as the catalyst initiating the next bull run.\n\nCardano (ADA) and Dogecoin (DOGE) aka Big Moves\n\nAmong the list of top ten cryptocurrencies, Dogecoin and Cardano have followed a similar trajectory to Ethereum, with both gaining 8% each. BNB Coin and Ripple XRP have gained 4% each.\n\nOn the other hand, Solana \u2013 which has been the star performer \u2013 remains flattish and seems to be entering consolidation after registering 30% weekly gains."

This equated to approximately $71 million in value and has been accumulated over the past three days.\n\nAccording to Etherescan\u2019s data, one of these whales obtained more than 20,000 ETH. It acquired 17,000 ETH through a decentralized exchange (DEX) and withdrew an additional 3,000 ETH from a centralized exchange.\n\nIn addition, another whale withdrew over 10,000 ETH from Binance [BNB], subsequently depositing these funds and taking a long position on the asset within several DeFi platforms.\n\nThese strategic moves made by these whales coincide with the positive uptrend in the price of ETH that has been observed over the last couple of days.\n\nEthereum sees a continued uptrend\n\nEthereum\u2019s recent price surge has been in progress for nearly seven consecutive days, bringing good news to its investors. At the time of writing, it was trading at approximately $1,800, reflecting a price increase of over 3%.\n\nThis uptick built upon the already impressive 6% uptrend observed on 24 October. Notably, this ongoing surge has propelled Ethereum into a strongly bullish territory.\n\nAs of the latest data, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has indicated that ETH has entered the overbought zone. This suggested a bullish trend, though it may also hint at the potential for a price correction in the near future.\n\nAdditionally, the continued accumulation of ETH by the whales in the market may be viewed as a sign of a sustained upward trajectory.\n\nFunding rates reflect whales\u2019 optimism\n\nCoinciding with the rise in Ethereum\u2019s price and the accumulation by whales, the Funding Rate for ETH has surged in a positive direction. At the time of this report, the Funding Rate per Coinglass had elevated to approximately 0.02%.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ETHs worth today?\n\nNotably, this surge in funding rate is a noteworthy occurrence as it hasn\u2019t been observed in over two months, signifying a sudden increase in optimism among market participants.\n\nThe press time Funding rates strongly suggested that traders were anticipating a further price increase in Ethereum, given their willingness to pay a premium for holding long positions."

        "content": "According to Etherscan.io, an Ethereum (ETH) whale has moved 30,710 ETH, worth around $54.9 million, to the crypto exchange Binance. The whale had recently withdrawn 42,311 ETH from Binance, leading many to speculate if it made a profit on the 30,710 ETH and hence is moving to sell them, leaving it with 11,601ETH.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum (ETH) Price Prediction: October End 2023\n\nThe whale began withdrawing its Ethereum (ETH) on Sept. 20. The total withdrawn amount has come to over $75.67 million, with an average price per ETH of around $1,667. The whale might have sent its holdings to Binance to realize profits as ETH closes in on $1.8k.\n\nThe large transfer to Binance could spell trouble for ETH investors. The transfer of tokens to an exchange increases the chances of them being sold, which could bring down the asset\u2019s price. ETH has surged by over 14% in the weekly charts. However, the altcoin is down by 1.1% in the last 24 hours.\n\nWill Ethereum\u2019s price take a hit if the whale sells its holdings?\n\nSource: Investopedia\n\nAny sale of such a magnitude will likely impact ETH price. However, Bitcoin (BTC) is currently leading the markets, and a sell-off of ETH will most likely not make a dent in the larger crypto market. Moreover, recently investors with over $1 billion worth of ETH took control of 32% of the token\u2019s current supply. If some of these billionaires decide to sell, it may have dire consequences for the project.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum Billionaires Now Hold 32% of Supply\n\nAs long as BTC continues to rally, ETH may enjoy a similar pattern. Moreover, several bullish developments for BTC could sustain its rally, including a spot BTC ETF (Exchange-Traded Fund) approval in the U.S. and BTC\u2019s next halving cycle. Both of these events could spark a new bull run for the crypto market."

        "title": "Total Value Locked (TVL) in Cryptocurrency: Everything You Need to Know - Investopedia",
        "content": "What Is Total Value Locked (TVL)?\n\nTotal value locked (TVL) is a metric used in the cryptocurrency sector to determine the total U.S. dollar value of digital assets locked, or staked, on a particular blockchain network via decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms or decentralized applications (dApps). The higher the TVL of a project, the more secure and valuable it is perceived to be.\n\nKey Takeaways Total value locked (TVL) measures the U.S. dollar value of assets locked on a blockchain.\n\nIt is an important indicator of investor and developer interest in a blockchain or decentralized application (dApp).\n\nTVL is similar to bank deposits for decentralized finance (DeFi) projects.\n\nHow Total Value Locked (TVL) Works\n\nCryptocurrency arrived in 2009 with the creation of Bitcoin, which was designed to be a peer-to-peer currency using digital ledger technology that would operate outside of centralized control. Early projects focused on being a replacement currency for the financial system until the arrival of Ethereum in 2015, which has smart contract functionality and allowed developers to build permanent dApps on its network.\n\nThat led to a DeFi boom in 2020\u20132022, with a host of dApps offering digital financial services, such as lending, which don\u2019t rely on traditional financial intermediaries like brokerages, exchanges, or banks.\n\nTo get access to a loan, for example, users must stake digital assets or tokens with the application in the same way that a mortgage borrower would place a down payment with a lender. In cryptocurrency, this staked deposit is \u201clocked\u201d on that particular network, or still in circulation but not usable while it is staked.\n\nThis led to the creation of the term \u201ctotal value locked,\u201d which can give users a snapshot of the importance of an application or network based on the value of staked assets locked on its chain.\n\n\n\nHow Total Value Locked (TVL) Is Calculated\n\nThe total value locked on a chain is calculated by summing the total value of digital assets locked on a specific DeFi platform or dApp. Digital assets are cryptocurrencies or stablecoins that are being used as collateral for loans or to add liquidity to a platform.\n\n\n\nDeFi platforms can potentially provide their own data for investors to calculate their TVL. For example, if a DeFi platform said it had $1 billion worth of ether, $1 billion worth of bitcoin, and $500 million of tether locked, that would mean it has $2.5 billion of digital assets in TVL.\n\nThe largest cryptocurrencies and stablecoins by market capitalization usually will account for the majority of TVL, as these are the most trusted assets. Bitcoin, ether, and tether are the most common.\n\nInvestors tend to use third-party DeFi analytics platforms, such as DefiLlama, for the numbers. These platforms will use application programming interfaces (APIs) and other computing technologies to gather data from crypto applications; users can simply search the site for their desired information.\n\nFor example, DefiLlama said Aave had $5.4 billion total value locked on Oct. 24, 2023. Looking at the breakdown of those total assets, Ethereum was listed as the largest, at about $4.6 billion. The Polygon and Avalanche blockchains are the next two largest, at about $287 million and $193 million, respectively.\n\nWhat Total Value Locked (TVL) Can Tell Investors\n\nTVL became a critical metric in cryptocurrency because it gave investors a measuring stick to help define the risks and potential benefits of investing in a particular DeFi platform. If a platform has a large amount of assets locked on its network, then it gives the impression that it is a secure platform, trusted by crypto investors.\n\nThis is similar to traditional banks, where investors analyze the level of deposits held by an institution. If a bank is attracting deposits, it can earn money by lending or investing that money. If deposits are declining, then the opposite is true\u2014the bank can\u2019t lend as much, leading to less income.\n\nThe DeFi boom from 2020 to 2022 happened because the finance platforms used their decentralized nature to offer large annual percentage rate (APR) interest rate yields for staking and lending. This also happened at a time when global central banks were pursuing a collective monetary policy that relied on interest rates near zero to spur growth.\n\nA platform with a high TVL level may not necessarily be a secure platform. Investors interested in DeFi projects should dig deeper to gauge the project\u2019s reputation.\n\nAt a peak in December 2021, decentralized applications had a TVL of more than $179 billion. Over the following months, a peak in technology stocks reduced investors\u2019 appetite for risk, and speculative capital was drawn from the crypto sector. The central banks also went on an aggressive interest-rate-tightening cycle to combat inflation, and investors moved to the safety of government deposits. On Oct. 24, 2023, the TVL for the crypto sector was around $40 billion.\n\n\n\nDrawbacks of Total Value Locked (TVL)\n\nTVL will only provide a snapshot of the total value of assets that are locked, or staked, in a platform; it doesn\u2019t highlight activity levels. If a platform has a high TVL but low user-activity levels, this may mean that a small number of investors account for the TVL on that platform\u2014generally, this is a red flag and would require more investigation. Investors should also look at the data practices of third-party analytics platforms to ensure that all the TVL figures are up to date.\n\nThe DeFi industry isn\u2019t immune to the collapse of trusted institutions, as was evident with the $60 billion collapse of the Terra (LUNA) lending protocol in 2022. This highlighted another problem with TVL: The assets involved in the calculation may not be as secure as believed.\n\nThere also have been cases in which TVL numbers can be artificially inflated by bad actors who want to attract attention to their platform or project.\n\nThat can make it harder for users to accurately gauge the true value of a project, but shouldn\u2019t be a problem when assessing DeFi projects or dApps with a strong reputation.\n\nTVL is a handy metric for assessing the quality of a decentralized finance project or application, but it shouldn\u2019t be the only measure used for an investment. Investors can perform due diligence in other areas, such as the experience of the founders, the platform\u2019s governance model, tokenomics, or the size of the platform\u2019s community.\n\n\n\nWhat Is the Difference Between TVL and Market Capitalization? The difference between TVL and market capitalization is that the former calculates the value of digital assets parked on an application, while the latter is the market value of the project that develops and operates the DeFi platform or dApp.\n\nWhich Cryptocurrency Has the Highest TVL? On Oct. 24, 2023, Ethereum had the highest TVL. There was $22.32 billion in ether locked, according to DefiLlama.\n\nIs Total Value Locked a Good Metric? Crypto fans use TVL to gauge interest in a cryptocurrency app or platform. For this purpose, it is a good metric, but it should also be used with other metrics in an analysis.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nTotal value locked (TVL) is an important metric used in the cryptocurrency sector that allows investors to gauge the popularity and activity of a decentralized finance platform or application.\n\nLending platforms will aim to attract investors by offering an attractive APR yield, and any digital assets locked on the network to earn that yield will boost the network\u2019s TVL figure. Locking is generally done by staking tokens on a blockchain, which also serves to give the token staker the ability to earn fees by validating transactions."

Some members of the mining communities who cannot profit from Ethereum\u2019s new protocol support EthereumPoW.\n\nThe native token of the blockchain, ETHW, can be used to buy products and services from decentralised applications (dApps) created on the platform. The token is also useful to cover network transaction costs and receive rewards for mining to secure the protocol.\n\nInfo On Project\n\nEthereum switched from a so-called proof-of-work system to a proof-of-stake mechanism to conserve energy and secure the network. However, a section of the blockchain\u2019s legacy computing operations declined to take part in the software update known as the Merge.\n\nA team of miners led by Chandler Guo opposed Ethereum\u2019s transition to a more energy-efficient network security method, claiming that Ethereum 2.0 will make crypto miners obsolete. Guo is a seasoned Ether miner and major supporter of Ethereum Classic, another PoW fork of Ethereum.\n\nHolders of ETHPoW are certain that the coin and its ecosystem will stay out of any legal trouble the new Ethereum will encounter. According to Gary Gensler of the SEC, the staking features of the latest version of Ethereum could qualify it as a security under the Howey Test.\n\nFor now, only a few exchanges support ETHW, the native token for the EthereumPoW network. On these exchanges, individuals can trade, and the token is offered for spot trading on platforms like FTX, ByBit, Kraken, and BitMart.\n\nAlong with the mainnet launch, the EthereumPoW team sent an update advising users of some adjustments and updates. There have been more than 1.7 billion transactions since the launch. Also, the total number of addresses holding ETHW now stands at about 254 million.\n\nUse Cases\n\nMany projects have declared support for the EthereumPOW network since its introduction. Uniswap V3, MetaMask, DefiEdge, other decentralised wallets, decentralised exchanges, and other Web3 systems are some of these projects.\n\n.\n\nMining pools that had previously mined on other networks when Ethereum transitioned to a proof-of-stake algorithm have now started mining ETHW. With the mining pool accounting for 41.7% of the known hash rate, F2pool and others have begun directing resources toward the token.\n\nHow Does EthereumPoW Work?\n\nA few hours after Ethereum successfully migrated to the PoS consensus method algorithm, anonymous developers forked the Eth blockchain and introduced the EthereumPoW token. It utilises the Proof-of-Work mechanism (mining) and functions similarly to how Ethereum did previously.\n\nThe underlying algorithm used by proof-of-work blockchains determines mining operations\u2019 rules and difficulty level. The \u201cwork\u201d itself is mining. It involves adding legitimate blocks to the chain. Computers must solve cryptographic puzzles as proof of work to be compensated with the capacity to validate blockchain transactions. It\u2019s similar to competition and is known as bitcoin mining. It operates on the concept that one can fend off a malicious attack and confirm the authenticity of a transaction by using a lengthy string of letters and numbers, known as hashes.\n\nThe proof-of-work algorithm that Ethereum\u2019s mainnet has used since its creation will be maintained in ETHPoW. Although the scheduled difficulty bomb was intended to make it impossible to mine on the PoW chain, ETHPoW has continued to be mined by mining pools.\n\nThe ETHPoW fork, which has a similar transaction background as the main Ethereum network, will begin producing its blocks upon activation of the Merge upgrade. The pre-Merge state of the Ethereum network acts as the initiation point for the PoW merge, meaning all token smart contracts and balances will also be brought over.\n\nTherefore, everyone who now has ETH on-chain will end up with an identical amount of ETHW on the ETHPoW chain. Only the PoW fork will have native ETHW, a completely distinct asset from the original Ethereum token (ETH).\n\nWith ETHW originally forking the Ethereum blockchain, the chain would start with the same circulating supply as proof-of-stake Ethereum. The currency supply of the two chains would diverge, though, because the post-Merge Ethereum will have a considerably lower inflation rate than its current PoW version. As a result, the supply of EthereumPoW will increase more quickly than Ethereum on PoS if mining continues.\n\nIs ETHW a Good Investment?\n\nThe creation of ETHW by the community ensured that miners could continue to operate and prevent it from becoming outdated. Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin claimed that those promoting the hard fork are only \u201ctrying to make a quick buck.\u201d However, some notable personalities in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, like Justin Sun and Chandler Guo, have expressed support for the fork chain.\n\nBefore making an ETHW investment, keep the following in mind:\n\nSpeculative Value: Reputable crypto projects have backed the new PoS chain and the Ethereum Foundation. While ETHW is not yet widely accepted like the classic Ethereum, several projects already support the chain, which could lead to more value increases.\n\nReputable crypto projects have backed the new PoS chain and the Ethereum Foundation.

Volatility: Ethereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization; this liquidity promotes a stable market. The market value and trading volume of ETHW are much lower. Any coin with a low trading volume is vulnerable to manipulating the market and experiencing higher volatility.\n\nEthereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization; this liquidity promotes a stable market. The market value and trading volume of ETHW are much lower. Any coin with a low trading volume is vulnerable to manipulating the market and experiencing higher volatility. Exchange Listings: Digital assets are listed on exchanges according to their demand and security. If coins and tokens are regarded as secure and make money from heavy trade, they are more likely to stay listed. However, the exchange may delist the asset if the trading activity falls below a necessary profit margin. However, ETHW is currently tradable on several crypto exchanges, including Kraken, FTX, Poloniex, Gate.io, MEXC, Huobi, etc. This shows there is a growing demand for the digital asset.\n\nHow to Buy EthereumPOW on Kraken\n\nInvestors\u2019 interest in buying EthereumPOW will continue to rise as more people understand how it works. Buying ETHW is straightforward and can be completed with these few steps:\n\nRegister an Account\n\nFirst, users should visit the Kraken site, click \u201cCreate Account,\u201d and register by providing a username, email address, and password. Next, click on the verification email sent as part of the registration process.\n\nVerify\n\nOnce users have signed up, they must go through account verification in adherence to the platform\u2019s KYC requirements. For example, to get \u201cStarter Level\u201d verification status, a trader will need to provide a name, email address, physical address, and phone number.\n\nThe \u201cStarter\u201d verification procedure is automated and normally takes less than one hour.\n\nOnce traders are verified, they can access the overview section of their trading dashboard to click on \u201cBuy\u201d to make their first crypto purchase. First, however, they will have to fund their account before they can buy any digital asset.\n\nDeposit Funds\n\nTraders can fund their Kraken account using a credit or debit card, bank account, and cryptos.\n\nThe navigation bar lets traders move between features on the Kraken account dashboard. Traders must click \u201cfunding\u201d to make a deposit into their account and select their preferred payment method.\n\nBuy ETHW\n\nCustomers should return to the website and place their first order after receiving notification from Kraken that their cash has arrived. Select \u201cTrade\u201d then click \u201cNew Order\u201d from the menu. Users can create customised orders by choosing \u201cSimple\u201d or \u201cAdvanced.\u201d\n\nOnly two input fields are available for users if they select the \u201cSimple\u201d option: volume and Amount. Purchasing cryptocurrency at market value is the simplest method. Enter the desired amount for buying the \u201cETHW/USD\u201d pair. An estimate of the total cost of the order is shown on the right side of the page.\n\nEthereumPOW FAQs\n\nWill Coinbase support ETHW?\n\nETHW is not supported by Coinbase right now. However, the crypto exchange stated that following The Merge, if an ETH PoW fork occurs, this asset will be reviewed with the same scrutiny as any other asset listed on their exchange. Therefore, there might still be future support for the digital asset.\n\nWhat is Ethereum PoW?\n\nEthereumPoW is a clone of the proof-of-work (PoW) blockchain used by the Ethereum network before switching to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus algorithm. The mining communities that cannot profit from Ethereum\u2019s new protocol support EthereumPoW because it preserves the functionality of the Ethereum network before its switch to PoS.\n\nCan you mine proof-of-stake?\n\nProof of stake cannot be mined. For proof of stake, validators are chosen at random to verify blocks of information and confirm transactions. Instead of employing a competitive rewards-based approach like proof-of-work, this system randomly selects who is eligible to receive fees. Proof-of-stake blockchains enable networks to run with significantly reduced resource consumption since they do not require miners to expend electricity on redundant processes (competing to solve the same puzzle).\n\nWhich coins use proof-of-stake?\n\nProof-of-stake (PoS) is a consensus mechanism for blockchain networks, and some coins that use this mechanism include Ethereum (ETH), Cardano (ADA), Solana (SOL), Tezos (XTZ), Algorand (ALGO), etc."

        "content": "Ethereum gas fees hit a historic low at 8.8 Gwei on October 8, 2023, creating significant interest within the cryptocurrency community.\n\nReduced engagement in decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), layer-2 networks, and Telegram bots played a crucial role in driving down Ethereum\u2019s gas fees.\n\nThe drop in Ethereum gas fees led to a shift from a deflationary to an inflationary state for Ethereum in September, influencing the overall supply of the cryptocurrency.\n\nOn October 8, 2023, the cryptocurrency community witnessed a remarkable event as Ethereum\u2019s average gas fees dropped to a low of 8.8 Gwei. This marked a historic moment, as gas fees hadn\u2019t reached such levels since October 2, 2022.\n\nClaim up to $30,030 in Bonus 100x Leverage Start Trading\n\nThe decline in Ethereum\u2019s gas fees generated intense interest and debate throughout the blockchain ecosystem. Gas fees on the Ethereum network are measured in Gwei, which is a unit equivalent to 10^9 Wei \u2013 the smallest denomination of Ethereum (ETH).\n\nSeveral factors contributed to the unprecedented drop in Ethereum\u2019s gas fees. For instance, major players on the Ethereum network, such as Uniswap, 1inch, and MetaMask, added to the reduced gas fees. These Ethereum networks had a double-digit decrease in their gas consumption within a single week.\n\nThis shows a changing landscape in Ethereum as these entities adjusted their strategies in response to market conditions. Top gas spenders, including exchanges like Binance and Coinbase, as well as layer-2 networks, spent 30% less compared to the previous week.\n\nCurrently, FTX proposes customer fund return plan, potentially returning up to 90% of funds. Read here.\n\nClaim up to $30,030 in Bonus 100x Leverage Start Trading\n\nThis marked a notable change, especially for low-fee layer-2 networks, which had seen consistent growth over the past year. These changes demonstrate the adaptability of the Ethereum ecosystem in response to evolving market dynamics.\n\nAnother key contributor was the decreased engagement in decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), layer-2 networks, and even Telegram bots. NFTs experienced a substantial dip in their weekly trading volumes.\n\nNFT trading volumes dropped to levels not seen in two years. This shift is indicative of evolving trends and priorities within the cryptocurrency space. Telegram bots, which enjoyed a surge in popularity in the second quarter of the year, also witnessed a decline in activity as October began.\n\nEthereum Turns Inflationary Due to Reduced Gas Fees\n\nThe decrease in Ethereum gas fees had a big impact beyond just the cost of transactions. In September, Ethereum went from being in a deflationary state to an inflationary one, and this was mainly due to the lower gas fees.\n\nAdditionally, ETH experienced its lowest rate of \u201cburn,\u201d where only 7,084 ETH was used up, which was quite different from earlier times.\n\nEnhance Your Crypto Trading Skills With Our Legends\u2019 Trading Masterclass\n\nEmpower your crypto trading skills with our Legends Masterclass.

Join the class today.\n\nBecause of these changes, the supply of Ethereum started increasing at a daily rate of about 1,450 ETH, which is roughly equivalent to $2.2 million worth of Ethereum.\n\nThis shift in how Ethereum\u2019s supply works resulted in an annual inflation rate of 0.44%. This gives some insight into what it means for Ethereum to move towards an inflationary model and how sustainable it might be in the long run."

        "title": "Can Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP) and Cardano (ADA) Reach New Yearly Highs After Exploding In The Last 5 days ... - CryptoDaily",
        "content": "Table of Contents\n\nThe cryptocurrency market has been experiencing a whirlwind of activity lately. Following a fiery trading session, US crypto stocks saw a slight dip in their earlier gains. Bitcoin, the primary catalyst for these stock surges, experienced a dip from its $35,000 peak to around $33,800. Mining companies, despite the fluctuations in Bitcoin's price, managed to stay in the green. Amidst the market's ups and downs, Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), and Cardano (ADA) maintain their presence, each contributing to the market's complex dynamics. The market's current dynamics suggest that while there are bullish tendencies, caution is advised due to potential volatility. In this vibrant scenario, ScapesMania (MANIA) is emerging as a notable force, adding a layer of excitement and anticipation among traders and market watchers alike.\n\nThroughout 2023, ScapesMania (MANIA) has been rising at an even more impressive rate than Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), and Cardano (ADA), raising the question of whether traders should even try and hold these coins, hoping for them to potentially reach new yearly highs, someday. Let's examine the current indicators!\n\nScapesMania: Rising Phenomenon\n\nMany crypto experts pick ScapesMania as the best new project of 2023 and beyond. It manages to separate itself from the competition by offering holders a multitude of revenue streams and high potential ROIs during presale.\n\nCompanies and individual crypto traders looking for fast potential gains should definitely look into ScapesMania's proposition. Once the presale finishes, the price will soar, securing possible returns in the range of 400-500%. Right now, there's an active discount of close to 85%, but it won't last forever - the clock is ticking and all interested in leveraging this offer need to act fast.\n\nWhen dissecting the tokenomics and other features of ScapesMania, it becomes clear that it's the best altcoin to hold now. The innovative gaming-related core idea, impressive presale numbers, $150,000 giveaway, undying social media hype, and other positive aspects can guarantee that ScapesMania will continue on its winning journey, so it makes sense to get involved as soon as possible.\n\n>>> Join Presale at a Discount on the Official Site <<<\n\nEthereum (ETH): Challenges and Potential\n\nEthereum (ETH) recently marked a significant milestone with over 100 million addresses holding at least a minimal amount of Ethereum (ETH). This growth is attributed to increased accumulation by market players since mid-October. However, despite this achievement, on-chain data suggests that new entrants aren't flocking to the Ethereum (ETH) network as expected. This indicates that the surge in addresses might be due to previous holders returning, rather than fresh adoption.\n\nEthereum (ETH) price has been fluctuating within the range of $1,570 to $1,732. Despite a 6.93% growth in the past week, Ethereum (ETH) performance has been lackluster compared to other leading cryptocurrencies. Technical indicators show that Ethereum (ETH) has faced resistance levels at $1,794 and $1,955, making it challenging for the cryptocurrency to break out. On the flip side, support levels are identified at $1,308 and $1,470, suggesting that Ethereum might find some stability around these price points.\n\nGiven Ethereum (ETH) current market dynamics, there's potential for further price corrections. While Ethereum (ETH) has been at the forefront of the decentralized finance (DeFi) movement and has pioneered smart contracts, it faces several challenges. Network congestion and high transaction fees have been persistent issues, causing users to seek alternatives. These challenges have raised concerns about Ethereum (ETH) long-term viability, especially with emerging competitors in the space.\n\nRipple (XRP): Celebrations and Cautions\n\nRipple (XRP) has been in the spotlight due to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) unexpectedly dismissing its charges against Ripple (XRP) executives. This decision led to a temporary surge in Ripple (XRP) price by over 8%. However, the celebration might be short-lived, as legal experts speculate that the SEC's move could be a strategy to expedite an appeal.\n\nRipple (XRP) underlying technology offers faster and more affordable cross-border transactions, making it appealing to financial institutions. However, regulatory challenges and the ongoing legal battle with the SEC have cast a shadow over its prospects.\n\nRipple (XRP) price has seen fluctuations within the range of $0.466 to $0.556. Following the SEC's decision, there was an 8% surge in its price. However, the broader market sentiment remains cautious. The 10-Day Moving Average for Ripple (XRP) stands at $0.521, with the 100-Day Moving Average at $0.562. These averages, combined with resistance levels at $0.597 and $0.688, suggest that Ripple (XRP) might face challenges in achieving significant price gains in the near term.\n\nWhile the recent legal victory has provided some respite for Ripple (XRP), the future remains uncertain. The SEC's decision to dismiss charges might be a double-edged sword, with potential implications for Ripple (XRP) long-term legal standing. Additionally, Ripple (XRP) adoption by financial institutions could be hampered by regulatory uncertainties. Investors should remain vigilant and consider the potential risks associated with Ripple (XRP), given the unpredictable legal and regulatory landscape.\n\nCardano (ADA): Restructuring on the Horizon?\n\nCardano (ADA) has been in the spotlight due to concerns about potential restructuring. There are indications that Cardano (ADA) might need to undergo urgent restructuring under certain circumstances. While the specifics of these circumstances are not detailed here, it's evident that the Cardano (ADA) community and investors are closely monitoring the situation.\n\nCurrently, Cardano (ADA) price is oscillating between $0.240 and $0.263. The 10-Day Moving Average stands at $0.260, slightly below the 100-Day Moving Average of $0.269. This suggests that Cardano (ADA) is experiencing a period of consolidation, with the price struggling to break out of its current range. Technical analysis indicates that Cardano (ADA) has established support levels at $0.205 and $0.227. On the upside, resistance levels are set at $0.272 and $0.294. These levels provide insights into potential price movements and can be crucial for traders and investors to watch.\n\nCardano (ADA) future seems to be at a crossroads. While the project has a strong foundation and a dedicated community, external factors and internal challenges could influence its trajectory. The potential need for restructuring adds another layer of uncertainty to Cardano (ADA) outlook. Investors and stakeholders should remain vigilant, keeping an eye on developments and making informed decisions based on comprehensive research and analysis.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe cryptocurrency market remains a dynamic and ever-evolving landscape. While established players like Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP) and Cardano (ADA) navigate through challenges, newer entrants like ScapesMania (MANIA) are making their mark.\n\nRight now, the ScapesMania can easily eclipse all the other coins mentioned in the article due to the fact that it offers steady growth, pre-sale bonuses of different kinds, multi-level discounts, and so, so much more!\n\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nPolygon Labs has taken a huge step toward realizing Polygon 2.0. The scaling technology firm has successfully launched smart contracts of the project\u2019s next-generation token, POL, on Ethereum.\n\nThe Polygon 2.0 roadmap entails a token switch from MATIC to POL.\n\nPOL Token Contracts Debut On Ethereum\n\nPolygon Labs revealed in an October 25 press release that the POL token has gone live on the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nCrucially, POL is an upgrade from the MATIC token, which will be deprecated as part of the move. MATIC token holders will have roughly four years to transfer their holdings to the new token.\n\n\u201cToday marks a major milestone on the Polygon 2.0 journey toward building the Value Layer of the Internet. The upgrade to POL has been initiated on the Ethereum mainnet, after months of development, community consultation, and a successful testnet launch,\u201d Polygon Labs stated in the official announcement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPolygon Labs first announced POL in July 2023, and it expects it to work as a multipurpose token and play a key role in the network\u2019s broader 2.0 upgrade.\n\nIn September, Polygon released three inaugural Polygon Improvement Proposals (PIPs) for community consideration and voting. The PIPs outline technical details for \u201cPhase 0, which includes a proposal for the transition and specifications that will see MATIC become POL.\n\nThe Polygon 2.0 vision paints a picture of multiple Polygon-based chains, bridges, and the implementation of privacy-enhancing zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs to validate all transfers. POL, a next-generation hyperproductive token, will power all Polygon-based networks: the main Polygon blockchain, the Polygon zkEVM network, and various supernets.\n\nTo help secure all these layers, POL will reportedly allow users to stake their holdings across as many compatible chains as they want. This suggests that users start accruing protocol rewards and transaction fees on each staked chain as soon as they deposit their holdings.\n\nIt\u2019s worth mentioning that the POL token will not immediately replace MATIC despite the deployment on the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nIs MATIC Set For Major Surge?\n\nIn terms of what comes next on the Polgyon 2.0 roadmap, Polygon has hinted at transitioning its proof-of-stake chain to a zkRollup as well as implementing a new ZK-powered interoperability and shared liquidity protocol for its multiple chains.\n\nIt is my pleasure to report that POL contracts are live on Ethereum mainnet! \ud83e\udd29\ud83d\udcab\n\n\n\nThe launch of POL is a major milestone on the Polygon 2.0 roadmap, but it\u2019s only the beginning. It paves the way for a number of upgrades, including launching a new staking layer to power Polygon\u2026 pic.twitter.com/9qdY6Bv5Lp \u2014 Mihailo Bjelic (@MihailoBjelic) October 25, 2023\n\nThe price of MATIC gained 25.3% in the last week, indicating investors are ready to snap up tokens with positive fundamental developments that promise increased use cases. The token is up 2.8% on the day, currently trading hands at $0.6456, according to CoinGecko data.\n\nMATIC is still down 77.92% from its December all-time high of $2.92, although the team has been consistently delivering the necessary updates and improvements to the Polygon network. It\u2019s worth noting that mainnet and protocol updates tend to cause bullish price action.\n\nInvestors will be closely monitoring the progress of the Polygon 2.0 roadmap following the launch of POL."

However, over the past 24 hours, prices settled at the $34,000 range as the ticker disappeared and then reappeared. This bullish upturn may also be attributed to Grayscale's legal victory against the US SEC after the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals ordered the SEC to reconsider its prior rejection of Grayscale's spot bitcoin ETF application. These developments have raised optimism among market participants, fueling expectations of an impending approval for Bitcoin spot ETF applications. Meanwhile, Ethereum has continued to trade above the $1,700 level.\u201d\n\nRajagopal Menon, Vice President, WazirX, said, \u201cBitcoin\u2019s breakaway from consolidation has been phenomenal with prices increasing to the levels of last year April. The increase in fund inflows and the short squeeze on the network last week added to the surge. The SEC\u2019s softening stance towards Crypto ETFs as per prominent institutional investors, has also ignited hopes of an early bull market which might be too soon to predict. Bitcoin\u2019s market dominance was prominent as key tokens such as Ether, Solana, etc. increased in price following BTC\u2019s price rally.\u201d\n\nSathvik Vishwanath, CEO and co-founder of Unocoin, said, \u201cBitcoin's meteoric 10 percent rise this week to an all-time high of $35,900 has had a ripple effect on related stocks. MicroStrategy, known for its sizable bitcoin holdings, saw its shares rise a remarkable 12 percent, bringing unrealized bitcoin gains close to $1 billion. Coinbase shares rose 7.33 percent, reflecting the cryptocurrency's success. Bitcoin mining companies Riot Blockchain and Marathon Digital Holdings surged more than 10 percent and 12 percent, respectively, beating Bitcoin in both daily and year-to-date gains. Companies like Cipher Mining, Riot Platforms, and Bitfarms have exceeded 100 percent growth this year. This increase can be attributed to a variety of factors, including anticipation of a bitcoin halving event in 2024 and a legal ruling in favour of Grayscale's application for a bitcoin ETF, which was previously rejected by the SEC. This decision, reiterating the approval of the Bitcoin futures ETF, underscores the continued importance of Bitcoin in the financial landscape.\u201d\n\nCoinDCX Research Team told ABP Live, \u201cOver the past 24 hours, both BTC and ETH have experienced approximately a 2 percent decline. This dip could be linked to the temporary removal of BlackRock's (BLK) spot Bitcoin ETF ticker, IBTC, from the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation's (DTCC) website. However, it's important to note that the ticker was relisted after a few hours. The presence of the ticker on the DTCC site had led investors to speculate about the imminent approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF, which contributed to BTC's significant surge from the $30,000 range to over $35,000.\u201d\n\nSubscribe And Follow ABP Live On Telegram: t.me/officialabplive\n\nDisclaimer: Crypto products and NFTs are unregulated and can be highly risky.

As cryptocurrencies continue to gain popularity, more and more individuals are trying to join the action. While news and articles explain the basics of crypto, how it works, and market trends, they may not provide the valuable insights needed to truly understand the industry.

Here, we\u2019re sharing some of the most notable websites and blogs that deliver updated information on all things blockchain and crypto, from updates to current issues.\n\nConsidered one of the oldest and most established sources of news on Bitcoin and blockchain technology, Bitcoin Magazine has been providing a global audience with analysis, research, and valuable crypto- and Bitcoin-related resources. It has established itself as a hub where thought leaders gather to share timely and relevant material on the crypto industry.\n\nOne of the great things about the website, aside from offering the latest news and updates, is that it lets you purchase Bitcoins, thanks to its partnership with Simplex. It also provides you with an avenue to earn Bitcoins via Carrot. The magazine likewise shares the latest news on business, culture, and events within a crypto context.\n\nRanking as one of the leading websites on crypto and blockchain technology, with more than 5.1 million unique visitors, CoinDesk features a variety of resources for both novices and pros. Aside from news, it also offers podcasts and lessons that serve as great introductions to topics such as Bitcoin, blockchain, Ethereum, and crypto trading.

It delivers news that covers a number of cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin, Ripple, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Altcoin. It also covers blockchain, business, and technology, as well as policies and regulations concerning cryptocurrencies.

But whether or not it will come to replace traditional assets still remains to be seen.\n\nAs crypto continues to grow, so too will its use cases, investors, supporters, and yes, even detractors. And while it has become hugely popular, enticing many to join and invest in crypto, there\u2019s a bigger barrier to entry that prevents many individuals to go right into it, and that\u2019s lack of knowledge.\n\nThere\u2019s a wealth of articles, guides, and reviews that cover almost every aspect imaginable when it comes to crypto and blockchain technology, giving them a more open, and thus, seemingly more accessible, air.\n\nHowever, this research highlighted that younger generations show significant interest in digital assets, but many face barriers to active participation in the cryptocurrency or NFT market due to insufficient knowledge and a lack of national and international market regulations that would improve investor trust and transaction security.\n\nAdditionally, a substantial portion of respondents cited security concerns, specifically data privacy, as a significant obstacle. Other barriers include government regulations, reservations about the technology itself, and strong habits involving the use of physical cash.\n\nOne of the best things you can do, whether you\u2019re a long-time crypto advocate or a novice, is to arm yourself with updated knowledge on crypto and blockchain technology to stay ahead of the game.\n\nLike any other financial and investment endeavor, delving into crypto can either make you more money or cause you to lose money. It\u2019s a gamble that may be worth taking, especially if you\u2019re looking to grow your assets and you\u2019re equipped with sufficient knowledge and insights from some of the industry\u2019s thought leaders.\n\nHave you ever tried going into crypto? Which digital currency did you invest in and who among these thought leaders have made an impact on your decisions?\n\nFrequently Asked Questions Who is the best crypto analyst?

This anticipation presents a compelling case for investors looking for the next big opportunity in cryptocurrency.\n\nHere are the top 3 altcoins set to skyrocket if an Ethereum-based ETF is released.\n\nMemeinator: Reshaping the very fabric of meme coin culture\n\nBorn from the narrative of a futuristic entity venturing from 2077 to \u201cterminate\u201d underperforming meme coins, Memeinator stands out with its unique mission.\n\nThe allure of Memeinator goes beyond its technology; it\u2019s a cultural force. It taps into the nostalgia of the 90s, appealing to a generation that is now actively investing in altcoins. Memeinator\u2019s loyal community has already grown to over 115K followers on X (Twitter) and over 13K on Telegram. Unlike the typical \u2018cute and cuddly\u2019 meme coins, Memeinator brings a gritty, edgy vibe that resonates with many young investors. This coin is not just a financial asset; it\u2019s a statement.\n\nMemeinator\u2019s well-thought-out tokenomics lend to its growing reputation as a standout investment opportunity. It includes quarterly token burns, which started in the presale when the development team followed the community\u2019s advice to burn tokens to increase the value of the offer. Additionally, Memeinator offers staking, with an APY of up to 45%, and a generous referral program.\n\nAnother aspect of Memeinator\u2019s platform that is sure to be a community favorite is its Meme Warfare game. This classic shoot-em-up-style game will allow users to kill off useless meme coins with a variety of different Terminator-inspired weapons. Adding an extra layer of dynamism, its AI-driven Memescanner will hunt the corners of the internet, looking for weak, pathetic meme coins to feed into the game, representing them as characters for players to destroy.\n\nThe Memeinator team has recently announced that they\u2019ll be partnering with Red Apple Tech, an award-winning gaming studio that specializes in blockchain, metaverse, AR, and VR. With 40 million downloads to its name and the likes of Disney on its client list, Red Apple will certainly bring some powerful thinking to the Memeinator vision.\n\nEven though Memeinator isn\u2019t a GameFi project, given its shared characteristics, it is primed to ride the wave of a burgeoning GameFi market, which is projected to skyrocket to $90 billion by 2031, according to Business Research Insights.\n\nIts combination of an engaging narrative, an interactive AI-backed game, and the overall growth of GameFi, presents a massive opportunity for growth. Analysts say that Memeinator could potentially surge 50x or even 100x. Its rapid presale stages and the dwindling number of available tokens are creating a sense of urgency among investors.\n\nMoreover, the meme coin market has exploded from a niche novelty to a sector worth $20 billion, according to CoinMarketCap. Take examples like Pepe and BONK; despite being low on utilities, they have seen tremendous market growth. BONK, gained over 4000% in the final months of 2023. And Pepe hit a $1.5 billion market cap earlier in the year, despite the bear market. This underscores the potential for significant returns in meme coins.\n\nOverall, Memeinator\u2019s presale is a golden opportunity to invest in a promising meme coin before it hits the public exchanges. The fear of missing out is real, especially given the presale\u2019s imminent conclusion in Q1.\n\nFor those who understand the power of pop culture in the crypto space, Memeinator represents not just an investment but a chance to be part of a movement that\u2019s reshaping the very fabric of meme coin culture.\n\nChainlink: Poised for growth in an Ethereum ETF era\n\nChainlink (LINK), a fundamental component of the Ethereum ecosystem, stands out as a prime example of the transformative potential of the crypto market.\n\nIntricately woven into Ethereum\u2019s fabric, Chainlink provides an essential service: oracles. These oracles are vital for importing real-world data into blockchain environments, a necessity for the functionality of many Ethereum-based projects.\n\nThe potential approval of an Ethereum ETF could significantly amplify Chainlink\u2019s visibility and attract further investment into its infrastructure. This could potentially lead to a substantial increase in its market value, with some speculating gains of several times its current worth.\n\nPolygon (MATIC) advantage: Scaling new heights in an Ethereum ETF future\n\nAnother altcoin that stands at the brink of significant growth is Polygon (MATIC). Seamlessly connected to Ethereum as a Layer 2 scaling solution, Polygon is at the forefront of enhancing Ethereum\u2019s capabilities, offering faster transactions and reduced costs.\n\nThe potential approval of an Ethereum ETF could herald a new era of increased investment and attention towards Ethereum, which, in turn, could escalate the demand for Polygon\u2019s scaling solutions. As Ethereum grows, the need for efficient transaction processing becomes more critical, positioning Polygon as a key player in managing this surge.\n\nIndustry experts and enthusiasts alike speculate that in such a scenario, Polygon might experience a surge in its market value, some saying that it could reach as high as $10 in 2024.\n\nSummary\n\nThe potential approval of an Ethereum ETF stands to be a watershed moment for the crypto market, with promising tokens like Memeinator, Chainlink, and Polygon positioned for significant growth.\n\nWith its unique narrative of time-traveling to eliminate weak meme coins, Memeinator presents an exciting investment opportunity, blending nostalgia with innovative technology. Chainlink\u2019s indispensable role in providing real-world data to Ethereum\u2019s blockchain and Polygon\u2019s critical function as a scaling solution highlights their potential for substantial growth in this new era.\n\nThe excitement around these tokens, particularly Memeinator, is palpable. Recently, Memeinator has gained some considerable PR, trending with #Memeinator on X (Twitter). This came after the project targeted Elon Musk with a billboard, close to the SpaceX offices.\n\nAs we approach the end of Q1, the urgency to participate in Memeinator\u2019s presale grows. There are only 129,310,345 tokens left to purchase before Memeinator\u2019s presale ends. With listings on major exchanges looming large, now could be the best time to buy into Memeinator."
