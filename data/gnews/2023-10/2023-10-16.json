        "content": "In a significant move this month, the Securities and Exchange Commission approved nine exchange-traded funds that invest in ethereum futures contracts.\n\nDoes this mean the SEC will soon allow spot bitcoin ETFs onto the market?\n\nInvestors are anxiously waiting for the SEC\u2019s decision. In August, the SEC was ordered by a court to vacate its rejection of Grayscale\u2019s application to convert the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into an ETF. Last week, the SEC decided not to appeal the court\u2019s ruling in the Grayscale case or require Grayscale to refile its application, which could have delayed approval for as much as a year.\n\nAlthough the arrival of ethereum futures ETFs is a welcome step toward the mainstreaming of crypto, there\u2019s no assurance yet that the SEC will act immediately to approve the 10 pending spot bitcoin ETF applications.\n\nThe situation is frustrating for everyone. Everyone except SEC Chair Gary Gensler seems to understand that a spot bitcoin ETF would be in investors\u2019 best interests, and greatly enhance consumer safety and protection against fraud.\n\nETFs are deservedly the most popular investment vehicle in the world; they feature low costs, low account minimums, transparency, liquidity, and ease of portfolio management.\n\nIt\u2019s easy for advisors to engage in portfolio rebalancing, dollar cost averaging and tax loss harvesting.\n\nAccess to virtually every other asset class is available through ETFs \u2014 and there are even inverse, 3x and single-stock ETFs. So why not a bitcoin ETF?\n\nGensler\u2019s refusal has raised everyone\u2019s ire. Four members of Congress \u2014 two Republicans and two Democrats \u2014 wrote to the SEC in late September demanding that it approve these ETFs immediately."

        "title": "What Is Wrapped Ethereum (WETH)? A Beginner's Guide - Unchained - Unchained",
        "content": "Wrapped Ethereum (ETH) enables ETH holders to wrap their tokens and use them in Ethereum\u2019s decentralized finance market in accordance with the ERC-20 token standard.\n\nThe Ethereum blockchain\u2019s native cryptocurrency, ether (ETH), follows different rules from those of the ERC-20 token standard. Wrapped Ethereum helps bridge this gap by offering a more versatile version of ETH.\n\nRead on as we discuss Wrapped Ethereum, how to wrap and unwrap ETH, and the various use cases.\n\nWhat Is Wrapped Ethereum (WETH)?\n\nWrapped Ethereum (WETH) is an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain pegged 1:1 to ETH.\n\nETH plays a critical role in the network by paying gas fees for transactions. However, with ERC-20 tokens following different rules, users cannot use their ETH in the same way as ERC-20 tokens.\n\nWETH\u2019s ERC-20 infrastructure opens this path, allowing compatibility across the blockchain and eliminating the need to develop new smart contracts.\n\nHow Does Wrapped Ethereum Work?\n\nETH preceded the development of the ERC-20 standard, and the lack of compatibility means customized programming for each dApp, which can be costly. With the wrapping technology, an ERC-20 wrapper envelopes the ETH. This eliminates the need for custom programming to ensure compatibility with ERC-20 contracts.\n\nHere\u2019s how you can wrap your ETH, turning it into WETH:\n\nSend the desired amount of ETH to a WETH smart contract.\n\nThe smart contract then returns equal WETH and locks your ETH.\n\nUse the WETH for investment purposes such as providing liquidity , lending, staking, NFT trading, and much more.\n\nWhen you want your ETH back, send the WETH to the smart contract, unlocking your ETH and sending it to your wallet.\n\nThe smart contract then automatically burns the WETH to ensure the 1:1 peg remains.\n\nInstead of exchanging the WETH for your ETH, you can also use a crypto exchange such as Uniswap or SushiSwap to swap it for another token or cryptocurrency.\n\nBenefits & Drawbacks for WETH\n\nWETH presents two key advantages:\n\nDeploy ETH in DeFi: ETH holders can deploy their holdings in decentralized protocols incompatible with ETH. Wrapped ETH presents an ERC-20 version of Ethereum that the holders can use to trade and lend in various DeFi protocols, for example.\n\nNo need to sell ETH: Investments are possible without losing access to ether holdings. Since investors can retrieve the ETH locked in the smart contract at any time, they don\u2019t have to sell their holdings for investment and trading purposes.\n\nThere are some risks associated with WETH:\n\nThe need to trust a third party : The protocol for wrapping Ethereum is not Turing-complete. That means automation via a smart contract on the blockchain is not possible. Centralized programs host the wrapping smart contracts, allowing certain parties to control the assets. This opens the door for potential manipulation and abuse of power.\n\nTarget for hackers : The centralized nature of the WETH smart contracts incentivizes bad actors to exploit any existing vulnerabilities since all the assets are in one place.\n\nWrapped Ethereum Use Cases\n\nThere are two key use cases for WETH:\n\nLiquidity Pools : On decentralized exchanges such as UniSwap, users can add their WETH to liquidity pools and earn fees. The fees come from other users who opt to swap their tokens.\n\nLending : Platforms such as AAVE offer collateralized crypto loans. You can lend your WETH to other users and earn interest. You can recall your assets at any time, provided the smart contract for the lending agreement allows it.\n\nWrapped Ethereum on Other Blockchains\n\nSo far, we have only mentioned the Ethereum blockchain, which may leave you wondering if you can wrap ETH on other blockchains. At its core, wrapping technology aims to achieve interoperability. Therefore, it is possible to wrap Ethereum outside the native blockchain.\n\nBlockchains such as Polygon, Avalanche, and BNB Chain contain different versions of wrapped ETH.\n\nBlockchain bridging services\n\ncan also enhance cross-chain interoperability. A smart contract stores the ETH on the native blockchain and then mints an equivalent amount on the destination blockchain. The bridging process has its risks, with the key being the vulnerability of the smart contracts. Ensure you have all the information about the bridging service you intend to use before risking your ETH.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nWrapped Ethereum provides a user-friendly way to bridge Ethereum\u2019s native token and the blockchain ERC-20 token standard, enabling ETH to be used in wrapped form across the entire dApp ecosystem on Ethereum."

        "title": "How to build a DApp on Ethereum - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The Ethereum DApps ecosystem is thriving, and the potential for decentralized applications (DApps) is immense. Who wouldn\u2019t want to participate?\n\nDevelopers can now build applications with their own native coins or nonfungible tokens (NFTs) on secure blockchain networks to serve any purpose \u2014 from financial and industrial use cases to social media sites and, of course, for gaming.\n\nLet\u2019s look at some questions developers might have and how they can get started on an Ethereum DApp project.\n\nWhat are DApps?\n\nDApps are blockchain-based versions of the applications and software we use daily. They are powered with smart contract technology and built on smart contract-enabled blockchains like Ethereum.\n\nThe main benefits of DApps are that they can run on decentralized blockchains controlled by technology or community methods of governance rather than single corporate entities. With blockchain networks, DApp data doesn\u2019t live in a single place, so there\u2019s higher network security. DApps use cryptocurrencies, which makes allocating and transferring value, or making payments, far easier and less costly than fiat currency transactions.\n\nCan you build DApps on Ethereum without experience?\n\nFor those who are already software or web developers, Ethereum DApp development might come naturally with an understanding of blockchain technology, smart contracts, Solidity programming language and cryptocurrencies.\n\nThere are also platforms in development that will allow developers to build DApps with less blockchain, programming and smart contract knowledge, but it\u2019s helpful to have some development experience.\n\nWhich blockchain is best to create a DApp?\n\nEthereum\u2019s longevity in the crypto space and its popularity often make it the preferred blockchain for DApp building. The network is still innovating; it is tried and tested and has an established ecosystem for DApp development. However, one may consider the transaction or Ethereum gas fees a crucial factor to weigh against other networks before embarking on any development initiatives.\n\nOther smart contract blockchain networks include Solana, Polkadot, BNB Smart Chain, Eos, Tron and Cardano; each has its strengths and weaknesses compared to Ethereum.\n\nThe network chosen may have implications for the interoperability, scalability, security and cost of the DApp development, as well as dictate the community of DApp users that can be reached when launched.\n\nTo decide which blockchain is best to create a DApp, developers can begin by analyzing a DApp\u2019s requirements and goals, as well as looking at the development expertise within the existing team or the team hired.\n\nHow many DApps run on Ethereum?\n\nOver 3,000 DApps are running on Ethereum, with more in development. DappRadar is a popular site to check out the DApps on Ethereum and its competitor networks, as well as how many users each DApp has and how many transactions are processed.\n\nWhy build a DApp on Ethereum?\n\nThere are a number of smart contract blockchains to consider for those planning to build a DApp, but Ethereum is arguably the most popular and has the highest decentralized security.\n\nEthereum was the first smart contract blockchain, and it has a large developer community and repositories of open-source code available for new developers. It\u2019s also a common choice for business developers looking to develop their own enterprise-level blockchain initiatives.\n\nWhat are Ethereum DApps examples?\n\nThere are hundreds of popular Ethereum DApps and many more that are just building their user bases; here are a few established and well-used examples:\n\nUniswap\n\nOne of the most-used Ethereum DApps is the decentralized exchange (DEX) Uniswap, which has now seen over $1 trillion traded on the platform.\n\nOpenSea\n\nThe OpenSea platform is one of the largest NFT marketplaces, with over 2 million NFT collections and 80 million individual NFTs for sale.\n\nMetaMask\n\nBoth a cryptocurrency wallet and a gateway, or browser, for accessing blockchain-based applications, MetaMask is known as a user-friendly crypto tool.\n\nAxie Infinity\n\nThis NFT-based game is a great example of an in-play virtual economy in action, and it\u2019s one of the most popular DApp games.\n\nHow to build an Ethereum DApp\n\nAspiring developers can begin an Ethereum DApp development by considering what a DApp needs and its purpose. Then, the next step is to start researching Ethereum DApp development tools and processes.\n\nDApp and smart contract development can be complex, and it\u2019s certainly different from conventional web or software development. A sensible place to begin in-depth research is Ethereum\u2019s Developer Resources, which is \u201ca builders manual for Ethereum.\u201d As a decentralized application tutorial, it\u2019s one of the most comprehensive.\n\nFive elements to consider while building an Ethereum DApp\n\nAn Ethereum DApp development project will need to be planned in detail, just like any business or project. To map out how to build a DApp on Ethereum, here are a few more components to research first:\n\n1. Development environment, tools and smart contracts\n\nOnce a development team is finalized, a DApp will need a development environment, usually a blockchain-based testnet, where Ethereum DApp architecture can be built and tested using applicable development tools. Smart contracts also have to be expertly designed and written.\n\n2. Security\n\nBlockchain networks can be more secure for financial transactions than traditional systems, but it\u2019s not feasible to skimp on Ethereum DApp security. Cryptographic security is complex, and it needs to be understood well or expert-driven, remembering that blockchain networks and cryptocurrencies are frequently targeted by hackers and scammers.\n\n3. Front-end development and user experience\n\nFront-end DApp development usually happens after the DApp architecture and smart contract build. A front-end web or Web3 application might use more conventional development tools, but the user experience will need to be designed in detail, too, to ensure a project\u2019s success.\n\n4. Ethereum DApp testing and debugging\n\nDevelopers planning to build on Ethereum benefit from blockchain technology that has been used and tested, as well as open-source code repositories to help with new projects. However, developers must also test and debug new DApp builds, smart contracts and UI/UX, as there\u2019s nothing worse than launching software that doesn\u2019t work!\n\n5. DApp deployment\n\nAn Ethereum DApp deployment will be the last element of a project and probably the most exciting. Once testing and debugging is complete, a DApp is taken out of its testnet and deployed to the Ethereum mainnet, where it can be used by customers. At this stage, a project\u2019s sales and marketing will begin in earnest.\n\nHow much does it cost to build a DApp on Ethereum?\n\nDevelopers with experience who build their own DApps using the Ethereum development tools available may experience lower build costs. For developers or entrepreneurs looking to hire a DApp developer or an Ethereum DApp development team, estimates can run from $15,000 and upward for a simple DApp to $30,000 and upward for a more complex DApp or to hire a more experienced developer.\n\nChallenges associated with DApp development on the Ethereum blockchain\n\nBuilding a DApp on Ethereum or any other blockchain will be without its challenges. Here are a few that might need to be anticipated:\n\nMarket saturation\n\nThere are already over 3,000 DApps built on Ethereum, so any new DApp development must compete, at least within the Ethereum community, for attention.\n\nScalability, speed, security, interoperability and decentralization\n\nEvery smart contract blockchain is still working on sufficiently answering blockchain\u2019s promises and the inherent challenge of delivering the ability of projects to scale for mainstream use and become interoperable with other projects and technologies while retaining security and decentralization.\n\nTransaction or gas fees and crypto price volatility\n\nEvery transaction within a DApp generates transaction fees \u2014 in Ethereum\u2019s case, gas fees \u2014 which are usually passed on to DApp users. Crypto coins or tokens associated with DApps will also experience the price volatility felt by the broader market.\n\nAvailability of expertise/smart contract complexity\n\nBlockchain development is still a very new profession, so there\u2019s a real shortage of seasoned experts, and smart contracts still have their technological limitations for developers to navigate.\n\nLack of sector regulation\n\nAs crypto coins and tokens, including those used in DApps, have yet to be comprehensively regulated, there\u2019s much uncertainty when developing these digital currencies.\n\nUser experience\n\nOutside of the crypto community, DApp functionalities can be difficult for consumers used to conventional apps to get to grips with, and many consumers are still unsure about using cryptocurrencies."

        "content": "Ethereum price started a steady increase from the $1,520 zone against the US dollar. ETH is now struggling to clear the $1,605 and $1,620 resistance levels.\n\nEthereum is attempting a recovery wave above the $1,570 level.\n\nThe price is trading just above $1,575 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere is a key bullish trend line forming with support near $1,572 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair could rise further if there is a close above the $1,620 resistance level.\n\nEthereum Price Gains Traction\n\nEthereum started a fresh increase from the $1,520 level. ETH gained traction like Bitcoin and spiked above the $1,600 resistance level. It even climbed above $1,620, but the bears appeared near $1,650.\n\nA high was formed near $1,669 before there was a fresh decline. Ether trimmed gains and settled below the $1,600 level. It tested the $1,575 support and is currently consolidating near the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $1,669 swing high to the $1,574 low.\n\nEthereum is now trading just above $1,575 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is also a key bullish trend line forming with support near $1,572 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.\n\nOn the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $1,605 level. The first major resistance is near the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $1,669 swing high to the $1,574 low at $1,620. A close above the $1,620 resistance might start a decent increase.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nIn the stated case, Ether could rise and recover toward the $1,665 resistance. Any more gains might open the doors for a move toward $1,750.\n\nAnother Decline in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $1,605 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,575 level and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThe next key support is $1,550. A downside break below the $1,550 support might send the price further lower. In the stated case, the price could drop toward the $1,520 level. Any more losses may perhaps send Ether toward the $1,440 level.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bullish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now above the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $1,575\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $1,620\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "To enshrine or not to enshrine? Ethereum's existential debate continues - Blockworks",
        "content": "Enshrinement is an often contested topic in \u201cEthereum land\u201d that seems to be trending again, Blockworks co-founder Michael Ippolito says.\n\nThe argument over enshrinement centers on whether more elements should be baked in or pushed out toward the edges of the Ethereum network protocol, he explains. Ippolito notes that the many attempts to enshrine account abstraction \u201cdemonstrate how difficult it is actually to enshrine things in the protocol, even if you can decide as a community that this makes sense.\u201d\n\nOn the Bell Curve podcast (Spotify/Apple), Myles O\u2019Neil, an associate at the advisory and investment firm Reverie, illustrates the enshrinement dilemma with an analogy. Comparing a blockchain to how a government should treat its country, O\u2019Neil says one could argue that \u201cit\u2019s not great to let everything go to the private market. There are certain services that lead to natural monopolies.\u201d\n\nIf private companies entirely capture elements such as utilities, \u201cthat would not be healthy for the underlying ecosystem,\u201d O\u2019Neil says as an example. The idea applies to Ethereum in the sense that certain utilities should be \u201cregulated\u201d or \u201cnationalized\u201d for the \u201cgreater health of the ecosystem,\u201d he says.\n\nRead more: Account abstraction: Finding a balance between on- and off-chain activity\n\nSounds like communism!\n\nThe pushback O\u2019Neil hears is \u201cthat sounds like communism to me!\u201d Such a controlled arrangement may not be healthy for attracting future entrepreneurs and innovators, he says.\n\nAnother way to imagine the situation is to think of Ethereum like an operating system, O\u2019Neil says. Operating systems built by Apple and Microsoft bundle many first-party applications into their systems, O\u2019Neil says, citing examples such as browsers, email clients, calendars and messaging services.\n\nThe first-party apps serve to protect consumers in some ways, he says, \u201cbecause relinquishing this control to the private market could lead to worse user experiences,\u201d but, he adds, \u201cit also is effective in deterring competition.\u201d\n\nEnshrining is, in a sense, building \u201cfirst-party apps\u201d that make the rest of the ecosystem better, O\u2019Neil says. But it\u2019s important, he says, to leave \u201cample room for third parties to come and innovate and build and drive value.\u201d\n\nWinners are emerging\n\nWhether imagining Ethereum as a government or an operating system, O\u2019Neil says the \u201cbig question\u201d is \u201ccan we retain this value of credible neutrality that attracts entrepreneurs and reduces platform risk?\u201d\n\n\u201cWinners have started to emerge,\u201d O\u2019Neil says, which may not be healthy for the rest of the ecosystem. \u201cWhether that is Lido today or Eigenlayer tomorrow,\u201d O\u2019Neil wonders if mechanisms operating \u201csuper close to the metal\u201d should be more directly controlled by the chain.\n\nRead more: EigenLayer\u2019s endgame: \u2018Dissolve into Ethereum itself\u2019\n\n\u201cAnd if we do that, does that actually deter future entrepreneurs from coming and building third-party apps?\u201d he asks.\n\nThe uniting principle should be \u201cgood user experience,\u201d Ippolito says, whether from the perspective of a citizen\u2019s access to a healthy banking and utilities system, or a user\u2019s interactions with a good operating system.\n\nIf the basic utilities in an operating system work well, Ippolito says, \u201cthen it\u2019s going to lead to all of these other profitable activities.\u201d\n\n\u201cSame thing with a country,\u201d he continues. Countries provide \u201cpublic goods\u201d such as roads via taxation and enforce regulation to protect against monopolistic behavior, he says.\n\n\u201cThe middle ground here is some form of regulation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe governance should fit how close you are to the metal,\u201d Ippolito says. At the base, Ethereum is decentralized, with staking services like Lido operating just \u201cone level up.\u201d Therefore, the service should be \u201calmost as flat and decentralized as Ethereum itself,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cThe crux of it is,\u201d Ippolito asks, \u201cwhat is so close to the metal that it actually should just be directly controlled by Ethereum?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd that is what I have less of a solid answer for.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "Six Important Considerations for the Ethereum Price Going in Q4 2023 - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "Ethereum is the longstanding second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Its market cap is in the $180 billion as we head into the second half of October 2023. (Meanwhile, Bitcoin\u2019s market cap is around $530 billion).\n\nEther price has been stuck in the doldrums since March. Sliding to the $1,550 handle last week, ETH is now on par with its March exchange rate to the US dollar.\n\nEther Up +30% Over Jan, But Down -25% Since Apr\n\nAfter a steep but short-lived rally in the first half of April, achieving a YTD high price of $2,120, Ether is now trading at a 7-month low price with two weeks left until November.\n\nAs a result of Ethereum launching out of 2022 with a hot bull run to thaw out the crypto winter frost this January, ETH is up 30% YTD. It started the year off trading at $1,200.\n\nBut on the 6-month chart, Ether\u2019s price is down 25%, with a 4.72% decline in the last 30 days. Investors are keen to know the next moves on major crypto exchanges.\n\nHere are 6 key factors to consider for the near, medium, and long term:\n\n1. Low Fees Driving Ether Inflation (Mixed)\n\nThe rapid development of the Ethereum platform has made it theoretically better than ever. The Merge and a number of Layer-2 scalability chains have made the platform faster and cheaper than ever.\n\nBut lower fees are a mixed bag.\n\nLower gas fees could attract more users and developers to Ethereum. But they are driving Ether inflation by burning fewer tokens than new ETH issuance by stakers.\n\nIn the trailing 30 days, Ether supply has grown by 33,500 ETH (worth $52 million). That is an inflationary headwind for Ether\u2019s price and a far cry from the initially deflationary effects of the merge.\n\n2. Ether Price Looks Good on 1YR, 5YR Charts (Bullish)\n\nThere\u2019s little doubt that Ethereum is here to stay as the world\u2019s leading decentralized computer. Its merge was almost too successful too soon in up-scaling the blockchain\u2019s throughput capacity.\n\nWhile before there was not enough pipe for all the oil, there\u2019s now less oil than a pipe. But the network is ready to take on massive growth when the timing is right.\n\nMeanwhile, on the 1-year chart, Ether price is down to a seven-month low. There\u2019s no telling for sure when it\u2019ll reach the bottom, but in its entire history, we\u2019re near the average length of peak-to-bottom.\n\nEther looks even cheaper on the 5-year chart, with Ether down 76% from its all-time high of $4,600 in Nov 2021. Furthermore, ETH on crypto exchanges is at its lowest level since 2018, according to Santiment data.\n\nThat\u2019s bullish for Ether because such moves \u201creduce selling pressure and show investors\u2019 long-term convictions.\u201d Bag holders are apparently confident in the value of Ethereum\u2019s long-range macro-thesis.\n\n3. ETH Staking Demand Has Crashed Since June (Bearish)\n\nIn June, the validator queue to stake Ether had 96,600 in line to stake as validator nodes for blockchain rewards. By October, that number had fallen to a mere 223. That\u2019s according to Validator Queue with data from Beacon Chain Ethereum Explorer.\n\nThe average wait time to stake ETH has fallen from 45 days to an hour and fifty minutes. This isn\u2019t all bad for the price. One of the reasons for falling staking demand is the rise of liquid staking options like Lido.\n\nHowever, Lido and other liquid staking services create additional risks for Ethereum.\n\nA misconfiguration earlier this month caused 20 Lido validators to get slashed from the network. The failure incurred $30,000 worth of ETH penalties for Lido to withdraw its staked Ether.\n\nFurthermore, staking services are creating a larger target area for SEC action under an aggressive SEC regime. So, the staking outlook for Ethereum is currently leaning bearish.\n\n4. Ether Price and Institutional Demand (Bullish)\n\nStaking demand on Ethereum probably won\u2019t stay low forever, though.\n\nWhile they are slow to move on cryptocurrencies, institutional investors are growing increasingly interested in on-chain BTC and spot ETF Bitcoin. They\u2019re also interested in staking Ether.\n\nInstitutional Tradfi investors like that Ether is more energy efficient and eco-friendly than Bitcoin with staked validators instead of proof-of-work post-merge. That\u2019ll be great for Ethereum when Wall Street finally makes big moves in crypto:\n\n\u201cEarlier this year, BlackRock\u2019s legendary chief executive Larry Fink, who shocked the world when he announced a surprise crypto flip, said he expects bitcoin and crypto to \u2018transcend\u2019 traditional currencies, including the U.S. dollar, thanks to Wall Street adoption.\u201d\n\nOne Tradfi institution, British bank Standard Chartered, is so bullish over these prospects that it recently projected Ether to grow in market value to $8,000 per 1 ETH by the end of 2026.\n\n5. Regulatory Threats (Bearish)\n\nHowever, don\u2019t expect a bevy of institutions to jump into staking Ether by the end of next week. It will still be some time before traditional financial institutions and hedge funds feel ready to make a move.\n\nA big part of that is regulatory ambiguity driven by an overreaching SEC and a scrum of policymakers taking their time to understand and legislate policy for blockchain in the United States.\n\nTraditional investing institutions, meanwhile, are loathe to make any big moves without being sure they won\u2019t endanger their relationship with the immensely powerful Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\n6. Ether price supply and demand economics (Bullish)\n\nAlong with its older cousin, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other major cryptos have an astonishing multi-year track record of high-ROI bull runs based on monetary policy and supply and demand.\n\nWhile the Federal Reserve is committed to taming inflation, it may not be able to avoid a policy of monetary expansion to keep the economy from getting sluggish.\n\nThe US central bank certainly seems poised to enter an interest rate pause in 2024, if not a more dovish regime. That has always buoyed Bitcoin and Ether with macro tailwinds.\n\nFurthermore, Bitcoin\u2019s halving cycle is about to reach another quadrennial cut in new supply this April. That has, in every cycle so far, been a major factor in precipitating bull runs on Bitcoin and Ethereum, as profits spill over into the rest of the ecosystem seeking more ROI, and altcoins ride BTC\u2019s coattails.\n\nThe previously mentioned 5-year low ETH levels on crypto exchanges are worth mentioning again in any current discussion about the supply and demand economics underlying Ether price."

        "title": "Ethereum or Bitcoin: Which one is a better investment in 2023? - Bitrates",
        "content": "Cryptocurrencies are very popular, and many people and sectors have begun to consider and embrace them in their everyday lives.\n\nAlthough digital assets are volatile, some virtual currencies appeal to investors, as they are considered relatively safe investments because they have shown their ability to recover from hard periods. Also, both virtual coins have brought massive gains to investors. This is why, even if joining the crypto world sometimes feels like a rollercoaster ride, investors can benefit if they are willing to take risks.\n\nBut in many cases, people don\u2019t know what to choose between the two alternatives and wonder which one is a better investment. Bitcoin and Ethereum have different characteristics, and this is why they fulfill distinct purposes. It is hard to pick one over the other, as both are good options depending on what you want to achieve with them.\n\nSo, let\u2019s look at the two most important cryptocurrencies and see their characteristics and differences.\n\nWhat is Bitcoin?\n\nBitcoin was the first digital coin developed in 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto. It was created to provide an alternative to fiat money, which is why it is a decentralized and transparent financial system that everyone can easily access. Bitcoin relies on blockchain technology, which means that the transactions can\u2019t be altered as they are recorded on a public ledger, and because of that, they are more resistant to fraud.\n\nBefore Bitcoin, more attempts were made to create cryptocurrencies, but none succeeded. This is why Bitcoin is the pioneer of all the other cryptocurrencies launched in the following years.\n\nThe main advantages of Bitcoin are the following:\n\nIt is the crypto with the most liquidity\n\nIt had a massive growth over the last few years\n\nIt offers faster transaction speed\n\nIt is a safer alternative, as it uses blockchain to prevent fraud or identity theft\n\nIts value is based on supply and demand and not on political interference\n\nWhat is Ethereum?\n\nEthereum is the second leading cryptocurrency, which brought many innovations in the crypto game. Ethereum was launched in 2015, and since then, it has been a popular open-ended platform where users can develop smart contracts and dApps. Also, Ethereum has more purposes besides trading, as it can be used to buy goods and services. Ethereum\u2019s strengths lie in its utility, bringing many opportunities in the crypto sector.\n\nEthereum was created to overcome the shortcomings of Bitcoin, and it succeeded with that, as Ethereum is not just a blockchain where you can trade digital coins, but the platform also supports NFTs and benefits many sectors, including travel and music.\n\nThese are the main benefits of Ethereum:\n\nThe transactions are processed quickly\n\nIt has many users and a large community\n\nIt uses blockchain technology for its decentralized system\n\nIt enables many functionalities, like decentralized applications and smart contracts\n\nIt is a more sustainable and scalable option\n\nWhat are the differences between Bitcoin and Ethereum?\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum have significant similarities because they are both decentralized networks, and no third party or central authority controls their operations and transactions. But despite the similarities, some differences set them apart. These are the most visible discrepancies between the two of them.\n\nNetwork utility\n\nEthereum and Bitcoin are very different regarding their network utility. Experts agree that Bitcoin has no utility besides being a value store. On the other hand, Ethereum brings limitless possibilities. For example, Ethereum enables the development of dApps and smart contracts, giving users many advantages.\n\nGas fees\n\nRegarding transaction fees, Ethereum loses out to Bitcoin. And although Ethereum enables quicker transactions than Bitcoin, unfortunately, the gas fees are quite significant. The Ethereum community is slowly taking action towards this aspect, which is why things will probably change.\n\nDifferent energy consumption\n\nA major difference between the two cryptos is how they consume energy. Both Ethereum and Bitcoin initially used the proof-of-work (PoW) mechanism to validate transactions and secure the blockchain. However, as crypto enthusiasts wanted a change, Ethereum switched to a proof-of-stake (PoS) mechanism, reducing energy consumption. The change was praised, as it decreased energy usage by more than 99%, which was wanted for a long time.\n\nWhich of the two cryptocurrencies is a better investment in 2023?\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum are both good alternatives to be considered as they have increased their value since they were first launched in the market. However, because they have unique features, it is hard to say which one is a better investment, as it differs depending on everyone\u2019s goals and needs. Bitcoin is a great option for anyone who wants an alternative to fiat money. On the other hand, Ethereum is more than just a digital asset, so it can be a better choice for those who want more features, as this network also allows users to sell or buy goods and develop dApps.\n\nBut cryptos are volatile, so investments in any type of cryptocurrencies involve risks, whether choosing Ethereum or Bitcoin. So, anyone who wants to invest in digital assets must be prepared to navigate through the challenges of this industry. Experts recommend allocating only a small part of the digital assets in their portfolio and opting for more than one alternative, as the more diversified the portfolio, the safer it will be.\n\nIt is good to research before making an impulsive decision and not consider cryptos only because they are popular. The fear of missing out, also known as FOMO, can lead to impulsive buying, which will not be beneficial, as investors could have considerable losses. Instead, anyone wanting to invest in cryptos must adopt a long-term view and focus on creating a strong portfolio. The most successful stories with investing in cryptos come from disciplined investors who didn\u2019t let their emotions influence their decisions. Also, they invest as much as they can afford to lose and never more.\n\nFinal words\n\nAlthough there are many differences between Ethereum and Bitcoin, it is hard to say which one is a better investment, as both represent good alternatives depending on anyone\u2019s needs and desires."

Discover SCENE\n\nThe queue for adding new staking validators on Ethereum briefly hit zero yesterday.\n\nIt's now risen again to 996 validators, but it's still a far cry from its peak on June 10, when over 96,500 validators faced a waiting period of over 45 days, per Beaconcha.in data.\n\nIn broad strokes, the slowdown suggests a dwindling appetite for staking Ethereum.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nValidators are responsible for proposing and validating new blocks on a proof-of-stake blockchain like Ethereum. In return, they receive a reward for their contribution to the network. An Ethereum validator must stake a minimum of 32 ETH to begin operating.\n\nImportantly, the reward has also dropped from its June peak of 5.2% yield\u2013doled out in ETH\u2013to 3.5% today, per Beaconcha.in.\n\nAmitej Gajjala, the co-founder of liquid staking platform Stader Labs, told Decrypt that the drop could represent \u201ca short-term market slowdown due to continued bearish conditions and lowering Ethereum staking rewards.\u201d\n\nThe Ethereum validator queue hits zero on October 16. Soure: beaconcha.in\n\nA queue forms because there is a limit of 3,600 validators that are allowed to enter or exit the validation process per day.\n\nSeraphim Czecker, a contributor at Lido Finance, told Decrypt, that it\u2019s merely a \u201ctemporary equilibrium\u201d after a \u201ccatalyst-driven staking wave\u201d due to the Shapella upgrade \u201cwas absorbed.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nShapella\u2013a combination of two proposals called Shanghai and Capella\u2013enabled withdrawals of staked ETH for the first time since staking on Ethereum was first activated in December 2020, increasing the demand for staking after the upgrade.\n\nKirill Kutakov, the co-founder of liquid staking protocol StakeWise, concurs with a similar analysis, stating that, \u201cwe are merely back to the natural demand for staking that was exhibited before Shanghai, which may sometimes result in low days.\u201d\n\nHe added, \"I would turn bearish only if the deposits began to decrease compared to the pre-Shanghai period.\"\n\nA Dune dashboard by data analyst Hildobby shows just that, however, with Ethereum deposits steadily decreasing since May.\n\nThis decline has brought Ethereum deposits close to the levels mentioned by Kutakov during the pre-Shanghai period.\n\nMonthly deposits to Ethereum staking contract. Source: Dune .\n\nCurrently, 27,779,142 ETH, representing 23.1% of Ethereum\u2019s circulating supply, is staked to the contract across 864,898 validators, per Nansen data.\n\nWhat\u2019s next for Ethereum stakers?\n\nLido\u2019s Czecker is now betting that institutional money is going to lead the next wave of deposits in Ethereum staking contracts.\n\nHowever, they said that it may take some time because there is a \u201clack of understanding of what staking is to begin with.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHe added that \u201ca more realistic target\u201d for DeFi would be \u201cfamily offices and asset managers with existing ETH balance sheets.\u201d\n\nCzecker also added that since the government bond yields are high right now, staking might not be as attractive.\n\nCurrently, short-term U.S. treasury notes are yielding 5.35%, per Ycharts data.\n\nEdited by Liam Kelly."

        "content": "A widely followed crypto analyst is naming a number of potential bullish catalysts for Ethereum (ETH) competitor Solana (SOL).\n\nIn a new video, the anonymous host of InvestAnswers tells his 447,000 YouTube subscribers that Solana is receiving more mainstream attention amid key program developments.\n\n\u201cI see a number of different tailwinds for Solana. It is still riskier than ETH. ETH is the 800-pound gorilla. Nearly everything runs on Ethereum. And it\u2019s very hard to knock that rider off the horse. But let me talk to you about some of the tailwinds\u2026\n\nThe world is waking up to it now, all the narratives, [the] mainstream media. You got Fidelity talking about ETH and SOL alongside each other. You have that other report coming out from Standard Chartered Bank. They said ETH is going to $8,000 and they also referenced Solana in their research paper that Solana could eat a lot of ETH market share, especially around things like tokenization, which was huge.\u201d\n\nThe analyst lists a number of tailwinds for Solana, including Solana Pay, which recently integrated with Shopify, and the project\u2019s crypto-friendly smartphone Saga.\n\n\u201cBut the tailwinds are Solana Pay, Saga phone, the decentralized app store. They\u2019ve got EVMs (Ethereum virtual machine) and SVMs (Solana virtual machine) built on Solana so now SOL-to-ETH bridging is very capable.\n\nFiredancer and one million transactions per second, that\u2019s coming. They hope to come out of beta at the end of this year and launch sometime in 2024. But that will bring resilience, efficiency, decentralization and security. This whole thing is built on C++, whereas Ethereum is built on Rust\u2026 And if they have both up and running, there is no risk of ever any downtime again.\n\nAlso, cost-efficiency and scalability, the Visa partnership, great tokenomics, gaming, tokenization of the world.\u201d\n\nSolana is trading for $24.18 at time of writing, up 9.27% in the last 24 hours.\n\nI\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Tokenized Real-World Asset Market to Hit $10 Trillion By 2030, 21.co Projects \u2013 Can RWAs Power Ethereum (ETH) to Multi-Trillion Market Cap?\n\nEther Logo / Source: Adobe\n\nThe market capitalization of tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) could balloon to as much as $10 trillion by the end of the decade in a bullish scenario, argued digital asset management company 21.co in a recently released report.\n\nEven in a bearish scenario, the market cap of tokenized RWAs will still reach $3.5 trillion before 2030, 21.co projected.\n\nThe market cap of tokenized RWAs was last around $116 billion, with USD-pegged stablecoins accounting for around 97% of this.\n\nAround 60% of all tokenized RWAs currently in existence are issued on the Ethereum blockchain, which remains the most widely used layer-1 protocol in the Decentralized Finance (DeFi), Non-Fungible Token (NFT) and web3 worlds.\n\nThese digital dollars mark the \u201cfirst successful tokenization implementation\u201d, according to 21.co.\n\nUSD-pegged stablecoins like Tether\u2019s USDT and Circle\u2019s USDC allow crypto users to transfer an asset that almost exactly approximates the real value of an actual US dollar to one another in a permissionless, censorship-resistant, borderless and near-instant manner.\n\nBoth cryptocurrencies are backed 1:1 with real US dollar or liquid-equivalent sat in bank accounts controlled by Tether and Circle.\n\n21.co noted rapid growth in other areas of asset tokenization, pointing to the 450% growth rate seen in the tokenized US government bond market, which has been aided by the fact that US bond yields have risen to multi-decade highs this year.\n\nRWAs \u2013 The Convergence of TradFi and Crypto\n\n\u201cThe convergence between crypto and traditional asset classes, including fiat currencies, equities, government bonds, and real estate, is experiencing an unprecedented growth,\u201d 21.co noted in its report.\n\nAs the crypto sector matures, more and more traditional institutions will build their own products on top of blockchains, the analysts argued.\n\n\u201cThrough this transition, crypto will increasingly integrate with existing financial software and bring RWAs on-chain via tokenization\u201d.\n\nRegulatory barriers and a potential lack of standardized processes are amongst the factors that 21.co thinks could slow the growth and adoption of tokenized RWAs.\n\nTokenized RWAs to Power Ether (ETH) to Multi-Trillion Dollar Market Cap?\n\nAssuming blockchains like Ethereum are able to maintain a dominant position as a place to issue tokenized RWAs, this could substantially bolster the demand for Ether (ETH) in the years ahead.\n\nEther (ETH) is the native token of the Ethereum blockchain and is used to pay gas fees that power transactions and blockchain activity.\n\nEther\u2019s market cap was last around $188 billion, around 3x more than the $60 billion in tokenized assets currently issued directly onto its blockchain.\n\nBut if by 2030, the blockchain hosts 60% of $10 trillion in tokenized RWAs, it wouldn\u2019t be out of the question to see Ether become multi-trillion dollar asset, potentially even rivalling gold\u2019s market cap, which was last around $12.8 trillion.\n\nThat being said, Ether has been performing poorly recently, down over 6% on the month and over 25% lower since this year\u2019s highs.\n\nWeek demand for the recently launched Ether futures ETFs in the US and weak on-chain activity that has seen the Ether supply turn inflationary once again are two factors explaining recent weak performance.\n\nFalling yields on staked ETH (last at around 3.5% APY) at a time when US bond yields are rising (the 10-year is above 4.8%) is another structural headwinds, while still relatively high transaction fees and relatively slow transaction times continue to act as a barrier to adoption.\n\nEther was last trading in the $1,570 area, with bears eyeing a break below a key long-term support in the low $1,500s that could open the door to a drop towards the sub-$1,400 March lows."

        "content": "Scroll, the latest Ethereum layer-2 network, has launched on mainnet.\n\nAccording to block explorer data, Scroll\u2019s testnet counts more than 900,000 wallet addresses as participants and has seen an estimated seven million transactions since August. Scroll\u2019s launch follows a year of testnet operation that has seen over 55 million transactions, the Scroll team told Blockworks.\n\nScroll is a general-purpose zkEVM roll-up intended to marry Ethereum\u2019s network security with lower fees and latency.\n\nScroll co-founder Sandy Peng told Blockworks in an interview that existing Ethereum projects will be able to directly deploy their projects onto Scroll and utilize its zkEVM technology.\n\n\u201cThe significance of zkEVM to developers lies in its ability to batch proofs in a highly efficient manner, offering faster transaction speeds at reduced costs. A key element in this process is bytecode-level compatibility,\u201d Peng said.\n\nBytecode in computer programming is a language that simplifies complicated machine cryptography so that code can be more easily processed by computer hardware.\n\nDeployed smart contracts will store the bytecode of their transactions on Scroll. These transactions will then be sent to a centralized zkEVM node that will prove that the state of the transaction is accurate without revealing the contents of the transaction.\n\nOnce the transaction is verified, the information will be published to Ethereum, updating the transaction\u2019s state without the transaction being re-executed.\n\n\u201cThanks to this feature, Ethereum devs can leverage all the same tools they are familiar with, ensuring that everything operates seamlessly right from the start,\u201d Peng said.\n\nScroll\u2019s mainnet code has been audited by four major auditing firms including: Zellic, Trail of Bits, OpenZeppelin and KALOS, Peng notes.\n\nPath to decentralization\n\nThe Scroll team is currently in its \u201cresearch\u201d phase for its decentralized prover network and decentralized sequencer.\n\n\u201cIn the current instantiation, the protocol will halt if the sequencer goes offline, and no back-up is available,\u201d Peng said.\n\nPeng notes that the team is currently working on a protocol upgrade that will enable \u201cforced batches.\u201d\n\nThis means that the protocol will allow the permissionless publication of batches through the base layer even in the case of a sequencer halt.\n\n\u201cMid-term, the goal is to minimize the probability of a sequencer halt through decentralization,\u201d Peng said.\n\nAlthough in its current state, Scroll is upgradeable via a multi-signature wallet controlled by its core team, there are plans to introduce a Security Council and a delayed upgrade mechanism in the near future.\n\nThis means that the protocol will only be upgradeable if it receives approval from the Security Council, and the multisig team will only have the capability of initiating delayed upgrades, Peng explains.\n\n\u201cWe have been working on an SGX-based second prover with an external team of TEE experts for more than 6 months, which will soon enable us to have a functioning Multi-Prover deployed on Scroll,\u201d she said.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

ETH formed a short-term support base and recently started a fresh increase from the $1,520 zone, like Bitcoin.\n\nThere was a move above the $1,550 resistance level. The price climbed above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the main drop from the $1,664 swing high to the $1,521 low. Besides, there was a break above a major bearish trend line with resistance near $1,555 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.\n\nEthereum is now trading just above $1,550 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. However, the bears seem to be preventing an upside break above the $1,565 resistance.\n\nIf there is a clear move above the $1,565 resistance, Ether could rise toward the next major hurdle at $1,600. It is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the main drop from the $1,664 swing high to the $1,521 low. A close above the $1,600 resistance might start a decent increase.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nIn the stated case, Ether could rise and recover toward the $1,665 resistance. Any more gains might open the doors for a move toward $1,750.\n\nAnother Decline in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $1,565 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,550 level and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThe next key support is $1,520. A downside break below the $1,520 support might send the price further lower. In the stated case, the price could drop toward the $1,440 level. Any more losses may perhaps send Ether toward the $1,420 level.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bullish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now above the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $1,550\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $1,565\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

An astonishing 4,600 y00ts holders migrated their assets from Polygon to Ethereum within the first seven hours of being feasible via http://bridge.y00ts.com.\n\n4600 y00ts have already migrated in the first 7 hours. y00ts show up. pic.twitter.com/nLhjDD4Iej \u2014 Frank (@frankdegods) October 16, 2023\n\nIncentivizing Early Adopters to Evolve\n\nOnboarding y00ts collectors to quickly switch from Polygon to Ethereum, the NFT project is generously covering all gas fees for first movers within the first 24 hours of viability.\n\nFurther incentivizing early adoption, 10 y00ts NFTs will randomly be distributed to wallets that switch chains within the first day. Notably, such assets have a floor price of approximately $1225 (0.775 ETH), as per OpenSea.\n\nAdditionally \u2014 boosting y00ts holders to act promptly in the next week \u2014 the NFT project is imposing a royalty fee of 33.3% starting October 22.\n\nTech Boosts and Imminent Upgrades\n\ny00ts partnered with Wormhole Crypto\u2019s cross-chain NFT standard to ease this transition, offering a safe and effective process for holders. Moreover, users can access all verified y00ts links with ease through Phantom shortcuts, including the popular bridge link.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s important to note that Ethereum validation can take up to an hour before minting, with a 30 y00ts migration limit per user. The waiting room advises users to \u201cjust chill\u201d, stating the \u201cy00ts are in transit. You can leave this page and come back later.\u201d In comparison, minting on Polygon is much swifter, validating such transactions within just seconds. System enhancements regarding this setback are in the works.\n\nAnother critical differentiation to be aware of is that y00tpoints will operate exclusively on the Ethereum network. Staking y00ts on ETH is not necessary; just holding them in a wallet is sufficient enough.\n\ny00ts\u2019 dedication to becoming the leading cross-chain NFT community is becoming a reality, with the goal of scaling up through Bitcoin after the Polygon and Ethereum transfer fulfillment. The overarching target of y00ts\u2019 creators, Dust Labs, is to cultivate a diverse and thriving NFT ecosystem \u2014 one of which is readily available across a multitude of blockchain networks.\n\nWant more?

        "content": "On-chain data shows that FTX liquidators staked much of their Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) holdings over the weekend.\n\n$30M in Ethereum staked.\n\nPer Etherscan data, the bankrupt crypto exchange staked around $30 million worth of ETH, approximately more than 24,000 ETH, on Oct. 14.\n\nProminent blockchain analytical firm 0xScope confirmed that the exchange was staking its assets. It noted that a wallet associated with the FTX liquidators staked 4416 ETH valued at around $6.85 million via Figment, an institutional-focused staking service provider.\n\nStaking is a process that involves committing crypto assets to support a blockchain network for a set period to earn rewards. According to Figment\u2019s website, its average Staking Rewards Rate (SRR) throughout the third quarter was 4.5%.\n\nMeanwhile, the Ethereum website pegs the reward rate at 3.4% annually.\n\nOver $120M staked in Solana.\n\nLiquidators of the bankrupt firm also staked 5.5 million Solana tokens, valued at around $121 million, via Figment.\n\nThis move would allow FTX to earn a rewards rate of nearly 7%, according to Figment\u2019s website.\n\nFTX was one of the major investors in the Solana blockchain, with court filings revealing that the exchange held more than $1 billion worth of SOL tokens. The exchange also had substantial holdings in other digital assets like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum, etc.\n\nIn September, FTX sought court approval to allow it to liquidate up to $100 million worth of digital assets weekly, with the ability to increase the limit to $200 million temporarily.\n\nMeanwhile, this move comes amid the ongoing criminal trial of the founder of the defunct exchange, Sam Bankman-Fried, in a New York court.\n\nThe trial has unveiled SBF\u2019s alleged involvement in mishandling FTX customers\u2019 funds. Key insiders, including Gary Wang, co-founder of FTX, and Caroline Ellison, former CEO of Alameda, testified that Alameda enjoyed special privileges at the now-defunct exchange, with SBF allegedly responsible for establishing systems that enabled fraudulent activities."

        "title": "Payments shouldn't be handled on the Ethereum and Bitcoin networks | Opinion - crypto.news",
        "content": "Disclosure: The views and opinions expressed here belong solely to the author and do not represent the views and opinions of crypto.news\u2019 editorial.\n\nCrypto companies are currently making payments entirely wrong because they are not accounting for the most important people: the end consumers. Earlier this year, it was reported that cryptocurrency investors were facing delays concerning withdrawing funds deposited on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nThis was following its significant software upgrade, and it created persistent headaches for Ethereum, a platform, which aims to have its technology widely used for instant transactions. This resulted in ether worth around $1.4 billion being stuck in a withdrawal queue. The delays were a prime example of the limits in the transactions that Ethereum could process.\n\nYou might also like: Investing in crypto: guide to smarter portfolio rebalancing\n\nThis highlighted its potential shortcomings in terms of becoming a widely-used financial infrastructure. While Ethereum has grown popular within the crypto market, it has yet to be used in mainstream payments, commerce, and finance. Despite these challenges and issues, Ethereum holds a superior position, and users continue to stand by it.\n\nThe reason for this is that it is fairly decentralized, which is key for preventing a chain from being hijacked by those validating it and for network security. It is the most decentralized smart contract blockchain within the crypto world. Ethereum offers a low barrier to entry in that anyone with the ability to set up a miner can validate transactions on the network with its proof-of-work (PoW) consensus model.\n\nThis model also requires computational input to approve the transactions, which dislocates control from the network to control over supply. Bitcoin, on the other hand, has gained acceptance as a payment method for businesses across the globe. However, the volatility of it remains a barrier for others embracing payments on Bitcoin networks.\n\nHandling payments on Bitcoin networks may offer some advantages, like the potential for increased profits. However, its value drop can cause serious losses for users, occasionally exceeding the profit from the transaction. The volatility of Bitcoin\u2019s value and the anonymity increase the risk of fraud. When transactions are verified within the Bitcoin network, each node within the decentralized system has to verify every transaction.\n\nAdditionally, the network can only process a specific number of transactions within a certain timeframe, such as a block. International payments through stablecoins on blockchain networks could provide an improved experience over traditional fiat transactions because they offer increased speed.\n\nUser experience and crypto wold\n\nIn saying that, the overall UX for crypto transactions still lacks integration with existing systems and accessibility. We are far away from having consumer-ready crypto products regular people can use effectively. The UX is obscene, and the steps to make crypto payments are exponentially more than fiat ones.\n\nUX\u2019s problems range from underlying flaws in the architecture to problems with business models and basic UI design issues. UIs are horrible, UX is obscene, and the steps to make crypto payments are exponentially more than fiat ones. Poor UX is everywhere in the crypto world, and the consequences of this are users losing significant amounts of money, but also woefully insufficient levels of security, and sub-optimal user adoption.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges facing transactions on these networks is their limited transaction processing capabilities. This leads to high fees and slow transaction times, which can certainly be barriers to wider adoption. Automatic payments are not really what\u2019s important here. What is important is understanding all the minor things that make up for an excellent experience and seamless payments.\n\nWithout this, crypto payments will not have a future at all. Bitcoin has experimented with some scaling up, such as the Lightning Network, a layer-2 solution built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. Its primary goal is to address Bitcoin\u2019s scalability issues, allowing for cheaper and faster transactions by enabling off-chain transactions via a network of payment channels.\n\nThe mainstream adoption?\n\nThe Lightning Network was launched in 2018 and hit a total value of $140 million. This network is growing, although there are still challenges that hinder its mainstream adoption. Therefore, it is uncertain whether it is the right solution for improving payments on Bitcoin networks. It is, after all, still an experimental technology. Despite the challenges facing Bitcoin as a payment method, it continues to be embraced as a viable alternative to traditional payment methods.\n\nThis only further reinforces the need for users to take an informative yet cautious approach. The future of payments on these networks will depend on their ability to address the current challenges of transaction processing, fraud, volatility, and the user experience whilst still ensuring advantages such as the potential for profit and anonymity.\n\nWhen it comes to Ethereum, the ecosystem is growing due to the surging popularity of its dApps in areas like gaming, finance, and technology. However, although it may seem like a perfect platform to the naked eye, it has considerable issues that must be addressed. These issues surround accessibility and scalability.\n\nAddressing these problems will ensure widespread adoption, but there is no doubt that this network is faced with many challenges. As time goes on, if these issues are not solved, it is difficult to predict whether Ethereum will be able to compete with its competitors. Investing in Ethereum comes with some disadvantages. Scalability is a problem, but there are also issues with its code and its supply.\n\nUltimately, Ethereum often has long transaction times and high gas fees. While Bitcoin is a decentralized currency, and this is generally a benefit, it can also be viewed as a disadvantage since it means Bitcoin is not regulated. It is not like with traditional currencies where they are regulated by central banks.\n\nThese kinds of transactions do not arrive with any legal protection and are irreversible. Due to its decentralized nature, there is also no guarantee of a minimum valuation. If investors decide to stop using them and sell them, their value can decrease significantly and impact users with a vast amount of cryptocurrency.\n\nTo support the worldwide adoption of cryptocurrencies for everyday transactions, we desperately need a network that demonstrates its capabilities to handle a certain amount of transactions without delays or processing issues. The network must also offer credibility that it can handle the growing amount of transactions in the future. In essence, these networks must be scaled up. The transaction capabilities of networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum are still quite low, and the demand to carry out these transactions will only grow.\n\nDaniele Servadei Daniele Servadei is a 20-year-old Italian entrepreneur on a mission to transform online payments and ecommerce.

        "content": "Qadir Ak is the founder of Coinpedia. He has over a decade of experience writing about technology and has been covering the blockchain and cryptocurrency space since 2010. He has also interviewed a few prominent experts within the cryptocurrency space.\n\nStory Highlights Ethereum staking interest has paused, with staking yields dropping from 5% to 3.5%.\n\nOther network metrics, such as mainnet activity and roll-up transactions, remain steady.\n\nThe Dencun upgrade in the first half of 2024 could renew interest in Ethereum staking.\n\nCoinbase\u2019s recent report points to a significant change in the world of cryptocurrency. It reveals a pause in investor interest in Ethereum staking, marking the first time since the Shanghai upgrade in May. This shift, alongside staking yields dropping from 5% to 3.5%, hints at a potential turning point for the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector.\n\nThe Shanghai Upgrade\n\nThe Shanghai upgrade of Ethereum, introduced in May, was a big deal because it allowed people to withdraw their staked ether for the first time. Validators, the folks who keep Ethereum running, were eagerly participating in staking, locking up their ether to earn rewards. But the enthusiasm has dwindled. The validator queue is now empty, and staking rewards have taken a nosedive, changing the balance of risk and reward.\n\n\u201cStaking yields provide a floor for the crypto ecosystem,\u201d analysts David Duong and David Han stated. \u201cIt serves as a benchmark for alternative crypto investments.\u201d\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum\u2019s Shanghai Upgrade Falls Short of Expectations, JP Morgan Report Reveals\n\nBeyond Staking: Ethereum Network Metrics\n\nWhile the excitement around staking cools down, other network metrics tell a different story. Ethereum\u2019s mainnet activity has remained steady throughout the third quarter, and the total roll-up transactions have increased. These rollups, which bundle transactions processed off the mainnet, show that Ethereum\u2019s ability to handle more transactions is still improving.\n\nIt\u2019s not just the crypto world facing uncertainty; the global economy might be in for some changes too. Concerns about rising bond yields and Federal Reserve policies are diminishing. Some predict that the United States might go through a recession in the first half of 2024 due to high interest rates and lower returns from government spending. This possible economic downturn could have significant effects on the crypto market, causing shifts in where investors put their money.\n\nDencun Upgrade: A Ray of Hope?\n\nSet for the first half of 2024, the Dencun upgrade is seen as the next big event for Ethereum. It introduces five Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) designed to increase storage capacity and reduce fees, which raises hopes for renewed interest in Ethereum staking.\n\nWhat we\u2019re seeing here seems to be a phase of consolidation and growth for the Ethereum network. According to the Coinbase report, unless major changes or security breaches occur, staking rewards are expected to remain relatively stable."

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nEthereum gas fees slump to new lows, offering the network a chance to prove its ultrasound money narrative.\n\nGas fees crashed to 7.941 Gwei for the first time since 2020, with analysts pointing to several reasons.\n\nAmid the slump in gas prices, ETH embarked on a small rally to trade above the $1,500 mark.\n\nAfter years of sky-high gas fees, the Ethereum (ETH) network has completed a turnaround after recording its lowest transaction fees for the first time in over three years.\n\nOn Oct. 14, Ethereum\u2019s average gas price stood at 7.941 Gwei, a figure that got the entire community beaming with pride. The last time Ethereum\u2019s gas fees recorded a similar figure was in April 2020, surging by over 100% alongside the rush of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and decentralized finance (DeFi).\n\nExactly a year ago, the figure stood at 19.68 Gwei, leaving pundits with dwindling hopes for a reduction in transaction fees. Right off the bat, several contributory factors exist for the plummeting gas fees, including the decline of NFTs and the significant reduction in DeFi activities.\n\nAt the height of their powers, digital collectibles and DeFi yield farming made up a large chunk of transactions that clogged the Ethereum network, sending gas prices to astronomic levels. Speculative trading activity is another reason for the decline in gas fees, given the extended bear market and sideways trading of the asset class.\n\nAnother theory for the dwindling values of gas fees is the adoption of new layer 2 networks designed to improve Ethereum\u2019s scalability. Pundits have described the rise of Polygon, Optimism, and Arbitrum as relieving a chunk of the pressure from the layer 2 network while mulling the possibilities of even lower gas fees.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to on-chain analysts, the new trend may make ETH inflationary, bringing its claim of being ultrasound money under greater scrutiny.\n\n\u201cThe low fee regime represents a major transition for Ethereum, trading off high revenues and deflationary supply for the promise to be able to attract mainstream users through layer 2s,\u201d said Lucas Outumuro, IntoTheBlock\u2019s head of research.\n\nEyes on the $1,700 mark\n\nDespite a choppy start to life that saw ETH fall to $1,500 in October, bulls remain optimistic that the asset can ride the wave of low gas fees to recapture the $1,700 mark. Bulls are hinging their belief on a neutral stance to the bearish sentiment in the markets as they hope for stronger buying pressures at present levels.\n\nIn the last 2 hours, ETH has gained nearly 2% while trading volumes recorded a 5% jump over the last day. In other markets, Bitcoin (BTC) currently trades at $28K, with several altcoins riding the wave of the largest cryptocurrency to record small wins."

        "content": "NEW YORK & HONG KONG--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Scroll, an open-source, community-first Ethereum scaling solution, today announced the launch of its mainnet, marking a significant milestone in the movement to scale and drive adoption to the world\u2019s largest smart contract platform and first programmable blockchain.\n\nThe launch arrives at the culmination of two years of intensive development and rigorous testing, during which zero knowledge (zk) proofs were employed to compress computation off the primary blockchain. As Ethereum attracts more users and projects, this increased traffic can slow down the network and raise costs. ZK proofs enable an innovative approach that substantially enhances transaction throughput with accelerated transaction speeds and reduced costs, signifying a monumental shift in Ethereum\u2019s scaling capabilities.\n\nScroll\u2019s unique bytecode-level Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible zkEVM offers a virtually identical experience to Ethereum, empowering developers to essentially copy, paste, and deploy their existing Ethereum projects onto Scroll as-is, with no required changes to the codebase. The development is a testament to Scroll\u2019s commitment to scale Ethereum without compromising security or decentralization.\n\n\u201cAt Scroll, we take security extremely seriously,\u201d said Haichen Shen, co-founder of Scroll. \u201cScroll approaches security holistically, maintaining a dedicated internal security team, fully auditing our codebase with numerous audit firms, and remaining open-source, which we have been since day one.\u201d\n\nScroll\u2019s mainnet launch comes after over a year of successful testnets, seeing over 55 million transactions on Alpha and Beta testnets and nearly a million batches finalized to L1. Sepolia, the most recent testnet, in two months saw over 900K wallet addresses and over six million transactions. Over 100 projects have deployed on Scroll testnets to date, spanning from infrastructure to DeFi to gaming and beyond. Scroll\u2019s mainnet operates exactly like its Sepolia testnet, which will continue to operate as a staging environment for developers.\n\nOn the Scroll mainnet, users and developers have the same experience as they would on Ethereum, powered by zero knowledge cryptography. Scroll\u2019s mainnet will first focus on onboarding infrastructure providers, followed by rolling deployments that will empower developers across the globe to start building Web3 products and ultimately drive new users into the Ethereum community.\n\n\u201cWe see a future where the vast majority of value transfer takes place on L2s on Ethereum. What will drive that adoption is improved user and developer experience,\u201d said Sandy Peng, co-founder of Scroll. \u201cWe focus on enabling developers to build blockchain applications that will anchor web3 in real world use cases, attracting new users en masse, and moving everyone forward.\u201d\n\nScroll was established in 2021 with the mission to build an open-source, scalable ecosystem leveraging the native capabilities of a zkEVM, while maintaining Ethereum\u2019s well-known security capabilities and upholding the community\u2019s commitment to decentralization. To advance this commitment, the next milestones on Scroll\u2019s roadmap are a decentralized prover network and decentralized sequencer.\n\nFor the past two and a half years, Scroll has collaborated with the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s Privacy and Scaling Explorations (PSE) group to contribute approximately 50 percent of the upstream PSE zkEVM codebase. From its inception, Scroll has been building an open-source, peer-reviewed, and permissionless project, and the team continuously publishes research to advance understanding of the inner workings of ZK circuits, cryptography, and hardware acceleration.\n\nVisit scroll.io for more information.\n\nAbout Scroll\n\nScroll is a zero knowledge scaling solution for Ethereum with lower costs, faster speeds, and infinite scaling, without sacrificing security or decentralization. With bytecode-level compatibility, building on Scroll is nearly identical to building on Ethereum. Scroll has been community-focused and open-source since day one. With its zkEVM, Scroll unlocks the power of Web3 with the same security as the Ethereum blockchain. To learn more, visit: scroll.io."

        "content": "The validator queue on Ethereum has dropped to a record low.\n\nStaking APY has continued to decline in the past few months.\n\nThe Ethereum network [ETH] validator queue has emptied for the first time since the network\u2019s transition to the proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism in September 2022, according to data from Validator Queues.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s ETH\u2019s market cap in BTC\u2019s terms\n\nThis development means that there is no longer a waiting period for validators to begin staking their ETH.\n\nThe validator queue tracks the count of validators who have deposited their ETH but are waiting to be assigned to a shard or segment of the Ethereum network. Once assigned to a shard, validators can begin verifying transactions and earning rewards.\n\nThe depletion of the validator queue on the network represents a notable milestone because during the summer, for example, prospective validators had to wait for up to 45 days to join the network.\n\nWith an entry queue value of zero for the first time since Ethereum transitioned, the current demand for staking ETH has been satisfied, with 23% of ETH\u2019s supply being staked and a staking annual percentage yield (APY) of 3.3%.\n\nState of staking on the Ethereum network\n\nEarlier this month, Ethereum\u2019s Churn Limit increased from 12 to 13. In the context of Ethereum, the churn limit refers to the maximum number of validators that can join or leave the network during a single epoch, which is a period of about 6.4 minutes.\n\nThe increase in the activation and exit limits per epoch means that Ethereum can now process new and exiting validators daily.\n\nIn a recent post on X, crypto analyst Tom Wan noted that the increase in Churn Rate \u201cmeans the network can take in 93.6k new ETH deposits per day without requiring new validators to queue for more than > 1 day.\u201d\n\nUpdate on Ethereum Staking 1. The Churn Limit has Increased to 13 per Epoch\n\nThe number of validators on Ethereum reached 854k on 10 Oct. As a result, the activation limit and exit limit per epoch have increased from 12 to 13, which means ~2,925 validators can exit or withdraw\u2026 https://t.co/QuHsocmlBz pic.twitter.com/nxb2iBD3HA \u2014 Tom Wan (@tomwanhh) October 13, 2023\n\nWhile the cleared validation queue means new validators can now begin staking their coins immediately without waiting, it signals weakened demand for Ether staking.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nAccording to data from Glassnode, the daily amount of new ETH staked assessed on a 30-day moving average has declined by 22% in the last three months.\n\nMoreover, staking rewards have also dropped significantly in the past few months. Information retrieved from The Block Data showed that rewards earned by validators for locking up their Ether coins have dropped by 62% since May. At press time, staking APY was 3.3%."

Discover SCENE\n\nFTX's bankruptcy estate staked roughly $122 million in Solana (SOL) tokens held in the firm's crypto wallets.\n\nThe transaction was tracked through on-chain data when an FTX-identified wallet transferred the tokens to Figment, a staking validator firm catering to institutional investors.\n\nAround the same time early on Saturday, the FTX estate also staked a total of 3,200 Ethereum (ETH) worth roughly $5 million, on-chain data shows.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA Nansen spokesperson told Decrypt that both crypto wallets are Alameda Research wallets, FTX's sister trading firm.\n\nStaking in the world of cryptocurrencies refers to the process of locking up a specific amount of tokens for a predetermined period. In return, holders who participate in staking receive rewards in the form of additional coins. This process plays a vital role in securing proof-of-stake (PoS) networks, such as Ethereum and Solana.\n\nIn August, the FTX\u2019s current leadership helmed by John J.

        "content": "TL;DR\n\nFerrari, the Italian luxury car manufacturer, is now accepting cryptocurrency payments, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and USD Coin (USDC) for its products.\n\nThe decision to accept cryptocurrencies came in response to requests from clients and dealers, including both traditional investors and young cryptocurrency investors.\n\nFerrari has partnered with BitPay as the payment processor, and this move is seen as a positive development for cryptocurrency adoption, although it may not significantly impact the market during bearish periods.\n\nItalian Luxury Car Maker Adopts BTC, ETH, & USDC.\n\nGalliera said many of Ferarri\u2019s clients are invested in cryptocurrencies. As a result, the company decided to accept crypto payments after a number of requests from clients and dealers:\n\n\u201cSome are young investors who have built their fortunes around cryptocurrencies. Some others are more traditional investors, who want to diversify their portfolios.\u201d\n\nMoreover, he said the company is hoping to expand its customer base by accepting crypto:\n\n\u201cThis will help us connect to people who are not necessarily our clients but might afford a Ferrari.\u201d\n\nGalliera assured customers looking to part with their crypto for a Ferarri that they will not have to pay more to use cryptocurrency for their purchase:\n\n\u201cPrices will not change, no fees, no surcharges if you pay through cryptocurrencies.\u201d\n\nFerrari is partnering with BitPay as the payment processor to make this happen. Holders of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and USDC will have the option to spend their tokens on the Italian luxury vehicle.\n\nOf course, purchases will still have to conform to local laws in buyers\u2019 legal jurisdictions. Not long ago, in 2021, a Frenchman got an 18-month jail sentence in Morocco for buying a Ferrari with $440,000 worth of Bitcoin.\n\nFerarri Brand Synergies with Cryptocurrency\n\nThis isn\u2019t the Italian car brand\u2019s first dust-up with crypto. In 2021, Ferrari partnered with Swiss tech firm Velas Network AG to bring NFTs to its fans.\n\nFerarri\u2019s brand reputation aligns well with blockchain. The carmaker is committed to innovation, performance, speed, and community. The most trusted and reliable cryptocurrencies share that same commitment.\n\nHigh finance legacy investor Bill Miller even compared Bitcoin to Ferrari in 2021, meanwhile comparing gold to a horse and buggy.\n\nThere\u2019s no telling for sure exactly how many new purchases Ferrari will transact using crypto. Many Bitcoin and Ether investors prefer to hold.\n\nCrypto investor Scott Melker, who goes by the moniker \u201cThe Wolf of All Streets\u201d on Twitter, pointed out investors will not likely part with their tokens during the bear market:\n\n\u201cMy take: great news for adoption, but unlikely to move the needle. When Tesla accepted bitcoin in 2021 it was viewed as huge news, but few people took advantage of the opportunity\u2026 Cool move by Ferrari, but unimportant for the market during the bear.\u201d\n\nOverall, this is bullish news for cryptocurrency. It\u2019s more earned media coverage, more social and market proof, and more ways for holders to use their crypto tokens. The fact that people won\u2019t likely part with their Bitcoin and Ether shows just how bullish crypto investors are for their holdings over the long term."

The\u00ad performance and potential of Scroll\u2019s te\u00adstnets have bee\u00adn demonstrated through the de\u00adployment of over 450K smart contracts, processing more\u00ad than 90 million transactions, and generating 280K ZK proofs.\n\nSandy Peng, co-founde\u00adr of Scroll, emphasizes their goal to e\u00adnhance user and deve\u00adloper experie\u00adnces while driving the adoption of layer 2 solutions on Ethe\u00adreum.\n\n\u201cThe significance of zkEVM to developers lies in its ability to batch proofs in a highly efficient manner, offering faster transaction speeds at reduced costs. A key element in this process is bytecode-level compatibility,\u201d said Peng.\n\nSGX-Based Prover for Scroll Upgrade\n\nThe Scroll team is developing an SGX-based se\u00adcond prover to enable a functioning Multi-Prove\u00adr on Scroll.\n\n\u201cWe have been working on an SGX-based second prover with an external team of TEE experts for more than 6 months, which will soon enable us to have a functioning Multi-Prover deployed on Scroll,\u201d said Peng.\n\nThe team is currently in the rese\u00adarch phase for their dece\u00adntralized prover network and se\u00adquencer. They are\u00ad working on an upgrade to the protocol, aiming to enable\u00ad forced batches that ensure\u00ad uninterrupted operation e\u00adven if the seque\u00adncer goes offline.\n\nA Community-Driven Network\n\nScroll is built on the values of community empowerment, inclusivity, and openne\u00adss. Through a range of global develope\u00adr engagement activitie\u00ads, workshops, and ZK research education initiative\u00ads, the network has fostere\u00add connections with individuals worldwide.\n\nOperating across 26 diffe\u00adrent countries, Scroll\u2019s distributed te\u00adam encourages collaboration and interaction within local communities. Re\u00adnowned as one of Ethere\u00adum\u2019s most significant zkEVM networks, Scroll offers a solution that closely re\u00adsembles Ethere\u00adum with enhanced features and benefits.\n\nRead Also: Shibarium: Shiba Inu\u2019s Layer 2 Blockchain On Ethereum\n\nThe\u00ad launch of its mainnet signifies a groundbreaking mile\u00adstone for both Scroll and Ethereum, bringing in a new era of scalability and exciting progress."

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nVeteran trader Peter Brandt put his X followers to the test on classical charting principles. Brandt posted an ETH chart that highlighted a pattern. He proceeded to ask his followers if the highlighted pattern was a rising wedge and, if not, what would need to happen to make it a wedge.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor context's sake, a rising wedge is a chart pattern used in technical analysis to predict a likely bearish reversal. It is depicted by a narrowing price range with higher highs and higher lows, both of which are enclosed by upward-sloping trendlines.\n\nThe question posed by the veteran trader does not seem not far-fetched, given that other chart patterns resemble the rising wedge pattern, both in structure and in trading strategies.\n\nThe falling wedge, ascending and descending triangles, symmetrical triangles, flags and pennants are examples.\n\nAn X user responded to Brandt's question by stating that the price action would need to touch the upper trendline a third time for the pattern to meet the definition of a wedge.\n\nBrandt agreed that a third upper contact point would be required for the wedge to properly form while adding that, more than likely, the pattern presented on the ETH chart might morph into something else.\n\nEthereum price action\n\nEthereum experienced declines in the past week, reaching a seven-month low at $1,520. The downward price movement coincided with Ethereum's total transaction fees declining to their lowest levels in years.\n\nAccording to on-chain analytics firm IntoTheBlock, total Ethereum fees hit their lowest point since April 2020. This decrease could be attributed to the migration to Layer 2 and the decreasing usage of applications on the mainnet.\n\nIn another tweet, IntoTheBlock noted that Ethereum's supply has been rising for the first time since December 2022, with the low transaction fees and increasing daily issuance contributing to this inflationary trend.\n\nAt the time of writing, ETH had slightly rebounded and was up 1.89% in the last 24 hours to $1,585."

        "content": "Bitcoin and other crypto tokens were trading with decent gains in the early week on Monday in Asia as the way cleared for the Bitcoin ETF in the US. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will not appeal the court\u2019s scathing reversal of its decision not to let Grayscale convert its bitcoin trust into an exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\n\n\nBitcoin jumped more than a per cent as the last crypto token managed to regain the 27,000-levels. However, its largest peer, Ethereum, was also in green but inched up only half-a-per cent to hold above $1,550-level. Altcoins were also trading with decent gains in the early morning.\n\n\n\nBitcoin has been trading approximately around the $27,000 level following the SEC's decision not to challenge a recent court ruling that favored Grayscale Investments. The court's verdict requires the SEC to undertake a review of Grayscale's ETF application, said Edul Patel, Co-Founder & CEO at Mudrex.\n\n\n\n\"Market participants are now cautiously hopeful for potential approval of Bitcoin's spot ETF applications by the SEC, resulting in a slightly positive sentiment. Bitcoin will now need to break through the $27,400 mark or find support around $26,900. Meanwhile, Ethereum continues to trade around $1,500,\" he said.\n\n\n\nBarring a few exceptions, the majority of top crypto tokens were trading higher on Monday. Tron and BNB gained 2 per cent each, while Chainlink jumped more than a per cent each. Solana and Litecoin were among the other key gainers in the morning. On the contrary, Polygon and Dogecoin were among the key gainers for the day.\n\n\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market cap was trading significantly higher, jumping to $1.06 trillion-mark, as it declined about one per cent in the last 24 hours. However, the total trading volumes surged as much as 38 per cent to $19.4 billion.\n\n\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum both showed positive gains over the weekend, driven by the news that the SEC won't appeal the court decision regarding Grayscale's spot Bitcoin ETF application. This news has sparked the interest of investors, as it raises the likelihood of a Bitcoin spot ETF approval by the end of the first quarter of 2024, said CoinDCX Research Team.\n\n\n\n\"The positive development of Ferrari, a luxury sports car company, accepting cryptocurrency as payment for its cars in the US and soon in Europe, has contributed to this positive sentiment,\" it added.\n\n\n\nImage: Crypto-chart-price\n\n\n\nTech View by Giottus Crypto Platform\n\nSolana (SOL) isin anascending trend with the asset trading above its 50-day simple moving average ($20.5).After recording short-term gains earlier this month, the asset is trying to regain momentum past two weeks of negative price action.

        "content": "In a surprising turn of events, Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin has made significant moves on the crypto market, depositing millions of USDC into major exchanges, sparking speculation about his strategic intentions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLookonchain reports that Buterin's address, vitalik.eth, received a staggering 14.93 million USDC from Kanro merely four days ago, promptly depositing it into Gemini just before the first surge of Bitcoin.\n\nButerin's actions intensified when he deposited an additional 500,000 USDC into Coinbase merely two days ago, adding to the intrigue surrounding his motives. This comes after months of speculation, as Buterin previously deposited his ETH holdings on various exchanges, a move interpreted as a bearish signal by the crypto community.\n\nThe recent actions, however, paint a different picture. It appears that the Ethereum founder has shifted gears, opting to stockpile stablecoins instead of tokens, leading to speculations about his newfound bullish sentiment.\n\nThis twist in Buterin's investment strategy seems particularly astute, as it coincided with a momentous surge in the crypto market. Bitcoin, for instance, shot up by over 13%, while Ethereum witnessed a 5% increase.\n\nNonetheless, the veil of secrecy surrounding Buterin's intentions remains intact, as tracking further fund movements on his exchange accounts remains impossible. Until the enigmatic Ethereum founder unveils his next move, the crypto community is left to ponder: what is his endgame?"

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nOrbs (ORBS), an Ethereum challenger, is on a parabolic run, with its price up by more than 60% in what can be classified as one of its biggest trading days in months. The coin is changing hands at a price of $0.05746 but with a 289% jump in its trading volume with over $648 million traded overnight.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe hype around ORBS is centered on the prospects behind the coin's listing on the OKX trading platform. Huobi made the announcement on its X handle, noting that the perpetual swap feature for the ORBS/USDT pair is now live.\n\nThe exchange announced that users can now gain access to 20X leverage, with additional ORBS-focused products, including margin trading and savings, also billed for a later launch. ORBS is one of the hardest-hit tokens in the past crypto winter. The coin is still down by over 84% from its all-time high (ATH) attained about three years ago.\n\nThe current upshot is a testament to the optimism within its ecosystem and the desire to help chart a revival in usage and, in the long run, in the trading price of the ORB.\n\nMid-cap tokens pulling their weight\n\nWhile the most important hype in the market revolves around Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), XRP and Cardano (ADA), to mention a few, many low-cap and mid-cap altcoins are also charting revolutionary trends within their own ecosystem.\n\nWhile Orbs is aiming at driving scalability and usability to rival Ethereum, projects like Bad Idea AI (BAD) are redefining AI-based capabilities within the Shibarium Layer-2 protocol. Other altcoins like Fantom (FTM), Chainlink (LINK) and Optimism (OP) are also arguably helping to drive the overall goal of broadening the acceptability of the broader digital currency and blockchain ecosystems.\n\nWith related support through listings such as OKX, accomplishing this mission becomes easier for these asset classes."

        "content": "InQubeta (QUBE) has the potential to be one of the top crypto coins in a couple of years thanks to the imaginative way the platform makes it simpler than it has ever been to invest in artificial intelligence (AI) startups. Its presale has already raised over $3.5 million, and the event isn\u2019t even at its halfway mark yet.\n\nEthereum (ETH) is another altcoin to watch as prices have dropped 17% in the past six months and trading fees are as low as they\u2019ve been in over a year. Historically, low trading fees have preceded bull runs as more users jump on its network to transfer assets.\n\nThe InQubeta project is deployed on the Ethereum network, benefiting from the mainnet\u2019s functionality and security. The project can play a considerable role as the AI revolution unfolds.\n\nInQubeta is among the top crypto altcoins to watch\n\nInvesting in AI can be challenging for many people as mainstream investment avenues often have strict requirements that disqualify them from using their services. InQubeta, on the other hand, provides an alternative way to invest in artificial intelligence. By freeing the flow of capital to AI startups, their platform facilitates the advancement of technology. This enables individuals without access to traditional investment avenues to invest in AI and reap the benefits of such investments.\n\nThe potential of artificial intelligence (AI) has grown exponentially over the past few years as many futuristic concepts are becoming a reality. Self-driving taxis are now operating in cities like San Francisco, and Tesla\u2019s Optimus humanoid robot is getting closer to becoming a reality.\n\nYou might also like: Sui Network hiccup leads to Cosmos dip, InQubeta role in defi highlighted in presale\n\nAs AI technology evolves, it\u2019s on track to become the next major technological breakthrough. While AI will undoubtedly disrupt many industries as tasks that humans once performed become automated, it will also create opportunities for investors to earn substantial returns. Investing in AI today can also protect investors against the uncertainty that the technology will inevitably cause.\n\nInvesting in the InQubeta network can be an opportunity. Startups now offer investment opportunities in non-fungible tokens (NFTs). InQubeta\u2019s NFT team reviews these tokens before adding them to the marketplace. Investors can buy QUBE using top cryptocurrencies or fiat and use it to purchase items on the NFT marketplace. Notably, investors have complete control of their NFTs and can track their value in their InQubeta accounts. Tokens can be traded on the marketplace at any time.\n\nEthereum\u2019s low fees might be a sign of an incoming bull run\n\nCrypto prices are tracking lower after surging earlier. According to the analytics firm Santiment, the average gas fee on Ethereum over the past week was $1.13, the lowest average since November 2022.\n\nYou might also like: Ethereum Foundation sold 1,700 ETH for USDC\n\nLower gas fees usually lead to more network demand, which, in turn, drives ETH prices higher. The last time gas fees were this low, prices soared weeks later.\n\nHowever, current market metrics suggest a different story, with the relative strength index at 39 and the simple moving average at 1647, indicating that selling might be the more sensible option.\n\nSummary\n\nInQubeta and its native token, QUBE, aim to ease investment in AI. The platform provides an alternative to traditional investment firms. It\u2019s expected to help guide the $1.5 trillion that\u2019s likely to be invested in AI in the coming years.\n\nOn the other hand, ETH could also see growth as transaction fees are currently at their lowest in a year. Even though prices might recover, it might struggle to keep up with QUBE, a token analysts expect to rally after launching.\n\nVisit InQubeta presale\n\nJoin the InQubeta communities\n\nDisclosure: This content is provided by a third party. crypto.news does not endorse any product mentioned on this page.

        "content": "The notorious address tied to the Uranium Finance hack of 2021 has been caught in another financial movement, transferring $3.1 million from BNB Chain to Ethereum (ETH).\n\nThe primary adddess linked to the Uranium Finance hack of April 2021 has again moved another batch of funds, bridging $3.1 million in BUSD from BNB Chain to Ethereum and laundering $1.89 million to Tornado Cash.\n\nLeading blockchain security company Peck Shield first called attention to today\u2019s latest movement. Peck Shield\u2019s disclosure came when the exploiter had moved just $10,000 worth of BUSD to the Ethereum network using Stargate, a cross-chain bridging protocol.\n\nFollowing the alert from Peck Shield, the exploiter has moved more BUSD tokens to Ethereum. They bridged 500,000 BUSD in six separate transactions and 100,000 BUSD in one transaction, amounting to 3.1 million BUSD.\n\nYou might also like: IMF: Global economic stability at risk amid Israel-Hamas conflict\n\nThe recent transactions, which occurred today over one hour, have raised speculation among crypto proponents. After the transfers, the exploiter\u2019s address on the BNB Chain now holds over $15 million in BUSD and Wrapped BNB (WBNB).\n\nSpecifically, the address currently holds $10.29 million worth of BUSD and 22,185 WBNB valued at $4.73 million. Moreover, at the reporting time, their address on the Ethereum network boasts 824 Ether (ETH) worth $1.3 million, $12,980 worth of USDC and $12,487 worth of USDT.\n\nInterestingly, shortly after bridging the 3.1 million BUSD to the Ethereum network, the hacker moved 1,200 ETH (worth $1.89 million) to crypto mixing resource Tornado Cash. These ETH tokens were transferred over 12 transactions of 100 ETH each, between 7:32 AM and 8:09 AM (UTC) today.\n\nPrevious movements\n\nThe latest flow of funds comes 61 days after the address laundered 1,100 ETH through Tornado Cash in August. Interestingly, the exploiter had also moved 530 ETH to Tornado Cash in July, 670 ETH in June, and 650 ETH in May.\n\nThese transactions have followed a similar pattern throughout this year. Notably, the first batch of transfers occurred in March, as the exploiter leveraged a different address to move 2,250 ETH (worth $3.35 million at the time) to Tornado Cash.\n\nThe first batch of transactions came nearly two years after Uranium Finance fell victim to the hack. Recall that the exploiter drained $50 million of crypto assets from the protocol in April 2021. The hacker exploited a vulnerability in the Uranium Finance pair contracts.\n\nRead more: SEC nixes plans to appeal Grayscale Bitcoin ETF decision\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nIn a recent YouTube stream, Charles Hoskinson, the founder of Cardano, addressed persistent conspiracies within the XRP community related to Ethereum's purported influence over the SEC.\n\nA growing section of the vociferous crypto community has speculated that Ethereum backers may have had a role in the SEC's decision to pursue action against XRP. This implies a potential bias in the regulatory body's decision-making process. Hoskinson's comments aimed to provide clarity on the matter.\n\nFacts over conspiracy theories\n\nHoskinson began by emphasizing the importance of distinguishing between two primary concerns. Firstly, whether Ethereum received preferential treatment from the SEC, and secondly, whether individuals or entities associated with Ethereum might have lobbied or influenced the SEC's decision to take action against XRP.\n\nHe stressed that these are separate issues, with different implications, and should be treated as such. He urged the community to base their judgments on facts and evidence rather than conjecture.\n\nAddressing his stance, Hoskinson explicitly mentioned that he does not condone corruption and disapproves of any attempts to unduly influence government policy. At the same time, the cryptocurrency mogul has stressed that there is no evidence, such as texts, photos, or videos, that could point to any instances of corruption.\n\nHe further noted that he has never considered XRP to be a security and felt that making definitive statements on the SEC's motivations without concrete proof would be both unproductive and potentially misleading. He highlighted the necessity of robust discussions within the crypto community based on valid data and transparent sources rather than indulging in conspiracy theories.\n\nBurying the hatchet with XRP fans\n\nHoskinson, who left Ethereum in 2014, has repeatedly refuted ties and implications connected to events after his departure. Despite expressing a desire for peace with the XRP community and acknowledging XRP's win against the SEC, he's shown frustration over continuous associations with Ethereum's post-departure events. Central to the tensions is a conspiracy theory that the SEC showed undue favoritism to Ethereum over Ripple, which Hoskinson deems baseless. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse did not support the conspiracy theories but noted some questionable optics involving key SEC figures."

        "content": "Ethereum Classic could be a good candidate for a bullish bounce as it retested the long-term support range.\n\nETC struggled to secure strong bullish volumes, although derivatives demand could be making headways.\n\nIs Ethereum Classic [ETC] still worth trading or investing towards the end of 2023? Well, the altcoin\u2019s bulls have really struggled to secure dominance during the crypto winter. But should anyone expand their portfolio for the short-term and long-term with ETC?\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETC Profit Calculator\n\nThe good news is that the choice is not that difficult for Ethereum Classic. The ideal portfolio should be diverse and consist of cryptocurrencies from different segments. For example, it could contain cryptos of promising Proof-of-Stake (PoS) networks, as well as Proof-of-Work (PoW) networks.\n\nETC is one of the few coins that are native to a PoS network.\n\nOf course, ETC has something else going for it. It is affiliated with Ethereum, one of the most popular blockchain networks in the world. This alone could encourage many to scoop up some ETC during the next bull run.\n\nHowever, these are still within the realm of speculation, and may not exactly represent the current status quo.\n\nCan ETC attract significant buy pressure?\n\nEthereum Classic could potentially benefit from robust demand in the future, but it was lacking at press time. The cryptocurrency has been on an overall decline since the start of 2023, maintaining the same trend that we saw in the previous year.\n\nETC\u2019s price action suggested that we might see the bulls attempt to challenge the bears from its press time level. The cryptocurrency traded at $14.94 at the time of writing. This was noteworthy, because it was still within the same low range that acted as a long-term support.\n\nA key point here is that the same support level has been retested multiple times in the past. This means it is highly likely that the price could bounce back from the same level for the next short-term rally. The same could be said about its long-term potential.\n\nBut could Ethereum Classic bounce back from the same support level? At the time of writing, the Weighted Sentiment showed some improvement from the lowest price level since the start of October. However, it also highlighted a lack of strong interest.\n\nETC\u2019s Volume metric also reflected the lack of excitement in the cryptocurrency. The press time on-chain observations revealed that Volume fell to its lowest in four weeks.\n\nRead Ethereum Classic\u2019s [ETC] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nOn the other hand, its Binance Funding Rate was back to the positive side of things, suggesting that Ethereum Classic\u2019s demand was growing in the derivatives market.\n\nWhile the positive funding rates may point to recovering demand, it was clear that spot demand was still quite low at the time of writing. As such, there is a chance that short-term price action might remain bearish."

Discover SCENE\n\nThe inventor of leading decentralized exchange Uniswap, Hayden Adams, announced today that the protocol will be implementing a 0.15% swap fee on their web app and wallet interfaces for the very first time.\n\nOnly a certain set of tokens will be affected by the new fee, according to a Uniswap Labs\u2019 blog post, including ETH, USDC, WETH, USDT, DAI, WBTC, agEUR, GUSD, LUSD, EUROC, and XSGD.\n\nHowever, the fee only applies when traded through Uniswap Labs\u2019 interfaces on mainnet and supported layer 2s\u2014and if the swap takes place between an input and output that are both subject to the fee. Swaps from stablecoins to stablecoins are excluded from this initial charge.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBridgett Frey, a spokeswoman for Uniswap Labs, told Decrypt that they took a \u201cholistic view at how people use our product, and determined this initial list of tokens that made most sense,\u201d adding that they expect it to evolve over time.\n\nThe new fee is set to go live tomorrow, and according to Adams, will allow Uniswap Labs \u201cto continue to research, develop, build, ship, improve, and expand crypto and DeFi.\u201d\n\nOther leaders in the Web3 space said the move was a reasonable one, with Gnosis cofounder Martin Koppelmann saying it was \u201cgood news.\u201d\n\n\u201dIf we want to have resilient systems that work at scale there needs to be entities that have a sustainable income,\u201d Koppelmann wrote on Twitter, suggesting another fee would make sense.\n\nUniswap charging a frontend fee is good news. If we want to have resilient systems that work at scale there needs to be entities that have a sustainable income - I hope next the onchain fee switch will follow. https://t.co/Z9d4ZjVPoN \u2014 Martin K\u00f6ppelmann \ud83e\udd89\ud83d\udcb3 (@koeppelmann) October 16, 2023\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNot everyone is on board, however, with widespread backlash seen on Crypto Twitter.\n\nGabriel Shapiro, general counsel for Delphi Labs, a Web3 research and development platform, has been sounding the alarm on Twitter for years, denouncing what he calls \u201cnon-exit liquidity,\u201d something he said has been implemented by venture capital as it has increasingly moves into the space.\n\nShapiro told Decrypt that the problem is that investors (such as those in the $1.66 billion Series B Uniswap Labs closed last year) have \u201cconsistently resisted allowing any value accrual to [Uniswap], but in the meantime have used the token to get liquidity.\u201d\n\nHow? By not implementing the fee switch, Shapiro explained.\n\nThe fee switch would allow the Uniswap community to redirect a portion of the protocol\u2019s fee revenues to governance. The latest vote for implementation was rejected back in early June.\n\nInterestingly, Shapiro\u2019s views resonated with those of Web3 VC investor Nic Carter, a partner at Castle Island Ventures. He wrote on Twitter that he has \u201cnever seen a situation more demonstrative of equity value siphoning token value\u201d than Uniswap, resulting in \u201ctoken holders being at odds with shareholders.\u201d\n\nCarter and Shapiro note that Uniswap investors hold more equity than UNI tokens, thus creating a misalignment between the groups.\n\nAri Paul, founder and CIO of BlockTower capital, took a nuanced view on the controversy, understanding that it\u2019s \u201creasonable\u201d to charge fees, but that UNI holders are \u201clikely to get ripped off\u201d due to what he called an awkward mismatch of incentives.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThat said, according to Shapiro, Uniswap initially added the fee switch as \u201ca value driver expectation.\u201d He said that people buy tokens with these types of features \u201cbased on hopium\u201d that the fee switch will get implemented and that\u2019s how the protocol will be monetized.\n\nThe Web3 attorney thinks that the fee switch could still be turned on\u2014\u201cbut let\u2019s face it, users have limited appetite for fees.\u201d He noted that \u201cevery fee that applies somewhere in the stack makes it less likely a large in-protocol fee is sustainable and comes right out of the pocket of UNI holders.\u201d\n\nBoth Carter and Shapiro\u2019s views were backed by pseudonymous account Autism Capital, which pointed out that the UNI fee switch is voted on by governance, but that Adams and the \u201cunicorn sparkle crew\u201d don\u2019t disclose that their friends and VCs and have \u201caggregated control of the supply, thus voting power, and decision making.\u201d\n\nDespite these cries of foul play, plenty of supporters came out to back the newly instantiated fee\u2013some pointing to a much-needed direction for building a sustainable business path, whereas others highlighted the protocol continues to be permissionless and \u201cno one is forced to pay the fee.\u201d\n\nEdited by Ryan Ozawa."

        "title": "Crypto Price Today: Bitcoin nears $28,000; Ethereum rises above $1,550 - The Economic Times",
        "content": "ETMarkets.com\n\nThe crypto tokens surged on Monday after the SEC refrained from appealing against the Bitcoin ETF. Bitcoin was up 3.8% at $27,909, while Ethereum was above the $1,550 level.Meanwhile, the global cryptocurrency market cap surged 2.6% to around $1.08 trillion in the last 24 hours.\"BTC and ETH both showed positive gains over the weekend, driven by the news that the SEC won't appeal the court decision regarding Grayscale's spot Bitcoin ETF application. This news has sparked the interest of investors, as it raises the likelihood of a BTC spot ETF approval by the end of the first quarter of 2024,\" said CoinDCX Research Team.Meanwhile, Parth Chaturvedi, Investments Lead at CoinSwitch Ventures, said, \"In a positive development that underlines the crypto adoption, Ferrari - a well-renowned car manufacturer will now accept crypto as a payment method for its luxury cars in the U.S. To execute this, the company has partnered with BitPay wherein payments will be accepted in BTC, ETH, and USDC. As part of its expansion plans, this payment method will soon be available in Europe as well.\"In today's trade, other crypto tokens were also trading higher. Solana and Tron rose up to 3%, while Toncoin, XRP, BNB, Litecoin, and Polkadot surged up to 2%.In the last 24 hours, the market cap of Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency, surged to $544 billion. Bitcoin's dominance is currently 50.3%, according to CoinMarketCap. BTC volume in the last 24 hours increased 120.4% to $10.94 billion.Bitcoin has been locked in a trading range between moving averages recently, reflecting uncertainty and a standoff between bullish and bearish sentiment regarding its next price movement. Such tight consolidations often precede significant price swings.However, Bitcoin didn't favoured the bulls last week, with its price on track to close with a more than 3% loss. This downward pressure, coupled with regulatory concerns, has contributed to a reduced interest in Altcoins among crypto investors. Consequently, Bitcoin's market dominance has remained near the 50% mark.Bitcoin after testing the crucial support level of $25,000 (Horizontal Trendline & 50% Fibonacci Retracement Level) has witnessed a relief rally and the prices went up almost by 14% to $28,580. The bulls failed to manage their grip on the asset as BTC resisted at $28,500 and corrected to $26,538. Over the past four days, the asset has been trading in a narrow range from $26,550 to $27,250 with low volumes. BTC has strong support at $25,000 and strong resistance at $32,500. Breakouts on either side of these levels with good volumes will further decide the trend of the asset.(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

        "title": "Unexpected Predictions From ChatGPT! Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), Ripple (XRP), Cardano (ADA) Price Forecasts ... - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "The cryptocurrency market, a realm of unprecedented opportunities and equally unpredictable challenges, is currently in the throes of significant upheaval. Recent news, such as the misinformation surrounding the approval of the BlackRock ETF, has sent shockwaves through the crypto markets, causing ripples of volatility. As Bitcoin reacts to these market tremors, other prominent players like Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), Ripple (XRP), and Cardano (ADA) find themselves at pivotal junctures, each grappling with its own set of challenges and uncertainties. Amidst this backdrop, ScapesMania too is lining up, ready to make its mark in the ever-evolving crypto arena.\n\n\n\nMembers of the crypto community were once again shown that nobody can be trusted after widespread misinformation regarding ETF approval was shared by the most prominent news outlets. When a single piece of news could boost the wealth of the whales, the only way to protect your investment is via in-depth technical analysis and a methodical trading approach. Let\u2019s have a look at ChatGPT\u2019s technical analysis of Solana (SOL), Ripple (XRP), and Cardano (ADA) to find out where their prices are headed in the future.\n\nSummary:\n\nScapesMania (MANIA): This new entrant in the crypto space is gaining traction with innovative revenue streams and strong security measures, positioning it as a potential contender in the evolving crypto arena.\n\nEthereum (ETH): Once a dominant force, Ethereum (ETH) faces challenges from emerging blockchains and internal issues.\n\nSolana (SOL): Despite its initial promise, Solana (SOL) is grappling with increasing competition and market dynamics that cast a shadow over its growth prospects.\n\nRipple (XRP): Regulatory battles and market volatility have left Ripple (XRP) future uncertain, despite its unique use cases in cross-border transactions.\n\nCardano (ADA): Cardano (ADA) recent development activity is commendable, but questions remain about its sustainability and ability to win market trust amidst growing competition.\n\nScapesMania: the Next Big Thing? x500% on the Horizon?\n\nWhile bigger cryptocurrencies wrestle with volatility, ScapesMania can offer almost guaranteed ROIs in the range of 400-500%. The innovative project is currently in presale which means holders can get paid well for the wait. The presale consists of several rounds and the current one offers a huge discount on purchases, nearing 85%.

There\u2019s no downside and plenty of potential gains to joining ScapesMania even if you don\u2019t have much money to make use of.\n\nA closer examination of this coin\u2019s features reveals many attractive aspects. For instance, ScapesMania allows holders to get involved with a multi-billion-dollar industry and has many features in place to keep users engaged and incentivize them to keep on engaging. Furthermore, the tokenomics of the project is transparent and secure and the addition of the latest $150,000 giveaway may be the final touch needed to convert early enthusiasts into full-blown fanatics.\n\nThose still considering which presale projects to choose, need to know that ScapesMania\u2019s vision for the future is highly ambitious. it comes in the form of further listings, improvements, and development of a unique niche concept that has yet to be adopted in crypto circles. Considering all of the above, it\u2019s not surprising that the presale numbers are outstanding \u2013 it can surely be a boon to many in the long run.\n\nScapesMania is at the point where previous buyers can already assume they\u2019ve made a great decision and now the time is right for those who haven\u2019t tried the project yet. Get in now to reach potential ROIs of 400-500% or maybe even higher.\n\nEthereum (ETH): The Pioneer\u2019s Plight\n\nEthereum (ETH), previously standing unchallenged in the decentralized sector, is now confronting serious obstacles that undermine its supremacy. A notable decrease in validator participation raises red flags, potentially pointing to latent network deficiencies or a decline in user enthusiasm. With the advent of alternative blockchains boasting attractive capabilities, the solidity of Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) stature is under scrutiny.\n\nIn the current scenario, Ethereum\u2019s valuation swings between $1,570 and $1,732, presenting a critical juncture for the cryptocurrency. The 10-Day Moving Average, positioned at $1,574, leans towards a near-term negative outlook, as per ChatGPT\u2019s analysis. Conversely, the 100-Day Moving Average, at $1,720, hints at an upward trajectory over an extended period, suggesting that not all hope is lost for Ethereum enthusiasts. These contrasting trends depict an intense standoff between market optimists and pessimists.\n\nNavigating a path strewn with challenges, Ethereum (ETH) capitalizes on its foundational ecosystem and a vibrant community of developers. However, the pressure from up-and-coming blockchains and intrinsic adversities may dampen its market allure. ChatGPT underscores the importance of Ethereum (ETH) proactively confronting its prevailing challenges; failure to do so could compromise its future market position. The analytical foresight provided indicates a pivotal phase for Ethereum, where its responses to internal and competitive pressures could be decisive in sculpting its trajectory in the cryptocurrency domain.\n\nSolana (SOL): The Rising Star\u2019s Dilemma\n\nSolana (SOL), once celebrated for its scalability and potential, is encountering burgeoning competition, particularly evidenced by the surge in development activities around competitors like Cardano. This intense rivalry underscores the unpredictable and fickle landscape of the cryptocurrency arena. The faith placed in Solana\u2019s (SOL) potential is undergoing a rigorous examination, with outcomes that don\u2019t particularly tilt in its favor.\n\nThe pricing behavior of Solana (SOL) presents a captivating study. As the value oscillates between $18.55 and $22.99, the crypto asset approaches a critical juncture. The 10-Day Moving Average, clocking in at $22.45, coupled with the 100-Day Moving Average at $22.12, points towards a looming phase of market consolidation, as observed by ChatGPT. Current resistance and support metrics imply an impending breakout, although market speculations are rife regarding the definitive direction.\n\nLooking ahead, a haze of uncertainty engulfs Solana\u2019s (SOL) prospects. Despite its laudable technical attributes, the unforgiving nature of the crypto market spares no one, Solana (SOL) included. It wrestles with a gamut of challenges ranging from stiffening competition, intricate regulatory environments, and volatile investor sentiments. ChatGPT theorizes that amidst these multifaceted pressures, maintaining its present market standing is a herculean task for Solana (SOL), with growth appearing even more challenging. The platform\u2019s resilience in navigating these market turbulences will be a litmus test for its long-term viability and success.\n\nRipple (XRP): Regulatory Resilience Uncertainty\n\nRecent market activities, including speculative buzz around potential nods for iShares Bitcoin spot ETF by industry titan BlackRock, have spurred episodic yet ephemeral upticks in Ripple\u2019s (XRP) financial charts. This erratic pattern highlights the quandary Ripple (XRP) finds itself in, struggling to cement its reputation as a steadfast, dependable player in the tumultuous crypto domain. Despite its bespoke advantages in areas such as international payment corridors, the overarching investor sentiment around Ripple (XRP) vacillates.\n\nCurrently, with value markers swinging between $0.466 and $0.556, there\u2019s a palpable sense of investor trepidation. ChatGPT points out that the 10-Day Moving Average hovers around $0.494, whereas the 100-Day Moving Average is perched slightly higher at $0.572, signaling prevailing market jitters. For Ripple (XRP), the resistance thresholds at $0.597 and $0.688 loom as formidable frontiers to breach, while the support echelons at $0.327 and $0.417 insinuate that additional depreciations could very well be forthcoming.\n\nAmidst its entanglement in legal spats and the murky waters of regulatory scrutiny, a cloud of uncertainty looms over Ripple (XRP). Despite earnest initiatives to vindicate its standing and assert its merit as a bona fide asset within the financial tapestry, opinions amongst the investment fraternity are split. ChatGPT emphasizes that the ramifications of ongoing courtroom tussles are pivotal, wielding the power to make or break Ripple (XRP) esteem and the confidence it commands among investors. The future narrative of Ripple hinges critically on these unfolding events, dictating its trajectory in the competitive crypto race.\n\nCardano (ADA): The Challenger\u2019s Journey\n\nAmidst a whirlwind of speculation and scrutiny within the crypto arena, Cardano (ADA) finds itself grappling with pivotal questions about its future. Despite achieving laudable milestones on the development front, opinions within the digital currency circles are starkly polarized regarding its endurance in the long haul. The uptick in developmental pursuits is noteworthy, yet it beckons inquiry into whether this vigor is a sustainable trajectory or merely a transient gust of progress.\n\nThe financial contours for Cardano (ADA) delineate a trend of instability and circumspection among its backers. With prices in a dance between $0.240 and $0.263, the asset\u2019s 10-Day Moving Average charts a course at $0.249, while the 100-Day Moving Average anchors at a slightly more optimistic $0.274, illustrating the market\u2019s teetering confidence. Resistance strata at $0.272 and $0.294 underscore Cardano (ADA)\u2019s tribulations in clinching loftier valuations, and the support bases at $0.205 and $0.227 loom as harbingers of potential dips, subject to the whims of broader market sentiment.\n\nCardano (ADA) touts a formidable technical scaffold and a bustling sphere of developers \u2013 its cardinal virtues. However, ChatGPT notes that the marketplace harbors reservations concerning its trajectory ahead. The shadows cast by burgeoning rival blockchains, along with Cardano\u2019s intrinsic conundrums, could potentially tether its valuation to lower echelons. It necessitates more than algorithmic artistry to captivate the trading masses; it mandates the cultivation of confidence, the nurturing of strategic alliances, and crucially, the fulfillment of its lofty proclamations. Absent these, its station in the cryptocurrency pecking order wavers on shaky grounds\n\nConclusion:\n\nEthereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), Ripple (XRP), and Cardano (ADA) each present a unique set of challenges and opportunities in the current market. Ethereum, once a dominant force, now faces competition and internal issues. Solana, despite its initial promise, is tested by market dynamics. Ripple\u2019s future is clouded by regulatory battles, and Cardano, with its strong technical foundation, still needs to solidify its market position. Meanwhile, ScapesMania, with its innovative approach and growing traction, shows promising potential to carve out a significant niche for itself in the market.\n\nThe project is sure to attract major interest from savvy traders since it offers impressive discounts and gives you a chance to win your fair share of $150,000.

        "title": "\u2018Ripple Is The Internet Of Value\u2019 Ethereum Founder Vitalik Buterin Says In Recovered Video | Bitcoinist.com - Bitcoinist",
        "content": "The competition between Ripple and Ethereum has been a long-running one given the capabilities of both networks. This was further exacerbated by the fact that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chose to bring a lawsuit against Ripple over XRP being allegedly a security but the same was not done about Ethereum\u2019s ETH token.\n\nBoth communities have since been at loggerheads with each one trying to prove that they\u2019re better than the other. As a result of this, a video from 2014 has been dug up where Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin seems to be praising Ripple.\n\n\u2018Ripple Is The Internet Of Value\u2019\n\nIn the video that was posted by X (formerly Twitter) user @NerdNationUnbox, Buterin seems to be very convinced about the value proposition of Ripple. The setting which suggests a talk at an event featured a young Vitalik Buterin talking about what Ethereum is really about.\n\nThe 14-second video seems to be focused on the \u2018internet of value\u2019 which the Ethereum founder explained that people often think Ethereum is about. However, as he explained, Ethereum is not the internet of value. Rather, the founder said that Ripple is actually the internet of value.\n\nInternet of value is actually a concept that was presented by Ripple which looked to build an Internet that makes it easy for people to transfer any asset of value seamlessly between themselves. It consists of any asset that could be valuable including information, internet currencies, stocks, etc, to be transferred instantly to someone.\n\nEthereum Founder Really A Fan Of XRP?\n\nSteven Nerayoff who has become widely known in crypto circles as the \u2018Ethereum Whistleblower\u2019 is back once again and going for Vitalik Buterin. In an October 13 post, Nerayoff tagged Buterin, whom he describes with #CryptoJudas, saying that he actually wanted to be XRP.\n\nNerayoff attached a screenshot of a deleted tweet from the Ethereum founder talking about XRP as sound money. \u201cBut he\u2019s so shy he deleted his tweet which is in this article stating that XRP is \u2018better sound money than Bitcoin\u2019,\u201d Nerayoff wrote.\n\nSource: X\n\nHowever, as other X users have pointed out, Buterin seemed to actually be making fun of XRP in the tweet. Responding to another user who presented Bitcoin as sound money, Buterin said \u201cThe chart for XRP/XRP would look the same\u201d, but his use of \u2018TM\u2019 with the terms Institutional adoption and Partnerships suggests he was not being serious as this has been an established way to joke about something on the internet.\n\nNevertheless, the post is still very open to interpretation and there have been responses from both sides. One Ripple community member stated:\n\nThis is the same guy who a few months earlier was rejoicing when XRP was attacked by the SEC, he also was angry that Chris Larsen had suggested the Chinese had too much influence in BTC and ETH. XRP really hit a nerve not because we were wrong, but because we could see through his scammy games.\n\nXRP mounts impressive recovery | Source: XRPUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nFeatured image from The Cryptocurrency Post, chart from Tradingview.com"
