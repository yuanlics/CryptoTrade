        "content": "Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin is facing a lawsuit from more than two dozen former Consensys employees, accusing him, Consensys and other parties of maneuvering valuable assets out of its Swiss holding company.\n\nThe complaint was filed in New York state court on Thursday. It claims assets \u2014 including its web3 wallet MetaMask, partly developed by some of the plaintiffs \u2014 were transferred out of Consensys AG, leaving them with worthless shares.\n\nLubin allegedly arranged to move the assets to a new U.S.-based company, CSI, in 2020, so it could solicit outside investment, with the help of Consensys General Counsel Matt Corva, enabling Lubin to replace the plaintiffs with Wall Street investors.\n\nLubin also brought in investment bank JPMorgan, who, in exchange for its own blockchain business, Quorum, received 10% of CSI, according to the complaint. Corva, JPMorgan and Umar Farooq, Global Head of Blockchain at JPMorgan, are also listed as defendants.\n\n'He broke his word'\n\nWhen Lubin established Consensys in 2014, many employees accepted lower salaries with the understanding they would receive company equity, according to the suit. Lubin reportedly dedicated 30% of the company to employee stock, with the suing party holding about 9% of that portion.\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nLegal representatives for the former employees argue that while Lubin prospered, those who believed in his early vision and accepted stock over higher pay ended up with empty promises. \u201cHe broke his word,\u201d the lawyers wrote. \u201cIn the process, he violated his legal commitments and duties. While Lubin got rich, plaintiffs got nothing.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlaintiffs in an ongoing shareholder case against the Swiss-based web3 incubator and investor Consensys AG, which operates as Consensys Mesh, have just filed suit against U.S. blockchain software developer Consensys Software Inc. in New York state court,\u201d a Consensys spokesperson told The Block via email.\n\n\u201cAfter two years of getting nowhere with their frivolous claims against Consensys Mesh in a Swiss court, plaintiffs now believe their meritless claims stand a better chance of yielding a pay day if they game U.S. courts and entangle Consensys Software and other unrelated parties in litigation,\u201d the spokesperson added. \u201cWe fully expect that the plaintiffs, who were never employees of Consensys Software, will soon find this gambit is another fruitless attempt to enrich themselves from the success of others.\u201d\n\nCSI has raised at least $726.7 million from investors, according to the suit, with its valuation rising to more than $7 billion following Series D financing."

        "title": "Should You Buy Ethereum While It's Below $2,000? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "It's hard to deny how wonderful an investment Ethereum (ETH 4.70%) has been. As of this writing, the token's price is up more than 52,000% since its public launch in July 2015.\n\nThat's an impressive gain, but it hasn't been a smooth ride for investors. Ethereum currently sits 68% off its all-time high price, set in November 2021.\n\nIs it smart to buy this top cryptocurrency while it's still below $2,000? Let's look at the reasons both for and against this decision.\n\nBuying the dip could be a smart move\n\nThe obvious reason to be a buyer right now is how beaten-down Ethereum's price is. During the huge bull run in 2021, crypto markets drew a lot of enthusiasm from the investment community looking for quick profits. Things certainly look to have been in bubble territory. In the years since, there has been a bit of a normalization, which might be a good thing.\n\nRapidly rising interest rates crushed the stock and crypto markets in 2022. And it introduced a prolonged market downturn in digital assets, even though Ethereum has climbed this year.\n\nAll else equal, investing in something when its price is lower is a better move. Should things still play out as hoped, the upside is greater than if you had bought at a higher price. This could be the situation with Ethereum right now.\n\nSome investors are bullish on Ethereum for its game-changing potential, primarily in the world of decentralized applications (dApps). That this blockchain has capabilities to build smart contracts has caused many believers to see a lot of use cases developing over time.\n\nWhile the activity around decentralized finance protocols and non-fungible tokens has cooled off, Ethereum remains the leader in these innovations. Thus, when the market rebounds, as it has done in the past, demand for the blockchain could soar once again with a growing dApp ecosystem.\n\nEthereum's transition to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism 13 months ago might have won over a lot of people. This move reduced the network's energy usage by more than 99%, which will certainly go over well with climate activists. It paves the way for a more sustainable future.\n\nEthereum is too risky\n\nThere are also some clear reasons not to buy Ethereum -- despite its price being below $2,000 at the moment. Cryptocurrencies might simply be way too volatile for some investors. This issue is more of a concern for those who are near or in retirement. Owning Ethereum exposes the portfolio to wild valuation swings, which could be too hard to stomach.\n\nSome naysayers might also argue that there isn't even a need for Ethereum. In other words, it's a solution looking for a problem to solve.\n\nTake financial services, for example. DeFi promises to remove intermediaries, which might lead to better consumer pricing and rates. But as we've seen with the failures of major crypto firms, things are opaque and too complex to understand. For all its faults, the current financial system is adequate for most people, and that could eliminate the demand for DeFi services.\n\nEthereum faces regulatory uncertainty, too. Is it a security? If the Securities and Exchange Commission one day rules that it is, that means Ethereum will have to abide by comprehensive reporting requirements. And this could result in heightened public scrutiny of the crypto.\n\nThere's even a possibility that Ethereum won't get back to its all-time high ever. The euphoria that characterized the market in 2021 might be a one-hit wonder.\n\nOn one hand, I can see why some investors might be interested in starting a tiny position in Ethereum, primarily as a result of its potential. But I'm in the camp that says it's better to probably be a bit more critical and avoid the crypto altogether or await further developments."

        "title": "New Ethereum (ETH) ETFs Hit the Market. Are They Worth Buying? - TipRanks.com - TipRanks",
        "content": "This month, several new Ethereum (ETH-USD) futures ETFs hit the market and began trading in the U.S. for the first time. These ETFs all invest in Ethereum futures contracts. Ethereum is the second-largest digital asset in the world, with a market cap of over $190 billion. After enduring a brutal bear market in 2023, Ethereum is up about 32% YTD. I\u2019m bullish on the long-term future of Ethereum, and as we\u2019ll discuss below, Ethereum ETFs can be a useful tool for investors who want to gain exposure to ETH.\n\nWhat is Ethereum?\n\nSo, what is Ethereum anyway? Not only is it the second-largest and most popular cryptocurrency (after Bitcoin (BTC-USD)), but it is the largest proof-of-stake cryptocurrency. Ethereum.org explains that Ethereum is \u201ca network of computers all over the world that follow a set of rules called the Ethereum protocol. The Ethereum network acts as the foundation for communities, applications, organizations and digital assets that anyone can build and use.\u201d\n\nIt is a decentralized blockchain network that people can use to send and receive peer-to-peer payments, send and receive stablecoins and other assets, buy and sell non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and more. Users can even use Ethereum to create their own crypto tokens. Users can also \u201cstake\u201d their holdings to help process transactions and secure the network while earning interest for doing so. Ethereum has nearly 250 million users around the world.\n\nWhat\u2019s the Big Deal About an Ethereum ETF?\n\nThe appeal of an Ethereum futures ETF is clear \u2014 investors can now gain exposure to Ethereum through their brokerage accounts or retirement accounts without having to hold it themselves in a crypto wallet, a step that can be daunting for some investors. Ethereum ETFs also mean that these types of investors don\u2019t have to open up a separate account on a centralized crypto exchange like Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) in order to invest.\n\nBuying and holding Ethereum yourself involves some risks, as an individual can lose some or all of their holdings if they are hacked or if they interact with a malicious smart contract through a phishing link.\n\nFurthermore, many investors lost the money that they had invested in crypto when centralized crypto exchanges like FTX, Celsius, and Voyager Digital imploded, meaning that leaving one\u2019s holdings on an exchange isn\u2019t necessarily a safe haven either. Investing in Ethereum via an ETF is thus an appealing option for investors, as it removes many of these risks.\n\nSpot vs. Futures ETFs\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that these ETFs invest in Ethereum futures contracts. They don\u2019t directly buy and hold Ethereum. There are a number of applications out there for \u201cspot\u201d Ethereum ETFs that would do just that, but these have not yet been approved by the SEC, and it is unclear if they will be. Note that the SEC has approved a number of Bitcoin futures ETFs, but a spot Bitcoin ETF still doesn\u2019t exist at this point in time.\n\nIt\u2019s also important for investors to note that the price of futures contracts can differ from that of the underlying asset itself. So, for investors who are interested in investing in Ethereum in this way, what are the new options out there?\n\nEFUT is VanEck\u2019s entry into this space. VanEck is a well-known traditional asset manager that has already launched several ETFs focusing on publicly-traded companies that are involved in cryptocurrency. EFUT has just under $8 million in assets under management and charges a relatively high expense ratio of 0.66%, but as you\u2019ll see below, high fees are par for the course with this group of ETFs.\n\nEETH is another option from what crypto investors would call a TradFi asset manager. EETH is a bit smaller than EFUT, with just $6.5 million in AUM, and is quite a bit more expensive than EFUT, with an expense ratio of 0.95%.\n\nThe Bitwise Ethereum Strategy ETF has under $1 million in assets under management and charges an expense ratio of 0.85%. Bitwise has experience in the crypto space with several other crypto-related ETFs.\n\nThis is another offering from Bitwise, and it\u2019s an interesting one, as it is a bit different from the names preceding it on this list. BTOP invests in both Ethereum futures contracts and Bitcoin futures contracts at an equal weighting. This makes it an effective choice for investors who want to invest in both Bitcoin and Ethereum in one simple and convenient vehicle. The only downside of BTOP is that, like AETH, it has less than $1 million in AUM and a relatively high expense ratio of 0.85%.\n\nLike BTOP, BTF provides investors with equal-weight exposure to both Bitcoin and Ethereum. Interestingly, BTF predates the other ETFs here, as it was previously a Bitcoin futures ETF but has now changed its strategy to invest in both Bitcoin and Ethereum futures.\n\nBTF is a convenient way to invest in both of the most prominent digital assets without having to pick winners. It\u2019s also larger than many of the other ETFs on this list, with about $26 million in AUM (although, again, this is still relatively small). The main downside of BTF is that on a list of ETFs with high expense ratios, it comes in with the highest of all, with an expense ratio of 1.20%.\n\nThe name is a mouthful, but this ETF from ProShares essentially gives investors exposure to both Bitcoin and Ethereum futures. Unlike BTOP and BTF, BETH is market-weighted, so it invests more in Bitcoin futures than in Ethereum futures. BETH has a relatively steep expense ratio of 0.95%, and it has just $1.2 million in AUM.\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nThese ETFs are all relatively expensive, especially compared to simply buying and holding ETH in one\u2019s own crypto wallet or account. They are also all relatively minuscule ETFs in the grand scheme of things and are susceptible to volatility, as Ethereum can be a volatile asset.\n\nOn the plus side, these ETFs enable investors to gain access to Ethereum in their brokerage and retirement accounts in a convenient and hassle-free way. This makes them a good option for risk-tolerant investors who are bullish on the future of Ethereum and want to invest in it but don\u2019t want to set up and manage a crypto wallet or an account on a crypto exchange.\n\nI am personally bullish on Ethereum and invest in it directly, but these ETFs are a sensible option for investors who are bullish but don\u2019t want to do this. Of the current choices, I like EFUT the best, as it has the most assets under management of the Ethereum-specific ETFs (although it is still very small) and the lowest expense ratio of the group.\n\nDown the road, it\u2019s possible that the Ethereum ETF landscape could change over time if spot Ethereum ETFs are approved by regulators and if bigger asset managers launch their own ETFs with lower fees.\n\nDisclosure"

        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction as $1,800 Level Comes into Play \u2013 What Are the Indicators Showing?\n\nSource: TradingView\n\nThe Ethereum price has dropped by 0.5% in the past 24 hours, dipping to $1,619 as the market as a whole falls by roughly the same percentage within the same amount of time.\n\nETH has now declined by 6% in the past week, although the market\u2019s biggest altcoin remains up by 2.5% in a fortnight and by 35% since the beginning of the year.\n\nHowever, the cryptocurrency has struggled to remain above $1,700 this month, while its 200-day average continues to hover around $1,800, indicating just how oversold it still is at the moment.\n\nOn the other hand, this also suggests that ETH is due a rebound and soon, and with its fundamentals remaining very strong, such a rebound is only a matter of time.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction as $1,800 Level Comes into Play \u2013 What Are the Indicators Showing?\n\nThere\u2019s little doubt that ETH is in the middle of a short-term downswing right now, with its indicators all looking fairly weak.\n\nSource: TradingView\n\nFirstly, its price has dropped by its 30-day exponential moving average (yellow), which itself remains some way below the coin\u2019s 200-day average (blue), all of which indicates big selling pressure.\n\nSecondly, ETH\u2019s relative strength index (purple) is falling slowly below 50, something which also signals an excess of selling, but which also suggest that such selling could continue for a while longer yet (since the RSI hasn\u2019t fallen to 30 or 20).\n\nHaving said that, it will be interesting to see whether ETH\u2019s current support level (green) can resist a fall below $1,600 or so.\n\nIf it can, ETH may recover sooner rather than later, yet a drop below this key psychological level may forecast further losses.\n\nEither way, Ethereum remains one of the most fundamentally attractive altcoins in the market, and given that it is massively below its current 200-day average of $1,800, it really should rebound soon.\n\nIndeed, recent losses have nothing specifically to do with Ethereum on a fundamental level, with market negativity surrounding rising bond yields, for instance, depressing stocks and other speculative assets (including cryptos).\n\nYet Ethereum remains in the same position it was when it last rallied at the start of the month, with the layer-one blockchain accounting for the vast bulk of the total value locked in of the DeFi sector (particularly when you include ETH-based layer-two networks).\n\nAnd as we never tire of pointing out, recent months have seen some major adoption news for Ethereum, with PayPal launching its own ETH-based stablecoin and Visa conducting stablecoin trials on its network."

        "content": "Ethereum network fees are currently at their lowest point in 2023.\n\nThe Ethereum (ETH) blockchain witnessed a significant reduction in network fees, with users paying a mere $1.15 per transaction, Santiment data shows. The current decline in Ethereum\u2019s transaction fees carries with it a historical pattern that bodes well for the network\u2019s utility.\n\nAs transaction fees drop, Ethereum becomes a cheaper choice for users to interact with its versatile platform. This development holds the promise of boosting Ethereum\u2019s overall market value.\n\nLately, there has been a notable rise in the level of on-chain transactions within the Ethereum network. The figure, totaling 1,089,893 user active wallets (UAW), marks the second-highest activity level in Ethereum\u2019s history. Blockchain analysts at Santiment noted that such spikes in on-chain activity could be a signal for potential price rebounds.\n\nYou might also like: Ethereum unveils new testnet called \u2018Hole\u0161ky\u2019\n\nThis increased activity suggests growing interest and utility in the Ethereum network, which may positively impact its market capitalization in the coming months.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/santimentfeed/status/1705401195152789888\n\nWhile the wider cryptocurrency landscape sees significant price dips, Ethereum has remained above the $1,500 mark.\n\nIn June, analysts expressed optimism in the world\u2019s second-largest crypto, with some predicting Ethereum\u2019s ascent to a historic high of $3,000. What fuels this bullish sentiment is the remarkable dwindling of ETH reserves on exchanges, plunging to an unprecedented low of 12.6%.\n\nThis scarcity of Ethereum in exchange wallets underscores the platform\u2019s robust demand, offering a compelling narrative amidst turbulent crypto seas. This scarcity of tokens available for sale on centralized exchanges is considered a bullish sign of Ethereum\u2019s future performance.\n\nGrayscale floats Ethereum Futures ETF application\n\nIn a significant move, Grayscale recently filed an application for an Ethereum futures-based exchange-traded fund (ETF). This application follows a previous filing under the Securities Act of 1933, the same regulatory framework governing commodities and spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs.\n\nNotably, Grayscale\u2018s filing for an Ethereum futures ETF marks an important distinction, as the SEC has previously approved Bitcoin futures ETFs under both the Securities Act of 1933 and the Investment Company Act of 1940, which regulates most security-based ETFs. This move by Grayscale reflects the growing institutional interest in Ethereum.\n\nIn the midst of Ethereum\u2019s journey, co-founder Vitalik Buterin\u2019s voice resonates with a clear vision. Buterin places a strong emphasis on two pivotal pillars: privacy and decentralization. These principles, he asserts, are not mere aspirations but core priorities guiding Ethereum\u2019s path forward.\n\nIn a crypto landscape marked by change, Buterin\u2019s commitment to these ideals illuminates Ethereum\u2019s enduring quest for a more private, decentralized, and inclusive digital future\n\nHe expressed concerns about the vulnerability of centralized entities like custodial exchanges, which can be easily corrupted. Buterin advocates for direct transactions on the Ethereum blockchain to empower users and enhance security.\n\nYou might also like: Ethereum goes red as active addresses, deposits spike\n\nEthereum price analysis\n\nAfter facing resistance on July 14, Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) price has been on a downward trend. Today, ETH is trading at $1,593, reflecting a 2.7% price decline in one week. Ethereum\u2019s market capitalization stands above $191 billion, according to CoinGecko.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) of Ether on the weekly timeframe currently stands at 21.8, indicating a potential oversold condition. Ethereum has a critical support level of $1,500.\n\nWhile Ethereum\u2019s recent price decline may worry investors, its fundamental developments and growing institutional interest suggest a promising future.\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "title": "Ethereum's Future: Breakthrough or Bust? - Miami Dolphins - Dolphins Talk",
        "content": "Does Ethereum Have A Future?\n\nIn the fast-paced world of cryptocurrencies, Ethereum stands out. But many wonder, does it have a future?\n\nA system eliminating the need for traditional intermediaries through Ethereum\u2019s smart contracts. With the introduction of Ethereum 2.0, there\u2019s talk of greater speed, efficiency, and a smaller environmental footprint. This change signifies a substantial shift.\n\nHowever, challenges persist, including slow transactions, energy demands, and intense competition. Can Ethereum maintain its relevance in the ever-evolving blockchain sphere?\n\nIn this exploration, we\u2019re taking a straightforward look at Ethereum\u2019s capabilities, the shifts in technology, and trends to understand whether this key player in the digital currency space can continue its trajectory of influence.\n\nLet\u2019s explore what the future may hold for Ethereum!\n\nUnderstanding Ethereum\u2019s Core\n\nTo grasp the potential future of Ethereum casino, comprehending its foundational principles is essential. Ethereum extends beyond the simple notion of cryptocurrency, offering a broader technological platform with unique features that have captivated developers and innovators worldwide.\n\nLet\u2019s break down the core components and functionalities that define Ethereum.\n\nWhat is Ethereum?\n\nEthereum is an open-source, blockchain-based platform that enables the creation of decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts. Unlike traditional applications, dApps don\u2019t require a middleman to function or manage user information, which means they connect users and providers directly.\n\nSmart Contracts:\n\nAt the heart of Ethereum are smart contracts, self-executing contracts with the terms directly written into code. They automatically perform actions when predefined conditions are met without requiring intermediaries or external enforcement mechanisms. This trustless environment creates countless possibilities for unmediated interaction, making these contracts a revolutionary aspect of blockchain technology.\n\nEthereum Virtual Machine (EVM):\n\nThe Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is the runtime environment that processes smart contracts and allows the execution of scripts in the Ethereum network. It\u2019s Turing complete, meaning it can solve any computational problem, given enough time and memory. The EVM executes the script through a distributed node network, ensuring redundancy and reliability.\n\nEther \u2013 Fuel for the Network:\n\nEther (ETH) is Ethereum\u2019s native cryptocurrency. It compensates participant nodes for computations performed and as a transaction fee for users who want to change applications, execute smart contracts, or transfer tokens. This prevents the network from being cluttered with unnecessary transactions or suffering from potential DDOS attacks.\n\nDecentralized Applications (dApps):\n\nEthereum\u2019s crypto casino platform enables developers to build dApps that run on its blockchain. These applications can range from games to social networks, financial systems, and more, all operating on a decentralized network, meaning any governing entity does not control them. This fosters a new wave of transparency and resistance to censorship on the internet.\n\nScalability Concerns in Ethereum\n\nEthereum garners attention and becomes a hub for various decentralized applications and financial transactions. Its network faces a critical challenge: scalability. Understanding this hurdle requires diving into what scalability means, why it\u2019s pivotal, and how it\u2019s currently a bottleneck for Ethereum\u2019s potential full-scale adoption.\n\nDefining Scalability:\n\nIn blockchain technology, scalability refers to a network\u2019s capacity to handle a growing amount of work and its potential to be enlarged to accommodate that growth. For Ethereum, this means processing more transactions per second at lower costs, ensuring the network remains fast and affordable as it grows. This scalability is crucial, especially for sectors like crypto casinos, which require rapid, cost-effective transactions to manage the high volume of user activities efficiently and financial dealings inherent in such platforms.\n\nThe Bottleneck Issue:\n\nEthereum, like many blockchain platforms, struggles with a scalability issue. Currently, it can process only a handful of transactions per second. As the number of transactions on the network increases, the time it takes to confirm transactions also rises, leading to a congested network. This limitation is a significant concern because it restricts the platform\u2019s usefulness for global systems requiring fast and numerous transactions.\n\nGas Fees and Network Congestion:\n\nWhen the network becomes congested, users compete to have their transactions processed faster by offering higher \u201cgas fees\u201d (transaction fees). This competition leads to a surge in transaction costs, making Ethereum less attractive, especially for smaller, everyday transactions. It\u2019s akin to a traffic jam where road space is auctioned to the highest bidder, leading to high travel costs.\n\nImpact on dApps Functionality:\n\nFor dApps developers, scalability issues mean their applications can\u2019t operate efficiently under high traffic. Slow transactions and high fees could lead users to alternative platforms with better performance, affecting not just individual dApps but the entire Ethereum ecosystem if the trend becomes widespread.\n\nComparison with Traditional Systems:\n\nWhen compared to traditional financial service systems like Visa or PayPal, Ethereum falls short in transaction speed and efficiency. These conventional systems can handle thousands of transactions per second, while Ethereum\u2019s current structure allows for about 30. This disparity highlights the need for significant improvements if Ethereum aims to compete with or replace traditional systems.\n\nEthereum 2.0 \u2013 A Beacon of Hope\n\nEthereum 2.0 marks a fundamental shift in the Ethereum network\u2019s architecture, aiming to address the scalability, security, and sustainability issues currently limiting its predecessor. This ambitious upgrade stands as a beacon of hope for developers, investors, and users who believe in Ethereum\u2019s potential. Let\u2019s dissect what Ethereum 2.0 entails and why it\u2019s considered the much-needed next phase for this blockchain platform.\n\nThe Transition to Proof of Stake (PoS):\n\nOne of the most significant changes in Ethereum 2.0 is the shift from the energy-intensive Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism to Proof of Stake (PoS). Unlike PoW, which requires massive computational work and energy, PoS secures the network and validates transactions based on how many coins participants are holding and willing to \u201cstake\u201d for the process. This not only dramatically reduces the energy requirement but also incentivizes users to maintain network security.\n\nShard Chains and Scalability:\n\nTo tackle scalability, Ethereum 2.0 introduces shard chains, which are smaller chains that run parallel to the main Ethereum chain. Each shard chain handles its own transactions and smart contracts, meaning the network can process several transactions simultaneously, significantly increasing its capacity. This parallel processing power could potentially propel Ethereum\u2019s transaction throughput to match or even surpass traditional financial networks.\n\nThe Beacon Chain \u2013 Coordination at its Core:\n\nThe Beacon Chain is a central part of Ethereum 2.0, coordinating the network, keeping track of validators, and ensuring smooth communication between shard chains. It employs PoS to select validators responsible for storing data, processing transactions, and adding new blocks to the chain. This foundational layer is crucial for the new Ethereum\u2019s functionality and efficiency.\n\nEnhanced Security:\n\nWith Ethereum 2.0, security is set to improve. The PoS model decreases the likelihood of attacks on the network, as it makes potential attacks exceedingly expensive to carry out. The more decentralized nature of PoS, coupled with the new shard chain architecture, also contributes to a more secure network.\n\nSustainability and Energy Efficiency:\n\nBy abandoning the PoW mechanism, Ethereum 2.0 will significantly reduce its environmental impact. The new PoS system requires far less electricity, addressing one of the most urgent criticisms of cryptocurrency networks and aligning with growing demands for sustainable and eco-friendly technology.\n\nConclusion : Ethereum\u2019s Path Forward: Overcoming Challenges and Embracing Potential\n\nEthereum has problems like limited capacity and high energy use, with competition from other systems. Yet, with Ethereum 2.0, it\u2019ll use less energy and handle more transactions faster.\n\nIts large community, role in DeFi, and leadership in NFTs suggest it\u2019s here for the long haul. It\u2019s hard to know the future in the rapid world of digital money, but Ethereum adapts well and remains strong.\n\nIts continuous updates, diverse user trust, and importance indicate that Ethereum is a lasting part of blockchain\u2019s growth, not a passing phase."

        "content": "Lido, the largest liquid staking service provider on Ethereum, is approaching 33% market dominance. This state of affairs has raised concerns about centralization and the protocol being a threat to Ethereum\u2019s security.\n\nAt the time of writing, Lido\u2019s staking market share sits at 31.76%. This means that of all the staked ether on Ethereum, almost one-third of it is staked with Lido.\n\nDanny Ryan, an Ethereum Foundation researcher, noted in a 2022 blog post that if a liquid staking derivative (LSD) exceeds the 33% threshold, it has the theoretical capability to manipulate block space, potentially creating an economic monopoly.\n\nThis sentiment is shared by the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s Mike Neuder, who identified in a blog post three possible attack vectors on the network: holders of Lido\u2019s stETH product, node operators who run validators for the network, and Lido\u2019s DAO.\n\nOf the three, Neuder said the DAO presents the greatest risk, writing that the \u201csoft power\u201d held by DAO members would allow them undue influence over the protocol.\n\nIn a series of interviews, Blockworks spoke with those who\u2019ve raised the alarm that Lido\u2019s dominance may be a pernicious force, as well as members of the Lido development team who argue that the threats to Ethereum\u2019s economic security are overstated.\n\nRead more: Lido Finance drops Solana staking after DAO decision\n\nWhy Lido might present cause for concern\n\nLido DAO\u2019s largest token holders include several funds. Paradigm holds 7% of the total supply of LDO, Lido\u2019s governance token, making it the second-biggest whale, according to a dashboard from Arkham Intelligence. FalconX and Dragonfly Capital are also among the top holders of LDO.\n\nIan Unsworth, contributor to the liquid staking firm Stride, said the funds holding Lido (LDO) tokens are unlikely to liquidate their positions or maliciously attack the DAO. Still, investment funds have to return value to clients, and value creation could, someday, theoretically conflict with the principles of Ethereum.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, you should probably assume everyone is a profit maxi,\u201d Unsworth said. \u201cPeople aren\u2019t going to [govern the DAO] because they like the ethos.\u201d\n\nIf profit maximization means passing proposals meant to degrade Ethereum for personal gain, the DAO is not equipped to stop it, according to Nixo, the pseudonymous executive director of EthStaker.\n\nDAO members typically delegate votes to larger holders, meaning proposals can pass without much attention. This could lead to under-the-radar misdeeds, Nixo said.\n\n\u201cIt could be Apple knocking on the door and saying, \u2018Hey, we would really like to push this [proposal] through in some sort of clandestine way,\u2019\u201d Nixo said, adding that nefarious DAO actors could also punish node operators who act against their wishes.\n\nNotably, the damage Lido\u2019s ability to censor transactions or attack Ethereum grows at 50% and 66% of staked validator share, according to Ryan\u2019s blog post. Nixo said hitting 33% dominance would signal to potential bad actors that higher thresholds are possible without excessive community pushback.\n\nEven if Lido\u2019s DAO is composed of model Ethereans, growing dominance from the liquid staking provider threatens one of the network\u2019s chief value propositions \u2014 its censorship resistance.\n\n\u201c[Lido dominance] erodes the credible neutrality of Ethereum, which in turn devalues Ethereum itself,\u201d Kevin Weaver, a backend engineer at Metropolis, said.\n\nLido\u2019s response to centralization concerns\n\nKasper Rasmussen, a Lido Community Contributor, told Blockworks that Lido itself is an intermediary layer that facilitates interaction between Ethereum users and transparent, well-known Node Operators (NOs).\n\n\u201cThis process is underpinned by a network of 37 legitimate and autonomous NOs. These NOs are not only geographically dispersed, but each of them individually holds less than 1.5% of the total staked assets,\u201d Rasmussen said.\n\nBroader community governance will be achieved through the development of dual governance, Rasmussen said. Dual governance means LDO holders are not the only ones with governing power \u2014 Lido staked ether (stETH) holders can apply veto to votes if they choose to.\n\nThis means it\u2019s possible for stETH holders to engage in protocol governance without holding LDO tokens.\n\n\u201cThis ensures the protocol remains transparent, accountable and representative of the entire user base,\u201d Rasmussen said.\n\nThe Lido team is also working to expand the Lido Protocol\u2019s validator set. In September, it onboarded seven new node operators, Rasmussen noted.\n\n\u201cThis diversification serves as a protective measure against any single entity gaining control,\u201d he said.\n\nLido as an \u2018ideal\u2019 villain for Ethereum?\n\nEnshrining liquid staking decentralization in the protocol\u2019s code has generated buzz in Ethereum circles. Enshrinement could theoretically implement protocol updates that would make it impossible for liquid staking to become overly centralized.\n\nLido\u2019s DAO also considered, and ultimately rejected, a proposal that would have self-limited its staking dominance.\n\nWhether the solution to Lido dominance is reached through social pressure or by code updates, Lido says it is taking steps to stay aligned with Ethereum\u2019s ethos. For this reason, Nixo said Lido is an \u201cideal actor to be in the villain position\u201d on Ethereum.\n\nRead more: Ethereum is \u2018much more centralized than folks realize\u2019: Blocknative\u2019s Matt Cutler\n\n\u201cThis is highlighting a problem that the Ethereum protocol has \u2014 it\u2019s not a problem of an evil actor coming in,\u201d Nixo said. \u201cSo in a way this is good that this is happening\u2026the fact that ideas like that are coming to the surface in light of this debate from all sorts of sources is exactly what this social layer is meant to elicit.\u201d\n\nUpdated Oct. 20, 2023 at 11:30 am ET: A previous version of this article attributed information to \u201cthe company\u201d instead of a \u201cLido contributor.\u201d\n\nUpdated Oct. 20, 2023 at 11:12 am ET: Clarified for additional context.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction as ETH Drops Below $1,700 \u2013 Will ETH Keep Falling?\n\nSource: TradingView\n\nThe Ethereum price has dipped by 1% today, with its fall to $1,653 coming amid a similar loss for the cryptocurrency market as a whole.\n\nETH is now down by 2% in a week and by 10% in the last 30 days, with the market\u2019s biggest altcoin remaining up by 38% since the beginning of the year.\n\nGiven the uncertain state of the wider market (especially in relation to ongoing regulatory actions), it remains possible that ETH could slip a little further in the coming days, especially when it has recently fallen below the key support levels of $1,800 and then $1,700.\n\nHowever, ETH\u2019s solid fundamentals will ultimately translate into a recovery somewhere down the line, especially when Ethereum continues to attract more adoption than the vast majority of its rivals.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction as ETH Drops Below $1,700 \u2013 Will ETH Keep Falling?\n\nEthereum now looks very close to hitting a bottom, with its indicators running out of space to fall and looking as though they could turn positive at any minute.\n\nSource: TradingView\n\nMost notably, the coin\u2019s 30-day moving average (yellow) has dropped below its 200-day average (blue), forming a \u2018death cross\u2019 that can signal more losses in the short-term.\n\nHowever, such a cross is often a necessary precondition of any significant rebound and recovery, with ETH\u2019s relative strength index (purple) also in a low position that should lead to fresh rallies anytime soon.\n\nSuch rallies may not follow immediately, however, sine ETH\u2019s support level (green) has repeatedly failed to hold up against repeated selling pressure, having dropped below the all-important $1,800 last week\n\nThis fall below $1,800 created a weakness that resulted in ETH then dropping below $1,700, implying that it may also struggle to resist a fall below $1,600."

        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction \u2013 Can ETH Hit $10,000 in the Next Bull Market?\n\nEthereum (ETH) has had a challenging time recovering in the bear market of 2022, with multiple unsuccessful attempts to reach highs above $2,000 since its decline to $879 in June. However, the current bullish green candle may indicate that Ethereum is finding support from a triangle pattern as outlined in Wednesday\u2019s article.\n\nEthereum is currently being traded at $1,197 as investors consider which cryptocurrencies to include in their portfolios for 2023. A break above the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $1,255 could potentially attract more buyers to the market.\n\nETH/USD daily chart\n\nFor now, Ethereum\u2019s price must prove to investors that it can hold above immediate resistance at $1,200 and keep off declines to $1,100 and $1,000. Analysts seem to be having conflicting predictions for 2023, with some forecasting a sideways trend and the most bullish hoping to see the Ethereum price above $4,000 by the end of 2023.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction: $10,000 ETH Incoming?\n\nEthereum is a renowned blockchain platform that has revolutionized the cryptocurrency space, with the introduction of smart contracts in 2015.\n\nThe second-largest cryptocurrency\u2019s utility continues to grow exponentially, especially with the transition to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. According to the author of Cryptocurrency Investing For Dummies, Kiana Danial, Ethereum\u2019s value could be attributed to the problems it solves.\n\n\u201cEthereum is valuable because of the problem that it solves, because of the size of its platform, and the number of people who use it to create their own apps.\u201d\n\nIt is difficult to visualize how vast the Ethereum ecosystem is until you learn that the blockchain platform holds over 44 million smart contracts.\n\nThe highly anticipated Shanghai upgrade in Q1 2023 will introduce mechanisms to bring down gas fees and support scaling through the sharding technology.\n\nAs well as this, Ethereum reached more than 200 million unique addresses this week, according to Etherscan.\n\nThe stats above show how valuable the Ethereum platform is and affirm the potential for a spike to $10,000.\n\nIndeed, just last week, a Bloomberg analyst predicted that ETH would outperform BTC in 2023 due to its fundamentals.\n\nWhat Would Take Ethereum Price to Hit $10,000?\n\nEthereum price has been facing a steep uphill battle in its efforts to break free from the dominant bearish trend that has persisted throughout 2022.\n\nMany analysts believe that it is next to impossible for the cryptocurrency to reach $10,000 within the next 12 months. However, it is important to remember that anything is possible in the world of cryptocurrency.\n\nCurrently, Ethereum is attempting to lift itself above the $1,200 mark and the 50-day Exponential Moving Average. It is worth noting that Ether has fallen more than 75% from its all-time high of $4,878 in November 2021, meaning that it would need to experience a bullish move of around 700% to reach the $10,000 mark.\n\nWhile this may seem unlikely, it is worth noting that Ethereum has experienced gains of more than 700% several times in the past. For example, in the last cycle, Ethereum went from around $80 to $4,800.\n\nThe current macroeconomic conditions and the dynamics of the cryptocurrency market are different from those of 2021 and 2017, making it difficult to predict whether Ethereum will be able to rise against the odds and reach $10,000.\n\nHowever, the important upcoming upgrades to Ethereum have the potential to significantly improve the network\u2019s scalability and capacity. If these upgrades go well, then strong bullish momentum may return to ETH and see it hitting $10,000 and above in the coming years.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nIs Ethereum price able to hit $10,000 by the end of 2023? Yes. But it is unlikely.\n\nThe Shanghai upgrade in Q1 2023 will have a positive impact on ETH prices if it goes well.\n\nInvestors are to get access to staked ETH for the first time in Q1 2023.\n\nEthereum developers to start working toward sharding with the Shanghai upgrade.\n\nPromising Altcoins to Consider for 2023\n\nCrypto markets are in a downtrend, but new altcoins with promising outlooks and presale early bird access may help investors recoup losses from the crypto winter. Here are some coins with huge potential in 2023.\n\nFightOut (FGHT) \u2013 Presale Launches\n\nFightOut, a brand-new move-to-earn (M2E) fitness application and gym chain that seeks to bring the fitness lifestyle into web3, has opened its pre-sale and investors think the project could transform the existing web3 M2E landscape.\n\nWhile existing M2E applications such as STEPN only track steps and require expensive non-fungible token (NFT) buy-ins to take part, FightOut takes a more holistic approach to tracking and rewarding its users for their exercise and activity, and doesn\u2019t require any expensive buy-ins to take part.\n\nFightOut\u2019s FGHT tokens are currently selling for 60.06 per 1 USDT, and interested investors are encouraged to move fast to secure their tokens, with the pre-sale having already raised nearly $2.45 million in just a few days. FGHT is the token that will power the FightOut crypto ecosystem.\n\nVisit FightOut Now\n\nDash 2 Trade (D2T) \u2013 Presale Enters Final Stage\n\nThose interested in investing in a promising crypto trading platform start-up should look no further than Dash 2 Trade. The up-and-coming analytics and social trading platform hopes to take the crypto trading space by storm with its host of unique features.\n\nThese include trading signals, social sentiment and on-chain indicators, a pre-sale token scoring system, a token listing alert system and a strategy back-testing tool. Dash 2 Trade\u2019s ecosystem will be powered by the D2T token, which users will need to buy and hold in order to access the platform\u2019s features.\n\nDash 2 Trade is currently conducting a token pre-sale at highly discounted rates and sales recently surpassed $11.2 million. The pre-sale dashboard is going to be released soon, with the development team currently running ahead of schedule. Tokens are currently selling for $0.0533 each and will be listed on multiple centralized exchanges in under one month.\n\nVisit Dash 2 Trade here\n\nC+Charge (CCHG)\n\nThe current electric vehicle (EV) charging system is inadequate maid issues such as lack of standardization. On the other hand, the carbon credits industry, which is projected to be worth $2.44 trillion by 2027 is dominated by big corporations like Tesla, locking out individuals who drive EVs.\n\nHowever, C+Charge hopes to drastically change the narrative by building a blockchain-based Peer-to-Peer (P2P) payment system for EV charging stations that will allow the drivers of electric vehicles (EVs) to earn carbon credits.\n\nUsers on C+Charge will be able to pay to charge their vehicles with CCHG, the token powering the ecosystem and earn carbon credits \u2013 stored in an app. C+Charge presale launched recently with $37k raised so far. Investors can buy 1 CCHG for 0.013 USDT, but the price will soon shoot to $0.0165 USDT.\n\nVisit C+Charge Now.\n\nRelated Articles"

        "content": "Reddit reportedly plans to discontinue its Ethereum (ETH)-based rewards program called Community Points by next month.\n\nCommunity Points allow Redditors who make high-quality contributions to the platform such as creating content and moderating to earn ERC-20 tokens that can be used to redeem badges, animated emoticons and other special features.\n\nAccording to Reddit, Community Points serve as a measure of a user\u2019s reputation in participating subreddits and give Redditors a chance to own a piece of their favorite communities.\n\nDespite high hopes for the program, TechCrunch reports that Reddit will say goodbye to Community Points by early November three years after launching the project in May 2020.\n\nReddit\u2019s director of consumer and product communications Tim Rathschmidt says Community Points faces two challenges that prompted the platform to phase out the program.\n\n\u201cThough we saw some future opportunities for Community Points, the resourcing needed was unfortunately too high to justify, The regulatory environment has since added to that effort. Though the moderators and communities that supported Community Points have been incredible partners \u2014 as it\u2019s evolved, the product is no longer set up to scale.\u201d\n\nAfter launching Community Points, Reddit also rolled out other incentive systems, which include the Contributor Program that allows eligible users to convert their Reddit gold and karma into cash.\n\nRathschmidt says Reddit will prioritize community rewards programs that are less difficult to scale.\n\n\u201cPart of why we\u2019re moving past this product is that we\u2019ve already launched, or are actively investing in, several products that accomplish what the Community Points program was trying to accomplish while being easier to adopt and understand.\u201d\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Demand for Ethereum Staking has Dropped Significantly \u2013 What\u2019s Going On?\n\nSource: Adobe\n\nEthereum (ETH), the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency, is experiencing a notable drop in demand for staking, leading to the clearing out of its once-crowded validator queue.\n\nEthereum\u2019s transition to a proof-of-stake (PoS) network, marked by the \u201cShapella\u201d upgrade in April, had sparked significant interest in staking, with a peak of over 96,000 validators waiting to join the network in early June.\n\nHowever, data now shows just 257 validators in the queue, marking the lowest count since the transition to PoS.\n\nSource: Validatorqueue.com\n\nThe reduction in queue size has led to a significant decrease in the waiting time to become a validator, down to less than five hours.\n\nSource: Validatorqueue.com\n\nSeveral factors behind reduction in staking demand\n\nThe decline in demand for Ethereum staking can be attributed to several factors, according to analysts that commented on CoinDesk.\n\nNotably, staking rewards have dropped from 5%-6% earlier this year to around 3.5%, primarily due to tepid network activity in generating fee-related revenues and an increasing number of stakers.\n\nWhat this means is that the returns on staking have become less attractive compared to other traditional investment options, such as money market funds and U.S. Treasury bills, which offer returns exceeding 5%.\n\nEthereum\u2019s staking ratio, which measures the proportion of tokens staked in the network relative to its total supply, has increased from 15% in April to over 22%.\n\nHowever, this figure still lags behind other PoS networks like Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), and Avalanche (AVAX).\n\nThe reason for this is that Ethereum\u2019s native token, ETH, is primarily used as a \u201cnetwork resource\u201d and because Ethereum has \u201ca more distributed shareholder base\u201d than the other networks, one analyst said."

        "content": "Here\u2019s Why Ethereum Price Can Reach $5k in 2023, and Love Hate Inu Will Raise $10 Million\n\nThe primary token in the world\u2019s largest smart contract ecosystem, Ethereum has topped $2,100 for the first time since May. Ethereum price blasted through resistance at $2,000 following a successful Shapella upgrade, previously referred to as Shanghai, on April 12.\n\nBoth Bitcoin and Ethereum have continued to surpass investor expectations since the beginning of the year and particularly after emerging stronger during the banking crisis in the United States.\n\nThree crypto-friendly banks collapsed in March including Silvergate Bank, Signature Bank, and Silicon Valley Bank (SVB). Since then, regulators have been on a sprint to provide oversight, a situation that is troubling many crypto-based companies that are unable to find banking partners.\n\nEthereum Price Doubles Down On the Uptrend\n\nEthereum price holds slightly above $2,100 on Saturday, with its uptrend mainly supported by the Shapella upgrade. A daily close above this level is required for bulls to maintain the lead relative to bearish advances.\n\nSuch a move coupled with the optimistic outlook from the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) implies that the path with the least resistance is to the upside.\n\nETH/USD daily chart\n\nCurrently, all eyes are glued on resistance at $2,000 because if broken, it would propel Ethereum price to $2,400, or higher.\n\nThe hype around the beginning of a bull market is driving investors into the market in droves. Often this fear of missing out (FOMO) helps to build momentum during up-trending markets.\n\nCan Ethereum Reach $5,000 in 2023\n\nEthereum price is suitably positioned to rally following its remarkable performance since the beginning of the year. This week\u2019s spike above $2,000 confirmed the initial stages of a bull market.\n\nIts older sibling, Bitcoin blasted above $30,000 changing the technical outlook for a potential rally to $38,000 in the coming few weeks. In addition to the momentum surrounding the Shapella upgrade, Ethereum price tends to follow in Bitcoin\u2019s footsteps.\n\nA massive rally in Ethereum price to $5,000 will only happen if many boxes are checked in the market in the coming months. For instance, Ether must hold the new support at $2,000 at all costs.\n\nHowever, this cannot be guaranteed even with a successful Shapella upgrade, which allowed investors who staked ETH to withdraw their tokens and the rewards earned, for the first time since the network transitioned to become a proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol.\n\nWhales must keep their bags intact if not keep demand for Ethereum rising. Another huge factor to consider is the regulatory landscape in the industry."

        "content": "Ethereum has long been the target of criticism from die-hard Bitcoin maximalists who believe that Bitcoin is the only worthwhile cryptocurrency despite the fact that Ethereum holds the second-highest percentage of the entire cryptocurrency market value.\n\nNow, another Bitcoin maximalist, Steve Barbour, has referred to the leading platform for smart contracts as garbage.\n\nBitcoin Maximalist Makes Controversial Claim About Ethereum\n\nIn a social media post on X, the prominent Bitcoin enthusiast recently called Ethereum \u201cgarbage\u201d and said it has no future. His argument essentially boils down to Ethereum failing to attract investors from the free market and nothing else.\n\nEthereum is garbage. The free market doesn\u2019t want it and the captured market still can\u2019t figure out what it is for. \u2014 Steve Barbour (@SGBarbour) October 16, 2023\n\nBarbour is the founder of Upstream Data, a mining infrastructure company building off-grid Bitcoin mining rigs. His claim comes behind the heels of Ethereum staking rewards falling to new lows.\n\nThe number of Ethereum in staking pools has been steadily growing over the past few months; however, this has not been accompanied by increased profitability. According to CoinGecko, liquid staking protocols accounted for 43.7% of the total 26.4 million ETH staked in August 2023.\n\nThe annual percentage yield (APY) from ETH staking has decreased over the years, going from 18% in 2020 to 3% in October. Since 2022, these protocols have paid out 100,000 ETH in quarterly incentives for staking, but the low APY has led many investors to question if staking ETH is still worthwhile.\n\nBarbour and other Bitcoin maximalists claim that Ethereum is not as decentralized as Bitcoin, particularly given that the blockchain has recently moved from proof-of-work to a proof-of-stake consensus process.\n\nMost of them believe that Bitcoin is the sole \u201ctrue\u201d cryptocurrency and that all other cryptocurrencies are worthless. Bitcoin maximalists have also been critical of other cryptocurrencies apart from Ethereum. Max Kaiser, another strong supporter of Bitcoin, has lately asserted that XRP is centralized.\n\nETH price remains firmly above $1,500 | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nResponses And Reactions\n\nEthereum has proven itself to be more than garbage, as evident in its vast number of supporters and large ecosystem. However, some supporters of Bitcoin agreed with the maximalist.\n\nAgreed. It\u2019s full of speculators \u2014 Carnival_Poe (@Carnival_Poe) October 17, 2023\n\nThe free market has Ethereum now at $1,550. ETH has witnessed a 1.65% drop in price in the past 24 hours, and it continues to stay weaker against Bitcoin.\n\nOn the other hand, Bitcoin has increased in dominance against altcoins. Most of the money and attention has flowed into Bitcoin, and the crypto has witnessed a 6.39% increase in the past seven days.\n\nAs a result, ETH bulls have struggled to push above $1,600 and the crypto is now trading around the $1,550 support zone. If bulls fail to hold this level, it could start another decline to as low as $1,430.\n\nFeatured image from Forbes, chart from Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Share:\n\nSolana's energy consumption is at 658 joules per transaction against Ethereum's higher energy usage, sparking debate over which network works better.\n\nEthereum's robust developer community gives an advantage to the chain.\n\nThe two chains compete over scalability and intrinsic design constraints.\n\nCrypto developer who goes by the alias Ichigo on X, who is associated with Solana-based Helius Labs, has ignited another comparison between Ethereum and its smart chain competitor Solana. Ichigo pointed out that while the post-Merge Ethereum transactions use 144,000 joules of energy, Solana transactions require only 658 joules.\n\nSolana beats Ethereum in energy efficiency\n\nIchigo underscored Solana's energy efficiency by stating, \"The average Solana transaction uses 658 Joules of energy. That\u2019s less than a Google search. Few.\"\n\nYes because Solana is a single-threaded global state machine that's subject to fluctuating gas costs\n\n\n\nEthereum has inherent design limitations, which is why they had to move to the more modular approach of L2s. Solana was designed from the ground up with scalability in mind. It's\u2026 \u2014 Ichigo | helius.dev (@0xIchigo) October 18, 2023\n\nBoth Ethereum and Solana rely on proof-of-stake methods, which are considered more environmentally efficient. Therefore, they are often pitted against each other.\n\nIn terms of energy emissions, Solana Foundation became the first chain ever to allow real-term emission measurement earlier this year. Between April 2022 and March 2023, it reported that its 2,390 block-producing nodes had a total carbon footprint in the average emissions term of 10,651.2 tonnes CO2. Therefore, the energy per transaction comes to a mere 879 joules in the said time frame, close to the recent claims by Ichigo.\n\nBased on data provided by the Ethereum Foundation, an estimated 2,601 megawatt hour is the requirement by the network in terms of electricity, leaving carbon emissions of 870 tonnes CO2.\n\nEthereum there for the \u201clong haul\u201d\n\nDespite Solana's dominance in energy efficiency, Ichigo emphasized Ethereum's resilience and significance as a major player.\n\n\"Ethereum will be around for the long haul - there are too many smart people working on it,\" Ichigo added in response to a user.\n\nThe influencer underlined that the involvement of developers and substantial financial activity within the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) makes it a long-term player. However, he anticipates that Ethereum may struggle with scaling compared to Solana given its single-threaded global state machine and fluctuating gas prices, making it less suitable for payment or decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.\n\nThe debate brings up the concept of modularity versus monolithic technology stacks, with Ichigo arguing that Solana's ground-up scalability-focused design contrasts with Ethereum's modular approach. This essentially has to do with how chains are built by taking into account speed, efficiency and flexibility.\n\nIn terms of support for decentralized finance applications, Solana dominates less than 1% of the total value locked in the crypto space. Meanwhile, Ethereum still dominates 53% of total TVL based on DeFiLlama data. While Ethereum supports 935 protocols, Solana houses 112 despite a rough year of public outages.\n\nAs per Token Terminal data, in the last 30 days, code commits that signify developer activity for Ethereum is at 1.28K while Solana is at 542.\n\nNonetheless, Solana has showcased its own strength with 81.49k daily active users over a 30-day average. Yet, it is still far from Ethereum's 324.21k daily active users.\n\nAn intriguing investment trend emerges, as Ethereum, despite its dominance, reports negative year-to-date flows amounting to $111 million based on CoinShares' last report. Contrarily, Solana attracted positive inflows of $59 million during the same timeframe.\n\nThis disparity signals a shift in investor preference to Solana. However, Ethereum maintains its position as the second-largest cryptocurrency with a circulating market cap of $188.59 billion, with Solana far behind at $9.93 billion.\n\n\n\nSOL/ETH YTD chart\n\nIn the comparison between Solana and Ethereum, Solana emerges as the more energy-efficient network, with its carbon footprint and transaction energy usage significantly lower than that of Ethereum. However, Ethereum remains a formidable player, thanks to its strong developer community and substantial financial activity behind it. However, it might face scalability challenges compared to Solana, making the choice between the two networks dependent on specific use cases."

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nEthereum cofounder Vitalik Buterin has shared new revelations that show a possible integration with artificial intelligence (AI) in the mid- to long term. Responding to community members in an ask-me-anything (AMA) session hosted on the decentralized social protocol Warpcast, Buterin said AI remains one of the thoughts that has filled his mind for the past two weeks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile Vitalik Buterin was not detailed about the specific things he thought about, he said he is considering the ways in which the Ethereum community could productively engage on AI-related issues. Some of the issues he highlighted include X-risk, a concept that showcases how humanity can be harmed on a massive global scale.\n\nIn recent times, proponents have been citing how possible Blockchain technology can coexist with AI. Drawing on the revolutionary technology underpinning both concepts, a combination of AI and blockchain has been tipped as a futuristic solution to some of the world's biggest challenges to date.\n\nWhile there are a number of crypto projects exploring AI solutions to date, Buterin's assertion of the concept lends another perspective, considering the role he plays in the broader digital currency ecosystem. The possible timeline of any potential engagement was not revealed, and from his actions, we might expect a detailed blog post in this regard in the future.\n\nGrowth of AI-based projects\n\nSome of the blockchain protocols pioneering AI initiatives include Cardano-backed SingularityNET and Render Network, to mention a few.\n\nThe value propositions for these projects differ, and while SingularityNET is building the first decentralized AI network that allows anyone to create, share and monetize AI services at scale, Render is a distributed GPU rendering network that connects artists and studios in need of GPU compute powers with mining partners.\n\nBoth protocols maintain a very robust token economy, and their growth over time highlights growing interest in AI-focused crypto projects."

Polkadot\u2019s (DOT) decentralization shift, Ethereum (ETH) whale behavior, and market trends can also offer insights for investors. NuggetRush creators are bullish on NUGX, expecting price increases on launch.\n\nNuggetRush adds utility to meme coins\n\nNuggetRush\u2019s fundamentals and low market capitalization can support growth in the long haul. This could explain why experts are bullish on NUGX.\n\nWhile its memetic appeal has attracted a dedicated following, NuggetRush will be primarily driven by its play-to-earn (P2E) functionality. As a P2E meme coin, NUGX, its native utility and governance token, will serve as the backbone of the gaming ecosystem.\n\nYou might also like: Pepe hype ends, NuggetRush aims to take over meme coin scene in 2023\n\nIn addition to offering opportunities for artisanal miners in underdeveloped areas, NuggetRush is a player-driven non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace that can offer exclusive benefits. To illustrate, RUSHGEM NFTs can be exchanged for real gold, which adds tangible value to digital assets.\n\nThe project\u2019s roadmap can help cement NUGX\u2019s position in the meme coin scene. Notable developments include NuggetRush\u2019s decentralized exchange (DEX) launch, smart contract renouncement, and community ownership transfer.\n\nNuggetRush is currently in the initial round of its presale, where NUGX is available for $0.01. By the end of the presale and on listing, NUGX could rise to $0.02. However, analysts expect even more growth by the end of the year.\n\nPolkadot decentralizing, DOT is down\n\nOn Oct. 12, 2023, Parity Technologies, the developer of Polkadot, announced strategic shifts towards decentralizing the network.\n\nThis move aims to improve the developer experience and foster a strong developer community, leading to organizational changes in the near future.\n\nWhile Polkadot is a significant player in crypto, its native currency, DOT, has been under pressure. Prices fell from $4.02 to $3.68 last week due to market volatility.\n\nYou might also like: Parity Technologies decentralizes teams in Polkadot, refutes layoff rumors\n\nDespite reaching a low not seen since November 2020, the Q3 report for Polkadot reveals unexpected improvements. The first notable point was that there are 663 million DOT staked, a 14.7% quarterly increase.\n\nIn connection with this growth, Santiment data reveals that Polkadot had the second-highest development activity in the last 30 days. As Polkadot bolsters its network capabilities, DOT could surge to $4.86 by the close of 2023.\n\nEthereum whales exit; ETH is stable\n\nAccording to analyst Ali Martinez, crypto whales have been actively selling their ETH holdings in 2023.\n\nSince February, Ethereum whales have sold or reallocated over 5 million ETH, worth approximately $8.5B, with no signs of slowing down.\n\nYou might also like: Atomic Wallet collaborates with blockchain experts to counter security threat\n\nEthereum surged to $1,750 in early October before retracing below $1,600. As of Oct. 17, ETH was trading at $1,590.\n\nInvestors buying the dip are expected to drive Ethereum\u2019s bullish momentum, pushing it above $1,750 by the end of 2023. However, if bears dominate, ETH may fall to $1,525.\n\nDisclosure: This content is provided by a third party. crypto.news does not endorse any product mentioned on this page.

Ethereum price had pulled back to trade at $1,594 at the time of writing with support around $1,500 expected to absorb the growing selling pressure.\n\nEthereum Price Primed for A Massive Breakout \u2013 Here\u2019re the Levels to Watch\n\nInvestors are anxiously waiting for the Federal Reserve decision on interest rate hikes and expect the regulator to continue with its strict measures to curb economic growth. However, market watchers are eyeing a 25-basis points increase, relatively lower than the December hike of 50-basis points.\n\nThis positive sentiment hails from a general inflation drop for December to 6.5% from 7.1% recorded for November. Although the drop is not big enough to see the Fed lift the foot off the gas pedal completely, it signals that the economy is headed in the right direction.\n\nCPI is an indicator for the Fed to either tighten its monetary measures used to combat inflation or loosen its grip \u2013 allowing markets to recover, especially those considered to have a high volatility index like digital assets.\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum price is still in a position to break out significantly despite the resistance at $1,680. Since the tentative support at $1,600 has already been infiltrated, ETH price might be forced to look down to $1,500 before the resumption of its uptrend. Based on the daily timeframe chart, the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) (in purple) solidifies support in that area.\n\nETH/USD daily chart\n\nAdding credence to the short-term bearish outlook in Ethereum price is a buy signal from the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator. The MACD line in blue confirmed the call to traders to offload their bags while locking in profits (shaking off weak hands) by flipping beneath the signal line in blue.\n\nDoctor Profit, analyst and trader on Twitter shared with his large following on Twitter that \u201cweak hands are getting shaken out, market awaits FOMC in two days.\u201d The analyst terms the pullback a \u201cfake dumb\u201d meant to \u201cshake out weak hands\u201d ahead of the next breakout in a few days."

        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction as $4.5 Billion Trading Volume Comes In \u2013 Where is the ETH Bottom?\n\nEthereum has a bearish outlook, which could lead to further price drops. It recently fell below the $1,200 level despite last week\u2019s positive price movements. There is a risk of it falling below the support level of a triangle pattern.\n\nIn the past 24 hours, trading volume for Ethereum increased by 23% to $4.5 billion. The cryptocurrency\u2019s market cap is $146 billion, having declined by 2% in the same time period.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction: How 2023 Could Be a Big Year For ETH\n\nEthereum has had a difficult year, with its value dropping 70.4% in one year and 75.5% from its all-time high.\n\nHowever, according to a popular crypto analyst, Guy of Coin Bureau, next year could be an exceptional year for the largest smart contracts token.\n\nGuy believes that the upcoming Ethereum Shanghai upgrade scheduled for Q1 2023 could lead to a bullish trend reversal for Ether. The analyst believes that the unlocking of billions of dollars worth of tokens from smart contracts will attract investors to stake their own tokens for a potentially stress-free investment experience.\n\n\u201cWhen they see that that ETH can in fact be unstaked and easily sold, then it might incentivize them to actually stake themselves. So, I really think it could go either way. Now, I wouldn\u2019t at all be surprised if it was slightly bearish in the short term if we do see some selling,\u201d said Guy in his Q&A video.\n\n\u201cI think the future for ETH is so, so bright, and I think Shanghai, assuming it goes off without a hitch as the Merge did, then I think 2023 could be a really big year for Ethereum and for ETH,\u201d Guy continued.\n\nAccording to a crypto expert, it is unlikely that Ethereum will reach five digits in 2023. Instead, Guy predicts a sideways trend for the cryptocurrency during the year.\n\nSimilarly, Rekt Capital, a pseudonymous crypto trader and analyst, told their 330k followers on Twitter that the Ethereum price must hold support at $1,062 to avert a possible drop to $843."

As a result, usage will inevitably move to competitors that are able to scale to meet the requirements of users. Justin Bons, founder and CIO of Cyber Capital, shared his opinion in X today, Oct. 20, 2023.\n\nETH is dropping the ball by failing to meet L1 demand\n\n\n\nUsage will inevitably move to competitors which can scale to meet demand\n\n\n\nWhether it is SOL's parallelization, XTZ's enshrined rollups, or full sharding like in EGLD, NEAR & TON\n\n\n\nETH will definitely lose if it does not scale! \u2014 Justin Bons (@Justin_Bons) October 20, 2023\n\nL1 competitors might rely on different scaling practices, including Solana's (SOL) parallelization or Tezos' (XTZ) enscrined rollups. Also, fully sharded blockchains like The Open Network (TON), NEAR Protocol (NEAR) and MultiversX (EGLD) might be dangerous competitors for Ethereum (ETH).\n\nSharding is a scaling practice that allows the blockchain to be split up among the ecosystem of interconnected sub-blockchains (shards).\n\nSharding is an endgame goal for Ethereum (ETH) on proof of stake, but it is still unclear when (and if) it is going to implement it.\n\nNEAR Protocol (NEAR) is recognized as the first-ever fully sharded mainstream blockchain.

Also, he warns that security budget of the largest blockchain is on borrowed time.\n\nMeanwhile, one of the largest EVM blockchains, Polygon (MATIC), accomplished a major milestone on its road to the Polygon 2.0 phase. In this phase, staking and security mechanisms in blockchain will be reconsidered.

        "content": "Ethereum, the token fueling the world\u2019s leading smart contracts platform, is consolidating its position at $1,800, as it eagerly awaits the release of crucial economic data.\n\nThe Ethereum price experienced a remarkable surge in March, mirroring Bitcoin\u2019s performance, before encountering resistance at $1,850.\n\nWith the weekend just hours away, ETH trades at $1,807, displaying impressive resilience.\n\nMarket watchers anticipate potential volatility in response to Friday\u2019s Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) data release, particularly as US stock markets prepare to open.\n\nThe PCE is a key inflation indicator utilized by the Federal Reserve to make key monetary policy decisions.\n\nIs Ethereum Ready To Take Down Pivotal $2,000 Resistance?\n\nEthereum price remains barely unchanged in 24 hours, although Bitcoin has lost nearly 2% of its value to trade at $28,230 at the time of writing.\n\nIf support at $1,800 holds despite the PCE data, ETH price could strengthen its bullish outlook over the weekend and grind closer to the psychological resistance at $2,000.\n\nETH/USD daily chart\n\nThe second-largest token in the market holds above all the applied major moving averages, starting with the 100-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) (line in blue), which has just flipped above the 200-day EMA (line in purple)\u2014in a move that could validate the anticipated climb to $2,000.\n\nThe 50-day EMA (line in red) at $1,665 is in line to help mitigate the selling pressure in the event of a reversal below $1,700.\n\nOn the same daily chart, the position of the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) suggests the path with the least resistance is now to the upside.\n\nAlthough the MACD is yet to validate a buy signal on the daily timeframe chart, its position above the mean line implies a bullish outcome is highly likely.\n\nOn the four-hour timeframe, Ethereum price has printed a bullish engulfing candle, targeting short-term resistance at $1,850.\n\nLike the daily chart, ETH sits above all the major applied moving averages \u2013 the 50 EMA, 100-day EMA, and 200-day EMA.\n\nETH/USD four-hour chart\n\nThe On-Balance-Volume (OBV) indicator, which underlays the chart like the Relative Strength Index (RSI), while tracking the volume reinforces the bullish grip on Ether as it rebounds.\n\nTherefore, with inflow volume surpassing outflow volume, Ethereum has enough momentum to deal with resistance at $1,850.\n\nHolding above $1,800 on Thursday, assured investors Ethereum price is in an uptrend and is not ready to falter.\n\nThat said, the next and most important confirmation investors need is a break and hold above $1,850 to bring the subsequent hurdle at $2,000 within reach.\n\nIf push comes to shove and Ethereum bows to the seller congestion at $1,850, a retreat to $1,800 would provide fresh liquidity for another stronger rally to $2,000.\n\nThe Ethereum Shanghai Upgrade Is Happening\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation confirmed the Shanghai upgrade earlier in the week around mid-April. It is the second most important hard fork since the Merge in September, particularly among investors who locked ETH tokens in the Beacon Chain Smart Contract.\n\nRecently baptized Shapella, the Shanghai upgrade will see Ethereum unlock its full potential as a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus protocol, as validators will for the first time withdraw from the staking contracts.\n\n\u201cThere is much speculation about what the Shanghai hard fork will mean for the price action of ETH and related liquid staking derivatives (LSDs) such as Lido (LDO) and Rocket Pool (RPL). So far, we have seen large appreciations in the price for LSDs and related protocols,\u201d Bill Xing, head of financial products at Bybit said in an exclusive commentary to Cryptonews.\n\nLike many experts in the market, expects the volatility being experienced to \u201ccontinue leading up to and around the time the Shanghai upgrade is enacted, similar to the situation that unfolded around the time of The Merge in September 2022,\u201d Xing added.\n\nEthereum has been one of the biggest bullish contenders in the last few weeks. Unlike other altcoins, ETH has rallied alongside Bitcoin, allowing investors to hedge against the banking crisis in the US.\n\n\u201cWe expect it to continue to play an important role going forward, primarily if it can deliver what is promised on its roadmap,\u201d Xing said as he concluded his statement.\n\nHowever, the biggest challenge the Ethereum price faces at the moment is the risk associated with regulatory uncertainty in the US. If ETH can ignore the \u2018noise\u2019 it could ease into a substantial rally in 2023.\n\nBuy Ethereum Now\n\nRelated Articles:"

        "content": "Bitcoin is Digital Property, Ethereum is Digital Security \u2013 Argues Michael Saylor\n\nMichael Saylor. Source: UpOnly / YouTube\n\nUS-based software developer MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor has once again questioned the regulatory status of ethereum (ETH), arguing that it can be best classified as digital security. On the other hand, he insisted that there is no doubt that bitcoin (BTC) is a digital property, and thus not subject to regulatory headaches.\n\nSaylor, who has appeared on a recent episode of the UpOnly podcast, said that the most important thing for a long-term crypto investor to understand is the political status of a cryptoasset \u2014 i.e., is it a cryptocurrency, a crypto property, or crypto security.\n\n\u201cAs far as I can see, Bitcoin is a crypto property and by property, it means it\u2019s viewed as a fair, common piece of property beyond the control of a company or a group of individuals,\u201d Saylor said, adding that it is pretty challenging to create a property.\n\nBitcoin was created by the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto, who released the original Bitcoin white paper in 2008. The coins are created through mining, which means there never was a pre-mine or an initial coin offering (ICO). Bitcoin uses the proof-of-work (PoW) mechanism, which is according to Saylor a \u201cfair distribution.\u201d\n\nPointing these out, Saylor claimed that bitcoin can be easily classified as digital property, saying:\n\n\u201cIt is pretty clear that of everything in the crypto universe the thing that is most likely to be deemed property in any given nation-state is Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nHowever, he classified every coin that enables staking or uses the proof-of-stake (PoS) mechanism as digital security.\n\n\u201cIt has been explicitly stated by the regulators if there is a stake and it generates yield it\u2019s an investment contract and an investment contract is a security,\u201d Saylor added.\n\nRecently, there have been some discussions that Ethereum is actually a security. That is because Ethereum was also originally funded through an ICO, which took place in 2014. At the time, users had the opportunity to exchange their BTC for ETH tokens, and more than 7m ETH tokens were sold in the first 12 hours.\n\nAccording to Saylor, the problem with securities is that they are in a regulatory gray zone. \u201cIn order for you to invest in [securites], you have to be willing to accept the securities risk, the legal risk, the competitive risk, and the literal cyber security risk,\u201d he said.\n\nThis partly explains why Saylor, a bitcoin maximalist, has stayed away from ethereum despite all the recent growth around decentralized finance (DeFi) or non-fungible tokens (NFTs) which are mainly built on Ethereum.\n\nNotably, Saylor\u2019s Microstrategy has continued its BTC buying spree despite all the volatility and dips. By the end of 2021, the company held approximately BTC 124,391, acquired at an aggregate purchase price of USD 3.75bn and an average purchase price of USD 30,159 per bitcoin, inclusive of fees and expenses, according to filings shared with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nAt 10:07 UTC, BTC is trading at USD 36,607. It\u2019s down 3% in a day and 12% in a week. ETH is changing hands at USD 2,444, having dropped 2% in a day and 21% in a week.\n\n____\n\nLearn more:\n\n\u2013 MicroStrategy to Keep Buying Bitcoin\n\n\u2013 MicroStrategy is Only HODLing Bitcoin, Says the CEO\n\n\n\n\u2013 Bitcoin Mining Energy Use \u2018Inconsequential,\u2019 \u2018Rapidly Becoming More Efficient\u2019 \u2013 Saylor\n\n\u2013 MicroStrategy\u2019s and Grayscale Bitcoin Trust\u2019s Shares Now Compete with ETFs\n\n\n\n\u2013 MicroStrategy Insider Sales Hint Executives May Lack CEO\u2019s Conviction\n\n\u2013 This Is How Musk\u2019s and Saylor\u2019s Tweets Steer Bitcoin Price"

        "title": "Ethereum Price Prediction as $7 Billion Trading Volume Rushes In \u2013 Are Whales Buying ETH? - Cryptonews",
        "content": "For the moment, Ethereum price teeters at $1,575 while bulls focus on dealing with resistance at $1,600. On the downside, support at $1,520 must be defended at all costs to avert possible declines to $1,445 and $1,400, respectively.\n\nOver $7 billion in trading volume has been recorded in the past 24 hours, although the ETH price has only changed by +0.15%. The sell-off in the market since the weekend has resulted in a drop in the token\u2019s market cap from $202 billion on January 29 to $192 billion.\n\nThe largest smart contracts token remains relatively stable despite the drop from January\u2019s high, roughly at $1,678. Investors have retreated to the sidelines, awaiting the Fed decision on a likely interest rate hike of 25 basis points. The first US FOMC meeting concluding later today would either keep New Year\u2019s crypto upswings steady, stifle recovery, or culminate in a short-term selloff.\n\nAccording to an analysis carried out by Lookonchain on how ETH reacted after eight FOMC meetings in 2022, investors can expect the Ethereum price to jump by up to 4.25% with 0.25% being the lowest expected change.\n\nEthereum price sits comfortably above critical support provided by the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) (in purple) at $1,517. However, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator has recently flaunted a sell signal, hinting at a longer trend correction in the coming days.\n\nETH/USD daily chart\n\nTraders must follow the position of the MACD line in blue as it builds a divergence below the signal line in red. Declines may intensify if the momentum indicator drops to the mean line and possibly revisits the negative region. The red histograms in the same indicator reinforce the growing bearish advances.\n\nAssessing The Bullish Outlook in Ethereum Price \u2013 Short Analysis\n\nThe Money Flow Index (MFI) on the same daily timeframe chart reveals that investors are ready to pump money into Ethereum markets. We can see the MFI bouncing off the midline in the neutral zone following a major dip from the higher range of the overbought region. As long as more volume is flowing in than Ether\u2019s total outflows, a trend rebound would be the most likely outcome.\n\nIn addition, to support provided by the 200-day EMA, the 50-day EMA (in red) has recently flipped above the 100-day EMA. Although not a golden cross pattern, which forms with the 50-day EMA moving above the 200-day EMA, it implies bulls hold the reins and Ethereum price will likely keep climbing.\n\nShort-term analysis based on the four-hour time frame chart shows Ethereum holding between the 100-day EMA (in blue) and the 50-day EMA (in red) to the upside. While the most popular smart contracts token is trading below the dotted trend line, its support at the 100-day EMA has been reinforced by the lower rising trend line, which means odds still favor a bullish outcome.\n\nETH/USD four-hour chart\n\nFollowing the fall from January\u2019s highs, Ethereum sunk into oversold conditions based on the Stochastic oscillator. However, recovery is already underway with bullish pressure gradually intensifying.\n\nTherefore, with a minor push above the 50-day EMA and the dotted rising trendline, Ethereum price would reignite its uptrend, aiming for $1,800 and $2,000, respectively. The MFI indicator upholds the positive picture, as seen in the daily time frame analysis.\n\nIt would be prudent to assess the possibility of an extended trend correction, especially if support at the 100-day EMA on the four-hour chart weakens. From here, Ethereum will be forced to look toward the 200-day EMA (purple) at $1,486 for support. If push comes to shove, declines might retest the next buyer congestion area at $1,400.\n\nCan This Upgrade Steady Ethereum Price Uptrend?\n\nThe Ethereum Merge upgrade set the ball rolling for many features expected on the proof-of-stake (Pos) blockchain, including Zhejiang \u2013 the staking testnet going live today. Users will for the first time, interact with the new staking protocol that allows the withdrawal of staked ETH.\n\nAccording to the testnet\u2019s developer, the Shanghai+Capella upgrade will be triggered in about six days from today. The testnet will allow developers to monitor the withdrawal process and other related services and resolve any potential issues that may arise."

        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction as Bulls Hold $1,500 Level \u2013 Can ETH Rally Soon?\n\nETH/USD daily chart\n\nETH, the cryptocurrency that holds the second-largest market cap, has remained steady by finding support at $1,500. Despite this, experts predict that a rebound is unlikely before the upcoming Shanghai hard fork.\n\nAt present, the price of Ethereum is hovering around $1,555, having experienced a decrease of 1% in the last 24 hours.\n\nInvestors who locked their ETH in the Beacon Chain smart contract to help the network transition from a proof-of-work (PoW) to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus algorithm are expected to withdraw the tokens when the Shanghai hard fork comes in early April.\n\nAnalysts appear conflicted over the impact of the much-awaited upgrade with some saying it would send Ethereum price above $2,000 while others foresee a further drop in price as stakers gain access to their ETH locked in the smart contract and start to sell.\n\nEthereum Price Wobbles Above $1,500 as Recession Fears Mount\n\nThe cryptocurrency market has remained in a precarious position for several weeks, even as Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell testified before the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday.\n\nPowell did not mince his words when he said that interest rates were most likely to rise and by a larger margin than expected by market watchers, citing extremely unfavorable economic data since the previous review in early February.\n\nThe crypto market is expected to feel the pinch, with bearish forces likely to be in control, as investors choose fixed-income products and the strengthening US dollar over other assets. Powell\u2019s remarks have been interpreted as a warning of a recession beckoning \u2013 if it is not already here.\n\nEthereum\u2019s price and the crypto market must also brave the tough stance from US regulatory agencies, which have vowed to increase oversight of the industry following the sudden collapse of FTX exchange in November.\n\nUS-based crypto firms are feeling the pressure \u2013 made worse by the recent revelation that crypto-friendly bank, Silvergate is evaluating its ability to stay in business.\n\nDissecting the Ethereum Price Short-Term Technical Outlook\n\nIn addition to the Ethereum price staying stable above $1,500, ETH holds onto support provided by the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $1,546 on the daily chart.\n\nThe price of ETH is facing challenges due to low liquidity and strong selling pressure at $1,569, which is reinforced by an upward trendline. The market is currently controlled by sellers, and it remains to be seen when this changes.\n\nETH/USD daily chart\n\nEthereum\u2019s price could drop further before a trend reversal ensues. Traders looking forward to booking long positions in ETH may want to wait until ETH consolidates at support and prepares for a leg up.\n\nFurthermore, the MACD\u2019s recent slide beneath the mean line at 0.00 hints at bears having the upper hand. In that case, support at the 200-day EMA must be protected at all costs. Otherwise, we could see Ethereum\u2019s price dropping to $1,400.\n\nAs per blockchain data presented by IntoTheBlock, around 18.69 million ETH addresses are currently at a loss.\n\nEthereum IOMAP model\n\nRetail investors may opt to sell their crypto assets and instead go for better-performing assets, even if it means taking a loss.\n\nAddresses in the money with unrealized profits are represented by small green circles on the chart, and if selling pressure increases, Ethereum price may fall to retest downstream levels at $1,400 and $1,338, respectively.\n\nThe large circle between $1,600 and $1,647 is where sellers are most concentrated and where bulls may face resistance as they push for an uptrend. If this area is overcome, ETH price could quickly rally up to $1,800 and $2,000.\n\nBuy Ethereum Now\n\nRelated Articles:"

        "content": "3iQ, Canada\u2019s first Bitcoin (BTC) fund issuer, revealed that its Ethereum-based (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETF), The Ether Fund and the 3iQ Ether Fund, will begin staking their ETH holdings for rewards, according to an Oct. 19 statement.\n\n3iQ explained that its move towards staking was designed to provide its investors with \u201cadditional yield generated by dedicated validators on the Ethereum network\u2019s Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism while eliminating the complexities of directly handling digital assets.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Funds will earn rewards in the form of ETH, which will be reflected in the net asset value (NAV) of the Funds through accretive yield,\u201d the firm said.\n\nData from 3iQ\u2019s website shows that the two funds have a combined net asset value of around $130 million.\n\nTo incentivize investors, 3iQ said it would waive the management fee of the 3iQ Ether ETF until March 31, 2024, and the fund would be renamed \u201c3iQ Ether Staking ETF\u201d from Oct. 20.\n\nMeanwhile, 3iQ said it will \u201cexclusively use\u201d Coinbase Custody\u2019s institutional staking infrastructure. Per the statement, its ETH is held custodied with Coinbase Custody, with oversight provided by Tetra Trust.\n\nThe asset manager did not specify how much of its portfolio would be staked. However, it stated that it would \u201cadopt a measured approach to the Staking Activities, taking into account the liquidity needs of the Fund and the novelty of the investment strategy.\u201d\n\n3iQ further revealed that it would charge 25% of the staked rewards generated by the Funds as Staking Service Fee. The firm clarified that this fee would only be deducted from rewards generated by the Staking Activities.\n\nStaking is an integral part of the Ethereum blockchain network that involves committing at least 32 ETH to support the network for a set period to earn rewards. Ethereum\u2019s website describes the process as \u201ca public good\u201d that \u201ckeeps Ethereum secure for everyone.\u201d According to the website, ETH stakers will earn 3.5% rewards annually.\n\nData from Beaconscan shows that the total number of staked ETH has grown to 27.8 million during the last six months despite the introduction of the Shanghai update, which allowed withdrawals from the beacon chain."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nUpland, a blockchain real estate collecting and trading game, announced a $7 million Series A extension raise on Friday. Led by EOS Network Ventures in the fund\u2019s first crypto gaming investment, the extension follows the initial $18 million Series A raise in 2021.\n\nThe injection of capital will go to adding more features for the location-based game, which lets players purchase digital locations on a real-world map. Upland also plans to intensify its marketing strategy, enable third-party developer tools, and launch an Ethereum token tied to its current in-game utility token.\n\n\u201cThe metaverse is far from being dead,\u201d Upland Co-CEO and co-founder Dirk Lueth told Decrypt in advance of the announcement.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nInspired by the board game Monopoly, Upland began as a property trading game in 2019, allowing players to buy and sell digital versions of real-world properties along with myriad other activities. It has since added cafes, treasure hunting, and vehicles, and will host fashion week events in the future.\n\nUpland says that it has over 3 million total registered players, including about 30,000 daily active users, and it has inked deals with big sports organizations such as FIFA and the NFL Players Association while adding more and more locations in the United States, Latin America, and Europe.\n\nFor Upland, its geographic strategy is ultimately driven by localized interest. Leuth noted its recent partnership with anime-style profile picture (PFP) NFT project, ON1 Force, which helped Upland enter Japanese territory with the addition of Tokyo to the game.\n\nBuilt on the EOS network, Upland has gradually expanded over the years, and continues to do so even as buzz around the concept of the \u201cmetaverse\u201d has subsided over the last year or so. The quieting buzz doesn\u2019t faze Leuth.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, it\u2019s just a word,\u201d he told Decrypt, insisting that the immersive web is very much alive and well. He called it \u201cthe paradigm of how things will happen in the future.\u201d\n\nHe added that \u201cmaybe the speculators have left,\u201d but noted the existence of OMA3\u2014aka the Open Metaverse Alliance of Web3, an organization that Leuth serves as chairperson of\u2014as a signal of continued development in the space. Focused on creating metaverse standards, OMA3 is a consortium of blockchain, NFT, and metaverse companies that includes major players like Animoca Brands, Yuga Labs, and The Sandbox, along with Upland.\n\nEOS has lost prominence over the years. It ranks 23rd on DefiLlama for total value locked (TVL), which stands at $69 million, underlining a consistent downtrend with no signs of stopping. The EOS token is ranked 60th in terms of total market cap among cryptocurrencies via CoinGecko, and is over five years out from its all-time high price.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t bother Lueth, who told Decrypt that when Upland was founded in 2018, EOS was one of the only viable blockchains for such a project.\n\n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t use Ethereum because of their gas fees,\u201d said Leuth. After some analysis, the team decided EOS was the \u201cbest blockchain\u201d for their needs, and he claimed that Upland is now minting 80 NFTs per second thanks to the blockchain\u2019s technical features. The EOS Network Ventures investment suggests that backers are still trying to grow the ecosystem.\n\nThe Series A extension, which included participation from existing investors Animoca Brands and C3 Venture Capital, will also help fund Upland\u2019s upcoming move to make its in-game Spark token tradable on Ethereum, as Sparklet. Leuth said that the decision to expand the token outside of the game\u2019s own ecosystem is pragmatic.\n\n\u201cThis will increase the visibility of Upland on the open market,\u201d he explained.\n\nThe Co-CEO said that Ripple\u2019s favorable court ruling also helped sway Upland to propose the initiative. One big advantage, he also pointed out, is that the team has never sold the token to investors or the team, potentially helping Upland avoid the kind of securities-related scrutiny that other crypto startups have faced from the SEC.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAlthough the crypto ecosystem has created an image of building fast and breaking things, Lueth insists on a more long-term focus for the industry.\n\n\u201cGaming will drive adoption in general,\u201d he concluded, \u201cbut it won\u2019t happen overnight.\u201d\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

However, The state of New York has filed a lawsuit against Digital Currency Group, and its subsidiary Genesis Global Capital along iwht crypto exchange Gemini alleging fraud to the tune of more than $1 billion.\n\n\n\nAfter a short-lived profit booking, Bitcoin was back in green on Friday as the last crypto token surged more than 3 per cent to regain the 29,000-levels. However, its largest peer, Ethereum, also rose more than 2 per cent but remained below $1,600-level. Majority of altcoins were trading higher in the early morning.\n\n\n\nThe crypto market narrative is seemingly shifting more towards the increasing Bitcoin dominance. As Ethereum continues to fall against Bitcoin, other layer 2s have also been underperforming, said Shubham Hudda, Senior Manager at CoinSwitch Markets Desk. Social media company Reddit announced to wind down its internet points feature citing scalability issues, he said.\n\n\n\n\"India has been making moves in the blockchain technology space as HPCL has partnered with blockchain software firm Zupple Labs to use its service LegitDocs in helping in the automatic verification of its purchase orders (POs). After working on this for the last 6 months, HPCL seems to have now completed this integration,\" Hudda added.\n\n\n\nBarring the US dollar pegged Tether as only an exception, the majority of top crypto tokens were trading with big gains on Friday. Solana rallied about 9 per cent, while XRP gained about 7 per cent. Toncoin rose 6 per cent, while Bitcoin Cash was up 5 per cent. Litecoin added 4 per cent during the early trade.\n\n\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market cap was trading sharply higher, rising up $1.11 trillion-mark, as it surged about 3 per cent in the last 24 hours. However, the total trading volumes rose about 7 per cent to $42.60 billion.\n\n\n\nBitcoin has surpassed the $28,600 mark in response to the US Federal Chair Jerome Powell's announcement that the Federal Reserve is likely to maintain current interest rates in November, with a potential increase in December. This coincides with a 6-basis point jump in the 10-year US Treasury yield, said Edul Patel, Co-founder and CEO at Mudrex.\n\n\n\n\"There is a bullish sentiment in the market, as displayed by Bitcoin growing over 8% in the past week. Meanwhile, Ripple's price has surged by over 7 per cent in the last 24 hours following the US SEC's decision to drop charges against Ripple Labs' CEO Brad Garlinghouse and Chairman Chris Larsen,\" he said.\n\n\n\nImage: Crypto-chart-price\n\n\n\nTech View by Giottus Crypto Platform:\n\nMaker (MKR)is currently facing difficulty in breathing its resistance levels.MKR is witnessing mixed price action, after recording short-term losses earlier this month. The asset, trading at $1,420,is holding steady in a horizontal channel and is expected to continue in the near term.\n\n\n\nImage: Chart-Make\n\n\n\nIt is facing immediate resistance at $1,490 and if the price successfully surpasses this level, it could potentially lead to the next resistance at $1,585. Its50-day moving average is currently at $1,315 and MKR is holding well above this level. The asset has shown marginal signs of recovery in the last couple of days, with its RSI slope showing signs of recovery indicating an uptick in buying pressure.\n\n\n\nMajor Levels:\n\nSupport: $1,335, $1,265\n\nResistance: $1,490, $1,585\n\n\n\n(Views and recommendations given in this section are the analysts' own and do not represent those of Business Today.

        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction: ETH Falls 1% Overnight \u2013 When is the Next Bounce?\n\nSource: TradingView\n\nThe Ethereum price has dropped by 1% in the past hour and by 2% in the past 24 hours, as the market\u2019s biggest altcoin continues to be affected by the delay of the Holesky testnet launch.\n\nAnd while the market as a whole is down today, ETH seems to be more affected than many other major cryptocurrencies, with the altcoin also down by 1.7% in a week and by 4% in a month, at $1,591.\n\nHowever, ETH also remains up by 33% since the beginning of the year, and with its fundamentals remaining as strong as ever, it\u2019s likely to rebound in the coming days and weeks.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction: ETH Falls 1% Overnight \u2013 When is the Next Bounce?\n\nIt\u2019s very arguable that ETH\u2019s weakness right now only makes it more of a bargain, given how oversold it has been in recent weeks and months.\n\nSource: TradingView\n\nIts indicators continue to suggest that it\u2019s due a rebound very soon, with its 30-day moving average (yellow) having been substantially below its 200-day average (blue) since the end of August.\n\nAgain, this signals that the coin is oversold, as does ETH\u2019s relative strength index (purple), which is laboring around the 40 level and which has been well below 50 since the middle of August.\n\nA more positive sign is provided by the coin\u2019s support level (green), which has noticeably risen in the past week or so, implying that ETH has hit a bottom and should now come back up strongly soon enough.\n\nAs noted above, ETH has taken a disproportionate hit in the past few days due to the delayed launch of the Holesky testnet, which will provide improved testing capabilities and which will be instrumental in paving the way for proto-Danksharding to emerge in the more distant future."

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nIn an exciting turn of events, Ethereum (ETH) is looking to make a substantial comeback, targeting a price range between $1,800 and $1,900. This optimistic outlook comes as Bitcoin (BTC) experiences renewed highs due to false reports of a spot ETF approval, and the altcoin market shows signs of recovery.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEthereum, the leading altcoin, is currently trading at $1,615 per token, but analysts are keeping a close watch on its potential for growth. Noted expert Ali Martinez, a prominent figure in crypto circles, has pointed out a compelling pattern on the three-day chart.\n\nTextbook price action\n\nAccording to Martinez, Ethereum is on the verge of a rebound, poised to break out from an ascending triangle formation. To validate this prediction, a firm close above the 18-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) is crucial. Only with a strong anchoring above this level, possibly marked by a daily candlestick, can ETH carve a path for further growth.\n\nThe price range of $1,800 to $1,900 per ETH is drawing considerable attention. This zone signifies a 50% to 61.8% price correction from the prolonged fall since mid-April, a textbook correction by market standards.\n\nAs Ethereum approaches these critical price levels, the market will gain greater clarity on its future trajectory. Observers anticipate that breaking and consolidating above these key levels will provide the green light for further upward momentum."

        "content": "Based on past performance, October could be a good month to invest in Bitcoin. Market watchers for cryptocurrencies have noticed that October is typically a good month for the currency. Due to growth from the previous year, early in November, it hit a record high of approximately $66,000.\n\nGalois Capital, a cryptocurrency hedge fund known for correctly predicting the collapse of Terra\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin UST, tweeted:\n\nThe meme was quickly adopted by other accounts with sizable followings as well.\n\nOctober Effect Could Drive Uptrend in Crypto\n\nAlthough the term \u201cUptober\u201d is relatively new, it gained popularity during last year\u2019s record-breaking rise. However, conventional wisdom predicts that October and November will be good months for cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s performance in October has been positive eight times out of the last 12 months, and BTC has shown positive performance in eight of the past twelve years, with an average return of around 30%. So far, 66% of investments made in October have yielded a profit.\n\nAccording to Coinglass data, October has historically been a positive month for the most popular cryptocurrency in terms of monthly returns.\n\nBitcoin monthly returns. Source: Coinglass\n\nContrary to popular belief, the \u201cOctober effect,\u201d which predicts that October will be a losing month, only applies to traditional stock markets.\n\nOctober is especially significant for cryptocurrency because Satoshi Nakomoto, the project\u2019s pseudonymous founder, published the project\u2019s white paper for the first time on October 31, 2008.\n\nOctober Offers the Highest Returns in Crypto\n\nCryptocurrency strategist James Altucher, the host and creator of InvestAnswers, believes that as the year\u2019s final quarter officially begins, October will traditionally be a strong month for Bitcoin.\n\nJames Altucher said:\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s look at how October benchmarks against other months in the history of Bitcoin. Here you can see September is red August is like breakeven. But October is the third-best month historically. And that\u2019s why many people refer to it as Uptober.\u201d\n\nBased on the historical return for October, he believes Bitcoin could reach $26,000 in the next four weeks.\n\nAccording to James, October had the third-highest average monthly returns. He believes that October is historically the third-best month. As a result, many people refer to it as Uptober.\n\nCrypto Community is Bullish for Ethereum in October\n\nMany cryptocurrencies are trading in the green on their daily and weekly charts. It also includes Ethereum (ETH), one of the largest tokens, which has led the crypto community to predict that the market will continue to rise by the end of October.\n\nAccording to Coinglass data, the Ethereum price has historically performed exceptionally well in October.\n\nEthereum monthly returns. Source: Coinglass\n\nThe community votes at CoinMarketCap predicted that Ethereum\u2019s token would trade at an average price of $1,578 on October 31, 2022, according to the most recent data obtained on September 27 using the platform\u2019s \u2018Price Estimates\u2019 tool.\n\nNotably, the cryptocurrency community\u2019s forecast for Ethereum\u2019s price, which received 2,244 votes, shows a 13.34% increase.\n\nBitcoin Price & Technical Outlook\n\nBitcoin is currently trading near the psychological level of $20,000. In my previous Bitcoin update, I mentioned that the BTC/USD pair had formed a descending triangle pattern, extending significant resistance near $20,478.\n\nBitcoin failed to break above the trendline resistance and now heading south to cross below the 50-day moving average providing immediate support near the psychological level of $20,000 in this case.\n\nBitcoin Price Chart \u2013 Source: Tradingview\n\nLeading technical indicators such as the RSI and moving average convergence and divergence (MACD) are above 50 and 0, still indicating a buying trend. However, the \u201changing man\u201d candlesticks pattern is signaling chances of a bearish correction today.\n\nOn the downside, Bitcoin\u2019s immediate support level remains at $20,000, with $18,650 serving as an immediate support level below this level.\n\nEthereum Price & Technical Outlook\n\nETH is currently consolidating in a narrow trading range of $1,300 to $1,400, possibly awaiting a strong fundamental reason to trigger a breakout. On the technical side, the ETH/USD pair is trading marginally higher after recovering from the psychological support level of $1,300.\n\nOn the daily timeframe, a small ascending triangle pattern provides immediate resistance near the $1,400 level. Ascending triangle patterns have a high likelihood of breaking out on the bullish side, so the odds of an ETH\u2019s bullish bias remain high.\n\nEthereum Price Chart \u2013 Source: Tradingview\n\nAs a result, a positive crossover over $1,400 may clear the way for an uptrend to extend to $1,575 or $1,650. If the price of ETH continues to rise, it might reach $1,795 per coin. Support, on the other hand, remains near $1,300 and $1,227.\n\nNew Altcoin News\n\nIn addition to leading cryptocurrencies, new altcoins are making headlines. IMPT, a new protocol, is being developed to help businesses and people track and control their carbon footprint. The protocol is designed to reward and incentivize users for their participation.\n\nIMPT is on a presale, and it\u2019s exhibiting a massive performance, having raised more than $1.4 million in just four days of its presale.\n\nAlongside, Tamadoge is also under the spotlight, having gained more than 300% from its all-time low of $0.01683. The first Tamadoge NFTs are now available on OpenSea, along with 100 ultra-rare Tamadoge Pets.\n\nFind The Best Price to Buy/Sell Cryptocurrency:"

        "content": "Ethereum price is still trading below all the key bull market indicators despite Bitcoin\u2019s rally to $30,000 this week. The second-largest cryptocurrency is trading below its $1,600 support/resistance on Thursday and might need to drop further to sweep through fresh liquidity preferably at $1,500 and build the momentum for a rebound.\n\nAddresses On The Ethereum Blockchain Hit 100 Million\n\nEthereum price might be caught up in the crypto winter but the same does not apply to the network, which has continued to experience significant growth over the last few years.\n\nadvertisement\n\nAccording to on-chain insight shared by @finelady_p on X (formerly Twitter) and reposted by blockchain analytics firm IntoTheBlock (ITB), \u201c the number of addresses with a balance has been steadily increasing over the past few years,\u201d affirming the positive outlook for Ethereum, in that, \u201c there is growing interest in Ethereum and that people are holding onto their ETH for the long-term.\u201d\n\nInterest in Ethereum has over the last few weeks continued to rise and this can be attributed to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approving a bunch of Ether futures exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US.\n\n\u201cThe fact that the number of Ethereum addresses with a balance is increasing and that the price has started to rebound in recent weeks are positive signs for the future of Ethereum,\u201d the X user added.\n\nSantiment, another leading on-chain analytics platform, highlighted that Ethereum addresses belonging to whales in the \u201cbillionaire tier (holding at least 1M #ETH)\u201d currently account for 32.3% of the circulating supply and this is the first milestone of this kind since 2016.\n\nNetwork activity involving these high net worth addresses achieved \u201ctransactions valued at more than $1 million on Wednesday, the second highest day in five weeks. According to Santiment, history is unfolding ahead of the anticipated bull run in 2024 and 2025.\n\n\ud83d\udc0b #Ethereum's whale addresses in the #billionaire tier (holding at least 1M $ETH) now hold 32.3% of the available supply for the first time since 2016. Yesterday's transactions valued at $1M+ also had its 2nd highest day in 5 weeks. History is being made. https://t.co/sywdtn14k5 pic.twitter.com/SdbSrChJCf \u2014 Santiment (@santimentfeed) October 17, 2023\n\nETH Bulls Hunt For Support\n\nThe Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator reinforces the bearish outlook in Ethereum price as it slides into the negative region \u2014 below the mean line (0.00).\n\nTraders are bound to seek exposure to short positions in ETH as long as the sell signal holds. In other words, if the blue MACD line holds below the signal line in red.\n\nThe position of Ethereum price below the ascending trendline as shown on the weekly chart puts bulls at a significant disadvantage. Therefore, the downtrend might need to extend to $1,500 support to collect more liquidity as more investors buy lower-priced ETH tokens, thus building the momentum for a substantial recovery above $1,600.\n\nOn the upside, Ethereum could start to flip bullish after stepping above some of the bull market indicators like the 200-week Exponential Moving Average (EMA) (purple) at $1,625 and the 21-week EMA (red) at $1,696. The subsequent movement above the 100-week EMA could propel ETH to $2,000 and possibly trigger the next bullish phase to $3,000.\n\nRelated Articles"

Source: a video screenshot, Grand Amphi Th\u00e9atre / YouTube\n\nEthereum (ETH) co-founder Vitalik Buterin outlined his vision for the second-largest project\u2019s future at the Ethereum Community Conference in Paris on Thursday.\n\nThe vision included an increased focus on security, stability, and decentralization, as well as the following key points:\n\nEthereum is \u201c55% complete once we finish the Merge.\u201d Buterin compared this to the view he said is common in the Bitcoin (BTC) community, where people \u2013 according to Buterin \u2013 see Bitcoin as 80% complete. Ethereum should, over time, \u201csettle down.\u201d A lot of innovations have happened or are in the process of happening, including the famous EIP-1559 and the transition to proof-of-stake (PoS), the Ethereum co-founder explained. He noted that \u201cat some point, the rate of change for the protocol is going to have to slow down.\u201d Ethereum will then \u201clook somewhat more like a system that optimizes for safety and predictability, and less like an ecosystem that optimizes for impressing and dazzling people,\u201d he said. Buterin warned against adding support for multiple virtual machines, and getting too comfortable with technologies like SNARKs (succinct non-interactive argument of knowledge), and said it is a danger if Ethereum becomes so complex that \u201cno single person can understand the whole protocol.\u201d Instead of increasing complexity, the focus should be on decentralization, Buterin opined. He said that this includes having an easy-to-use light client for the consensus layer, execution layer, and Layer-2\u2019s \u201cas a default,\u201d have better support for home stakers, and make sure it\u2019s possible to run a full node on lighter hardware. In terms of changes that are worth making in the future, Buterin pointed to upgrades for quantum resistance as one such change. Quantum computers are coming he said, adding that \u201conce quantum computers come, we have to upgrade to different cryptography.\u201d Commenting on the merits of PoS, Buterin admitted that transitioning to it is \u201ca big change\u201d and said there are also \u201clots of benefits.\u201d He added that the few remaining proof-of-work (PoW) supporters that exist in the Ethereum community can use Ethereum Classic (ETC) instead. They have \u201ca welcoming community,\u201d and it is \u201ca totally fine chain,\u201d he said about the blockchain that split from Ethereum after a major hack in 2016.\n\nWatch the entire talk below:\n\n____\n\nLearn more:\n\n\u2013 Ethereum Merge Date Proposed for September\n\n\u2013 Vitalik Buterin Confirms Post-Merge Ethereum Centralization Concerns, Urges Not to \u2018Overly Catastrophize\u2019 It\n\n\n\n\u2013 Contradictory Vitalik Buterin Says He Wants a More Bitcoin-like Ethereum\n\n\u2013 Ethereum Won\u2019t Hide From Quantum Computers Behind PoS Shield\n\n\n\n\u2013 2022, the Year Layer 2 Takes Off\n\n\u2013 Ethereum Classic Rallies Again, Outperforms Ethereum YTD \u2013 But What Does History Show?"

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nThe world of cryptocurrencies is vast, with a plethora of assets vying for the spotlight. For a long time, Ethereum (ETH) has held a revered position, initially beginning as a nonconsensus asset back in 2018 and 2019. Fast forward to today, and Ethereum has garnered consensus, solidifying its position as a leading player in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, the tides of the crypto world are ever-changing, and a new contender is making waves \u2014 Solana (SOL). Prominent crypto analysts now claim that Solana is the \"strongest non-consensus asset\" of the current bear market. Such bold claims are not made lightly, and the recent performance of Solana provides substantial backing to these assertions.\n\nSource: TradingView\n\nExamining the daily chart of Solana reveals an explosive trajectory. After a series of oscillations, SOL has demonstrated a robust upward trend, capturing the attention of investors and enthusiasts alike. Peaks and troughs aside, the general momentum of Solana portrays bullish sentiment.\n\nBut what sets Solana apart in the crowded crypto domain? One key event solidifying its credibility was its resilience during the FTX crash. FTX, a prominent crypto exchange, was one of the major holders of Solana. Despite potential concerns of market manipulation or undue influence, Solana showcased stability and growth even after the FTX crash. This event not only fortified investor confidence but also indicated Solana's intrinsic value and potential for longevity in the crypto arena.\n\nNow, Solana stands in an advantageous position. The so-called shackles of major centralized holders are behind, and the ecosystem of Solana is burgeoning. Developers, start-ups and enterprises are increasingly turning to Solana's blockchain for its speed, security and scalability."

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s price has recently rebounded and is currently testing a key area.\n\nIn case the bullish momentum carries on, the price is likely to head toward the $2,000 resistance zone in the near future.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nBy Edris\n\nThe Daily Chart\n\nOn the daily timeframe, the $1,550 support level has once again held the price, preventing it from dropping lower toward the $1,400 area. The 50-day moving average is currently being tested around $1,600.\n\nIf ETH breaks above, the $1,750 resistance level and the 200-day moving average located near the $1,800 mark are the next likely targets.\n\nThe RSI indicator has also risen above the 50% threshold, pointing to the fact that the momentum is in favor of the buyers once more.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart\n\nLooking at the 4-hour chart, it is evident that the price has been consolidating between the $1,550 and $1,750 levels for the past few months. However, the market has once again rebounded from the $1,550 level recently and is currently testing the $1,600 resistance zone.\n\nA bullish breakout from this area would pave the way for a further rally toward $1,750 in the coming weeks. However, investors should keep an eye on the RSI indicator as it is entering the overbought region again, which could result in a rejection from the $1,600 zone.\n\nOn-Chain Analysis\n\nBy Edris\n\nEthereum\u2019s price has recently shown upward momentum following months of consolidation and gradual decline. This PA has left investors wondering whether a new bullish phase is on the horizon or lower prices are still to be expected.\n\nThis chart depicts the 100-day moving average of the taker buy-sell ratio metric, one of the most valuable futures market sentiment indicators. Takers are orders executed aggressively at market price and are the ones that move the price. Taker buy-sell ratio values below 1 show bearish sentiment, while values above 1 are considered bullish.\n\nAs the chart demonstrates, this metric has risen recently but is still below 1. If this increase in the taker buy-sell ratio continues and the metric climbs above 1, a new price rally could be expected, and the market could finally break above the $2,000 resistance level. However, if the metric fails to break above 1, things are unlikely to change, and the price could drop further in the short term."

        "content": "Valkyrie Investments Receives SEC Approval for First Ethereum Futures ETF\n\nValkyrie Investments receives SEC approval to launch the first Ethereum futures ETF in the United States.\n\nPhoto by Zoltan Tasi on Unsplash\n\nToday, Nashville-based asset management firm Valkyrie Investments secured approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch the first-ever exchange-traded fund (ETF) for Ethereum futures. This could mark an important milestone for digital asset investment in the United States.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s decision comes as the regulatory body is slowly opening up to the crypto market. In October 2021, the SEC allowed the trading of Bitcoin ETFs priced off futures contracts. Valkyrie Investments is now part of a select group of firms that offer crypto-related ETFs, building on its existing Bitcoin Mining ETF.\n\nRising Competition in the Ether ETF Space\n\nValkyrie Investments is not alone in its pursuit of establishing Ethereum futures ETFs. Eight other issuers, including VanEck, Grayscale Investments, and Bitwise, have filed applications with the SEC. These firms look to capitalize on the growing demand for Ethereum, which currently holds the title of the world\u2019s second-largest digital asset.\n\nBeyond Ethereum futures ETFs, Valkyrie Investments, along with Wall Street giants like BlackRock and Fidelity, is also exploring the possibility of introducing a spot Bitcoin ETF. A spot ETF would enable a broader array of investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin\u2019s spot price instead of its future value, which is currently only accessible to accredited investors.\n\nSo far, the SEC has been hesitant to approve this type of ETF, citing regulatory concerns.\n\nAccelerated Approval Amid Government Shutdown Concerns\n\nInterestingly, Valkyrie had initially planned to roll out its fund on October 3. However, concerns over a potential U.S. government shutdown prompted the SEC to fast-track the approval process for Ethereum futures ETFs. If Congress fails to agree on funding, the government could cease most operations, affecting nearly two million federal workers and possibly disrupting SEC activities.\n\nValkyrie\u2019s Chief Investment Officer, Steven McClurg, expressed satisfaction with the SEC\u2019s decision in an interview with Fox Business.\n\n\u201cWe are thrilled to be the first to offer ether futures to our investors as interest in the asset has grown exponentially over the past year,\u201d he said.\n\nThe firm plans to convert its existing Bitcoin futures ETF into a combined fund offering both Bitcoin and Ethereum futures, with trading set to begin today.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s accelerated approval timeline also hints at the agency\u2019s attempt to maintain market stability in case of a government shutdown. Earlier this week, the SEC delayed decisions on other spot Bitcoin ETF applications, including one from Ark 21Shares, a fund owned by tech investor Cathie Wood.\n\nOn the legislative front, SEC Chairman Gary Gensler urged companies planning to go public to expedite their efforts before a possible government shutdown. A shutdown would force the agency to operate with a reduced workforce, affecting its ability to oversee the markets and public offerings.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s approval of Valkyrie Investments\u2019 Ethereum futures ETF represents another step toward the maturation of the crypto market in the U.S. While the SEC remains cautious, particularly concerning spot ETFs, it has shown a willingness to accommodate futures-based products.\n\nWith other firms lining up to offer similar products, competition in the Ether ETF space is bound to intensify."

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s Vitalik Buterin Lists \u2018Worthwhile\u2019 Ideas for Developers to Work On\n\nVitalik Buterin. Source: a video screenshot, KryptoSeoul / YouTube\n\nEthereum (ETH) co-founder Vitalik Buterin has listed several points that he argues are worth working on, during the ETH Seoul 2022, an Ethereum and blockchain-focused event held in South Korea.\n\nIn the first place, the Ethereum mastermind encouraged developers to build rollups, a type of scaling solution that involves rolling-up transactions and presenting them as a single transaction to decrease costs while increasing speed.\n\nHe specifically emphasized the growth of zero-knowledge technologies, and the need for more work on zero-knowledge rollups, aka zk-rollups. Buterin said that succinct non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs (zk-SNARKs), a proof architecture where one can demonstrate ownership of specific knowledge without disclosing that knowledge, are almost as important as the blockchain technology itself.\n\n\u201cI actually think zk-SNARKs might be like almost or even equally as important to the f,,,] privacy, openness, and [\u2026] freedom kind of alternative. decentralized, web tech movement as blockchains are,\u201d Buterin said.\n\nHe said zk-SNARKs are \u201cextremely\u201d effective at giving users privacy and scalability while preserving security, which is comparable to what blockchains are trying to do. He added that zero-knowledge proofs can actually act as a compliment to blockchains.\n\nBlockchains aim to provide a lot of security, but in exchange, they sacrifice privacy and scalability. On the other hand, zk-SNARKs give back privacy and scalability \u2013 \u201cso build ZK apps,\u201d Buterin said.\n\nHe further encouraged developers to focus on privacy, claiming that it is less explored compared to scalability.\n\nNotably, there are already some attempts to create protocols focused on preserving privacy. For instance, there is Proof of Humanity (PoH), a social identity verification system for humans developed on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\n\u201cIn Ethereum, we are starting to have more and more of these protocols. They are issuing some kind of attestation at specific addresses to say something about the person who controls that address,\u201d Buterin said, adding that such protocols can make airdrops and decentralized governance fairer by removing identical users.\n\nProof of Attendance Protocol (POAP), a protocol that creates digital badges or collectibles through the use of blockchain technology, is another such project. This protocol can confirm that an address belongs to someone who participated in an event without revealing the identity of the person.\n\nButerin also encouraged developers to consider working on soulbound tokens, which are tokens that can\u2019t be sold or separated from their owners.\n\nHe has been very vocal about these tokens recently. After initially exploring the idea in a blog post earlier this year, Buterin co-authored a research paper in mid-May explaining how non-transferable Soulbound Tokens (SBTs) can create a richer, pluralistic ecosystem within Ethereum. Buterin suggested that soulbound tokens would be able to encode social relationships of trust.\n\nThese tokens could be used for exclusive airdrops, or \u201csouldrops,\u201d allowing an organization to choose the right members based on their needs.\n\nAnother area that Buterin argues developers should try to improve is public goods funding. He noted that Bitcoiners already have a public goods funding called quadratic funding, which is a more optimal way to fund public goods.\n\nHowever, he said that there are opportunities to improve quadratic funding by making the mechanism better, and by increasing security and privacy.\n\nLastly, Buterin said that developers should aim for better decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) governance. He said the current governance model in DAOs is either centralized or attackable, due to the coin-based governance that they employ.\n\nButerin claimed that the coin-based governance is \u201cfundamentally broken,\u201d encouraging developers to consider governance models that are not coin-driven. This is also where things like souldbound tokens and Proof of Humanity can prove useful as they can help make sure only real and unique humans are participating in governance.\n\n____\n\nLearn more:\n\n\u2013 EthereumPoW Fork Won\u2019t \u2018Significantly\u2019 Harm Ethereum \u2013 Vitalik Buterin\n\n\u2013 Vitalik Buterin says The Merge is Not \u2018Priced in\u2019 as Investor Promises to Fork Ethereum\n\n\n\n\u2013 6 Key Points in Vitalik Buterin\u2019s Vision for Ethereum Presented at EthCC\n\n\u2013 Vitalik Buterin Confirms Post-Merge Ethereum Centralization Concerns, Urges Not to \u2018Overly Catastrophize\u2019 It\n\n\n\n\u2013 Top Blockchain Non-Financial Applications According to Vitalik Buterin\n\n\u2013 Layer 2 in 2022: Get Ready for Rollups, Bridges, New Apps, Life With Ethereum 2.0, and Layer 3"

        "content": "Coinbase Exec: Altcoin Markets Attracting Institutional Investors Amid Bitcoin and Ethereum Dominance\n\nDavid Duong. Source: a video screenshot, Scott Melker / YouTube\n\nWhile bitcoin (BTC) and ethereum (ETH) remain the top coins, altcoins are still drawing significant interest from institutional investors, argued David Duong, Head of Institutional Research at major crypto exchange Coinbase.\n\nDuong participated in a discussion with popular crypto analyst Scott Melker on March 2, as part of an interview panel that also featured the Founder of crypto options trading platform Hxro Dan Gunsberg and the Founder of investment adviser Morgan Creek Capital Mark Yusko.\n\nDiscussing the crypto market performance over the past year, Duong noted that what he is currently seeing in terms of flows on the exchange from Coinbase\u2019s institutional clients is that,\n\n\u201c55% of this is still on bitcoin and ETH, but that would mean that the remainder is still on altcoin \u2013 so there\u2019s still a lot of attention being paid to what\u2019s happening in the rest of the ecosystem outside of just Bitcoin and Ethereum.\u201d\n\nWhat we are currently witnessing in the market is a lot more macro-focused, he added, arguing that people don\u2019t realize that this is \u201cjust seasonally a weaker period for a lot of risk assets\u201d because everything is now in an in-between state where, on the one side, \u201cpeople have their bonus payments, putting money into their 401(k)\u201d, which are personal pension accounts in the USA, and on the other side, it is the time \u201cright before we\u2019re getting a lot of checks being cut for tax season.\u201d\n\nTherefore, Duong said,\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in this kind of like weak period, but we\u2019re trying to draw conclusions about what\u2019s happening with the [Federal Reserve] or what\u2019s happening with other things, the correlation, which by the way is coming down between crypto and other risk assets.\u201d\n\nHe concluded that, \u201cif anything\u201d, macro conditions for risk assets including crypto are neutral at the moment. However, he did warn that in the second quarter of this year, \u201cwe\u2019re going to hit into the real to debt ceiling issues\u201d when the economy could potentially become weaker.\n\nMelker also commented that we\u2019ve seen \u201cmini-narratives\u201d related to altcoins, but that these seem \u201cmuch smaller and quicker bubbles than the altcoin narratives we used to see in the past,\u201d he said, adding that,\n\nIt seems like \u201cthis is that old sort of washing machine cycle of crypto native people just moving in and out of altcoin narratives with no new money coming in.\u201d\n\nIt does seem very hyper-cyclical compared to what was seen in the past, Duong agreed, adding that we seem to be \u201cmoving very quickly [into it] and then kind of out of it pretty fast.\u201d\n\nAs to how new money would enter the space, Yusko argued that, among other things, it\u2019s people realizing that they\u2019ve got the institutional quality real assets that are uncorrelated, saying that \u201cbitcoin is the most uncorrelated asset I\u2019ve ever seen in my career.\u201d\n\nSpring is here and summer is coming\n\nAccording to Morgan Creek Capital\u2019s Yusko, it is now indeed crypto spring \u2013 but \u201cspring isn\u2019t summer.\u201d Spring comes with unstable weather: it\u2019s \u201cwindy and choppy,\u201d though he admitted that he didn\u2019t see \u201cHurricane Sam\u201d coming, referring to the fall of the FTX exchange and its founder Sam Bankman-Fried.\n\nSummer is coming, however, he suggested, especially with the Bitcoin halving approaching, as well as the incoming Ethereum Shanghai fork.\n\nGunsberg said that, looking at the Bitcoin Futures curve, there are higher prices on the horizon.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s actually a yield being delivered, something that we didn\u2019t see for a while. And that to me, and I\u2019ve been in crypto since 2015, has always been \u2013 ever since they started actually having trading futures, which maybe was like 2017-2018 \u2013 it\u2019s always been a good lead indicator for me of seeing is price higher out in the future.\u201d\n\nOnce the prices go up, Gunsberg said, the crowd comes and takes it even higher, which is a \u201cvery powerful [\u2026] feedback loop in on itself,\u201d but then it also drives the price lower, and \u201cthat is what to me embodies so much of this kind of longer-term volatility that you see in crypto.\u201d\n\nMelker concluded that, unless there is a massive Black Swan event,\n\n\u201cWe actually have a good chance that it\u2019s bottoms in. I also think we\u2019re going to chop sideways and it\u2019s going to be really annoying for quite a long time.\u201d\n\nYou can watch the full interview here:\n\n____\n\nLearn more:\n\n\u2013 Crypto Experts Predict These New Altcoins to See Price Pump Because of Strong Use Cases\n\n\u2013 Crypto Analysts are Saying These Altcoins Have Huge Potential \u2013 Here\u2019s Why\n\n\n\n\u2013 While NEO Price Explodes, These 3 Altcoins May 10x This Year\n\n\u2013 While Aptos Price Explodes, These Cryptos Might 10x in 2023\n\n\n\n\u2013 What Are Altcoins and How Do They Differ From Bitcoin?\n\n\u2013 How To Buy Altcoins"

        "title": "Solana Price Prediction as SOL Dips Below $10 Before Ethereum Founder Vitalik Buterin Comes to the Rescue ... - Cryptonews",
        "content": "Solana\u2019s price has been experiencing a drop in value due to concerns that Sam Bankman-Fried and venture capital firms may sell their tokens. This has caused SOL\u2019s price to fall below $10 for the first time in over a year and a half. However, the price may be seeing a recovery due to positive comments from Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, who praised the Solana network for its development progress and thriving ecosystem.\n\nSOL must reclaim support above $10 to validate a possible V-Shaped recovery to $14.53.\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin recently tweeted about the current state of the Solana blockchain ecosystem. According to Buterin, he has been informed that there is a strong and dedicated developer community within Solana. However, he also mentioned that the fate of this community may be uncertain due to the recent exit of \u201copportunistic money\u201d seekers. Despite this, Buterin stated that he believes the Solana blockchain has a bright future.\n\nDespite being an outsider to the Solana community, Buterin expressed hope that the community will be given a fair chance to thrive.\n\nButerin\u2019s input on the Solana ecosystem has been seen as a positive sign by many in the cryptocurrency community. His endorsement could potentially pave the way for the rebirth of the once-thriving Solana community and blockchain.\n\nSolana Price Taps Fresh Liquidity Under $10, $14.53 Beckoning?\n\nSolana\u2019s price has recently fallen below a crucial support level that it has not seen since February 2021, leading to concerns of further losses. However, Vitalik Buterin\u2019s recent comments has provided some optimism for the future of the network. As a result, Solana\u2019s price has slightly rebounded and is currently trading at around $9.48, recovering slightly from a low point of $8.\n\nSOL/USD eight-hour chart\n\nBulls must throw all their weight behind SOL to reclaim support above $10 and confirm a possible buy signal from the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator.\n\nTraders will look out for the MACD (line in blue) to cross above the signal line (in red) before triggering their buy orders. The Stochastic already shows that buyers are gaining momentum as it carries on with the uptrend from the oversold area (below 20.00)) into the neutral area (between 20.00 and 80.00).\n\nA V-shaped recovery pattern will likely guide Solana price on a northbound move to $14.53, where many traders would be looking to book profits. This pattern comes into the picture after an extended downtrend leading to oversold market conditions. If SOL breaks above the falling dotted trend line, it may push to $14.53 (medium-term hurdle) and $18.82, if the momentum continues.\n\nAltcoins to Consider for Shorter Term Gains\n\nWith broader cryptocurrency markets having performed poorly in recent weeks, investors may be looking to diversify their holdings with the pre-sale tokens of promising, up-and-coming cryptocurrency projects.\n\nFightOut (FGHT) \u2013 Presale Launched\n\nThey say, \u201cit takes a community to raise a child,\u201d and FightOut believes it takes commitment and incentives to encourage a community to lead a healthy lifestyle. FightOut is approaching the fitness industry in a way not done before, at least not by existing Move-to-Earn (M2E) crypto platforms such as SweatCoin and STEPN.\n\nThe team behind FightOut is committed to changing the fitness industry one gym at a time with the help of an M2E fitness app. Users who join the platform will be rewarded for completing workouts and predetermined challenges.\n\nFightOut aims to purchase a chain of gyms around the world for its members, as it plans to ease the masses into Web3 using the metaverse.\n\nThe FGHT presale is underway and is selling out fast. So far, $2.47 million has been raised and 1 FGHT costs 0.0166 USDT.\n\nVisit FightOut Now\n\nDash 2 Trade (D2T) \u2013 Presale Ends in 7 Days\n\nThose interested in investing in a promising crypto trading platform start-up should look no further than Dash 2 Trade. The up-and-coming analytics and social trading platform hopes to take the crypto trading space by storm with its host of unique features.\n\nThese include trading signals, social sentiment and on-chain indicators, a pre-sale token scoring system, a token listing alert system and a strategy back-testing tool. Dash 2 Trade\u2019s ecosystem will be powered by the D2T token, which users will need to buy and hold in order to access the platform\u2019s features.\n\nDash 2 Trade is currently conducting a token pre-sale at highly discounted rates and sales recently surpassed $11.5 million.

        "content": "Ethereum layer-2 scaling solutions Starknet and zkSync are among the few platforms to have increased their total monthly active developer counts over the last 12 months, data shows.\n\nWhile Starknet and zkSync only recorded increases of 3% and 6%, respectively, the likes of Ethereum, Polygon and Solana saw their counts fall by 23%, 43% and 57%, respectively, over the same timeframe, according to an updated developer report by Electric Capital, which provided data up to Oct. 1.\n\nTotal monthly active developers fell 27.7% from 26,701 developers to 19,279, reflecting a wider downward trend in developers over the last 12 months.\n\nMonthly active developers in the cryptocurrency ecosystem since 2015. Source: Electric Capital\n\nChainlink, Stellar, Aztec Protocol and Ripple also increased their developer counts as of Oct. 1, though their total monthly active developers were lower than zkSync and Starknet.\n\nStarkWare\u2019s Starknet and Matter Labs\u2019 zkSync are layer 2 solutions aimed at scaling Ethereum through zero-knowledge rollups, which have become a focal point in 2023.\n\nMuch of Starknet\u2019s focus of late has revolved around its \u201cQuantum Leap,\u201d which went live in July. It can theoretically increase Ethereum\u2019s transactions per second (TPS) from around 13\u201315 to 37 TPS consistently and up to 90 TPS in some cases.\n\nStarknet and zkSync have also been working on zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine (zkEVM) solutions to further scale Ethereum throughout 2023.\n\nDevelopers at zkSync have also been building a network of \u201chyperchains\u201d to create an ecosystem of interoperable protocols and sovereign chains as part of its zero-knowledge tech stack.

Claim your free Q4 trading guide now!\n\nRecommended by Manish Jaradi Get Your Free Oil Forecast Get My Guide\n\nBITCOIN: Takes on vital resistance\n\nBitcoin continues to be well supported, now testing a formidable resistance on the 200-day moving average, roughly coinciding with the end-August high of 28150. This follows a hold last month above strong support at the June low of 24750, which has kept intact the higher-top-higher-bottom formation since the end of 2022. Importantly, this keeps alive the possibility of an extended recovery given the 2021-2022 decline and the possibility of Bitcoin shedding some of its underperformance Vs Ethereum in recent years.\n\nBTC/USD Daily Chart\n\nChart Created by Manish Jaradi Using TradingView\n\nAny decisive break above 28150 could clear the path toward the July high of 31800, which would be a significant resistance to crack. A cross-over would trigger a double bottom (the 2023 lows) and importantly reinforce the bullish medium-term trajectory, first highlighted earlier this year \u2013 see \u201cBitcoin Technical Outlook: BTC/USD Turns Bullish\u201d, published January 18.\n\nBTC/USD Vs ETH/USD Daily Chart\n\nChart Created by Manish Jaradi Using TradingView\n\nThe potential price objective of the double bottom pattern (the June and the September lows) works out to around 39000. Such a move would imply a break above the 89-week moving average and a cross above the upper edge of the Ichimoku cloud on the weekly charts \u2013 for the first time since 2022. For the bullish view to unfold, BTC/USD needs to stay above the June low of 24750.\n\n-Curious to learn how market positioning can affect asset prices? Our sentiment guide holds the insights\u2014download it now!\n\nRecommended by Manish Jaradi Improve your trading with IG Client Sentiment Data Get My Guide\n\nETHEREUM: Beginning to look vulnerable\n\nThe lack of a meaningful upward momentum in recent weeks raises the risk of Ethereum staging a secondary/lower high on the weekly charts, relative to early 2023. This would be the first time since the recovery started in late 2022 that the higher-highs-higher-lows sequence would be broken. ETH/USD in August fell below crucial support on the 200-day moving average for the first time since January.\n\nETH/USD Weekly Chart\n\nChart Created by Manish Jaradi Using TradingView\n\nAs highlighted in the previous update, the retreat from key resistance on the 89-day moving average earlier this month coupled with the subsequent fall below the June low keeps the bearish bias intact. ETH/USD is now attempting to break below the key cushion at the August low of 1550. A decisive break below could initially pave the way toward the lower edge of a downtrend channel since April (now at about 1450), potentially the October low of 1370.\n\nETH/USD Daily Chart\n\nChart Created by Manish Jaradi Using TradingView\n\nOn the weekly charts, ETH/USD has been under the influence of the bearish Ichimoku cloud cover and appears to be now succumbing to the cloud pressure. For the immediate downside risks to fade, Ethereum needs to surpass 1750, including the end of August and the early-October highs.\n\nIf you're puzzled by trading losses, why not take a step in the right direction?

Joel is also a serial entrepreneur and intellectual historian who helped found several key initiatives in the cryptocurrency space, including Ethereum. Wow, never heard of it. Metamask ever heard of it again, the first smart contract educational channel and the first academic work on crypto-economics. His research interests focus on the confluence of blockchain network topologies, and swarm intelligence, especially how the principles undergoing decentralized organizations can be used to fuel global innovation. He also works on holonic philosophy, the evolution of jurisprudence, data-driven approaches to innovation, and smart city data architecture. Wow, I can barely read half those words there. Without further ado, I\u2019m very pleased to welcome Joel Dietz to the Cryptonews Podcast. Joel, welcome to show my friend.\n\nJoel Dietz\n\nOh, no pleasure to be here.\n\nMatt Zahab\n\nJoel, super pumped to have you on man, you have an absolutely bananas background. I got to start with Ethereum and MetaMask. These are applications pieces of software, very powerful that I use almost every single day. I couldn\u2019t imagine navigating web3 without Metamask. When you and the team built this founded this, did you ever think that this would play such an integral part of web3?\n\nJoel Dietz\n\nOh, yeah, it wasn\u2019t, you know, the first you know, working group Skype groups. And I think we talked about the flip bidding back then, you know, the day that the market cap of Ethereum would flip that a Bitcoin. So I don\u2019t know why. But it just feels like there was on the day the white paper came out there were at least 20 or 30 of us that were convinced basically of this, this would happen. And we fed off of each other so.\n\nMatt Zahab\n\nAnd can you walk me through like the process of creating? Let\u2019s start with ETH, for example. What was that, like any crazy stories with Vitalik, any, any stories that you would love to tell, you know, 30 years down the road to perhaps the average Joe or Josephine wouldn\u2019t be cognizant of?\n\nJoel Dietz\n\nYeah, I mean, first of all, I\u2019ll say that, you know, there were probably 50 people involved in the early days of Ethereum. And most of us were engineers by training. And most of the work that needed to be done to build Ethereum was the engineering side of it. So there was so much to be built. And I contributed a little bit, but mainly on the educational side, and kind of bring awareness and building some of the first channels to in that area. So and just in general, it was it was interesting, because sometimes you find something that is so intuitive to you, but then it\u2019s actually kind of somehow hard to explain, you know, to other people. And I worked really hard on that. Because, you know, for at least a while I was the person spending the most effort on trying to educate people who were, you know, necessarily not as technical as some of the core Devs. That\u2019s it.\n\nMatt Zahab\n\nThat must have been nightmare fuel back in the day educating people on Ethereum. Like, what did that pitch even sound like? But what was the most of the one liner? What was the elevator pitch? How would you convince people that we created this, you know, bonkers cryptocurrency, and it\u2019s gonna be the future.\n\nJoel Dietz\n\nYeah, as you probably picked up just from my scripts, I have a bit of academic disposition. And I suppose like to talk about it from the aspect of the nature of money and what money is, you know, and I often said, you know, that, basically, you know, Bitcoin was the first digitization of money, where you could basically transfer some value to one person. And then, you know, Ethereum was the first programmable money. So basically, if I have a token that represents a value, whether it\u2019s a bottle of beer, or a crystal or a gold coin, but then I can put instructions inside of it and say, Okay, now go to Matt after 10 minutes, or now go to Matt after 10 minutes if Atlas says yes, and that sort of idea of building program logic into currency had basically never been done before. And that opens up a whole lot of different possibilities, including new types of organizations, you know, new types of funding DAOs and I could go on for a long time about DAOs, but usually don\u2019t try to do that on the first conversation or at least first few sentences.\n\nMatt Zahab\n\nOh, yeah. Well, we\u2019ll get to DAOs later is still a very trendy topic and a lot of people are very, very much so butchering DAOs nowadays, where it\u2019s still a almost completely centralized organization whole not a lot of autonomy either, but again, we\u2019ll get into that. We\u2019ll jump back into ETH in a couple minutes but I want to move over to Metamask. Metamask is just absolutely incredible. It\u2019s one of the best things about crypto in my opinion. It\u2019s so easy to house everything right from your browser or right from your mobile device. One of the best logos in the space to I have a kinship and love for that little orange Fox, what was it like building this application? Did you guys think that it would be something that people use every single day right now?\n\nJoel Dietz\n\nUm, it\u2019s good question. You know, to me, it was kind of an obvious thing, basically, at DEVCON zero, that people would consume dApps primarily through the browser, I think I was the only person who thought that, but I managed to convince Vitalik. Obviously, influential, and who had some control over the dev grants program, and I also managed to convince Gavin wood. So that was basically the formal birth. And I guess, later on, Joe Lubin was convinced, maybe six months after that, or something. So the Yeah, kind of formal process behind that was just kind of I don\u2019t know, somehow, somehow obvious to me. Now, you know, how to get from A to B. Again, like lots of engineering effort involved. Thankfully, I, my career has been as an engineer for the most part. So I, I can estimate that and know, roughly speaking, like what fits together. But yeah, I, as to the specifics, you know, we did kind of say that to the Y Combinator people in the in the interview, you know, that this was like a big thing. And Ethereum was a big thing. And smart contracts were a big thing. And they kind of were skeptical, you know, so it was it was kind of an uphill battle, even with these kind of, like, you know, reasonably respectable and smart VCs in Silicon Valley at the time, who, I guess didn\u2019t take Ethereum very seriously, back in, I guess, mid 2015 or something?\n\nMatt Zahab\n\nProbably a small regret on their end. What How did you convince Vitalik that Metamask would be so important than having a browser based extension? Would be the spot where most people would house all their ERC 20 tokens with that combo sound like because again, you what you just said, Joel, is you were like, Oh, it was, you know, so obvious to me, and I\u2019m sure it was, you\u2019re very switched on dude. But like, clearly, it wasn\u2019t obvious to anyone else. But how did you had you? Had you pitch them? How do you close them?\n\nJoel Dietz\n\nI guess I don\u2019t know, kind of, like, I\u2019ll say aggressive closing style. But I think I was also the only person at DEVCON zero who was doing like CrossFit in the morning. Like, basically, I went up every morning to, you know, do you know, my burpees and pull ups and stuff before the rest of everyone was doing their technical talks? And you know, there\u2019s just a certain, you know, like, let\u2019s go, let\u2019s go kind of mentality that comes out of that particular like, performance fitness crew. And, you know, I guess I\u2019ve been I know, somehow I\u2019m ingrain that over time. And so I always try to push things forward at the pace that, you know, I wanted to, which often isn\u2019t the pace that other institutions are ready to go, but actually, interestingly enough, Vitalik when he stayed at my house, and Silicon Valley, did CrossFit with us kind of exercises in the morning, so I guess a little bit of that exposure, and maybe it was even from the aspect of him having done that, that he was like, you know, whatever Joel is doing he\u2019s probably serious about it. No.\n\nMatt Zahab\n\nLook, I I\u2019m in I\u2019m in no position to turn Vitalik he\u2019s the GOAT but like, I can\u2019t see him in his noodle arms doing CrossFit. Like.\n\nJoel Dietz\n\nInteresting thing to see. I kind of wish I could do it honestly. And I didn\u2019t expect him to like get up in the morning and come join us for our little CrossFit routine. But he did so props to Vitalik.\n\nMatt Zahab\n\nYou know how viral that would go today that\u2019s like him with his you know, with his hammer in his pants, the classic photo that went viral about a month ago. You know, the one I\u2019m talking about? With his long present in his pants if that was a schlong if it was good for him. He\u2019s got a healthy one. But yeah, you don\u2019t know that what it went like that without that break the internet Vitalik doing CrossFit? Are you kidding me? And it\u2019s like PJ\u2019s are in a crazy Vitalik outfit was noodle arms.\n\nJoel Dietz\n\nI really have some interesting things if you say goodbye, you know repository of photos and videos from that time period. I don\u2019t know I mean, I didn\u2019t really go back and search but.\n\nMatt Zahab\n\nThat\u2019d be a good NFT collection you know OG Vitalik NFT collection.\n\nJoel Dietz\n\nOh, yeah. Good point. Yeah, for sure.\n\nMatt Zahab\n\nThat could pop off while I\u2019m I still don\u2019t know why and this is quite perverse, but I\u2019m just trying to picture what it would look like doing CrossFit. Anyways, back to show here. Metamask so many people have been asking about a Metamask token. Everyone wants it, you know, good old cheeky airdrops similar to you know, an ENS type AirDrop, where you buy a couple domains, and here\u2019s a couple 1000 bucks, including love that that was incredible. Will we ever see a Metamask token?\n\nJoel Dietz\n\nSo I do have to clarify. So I haven\u2019t been involved really in Metamask for five years or whatever. So and the way Joe Lubin tells this story, is he hired them the devs basically into consensus, and then they started rebuilding effectively the project a second time. So I don\u2019t really have any involvement with it currently, and I wish them success in whatever they do. I do hope they, you know, whatever credit me appropriately with the tokens that are planning to issue and all of that, but not, you know, everyone has the same respect, I guess, for founders out there. So.\n\nMatt Zahab\n\nI mean, in your, in your opinion, Joel, like, do you think it would be good for the ecosystem to launch some type of governance token that would almost act as a DAO?\n\nJoel Dietz\n\nWell, it\u2019s so is it as you bring this up today, because I was just reviewing some of this legal paperwork that we had for Metamask. And, and other people were actually picking up on some of the things because we had a few different legal conferences, specifically around this topic back in like 2015, as to how to do like DAO collaborative DAO governance. And in fact, that original governance contracts of Metamask had this embedded in it. So there was like, a collaborative, you know, basically token voting system to decide how the project would evolve. And I think for certain types of community projects, it makes a lot of sense of baby to early when it\u2019s an early stage. But, you know, Metamask is like, it could go in different directions. Obviously, it has an enterprise version of it. And I think, you know, having a private enterprise thing is great, frankly, you know, custodial wallets, all of that. But the, you know, the community driven things, I think there\u2019s a point in kind of turning at least certain aspects of things over the community, once something reaches a certain scale. So I will be super supportive of Metamask, kind of going back in that direction, and maybe even returning to some of these original legal contracts.\n\nMatt Zahab\n\nInteresting.\n\nJoel Dietz\n\nThere\u2019s a legal scholars, you know, from around the world that were really pushing this sort of integration between collaborative governance and DAOs basically, we call it\u2019s called the DCO at the time, and it kind of got off the ground, but never like, fully with like, you know, a reasonable sized project.\n\nMatt Zahab\n\nThat would be the hardest AirDrop present day, whether I guess we\u2019re an Opensea and Opensea or Metamask token that would break web three, in the best of ways possible.\n\nJoel Dietz\n\nWell, yeah, I mean, who knows, maybe the current dev team of Metamask is still open and interested in those more, you know, collaborative side of things. I know that, that the consensus, as you know, organization has kind of gone in and out of it a little bit, you know, but there are hard things to do. So, you know, to pull off, like, appropriately. And it goes back to the DAO question you mentioned before, like DAO has become really centralized, it\u2019s very easy to, you know, control things from behind the scenes. I think that\u2019s kind of one of the things that people have said and some of the, you know, I don\u2019t say like people blacken Ethereum\u2019s reputation from time to time. But you know, the, the story of what\u2019s actually going on versus like, what\u2019s happening behind the scenes is, you know, sometimes it seems like there\u2019s a bit of a gap there. So.\n\nMatt Zahab\n\nYou\u2019re bang on there. That\u2019s getting very interesting. Can we see what happens there? Let\u2019s move forward and jump into your new project. MetaMetaverse. Absolutely popping off you once. Perhaps all in is the wrong word. But you\u2019ve put a lot of eggs in this basket. What before we get into metal Metaverse itself? What tickles your fancy so much about the metaverse? Why? Why go all in on the metaverse and 2022?\n\nJoel Dietz\n\nWell, I like to say Metaverse is three different tracks, I think I explained is different from everyone else out there. So full disclosure, but one of them is you know, tokens web three, like all that governance, like that kind of stuff. Another one is like AR VR, like gaming experiences and stuff like that. And another one is basically the neuroscience of the brain and psychedelic research and all those things where we like tap into the brain and how it works and kind of get integrated at that level.\n\nMatt Zahab\n\nInteresting. That\u2019s I haven\u2019t heard that take before.\n\nJoel Dietz\n\nYeah, no one, as far as I know, really explains it that way. But those are the convergence of interests that brought me into wanting to do things into metaverse. And it\u2019s partially because I see Metaverse at some fundamental level even a philosophical level as like form of communication, where basically we go from a lossy form of communication, and on unreliable form of communication to something that is like highly upgraded and has a lot more visual density and other kind of like density associated with it.\n\nMatt Zahab\n\nOkay, you just made my head spin here, Joel, and in the best of ways. Normally I would start with numero uno, but let\u2019s go straight to numero tres. The psychological psychedelic, sort of all up in the brain that you talked about. Can you go into the depths on that? Like, are we talking neuro link, are we talking, you know, micro dosing psilocybin or LSD or other psychedelic compounds to tap into the metaverse like, Give me Give me your thesis on this, I\u2019m very intrigued by this.\n\nJoel Dietz\n\nYeah, so I just go back to communication or, you know, extended, you know, states of consciousness. But, you know, say you were able to visualize something in your brain, right, and you\u2019re like, I want to share this with you, usually 99.9%, meeting our eyes together does not actually allow you to share the idea. But you have like this pink version of the Eiffel Tower in your head, and you really want me to see it, right. So now we could draw it, if I get communicated verbally, but if it\u2019s something like you don\u2019t know what the Eiffel Tower is, and I start saying, hey, it\u2019s a pink version of the Eiffel Tower, like, it\u2019s not going to get across, right, so and the more complex, the idea is, the more challenging it is for basically me to get it from my, you know, brain into your brain. And, and there are various forms of communicating. Now, psychedelics are kind of in that direction, but they\u2019re kind of unreliable, like, you take a psychedelic, and I think the psychedelic, and we\u2019re gonna have wildly varying experiences. And unless we spend a lot of time drawing them, it\u2019s gonna be hard to see, you know, where they overlap. Whereas virtual reality, on the other hand, you put on a headset that I handed to you, you put it on, we\u2019re gonna have basically the same experience, and be able to then communicate it afterwards or, you know, translate it into something. So, you know, I think that\u2019s one of the benefits. And again, use something like neuro link, and, you know, we\u2019re still digging into the kind of brain thing, but if I can do the same thing, you know, with a more direct kind of neuron based stimulus, or I\u2019ve seen the ones that use, you know, facial muscles, and things like that, to do various control mechanisms. It\u2019s accelerating, that basically, it\u2019s allowing for more rapid and reliable communication about complex objects.\n\nMatt Zahab\n\nHow far away are we, from this becoming a reality, like, you know, like you and I being able to stare into each other\u2019s eyes, and me being able to know that you\u2019re thinking of a pink Eiffel Tower.\n\nJoel Dietz\n\nUm, I think as well as thank you know, that they exist, but it\u2019s not like widely distributed, you know, and there\u2019s various forms of getting there. But I would say that I could guess like, maybe 15 years to a consumer product. So like, within our lifetimes, would be my guess. And even then it\u2019s probably likely to be like a high end consumer project. Yeah. But there\u2019s probably some low level versions that will be there much sooner. You know, for example, like, if I can use my patiently, just saying, Not non hand motions, whatever else, and I have some pre loaded things, you know, in like a version of Google Glass or whatever the next kind of version of that is. And then I can basically toggle and say, hey, you know, this is, from the set of ideas I have, and communicate, I think we\u2019re gonna get there much, much quicker. But it will be like, let\u2019s say, a more limited vocabulary where I have, you know, like, right, there\u2019s like, all these games, you know, there\u2019s like, 10 common commands that everyone uses it over and over again, I think we\u2019ll kind of see like, that version happened, the quickest, probably.\n\nMatt Zahab\n\nOkay, so that was number three. And again, you blew my mind there. Number one was, you said, the tokens and the sharing of information and financial assets, right? And tying those two together? How does one and three, how do they intertwine?\n\nJoel Dietz\n\nUm, well, basically, we\u2019ve got this meta URL system, it\u2019s to address like, basically any type of experience. So it could be something and effectively, right now, it was what works for any kind of Euclidean space, which basically means like all of normal physics, and spaces in the physical Earth, or faces and different metalverses, but anything that\u2019s sort of like a 3d space, we can address it basically. And we can create a unique string URL, basically, that applies to that space. And, and we can basically extend the same concept of space into other types of experiences, like smells and pheromones and more difficult to, like, visualize their C version of it. And the benefit of this basically, is making it accessible and universalizability effectively, so we can, you know, communicate about the same things, if that makes sense.\n\nMatt Zahab\n\nLike, how, how would you tie an address to a smell.\n\nJoel Dietz\n\nUm, that\u2019s, you know, among the more tricky things, you know, but basically, you know, once I have this concept of this URL, string string, I mean, sometimes it\u2019s not that different from like, what IPFS has and things like that. Um, Then I can basically drop a payload in it. And then to specify, you know, right now for we do this already, basically for what rendering engine is needed to render the experience. So we support natively Unreal Engine five, which is the best one for kind of visual assets, and then the file type, you know, and, you know, basically anything that is a smell, or pheromone, or whatever else would still have the concept of a rendering engine, we\u2019re only a certain type of machine basically, that can take that, you know, let\u2019s say, let\u2019s take a slightly simpler example, like you are going into a space in a Metaverse, you know, called Sandbox, Decentraland, you know, one of our kind of meta verses on our platform. And there, you want there to be a blue mist, right? So misters are a technology that exists, right, you have misters, they, they\u2019re connected to current audio visual systems. And, you know, you can push a button on a, you know, standard mixing board and get your login, you know, whatever, smoke smoke machine to start puffing up smoke. So all you need to do basically is take that same technology is already developed, and integrate it into the localized version of it. So instead of just being like, I push the button and the smoke comes out into the whatever, DJ booth, you know, venue, I basically walk into a space, let\u2019s say in Sandbox, and then boom, like all those blue smoke starts like pouring over my, you know, little home office. And that is actually not that hard to build like that technology all exists, it just kind of needs this little glue in between. And the glue in between basically goes from a 3d spatial experience all the way to the you know, spectrum of all of these other that\u2019s a non visual experiences that people are having, and don\u2019t necessarily have an easy way of cataloging right now.\n\nMatt Zahab\n\nSo your digitizing experiences.\n\nJoel Dietz\n\nYeah, I think that\u2019s great way of describing it. Yeah. making them accessible, making them universalize usable.\n\nMatt Zahab\n\nYeah. Crazy.\n\nJoel Dietz\n\nI\u2019m like the Aristotle of experience.\n\nMatt Zahab\n\nWow, so many different things. I want to ask you, but y\u2019all, we don\u2019t have enough time. Geez. Okay. I want to it seems like, again, reading your bio lurking your Twitter. You love history. Like you, you have a huge history Boehner, I can tell I\u2019m a history guy myself nowhere. I know 1,000,000th of what you know, most likely, but how does your knowledge of history impact the decisions you make present day? Because it seems like a lot of what you do present day, just from hearing you speak watching and listening to you from other interviews, you know, lurking your Twitter lurking a lot of the content that you\u2019ve released online, I can\u2019t really piece it together. But it seems like your love and passion and knowledge of history has a lot of impact on your present day thinking. Can you try to explain that? And my apologies for throwing words in your mouth is a difficult question. But how does that impact you today?\n\nJoel Dietz\n\nWell, I\u2019ll give one very clear example that relates to the world of crypto, you know, my first response when, you know, reading about Bitcoin back in whatever 2010 was to get a bunch of books about the history of financial systems and markets and how they developed. And I probably read, you know, a couple dozen of them before deciding what to do. And I wouldn\u2019t say my sense of market timing has always been the best, by the way, or maybe like a good historian, maybe not always the best entrepreneur when it comes to hitting the market at the right time. But I basically decided that, you know, it was very similar to what happened when the stock markets were created. And that, you know, cryptocurrency is a lot like equity. But when people first started putting numbers in, you know, Mississippi company shares on paper, people just kind of made up valuations for it, and, you know, pumped them and then, you know, did some other kind of like nasty things as well behind the scenes, you know, where they basically create the fake value companies, and then, you know, whatever shot the journalists or whatever it were basically trying to say, like this company was actually this, like, everyone\u2019s this literally happened, the King of France, you know, basically loved the Mississippi company, because it bailed him out of his own debt. And he wasn\u2019t respected by the aristocrats at that point. But the problem was at the Mississippi company was like, all the people were dying in the swamp, and they would write back letters to France saying, Hey, we\u2019re dying in the swamp, like nothing, there\u2019s no gold here. But did you promise us blah, blah, blah. And then the king of France basically said, like, don\u2019t print those letters. So no one in France could find out what was really going on in Mississippi. So it kind of creates this, you know, crypto economics, so it\u2019s all about incentives, but it can create a skewed sense of incentive sometimes where the king of France was like very incentivized, basically to prevent anyone from figuring out what was actually going on in Mississippi. So, I have been really bullish about crypto and blockchain and the kind and overall idea of crypto economics, but slightly less bullish on the first implementation of it, which I think sometimes the, you know, incentives need to be calibrated, right. And just one core thing that\u2019s part of that, too, also a lesson from history is that people don\u2019t care about money that much like it\u2019s it, they care about it, but not the only thing they care about. And people want to get to a certain level of wealth maybe and, you know, obviously, some people really like showing off their wealth, other people, it doesn\u2019t really matter to them. But the, you know, it\u2019s not the core consideration of everyone on this planet. And they, at some point, like live life in a fuller sense and giving, you know, other things. So another kind of cool story, if I, if I\u2019m allowed to go further, is actually in one of these old Bitcoin lists right now, where I was laying there cheerleading some of the stuff in the Ukraine, I\u2019m actually very actively involved in supporting Ukrainians on the ground through kind of various means. But I personally believe that, you know, the healthy political system, and thing is when people are actively involved in supporting each other people who value freedom, basically. And that\u2019s the only way that freedom survives, is by you know, people coming together to support freedom. And, you know, it wasn\u2019t not everyone was agreeing with me, let\u2019s just say that they were silent. There were, you know, obviously, some voices, but, you know, other people like Curtis, Dr. Van, who you may know, is quite well known for, you know, his stuff and Irbid and popularizing Bitcoin stuff. Basically, the camo the opposite opinion saying, supporting Ukraine as a bunch of feel good ism, and it doesn\u2019t matter. And let\u2019s just let those people go and sit on our Bitcoins, you know, you know, differences of opinion, basically, but serious ones, and they affect, you know, our future political reality, and including which one we live in personally, you know, do you live with people who love freedom, and are willing to pay for it? Or do you live with people who want to sit on their Bitcoins, and you know, a deal with the rest of the world as little as possible?\n\nMatt Zahab\n\nVery, very well said there. I absolutely love, one. I\u2019m a big story guy. And the king of France and Mississippi Corp. is it Mississippi Corp, Mississippi?\n\nJoel Dietz\n\nThe company I think very French name you know, read it in French. Can\u2019t say.\n\nMatt Zahab\n\nMississippi company, that\u2019s such a good story and one that will stick with me so thanks for telling that. Yeah, any couple more questions on history for a sec? Because that was a great little spiel there. What are your favorite resources to learn? Are you like Dan Carlin Hardcore History guy, what\u2019s the best spot to get some good bite sized nuggets on history?\n\nJoel Dietz\n\nWhoo. Um, you know what I just fell in love with recently. It\u2019s kind of it\u2019s like intellectual history. But these graphic guides for among other things, there\u2019s like I just read a graphic Guide to lecan I read a graphic guide to Hegel, I read a graphic guide and Nietzsche prep guide on Nazism. I read a graphic guide on like, you know, whatever, four or five other topics, and they all presented the topics quite clearly and give you like pointers to go and other things and they\u2019re all free on Kindle Unlimited, so I was, yeah.\n\nMatt Zahab\n\nInteresting. I was just gonna ask Where can I find those Kindle Unlimited, okay, shadowed Amazon. Lovely Joel. We\u2019re gonna take a quick break give a massive shout out to a response to show PrimeXBT.

Now back to the show with Joel who\u2019s been dropping absolute knowledge bombs and alpha bombs left right and center. Joel, this has been an absolute treatment. Let\u2019s keep us in here. Back to the metaverse for a sec. Potential the metaverse it\u2019s 2022. It\u2019s been around for a couple years. Last year was probably the first year where we really saw things take off mind you there still aren\u2019t really any true metaverses that are fully playable at the moment. I know Sandbox has the alpha out. I know Decentraland is playable. I know there are experiences in both of them but it\u2019s not good enough to get the masses in what is the potential the metaverse What do you think the future looks like next year? A couple years down the road. 2030 Give us some hot takes here.\n\nJoel Dietz\n\nYeah, to be perfectly honest, I don\u2019t spend that much time on the other metaversus BMZ because I have like an obsessive personality and I like perfecting our own kind of product as much as people as as possible. And I\u2019m a gamer so it\u2019s like the fusion like gaming you know and all these things is very exciting to me, but it also kind of raises the bar a little bit as far as what gamers are used to when it comes to experiences. But I will give some, you know, little bits and one of them as, like, I think we\u2019re gonna, we\u2019re gonna have a little for sure, I hope someone else is working on the same thing or maybe we work together but procedurally generated manner versus where you can like basically go in and the similar to what you can do in like mid journey or some of these AI things and say, I want a Metaverse that has, you know, three planets and, you know, a starship and whatever, or, you know, Star cruiser and this other thing, and then it will kind of spin it up for you. And then you know, I mean, kind of there\u2019s like, similar thing like squiggles or whatever some of these generative art projects, but like the 3d immersive, interactive, you know, kind of version of those things. And of that working right now that I built, and this is like, why don\u2019t go out sometimes, because I\u2019m like, here like.\n\nMatt Zahab\n\nThat is bonkers. So walk me through that. I literally I type in what I want, or I would do a couple lines of code. And the AI generator was the metaverse AI generator will spit out a Metaverse based on what I want.\n\nJoel Dietz\n\nYeah, exactly. So and we have this cool, like practical ideas. So basically, like, you know, you have a planet inside your Metaverse, and you can subdivide that planet and sell real estate on your planet. You can build cities, you can like keep going, you know, and we support, you know, whatever, uploading all the content to IPFS or wherever you want to store it. We\u2019re on our own servers, but you know, you can design the whole metaverse.\n\nMatt Zahab\n\nSo so so this is this is a side project of yours, which is essentially the Shopify of metaverses.\n\nJoel Dietz\n\nYeah, I guess you could call our platform like the Shopify of metaverses like, we\u2019re gonna make it really accessible for people to get their own technology there. And, and, you know, in theory, anyone can put all their own content in there. But we wanted to give people the option of basically pre populating their Metaverse with some kind of content. And, you know, originally was just like, here\u2019s a planet or whatever, here\u2019s a floating island or something like that. But then I got, you know, I would say, carried away by my own idea of what we could do. And I\u2019d actually, I basically, I was sitting with a professor at Harvard, whose name was Peter super who invented gnomic, which is like this super old school like gaming category where you win points basically, based on the, how you change the rules of the game. So it\u2019s like, a super nerdy game, basically. And, and he had the idea basically, of taking it and turning it into this like, Conway\u2019s Game of Life on steroids. I don\u2019t know if you know, you know, Conway\u2019s Game of Life?\n\nMatt Zahab\n\nI don\u2019t, I don\u2019t.\n\nJoel Dietz\n\nAnyways, it\u2019s like this. Basically, it was used as a screensaver on all the supercomputers back when they were first building the first version. And it\u2019s the simple rules basically, for changing the cells that are alive and die. And usually a 2d grid, although there\u2019s, you know, 3d and sort of multiple dimensional versions available. And it looks cool. And it\u2019s kind of has these like life forms, basically, that are kind of evolving in front of your eyes. So it\u2019s very cool to look at. But no one kind of took it to like the next level basically, where it could be like fully interactive, and you could like insert your own algorithms and see how these things evolve in this kind of 3d space and gotten one Scott going. I was like, this is super cool.\n\nMatt Zahab\n\nSo you\u2019re a perfectionist. I can just tell once you once you start you dial in and there\u2019s nothing stopping you.\n\nJoel Dietz\n\nYeah, so there\u2019s probably again this like it\u2019s some kind of weird thing I have this extra I mean, I learned Mandarin when I was young, you know and it took so much time of copying these you know, characters and stuff like that. But you know, after I got through that, I basically felt like I could do that like enough persistence, you know, you just kind of keep on going keep on going and then maybe that CrossFit stuff on top of it also means that you like really put yourself into something once you\u2019re once you\u2019re in the middle of it so yeah, and I mean, I love this kind of stuff too. Like the comp is gaming that got me into programming you know so with that and so when I get the confluence of these two things coming together I just like I light up I get so happy.\n\nMatt Zahab\n\nFolks for those listening and who aren\u2019t watching this Joel has literally been smiling while speaking for this, you know, for the last 36 minutes. So it\u2019s an absolute treat to see someone so fired up about, you know, passionate about something they do. Joel, let\u2019s keep an eye on Metaverse is here. I know you guys are helping a lot of businesses come in and you know, create their own do their own ish within the metaverse which businesses in particular can benefit the most from the metaverse.\n\nJoel Dietz\n\nUm, I think probably I don\u2019t know sir No, no think of like a government you know, as a business but I did read apologies network state. I think it\u2019s definitely in like kind of right direction of kind of evolution. And in general, I\u2019m a fan of his writings. And I think that basically and when we got this actually inbound, I gave a talk at the World Government Summit before about metaverses and I basically said, like, governance needs to be fun. Like, it needs to be engaging, like you need to actually have some something for people to do. And especially if you\u2019re going after, like, civic engagement, how can people engage more, you know, and be like, like Metaverse, like, I think, for people to have actual and control over and help evolve. So I think that\u2019s going to be maybe the biggest thing overall meant might take a little bit longer to go, you know, because, you know, governments aren\u2019t necessarily known for, like, doing things quickly. But, you know, I think people like biology will help with their own kind of micro governments. And I think there\u2019s, you know, a lot of other things, too, real estate is kind of an obvious one, like, and I\u2019m, I\u2019m a huge fan of, in general, take your 2d architectural rendering, and turn it into an interactive experience, you know, if you want to sell something, it\u2019s maybe like, you know, not obligatory today, but it probably will be in five years where everyone will be used to like wanting to go on a virtual tour of the apartment or booking before they do it. And you want to be on the front end of that curve. And interestingly enough, like in my little weird break between like my version of web3 today, and what I did web3, and like 2014 2015, I built some, you know, virtual reality demoing, you know, real estate, demoing apps and stuff like that. So.\n\nMatt Zahab\n\nThat\u2019s, I always think of Airbnb, whenever I think of this magic, how cool it would be to walk through the place you\u2019re about to stay at, or would potentially choose to stay up for booking. And then just like the actual real estate, you\u2019ve talked about, let\u2019s say you want to buy a rental home somewhere or a vacation home, and you can\u2019t fly across the world to go do that. You\u2019re there. Yeah, it\u2019s no different than what sort of COVID is done to, to the job, you know, industry in industry, wrong word, but marketplace where it\u2019s like now, every single job in the world, most of them, you don\u2019t have to be in person. It\u2019s global. It\u2019s pretty decentralized, and the talent pool has gotten infinite, the times bigger and same thing can happen with that. Very interesting point there. What do you think is the right time for most businesses to jump in? Seemed like last year was sort of the just because of the FOMO. There was so much feel like it slowed down a little. Yes, there are still bigger companies like Starbucks Polygon announcement, which is massive. But what do you think is when you think is the right time for these fortune 500 companies to start joining the party and getting on the dance floor?\n\nJoel Dietz\n\nWell, apparently, they you know, all are to some degree, and they\u2019re aware and they have plans and stuff like that. At least that\u2019s what the I think ladies PwC Survey said. But you know, there\u2019s a good reason to do an activation in like a name brand metaverse. I think Sandbox is the first people, you know, when people go to these days or Decentraland. But there\u2019s also a huge reason to go where the users are, which is more than like a Roblox thing. And Gucci. And some other people have done that. And then, you know, there\u2019s a whole another reason. And you mentioned this earlier to go where the visual quality and quality of the experience is going to be the highest. And I think that\u2019s where we plan to kind of differentiate, and then you know, kind of use that obviously to grow our user base and everything else. But I just, I have been kind of out in space, but I do love voxel art and stuff like that. But yeah, I don\u2019t like it all the time. Once you\u2019ve gone through the, you know, triple A gaming experience and cinematic virtual reality experiences, it sometimes feels a little bit underwhelming.\n\nMatt Zahab\n\nYeah, it\u2019s, it\u2019s tough. It\u2019s just, it doesn\u2019t seem I can\u2019t really put a finger on it. It\u2019s so qualitative, you know, but it\u2019s just it\u2019s tough to grasp and conceptualize living in a world with such you know, outdated visuals and art. Whereas just like you said, these triple A gaming studios have it\u2019s real, like I saw gameplay footage for the new FIFA I think this week I saw it, it literally looks like the freedom game. And then there\u2019s, you know, again, nothing against Sandbox or Decentraland or anything like that. They\u2019re all incredible companies but just doesn\u2019t do it for a lot of people. And that\u2019s it for a lot of the people who aren\u2019t in crypto I feel like that\u2019s one of the biggest nags at the moment is that they\u2019re like we can\u2019t be living in some world with watercolor you know with Pixlr but it is what it is to teach the wrong job. Joel, this is an absolutely incredible man you have just literally taught me so much and put a smile on my face this whole time. There\u2019s a segment on the show called the hot take factory and I feel like you could make an absolute living in half being the hot take factory give me some Joel Dietz takes doesn\u2019t have to be crypto related can be health, wealth, happiness, nutrition, you name it. I know you have a bunch of them, let them fly. I want to hear some.\n\nJoel Dietz\n\nOh, well, I think you know Uh, you know, rest in peace to God Save the Queen, all that but I do think the world is ready for, you know, some new kind of like royalty basically like, I think there\u2019s an interesting thing of the European royalty and what they use to serve the role they used to serve. And then you know, someone was like torn apart during communism, a lot of stuff was basically stripped away a lot of the things and then when democracy took over, so to speak, I don\u2019t know, they just kind of, they didn\u2019t actually adjust itself that well, and Eastern Europe. So I\u2019m very actively following the things that are happening in Ukraine, because I think Ukraine is potentially going to be able to establish a new kind of political and social model around some of these things. So and it\u2019s also like a history buff thing, but you get the combination of new political systems military history, like all this stuff, kind of happening there, and a hawk hot pocket, I personally will be in Kyiv. Basically, as, as soon as I can be, I do have some other obligations here. But we have a lot of developers there and a great stuff on the ground. So very excited about that. Um, and I don\u2019t know, I just, the possibilities are always mind blowing to me. And similar what you said before, but like, there\u2019s certainly the delicate, you know, effort of weaving different kinds of technology together. But I love that I\u2019m kind of, you know, a little bit on the architect D kind of side of things. And another just really cool thing, like, I think Stephen Wolfram new work is amazing. I don\u2019t know if you know much about him, but I think he\u2019s maybe the greatest or if not one of the greatest physicists of our time, and including on this kind of multi computation thing. And his more recent book on the fundamentals, kind of theory of physics, I think, is just potentially extremely groundbreaking, I was really blown away by his concept of the ruli ad and how we do some of this modeling. So if you want to get to like the super, you know, I\u2019ll say nerdy, esoteric, complex side event. I mean, read about that, and engage, we\u2019re actually going to bring on a roulette fellow to work between us and the Wolfram Institute on some of these topics. Because, so, so fascinating. And we\u2019re going to open up a whole lot as week somebody who\u2019s like, rethink some of the concepts in physics, that I think we\u2019ve like, overly accepted. Yeah, including potentially simulating them in virtual environments, which is also very exciting.\n\nMatt Zahab\n\nI have heard him before but Joel, that is so far above my paygrade like, I\u2019m, I\u2019m not even in that arena, like I, you know, I got my grade 11 physics after that it was, you know. I\u2019m good.\n\nJoel Dietz\n\nI will say from my side, I basically didn\u2019t study physics formally. It\u2019s kind of like the sad thing in my head, but I have a lot of respect for people who, who did. I love education, and I love children\u2019s education specifically, and how you learn concepts, you know, that and physics, I think, is one of those things that lends itself well to being kind of reimagined in virtual environments, because you can learn the rules of physics, you know, by experiencing them and you know, how cool would that be? I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m just whenever I think.\n\nMatt Zahab\n\nGive me good resource if I want to, if I want a little physics reading, where should I start? Or what YouTube videos or podcasts like literally for beginner like I\u2019m talking high school level physics I need to start right from square one right from minus one kind of thing. What\u2019s a good place to start?\n\nJoel Dietz\n\nI\u2019m putting us back because I know what Stephens like latest things are, but I don\u2019t really know what is the most easy we\u2019re gonna get going but what maybe read his article Stephen Wolfram\u2019s article on games. And because he put that out recently, and it shows, even with kind of relatively simple games, like Tic Tac Toe, how you can model all of the different permutations of that game. And then the implications of kind of modeling that which, you know, is very interesting. Maybe I\u2019ll write something on that myself about how that relates to like, the multiverse or concepts like that, because.\n\nMatt Zahab\n\nI\u2019d love that.\n\nJoel Dietz\n\nI\u2019m, oh, did you watch Arrival by any chance that film Arrival like a sci fi film these like aliens show up. And then basically, humans have to coordinate to like, figure out what their messages are, you know, without blowing up each other. And then actually design the language that the aliens used in that film. So that is actually a very good like, kind of approach point. Because it\u2019s, it\u2019s kind of interesting conceptually as well. Like, include your question like, if aliens are communicating to us, what language would they use? And you know, how would they basically trying to be introducing to us.\n\nMatt Zahab\n\nHe\u2019s thought of that. Wow, crazy. Joel, I want to go back to the New World royalty for a sec. Who would it be and what country could potentially be the new world royalty?\n\nJoel Dietz\n\nUm, I don\u2019t. Exactly. I am a huge fan. No memes. I know it\u2019s a side topic. But I do think that like, we sort of catapulted you know, memes into this, you know, new I don\u2019t know, financial and social identity. And education.\n\nMatt Zahab\n\nIt\u2019s powerful people, people get it right away, it makes them laugh, it hits them hard sticks with you, love them, keep going.\n\nJoel Dietz\n\nAnd just along those lines, I hope was kind of like, you know, some thought experiment in my mind, but I would hope that the new form of you know, royalty, so to speak, would actually be kind of in this meme sphere, you know, where it basically like, is not so serious. Maybe I just don\u2019t want it to be serious, but I don\u2019t know. I like I like memes.\n\nMatt Zahab\n\nYeah, I love that. Joel, incredible episode, man. I\u2019d love to have you on for round two. I need on for round two, because we just scratched the surface here. I can tell that you have so much more to give, and I would love to get that out of you. Thanks. Thank you so much for coming on. Before you go. Can you please let our listeners know where they can find you? And MetaMetaverse, online and on socials.\n\nJoel Dietz\n\nYeah, Metametaverse.io My Twitter is @JDietz. And yeah, Joel Dietz My name is gonna Google me I guess.\n\nMatt Zahab\n\nYou got it, Joel. Thanks again, man. Absolutely incredible episode, you absolutely crushed this. And next time I\u2019m in Dubai, I will hit you up. I would love to go to dinner and actually get to meet you in person. But until then, wishing you the team all the best. And looking forward to the next time.\n\nJoel Dietz\n\nYou should come to our Metaverse arcade. We\u2019ll have it set up by them. I\u2019m actually doing all that stuff right now. While their desk is like all these controllers and stuff.\n\nMatt Zahab\n\nOh wow, amazing. Yeah, thanks again. Joel. Appreciate it.\n\nJoel Dietz\n\nMy pleasure. Take care.\n\nMatt Zahab\n\nFolks. What an incredible episode of Joel Dietz. Founder of MetaMetaverse also did some incredible work on Ethereum Metamask, the first smart contract educational channel and tons of academic work on crypto economics. Joel brought the heat this episode this was absolutely incredible. I loved it. I really hope you guys did too. I\u2019m sure you did. To the team love you guys. Thank you so much for everything. Justas my amazing sound editor. You\u2019re the GOAT love you bro. And for listeners, you guys are the best. Keep on growing your bags on staying healthy, wealthy and happy. Bye for now and keep in touch."

        "content": "Vitalik Buterin has participated in an AMA organized by Warpcast founder Dan Romero.\n\nThe Ethereum co-founder and developer has answered a number of questions that are asked by users on Warpcast, a decentralized social network.\n\nStarting with Dan Romero himself, asking what keeps him motivated, Vitalik replied that the knowledge crypto community poses and applications that are built inspires to go further in building something really valuable.\n\nHe said that the outcome that it produced with development is not automatic, it all needed to be thought of to achieve desirable results.\n\nAnother user asked about the scope of crypto-based prediction markets on which Vitalik reapplied that it\u2019s becoming bigger. He noted Polymarket and said that it is growing lately with their \u201cbusiness development talent and crypto talent.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhen asked by a user what he thinks most of the time, Viatlik replied that for last two weeks he is thinking about ethererum community can productively engage with AI related issues.\n\nMost of the questions came from developers which contained more technical aspects of Ethereum, the crypto ecosystem, and technology that lies in-between.\n\nThe co-founder of Daylight, a web3 transaction data startup, Kyle McCollom asked on the future of embedded wallets questioning if users will have a new address for every new app or one address will be used for all applications.\n\nVitalik said that currently one address is used for many apps while we are reaching towards a phase where users will have a new address for every other application or protocol.\n\n\u201cSometimes it makes sense for different apps to share wallets, but that should not be the default. We also need to keep improving ZK sends so that the privacy gains from splitting activity become actually real,\u201d he explained.\n\nThe co-founder of Sound Protocol, Gigamash asked on views about onchain governance tools, the Ethereum co-founder expressed that there should be non-binding polling tools which does not necessarily contain a coin to participate.\n\nVitalik has not been seen much engaging with users on the internet and sharing his views but he has answered many questions in this AMA, even some personal.\n\nVitalik Buterin AMA \u2013 Warpcast"

        "title": "Ethereum (ETH) and Chainlink (LINK) Holders Should Stay Focused - Opportunity On The Way! - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "The cryptocurrency market recently experienced a significant shakeup due to misinformation surrounding a purported Blackrock ETF approval. This unverified news spread rapidly, causing Bitcoin\u2019s value to surge by over 10% against the U.S. dollar. Such events underscore the volatility and sensitivity of the crypto market to news, both genuine and misleading.\n\nAmidst this backdrop of uncertainty, Ethereum (ETH), Chainlink (LINK) and ScapesMania (MANIA) also present a mixed picture. As speculations run wild in the echo chambers surrounding the two more popular coins, ScapesMania emerges as a preferable option as it approaches a major milestone for its presale.\n\nSummary:\n\nScapesMania (MANIA) establishes itself as a promising new entity in the cryptocurrency realm, gaining traction with its innovative approach and successful initial offerings, indicating potential for future growth amidst the established digital currencies.\n\nEthereum (ETH) faces market apprehension due to a substantial asset liquidation by a \u201cwhale,\u201d leading to uncertainty regarding its immediate stability and value.\n\nChainlink (LINK), despite a recent positive surge, encounters skepticism over its future stability due to aggressive accumulation by large stakeholders, hinting at possible market corrections.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Market Outlook\n\nEthereum (ETH), a dominant force in the cryptocurrency realm, has recently faced turbulence due to unexpected market activities. The abrupt liquidation of a significant amount of Ethereum (ETH) by an unidentified \u201cwhale\u201d has stirred uncertainty and apprehension. This move, involving the liquidation of 13,871 Ethereum (ETH), has raised questions about the stability and future prospects of Ethereum (ETH). Amidst this uncertainty, Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum (ETH) founder, stepped forward to clarify his non-involvement in this move, but the market remains wary\n\nEthereum (ETH) price dynamics are currently under scrutiny. With its value hovering between $1,570 and $1,732, the market sentiment appears cautious. The 10-day moving average at $1,562 suggests a potential downtrend, while the 100-day moving average at $1,713 indicates a more extended period of uncertainty. Ethereum (ETH) support levels at $1,308 and $1,470 might be tested if the market continues its bearish trend. Conversely, resistance levels at $1,794 and $1,955 seem distant in the current climate.\n\nThe crypto market\u2019s volatility is evident, and Ethereum (ETH) seems to be at a crossroads. The recent actions of the Ethereum (ETH) \u201cwhale\u201d have cast a shadow over Ethereum (ETH) short-term prospects. Some analysts are even hinting at a potential decline towards the $1,000 mark. While Ethereum (ETH) has a strong foundation, the current market dynamics suggest a period of consolidation and potential correction. Investors are advised to exercise caution and stay informed about global events and Ethereum (ETH) developmental updates.\n\nHowever, no amount of research can give you the same level of certainty that is presented when you\u2019re dealing with presale projects. Coins like ScapesMania offer potential ROIs that can be calculated and, later on, locked in.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Price Analysis\n\nMarket cap Price 2022 change Price 2021 change Price 2020 change Price 2019 change Ethereum (ETH) $186.72 B\n\n-67.49% 399.75% 469.58% -2.04%\n\nChainlink (LINK) Market Dynamics\n\nWhile Chainlink (LINK) has shown some positive momentum with a 30% surge in the past five weeks, the sustainability of this uptrend remains questionable. Large investors have indeed accumulated Chainlink (LINK) tokens, but such aggressive moves often precede market corrections. The rapid accumulation by these players might be a short-term strategy, raising concerns about Chainlink (LINK) long-term stability.\n\nChainlink (LINK) current trading range, between $6.529 and $9.051, might face downward pressure given the broader market\u2019s uncertainty. The 10-day moving average of $7.340, although above the current price, might not hold if bearish sentiments persist. The 100-day moving average at $6.974 further underscores the potential for price consolidation. Chainlink (LINK) support levels at $2.356 and $4.877 could be pivotal in the coming weeks, while resistance levels at $9.919 and $12.441 might remain unchallenged for a while.\n\nChainlink (LINK) recent advancements and integrations are commendable, but the broader market\u2019s volatility casts doubt on its immediate future. The crypto market\u2019s unpredictability, combined with Chainlink (LINK) rapid ascent, might lead to price corrections. Investors should remain vigilant, keeping a close eye on Chainlink (LINK) developments and market trends, and be prepared for potential fluctuations. Presale projects like ScapesMania, however, present a better alternative since they are unaffected by such shifts.\n\nChainlink (LINK) Price Analysis\n\nMarket cap Price 2022 change Price 2021 change Price 2020 change Price 2019 change Chainlink (LINK) $4.08 B\n\n-71.47% 73.84% 536.07% 458.35%\n\nScapesMania (MANIA) Price Prediction\n\nMany crypto experts pick ScapesMania as the best new project of 2023 and beyond. It manages to separate itself from the competition by offering holders a multitude of revenue streams and high potential ROIs during presale.\n\n>>> Join Presale at a Discount on the Official Site <<<\n\nCompanies and individual crypto traders looking for fast potential gains should definitely look into ScapesMania\u2019s proposition. Once the presale finishes, the price will soar, securing possible returns in the range of 400-500%.

        "content": "In recent crypto news, expert predictions hint at bullish times for Dogecoin (DOGE), Ethereum (ETH), and Everlodge (ELDG). But what developments have made analysts so optimistic about the future of these tokens? This article will review any noteworthy news that may trigger significant price growth for them before the year ends.\n\nJoin the Everlodge presale and win a luxury holiday to the Maldives\n\nDogecoin (DOGE): A Bull Run Coming?\n\nDogecoin (DOGE) continues gaining attention in the crypto world. According to crypto analyst Ali Martinez, Dogecoin exhibits potential for a bullish price performance.\n\nMartinez points out that Dogecoin is currently in the final stages of a multi-year Descending Triangle pattern. The breaking of this pattern might signify the start of a surge, potentially initiating a new bull run for Dogecoin.\n\nWith this bullish analysis, experts forecast that the Dogecoin value will continue rising. They foresee the Dogecoin price could reach $0.098 by December 2023, making it a coin to watch.\n\nEthereum (ETH): Buterin Clears Up Rumors\n\nEthereum (ETH) currently exhibits bullish signs that can significantly impact its price performance. Vitalik Buterin, the project\u2019s founder, recently addressed growing concerns within the crypto community regarding his ETH transfers. To dispel rumors and speculations, Buterin took to social media and clarified the nature of these transactions.\n\nHe emphatically stated that any reports suggesting personal selling of Ethereum on his part were wrong. Instead, he highlighted that these transfers primarily involved charitable donations to various organizations. With a more transparent perspective on these Ethereum crypto transactions, market analysts predict a bullish trajectory.\n\nSome are even anticipating the Ethereum price to hit $2,335.71 within Q4 of 2023. This announcement has sparked optimism among ETH enthusiasts, with many keeping a close eye on Ethereum\u2019s performance in the coming months.\n\nEverlodge (ELDG): An Upcoming Game-Changer\n\nWhile Dogecoin and Ethereum dominate the crypto headlines, Everlodge (ELDG) quietly establishes itself as a game-changer. This rising presale star will offer solutions to long-standing issues in the real estate market.\n\nA major real estate market problem has always been the high capital requirements. Everlodge will change this by digitizing, minting, and then fractionalizing NFTs backed by luxurious hotels and vacation homes. As a result, any investor can become a fractional owner of them for prices as low as $100.\n\nHey, Lodgers! \ud83c\udfe1\n\nDo you know? \ud83e\udd14\n\nWith $ELDG, enjoy the warmth of passive income, monthly surprises, and exclusive club access.\n\nPlus, who can resist sweet discounts?\n\nDive into a token that feels like home. \ud83d\udc99\n\nJoin the presale: https://t.co/kIufYkD05d#Presale pic.twitter.com/9yzt5hZhul \u2014 Everlodge (@EverlodgeHQ) September 26, 2023\n\nNot only that, Everlodge places a strong emphasis on transparency. The platform will use blockchain technology to store all titles, deeds, and ownership details on the metadata of smart contracts. This ensures that property records are transparent and easily accessible, eliminating fraud risks.\n\nWhat makes Everlodge stand out from Dogecoin and Ethereum is its deep-rooted connection to the real estate market, a sector valued at over $280T. Moreover, its lower market cap positions it for rapid price surges. Currently available at just $0.02 in Stage 5 of its presale, analysts predict a 30x rally for ELDG after a Tier-1 CEX lists it following its launch.\n\nFind out more about the Everlodge (ELDG) Presale\n\nWebsite: https://www.everlodge.io/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/everlodge\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "Table of Contents\n\nThe cryptocurrency sector is on high alert as this Friday marks a potential turning point with a court decision capable of initiating the first Bitcoin ETF, a significant stride following Grayscale Investments LLC's legal success against the SEC. This event is pivotal for Bitcoin and is also expected to impact altcoins such as Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), Tonkoin (TON), Avalanche (AVAX), and Chainlink (LINK). In parallel, emerging projects such as ScapesMania await potential trajectory shifts, poised to capitalize on the investment fluctuations the landmark verdict may prompt.\n\nTo find out how these cryptocurrencies will develop by the end of 2023, we will analyze Ethereum (ETH), Soloana (SOL), Tonkoin (TON), Avalanche (AVAX), and Chainlink (LINK). Let's see whether ScapesMania (MANIA) can outgrow them, or if they'll continue to dominate the market..\n\nSummary:\n\nScapesMania (MANIA) is emerging as an innovative force in the crypto market, with unique revenue streams and ties to the gaming industry.\n\nEthereum (ETH) maintains its position as a foundational force in the blockchain field, though it acknowledges the evolving landscape with emerging competitive technologies.\n\nSolana (SOL), though noted for its advanced blockchain structure, remains cautious, acknowledging the capricious nature of technological adoption and market sentiments.\n\nTonkoin (TON) leverages its association with Telegram and navigates through regulatory complexities, marking its presence as a community-centric initiative in the crypto space.\n\nAvalanche (AVAX), while steadfast in its technological offerings for dApps and custom blockchains, is circumspect about the fluctuating alliances and market dynamics.\n\nChainlink (LINK), despite a trajectory that has garnered interest, adopts a reserved outlook, considering the erratic nature of market engagements and integration challenges.\n\nScapesMania: Growth Potential Examination\n\nWhile bigger cryptocurrencies wrestle with volatility, ScapesMania can offer almost guaranteed ROIs with notable percentages! The innovative project is currently in presale which means holders can get paid well for the wait. The presale consists of several rounds and the current one offers a huge discount on purchases, nearing 85%.

Furthermore, the tokenomics of the project is transparent and secure and the addition of the latest $150,000 giveaway may be the final touch needed to convert early enthusiasts into full-blown fanatics.\n\nThose still considering which presale projects to choose, need to know that ScapesMania's vision for the future is highly ambitious. it comes in the form of further listings, improvements, and development of a unique niche concept that has yet to be adopted in crypto circles. Considering all of the above, it's not surprising that the presale numbers are outstanding - it can surely be a boon to many in the long run.\n\nScapesMania is at the point where previous buyers can already assume they've made a great decision and now the time is right for those who haven't tried the project yet. Get in now to reach big potential ROI or maybe even higher.\n\n>>> Join the Presale at an 83% Discount <<<\n\nEthereum (ETH): Pioneering Futures\n\nEthereum (ETH), as one of the first and most influential altcoins, has witnessed its fair share of ups and downs. Its decentralized platform has paved the way for countless dApps and smart contracts, revolutionizing the blockchain space.\n\nWhile specific current prices are not mentioned, Ethereum (ETH) value has always been a topic of discussion, given its pioneering status in the crypto world.\n\nEthereum (ETH) journey is expected to be a mix of challenges and triumphs. With its robust platform and continuous innovations, Ethereum (ETH) is likely to remain a significant player, but it will face stiff competition from newer altcoins.\n\nSolana (SOL): Prospects and Challenges\n\nSolana (SOL) has been making headlines with its advanced blockchain capabilities, positioning itself as a formidable competitor to established networks.\n\nSolana (SOL) value has been reflective of its growing popularity and the increasing adoption of its platform.\n\nSolana (SOL) future looks promising, with continuous technological advancements and strategic partnerships. However, as with any crypto, market volatility and external factors can influence its trajectory.\n\nTonkoin (TON): Community's Trust\n\nTonkoin (TON), with its roots in the renowned messaging app Telegram, has faced regulatory challenges but has emerged stronger. Its Proof-of-Stake consensus and initial mining distribution have made it a noteworthy project in the crypto space.\n\nTonkoin (TON) value has seen a boost, especially with significant investments from platforms like MEXC Ventures.\n\nTonkoin (TON) future is intriguing. With its integration into Telegram and potential listing on major exchanges like Binance, it's poised for substantial growth. However, the crypto market's inherent unpredictability means that nothing is set in stone.\n\nAvalanche (AVAX): Bridging Innovations\n\nAvalanche (AVAX) offers a robust platform for dApps and custom blockchains, challenging the likes of Ethereum with its high throughput.\n\nAvalanche (AVAX) has been gaining traction, especially with its strategic partnerships.\n\nWith more collaborations on the horizon and its technological edge, Avalanche (AVAX) is set to make significant waves in the crypto market. But, as always, market dynamics can influence its path.\n\nChainlink (LINK): The Connector of Realms\n\nChainlink (LINK) recent performance has been nothing short of impressive, with a significant surge in its trading value and aggressive accumulation by large investors.\n\nChainlink (LINK) value, currently at $7.51, has seen a remarkable uptrend, catching the market's attention.\n\nChainlink (LINK) integrations across various blockchain networks and its focus on real-world asset tokenization position it for a bright future. Collaborations with entities like SWIFT further bolster its prospects. However, the crypto market's volatility can always introduce unexpected twists.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs the crypto market stands on the precipice of potentially transformative changes, the landscape for Bitcoin, established altcoins, and emerging tokens like ScapesMania is rife with anticipation. The possible initiation of a Bitcoin ETF signals a new era of legitimacy and market evolution, a development that could ripple across the value and perception of altcoins such as Ethereum (ETH), Soloana (SOL), Tonkoin (TON), Avalanche (AVAX), Chainlink (LINK). Each of these digital currencies, with their unique technological foundations and market positions, faces a future where triumphs and challenges are deeply interwoven.\n\nAmidst these horizons, ScapesMania, with its innovative approach and ties to the lucrative gaming industry, is particularly poised to break through as a novel force in the digital finance realm.

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC), the world\u2019s oldest and most valued cryptocurrency, managed to remain above the $28,000 mark early Thursday despite reds dominating the price charts. Popular altcoins \u2014 including the likes of Ethereum (ETH), Dogecoin (DOGE), Ripple (XRP), Solana (SOL), and Litecoin (LTC) \u2014 landed in the reds across the board.

As per WazirX, SOL price in India stood at Rs 2,036.\n\nTop Crypto Gainers Today (October 19)\n\nAs per CoinMarketCap data, here are the top five crypto gainers over the past 24 hours:\n\nBitcoin SV (BSV)\n\nPrice: $41.63\n\n24-hour gain: 5.89 percent\n\nUNUS SED LEO (LEO)\n\nPrice: $3.79\n\n24-hour gain: 2.90 percent\n\nMina (MINA)\n\nPrice: $0.3776\n\n24-hour gain: 2.55 percent\n\nMantle (MNT)\n\nPrice: $0.3222\n\n24-hour gain: 2.53 percent\n\nInjective (INJ)\n\nPrice: $8.06\n\n24-hour gain: 2.27 percent\n\nTop Crypto Losers Today (October 19)\n\nAs per CoinMarketCap data, here are the top five crypto losers over the past 24 hours:\n\nConflux (CFX)\n\nPrice: $0.1009\n\n24-hour loss: 7.96 percent\n\nOKB (OKB)\n\nPrice: $43.97\n\n24-hour loss: 5.29 percent\n\nChiliz (CHZ)\n\nPrice: $0.05521\n\n24-hour loss: 5.07 percent\n\nToncoin (TON)\n\nPrice: $2.01\n\n24-hour loss: 4.89 percent\n\nGala (GALA)\n\nPrice: $0.01264\n\n24-hour loss: 3.77 percent\n\nWhat Crypto Exchanges Are Saying About Current Market Scenario\n\nMudrex co-founder and CEO Edul Patel told ABP Live, \u201cIn the past 24 hours, Bitcoin has been trading consistently above the $28,200 level following asset manager Fidelity's submission of an amendment to its proposed spot Bitcoin ETF application to the US SEC. This amendment outlines Fidelity's strategies for securing customers' Bitcoin in custody accounts and transparently disclosing associated risks. Notably, ARK Invest and Invesco made similar amendments to their applications last week. These coordinated efforts have given rise to optimism among market participants, who interpret these actions as potential signs of ongoing discussions between the US SEC and the spot ETF applicants. Furthermore, market attention is focused on the Economic Club of New York, where Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is scheduled to speak later today, just before the US central bank's blackout period leading up to its next interest-rate decision.\u201d\n\nShubham Hudda, Senior Manager, CoinSwitch Markets Desk, said, \u201cBitcoin (BTC, -0.9 percent) has been holding the fort above $28,000 even as it has registered gains due to fake news of ETF acceptance followed by a price correction. Even though nearly $100 million was liquidated within hours, investors seem to be noticing the steadiness in BTC price after its correction. However, reports suggest that the actual BTC ETF approval could boost the crypto market potentially bumping up the global crypto M.Cap by $1 trillion.\u201d\n\nRajagopal Menon, Vice President, WazirX, said, \u201cBitcoin is trading at $28,256 after suffering a decline of 0.75 percent in the past 24 hours. The Bitcoin ETF race garners attention for its potential to offer a regulated means to access Bitcoin price movements. Recent false reports of the SEC approving BlackRock's BTC ETF application briefly sent Bitcoin above $30,000 before falling 8 percent upon clarification. Despite regulatory delays, the market speculates on a forthcoming approval as traditional financial institutions embrace crypto.\u201d\n\nSathvik Vishwanath, CEO and co-founder of Unocoin, said, \u201cBitcoin, the reigning cryptocurrency market leader, is at a pivotal moment as it nears the $29,000 mark. Technical analysis reveals a slightly bullish scenario with RSI at 63, suggesting optimism without overbought. The price remains above the 50-day EMA of $27,712, indicating short-term bullish potential. However, the triple top pattern at the $28,634 resistance raises concerns about a bearish trend, which is amplified by the presence of Doji candles. In short, Bitcoin's current path seems positive above $28,150, but a drop below that level could tip the balance. In the near term, Bitcoin is poised to challenge the $28,634 resistance, influenced by various technical indicators and market sentiment.\u201d\n\nShivam Thakral, CEO, BuyUcoin, said, \"The crypto market is showing optimism around the Bitcoin ETF news. The Blockchain analytics firm CryptoQuant predicted that $155 billion will enter the crypto market if Bitcoin ETFs are approved. Bitcoin remained above the $28,000 mark while Ether was hovering above the $1,500 mark at the time of writing. The crypto market is poised for a healthy growth but uncertain macroeconomic factors may restrict its momentum.\"\n\nCoinDCX Research Team told ABP Live, \u201cIn the past 24 hours, BTC's price briefly climbed to Rs 25,40,000 ($29,000) but quickly retraced below $28,500. Currently, it's trading within the range of $28,100 to $28,500. As long as BTC holds above $28,000, it's considered a positive sign for the overall market. On the other hand, ETH has lost its recent gains and is once again hovering near the major support level of $1,530 to $1,550.\u201d\n\nSubscribe And Follow ABP Live On Telegram: t.me/officialabplive\n\nDisclaimer: Crypto products and NFTs are unregulated and can be highly risky.

This is the method we focus on in this article since it is very consumer-friendly.\n\nIf you do not want to sake on an exchange, you can join an Ethereum staking pool (but this is less suitable for beginners).\n\nStep 2: Select an exchange\n\nA number of exchanges offer Ethereum staking. We have listed several well-known and reputable options above.\n\nBefore choosing where to stake, be clear on how much you can earn (the yield or APY), how long you need to stake for, and the cost for doing so.\n\nStep 3: Send Ethereum to your account\n\nIf you don't own Ethereum tokens already, you can buy them at the exchange. If you already have Ethereum in your wallet, they can be transferred to the exchange you choose and staked there.\n\nStep 4: Set up the contract\n\nThe exchange acts as the operator of the staking pool. Rewards earned for staking your Ethereum with them will be managed by the exchange.\n\nWhen configuring the contract, you'll need to decide how long you want the staking contract to last. A general rule of thumb is that the yield is higher the more you put in and the longer you stake for.\n\nBe sure to fully understand the terms and conditions prior to putting your stake. For example, how will withdrawing your tokens before the expiration date affect the yield?\n\nPros and cons"

        "title": "Ethereum: Vitalik Buterin has not sold ETH for profit since 2018 - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "A few days ago Vitalik Buterin, founder of Ethereum, revealed in a post on the decentralized social media site Warpcast that he has not sold ETH for personal profit for five years now.\n\nAt most, the creator of the famous smart contract platform, would use part of his ether assets and part of the shitcoins sent to him by different communities, to support non-profit organizations and do charity work.\n\nHence, he is not selling himself but the counterparts who have to bear some expenses.\n\nIn the world of donations Vitalik had made his mark in 2021, when he sold $1 billion in Shiba Inu (SHIB) to the Indian fund \u201cCrypto Relief,\u201d set up by his colleague Sandeep Nailwal to support the Covid-19 emergency.\n\nVitalik Buterin has not sold ETH for personal profit for 5 years: the Ethereum community confuses donations as terminations\n\nTwo days ago, Vitalik Buterin, a Russian computer programmer and inventor of the Ethereum protocol, posted a very interesting tweet within the decentralized social media site Warpcast, in which he reminded his community that he is not a greedy person for money.\n\nSpecifically, he allegedly said that he has not sold ETH for personal profit since as far back as 2018, and that the only transfers from his address involve donations to charities.\n\nhttps://warpcast.com/vitalik.eth/0xb8ccf84d\n\nUsers often confuse donations with terminations, thinking that an ether transfer necessarily implies selling for stablecoin or FIAT with the intent of making cashouts to the personal account of Ethereum\u2019s \u201cboss.\u201d\n\nThe media exploit events in which transactions are recorded leaving Vitalik\u2019s wallet to gain attention through \u201cclickbait\u201d headlines, spreading misinformation.\n\nWhen the founder of the smart contract platform makes a donation in ETH, he is not selling for profit but simply spending the cryptocurrency, while the recipient often decides to sell to cover operational expenses.\n\nAccording to Vitalik Buterin, and by analyzing the histories of the public addresses in his possession (the connection of which was revealed years ago), there are in fact no traces of recent trading or sales on exchanges that suggest personal gains.\n\nThe news does not cause much of a stir and is not surprising to those who by now know the 29-year-old Russian programmer\u2019s personality, since over the years he has never acted for personal gain but always and only for the good of Ethereum.\n\nSuffice it to say that although he came to be a multi-billionaire when Ether\u2019s prices were near all-time highs, he has never sported fancy clothes or driven supercars and, on the contrary, has always behaved modestly and discreetly.\n\nHis attire of garish T-shirts with unicorns, rainbows, and ufos is typical of classic computer nerds who do not care about the social influence of money.\n\nVitalik\u2019s philanthropic activities and historic $1 billion donation to SHIB\n\nOver the years Vitalik Buterin, in addition to ethically supporting Ethereum\u2019s foundation and its affiliated businesses without making substantial personal profits, has often shown that he cares deeply about charity.\n\nIn June this year, he revealed that he and the founder of layer-2 solution Polygon Sandeep Nailwal donated $100 million to India\u2019s \u201cCrypto Relief\u201d fund, established in 2021 to support the Covid-19 emergency.\n\nThis is yet another handout after the same two developers gave away another $100 million in 2022 with the intent of supporting high social impact activities and projects.\n\nLast year @CryptoRelief_ led by @sandeepnailwal allocated $100m to Covid research projects I wanted to fund\n\n\n\nSandeep and I discussed and jointly concluded these and other projects are high-impact and need follow through grants. Hence we decided to put $100m more to these projects \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) June 8, 2023\n\nDespite the mind-boggling figures, the donations of the last 2 years have nothing to do with the historic approximately $1 billion transaction in SHIB, with which Vitalik decided to fund the same \u201cCrypto Relief\u201d fund as soon as the second wave of the health emergency in India broke out in April 2021.\n\nThe curious thing about this affair, is that the Ethereum founder had not purchased SHIB to fund his philanthropic activities, but had received them for free from the Shiba Inu community as a marketing technique to increase the memecoin\u2018s countervalue (it was thought that Vitalik would never sell them and hence a \u201csupply shortage\u201d condition would be created).\n\nThe Indian fund that received the lucky mountain of money today still has a balance sheet of about $200 million, most of it in USDC.\n\nVitalik, on the other hand, also directly manages another charity, called Kanro, through a $70 million multi-signature wallet, with which he funds a wide variety of projects with the intention of making his mark on the world and alleviating the suffering of the less fortunate.\n\nOn the other hand, as for his personal cryptocurrency wallet (his largest one), whose address was made public by himself in 2018, we know that he currently holds a countervalue of $1.66 million, of which about 35 percent is in ETH while the rest consists of shitcoins that Vitalik has never bought.\n\nIn fact, after the SHIB affair, in which the inventor of Ethereum received 50 percent of the coin\u2019s supply for free, several memecoin projects began sending large quantities of tokens to his address."

        "content": "The mBridge project for cross-border CBDC payments is changing the Consensus protocol to the new Chinese blockchain consensus protocol.\n\nUsing Ethereum\u2019s Solidity smart contract language and the Ethereum Virtual Machine, some are speculating it could switch to Ripple technologies.\n\nThe mBridge project, a platform built by central banks to support real-time, peer-to-peer, cross-border payments, is shifting from the mBridge ledger to a new Chinese blockchain consensus protocol. The platform designed and built by a number of countries will utilize wholesale central bank digital currencies (CBDC) from Thailand, Hong Kong, China, and the UAE. In addition, the Swedish and French central banks are also known observers who might also look to join the alliance based on its success.\n\nAs earlier reported, the Bridge utilizes a number of technologies including Ethereum\u2019s Solidity smart contract language and the Ethereum Virtual Machine. Maintaining some of the core technologies that make up the platform, the Bridge ledger is now moving to a new Chinese blockchain consensus protocol.\n\nDriven by a number of countries, the adoption of mBridge could usher in millions of users to the platform. This would make it a direct rival of SWIFT. SWIFT is a vast messaging network banks and other financial institutions use to quickly, accurately, and securely send and receive information. Primarily controlled by the West, the network has been prone to interference, sometimes used as a financial weapon to lock individuals and even states out of the international financial system. The success of mBridge will change the landscape of the international financial system and could have repercussions in politics.\n\nAs CNF has been reporting a global alliance going by the acronym BRICS has been expanding and growing in popularity. The alliance comprises China, Brazil, Russia, India and South Africa. Earlier this year, the bloc further invited six emerging market group countries Argentina, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. One of the key agendas for the bloc is dethroning the U.S. dollar.\n\nWhen Will They Switch to Ripple and XRP?\n\nAs countries look to blockchain technology to launch CBDCs, it\u2019s been clear that Ripple and its revolutionary XRP Ledger is a top contender to deploy these digital assets. Financial technology firm Ripple Labs has already launched its Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) platform where financial institutions, governments, and central banks can mint their stablecoins and CBDCs. As a result, Over 8 countries are constructing their CBDCs on the XRP Ledger.\n\nFor now, Ripple is facing a legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) which has placed its future under great uncertainty and barred it from inking some major partnerships. However, experts believe the company will record a win. In the near future, it could offer the technology utilized in the mBridge blockchain framework.\n\n."
