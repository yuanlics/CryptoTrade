        "title": "Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin faces lawsuit over Consensys stock value - The Block",
        "content": "Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin is facing a lawsuit from more than two dozen former Consensys employees, accusing him, Consensys and other parties of maneuvering valuable assets out of its Swiss holding company.\n\nThe complaint was filed in New York state court on Thursday. It claims assets \u2014 including its web3 wallet MetaMask, partly developed by some of the plaintiffs \u2014 were transferred out of Consensys AG, leaving them with worthless shares.\n\nLubin allegedly arranged to move the assets to a new U.S.-based company, CSI, in 2020, so it could solicit outside investment, with the help of Consensys General Counsel Matt Corva, enabling Lubin to replace the plaintiffs with Wall Street investors.\n\nLubin also brought in investment bank JPMorgan, who, in exchange for its own blockchain business, Quorum, received 10% of CSI, according to the complaint. Corva, JPMorgan and Umar Farooq, Global Head of Blockchain at JPMorgan, are also listed as defendants.\n\n'He broke his word'\n\nWhen Lubin established Consensys in 2014, many employees accepted lower salaries with the understanding they would receive company equity, according to the suit. Lubin reportedly dedicated 30% of the company to employee stock, with the suing party holding about 9% of that portion.\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nLegal representatives for the former employees argue that while Lubin prospered, those who believed in his early vision and accepted stock over higher pay ended up with empty promises. \u201cHe broke his word,\u201d the lawyers wrote. \u201cIn the process, he violated his legal commitments and duties. While Lubin got rich, plaintiffs got nothing.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlaintiffs in an ongoing shareholder case against the Swiss-based web3 incubator and investor Consensys AG, which operates as Consensys Mesh, have just filed suit against U.S. blockchain software developer Consensys Software Inc. in New York state court,\u201d a Consensys spokesperson told The Block via email.\n\n\u201cAfter two years of getting nowhere with their frivolous claims against Consensys Mesh in a Swiss court, plaintiffs now believe their meritless claims stand a better chance of yielding a pay day if they game U.S. courts and entangle Consensys Software and other unrelated parties in litigation,\u201d the spokesperson added. \u201cWe fully expect that the plaintiffs, who were never employees of Consensys Software, will soon find this gambit is another fruitless attempt to enrich themselves from the success of others.\u201d\n\nCSI has raised at least $726.7 million from investors, according to the suit, with its valuation rising to more than $7 billion following Series D financing."

        "title": "New Ethereum (ETH) ETFs Hit the Market. Are They Worth Buying? - TipRanks.com - TipRanks",
        "content": "This month, several new Ethereum (ETH-USD) futures ETFs hit the market and began trading in the U.S. for the first time. These ETFs all invest in Ethereum futures contracts. Ethereum is the second-largest digital asset in the world, with a market cap of over $190 billion. After enduring a brutal bear market in 2023, Ethereum is up about 32% YTD. I\u2019m bullish on the long-term future of Ethereum, and as we\u2019ll discuss below, Ethereum ETFs can be a useful tool for investors who want to gain exposure to ETH.\n\nWhat is Ethereum?\n\nSo, what is Ethereum anyway? Not only is it the second-largest and most popular cryptocurrency (after Bitcoin (BTC-USD)), but it is the largest proof-of-stake cryptocurrency. Ethereum.org explains that Ethereum is \u201ca network of computers all over the world that follow a set of rules called the Ethereum protocol. The Ethereum network acts as the foundation for communities, applications, organizations and digital assets that anyone can build and use.\u201d\n\nIt is a decentralized blockchain network that people can use to send and receive peer-to-peer payments, send and receive stablecoins and other assets, buy and sell non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and more. Users can even use Ethereum to create their own crypto tokens. Users can also \u201cstake\u201d their holdings to help process transactions and secure the network while earning interest for doing so. Ethereum has nearly 250 million users around the world.\n\nWhat\u2019s the Big Deal About an Ethereum ETF?\n\nThe appeal of an Ethereum futures ETF is clear \u2014 investors can now gain exposure to Ethereum through their brokerage accounts or retirement accounts without having to hold it themselves in a crypto wallet, a step that can be daunting for some investors. Ethereum ETFs also mean that these types of investors don\u2019t have to open up a separate account on a centralized crypto exchange like Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) in order to invest.\n\nBuying and holding Ethereum yourself involves some risks, as an individual can lose some or all of their holdings if they are hacked or if they interact with a malicious smart contract through a phishing link.\n\nFurthermore, many investors lost the money that they had invested in crypto when centralized crypto exchanges like FTX, Celsius, and Voyager Digital imploded, meaning that leaving one\u2019s holdings on an exchange isn\u2019t necessarily a safe haven either. Investing in Ethereum via an ETF is thus an appealing option for investors, as it removes many of these risks.\n\nSpot vs. Futures ETFs\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that these ETFs invest in Ethereum futures contracts. They don\u2019t directly buy and hold Ethereum. There are a number of applications out there for \u201cspot\u201d Ethereum ETFs that would do just that, but these have not yet been approved by the SEC, and it is unclear if they will be. Note that the SEC has approved a number of Bitcoin futures ETFs, but a spot Bitcoin ETF still doesn\u2019t exist at this point in time.\n\nIt\u2019s also important for investors to note that the price of futures contracts can differ from that of the underlying asset itself. So, for investors who are interested in investing in Ethereum in this way, what are the new options out there?\n\nEFUT is VanEck\u2019s entry into this space. VanEck is a well-known traditional asset manager that has already launched several ETFs focusing on publicly-traded companies that are involved in cryptocurrency. EFUT has just under $8 million in assets under management and charges a relatively high expense ratio of 0.66%, but as you\u2019ll see below, high fees are par for the course with this group of ETFs.\n\nEETH is another option from what crypto investors would call a TradFi asset manager. EETH is a bit smaller than EFUT, with just $6.5 million in AUM, and is quite a bit more expensive than EFUT, with an expense ratio of 0.95%.\n\nThe Bitwise Ethereum Strategy ETF has under $1 million in assets under management and charges an expense ratio of 0.85%. Bitwise has experience in the crypto space with several other crypto-related ETFs.\n\nThis is another offering from Bitwise, and it\u2019s an interesting one, as it is a bit different from the names preceding it on this list. BTOP invests in both Ethereum futures contracts and Bitcoin futures contracts at an equal weighting. This makes it an effective choice for investors who want to invest in both Bitcoin and Ethereum in one simple and convenient vehicle. The only downside of BTOP is that, like AETH, it has less than $1 million in AUM and a relatively high expense ratio of 0.85%.\n\nLike BTOP, BTF provides investors with equal-weight exposure to both Bitcoin and Ethereum. Interestingly, BTF predates the other ETFs here, as it was previously a Bitcoin futures ETF but has now changed its strategy to invest in both Bitcoin and Ethereum futures.\n\nBTF is a convenient way to invest in both of the most prominent digital assets without having to pick winners. It\u2019s also larger than many of the other ETFs on this list, with about $26 million in AUM (although, again, this is still relatively small). The main downside of BTF is that on a list of ETFs with high expense ratios, it comes in with the highest of all, with an expense ratio of 1.20%.\n\nThe name is a mouthful, but this ETF from ProShares essentially gives investors exposure to both Bitcoin and Ethereum futures. Unlike BTOP and BTF, BETH is market-weighted, so it invests more in Bitcoin futures than in Ethereum futures. BETH has a relatively steep expense ratio of 0.95%, and it has just $1.2 million in AUM.\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nThese ETFs are all relatively expensive, especially compared to simply buying and holding ETH in one\u2019s own crypto wallet or account. They are also all relatively minuscule ETFs in the grand scheme of things and are susceptible to volatility, as Ethereum can be a volatile asset.\n\nOn the plus side, these ETFs enable investors to gain access to Ethereum in their brokerage and retirement accounts in a convenient and hassle-free way. This makes them a good option for risk-tolerant investors who are bullish on the future of Ethereum and want to invest in it but don\u2019t want to set up and manage a crypto wallet or an account on a crypto exchange.\n\nI am personally bullish on Ethereum and invest in it directly, but these ETFs are a sensible option for investors who are bullish but don\u2019t want to do this. Of the current choices, I like EFUT the best, as it has the most assets under management of the Ethereum-specific ETFs (although it is still very small) and the lowest expense ratio of the group.\n\nDown the road, it\u2019s possible that the Ethereum ETF landscape could change over time if spot Ethereum ETFs are approved by regulators and if bigger asset managers launch their own ETFs with lower fees.\n\nDisclosure"

        "title": "Did Lido fly too close to the sun? Inside the centralization debate - Blockworks",
        "content": "Lido, the largest liquid staking service provider on Ethereum, is approaching 33% market dominance. This state of affairs has raised concerns about centralization and the protocol being a threat to Ethereum\u2019s security.\n\nAt the time of writing, Lido\u2019s staking market share sits at 31.76%. This means that of all the staked ether on Ethereum, almost one-third of it is staked with Lido.\n\nDanny Ryan, an Ethereum Foundation researcher, noted in a 2022 blog post that if a liquid staking derivative (LSD) exceeds the 33% threshold, it has the theoretical capability to manipulate block space, potentially creating an economic monopoly.\n\nThis sentiment is shared by the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s Mike Neuder, who identified in a blog post three possible attack vectors on the network: holders of Lido\u2019s stETH product, node operators who run validators for the network, and Lido\u2019s DAO.\n\nOf the three, Neuder said the DAO presents the greatest risk, writing that the \u201csoft power\u201d held by DAO members would allow them undue influence over the protocol.\n\nIn a series of interviews, Blockworks spoke with those who\u2019ve raised the alarm that Lido\u2019s dominance may be a pernicious force, as well as members of the Lido development team who argue that the threats to Ethereum\u2019s economic security are overstated.\n\nRead more: Lido Finance drops Solana staking after DAO decision\n\nWhy Lido might present cause for concern\n\nLido DAO\u2019s largest token holders include several funds. Paradigm holds 7% of the total supply of LDO, Lido\u2019s governance token, making it the second-biggest whale, according to a dashboard from Arkham Intelligence. FalconX and Dragonfly Capital are also among the top holders of LDO.\n\nIan Unsworth, contributor to the liquid staking firm Stride, said the funds holding Lido (LDO) tokens are unlikely to liquidate their positions or maliciously attack the DAO. Still, investment funds have to return value to clients, and value creation could, someday, theoretically conflict with the principles of Ethereum.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, you should probably assume everyone is a profit maxi,\u201d Unsworth said. \u201cPeople aren\u2019t going to [govern the DAO] because they like the ethos.\u201d\n\nIf profit maximization means passing proposals meant to degrade Ethereum for personal gain, the DAO is not equipped to stop it, according to Nixo, the pseudonymous executive director of EthStaker.\n\nDAO members typically delegate votes to larger holders, meaning proposals can pass without much attention. This could lead to under-the-radar misdeeds, Nixo said.\n\n\u201cIt could be Apple knocking on the door and saying, \u2018Hey, we would really like to push this [proposal] through in some sort of clandestine way,\u2019\u201d Nixo said, adding that nefarious DAO actors could also punish node operators who act against their wishes.\n\nNotably, the damage Lido\u2019s ability to censor transactions or attack Ethereum grows at 50% and 66% of staked validator share, according to Ryan\u2019s blog post. Nixo said hitting 33% dominance would signal to potential bad actors that higher thresholds are possible without excessive community pushback.\n\nEven if Lido\u2019s DAO is composed of model Ethereans, growing dominance from the liquid staking provider threatens one of the network\u2019s chief value propositions \u2014 its censorship resistance.\n\n\u201c[Lido dominance] erodes the credible neutrality of Ethereum, which in turn devalues Ethereum itself,\u201d Kevin Weaver, a backend engineer at Metropolis, said.\n\nLido\u2019s response to centralization concerns\n\nKasper Rasmussen, a Lido Community Contributor, told Blockworks that Lido itself is an intermediary layer that facilitates interaction between Ethereum users and transparent, well-known Node Operators (NOs).\n\n\u201cThis process is underpinned by a network of 37 legitimate and autonomous NOs. These NOs are not only geographically dispersed, but each of them individually holds less than 1.5% of the total staked assets,\u201d Rasmussen said.\n\nBroader community governance will be achieved through the development of dual governance, Rasmussen said. Dual governance means LDO holders are not the only ones with governing power \u2014 Lido staked ether (stETH) holders can apply veto to votes if they choose to.\n\nThis means it\u2019s possible for stETH holders to engage in protocol governance without holding LDO tokens.\n\n\u201cThis ensures the protocol remains transparent, accountable and representative of the entire user base,\u201d Rasmussen said.\n\nThe Lido team is also working to expand the Lido Protocol\u2019s validator set. In September, it onboarded seven new node operators, Rasmussen noted.\n\n\u201cThis diversification serves as a protective measure against any single entity gaining control,\u201d he said.\n\nLido as an \u2018ideal\u2019 villain for Ethereum?\n\nEnshrining liquid staking decentralization in the protocol\u2019s code has generated buzz in Ethereum circles. Enshrinement could theoretically implement protocol updates that would make it impossible for liquid staking to become overly centralized.\n\nLido\u2019s DAO also considered, and ultimately rejected, a proposal that would have self-limited its staking dominance.\n\nWhether the solution to Lido dominance is reached through social pressure or by code updates, Lido says it is taking steps to stay aligned with Ethereum\u2019s ethos. For this reason, Nixo said Lido is an \u201cideal actor to be in the villain position\u201d on Ethereum.\n\nRead more: Ethereum is \u2018much more centralized than folks realize\u2019: Blocknative\u2019s Matt Cutler\n\n\u201cThis is highlighting a problem that the Ethereum protocol has \u2014 it\u2019s not a problem of an evil actor coming in,\u201d Nixo said. \u201cSo in a way this is good that this is happening\u2026the fact that ideas like that are coming to the surface in light of this debate from all sorts of sources is exactly what this social layer is meant to elicit.\u201d\n\nUpdated Oct. 20, 2023 at 11:30 am ET: A previous version of this article attributed information to \u201cthe company\u201d instead of a \u201cLido contributor.\u201d\n\nUpdated Oct. 20, 2023 at 11:12 am ET: Clarified for additional context.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

Once these are ready, the next devnet, and hopefully the last, Devnet #10, might launch.\n\ngm gm, another eth dev call writeup coming at youuu \u2728\n\nyesterday, devs talked about a new deneb release for CL clients, v1.4.0-beta.3, dubbed \"the summoning\" \ud83e\uddd9\n\nthis release includes mainnet kzg configs and a new gossip rule to help prevent blob spam \ud83d\udc21https://t.co/oVYQ65eDDA \u2014 Christine Kim (@christine_dkim) October 20, 2023\n\nIn addition, Ethereum developers have announced a new Deneb release for CL clients, v1.4.0-beta.3, dubbed \"the summoning.\"\n\nThe release of new CL code specifications for the Cancun/Deneb (Dencun) upgrade, dubbed \"the summoning,\" formally tagged as version 1.4.0-beta.3 in the CL GitHub repository, features two main changes.\n\nFirst, mainnet KZG configurations: The formatting work needed to finalize the output from Ethereum's trusted setup ceremony has been completed and is now included in the most recent CL spec release.\n\nSecond is the new gossip rule, which ensures that CL nodes do not transmit more blobs than the maximum amount of blobs per block, which is presently set in the specifications as six blobs per block. This prevents validators from spamming the network with invalid messages that exceed six blobs per block.\n\nPrysm, an Ethereum client, announced the release of its v4.1.0 version earlier this week. Although capabilities such as backward syncing and filesystem-based blob storage are planned for Q4, 2024, this release sets the groundwork for Deneb support.\n\nThis release also includes new features such as decreasing memory with multi-value slices, optimizing block processing with EIP-4881, boosting portable build performance with BLST0.3.11 and providing live previews of multiarch containers."

        "title": "Ethereum network fees hit 2023 lows, on-chain activities rise - crypto.news",
        "content": "Ethereum network fees are currently at their lowest point in 2023.\n\nThe Ethereum (ETH) blockchain witnessed a significant reduction in network fees, with users paying a mere $1.15 per transaction, Santiment data shows. The current decline in Ethereum\u2019s transaction fees carries with it a historical pattern that bodes well for the network\u2019s utility.\n\nAs transaction fees drop, Ethereum becomes a cheaper choice for users to interact with its versatile platform. This development holds the promise of boosting Ethereum\u2019s overall market value.\n\nLately, there has been a notable rise in the level of on-chain transactions within the Ethereum network. The figure, totaling 1,089,893 user active wallets (UAW), marks the second-highest activity level in Ethereum\u2019s history. Blockchain analysts at Santiment noted that such spikes in on-chain activity could be a signal for potential price rebounds.\n\nYou might also like: Ethereum unveils new testnet called \u2018Hole\u0161ky\u2019\n\nThis increased activity suggests growing interest and utility in the Ethereum network, which may positively impact its market capitalization in the coming months.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/santimentfeed/status/1705401195152789888\n\nWhile the wider cryptocurrency landscape sees significant price dips, Ethereum has remained above the $1,500 mark.\n\nIn June, analysts expressed optimism in the world\u2019s second-largest crypto, with some predicting Ethereum\u2019s ascent to a historic high of $3,000. What fuels this bullish sentiment is the remarkable dwindling of ETH reserves on exchanges, plunging to an unprecedented low of 12.6%.\n\nThis scarcity of Ethereum in exchange wallets underscores the platform\u2019s robust demand, offering a compelling narrative amidst turbulent crypto seas. This scarcity of tokens available for sale on centralized exchanges is considered a bullish sign of Ethereum\u2019s future performance.\n\nGrayscale floats Ethereum Futures ETF application\n\nIn a significant move, Grayscale recently filed an application for an Ethereum futures-based exchange-traded fund (ETF). This application follows a previous filing under the Securities Act of 1933, the same regulatory framework governing commodities and spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs.\n\nNotably, Grayscale\u2018s filing for an Ethereum futures ETF marks an important distinction, as the SEC has previously approved Bitcoin futures ETFs under both the Securities Act of 1933 and the Investment Company Act of 1940, which regulates most security-based ETFs. This move by Grayscale reflects the growing institutional interest in Ethereum.\n\nIn the midst of Ethereum\u2019s journey, co-founder Vitalik Buterin\u2019s voice resonates with a clear vision. Buterin places a strong emphasis on two pivotal pillars: privacy and decentralization. These principles, he asserts, are not mere aspirations but core priorities guiding Ethereum\u2019s path forward.\n\nIn a crypto landscape marked by change, Buterin\u2019s commitment to these ideals illuminates Ethereum\u2019s enduring quest for a more private, decentralized, and inclusive digital future\n\nHe expressed concerns about the vulnerability of centralized entities like custodial exchanges, which can be easily corrupted. Buterin advocates for direct transactions on the Ethereum blockchain to empower users and enhance security.\n\nYou might also like: Ethereum goes red as active addresses, deposits spike\n\nEthereum price analysis\n\nAfter facing resistance on July 14, Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) price has been on a downward trend. Today, ETH is trading at $1,593, reflecting a 2.7% price decline in one week. Ethereum\u2019s market capitalization stands above $191 billion, according to CoinGecko.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) of Ether on the weekly timeframe currently stands at 21.8, indicating a potential oversold condition. Ethereum has a critical support level of $1,500.\n\nWhile Ethereum\u2019s recent price decline may worry investors, its fundamental developments and growing institutional interest suggest a promising future.\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "title": "Explore The Possible Earnings That Can Be Obtained From Ethereum and BTCS - CoinCodex",
        "content": "With the current state of the crypto market, it is essential to explore the possible earnings that can be obtained from Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin Spark (BTCS).\n\nEthereum price prediction\n\nWhile there have been many projections of Ethereum's future price movements, the one recently put forth by Standard Chartered has elicited considerable excitement among crypto enthusiasts. According to the global banking giant, Ethereum (ETH) has the potential to surge to $8,000 within the next two years. This bullish outlook is rooted in Ethereum's expanding role in smart contracts, gaming, and the tokenization of traditional assets. Geoff Kendrick, the Head of FX Research at Standard Chartered, further projected a structural valuation ranging from $26,000 to $35,000 by 2040, supported by the growing real-world applications in Ethereum's blockchain. These predictions underscore Ethereum's potential to yield substantial earnings for investors who capitalize on its current price, which is around 68.40% below its all-time (ATH) of $ 4,891.70.\n\nWhat is Bitcoin Spark (BTCS)?\n\nBitcoin Spark is a new blockchain that was inspired by Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s vision. It seeks to address the limitations of previous blockchain platforms and introduce a new era of digital transactions.\n\nThe Bitcoin Spark blockchain ensures quick transaction processing and low transaction costs through its short block time, high individual transaction capabilities per block, and massive number of nodes. The blockchain also has multiple layers, including a smart contract layer with multiple execution systems that attain singular network finality, allowing for a variety of high-level and low-level programming languages. This positions it as a robust platform capable of supporting smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps) catering to diverse use cases.\n\nBitcoin Spark has especially received recognition for its groundbreaking consensus mechanism, the Proof-of-Process (PoP), which is an effective hybrid of Proof-of-Stake (PoS) and Proof-of-Work (PoW) systems. Users are required to stake BTCS tokens and provide processing power to the network in order to confirm blocks and earn rewards. However, the PoP exponentially reduces rewards as additional stake and processing power are added. This nonlinear approach, combined with the network\u2019s massive nodes, ensures a more equitable distribution of rewards and allows for broader participation, promoting true decentralization. Notably, the Bitcoin Spark network will have a native application developed by its team, compatible with a wide range of operating systems, including Windows, Mac OS, iOS, and Android. The application will serve as a wallet and as the network validation application, enabling accessible and seamless participation.\n\nInterestingly, Bitcoin Spark will channel the contributed computing power to institutions and individuals seeking remote computing resources, who then pay for the service in BTCS, the network's native cryptocurrency. Network validators will receive newly minted BTCS and transaction fees from confirmed blocks plus 97% of the revenue generated from what would have otherwise been dormant processing power.\n\nAdditionally, Bitcoin Spark will have advertising spaces on its application and website, with a strong emphasis on community policing to uphold decentralization. Advertisers pay in BTCS, and 50% of the revenue, along with incentives for monitoring the ads, is allocated to network participants.\n\nNotably, Bitcoin Spark is currently in Phase 8 of 10 in its Initial Coin Offering (ICO), with BTCS selling at $3.25 and investors getting a 6% bonus, among other benefits.\n\nBitcoin Spark (BTCS) future\n\nBitcoin Spark is set to officially launch on the market on 30th November, with BTCS at $10. This denotes a 326% increase for investors in Phase 8 and an 800% for those who invested in the first phase. Many analyses, including a recent one by Oscar Ramos, suggest that Bitcoin Spark has a great future ahead. As Bitcoin-inspired crypto, there\u2019s a limited supply of 21 million BTCS coins, which shows potential for long-term value increases. Additionally, Bitcoin Spark has innovative technologies, unique real-world uses, and a community-centered approach, which is bound to attract many users, increasing demand and subsequently its price. Moreover, Bitcoin Spark\u2019s low market cap, coupled with its launch being close to the predicted 2024 bull run, suggests potential for massive price rallies for BTCS.\n\nThe bottom line:\n\nWhile Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin Spark (BTCS) have significant potential to provide massive profits, it\u2019s essential to do your own research before investing.\n\nTo get more information on Bitcoin Spark and its ICO:\n\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article.

        "title": "Long-term Dormant Ethereum ICO Participant Activates $3.2 Million Worth of ETH - Blockchain.News",
        "content": "An Ethereum ICO participant re-emerged after 8.2 years of inactivity, transferring 2,000 ETH ($3.2 million) to four different addresses on October 21, 2023. Acquired at a mere $620 at the Ethereum Genesis, this move not only underscores Ethereum's substantial price appreciation but also hints at potential market dynamics as long-dormant assets re-enter circulation. The transaction could signal various intents, from cashing out to redistributing or reinvesting the holdings, each with its own set of implications for the Ethereum market.\n\nA participant of the initial coin offering (ICO) for Ethereum has emerged from an 8.2-year hiatus, transferring their entire stash of 2,000 ETH, valued at $3.2 million, to four distinct addresses. This event occurred on October 21, 2023, as reported by Lookonchain via Twitter. The transaction showcases not only the price appreciation of Ethereum but also the potential market dynamics induced by long-term dormant cryptocurrency holdings transitioning to active status.\n\nThe participant acquired these 2,000 ETH during Ethereum's genesis phase at an approximate total cost of $620, given the ICO price of approximately $0.31 per ETH. The tweet included a link to the Etherscan page showing the transactions from the address 0x6403d062549690c8e8b63eae41d6c109476e2588. The remarkable price appreciation highlights the enormous potential for early adopters in the cryptocurrency space, with the value of the assets skyrocketing from about $620 to $3.2 million over a span of 8.2 years.\n\nMarket Implications\n\nThe reactivation and transfer of assets from long-dormant cryptocurrency wallets to exchanges can evoke various reactions within the market and the cryptocurrency community. These transactions are often closely monitored and speculated upon, generating discussions and narratives that may impact market sentiment and price dynamics in the short term. Cryptocurrency exchanges may see an influx of ETH, which could potentially affect the asset's price depending on the subsequent actions taken by the ICO participant\n\nLarge transfers from dormant addresses are sometimes perceived by the market as a prelude to selling, which could potentially put downward pressure on the price of the cryptocurrency involved. This concern may escalate especially in cases where a substantial amount of cryptocurrency is moved, potentially affecting market liquidity, more so if the cryptocurrency has a relatively smaller market cap.\n\nBeyond the immediate market reactions, the reactivation of long-dormant wallets carries sentimental or symbolic significance. It highlights the patience and long-term vision of early adopters, reflecting the historical narrative of the cryptocurrency in question. Such events showcase real-world examples of significant asset appreciation over time, underscoring the potential rewards for long-term holders in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.\n\nImage source: Shutterstock"

Over the past week, the coin has made two unsuccessful attempts to breach the $1,600 mark, indicating strong overhead supply pressure. If this resistance endures, the coin price might remain in a consolidation phase above the $1,500 support level.\n\nAlso Read: Elevated US Treasury Yield Is Hurting Ethereum More Than Bitcoin, Here\u2019s Why\n\nadvertisement\n\nEmerging Pattern Hints a Rally to $1745\n\nEthereum Fear and index at 48% reflect a neutral sentiment in the market\n\nA bullish breakout from $1745 could set a direction trend in the ETH price\n\nThe intraday trading volume in Ether is $6.6 Billion, indicating a 34% gain.\n\nSource- Tradingview\n\nIn today\u2019s trading, the Ethereum price posted an intraday gain of 2.68%, exhibiting a bullish morning Star candle pattern that originated from the $1,530 support. Such a pattern at a crucial support level often signals an imminent bullish reversal.\n\nHowever, the candle formation today shows a high wick, suggesting the presence of sellers around the $1,600 level. If this supply pressure persists, the ETH price could continue its consolidation, potentially revisiting the $1,530 level to regain bullish momentum.\n\nAs of now, the second-largest cryptocurrency Ethereum trades at $1,609. For a more confident recovery to be confirmed, it needs to surpass its October 16th high of $1,556. Achieving this could position Ethereum for a quick 5% rally to $1,572 and complete a bullish Double Bottom reversal pattern.\n\nIs ETH Price Ready for Recovery?\n\nIn the broader context, the ETH price has been traveling in a sideways trend oscillating between $1,745 and $1,530 horizontal level. Amid this consolidation, the daily chart shows the forming of what appears to be a double-bottom pattern, a bullish reversal indicator. Should this pattern play out, the Ethereum price has the potential to break out of its current consolidation range, aiming for a breach above the $1,745 mark, thereby heralding a new recovery trend.\n\nSuper Trend: A red film projected in the daily indicates the sellers pose an upper hand\n\nRelative Strength Index: Contrary to sideways action, the daily RSI slope showing an evident rise indicates the increasing bullish momentum at bottom support."

        "title": "Ethereum ICO Participant Wakes Up After 8 Years, Moves $3 Million In ETH - NewsBTC",
        "content": "The Ethereum initial coin offering (ICO), which took place in 2014, represents one of the most significant events in the history of cryptocurrency. As the network had not begun generating tokens autonomously, the ICO event allowed early investors and enthusiasts to accumulate ETH, currently the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap.\n\nLatest on-chain data shows that one of the ICO participants has become active for the first time in more than eight years, transferring their pre-mined stash of Ether tokens to different addresses on Saturday, October 21.\n\n\ud83d\udca4 A dormant pre-mine address containing 2,000 #ETH (3,198,920 USD) has just been activated after 8.2 years!https://t.co/0Mpx77N5fs \u2014 Whale Alert (@whale_alert) October 21, 2023\n\nEthereum ICO Participant Awakens From Dormancy\n\nAccording to blockchain data tracker Lookonchain, the address, which was part of the Ethereum Genesis, initially received 2,000 ETH over eight years ago. At the time, the Ether tokens were purchased for $620 at an ICO price of $0.31 per token. On Saturday, the ETH tokens in question changed wallets for the first time.\n\nAn #Ethereum #ICO participant woke up after 8.2 years of dormancy and transferred all 2,000 $ETH($3.2M currently) to 4 addresses 10 mins ago. He/she received 2,000 $ETH(the cost is ~$620) at Ethereum Genesis, and the ETH ICO price is ~$0.31.https://t.co/zyMsEZIlb3 pic.twitter.com/juvlKCnIsW \u2014 Lookonchain (@lookonchain) October 21, 2023\n\nThe wallet holding the pre-mined stash of ETH had been dormant for exactly 8.2 years (July 2015). Thanks to the exponential growth of Ethereum and the entire crypto market, the value of these holdings has grown to nearly $3.2 million at the current price.\n\nIn the X (formerly Twitter) post, Lookonchain highlighted that the ICO participant transferred the Ethereum tokens to four different addresses. About 500 Ether tokens were sent to each address, with minutes separating the transactions.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether the wallet owner is preparing to sell the tokens, stake on the network, or carry out other transactions. In the event of a sell-off, though, the price of ETH may experience momentary downward pressure.\n\nLarge transfers from early ICO participants are not exactly common occurrences, but there have already been a couple of similar transactions in 2023. Notably, an ICO participant moved $116 million worth of pre-mined ETH to a Kraken exchange address in July.\n\nETH Price Overview\n\nAs of this writing, Ethereum\u2019s price stands at $1,605, reflecting a 0.7% decline in the past day. This comes on the back of a week where the value of ETH showed signs of recovery, registering a 3.8% price increase in the past seven days.\n\nThe past week was dominated mainly by the optimistic performance of Bitcoin and the false news of a spot ETF approval. This positive run of BTC, however, eventually rubbed on the broader cryptocurrency market, including the price of Ethereum.\n\nEthereum price hovers around the $1,600 mark on the daily timeframe | Source: ETHUSDT chart on TradingView\n\nFeatured image from The Economic Times, chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

Also, he warns that security budget of the largest blockchain is on borrowed time.\n\nMeanwhile, one of the largest EVM blockchains, Polygon (MATIC), accomplished a major milestone on its road to the Polygon 2.0 phase.

It has since added cafes, treasure hunting, and vehicles, and will host fashion week events in the future.\n\nUpland says that it has over 3 million total registered players, including about 30,000 daily active users, and it has inked deals with big sports organizations such as FIFA and the NFL Players Association while adding more and more locations in the United States, Latin America, and Europe.\n\nFor Upland, its geographic strategy is ultimately driven by localized interest. Leuth noted its recent partnership with anime-style profile picture (PFP) NFT project, ON1 Force, which helped Upland enter Japanese territory with the addition of Tokyo to the game.\n\nBuilt on the EOS network, Upland has gradually expanded over the years, and continues to do so even as buzz around the concept of the \u201cmetaverse\u201d has subsided over the last year or so. The quieting buzz doesn\u2019t faze Leuth.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, it\u2019s just a word,\u201d he told Decrypt, insisting that the immersive web is very much alive and well. He called it \u201cthe paradigm of how things will happen in the future.\u201d\n\nHe added that \u201cmaybe the speculators have left,\u201d but noted the existence of OMA3\u2014aka the Open Metaverse Alliance of Web3, an organization that Leuth serves as chairperson of\u2014as a signal of continued development in the space. Focused on creating metaverse standards, OMA3 is a consortium of blockchain, NFT, and metaverse companies that includes major players like Animoca Brands, Yuga Labs, and The Sandbox, along with Upland.\n\nEOS has lost prominence over the years. It ranks 23rd on DefiLlama for total value locked (TVL), which stands at $69 million, underlining a consistent downtrend with no signs of stopping. The EOS token is ranked 60th in terms of total market cap among cryptocurrencies via CoinGecko, and is over five years out from its all-time high price.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t bother Lueth, who told Decrypt that when Upland was founded in 2018, EOS was one of the only viable blockchains for such a project.\n\n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t use Ethereum because of their gas fees,\u201d said Leuth. After some analysis, the team decided EOS was the \u201cbest blockchain\u201d for their needs, and he claimed that Upland is now minting 80 NFTs per second thanks to the blockchain\u2019s technical features. The EOS Network Ventures investment suggests that backers are still trying to grow the ecosystem.\n\nThe Series A extension, which included participation from existing investors Animoca Brands and C3 Venture Capital, will also help fund Upland\u2019s upcoming move to make its in-game Spark token tradable on Ethereum, as Sparklet. Leuth said that the decision to expand the token outside of the game\u2019s own ecosystem is pragmatic.\n\n\u201cThis will increase the visibility of Upland on the open market,\u201d he explained.\n\nThe Co-CEO said that Ripple\u2019s favorable court ruling also helped sway Upland to propose the initiative. One big advantage, he also pointed out, is that the team has never sold the token to investors or the team, potentially helping Upland avoid the kind of securities-related scrutiny that other crypto startups have faced from the SEC.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAlthough the crypto ecosystem has created an image of building fast and breaking things, Lueth insists on a more long-term focus for the industry.\n\n\u201cGaming will drive adoption in general,\u201d he concluded, \u201cbut it won\u2019t happen overnight.\u201d\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nIn an exciting turn of events, Ethereum (ETH) is looking to make a substantial comeback, targeting a price range between $1,800 and $1,900. This optimistic outlook comes as Bitcoin (BTC) experiences renewed highs due to false reports of a spot ETF approval, and the altcoin market shows signs of recovery.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEthereum, the leading altcoin, is currently trading at $1,615 per token, but analysts are keeping a close watch on its potential for growth. Noted expert Ali Martinez, a prominent figure in crypto circles, has pointed out a compelling pattern on the three-day chart.\n\nTextbook price action\n\nAccording to Martinez, Ethereum is on the verge of a rebound, poised to break out from an ascending triangle formation. To validate this prediction, a firm close above the 18-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) is crucial. Only with a strong anchoring above this level, possibly marked by a daily candlestick, can ETH carve a path for further growth.\n\nThe price range of $1,800 to $1,900 per ETH is drawing considerable attention. This zone signifies a 50% to 61.8% price correction from the prolonged fall since mid-April, a textbook correction by market standards.\n\nAs Ethereum approaches these critical price levels, the market will gain greater clarity on its future trajectory. Observers anticipate that breaking and consolidating above these key levels will provide the green light for further upward momentum."

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAn Ethereum whale who holds a massive amount of ETH was faced with significant losses after making error moves, according to Lookonchain. The ETH whale was said to have accumulated 4,892 ETH worth $13.84 million at nearly $2,830 in the year 2022.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, the whale decided to sell after months of hodling, thinking to stop more losses. Thus, the whale lost over $5.24 million after depositing 4,274 ETH worth over $6.85 million to Binance some hours ago. Depositing assets on an exchange usually indicates a desire to sell.\n\nA \"Stupid Money\" deposited 4,274 $ETH($6.85M) to #Binance 7 hrs ago to stop more losses, losing ~$5.24M.\n\n\n\nHe/she accumulated 4,892 $ETH($13.84M) at ~$2,830 in 2022.\n\n\n\nDuring stETH/ETH decoupling, he/she panicked and swapped 3,705 $stETH for 3,536 $ETH, with a loss of 169 $ETH. pic.twitter.com/uzsyH74ip5 \u2014 Lookonchain (@lookonchain) October 21, 2023\n\nThe whale's timing to sell coincided with a sharp spike in the ETH price in the last 24 hours, so it turned out to be wrong overall. The whale would have been able to minimize the losses by benefiting from the price increase.\n\nEthereum saw a sharp spike on Oct. 20 from a low of $1,582 to a high of $1,632. ETH sustained the rise and remained in green at press time to trade at $1,606.\n\nThe whale had been bearish on ETH, given the profit-taking earlier in the week after approval of the Bitcoin spot ETF was confirmed to be false. The whale had anticipated the profit-taking to continue and hence was caught unawares by the sudden recovery in price.\n\nBarring the 24-hour price increase, the whale panicked and ended up selling his ETH holding at a lower price than when he bought it, resulting in a loss.\n\nThe aforementioned ETH holder also made other mistakes that resulted in losses. According to Lookonchain, the ETH whale panicked and exchanged 3,705 stETH for 3,536 ETH, resulting in a loss of 169 ETH.\n\nDormant ETH tokens have shifted in the last 24 hours. According to a PeckShield alert, a dormant ETH ICO participant who had been inactive for eight years moved over 2,000 ETH out.\n\nIn progress updates as regards Ethereum ETF, Invesco US and Galaxy have now filed their 19b-4 via CBOE for their spot Ethereum ETF. According to Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart, the final deadline is undetermined, although it is expected to be around the first week of July."

        "content": "By staking Ethereum (ETH), investors have yet another potential income stream to consider in the rapidly expanding cryptocurrency landscape.\n\nAs the leading Proof of Stake crypto, the Ethereum Network has the highest staking market capitalization in the whole space. Accruing for a total of $44.56 billion in ETH locked by validators, by press time.\n\nThe creation of new tokens (block subsidy) and transaction fees reward investors when they stake their tokens to secure the Ethereum blockchain. Similar to what happens with Bitcoin (BTC) mining. Nevertheless, the supply inflation resulting from these rewards can also impact the real reward rate for Ethereum investors.\n\nThis happens because the increased circulating supply also dilutes the ETH holder\u2018s true value. Finbold demonstrated this dilution in a previous report analyzing the price Ethereum would trade at if it hits its all-time high market cap.\n\nEthereum staking reward rate vs. real reward rate\n\nIn this context, Finbold retrieved data from StakingRewards.com to discover how much Ethereum staking investors are being really rewarded after locking up their capital with ETH. By looking at the raw numbers, the network has paid $1.55 billion dollars year-over-year.\n\nNotably, despite having an estimated annual reward rate of 3.47%, the real reward rate (adjusted by Ethereum\u2019s supply inflation) is 3% per year. This means that a staking position of 32 ETH ($51,200) would reward a validator around $1,536 yearly.\n\nStaking Ethereum data. Source: StakingRewards.com\n\nNevertheless, it is also important to say that staking Ethereum gives investors one of the closest real reward rates to the annualized expected reward rate among other staked cryptocurrencies.\n\nAt the time of publication, there were a total of 863,550 validators staking 27.73 million ETH. However, the staked tokens dropped 65.59% in the last 24 hours."

The second-largest cryptocurrency is trading below its $1,600 support/resistance on Thursday and might need to drop further to sweep through fresh liquidity preferably at $1,500 and build the momentum for a rebound.\n\nAddresses On The Ethereum Blockchain Hit 100 Million\n\nEthereum price might be caught up in the crypto winter but the same does not apply to the network, which has continued to experience significant growth over the last few years.\n\nadvertisement\n\nAccording to on-chain insight shared by @finelady_p on X (formerly Twitter) and reposted by blockchain analytics firm IntoTheBlock (ITB), \u201c the number of addresses with a balance has been steadily increasing over the past few years,\u201d affirming the positive outlook for Ethereum, in that, \u201c there is growing interest in Ethereum and that people are holding onto their ETH for the long-term.\u201d\n\nInterest in Ethereum has over the last few weeks continued to rise and this can be attributed to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approving a bunch of Ether futures exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US.\n\n\u201cThe fact that the number of Ethereum addresses with a balance is increasing and that the price has started to rebound in recent weeks are positive signs for the future of Ethereum,\u201d the X user added.\n\nSantiment, another leading on-chain analytics platform, highlighted that Ethereum addresses belonging to whales in the \u201cbillionaire tier (holding at least 1M #ETH)\u201d currently account for 32.3% of the circulating supply and this is the first milestone of this kind since 2016.\n\nNetwork activity involving these high net worth addresses achieved \u201ctransactions valued at more than $1 million on Wednesday, the second highest day in five weeks. According to Santiment, history is unfolding ahead of the anticipated bull run in 2024 and 2025.\n\n\ud83d\udc0b #Ethereum's whale addresses in the #billionaire tier (holding at least 1M $ETH) now hold 32.3% of the available supply for the first time since 2016. Yesterday's transactions valued at $1M+ also had its 2nd highest day in 5 weeks. History is being made. https://t.co/sywdtn14k5 pic.twitter.com/SdbSrChJCf \u2014 Santiment (@santimentfeed) October 17, 2023\n\nETH Bulls Hunt For Support\n\nThe Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator reinforces the bearish outlook in Ethereum price as it slides into the negative region \u2014 below the mean line (0.00).\n\nTraders are bound to seek exposure to short positions in ETH as long as the sell signal holds. In other words, if the blue MACD line holds below the signal line in red.\n\nThe position of Ethereum price below the ascending trendline as shown on the weekly chart puts bulls at a significant disadvantage. Therefore, the downtrend might need to extend to $1,500 support to collect more liquidity as more investors buy lower-priced ETH tokens, thus building the momentum for a substantial recovery above $1,600.\n\nOn the upside, Ethereum could start to flip bullish after stepping above some of the bull market indicators like the 200-week Exponential Moving Average (EMA) (purple) at $1,625 and the 21-week EMA (red) at $1,696. The subsequent movement above the 100-week EMA could propel ETH to $2,000 and possibly trigger the next bullish phase to $3,000.\n\nRelated Articles"

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s price has recently rebounded and is currently testing a key area.\n\nIn case the bullish momentum carries on, the price is likely to head toward the $2,000 resistance zone in the near future.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nBy Edris\n\nThe Daily Chart\n\nOn the daily timeframe, the $1,550 support level has once again held the price, preventing it from dropping lower toward the $1,400 area. The 50-day moving average is currently being tested around $1,600.\n\nIf ETH breaks above, the $1,750 resistance level and the 200-day moving average located near the $1,800 mark are the next likely targets.\n\nThe RSI indicator has also risen above the 50% threshold, pointing to the fact that the momentum is in favor of the buyers once more.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart\n\nLooking at the 4-hour chart, it is evident that the price has been consolidating between the $1,550 and $1,750 levels for the past few months. However, the market has once again rebounded from the $1,550 level recently and is currently testing the $1,600 resistance zone.\n\nA bullish breakout from this area would pave the way for a further rally toward $1,750 in the coming weeks. However, investors should keep an eye on the RSI indicator as it is entering the overbought region again, which could result in a rejection from the $1,600 zone.\n\nOn-Chain Analysis\n\nBy Edris\n\nEthereum\u2019s price has recently shown upward momentum following months of consolidation and gradual decline. This PA has left investors wondering whether a new bullish phase is on the horizon or lower prices are still to be expected.\n\nThis chart depicts the 100-day moving average of the taker buy-sell ratio metric, one of the most valuable futures market sentiment indicators. Takers are orders executed aggressively at market price and are the ones that move the price. Taker buy-sell ratio values below 1 show bearish sentiment, while values above 1 are considered bullish.\n\nAs the chart demonstrates, this metric has risen recently but is still below 1. If this increase in the taker buy-sell ratio continues and the metric climbs above 1, a new price rally could be expected, and the market could finally break above the $2,000 resistance level. However, if the metric fails to break above 1, things are unlikely to change, and the price could drop further in the short term."

For a long time, Ethereum (ETH) has held a revered position, initially beginning as a nonconsensus asset back in 2018 and 2019. Fast forward to today, and Ethereum has garnered consensus, solidifying its position as a leading player in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, the tides of the crypto world are ever-changing, and a new contender is making waves \u2014 Solana (SOL). Prominent crypto analysts now claim that Solana is the \"strongest non-consensus asset\" of the current bear market. Such bold claims are not made lightly, and the recent performance of Solana provides substantial backing to these assertions.\n\nSource: TradingView\n\nExamining the daily chart of Solana reveals an explosive trajectory. After a series of oscillations, SOL has demonstrated a robust upward trend, capturing the attention of investors and enthusiasts alike. Peaks and troughs aside, the general momentum of Solana portrays bullish sentiment.\n\nBut what sets Solana apart in the crowded crypto domain? One key event solidifying its credibility was its resilience during the FTX crash. FTX, a prominent crypto exchange, was one of the major holders of Solana. Despite potential concerns of market manipulation or undue influence, Solana showcased stability and growth even after the FTX crash. This event not only fortified investor confidence but also indicated Solana's intrinsic value and potential for longevity in the crypto arena.\n\nNow, Solana stands in an advantageous position. The so-called shackles of major centralized holders are behind, and the ecosystem of Solana is burgeoning. Developers, start-ups and enterprises are increasingly turning to Solana's blockchain for its speed, security and scalability."

        "content": "NuggetRush\u2019s utilities and growth potential boost meme coin\n\nParity Technologies aims to decentralize Polkadot\n\nCrypto whales selling ETH in 2023.\n\nNuggetRush (NUGX), a project with solid fundamentals and meme coin potential, can be explored. Polkadot\u2019s (DOT) decentralization shift, Ethereum (ETH) whale behavior, and market trends can also offer insights for investors. NuggetRush creators are bullish on NUGX, expecting price increases on launch.\n\nNuggetRush adds utility to meme coins\n\nNuggetRush\u2019s fundamentals and low market capitalization can support growth in the long haul. This could explain why experts are bullish on NUGX.\n\nWhile its memetic appeal has attracted a dedicated following, NuggetRush will be primarily driven by its play-to-earn (P2E) functionality. As a P2E meme coin, NUGX, its native utility and governance token, will serve as the backbone of the gaming ecosystem.\n\nYou might also like: Pepe hype ends, NuggetRush aims to take over meme coin scene in 2023\n\nIn addition to offering opportunities for artisanal miners in underdeveloped areas, NuggetRush is a player-driven non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace that can offer exclusive benefits. To illustrate, RUSHGEM NFTs can be exchanged for real gold, which adds tangible value to digital assets.\n\nThe project\u2019s roadmap can help cement NUGX\u2019s position in the meme coin scene. Notable developments include NuggetRush\u2019s decentralized exchange (DEX) launch, smart contract renouncement, and community ownership transfer.\n\nNuggetRush is currently in the initial round of its presale, where NUGX is available for $0.01. By the end of the presale and on listing, NUGX could rise to $0.02. However, analysts expect even more growth by the end of the year.\n\nPolkadot decentralizing, DOT is down\n\nOn Oct. 12, 2023, Parity Technologies, the developer of Polkadot, announced strategic shifts towards decentralizing the network.\n\nThis move aims to improve the developer experience and foster a strong developer community, leading to organizational changes in the near future.\n\nWhile Polkadot is a significant player in crypto, its native currency, DOT, has been under pressure. Prices fell from $4.02 to $3.68 last week due to market volatility.\n\nYou might also like: Parity Technologies decentralizes teams in Polkadot, refutes layoff rumors\n\nDespite reaching a low not seen since November 2020, the Q3 report for Polkadot reveals unexpected improvements. The first notable point was that there are 663 million DOT staked, a 14.7% quarterly increase.\n\nIn connection with this growth, Santiment data reveals that Polkadot had the second-highest development activity in the last 30 days. As Polkadot bolsters its network capabilities, DOT could surge to $4.86 by the close of 2023.\n\nEthereum whales exit; ETH is stable\n\nAccording to analyst Ali Martinez, crypto whales have been actively selling their ETH holdings in 2023.\n\nSince February, Ethereum whales have sold or reallocated over 5 million ETH, worth approximately $8.5B, with no signs of slowing down.\n\nYou might also like: Atomic Wallet collaborates with blockchain experts to counter security threat\n\nEthereum surged to $1,750 in early October before retracing below $1,600. As of Oct. 17, ETH was trading at $1,590.\n\nInvestors buying the dip are expected to drive Ethereum\u2019s bullish momentum, pushing it above $1,750 by the end of 2023. However, if bears dominate, ETH may fall to $1,525.\n\nDisclosure: This content is provided by a third party. crypto.news does not endorse any product mentioned on this page.

        "title": "Ethereum: Will EIPs finally spark some interest in ETH? - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "Ethereum lagged behind Bitcoin\u2019s recent rally as interest in altcoins surged\n\nRecent Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIP) and active developer discussions have tried to enhance Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem\n\nWhile Bitcoin approached the $30,000-level, many other cryptocurrencies saw a corresponding surge in interest. And yet, Ethereum [ETH], often seen as a digital silver to Bitcoin\u2019s gold, saw relatively subdued growth over this period.\n\nNevertheless, Ethereum\u2019s performance, or lack thereof in terms of price movement, didn\u2019t reflect the ongoing developments within the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nNew proposals\n\nOne noteworthy development is the latest Ethereum Improvement Proposal, commonly known as EIP, which aims to introduce asynchronous deposit and redemption flows. This proposal serves as an extension to the existing ERC-4626 tokenized vault standard. The ERC-4626 standard focuses on creating parameters for yield-bearing vaults, which are smart contract platforms executing strategies, providing rewards to token depositors.\n\nEIP-7540, in particular, focuses on enabling asynchronous deposits and redemption flows, significantly improving processes for protocols dealing with real-world assets (RWAs), cross-chain lending, and liquid staking. In fact, this potential enhancement was highlighted in an interview with Asad Khan, a DeFi expert at Centrifuge.\n\nKhan explained that EIP-7540 allows for more seamless interactions between users who deposit assets and the tokens they receive in return, creating a more user-friendly experience. This is especially relevant in areas such as RWAs, where different real-world assets can be tokenized and managed more efficiently.\n\nDevelopments on the network continue to hike\n\nAdditionally, Ethereum\u2019s developer community has remained highly active, demonstrating its commitment to the network\u2019s evolution. During their 120th meeting on October 19, 2023, Ethereum developers discussed vital updates, including changes to Ethereum\u2019s core consensus layer (CL). This illustrates the continuous efforts to refine Ethereum\u2019s core functionality, ensuring its reliability and performance.\n\nOne specific issue addressed in this meeting pertained to data blob synchronization. Data blob synchronization involves efficiently propagating blocks of information across the Ethereum network. This synchronization is crucial for ensuring all participants have consistent access to the same data. Developers at the meeting scrutinized the impact of data blob synchronization on block latency.\n\nFor context, Block latency in Ethereum refers to the time it takes a new block of transactions to be received and processed by nodes in the network. Lower block latency is desirable as it improves the efficiency and responsiveness of the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s ETH\u2019s market cap in BTC\u2019s terms\n\nAs Ethereum undergoes these developments and enhancements, questions remain about the potential impact on the price of ETH. At press time, it was trading at $1,609. Ethereum\u2019s price can be influenced by both these technical developments and wider market sentiment.\n\nAt the same time, network growth showed signs of decline, suggesting that Ethereum may need to rekindle interest among new users to continue growing in the future."

In an announcement about the development, Binance urged users not to panic as they might notice large transactions from its TRX hot wallet as a result.\n\nEthereum hits new milestone as accumulation jumps\n\nData from IntoTheBlock indicates that a new milestone has been reached for Ethereum in terms of crypto adoption. Ethereum has crossed 100 million addresses with a balance.\n\nEthereum's \"billionaire\" wallets are also picking up steam, holding nearly a third of the supply for the first time in seven years.\n\nFor the first time since July 16, whale addresses with over one million ETH possess 32.3% of the supply, according to Santiment, indicating increased accumulation.\n\nOn Oct. 16, ETH transactions that exceeded $1 million had their second highest day in a month.\n\nAt the time of writing, ETH was up 4.37% in the last 24 hours to $1,615."

        "content": "Cryptocurrencies have been in especially in vogue ever since tech titans such as Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Twitter founder and CEO Jack Dorsey started talking about them on various social media platforms and some even started accepting payment in this form. While Bitcoin has been around for quite some time and it has also been instrumental in familiarising the world with cryptocurrencies and its underlying technology, that is, blockchain, it is only recently that interest in it has peaked again.\n\nFor those of you who are new to this technology, a cryptocurrency is decentralized digital money based on blockchain tech. It can be used to buy goods and services. It can also be invested in like an asset. However, it is considered to be more volatile compared to other assets such as property and gold, simply because there is no underlying asset, nor is there any government backing in most countries. Unlike fiat currency, which is notes and coins that are issued by the central bank of a country, a cryptocurrency is not managed by a central government authority. Cryptocurrency is based on cryptographic proof that is verified and recorded on a blockchain program. Once recorded, the details of a transaction cannot be tampered with. Every transaction is secured with two sets of keys -- a public key and a private key, which make it secure.\n\nNow that you have learned about the basics of cryptocurrency, let's take you through some of the most popular cryptocurrencies on the internet right now.\n\nBitcoin\n\nBitcoin is the first cryptocurrency. Its working principle was outlined by Satoshi Nakamoto in a paper titled \u201cBitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System\u201d back in 2009.\n\nBitcoin.org says that \u201cBitcoin is a consensus network that enables a new payment system and completely digital money. It is the first decentralized peer-to-peer payment network that is powered by its users with no central authority or middlemen. From a user perspective, Bitcoin is pretty much like cash for the Internet.\u201d\n\nBitcoin can be purchased from Bitcoin exchanges and it can be used at a growing number of brick-and-mortar businesses like restaurants, apartments, and law firms. At the time of writing this article, the value of Bitcoin stands at $64,574.39 as per CoinDesk.\n\nEthereum\n\nEthereum is one of the most popular cryptocurrencies on the internet right now. Ethereum.org says that \u201cEthereum is a technology that lets you send cryptocurrency to anyone for a small fee. It also powers applications that everyone can use and no one can takedown.\u201d \u2018ETH' is a cryptocurrency by Ethereum that can be used on the internet for purchasing goods and services.\n\nAt the time of writing this article, the value of ETH stands at $4,167.99 as per Ethereum.org.\n\nDogecoin\n\nDogecoin is a cryptocurrency just like ETH and Bitcoin. It was created by software engineers Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer in late 2013 as a part of a lighthearted joke for cryptocurrency enthusiasts. Its logo features a popular meme at the time that includes a deliberately misspelt word \u2018doge' to describe a Shiba Inu dog.\n\nIts value exploded earlier this year after Elon Musk tweeted about it. According to a Forbes report, Dogecoin is easier to mine compared to Bitcoin as it is easier for miners to complete the mathematical equations that complete and record transactions. Additionally, there is no cap on the creation of Dogecoin, which makes it a better option for processing payments."

They foresee the Dogecoin price could reach $0.098 by December 2023, making it a coin to watch.\n\nEthereum (ETH): Buterin Clears Up Rumors\n\nEthereum (ETH) currently exhibits bullish signs that can significantly impact its price performance. Vitalik Buterin, the project\u2019s founder, recently addressed growing concerns within the crypto community regarding his ETH transfers. To dispel rumors and speculations, Buterin took to social media and clarified the nature of these transactions.\n\nHe emphatically stated that any reports suggesting personal selling of Ethereum on his part were wrong. Instead, he highlighted that these transfers primarily involved charitable donations to various organizations. With a more transparent perspective on these Ethereum crypto transactions, market analysts predict a bullish trajectory.\n\nSome are even anticipating the Ethereum price to hit $2,335.71 within Q4 of 2023. This announcement has sparked optimism among ETH enthusiasts, with many keeping a close eye on Ethereum\u2019s performance in the coming months.\n\nEverlodge (ELDG): An Upcoming Game-Changer\n\nWhile Dogecoin and Ethereum dominate the crypto headlines, Everlodge (ELDG) quietly establishes itself as a game-changer.

The platform will use blockchain technology to store all titles, deeds, and ownership details on the metadata of smart contracts. This ensures that property records are transparent and easily accessible, eliminating fraud risks.\n\nWhat makes Everlodge stand out from Dogecoin and Ethereum is its deep-rooted connection to the real estate market, a sector valued at over $280T.

        "content": "There are many ways through which you can stake Ethereum in the UK, but for most people, staking your Ethereum at an exchange will be the easiest option. Scroll down to get started.\n\nStaking Ethereum is a way to earn passive income. There are other benefits too. Staking reduces volatility in the market \u2014 because coins are locked up \u2014 and helps maintain the integrity of the blockchain for the community in general.\n\nCryptocurrency is not regulated by the UK Financial Conduct Authority and is not subject to protection under the UK Financial Services Compensation Scheme or within the scope of jurisdiction of the UK Financial Ombudsman Service. Investing in cryptocurrency comes with risk and cryptocurrency may gain in value, or lose some or all value. Capital gains tax may be applicable to profits from cryptocurrency sales.\n\nFinty may be compensated when you click on the link.\n\nHow to stake Ethereum\n\nIf you're thinking of taking a stake in Ethereum (ETH) from the UK, this step-by-step tutorial will take you through the process.\n\nStep 1: Select a staking method\n\nThe easiest way to stake Ethereum, especially if you're new to the concept, is to use a crypto exchange. This is the method we focus on in this article since it is very consumer-friendly.\n\nIf you do not want to sake on an exchange, you can join an Ethereum staking pool (but this is less suitable for beginners).\n\nStep 2: Select an exchange\n\nA number of exchanges offer Ethereum staking. We have listed several well-known and reputable options above.\n\nBefore choosing where to stake, be clear on how much you can earn (the yield or APY), how long you need to stake for, and the cost for doing so.\n\nStep 3: Send Ethereum to your account\n\nIf you don't own Ethereum tokens already, you can buy them at the exchange. If you already have Ethereum in your wallet, they can be transferred to the exchange you choose and staked there.\n\nStep 4: Set up the contract\n\nThe exchange acts as the operator of the staking pool. Rewards earned for staking your Ethereum with them will be managed by the exchange.\n\nWhen configuring the contract, you'll need to decide how long you want the staking contract to last. A general rule of thumb is that the yield is higher the more you put in and the longer you stake for.\n\nBe sure to fully understand the terms and conditions prior to putting your stake. For example, how will withdrawing your tokens before the expiration date affect the yield?\n\nPros and cons"

        "content": "Many airdrop hunters expect several Ethereum rollup solutions to release their crypto in 2024 and are preparing in every way to qualify as beneficiaries of the initial distribution phase.\n\nZKsync and Starknet are among the most prominent projects in Ethereum\u2019s layer-2 landscape that will most likely release their own token, accompanying the launch with an airdrop to users of decentralized networks.\n\nData from the respective company valuations contextualized with the growth that the 2 ecosystems have experienced in the market over the past year suggest that in the case of an airdrop, the reward could be really substantial.\n\nThen there are also \u201csecond-tier\u201d projects that are less talked about than the first mentioned, but are still worth considering. These include the names Linea, Scroll and Fuel.\n\nDo you also want to participate in airdrops and earn crypto gifts in 2024?\n\nAll the details in this article.\n\nAirdrop of crypto projects ZkSync, Starknet and LayerZero among the best for 2024\n\nDuring 2023 many rumors suggested that several crypto projects would release their own tokens by the end of the year, considering the growth of a wide range of decentralized ecosystems, especially those of Ethereum\u2019s ZK rollups.\n\nSeveral months later, we find ourselves having to reconsider the timing of these events: unfortunately, the prolonged bear market after the brief crypto rally in early 2023 has prompted the postponement of plans by several companies working in blockchain infrastructure development that had planned to create their own cryptocurrency in the current year.\n\nIn this regard, the Starknet team, namely StarkWare, announced just this month that it has postponed the first unlocking of STARK tokens from November 2023 to April 2024 as an internal roadmap reorganization plan.\n\nMany airdrop hunters expect that Starknet\u2019s future crypto will be distributed via airdrop to all users who have contributed to the growth of the chain and the various dapps that have been built on top of it.\n\nWith a corporate valuation of $8 billion, an infrastructure TVL of $130 million, and a total of 17 million transactions in the past 30 days, it is very likely that in the event of airdrop the rewards to the community will be substantial.\n\nAs for ZkSync Era, one of Ethereum\u2019s most important layer-2s using zero-knowledge cryptographic proof-of-concept technology, an airdrop of a token from the project was also expected to be announced by year-end.\n\nAgain, however, the plan to decentralize the sequencers and provers has taken a long time, having to postpone the eventual release of a coin for the zk ecosystem for next year.\n\nThen there is the fact that right now the cryptocurrency world\u2019s focus is on the issue of Bitcoin\u2019s spot ETF and its likely approval soon. Launching a token in a situation like this could be counterproductive for the issuing company.\n\nSeveral hints, such as a spoiler from the team about the feasibility of a reward to layer-2 users, attracted several airdrop hunters in 2023, with a huge impact on the growth of the chain.\n\nZkSync has a TVL of $432 million, an amount of 28 million transactions in the past 30 days, and a billion-dollar valuation from parent company Matter Labs.\n\nAll of these factors suggest that in 2024, when the airdrop rumour is confirmed, the rollup\u2019s supporters will be rewarded with 3-figure sums.\n\nThe best layer 2 crypto airdrops: strong speculation on Linea, Scroll, and Fuel\n\nAlthough the expectations of Starknet and ZkSync airdrops are very high, we should not forget that there are also other \u201clayer 2\u201d projects that could bring their tokens into the crypto market in 2024.\n\nWe are talking about 3 other Ethereum ZK rollups that have recently attracted public attention given the growth of their ecosystems.\n\nThe most prominent among them is definitely Linea, a second-tier scaling solution that in just 3 months since its launch has totaled a TVL of $72.8 million.\n\nLinea is a product of software development company Consensys, which received substantial funding this year from Animoca Brands and Coinbase Ventures to develop its layer-2.\n\nHaving recently entered the mainnet, it is likely that it will be another few months before a utility token is actually released. Hence, logically speaking, during 2024 we may see the airdrop of Linea, with associated celebrations of the cryptographic network\u2019s first contributors.\n\nAnother noteworthy infrastructure is Scroll, one of the crypto community\u2019s most anticipated Ethereum rollups, which recently landed on the mainnet, opening the dances for airdrop farmers.\n\nAs with other ZK networks, an internal project token is expected to be created and distributed to early adopters in the chain.\n\nScroll has been under development since 2021 and has received several $80 million in private funding, which suggests that the project team will partially use it to remunerate their community.\n\nAt the moment the chain has a very small TVL but could see a very large capital inflow in the short term given the hype that is being generated on social media about a rumored airdrop of the crypto project.\n\nInfinem we cannot fail to mention Fuel, one of the most important modular execution layers currently under development.\n\nThe network team has raised $81 million in funding and the growth prospects project the infrastructure as one of the fastest growing in the Ethereum layer-2 landscape.\n\nIt is currently still in testnet, hence before it is launched in mainnet and before a native ecosystem crypto is eventually created, it is likely to be a few months away.\n\nQ4 2024 is the most likely timeframe for an airdrop of Fuel, for which, however, preparation is needed between now and the next 6 months.\n\nHow to earn crypto from these projects?\n\nEarning crypto from airdrops is not an easy activity and requires a minimum of experience and ability to navigate the web3 industry.\n\nIn any case, it is not a complex practice to perform once you come to understand the key factors and moreover allows you to get decent rewards even if you are not really experienced in the crypto world.\n\nFirst of all, to begin with, you need to be in possession of a non-custodial wallet, such as Metamask and Trustwallet.\n\nIf you have so far only used your cryptocurrencies through exchanges, it is best that before you delve into the world of airdrops, practice all the mechanisms of DeFi and web3.\n\nIn addition to the decentralized wallet, it is imperative to have at least a few hundred dollars in crypto in order to carry out transactions in the infrastructure with which you will be interacting.\n\nIn the case of airdrops to Ethereum\u2019s ZK layer-2s, we can find many commonalities in the strategies used by so-called \u201chunters\u201d to obtain gift tokens by making minimal effort.\n\nIn principle, it is essential to follow these 4 types of transactions to plausibly secure aidrop from ZkSync, Starknet, and other layer-2s:\n\nBridge from Ethereum to rollup : each layer-2 has an interface where you can transfer your funds (ETH) from the Ethereum core network\n\n: each layer-2 has an interface where you can transfer your funds (ETH) from the Ethereum core network Provide liquidity and execute swaps on the reference DEXs of these networks. On the official Ethereum rollup websites you can find all the links to the platforms in the \u201cEcosystem\u201d sections\n\non the reference DEXs of these networks. On the official Ethereum rollup websites you can find all the links to the platforms in the \u201cEcosystem\u201d sections Interactions in general with the networks\u2019 smart contracts ( at least 10 different protocols.\n\n( at least 10 different protocols. Activities on the main Ethereum network: hold a minimum balance of $50 and carry out a few transactions occasionally even with small amounts of money\n\nThe criteria by which the teams of these projects decide to undertake an airdrop may vary and include different requirements, but they will likely consider, at least partially, the 4 points just listed\n\nThe larger your presence on these state-of-the-art rollups, both in terms of volume transacted and in terms of the amount of transactions, the larger the reward you are going to get.\n\nIf you would like to explore this topic further, we have created mini tutorials on which it is explained step by step how to qualify for ZkSync and Starknet airdrops.\n\nFor more updates stay tuned to this weekly column!"
