        "content": "Key Takeaways You can borrow USD fiat or stablecoins by using your ETH as collateral.\n\nCrypto borrowing is a great way to get liquidity without paying capital gains tax.\n\nThere are a variety of lending platforms with various ETH loan rates \u2013 we cover the best.\n\nA useful feature of blockchain finance is getting to borrow against your crypto assets. Specifically, you can use your ETH balance as collateral to borrow USD or any other fiat (or stablecoin) and use those funds as you see fit.\n\nCrypto borrowing is also a great way to capture liquidity from the appreciation of your ETH without having to pay capital gains tax. To take advantage of this, simply use your ETH tokens as collateral to take out a fiat loan and then spend those funds, rather than selling your ETH and incurring capital gains tax.\n\nHow Do Ethereum Loans Work?\n\nEthereum loans work by using your ETH tokens as collateral to borrow fiat like USD, stablecoins, or other cryptocurrencies in exchange. This is in contrast to a traditional loan, where your credit score and other factors determine your loan amount. Ethereum loans, unlike traditional loans, are \u201covercollateralized,\u201d \u2014 meaning they use deposited collateral to determine what the loan amount will be.\n\nAs an example: If you are looking to borrow $10,000 by using your ETH as collateral for a loan, you should be ready to deposit anywhere between $14,000 and $40,000 of ETH in order to receive the loan. Once your collateral is deposited to the lending platform, your loan funds will be released with no further questions or checks. This makes the lending process easy, quick, and available to anyone who can post the required collateral.\n\nOnce you receive an Ethereum loan, you can use the cash for any purpose you would like. This is another departure from the traditional lending model \u2014 you do not have to declare what you will be using your loan funds for, nor do you have to disclose any information regarding your loan activity.\n\nTop 3 Ethereum Loan Platforms For February 2024\n\nCrypto Accepted For Collateral Origination Fees Interest Rates Minimum Provided Loans Maximum Provided Loans Standout Feature Nexo ETH BTC MATIC BNB & more 0% 0% \u2013 13.9% $50 $2,000,000 0% APR loans for Platinum tier NEXO holders Arch Lending ETH BTC AAVE AVAX BCH LINK LTC MATIC SOL UNI WBTC\n\n+ Equity shares from one of 33 approved private companies Liquidation fee of 2% 12% Depends on Location None Arch Lending puts security and trust first, storing your collateral with cold storage providers YouHolder ETH BTC SOL UNI & more 0% 3% \u2013 8% $100 $1,000,000+ Issue loans with up to 90% LTV\n\nNexo Nexo is one of the biggest crypto lenders currently in the space.

Normally if your ETH appreciates significantly in price, you have made money on paper, however, in order to realize this gain, you must actually sell your ETH. This incurs a taxable event, making the appreciation of your ETH tokens subject to a capital gains tax.\n\nETH loans can be used to bypass this taxable event. Here\u2019s how it works: Let\u2019s say you have $50,000 of ETH that doubles during a bull run to now be worth $100,000. If you sell your ETH \u2014 whether for fiat, a stablecoin, or another trade \u2014 you will be liable for capital gains tax on the $50,000 in appreciation. What you can do instead is to use your ETH tokens as collateral for a crypto loan. Since loans are not taxed, you get to realize the full value of the $100,000 without having to give any of it away to taxes.\n\nYou will still be charged the loan fees, which may include administrative fees like loan origination and will definitely include an interest charge, however, these expenses are usually significantly less than what you would pay in taxes.\n\nWhat Do I Need To Get An Ethereum Loan?\n\nEthereum loans are available to anyone who deposits the required collateral. Your loan amount will be decided in large part by the value of your collateral, so this is really the crucial factor in securing an ETH loan.\n\nOnce you have your collateral ready, you will need to pick a lending platform and also familiarize yourself with the loan terminology. Below we cover several of the most crucial lending terms:\n\nLTV\n\nInterest-only, interest & principal, and credit line loans\n\nMargin Calls\n\nWhat Is Loan-To-Value (LTV), And How Does It Affect Loan Rates?\n\nYour loan\u2019s loan-to-value (LTV) is the relationship between the amount you borrow and the value of your deposited collateral. The point of your collateral is to protect the lender in case you cannot make your loan payments and default on your obligation. If the value of your collateral assets gets dangerously close to the amount you borrowed, lenders may automatically liquidate your collateral to cover your loan.\n\nLenders use LTV as a measure of how healthy your loan is and how likely it is that they will have to liquidate your collateral. Loan-to-value itself is measured as a ratio of the loan amount to the value of the collateral. To get your LTV, divide these two numbers together.\n\nFor example, if I borrow $25,000 using $50,000 of ETH as collateral, my LTV is 50% since $25,000 is 50% of $50,000. If on the next day, however, the ETH market crashes and my deposited collateral is only worth $40,000, my loan LTV goes up. 25,000 divided by 40,000 shows that my new loan LTV is 62.5%.\n\nThe higher your loan-to-value climbs \u2014 usually through market volatility that lowers the value of your collateral \u2014 the more likely a lender is to liquidate your collateral. These liquidations normally start when a loan LTV is in the 80% \u2013 90% range.\n\nInterest-Only Loans Vs. Interest & Principal Vs. Credit Line: How Do They Compare?\n\nJust like traditional loans, ETH loans charge an interest amount. This is where the lender makes the bulk of their money. ETH loans differ, however, in their interest rate options. With traditional loans, you are responsible for paying off a flat monthly fee that includes the principal + interest amount, while with crypto loans, you can choose between several options for repayment:\n\nInterest-Only : With interest-only loans, your monthly payments require you to just pay the accrued interest. You don\u2019t have to worry about the principal of the loan until your last payment \u2014 which is when the entirety of your loan principal and any outstanding interest all come due in one lump sum. Interest-only loans are a suitable option if you want to keep your monthly payment low, but you end up paying more in interest in the long run.\n\n: With interest-only loans, your monthly payments require you to just pay the accrued interest.

Interest-only loans are a suitable option if you want to keep your monthly payment low, but you end up paying more in interest in the long run. Interest & Principal : These loans work very similarly to traditional loans. You have a loan principal and interest amount that together get amortized (evenly divided) over the term of your loan into equal monthly payments that pay down both the interest accrued and the principal itself. These loans normally end up more cost-effective than interest-only loans, however, they require larger monthly payments.\n\n: These loans work very similarly to traditional loans.

These loans normally end up more cost-effective than interest-only loans, however, they require larger monthly payments. Credit Line: Some ETH lenders have begun offering credit line solutions to borrowers. These, unlike regular Ethereum loans, give you the equivalent of a \u201ccredit line\u201d with a specified limit that can be used as you see fit, and you only pay interest on the amount that you use.\n\nMargin Calls\n\nBefore you take out an ETH loan, one of the most important pieces of terminology to know is the \u201cmargin call.\u201d\n\nA margin call occurs if your loan\u2019s LTV gets close to the liquidation range (usually 80%-90%). The margin call itself is when a lender requests for a borrower to either pay down some of their loan amount or to add more collateral in order to bring their loan LTV down.\n\nMargin calls are extremely important to understand since they are the only warning step that your loan\u2019s LTV is getting too high before your lender resorts to selling off your collateral assets to pay back your loan. Margin calls normally occur whenever crypto markets are very volatile, and the value of your ETH collateral drops significantly enough to put your LTV within liquidation territory.\n\nETH Loan Calculator\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at an example where we borrow $30,000 and see how an interest-only loan compares to an interest and principal loan.\n\nInterest-Only Interest And Principal Borrowed Sum $30,000 $30,000 Term Of Loan 12 months 12 months LTV 60% 60% Monthly Repayment $250 a month for each of the first 11 months and a final payment of $30,250 on month 12 $2,637 a month for 12 months Total Owed $33,000 $31,650 Total Interest Charged $3,000 $1,650\n\nHow Do Taxes On Ethereum Loans Work?\n\nFunds obtained by taking out a loan are not taxable. This is in contrast to funds obtained when you sell a cryptocurrency for profit which are subject to capital gains tax.\n\nFor traders who have seen their crypto appreciate significantly, taking out a crypto loan can be a tax-efficient way of getting liquidity for your gains. You are liable for the interest payments on these loans, however, these can often come out to be much lower than the capital gains tax you would pay if you were to sell your crypto.\n\nFees For Borrowing Against ETH\n\nIn addition to interest, most lending platforms charge several different fees related to the loan. These are usually:\n\nOrigination Fees : This is a fee that\u2019s charged for the origination of the ETH loan. This fee is tacked on to the loan amount you owe back.\n\n: This is a fee that\u2019s charged for the origination of the ETH loan. This fee is tacked on to the loan amount you owe back. Withdrawal Fees: Platforms normally incentivize you to leave your cryptocurrency stored with them. Some do this by charging a fee, known as a withdrawal fee, for withdrawing your funds from the platform.\n\nAre There Any Risks When Borrowing Against Ethereum?\n\nLike with anything in crypto, borrowing against your ETH can be risky.\n\nCollateral liquidation: Crypto loans are \u201covercollateralized,\u201d meaning that your loan is fully secured by the collateral that you deposit. If the value of your collateral falls below a certain threshold or you fail to make your required debt service payments, the lender has the right to liquidate your collateral.\n\nSecurity Risks: Centralized lending platforms hold your collateral within their wallets, and your funds are as safe as the security measures taken by the platforms. Most of these platforms have world-class security teams, so this is usually not an issue, however, hacks and phishing attacks are commonplace in crypto, so you should always keep in mind that there is no guarantee your crypto can\u2019t be compromised.\n\nPlatform Insolvency: The volatile nature of cryptocurrencies means that billions of dollars can be wiped out off balance sheets in a matter of minutes. Like traditional financial institutions, crypto lenders are exposed to the markets, and they may experience insolvency if the markets are rocky enough. In the past, crypto lenders have gone bankrupt while holding client money that was never returned. Keep in mind that this is a real risk and, while unlikely, is one you take on when you custody your collateral assets with these platforms.\n\nOther Earning Opportunities: Overcollateralized loans, unlike traditional loans, require you to already have more than the full loan amount that you would like to borrow available to you to use as collateral. This means that while you can get loans at great terms, you are locking up a significant sum every time you get a loan, and you cannot put that sum to work elsewhere. Between staking, lending, and liquidity providing, there are a plethora of earning opportunities that may better suit you rather than tying up your capital as collateral.\n\nDeFi Loans\n\nThe platforms we cover above are centralized, meaning that they custody your collateral assets and they issue your loan from a centralized pool of funds controlled by the platform.\n\nETH loans are also available through decentralized finance (DeFi) means. These loans are peer-to-peer, meaning that the funds you borrow are directly put up by someone lending them out on the other side. DeFi platforms simply connect lenders with borrowers, and the rest is done through the blockchain itself.\n\nDeFi loans do not have fixed interest rates \u2014 they vary constantly depending on demand for the borrowed asset. DeFi loans also support a wide range of collateral and borrowing assets meaning that other cryptocurrencies such as BTC, SOL, BNB and others can be borrowed in exchange for your ETH collateral.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nCan I Get A Loan For Ethereum? Yes. You can use your ETH as collateral to take out fiat or stablecoin loans. What Is An ETH Flash Loan? Flash loans are an advanced type of ETH loan that can be theoretically used to take out a loan without posting collateral. This works by taking out a loan and immediately repaying it with the same block on the blockchain. These transactions normally happen within a split second of each other, hence the name \u201cflash loan.\u201d Can You Earn Interest On Ethereum? Yes. ETH interest is most often earned by lending out your Ethereum to those looking to borrow it. Is It Safe To Get An Ethereum Loan? Generally, yes. You are always exposed, however, to the volatility of the crypto markets, which may threaten your collateral, as well as to the platform you are borrowing from and its respective risk of bankruptcy. How Do Taxes Work For ETH Loans? When using ETH as collateral to borrow funds, the borrowed amount is not considered taxable by the IRS. How Can I Get An Ethereum Loan Without Collateral? ETH loans are overcollateralized loans meaning that in order to take out some loan amount, you must deposit collateral that\u2019s greater than the amount you\u2019re looking to borrow. Some lenders, like SALT lending, offer personal and business loans that do not require collateral but do require a credit check.\n\nContributor George Hristov George is a tech writer interested in web3 startups and communities.

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEthereum has been facing its share of hurdles in the recent market trends. An examination of its daily chart indicates a pivotal juncture at which Ethereum currently finds itself.\n\nFirst and foremost, a glance at the chart reveals a potential resistance level that Ethereum seems to struggle with. This is evident from the multiple touchpoints that gravitate toward this price ceiling. Historically, consistent inability to break through such resistance has often led to sharp retraces. For Ethereum, the implications could be more pronounced, given the other market dynamics currently in play.\n\nOne concerning trend is Ethereum's low network activity. Despite being a hub for countless decentralized apps, the recent lull in on-chain operations signals waning interest or, perhaps, a temporary shift of focus toward newer blockchain platforms. A thriving network is not just about transactions \u2014 it is also about development, upgrades and new projects. Low network activity might hint at a pause in these endeavors.\n\nMoreover, while Ethereum wrestles with its price, competitors like Solana are making substantial gains. With a 34% price increase since its local low, Solana is outpacing Ethereum in the race. This divergence is noteworthy. Ethereum's hegemony in the decentralized space is being tested, and these performance metrics might force investors to reconsider their portfolios.\n\nSolana takes stage\n\nThe cryptocurrency market is no stranger to spectacular price movements, and Solana (SOL) has recently been at the center of attention. Experiencing an astounding 34% price surge, SOL is definitely not staying on the sidelines. But with such rapid appreciation, investors and traders are inevitably asking: When might this bullish rally slow down or reverse?\n\nSolana's recent price action can be attributed to a variety of factors. Labeled as going through its \"second youth,\" the digital asset is enjoying tremendous growth in network activity. This vitality and resurgence can be seen as a testament to the resilience and potential of the Solana blockchain.\n\nOne key element backing this sentiment is Solana's survival through the FTX crisis. Such events can be a death knell for many other cryptos, but not Solana. Its ability to bounce back and even thrive post-crisis underscores its robustness, making it a formidable player in the crypto arena.\n\nA glance at the Solana price chart indicates a powerful uptrend, characterized by higher highs and higher lows. The recent bullish candles reflect the strong buying interest and momentum. However, as with all significant price surges, there is always the possibility of a pullback or correction.\n\nThe chart showcases a potential resistance point, where traders might take profits, leading to a temporary slowdown in the price ascent. Moreover, while the relative strength index (RSI) is not in the overbought territory yet, continued upward movement could push it into that zone, indicating that a potential price correction might be on the horizon.\n\nCardano remains neutral\n\nRecently, Cardano (ADA) has shown promising signs, primarily by its ability to maintain its position above a crucial technical marker \u2014 the 50 exponential moving average (EMA). This development cannot be understated, as it often signifies a crucial pivot in sentiment and price direction.\n\nThe 50 EMA serves as a dynamic support or resistance level, depending on where the price stands in relation to it. In Cardano's case, remaining above the 50 EMA can be interpreted as a bullish sign, indicating that recent price averages are higher than the longer-term averages.\n\nTraders and analysts often regard this positioning as an affirmation of an asset's resilience and potential for upward momentum. In layman's terms, it is a line in the sand, one that ADA is currently on the favorable side of.\n\nAn observable aspect in the current ADA price chart is the downtrend's gradual flattening. After periods of pronounced decline, this leveling out can often precede a trend reversal. Essentially, it can be seen as the market taking a breather, consolidating and potentially gearing up for the next move."

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nEthereum is up by 20% from October 11\n\nBreakout has been seen from a descending channel but today\u2019s high is still a lower one\n\nMore upside potential stands but ETH needs to go above $2,000\n\nThe overall cryptocurrency market has witnessed a significant surge, with its capitalization soaring by 30% from its September 11 low, touching a new yearly high of $1.26 trillion. This slight edge over its previous peak in April underscores the market\u2019s bullish momentum.\n\nBitcoin, leading the charge, has set a fresh yearly record, outpacing its previous best by 11%. Altcoins, too, have been on a tear, with some, like MINA, registering eye-popping gains of up to 120%.\n\nIn contrast, Ethereum\u2018s performance, while commendable, hasn\u2019t quite matched the fervor seen in other coins. Since October 11, it has appreciated by 21%, a respectable figure but somewhat muted compared to the broader market\u2019s exuberance. Currently trading around $1,800, it remains 15% shy of its yearly peak of $2,100.\n\nETH Price Analysis\n\nEthereum\u2019s trajectory since its June 18 low last year has been relatively more optimistic than many of its peers. It embarked on a recovery journey, marking a higher low in November and subsequently achieving a higher peak in April compared to its August high.\n\nPost its $2,100 zenith, Ethereum managed to maintain its value above the $1,500 threshold, charting its course within a descending channel. This resilience stands in stark contrast to several altcoins that plummeted to new bearish lows post-April.\n\nThis descending trajectory Ethereum found itself in likely represented a corrective phase, characterized by a five-wave pattern. However, the tide seems to be turning. Starting from October 11, Ethereum has been exhibiting bullish signals, culminating in a breakout from this channel.\n\nThe rise of Ethereum from November 21 to mid-April presents an analytical conundrum. The movement, characterized by a five-wave impulse, is somewhat ambiguous in its interpretation due to the higher low on November 21.\n\nThis could mean that the surge is merely an extension of the previous ascending structure, rendering it a corrective phase rather than a new bullish cycle.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s an alternative, more optimistic perspective. If we consider this rise as a smaller segment within a broader framework, it could be interpreted as just the initial sub-wave of a more extensive five-wave impulse.\n\nUnder this assumption, the descending channel that followed would represent the second wave of this larger cycle. If this interpretation holds, Ethereum could be poised for a significant upward trajectory. Wave 3, in this context, could propel the price to around $3,310. And if the momentum sustains, wave 5 could push the price even further, breaking previous boundaries.\n\nGiven the undeniable corrective nature of the descending channel, the odds currently favor a continuation of the upward trend for Ethereum. But does this imply an imminent new yearly high?\n\nThe current high, just a touch above $2,000, remains shy of the July 14 peak. By the tenets of technical analysis, this positions Ethereum in a downtrend since mid-April.\n\nHowever, a breach above the $2,000 mark, resulting in a higher high, would disrupt this bearish narrative. Such a move would not only signify a reversal of the downtrend but also set the stage for a potential new yearly high. Conversely, if the current surge falters and pivots into a decline, Ethereum might be subjected to further losses before it can embark on a genuine bull run.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nPlease note that the contents of this article are not financial or investing advice.

        "title": "An in-depth look at the Ethereum market in 2023 - crypto.news",
        "content": "Dive deep into Ethereum\u2019s 2023 market journey, focusing on its NFT dynamics, pivotal metrics, and the emerging world of spot ETFs.\n\nIn 2022, the crypto world witnessed an unexpected downturn, with Ethereum (ETH) facing a sharp 68% decline in value.\n\nAlthough 2023 brought a glimmer of hope, with ETH clawing back nearly 35% of its losses amidst a market-wide resurgence, its price of $1,620 as of Oct. 20 still pales in comparison to its once lofty highs.\n\nEthereum has also grappled with a series of challenges recently, dampening its once meteoric rise. A testament to its struggles is the drastic dip in ETH\u2019s total value locked (TVL) \u2014 plummeting from a whopping $108 billion in November 2021 to a mere $20 billion by October, marking an almost 82% drop.\n\nLet\u2019s delve into the dynamics surrounding Ethereum and try to understand the current market sentiments, key metrics, and insights into what lies ahead for this crypto.\n\nDeclining NFT market\n\nIn Jan. 2023, Ethereum\u2019s NFT space witnessed significant headwinds. The bustling activity that saw more than 28,000 NFTs being minted daily on Ethereum at the beginning of the year took a sharp downturn.\n\nETH NFT mints | Source: The Block\n\nAs of Oct. 20, that enthusiasm has waned, with daily mintings dropping below 3,500. This significant 88% decline can be attributed to increased competition from other blockchain networks, a possible oversupply, and the general volatility of the crypto market.\n\nTrading hasn\u2019t been spared either. Platforms like OpenSea, once brimming with sales, observed a slowdown, particularly after the first quarter, hitting their lowest ebb by Sep. Moreover, from Q1 to Q2 2023, Ethereum\u2019s NFT trading volume shrank by 39.6%, according to CoinGecko.\n\nParallel to the ebb in NFT momentum, 2023 also marked the entry of Ethscriptions. Launched in June, this platform aimed to transform the NFT space by allowing users to inscribe \u201cnon-financial data\u201d on Ethereum\u2019s network.\n\nHowever, its journey was riddled with hurdles. A major setback occurred when a prominent collection named Ethereum Punks had to be withdrawn from Ethscriptions\u2019 official platform.\n\nAt the request of Yuga Labs, the owner of CryptoPunks, I am taking down the Ethereum Punks website, removing all Ethereum Punks images from https://t.co/ZcR9HKlexS, and deleting my Tweets that reference Ethereum Punks, including my Tweet introducing the Ethscriptions Protocol. \u2014 Middlemarch (@dumbnamenumbers) July 11, 2023\n\nThis action was taken upon a request from Yuga Labs, the entity behind CryptoPunks. The ripple effect of this removal was evident as it led to the deletion of numerous tweets by the creator of Ethscriptions, Middlemarch, including the pivotal one introducing the Ethscriptions Protocol.\n\nThese challenges faced by Ethereum\u2019s NFT and Ethscriptions hint at broader concerns within the Ethereum ecosystem, shedding light on competitive, regulatory, and inherent protocol-based challenges.\n\nWhat do the metrics suggest?\n\nSeveral critical metrics can gauge Ethereum\u2019s health and vibrancy. Let\u2019s delve into these to unravel their story about Ethereum in 2023.\n\nETH daily transactions\n\nThese represent the number of transactions processed on the Ethereum blockchain within a day. In May 2023, this number averaged around 1.14 million, but by Oct. 20, it had diminished to 980,000, marking a 14% decline.\n\nEthereum daily transactions | Source: The Block\n\nWhy does this matter? A high transaction count typically indicates robust network usage and utility, making it a bellwether of network health.\n\nYou might also like: Vitalik Buterin discusses Ethereum\u2019s future and innovative projects in AMA\n\nThe reduction hints at a reduced activity level, possibly due to competition from other blockchains or waning enthusiasm from users and developers.\n\nDaily active addresses\n\nThis metric denotes the number of unique addresses that actively send or receive Ethereum on a given day. In April 2023, the daily active addresses averaged 471,000, but this number dwindled to 369,000 by Oct. 20, showcasing a 21.7% drop.\n\nEthereum active addresses | Source: The Block\n\nIts significance lies in its ability to act as a pulse check for user engagement and network popularity. A declining trend in active addresses might imply that fewer users or entities are interacting with the Ethereum network, possibly signaling a shift of interest or a consolidation phase.\n\nDaily onchain volume\n\nRepresenting the total value (in USD) of all transactions on the Ethereum blockchain in a day, the daily onchain volume has witnessed a steady decline. From a substantial $3.92 billion in March, it shrank to $1.41 billion by Oct. 20, reflecting a 64% reduction.\n\nEthereum daily on-chain volume | Source: The Block\n\nThis metric is crucial because it sheds light on the monetary value of assets moving within the network. A decline might suggest that fewer high-value transactions are taking place or that the value of assets on Ethereum has decreased.\n\nETH transaction fee\n\nTransaction fees are payments made by users to compensate for the computational energy required to process and validate transactions on the Ethereum network. These fees had reached a staggering annual peak of $21.89 in May but have since nosedived to a mere $1.99 by Oct. 20, indicating a 90.9% decline.\n\nEthereum transaction fee | Source: The Block\n\nWhile high fees can be discouraging for users, leading to decreased network usage, the sharp decline might indicate improved network efficiency or reduced demand.\n\nNonetheless, it\u2019s a double-edged sword. While it\u2019s more cost-effective for users, it might be less profitable for miners, possibly leading to decreased network security in the long run.\n\nEthereum\u2019s layer 2 evolution in 2023\n\nIn 2023, Ethereum\u2019s layer 2 solutions (L2s) saw increased activity. As Ethereum faced various challenges, L2s emerged as an alternative solution, particularly in addressing scalability.\n\nThe TVL of Ethereum\u2019s L2 platforms reached $10.62 billion as of Oct. 2023. Of these platforms, Arbitrum One recorded a market share of 54.76%. This TVL growth suggests a heightened activity within the L2 platforms.\n\nMeanwhile, centralized exchanges have begun to integrate L2 solutions. Coinbase\u2018s introduction of layer 2 Base indicates a growing interaction between centralized platforms and L2s.\n\nYou might also like: Coinbase launches Ethereum L2 network, Base\n\nIn terms of transaction activity, L2s recorded a higher transaction count than Ethereum\u2019s mainnet during the year. This shift might be attributed to factors such as scalability issues and transaction costs on Ethereum\u2019s mainnet.\n\nOn the financial front, Ethereum\u2019s network revenue experienced a decline, decreasing by 33.3% from $1.27 billion in Q2 2022 to $847 million in Q2 2023. The value of ETH burned also saw a reduction of 35% over the same period. These changes align with the fluctuations observed in the broader crypto market.\n\nEthereum\u2019s position in the decentralized finance sector, however, continues to be notable. The platform constitutes a considerable portion of DeFi\u2019s TVL and is used for multiple on-chain stablecoins.\n\nIn summary, 2023 observed varied dynamics in Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem, with L2 solutions gaining traction amid the platform\u2019s overarching challenges.\n\nEthereum and the influence of spot ETFs\n\nMeanwhile, ETFs have taken center stage recently, with their potential to impact the price and adoption of cryptocurrencies significantly.\n\nGalaxy Digital Fund and Invesco have recently joined forces to delve into the Ethereum spot ETF market in the U.S. This makes them the fifth major player to do so, following in the footsteps of renowned entities like VanEck, ARK Invest, Hashdex, and Grayscale.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s crucial to note that the road ahead for Ethereum spot ETFs is not without hurdles. In many ways, these spot ETFs\u2019 fate is tied to that of Bitcoin spot ETFs.\n\nBefore Ethereum can enjoy the green light for its spot ETFs, Bitcoin spot ETFs are awaiting clearance from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Essentially, Ethereum\u2019s move is pegged to Bitcoin\u2019s lead in this dance of financial products.\n\nTheir introduction could play a pivotal role in influencing Ethereum\u2019s price, adoption, and mainstream acceptance in the financial market.\n\nEthereum price prediction\n\nStandard Chartered\u2019s Geoff Kendrick is optimistic about Ethereum, predicting it could surge past $8,000 and possibly reach between $26,000 and $35,000 by 2025-2026. He cites Ethereum\u2019s growing use cases and the support from layer 2 blockchains as drivers for this growth.\n\nContrarily, analyst FieryTrading expects Ethereum to dip to around $900.\n\nWith such varied forecasts, traders should tread cautiously. It\u2019s vital to remember: never invest more than you can afford to lose.\n\nThe road ahead\n\nAs we approach the end of 2023, Ethereum\u2019s journey has been a roller coaster of highs and lows. From a peak TVL of $108 billion in 2021 to a significant dip to $20 billion this year, it reflects the volatility and uncertainty surrounding the crypto realm.\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum\u2019s once-booming NFT market has also faced headwinds, with daily mintings witnessing a sharp decline.\n\nLayer 2 solutions, like Arbitrum, have provided a silver lining, offering scalable alternatives and showing promise for Ethereum\u2019s scalability concerns.\n\nEthereum\u2019s next significant catalyst might lie in the realm of spot ETFs. With major players like Galaxy Digital Fund and Invesco entering the fray, the potential for Ethereum spot ETFs to drive price, adoption, and mainstream acceptance is palpable.\n\nYet, amidst optimistic forecasts of Ethereum reaching dizzying heights, caution is crucial. The crypto market remains unpredictable, and prudent decision-making remains the order of the day.\n\nYou might also like: Fake news on Bitcoin ETF approval: How rumors can sway the crypto market\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "content": "Ethereum price started a decent increase after Bitcoin rallied 15% against the US dollar. ETH is rising, but it might struggle to clear the $1,850 resistance.\n\nEthereum started a steady increase above the $1,750 resistance.\n\nThe price is trading above $1,780 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere is a key bullish trend line forming with support near $1,750 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair could struggle to clear the $1,850 and $1,880 resistance levels.\n\nEthereum Price Jumps 10%\n\nEthereum remained in a positive zone above the $1,650 support zone. The recent pump in Bitcoin above the $34,000 resistance sparked more upsides in ETH. There was a steady increase above the $1,720 and $1,750 resistance levels.\n\nThe price even cleared the key $1,800 resistance zone. A high is formed near $1,849 and the price is now consolidating gains. It is trading well above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $1,660 swing low to the $1,849 high.\n\nEthereum is now trading above $1,780 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is also a key bullish trend line forming with support near $1,750 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The trend line is near the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $1,660 swing low to the $1,849 high.\n\nOn the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $1,850 level. The first major resistance is near the $1,880 zone. A close above the $1,880 resistance could send the price further higher. The next key resistance is $1,920, above which the price could accelerate higher.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nIn the stated case, Ether could start a strong increase toward the $2,000 resistance. Any more gains might open the doors for a move toward $2,200.\n\nDownside Correction in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $1,850 resistance, it could start a downside correction. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,800 level.\n\nThe next key support is $1,750 and the trend line zone. A downside break below the $1,750 support might send the price further lower. In the stated case, the price could drop toward the $1,700 level.

        "title": "Why Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin Rallied Today - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "The prices of several major cryptocurrencies jumped on Tuesday amid increased speculation over the imminent approval of the first spot Bitcoin (BTC 7.61%) exchange-traded fund (ETF) by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). As of the regular markets' close on Tuesday, Bitcoin was up more than 9%, Ethereum (ETH 4.67%) had gained nearly 7%, and Dogecoin (DOGE 25.97%) had risen 5.5%.\n\nFresh signs of the first spot Bitcoin ETF approvals\n\nLate Monday, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas pointed out on social media platform X that BlackRock's (BLK 1.14%) iShares Bitcoin Trust had been listed on the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) website (the organization that clears all Nasdaq trades) with the planned ticker symbol IBTC. The news subsequently garnered so much attention that the DTCC website briefly crashed due to overwhelming traffic.\n\nIndeed, Tuesday's optimism followed a significant rally in cryptocurrency prices last week, which was spurred by the SEC's reported decision not to appeal a federal court's August reversal of its order preventing crypto asset manager Grayscale from converting its widely popular Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC 5.86%) into an ETF.\n\nSure enough, late Monday the D.C. Circuit of Appeals formalized Grayscale's court win over the SEC, indicating no appeal was filed and putting the onus back on the SEC to move forward with its approval process. The court described the SEC's order preventing Grayscale from converting its bitcoin trust into an ETF -- while simultaneously allowing bitcoin futures funds to launch -- \"arbitrary and capricious.\"\n\n\"This is pretty much checking every box that you need to check before you launch an ETF,\" Balchunas added, noting the timing of the ticker's appearance on the site was \"surprising\" considering any formal approval of a spot bitcoin ETF by the SEC was widely expected to happen sometime over the next several weeks.\n\nWhy the first Bitcoin ETFs are likely still several weeks away\n\nYou shouldn't hold your breath waiting for an imminent approval of the first spot Bitcoin ETFs. Eagle-eyed investors noticed early Tuesday that BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust was no longer present on the DTCC's list this morning -- a change Balchunas speculated may have happened after BlackRock was \"told to or want[ed] to wait until they are days, not weeks or months away\" from the SEC's formal approval.\n\nIt's hard to blame BlackRock, of course, for ensuring all the pieces are in place to move forward as soon as that approval hits the wires. For perspective, the SEC's final deadline to respond to BlackRock's application is March 15, 2024. According to a research report released last week by JPMorgan, however, the first approvals of spot Bitcoin ETFs will most likely arrive before January 10, 2024 -- the final deadline by which the SEC is required to respond to ARK Invest's open application for its \"21Shares\" bitcoin ETF. At that time -- rather than responding to individual applications separately over the course of several months -- the SEC will most likely approve multiple applications at once to level the playing field and prevent any single bitcoin ETF from gaining a so-called \"first-mover\" advantage.\n\nSo why is this a big deal for cryptocurrencies in general? Exchange-traded funds are a much more investor-friendly medium compared to creating separate investment accounts through cryptocurrency trading firms, enabling people to buy and sell shares throughout each trading day through any brokerage firm. Any approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF would significantly broaden investors' access to cryptocurrencies as a widely accepted asset class and source of portfolio diversification.\n\nAs a result, tens of billions of dollars of incremental liquidity would almost certainly flow into cryptocurrencies in short order, likely driving prices even higher in the near term. According to a report from data analytics firm CryptoQuant last week, the overall cryptocurrency market capitalization could ultimately increase by a total of more than $1 trillion after Bitcoin ETFs are approved and become mainstream.\n\nIn any case, it now seems a matter of if, not when we see the SEC finally give its stamp of approval to the first Bitcoin ETFs. Cryptocurrency investors are rightly enthused by the news."

        "content": "A popular crypto trader is predicting that Solana (SOL) and another altcoin will be top performers in the next bull cycle for one key reason.\n\nPseudonymous analyst Bluntz tells his 224,800 followers on the social media platform X that the recent rallies by SOL and Chainlink (LINK) indicate the two alts will outperform other cryptos based on history.\n\n\u201cSo it seems of all the \u2018majors,\u2019 SOL and LINK are the two standout outperformers right now that I can see.\n\nIn my experience, the first runners usually continue to outperform all through the bull market.\n\nNaturally, people feel they missed the boat and want to chase other coins instead in hopes they are lagging. I\u2019ve also done this myself from time to time, but it\u2019s worth remembering that there usually isn\u2019t \u2018the next LINK\u2019 or \u2018the next SOL.\u2019\n\nThe next LINK and SOL are going to keep being LINK and SOL IMO (in my opinion).\u201d\n\nThe trader also weighs in on Ethereum (ETH) against Bitcoin (BTC) and predicts ETH/BTC may be at the start of an uptrend based on several indicators, including an engulfing candle.\n\nTraders watch for a bullish engulfing candle since it may suggest an asset\u2019s downtrend is about to undergo a reversal.\n\n\u201cNot only did ETH manage to close the weekly as an engulfing [candle], but also a confirmed weekly bull divergence.\n\nCouple that with the first test of the weekly 200 MA (moving average) on ETH/BTC and I think it\u2019s setting up for quite a nice move up. A very welcome change after months of chop which feels like it might finally have come to an end.\u201d\n\nA bullish ETH/BTC chart suggests that Ethereum will likely outperform Bitcoin.\n\nETH/BTC is trading for 0.0511 BTC ($1,753) at time of writing.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction as Shanghai Upgrade Goes Live \u2013 Will ETH Dump After Withdrawals?\n\nSource: TradingView\n\nThe price of Ethereum (ETH) has risen by 6% in the past 24 hours, with the successful rollout of the Shanghai upgrade pushing the altcoin to $1,984.\n\nThis level represents an 18% gain for ETH in the last 30 days and a 65% gain since the beginning of the year, although some commentators suspect that the opening of staking withdrawals could result in an increase in selling pressure for the altcoin.\n\nHowever, daily limits on withdrawals will prevent any injection of additional ETH into the market from being too large and from happening at once, meaning that price drops could be minimal.\n\nAnd with the successful introduction of withdrawals likely making ETH staking seem more attractive to retail and institutional investors alike, Shanghai\u2019s completion could end up being very bullish for Ethereum.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction as Shanghai Upgrade Goes Live \u2013 Will ETH Dump by Withdrawals?\n\nThat ETH has risen in response to Shanghai (rather than fallen) is a very good sign, and the coin\u2019s chart reflects such positivity.\n\nSource: TradingView\n\nMost notably, ETH\u2019s relative strength index (purple) has shot above 70 in the past few hours, indicating strong, ongoing momentum.\n\nAt the same time, its 30-day moving average continues to rise above its 200-day average (blue), suggesting that ETH is having a breakout rally at the moment.\n\nA key resistance level in this context is undoubtedly $2,000, which could signal further consolidated gains if ETH manages to break it in a convincing manner.\n\nGiven that Ethereum\u2019s Shanghai upgrade has successfully gone live, this is now a real possibility, with the update\u2019s successful completion feeding bullishness among investors.\n\n#Ethereum #shanghai hard fork\u2026 northing went wrong (yet \ud83d\ude05)\u2026 so much for getting up at 6AM for coffee \ud83d\ude00\n\n\n\n\ud83e\udd73 pic.twitter.com/urSVLeF0zo \u2014 P\u00e9ter Szil\u00e1gyi (karalabe.eth) (@peter_szilagyi) April 12, 2023\n\nDespite the relative smoothness with which this update has been rolled out, some people are suggesting that Shanghai may now trigger an ETH selloff, given that it effectively unlocks around 16.3 million ETH (worth some $30.5 billion).\n\nIndeed, some $1.6 billion in Ethereum is now pending withdrawal, which is arguably a significant quantity in light of how Shanghai hasn\u2019t even been live for 24 hours yet.\n\n\ud83d\udca5$1.64B in #Ethereum is pending Withdraw after the Shanghai Update! \u2014 Crypto Rover (@rovercrc) April 13, 2023\n\nNonetheless, it\u2019s worth remembering that $1.6 billion represents only 5% of the amount staked and only 1.3% of the total circulating Ethereum.\n\nOn top of this, the ETH awaiting withdrawal will not be offloaded onto the market at once, with Ethereum\u2019s developers setting limits on how many validators can process full withdrawals per day.\n\nThis limit is currently set at 1,575 full withdrawals per day, given that the total active validator count, at approx. 512,000, is between 458,752 and 524,288.\n\nAs such, unstaked ETH will come onto the market gradually, without doing much to upset prices.\n\nAnd so far, the fact that ETH\u2019s price has risen by 6% today suggests that Shanghai is more of a net gain than a net loss for Ethereum.\n\nIn fact, the boost to ETH\u2019s price could be very substantial, with some analysts estimating that Shanghai could lead to a scenario where around 60% of Ethereum\u2019s total supply ends up being staked.\n\nThis would take millions of ETH out of circulation, substantially reducing its supply while also boosting demand for the altcoin.\n\nAnd with last year\u2019s EIP 1559 also resulting in the burning of fees, this supply squeeze could see a notable increase in ETH\u2019s price over the next few months.\n\n\u2705$ETH became deflationary\n\n\u2705L2 adoption is growing\n\n\u2705Staking withdrawals are now enabled\n\n\n\n$ETH fundamentals have never been stronger. \u2014 The DeFi Investor \ud83d\udd0e (@TheDeFinvestor) April 13, 2023\n\nSeeing as how ETH is on the brink of passing $2,000, it could quite comfortably rise to $3,000 by the middle of the year, while even climbing to $4,000 by the start of 2024.\n\nAnd if next year does bring a new bull market (made likelier by the next Bitcoin halving), then ETH would be very much fancied to break its current record high of $4,878.\n\nBuy Ethereum Now\n\nEthereum Alternatives to Consider\n\nWhile a bull market for ETH may not materialize for several months, the gradual release of formerly staked ETH could potentially undermine any gains.\n\nHowever, investors should take note that ETH isn\u2019t the only coin in the market with potential right now.\n\nA variety of newer altcoins are also offering above-average gains in the near and distant future.\n\nThe Cryptonews Industry Talk team has studied such coins and compiled a list of the top 15 cryptocurrencies for 2023, each with good short-term and long-term prospects.\n\nThis list is regularly updated with new altcoins and ICO projects.\n\nDisclaimer: The Industry Talk section features insights by crypto industry players and is not a part of the editorial content of Cryptonews.com."

        "title": "The Price of the Crypto Rally: Ethereum Gas Fees Spike Alongside PEPE and Memecoins - CCN.com",
        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nEthereum-based memecoins including PEPE have been among the biggest gainers of the recent crypto market rally.\n\nThe price of Pepe coin has climbed over 37% in 24 hours.\n\nIn tandem with the flood of memecoin transactions, Ethereum gas fees have also spiked.\n\nWith Bitcoin currently trading at its highest price since the spring of 2022, it has lifted the entire crypto market. Among the top-gainers of the past 24 hours, several ERC-20 memecoins stand out for their Bitcoin-beating performance.\n\nAs the price of prominent meme tokens has increased, trading activity has exploded. But with an increase in the volume of transactions, Ethereum gas fees spiked to as high as 80 gwei on Tuesday, October 24, and have remained above average since.\n\nMeme Token Transaction Counts Surge\n\nIn the last 24 hours, ERC-20 the number of memecoin transactions has surged in tandem with significant price gains for some of the most popular tokens.\n\nLeading the charge, the volume of Pepe transactions increased by 220% over the course of a day, thanks to more than 14,000 individual transfers. During the same period, the token\u2019s price increased by over 37%, helped along by news that the PEPE administrators had burned 6.9 trillion PEPE coins worth around $6M.\n\n6.9T $PEPE Tokens worth ~$6,000,000 have been burned. https://t.co/aN5LRUFz8u A new team of advisors have been brought on to guide Pepe forward.

Moreover, a notable overlap between previous periods of high fees and past memecoin frenzies points to a positive correlation between fee gas prices and memecoin trading activity.\n\nPeaking just after 11 pm (UTC) on Monday, October 23, median gas fees briefly hit 80 gwei and have averaged 34.9 gwei during the past 24 hours.\n\nIn contrast, just 3 weeks ago, on October 8, the average Ethereum transaction fees dropped to 8.8 gwei, their lowest price since October 2022.\n\nHow Memecoins Affect Ethereum Gas Fees\n\nWith the exception of Dogecoin, the most popular memecoins today utilize the ERC-20 token standard, and therefore incur Ethereum gas fees each time they are transferred from one address to another.\n\n\ud83d\ude80 Meme coins pump, #Ethereum gas fees spike 400% $PEPE , $BITCOIN, and $SPX meme coins surge as much as 40% in the past 24 hours, driving #Ethereum gas fees to a high of over 45 #gwei . pic.twitter.com/4XgrrhoA4Z \u2014 Satoshi Talks (@Satoshi_Talks) October 24, 2023\n\nBut gas fees aren\u2019t fixed at a set rate. Instead, their price fluctuates dynamically according to the level of network activity. When the number of transactions being processed by the Ethereum mainnet increases, so do gas fees. Conversely, when network activity declines, gas prices get cheaper.\n\nConsidering that memecoins make up some of the most actively traded ERC-20 tokens, it follows that a spike in meme coin transactions could bump gas fees for the entire Ethereum network."

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) has so far relatively underperformed in comparison to the flagship cryptocurrency Bitcoin. However, that could change soon enough as a crypto analyst has predicted the second-largest crypto token by market to gain some momentum soon enough.\n\nEthereum To Hit $1900\n\nIn a post shared on his X (formerly Twitter) platform, prominent crypto analyst Ali Martinez mentioned that Ethereum could rise to as high as $1,900. His prediction was based on data that he had pulled up from the chart which he shared in his post.\n\nThe chart (a 3-day timeframe) featured an ascending triangle pattern, which usually represents a bullish formation. According to Ali, Ethereum is \u201cpoised\u201d to rebound off the hypotenuse of the ascending triangle. Most importantly, for Ethereum to go as high as $1,900, the analyst noted that It has to experience a \u201cfirm close\u201d above the 18-day SMA (Simple Moving Average).\n\nETH getting ready to breakout | Source: X\n\nIf that happens, Ethereum could hit $1,800 and further rise to $1,900 based on Ali\u2019s predictions. It is worth mentioning that the last time Ethereum hit $1,900 was back in July 2023. A rise to that price again will represent about an %18 increase from its current price of $1,600.\n\nAli also had something to say about the flagship cryptocurrency, Bitcoin. In a subsequent post, he noted that the crypto token could see a correction to $28,800; a prediction he made based on the TD Sequential from a 4-hour chart.\n\nBitcoin rose to as high as $30,000 on October 20, with many speculating that a Spot Bitcoin ETF approval could be on the way, something that represents a bullish momentum for Bitcoin and the crypto market in general.\n\nETH price holding $1,600 | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Dominance Is On The Rise\n\nData from TradingView shows that Bitcoin\u2019s dominance has been on the rise this year, with the token currently boasting over 52% coin dominance in the crypto market. Interestingly, it has steadily risen since the Ethereum Merge occurred.\n\nThis is significant considering that many speculated that \u2018the Flippening\u2019 could happen after the Merge, where Ethereum overtakes Bitcoin to become the most dominant crypto token. However, that hasn\u2019t happened so far, with Ethereum\u2019s move from proof-of-work to proof-of-work being seen as \u2018disastrous\u2019 for the crypto token.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum, however, share the podium when it comes to the best-performing assets of the year. Both crypto tokens are said to have outperformed the NASDAQ, S&P500, and Gold. Bitcoin has seen an %80 increase year-to-date (YTD), while Ethereum has seen a %35 increase YTD.\n\nFeatured image from Analytics Insight, chart from Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "Ethereum Will Soon Have 100 Million Addresses With Non-Zero Balance \u2013 What This Milestone Means for ETH Price - Cryptonews",
        "content": "Ethereum Will Soon Have 100 Million Addresses With Non-Zero Balance \u2013 What This Milestone Means for ETH Price\n\nThe number of Ethereum addresses holding a non-zero balance hit a new record high on Monday of 92.5 million. 2022\u2019s bear market, which culminated in the collapse of one of the world\u2019s former largest cryptocurrency exchanges in November, does not appear to have impacted growth in the number of non-zero balance addresses.\n\nSome analysts view the number of Ethereum addresses holding a non-zero balance as a proxy for the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization\u2019s broader \u201cadoption\u201d. Viewed through that lense, the continued, seemingly unstoppable rise of the number of non-zero balance Ethereum addresses can be interpreted as a long-term bullish sign for the ETH cryptocurrency.\n\n100 Million Non-zero Address Wallets in Q2?\n\nOver the last three years, Ethereum has added about 20 million addresses holding a non-zero balance per year. Back of the fag box calculation thus implies that, with only around 7.5 million to go, the 100 million address mark will probably be hit sometime in Q2 2023.\n\nThis will undoubtedly be big news. Cryptocurrency markets are notoriously fickle when it comes to responding to market narratives. Traders shouldn\u2019t be too surprised to see ETH get a boost in the run-up/immediate aftermath of the 100 million non-zero address mark getting hit amid all the hype and positive press the accomplishment will likely attract.\n\nOther Metrics Also Signal Continued Strong Network Growth\n\nGrowth in the number of non-zero balance Ethereum is viewed by some as an overly crude metric \u2013 each new non-zero address doesn\u2019t necessarily mean a new Ethereum user. Luckily for the Ethereum bulls, there are a long list of other metrics that also point to strong continued network growth.\n\nA recently released report from blockchain software development company Alchemy, the number of smart contracts deployed on the Ethereum mainnet grew a staggering near 300% in 2022. That means that smart contract deployment growth roughly matched its rate of increase seen in 2021, despite 2022\u2019s bear market. There were 4.6 million smart contracts deployed on the Ethereum blockchain at the end of Q4 2022, the report noted.\n\n\u201cThe Web3 developer community is proving to be extremely resilient,\u201d commented Jason Shah, Alchemy\u2019s head of growth. \u201cThis report shows that they\u2019re as focused and motivated as ever to build the future of this ecosystem\u2014while honestly acknowledging the unnecessary setbacks we have seen in 2022,\u201d he added.\n\nOver the last 3 months, we analyzed 10M+ data points across chains, dapps and code repos.\n\n\n\nAs with every quarter, we\u2019ve summarized everything you need to know about the state of web3 development! \ud83d\udcc8\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s our Q4 2022 report:\n\n\n\n\ud83e\uddf5\ud83d\udc47 pic.twitter.com/URq2SjN7X7 \u2014 Alchemy | Powering Web3\u26a1\ufe0f (@AlchemyPlatform) January 17, 2023\n\nElsewhere, the number of Ethereum network validators recently surpassed 500,000. It surpassed 400,000 only as recently as last July. A network validator is a computer that runs software that verifies and validates transactions on the blockchain. A higher number of validators is seen as a sign of network strength, as it implies it would be more difficult for a malicious group of validators to gain control of the network and corrupt the blockchain.\n\nThe number of validators on the #Ethereum network has crossed the 500,000 user mark. A prerequisite for this is the presence of 32 $ETH on the balance sheet. pic.twitter.com/wM3oJrPFJT \u2014 Sjuul | AltCryptoGems (@AltCryptoGems) January 17, 2023\n\nEthereum Deflation Another Narrative to Gain Ground in 2023\n\nThe bear market in cryptocurrency markets that began just over a year ago means that Ethereum\u2019s price decline (ETH is down about 67.5% from its record highs printed in November 2021) has been the dominant story in recent quarters.\n\nBut a key change was made in September 2022 to the Ethereum protocol that is likely to give the cryptocurrency a major long-term boost. Last September, Ethereum transitioned from using a proof-of-work consensus mechanism to using the much less energy-intensive proof-of-stake consensus mechanism.\n\nNot only does that reduce concerns about the cryptocurrency\u2019s environmental impact, which might help it attract institutional capital flows in the coming years where Ethereum\u2019s much more energy-intensive rival Bitcoin might struggle, but Ethereum\u2019s inflation rate has also dropped sharply.\n\nIndeed, as of Sunday the 15th of January, Ethereum\u2019s annual issuance rate was around 0.55%, while its burn rate was just under 1.2%. As a result, Ethereum is currently experiencing deflation at a rate of around 0.65% per year. Back when Ethereum was still a proof-of-work blockchain, its inflation rate was 4-5%.\n\nSome analysts have posited that the deflationary impact of the Merge may have been what helped prevent ETH from falling back under $1,000 and hitting fresh annual lows in the immediate aftermath of the FTX collapse. For contrast, Bitcoin did hit fresh annual lows in wake of the FTX debacle.\n\nEthereum will soon undergo its next major upgrade. The \u201cShanghai\u201d hard-fork is expected in March and will allow staked ETH to be withdrawn for the first time, a change which is touted to be a big positive for the protocol as it will likely encourage more investors to stake their ETH."

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) is poised for a significant breakthrough as it inches closer to the critical psychological barrier of $2,000, mirroring the bullish sentiment sweeping through the cryptocurrency market, largely led by Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nMarket analysts are optimistic about Ethereum\u2019s potential breakout before October ends, with buy orders anticipated to fuel a substantial 12.25% surge, propelling the price to $1,958.\n\nIn addition, investors have steadfastly held onto their investments in DeFi assets within the Ethereum ecosystem, demonstrating unwavering confidence even in the face of the enduring crypto market challenges.\n\nDespite the tumultuous nature of the crypto market, these investors remain committed to the potential and promise of DeFi, believing in its ability to revolutionize traditional financial systems.\n\nAs per insights provided by DefiLlama, these assets collectively represent an impressive total value locked at $21.27 billion, reflecting the substantial trust and financial commitment placed in the Ethereum DeFi landscape by the investor community. This data solidifies its position as a cornerstone of the broader crypto financial landscape.\n\nEthereum TVL. Source: DeFiLlama\n\nAs traders eagerly await this upswing, trading volume is projected to witness a notable spike, reflecting growing investor interest in securing exposure to Ether beyond the current resistance levels.\n\nReinforcing the positive outlook, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 75, indicating that Ethereum\u2019s upward trajectory is poised to persist. Nevertheless, caution prevails as oversold conditions may trigger profit-taking among traders keen on safeguarding their capital.\n\nThis dual sentiment of optimism and caution sets the stage for a crucial juncture in Ethereum\u2019s price action.\n\nETH Signs Of Struggle Amidst A Resistance\n\nA separate analytical report underscores Ethereum\u2019s recurring struggle with a key resistance level, evident from the persistent price fluctuations converging around this threshold. Historical data points to the ramifications of prolonged resistance, often resulting in sharp price retracements.\n\nFor Ethereum, this could imply a more pronounced market correction, particularly considering the broader market dynamics currently at play. Investors and traders are advised to closely monitor these resistance levels, which could significantly impact short-term market sentiment and price movements.\n\nETH market cap currently trading at $218.356 Billion on the daily chart: TradingView.com\n\nUnveiling Ethereum: Low Network Activity\n\nUnderlying Ethereum\u2019s price fluctuations, an alarming trend emerges concerning the platform\u2019s subdued network activity. Despite its reputation as a thriving ecosystem for decentralized applications, the recent dip in on-chain operations raises concerns about waning interest or a potential shift of focus towards alternative blockchain platforms.\n\nAn active network isn\u2019t solely reliant on transaction volumes; it signifies ongoing development, upgrades, and the launch of new projects. The recent decline in network activity suggests a potential lull in these critical endeavors, prompting market participants to reevaluate the long-term sustainability of Ethereum\u2019s dominance within the blockchain space.\n\nETH seven-day price action. Source: Coingecko\n\nAs Ethereum\u2019s price hovers at $1,813, notching a 7.0% surge within 24 hours and a 14% upward trend over the past seven days, market observers remain vigilant as the cryptocurrency continues to navigate through critical resistance levels and grapples with network activity concerns.\n\nAs the cryptocurrency market continues to mature, Ethereum\u2019s future trajectory is intricately linked to its ability to address these challenges and uphold its position as a leading blockchain platform, vital for the broader ecosystem\u2019s growth and stability.\n\n(This site\u2019s content should not be construed as investment advice.

        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction as $10 Billion Trading Volume Comes In \u2013 Can $ETH Reach $2,000 Soon?\n\nSource: TradingView\n\nThe Ethereum price has dropped to $1,552 today, representing a 5% fall in the past 24 hours and a 6% loss in a week. The decline comes amid a marketwide selloff, caused by Kraken paying a $30 million settlement to the SEC and agreeing to end all staking services for US-based clients.\n\nDespite this knock to the market, Ethereum remains a strong prospect for investors, with the altcoin currently witnessing a 24-hour trading volume of over $10 billion. And with Visa recently saying that it\u2019s trialing stablecoin payments on the Ethereum blockchain, there are plenty of reasons to suspect that ETH will recover once again.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction as $10 Billion Trading Volume Comes In \u2013 Can $ETH Reach $2,000 Soon?\n\nBased solely on indicators, ETH is in a position for further losses at the moment. Its 30-day moving average (red) appears to have crested in relation to its 200-day (blue), so it should, along with its price, be due for falls.\n\nSource: TradingView\n\nIn addition, ETH\u2019s relative strength index (purple) has descended to just below 50, and may continue falling. As such, it really does seem like further losses could be in store for the altcoin this weekend.\n\nUp until yesterday, ETH had been protected by a support level at around $1,600. However, it seems that yesterday\u2019s news has provided the kind of negative event that forces an asset to fall through such a level.\n\nToday we charged Kraken with failing to register the offer and sale of their crypto asset staking-as-a-service program, whereby investors transfer crypto assets to Kraken for staking in exchange for advertised annual investment returns of as much as 21 percent. \u2014 U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (@SECGov) February 9, 2023\n\nAnd it could fall further, given how much ETH, which is now a proof-of-stake cryptocurrency, relies on staking. Indeed, it\u2019s worth noting that, despite the market falling as a whole, ETH has dropped further in the past 24 hours than Bitcoin, which is 3.5% down in the last 24 hours.\n\nThis negativity aside, members of the cryptocurrency community have already argued that the SEC\u2019s charges against Kraken, and Kraken\u2019s settlement, do not necessarily mean the end of staking in the US.\n\nFor instance, Coinbase has already insisted that it won\u2019t be ending its own staking services and that it\u2019s prepared to fight the US securities regulator on this issue.\n\nCoinbase says Kraken news will not affect their staking program\n\n\n\nSources say they\u2019re willing to fight SEC on this issue pic.twitter.com/6gMES5r50q \u2014 Frank Chaparro (@fintechfrank) February 9, 2023\n\nThis leaves plenty of hope for the continuation of staking in the US, while obviously, the rest of the world remains unaffected by the SEC\u2019s most recent power grab.\n\nAnd looking at Ethereum, its strong fundamentals offer numerous reasons to suspect that it will rise again soon. For example, this past week brought the news that payment giant Visa is testing USDC stablecoin payments on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nVisa has been testing how to do large settlements using $usdc on #ethereum. #crypto is going to be an everyday part of everyone's lives soon. Get ready. \u2014 Lark Davis (@TheCryptoLark) February 6, 2023\n\nThis is very bullish for Ethereum, and Visa\u2019s growing involvement with the platform may help it reinforce its dominant position with the cryptocurrency ecosystem. In fact, some analysts believe that ETH will outperform Bitcoin this year, with Bloomberg\u2019s Mike McGlone being the most notable example.\n\nBitcoin crosses series; Ethereum may be top candidate to continue outperforming the first born crypto \u2013#Ethereum's advances vs. #Bitcoin have been unshaken by 2022 deflation in most risk assets and may be gaining underpinnings. pic.twitter.com/mLRMO4vpQr \u2014 Mike McGlone (@mikemcglone11) December 20, 2022\n\nThere are various reasons for this optimism. For one, the Merge not only put Ethereum on course to become more scalable, but along with other upgrades (e.g. EIP 1559) it has also given ETH a tendency to become deflationary during periods of peak activity.\n\n#Ethereum becomes deflationary when the token's burn rate (from transaction fees) is greater than the staking reward for validators\n\n\n\nPoS ETH has only existed for a few months\n\n\n\nIn the next bull run, ETH may become even more deflationary with more people using Crypto regularly pic.twitter.com/Edpq0jrZR7 \u2014 Velvet.Capital (@Velvet_Capital) December 21, 2022\n\nWith all this in mind, there remains a very strong chance that ETH will not only recover back to $1,600, but will begin to trouble other levels soon enough. This includes $2,000, which is a realistic target for this year, while other levels may be achievable if the market manages to recover in general, free from negative news.\n\nBuy Ethereum Now\n\nIs Now A Good Time to Buy Ethereum?\n\nDespite ETH\u2019s strong fundamentals and long-term potential, it may not be a great idea to buy it right now, given the fallout from Kraken\u2019s settlement with the SEC yesterday. However, there are a number of other high-potential altcoins that do promise gains in the short term as well as the long term.\n\nAs such, we\u2019ve listed the top 15 cryptocurrencies for 2023, as analyzed by the CryptoNews Industry Talk team.\n\n\n\nThe list is updated weekly with new altcoins and ICO projects, so be sure to check back for new entries.\n\nDisclaimer: The Industry Talk section features insights by crypto industry players and is not a part of the editorial content of Cryptonews.com."

        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction with ETH Down 4.5% from Highs \u2013 Here\u2019s Where It\u2019s Headed Next\n\nETH recently found support at its 21DMA and a key Fibonacci level. Source: TradingView\n\nEthereum (ETH), the cryptocurrency that powers the smart-contract-enabled Ethereum blockchain network, has mounted a decent recovery on Thursday in tandem with a more risk-friendly tone to trade in traditional asset classes (US stocks are up and the US dollar is down).\n\nETH/USD was last changing hands in the $1,250 area, up 0.75% in the last 24 hours, and is up about 2.5% versus weekly lows in the $1,220 area.\n\nETH down 4.5% versus recent highs. Source: TradingView\n\nHowever, ETH is still trading lower by about 4.5% versus its early weekly highs just above $1,300. Ether bulls have struggled to reclaim control since the abrupt collapse of major cryptocurrency exchange FTX roughly one month ago. Prior to the exchange\u2019s implosion, ETH has been trading in the $1,500-$1,600 area. Since the collapse, rallies back to $1,300 have continually been sold by the market.\n\nData from crypto analytics firm Santiment regarding the realized profit-and-loss of ETH tokens moving on the Ethereum network show a spike in traders selling at a loss in wake of the FTX collapse. Selling from so-called \u201cweak hands\u201d might well continue to weigh on ETH\u2019s price in the near future.\n\nSource: Santiment\n\nPrice Prediction \u2013 Recovery to $1,300 On The Cards?\n\nLooking at ETH price over a shorter time horizon, the cryptocurrency appears to be heading lower within the confines of a bearish flag. ETH is currently testing the upper bounds of this flag structure, however, and looks as though it could break higher towards $1,300 once again.\n\nETH eyeing a break higher to $1,300 once again. Source: TradingView\n\nA further recovery in US stock markets and further weakness in the US dollar as the end of the week approaches, perhaps aided if Friday\u2019s US inflation figures come in softer-than-forecast, could be just the catalyst that the Ethereum bulls need. Technical buying may also help in wake of ETH having recently found support at its 21-Day Moving Average and the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level from the post-FTX collapse lows under $1,100 back to the pre-FTX collapse highs in the $1,600s.\n\nETH recently found support at its 21DMA and a key Fibonacci level. Source: TradingView\n\nLong-term Bearish ETH Headwinds Remain Dominant\n\nAn ETH recovery to $1,300, and even a break above this level, won\u2019t do much to change the cryptocurrency\u2019s longer-term technical outlook, which remains bearish. Indeed, ETH remains locked within a downtrend that has been in play since summer 2020 and looks ultimately likely to cap any near-term ETH upside.\n\nETH\u2019s long-term downtrend. Source: TradingView\n\nFor ETH to get out of the current bear trend, it would need to muster a sustained break to the north of the $1,500 area, a further 20% up from current levels. To get here, ETH would need to get above all of its 50, 100 and 200DMAs. Most longer-term bears will likely remain confident in their strategy of selling meaningful short-term ETH rallies.\n\nEthereum Whales Keep Accumulating\n\nWhile longer-term price speculators might be bearish, on-chain data shows that whale HODLers remain confident in the ETH\u2019s long-term prospects. According to Santiment, Ethereum wallets that hold between 100 and 1 million ETH tokens added a collective 561K ETH tokens between the 5th and 6th of December. That brings the holdings of so-called Ethereum \u201csharks and whales\u201d to its highest levels since before the Ethereum merge in early September.\n\nSource: Santinment\n\nAltcoins Offering Quicker Returns\n\nCryptocurrencies have been trading sideways for a few weeks now, leading some traders to start looking at alternatives with more potential in the short term.

Source: Adobe\n\nEther (ETH), the cryptocurrency that powers smart-contract-enabled Ethereum blockchain, hit its highest levels since last August on Tuesday close to $1,900, despite the network\u2019s upcoming Shanghai upgrade that some have warned might trigger a price drop amid a \u201csell-the-news\u201d event.\n\nAs a result, price predictions generally remain upbeat.\n\nOn the 12th of April, the Ethereum network will undergo a series of upgrades that will, first and foremost, enable the withdrawal of staked Ether tokens from the staking smart contract.\n\nWhile analysts view the development as a long-term positive for the network \u2013 it is assumed that more flexible staking withdrawals will eventually attract many more ETH owners into staking their tokens \u2013 some have warned that there could be short-term price pressures, as investors sell ETH tokens that have been stuck in staking contracts for a long time.\n\nETH staking has been active since late-2020 on Ethereum\u2019s beacon chain, prior to the Ethereum blockchain\u2019s merge to proof-of-stake last September.\n\nOthers have warned that in wake of ETH\u2019s stunning more than 55% gains since the turn of the year, a successful Shanghai upgrade might trigger profit-taking that could cause ETH price downside in the short term.\n\nPrice Prediction \u2013 Will Ether (ETH) Dump After the Upgrade?\n\nDespite these concerns about a potential dump, Ether\u2019s technical outlook is looking good in the short term.\n\nIn recent weeks, the cryptocurrency has continually found good support at its 21-Day Moving Average.\n\nAll of its major moving averages are all pointing higher in consecutive order, another bullish sign.\n\nA sustained push above the $1,850 area, which had previously been offering resistance, should open the door to a near-term test of the August 2022 highs above $2,000, assuming no post-Shanghai upgrade price dump.\n\nIn the longer term, technicals are also positive. ETH\u2019s 14-Day Relative Strength Index (RSI) is not yet in overbought territory, suggesting a reduced risk of near-term profit-taking.\n\nETH also saw a strong bounce from its 200DMA last month, a strong medium-term bullish indicator.\n\nThe \u201cgolden cross\u201d (when the 50-Day Moving Average crosses above the 200-Day Moving Average) in early February is another good sign for ETH\u2019s medium-term technical outlook.\n\nRecent news of an attack by a malicious Ethereum validator, while spreading concern about network security amongst the hard-core crypto community, hasn\u2019t had any effect on the price.\n\nThere may be malicious Ethereum verifiers who attack some MEV Bots transactions in the block, invalidate the MEV Bots transactions and replace them with their own transactions. Related MEV Bots have lost about $25 million. The attacker has become a validator 18 days ago\u2026 \u2014 Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) April 3, 2023\n\nThat could be because network upgrade optimism and macro tailwinds, such as expectations that the Fed will be cutting interest rates later this year to stave off a bank crisis and recession, remains in the forefront.\n\nIn the near term, bulls will likely continue buying any Ether price dips.\n\nA post-Shanghai upgrade sell-the-news driven dip back to the resistance-turned-support $1,700 area, which also roughly coincides with ETH\u2019s 50-Day Moving Average, could present a nice buying opportunity.\n\nEther (ETH) Alternatives to Consider\n\nWhile Ether\u2019s medium-term outlook is robust and a near-term move back above $2,000 is likely on the cards, investors should always be looking to diversify their crypto holdings.\n\nOne high-risk-high-reward investment strategy that some investors might want to consider is getting involved in crypto presales.\n\nThis is where investors buy the tokens of up-start crypto projects to help fund their development.\n\nThese tokens are nearly always sold very cheap and there is a long history of presales delivering huge exponential gains to early investors.\n\nOf course, there is always a chance that the project\u2019s founders don\u2019t deliver on the project\u2019s promises, and the presale tokens never take off in price (hence why they are sold so cheap).\n\nBut many of these projects have fantastic teams behind them and a great vision to deliver a revolutionary crypto application/platform.\n\nIf an investor can identify such projects, the risk/reward of their presale investment is very good.\n\nThe team at Cryptonews.com spends a lot of time combing through presale projects to help investors out.\n\nHere is a list of 15 of what the project deems as the best crypto presales of 2023.\n\nDisclaimer: The Industry Talk section features insights by crypto industry players and is not a part of the editorial content of Cryptonews.com."

Breaking $1,880 could accelerate gains toward $2,000.\n\nThe hourly MACD is gaining momentum in the bullish zone, supporting the uptrend.\n\nHowever, failure to clear overhead resistances could lead to a downside correction. Strong support lies at $1,700 and $1,650.\n\nEther hit a weekly high of $1,849 before pulling back slightly. However, the bullish sentiment is evident by the rally clearing the 100-hour SMA and a rising trendline forming on the hourly chart.\n\nThe hourly MACD indicator also flipped bullish, supporting the building upside momentum. Analysts say ETH needs to break above the resistors at $1,850 and $1,880 to sustain the uptrend.\n\nThis could open the doors for an accelerated rally toward the $2,000 mark if buyers can flip these levels into support. Further gains above $2,000 would bring the 2022 high of $2,200 into play.\n\nOn the flip side, failure to hold the $1,750 trendline support could lead to a downward move toward $1,700 and $1,650 in the near-term. Traders expect strong defense of these levels from the bulls.\n\nBut for now, buyers seem to be back in control after weeks of bearish sentiment. The recent surge also comes as Bitcoin reclaimed $34,000, lifting the overall crypto market sentiment.\n\nIf the Ethereum bulls can build on this momentum, we could be in the early stages of a new uptrend after months of depressed prices across crypto assets."

        "content": "Is it Too Late to Buy Ethereum? Crypto Experts Give Their ETH Price Predictions for 2023\n\nSince failing to break above early November resistance in the $1,675 area towards the end of last week, Ether (ETH), the token that powers the Ethereum blockchain, has been in consolidation mode. It was last moving sideways in the $1,600s, as traders monitor upcoming macro drivers including US Q4 2022 GDP growth figures on Thursday and December Core PCE inflation data on Friday.\n\nBoth data readings could impact expectations for Fed tightening this year, which could impact crypto \u2013 easing expectations for Fed tightening as a result of evidence of slowing US inflation and growth have lifted crypto so far this year. Indeed, despite its recent consolidation, Ethereum is still trading over 35% higher so far this year, meaning the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is on course for its best monthly performance since July 2022.\n\nWhere Next For ETH?\n\nPositive macro tailwinds, as well as optimism about Ethereum\u2019s upcoming upgrade that will allow withdrawals could well support further upside. Indeed, progress towards the so-called \u201cShanghai\u201d hard fork appears to be going smoothly \u2013 a core Ethereum developer just announced on Twitter that developers are have created a new test-net to test the soon-to-be-released staked ETH withdrawal feature.\n\nWithdrawal-Mainnet-Shadow-Fork-1 is finalizing \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\n\n\nIt started out with a few issues because the config wasn't correctly applied on geth (we disallow overriding the mainnet config). The config is applied correctly and all nodes are in agreement. We will start some evil nodes,. \u2014 MariusVanDerWijden (@vdWijden) January 23, 2023\n\nMeanwhile, another possible tailwind could be if ETH supply conditions remain deflationary. According to data from ultrasound.money, ETH\u2019s annual inflation rate fell into negative territory again at the start of last week for the first time since November.\n\nA break above the $1,675 resistance area could open the door to a swift rally towards the next major resistance zone around $1,790 and then the summer 2020 highs in the $2,030.\n\nExperts Give Their Price Predictions\n\nAccording to algorithm-powered crypto forecast website Wallet Investor, Ethereum is likely to trade just above $700 in one year\u2019s time, around 55% lower versus current levels.\n\nAnalysts at DigitalCoinPrice aren\u2019t so bearish. Their algorithm predicts Ethereum ending 2023 at around $3,450, an impressive more than 100% up versus current levels.\n\nMeanwhile, according to a recent survey of 55 fintech experts conducted by Finder.com, Ethereum is expected to end 2025 at $5,150 per token, before eventually rising to $11,700 in 2030. CEO and co-founder of Osom Finance, Anton Altement, explained that he is bullish on ETH because last year\u2019s Merge has turned ETH into both a deflationary and a yield-bearing asset.\n\nHe added that pessimism driven by Fed tightening should ease in 2023, while concerns about still locked ETH staking will also soon be alleviated by the upcoming Shanghai hard fork upgrade expected at the end of this quarter.\n\nMartin Froehler, CEO of Morpher, also outlined a bullish viewpoint. According to the survey, Foehler expects massive institutional demand for ETH in the coming years as a result of the cryptocurrency\u2019s positive features. These include ETH\u2019s yield of about 5% via staking, its eco-friendly nature post-Merge from proof of work, the fact that it is classified as a commodity, and the fact that ETH has a regulated futures contract on the CME to hedge against price volatility.\n\nIs It Too Late to Buy Ethereum?\n\nIf the above bullish forecast are correct, it certainly isn\u2019t too late. Yes, it would have been preferable to have scooped up ETH back in June 2022 when it bottomed in the $800s per token. But if you are a long-term investor looking to hold Ethereum until it rallies above $10,000, its not going to matter to much whether you bought at $800 or current levels in the $1,600s.\n\nEthereum is still down about 65% from its record highs hit in late 2021 in the $4,800s. So far in Ethereum\u2019s history, buying it when it is still 65% below recent record highs has so far been a profitable strategy, even if investors weren\u2019t able to catch the bottom.\n\nBuy Ethereum Now\n\nEthereum Alternatives\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for other high-potential crypto projects alongside ETH, we\u2019ve reviewed the top 15 cryptocurrencies for 2023, as analyzed by the CryptoNews Industry Talk team.\n\n\n\nThe list is updated weekly with new altcoins and ICO projects.\n\nDisclaimer: The Industry Talk section features insights by crypto industry players and is not a part of the editorial content of Cryptonews.com."

        "content": "After Eight Years of Dormancy, Long-Forgotten Ethereum ICO Wallet Resurfaces with $15 Million Worth of Funds\n\nSource: Adobe\n\nA wallet dating back to the Ethereum (ETH) initial coin offering (ICO) in 2015 has caught the attention of the crypto community after it suddenly moved a significant amount of funds.\n\nThe wallet, which has been completely inactive since the ICO, on Saturday transferred all of its 8,000 ETH to another newly created address, on-chain data from Etherscan shows.\n\nThe fund movement was made in two transactions, with one test transaction worth just 1 ETH first, followed by another transfer of the remaining 7,999 ETH.\n\nIn total, the transfers are worth some $15.2 million by today\u2019s exchange rate, representing a massive increase in the value of the wallet since it was set up during the ICO with ETH worth only $2,500.\n\nThe wallet dates back to the Ethereum ICO. Source: Etherscan\n\nOne noteworthy detail is that the new wallet that the funds were sent to recorded a separate inbound transaction of 207 ETH, worth close to $400,000, just moments earlier.\n\nThat transaction came from a wallet that have been dormant since 2017, and it remains unknown who owns it and why the funds are now being consolidated.\n\nOn Twitter, on-chain researcher Lookonchain was quick to share details about the original transaction, with members of the crypto community taking the opportunity to comment under the tweet with their own theories about the transfer.\n\n\u201cMaybe switch from Ledger,\u201d one user suggested, referring to the controversy around the popular hardware wallet Ledger\u2019s new \u201cRecover\u201d service.\n\nLedger launched its first version of a hardware wallet in 2014, which makes it plausible that the mysterious Ethereum whale could be storing his or her funds on one of the early iterations of the device."

        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction as Market Cap Hits $200 Billion: What\u2019s Next for ETH?\n\nEthereum Logo / Source: Cryptonews.com\n\nEther (ETH), the cryptocurrency that powers the layer-1 smart-contract-enabled Ethereum blockchain, is rising in tandem with the broader crypto market on Monday and was last up around 3% over the past 24 hours, as per CoinGecko.\n\nThe cryptocurrency\u2019s latest rally has seen it reclaim a market cap of $200 billion, with the ETH price last around $1,680, more than 10% up from earlier monthly lows.\n\nEther is the second most valuable cryptocurrency in the world next to Bitcoin (BTC), which has a market cap of nearly three times as much at just over $600 billion.\n\nEthereum remains by far the most widely used and trusted smart-contract-enabled blockchain in the crypto space.\n\nIts dominance is emphasized by its 68% share of the total value of all cryptocurrency locked into smart contracts, or trade value locked (TVL), as per DeFi Llama.\n\nEther Has Been Lagging Bitcoin\n\nWhile Ether has been rallying as of late in tandem with the broader market amid optimism about upcoming spot Bitcoin Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) approvals in the US, ETH remains a big relative underperformer when compared to Bitcoin, both this year and in recent weeks.\n\nWhere Bitcoin is up around 16% in the last 30 days and nearly 80% this year, Ether is up a more modest 6% in the past 30 days, and a much more conservative 34% this year.\n\nThis divergence in performance could partially be explained by Bitcoin-specific fundamentals, like optimism about upcoming spot Bitcoin ETFs, the fact that Bitcoin appears to be the safest cryptocurrency from regulatory risk (no major regulators are trying to claim it\u2019s a security), and general safe-haven demand for Bitcoin.\n\nEther\u2019s \u201cWeak\u201d Fundamentals\n\nBut some of Ether\u2019s relative weakness can likely be explained by \u201cweak\u201d fundamentals relating to the cryptocurrency.\n\nFor instance, demand for the recently launched Ether futures ETFs in the US was very weak, suggesting limited institutional interest.\n\nThat shouldn\u2019t come as much of a surprise given that spot Ether trading volumes on major cryptocurrency exchanges remain at around their weakest since late 2020 as per The Block, back when the Ether price was in the hundreds of dollars.\n\nMeanwhile, as per data presented by Glassnode, in a sign of weak on-chain activity, gas fees have been falling as of late, meaning a lower ETH burn rate.\n\nIn recent weeks, the ETH burn rate has fallen below the cryptocurrency\u2019s issuance rate, meaning that the Ether supply has at times become inflationary once again.\n\nSince the end of August, the ETH supply has subsequently risen by just over 100,000 to just above 120 million, reducing the token\u2019s scarcity and weighing on its value.\n\nOn-chain weakness, and the overall seemingly subdued demand for Ether, is further evident in the stagnation of the blockchain\u2019s TVL.\n\nAs per DeFi Llama, Ethereum\u2019s TVL has been in a downtrend since peaking in April at around $70 billion, and, at around $48 billion, remains well below its early 2022 all-time peak above $200 billion.\n\nRising interest rates on risk-free US government bonds probably explain this stagnation \u2013 why buy highly volatile staked Ether derivatives for a yield of less than 4% when you can get a yield of over 5% on risk-free US government bonds?\n\nHigh US (and other) government bond yields will remain a key headwind to the health and growth of Ethereum\u2019s DeFi ecosystem.\n\nPrice Prediction \u2013 What\u2019s Next for Ether (ETH)?\n\nAll that being said, Ether price predictions could be about to take a substantial turn for the better if the cryptocurrency is able to break above key resistance at the $1,700 level.\n\nETH is currently facing headwinds in this area from a downtrend from the July highs and from the 100DMA.\n\nBut should Ether break above this level, a run higher towards the 200DMA just under $1,800 level is likely, with a break above this area opening the door to a run higher towards the summer highs just above $2,000.\n\nEther (ETH) Chart / Source: TradingView\n\nWith the broader market rallying, led by Bitcoin, Ether will likely continue to pull higher in the weeks ahead.\n\nWill it be able to outperform Bitcoin, however? Probably not.\n\nEther\u2019s outperformance probably won\u2019t become a major narrative again until its aforementioned weak fundamentals (on-chain activity, TVL) start seeing solid improvements.\n\nCrypto Alternative to Consider \u2013 Bitcoin Minetrix ($BTCMTX)\n\nThe outlook for blue-chip crypto markets is good, but traders should always be on the lookout for diversification opportunities.\n\nAn exciting new decentralized Bitcoin mining protocol called Bitcoin Minetrix is generating a lot of hype, and has already raised over $2.1 million in funds from early investors into its $BTCMTX token presale.\n\n$BTCMTX is the token that powers the protocol \u2013 investors who buy $BTCMTX can then stake their tokens to start earning non-transferable Bitcoin Minetrix mining credits.\n\nThese credits can then be burnt by their owners, and in exchange, they will get a share in Bitcoin Minetrix\u2019s Bitcoin mining revenues.\n\n$BTCMTX token holders will also earn $BTCMTX rewards, with a portion of the token supply already set aside to reward early stakers.\n\nBitcoin Minetrix\u2019s protocol is governor by smart contracts built on top of the decentralized Ethereum blockchain, which is also where its token is issued.\n\nThe protocol thus offers better transparency and security versus other centralized cloud mining services.\n\nCheck Out Bitcoin Minetrix Here"

        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction as European Financial Firm Launches Euro Stablecoin on Ethereum Blockchain \u2013 ETH to $10,000 in 2023?\n\nSource: TradingView\n\nThe Ethereum price has fallen by 1.5% in the past 24 hours, as the cryptocurrency market suffers a similar 2% fall in the same period.\n\nAt $1,920, ETH is also down by 4.5% in the last week, yet remains up by 6% in the last 30 days and by 60.5% since the beginning of the year.\n\nDespite today\u2019s fall, the bull case for ETH has been strengthened further by the news that major French bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale has launched a euro-denominated stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nWhen combined with last week\u2019s successful Shanghai upgrade and ongoing development work, such adoption news makes it clear that Ethereum is likely to remain the dominant layer-one blockchain for a long time to come.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction as European Financial Firm Launches Euro Stablecoin on Ethereum Blockchain \u2013 ETH to $10,000 in 2023?\n\nIt\u2019s arguable that ETH may have to fall a little further before it can resume rising again, at least judging by its indicators.\n\nSource: TradingView\n\nFor one, the coin\u2019s relative strength index (purple) has fallen quite sharply in the past few days, with its descent to 50 indicating a big spike in selling pressure, which could get worse as the RSI falls towards 30 or lower.\n\nSimilarly, ETH\u2019s 30-day moving average (yellow) remains much higher than its 200-day (blue), meaning that it\u2019s still due a substantial fall, implying further price falls for the altcoin.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth pointing out that the Ethereum price fell through the psychologically important $2,000 support level a couple of days, something which could also signal further drops.\n\nHowever, it needs to be remembered that ETH has lost ground more because of the market and its need for a correction than for anything related to Ethereum itself and its development.\n\nIndeed, the news that Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale\u2019s digital assets unit is launching a stablecoin on Ethereum is a major validation of the platform.\n\nNot only does it suggest that major financial institutions and enterprises are likelier to put their trust in Ethereum than any of its rivals, but it also shows that Ethereum\u2019s recent development and updates are paying off in terms of adoption.\n\nAnd most recently, the Shanghai update has only strengthened Ethereum\u2019s fundamentals in that it has effectively completed the platform\u2019s transition to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, enabling stakers to withdraw their stake and rewards.\n\nThe implementation of withdrawals is likely to increase Ethereum staking over time, with some analysts predicting that the platform\u2019s staking rate (in terms of the overall supply of ETH) will rise somewhere close to 60%.\n\n1. The current staking rate of #Ethereum is about 15%, and the average staking rate of other PoS blockchains reaches to 60%. Given such condition, the staking rate of #Ethereum still has plenty of room for improvement. \u2014 0xjerome (@jerome_wong99) March 26, 2023\n\nThis will result in a big contraction in the circulating supply of ETH, which in turn should result in a steadily rising price over time.\n\nAs such, the market can expect ETH to return to $2,000 soon enough before starting a climb toward $3,000 by the end of the year.\n\nFrom there, a new bull market in 2024 could push it back toward $4,000, where it will eventually start troubling its current all-time high of $4,878.\n\nBuy Ethereum Now\n\nNew Altcoins Offer Potential for Big Short-Term Gains\n\nAs strong as Ethereum is on a fundamental level, it may not see substantial gains for several months now.\n\nBecause of this, traders on the hunt for quicker above-average gains may prefer to look towards newer altcoins, with some presale tokens having the potential for notable rises once they list a little later in the year.\n\nOne of the most promising of these is Love Hate Inu, a decentralized polling platform that will launch in the next few months.\n\nIt opened the presale for its LHINU token just less than a month ago, and it has already raised a very impressive $5 million.\n\nWow!\ud83d\udce2\n\n\n\nThe $LHINU #Presale has reached an incredible $5 Million!\ud83d\udcb0\n\n\n\nMassive thanks to the entire #LoveHateIny Gang!\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc36\n\n\n\nTake action and by getting some $LHINU tokens, and casting your vote!\ud83d\uddf3\ufe0f\ud83d\udcaa\n\n\n\nDon\u2019t miss out on the chance to win $10k!\u23f0https://t.co/Pu2Bo8WOUy#MemeCoins pic.twitter.com/nsBQZuLoRk \u2014 Love Hate Inu (@LoveHateInu) April 21, 2023\n\nSuch a figure suggests that investors have become increasingly interested in Love Hate Inu\u2019s platform, will reward users (in LHINU) for participating in a variety of polls and surveys.\n\nLove Hate Inu\u2019s polling works via staking, with users who stake a higher quantity of LHINU receiving a larger voting weight when they participate in polls.\n\nWhile many online polling and survey companies have cropped up in the last few years, what sets Love Hate Inu apart from the pack is that aims to harness polling to the viral power of meme tokens and social media-based cryptocurrency communities.\n\nWho wants a say in what happens on the #LoveHateInu platform?\ud83e\udd14\n\n\n\nThen you need some $LHINU tokens!\ud83d\udcaa\n\n\n\nStake your tokens for maximum voting power!\ud83d\uddf3\ufe0f\n\n\n\nPlus, you can't create a poll without 'em!\ud83d\udcca\n\n\n\nJoin the #Presale today!\ud83d\ude80#CryptoCommunity #AltCoins #MemeCoins \u2014 Love Hate Inu (@LoveHateInu) April 16, 2023\n\nInvestors can join its presale by visiting the official Love Hate Inu website, where they can use USDT, ETH or fiat currency to buy the altcoin.\n\nThe sale is now in its fifth stage, with one LHINU token costing $0.0000115, although this will rise again to $0.0000125 in three days, so interested investors are advised to act sooner rather than later.\n\nVisit Love Hate Inu Here"

Each client most definitely had different things to tackle any issues. \u2014 Ethprofit.eth \ud83e\udd87\ud83d\udd0a (@Ethprofit) May 12, 2023\n\nThe blockchain experienced what is being described as technical issues on Friday that caused the network to stop finalizing blocks for over an hour.\n\nIt was the second such incident within 24 hours, which sparked major security concerns for users of the Ethereum blockchain, the second-largest blockchain by market capitalization.\n\nFinalized blocks play an essential role in providing proof-of-work validation, making networks like Ethereum easy to trust and reliable to use.\n\nIn Ethereum, finality takes roughly 15 minutes and refers to the guarantee that a block cannot be altered or removed from the blockchain without burning at least 33% of the total staked ETH, according to the Ethereum Foundation.\n\nDespite its technical hiccup, the Ethereum network resumed finalizing blocks and continues to operate effectively.\n\nEthereum Reliability at Stake Amid Performance Issues\n\nEthereum\u2019s performance issues within the past week could stain its credibility in the eyes of builders.\n\nNetwork reliability is essential for blockchains looking to attract users and capital, and Ethereum has historically been viewed as among the most stable networks in the market.\n\nSome of the services built atop Ethereum, such as DYdX, a leading crypto exchange platform, had to pause deposits temporarily due to Ethereum\u2019s lack of finality.\n\n\u201cThe second wave is over, but I fully expect a third,\u201d Superphiz.eth, a self-proclaimed \u201cEthereum Beacon Chain community health consultant, tweeted after today\u2019s incident.\n\nThe Ethereum guru also advised validators to increase their hardware specs if they can, switch to a minority client, and apply patches when they become available. He added:\n\n\u201cBut really don\u2019t worry too much. As bad as this looks, the chain keeps going and eventually finalizes.\u201d\n\nThe pinnacle of a well decentralized system is that it can take a beating and keep going. Ethereum choked but kept going. We can continue to improve by getting staked Ether away from industry and putting those coins to work staking in homes by people passionate about Ethereum. \u2014 superphiz.eth \ud83e\udd87\ud83d\udd0a\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f (@superphiz) May 13, 2023\n\nEthereum has become an integral part of the blockchain ecosystem, hosting multi-billion-dollar networks of financial infrastructure and other applications.\n\nAccording to data by DefiLlama, there is currently over $27 billion in Total Value Locked (TVL) across the Ethereum network.\n\nLiquid staking platform Lido Finance accounts for the bulk majority of that figure, with more than $12 billion in TVL. MakerDAO, AAVE, and Curve Finance are the next three biggest DeFi platforms on Ethereum.\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum\u2019s native token ETH is trading at around $1,800, up by 2.0% over the past day. The token is down by almost 7% over the past week."

        "content": "Ethereum Bot Operated by Jaredfromsubway.eth Bags More Than $40 Million in Three Months\n\nSource: AdobeStock / bravissimos\n\nAn Ethereum bot run by pseudonymous crypto user Jaredfromsubway.eth has made $40 million in just three months by using a technique known as \u201csandwiching\u201d on decentralized exchanges (DEXs).\n\nThe bot operated by Jaredfromsubway.eth is a so-called MEV bot designed to use \u201csandwiching\u201d techniques \u2013 essentially front-running other traders \u2013 on DEXs where popular meme coins such as Pepe Coin (PEPE) are traded.\n\nMEV is short for maximal extractable value, and represents the maximum value validators can extract from a block on the Ethereum blockchain by reordering, inserting or censoring transactions within blocks.\n\nAccording to a report by EigenPhi, a site that analyzes the decentralized finance (DeFi) market, jaredfromsubway\u2019s bot earned a total of $40 million over the course of the 3 months through a combination of front-running and holding on to the right tokens.\n\nWhen subtracting blockchain fees of approximately $6 million, the total profit comes in at $34 million.\n\n\u201cThe bot is not limited to performing sandwich attacks; it also holds onto some of the altcoins in the back-run transactions when their prices are increasing. By holding onto PEPE, for example, the bot is able to generate even more profits,\u201d the EigenPhi report said.\n\nRising transaction fees caused by bot\n\nThe bot has since its creation in February become extremely active, and transactions from the bot are now present in more than 60% of all Ethereum blocks.\n\nThe massive number of transactions generated by the bot has also led to a noticeable uptick in transaction fees on the Ethereum network this year, with the average fee paid reaching a high above $27 last Saturday.\n\nSource: BitInfoCharts\n\nSuccess comes from \u201cskill, strategy, and tech\u201d\n\nAccording to a pseudonymous crypto developer known as Nox, the success of these types of bots comes as a result of \u201cskill, strategy, and tech.\u201d\n\njaredfromsubway.eth is mostly utilizing these toxic MEV opportunities.\n\n\n\nTheir success can be attributed to skill, strategy, and tech. Jared's bot identifies more MEV opportunities and executes transactions faster than competitors. \ud83c\udfce\ufe0f\n\n\n\n3/7 \u2014 Nox (@0xNox_eth) May 8, 2023\n\nMEV bots have in the past been profitable by leveraging information about transactions that are about to be executed, often through arbitrage trading that capitalizes on price differences between decentralized exchanges.\n\nMEV bots utilizing \u201csandwich\u201d attacks basically front-run other trades, purchasing currency slightly cheaper than other traders, which results in their practices being viewed as a form of \u201cinvisible\u201d tax on regular DEX users.\n\nTo date, 27 Ethereum-based projects have joined forces to launch MEV Blocker, aiming to minimize the value extracted from traders by MEV bots.\n\nLast month, stablecoin issuer Tether took action and blacklisted an Ethereum validator address linked to $25 million worth of crypto drained from DEXs with MEV bots."

        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction as ETH Dips Below $1,500 \u2013 Where is the Next Support?\n\nEther (ETH), the cryptocurrency that powers the smart-contract-enabled Ethereum blockchain, fell under $1,500 and hit its lowest level in nearly a month in the $1460s on Monday. At current levels in the $1,480s, the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was last trading about 2.0% lower on the day, with losses from earlier monthly highs in the $1,700s now over 13%. That still leaves the cryptocurrency up around 25% on the year, though gains such as these can quickly be given back in crypto markets.\n\nRegulatory Concerns Weigh on ETH\n\nThe cryptocurrency market continues to suffer from fears about aggressive US regulatory action. Reports surfaced over the weekend that the US SEC is going to sue US-based BUSD stablecoin issuer Paxos Trust Co. for breaking investor protection laws over offering stablecoins unregistered securities. The move has drawn significant criticism from the crypto community, given skepticism regarding how investors can have an \u201cexpectation of profit\u201d when buying a stablecoin like BUSD, which is designed to be stable in price.\n\nThe SEC has labelled BUSD as an \u201cunregistered security\u201d, and is suing its issuer, Paxos.\n\n\n\nBut how on earth is a STABLECOIN considered a security, when it clearly doesn\u2019t meet the Howey Test criteria.\n\n\n\nNo one has ever had \u201cthe expectation of profit\u201d when buying $BUSD. pic.twitter.com/QXOlDUyvc3 \u2014 Miles Deutscher (@milesdeutscher) February 13, 2023\n\nThis comes after Kraken came to a settlement with the SEC and shuttered its crypto-staking program, which the SEC had also labeled as an unregistered security. Since the Ethereum blockchain\u2019s switch to a proof-of-stake mechanism in September 2022, US regulatory action against staking services in the US is creating uncertainty for Ethereum network validators.\n\nHead of business development for the Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) that managed Decentralized Finance (DeFi) protocol Lido Finance Jacob Blish recently said the move by the SEC to crack down on staking might have uncertain consequences for Decentralized Finance. Lido Finance is the largest decentralized finance protocol offering ETH liquid staking services.\n\nElsewhere, executives from Coinbase, the largest US-based exchange, which also operates an ETH staking service, this weekend said they would \u201chappily defend\u201d staking in US courts.\n\nCoinbase's staking services are not securities. We will happily defend this in court if needed.https://t.co/GtTOz77YV3 \u2014 Brian Armstrong \ud83d\udee1\ufe0f (@brian_armstrong) February 12, 2023\n\nPrice Prediction \u2013 Where Next for ETH?\n\nEther has for now found support at its 50-Day Moving Average (DMA) around $1,470, but a test of the 200DMA at $1,440 is a possibility if regulatory concerns continue to dampen near-term sentiment. However, traders may be reluctant to chase another big push lower on Monday, given the proximity of Tuesday\u2019s key US Consumer Price Index (CPI) data for January, which will further inform the outlook for US Federal Reserve policy.\n\nA downside surprise could give ETH some respite and see the cryptocurrency recover back into the $1,500s. However, an upside surprise to consensus, which is already forecasting a MoM acceleration in price pressures, could trigger a drop to the next major area of resistance. This is around $1,350, where the December high, 100DMA and an uptrend from November/December all reside.\n\nBuy Ethereum Now\n\nETH Alternatives to Consider\n\nAs discussed above, ETH\u2019s near-term outlook is patchy. Traders looking for quick gains may prefer to consider other high-potential tokens, such as those being sold in pre-sale by promising up-and-coming crypto projects. We\u2019ve reviewed some of the best candidates in this list of the top 15 cryptocurrencies for 2023, as analyzed by the CryptoNews Industry Talk team.\n\n\n\nThe list is updated weekly with new altcoins and ICO projects.\n\nDisclaimer: The Industry Talk section features insights by crypto industry players and is not a part of the editorial content of Cryptonews.com."

All unstaking requests are processed on-chain, and we\u2019ll pass the unstaked funds and staking rewards to you once released by the Ethereum protocol. \u2014 Coinbase \ud83d\udee1\ufe0f\ud83d\udcde (@coinbase) March 15, 2023\n\nCoinbase\u2019s support of Ethereum also comes in addition to Visa\u2019s, which in February revealed it\u2019s trialing USDC stablecoin payments on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nWhile this is only a test, it underlines how Ethereum is likely to be the main winner in attempts by the wider cryptocurrency ecosystem to attract mainstream and enterprise adoption.\n\nThis makes the future look exceedingly bright for ETH, with the coin likely to rise back up to $2,000 in the next few months, assuming that the current banking crisis doesn\u2019t develop into a full-blown financial crisis.\n\nFrom there, it could easily witness new heights in 2024, helped by renewed bullishness triggered by the next Bitcoin halving.\n\nBuy Ethereum Now"

        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction as SEC Chair Gary Gensler Refuses to Say if ETH is a Security \u2013 Bullish for Ethereum?\n\nEthereum. Source: Adobe\n\nA combination of rising US bond yields, concerns about what hotter-than-expected UK inflation might mean for the US inflation outlook and an aggressive liquidation of long positions has seen the price of Ether (ETH) drop sharply on Wednesday.\n\nBut price predictions still remain upbeat.\n\nThe token, which powers the smart-contract-enabled Ethereum blockchain and is the second most valuable cryptocurrency by market capitalization after Bitcoin, was last trading just to the south of the $2,000 level, down around 6.0% on the day, as per TradingView.\n\nThat means ETH is down around 7.5% versus the multi-month highs it hit in the mid-$2,100s last week.\n\nThe drop on Wednesday has triggered a sharp spike in liquidations of leverage long ETH futures positions, as per data presented by crypto derivatives analytics website coinglass.\n\nLong positions worth close to $45 million have been wiped out so far this Wednesday, the highest since the 8th of March.\n\nSEC Chair Gensler Refuses to Say Whether ETH a Security or Not \u2013 Bullish?\n\nSome cited analysts cited uncertainty about the outlook for regulation in the US as also weighing on the ETH price.\n\nSEC Chairman Gary Gensler, whose agency has been pushing for more oversight over crypto markets and cracking down on crypto firms operating in the US in recent months, appeared before Congress on Tuesday.\n\nCongressman Patrick McHenry, who chairs the House Financial Services Committee, pressed Gensler to be specific about whether he views ETH as a security or not.\n\nDespite the SEC having already taken out enforcement action against US-based crypto firms based on the view that it is a security, Gensler avoided the question and refused to give a definitive answer about ETH.\n\nBut in the past, Gensler is on record as having said he does view ETH as a security.\n\nHe answered while at MIT pic.twitter.com/hWRb2fdcGv \u2014 Meech (@elVeeVaughn) April 18, 2023\n\nSome have suggested Gensler\u2019s reluctance to label ETH a security before Congress might be bullish for ETH, given that it leaves the door open to the agency potentially backing off from trying to regulate ETH as a security.\n\nThe market reaction suggests this isn\u2019t the consensus view.\n\nIndeed, the market seems to have not liked the lack of clarity from the SEC chairman.\n\nInvestors in ETH and other similar cryptocurrencies will remain on edge about what enforcement action could be coming from the SEC in the coming months.\n\nPrice Prediction \u2013 Where Next for ETH?\n\nEther is approaching a key area of short-term support where the early April highs (at $1,940, 21-Day Moving Average (at $1,927) and an uptrend from the late-March lows all intersect.\n\nA bounce here would be a strong vote of confidence in the market\u2019s near-term bullish momentum and would probably result in a swift rally back to annual highs in the mid-$2,100s and perhaps on towards the next major resistance area just above $2,300.\n\nNotably, the latest drop has seen Ethereum\u2019s 14-Day Relative Strength Index (RSI) fall out of overbought territory, meaning a reduced risk of ongoing profit-taking/long-liquidations.\n\nPost-Ethereum blockchain upgrade optimism, coupled with the ongoing dual deflationary tailwinds of more ETH moving into the staking contract and continually being burnt means that, in the medium to long term, ETH\u2019s trading bias is likely to remain to the upside, so long as the macro picture doesn\u2019t sour to drastically.\n\nTechnical tailwinds may also continue to lift the cryptocurrency, such as ongoing support since ETH\u2019s powerful bounce from the 200DMA last month and from the \u201cgolden cross\u201d in early February."

        "content": "Ethereum price is on the verge of breaking out and closing in the coveted psychological resistance at $2,000. Interest in the largest smart contracts token has continued to increase with Bitcoin price reclaiming resistance/support at $31,000.\n\nMost traders anticipate a continued bullish action across the market, with ETH following closely in the footsteps of the bellwether cryptocurrency and starting the second recovery phase beyond $2,000 and targeting areas around $2,500 and $3,000 respectively.\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum Price Prediction: ETH On The Cusp of Validating 12% Move\n\nEthereum completed the formation of a double-bottom pattern following a rebound from support at $1,530, which currently awaits validation at $1,745 (neckline resistance).\n\nThe presence of two golden cross patterns formed when the 21-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) (red) crossed above the 1000-day EMA (blue) and subsequently above the 200-day EMA (purple), hints at the uptrend\u2019s continuation.\n\nIf traders keep their buy orders open, they are likely to build momentum for a 12.25% breakout to $1,958. Following the breakout, trading volume is expected to surge significantly as traders seek fresh exposure to Ether above the neckline resistance.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) with a strength of 75 reveals that Ethereum price is in a position to keep the uptrend intact. However, caution is advised due to the oversold conditions likely to encourage traders to sell ETH to book profits, or protect their capital.\n\nBased on the money floor index (MFI), bulls have the upper hand. This indicator tracks the inflow and outflow of money, hence a persistent increase implies that buyers are in control of the uptrend.\n\nThe MFI with a strength of 76 is not yet oversold implying that there is still room for growth. With Ethereum price at $1,690 on Monday, a break above $1,700 is required to secure the uptrend and affirm the bullish outlook to $2,000.\n\nTrading above $2,000 would be a game changer for Ethereum bulls and might be the catalyst the token has been waiting for to start the bull run. On the downside, failure to retain support at $1,670 and $1,630 could trigger another sell-off to $1,550. However, as long as Ethereum holds above all the moving averages, the path with the least resistance will remain to the upside.\n\nEthereum DeFi TVL Grows To $23 Billion\n\nThe transition to the proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism from a proof-of-work (PoW) protocol opened Ethereum to a whole new decentralized finance (DeFi) world backed by the rise of liquid staking tokens like Lido and Rocket Pool.\n\nDespite the lengthy crypto winter, investors have maintained exposure to DeFi products within the Ethereum ecosystem, which according to data by Defi Llama has a total value locked of $21.27 billion. The ecosystem\u2019s 24-hour inflows increased to $45 million with with $1.49 million recorded as revenue.\n\nRelated Articles"

        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction as Early Ethereum ICO Whale Becomes Active After 7 Years \u2013 What\u2019s Going On?\n\nSource: TradingView\n\nThe Ethereum price has dropped by 2% in the past 24 hours, falling to $1,810 following the news that a participant in the cryptocurrency\u2019s 2016 ICO has moved 1 ETH to a new address.\n\nToday\u2019s dip means that ETH has declined by 13% in a week, although it\u2019s still up by 3% in the last 30 days and by 51% since the beginning of the year.\n\nHowever, with the aforementioned ICO investor potentially testing the waters for a larger transfer and possibly a sale, there\u2019s a chance that ETH could witness a few further decreases in the near future.\n\nYet in the longer term, April\u2019s successful Shanghai upgrade has only strengthened Ethereum\u2019s already-strong fundamentals, with the platform and its native token in good shape for further gains in the coming months.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction as Early Ethereum ICO Whale Becomes Active After 7 Years \u2013 What\u2019s Going On?\n\nETH\u2019s chart suggests that the selling is likely to stop in the immediate future, with its indicators set up for further declines.\n\nSource: TradingView\n\nIn particular, the coin\u2019s relative strength index (purple) has dropped below 50 and continues to decline, with price falls not likely to correct themselves until the RSI reaches 30 and/or falls below it.\n\nAt the same time, ETH\u2019s 30-day moving average (yellow) remains far beyond its 200-day (blue), indicating that the altcoin hasn\u2019t come close to bottoming out just yet.\n\nIndeed, ETH continues to fall through support levels, breaching $2,000 towards the end of last week and sliding below $1,900 over the weekend.\n\nIt looks like it could fall through $1,800 as well, especially if the news of an Ethereum ICO whale moving some long-dormant ETH is to be taken seriously.\n\nAn Ethereum ICO participant woke up after 7.7 years of dormancy and transferred 1 $ETH to a new address.\n\n\n\nHe received 2,365 $ETH($4.42M currently) at Ethereum Genesis, the ETH ICO price is ~$0.31.https://t.co/hOfBSyml19 pic.twitter.com/yoMoB6vE9n \u2014 Lookonchain (@lookonchain) April 24, 2023\n\nOn the one hand, the fact that this whale has begun moving ETH after more than seven years of dormancy should be taken as a potential warning sign.\n\nYet, on the other hand, they moved only 1 ETH out of a total received amount of 2,365 ETH, so it\u2019s not necessarily the case that the whale is gearing up to offload more than $4 million in the cryptocurrency.\n\nOther whales seem to be more inclined to sell at the moment, however, suggesting that ETH is due further falls before recovering again.\n\nDespite today\u2019s fall, the bull case for ETH has been strengthened in recent days by the news that major French bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale has launched a euro-denominated stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nThis is a massive endorsement for the layer-one blockchain, given that it suggests that major financial institutions and enterprises are likelier to put their trust in Ethereum than in any of its rivals.\n\nJust as importantly, the recent Shanghai update has strengthened Ethereum\u2019s fundamentals even further, making it possible to withdraw staked ETH and thereby making staking more attractive to any investors who want to earn a passive income.\n\nSome analysts have forecast that the platform\u2019s staking rate (in terms of the overall supply of ETH) will rise somewhere close to 60%, meaning that a substantial amount of ETH could be taken out of circulation.\n\n1. The current staking rate of #Ethereum is about 15%, and the average staking rate of other PoS blockchains reaches to 60%. Given such condition, the staking rate of #Ethereum still has plenty of room for improvement. \u2014 0xjerome (@jerome_wong99) March 26, 2023\n\nGiven such a reduction in the supply of ETH, the coin could see steady price increases as the year progresses, returning to $2,000 in the next few months before potentially hitting $3,000 by the start of 2024.\n\nBuy Ethereum Now\n\nLove Hate Inu Offers Its Own Strong Fundamentals\n\nGiven that Ethereum seems to be going through a pronounced dip at the moment, traders looking for sizeable short-term gains may prefer to look at other high-potential tokens with strong fundamentals.\n\nOne of the most interesting of these is Love Hate Inu, a decentralized polling platform that will reward users with its LHINU token for participating in a range of surveys.\n\nIt opened the LHINU presale around a month ago, and it has already raised just over $6.7 million, making it one of the biggest token offerings happening right now.\n\n\ud83c\udf05Good morning #LoveHateInu Gang!

        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction as $9 Billion Trading Volume Comes In \u2013 Can ETH Overtake Bitcoin?\n\nSource: TradingView\n\nThe Ethereum price has dropped by 1% in the past 24 hours, amid a 1.5% decline for the cryptocurrency market as a whole. At $1,649, it has barely changed after a week and is up by 6% in the last 30 days, with the biggest altcoin also rising by 38% since the start of the year.\n\nWhile ETH is down today, there are various good reasons to expect it to rally soon. Because not only does it continue to be the biggest layer-one network by total value locked in and apps, but Coinbase has just announced its own layer-two sidechain for Ethereum, something which will undoubtedly boost usage of the latter.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction as $9 Billion Trading Volume Comes In \u2013 Can ETH Overtake Bitcoin?\n\nETH\u2019s chart reveals that, despite bullish news, the altcoin is down probably because it was due a fall, as suggested by its technical indicators. For example, its relative strength index (purple) had spent much of January above 70, and have now begun slipping down this month, while falling close to 50 in the past few days.\n\nSource: TradingView\n\nAt the same time, ETH\u2019s 30-day moving (red) has peaked in relation to its 200-day average (blue). Again, this suggests that it may be due a few more losses before it can begin rising again.\n\nHowever, so far, ETH has stuck to its support level of $1,600. It hasn\u2019t fallen below this price since the beginning of the month, and it\u2019s this author\u2019s view that it\u2019s unlikely to do so anytime soon.\n\nThere are various reasons for this view, with Coinbase\u2019s announcement of Base, its layer-two solution for Ethereum, being massively bullish for ETH.\n\n1/ \ud83d\udd35 We\u2019re excited to announce @BuildOnBase.\n\n\n\nBase is an Ethereum L2 that offers a secure, low-cost, developer-friendly way for anyone, anywhere, to build decentralized apps.\n\n\n\nOur goal with Base is to make onchain the next online and onboard 1B+ users into the cryptoeconomy. pic.twitter.com/RmwZFJzGGs \u2014 Coinbase \ud83d\udee1\ufe0f\ud83d\udcde (@coinbase) February 23, 2023\n\nFor instance, Coinbase has declared that its aim for Base is to \u201conboard 1B+ users into the cryptoeconomy.\u201d This effectively means onboarding one billion or more users into the Ethereum ecosystem, since Ethereum will obviously be the underlying settlement layer for Base.\n\nAs such, Ethereum is only going to experience growing usage in the coming months and years. And with it, there will be greater demand for ETH, which implies a rising price.\n\nJust as importantly, Ethereum was going to experience growing usage and adoption anyway over the next few years, given its shift to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism in September. This shift has provided the technological foundations for it to become more efficient and scalable, something which will enable it to build on its dominant position even further.\n\nIndeed, Ethereum currently accounts for 58% of the total value locked in of the entire cryptocurrency sector, and this position was secured during the time when the network was a proof-of-work blockchain. In other words, it can only become more dominant from here on out.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not only Coinbase that\u2019s throwing its weight behind Ethereum, but even bigger corporations as well. This includes Visa, which, aside from being a supporter of Ethereum in general, revealed earlier this month that it\u2019s testing USDC stablecoin payments on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nVisa has been testing how to do large settlements using $usdc on #ethereum. #crypto is going to be an everyday part of everyone's lives soon. Get ready. \u2014 Lark Davis (@TheCryptoLark) February 6, 2023\n\nThis all points to the growing usage of Ethereum over time. Meanwhile, in the short term, Ethereum is gearing up for the Shanghai update, which will enable the withdrawal of staked ETH.\n\nShanghai marks the completion of Ethereum\u2019s shift to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, given that it enables stakers to withdraw their rewards. For this reason, it could encourage more people to engage in staking, seeing as how they\u2019ll know they\u2019ll be able to withdraw at any time.\n\nAs a whole, such growth really paints a bullish picture for ETH, with some analysts predicting that the altcoin is likely to experience higher returns that Bitcoin (BTC) this year.\n\nBitcoin crosses series; Ethereum may be top candidate to continue outperforming the first born crypto \u2013#Ethereum's advances vs. #Bitcoin have been unshaken by 2022 deflation in most risk assets and may be gaining underpinnings. pic.twitter.com/mLRMO4vpQr \u2014 Mike McGlone (@mikemcglone11) December 20, 2022\n\nIndeed, ETH could easily rise to $1,700 in the next few weeks or even days. After that, the completion of the Shanghai update could push it up to $1,800 or even higher, with ETH possibly reaching $2,000 again by the middle of 2023.\n\nWhile such increases will depend on a recovering market and global economy, it\u2019s worth remembering that ETH\u2019s tokenomics lend themselves to greater price appreciation. For example, EIP 1559 and other updates have given ETH a tendency to become deflationary during periods of higher network activity, in that more ETH ends up being burned than issued.\n\n#Bitcoin and #Ethereum remain in early adoption days, with increasing demand vs. declining supply and related price implications. Our bias is why complicate it \u2014 unless something unlikely reverses the proliferation of the nascent technology, prices should rise over time. pic.twitter.com/SAgqWrfIMV \u2014 Mike McGlone (@mikemcglone11) January 29, 2022\n\nAnd given the likely growth of staking, there remains a very good probability that ETH will experience a contraction of supply that will heighten price rises. As a result, 2023 could be a very good year for the biggest altcoin in the market.\n\nBuy Ethereum Now\n\nAlternatives to Ethereum\n\nWhile ETH is hugely undervalued right now, it may not see a really big rally for several months. Consequently, we\u2019ve taken a look at other high-potential coins and put together a list the top 15 cryptocurrencies for 2023, as analyzed by the CryptoNews Industry Talk team.\n\n\n\nThe list is updated weekly with new altcoins and ICO projects, so be sure to check back for new entries.\n\nDisclaimer: The Industry Talk section features insights by crypto industry players and is not a part of the editorial content of Cryptonews.com.\n\n\n\nRelated:\n\n-Ethereum Price Can Hit $3,000 This Month, and Ecoterra Can Raise $3 Million \u2013 Time to Buy?"

        "title": "Ethereum Price Prediction: After the Merge Can ETH Reclaim $1,500 Soon? - Cryptonews",
        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction: After the Merge Can ETH Reclaim $1,500 Soon?\n\nThe Ethereum blockchain has just undergone the most significant upgrade in its history. However, while many market players expected the price of ETH to skyrocket following the Merge, things haven\u2019t quite gone as planned.\n\nWhat lies ahead for the world\u2019s second most valuable cryptocurrency?\n\nThe Merge: An Industry-Wide Positive Development\n\nThe Merge, as previously stated, is the final step in Ethereum\u2019s transition to proof-of-stake (PoS). The project has been in the works for at least three years, and the Ethereum Foundation has emphasized its importance to the blockchain.\n\nBecause of this change, the Ethereum blockchain is expected to improve on several fronts \u2013 including the full implementation of ETH staking and carbon neutrality. According to some estimates, it could help to reduce the blockchain\u2019s overall carbon footprint by up to 99.9%. The Ethereum Foundation is also expected to make some upgrades to the blockchain regarding transaction speed, although those upgrades might not come until 2023 or 2024.\n\nJUST IN: #Polygon says #Ethereum\u2019s merge to proof-of-stake will cancel out 99.91% of its network carbon emissions. \u2014 Watcher.Guru (@WatcherGuru) September 6, 2022\n\nThe Ethereum blockchain will be better suited to support the thousands of decentralized applications (dApps) running on it as it becomes more scalable. At the same time, many developers who abandoned Ethereum or chose one of the \u201cEthereum killers\u201d due to scalability issues with the blockchain would be incentivized to return.\n\nThis means that the value of ETH should skyrocket \u2013 at least in the long run. In fact, there is some talk about ETH eventually flipping Bitcoin (BTC) \u2013 the asset that has continued to lead it in terms of market cap. As the Ethereum blockchain grows to enjoy more global dominance, the prospects of ETH overtaking BTC seems more realistic.\n\nPost-Merge Price Underwhelms the Market\n\nUnfortunately, while the Ethereum Merge has been a huge success in terms of development, ETH investors have been underwhelmed by the slump in prices. The value of ETH has dropped by 7.25% in the 24 hours since the Merge was implemented. The asset\u2019s relative strength (RSI) of 40.14 demonstrates that it is still underbought, indicating that investors are not currently incentivized to purchase the asset.\n\nThe drop in the price of ETH is consistent with the overall market, which is down by 2.61%. ETH, like other large-cap coins, has been steadily declining.\n\nThe market appears to be still heavily influenced by macroeconomic factors. The US Federal Reserve published data on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) this week, a key metric for measuring inflation. While the market expected a drop in the numbers, published data showed that headline inflation in the country increased by 0.1% month on month in August. Moreover, despite the drop in gas prices and the slowing of the housing market, core inflation increased by 0.6% month-over-month and 8.3% year-over-year (YoY).\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted 2.6% after the CPI figures were revealed due to the worse-than-expected results. S&P 500 and NASDAQ Indexes both had 2.9% and 3.6% declines, respectively. Coin values have also decreased due to the cryptocurrency market\u2019s close ties to the conventional stock market.\n\nETH Price Forecast: What Happens Next?\n\nThe drop in the price of ETH is consistent with the overall market, which is down by 2.61%. ETH, like other large-cap coins, has been steadily declining.\n\nAlthough there are no metrics for the Ethereum blockchain\u2019s performance since the Merge, early indications are promising. We anticipate that the blockchain will improve significantly in terms of performance over time. This should encourage more developers and dApp users to purchase ETH and use it to settle transactions.\n\nIn addition, an improvement in the market, which is expected soon, should help boost the ETH price. As a large-cap coin, ETH should be one of the biggest beneficiaries when the market turns bullish. It now has another catalyst to help boost its price. Overall, $1,500 appears to be a good starting point, especially in the long run.\n\nConclusion\n\nOnce the market downturn is over, the price of Ethereum is expected to surge. The asset remains one of the most valuable in the market, and fundamentals derived from the Merge should drive its price even higher.\n\nHowever, ETH isn\u2019t the only asset available to value-seeking investors. Tamadoge (TAMA) is currently one of the most exciting crypto presales, with many predicting it to be the next big thing in blockchain gaming. Its developers have already raised over $17 million through a presale, and the platform\u2019s final features are scheduled to be released in Q4 2022.\n\nVisit Tamadoge Now"

        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction as Bulls Target 30% Move \u2013 Pump Incoming?\n\nThe Ethereum price is currently in the red, along with the wider crypto markets, as the market continues to deal with the knock-on effects of the FTX collapse. However, recent price action suggests that bulls are looking for a 30% move to the upside.\n\nBinance and FTX\u2019s SBF to Face House Committee\n\nThe House Financial Services Committee has called upon Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) and Binance to appear before it in December amid investigations into what caused the demise of one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nRep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), the chair of the House Financial Services Committee and Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.), a renowned member of the Financial Services Committee, hinted on Wednesday that the hearing would seek to determine what triggered the sudden implosion of FTX, and related firm Alameda among others. The House Committee will also look to unearth the \u201cbroader consequences for the digital asset ecosystem.\u201d The official statement reads,\n\n\u201cThe fall of FTX has posed tremendous harm to over one million users, many of whom were everyday people who invested their hard-earned savings into the FTX cryptocurrency exchange, only to watch it all disappear within a matter of seconds,\u201d\n\nBinance, the largest exchange by daily traded volume, will also be grilled by the House Committee. Questions are arising about whether Binance contributed to the liquidity crisis at FTX when it announced via Twitter the decision to liquidate up to $580 million in FTT (the token native of FTX).\n\nThe United States and Bahamas authorities have launched investigations into FTX and related companies for the part they could have played in one of the crypto market\u2019s worst crashes that saw investors lose billions of dollars.\n\nEthereum Prediction: ETH bleeds, but for how long?\n\nThe Ethereum price exchanges hands at $1,212 after bowing to selling pressure at $1,350. The push for support at $1,070 followed the newly announced Industry Recovery Fund by Binance. Investors welcome the move by Changpeng Zhao (CZ) to help businesses negatively impacted by the FTX implosion.\n\nThe Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator reveals that the bears are currently in control, as seen by the back-to-back red bars.\n\nETH/USD daily chart\n\nThere is huge support for Ethereum at $1,200. If ETH reaches there, sidelined investors may jump in, pushing prices up 30% toward $1,600 if market conditions improve.\n\nEthereum Is in The Buy Zone, On-chain Analysis Shows\n\nAccording to the Market Value Realized Value (MVRV) profit/loss model by Santiment, the second-largest cryptocurrency is back in the buy zone. The MVRV has a reading of -5.73, significantly below the mean line at 1.\n\nInvestors consider crypto assets undervalued when the ratio falls into the negative region.\n\nEthereum MVRV ratio | Santiment\n\nThe MVRV model tracks the profit/loss of the holders of ETH by comparing the price at which the tokens they hold move last with their current market value. Readings above 1 imply the asset is overvalued, thus prompting selling activities among investors.\n\nThe Supply Distribution metric shows that some investors are already buying the lower-priced Ether. The chart below shows the number of addresses holding between 10,000 and 100,000 ETH coins has grown to 1,182 from a monthly low of 1,152. It may be the case that investors who sold Ethereum as the FTX crash wrecked the market are now buying back the same tokens.\n\nEthereum Supply Distribution\n\nEthereum Alternative Offering Quicker Gains\n\nTraders who are looking for quicker gains have started looking into presales which have done particularly well this year, despite the bear market. One of the leading presales has been outlined below.\n\nDash 2 Trade (D2T)\n\nDash 2 Trade is a world-class crypto analytics and social trading platform, making it easier for investors to make informed decisions using actionable market data.

Traders monitor ETHBTC to gauge the strength of Ethereum against the benchmark cryptocurrency, Bitcoin.\n\nThe last time this ratio dipped below 0.049 was prior to May 2021.\n\nOver the past week, Bitcoin has gained nearly 20% to reach a new yearly peak of $35,157 on Coinbase, likely due to optimism around Bitcoin ETF approval in the US.\n\nStay ahead of the game with our weekly newsletters Subscribe\n\nOn the other hand, Ethereum\u2019s price had a more modest increase of 13.4% during the same period. The asset was last trading 15% lower from its 2023 peak of $2,140.\n\nBitcoin and Solana-based investment products saw inflows of around $112 million and $43 million, respectively, compared to $4.7 million in outflows from Ethereum-based funds this month to date, per a report from digital asset management firm CoinShares published on Monday.\n\nIn fact, Ethereum has experienced the highest outflows this year, totaling $119 million, followed by Tron, per the CoinShares\u2019 report.\n\nJames Butterfill, the head of research at CoinShares, attributed the positive flows in Bitcoin to \u201canticipation of a spot Bitcoin ETF\u201d and \u201ccontinued concerns over Ethereum.\u201d\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nRecently, the market has grown hopeful around an approval by the US securities regulator in light of the recent court victory by Grayscale over a previous rejection and a flurry of applications for Bitcoin spot ETF by traditional finance heavyweights such as BlackRock, Fidelity, and Ark Invest.\n\nBitfinex analysts told DL News that the \u201cprimary bullish narrative for the market has been ETF products\u201d while Ethereum has lacked a \u201ccompelling long-term narrative.\u201d\n\nThey added \u201cevery bullish narrative for Ethereum has resulted in less significant spikes for the Bitcoin-Ethereum ratio.\u201d\n\nBenjamin Jarvis, co-founder of analytics outlet JLabs Digital told DL News that, \u201cInstitutions might feel more comfortable investing in a Bitcoin spot ETF because they perceive it as less risky compared to Ethereum futures.\u201d\n\nEarlier this month, six Ethereum-futures-based ETFs launched in the US. However, their opening trading was sluggish, and they haven\u2019t garnered significant demand since their introduction.\n\nMoreover, the Bitfinex analysts added that \u201cwe are in the early phases of a bull market where it is normal for Bitcoin to move up first and then allow a rotation of capital as investors search for lagging beta plays\u201d like Ethereum.\n\nConcerns over Ethereum\n\nCoinShares analyst Luke Nolan discussed various concerns related to Ethereum staking and its implications for the network in a recent report.\n\nEthereum staking refers to securing the network\u2019s proof-of-stake consensus mechanism by depositing Ether into the staking contract and earning rewards in return.\n\nNolan raised centralisation concerns over Lido, the leading liquid staking derivative platform on Ethereum, which commands a dominant share of 31.5% of all the staked Ether, or 8.7 million Ether\u2014 worth $15.6 billion \u2014 per a Dune dashboard by Hildobby, the pseudonymous head of data at crypto venture fund Dragonfly.\n\nHe also addressed the concern of the growing number of validators. More validators mean more load on the existing validators, which can impact the network\u2019s performance and require significant hardware upgrades.\n\nAn increase in the number of validators also reduces the yields for individual validators, which can lead to an exodus of Ether stakers.\n\nAdditionally, Nolan suggested the possibility of an \u201cuntested economic regime\u201d where the staked Ether market cap becomes larger than the unstaked Ether market cap, which could raise unfounded risk.\n\nLastly, the recent drop in fees and Ethereum turning inflationary also contribute to the lack of demand.\n\nEthereum\u2019s supply has grown at a rate equivalent to 0.37% per annum over the last 30 days as the staking rewards exceeded the amount of Ether burnt in transaction fees, according to Ethereum data tracker ultra sound money.\n\nCorrection: The article has been updated to reflect that 8.7 million Ether was staked via Lido."

        "title": "Bitcoin Could Get Ethereum-Style Smart Contracts Under 'BitVM' Plan - CoinDesk",
        "content": "The protocol is presented by Garand Fill today with Algo Kit. Welcome back to first mover. Our next guest is out with a recent white paper that outlines a new paradigm to bring Ethereum style smart contracts to the Bitcoin network. Joining us now is zero sync co-founder Robin Linus Robin. Welcome to the show. Hi, thanks for having me. All right. Talk to us about this white paper in it. You know that bit VM is a computing paradigm to express turn complete Bitcoin contracts. Explain to us what's going on here and what the real world problem is that we're solving. Well, the very high level rework problem that we are solving is Bitcoin scalability. Um Yeah, we would love to scale Bitcoin to millions of transactions per second. And currently that's not possible on the main layer unfortunately. And yeah, if we had more expressive smart contracting capabilities on Bitcoin, um we could bridge Bitcoin to like side chain systems or other feature-rich systems such that we can uh essentially scale BT C transactions more or less indefinitely. Uh So this is not the first proposal for smart contracts on Bitcoin correct on the Bitcoin network. So what makes this different than any, anything else that's out there right now. Mm So the scripting capabilities of Bitcoin, they are quite limited. Um It's not a very feature-rich platform in comparison to let's say Ethereum or other smart contracting platforms that we know. And um yeah, actually Bitcoin script is intentionally limited to reduce the attack surface of Bitcoin. And um what BIT BM does, it's uh it's kind of like hacking around these limitations. It's like uh a compilation of a couple tricks that allow you to uh overcome the limitations of Bitcoin script. And yeah, to express more uh expressive smart contracts on Bitcoin. OK. But in terms of what, what's out there right now, what's the difference? Um Yeah, you can express more stuff than you, you were used to like um in Bitcoin script, you can mostly express stuff like multi signatures, maybe also hash logs and um the basic stuff that enables also lightning and stuff like that. But um you cannot, for example, bridge Bitcoin to a side chain that is not possible today. Um But BIT VM might enable that. And, and how do you see it differing from what's available on the Ethereum chain right now? When, when, when you, if this were to to be launched, uh what, what kind of structure makes it either comparable, better or worse if you will uh than what's, what's on Ethereum. Um Yeah, Ethereum is designed to facilitate this smart contracts and Bitcoin is not um what we are doing here is um we are, we are, we are applying tricks to mimic what Ethereum is doing. So, uh in the end, it will not be quite as expressive as Ethereum is. Um however, these bridges uh they can enable or like they, they can allow you to bridge Bitcoin to a side chain and that side chain could run essentially the same code as assume and then you could have essentially um yeah, BT C in uh the EBM in, in, in the same smart contracting machine as on a theory, what would be the need for doing it on Bitcoin and not on Ethereum? Yeah. Well, Bitcoin is a hard asset. Bitcoin is hard to change and Bitcoin is by far the number one asset in the world, it's the strongest brand and it's uh the currency that we all love, I think. And that's why we should do it with B BT C and with it, what are some of the potential applications you see here that would be better run in the Bitcoin ecosystem than the Ethereum? One of course, um you mentioned a bunch of problems that you're trying to solve that exist in the Ethereum network. Of course, layer twos have solved, solved some of the issues that you're trying to solve. What are some of the potential applications that might attract developers and users to Bitcoin versus Ethereum? Yeah, I'm personally mostly interested into scalability um uh I wanna see Bitcoin scaling to, as I said, a million transactions per second. And um yeah, I think that would be great to uh see Bitcoin being used as a currency for, yeah, daily, daily life payments and uh for basically any kinds of payments. And uh it would be great if we could um process that many transactions. And are there any limitations here with uh bit VM that you anticipate? Oh yeah, it's, as I said, it's like that's uh it's piling tricks on top of each other to mimic what Ethereum is doing. And um one thing that is very different than the EVM is that um in, in BVM, you always need a verifier. Um So there is like some party doing this, this pack doing this bridge and then there is um there could be like hundreds of very fires and um all of them, they are uh surveilling uh the uh the person that is facilitating the bridge and they are verifying that um they stay honest and if they don't stay honest, then the verifier can punish um the bridge. So this is a white paper. How, how long do you think it would take to get it uh on the ground? Um Yeah, we are developing um the first version of it. Hopefully, hopefully by the end of this week we have like something that's like very early uh like uh like developers can, can start playing around with um there won't be anything that uh will be usable by, by, by regular people. But um yeah, we, we hope we can get something into the hands of, of developers who uh I really want to go into the nitty gritty and like uh check out all the details of how it works under the hood. And um yeah, from there, we will advance it as, as quickly as possible. Many people are excited about it, many people are supporting it. Uh Many people are contributing ideas and uh also code and um yeah, hopefully by the end of the year, we will see the first experimental use cases. Robin, thank you very much for joining us and unpacking your white paper. We look forward to seeing some of those use cases by the end of the year. Thanks a lot for having me. That was Euro Zinc co-founder, Robin Linus."

        "title": "Ethereum Merge Buyers Turn Into Sellers as Trouble-free Upgrade Underwhelms - Cryptonews",
        "content": "Ethereum Merge Buyers Turn Into Sellers as Trouble-free Upgrade Underwhelms\n\nThe price of Ethereum has fallen by 1% in the past hour and by the same percentage in the past day, with the now-completed Merge failing to spark a bull market as some had anticipated.\n\nETH had increased to as much as $2,000 in mid-August as investors became excited about the second-biggest cryptocurrency becoming deflationary \u2013 yet aside from a mini-rally to $1,780 over the weekend, the price action has been disappointing.\n\nUnfortunately for Ethereum and its holders, the Merge has happened in the wake of yet another downturn in global stock markets and the cryptocurrency market. Once again, the cause of this dip was the release of disappointing inflation figures for the United States, signalling that the Federal Reserve will hike interest rates yet again.\n\nHowever, if Ethereum\u2019s supporters are the believe, it\u2019s only a matter of time before the shift to proof-of-stake bears dividends for ETH holders. Because with a drop in daily issuance, as well as an increase staking and token burns, ETH\u2019s supply will eventually end up being squeezed to the point of pushing up its price.\n\nNo Bull Rally for Ethereum\u2019s Merge Day\n\nPrior to the Merge, ETH had enjoyed better price action than BTC, largely because investors had hopped onto it in the hope that it would see big gains following the move to Proof-of-Stake (PoS).\n\nFor example, CoinMarketCap data reveals that the price of Ethereum has increased by 18% in the past 60 days and by 45% in the past 90, in contrast to -5% and -4% for BTC (over the same timeframes). Such rises can likely be explained as the market \u2018pricing in\u2019 the Merge, implying that the expected short-term gains from the move to PoS had happened some time before today.\n\nYou still have time to sell $ETH below $2,000. \u2014 Soy Shills (@Soy_Shills) September 13, 2022\n\nIndeed, today is likely to be disappointing for anyone who bought ETH over the weekend, hoping that it would rise to $2,000 or beyond. Instead, it has dropped to $1,592 as of writing, representing a drop of 10.5% from its seven-day high of $1,780 (set on Sunday).\n\nFor many observers, this decline makes the Merge a paradigmatic example of a \u2018buy the rumour, sell the news\u2019 event. In other words, traders hungry for quick gains should have jumped on the bandwagon a little sooner.\n\nThe merge was and is a buy the rumor sell the news event.\n\n\n\nIf you think about it, nothing really changes after the merge. It\u2019s just narratives.\n\n\n\nThe fundamental changes to #ETH will take months to manifest in the price.\n\n\n\nCome back in six months. \u2014 Duo Nine \u26a1 YCC (@DU09BTC) September 15, 2022\n\nAs the tweet above argues, the lack of a Merge-day bounce shouldn\u2019t really be surprising. Yes, Ethereum has slashed its energy consumption by 99% today, but in terms of performance gains, adoption or circulating supply, nothing has really changed compared to yesterday.\n\nAnd when you add the fact that, say, the Dow Jones had its worst day since July 2020 on Tuesday (losing 1,200 points) because of inflation data, it\u2019s also hardly a shock that traders and investors aren\u2019t flooding into ETH at the moment.\n\nPlaying the Long Game\n\nThis means that serious traders really should learn some patience and invest in ETH for the longer term. Because according to projections, the supply of ETH relative to its demand will drop substantially over time.\n\nFor instance, the end of mining rewards will on its own result in a 90% fall in the issuance of new ETH. When coupled with an increase in staked ETH (which will remain locked up for the foreseeable future) and token burns of the EIP-1559 upgrade from last year, the market could see ETH become deflationary sooner or later.\n\nAnd it\u2019s also important to note that, even before the Merge, Ethereum was by far and away the biggest layer-one blockchain in terms of total value locked in. Once it begins building on the foundations set by the Merge by introducing scaling improvements, it will likely become even bigger, as efficiency gains attract more adoption.\n\nIn turn, this will result in more demand for ETH and an increasingly rising price. Just don\u2019t expect it to happen all at once."

        "content": "Elena is an expert in technical analysis and risk management in cryptocurrency market. She has 10+year experience in writing - accordingly she is avid journalists with a passion towards researching new insights coming into crypto erena.\n\nCryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, experienced an upswing on Monday as the recent bullish trend in the crypto market extended through the weekend. The prospect of a potential approval for a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States added to the positive momentum, resulting in interest from investors.\n\nBitcoin maintained its upward trajectory, climbing over 3% and hovering around the $31,000 mark. Meanwhile, Ethereum also recorded a similar gain with a more than 3% increase, approaching the $1,700 level. Many other altcoins also saw gains.\n\nAccording to analyst Rekt Capital, breaking past the critical resistance level of approximately $31,000 is the last step in negating a bearish Bitcoin pattern. Should it reclaim this level as support or achieve a weekly close above it, this would likely confirm a breakout from the current trading range.\n\nHowever, until that happens, there remains a possibility of a pullback to around the $27,000 level. It\u2019s interesting to note that, historically, Bitcoin retraced around -25% in 2015 and -38% in 2019 during similar points in its market cycle, less than 190 days before the Halving event.\n\nCrypto Tony, another market analyst, highlighted the cyclical nature of the cryptocurrency market, noting that Bitcoin tends to lead the way with liquidity moving in its direction. This explains the drop in the Ethereum-to-Bitcoin ratio as investors divert their funds towards Bitcoin.\n\nRegarding Ethereum, he stressed the significance of breaking above the $1,745 price level. In terms of Bitcoin, he expects a level of resistance and a minor pullback at around the range highs of $31,500. This point is where bears may challenge the bullish momentum."

        "content": "Why Ethereum Price Will be Propelled Higher by Growing Institutional Interest \u2013 ETH to $4k in 2023?\n\nThe price of Ether continued to rise this week, but the gains were short-lived as ETH fell lower quickly to $1,510. ETH/USD is now trading at $1,528.12 which is down by 3% in 24 hours and has been increasing by 10% in the past week.\n\nEthereum Soulbound Web3 Identification Protocol Announcement\n\nAccording to a press release on January 17, Masa Finance, the first Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), has announced the first soulbound identification protocol for the Ethereum mainnet. The platform will facilitate the creation of standard soulbound tokens for Know Your Customer (KYC) verification, credit ratings, and other use cases on Ethereum.\n\nMoreover, the mainnet launch of Masa Soulbound Identity requires the development of an on-chain Soulbound Token protocol and the design of such a protocol to improve the Web3 ecosystem.\n\nAccording to a press release from Masa\u2019s co-founder Brendan Playford, identification should be as easy for users to create as an NFT and for developers to deploy as an ERC-20 smart contract.\n\nIt\u2019s official, the Masa #Mainnet is live! \ud83d\ude80\n\n\n\nPublic access is now open \ud83d\udc8e\n\nAll are welcome to #mint their Masa Soul Name #NFTs\n\n\n\nClaim your rare \ud83d\udc7b.soul names before they're taken!\n\n\n\nMint is live here: https://t.co/e0WCypZBrS pic.twitter.com/m6C6hAoTqR \u2014 Masa (@getmasafi) January 17, 2023\n\nThe project that is offering this new protocol will allow you to develop tokens on Ethereum or all ERC-20 tokens. This could, in turn, be very beneficial for all Ethereum users and there are many benefits including price stability and much more.\n\nShanghai Update\n\nAt the time of writing, the number of Ethereum (ETH) validators was 502,636, according to BeaconScan statistics. It fueled excitement for the next update. For the Shanghai upgrade, a hard fork scheduled to occur in March 2023, Ethereum developers set up a new testing network on January 11, and the new testing environment for developers is known as devnet 2.\n\nThis week, #ethereum surpassed a historic milestone of having 500,000 validators. Congratulations, everyone! Now it\u2019s time to get ready for another historical event, the Shanghai hard fork.

The upgrade launches the \u201cSurge\u201d phase of the ETH cycle, which attempts to enhance the infrastructure and scalability of the network.\n\nAhead of the Shanghai upgrade, Ethereum has reached a big milestone: 500,000 validators. \u2014 Metav3rse (@themetav3rse) January 16, 2023\n\nThe Ethereum team reached the milestone of implementing the Shanghai hard fork on time. This announcement comes after developers completed a January 9, 2023, upgrade of Ethereum\u2019s code. The announcement states that Ethereum withdrawals will continue without interruption.\n\nAs of the planned Shanghai update, traders who have ETH holdings can unstake those coins and send them to the Beacon Chain. The potential increase in demand for Ethereum on exchanges may cause another price hike for Ether.\n\nGrowing Institutional Interest\n\nOn January 19, Matt Hougan, CIO of Bitwise Asset Management, stated in an interview that institutional interest in ETH staking rose after the \u2018Merge\u2019.\n\nStaking is a method of receiving incentives for holding a particular token (in this case, ETH) for a specific period. People stake their ETH for the network\u2019s security and get rewards with yield or further compensations.\n\nWe may have entered a new bullish cycle in crypto, says @Matt_Hougan of crypto asset management firm Bitwise Asset Management @BitwiseInvest. #BTC pic.twitter.com/hpSNXINufI \u2014 CNBC International (@CNBCi) January 13, 2023\n\nAdditionally, a recent survey found that many institutional investors were considering purchasing Ethereum and other alternative currencies.\n\nThe growing technological development of cryptocurrencies and improvements in the ecosystem has had a significant influence on institutional adoption. Moreover, institutional interest in ETH staking could benefit ETH/USD\n\nEthereum Price\n\nThe live Ethereum price today is $1,547.41 with a 24-hour trading volume of $6.7 billion. The current CoinMarketCap ranking is 2, with a live market cap of $189 billion.\n\nThe ETH/USD pair bounced off the $1,510 mark, a 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level, and is now heading north toward the next resistance level of $1,610. On the 4-hour timeframe, the 50-day moving average is also supporting the Ethereum price near $1,510.\n\nThe leading technical indicators such as the RSI and MACD indicators suggest divergence, such as the RSI is in a buying zone, while MACD is still under 0, in a bearish zone\n\nEthereum Price Chart \u2013 Source: Tradingview\n\nIf $1,500 breaks, Ethereum is likely to plunge to the low point that\u2019s set at $1,440 based on its 38.2% Fibonacci retracement. If the drop in ETH continues, $1,350 could be broken and the dollar value could hit a difficult place\n\nThe $1,500 support level is quite likely to cause a net increase in the market price at $1,660, with it serving as a resistance level.\n\nInvesting in alternative coins before they\u2019re publicly acquired or when they are at their pre-sale stage can be a very rewarding experience. Here\u2019s some details you need to know about MEMAG.\n\nMeta Masters Guild (MEMAG)\n\nThe Meta Masters Guild has seen tremendous growth, rising from $200,000 to a whopping $684,906 in just a few days. This phenomenal rise suggests that the public has placed a high level of trust in the company\u2019s future expansion and profit-generating ability.\n\nMeta Masters Guild will release its first mobile game in Q3 2023. MEMAG, their own cryptocurrency, enables users to exercise governance rights, engage in staking activities, and buy items and NFTs on the network.\n\nIn addition, they intend to develop play-to-earn and Web3 games to provide even more interesting gaming experiences.\n\nEarly investors have a limited window of opportunity to participate in the MEMAG sale, which presently provides 1 MEMAG for $0.01!\n\nHowever, this price is projected to rise in less than two weeks, so interested purchasers should act soon if they want to get the currency at the lowest possible price.

        "content": "Ethereum Steps on Another Delay Bomb\n\nSource: Adobe/paintermaster\n\nEthereum (ETH) developers have decided to once again delay the \u201cdifficulty bomb,\u201d a special code in Ethereum that eventually makes it impossible to mine ETH tokens, by another two months.\n\nCore Ethereum developers met on Friday and discussed Ethereum\u2019s Ropsten public testnet. After discussing some bugs revealed by the testnet, the devs voted in support of a proposal, dubbed EIP-5133, which delays the difficulty bomb to August 2022.\n\n\u201cIn short, we agreed to the bomb delay,\u201d said lead developer Tim Beiko. \u201cWe were already over time, and want to be sure that we sanity check all the numbers before selecting an exact delay and deployment time, but we are aiming for a ~2 month delay, and for the upgrade to go live late June.\u201d\n\nAgain, we were already over time here, so we want to sanity check the numbers async, which should happen over the next few days. Realistically, we'll have client releases and a proper announcement out by the next of next week. \u2014 timbeiko.eth \u2600\ufe0f (@TimBeiko) June 10, 2022\n\nThe \u201cdifficulty bomb\u201d refers to the intentional and sudden increase in Ethereum\u2019s mining difficulty that will occur when ETH 2.0 update is released. Once activated, the difficulty bomb will substantially increase mining difficulty, thus making it impossible to mine a new block on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nBeiko added that the delay would allow developers to \u201ckeep a strong focus on The Merge,\u201d when the current Ethereum Mainnet will merge with the beacon chain proof-of-stake (PoS) system.\n\nBen Edgington, another core developer, said he hopes the delay in the difficulty bomb would not affect The Merge. \u201cWe say it won\u2019t delay The Merge. I sincerely hope not,\u201d he said.\n\nI'm happy to confirm that we have no intention of screwing it up. Just in case anyone out there thinks it needs saying \ud83d\ude42 \u2014 Ben Edgington (@benjaminion_xyz) June 10, 2022\n\nAccording to the recently proposed EIP-5133 proposal, the target for The Merge is \u201cbefore mid-August 2022.\u201d\n\nNotably, Ethereum developers have not firmly committed to a date for The Merge.\n\nIn early April, after the developers completed Ethereum\u2019s first mainnet shadow fork, Beiko said The Merge will not be completed in June. \u201cIt won\u2019t be June, but likely in [a] few months after. No firm date yet, but we\u2019re definitely in the final chapter of on Ethereum,\u201d Beiko said at the time.\n\nAt 07:19 UTC, ETH traded at USD 1,330 and was down almost 9% in a day and 26% in a week, as other top 10 coins were also down 5%-12% in a day.\n\n____\n\nLearn more:\n\n\u2013 Ethereum Beacon Chain Experienced a 7-block Reorg, More Work Needed Ahead of The Merge\n\n\u2013 How The Ethereum Merge Could Impact Staking Yields\n\n\n\n\u2013 The Compromises and Benefits of Ethereum Switching to a Proof-of-Stake Network\n\n\u2013 Top Narratives About Ethereum and Its Merge with Its Proof-of-Stake Beacon Chain\n\n\n\n\u2013 Major Bitcoin & Crypto Companies Warn of \u2018Extreme\u2019 Risk in Proof-of-Stake Systems\n\n\u2013 Ethereum\u2019s Merge Could Lower Demand for Bitcoin but Regulatory & Technical Challenges Persist"

        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction as ETH Rallies Up From Recent Bottom \u2013 Is Now a Good Time to Buy?\n\nSource: TradingView\n\nThe price of Ethereum has declined by 1.5% in the past 24 hours, with its fall to $1,869 coming as the wider cryptocurrency market drops by roughly the same percentage today.\n\nETH is now 3% up in the past week and only 1% up in the last 30 days, although the biggest altcoin has risen by 56% since the beginning of the year.\n\nEncouragingly, ETH has also risen by 5% since last Thursday, when it declined to a two-week low of $1,775.\n\nThis suggests it may be gradually building momentum, and with the altcoin still arguably very undervalued, it could rally big in the not-too-distant future.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction as ETH Rallies Up From Recent Bottom \u2013 Is Now a Good Time to Buy?\n\nWhile ETH has dipped, this means it\u2019s now due a rebound, as signalled by its various technical indicators.\n\nSource: TradingView\n\nIts relative strength index (purple) plunged below 30 earlier today, suggesting that it has been oversold by traders and is now at a steep discount.\n\nOn the other hand, ETH\u2019s 30-day moving average (yellow) hasn\u2019t fallen below its 200-day average (blue) just yet, so a few more days of falling may be needed before it fully recovers.\n\nThat said, the coin\u2019s rising support level (green) would indicate that it won\u2019t fall too far, and that now may be the time to buy, before big gains arrive.\n\nAnd looking at Ethereum\u2019s enviably strong fundamentals, the cryptocurrency really should rally big this year.\n\nFor one, the implementation of staking has revealed considerable demand for ETH, with the introduction of withdrawals in April not actually leading to a flood of selling.\n\nIt\u2019s actually quite the opposite, seeing as how the quantity of staked ETH has increased from about 18 million in April to 21.5 million today, according to data from Dune Analytics.\n\nStaked #ETH just surpassed 18% after the upgrade! No doubt that we'll observe 20% and more very soon \ud83d\udd25 pic.twitter.com/2oQ5OKVMiT \u2014 \u27e0 Everstake (@everstake_pool) May 29, 2023\n\nThis means that approx. 18% of ETH\u2019s total circulating supply is now staked, yet what\u2019s bullish is that this percentage could rise to somewhere between 40% and 60%, judging by average staking ratios for other proof-of-stake cryptocurrencies.\n\nIn other words, substantial quantities of ETH are going to be taken out of circulation, increasing demand relative to supply and likely boosting ETH\u2019s price.\n\nOn top of this, the transition to staking (which has reduced the issuing of new tokens) and the introduction of fee burns (via EIP-1559) means that Ethereum now has tendency to deflate, depending on how busy it becomes.\n\nCan we talk about how $ETH is the biggest deflationary asset in human history? pic.twitter.com/ezLWcEoPFw \u2014 LilMoonLambo (@LilMoonLambo) May 30, 2023\n\nAgain, this will reduce the available supply of ETH, in turn squeezing its price upwards.\n\nThen there\u2019s the fact that Ethereum remains the most widely used layer-one blockchain by quite some margin, with the platform accounting for roughly 57.8% of the entire DeFi sector.\n\nThis indicates substantial adoption, and it\u2019s highly arguable that when the next bull market rolls around, Ethereum\u2019s pre-existing network effects will result in it attracting disproportionately more users than its rivals.\n\nSuch a claim is supported by how major adoption news tends to involve Ethereum, with Societe Generale launching its own euro-denominated stablecoin on Ethereum in April, and with Visa also using the platform to test USDC payments.\n\nTaken together, such pieces of news suggest that Ethereum is going to remain the dominant layer-one platform for the forseeable future, and that ETH will rise in parallel with its growth.\n\nIndeed, from ETH\u2019s current price of around $1,870, the market could expect it to reach $2,000 in the next few months, with the end of the year potentially seeing it rise as high as $2,500 or $3,000, depending on how bullish investors become.\n\nBuy Ethereum Now\n\nA High-Potential Alternative\n\nWhile Ethereum\u2019s fundamentals are very solid, its status as a well-established coin may mean that it doesn\u2019t experience too many big rallies in the future, and instead rising gradually over the longer term.\n\nAs such, traders looking for market-beating gains may also consider diversifying their portfolios to include high-potential alternatives, with a number of presale tokens currently promising to rally big when they list on exchanges in the next few months.\n\nThis includes ecoterra, an Ethereum-based recycle-to-earn platform that has raised more than $4.4 million in the presale for its ECOTERRA token.\n\n\ud83c\udf3f Big News! \ud83d\ude80\n\n\n\nEcoterra has raised $4.4 million and counting! \ud83d\ude4c\n\n\n\nJoin us in our mission to create a sustainable future and be a part of the eco-friendly revolution \ud83c\udf0d\ud83d\udc9ahttps://t.co/1fYkPOsPYG#Presale #Crypto #Sustainability #GreenRevolution pic.twitter.com/xWprOJsuw7 \u2014 ecoterra (@ecoterraio) May 30, 2023\n\nScheduled to launch in the second half of the year, Ecoterra\u2019s platform offers users the chance to receive ECOTERRA and NFTs as rewards for recycling household waste at participating recycling points.\n\nIts platform and app will also reward users for providing proof of their use of renewable energy, while it will also incorporate a carbon offset marketplace, enabling users to trade carbon credits as NFTs.\n\nSuch an ambitious ecosystem has helped ecoterra\u2019s sale attract interested investors, with the token offering currently in its seventh stage, with 1 ECOTERRA costing $0.008500.\n\nThis will rise to $0.001 by the time the sale ends in the next few weeks, although ECOTERRA\u2019s price could really surge once it lists on exchanges.\n\nVisit ecoterra Here"

        "title": "The Ethereum Premine Debate On Fairness, Regulation, and Centralization - Cryptonews",
        "content": "The Ethereum Premine Debate On Fairness, Regulation, and Centralization\n\nSource: Adobe/ilolab\n\n\u201cA pre-mine is unethical and favors some actors over others in a political fashion.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe ICO can be classified as a security offering and the ether tokens as securities.\u201d\n\nThe ETH sale was actually more open and distributed than critics claim.\n\nThe ETH camp claims that PoS doesn\u2019t favor actors with large holdings in ETH.\n\nYou may not be aware of this, but back in July 2014, Ethereum (ETH) had a premine in which around ETH 60m (worth around USD 272bn now) tokens were sold for a total of USD 18.3m, while 12m was kept aside for early contributors and the Ethereum Foundation. At ETH 72m, this total accounts for around 63.7% of Ethereum\u2019s current total supply, raising the specter of centralization, particularly as the platform transitions to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism.\n\nIndeed, for many of Ethereum\u2019s detractors, its premine is one of the key reasons why it will never be as decentralized as Bitcoin (BTC), and why it may end up being controlled by a relatively small group of people (if it isn\u2019t already). At the same time, they suggest that premine is akin to an initial coin offering (ICO), thereby putting Ethereum potentially in the line of fire of the US Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nHowever, the Ethereum community denies that the 2014 premine has any effect on the platform\u2019s decentralization, arguing that the premined ETH was distributed to thousands of people. At the same time, they argue that Ethereum\u2019s shift to PoS won\u2019t decrease its decentralization.\n\nEthereum premine = bad?\n\n\u201cA pre-mine is unethical and favors some actors over others in a political fashion. Consequently, the issues that are created are not only in the future, but also in the present and in the past,\u201d said Bitcoin author and advocate Gigi.\n\nHe suggests that one of the big issues with Ethereum\u2019s premine sale is that it risks regulatory repercussions for the platform, particularly in the event that it distributed tokens to only a relatively small number of buyers. This does appear to be the case, given data from the sale indicating that 40% of the sold total went to only 100 purchasers.\n\n\u201cMore and more people come to the conclusion that the Ethereum presale has the characteristics of an illegal security offering,\u201d he told Cryptonews.com, advising readers to study articles published by lawyer Preston Byrne and researcher Hasu in 2018 (as well as the Amy Castor piece linked to above).\n\nAnd Gigi isn\u2019t the only observer who asserts that the premine likely qualifies ETH as a security. This is also the view of Josef T\u011btek, the Trezor Brand Ambassador at SatoshiLabs.\n\n\u201cFirst, the ICO can be classified as a security offering and the ether tokens as securities. The SEC can change its previous stance on this matter, simply because the offering isn\u2019t much different from what subsequent ICOs \u2014 classified as unlicensed securities offerings \u2014 have done,\u201d he told Cryptonews.com.\n\nOn top of this, T\u011btek also notes that the premine will exacerbate problems surrounding concentration of ownership and centralization, particularly as Ethereum becomes Ethereum 2.0 at some point (next year?).\n\n\u201cSecond, the switch to the proof-of-stake system will benefit mostly those that were there for the premine and the initial sale and thus cement the power of these insiders and make Ethereum even more centralized than it is today,\u201d he said.\n\nBasically, the thinking here is that, because the Ethereum Foundation sold ETH now worth hundreds of billions to a \u2018handful\u2019 of buyers, these individuals/entities will be able to exert an undue influence over staking once Ethereum 2.0 becomes a reality.\n\n\u201cProof-of-stake leads to centralization even without any premine \u2014 already we can see staking-as-a-service offered by exchanges and other third parties [\u2026] The premine paves the way for even faster centralization, as those with most coins will further concentrate power over the network and gain on relative importance over time,\u201d said T\u011btek.\n\nEthereum premine \u2260 bad?\n\nMeanwhile, the ETH camp presents two primary counterarguments against the charges leveled above against the premine. The first involves contending that the sale was actually more open and distributed than critics claim.\n\n\u201cOver 10,000 distinct BTC addresses participated in the crowd sale, which means a large number of people were able to get exposure to Ethereum at the earliest stages. While the space has grown since and such a crowd sale would be hard to replicate, I think it was a great launch approach at the time because it allowed for a broad set of participants, many of which are still involved in the ecosystem today,\u201d said Ethereum developer Tim Beiko.\n\nIt\u2019s also arguable that, not only was the sale broad, but that ownership of ETH has widened since 2014.\n\n\u201cExcluding infrastructure wallets, such as the ETH 2.0 Deposit Contract, and exchange wallets, there are only 3 wallets in the top 10 holding what approximately amounts to be 3.3% of the total supply of ETH. Over time, the amount of ETH in the hands of people everywhere has continuously increased,\u201d said a spokesperson for ConsenSys, an ETH-focused major blockchain company.\n\nFurthermore, the ConsenSys spokesperson notes that the actual count of ethereum addresses (a person can own multiple addresses) has sharply increased since its inception, from 9,205 to 172,088,521 today.\n\nTim Beiko also disagrees with the \u2018premine\u2019 label, preferring instead to refer to the event as a crowd sale. He also disagrees that the sale threatens to weaken Ethereum\u2019s decentralization.\n\n\u201cThe crowd sale went to a large group of participants and I think there is a strong argument that this group is more diverse than early miners. Second, even if that wasn\u2019t the case, Ethereum ran on proof-of-work for ~5 years, so anyone who wanted to mine ether had ample opportunity (as well as access to several mining pools),\u201d he told Cryptonews.com.\n\nIn addition, Beiko argues that PoS doesn\u2019t favor actors with large holdings in ETH, and by extension won\u2019t result in any concentrations of ETH-based wealth from increasing.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not true that Ethereum\u2019s PoS grants \u2018more weight to actors more able to stake more ETH\u2019: the rewards are the same for every staker, and even diminish as more stakers join. There are also several things in the protocol which are meant to \u2018tilt the scale\u2019 towards smaller stakers, such as the anti-correlation penalties [see here for an explanation of such penalties],\u201d he added.\n\nThis goes some way to assuaging concerns that PoS and the 2014 sale might transform Ethereum into something comparable to the \u2018current fiat monetary system,\u2019 as more than a few critics suggest. And while it is possible for single entities (with enough ETH) to run multiple validators, the anti-correlation penalties mentioned above (among other things) may make it difficult for them to do so.\n\nSecondly, a number of people have responded that, despite initially being large, the premine will come to matter less and less over time, as more ETH is issued.\n\nNot to defend premines. I wrote a critical post about the sale here https://t.co/foTeSS8NW9 showing that all ICOs are fundamentally broken, as insiders can buy the coins for free. But the issue gets smaller over time, and I strongly doubt people in 50 years will care about it. \u2014 Hasu\u26a1\ufe0f\ud83e\udd16 (@hasufl) July 6, 2020\n\n____\n\nLearn more:\n\n\u2013 Decentralization in Crypto Is a Hard to Measure Ideal\n\n\u2013 Narratives Blur as Bitcoin and Ethereum Target Each Other\u2019s Field\n\n\u2013 The Ethereum Economy is a House of Cards\n\n\u2013 Why Ethereum is Far From \u2018Ultrasound Money\u2019"

        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction as ETH Spikes Up 10% in 7 Days \u2013 Here\u2019s Where It\u2019s Headed Next\n\nEther primed for short-term upside. Source: TradingView\n\nEthereum Up 10% in Seven Days\n\nThe price of Ethereum (or ETH), the token that powers the Ethereum blockchain network, was last up more than 10% in the last seven days. Ahead of the start of Monday\u2019s US session, ETH was last changing hands for just under $1,300 per token, up just over 2.5% in the last 24 hours and probing for a breakout to fresh near-one-month highs and a test of its 50-Day Moving Average just under $1,340.\n\nEther has rebounded about 20% in the last three weeks since forming a double bottom in the $1,080 area during November. Optimism about the US Federal Reserve slowing the pace of its monetary tightening in the coming months, with US inflation showing clear signs of having peaked, has lifted US stocks, bonds, and many commodities. This trend has been giving tailwinds to crypto in recent weeks.\n\nEther up nearly 20% in the last few weeks. Source: TradingView\n\nBut ETH still has some way to go if it is to recoup its post-FTX collapse losses. Prior to the exchange\u2019s untimely demise around this time last month, ETH/USD had been trading in the $1,550 to $1,650 area, about 20-25% above current levels. Crypto bulls will be hoping that as December progresses, Ether will recover back to these levels with the help of a \u201cSanta rally\u201d \u2013 a phenomenon where risk assets rally in the run-up to Christmas, as has historically been the case.\n\nPrice Prediction: ETH Primed For Short-term Upside\n\nEther has formed an ascending triangle in the last few weeks and looks to be on the verge of a short-term break to the upside. ETH/USD has been supported by an uptrend since the 22nd of November, but in the last few days, it has been unable to get sustainably above $1,300. Price formations such as these are often considered precursors to a bullish breakout and, as such, price predictions have been getting more bullish.\n\nEther primed for short-term upside. Source: TradingView\n\nIf ETH/USD does break to the upside, the first target will be the 50DMA at $1,334, then the 100DMA at $1,383, then the 200DMA at $1,457. If Ether can get above its 200DMA, which will be a tough ask, as the level has been a key area of technical resistance in 2022, it may be able to test the top of a downward trend channel that has been capping the price action since the summer of 2022.\n\nEther Headed Back To Summer Highs Above $2,000?\n\nCan Ether break back toward its summer 2022 highs? Source: TradingView\n\nShould Ether manage a break above this bearish trend channel, that sets the stage for a test of recent highs in the $1,600s and a potential longer-term bullish pushback towards summer\u2019s peak pre-\u201cmerge\u201d optimism highs above $2,000 Such a move is possible should macro conditions continue to improve (i.e. further moderation in the interest rate outlook) and should crypto sentiment continue to recover (i.e. Decentralized Finance starts to enjoy substantial inflows once again).\n\nNot everyone is bullish though. Standard Chartered warned in a recent note that Bitcoin\u2019s price could drop as much as 70% in 2023. That would surely also hurt Ethereum badly.\n\nVitalik Buterin\u2019s Latest Advice\n\nTo those growing tired of seemingly ever-lasting crypto bear markets, endless bot armies and scammers and fraudsters, Vitalik Buterin has some advice.

        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction \u2013 ETH to $2k? Why Upgrades and Staking Will Keep Price on Upward Trajectory\n\nDisclaimer: The Industry Talk section features insights by crypto industry players and is not a part of the editorial content of Cryptonews.com\n\nEthereum is currently on an interesting upward trajectory. After reaching the $1,400 mark, the crypto asset is now aiming for the $2,000 milestone. And, with the upcoming Shanghai update, this could be a possibility.\n\nETH Price Action\n\nETH has had an impressive few days. The digital asset entered Thursday by breaking through the $1,400 mark for the first time in two months. The asset is up by 4.35% in the past 24 hours, and ETH has beaten the broader market and its 2.58% increase in the same period. At press time, ETH is holding strong at $1,401.\n\nOn the technical front, ETH is doing quite well. Its recent price surge gave it enough momentum to cross all its moving average (MA) indicators \u2013 from the 10-day MA of $1,399 to the 200-day MA of $1,357. Short-term MA metrics are gaining on ETH, but a sustained rally should keep the asset\u2019s value above these metrics for the time being.\n\nWith a positive moving average convergence divergence (MACD), ETH is giving off a buy signal. And the asset\u2019s relative strength index (RSI) of 41.13 indicates that ETH isn\u2019t overbought.\n\nShanghai Update Boosts ETH Rally\n\nETH\u2019s gains can be primarily attributed to the recent increase in positive market sentiment surrounding crypto. As many believe that the Federal Reserve should cut interest rate hikes this month, crypto prices have sharply increased.\n\nHowever, an additional reason for positive sentiment surrounding ETH is the coming Shanghai upgrade. The upgrade will allow investors who staked ETH in the Ethereum Beacon Chain to be able to withdraw it finally. And for many of these investors who have been unable to access their funds since the Ethereum Merge back in September 2022, this could be an important event.\n\nBesides the staking unlock, Shanghai is also expected to introduce \u201cproto-danksharding,\u201d which will bolster layer-2 rollup scalability ahead of the full implementation of the major Sharding upgrade later this year.\n\nSo, with a good view on where things are at for withdrawals, we spent the rest of the call discussing how to approach Shanghai and the various CFI'd EIPs: https://t.co/INHM7oNnDc \u2014 timbeiko.eth \u2600\ufe0f (@TimBeiko) December 8, 2022\n\nTim Beiko, a notable Ethereum developer, recently claimed that they are working towards launching Shanghai in March. While this date is still subject to change, many ETH investors should be excited.\n\nConsider New Coins for Gains\n\nThe ETH rally has made investors very optimistic. However, ETH isn\u2019t the only asset capable of delivering gains.\n\nFight Out (FGHT)\n\nFight Out is a new move-to-earn platform shaking up the fitness industry. The platform incentivizes users to be more active and get their fitness up, rewarding them with tokens as they progress.\n\nWith Fight Out, users will be able to set their fitness goals. They will also be able to access courses and regimens that align with these goals. By tracing vital signs and other important metrics, Fight Out ensures that users can earn rewards. The platform is also developing a metaverse iteration where users can engage with others and participate in competitions.\n\nStay motivated on your fitness journey with Fight Out!\n\n\n\nEarn rewards for completing workouts and challenges as your progress on your journey, there's always something to work towards.\n\n\n\nBe sure to join our presale before stage 1 sells out! \ud83d\udd25\u2b07\ufe0fhttps://t.co/z34Nkx3ffi pic.twitter.com/ew3vRyNOLW \u2014 Fight Out (@FightOut_) January 11, 2023\n\nFGHT, the platform\u2019s native token, will power all operations and transactions in the ecosystem. It is available on presale and has thus far raised an impressive $2.87 million in its early stages.\n\nBuy FGHT on Presale\n\nCalvaria (RIA)\n\nCalvaria is one of the most exciting blockchain gaming platforms in the market. It combines the metaverse with non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and other interesting concepts, delivering strong gameplay that anyone will find exciting.\n\nIn Calvaria, players are tasked with choosing NFT trading cards representing different characters and using them to battle others within the metaverse. The more battles players win, the more they earn. Calvaria\u2019s developers also engage in different community initiatives where players will be able to earn online.\n\nRIA, the platform\u2019s native token, RIA, powers all transactions within the ecosystem. RIA is also a proof-of-stake (PoS) coin that allows players to stake and earn more as a passive investment.\n\n\n\nThe digital asset is now in its last presale stage, having raised more than $2.73 million. This means that only 12% of the RIA coins are still available, with the token set to launch on exchanges such as LBANK Exchange and BKEX Global in the coming weeks.\n\nVisit Calvaria now\n\nMeta Masters Guild (MEMAG)\n\nThe Meta Masters Guild is bringing a new idea to blockchain gaming \u2013 instead of having just one game, the Guild encompasses different titles under a single umbrella. The objective is to create high-quality blockchain games that operate independently but are interconnected.\n\nThere are three games in the MMG ecosystem already. These games will use the MEMAG token as their native asset, meaning that as more games are added to the ecosystem, the asset\u2019s prospects will also grow significantly.\n\nThe $MEMAG Presale is now LIVE! \u24c2\ufe0f\n\n\n\nInvest in the future of blockchain gaming with Meta Masters Guild. \ud83d\udc7e\n\n\n\nBuy $MEMAG now \u2b07\ufe0fhttps://t.co/SBqVjX5mWn now! pic.twitter.com/MaNEPxgYtk \u2014 Meta Masters Guild (@MEMAGgames) January 11, 2023\n\n\n\nMeta Masters Guild raised more than $50,000 in the first 24 hours of its presale, signaling strong market interest in the new play-to-earn crypto gaming platform.\n\nThe digital asset will feature seven presale stages, with the first and current stage selling 1 MEMAG for $0.007 USDT. This price is expected to rise by 42% next week, then to $0.023 by the seventh stage, giving early investors a 228.5% gain.\n\nBuy MEMAG Now"

        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction as Bulls Hold $1,800 Despite Market Sell-Off \u2013 Dip Buying Opportunity?\n\nSource: TradingView\n\nThe Ethereum price has dropped to $1,835 today, representing a 1% loss in the past 24 hours that comes as the wider cryptocurrency market falls by a similar percentage.\n\nETH is now down by 2% in a week and by 6% in the past month, dragged lower by creeping market negativity that may come partly from investor concerns surrounding this week\u2019s downgrade of US government debt.\n\nHowever, with ETH remaining up by 53% since the beginning of the year, and with the coin\u2019s fundamental remaining as strong as ever, there\u2019s little doubt that it will soon recover and that now may be a good time to buy it at a discount.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction as Bulls Hold $1,800 Despite Market Sell-Off \u2013 Dip Buying Opportunity?\n\nEthereum\u2019s chart reveals that the altcoin is nearing or at a bottom, and that it should recover very soon, assuming no more negative news in the next few days and weeks.\n\nSource: TradingView\n\nFor example, ETH\u2019s 30-day moving average (yellow) is falling substantially below its 200-day average, and so is its actual price, indicating that the coin has lost a massive amount of momentum and is decidedly oversold.\n\nIn much the same vein, ETH\u2019s relative strength index fell below 30 at the start of this week and remains low, meaning that it doesn\u2019t really have anywhere else to go but up in the near future.\n\nBut traders should be mindful that the coin\u2019s support level has declined significantly since the middle of July, something which underlines how further price falls are still a possibility before the coin recovers.\n\nAn empire in decline:\n\n\n\nTop (US-based) credit rating agency Fitch downgraded the US government's credit rating\n\n\n\nIt warns \"there has been a steady deterioration in standards of governance\"\n\n\n\n\"Repeated debt-limit political standoffs\u2026 have eroded confidence\"https://t.co/cYCtb2wHu1 \u2014 Ben Norton (@BenjaminNorton) August 2, 2023\n\nAs noted above, ETH and much of the cryptocurrency market has been affected by this week\u2019s downgrading of US debt, which has also seen stock markets around the world struggle, in a sign that the global economy continues to provide an uncertain climate for investors.\n\nSuch uncertainty has evidently hurt ETH and other coins, meaning that the bear market crypto has seen for the past year and a half is still ongoing, despite recoveries since the beginning of the year.\n\nThat said, ETH is primed to rise healthily once the market returns to bullish sentiment and growth.\n\nThis is largely because of its enviable fundamentals, with Ethereum remaining the biggest layer-one blockchain network in terms of total value locked in.\n\nThis represents just how much more Ethereum is used and adopted than the vast majority of its rivals, yet ETH\u2019s tokenomics are also highly bullish.\n\nThe latest @thedailygwei Refuel is ready for your consumption! \u26fd\n\n\n\nToday's topics:\n\n\u2013 Ether futures ETFs \ud83d\udc40\n\n\u2013 25 million ETH staked \ud83e\udd69\n\n\u2013 $10 billion ETH burned \ud83d\udd25\n\n\u2013 and much more \u2795\n\n\n\nWatch \ud83d\udc47https://t.co/0S54xxR5Yr pic.twitter.com/ZO1CIF4sWN \u2014 sassal.eth \ud83e\udd87\ud83d\udd0a (@sassal0x) August 2, 2023\n\nThe introduction of staking last year now means that some 25 million ETH \u2013 or 20% of Ethereum\u2019s total supply \u2013 has now been taken out of circulation, effectively making the cryptocurrency scarcer and more in demand.\n\nTaken together with the introduction of fee burning, this has resulted in a situation where ETH\u2019s overall supply (staked and unstaked) has actually declined by around 350,000 ETH since September 2022.\n\nSuch tokenomics is highly positive as far as Ethereum\u2019s future price is concerned, since greater adoption will lead to more staking of ETH and more burning, which will help push relative supply down and squeeze up the token\u2019s price.\n\nAs such, the market could expect the Ethereum price to reach $1,900 in the next few weeks, before potentially rising as high as $2,500 by the end of the year, assuming more bullish sentiment.\n\nPresale Tokens Can Provide Profit in Bear Markets\n\nWhile it may take some time for ETH and other major cryptocurrencies to fully recover, there are a number of newer altcoins in the market at the moment that could see market-beating gains in the near future.\n\nThis is particularly the case with presale tokens, which can often rally big once they list on exchanges for the first time.\n\nOne of the best presale tokens in the market at the moment is Shibie (SHIBIE), an ERC-20 coin that has inventively mixed memes from both Shiba Inu and Barbie.\n\nShibie, what a Bitch! \ud83d\udc96 Our presale is off to a rousing start and it's all thanks to our fantastic community.

The financial and market information provided on U.Today is intended for informational purposes only. U.Today is not liable for any financial losses incurred while trading cryptocurrencies. Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nOn the financial landscape of Ethereum (ETH), the 27th of October is set to be a date of particular significance. This is not owing to any scheduled technological updates or platform announcements but due to a considerable event in the derivatives market.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpecifically, there are 100,000 ETH call options set to expire at the $1,700 strike price. Even more notably, a cumulative total of over 400,000 call options sit at this very level, with the overall value of options expiring on this day reaching an impressive $1.3 billion. For context, this volume is atypically large, warranting a closer examination.\n\nSource: TradingView\n\nOptions, by their nature, provide holders the right (without the obligation) to buy or sell an underlying asset at a predetermined price within a specified time frame. The expiration of options, especially in large volumes, has the potential to inject significant volatility into the asset's price. This is due to the potential hedging activities or the closing out of positions by institutional and individual traders.\n\nThe mechanics of how options expiration can impact price are intricate. When nearing expiry, if the Ethereum price hovers near the strike price of a significant volume of options, there can be considerable buying or selling pressure. This is because contract holders will either look to close their positions or allow them to expire worthlessly, depending on market conditions and individual strategies.\n\nAn examination of Ethereum's daily chart in the lead up to this date suggests an optimistic price trajectory. The price movement has been predominantly upward, breaking past several resistance points. The moving averages indicate a bullish trend, with the shorter-term average crossing above the longer term, typically seen as a positive sign. However, with the looming expiration date, the potential for heightened volatility is undeniable."

        "title": "This Pattern Points To $10,000+ Ethereum Price, But When? - NewsBTC",
        "content": "This week, Bitcoin and other altcoins livened up the crypto market, potentially lifting up Ethereum price and saving it from further collapse.\n\nWith ETH now moving away from the bottom trend line of a massive long-term price pattern, the next possible target is the upper trend line of the same pattern. That target points to $10,000 per Ether, but how long might it take to reach the lofty price objective?\n\nEthereum Rising Wedge Targets $10,000 Or More\n\nFor almost its entire history of price action, ETHUSD has been filling out what appears to be a massive rising wedge pattern. Such patterns are predominantly bearish, breaking down roughly 60% of the time.\n\nThat leaves 40% of the time that these patterns break upward. Descriptions of the pattern reveal that wedges are notoriously prone to false breakouts and/or false breakdowns, where price violates one trend line, only to reverse and target the other.\n\nIn the latest case, however, Ethereum is holding the bottom line. This makes the next logical target the upper trend line, with at least some probability that it can break upward still. The trend line, happens to be located at around $10,000 per ETH currently and rises with each passing day.\n\nWhen ETHUSD touches the upper trend line is still up for question, but considering the length of past rallies lasting anywhere between six months to a year, it may be less of a wait than many expect.\n\nIs $10,000 per ETH next? | ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nIs This The Beginning Or End of ETH?\n\nEver wonder why a rising wedge pattern can break upward if it is a bearish pattern? In Elliott Wave Principle, wedges fall into the diagonal family of patterns. Diagonals can be leading or ending, expanding on contracting.\n\nA leading diagonal kicks off a sustained move. It\u2019s wedge-like appearance is deceiving as traders expect the pattern to break down, yet instead it breaks upward. In contrast, an ending diagonal finishes off a sustained move. In this case, the bearish breakdown that should be expected in a rising wedge plays out.\n\nEthereum is potentially in a massive diagonal pattern, not the rising wedge that it appears. What we also don\u2019t know is if this is the beginning of a larger sustained move and a leading diagonal, or the end of the largest altcoin\u2019s dominance capped off by an ending diagonal.\n\nBoth patterns form in a five-wave pattern. Unlike standard Elliott Wave patterns, diagonals have unique rules. For example, wave 1 must be the longest, wave 4 must enter wave 1 territory, and wave 5 is the shortest of the waves. Since this is the last wave and potentially the shortest of them all, the touch of the upper trend line could be on the way soon.\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

With such stable price action, market participants may be wondering if a breakout is just around the corner for these leading cryptocurrencies.\n\nIn this analysis, we\u2019ll explore the factors that could contribute to potential price breakouts for both Bitcoin and Ethereum, as well as the key levels traders should keep an eye on.\n\nBTC Network Achieves 75% Progress Towards Upcoming Block Reward Halving\n\nThe Bitcoin network recently reached the 75% milestone towards its next block reward halving, with just under 52,500 blocks left to be discovered before the event.

The Dash network will undergo a reward reduction in less than 53 days, while Litecoin (LTC) will experience a reward halving in about 95 days.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Sees a Rise in Sharks and Whales Amid Lower Prices\n\nThe number of \u201cwhales\u201d and \u201csharks\u201d trading Ethereum (ETH), according to data compiled by Santiment, has skyrocketed during the past year. On Friday, the business tweeted that the number of addresses holding 1,000 or more ETH had increased by 380, representing a 5.7% increase year over year.\n\nSignificant price shifts, often in a positive direction, have often preceded periods of extreme accumulation in the past. In addition, troughs in prices tend to correspond with this spurt of accumulation.\n\n\ud83e\udd88\ud83d\udc33 #Ethereum sharks & whales have grown in number this past year. Comparing the amount of addresses holding 1k or more $ETH, there are 380 more that currently exist compared to last year (a 5.7% rise).

Institutional investors and high-net-worth individuals can take advantage of the current cheap price of Ethereum, which is still 60% below its all-time high reached in May 2021).\n\nThis, in turn, may lead to upward pressure on the price, potentially driving it higher and attracting even more investors to the market.\n\nBitcoin Price\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, Bitcoin encounters immediate resistance near the $30,000 level, which also serves as a psychological threshold. Conversely, robust support can be found around the $29,000 mark. A falling trendline intersects with Bitcoin\u2019s upward trajectory in the two-hour timeframe.\n\nThis specific trendline poses considerable resistance close to the $29,600 level. However, critical technical indicators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) are both in the buy zone, reinforcing the likelihood of a continued bullish trend.\n\nBitcoin Price Chart \u2013 Source: Tradingview\n\nAt the same time, the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) is situated around the $29,100 mark, implying a potential upward trend for Bitcoin.\n\nShould Bitcoin manage to surpass the $30,000 resistance barrier, it could target the $30,400 or $30,800 resistance levels. Conversely, if BTC drops below the $29,100 mark, it may aim for the $28,800 or $28,200 levels.\n\nBuy BTC Now\n\nEthereum Price\n\nThe current Ethereum price is $1,904, with a 24-hour trading volume of $4.6 billion. Ethereum has experienced a slight increase of less than 0.10% in the past 24 hours. It currently ranks #2 on CoinMarketCap, with a live market capitalization of $229 billion.\n\nOn Sunday, Ethereum, the second-leading cryptocurrency, is trading with a sideways bias, maintaining a narrow range between $1,875 and $1,965.\n\nEthereum Price Chart \u2013 Source: Tradingview\n\nSo far, ETH/USD has completed a 38.2% Fibonacci retracement at the $1,925 level. A bullish breakout above this level could potentially lead Ethereum\u2019s price to the $2,055 mark. Further upward movement may expose Ethereum to a price of $2,120.\n\nOn the other hand, support continues to hold around $1,875.7, and a break below this level opens up further room for selling down to the $1,800 mark.\n\nBuy ETH Now\n\nTop 15 Cryptocurrencies to Watch in 2023\n\nKeep abreast of the latest ICO projects and altcoins by consistently reviewing the expert-curated selection of the top 15 most promising cryptocurrencies to monitor in 2023, as recommended by industry professionals at Industry Talk and Cryptonews.\n\nDisclaimer: The Industry Talk section features insights by crypto industry players and is not a part of the editorial content of Cryptonews.com.\n\n\n\nBitcoin Price and Ethereum Prediction: BTC and ETH Drop 5%\u2014Time to Buckle Up or Just a Bump in the Road?\n\n\n\nEthereum Price Prediction as European Financial Firm Launches Euro Stablecoin on Ethereum Blockchain \u2013 ETH to $10,000 in 2023?\n\n\n\nBitcoin Price & Ethereum Prediction: BTC and ETH Up Nearly 4% \u2013 Is More Upside Ahead?\n\nFind The Best Price to Buy/Sell Cryptocurrency"

Source: Adobe\n\nNeon EVM, an Ethereum Virtual Machine on Solana (SOL), will allow developers to build Ethereum (ETH) decentralized applications (DApps) on top of the Solana blockchain.\n\nNeon EVM seeks to bridge the gap between Ethereum and Solana\u2019s computing models, opening doors for Ethereum DApps to leverage the efficiency and technical capabilities of Solana for transaction settlements.\n\nBy residing on Solana\u2019s blockchain, the Neon EVM smart contract processes wrapped Ethereum transactions, combining the robustness of Ethereum\u2019s DApp environment with Solana\u2019s highly efficient infrastructure.\n\nThis innovative design allows developers to deploy Ethereum DApps directly onto the Solana network, minimizing code reconfiguration while taking full advantage of Solana\u2019s native functionality, including parallel execution of transactions, according to a press release shared with Cryptonews.com.\n\n\u201cApply today for the Early Builders Program and be a part of the Neon EVM\u2019s mission to revolutionize blockchain technology,\u201d Neon said in a tweet earlier this month.\n\nApply today for the Early Builders Program and be a part of the Neon EVM\u2019s mission to revolutionize blockchain technology. https://t.co/sMj0zIzSAA #NeonEVM #Solana #Ethererum pic.twitter.com/o7n90MmDbb \u2014 Neon (@Neon_EVM) July 3, 2023\n\nNeon EVM to Drastically Improve Cost-Effectiveness\n\nTraditionally, EVM DApps used rollups or sidechains, which are different types of layer 2 solutions, to ensure cost-effectiveness.\n\nHowever, with the introduction of Neon EVM on Solana, developers now have an alternative solution that avoids the complexities associated with layer 2 solutions.\n\nEthereum\u2019s average transaction fee sits at around $2, while layer 2 solutions can offer savings of 4-20 times, with transaction costs ranging from $0.5 to $0.1.\n\nIn contrast, Solana boasts an impressively low average transaction fee of just 0.00001 SOL (~$0.0002) per transaction, a staggering 10,000-fold reduction in costs.\n\nTo confirm the protocol\u2019s real-world efficacy, Neon EVM has successfully undergone initial Devnet tests.\n\n\u201cWe are very excited to see Neon EVM live on Solana Mainnet,\u201d said Marina Guryeva, director of Neon Foundation.\n\n\u201cOnce we repeat these tests in production, we will present the figures based on the real-world data.\u201d\n\nAlong with the launch, the NEON Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), a community that will play a pivotal role in shaping the future trajectory of Neon EVM, has also been established.\n\nAll in all, the integration of Neon EVM with Solana is a significant development for both Ethereum and Solana ecosystems.\n\nEthereum developers can now tap into Solana\u2019s high-performance infrastructure without sacrificing the familiar Ethereum DApp environment.\n\nThe integration opens doors to new opportunities, enabling developers to create more efficient and cost-effective DApps while expanding the overall capabilities of the decentralized application space.\n\nNEON is the utility token of Neon EVM and will be used for governance.\n\nThe token is currently trading at $0.214499, up by 19.2% over the past day, according to data by CoinGecko."

        "content": "Ethereum Price Won\u2019t Hit $10,000 This Year, but This Altcoin Is Set for 20x Gains\n\nSource: Pixabay\n\nLaunched exactly six years after Bitcoin, Ethereum has risen through the crypto ranks to become the second most valuable crypto asset by market cap with almost 20% in market share.\n\nIts popularity stems from its ingenious flexibility, which has enabled decentralized transfer and decentralized financial trading, and smart contracts.\n\nThis seemingly pivotal first-mover advantage (FMA) has seen many people postulate that $ETH could be on a pilot flight to $10,000 by this year\u2019s end following its successful switch to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus algorithm.\n\nHowever, macro events could serve as a stumbling block given the whirlwind of regulatory actions targeted at the crypto space.\n\nEven if $ETH does not make the $10,000 target price, the foremost smart contract token is still expected to post an impressive profit before the curtains of 2023 close.\n\nNonetheless, investors can easily tap into a new generation crypto trading solution called yPredict and significantly boost their earning potential in the short term.\n\nETH Maintains Important $1800 Support Despite Bearish Straits\n\nAt press time, the Ether token is trading at $1,820, indicating a downtrend of 0.19% in the last 24 hours.\n\nWhile it has tried to turn its sail back into calmer waters, the $ETH token has been unsuccessful as it has since shed 0.41% in the past hour.\n\nHowever, its fortunes gradually improve over time.\n\n$ETH is up 0.5% in the past seven days but is down by 2.37% in the last 30 days.\n\nThe asset\u2019s bullish streak is, however, picked up in the 90-day streak as it has posted an impressive 14.31% increase and 52.67% in the 180-day bracket.\n\nIts year-to-date (YTD) performance also leaves little room for speculation about its current market trajectory, with the Ether token up 52.52% so far.\n\nThis bullish streak is, however, cut short once we look at its short-term technical parameters.\n\nEther\u2019s 50-day smooth moving average (SMA) is posting a price range of $1,891.56, significantly above its current value.\n\nHowever, this could easily change, given that the broader market is already bullish.\n\nOn its longer 200-day simple moving average (SMA), $ETH is conspicuously bullish, with the indicator price at $1,575.34.\n\nThis long-term bullish sentiment is confirmed by its moving average convergence and divergence (MACD), posting a growing strong buy signal.\n\nGiven that its relative strength index (RSI) still has a 48.59 figure showing underbought market pressure, this makes now a viable opportunity to buy Ethereum.\n\nA16z Launches Anonymous Voting 0n Ethereum\n\nThe use case of the Ethereum blockchain is infinite. In a recent blog post, popular crypto venture capital fund A16z or Andreessen Horowitz announced the launch of anonymous voting on the Ethereum network.\n\nUsing the Solidity language called Cicada, the solution prevents anyone except the individual voter from learning a person\u2019s choice until the polling ends.\n\nThe technology relies on time-lock puzzles and zero-knowledge proofs for private on-chain voting.\n\nExcited to announce Cicada: a new building block for private on-chain voting. \ud83d\udc47 https://t.co/hxE4KL4Se6 \u2014 moodle zoup (@moodlezoup) May 24, 2023\n\nThis is a remarkable milestone for the world and the crypto market, as it means individual preferences are easily maintained without being tampered with.\n\nNonetheless, a new blockchain project is already focused on providing AI-powered insights to help investors make better decisions.\n\nyPredict ($YRED)\n\nWhile market analytical tools are common in the mainstream market, they are still a novel concept in the crypto space.\n\nHowever, a new blockchain project is looking to change all that.\n\nBased on the Polygon blockchain, yPredict is an AI-powered and machine learning platform that provides users with time-sensitive data and insights on different cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe innovative platform features AI signals and 25+ chart recognition patterns that help better identify bullish and bearish periods, sentiment, and technical analysis.\n\nThe project is trained with billions of data points that help it carry out the complex market analysis."

        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction as ETH Reaches $200 Billion Market Cap \u2013 Time to Buy?\n\nSource: TradingView\n\nThe Ethereum price has risen by 2% in the past 24 hours, reaching $1,657 as the cryptocurrency market gains by the same percentage. Its current price means that it\u2019s static in the past week and has increased by 6% in the last 14 days, with the coin just about recovering its $200 billion market cap today.\n\nWhile ETH has provided a 38.6% return since the beginning of 2023, it remains a significantly undervalued token. And with Coinbase recently announcing a layer-two sidechain for Ethereum, it could see some very big gains later in the year indeed.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction as ETH Reaches $200 Billion Market Cap \u2013 Time to Buy?\n\nETH\u2019s indicators find themselves in a mixed position, with the coin equally capable of further gains or losses in the near future. For instance, its relative strength index (purple) has begun rising again after sinking to 50 in the past couple of days, signalling a recovery of momentum.\n\nSource: TradingView\n\nOn the other hand, ETH\u2019s 30-day moving (red) has flattened out in relation to its 200-day average (blue). And given how much higher it is than the longer average, ETH could be due for further falls soon.\n\nThat said, any falls may be minor, seeing as how ETH has done a good job of holding its $1,600 support level. So while it may see another dip in the short-term, this is likely to be short-lived, with ETH\u2019s medium- and long-term picture pointing to growth.\n\nIndeed, ETH\u2019s fundamentals remain so strong that it can only rise in the longer term. This has been underlined yet again by a recent announcement from Coinbase, which revealed that it\u2019s launching Base, a layer-two sidechain for Ethereum.\n\n1/ \ud83d\udd35 We\u2019re excited to announce @BuildOnBase.\n\n\n\nBase is an Ethereum L2 that offers a secure, low-cost, developer-friendly way for anyone, anywhere, to build decentralized apps.\n\n\n\nOur goal with Base is to make onchain the next online and onboard 1B+ users into the cryptoeconomy. pic.twitter.com/RmwZFJzGGs \u2014 Coinbase \ud83d\udee1\ufe0f\ud83d\udcde (@coinbase) February 23, 2023\n\nWhat\u2019s significant about this launch is that Coinbase is aiming to \u201conboard 1B+ users into the cryptoeconomy\u201d with Base. Even if it succeeds in attracting only a fraction of such users, its new venture will result in more adoption and usage for Ethereum.\n\nThis implies a steadily rising price for ETH, yet so does Ethereum\u2019s newfound status as a proof-of-stake blockchain. When it completed the Merge in September, its shift to a PoS mechanism laid the foundations for it to become more energy efficient, more scalable and cheaper, something which will only help it solidify its position as the dominant layer-one blockchain in the cryptocurrency ecosystem\n\nEven now, Ethereum currently accounts for 59% of the total value locked in of the entire sector. As further updates come in, and especially when sharding arrives either later this year or in 2024, this percentage is only going to increase.\n\nThat Ethereum is in a very strong position was also highlighted a couple of weeks ago, when payments giant Visa revealed that it\u2019s testing USDC stablecoin payments on the Ethereum blockchain. Again, this suggests that, if big businesses are going to use a public blockchain, they\u2019re most likely going to use Ethereum.\n\nVisa has been testing how to do large settlements using $usdc on #ethereum. #crypto is going to be an everyday part of everyone's lives soon. Get ready. \u2014 Lark Davis (@TheCryptoLark) February 6, 2023\n\nOn top of this, Ethereum is also gearing up to release the Shanghai update, which enables stakers to withdraw the ETH they\u2019ve locked and received as rewards. While some commentators suggest that this could cause a short-term selloff, it\u2019s another bullish milestone for Ethereum, since it de-risks staking for users.\n\nEven with a Shanghai-induced dip this month, ETH is set to recover and return to the $1,700 level in the following weeks before mounting further gains. And the long-term trend is towards $2,000 and higher for later in the year, with earlier updates (e.g. EIP 1559) giving ETH a tendency to become deflationary during periods of peak activity.\n\nAnd with the likes of Coinbase now joining the Ethereum ecosystem, such \u2018peak activity\u2019 is likely to become a regular occurrence, making ETH arguably one of the best bets in crypto.\n\nBuy Ethereum Now\n\nIs Now A Good Time to Buy Ethereum?\n\nETH is one of the most fundamentally attractive coins in the market, yet it may dip when Shanghai makes withdrawals possible. For this reason, shorter-term traders may prefer looking at other high-potential coins. Accordingly, we\u2019ve put together a list of the top 15 cryptocurrencies for 2023, as analyzed by the Cryptonews Industry Talk team.\n\n\n\nThe list is updated weekly with new altcoins and ICO projects, so be sure to check back for new entries.\n\nDisclaimer: The Industry Talk section features insights by crypto industry players and is not a part of the editorial content of Cryptonews.com."

        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction as $10 Billion Trading Volume Sends ETH Up 7% \u2013 Time to Buy?\n\nThe price of Ethereum (ETH) has been on a remarkable upward rally, surging above the $1,800 level on Tuesday morning.\n\nThis surge has been accompanied by a significant increase in trading volume, reaching a whopping $10 billion.\n\nOne significant factor contributing to the surge in Ethereum\u2019s value is the recent development enabling HSBC Hong Kong customers to trade Bitcoin and Ethereum futures through Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs).\n\nIn this Ethereum price prediction, we will explore the factors behind this bullish momentum and evaluate the potential opportunities it presents for investors.\n\nHSBC Hong Kong Allows Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF Trading\n\nHSBC Hong Kong\u2019s recent decision to allow its customers to trade Bitcoin and Ethereum futures through Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) is a significant development that expands the accessibility of digital asset derivatives in the fast-growing Asian crypto market.\n\nAs a major bank in Hong Kong, HSBC\u2019s move highlights the increasing acceptance and interest in cryptocurrencies.\n\nHSBC Hong Kong Launches Support for Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs\n\n\n\nA thread \ud83e\uddf5 \u2014 Jamey.V \ud83d\udfe7 (@NobleAveri) June 27, 2023\n\nBy offering these ETFs, HSBC provides its investors with a regulated and convenient means to access Bitcoin and Ethereum futures.\n\nThis increased accessibility and acknowledgment of digital assets by a prominent financial institution like HSBC have the potential to positively influence the price and demand for Ethereum (ETH) in the market.\n\nEthereum Whales Accumulate, Fueling Bullish Sentiment\n\nAccording to on-chain data, prominent Ethereum whales with substantial holdings of ETH in self-custodial wallets have been accumulating more coins, reaching a new record high.\n\nThis accumulation by influential entities reflects a bullish sentiment and signifies confidence in the potential of Ethereum.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Top 10 Whales Continue To Buy As Holdings Set New ATH https://t.co/CHPMbJ8Aab pic.twitter.com/1b64MGFj7Z \u2014 Cammy Amster (@CammyAmster) June 27, 2023\n\nConsequently, the heightened demand from these whales has the potential to influence the price of ETH positively. Their actions serve as an indication of robust investor interest and long-term optimism in the cryptocurrency.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction\n\nAfter conducting a technical analysis of Ethereum against USDT, we can observe that it is currently in a consolidation phase, trading within a range of $1,845 to $1,945.\n\nOn the daily timeframe, Ethereum encounters significant resistance near the $1,935 level, which is strengthened by a triple-top pattern.\n\nThe close proximity of candles to this level suggests a potential waning of bullish momentum and exhaustion among buyers.\n\nEthereum Price Chart \u2013 Source: Tradingview\n\nMoreover, the relative strength index (RSI) and moving average convergence divergence (MACD) indicators indicate a neutral stance, supporting a cautious perspective, especially after the breakout of a previous downward trend line that acted as a significant obstacle around the $1,845 level.\n\nCurrently, this level is anticipated to act as a support. Monitoring a potential breakout above $1,935 is crucial, as it could propel Ethereum toward the $2,015 level or higher, with a further upside target at $2,126.\n\nConversely, a bearish breakdown below the $1,845 level could trigger selling pressure, potentially driving the price toward $1,756 or $1,669.\n\nExploring Alternative Investment: yPredict\n\nNavigating the fast-paced world of meme coins and cryptocurrency tokens can be daunting, but yPredict offers a solution.\n\nyPredict is an innovative platform that utilizes artificial intelligence (AI) to provide crypto analytics and research.\n\nIts primary objective is to offer traders and investors valuable insights and actionable guidance in the ever-changing market.\n\nWith advanced AI and machine learning algorithms, yPredict has developed predictive models that empower users to make informed decisions with increased confidence and accuracy.\n\nyPredict has achieved a remarkable milestone, raising over $2.6 million in funding.

        "content": "UBS\u2019 Tokenized Money Market Fund Goes Live on Ethereum Blockchain\n\nSource: YouTube/UBS\n\nLeading Swiss asset management bank UBS has announced the debut of its first live pilot of a tokenized Variable Capital Company (VCC) fund on the Ethereum blockchain in Singapore.\n\nIn the published press release , the company stated that the money market fund is part of a wider VCC umbrella built to integrate various real-world assets into the blockchain.\n\nThe UBS pilot is part of Project Guardian , a collaborative industry initiative to tokenize real-world assets. It is controlled by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), the city-state\u2019s central bank and financial watchdog.\n\nThe VCC fund represents a legal entity for investment funds in Singapore, initially introduced in January 2020 to solidify the city-state\u2019s position as a hub for fund management operations.\n\nThomas Kaegi, the Head of UBS Asset Management for Singapore and Southeast Asia, highlighted that the launch of the live VCC marks a significant milestone in the exploration of fund tokenization.\n\nHe also expressed the firm\u2019s commitment to partnering with traditional financial institutions and fintech providers to enhance market accessibility for investors.\n\nThese collaborations will contribute to gaining insights into improving market liquidity for their clients.\n\nAccording to the public announcement, the asset management bank rolled out the controlled pilot of the tokenized money market fund through its in-house tokenization service dubbed \u2018UBS Tokenize.\u2019\n\nThrough smart contracts deployed on the Ethereum public blockchain, the live pilot enables the firm to process various activities such as subscriptions and redemptions.\n\nUBS\u2019s Entry Into the Tokenization Space May Propel More Growth\n\nFollowing the successful rollout of UBS\u2019s first pilot transactions, the asset management firm intends to expand its offerings under Project Guardian and engage in partnerships involving various investment strategies.\n\nHowever, the firm has already made significant strides toward exploring potential decentralized finance (DeFi) use cases through tokenization services.\n\nOn November 3, UBS launched the world\u2019s first digital bond to be traded on public markets. This was followed closely by an issued $50 million tokenized fixed rate note in December.\n\n#JPMorgan has executed its first #DeFi transaction on #Polygon under the pilot program organised by the Singapore\u2019s regulator \"MAS\".\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, #UBS has launched the world\u2019s first digital bond that is publicly traded and settled on both #blockchain and traditional exchanges \u2014 Rick Huckstep (@rickhuckstep) November 8, 2022\n\nOn June 9, the UBS Tokenize platform was used in Hong Kong to issue digital structured notes by the Bank of China Investment (BOCI), which amounted to CNH 200 million ($27.3M).\n\nThese tokenized notes were created and deployed on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nAlthough relatively new, UBS tokenized service and VCC fund can reshape the digital asset landscape and the broader financial system in the coming years."

While the crypto market is no stranger to controversies, the gravity of these allegations is bound to have important repercussions.\n\n@BoringSleuth\u2019s Explosive Findings on Tron\n\nIn August, @BoringSleuth accused Tron of being a Ponzi scheme, alleging that it is controlled by one of the world\u2019s largest criminal drug cartels.\n\n\ud83d\udea8TRON PONZI REVELEAD \u2013 PART OF THE LARGEST CRIMINAL CARTEL IN THE WORLD \ud83d\udea8\n\n\n\nI analyzed @trondao $TRX tokens original token sale, looking specifically at who the Top 20 wallets were owned by, and how much of the total $TRX token supply they received.

Astonishingly, these wallets hold 98% of Tron\u2019s total token supply.\n\nYesterday, the United States Department of Justice sanctioned eight companies linked to the CCP for running a secretive drug network focused on Fentanyl. More than half of the crypto wallets owned by these companies were traced back to Tron.\n\nEthereum Also Under The Lens\n\nI showed and told the World that Tron $TRX was a massive Ponzi, ran by a part of the largest criminal Cartel in the World, and connected to the CCP.\n\n\n\nToday, the DOJ charged 8 CCP companies with illegal drug production, distribution, and sales around Fentanyl.

According to @BoringSleuth, Ethereum, the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency, may have some connections with the CCP and companies involved in drug trafficking.\n\nThe allegations are particularly concerning because of Ethereum\u2019s prominence in the crypto ecosystem. Ethereum is not just a cryptocurrency; it\u2019s a platform for decentralized applications, and many other cryptocurrencies are built on its blockchain.\n\n\ud83d\udea8\ud83c\udde8\ud83c\uddf3 Was #Filecoin a FRAUD Orchestrated by the Ethereum Foundation, Wanxiang, Prometheum, and other CCP entities?

He mentioned that cryptocurrency exchanges like Huobi Global and even other cryptocurrencies like Shiba Inu might have CCP connections. This could add another layer of complexity to ongoing regulatory discussions and investor confidence in the crypto sector.\n\nWhat These Allegations Mean for the Crypto Industry\n\nWhile these allegations are still unconfirmed, they add to the growing concerns around the integrity of cryptocurrencies. Regulatory bodies have been increasingly vigilant, and this could be the tipping point for more stringent regulations in the crypto space. Investors are likely to proceed with caution until more concrete evidence is provided to either substantiate or refute these claims.\n\nThe recent allegations against Tron and Ethereum could serve as a catalyst for an industry-wide introspection on the ethical and legal standing of cryptocurrencies. Although the crypto market has long been mired in controversies, the severity and breadth of these new claims are likely to usher in a period of increased scrutiny and potentially, regulatory overhaul."

        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction as $8 Billion Trading Volume Comes In \u2013 Are Whales Accumulating?\n\nSource: TradingView\n\nThe Ethereum price has risen by 1.5% in the past 24 hours, with its climb to $1,865 happening as its 24-hour trading volume moves above $8 billion.\n\nETH\u2019s current price also means that it\u2019s barely unchanged in a week and has gained by 4% in the last 30 days, while also appreciating by 56% since the beginning of 2023.\n\nOf course, with the market awaiting another likely rate hike from the Federal Reserve, ETH\u2019s modest gains today could be erased, or perhaps boosted if the Fed signals a softening of its stance on interest rates.\n\nRegardless, with Ethereum now processing withdrawals following last month\u2019s Shanghai update, and with the platform continuing to enjoy steady development and growth, the medium- and long-term trajectory for ETH can only be up.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction as $8 Billion Trading Volume Comes In \u2013 Are Whales Accumulating?\n\nETH\u2019s chart continues to suggest that the altcoin remains on shaky ground, with its relative strength index (purple) falling below 50 in the past couple of days and potentially on its way down further.\n\nSource: TradingView\n\nCorrespondingly, ETH\u2019s 30-day moving average (yellow) has actually risen further above its 200-day (blue), something which could indicate that it\u2019s due to fall back down anytime soon.\n\nSupporting this fear is that ETH has fallen through a couple of medium-term support levels over the past few days, with $1,850 being the most recent.\n\nAs such, it could be expected that Ethereum may suffer a few more falls before it makes a concerted and sustainable recovery, especially with the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee likely to bring another rate hike today.\n\nStill, ETH\u2019s recent dips have apparently provided whales with the opportunity to accumulate the coin at a discount, although some large traders are also moving funds to exchanges (potentially to sell).\n\nIrrespective of whether whales are mostly buying or selling right now (the picture still appears mixed), Ethereum\u2019s fundamentals remain as strong as ever, and have recently been boosted by the aforementioned Shanghai update.\n\nThis added the ability to withdraw to Ethereum staking, something which will only increase staking in the long term, thereby increasing demand for ETH.\n\nIf that weren\u2019t enough, Ethereum continues to enjoy more adoption than most other layer-one networks, with major French bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale trialing a euro-denominated stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nThis comes in addition to other positive adoption news this year, including Visa\u2019s use of Ethereum for USDC payments and also Coinbase\u2019s new layer-two network, all of which draw a picture of an increasingly dominant and successful chain.\n\nBecause of this, it\u2019s surely only a matter of time before ETH returns to the $2,000 level, and if the market as a whole becomes more bullish, it could easily reach $2,5000 or even $3,000 in the next few months.\n\nBuy Ethereum Now\n\nA New Web3 Platform\n\nOf course, it needs to be stressed that such levels won\u2019t be reached overnight, so traders looking for altcoins with more of a chance of seeing short-term surges may prefer to look elsewhere.\n\nIn particular, presale tokens offer some of the best opportunities for making a market-beating return, with the best often seeing big rallies when their sales end and they first list on exchanges.\n\nOne of the most promising presales happening right now belongs to Launchpad XYZ (LPX), which bills itself as a seamless ecosystem for users wanting to enter and participate in the Web3 sector.\n\nLaunchpad opened the presale for its native LPX token several days ago, and has already raised just over $160,000.\n\nWonder why the market moves or what impacts asset demand?

        "content": "Bitcoin & Ethereum Price Predictions: Non-Farm Payrolls Turn Sentiment Bearish \u2014 How Low Can BTC & ETH Go?\n\nThe crypto markets have been in a state of flux over the past few weeks, with Bitcoin and Ethereum prices both experiencing significant drops. This has been largely attributed to the recent US non-farm payrolls report, which showed stronger-than-expected job growth. As a result, sentiment in the markets has shifted to bearish and investors are now wondering how low Bitcoin and Ethereum prices could go.\n\nIn this article, we will take a look at some of the current price predictions for Bitcoin and Ethereum and discuss what factors might influence their future performance.\n\nRecord Breaking US Non-Farm Payrolls Jump By 517,000 In January\n\nThe US Labor Department recently reported that, after taking into account seasonal changes, there was an increase of 517,000 non-farm jobs in the month of January. According to economists\u2019 predictions, there was expected to be an increase in employment of 170,000. The hourly earnings for the month rose by 0.3% from the preceding month, in accordance with the consensus estimate.\n\nThe rate of earnings growth slowed from 4.8% in December to 4.4% in January, compared to the estimated figure of 4.3%. This marks a decrease from the prior year\u2019s numbers.\n\nVERY TIGHT LABOR MARKET LIKE THIS PUSHES THE TERMINAL RATE HIGHER.#NFP#FED FUNDS RATE#FED TERMINAL RATE pic.twitter.com/6krtAbM1YC \u2014 Ma. Theresa Sarmiento (@mytsarmiento) February 4, 2023\n\nThe average working hours rose to 34.7 over the course of last month, which is an increase of 0.3% compared to the previous period. Meanwhile, the total weekly aggregate hours witnessed a significant 1.2% jump, settling at 115.6.\n\nAs the US economic position is improving, the American dollar is strengthening in relation to other global currencies. This increase has affected both Bitcoin and Ethereum prices, causing them to dip lower. The Federal Reserve\u2019s decision on a likely rate hike has also contributed to this development.\n\nCraig Wright\u2019s Bitcoin Battle: Will The Trial Of The Century Unfold In 2023\n\nCraig Wright has filed a lawsuit against Bitcoin developers to get them to hand over the crypto assets and alter the code. This case is likely to head to court, according to Reuters\u2019 February 3 report. Craig Wright is taking 15 software developers to court to get access to 111,000 bitcoins worth about $2.5 billion.\n\nAs per Wright\u2019s claims, the hack he suffered in the past caused him to be unable to extract cryptocurrency from certain addresses without those keys. Reports have suggested that one of the addresses connected to Craig Wright may hold the missing funds from the Mt. Gox hack, which he denied.\n\nIf Wright wins his case, the software developers could be compelled to create patches that help Tulip Trading regain all the losses they incurred.\n\nWright has been taking this matter to court in the UK for a few months. It was thrown out last year, but the UK\u2019s Court of Appeal has decided today that developers may now have duties toward blockchain owners.\n\nBad news in the Craig Wright vs Bitcoin Developer case\n\n\n\nCraig has won the right to appeal in the UK and now there may be a full trial\n\n\n\nPretty unfortunatehttps://t.co/CBUewE34Da pic.twitter.com/exodD5n44Q \u2014 BitMEX Research (@BitMEXResearch) February 3, 2023\n\nJudge Colin Birss recently ruled that Tulip has a valid point about cryptocurrency being placed in the care of developers, who may be mandated to move the user\u2019s Bitcoin to a safer place for security purposes.\n\nJames Ramsden, an attorney for some of the developers who are appealing their case, said his clients are worried. Not only could this mean paying money out of pocket, but it also has a potential ripple effect throughout the blockchain industry.\n\nCraig Wright allowed to continue harassing bitcoin developers in court over the alleged theft of billions of dollars worth of bitcoin.\n\n\n\nSad to see courts enable this.\n\n\n\nArticle written by \u201cJordan Atkins\u201d, a journalist that doesn\u2019t exist, in Calvin\u2019s personal blog, Coingeek. pic.twitter.com/kCTOkVF0RX \u2014 hodlonaut 80 IQ 13%er \ud83c\udf2e\u26a1\ud83d\udd11 \ud83d\udc1d (@hodlonaut) February 3, 2023\n\nCraig Wright has sparked cryptocurrency speculation after claiming to be Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin\u2019s anonymous creator. This has caused a lot of debate and controversy within the crypto space. Despite his early involvement in Bitcoin, he has used his position in several legal battles. His accomplishments include winning copyright cases, along with maintaining positive results and minor defeats in defamation instances.\n\nBitcoin Price\n\nBitcoin (BTC) is currently priced at $23,300 with a 24-hour trading volume of $25 billion. It holds the top spot on CoinMarketCap and has a market capitalization of over $449 billion. There are 19.28 million BTC coins in circulation and a maximum supply of 21 million coins.\n\nBitcoin is trending downward and its immediate support area sits at $23,300. If this level is breached, it may see further losses to $23,000 \u2013 a potential point of support marked by a rising trendline.\n\nAccording to the RSI and MACD indicators, selling pressure may increase and consequently push the BTC price downward to reach $22,750 as its next support area.\n\nBitcoin Price Chart \u2013 Source: Tradingview\n\nCurrently, the 50-day exponential moving average is displaying a bullish trend above $23,300 for BTC/USD so we could see a rebound soon. If the price breaks out of $23,950 on the upside, it might go up toward $24,500.\n\nBuy BTC Now\n\nEthereum Price\n\nEthereum\u2018s current trading price is $1,650 and the 24-hour volume stands at $7.6 billion. The crypto asset has seen a 0.50% surge in the last 24 hours. It currently holds a market capitalization of $202 billion and is ranked 2nd on CoinMarketCap.\n\nEthereum\u2019s value dropped significantly after failing to surpass the $1,700 resistance level. The sudden fall was presumably because investors opted to take profits while Ethereum was in an overly-bought position and had already achieved a 50% Fibonacci retracement at $1,635.\n\nIf ETH prices fail to remain above the current level, it is possible for them to drop to $1,615, which is the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level.\n\nEthereum Price Chart \u2013 Source: Tradingview\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicators of Ethereum have both dropped to 56 and 0.40 respectively, indicating that ETH may no longer be in an overbought state. The 50-day Exponential Moving Average also suggests a potential bullish uptrend with prices going above the $1,620 mark.\n\nEthereum is presently dealing with resistance levels at around $1,650 and $1,680. If these figures are successfully broken through, Ethereum might see an increase in its price up to a maximum of $1720.\n\nBuy ETH Now\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum Alternatives\n\nCryptoNews Industry Talk has evaluated the top 15 cryptocurrencies for 2023.

        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction as ETH Spikes Up 5% in a Week \u2013 Where\u2019s ETH Heading Now?\n\nSource: TradingView\n\nThe Ethereum price has dipped by 2.5% in the past 24 hours, reaching $1,641 amid a 2.5% fall for the market as a whole today. Despite this drop, its current price means that it has gained by 5% in a week, while being up by 37% since the start of the year.\n\nAs the cryptocurrency market continues to recover this year, ETH is one of the best-placed tokens to rally. With arguably the best fundamentals in the market and enviable network effects, it could witness some big price increases as 2023 plays out, as it cements its position as the biggest layer-one smart contract platform.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction as ETH Spikes Up 5% in a Week \u2013 Where\u2019s ETH Heading Now?\n\nETH\u2019s indicators suggest that the altcoin may be due a fall in the coming days, with its relative strength index (purple) beginning to sink down from 60. Likewise, its 30-day moving average (red) has stopped its ascent in relation to its 200-day (blue), and looks ready to come back down, bringing ETH\u2019s price with it.\n\nSource: TradingView\n\nA key support level to watch here is $1,600. If ETH falls below this price, a more substantial selloff may be on the cards, with the coin\u2019s last descent below $1,600 leading to a drop to just under $1,500.\n\nThese misgivings aside, ETH continues to have some of the strongest fundamentals in the market. Its total value locked in, at $28.85 billion, accounts for 58.7% of the entire DeFi sector, although this percentage would be even higher if Ethereum-based layer-two networks (such as Polygon) are also included.\n\nGiven its early-mover advantage and huge network effects, Ethereum continues to attract investors and users who want to be on the platform that \u2018everyone else\u2019 is on. And with Ethereum successfully completing its transition to proof-of-stake in September, it has laid the foundations to increase its speed, scalability and efficiency.\n\nIndeed, it seems that Ethereum has only grown in stature since September\u2019s Merge, with the beginning of the month bringing the news that payments giant Visa is testing USDC stablecoin payments on the Ethereum blockchain. Added to previous Ethereum cheerleading from Visa, this development is very bullish for Ethereum, suggesting that the big players are betting on its success.\n\nVisa has been testing how to do large settlements using $usdc on #ethereum. #crypto is going to be an everyday part of everyone's lives soon. Get ready. \u2014 Lark Davis (@TheCryptoLark) February 6, 2023\n\nIn addition, Ethereum is gearing up for the Shanghai update, which will enable the withdrawal of staked ETH. While some have argued that this will result in a flood of newly-released ETH entering the market, it will likely have the opposite effect in that it completes Ethereum\u2019s transition to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism.\n\nThe Ethereum Shanghai upgrade is expected to arrive in just a few weeks, enabling the crucial ability for validators to withdraw staked ETH and accumulated ETH rewards. pic.twitter.com/wXk6dAw86v \u2014 Kevin Peng \ud83d\udc27 || The Block (@pengcapital) February 21, 2023\n\nIndeed, the fact that people can withdraw their staking rewards will encourage more people to invest in the Ethereum ecosystem. At the same time, Shanghai introduces numerous updates that are necessary if Ethereum is to implement such innovations as sharding, which will enable it to process transactions in parallel.\n\nIn other words, Shanghai sends Ethereum further down the road of becoming a more scalable network, and the result of which will likely be Ethereum price rises.\n\nFrom its current price, ETH could move to $1,700 once its current dip has played out. After that, the arrival of Shanghai and of other positive adoption news, could push it up to $1,800 and higher, potentially reaching $2,000 by the middle of the year.\n\nMore generally, there are various reasons to suspect sustained price rises in 2023. To begin with, the Merge and such upgrades EIP 1559 have given ETH a tendency to become deflationary during periods of busier activity.\n\n#Ethereum becomes deflationary when the token's burn rate (from transaction fees) is greater than the staking reward for validators\n\n\n\nPoS ETH has only existed for a few months\n\n\n\nIn the next bull run, ETH may become even more deflationary with more people using Crypto regularly pic.twitter.com/Edpq0jrZR7 \u2014 Velvet.Capital (@Velvet_Capital) December 21, 2022\n\nOn top of this, whales and other bigger investors have been taking ETH off exchanges in the past few months. For instance, data compiled by Santiment suggests that the value of ETH stored by exchanges has fallen by 37% since the Merge (in September), with the total amount of ETH falling by 30% over the same period.\n\nTo correct our phrasing, there are 37% less coins (in terms of the dollar valuation) on exchanges. The actual drop in $ETH coins on exchanges is 30%. \ud83d\udc4d \u2014 Santiment (@santimentfeed) February 13, 2023\n\nAs Shangahi is implemented and staking becomes more widespread, we can expect even more ETH to be taken off exchanges. The upshot of this is that, along EIP 1559 and other \u2018deflationary\u2019 updates, ETH\u201ds supply will be squeezed, causing the coin\u2019s price to rise higher.\n\nBuy Ethereum Now\n\nIs Now A Good Time to Buy Ethereum?\n\nWhile ETH is definitely undervalued right now, it may not experience a substantial rally until after the Shanghai upgrade, at the earliest. In light of this, we\u2019ve taken a look at other high-potential coins and put together a list the top 15 cryptocurrencies for 2023, as analyzed by the CryptoNews Industry Talk team.\n\n\n\nThe list is updated weekly with new altcoins and ICO projects, so be sure to check back for new entries.\n\nDisclaimer: The Industry Talk section features insights by crypto industry players and is not a part of the editorial content of Cryptonews.com."

        "content": "Bitcoin Price and Ethereum Prediction \u2013 FTX Down 35% amid Insolvency Rumors\n\nThe Asian session has started with a crypto market massacre, with all of the main cryptocurrencies on a strong negative run and the global crypto market cap plummeting below $1 trillion amid FTX insolvency fears. Bitcoin price fell sharply and broke through an upward trendline to trade at $19,600. Similarly, Ethereum fell 7.5% to $1,470.\n\nBillionaire Sam Bankman-FTX Fried\u2019s cryptocurrency exchange was the subject of increasing rumors throughout the night, but the company\u2019s CEO tweeted first thing Monday morning: \u201cFTX is fine. Assets are fine.\u201d\n\nLiquidating our FTT is just post-exit risk management, learning from LUNA. We gave support before, but we won't pretend to make love after divorce. We are not against anyone. But we won't support people who lobby against other industry players behind their backs. Onwards. \u2014 CZ \ud83d\udd36 Binance (@cz_binance) November 6, 2022\n\nWe covered a story earlier today that Alameda Research, a subsidiary of FTX, carried a large amount of its native exchange token, FTT, on its balance sheet. A public spat ensued between Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison and Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao, who also owns a substantial amount of FTT tokens.\n\nThe CEO of FTX says that speculations about the company\u2019s financial health are unfounded.\n\nAfter rival crypto exchange Binance announced it would sell its holdings of FTX\u2019s native token on Monday, FTX founder and billionaire Sam Bankman-Fried took to Twitter to reassure crypto investors.\n\nSunday, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao tweeted that \u201cdue to recent revelations that have come to light,\u201d the exchange would be selling its FTX token holdings.\n\nAs part of Binance\u2019s exit from FTX equity last year, Binance received roughly $2.1 billion USD equivalent in cash (BUSD and FTT). Due to recent revelations that have came to light, we have decided to liquidate any remaining FTT on our books. 1/4 \u2014 CZ \ud83d\udd36 Binance (@cz_binance) November 6, 2022\n\nBut Zhao did not elaborate on which disclosures he was referring to or how many tokens Binance actually had.\n\nIn response, FTX\u2019s Bankman-Fried encountered with series of tweets, saying:\n\n\u201cA competitor is trying to go after us with false rumors.\u201d\n\nCheck out this link if you want to read more about the FTX backstory.\n\nTop Altcoin Gainers and Losers\n\nIn the last 24 hours, the top performers were Toncoin (TON), VeChain (VET), and Chainlink (LINK). Overall, the bullish bias is a bit weaker as the market is exhibiting risk-off sentiment. Toncoin has lost over 4% to trade at $1.66, and Polygon has risen by more than 2% to $0.026. At the same time, the price of LINK has increased by about 1% to $8.35.\n\nTop Altcoin Gainers and Losers \u2013 Source: Coin360\n\nIn the last 24 hours, FTX Token has been a major victim of FTX insolvency rumors, losing more than 27% to $16. We\u2019ll go over it in greater depth in the section below. BitDao (BIT) is down 17% to $0.3400, while Solana (SOL) is down 17% to $26.75.\n\nBitcoin Price\n\nThe current Bitcoin price is $19,600 and the 24-hour trading volume is $60 billion. Bitcoin lost over 6% during the Asian session. CoinMarketCap currently ranks it first, with a live market cap of $378 billion, down from $438 billion yesterday.\n\nBitcoin Price & Tokenomics \u2013 Source: coinmarketcap\n\nBitcoin has broken through an upward channel at $20,400 and triple bottom support at $20,000, shifting Bitcoin\u2019s technical outlook to the bearish side. Bitcoin has also formed a \u201cthree black crows\u201d candlestick pattern on the 4-hour timeframe, indicating a strong bearish bias among investors.\n\nOn the downside, Bitcoin\u2019s immediate support is at $19,230, and a break of this level could expose BTC to $18,650. Leading and lagging indicators such as the RSI, MACD, and 50-day moving averages all support a downward trend.\n\nIf BTC fails to halt the downtrend at $18,650, a break below will allow for further selling until $18,000 and $17,650.\n\nBitcoin Price Chart \u2013 Source: Tradingview\n\nOn the higher side, Bitcoin\u2019s immediate resistance remains at $20,000, and a break above this level could expose BTC to $20,635. Bearish bias persists today.\n\nEthereum Price\n\nOn Tuesday, the second most valuable cryptocurrency, Ethereum fell roughly 9% in the previous 24 hours to trade at $1,446. On CoinMarketCap, it is now ranked second, with a live market capitalization of $178 billion, down from $193 billion yesterday.\n\nEthereum Price & Tokenomics \u2013 Source: coinmarketcap\n\nEthereum has formed a bearish engulfing and three black crows candlestick pattern on the 4-hour chart, indicating a strong selling bias among investors. Ethereum has now broken below an upward trendline at $1,460. With the breach of the upward trendline, Ethereum gains access to the downside until the $1,380 support zone.\n\nAt the same time, the RSI and MACD are indicating a strong bearish trend; however, both indicators have entered the oversold zone, indicating that sellers may be exhausted soon, opening the door for bulls to buy.\n\nEthereum Price Chart \u2013 Source: Tradingview\n\nSo keep an eye on $1,460 because closing 4-hour candles above this level has the potential to reverse the downtrend and help us in capturing a bullish correction. On the downside, $1,380 may be a good level for bulls.\n\nFTX Down 35% amid Insolvency Rumors\n\nThe current price of FTX Token is $16, with a 24-hour trading volume of $1.1 billion. FTT has fallen by over 28% in the previous 24 hours and over 35% in the last seven days. With a live market cap of $2 billion, CoinMarketCap now ranks #30.\n\nFTT Price Chart \u2013 Source: Tradingview\n\nOn the technical front, the FTT/USD has broken through a descending triangle pattern, indicating the possibility of a bearish trend continuation.\n\nFTT may find next support near $13.85 or $9.50 on the downside, as the breakout of the descending triangle pattern could negatively impact FTT investors\u2019 sentiment.\n\nFTT/USD Price Chart \u2013 Source: Tradingview\n\nFTT\u2019s immediate resistance remains at $19 or $22 on the upside.\n\nNew Crypto Presale With Huge Potential\n\nDash 2 Trade (D2T)\n\nDash 2 Trade is an Ethereum-based trading intelligence platform that provides real-time analytics and social data to traders of all skill levels, allowing them to make more informed decisions.

        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction as Bulls Push ETH Past $1,800 Resistance \u2013 Here\u2019s Where ETH is Heading Now\n\nThe Ethereum price has risen by 2% in the past 24 hours, spiking above the $1,800 resistance level and preparing the ground for further gains in the coming days.\n\nAt $1,800, ETH is now up by 7% in a week and by 25% in a fortnight, with the biggest altcoin also having gained by 50% since the beginning of the year.\n\nAnd with the Shanghai upgrade due on April 12, the ability to withdraw staked ETH is only likely to boost ETH\u2019s price in the medium- and long-term, given that staking will become more attractive to more investors.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction as Bulls Push ETH Past $1,800 Resistance \u2013 Here\u2019s Where ETH is Heading Now\n\nETH\u2019s chart suggests that the coin is still in the middle of a rally, with its indicators refusing to lose momentum.\n\nSource: TradingView\n\nIts relative strength index (purple) remains close to 60, after rising from 30 earlier in the month, with it having plenty of room left to rise further before ETH becomes overbought.\n\nSimilarly, ETH\u2019s 30-day moving average (red) continues to rise above its 200-day average (blue), showing no sign of stopping just yet.\n\nAnd given that ETH has broken through the $1,800 resistance level, it could indeed progress to other levels in the coming days.\n\nYes, the wider market is currently in a mixed mood, with Coinbase facing likely legal action from the SEC and the global financial system remaining under strain, but Ethereum\u2019s fundamentals continue to suggest that the altcoin is due further gains.\n\nThis is largely because of the aforementioned Shanghai update, which is already running on the Goerli testnet.\n\nShanghai upgrade on Goerli is a success, and you are still fudding withdrawals?\n\n\n\nOh sweet summer child \u2014 odin free \ud83e\udd87\ud83d\udd0a (@odin_free) March 14, 2023\n\nShanghai will permit the withdrawal of staked ETH (including staking rewards), and while some have claimed that the update will result in a spike in selling pressure, the negative impact of the upgrade will actually be fairly contained.\n\nWhy? It\u2019s because withdrawals of staked ETH cannot happen at once, with developers setting daily limits of how many validators can withdraw 32 ETH per day.\n\nThis limit is currently set at 1,575 full withdrawals per day, given that the total active validator count is between 458,752 and 524,288.\n\nAnd because a significant portion of Ethereum validators are actually in the red, many will choose to sit tight on their staked ETH, meaning the market is unlikely to see a deluge of sales.\n\nIt\u2019s, therefore tempting to see Shanghai as much more of a positive for ETH than a negative, in that it will take another significant step in Ethereum\u2019s evolution as a proof-of-stake chain.\n\nImportantly, it will de-risk staking for users in that now any prospective staker will know they\u2019ll be able to get their staked ETH, and their rewards, back.\n\nThis fact alone is likely to result in ETH seeing increased interest from institutional investors, who may increasingly wish to participate in staking in order to earn a passive income.\n\n\ud83e\uddf53/ The successful execution of the Ethereum merge has increased certainty and confidence among institutions. Panelists emphasized the growing interest in passive investments like index funds and more sophisticated strategies like staking. #ETH \u2014 Staking Rewards | Staking Summit \ud83c\uddf9\ud83c\uddf7 (@StakingRewards) March 17, 2023\n\nHelping to attract further investment is the fact that ETH has become a semi-deflationary token ever since the Merge and EIP 1559, with both upgrades meaning that Ethereum actually destroys more ETH than it issues during periods of high traffic.\n\nThis tendency is likely to increase over time, as Ethereum attracts more usage and adoption, pushing ETH\u2019s price up higher.\n\nIt\u2019s for this reason that it\u2019s not unrealistic to expect ETH to pass $2,000 in the next few months, potentially regaining a level around $3,000 by the end of the year.\n\nThis optimism is also supported by the adoption news Ethereum continues to enjoy, with Coinbase announcing last month that it will be launching its own layer-two sidechain for Ethereum.\n\n5/ If you\u2019d like to unstake, Coinbase will begin taking unstaking requests about 24 hours after the upgrade completes. All unstaking requests are processed on-chain, and we\u2019ll pass the unstaked funds and staking rewards to you once released by the Ethereum protocol. \u2014 Coinbase \ud83d\udee1\ufe0f\ud83d\udcde (@coinbase) March 15, 2023\n\nThis is significant because it means that Coinbase will be working actively to attract more users to not only its new layer-two network, but to the underlying Ethereum chain.\n\nSo over time, Ethereum is likely to cement its position as the biggest layer-one blockchain by total value locked in, with the ETH price continuing to benefit as a result.\n\nBuy Ethereum Now\n\nWhen to Buy Ethereum?\n\nThere\u2019s an argument that ETH may be near the end of its current short-term rally, although the coin will almost certainly see longer-term gains throughout the rest of the year.\n\nHowever, seeing as how really substantial gains may not come for several months (or longer), traders may prefer to look elsewhere for above-return returns, with quite a few new altcoins and presale tokens showing some real potential at the moment.\n\nThe Cryptonews Industry Talk team has studied such coins and created a list of the top 15 cryptocurrencies for 2023, each with good short-term as well as long-term prospects.\n\nThis list is regularly updated with new altcoins and ICO projects.\n\nDisclaimer: The Industry Talk section features insights by crypto industry players and is not a part of the editorial content of Cryptonews.com."

        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction as Millionaire Trader Says ETH Will Fall to $1,400 \u2013 What\u2019s Going On?\n\nSource: TradingView\n\nThe price of Ethereum (ETH) has risen by 1.4% in the past 24 hours, reaching $1,669 after millionaire trader KBM predicted that the altcoin is set to fall to around $1,400.\n\nThis forecast comes as ETH remains down by 7% in a week and by 10% in the last 30 days, with the biggest altcoin remaining up by 39.5% since the beginning of the year.\n\nWith the wider market (and global economy) remaining in an unsettled and uncertain state, it is entirely possible that ETH will suffer further losses before making a sustained \u2013 and overdue \u2013 recovery.\n\nHowever, its technical indicators suggest that it\u2019s already very close to bottoming out, and that a rebound should be arriving soon.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction as Millionaire Trader Says ETH Will Fall to $1,400 \u2013 What\u2019s Going On?\n\nLooking at ETH\u2019s chart, it\u2019s clear that the altcoin doesn\u2019t have too much momentum right now, with its 30-day moving average (yellow) having just fallen below its 200-day average (blue) in a \u2018death cross.\u2019\n\nSource: TradingView\n\nSuch crosses can indicate further losses and sales, and with ETH\u2019s relative strength index (purple) struggling to rise significantly beyond 30, it is indeed possible that we will see the altcoin drop a little lower in the next few days.\n\nThis pessimism is supported by ETH\u2019s medium-term support level (green), which has fallen to a lower level in the past week or so, after the altcoin breached $1,700.\n\nThis means that the coin could potentially sink lower in the next few days or weeks, before making an eventual recovery.\n\nSuch a view is also supported by various high-profile experts and analysts, with investors and podcast host KBM (@KeyboardMonkey3 on Twitter) recently suggesting that Bitcoin (BTC) will fall to around $21,000 and ETH will drop to $1,400.\n\nWe\u2019re so back.\n\n\n\nContinue to short everything for wealth and prosperity until further notice. (21k & 1400) pic.twitter.com/cNzDXnWcru \u2014 Keyboard Monkey -KBM- (@KeyboardMonkey3) August 22, 2023\n\nOf course, just because KBM has made some money doesn\u2019t guarantee an infallible ability to predict future prices, so retail investors should take his opinions with a pinch of salt.\n\nAnd in the longer term, there\u2019s little doubt that ETH will rise considerably higher than its current price, let alone $1,400.\n\nIt continues to dominate the market in terms of total value locked in, and with the Holesky testnet and EIP-4844 upgrade approaching in the next few weeks, it\u2019s likely to cement its position even further.\n\nJust this week, PayPal created their own stablecoin on Ethereum and Visa showcased tech that lets people pay gas fees using a credit/debit card\n\n\n\nOh and Coinbase officially launched their Ethereum layer 2\n\n\n\nImagine still being bearish on ETH \u2014 sassal.eth \ud83e\udd87\ud83d\udd0a (@sassal0x) August 11, 2023\n\nIndeed, Ethereum scored big earlier this month when PayPal announced it would be launching its own Ethereum-based stablecoin, something which could result in a massive increase in traffic and adoption in the not-too-distant future.\n\nFor this reason, ETH can be expected to return to $2,000 towards the end of the year, with a new bull market pushing it towards $2,500, $3,000 and higher.\n\nFaster Gains With Newer Altcoins\n\nETH\u2019s position as the second-biggest cryptocurrency in the market means that it will tend to make gradual rather than sudden or dramatic gains.\n\nFor this reason, traders in the hunt for big market-beating returns will probably have to look elsewhere, with presale tokens being one good source of quick and impressive gains this year.\n\nOne of the best such tokens right now is Launchpad.xyz (LPX), an all-in-one Web3 trading platform that has raised more than $1.3 million since kicking off its sale a few weeks ago.\n\nLaunchpad.xyz aims to make trading more accessible and rewarding for investors, providing a wide range of tools and features that can be harnessed by novice and experienced traders alike.\n\nThis includes Web3 wallet addresses, a play-to-earn gaming hub, a launchpad for Web3 presales, market intelligence and signals, as well as collaborative trading rooms and automated trading bots.\n\nOther impressive elements of its ecosystem are its own DEX and NFT marketplace, as well as the ability to create and trade fractionalized assets.\n\nExperience trading like never before with #LaunchpadXYZ\n\n\n\nDive into a user interface crafted uniquely for you, ensuring maximum efficiency \ud83d\ude80\n\n\n\nJoin us and elevate your trading game\n\n\ud83d\udc49https://t.co/ZUZaIKgy84\n\n#LaunchpadKnows #Web3 #Crypto pic.twitter.com/9oe5kHSWxo \u2014 Launchpad.xyz (@launchpadlpx) August 23, 2023\n\nWithin its platform, LPX will be used to pay fees and subscriptions, with the coin also available for staking.\n\nThis provides the token with plenty of utility, and in combination with Launchpad\u2019s all-encompassing trading features, it\u2019s not hard to see why so many investors have poured into its presale.\n\nNew buyers can join this sale by heading over to the official Launchpad.xyz website and connecting their software wallets.\n\n1 LPX costs $0.0445, yet such a price is likely to seem very cheap once the sale ends and the coin lists on trading platforms.\n\nVisit Launchpad xyz Now\n\nDisclaimer: Crypto is a high-risk asset class.

        "content": "The United States and Israel are intensifying efforts to curtail cryptocurrency transfers to Hamas following the group\u2019s large-scale attacks on Israel earlier this month. Coins like Bitcoin, Dogecoin, and Ethereum are often implicated as funding streams for Islamist organizations.\n\nThe use of digital currencies and crypto exchange platforms to finance Islamist extremism has come under increasing scrutiny after the Oct. 7 attacks by Hamas, France 24 reported.\n\nOn Oct. 19, the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) proposed new regulations to classify \u201cConvertible Virtual Currency Mixing\u201d (CVC mixing) as a primary money laundering concern to combat its use by malicious actors, including Hamas.\n\n\u201cMixers\u201d or \u201ctumblers\u201d blend cryptocurrency of illicit origin with other funds, increasing the risk of using crypto mixers for money laundering or concealing earnings, according to the crypto industry news site Cointelegraph.\n\nSee Also: Crypto Analyst Foresees Bitcoin Breaking $70,000 Barrier Soon, But Only If This Happens\n\nPost the Oct. 7 attack, the Israeli defense ministry claimed to have seized virtual wallets linked to Hamas that received $41 million between 2019 and 2023. The Palestinian Islamic Jihad group reportedly raised $94 million in cryptocurrency over recent years, as per British firm Elliptic.\n\nOn Oct. 18, Washington sanctioned \u201cBuy Cash,\u201d a Gaza-based company, for allegedly facilitating cryptocurrency transfers to Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad.\n\nDespite these revelations, experts like Tom Keatinge, director of the Centre for Financial Crime Research and Security Studies at the Royal United Service Institute, caution against overhyping cryptocurrency\u2019s role in funding extremism. Most of Hamas\u2019 budget, estimated at nearly $1 billion, comes from \u201cexpatriates or private donors in the Gulf region,\u201d as per Deutsche Welle.\n\nIn this respect, the $41 million in cryptocurrencies seized by the Israeli authorities may seem like a drop in the bucket for Hamas, as per the report.\n\nNevertheless, crypto has become a more prominent funding method due to its ease and speed of transactions. The rising crackdown on traditional terrorist financing channels has led these groups to explore new ways of raising money, such as cryptocurrencies.\n\nCryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC), Dogecoin (CRYPTO: DOGE), and Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) are increasingly accused of facilitating funding for Islamist groups. Hamas\u2019 use of crypto was first revealed in January 2019. Initially, these \u201cfunding 2.0\u201d initiatives raised only a few thousand dollars. However, Hamas has increasingly used social media networks as funding channels ever since.\n\nRead Next: Bitcoin Core Dev Warns Of \u201cAll Your Mempool Are Belong To Us\u201d Attack, Steps Down From Lightning Network\n\nImage via Shutterstock\n\nEngineered by Benzinga Neuro, Edited by Pooja Rajkumari\n\nThe GPT-4-based Benzinga Neuro content generation system exploits the extensive Benzinga Ecosystem, including native data, APIs, and more to create comprehensive and timely stories for you.

        "content": "Ethereum Core Developers Announce Date for Long-Awaited Shapella Upgrade \u2013 Here\u2019s What You Need to Know\n\nSource: AdobeStock / Wagner\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s happening,\u201d said an Ethereum (ETH) core developer, announcing the launch of the network\u2019s much-anticipated Shapella update in two weeks.\n\nThe Shanghai and Capella upgrades, aka Shapella, are scheduled for April 12, said developer Tim Beiko in a Tuesday tweet.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a validator, you should check out our Withdrawals FAQ to make sure you are ready for the upgrade,\u201d he added.\n\nIt's happening \ud83c\udf8a\n\n\n\nShapella is scheduled on mainnet for epoch 194048, scheduled for 22:27:35 UTC on Apr. 12, 2023 \ud83d\udcc6\n\n\n\nClient releases compatible with the upgrade are listed in the announcement below \ud83d\udc47https://t.co/I0hSv9lnjz \u2014 timbeiko.eth \u2600\ufe0f (@TimBeiko) March 28, 2023\n\nPer the Ethereum Foundation\u2018s announcement, the upgrade will activate on the Ethereum network at epoch 194048.\n\nThe consensus was quickly reached during the 157th AllCoreDevs Execution Layer meeting, it added.\n\nThe post explained that,\n\n\u201cThis upgrade follows The Merge and enables validators to withdraw their stake from the Beacon Chain back to the execution layer. It also introduces new functionality to both the execution and consensus layer, described below.\u201d\n\nThis information is important for several reasons.\n\nFirstly, the upgrade will enable stakers to withdraw their ETH, which is a critical function for those who have staked their tokens.\n\nWith over 16.35 million ETH currently staked on the network, this upgrade will be highly anticipated by many stakeholders.\n\nIn addition, it\u2019s worth noting that the Shapella upgrade is a comprehensive update that combines changes to the execution layer (Shanghai), consensus layer (Capella), and the Engine application programming interface (API).\n\nThe naming convention used for the different upgrades is also interesting, as upgrades to the execution layer are named after Devcon city names, while upgrades to the consensus layer are named after star names.\n\nTherefore, \u2018Shapella\u2019 is the combination of the Devcon2 location \u2018Shanghai\u2019 and the star \u2018Capella\u2019.\n\nUsers of exchanges, digital wallets, and hardware wallets are not required to do anything, unless they are informed to take additional steps by the exchange or wallet provider, the Foundation stated.\n\nAs for node operators, to be compatible with the Mainnet upgrade, they must update their node to the version of their Ethereum client.\n\nThe client releases listed in the post support Shanghai and Capella on the Ethereum mainnet, while previous Shapella releases only supported testnet deployments, and are hence, incompatible with the mainnet upgrade, the announcement warned.\n\nStakers must ensure that both their beacon node and validator client are updated.\n\nAdditionally, both the Foundation and Beiko reminded users that, until April 5, the Ethereum Bug Bounty rewards have been doubled to $500,000 for identifying Shapella vulnerabilities.\n\nFor those who want to watch Shapella go live, there will be a Shapella viewing party.\n\nMeanwhile, depositing on the mainnet directly requires a minimum of ETH 32. There are, however, protocols that allow users to deposit any amount in order to participate.\n\nLido, a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol and a third-party staking pool operator for Ethereum 2.0, for example, announced that it already conducted withdrawals on the Goerli testnet.\n\n\ud83c\udf89 Lido V2 is currently being tested on Goerli with the first successful withdrawal already confirmed \ud83c\udf89https://t.co/8NcTklCmjU\n\n\n\nHere's what to expect from the Goerli V2 Testnet \ud83e\uddf5\ud83d\udc47 \u2014 Lido (@LidoFinance) March 28, 2023\n\nIts LDO coin is up 17.3% over the past 24 hours to $2.45 at the time of writing.\n\nThis is a notable jump, as it\u2019s up 1.3% in a week and down nearly 12% in a month. It is the day\u2019s best performer among the top 50 coins by market capitalization.\n\nETH is up 4.2% in a day, currently trading at $1,809.\n\n____\n\nLearn more:\n\n\u2013 Ethereum\u2019s Shanghai Hard Fork Target Date Revealed: Staked ETH Withdrawals Coming Soon\n\n\u2013 Gensler Sticks to His Guns: Proof-of-Stake Tokens Could Be Securities \u2013 Ethereum in Trouble?\n\n\n\n\u2013 Coinbase Exec: Altcoin Markets Attracting Institutional Investors Amid Bitcoin and Ethereum Dominance\n\n\u2013 How Another Ethereum DeFi Summer Can Power the Next Big ETH Price Rally\n\n\n\n\u2013 How to Stake ETH for Ethereum 2.0?\n\n\u2013 What Is Ethereum 2.0?"

Discover SCENE\n\nIt's all eyes on Bitcoin (BTC) as the industry\u2019s largest cryptocurrency is up 12.6% over the day, trading above the $34,000 mark.\n\nThe largest cryptocurrency by market cap surged above $35,000 late on Monday before backtracking to $34,540 at the time of writing, data from CoinGecko shows.\n\nThis is the highest value for Bitcoin since May last year, with the move resulting in a total of over $310 million in liquidated short positions in the past 24 hours, per CoinGlass.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nInterestingly, the BTC Fear and Greed Index\u2014a popular metric that measures the overall sentiment towards Bitcoin\u2014spiked to 66, meaning that it is now in the \u201cGreed\u201d territory.\n\nEthereum (ETH) has also enjoyed a significant upswing, reaching its highest point since August.\n\nAt press time, the second-largest cryptocurrency is trading hands at $1,830, up 10% over the day.\n\nThe total market capitalization of all digital assets has meanwhile swelled more than $100 billion over the span, soaring 9.3% above the $1.3 trillion mark\u2014the peak value since April, according to CoinGecko.\n\nMore than a half of that now accounts for Bitcoin, as several important events unfolded on Monday, sparking a new wave of optimism about the potential launch of a spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBitcoin ETF on the horizon?\n\nSeveral ETF applications have taken the spotlight of late.\n\nFirst is Grayscale's Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which gives holders exposure to Bitcoin via shares. Those shares, however, have traded at a hefty discount of late as holders aren't able to redeem the underlying. Grayscale aims to fix that by filing to convert the Trust into a full-blown Bitcoin ETF.\n\nThe filing was first rejected by the SEC, but earlier this month a court ruled against the SEC's rejection, and yesterday the Commission was ordered to review the filing once more.\n\nAnother key driver of this recent surge in Bitcoin's value is the appearance of BlackRocks\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust on a list of Nasdaq-traded ETFs, which is maintained by the world\u2019s leading financial clearinghouse, the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC).\n\nJust last week. BlackRock filed an amended prospectus for its spot Bitcoin ETF application, which included detailed explanations on the proposed product\u2019s pricing and reporting mechanism, and the news of the DTCC listing its ticker before the actual trading commenced certainly fuels speculation of the imminent launch.\n\n\u201cRumors are flying since the appearance of BlackRock\u2019s Bitcoin spot ETF ticker on a list at the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC), including that the world\u2019s largest asset manager has already started purchasing Bitcoin for the fund,\" Stefan Rust, CEO of independent inflation data aggregator Truflation said in an emailed statement. \"It could be we are seeing the early signs of the long-awaited 'Crypto Spring.' There is a sense that this U.S. ETF is actually real now\u2014after years and years of waiting.\"\n\nEdited by Liam Kelly.\n\nDisclaimer The views and opinions expressed by the author are for informational purposes only and do not constitute financial, investment, or other advice."

        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction as ETH Pumps Up 4.5% in 24 Hours \u2013 Where is the Next ETH Target?\n\nSource: TradingView\n\nThe Ethereum price has risen by 4.5% in the past 24 hours, with its surge to $1,669 happening as the cryptocurrency market recovers from its weekend selloff.\n\nIts current price means that it has risen by 6.5% in a week and by 8% in the last 30 days, with the altcoin also up by 39.5% since the start of 2023.\n\nAnd with ETH being possibly the most fundamentally sound coin in the market, it has every chance of enjoying further gains as the year progresses.\n\nIndeed, with the upcoming Shanghai upgrade and with the coin becoming deflationary post-Merge, there could be a rush into it in the coming months.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction as ETH Pumps Up 4.5% in 24 Hours \u2013 Where is the Next ETH Target?\n\nETH\u2019s chart is painting a bullish picture at the moment, with its relative strength index (purple) jumping up to 60, having been at an oversold 30 a few days ago.\n\nSource: TradingView\n\nIn addition, the coin\u2019s 30-day moving average (red) has begun rising further above its 200-day (blue), indicating the emergence of a new bullish trend.\n\nOf course, it\u2019s not clear for how long such a trend may last, although if ETH can break through the $1,700 resistance level, things may continue a little while longer.\n\nThere\u2019s a good chance of this happening, given what Ethereum has on the horizon.\n\nAs noted above, it\u2019s currently awaiting the Shanghai upgrade, which is due at the end of this month, or early April.\n\nShanghai will enable the withdrawal of staked ETH.\n\nWhile some have argued that the update will result in a surge of selling pressure, others have suggested that the long-term effect will be to attract more institutions to the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\ngm, let's make today happen: https://t.co/sqrX3fpwLk\n\n\n\nJoin 650+ of us to discuss the impact of the #Ethereum Shanghai Upgrade on the institutional adoption of staking. \ud83d\udc4f\n\n\n\n11:00 AM EST | 3:00 PM GMT | 4:00 PM CET pic.twitter.com/qt9T6OcJya \u2014 Staking Rewards | Staking Summit \ud83c\uddf9\ud83c\uddf7 (@StakingRewards) March 14, 2023\n\nThe ability to withdraw staked ETH will ultimately be a positive for the coin, since it de-risks staking for users, assuring them that their funds can be easily withdrawn.\n\nAt the same time, Shanghai also provides the technical underpinnings for future Ethereum upgrades, including sharding, which will provide massive scalability improvements when it goes live (most likely next year).\n\nThis is already bullish enough for ETH as it is, yet there are other reasons to be optimistic about the altcoin\u2019s prospects.\n\nFor one, the coin has become deflationary since last September\u2019s Merge, in combination with the earlier EIP 1559 upgrade (which results in the burning of fees).\n\nI know everyone is euphoric from Bitcoin pumping but don\u2019t forget that Ethereum is deflationary and burning tokens like we\u2019re at a bonfire.\n\n\n\nThere simply will not be enough coins for everyone. pic.twitter.com/2uD1eJNMoI \u2014 wab.eth (@wabdoteth) March 13, 2023\n\nIndeed, ETH now has a tendency to become deflationary during peak periods of traffic in that it often burns more tokens than it generates.\n\nThis strengthens the bull case for ETH, yet so does recent adoption news.\n\nMost notably, Coinbase announced last month that it\u2019s launching its own layer-two sidechain for Ethereum, dubbed Base.\n\n1/ \ud83d\udd35 We\u2019re excited to announce @BuildOnBase.\n\n\n\nBase is an Ethereum L2 that offers a secure, low-cost, developer-friendly way for anyone, anywhere, to build decentralized apps.\n\n\n\nOur goal with Base is to make onchain the next online and onboard 1B+ users into the cryptoeconomy. pic.twitter.com/RmwZFJzGGs \u2014 Coinbase \ud83d\udee1\ufe0f\ud83d\udcde (@coinbase) February 23, 2023\n\nWhat\u2019s significant about this is that Coinbase is aiming to use Base to \u201conboard 1B+ users into the cryptoeconomy.\u201d In other words, it\u2019s aiming to onboard 1B+ users into the Ethereum economy.\n\nThis can only increase Ethereum and ETH usage over time, amplifying the deflationary effects mentioned above, as well as increasing demand for ETH more generally.\n\nOther positive news for Ethereum includes February\u2019s announcement from Visa that it\u2019s testing USDC stablecoin payments on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nTaken with the Coinbase news, this suggests that most big firms will end up opting for Ethereum if they decide to use a public, permissionless blockchain.\n\nAs such, the market can expect ETH to rise steadily over the course of the year, even if the next month or so may be rocky due to the unfolding banking crisis.\n\nStill, once ETH passes $1,700, it could end up reaching $2,000 by the second half of the year before potentially rising to $2,500 by the start of 2024.\n\nBuy Ethereum Now\n\nIs Now A Good Time to Buy Ethereum?\n\nWhile ETH\u2019s fundamentals are rock-solid, it may not experience a big rally until the successful completion of the Shanghai upgrade, due in April.\n\nAs such, investors and traders may prefer to look at other high-potential coins in the market right now, with many offering short-term (as well as long-term) gains.\n\nWe\u2019ve reviewed such coins in a list of the top 15 cryptocurrencies for 2023, as analyzed by the Cryptonews Industry Talk team.\n\n\n\nThe list is updated weekly with new altcoins and ICO projects.\n\nDisclaimer: The Industry Talk section features insights by crypto industry players and is not a part of the editorial content of Cryptonews.com."

        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction as ETH Experiences a 5% Weekly Decline \u2013 Is the Bearish Trend Set to Continue?\n\nSource: TradingView\n\nEthereum has dipped again today, with its fall to $1,550 representing a 0.5% decline in 24 hours and a 5% drop in a week that has been largely negative for the cryptocurrency market.\n\nThis loss of momentum also means that the ETH price has fallen by 8% in a fortnight and 2% in the last 30 days, although the market\u2019s biggest altcoin remains up by 29.6% since the beginning of the year.\n\nIt\u2019s picture therefore remains pretty mixed, yet its overselling in the past few weeks has likely set the asset up for a rebound in the coming days and weeks, especially when its fundamentals remain as strong as ever.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction as ETH Experiences a 5% Weekly Decline \u2013 Is the Bearish Trend Set to Continue?\n\nEthereum\u2019s price has been taking a beating for a couple of months now, with the coin\u2019s indicators looking very weak since the middle of August, when the overall market suffered a big drop.\n\nSource: TradingView\n\nETH\u2019s relative strength index (purple) has fallen from nearly 70 at the start of the month to 35 this morning, and while it has inched up slightly in the past few hours it still looks weak, meaning that the coin is being oversold.\n\nIt\u2019s much the same with ETH\u2019s 30-day exponential moving average (yellow), which continues to slide even further below its 200-day average (blue), providing another indication of strong selling pressure.\n\nPossibly the most discouraging signal right now is that provided by the token\u2019s support level (green), which has actually declined in the past few days, meaning that ETH may not be able to resist further dips in the next few days.\n\nHowever, while further minor falls may be possible in the very near future, the sheer fact that ETH has been so heavily sold recently should mean that, sooner or later, traders begin swooping in to buy the coin at an attractive discount.\n\nIndeed, ETH is so undervalued relative to its fundamentals that now is a very good time to buy the altcoin, which more than any other alt can be expected to make a full recovery.\n\nAs we\u2019ve repeatedly reported, Ethereum continues to dominate the crypto ecosystem in terms of TVL, with its own network and that of its main layer-twos (e.g. Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon and Base) accounting for about 63% of the sector\u2019s total TVL.\n\nAnd it continues to grow and develop, with this month seeing the launch of the Holesky testnet, which will help Ethereum work towards the eventual rollout of proto-Danksharding (which will greatly improve scalability).\n\nThe first Lido deposit on Holesky is here \ud83c\udf89https://t.co/rLfNzj7OeE pic.twitter.com/7YHI3yol4X \u2014 Lido (@LidoFinance) October 6, 2023\n\nEthereum also continues to attract more major adoption than its main rivals, as attested by PayPal\u2019s recently announced stablecoin, as well as by Visa\u2019s ongoing stablecoin pilot.\n\nAs such, ETH can be expected to return to $1,700 in the next few weeks, with a bullish end to the year potentially pushing it beyond $1,800.\n\nNew High-Return Altcoins\n\nETH should arguably be included in almost every cryptocurrency portfolio, yet it isn\u2019t the only altcoin with a high potential for growth at the moment.\n\nThere are also a number of newer alts emerging at the moment, with many of these holding presales that could end with successful exchange listings.\n\nOne of

becoming.\n\nWhat has set TG.Casino apart from superficially similar platforms is that it\u2019s based largely on Telegram, with games and bets being announced and conducted on the messaging app.\n\nThe use of Telegram is enabling TG.Casino to cultivate a large and thriving community, which will not only provide the platform with users and holders, but which will also help recruit

At press time, the wallet still holds 3,900 ETH worth approximately $6.5 million.\n\nButerin has made a series of transactions amid the recent market downturn that has been flagged by several crypto observers. On Sunday, he repaid 251,000 Rai Reflex tokens on Maker and subsequently liquidated 1,000 worth around $1.6 million according to data from lookonchain.\n\nWhile it is not clear why Buterin moved the assets to Coinbase, the transaction has sparked a debate around social media circles with some users speculating a sale of the asset as the market continues to slide into the red zone.\n\nThe crypto market has worn a bearish outlook through the weekend as top assets like Bitcoin (BTC) and ETH recorded losses of 11% and 8% respectively.\n\nThe speculation of a sell-off is made worse by the declining prices of BTC and ETH in the past seven days. The price of ETH stands at $1,660 below the $1,800 resistance level and down 10.35% in the last seven days.\n\nBTC on the other hand trades at $26,000 with bears and analysts speculating a much lower price for the leading asset.\n\nButerin\u2019s latest transaction was also preceded by a test transaction of 0.1 ETH made two days ago.\n\nNot to worry? Buterin made similar transactions\n\nVitalik Buterin has admitted to selling parts of his ETH portfolio over the past five years although most of those transactions have been to Kraken.\n\nSince the start of the year, Buterin has moved $3.6 million worth of assets to Gemini and Kraken with this recent transaction to Coinbase raising the figure to $4.6 million.\n\nData from CoinGecko shows that the aftermath of Buterin\u2019s last transaction on June 7 led to a 14% drop in the asset although similar transactions have not led to a significant drop.\n\nAside from Buterin\u2019s transaction, an Ethereum whale that participated in the assets Initial Coin Offering (ICO) in 2014 moved around $320,000 worth of ETH on Aug 20.\n\nThe receiver of the assets from the dormant address purchased around $15,000 worth of UNIBOT tokens and $15,300 worth of APE tokens before making a subsequent transfer of 15.8 ETH to the HitBTC exchange."

        "content": "Bitcoin Price and Ethereum Prediction: DOGE Soars 35%, Will BTC and ETH Follow Suit?\n\nThe cryptocurrency market has experienced many ups and downs lately, but things are looking positive now. This trend may be attributed to the improving global economy and lower inflation rates.\n\nBitcoin, one of the most well-known cryptocurrencies, has gained significant traction recently, surpassing the $29,000 mark for the first time since June 2021.\n\nThis year, BTC, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency, has seen an increase of approximately 70%.\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum, the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency, has reached $1,858 levels, its highest since August 2022. Ethereum has risen by over 9.8% this month and nearly 50% this year.\n\nElon Musk\u2019s Twitter Update Sends Dogecoin Soaring\n\nDogecoin (DOGE) has experienced a surge in value once again, thanks to an update on Elon Musk\u2019s Twitter profile. The tech billionaire changed his profile picture to a Shiba Inu, the breed of dog that inspired the creation of the meme-based cryptocurrency.\n\nAs a result, the price of DOGE shot up by 35%, causing a stir in the crypto community.\n\n\ud83d\udea8 Breaking news! \ud83d\udea8 Twitter just got a doge-over! The Twitter logo has been replaced with the iconic Doge in dogecoin! \ud83d\udc36\ud83d\ude80 #ToTheMoon #DogeFam #CryptoTwitter \ud83e\ude99\ud83d\udc15 pic.twitter.com/4cKGFi8wyA \u2014 Arslan B. (@forex_arslan) April 3, 2023\n\nThis is not the first time that Musk has influenced the value of DOGE through his social media activity, with his tweets and comments about the digital asset often causing significant price movements.\n\nBitcoin Sees Positive Growth Amidst Banking Crisis and Lower Interest Rates\n\nThe cryptocurrency market has been performing well recently, and many people are optimistic about it. Bitcoin, the most valuable cryptocurrency, has increased by approximately 70% this year and is currently valued at over $28,000.\n\nIt saw a rise of about 20% in March, the largest increase since January 2023. As of now, the global crypto market capitalization is $1.17 trillion, up 1.09% in the last 24 hours.\n\nHow did you start Tuesday morning?\n\n\n\nCuz this is how the #crypto market is doing today, April 4, 2023, with #Bitcoin staying pretty much the same compared to yesterday. #CoinMarketCap #CMC #crypto #cryptocurrency pic.twitter.com/1nryPK3BgZ \u2014 CoinMarketCap (@CoinMarketCap) April 4, 2023\n\nHowever, the current surge in the cryptocurrency market could be attributed to the ongoing banking crisis, which has led the Federal Reserve to retract from rate hikes.\n\nWhen interest rates are high, investors tend to avoid risky assets like cryptocurrencies. However, with falling interest rates, more people are considering investing in Bitcoin.\n\nIn general, investors tend to turn to alternatives such as cryptocurrencies during times of financial uncertainty or instability in traditional banking to ensure their financial security and stability.\n\nThis provides people with an alternative to the traditional banking system to maintain their financial independence.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Shanghai Upgrade\n\nEthereum is switching to a new Proof of Stake mechanism, which will make the network more secure, quicker, and able to process more transactions. The upgrade is called the Shanghai upgrade and it will switch Ethereum\u2019s way of verifying transactions from using a lot of electricity to using how much Ethereum users hold.\n\nThereby, this would be better for the environment and makes it easier for individuals to utilise Ethereum. Hence, this will help the ETH to gain further traction.\n\nBitcoin Investors Cautious \u2013 Eyes on Economic Indicators and Macro Factors\n\nThis week, investors are paying close attention to U.S. economic releases, with the nonfarm payroll data being the main focus. Traders are looking for any signs of labor-market weakness that could affect the Federal Reserve\u2019s policy.\n\nThese incoming data are prompting traders to avoid aggressive bids. Meanwhile, Inflation, financial instability, and regulatory changes might all have an influence on the Bitcoin market and produce major price fluctuations.\n\nBitcoin Price\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price is experiencing a downward correction from the $28,800 area. If there is a definitive move below the $27,500 support, BTC could see increased bearish momentum. The cryptocurrency managed to rise above the $28,500 resistance level, but struggled to accelerate towards the $28,800 and $29,000 levels.\n\n\n\nImmediate resistance is situated around the $27,820 level, near the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward movement from the $28,595 swing high to the $27,578 low. The next key resistance is around the $28,100 zone and the trend line, close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward movement from the $28,595 swing high to the $27,578 low.\n\n\n\nBitcoin Price Chart \u2013 Source: Tradingview\n\n\n\nIf Bitcoin\u2019s price cannot surpass the $28,100 resistance, it may initiate another decline. Immediate downside support is around the $27,600 zone. The following major support is near the $27,500 zone. If the price breaks below the $27,500 support, it could trigger a new decline. The subsequent major support is around the $27,000 level, below which the price might test the $26,600 level.\n\nBuy BTC Now\n\nEthereum Price\n\nEthereum\u2019s price remained robust above the $1,750 support zone. ETH ascended and tried to break through the $1,840 resistance zone, but unlike Bitcoin, it didn\u2019t manage a clear move above $1,840.\n\n\n\nThe price reached as high as $1,828 before experiencing a downward correction. While it fell below the $1,800 level, the price remained above the $1,750 support zone. A low was established near $1,762, and the price is now climbing.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf Ethereum fails to surpass the $1,825 resistance, it may initiate a downward correction. The first support on the downside is close to the $1,785 level and the trend line.\n\nBuy ETH Now\n\nTop 15 Cryptocurrencies to Watch in 2023\n\nKeep yourself informed about the latest ICO projects and altcoins by frequently referring to the handpicked selection of the 15 most promising cryptocurrencies to monitor in 2023, which has been suggested by the specialists at Industry Talk and Cryptonews.\n\nDisclaimer: The Industry Talk section features insights by crypto industry players and is not a part of the editorial content of Cryptonews.com.\n\nFind The Best Price to Buy/Sell Cryptocurrency"

        "content": "Long Dormant Ethereum Whale Suddenly Stakes 49K ETH \u2013 Here\u2019s How Increased Staking Participation Can Boost ETH\u2019s Price\n\nA long-dormant Ether whale who participated in the Ethereum Initial Coin Offering (ICO) might be about to stake a massive 32,015 ETH tokens, according to on-chain analytics-focused Twitter account @lookonchain.\n\nWe noticed that an ETH ICO participant who has been dormant for 6 years started to stake 48,992 $ETH ($80M) in October this year.\n\n\n\nThe ICO participant received 120K $ETH at Genesis via 3 addresses.\n\n\n\nAnd transferred 32,015 $ETH($53M) to a new address 5 hrs ago. (stake again? ) pic.twitter.com/huO4PVBpUB \u2014 Lookonchain (@lookonchain) January 22, 2023\n\nThe ICO participant staked 48,992 ETH back in October, ending six years of dormancy at the time. According to @lookonchain, the whale transferred 32,015 ETH tokens to a new address earlier this week, which they think the whale may be about to stake.\n\nThe Ethereum ICO whale received 120,000 ETH tokens at the genesis of the Ethereum mainnet in 2015 across three separate wallets. If they do stake a further 32,015 tokens, that means the whale will have staked 67.5% of the 120,000 tokens they received at the Ethereum ICO.\n\nMore ETH Shifts Towards Staking\n\nThe above-noted whale\u2019s (possible) shift towards staking a greater portion of its ETH holdings reflects a shift in the ETH market. ETH staking first became possible on the beacon chain back in late 2020.\n\nBut up until now, most ETH owners have opted not to stake their tokens, despite attractive yields of currently around 7-8% for node operators and 4-5% for staking pool participants.\n\nThat\u2019s because, at the moment, staked ETH tokens cannot be withdrawn. According to Ethereum, the lack of flexibility in staked ETH withdrawals was to protect the network\u2019s integrity as it transitioned from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake.\n\nBut that transition has now been completed (the \u201cMerge\u201d took place last September). And Ethereum developers are working on the blockchain ecosystem\u2019s next big upgrade, the so-called \u201cShanghai\u201d hard fork that is currently scheduled to take place before the end of March.\n\nThe upcoming upgrade will allow staked ETH to be withdrawn for the first time. While withdrawals won\u2019t be immediate, the shift towards greater withdrawal flexibility seems to be attracting more ETH owners to staking.\n\nSince September 2022, when the merge took place, the number of staked ETH has risen by about 2.7 million ETH to 16.2 million, meaning that currently around 13.5% of the ETH supply is locked in staking. That\u2019s still a far cry from staking participation on Ethereum rival Cardano\u2019s blockchain, which has a participation rate of over 70%, thanks for its flexible withdrawals. But the trend seems to be towards rising staking participation.\n\nHow Higher Staking Participation Can Boost ETH\u2019s Price\n\nStaking itself is a positive for ETH\u2019s price \u2013 why own a cryptocurrency that offers no yield whatsoever when you could own a cryptocurrency that offers a predictable yield, many crypto investors may ask.\n\nBut up until now, the lack of flexibility in withdrawals was deterring investors who value liquidity over a steady yield. Now ETH investors can have (closer to) both. As ETH staking participation rises, that should boost ETH for a few reasons.\n\nFirst of all, it encourages HODLing, with HODLers guaranteed to get at least a 5-8% return (depending on whether they are a node operator or staking pool participant) on their staked ETH, regardless of market conditions.\n\nAssuming a majority of those attracted into staking given its new flexibility do end up HODLing their ETH tokens, this also results in a reduction of the generally available supply of ETH tokens. Ether buyers will essentially be fielding sell offers from a smaller pool of willing sellers.\n\nMany analysts think that a shift to increased staking participation could be a key driver of long-term appreciation in the price of ETH. As crypto matures as an asset class and price fluctuations tend towards that which is normal in traditional financial markets, many expect major financial institutions to become increasingly drawn to ETH staking, with some referring to ETH as the bond of the crypto universe.\n\nOther drivers of long-term ETH appreciation are expected to be factors such as the blockchain\u2019s continued efforts to upgrade (sharding could make Ethereum more scalable later this year), its continued mainstream adoption (non-zero balance addresses should soon hit 100 million) and the fact that it is now a deflationary asset.\n\nEthereum Alternatives\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for other high-potential crypto projects alongside ETH, we\u2019ve reviewed the top 15 cryptocurrencies for 2023, as analyzed by the CryptoNews Industry Talk team.\n\n\n\nThe list is updated weekly with new altcoins and ICO projects.\n\nDisclaimer: The Industry Talk section features insights by crypto industry players and is not a part of the editorial content of Cryptonews.com."

        "content": "Share:\n\nBitcoin price rallied nearly 15% as it overcame the $30,000 psychological level.\n\nEthereum price has shot up 12% in the last two days, clearing $1,727, a key resistance level.\n\nRipple price has risen above the $0.540 resistance level, but it is uncertain whether bulls will defend this barrier.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price has kick-started a massive rally in the third week of October, dragging Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP) and other altcoins to follow its lead. The rally seems to be driven by a potential spot Bitcoin ETF approval.\n\nRead more: Bitcoin price nears $35,000 after BlackRock\u2019s iShares BTC trust listing on DTTC and Grayscale victory upheld\n\nBitcoin price sustains 2023 bull rally\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price has sustained the 2023 bull rally by producing a fourth higher high. This bullish move has propelled BTC past the $30,000 psychological level, currently trading around $34,152.\n\nThe next hurdle that Bitcoin price will encounter is $36,294, where a potential top might form, especially if the circumstances around the spot ETF approval remain the same. On the other hand, if a spot ETF is officially approved, it could catalyze a massively bullish ascent that could propel BTC to the $40,000 psychological level.\n\nBTC/USD 3-day chart\n\nOn the off chance that this rally is a fluke, Bitcoin price could retrace to the immediate support levels of $31,777 and $30,616. These barriers are key to producing another lower high, but a breakdown of these levels could send BTC down by 15% to $25,941.\n\nIf Bitcoin price produces a three-day or weekly candlestick close below $25,941 support level, it will create a lower low on a higher time frame. This move would put an end to the 2023 bull rally and potentially send BTC down to $19,294.\n\nEthereum price shoots up\n\nEthereum (ETH) price cleared the key hurdle of $1,727 as it rallied 11.48% in the last two days. This move has caused the Relative Strength Index (RSI) to increase above the 50 mean level, showcasing the spike in bullish momentum.\n\nBulls need to sustain above this $1,727 level, after which investors can expect the extension of the uptrend to the next critical level of $2,030.\n\nETH/USD 3-day chart\n\nOn the other hand, if Ethereum price fails to sustain above $1,727, it would denote a bearish outlook. In such a case, investors can expect the bearish trend to take over and trigger a correction to $1,551.\n\nRipple price at crossroads\n\nRipple price has cleared the $0.500 and $0.540 resistance levels after a 12% rally in the last five days. This move has been successful in partially collecting the buy-side liquidity resting above the $0.547 level.\n\nGoing forward, investors need to exercise caution as XRP price is likely to pull back to retest the $0.540 level. Another bounce from here could see the remittance token extend its rally to retest the next key hurdle at $0.668. This move would constitute a 22% upswing.\n\nRead more: Ripple price could kickstart 140% rally to $1.23 after SEC's \u201csurrender\u201d\n\nXRP/USD 3-day chart\n\nOn the other hand, if Ripple price breaks below the $0.540 barrier, it would signal that the bullish momentum is not strong enough. In such a case, XRP price is likely to fall back to find support at the $0.500 and $0.469 levels."

Investors have reacted to this data and have actively pursued trades within the market.\n\nChina\u2019s 31 provinces and cities have declared economic growth target including GDP of 2023. 23 of them lowered GDP growth target, 5 raised it. GDP growth is set between 4% and 9.5%. Tianjin is 4%, Beijing is 4.5%, others are higher than 5%.Hainan is the highest, 9.5%.#China #GDP pic.twitter.com/evUl74d57o \u2014 Vince Ye (@VinceYe6) January 16, 2023\n\nIn reality, everything has been working in favor of digital assets, including better-than-expected China GDP figures, increased Bitcoin blockchain activity, cooling inflation, and growing institutional crypto adoption.\n\nFurthermore, the United States was regarded as one of the most welcoming countries for people looking to spend their cryptocurrency on shopping, which has played a significant role in supporting cryptocurrency prices.\n\nUS Retail Sales Figures Could Be Key To Market Movement\n\nWith the US retail sales figures set to be released today, investors and traders in the crypto space are paying close attention. The figures will provide insight into consumer spending and confidence, which could have a significant impact on the direction of the market.\n\nBusy night ahead for markets:\n\n\u2013 Eurozone CPI (Dec)\n\n\u2013 US PPI (Dec)\n\n\u2013 US retail sales (Dec)\n\n\u2013 US industrial production (Dec)\n\n\u2013 3 x Fed officials speak\n\n\u2013 Charles Schwab & Alcoa earnings \u2014 CommSec (@CommSec) January 18, 2023\n\nWith trading volumes up significantly from last week, it is clear that investors are anticipating a shift in market sentiment due to these figures.\n\nAccording to a survey conducted by Bloomberg, it is expected that there will be a 0.8% decrease in retail sales \u2013 this would be the biggest drop since 2022 and it would mark the 3rd decline in four months.\n\nRetail Sales \u2013 Source: Forexfactory\n\nExcluding auto and gas, retail sales are projected to dip by 0.2%, the first time there will have been two consecutive months of declines since April/May 2021. Auto sales were below expectations, and the average cost of unleaded gasoline fell by 7.5% for the sixth month in a row.\n\n2/\n\nUS Retail Sales\n\n\n\nDecember retail sales are expected show a rebound to +0.1% MoM thanks to holiday spending and travel.

The opposite is true if there's an upside beat. pic.twitter.com/C7Lxv5ijgC \u2014 Trading Tank (@TheTradingTank) January 16, 2023\n\nAnalysts predict that if retail sales figures come in better than expected, it could put pressure on cryptocurrencies due to a stronger US dollar.\n\nBitcoin Price\n\nCurrently, the price of a single Bitcoin stands at $21,276 with a 24-hour trading volume of $24 billion. Most impressive is its growth over the past 24 hours, jumping up 0.50% and over 22% in the last seven days.\n\nBitcoin price predictions have not changed much since our previous forecast on January 17th. Sadly, Bitcoin was unable to break the $21,400 mark and is likely going through a price correction now. T\n\nhe closing of candles below this level is signaling that buyers are exhausted and sellers may enter the market if Bitcoin fails to break the $21,400 resistance.\n\nBitcoin Price Chart \u2013 Source: Tradingview\n\nBoth RSI and MACD are exhibiting an overbought condition, which could be another reason why investors might expect a bearish correction in BTC. The closing of Doji candles just below this level could also indicate a bearish movement in the near future.\n\nOn the lower side, Bitcoin\u2019s immediate support is at the $20,800 level, and a break below this could lead to further selling until the $20,000 mark. Below this, further selling may occur until it reaches around $19,250.\n\nFurthermore, an increase in demand for Bitcoin could drive it past the $21,400 threshold and propel it toward the $22,850 mark.\n\nEthereum Price\n\nEthereum, the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency today, has experienced a solid 18% increase in its price over the past seven days. It is currently being traded at an all-time high of $1,580.\n\nEthereum prices have been rising steadily, currently found above the major support level of $1,500. If this point is maintained well, it could lead to a rise toward the next resistance level of $1,660.\n\nEthereum Price Chart \u2013 Source: Tradingview\n\nOn the downside, a bearish breakout below the $1,500 level could send ETH price toward the $1,450 or $1,410 levels.\n\nEthereum is currently exhibiting bullish trends, with the market price for ETH at over $1,550 and the potential to reach its next resistance level of $1,650.

        "content": "Bitcoin and Ethereum Prices Soar 20% \u2013 How High Can The Cryptocurrency Markets Go?\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum prices have been on a wild ride lately, shooting up 20% in the last week alone. This surge has sparked speculation about how high the cryptocurrency markets can go.\n\nWith more people turning to cryptocurrencies to safeguard their wealth and take advantage of opportunities, understanding the potential of these markets is essential.\n\nCould this recent rally be just the start of something bigger?\n\nOn January 15th, the market for cryptocurrencies was in positive territory. The total market capitalization was over 2 trillion dollars, which represented a 0.53% increase compared to the previous day. Significantly, trading volume declined by 16.66%, amounting to 84.28 billion dollars over 24 hours.\n\nThe amount of funds being held in Decentralized Finance (DeFi) has now risen to $12.76 billion, representing 15.14% of the total crypto market 24-hour trading activity. Similarly, the value of stablecoins is now reaching a staggering $67.57 billion, accounting for 80.17% of all crypto trades made over the past 24 hours.\n\nOne of the Largest US Institutions Teaches Bitcoin\n\nDuring the first Bitcoin course, the professor said there would be another course focusing on programming Bitcoin. Students will have an exciting opportunity to build a Bitcoin library from scratch and learn how it works.\n\nBitcoin and cryptocurrency courses are becoming increasingly popular at U.S. colleges, including the latest to join this trend: Texas A&M University with its 74,000+ students. Classroom adoption of these courses is on the rise due to their relevance in today\u2019s world.\n\nI will be teaching the first ever Bitcoin class at Texas A&M this spring! \u2014 Korok Ray (@KorokRay) January 12, 2023\n\nOn January 13, Professor Korok Ray made an announcement that a course on Bitcoin protocols will be taught to students of the College of Engineering and Mays Business School at Texas A&M. The class will kick off on the 17th of January, when the spring semester starts.\n\nIt took months to get this class approved, but we made it! Getting Bitcoin into the curriculum is important for the long game. \u2014 Korok Ray (@KorokRay) January 12, 2023\n\nRay said in a four-part Twitter thread that \u201cProgramming Bitcoin\u201d will go into detail about the Bitcoin Protocol and teach students how to build their own Bitcoin library from scratch.\n\nThis will definitely help promote Bitcoin and the adoption of cryptocurrencies, increasing their demand in the future.\n\nBitcoin Price\n\nBitcoin is performing amazingly, having surged to $20,911. It has even breached the $20,500 support level. An astonishing $27 billion has been traded during the last 24 hours.\n\nThe bullish price increase has created a pathway for the uptrend to reach $21,000 or even further, with the potential of reaching its trading goal at $23,000.\n\nBitcoin Price Chart \u2013 Source: Tradingview\n\nBitcoin currently has an immediate support level of $20,500-$20,000 and the RSI & MACD indicators are indicating an overbought market.\n\nTherefore, it is essential to observe if BTC is capable of breaking through a resistance level of $21,500 since any failure to do so could result in its price going down. On the lower side, Bitcoin\u2019s immediate support prevails at $20,000.\n\nEthereum Price\n\nEthereum\u2018s price reached $1,559 with a 24-hour trading volume of $14 billion. This significant rise past the $1,500 key resistance shows that ETH/USD pair is on its way to breaching the next barrier level of $1,650.\n\nAt this time, the critical support mark for Ethereum currently stands at $1,500. If it closes above this price point, we can expect to see a surge in its value. If it reaches beyond $1,650 then the price of ETH might move up to the next resistance level of $1,700.\n\nEthereum Price Chart \u2013 Source: Tradingview\n\nAlthough there is a support level for ETH near $1,500, a bearish break of this point could cause the price to drop further to $1,400. However, at present, the trend looks positive so it could be a good opportunity to invest in this asset.\n\nAltcoins With Major Growth Potential Right Now\n\nWith the cryptocurrency sector booming, several alternative currencies have been gaining prominence and they offer great potential gains for early investors.\n\nFightOut (FGHT)\n\nWith the FightOut platform, you can get the same service as a personal trainer, but this time you pay with FGHT tokens. Pre-paid workout has never been simpler!\n\nThe FGHT presale has been a success, gathering over $2.90 million in investments. All activities associated with the metaverse avatar are tracked and can be used to further enhance its performance metrics.\n\nAs the sale progresses, it\u2019s expected that the current exchange rate of 60.06 FGHT per $1 (which can be purchased using ETH or USDT) will increase in value.\n\n\n\nVisit FightOut Now\n\nC+Charge (CCHG)\n\nC+Charge is creating blockchain-based EV payments software that will give EV drivers carbon credits every time they charge for the first time. C+Charge sees this as a means of leveling the playing field in the carbon credit market, which has previously been dominated by a few large firms.\n\nEarning carbon credits is an extra incentive for C+Charge to accelerate the already rapid transition to EVs. Analysts predict that the voluntary credit market (VCM) will reach $100 billion by 2030, with businesses like C+Charge playing a big part in this growth. So far, the presale has raised $282,467.\n\nVisit C+Charge Now\n\nMeta Masters Guild (MEMAG)\n\nMeta Masters Guild, a mobile-focused gaming guild that will create a combination of Web3 and play-to-earn games, has begun its presale. Its Ethereum-based games will have playable NFTs as well as incentives that can be swapped for MEMAG, the company\u2019s native token, which can then be staked and sold. It will be issued in seven stages, the first of which will deliver one MEMAG for $0.007.\n\nThis price will eventually rise to $0.023, representing a 228.5% increase for early investors even before MEMAG becomes public. Meta Masters Guild is projected to grow fast when the platform\u2019s first game (Meta Kart Racers) is released in the second quarter of this year. Furthermore, if the world market and economy improve, the native coin may benefit greatly.\n\nVisit Meta Masters Guild Now\n\nFind The Best Price to Buy/Sell Cryptocurrency"

        "content": "Ethereum Name Service Allegedly Hacked by SiegedSec \u2013 Here\u2019s the Latest\n\nSource: AdobeStock / Tomasz Bidermann\n\nA tweet from Dominic Alvieri, a cybersecurity analyst and security researcher, sent shockwaves through the crypto community as it claimed that the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) had fallen victim to a breach, resulting in data being dumped by SiegedSec.\n\nLaunched in 2017 by Nick Johnson, Ethereum Name Service, a distributed and decentralized naming system operating on the Ethereum blockchain, simplifies complex identifiers, such as lengthy hexadecimal strings and crypto wallet addresses, into more readable and user-friendly wallet names.\n\nENS serves the purpose of facilitating the sharing and memorization of Ethereum blockchain addresses.\n\nRather than sharing a convoluted address like \u201c0x4h42j34298sd68\u201d for receiving payments on your Ethereum wallet, ENS enables the purchase of human-readable domain names, like \u201cjohndoe.eth,\u201d making it significantly easier to remember and utilize addresses within the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nAmid initial skepticism about Dominic\u2019s warning, with questions raised about the dumping of already public data, another tweet from @officer_cia, a threat researcher, provided evidence of SiegedSec\u2019s announcement about the hack through its Telegram channel.\n\nThe message from SiegedSec revealed their acquisition of data from three databases, including that of Ethereum Name Service.\n\n\u201c~mmmmm yummm, Siegedsec brings to you the goodies of 3 databases coming from Ethereum Name Service, The-people fitness, & TMS or The Masonry Society. well over 10GB included here !!!!!!!1!!1!\u201d\n\nThe group ascertained that the data trove exceeded 10GB and contained sensitive information, including usernames, hashed passwords, authentication access tokens, LockLizard account details, and more.\n\nAs the crypto community grappled with the implications of this data breach, questions arose about the nature of the downloaded data and whether it was publicly scraped information.\n\nSome members intended to examine the data more closely. Regardless, cautionary advice was circulated to change passwords and cross-verify the configuration of ENS settings, ensuring that resolved addresses remained intact.\n\nSiegedSec\u2019s Attempt to Hack Ethereum Name Service (ENS) Fails; Data Found to be Non-Sensitive\n\n\n\nFollowing thorough examination by several members, it has been unequivocally established that the data claimed to be \u201chacked\u201d by SiegedSec contains only Ethereum Name Service (ENS) names.\n\nhttps://x.com/officer_cia/status/1701582194433495123?s=20\n\nAdditionally, the hash mentioned is merely the hexadecimal representation of the token ID.\n\nTo summarize, this incident does not constitute a leak of sensitive or private information. The data alleged \u201cleaked\u201d appears to be on a public database.\n\nSince Russia invaded Ukraine and the ensuing global cyber war, many new offensive cyber cells emerged. While some are strictly hacktivist, targeting entities in Russia, others exploit the momentum of the cyber onslaught for more sinister and self-serving cybercriminal activities.\n\nAmong them is SiegedSec, a cyber cell led by the prominent hacktivist YourAnonWolf. It has significantly amplified its impact by claiming many victims in recent months.\n\nSince its emergence in late February 2022, SiegedSec has demonstrated its capability to deface and compromise numerous websites, and databases, especially government-owned ones.\n\nThese defacements have been marked by juvenile and crude language and graphics.\n\nIn April 2022, SiegedSec boldly declared they had successfully defaced over 100 domains. They provided evidence through a hosting chat dialogue, revealing that account passwords had been altered and the defacements rectified.\n\nHowever, they subtly hinted that they retained access to these domains.\n\nWhile SiegedSec is known for its notorious activities in the centralized sector, its effort to hack into Ethereum Naming System, a decentralized platform backed by the Ethereum blockchain, is a failure."

        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction as Bloomberg Analyst Expects ETH to Outperform BTC in the Next Bull Market \u2013 Time to Buy?\n\nSource: TradingView\n\nThe Ethereum price has risen by 0.5% in the last 24 hours, slightly exceeding the wider cryptocurrency market\u2019s increase over the same period. At $1,215.91, its current price represents a 7.5% drop in a week and 6% gain in a month, with these movements coming at a time of ongoing instability for the market, which continues to be plagued by rising interest rates and fears surrounding the financial health of various trading platforms.\n\nDespite the continued uncertainty, some analysts are confident that Ethereum (ETH) will perform strongly when wider market conditions improve. In fact, yesterday saw Bloomberg analyst \u2014 and noted bitcoin bull \u2014 Mike McGlone predict that ETH is likely to outperform BTC during the next bull market, as suggested by its relative outperformance of the original cryptocurrency since 2021.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction as Bloomberg Analyst Expects ETH to Outperform BTC in the Next Bull Market \u2013 Time to Buy?\n\nETH\u2019s chart suggests an increase in momentum and a potential end-of-year rally. Its relative strength index (purple) has risen from 40 in the past couple of days, indicating an increase in upwards buying pressure.\n\nSource: TradingView\n\nSimilarly, ETH\u2019s 30-day moving average (red) has begun climbing towards its 200-day average (blue), something which potentially heralds a breakout rally if it crosses the longer term indicator.\n\nRegardless of when exactly ETH moves from its current level, analysts are confident that it will beat many other coins during the market\u2019s next bull phase. As stated above, this is the opinion of Bloomberg\u2019s Mike McGlone, who tweeted yesterday that the ratio of ETH\u2019s price to BTC\u2019s has been more or less increasing since early 2021, during the previous bull market.\n\nBitcoin crosses series; Ethereum may be top candidate to continue outperforming the first born crypto \u2013#Ethereum's advances vs. #Bitcoin have been unshaken by 2022 deflation in most risk assets and may be gaining underpinnings. pic.twitter.com/mLRMO4vpQr \u2014 Mike McGlone (@mikemcglone11) December 20, 2022\n\nMcGlone expects this trend to continue once the cryptocurrency market (and global economy) becomes more bullish again, and it\u2019s certainly arguable that ETH\u2019s fundamentals put it in a good position to achieve this.\n\nTo begin with, September\u2019s Merge put Ethereum on the path to becoming more scalable and efficient, while its shift to proof-of-stake (as well as other upgrades) now means that it\u2019s very close to becoming deflationary. As the tweet below from Velvet Capital explains, periods of increased network activity tend to tip it over into being deflationary, something which will become more evident with more use and adoption.\n\n#Ethereum becomes deflationary when the token's burn rate (from transaction fees) is greater than the staking reward for validators\n\n\n\nPoS ETH has only existed for a few months\n\n\n\nIn the next bull run, ETH may become even more deflationary with more people using Crypto regularly pic.twitter.com/Edpq0jrZR7 \u2014 Velvet.Capital (@Velvet_Capital) December 21, 2022\n\nEthereum is already the biggest layer-one blockchain in terms of total value locked in, accounting for around 58.8% of the entire DeFi sector. It\u2019s arguable that such dominance is only going to increase in the future, as its upgrades enable it to pull further ahead of its rivals.\n\nInterestingly, recent data has revealed that whales and big investors have begun accumulating ETH at the fastest rate for two years, potentially preparing themselves for the next bull run and the profits they will make at the expense of people who come late to the party.\n\nEthereum whales are accumulating $ETH at the highest rate in two years \ud83d\udc33 pic.twitter.com/V5UVGNc2Uc \u2014 Crypto-Gucci.eth \u1d4d\u1d50\ud83e\udd87\ud83d\udd0a (@CryptoGucci) November 29, 2022\n\nIn other words, now is likely a good time to buy ETH. It\u2019s currently 75% down on its all-time high of $4,878, a price that it may exceed during the next bull market.\n\nPresale Coins\n\nAlmost needless to say, investors may have to wait more than a few more months for the next bull market. As such, they may prefer to look at coins with better short-term prospects, and in 2022 presale tokens have stood among the most promising categories for less time-consuming gains.\n\nFor example, Lucky Block (LBLOCK) and Battle Infinity (IBAT) witnessed increases as high as 6,000% and 3000% during the summer, compared to their initial presale prices of $0.00015. Likewise, Tamadoge (TAMA) rose by as much as 1,800% after listing for the first time in October.\n\nWhile there\u2019s no guarantee that the three presale coins below will match such performance, they each come with excellent fundamentals, giving them as a good a chance as any of enjoying notable returns once they list in the New Year.\n\nFightOut (FGHT)\n\nFightOut (FGHT) is a move-to-earn fitness app that, running on the Ethereum blockchain, combines real-life workouts with Web3. Building on the foundations laid by earlier M2E platforms, it tracks and rewards a wide variety of workouts, including boxing, weightlifting and yoga, while also offering in-app and IRL courses.\n\nLaunched last week, its token sale has already raised over $2.2 million, with $1 currently buying you 60.06 FGHT tokens.\n\n\n\nVisit FightOut Now\n\nDash 2 Trade (D2T)\n\nAlso running on Ethereum, Dash 2 Trade is a trading intelligence platform that provides investors with real-time analytics and social trading data, helping them to stay ahead of the cryptocurrency market and build more informed portfolios.\n\nThe sale of its D2T token has raised over $10.3 million and is now in its final stage. It has also announced listings on BitMart, Changelly Pro and LBANK Exchange for early 2023, with the first due on January 11.\n\nVisit Dash 2 Trade Now\n\nC+Charge (CCHG)\n\nBased on Binance Chain, C+Charge (CCHG) is a new peer-to-peer payment system for electric vehicle (EV) charging stations, having the aim of widening access to carbon credits. It has just launched the presale for its native CCHG token, which is used within its network by EV owners to pay to charge their vehicles.\n\n\ud83d\udc9c @C_Charge_Token presale is officially LIVE! \ud83c\udf89\ud83d\udd25\n\n\n\nWith $CCHG, users can pay for their #EV charges at our partnered charging stations and receive carbon credits! \ud83d\ude80\n\n\n\nJoin C+Charge's green revolution and make an impact! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\n\n\n\nBuy $CCHG now!!\n\n\n\n\u27a1\ufe0fhttps://t.co/thmnZ78WyF pic.twitter.com/fqahenDDu9 \u2014 PurpleDude (@purpledudenft) December 20, 2022\n\nOne of the interesting features of C+Charge is that it will also reward users with carbon credits for charging their EVs at its stations.

The new feature is known in technical circles as Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP)-4895.\n\nAllowing withdrawals of staked ETH is a highly anticipated feature given that users who have staked their ETH on Ethereum\u2019s new proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain so far have been unable to withdraw \u2013 or \u2018unstake\u2019 \u2013 their tokens.\n\nZhejiang will go live at 15:00 UTC on Wednesday, February 1st.\n\nBut although the testnet launches on Wednesday, Ethereum Foundation engineer Barnabas Busa said on Twitter this week that regular users will still have to wait for 6 more days to try out the simulated withdrawals. For now, these users can deposit ETH to the testnet\u2019s validators, and then withdraw them starting on February 7.\n\nThe Zhejiang public testnet is going live tomorrow (1st of Feb 15:00 UTC, 2023). Shanghai+Capella will be triggered 6 days later (at epoch 1350). You will be able to deposit validators, practice BLS change and exit without risk.

The testnet got off to \u201ca very rocky start\u201d according to Busa, who added that the network later stabilized.\n\nWe had a very rocky start due to resource exhaustion. Our first attempt had too few nodes, second attempt had too little CPU/RAM. The third attempt was to scale the machines up a bit, and now it seems a lot healthier and more stable. Pictures show the CPU/RAM utilization of 24h. pic.twitter.com/XgYJEnsBXO \u2014 Barnabas Busa (@BarnabasBusa) January 26, 2023\n\nShanghai upgrade on track\n\nWithdrawals of staked ETH is an important part of the next major upgrade of the Ethereum network known as the Shanghai hard fork.\n\nIn a developer call last month, Ethereum core developer Marius Van Der Wijden said that progress toward the Shanghai upgrade is good.\n\n\u201cThings are looking great. I\u2019m not aware of any issues that could delay Shanghai at this moment,\u201d Van Der Wijden said in the call.\n\nThe confirmation that things are on track for the Shanghai hard came after developers agreed to take out several EIPs related to the EVM Object Format (EOF) that were supposed to be part of Shanghai. According to the developers, EOF will now instead be included in a separate Ethereum upgrade sometime in the third quarter this year."

        "content": "Ethereum Founder Vitalik Buterin Credits Ordinals NFTs for Reviving a \u201cBuilder Culture\u201d on Bitcoin\n\nShutterStock\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has shared insights regarding new developments on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nIn a July 7 Twitter Spaces session , Buterin spoke with Bitcoin proponents Eric Wall and Udi Wertheimer, suggesting a thing or two Bitcoin could learn from Ethereum developers.\n\nThe co-founder said the advent of Bitcoin Ordinals, the Bitcoin layer for NFTs, revived the \u201cbuilder culture\u201d on the network.\n\nButerin Suggests Ways to Expand Bitcoin Functionality Without Compromising Scalability\n\nButerin hailed Ordinals and the BRC-20 token standard, which he views as a shift away from the stagnant politics in the Bitcoin ecosystem.\n\nHe said that ordinals are starting to bring back a culture of actually doing things.\n\nThe Ethereum co-founder believes the advent of Bitcoin Ordinals is a pushback to the \u201claser-eye\u201d Bitcoin Maxi movement, which he thinks is good. The lengthy conversation focused on scalability issues.\n\nContributing to the topic, Wall claimed the Bitcoin Lightning Network is inadequate for future scalability and often fails when processing medium-sized payments.\n\nIn response to Wall\u2019s comment, Buterin recommended the developers focus on implementing various layer-2 solutions. He also suggested the developers seek ways to make the Bitcoin base layer more efficient.\n\n\u201cI think focusing on rollups is good, and so being open to ZK-snark-based scaling solutions,\u201d Buterin said.\n\nConcurring with Buterin, Wertheimer believed introducing zero-knowledge rollups could create a beneficial effect on the Bitcoin network.\n\nWertheimer said If we adopted rollups for Bitcoin, we get an execution environment too, and we can add smart contracts.\n\nBitcoin Maxis React\n\nFor context, Wall and Wertheimer are two figureheads behind the Ordinals project Taproot Wizards.\n\nBoth Bitcoin proponents have been staunch advocates of Ordinals, often pushing for increasing Bitcoin network functionality.\n\nHowever, their stance attracted criticism from Bitcoin fundamentalists who claim Smart Contracts and NFTs dilute Bitcoin\u2019s primary peer-to-peer cash functionality.\n\nThese critics include Samson Mow, Jan3 CEO, who believes Ordinals are a waste of block space that could go for Bitcoin payments.\n\nReacting to the criticisms, Wall explained that Bitcoin could work as a proof system for zero-knowledge proofs, which won\u2019t congest the network.\n\nWall said:\n\nMy perspective is, we Bitcoiners always wanted to do DeFi adjacent things, but we wanted the Bitcoin base layer to act as sort of a Judge or an arbiter of the computation and not have to run the computation on-chain.\n\nWall noted that second layers don\u2019t have to be only for payments but can also serve other purposes.\n\nAs expected, this discussion stirred controversy in the Bitcoin community. Wertheimer slammed Mow and Adam Back, Blockstream CEO, for standing against the conversation with Buterin.\n\nWertheimer tweet ed saying these two laser-eyed clowns have been running Blockstream into the ground for the last decade. In ten years, that company couldn\u2019t produce a single successful product.\n\nYet they think they have nothing to learn from Ethereum."

        "content": "Grayscale Pursues Ethereum Spot ETF Amid ETH Futures ETF Boom\n\nGrayscale Investments files with the SEC to convert its $4.96 billion Ethereum Trust into a spot Ethereum ETF / Photo by DrawKit Illustrations on Unsplash\n\nToday, Grayscale Investments, a leading digital asset fund manager, submitted a filing to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), to convert its Ethereum Trust into a spot Ethereum ETF.\n\nThe move comes as other financial companies like Vaneck, Bitwise, and Proshares launch Ethereum Futures ETFs.\n\nA Calculated Move for Grayscale\u2019s Ethereum Trust\n\nGrayscale has formally lodged a Form 19b-4 with the SEC, looking to turn its Ethereum Trust into a physically-backed ETF on the NYSE Arca exchange.\n\n\u201cAs we file to convert ETHE to an ETF, the natural next step in the product\u2019s evolution, we recognize this as an important moment to bring Ethereum even further into the U.S. regulatory perimeter,\u201d Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein told Globe Newswire.\n\n\ud83d\udea8 @Grayscale has filed to convert Grayscale Ethereum Trust to a spot ETF. $ETHE\n\n\n\nThank you for your continued support \u2014 our team is just getting started! https://t.co/3nNtfe4Nns \u2014 Sonnenshein (@Sonnenshein) October 2, 2023\n\nThe Grayscale Ethereum Trust, established in March 2019, currently manages assets worth nearly $5 billion.\n\nThe timing of Grayscale\u2019s Form 19b-4 filing is important, coinciding with the launch of Ethereum Futures ETFs from other financial players like Vaneck, Proshares, and Bitwise. While these companies have moved forward with futures-based offerings, Grayscale seeks to create a spot Ethereum ETF, differentiating its approach from competitors.\n\nGrayscale is not only focused on its spot Ethereum ETF but also has plans to convert its Bitcoin Trust into a spot ETF. It is facing legal complications with the SEC over the approval of this conversion, however.\n\nFuture Plans: More Than Just a Spot Ethereum ETF\n\nIn addition to its efforts to establish a spot Ethereum ETF, Grayscale also has plans to launch an Ethereum Futures ETF based on cash-settled CME futures contracts, pending regulatory approval.\n\nDavid LaValle, Grayscale\u2019s global head of ETFs, noted that the filing was \u201canother important milestone as Grayscale continues to build its best-in-class ETF team, product suite, and capabilities\u2014serving investors as a globally respected asset manager with unmatched crypto expertise.\u201d\n\nIn short, Grayscale\u2019s move to convert its Ethereum Trust into a spot Ethereum ETF comes at a time when the market is seeing a surge in Ethereum Futures ETFs. While other firms are focusing on futures-based products, Grayscale\u2019s pursuit of a physically-backed offering could set it apart.\n\nThe company\u2019s ongoing regulatory challenges and planned expansions indicate that Grayscale is working on multiple fronts to solidify its position in the ETF market."

The global oil price 90-day volatility index sits at 41% creating a new trend described by Dessialava Ianeva, a lead analyst at Kaiko as \u201cunusual.\u201d\n\nHistorically BTC and ETH have remained more volatile than oil and other assets although the trend in the last three months shows the asset hovering around the $30,000 mark.\n\nKnown for its volatility, last year BTC and ETH lost over 55% of their market values following a rocky patch in the woods for the entire ecosystem.\n\nAs this year marks new beginnings, the price of BTC has surged 80% year to date (YTD) recording another huge leap in volatility.\n\nPer the research, oil tops multiple assets evaluated by Kaiko from crypto, gold, and tech-driven Nasdaq. Even so, the volatility index of oil has fallen in the past twelve months as it stood at 63% in July 2022.\n\nMarket volatility is the degree or frequency of change in the price of an asset over a period of time. Risky assets are often characterized by high volatility as they swing faster, opening investors to higher risks.\n\nWider macroeconomic factors and market trends\n\nAnalysts at Kaiko cite the geopolitical tension characterized by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine leading to global sanctions and China\u2019s poor reopening after economic gripping Covid measures.\n\nIaneva also stated that Bitcoin\u2019s volatility reduced as \u201cthe asset continues to mature.\u201d As more adoption trickles into the market, it becomes less volatile compared to its formative years.\n\nFinally, the research highlighted liquidity as another on-chain factor behind the drop in volatility. Ianeva explained that for the past few months, leading assets like BTC, ETC have recorded lows in terms of trade volumes and liquidity.\n\nWith the recent regulatory crusade in the US market, investors have become a little skeptical of the direction of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in approving a spot BTC ETF.\n\nOn the bright side, the approval of a spot ETF though months away, could turn the tide pushing the price of BTC and the general market capitalization to new highs."

        "content": "Ethereum Users Propose ERC 7265 to Thwart DeFi Hacks \u2013 How Does it Work?\n\nSource. AdobeStock / Sergey Nivens\n\nMembers of the Ethereum community have proposed a new standard meant to improve the security of decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols and mitigate hacks.\n\nThe attacks on DeFi protocols have become all too common, draining billions in user funds. According to DeFiLlama, around $6.6 billion was stolen in exploits so far, with $5.31 billion of that going to DeFi protocol hackers.\n\nBuilder Diyahir argued in a blog post that, \u201cno amount of audits, insurance, and white-hat hacker rewards will stop hackers from finding clever ways to extract value from a growing public honey pot.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne line of code is the difference between working as intended and completely wrecked.\u201d\n\nThe new standard \u2013 ERC (Ethereum Request for Comments) 7265, proposed by Diyahir, tcb_00, and real_philogy \u2013 would enable protocols to integrate a \u201ccircuit breaker,\u201d adding a back-stop to smart contracts, which would stop tokens from leaving those contracts, thus preventing the scenario in which all funds get stolen.\n\nPer the proposal,\n\n\u201cThis standard outlines a smart contract interface for a Circuit Breaker that triggers a temporary halt on protocol-wide token outflows when a threshold is exceeded for a predefined metric.\n\nDevelopers would have the ability to specify if the circuit breaker contract should delay settlement and \u201ctemporarily custody outflows\u201d during the cooldown period, or if it should revert on attempted outflows.\n\nThis is meant to give flexibility to developers and assure correct internal accounting for protocols.\n\nVery excited to be collaborating on this.\n\n\n\nCircuit breaker TL;DR:\n\n\n\nAllows devs to easily add a back-stop in their contract that stops assets *before* they leave the contract in the event of a hack. \ud83d\udd12 https://t.co/6blNUM8bID \u2014 philogy (@real_philogy) July 3, 2023\n\nMore Time to Protect Funds\n\nWhen a protocol is attacked, it commonly loses everything and its total value locked (TVL) drops to 0 in seconds.\n\nMeir Bank of Fluid Protocol said that most protocols lack sufficient response time to react to a hack. By the time anyone even notices the issue, it\u2019s already too late.\n\nThe new standard may be a solution.\n\nPer Diyahir, the attacks will still happen no matter what. However,\n\n\u201cThe goal here is not to entirely end hacks but to extend the actionable period that the protocol has to address the situation.\u201d\n\nERC 7265 would prevent the attacker from draining an entire contract, while the majority of funds lost would be recovered, claimed Bank.\n\nA circuit breaker is only appropriate for projects which are already upgradeable, and it does not add any additional centralization, Diyahir said.\n\n6/ The Circuit Breaker is intended for protocols which are upgradeable by governance, which make up the majority of DeFi today.\n\n\n\nThese protocols and their assets are already fully controlled by governance, so there is no added centralization risk. \u2014 Meir Bank (@MeirBank) July 3, 2023\n\nThis is still a proposed standard, meaning that the Ethereum community would need to pass it, while the core team would need to accept it as the final standard and implement it as such.\n\n____\n\nLearn more:\n\n\u2013 Report: Over $204 Million Lost to DeFi Hacks and Scams in Q2\n\n\u2013 Attacker Siphons $10 Million in Crypto From Poly Network \u2013 Here\u2019s What Happened\n\n\n\n\u2013 What is DeFi?

        "content": "Bitcoin Price and Ethereum Prediction \u2013 Trust Wallet Token Pumps 85%\n\nDespite the ongoing uncertainty in the cryptocurrency market, Bitcoin is mostly unchanged, consolidating in a narrow trading range of $15,800 to $17,200. With a price range of $1,175 to $1,280, Ethereum, the second-most valuable cryptocurrency, is also trading sideways.\n\nEven if the global crypto market value gained 0.16% to $836 billion on the previous day, major cryptocurrencies were trading in the red early on November 18.\n\nThe overall volume in DeFi was $2.62 billion, accounting for 5% of the total 24-hour volume in the crypto market. Moreover, the overall volume of all stable coins was $48.64 billion, accounting for 93% of the total 24-hour volume of the crypto market.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at the top 24-hour altcoin gainers and losers.\n\nTop Altcoin Gainers and Losers\n\nLitecoin (LTC), UNUS SED LEO (LEO), and Aptos (APT) are three of the top 100 coins that have gained value in the last 24 hours. The LTC price has soared by more than 7% to $62, the LEO price has grown by more than 7% to $4.15, and the APT price has increased by nearly 6.5%.\n\nTop Altcoin Gainers and Losers \u2013 Source: Coin360\n\nSolana (SOL) has dropped more than 4% in the last 24 hours to trade at $13.65. Synthetix (SNX) has plunged by more than 3.5% in the last 24 hours to trade at $1.75.\n\nTim Draper Predicts Bitcoin: Will It Reach $250,000?\n\nTim Draper, a well-known venture capitalist, recently told Bloomberg that the price of Bitcoin could reach $250,000 and even go beyond that incredibly bullish price target.\n\nAlthough the market has dropped significantly, Draper is unwavering in his prediction.\n\n\u201cIt will take a moment when you can buy your food, your clothing, and your shelter all in Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nHe continued by saying that women are responsible for eighty percent of all consumer expenditures. Draper is certain that they will succeed in popularizing Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s gotta move pretty quickly when women realize they can save money by paying in Bitcoin, and when stores realize they can double their profits by accepting Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nThe venture capitalist who has predicted repeatedly that Bitcoin\u2019s price will be able to hit $250,000 by the end of 2023 was an early backer of such successful companies as Skype and Hotmail.\n\nEl Salvador\u2019s President Will Buy Bitcoin\n\nEl Salvador, which in September 2021 became the first country in the world to recognize Bitcoin as a legal currency, has resumed its BTC purchases after suspending for several months as the market experienced a pessimistic attitude.\n\nEl Salvador\u2019s president, Nayib Bukele said that beginning on November 17, the Central American nation would begin daily purchases of Bitcoin. The announcement came almost three months after the country\u2019s last BTC purchase in July 2022.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until September 2021 that El Salvador officially recognized Bitcoin as a legal tender. There was a bull market in bitcoin at the time, which made it seem like the country could make money on any investment it made because the price of bitcoin was constantly breaking records.\n\nHowever, by the second quarter of 2022, El Salvador\u2019s early BTC purchases seemed like a dangerous play that resulted in large losses as the bear market began to take hold.\n\nJUST IN: \ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddfb El Salvador's $105 million #Bitcoin investment is now worth $41.5 million. \u2014 Watcher.Guru (@WatcherGuru) November 10, 2022\n\nData shows that the average price paid for El Salvador\u2019s 2,381 BTC holdings is $43,357. Therefore, the country spent close to $103.23 million to buy Bitcoin, whereas the current price of one Bitcoin is $39.4 million. There may not be much cause for optimism regarding the future of Bitcoin in El Salvador in light of the recent crypto winter.\n\nHowever, if the country can hold out until the next bull cycle, it may be able to recoup its losses with ease. The repurchases may also be good for BTC/USD since they attract new investors.\n\nBitcoin Price\n\nThe current Bitcoin price is $16,802, and the 24-hour trading volume is $27 billion. Bitcoin has gained over 1% in the last 24 hours. CoinMarketCap currently ranks first, with a live market cap of $352 billion, up from $349 billion.\n\nIt has a maximum supply of 21,000,000 BTC coins and a circulating supply of 19,210,375 BTC coins.\n\nBitcoin Price & Tokenomics \u2013 Source: coinmarketcap\n\nBitcoin is settling into a broad trading range of $16,000 to $17,000, with a breakout determining future price action.\n\nAt the moment, Bitcoin is facing immediate resistance near the $17,250 level, and a cross above this has the potential to lead BTC toward the next resistance area of $18,100.\n\nBitcoin Price Chart \u2013 Source: Tradingview\n\nOn the lower side, Bitcoin\u2019s immediate support prevails at $16,300, and a bearish breakout of this can open further room for selling until $15,800.\n\nEthereum Price\n\nThe current price of Ethereum is $1,218, with a 24-hour trading volume of $8 billion. In the last 24 hours, Ethereum has jumped over 1%. With a live market cap of $149 billion, CoinMarketCap currently ranks second. It has a circulating supply of 122,373,866 ETH coins.\n\nEthereum Price & Tokenomics \u2013 Source: coinmarketcap\n\nA bullish retracement has occurred on the daily chart, and Ethereum has reclaimed the $1,220 mark. On the 4-hour timeframe, Ethereum has formed a symmetrical triangle pattern, which is signaling indecision among investors and also keeping the price of ETH supported at $1,202.\n\nEthereum faces immediate resistance at 1,260 from the 50-day moving average. Whereas, above this, a double top pattern is likely to extend resistance near $1,280. If the bullish crossover above $1,280 holds, the recovery could speed up to $1,350 or $1,400.\n\nEthereum Price Chart \u2013 Source: Tradingview\n\nSupport is still around $1,170 or $1,095. If ETH falls below this level, it may approach $1,000, or $881, but this is improbable for the time being.\n\nTrust Wallet Token Pumps 85%\n\nTrust Wallet Token is currently trading at $2.19 with a 24-hour trading volume of $165 million. In the last 24 hours, Trust Wallet Token has dropped 1.24%, but has gained over 85% in the last seven days. CoinMarketCap currently ranks #44 with a live market cap of $910 million.\n\nThere are 416,649,900 TWT coins in circulation, with a maximum supply of 1,000,000,000 TWT coins.\n\nTWT Price Chart \u2013 Source: Tradingview\n\nOn the technical front, TWT has completed the 50% Fibonacci retracement at $1.85 and has bounced back to continue its uptrend.\n\nA triple-top pattern is currently blocking the way to the upside at $2.35, and a bullish breakout could lead TWT to $2.65.\n\nPresale Cryptocurrency With Enormous Potential Gains\n\nDash 2 Trade (D2T)\n\nDash 2 Trade, developed by the Learn 2 Trade service, offers market-driven insights, trading signals, and prediction services to investors.

        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction: ETH Up 0.5% with $6 Billion Trading Volume \u2013 Are Whales Accumulating?\n\nSource: TradingView\n\nThe Ethereum price has risen by 0.5% in the past 24 hours, reaching $1,866 as the cryptocurrency market enjoys a similar gain today.\n\nETH is now down by 2% in a week but up by 14% in the last 14 days, with the market\u2019s biggest altcoin also increasing by 56% since the beginning of the year.\n\nAnd with its 24-hour trading volume now passing $6 billion, ETH could be in line for further gains in the next few days, especially when there have been signs of big whale transfers involving the cryptocurrency.\n\nOf course, ETH\u2019s fundamentals mean that, even if it doesn\u2019t rally in the short term, it will almost certainly see sustained increases over the medium and long term.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction: ETH Up 0.5% with $6 Billion Trading Volume \u2013 Are Whales Accumulating?\n\nETH has seen a slight uptick in the past hour, with its chart and indicators reflecting this apparent increase in momentum.\n\nSource: TradingView\n\nFor one, its relative strength index (purple) has jumped from just under 40 yesterday to just over 50 today, indicating a growth in buying pressure that has plenty of room to intensify further.\n\nSimilarly, its 30-day moving average (yellow) has flattened out after looking as though it might be falling towards its 200-day average (blue), something which could indicate further gains to come.\n\nThis suspicion is strengthened by ETH\u2019s support level (green), which has risen over the past couple of weeks and which is now forming an interesting pennant with the altcoin\u2019s resistance level (red).\n\nThis implies that a break should be coming in the next few days, with ETH\u2019s price action converging on a point at which it could see a big move in either direction.\n\nHowever, given ETH\u2019s fundamentals and general position, it\u2019s more likely that such a move is up (rather than down).\n\nThis argument is supported by the fact that whales have spent much of the week apparently selling ETH, suggesting that they are now due to begin accumulating the coin again.\n\nMore importantly, if there\u2019s one altcoin that should be rising when the market becomes more bullish, it\u2019s Ethereum.\n\nIt continues to account for the lion\u2019s share of the DeFi market, while its introduction of staking has resulted in some 23 million ETH \u2013 about 20% of the altcoin\u2019s supply \u2013 being taken out of circulation.\n\n\ud83d\udca5 Staked ETH surpasses 23 million in June\n\n\n\n\u25feEthereum's staking ratio continues to rise since the network upgrade in April. \u2014 Elja (@Eljaboom) June 29, 2023\n\nCombined with the burning of transaction fees, this all points to a future in which ETH\u2019s supply is increasingly squeezed, and in which demand for the token ramps up as a result.\n\nBy extension, this also points to a gradually rising price for Ethereum over the long term, while it should also be pointed out that ETH hasn\u2019t been labelled as a security by the SEC (unlike Cardano, Solana, Polygon, and numerous other alts).\n\nFrom its current level of just below $1,900, it\u2019s likely to return to $2,000 in the next few weeks.\n\nAnd by the end of the year, it could easily climb to $2,500, with a potential bull market in 2024 pushing it beyond $3,000 once again.\n\nNew Meme Tokens Promise Big Gains\n\nAs fundamentally sound as ETH remains, it\u2019s unlikely that it will see any huge growth spurts in the coming months, with its appreciation likely to be more gradual and longer term.\n\nTraders looking for more immediate gains may therefore prefer to look towards newer altcoins that still haven\u2019t experienced any initial rallies yet, with presale tokens among the most promising sources of such rallies.\n\nOne of the newest presale coins at the moment is Thug Life Token (THUG), a meme token that has adopted the trappings of gangsta rap and hip-hop culture in a bid to attract investors.\n\nIt launched its presale only a couple of days, and has already raised more than $100,000.\n\nTwitter Bio updated with website, there and only there you find official social channels and early stealth launched presale for $thug. pic.twitter.com/mdDdQ0JkFl \u2014 Thug Life Token (@thug_life_token) June 28, 2023\n\nWith a maximum total supply of 4.2 billion THUG, Thug Life Token has allocated 70% of this total to the presale, meaning that ownership over the new meme token will really be in the hands of its community.\n\nIn contrast to many other recent token offerings, the presale will have only one stage, which makes THUG available at a price of $0.0007.\n\nThe sale will end after hitting its hard cap of $2,058,000, meaning that it\u2019s basically already 5% of the way there.\n\nGiven that meme tokens have probably been the biggest success story in crypto this year, THUG has every chance of rallying massively once it launches on exchanges in the next few weeks.\n\nInvestors can buy some by going to the official Thug Life Token website and connecting their software wallets, with THUG buyable using ETH, USDT or fiat currency.\n\nVisit Thug Life Token Now\n\nDisclaimer: Crypto is a high-risk asset class.
