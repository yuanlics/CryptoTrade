        "title": "Bitcoin vs. Ethereum: A Detailed Comparative Study - Clarion Ledger",
        "content": "William Mullane\n\nContributor\n\nAs the digital age moves ahead, the Bitcoin vs. Ethereum debate continues to captivate financial markets globally. Bitcoin enjoys worldwide recognition and the highest market cap in the industry, whereas Ethereum stands as a versatile contender, enriching the crypto ecosystem with its multifaceted functionality and solidifying its place as the second most valuable cryptocurrency. Investors, faced with the formidable task of selecting between these two titans, are in dire need of an in-depth comparison to make well-informed decisions. This is where this detailed article can bridge the information gap, providing you with the clarity required in this dynamic crypto race.\n\nWhat follows is a comprehensive comparison of the two, exploring their underlying technology, investment potential, and future prospects, delivering a compelling argument for prospective investors and blockchain enthusiasts alike.\n\nInitially, it is vital to recognize the foundational technology that underpins these cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin, the vanguard of digital currencies, operates on a simple, unalterable blockchain technology, ensuring a secure, decentralized ledger for transactions. Its primary purpose is to serve as a digital substitute for traditional fiat currencies. Ethereum, conversely, expands upon this foundational blockchain concept by integrating \u201csmart contracts\u201d\u2014autonomous scripts that execute transactions when predefined conditions are met. This enables Ethereum to function not just as a currency but as a platform for decentralized applications (dApps), thus providing a broader functionality.\n\nTransitioning from technology to investment potential, the inherent characteristics of both Bitcoin and Ethereum significantly influence their respective financial value. Bitcoin's greatest investment appeal lies in its scarcity; with a predetermined limit of 21 million bitcoins, it is often likened to \u201cdigital gold.\u201d This artificial scarcity has fueled its value, rendering Bitcoin an intriguing hedge against inflation. Ethereum, however, holds a different investment proposition through its potential for growth. As the fuel for dApps, its utility extends beyond being a mere currency, which could potentially lead to increased demand and, subsequently, value.\n\nSimultaneously, it's crucial to cast an analytical eye on the future prospects of these cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin, with its robust security and simplicity, is steadily gaining acceptance as a viable form of payment, hinting toward a promising future. Yet, its lack of a broader technological use poses a challenge to its long-term relevance. Ethereum, on the other hand, is projected to undergo significant technological upgrades, such as the transition to Ethereum 2.0. This shift towards a more energy-efficient model, paired with its increasing utilization in the burgeoning field of decentralized finance (DeFi), suggests a future of endless possibilities.\n\nWhile Bitcoin and Ethereum are currently industry leaders, their future depends on a multitude of factors, including regulatory pressures, market sentiments, and technological advancements. However, it is crucial to remember that the world of cryptocurrency is replete with risk and unpredictability. Investors are strongly advised to conduct thorough research and consult with financial advisors before venturing into the turbulent seas of cryptocurrency investments.\n\nWhile Bitcoin and Ethereum share the common foundation of blockchain technology, their purposes, investment potential, and future prospects diverge significantly. With its straightforward operation and scarcity-based value, Bitcoin offers a stable yet limiting experience. Ethereum's more complex and innovative approach provides a wider array of applications but requires a higher tolerance for potential volatility. Choosing between these two depends largely on an individual's investment goals and risk tolerance. If you're interested in staying informed about the latest developments in the cryptocurrency market, including the Ethereum price and Bitcoin price, it's suggested to follow reputable sources and stay up-to-date on market trends. As the crypto saga continues to unfold, these digital currencies\u2019 distinct characteristics will shape their respective journeys, influencing the future of the digital financial market.\n\nThis is for informational purposes only.

        "title": "Standard Chartered says Ether could reach $8,000 by 2026 as blockchain upgrades continue - Fortune",
        "content": "Despite Ether\u2019s recent lackluster performance, at least one multinational bank estimates that by the end of 2026 the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap could hit an all-time high.\n\nEther was trading near a six-month low, just above $1,500 at time of publication, according to CoinGecko, as its overall share of the crypto market has declined two percentage points since January to 17%. (Meanwhile, Bitcoin is approaching 50% market dominance.)\n\nBut British bank Standard Chartered said in a Wednesday note that Ether could go on a tear that sees it reach $8,000. Eventually, the bank predicted, Ether could be worth $26,000 to $35,000 per token.\n\n\u201cWe think the path higher for ETH prices may take longer than for BTC, but we see ETH eventually reaching a higher price multiple than BTC relative to current levels (5.0x versus 3.5x),\u201d Geoff Kendrick, the head of crypto research and EM FX West at Standard Chartered, wrote in the note.\n\nCrypto market onlookers had hoped that a spate of newly launched Ethereum futures ETFs would boost inflows to the cryptocurrency, but that hasn\u2019t been the case so far. In their first week, six of the futures-based ETFs attracted just $10 million in investment, according to a report by CoinShares. For comparison, the first futures-based Bitcoin ETFs launched in 2021 brought in $1 billion in the first week, although interest in cryptocurrencies was higher then among investors.\n\nStill, Standard Chartered believes Ether has the potential to explode in value in part due to upgrades scheduled for its underlying blockchain, Ethereum, over the coming years. Last year, the blockchain took a leap forward with its much-hyped Merge update that switched the network to proof of stake from proof of work and reduced its carbon footprint by 99%. The most recent update in April, dubbed Shanghai, allowed validators on the blockchain to withdraw staked Ether.\n\nThe Standard Chartered analysts\u2019 notes mentioned a series of updates that will add \u201cdanksharding\u201d to the Ethereum network, helping boost its dominance in DeFi. Danksharding is meant to allow the blockchain to process 100,000 transactions per second.\n\nA possible rise in the popularity of blockchain gaming and tokenized real-world assets could also boost activity on the Ethereum blockchain, which would in turn increase Ether\u2019s price, the analysts wrote."

        "title": "NFTs: An Interesting Frontier in the Ethereum Ecosystem - Naples Daily News",
        "content": "William Mullane\n\nContributor\n\nStep into the marketplace of Ethereum, where sparks of innovation can ignite fresh paradigms. Amid this pulsating landscape, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have emerged as the latest beacon, a novel frontier promising a unique blend of artistry, technology, and lucrative investment.\n\nNFTs, the fascinating new kids on the Ethereum blockchain, are painting a revolutionary tableau on the vast canvas of digital transactions. Unlike cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ether, each NFT is unique, carrying distinct information that, much like a snowflake, cannot be replicated. This quality imbues NFTs with a special charm, unlike the aura surrounding an original piece of art amidst a sea of replicas.\n\nThe rise of NFTs in the Ethereum ecosystem traces an exciting trajectory that has left spectators, users, and investors agog. At their inception, NFTs might have seemed a quaint novelty, a charming aberration in the world of cryptocurrencies. Their uses ranged from digital artwork to digital pets and even collectibles, all underpinned by Ethereum's versatile blockchain technology.\n\nHowever, it didn't take long for the investment world to understand the potential inherent in these unique digital creations. With their sharp, forward-looking instincts, investors began to perceive the layers beneath the initial novelty. They saw the transformative potential of NFTs, underpinned by Ethereum's robust and reliable blockchain technology, which assures their uniqueness and ownership.\n\nNFTs, you see, are not just digital doodles or virtual trinkets. Instead, they are the gateways to an unseen universe of potential that extends beyond art and collectibles. They promise transformative applications in fields such as real estate, gaming, digital identity, and intellectual property rights.\n\nImagine owning a piece of virtual real estate, your ownership unequivocally established by the immutable records of the Ethereum blockchain. Picture yourself as the proud owner of exclusive, valuable in-game assets you can trade or sell, turning virtual victories into tangible wealth. What if you could keep your unique digital identity as an NFT, immutable and safe in the Ethereum ecosystem? Such are the tantalizing prospects that the NFT frontier holds.\n\nThe investment potential of NFTs is a lush, verdant field waiting to be sown with the seeds of vision and courage. Just as early adopters of Bitcoin were often rewarded with astronomical returns, so too could those who venture into the realm of NFTs reap substantial rewards. Of course, like any other, this frontier comes with its fair share of volatility and uncertainty, but those elements only add to the thrill of exploration and discovery.\n\nThe journey across this digital landscape, however, requires wisdom and discernment. Just as the gold rush had its fool's gold, so does the NFT landscape have its ephemeral mirages. Those who thrive here will be the ones who understand the terrain and who can differentiate between passing fads and lasting value. It's an ecosystem where the judicious thrive and the reckless falter.\n\nAs we stand at the cusp of this enticing new era, it's clear that NFTs within the Ethereum ecosystem are not just another development; they herald a seismic shift in the world of digital transactions and investments. We are participating in an unfolding saga that will likely shape the digital landscape for generations to come.\n\nThis is for informational purposes only. Please invest at your own risk.\""

        "content": "One of the largest banks in the world reportedly believes that the smart contract platform Ethereum (ETH) could soar by more than 2,100%.\n\nAccording to a new CNBC article, the UK-based bank Standard Chartered is predicting that Ethereum will eventually increase to as high as $35,000 after hitting $8,000 in about three years.\n\nGeoff Kendrick, an analyst at the London-based bank, says that increasing use cases and layer-2 scaling solutions built on Ethereum are among the reasons for the price forecast.\n\n\u201cWe think Ethereum\u2019s established dominance in smart contract platforms, along with emerging uses in gaming and tokenization, has the potential to push ETH to the $8,000 level by end-2026 [which is] a stepping stone to our long-term \u2018structural\u2019 valuation estimate of $26,000-$35,000.\u201d\n\nAccording to CNBC, Kendrick believes gaming and tokenization of real-world assets offer some of the greatest growth potential for Ethereum.\n\nHe also expresses optimism about planned Ethereum upgrades. In early 2024, Ethereum is slated to implement \u201cproto-danksharding,\u201d which would increase the network\u2019s transaction speed and lower transaction costs.\n\n\u201cLayer 2 scaling solutions\u2026 are likely to grow in importance over time, particularly as architecture upgrades expected in early 2024 sharply lower fees on these platforms. This should help to cement ETH\u2019s dominance in the smart contract space, thereby increasing its P/E (price to earnings) ratio over the next couple of years.\u201d\n\nWith ETH trading for $1,540 at time of writing, an increase to $35,000 would represent a 2,173% jump, while a move to $8,000 would be a 419% increase.\n\nStandard Chartered is the 43rd largest bank in the world with $820 billion of assets under management.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Bitcoin tech is suddenly in the spotlight after the publication by ZeroSync\u2019s Robin Linus of his \u201cBitVM\u201d paper, which outlines a plan to easily add smart contracts to the original blockchain. The announcement has generated enthusiasm in Bitcoin circles, since smart contracts are the key innovation behind the second-biggest blockchain, Ethereum, not to mention its hordes of imitators.\n\nAlso:\n\nIsraeli crypto firms scramble to deal with Hamas war.\n\nMore blockchain startups cut jobs as crypto winter drags on.\n\nAvalanche blockchain now used to track cannabis.\n\nYou're reading The Protocol, CoinDesk\u2019s weekly newsletter that explores the tech behind crypto, one block at a time. Subscribe here to get it every week.\n\nNetwork news\n\nRobin Linus, core contributor to ZeroSync and the author of the BitVM paper. (Robin Linus)\n\nBITCOIN\u2019S NEW PARADIGM? This week\u2019s publication of a research paper outlining the design for BitVM, \u201ca computing paradigm to express Turing-complete Bitcoin contracts,\u201d got bitcoiners buzzing on social-media forums. The big idea is that Ethereum-style smart contracts and might be coming to Bitcoin, raising the possibility of a existential transformation of the originally payments-focused blockchain \u2013 perhaps even a bigger development than the advent of NFTs earlier this year via the Ordinals protocol. \u201cBitcoin is about to become a lot smarter,\u201d according to one post on X. \u201cSomething really interesting cooking,\u201d wrote another. The author of the BitVM paper is Robin Linus, a core contributor to ZeroSync, a Swiss non-profit that\u2019s building tools for Bitcoin developers to use zero-knowledge proofs \u2013 a type of cryptography that has become one of the hottest trends of 2023 in the Ethereum ecosystem. \u201cBitVM is an amazing breakthrough because while there are many gaping holes right now in the BitVM, they are mostly solvable,\u201d Bob Bodily, CEO of Bioniq.io, a Bitcoin Ordinals marketplace, wrote in a post on X. One person went so far as to inscribe Linus\u2019s paper onto the Bitcoin blockchain. BitVM relies on computations performed off-blockchain and then verified on-chain using a setup similar to those found in so-called optimistic rollups on Ethereum. The details are quite technical, as evidenced by an article on the topic in Bitcoin Magazine that delved into the arcana of \u201cNAND gates.\u201d A poster on X put up a white flag, asking \u201cCan you explain BitVM in plain English?\u201d and then giving only two choices, \u201cNo\u201d and \u201cNo way.\u201d There were memes aplenty.\n\nStory continues\n\nHARSH WINTER: In the last edition of The Protocol, we recounted the rounds of layoffs coursing through the blockchain industry \u2013 at Chia Network, Chainalysis and Yield Protocol. Such moves come as digital-asset markets have stalled over the past several months, prolonging what many experts describe as an unusually harsh \u201ccrypto winter.\u201d According to the analysis firm Messari, fundraising for crypto startups has hit a three-year low. Well, over the past week, there\u2019s been more job cuts. CoinDesk broke the news this week that Blocknative, a provider of tools on the Ethereum blockchain, had reduced headcount by a third, which works out to about a dozen people. Last week, the crypto custody firm Ledger cut 12% of staff, or about 88 jobs, citing \u201cmacroeconomic headwinds\u201d that are \u201climiting our ability to generate revenue.\u201d Yuga Labs, the NFT company behind the Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT collection, eliminated an unspecified number of roles, even though it closed a $450 million funding round just 18 months ago, Unchained reported. In a statement on Yuga\u2019s website, CEO Daniel Alegre wrote that the company had \u201ca number of projects that, while well-intentioned, either spread the team too thin or required execution expertise beyond our core competencies.\u201d It bears pointing out that the broader economy doesn\u2019t seem to be suffering in the same way; the U.S. added 336,000 jobs in September, double analysts\u2019 forecasts, a government report last week showed.\n\nISRAELI CRYPTO FIRMS DEAL WITH WAR: The past week\u2019s surprise attack on Israel by Hamas fighters has upended the daily routines of crypto firms based in the Middle Eastern country, known as a haven for startups and tech companies. Several Israeli crypto executives and developers told CoinDesk they weren\u2019t experiencing severe business disruptions, especially since many of them work remotely. But already, many employees of the firms are getting called up to reserve duties in the army. There were the personal elements such as the stress \u2013 digesting the scope of the damage, and the tragedies \u2013 as well as coping with bare supermarket shelves and repeated siren warnings. One of the largest projects so far to come out of the disaster is Crypto Aid Israel, a campaign led by Israeli crypto firms to gather crypto donations to help citizens who have been affected or displaced by the ongoing war. Separately, a local media outlet reported that Israeli police have frozen cryptocurrency accounts linked to Hamas, working with the crypto exchange Binance. According to the Wall Street Journal, Hamas along with the militant groups Palestinian Islamic Jihad and their Lebanese ally Hezbollah received more than $100 million combined in crypto funding into their digital-currency wallets over the past couple years.\n\nAvalanche social app Stars Arena, which became a sudden sensation when it launched a week ago, generating enthusiasm in the market for the blockchain\u2019s AVAX tokens, suffered a reversal of fortune on Oct. 7 when it got drained of nearly all locked funds, some $3 million worth. The episode was attributed to a \u201cmajor security breach with the smart contract.\u201d WAIT THIS JUST IN: On Wednesday, the smart-contract address that launched the attack encoded a message into a blockchain transaction: \u201cI would like to cooperate.\u201d\n\nThorswap, a decentralized cross-chain crypto exchange, shifted into \u201cmaintenance mode\u201d after the infamous \u201cFTX Exploiter\u201d used a series of Ethereum transactions to move funds onto the platform; project says the action was taken after \u201cconsultation with advisors, legal counsel and law enforcement.\u201d\n\nALSO:\n\nActivist crypto investors scored a $2.5M bounty after mounting a campaign on FloorDAO.\n\nTokenized U.S. Treasuries arrive on Coinbase\u2019s Base blockchain with Backed\u2019s RWA token.\n\nBlockticity mints hemp and cannabis certifications on Avalanche blockchain.\n\nTaiwanese crypto trader\u2019s 6-cent fee leads to $310K win in tax-receipt lottery.\n\nProtocol Village\n\nHighlighting blockchain tech upgrades and developments.\n\n1.

The stall-out in this year\u2019s bitcoin price rally. Those are just a couple signs of the prolonged crypto winter. Here\u2019s another: a continued decline in funds raised by blockchain startups. Crypto firms raised $2.1 billion in the third quarter, down 36% from the prior quarter to the lowest in almost three years, according to a report last week from the analysis firm Messari. As the overall pie shrinks, investors are increasingly putting their money into early-stage startups rather than later-stage deals \u2013 \u201cindicative of strategic bear-market positioning as investors attempt to fund projects with asymmetric upside that can return greater multiples when market sentiment eventually shifts in a positive direction,\u201d according to Messari.\n\nCalendar"

        "content": "Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) blockchain\u2019s native cryptocurrency, Ether, is estimated to reach $8,000 by 2026-end, Standard Chartered Bank (SCB) research stated.\n\nThe bank\u2019s long-term structural valuation for Ether ranged between $26,000 to $35,000, as it had estimated back in September 2021. Geoffrey Kendrick, head of forex and crypto research at SCB, believed real-world use cases of Ether in gaming and tokenization could support the token\u2019s development.\n\nAlso Read: Tron Founder Justin Sun Is Dumping Ethereum, Holders Worry Whether Prices Will Fall\n\n\u201cWe think Ethereum\u2019s established dominance in smart contract platforms, along with emerging uses in gaming and tokenization, has the potential to push ETH to the $8,000 level by end-2026 (a 5x multiple from the current price of $1,600),\u201d Kendrick said, reported The Block.\n\nFind out more on Ethereum, Bitcoin prices and forecasts. Meet and engage with transformative Digital Asset and Crypto business leaders and investors at Benzinga's exclusive event: Future of Digital Assets. Tickets are flying: Get yours!\n\nIn April 2023, SCB\u2019s Kendrick forecasted a $100,000 price for Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) by 2024 end. He believed that with troubles surrounding the stablecoins, Bitcoin is now regarded as the digital gold of the crypto space.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Strengths: Ethereum is said to have a dominance in the smart contract space which is further strengthened by its upcoming technical upgrades, such as proto-danksharding, that would help lower transaction fees on these platforms. In the past year, Ether prices saw a surge of 20% with the past 24-hour trading volume of almost $8 billion.\n\nRead Next: If You Invested \u20b91,000 In Ethereum When The World's First NFT Was Minted, Here's How Much You'd Have Today\n\nAmong the many factors, the upcoming Bitcoin halving event in April 2024, potential regulation and spot ETFs in the U.S. are likely to push Ether prices to $4,000 by 2024-end.\n\nAfter the MiCA regulation is passed for European countries, the U.S. and Britain could follow suit and such regulations are likely to have a positive impact on investor interest and volatility.\n\nBenzinga's Future of Digital Assets conference is scheduled for Nov. 14.

        "title": "Ethereum's Vitalik Buterin Talks Up Protocol Enshrinement - Unchained - Unchained",
        "content": "Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin quietly published an intriguing technical overview last month, describing the process of \u201censhrining\u201d certain features in the blockchain\u2019s core protocol or moving certain layer two functions to layer one.\n\nInterestingly, similar conversations have been occurring in the Bitcoin community where Paul Sztorc, CEO and founder of Bitcoin infrastructure firm LayerTwo Labs, has been vigorously arguing for the viability of drivechains \u2013 a type of sidechain or secondary blockchain that interacts with the primary Bitcoin network.\n\nThese technical conversations have been largely overshadowed by the high-profile trial of Sam Bankman-Fried, the disgraced former CEO and founder of the now-bankrupt crypto exchange FTX.\n\nEthereum\u2019s protocol enshrinement and Bitcoin\u2019s potential implementation of drivechains (which won\u2019t be covered below, but a brief synopsis can be found here) will likely have far more impact on the industry in the long run than Bankman-Fried\u2019s trial, regardless of how much attention the latter receives in the short term.\n\nIf Bankman-Fried is convicted, it will certainly reverberate for years to come. But a fundamental change in the mechanics of the world\u2019s top two blockchains will arguably be more consequential.\n\nProtocol enshrinement \u2013 a story of trade-offs\n\nThere are no solutions in crypto, only trade-offs, and few concepts embody that aphorism better than enshrinement.\n\nAccording to Buterin, enshrinement is simply the process of incorporating certain key features that are part of the broader Ethereum infrastructure, directly into the core protocol. Buterin says this minimizes the impact of potential bugs and mitigates validator centralization, among other things.\n\n\u201cFrom the start of the Ethereum project, there was a strong philosophy of trying to make the core Ethereum as simple as possible\u2026by building protocols on top,\u201d Buterin writes. \u201cMore recently, however, there has been some cautious interest in being willing to enshrine more of these features into the core Ethereum protocol.\u201d\n\nSome of those features include account abstraction, which enables smart contract wallets that support critical functions like account freezing and recovery, and zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machines (zkEVMs) that speed up transaction processing in a secure and verifiable way by leveraging cutting-edge cryptography. Enshrining account abstraction and zkEVMs would provide more effective ways of dealing with bugs, according to Buterin.\n\n\u201cIf some set of pieces of code are used by all users, or a very wide class of users, then it often makes more sense for the blockchain community to take on itself the responsibility to hard-fork, to fix any bugs that arise,\u201d writes Buterin.\n\nHe also describes how enshrining liquid staking could prevent validator centralization. Liquid staking involves locking up or staking cryptocurrency on a proof-of-stake blockchain and receiving corresponding tokens from a provider such as Lido. The tokens can be subsequently used for decentralized finance (DeFi) purposes.\n\n\u201cIf a single such staking token dominates, that leads to a single, potentially attackable governance gadget controlling a very large portion of all Ethereum validators,\u201d Buterin explains. \u201cTo the credit of protocols like Lido, they have implemented safeguards against this, but one layer of defense may not be enough.\u201d\n\nGradual protocol evolution\n\nDespite these promises of lower bug risk and decreased probability of centralization, enshrinement\u2019s glaring drawback is how it could result in an increasingly complex protocol that eventually becomes overextended and unwieldy.\n\n\u201cWhat features should be brought into the protocol and what features should be left to other layers of the ecosystem is a complicated trade-off,\u201d Buterin explains. \u201cWe should expect the trade-off to continue to evolve over time.\u201d"

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nAn average of just 7% of Ethereum users will stick with the platform for a year.\n\nEthereum\u2019s high churn rate contrasts with most mobile apps.\n\nCould more mobile integrations solve Ethereum\u2019s user retention problem?\n\nDespite the development of increasingly advanced and numerous decentralized apps (dApps) on the platform, research suggests that Ethereum has a serious user retention problem.\n\nAs it turns out, people are less likely to stick with the blockchain than they are with the average Web2 mobile app.\n\nEthereum Retention Rates Poor Compared to Mobile Apps\n\nAccording to research by Token Terminal , between August 2015 and September 2023, the average retention rate for Ethereum users was just 16.3% after a month. After a year, that figure falls to as low as 7%\n\nof those that start using @ethereum mainnet this month, ~7% will be around on mainnet in one year pic.twitter.com/p3a1pF7mUg \u2014 Token Terminal (@tokenterminal) October 9, 2023\n\nLooking at different Ethereum-based dApps, although specific retention rates diverge, the overall pattern is repeated across the board.\n\nFor instance, the dropoff rate for the decentralized exchange Uniswap was even worse than for Ethereum as a whole. On average, just 5% of Uniswap users were still using the platform a year after first signing up, Token Terminal data shows.\n\nEthereum\u2019s high user churn contrasts with the retention rates observed among standard mobile apps. According to Geckoboard , on average, mobile apps have a 30-day retention rate of 42%. For the best-performing apps, that figure rises to 66%.\n\nBut what are Ethereum dApps doing wrong? Could a poor user experience be holding the network, and a move to blockchain-based apps, back from greater adoption?\n\nDo Web3 Apps Have a User Experience Problem?\n\nOf course, there are some great Web3 dApps with an exceptional user experience. But to date, the most popular Ethereum-based applications have been designed for web browsers, or as standalone pieces of software.\n\nIn contrast, mobile apps have changed the way people access digital tools. And some of the most popular Web2 applications today are designed to be mobile first.\n\nThanks to Apple\u2019s App Store and Google Play, downloading new apps to a smartphone is almost always simpler than installing new software on a computer or configuring a new browser extension.\n\nIn addition to offering a more streamlined onboarding experience, people find it easier to integrate mobile apps into their daily routines once they download them.\n\nFor developers, there is no better way to build an active user base than making an application accessible from a device that most people carry around in their pocket.\n\nSo, maybe Web3 apps don\u2019t have a user experience problem as much as they have a mobile problem.\n\nApp Stores Remain Hostile to dApps\n\nIn defense of blockchain developers, mobile ecosystems have hardly welcomed them.\n\nFor example, in the US, Congress deemed Apple\u2019s developer guidelines hostile enough to warrant investigation by the House Subcommittee on Innovation, Data, and Commerce.\n\nAt issue are App Store guidelines that impose a 30% levy on gas fees tied to NFT transactions.\n\nMajor blockchain developers, including Coinbase and Axie Infinity, have long objected to the policy, which they argue invalidates their business model and makes it nearly impossible for them to offer their apps in an iOS-friendly format.\n\nIn the case of Coinbase, Apple\u2019s policy forced the firm to suspend NFT transfers for its iOS wallet users.\n\nApple\u2019s claim is that the gas fees required to send NFTs need to be paid through their In-App Purchase system, so that they can collect 30% of the gas fee. \u2014 Coinbase Wallet \ud83d\udee1\ufe0f\ud83d\udcde (@CoinbaseWallet) December 1, 2022\n\nMeanwhile, to comply with the App Store guidelines, Axie Infinity had to dramatically redesign its platform for iPhone users, who can only play a \u201clite\u201d version of the game without NFT functionality.\n\nFor Android users, on the other hand, Google only recently moved to embrace blockchain integrations and in-app NFTs.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Mobile Future\n\nDespite recalcitrance from mobile ecosystem gatekeepers, slowly but surely, Web3 is going mobile.\n\nWith new, mobile-focused Ethereum apps being developed all the time, alongside advances in blockchain-focused hardware , the greater integration of Web3 applications into mobile devices and networks looks almost inevitable.\n\nAnd once everyone can easily access tools and services built on Ethereum from their smartphones, perhaps the blockchain\u2019s dismal track record for user retention will improve."

        "content": "Ethereum price is struggling to stay above the $1,550 support against the US dollar. ETH could take a hit if it settles below $1,550 and then $1,540.\n\nEthereum is showing bearish signs and struggling to clear the $1,600.\n\nThe price is trading below $1,600 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere is a major bearish trend line forming with resistance near $1,600 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair could start a recovery wave if the bulls defend the $1,550 support zone.\n\nEthereum Price Struggles\n\nEthereum failed to start a recovery wave above the $1,600 resistance zone. ETH remained in a bearish zone and extended its decline toward $1,550, like Bitcoin.\n\nIt seems like the bears already attempted a close below the $1,550 support zone. A new swing low was formed near $1,542 and the price is now consolidating losses. The price is back above the $1,550 level, but it is still showing heavy bearish signs.\n\nEthereum is now trading below $1,600 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. Besides, there is a major bearish trend line forming with resistance near $1,600 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.\n\nOn the upside, the price might face resistance near the $1,570 level. It is near the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1,664 swing high to the $1,542 low. The first major resistance is near the trend line and $1,600 or the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nThe 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1,664 swing high to the $1,542 low is also near the trend line. The next major resistance is $1,620, above which the price could rise toward the $1,665 resistance zone. A close above the $1,665 resistance might send the price toward the main resistance at $1,750. Any more gains might open the doors for a move toward $1,880.\n\nDownside Break in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $1,600 resistance, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,550 level. The next key support is $1,540.\n\nA downside break below the $1,540 support might start another strong decline. In the stated case, the price could revisit the $1,480 level. Any more losses may perhaps send Ether toward the $1,420 level.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bearish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $1,540\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $1,600\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "Ethereum NFT production falls to all-time low in September - Forkast News",
        "content": "Non-fungible token (NFT) production on Ethereum, or the value of the primary sales generated from NFT minting, fell to an all-time low of US$17.55 million in September, down 12.4% from US$20.05 million in August, according to Forkast Labs data.\n\nNFTs are blockchain-based digital assets that can provide information on digital ownership. Notable collections like the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) were trading at a floor price of 128 ETH (US$211,000) in May 2022, before dropping more than 60% along with other notable NFT collections like CryptoPunks, which fell 60.4% to 45 Eth (US$72,727), from an all-time high of 113.9 Eth (US$184,080) recorded on Oct. 9, 2021.\n\n\u201cBlue-chip NFT collections such as Bored Ape Yacht Club and CryptoPunks serve as indicators of broader NFT market sentiment. Their decline might signify a shift in investor sentiment, perhaps questioning the intrinsic value of such assets,\u201d Matan Doyich, the chief executive officer of Crypto Index, a firm building centralized infrastructure for tokenized crypto exchange-traded funds, told Forkast.\n\nReflecting the overall NFT bear market, the Forkast ETH NFT Composite, an index that measures the performance of the top 250 NFTs in the Ethereum blockchain, fell 48% year-to-date to an all-time low of 715.22 points recorded on Sept. 28.\n\nNFT production on the Polygon blockchain fell to a seven-month low of US$4.7 million in September, down from a yearly high of US$14.44 million in August. Polygon NFT production is up 219% year-to-date, from US$1.47 million in January. Despite the rising numbers, the Forkast POL NFT Composite fell over 46% year-to-date.\n\nThe overall NFT market slump, along with the decrease in NFT production, can be attributed to a loss of interest by NFT investors, according to Anndy Lian, author of NFT: From Zero to Hero.\n\n\u201cThe NFT market was driven by a lot of hype in 2021. However, this has died down in recent months, as people have become more realistic and choosy about the kind of NFTs they want,\u201c said Lian.\n\nNFT services revenue on Ethereum, or total marketplace fees and creator royalties from secondary sales, fell 84.4% year-to-date to US$6.01 million in September from US$38.74 million in January according to Forkast Labs data.\n\nAt OpenSea, one of the world\u2019s largest NFT marketplaces, the protocol\u2019s monthly NFT trading volume fell 31.8% to US$76.79 million in September from US$112.74 million in August, according to data from The Block.\n\nBlur, OpenSea\u2019s rival marketplace, had its trading volume fall 38.3% to US$150.42 million in September, down from US$243.92 million in August.\n\n\u201cTo reignite interest in NFTs, the industry needs to see and demand innovations that go beyond digital art and collectibles, such as incorporating NFTs into more substantial real-world applications,\u201d Doyich told Forkast.\n\nThis year brought new use cases for NFTs, which will be needed to drive institutional investors, according to David Tng, managing director at TZ APAC, the Asian entity of the Tezos blockchain.\n\n\u201cNFTs will rely on the same pain point of needing to prove their utility, especially against the backdrop of a very volatile market. However, we are still seeing rapid growth and innovation. Enterprises and artists continue to use NFTs as a platform to explore, create and engage with their audiences,\u201d wrote Tng, in a statement shared with Forkast.\n\nDespite the market slump, globally recognized brands continue adopting NFTs. Starbucks launched an NFT version of its iconic pumpkin spice latte last Thursday, to commemorate the 20-year anniversary of the iconic drink. The NFTs worth US$20 have no minting limit and users will receive 250 bonus points that can be spent to improve their Starbucks Odyssey experience, which is the company\u2019s Web3 rewards and loyalty platform.\n\nSee related article: DeFi revenue remains resilient despite Curve Finance hack"

        "title": "Better Buy: Ethereum or Solana? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "After carrying out The Merge last year, Ethereum (ETH 6.26%) has been one of the top-performing cryptos in 2023. It is up more than 30% over the first nine months of the year.\n\nHowever, a number of other cryptos with large market caps have turned in an even more impressive performance. For example, Solana (SOL 11.69%), an Ethereum rival, is up a stunning 128% year to date. So, should you be buying Solana instead?\n\nInstitutional asset flows\n\nTo help answer that question, consider what's happening with institutional asset flows in the crypto market right now. According to CoinShares, a digital-asset investment firm that tracks the weekly inflows and outflows of digital assets, Solana has become the altcoin of choice for institutional investors. Based on an analysis of digital asset flows, institutional investors appear to be moving their money out of Ethereum and into Solana.\n\nThe latest weekly numbers from CoinShares are stunning, to say the least. Out of the $78 million in net inflows, Solana received more than $24 million of the total. By way of comparison, Ethereum received $10.2 million and Bitcoin (BTC 9.20%) received $43 million. So, the net inflow of institutional investor funds into Solana was more than twice the amount that went into Ethereum.\n\nBy just about any back-of-the-envelope calculation, this shouldn't be happening. Given that Ethereum accounts for nearly 20% of the total capitalization of the crypto market, and Solana accounts for less than 1%, there's no reason to expect institutional investors to allocate so much of their portfolios to Solana. Still, here we are.\n\nAnd this is not a fluke, either. For the first 32 weeks of the year, Solana has seen net inflows in 28 of them, according to CoinShares. Moreover, net inflows into Solana are at their highest levels since March 2022. All of this suggests that momentum is continuing to build around Solana. At the same time, Ethereum continues to see net outflows and is losing momentum.\n\nSolana's long-term growth prospects\n\nThere are several factors that might explain new investor inflows into Solana. Perhaps institutional investors are behaving just like retail investors and are simply chasing performance. With Solana up 122% for the year, this is a distinct possibility.\n\nMoreover, investors might be seeking out altcoins that provide superior diversification benefits. Ethereum still tends to track Bitcoin's performance, while Solana is less correlated with Bitcoin.\n\nHowever, I think there's a much bigger factor at play here: Investors are finally waking up to the fact that Solana is superior to Ethereum as a blockchain in terms of rapid processing speed, low transaction fees, and massive throughput potential. Even after The Merge, Ethereum can still process only 15 to 20 transactions per second; Solana can theoretically process 65,000 transactions per second. That tremendous gap in speeds might help to explain why Visa recently partnered with Solana (and not Ethereum) on a new stablecoin payment project.\n\nTaking a big-picture view, Solana could finally be fulfilling its potential as a so-called \"Ethereum killer.\" Ethereum is the past, and Solana is the future. There's something to be said for the fact that, even after The Merge, Ethereum is nowhere close to Solana's level of performance.\n\nIs Solana really the next Ethereum?\n\nSuppose you consider institutional investors to be the smart money. In that case, it's highly significant that they have been voting with their portfolios and moving money out of Ethereum and into Solana throughout 2023. Do they know something that we don't?\n\nWhile Ethereum has had a remarkable run since its launch in 2015, just about nobody is expecting it to replicate that type of performance. Since 2015, Ethereum is up 44,576.12%. Institutional investors might be looking for the next Ethereum to generate those types of otherworldly crypto gains, and have determined that Solana might fit the bill.\n\nI'm increasingly bullish on Solana as a long-term investment. If it continues to line up big-ticket partners like Visa, then it has a legitimate chance to turn in some impressive long-term returns."

He has also interviewed a few prominent experts within the cryptocurrency space.\n\nA prominent cryptocurrency analyst, Benjamin Cowen, raises concerns about Ethereum (ETH), the leading smart contract platform. He\u2019s sticking to his prediction that Ethereum could potentially experience a substantial decline, leading its price to plummet from $600 to $800 by the year\u2019s end.\n\nAnalyst Benjamin Cowen Stays Bearish on Ethereum, Anticipates Price Dip\n\nRecently, Benjamin Cowen, known for his accurate analysis, has shared his thoughts on his YouTube channel about Ethereum. He thinks his popular cryptocurrency, Etherum will most likely lose its value by the end of the year.\n\nEthereum needs to take a step back before it starts going up. Some folks are excited about a possible rally, but it won\u2019t be huge, maybe just twice as much as it\u2019s worth now. This kind of growth can happen in regular stock markets, too.\n\nI\u2019m saying that stocks often have these kinds of two-times increases, whether they go up a lot or just a little.

But that\u2019s not what\u2019s happening with Ethereum.\n\nLooking back, every time Ethereum reached new high prices, it only happened after it dropped to what I call \u2018home,\u2019 which is a specific price range at the lower end. Ethereum needs to \u2018come home\u2019 before it can make new highs.\n\nMeanwhile, Cowen\u2019s prediction is grounded in his comprehensive technical analysis of the Ethereum market. He points to several indicators, including price patterns and trading volumes, to support his view that ETH is at risk of experiencing a significant decline in value.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum Price Could Surge 5x to $8,000 by 2026, Says Standard Chartered Bank\n\nEthereum to Fall to $600 Level\n\nHe in his video, he further pointed out that this expected drop in Ethereum\u2019s value hasn\u2019t happened yet:\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still waiting for Ethereum to come back \u2018home,\u2019 and that hasn\u2019t happened yet. For over a year now, we\u2019ve seen Ethereum trying to stay at these prices, especially when we look at shorter time periods. But there\u2019s going to be a time when this support line breaks, and when it does, Ethereum is likely to head back \u2018home.'\u201d\n\nCowen had previously defined \u2018home\u2019 for Ethereum as being between $600 and $800 using a special method. He believes that Ethereum is going to return \u2018home\u2019 in the next few months and emphasized his view:"

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAnalyst Benjamin Cowen shed light on Ethereum's (ETH) performance, which, contrary to popular belief, has not been as robust as many in the crypto community think it is.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCowen presented compelling data: on May 12, 2023, Bitcoin (BTC) and ETH were priced at $26,800 and $1,804, respectively. Fast forward to October 11, 2023, and BTC's price steadfastly held at $26,800, whereas ETH had dwindled to $1,564. This downtrend was not just a momentary lapse but was reflected starkly in the ETH/BTC ratio, which progressively slipped from 0.067 to 0.058 in the same period.\n\nMay 12th, 2023:\n\nBTC: $26,800\n\nETH: $1804\n\n\n\nJune 20th, 2023:\n\nBTC: $26,800\n\nETH: $1790\n\n\n\nSep 1st, 2023:\n\nBTC: $26,800\n\nETH: $1630\n\n\n\nOct 11th, 2023:\n\nBTC: $26,800\n\nETH: $1564\n\n\n\nBut people keep telling me \u201cETH is holding up well\u201d \u2014 Benjamin Cowen (@intocryptoverse) October 11, 2023\n\nA counterpoint was raised by a crypto enthusiast who emphasized ETH's 77% surge from its low, outpacing BTC's 73% climb. However, Cowen swiftly noted the selective nature of these statistics. He stressed that a holistic view paints a different picture \u2014 from their all-time highs, BTC had retracted by 61%, while ETH saw a sharper decline of 68%.\n\nCurrent market analysis further cements Cowen's stance. As of now, Bitcoin is trading at approximately $26,727.99, maintaining a semblance of stability. In contrast, Ethereum struggles at around $1,551.34, a concerning figure for investors who recall its past highs.\n\nThis discourse is not just about numbers; it is a lesson in market perception versus reality. Ethereum, despite its groundbreaking contributions to the DeFi and NFT sectors, has not been impervious to market strains. Its trajectory, when juxtaposed with Bitcoin's, highlights the nuances of market movements and the fallacy of general assumptions.\n\nMomentary spikes and troughs can be deceptive, and an asset's true health is often revealed in longer-term trends and broader market contexts. This revelation does not undermine Ethereum's potential but serves as a grounding notice to traders to delve deeper, looking beyond the surface-level chatter to make informed investment decisions."

You can opt-out at any time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nImproving efficiency and boosted demand will lead to a seismic rise in the world's second largest cryptocurrency, Standard Chartered said in a Wednesday note.\n\nBy the end of 2026, ether could reach $8,000, or a 400% jump from today's price of around $1,600.\n\n\"We think the path higher for ETH prices may take longer than for BTC, but we see ETH eventually reaching a higher price multiple than BTC relative to current levels (5.0x versus 3.5x),\" Head of FX Research, West, and Digital Assets Research Geoff Kendrick wrote.\n\nBut that's only a \"stepping stone\" to a larger long-term valuation of $26,000-$35,000, though this estimate assumes use cases and revenue streams that have not yet come about, the note said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe forecast partially stems from expected improvements to the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nThe block is looking to enhance its performance through layer two scaling solutions and upcoming architecture improvements. For instance, plans to implement \"danksharding\" would allow Ethereum to manage 100,000 transactions per second.\n\nA version of this, called \"proto-danksharding,\" is set to be introduced in early 2024, and would significantly lower transaction costs on the blockchain.\n\n\"This should help to cement ETH's dominance in the smart contract space, thereby increasing its P/E ratio (if not its earnings) over the next couple of years,\" Kendrick said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, demand for ether will climb as it finds new use cases, while trends that rely on the cryptocurrency are set to expand.\n\nFor instance, NFT transactions are the leading Ethereum use case, which Kendrick predicts will expand. Though he acknowledges that NFT market activity has faded, digital art prices generally follow broader crypto price flows \u2014 with the \"crypto winter\" coming to an end, NFTs should recover as well.\n\nThe development of blockchain gaming will also fuel NFT demand, in turn boosting ether. NFTs create scarcity in these types of games, representing virtual assets such as items or real estate.\n\nReal-world asset tokenization, where ownership rights are represented in blockchain tokens, would also be a boon for ether that is set to grow.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"The obvious initial benefit of tokenisation is that it allows fractional ownership of otherwise lumpy or illiquid investments (e.g., real estate) at low cost; the costs associated with tokenisation are very low compared to other fractional ownership models, like IPOs,\" Kendrick wrote.\n\nTokenization also allows for around the clock trading, immediate settlement, ownership transparency, better investor access and cheaper costs.\n\nMeanwhile, inflows into bitcoin \u2014 which Kendrick has previously projected to hit $120,000 by end-2024 \u2014 would likely spill over into ether, while the upcoming bitcoin halving next year would put upside pressure on crypto in general.\n\nPositive regulator developments, such as the approval of crypto spot ETFs, would also benefit ether.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBoth bitcoin and ether will see a considerable boost from the end of the bond market sell-off, which has seen Treasury yields surge to 16 year highs."

        "content": "Mainstream Bitcoin (BTC) adoption won\u2019t happen until it bridges to the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) \u2014 the first point of entry for many real-world assets moving on-chain, a Web3 executive argues.\n\nSpeaking to Cointelegraph, the founder of cross-chain infrastructure firm Botanix Labs, Willem Schro\u00e9, claimed Bitcoin \u201cneeds to start playing in the EVM world\u201d for it to build real-world use cases to increase its adoption and utility.\n\n\u201cBitcoin is the most technologically secure and truly decentralized protocol [and] the EVM has proven itself to be the application layer for the global financial system,\u201d Schro\u00e9 said.\n\nOur Botanix Protocol positions Ethereum as a Layer-2 solution on top of #Bitcoin.\n\n\n\nWe've added Ethereum onto the Bitcoin Network's secure foundation to harness the security of its Proof-of-Work mechanism.\n\n\n\nAlso, enjoy the developmental ease of Ethereum. \u2014 Botanix Labs (@BotanixLabs) September 25, 2023\n\nWhile Bitcoin is typically used as a peer-to-peer payment system or for storing value, Schro\u00e9 said its potential won\u2019t be fulfilled unless the cryptocurrency can connect to the broader financial system, such as with security and commodity markets.\n\nConnecting Bitcoin to Ethereum-based real-world assets, stablecoins, decentralized finance and nonfungible tokens via the EVM is the first step in that direction, Schro\u00e9 argued.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a huge amount of value and development waiting to happen.\u201d\n\nSchro\u00e9\u2019s Botanix Labs aims to connect the Bitcoin and Ethereum ecosystems through its \u201cSpiderchain\u201d \u2014 a proof-of-stake layer 2 that implements EVM to EVM bridges to enable Bitcoin to interact with the EVM.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum may seem like opposites, but they can co-exist and complement each other.\n\n\n\nHowever, this does present some challenges.\n\n\n\nMulti-chain ecosystems with cross-chain bridges can have security and centralization risks, hindering the potential of collaboration. \u2014 Botanix Labs (@BotanixLabs) October 2, 2023\n\nStaked assets are secured by a decentralized multisignature mechanism, and its design doesn\u2019t require Bitcoin to be forked.\n\nSchro\u00e9 believes the current solutions involving wrapped Bitcoin on Ethereum and other EVM-compatible chains are problematic and argues they are susceptible to censorship and regulatory scrutiny, as they\u2019re operated by the centralized United States-based company BitGo.\n\nA similar proposal to bring Ethereum functionality to Bitcoin is also being proposed through \u201cdrivechains,\u201d also known as the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal-300, which Bitcoin developers are again discussing. If implemented, it would allow \u201csidechains\u201d to be built on the network.\n\nOn Oct. 9, Bitcoin developer Robin Linus released a white paper titled \u201cBitVM: Compute Anything on Bitcoin,\u201d which details how Ethereum-like optimistic rollup smart contracts could be made on the Bitcoin network.\n\nRelated: El Salvador\u2019s Bitcoiners teach 12-year-olds how to send sats\n\nUnlike the Spiderchain, BIP-300 would require Bitcoin to soft fork and would be activated by miners \u2014 similar to the Taproot soft fork in November 2021 that paved the way for the NFT-emulating Ordinals and BRC-20 tokens.\n\nThe BIP\u2019s creator, Paul Sztorc, says those favoring BIP-300 believe it will offer new privacy and scaling use cases to Bitcoin, among other benefits.\n\nSo far at @tabconf:\n\n\n\n* Many pro Bip300 -- popular usecases are Privacy, Scaling, and experimentation (get new OP codes now)\n\n* Very popular question is: when is my debate with Peter Todd (Friday at 2 PM)\n\n* Many complained about off-base Twitter dialog and nonsense propaganda\n\n*\u2026 \u2014 Paul Sztorc (@Truthcoin) September 7, 2023\n\nHowever, not everyone likes the idea of expanding Bitcoin\u2019s ecosystem beyond its current use cases.\n\nCory Klippsten, the CEO of BTC-only exchange Swan Bitcoin, believes drivechains and solutions that bring other assets to Bitcoin will bring an influx of scammers.\n\nSaifedean Ammous, the author of The Bitcoin Standard, opposes the idea of issuing altcoins on Bitcoin, suggesting that \u201cgood money\u201d is the only token needed.\n\nPeople only think tokens are a good idea because we live in a world of broken money. A good money is the only token anyone ever needs. Bitcoin is going to detokenize the world. https://t.co/q8Nhc7XcOX \u2014 Saifedean Ammous (@saifedean) August 28, 2023\n\nHowever, Schro\u00e9 said he thinks bringing together Bitcoin and Ethereum could produce a new array of applications \u201cwith decentralization and security as first principles.\u201c\n\n\u201cEVM is the winning virtual machine, and Bitcoin is the best money,\u201d he said.\n\nMagazine: Ethereum is eating the world \u2014 \u2018You only need one internet\u2019"

The slow start contrasts with that of Bitcoin futures ETFs.\n\nLet\u2019s get into it!\n\nSlow and steady\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum have underperformed expectations this month, crypto market maker QCP Capital said on Thursday.\n\nStay ahead of the game with our weekly newsletters Subscribe\n\nThe slump has continued \u201cunabated\u201d since the beginning of October, the firm said in a market update. Crypto has failed to track a bounce in broader macro markets since last week\u2019s US jobs data.\n\n\u201cThis bout of weakness is particularly stark as it comes against a backdrop of supposedly bullish factors,\u201d the market maker said.\n\nIn particular, October is the \u201cstrongest\u201d month of the year. Bitcoin has only had one negative return in October since 2014, according to Coinglass data.\n\n\u201cWe attribute a large part of why this has happened to the shocking disappointment of the Ethereum ETF, which has only traded roughly 0.2% of the corresponding Bitcoin ETF volume two years ago,\u201d QCP Capital said.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nIn 2021, Bitcoin futures ETFs \u2014 which track the future price of the asset rather than the current price \u2014 clocked up over $1 billion in trading volume in just two days after launching. ProShares\u2019 BITO generated $200 million in the first 15 minutes, as it launched at the peak of the crypto market when Bitcoin was trading around $60,000.\n\nAbout 90% of Ethereum futures ETF volumes is concentrated on VanEck and ProShares products.\n\nInvestors likely \u201cfelt institutions were on the verge of massive Ethereum adoption,\u201d the firm said, adding that \u201cit reflects more the scepticism towards futures ETFs in the space now.\u201d\n\n\u201cOr perhaps crypto traders are too distracted right now listening to soundbites from SBF\u2019s ongoing trial,\u201d the firm said.\n\nUS inflation date today could make matters worse QCP Capital said, which, since Covid, \u201chas generally produced upside surprises relative to expectations for this month\u2019s release.\u201d\n\n\u201cHopefully the relative underperformance of Bitcoin and Ethereum to the upside now also mean their beta is lower to the downside as well, should CPI come in stronger than expected,\u201d QCP Capital said prior to today\u2019s US inflation report.\n\nBeta measures market volatility. Basically, since upward volatility is low, downward price swings might also be less likely, the firm said.\n\nUS inflation increased by 3.7% year-on-year in September, marginally higher than estimates of 3.6% from Wall Street analysts. Core inflation, which excludes food and energy, was 4.1%, and 0.3% month-on-month, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nCrypto market movers\n\nBitcoin whipsawed following the release US inflation data for September. The leading cryptocurrency dipped to around $26,600 after inflation came in above estimates. It quickly bounced back to trade above $26,800, down 1.2% over the past day.\n\nEthereum also lost 1.4%, down to $1,550.\n\nWhat we\u2019re reading\n\nAdam Morgan McCarthy is DL News\u2019 London-based Markets Correspondent.

According to the analyst, 1.58 million addresses bought 1.92 million ETH between $1,528 and $1,571, indicating that a move below the lower bounds of the price range may signal a deep corrective move for Ethereum.\n\n\u201cEthereum is hovering above a critical demand zone. Keep a close watch, as a daily close below $1,530 could signal a steep correction ahead for ETH.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, ETH is trading for $1,568.\n\nAs for Bitcoin (BTC), Martinez thinks that the crypto king is headed to lower levels after breaking down from a symmetrical triangle pattern on the two-hour chart.\n\n\u201cGiven the triangle\u2019s y-axis height, we might anticipate a 5% correction in BTC, potentially heading to $26,200.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, BTC is trading for $27,472.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "title": "Ethereum's scaling infrastructure is better than ever. So where's all the traffic? - Blockworks",
        "content": "It was not too long ago that the key concern regarding Ethereum\u2019s future was the desperate need for it to scale. High network activity and subsequent gas costs spawned an explosion of layer-2 solutions.\n\nThus, the most recent developments on Ethereum have been focused on infrastructure and how to reduce the load on the once heavily burdened network. Now, it finally seems to be ready for prime time.\n\nBut where did all the traffic go?\n\n\u201cThe argument was always, well, if you increase throughput by a hundred X, which has happened, then you should increase transactions by a hundred X, but that hasn\u2019t happened,\u201d says the head of digital asset trading at GoldenTree, Avi Felman.\n\nOn the 1000x podcast (Spotify/Apple), Felman says, \u201cyou\u2019ve just moved all the transactions from ether (ETH) to Arbitrum, and you\u2019ve barely increased the overall amount of transactions that are occurring.\u201d\n\n\u201cEveryone was kind of expecting it to look good on a deflationary basis,\u201d Felman says, \u201cbut that\u2019s just not going to be the case as long as activity is mostly on Base, or mostly on Arbitrum or mostly on Optimism.\u201d\n\nMore lanes = more traffic?\n\nGoldman Sachs executive director Jonah Van Bourg compares his expectations for Ethereum\u2019s scaling solutions to the constant addition of freeway lanes in California. \u201cEvery time they add a new lane, it just brings more cars onto the freeway.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought the same thing would happen to ETH,\u201d he says, but instead it\u2019s looking more like the network of pipelines in the Permian Basin in Texas.\n\n\u201cSometimes there\u2019s just too much oil,\u201d he says. \u201cEverything\u2019s bottlenecked. So then there\u2019s this frenzy of pipeline building, which is effectively a scaling solution for an oil field. And then suddenly there\u2019s just way too much pipeline capacity and not enough oil.\u201d\n\nVan Bourg explains that scaling solutions were overbuilt during a period of particularly high demand in Ethereum\u2019s history. Now, capacity is much greater than demand, Van Bourg says, \u201cso gas prices are just forced into the toilet.\u201d\n\nRead more: Ethereum blockspace on track for first unprofitable month since the Merge\n\nVan Bourg expects the pendulum to \u201cswing back the other way hard one day\u201d when people realize, he says, \u201cwe have this thing that\u2019s cheaper and better than AWS for our use case \u2014 and probably more permanent.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut that might be a year off, or six months off, or two years off, who knows.\u201d\n\nVan Bourg notes that negative sentiment regarding Ethereum on \u201ccrypto Twitter\u201d might pressure holders to think short term. \u201cYou read tweets where people who have been ETH-bullish for five years are just like, \u2018It\u2019s over. Never buying this crap again.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cYou look at your ETH and you look at these tweets and you\u2019re probably saying to yourself, \u2018Crap, I\u2019m going to get out.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cRemind yourself,\u201d he says, \u201cthat in 12 or 18 or 24 months when this thing is gassing higher and it\u2019s trading $5,000 a token, those very same people will be talking about how ETH is the future, how it\u2019s going to $50,000 a token, how they\u2019ve been long all the way up.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a gradient of outcomes,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not black and white. ETH is not over. ETH is not the future. It\u2019s this constantly evolving shade of gray.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have to filter out the noise.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nCharles Hoskinson addressed misconceptions surrounding the Hydra project in a YouTube video.\n\nHoskinson emphasized that Cardano\u2019s goals have evolved beyond increasing transaction per second (TPS) metrics.\n\nThe founder and Cardano remain under pressure after calling their biggest competitor a \u2018dumpster fire.\u2019\n\nCardano co-founder Charles Hoskinson has finally responded to the growing chorus of criticism aimed at the Hydra project. After his public swipes at Ethereum and its limited transactions-per-second (TPS) potential, Hoskinson found himself on the back foot amid accusations of dishonesty around Hydra\u2019s capabilities, but he has attempted to face these down with a rebuttal in a YouTube video.\n\nOn Hydra Scaling https://t.co/u5tl7FBI9A \u2014 Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) October 5, 2023\n\nHydra\u2019s Potential for Scalability\n\nTo improve scalability through a novel approach to transaction processing, Cardano created Hydra. Additionally, the project has been enhancing Hydra\u2019s functionality since its conception. New Application Programming Interfaces, for instance, were released by updated Hydra for Web3.0 developers to use.\n\nHoskinson explained that over three years, Hydra made a slight pivot and changed its focus to: \u201clet\u2019s build some middleware that is going to be really easy for you as a developer to plug into your application work with Plutus to help get a lot of that complex logic that should not run on the main network but run it in a different network.\u201d\n\nHowever, Hoskinson was faced with allegations of deceit regarding the Hydra project. To demonstrate Cardano\u2019s throughput potential, he unveiled a TPS graphic that showed roughly 1,000 TPS, yet the narrative built that Hydra could lead to 1 million TPS. A Cadano developer has refuted this.\n\nNo it is not. Please stop spreading the \"1 million tps\" narrative \ud83d\ude4f, it is misleading. If you need more information about what is Hydra and what can it do, check: \u2013 https://t.co/D3xqC2Z6Fs\n\n\u2013 https://t.co/1x2x1CARLK\n\n\u2013 https://t.co/s5rSg1O9rw \u2014 KtorZ (@_KtorZ_) May 13, 2023\n\nThe ambiguous nature of Hydra\u2019s potential and the narrative that built around its incredible TPS led many to question the founder of the project, yet he has come out in defense of Hydra and what has been said previously.\n\nHoskinson responded to the most recent skepticism and false information on their initiative. He claims that the majority of people spread misinformation online to damage Cardano\u2019s reputation.\n\n\u201cEvery time a lie is said, it takes ten times as much effort to undo that in people\u2019s memory. So, when people run around and say Hydra\u2019s failed, we lied about Hydra, there\u2019s no way to achieve any of these performance claims\u2026then what they\u2019re really doing is they\u2019re taking the hard work of dozens of people and everybody building on it,\u201d he stated .\n\nHe added this is not okay, and it\u2019s not fair, and it has to stop.\n\n\u201cYou know the internet has become a cesspool where everything goes, and misinformation spreads, and people absorb it and does have an impact,\u201d he said .\n\nHoskinson emphasized that Cardano is a credible project thanks to extensive study, open-source contributions from worldwide developers and engineers, and peer-reviewed fundamentals. Additionally, the ongoing initiatives to enhance the blockchain and provide cutting-edge solutions suggest a promising future for cryptocurrencies.\n\nEthereum As a \u2018Dumpster Fire\u2019\n\nHoskinson has often been a controversial figure and recently made a risky statement on Twitter by outlining some of Cardano\u2019s greatest advantages over Ethereum.\n\nIn his response, Hoskinson primarily criticized Ethereum while also showcasing the advantages of his own system.\n\nAs part of the team that launched Ethereum, Hoskinson has a good understanding of the project, but he has been a long-time skeptic of the second-largest cryptocurrency by market caps and its potential to be a \u2018World Computer.\u2019 His outspoken attacks on Ethereum may be at the heart of some of the backlash he is getting for positioning Hydra as a superior offering.\n\nIt's getting delusion town now. Hydra is live on mainnet and evolving fast. Mithril is live as well and the first step towards a rich DA and light client strategy. We already designed a significantly better way of handling transactions via tiered pricing and Babel fees. There's\u2026 https://t.co/2cJa8ivJGu \u2014 Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) August 17, 2023\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, Ethereum has a dumpster fire of a consensus layer, has a terrible programming model that they can\u2019t change, and are getting eaten alive by their own layer 2 ecosystem,\u201c he said.\n\nSEC Not Pursuing ADA\n\nDespite the backlash he faces for Hydra, Hoskinson stated in a recent interview that he doesn\u2019t think the American Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will pursue the project\u2019s native coin, ADA, as a security.\n\nHe emphasized that despite the fact that ADA was listed as a security in a complaint against a cryptocurrency exchange, there hasn\u2019t been any enforcement action taken against it thus far, and that won\u2019t change.\n\nThe SEC recently declared approximately 12 tokens, including Cardano (ADA), Binance Coin (BNB), Solana (SOL), Polygon (MATIC), and Filecoin (FIL), to be securities and demanded that they be registered before being listed on exchanges in two lawsuits brought against the world\u2019s two largest cryptocurrency exchanges, Coinbase and Binance.\n\nHoskinson highlighted that the SEC\u2019s activities have not affected ADA in answer to a query about why the agency has been acting \u201csomewhat antagonistically towards Cardano\u201d and other blockchains."

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) has maintained its spot as a leading altcoin. However, a recent analysis from Benjamin Cowen indicates that its journey, at least in comparison to Bitcoin (BTC), could have followed a better trajectory.\n\nIn a space where past trends can sometimes indicate future outcomes, ETH\u2019s price behavior, when viewed against BTC, offers a tale of potential concern.\n\nEthereum Stumbling Blocks In 2023\n\nA leading voice in the crypto analytical community, Benjamin Cowen, expressed his lack of enthusiasm for ETH\u2019s performance in 2023 during a YouTube video. The ETH / BTC valuation, a critical metric for gauging relative performance, is the bedrock for his statements.\n\nAccording to his observations from monthly charts, Cowen\u2019s analysis primarily orbits around the ETH / Bitcoin valuation, which has trended downwards.\n\nThe analyst cites patterns from 2019, a pre-halving year, where ETH\u2019s value relative to BTC fell significantly. That year alone, the ETH / BTC valuation declined by about 49%.\n\nAccording to the analyst, fast forward to 2023, and ETH\u2019s comparative valuation has already plummeted by 20.56%. If Cowen\u2019s prediction and the patterns from 2019 hold any water, Ethereum could be staring down a deeper abyss.\n\nYet, it\u2019s not all bleak. Cowen remains measured, as he acknowledges the change the nature of \u201cThe Merge\u201d brought on Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem, believing it is a \u201cgame changer.\u201d While Cowen wasn\u2019t overly optimistic, the analyst refrained from forecasting ETH\u2019s next moves, primarily due to the unpredictable ripple effects of The Merge.\n\nThe Merge: A Game-Changing Variable?\n\nThe Merge, a much-anticipated Ethereum upgrade, has already marked its influence on the ETH / BTC valuation. Ethereum\u2019s weekly charts have been in a continuous downtrend following its implementation, creating further lows.\n\nCowen recognizes that The Merge, with its deflationary component, could mean ETH might not toe its historical line. This deflationary aspect could be Ethereum\u2019s wild card, making its trajectory even more elusive.\n\nNotably, while many parallels might be drawn between 2019 and 2023, such updates as The Merge means that Ethereum\u2019s journey this year might still hold a few surprises.\n\nMeanwhile, the Ethereum price against the US dollar has seen quite a bearish trend, particularly over the past week. The second largest crypto by market capitalization has plunged nearly 5% in the past 7 days, bringing its price to fall below $1,600 with a current trading price of $1,569.\n\nFeatured image from Unsplash, Chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Following the Terra LUNA network collapse back in 2022, the price of Ethereum followed the general market downtrend. As a result of this, the ETH price had fallen to a new cycle low of $900, before recovering once more. However, now that the altcoin is still deep in the throes of the bear market, questions have arisen once more about the chances of the price returning to its 2022 lows.\n\nCrypto Analyst Says Ethereum Could Drop To $900\n\nIn an analysis posted on TradingView, crypto analyst FieryTrading presents a scenario in which the price of Ethereum could fall back toward its 2022 lows. The analysis in question takes into account the multiple bullish trend lines that the digital asset\u2019s price had fallen through over the last year.\n\nAccording to FieryTrading, Ethereum had one last remaining bullish line which had emerged on the chart back toward the bottom of the June 2022 sell-offs. However, the digital asset hasn\u2019t been able to hold this trend line and they point out that \u201cit\u2019s well over a year old and must carry some weight.\u201d\n\nETH price could fall to $900 | Source: Tradingview.com\n\nDue to this, the crypto analyst believes that the digital asset has entered into a long bearish stretch. As this bear stretch continues, which the analyst expects to be even longer, they see a high possibility of the Ethereum price reaching as low as $900 once more, as shown in the chart below.\n\nDespite being seemingly convinced about ETH\u2019s price decline, the analysis still needs confirmation. Their explanation which is shown in the chart as well asks to wait for the price to break below the $1,510 level for this to take place.\n\nETH price falls to $1,567 | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nBearish Going Into The Bitcoin Halving\n\nAs the analyst explains, the bearish expectation is not localized to just the Ethereum price alone. It seems to encompass the whole market which the analyst believes has finished out its half bullish stretch and has now entered into the bearish half that often leads up to the halving. As the analyst puts it, this indicates \u201cthat it\u2019s the turn of the bears by now.\u201d\n\nThis school of thought is not new and is actually backed up by historical data. When looking at the charts of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, it shows that there was a bearish stretch leading up to the Bitcoin halving. After the event, this trend tends to reverse, which then signals the start of the bull market.\n\nIn the months leading up to the 2020 halving event, the price of Ethereum saw a sharp decline that put its price in the $120 region before picking back up. So if there is a repeat of this, then FieryTrading\u2019s analysis for ETH could play out.\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "A report out Wednesday argues that the price of the ethereum cryptocurrency may eventually climb as high as $35,000. Ether's price has been stuck alongside bitcoin's this year, but patient investors with a long horizon could be rewarded as ethereum reclaims its dominance in crypto's smart contracts space and new use cases emerge, according to Standard Chartered. In recent years, a wave of ethereum competitors have emerged to challenge the flagship Web3 blockchain network's high fees and slow processing times, including Solana , Cardano and Polkadot . Now, \"layer 2\" scaling solutions and new use cases are becoming \"ever more important\" and could help lift the price of ether 5x in the next three years before rocketing even higher, Standard Chartered said in a note Wednesday. \"We expect further change ahead,\" said Geoff Kendrick, an analyst at the London-based bank. \"Layer 2 scaling solutions \u2026 are likely to grow in importance over time, particularly as architecture upgrades expected in early 2024 sharply lower fees on these platforms. This should help to cement ETH's dominance in the smart contract space, thereby increasing its P/E ratio (if not its earnings) over the next couple of years.\" \"Layer 2\" solutions such as Arbitrum and Optimism are developed on ethereum itself to enhance its efficiency and help keep transactions within the ethereum ecosystem, rather than moving to a competing network in an attempt to find lower fees. Keeping activity on ethereum should increase the token's price-to-earnings ratio, Kendrick said. \"We think Ethereum's established dominance in smart contract platforms, along with emerging uses in gaming and tokenization, has the potential to push ETH to the $8,000 level by end-2026,\" he added. That level is \"a stepping stone to our long-term 'structural' valuation estimate of $26,000-$35,000,\" he added. ETH.CM= 1Y mountain Ether (ETH) over the past year That valuation assumes future use cases and revenue streams that may not exist yet, Kendrick noted. He highlighted gaming and tokenization of real-world assets as the next big use cases for the network. Both could add demand to its existing nonfungible token and decentralized finance channels, respectively, by giving \"real world\" companies and industries examples of how and why they could benefit from moving certain processes onto ethereum. Standard Chartered expects \"significant developments on these fronts by 2025-26,\" Kendrick said. \u2014 CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed reporting."

        "content": "A prominent crypto venture capital firm is comparing Ethereum (ETH) to the mobile operating system Android and Solana (SOL) to iOS.\n\nIn a new blog post, Placeholder Capital makes a case for why Ethereum and Solana are comparable to the two different operating systems.\n\n\u201cEthereum and Solana are like Android and iOS. Android values modularity: it runs on many different types of devices made by hundreds of manufacturers worldwide; Google only makes 1-2% of them. This approach made it the world\u2019s most popular mobile operating system, with an estimated 60-75% market share.\n\nAndroid\u2019s flexibility has been a boon for hardware companies making anything from smartphones to televisions, as they can bring new products to market without investing billions into building bespoke operating systems. However, such diversity also makes it more difficult to develop apps that seamlessly work across many devices with different specs, screen sizes, and the various versions of Android these devices run.\u201d\n\nThe venture capital firm says that iOS has significant qualities that Android lacks, including a more consistent user experience.\n\n\u201cBy contrast, because Apple makes all iOS devices, it can provide users and developers with a more integrated and consistent experience. The time saved by not having to optimize across different devices can go into delivering better apps that users are willing to pay a premium for, and it\u2019s not uncommon for companies to launch on iOS first as a result.\n\nSo, while Apple has just about a third of the market in terms of distribution, it does a much better job at capturing the value of its ecosystem with a whopping ~60% of all mobile spend, plus all the hardware revenue.\u201d\n\nAccording to Placeholder Capital, Ethereum\u2019s likeness to Android is helping to boost its layer-2 ecosystem.\n\n\u201cEthereum is similar to Android in that it\u2019s quickly becoming more of a platform for third-party networks than the place where most end-users and developers operate.\u201d\n\nSolana offers developers certain benefits over Ethereum, including speed and cost, according to the firm.\n\n\u201cSolana is similar to iOS in how it values tightly integrated components in the name of throughput and performance. There\u2019s much more to it \u2013 different consensus mechanisms and design principles \u2013 but ultimately, Solana as a single, unified network is much faster and cheaper than Ethereum and many other EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) networks.\u201d\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "On-chain data shows Ethereum whales have sold around 12 million in the cryptocurrency within the past year and have shown no signs of slowing down.\n\nEthereum Whale Holdings Have Been In Constant Downtrend Since 2020\n\nIn a new post on X, analyst James V. Straten has discussed how the Bitcoin and Ethereum whales have shown some stark contrast in their behavior.\n\nHere is the chart that the analyst has shared, which compares the trends in the holdings of these humongous holders for the two assets over their entire history:\n\nHow the holdings of the whales differ between the two cryptocurrencies | Source: @jimmyvs24 on X\n\nFor defining what a \u201cwhale\u201d is, the analyst has chosen the 1,000 tokens cutoff for both assets. The graph shows that the holdings of the Bitcoin whales have been in an overall uptrend throughout the asset\u2019s history.\n\nSome deviations have been from this upward trajectory, like during the 2021 bull run, where these investors participated in some profit-taking. However, such deviations have only been temporary as the whales have eventually resumed their accumulation.\n\nHowever, a deviation that is yet to be reversed fully is the drawdown observed around the FTX collapse in November 2022. Nonetheless, the whales have participated in some accumulation since the start of the year; more is needed to retrace the aforementioned plunge.\n\nThe Bitcoin whales have seen their holdings move sideways in the past couple of years. The Ethereum whales, on the other hand, have participated in a steep selloff during the same period.\n\nSince 2020, these holders have shed 20 million ETH from their combined holdings, worth about $31.6 billion at the current exchange rate. In the past year alone, they have sold about 12 million ETH ($18.9 billion), an astonishing figure.\n\nAs highlighted in the graph, the Ethereum whales showed a temporary deviation phase when they bought at the bear market lows. Nevertheless, this accumulation was quickly reversed as the indicator resumed a sharp plunge soon after.\n\nSomething worth noting here is that the size of the whales isn\u2019t the same between the two assets. Due to the difference in the prices of the coins, 1,000 tokens of each have vastly different weightages. Based on this cutoff, Bitcoin whales would hold at least $27.4 million worth of the asset, while the ETH whales hold just $1.58 million.\n\nA more fair comparison may be made by looking at the holdings of the ETH entities of comparable size to the BTC whales. As displayed in the chart below, the Ethereum whales with between 10,000 to 100,000 ETH ($15.8 million to $158 million) have shown accumulation over the years. Still, this cohort has also sold massive amounts this year.\n\nLooks like the value of the metric has sharply declined recently | Source: @jimmyvs24 on X\n\nHowever, the mega whales on the network ($158 million+) have shown behavior more in line with the aggregate 1,000+ ETH group, as they have distributed heavily since 2020.\n\nThese whales have been selling for a few years now | Source: @jimmyvs24 on X\n\nEthereum\u2019s situation looks bleak, at least in terms of the holdings of the whales. The fact that these humongous holders have shown no signs of a turnaround so far may be the most concerning, as they lack interest in accumulating the asset. This differs greatly from the sentiment around the Bitcoin whales, who have been participating in net buying this year.\n\nETH Price\n\nEthereum has registered some decline recently, as the coin\u2019s price is now retesting the same lows as back in August.\n\nETH has been moving sideways over the past couple of months | Source: ETHUSD on TradingView\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.com, charts from TradingView.com, Glassnode.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nEther, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain, could potentially surge to $8,000 within the next two years, according to a recent projection by global banking titan Standard Chartered. This optimistic view is anchored in Ethereum's growing role in smart contracts, gaming and the tokenization of traditional assets. Geoff Kendrick, StanChart Head of FX Research, also hinted at a more ambitious long-term structural valuation ranging from $26,000 to $35,000 by 2040, supported by emerging real-world use cases.\n\nNot everyone is bullish\n\nDespite Standard Chartered's bullish outlook, other industry voices hold a more cautious perspective on Ethereum.\n\nNotably, after the Shanghai upgrade in April, daily transactions on the Ethereum network experienced a 12% decline, as reported by JPMorgan Chase. Analysts at the bank, spearheaded by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, expressed concerns regarding the platform's dwindling network activity.\n\nDaily active addresses experienced a massive 20% decrease. Moreover, the total value locked on the Ethereum network plunged by 8%.\n\nFurthermore, the launch of nine Ether futures ETFs showed lackluster performance, pushing K33 Research analysts to advocate for a shift back to Bitcoin.\n\nEthereum's declining market share\n\nAs Ethereum faces challenges, Bitcoin's market dominance is on an upward trajectory. The market share of the top cryptocurrency is now inching close to 50%, according to CoinGecko data.\n\nOver the past week, Bitcoin has seen a less sharp decline of 1.7% compared to Ethereum's 4.6%.\n\nAdding to this, Bitcoin's market share recently reached a three-month high, further emphasizing the flagship cryptocurrency's rising dominance in the space, even as altcoins underperform."

        "title": "Ethereum Price Prediction: ETH Market Falls As Bitcoin Climbs - CoinGape",
        "content": "Ethereum price is once again dealing with immense selling pressure while bulls move swiftly to defend support at $1,550. The hype around the approval of a bunch of Ether futures ETFs early last week propelled ETH to $1,750 but a weak crypto market structure coupled with profit-taking among investors cut short the recovery, leading to a sharp dive.\n\nThe largest smart contracts token although barely unchanged over the last 24 hours, is down 4.6% in a week to trade at $1,557 on Thursday. Approximately $7.5 billion in trading volume has come in during the same period while Ether\u2019s market capitalization holds at $187 billion.\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum Cedes Ground As Bitcoin Gains\n\nEthereum is ceding ground to the largest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin as investors seek exposure to the most popular digital asset amid the ongoing geopolitical tensions caused by the war between Israel and Hamas.\n\nSince June, Ethereum\u2019s market value has shrunk by 18% while Bitcoin lost around half of the same amount in the period to $522 billion. In the last seven days, market value decreased by 4.6% compared to Bitcoin\u2019s 2.9% drop to $26,792.\n\nThis downward trend has led to a drop in Ethereum\u2019s percentage of the total market capitalization to 17.9% from approximately 18.4% at the beginning of 2023. According to market data aggregated by CoinMarketCap, Bitcoin has come up stronger with its market value rising from 40% at the beginning of the year to 50%.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, the Ethereum network has suffered significant setbacks in the last few weeks, with network activity and gas fees dwindling. At the same time, the token\u2019s supply has been on an upward trajectory following months of deflation.\n\nInvestors are also choosing Bitcoin over Ethereum as the war in the Middle East rages on. Ethereum has increased by 32% this year, slightly less than half of Bitcoin\u2019s 66% growth.\n\n\u201cIn fact, Ether has been massively underperforming the broad market since the Merge, with both the ETH/BTC price and volume ratio trending downwards over the past year,\u201d research firm Kaiko said in a report. \u201cEther\u2019s underperformance is likely due to the ongoing impact of the bear market, which historically has seen traders turn to Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nEthereum Price On The Verge of A Bigger Dip\n\nEthereum price is holding below all the bull market moving average indicators including the 21-week Exponential Moving Average (EMA), the 100-week EMA, and the 200-week EMA.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) reinforces the bearish outlook as the indicator drops below the midline (50) heading toward the overbought region (below 30).\n\nLosing support at $1,550 would mean abandoning a potential trend reversal due to the formation of a falling wedge pattern on the weekly chart. The next possible support area from here is the buyer congestion at $1,450 but traders cannot rule out extended losses to $1,230 and $1,050, respectively.\n\nAn immediate recovery would be possible if bulls stand their ground at $1,550 and push to reclaim higher support at $1,600. This move would be enough to call investors back with the anticipation of a falling wedge pattern breakout targeting $1,800 and highs above $2,000.\n\nRelated Articles"

        "content": "Key takeaways:\n\nThe CoinCodex price prediction algorithm forecasts Ethereum price will surpass $10,000 by 2028 and reach $35,000 by 2037\n\nCoincidentally, Standard Chartered Bank\u2019s lead researcher believes that ETH will reach $8,000 by the end of 2026 and consolidate in the $26,000 to $35,000 range in the long term\n\nThe reasons for Ethereum\u2019s price increases include BTC halving, gaming, and tokenization, with the launch of an Ethereum spot ETF being the most immediate one\n\nEthereum price could reach as high as $35,000, according to Standard Chartered Bank\u2019s head of research\n\nThe price of Ethereum has been on a downward trend since April, when the second-largest crypto recorded its yearly high of $2,133. The cryptocurrency is currently changing hands at $1,564, down roughly -27% since its YTD high and nearly -70% removed from its ATH of $4,867 in 2021.\n\nBut the fortunes of ETH holders might soon be changing for the better. According to head of forex and crypto research at Standard Chartered Bank, Geoffrey Kendrick, we could see Ethereum retest the $4,000 by the end of 2024. What\u2019s more, Kendrick says that ETH/USD will reach $8,000 by the end of 2026 and proceed to climb to between $26,000 and $35,000 \u2013 a price range Kendrick identifies as Ethereum\u2019s \"long-term structural valuation.\"\n\nStandard Chartered believes gaming and tokenization trends hold the most growth potential for Ethereum. Source: Standard Chartered Research\n\nStandard Chartered\u2019s lead analyst believes that the reasons for the massive price increase are gaming, tokenization, upcoming BTC halving, and regulatory breakthroughs that might lead to the launch of an Ethereum ETF in the US. The launch of an ETF is the most immediate potential price catalyst, so let\u2019s explore that further.\n\nEthereum spot ETF could be an immediate price catalyst\n\nOn October 2nd, we saw the launch of nine different ETFs that provide investors with exposure to Ethereum. This includes products launched by asset managers Bitwise, ProShares, VanEck, Valkyrie, Kelly, and VolShares. These ETFs are based on the price of Ethereum futures contracts traded on the CFTC-regulated exchange CME.\n\nJust like with Bitcoin, U.S. investors don\u2019t yet have access to a spot Ethereum ETF. However, there are markets where investors can already buy Ethereum ETFs that actually hold ether. For example, spot Ethereum ETFs are available in both Europe and Canada. Some asset managers are pushing to launch Ethereum spot ETFs in the U.S. market. For example, Cathie Wood\u2019s Ark Invest submitted a filing with the SEC to launch such a product, and Grayscale is looking to convert their Ethereum trust into a spot ETF.\n\nIn early October, former BlackRock managing director Steven Schoenfield told the panel at CCData\u2019s Digital Asset Summit in London that he gives \u201cthree to six months\u201d before the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approves a Bitcoin spot ETF. He also said that he believes that a spot ETF could facilitate up to $200 billion in fresh capital flowing into the Bitcoin market.\n\nIt\u2019s reasonable to assume that approval for an Ethereum spot ETF would follow soon after a Bitcoin spot ETF \u2013 in the end, the SEC considers both assets commodities so there\u2019s no regulatory barrier on that front. It is also reasonable to assume that capital inflows would represent a decent chunk of a Bitcoin ETF.\n\nEthereum price prediction 2024-2030\n\nAccording to our Ethereum price prediction model, ETH could surpass $8,000 by the end of 2025, which is largely in line with the prediction made by Kendrick. This price increase would coincide with the next Bitcoin halving, which is expected to happen in Q1 2024. Historically speaking, BTC halvings have arguably been the most important market events in crypto, driving prices to new highs roughly every four years.\n\nAI predicts Ethereum to reach as high as $12,700 by 2029.\n\nBy the end of the 2020s, the model expects Ethereum to surpass $10,000. Going forward, the price of ETH could reach $35,000 by 2037, which is again broadly in line with the model presented by Kendrick.\n\nIt is worth noting that the Ethereum Rainbow Chart, a logarithmically plotted chart of ETH\u2019s historical and (potential) future price moves, predicts a mean value of ETH by the end of 2028 at roughly $9,200.\n\nThe bottom line: Predictions are one thing, reality is another\n\nYou should note that no matter the quality of prediction models and how many factors are taken into account, there is a decent chance that the future doesn\u2019t pan out as predicted. There are simply too many variables that can impact the markets and render predictions virtually worthless. Still, analyzing historical price movements and creating price prediction models can offer great insight into market movements and serve an important role when trying to understand the behavior of the markets.\n\nThat said, there are sound reasons to assume that ETH might be primed for an upswing in the future. Setting aside the cyclical nature of crypto markets driven by BTC halvings, Ethereum\u2019s role as a financial hub of the crypto ecosystem is undeniable, and if the ecosystem continues to grow, so will Ethereum.\n\nIf you want to learn more about the potential long-term price movements of ETH, check out our Ethereum price predictions for 2040 and 2050."

        "content": "Financial services titan Fidelity is naming leading smart contract platform Ethereum (ETH) and one of its rivals as examples of success.\n\nIn a recent report, the investing giant says that Ethereum and Solana (SOL) are good examples of blockchains with successful network effects and developer bases.\n\nAccording to Fidelity, for a crypto project to ultimately be successful, it must be able to attract talented developers as well as maintain its core user base \u2013 two things the firm says Ethereum and Solana excel at.\n\n\u201cProjects that have shown the ability to be successful and create something promising have done so by attracting the proper talent and retaining their user base. Ethereum and Solana provide a great example of what is possible for a protocol that can attract a large amount of developers, build a usable platform, and gain a loyal network of users. When done right, there is clearly a lot of value that can be created for investors.\u201d\n\nFidelity goes on to say that those who invest in non-Bitcoin (BTC) digital assets tend to take small positions in many different altcoins rather than just one, giving them options in an increasingly complex and growing crypto landscape.\n\n\u201cGiven the increased amount of competition and potential paths of failure for many of these projects, allocating to non-Bitcoin tokens is often done with a venture capital-like mindset. Instead of picking one particular project, investment allocators typically take small positions across many individual names.\n\nThis typically results in seeking out an actively managed solution to deal with the increase in overall complexity. Again, this shows a stark contrast to a simple Bitcoin-only approach to digital assets.\u201d\n\nEthereum is trading for $1,565 at time of writing, a fractional decrease on the day while Solana is moving for $22.07.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson recently gave his thoughts on whether the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had given Ethereum a regulatory free pass as recent rumors suggest.\n\nCardano Founder Alleges Favoritism Toward Ethereum\n\nIn an AMA session shared on X (formerly Twitter), Hoskinson mentioned that the Himman emails and other revelations expose the thought process of the SEC and show that there was unequal application, which he doesn\u2019t see anything wrong with. Furthermore, he believes that none of the Commission\u2019s actions presupposes corruption but only favoritism.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that Hoskinson happens to be a co-founder of Ethereum. However, he was forced to exit the team after he suggested that Ethereum be run as a commercial entity rather than a nonprofit, but this idea didn\u2019t seem to resonate with others on the team.\n\nAs such, one can easily assume that there could be some form of bias in his statement, as he could feel endeared to Ethereum despite the circumstances surrounding his exit. Reacting to the clip, One X user stated that Hoskinson\u2019s \u201cold ETHGATE buddies\u201d may have convinced him to make such statements.\n\nMeanwhile, others in the crypto community criticized his statement, emphasizing that there was really no difference between favoritism and corruption, especially when a government agency is involved. Some went as far as alleging that Hoskinson could well have been involved in the scandal and that he was talking \u201clike a defendant.\u201d\n\nETH price continues to struggle | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nHimman Emails And Other Revelations A Big Deal\n\nWhile Hoskinson may have tried to downplay the Himman emails and other revelations, they undoubtedly lay a foundation as to possible wrongdoings of the Commission. For one, the email showed that Bill Hinman had interacted with Ethereum\u2019s co-founder, Vitalik Buterin before he gave his speech, where he mentioned that ETH wasn\u2019t a security. With this in mind, Buterin could have possibly influenced Hinman\u2019s speech.\n\nThere have also been revelations of how the SEC had close ties with Ethereum, which instantly presupposes a conflict of interest as it becomes harder to regulate or deal fairly with such a body without being influenced by external factors.\n\nMeanwhile, Steven Nerayoff, who was an active participant during Ethereum\u2019s Initial Coin Offering (ICO), continues to allege that the SEC was corrupt in its dealings with Ethereum and that he has evidence to back up his claims.\n\nPro-XRP legal expert John Deaton has also confirmed Nerayoff\u2019s claims as he has seen this supposed evidence under the attorney-client relationship.\n\nIn his announcement last month, Deaton mentioned that Bill Himman\u2019s cross-examination would be of \u201cepic proportions\u201d and even offered to handle that personally if the SEC\u2019s case against Ripple were to go to trial.\n\nFeatured image from Bitcoinist, chart from Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has introduced a groundbreaking proposal to elevate the security, efficiency and scalability of the network.\n\nOne significant challenge Ethereum faces is the substantial entry barrier for solo staking, requiring users to lock in a hefty 32 ETH. Additionally, there have been concerns about centralization within staking pools and the excessive number of signatures required for each block, which can impact the network\u2019s overall performance.\n\nOn Saturday, Buterin unveiled a proposal in light of these challenges to address these issues and enhance the network\u2019s overall functionality. Notably, the proposal introduced a novel concept: a two-tiered staking system comprising two distinct participant categories, namely node operators and delegators.\n\nNode operators, the first category, will assume the crucial role of running node. They will act as validators, staking a significant 32 ETH while simultaneously managing various tasks, such as transaction processing and block generation.\n\nOn the other hand, the second category, delegators, shall hold stakes below the 32 ETH threshold. These participants enjoy the freedom to choose and endorse specific node operators. Their involvement in the network\u2019s consensus process will be more lightweight, imposing no minimum commitments or strict obligations beyond providing collateral.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nImportantly, Buterin underscored that the proposal harbours significant potential advantages for Ethereum and its vibrant user community. From the network\u2019s perspective, he emphasized that its implementation would result in a noteworthy reduction in the number of signatures needed per block, lowering it to around 10,000. According to him, this optimization would attract more delegators and enhance scalability while simultaneously reducing computational overhead.\n\n\u201cThis would also aid decentralization by making it much easier for everyone to run a validating node,\u201d he added.\n\nMoreover, Buterin\u2019s proposal addressed the potential to fortify network security. It introduced hurdles that would make it increasingly challenging for potential attackers to acquire a controlling stake within the network. Furthermore, it unlocked avenues for innovative and flexible staking solutions by leveraging smart contracts, adopting liquidity tokens, and exploring various other mechanisms.\n\nThat said, Buterin clarified that the proposed changes can be implemented at multiple levels of abstraction. These adjustments could find their place within staking pools, in interactions between these pools, and even within the Ethereum protocol itself."

        "content": "A multi-platform staking solution Lido faces its first serious penalty after its validators misbehaved.\n\nLido, a decentralized finance protocol for staking cryptocurrencies, faces a penalty worth 23 ETH (around $35,500) after 20 of its validators have been slashed.\n\nIn an X post on Thursday, Oct. 12, Lido confirmed the incident, saying the slashed validators have been operated by Launchnodes, a pre-synchronized Geth node for staking, which is part of the Lido protocol.\n\n20 slashings have occurred relating to validators operated by the @launchnodes node operators as a part of the Lido protocol.\n\n\n\nLaunchnodes and DAO contributors are investigating.\n\n\n\nThe validators are offline and slashings have ceased while the root cause is being investigated. \u2014 Lido (@LidoFinance) October 11, 2023\n\nNo further details were given so far. Launchnodes is investigating \u201cthe root cause\u201d of the issue while the slashed validators are offline. The team behind the protocol reassured users they are \u201cnot affected apart from a reduction in the daily rewards that will be reflected in tomorrow\u2019s rebase.\u201d\n\nYou might also like: Staking rewards are now taxable, says IRS\n\nAs per Lido\u2019s calculations, the penalty represents about 2.25% of average daily protocol rewards (or 0.00023% of the total value locked in the protocol). The project also noted Launchnodes \u201cimmediately expressed their desire to compensate stakers at the soonest possible time.\u201d It means that stakers will see \u201cno reduced rewards for the day resulting from the outage and slashing.\u201d\n\nOnce future penalties and missed rewards for the slashed validators are finalised (i.e. the validators are withdrawn), a final calculation will be made and @launchnodes have indicated that they will also cover this amount resulting in no lost rewards for stETH holders. \u2014 Lido (@LidoFinance) October 12, 2023\n\nWhat is slashing on Ethereum\n\nSlashing is a severe form of penalty in the Ethereum blockchain that results in the forceful removal of a validator from the network and an associated loss of their staked ETH when a validator breaches the proof-of-stake consensus rules.\n\nHowever, this practice is pretty rare in the ecosystem. In early 2023, a pseudonymous Ethereum community consultant Superphiz pointed out that only 0.04% of Ethereum validators have been slashed over the past three years.\n\nRead more: Vitalik Buterin cautions against staking pools adopting DAOs\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "content": "Thu 12 Oct 2023 \u25aa 4 min of reading \u25aa by Evans S.\n\nThe crypto sphere is abuzz, and Ethereum (ETH) is at the heart of this excitement. As the second-largest cryptocurrency prepares for a potential rise to $8,000, many experts and financial institutions have expressed their opinions, ranging from the most optimistic to the most cautious. Let\u2019s delve into the intricacies of this prediction and discover the factors that could support or contradict this view.\n\nEthereum: A Potential 5x Increase?\n\nBlackRock and JPMorgan are major players, and their entry into the crypto industry is significant. However, alongside them, specialists are deciphering every nuance of the market.\n\nTheir goal? Predict the next major developments. In this dynamic context, every decision matters.\n\nRecent studies by Standard Chartered Bank have sparked enthusiasm among investors. According to their analysis, the value of Ether could reach $8,000 by 2026, as reported by Reuters.\n\nGeoff Kendrick, a respected expert from the bank, relies on the evolution of Ethereum\u2019s use cases. While non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and decentralized finance (DeFi) currently dominate, he anticipates a massive shift towards gaming and tokenization.\n\nThis change would not only represent significant demand but also mark the entry of many traditional industries into the crypto sphere, seeking to capitalize on the advantages offered by Ethereum.\n\nDouble-Edged Perspectives\n\nHowever, despite this optimism, caution is warranted. After an impressive start in October 2023, Ethereum faced selling pressure, falling below the $1,600 mark. Currently, this cryptocurrency hovers around $1,550.\n\nFurthermore, a report from JPMorgan Chase has signaled a 12% decrease in daily transactions on the Ethereum network, with a notable 20% drop in active addresses and an 8% decrease in total value locked.\n\nThe introduction of Ether Futures ETFs has also disappointed, causing ETH to lose ground against its long-time rival, Bitcoin.\n\nCrypto : Entre espoirs et r\u00e9alit\u00e9s\n\nRenowned analyst Benjamin Cowen has a less optimistic view. According to him, Ethereum could even drop to less than $1,200 in the coming months.\n\nNonetheless, it is important to note that Ethereum whales, those investors holding substantial amounts of the currency, remain active.\n\nThe ten largest ETH wallets have recently added 40 million ETH, which could indicate a persistent confidence in the cryptocurrency\u2019s long-term potential.\n\nEthereum\u2019s path to $8,000 is filled with obstacles, challenges, and uncertainties. If the predictions of Standard Chartered Bank come true, it could mark a historic turning point in the crypto world.\n\nHowever, in the crypto industry, caution remains essential. It is crucial to stay well-informed, not to invest beyond one\u2019s means, and to monitor the movements of key players, such as Vitalik Buterin\u2019s recent ETH sale.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program!

        "content": "Amid a difficult week for a large part of the cryptocurrency market, Ethereum (ETH) has continued to record losses, and machine learning (ML) algorithms predict more bad times for the second-largest digital asset by market capitalization in the near future.\n\nSpecifically, ML-based algorithms used by the cryptocurrency price forecasting platform PricePredictions set the price of Ethereum to reach $1,484.94 by October 31, 2023, as per the most recent information obtained by Finbold on October 12.\n\nEthereum 30-day price forecast. Source: PricePredictions\n\nProvided that this prediction, relying on indicators such as relative strength index (RSI), Bollinger Bands (BB), and moving average convergence divergence (MACD), proves correct, it would represent a decline of 4% to the current price of Ethereum.\n\nOn the other hand, the price prediction algorithm over at the crypto analytics websiteCoinCodex is rather bullish on Ethereum, placing its price at $1,784.76 by the last day of October, which would indicate an increase of 15.38%, should it come true.\n\nEthereum price analysis\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum was at press time trading at the price of $1,546.9, down 1.45% on the day, as well as dropping 5.25% across the previous week and losing 3.76% over the past month, according to the most recent charts on October 12.\n\nEthereum 7-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nAt the same time, the 1-week technical analysis (TA) gauges over at the finance and crypto monitoring website TradingView are showing a bearish reading for Ethereum that suggests a \u2018strong sell\u2019 at 16, as based on oscillators in the \u2018sell\u2019 position at 2 and moving averages (MA) suggesting a \u2018strong sell\u2019 at 14.\n\nEthereum 1-week sentiment gauges. Source: TradingView\n\nAll things considered, Ethereum\u2019s long-term prospects remain promising, but its short-term upward movements are, indeed, under threat, partially due to the offloading or redistribution of more than 5 million ETH by whales, which have been consistently cashing in on higher prices, as Finbold reported on October 10.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "content": "After a strong start to the month of October 2023, the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency Ethereum (ETH) has come under significant selling pressure slipping under $1,600 earlier this week.\n\nAt press time, ETH is trading at a price of $1,558 with a market cap of $187 billion. Popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez stated that the Ethereum price has been relatively stable within a consistent range. Notably, the TD Sequential indicator has generated a buy signal near the lower boundary of this range, indicating the potential for ETH to recover to $1,630.\n\nadvertisement\n\nHowever, it\u2019s essential to exercise caution. Should the ETH price close below the $1,530 mark, it could invalidate the bullish outlook.\n\nMixed Reviews on Ethereum\n\nAs per the Reuters report on Wednesday, October 11, Standard Chartered Bank expects the ETH price to touch $8,000 within the next two years or utmost by early 2026. This optimistic perspective is grounded in Ethereum\u2019s expanding presence in smart contracts, gaming, and the tokenization of conventional assets. Additionally, Geoff Kendrick, Head of FX Research at Standard Chartered, suggested a more ambitious structural valuation in the long term, ranging from $26,000 to $35,000 by 2040, driven by emerging real-world use cases.\n\nHowever, not everyone is bullish about Ethereum going ahead. Following the Shanghai upgrade in April, there was a 12% reduction in daily transactions on the Ethereum network, according to a report from JPMorgan Chase. Analysts at the bank, led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, raised concerns about the diminishing network activity on the platform.\n\nThere was a substantial 20% decline in daily active addresses. Additionally, the total value locked on the Ethereum network dropped by 8%. Furthermore, the introduction of nine Ether futures ETFs yielded disappointing results. As a result, ETH has been losing ground to Bitcoin. Ethereum Price Predictions As said, Ethereum is trading in the crucial demand zone in the range between $1,530-$1,630 levels. Lately, Benjamin Cowen, a renowned analyst known for his precision, has expressed his views on Ethereum through his YouTube channel. He predicts that Ethereum, a widely recognized cryptocurrency, is likely to experience a decrease in value by the end of this year. \u201cIn my opinion, the most likely outcome is that Ethereum will drop to less than $1,200 within the next two and a half months, and maybe even lower,\u201d he noted. However, Ethereum whales have continued to show hands with the top 10 largest ETH wallets adding 40 million ETH recently."

        "content": "Ethereum prices might be stagnant at spot rates, weaving around the $1,540 and $1,560 zone, looking at technical charts. However, amid this period of consolidation and holders worrying about Ethereum\u2019s prospects, Kaiko notes that the coin\u2019s open interest has been gradually rising since September 2023.\n\nEthereum Open Interest Rising: What Does It Mean?\n\nAs of October 10, Kaiko observes that there are more than 2.2 million contracts, and the number has been rising steadily over the past few trading weeks. With increasing open interest, it can hint that bulls are in the equation, which may support prices now that prices are under immense pressure.\n\nIn crypto trading, open interest is the total number of outstanding derivative contracts of a given coin. Meanwhile, derivatives are contracts that derive value from the underlying asset, in this case, Ethereum. Herein, the total open interest data is accrued from ETH options, futures, and perpetual futures from platforms where traders can use leverage.\n\nThere can be different interpretations of open interest depending on the market state. Since open interest includes long and short positions at any time, gauging the directions of how market participants are posting trades can be challenging.\n\nEven so, rising open interest indicates that more traders are opening positions, which can be seen as bullish, especially if prices are expanding. Conversely, falling open interest suggests that traders are exiting, which means waning momentum and bearish sentiment.\n\nETH Consolidates Even After Ethereum Futures ETF Approval\n\nBased on this, Ethereum remains in a critical position and support. Notably, the coin is moving sideways with low trading volumes.\n\nFrom the daily chart, ETH is around the $1,500 and $1,550 primary support. Though buyers appear to be in control, since prices are boxed inside the June to July 2023 trade range, any break below the support zone may trigger more losses.\n\nThe general optimism explaining rising open interest could be due to the recent approval of Ethereum Futures exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved multiple Ethereum Futures ETFs for the first time.\n\nThis decision saw Ethereum prices edge higher in early October. Though prices have since contracted, institutional investors can now find exposure in Ethereum via structured and regulated products approved by the stringent regulator.\n\nIt is unclear whether the rising ETH open interest signals strength and if the coin will recover going forward. From the daily chart, ETH has strong liquidation at around the $1,750 level and remains consolidated.\n\nFeature image from Canva, chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

At the time of writing, BRICK was trading at $0.13 while Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC), Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) were down 1.1% and 1.20% respectively.\n\nThe majority of the trading volume for Bricks occurred on the cryptocurrency exchange Kraken, with the total figure across all exchanges reaching nearly $649,000.\n\nThis represents an astonishing 78% increase compared to the previous 24-hour period, according to data from CoinGecko.\n\nBricks is an ERC-20 token that was distributed to active members of the Fortnite subreddit, one of the largest Reddit communities focused on the popular Fortnite: Battle Royale game developed by Epic Games. The token\u2019s value had experienced a surge in August as excitement surrounding other Reddit community tokens, such as r/cryptocurrency\u2019s Moons (MOON), also gained momentum.\n\nAlthough the recent surge in Bricks\u2019 value is significant, it is important to note that liquidity remains relatively thin across all exchanges.\n\nWill The SEC Finally Approve Long-Awaited Bitcoin Spot ETF?

Discover SCENE\n\nLido Finance, the leading liquid staking protocol, faces a minimum penalty of 20 Ethereum before it can withdraw its ETH from validators that were slashed.\n\nOn Wednesday, 20 validators associated with Launchnodes, one of Lido\u2019s node operators, got slashed from the Ethereum network, recording the largest number of validators slashed within a day this year.\n\nAccording to an update by Lido, the initial loss to the protocol is around 20 ETH with \u201cadditional penalties\u201d to be believed for inactivity before exiting the network.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSlashing is the process by which validators are forcibly removed from a proof-of-stake network for failing to fulfill their validator responsibilities properly, such as prolonged downtime.\n\nIt also involves a slashing penalty of 1/32 ETH for a maximum of 1 ETH per slashed validator that is deducted and burnt immediately. It can be followed by additional penalties.\n\nThese penalties are charged over the next 36 days before the validator can withdraw their staked amount, per Ethereum.org. Currently, a validator exit is only possible after November 17.\n\nLaunchnodes notified that the problem occurred because of \u201cinfrastructure and web3 signer configuration issues.\u201d\n\nThe node operator told Decrypt that \"all of Launchnodes' infrastructure is back up and fully operational, and Lido has been reimbursed in full for all losses incurred to date, ensuring that no stETH holder has suffered any loss.\"\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLido Finance did not immediately respond to Decrypt\u2019s request for comment.\n\nLast slashing, best slashing\n\nDuring the last major slashing event, when 12 validators were slashed at once on August 26, the loss in penalties to each validator was less than 1.10 ETH.\n\nIn response to such events, the Lido team also highlighted that the protocol has built a reserve \u201ccover fund of approximately 6,200 ETH to help mitigate the slashing impact.\u201d\n\nThe Lido DAO has a cover fund of ~6,200 stETH to help mitigate the slashing impact, but it does not trigger automatically.https://t.co/E0vHMMybbN In all previous instances, damages have been covered by the relevant operator(s), or through this fund. \u2014 Lido (@LidoFinance) October 11, 2023\n\nThe team is waiting to determine the extent of the losses, which it said cannot be known \u201cahead of time.\u201d\n\nThe community will later decide whether the \u201cLido DAO cover fund should compensate affected holders.\u201d"

He really is interested in making it so that Bitcoin can process millions of transactions per second.\u201d\n\nSuper Testnet said he doesn\u2019t want BitVM to be flooded with EVM-like tokens because it\u2019ll bring bad actors to Bitcoin:\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to see everything from the Ethereum ecosystem because most of it is Ponzi schemes.\u201d\n\nBuilding a decentralized exchange on Bitcoin would be a \u201cstep backward,\u201d he added.\n\nMeanwhile, Super Testnet notes that BitVM won\u2019t be an \u201cinstant death\u201d for Ethereum\u2019s altcoins, as some have suggested, though it could take demand away from them.\n\nHot Off the Press: BitVM White Paper Drops!

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nIn a recent update, esteemed crypto market analyst Benjamin Cowen, armed with a PhD in Engineering, has sounded a grave warning about Ethereum's fate on the crypto market. Cowen, who has gained prominence for his insightful analyses, shared his latest findings on the trajectory of Ethereum (ETH) against Bitcoin (BTC), which may send shockwaves through the crypto space.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Cowen's analysis, Ethereum is set to endure a significant setback, with a projected 40% fall against Bitcoin. Cowen substantiated his claim by pointing to the continuous decline of the ETH/BTC ratio, emphasizing that this decline might mark the culmination of the altcoin reckoning.\n\nThe expert's prediction was underscored by a detailed chart he shared on social media, illustrating Ethereum's potential fall from its current position of 0.057 BTC to a worrisome low of 0.035 BTC.\n\nJust a continuous bleed by #ETH / #BTC.\n\n\n\nRemember the collapse of the ETH/BTC ratio could also correspond to the end of the altcoin reckoning. pic.twitter.com/dhaNiBNz3B \u2014 Benjamin Cowen (@intocryptoverse) October 10, 2023\n\nThis dire forecast is not the first of its kind from Cowen. Back in June, he first expressed his bearish sentiment on Ethereum against Bitcoin, foreseeing the collapse of the ETH/BTC ratio. Despite the gradual pace of the decline, Cowen remained steadfast in his analysis, reiterating his concerns last week about the ongoing downtrend.\n\nCowen's prediction is based on his assessment of the growing dominance of Bitcoin and the consistent drain of liquidity from the broader cryptocurrency market. As Bitcoin continues to assert its dominance, the allure of altcoins like ETH may wane, potentially leading to the projected devaluation against BTC."

        "content": "After a brief uptick, Ethereum faced a significant rejection, causing the price to retreat towards the critical support zone at $1.5K.\n\nCurrently, there is a strong attempt to break below this crucial support. If successful, the market may experience sharp declines.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nThe Daily Chart\n\nLooking at the daily chart, Ethereum initially showed strong bullish momentum after finding support around the $1.5K range. However, upon reaching the 100-day moving average at around $1.7K, Ethereum was rejected, leading to a steep downtrend.\n\nThis downtrend returned to the broken 100-day moving average, indicating a highly bearish trajectory for ETH\u2019s price. It has now revisited its previous major swing low at $1529, aligning with the significant support level of the 61.8% Fibonacci threshold. This zone serves as the final defense for the bulls, and a breach below it could trigger a rapid market cascade.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart\n\nAnalyzing the 4-hour chart, we can see a period of sideways consolidation marked by a descending wedge pattern. This consolidation range is bounded by the significant $1.5K support and the notable $1.7K resistance. However, the price recently faced rejection from the upper boundary of this range, leading to a steep downtrend that approached the lower boundary.\n\nThe market is on the verge of breaking below the $1.5K support, with prevailing bearish sentiment strengthening the sellers\u2019 position. A break below this support has become a distinct possibility.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that if buyers manage to overpower the sellers, a sudden reversal could occur, potentially resulting in the liquidation of numerous short positions.\n\nOn-chain Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nThe chart below illustrates the Estimated Leverage Ratio metric in relation to ETH\u2019s price. It provides insights into the average leverage utilized by participants in the futures market. Higher values indicate greater leverage and risk taken by traders in the derivatives market.\n\nHistorically, the metric had been in a downtrend, reaching a yearly low. This signaled a period of stability in the futures market, with traders employing lower leverage. However, there has been a notable increase in the Estimated Leverage Ratio in recent weeks. While it hasn\u2019t reached alarming levels yet, this uptick suggests a growing enthusiasm in the futures market, possibly leading to heightened leverage usage.\n\nIf this surge is sustained, it could indicate an overheating of the futures market. Although the situation isn\u2019t alarming at the moment, it is important to view the continued elevation of this metric with caution. Further increases could trigger a short or long-squeeze event, resulting in sudden and significant movements in Ethereum\u2019s price."

The US PPI for September was a bit stronger than expectations, while US Fed's minutes showed most expect another round of rate hikes to complete the current tightening cycle.\n\n\n\nIn other reports, the Hamas terrorist organization and its affiliates have received millions, about $93 million, in crypto donations between August 2021 to June 2023, said Wall Street Journal based on data from Elliptic, a forensics firm, and BitOK, a Tel Aviv software company. Crypto is often accused and criticized as a subterfuge financing method for such militant groups.\n\n\n\nBitcoin was seen in the falling trajectory as the largest crypto token dropped about a per cent but managed to hold $26,500-levels. Its largest peer, Ethereum, was also seen in red, falling maringally but it was holding above $1,560-mark. Action in the altcoins was on the mixed side.\n\n\n\nBitcoin's price dipped below $27,000 as market participants await the US inflation data for September. This signals an active effort by bears to gain control of the market, said Edul Patel, Co-Founder & CEO at Mudrex. \"Bitcoin will now need to break through the $27,000 resistance or could potentially receive support around $26,600. Ethereum is trading around the $1560 mark,\" he said.\n\n\n\nAll top crypto tokens were trading mixed on Thursday. Among the losers, Litecoin dropped about 3 per cent, while Solana was down about 2 per cent. Dogecoin and Polkadot shed about a per cent each. Among the gainers, Chainlink rallied more than 2 per cent, while Toncoin was up about a per cent.\n\n\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market cap was trading lower, dropping to $1.05 trillion-mark, as it declined less than half-a-per cent in the last 24 hours. However, the total trading volumes rose over 2 per cent to $25.81 billion.\n\n\n\nBTC gained a significant downward momentum as it has continued to slide for three days in a row post touching the all-important $28,500-mark. Even though the $26,500 mark is currently acting as support, any further decline may again lead to a further sell-off that is likely to take Bitcoin down to $24,000 or beyond, said Shubham Hudda, Senior Manager at CoinSwitch Markets Desk.\n\n\n\n\"In other news, big development has been seen in the traditional banking sector as one of the world\u2019s largest banks- JPMorgan\u2019s in-house blockchain Onyx has launched its tokenized collateral network,\" he said. \"Investors across financial markets, including crypto, are looking forward to the US CPI data, which is expected to be out later in the day.\"\n\n\n\nImage: Crypto-chart-price\n\n\n\nTech View by WazirX Trade Desk\n\nThe REQ utility token, introduced in 2017, plays a crucial role in upholding the reliability and robustness of the Request Network, a decentralized payment system built on the Ethereum platform that empowers individuals to request payments and securely receive funds.\n\n\n\nImage: Chart-Request\n\n\n\nOn the weekly time-frame, the price for REQ/USDT surged by nearly 50% in the last week.

Never invest unless you\u2019re prepared to lose all the money you invest.\n\nEthereum (ETH) is currently on a terrible run of form, closing in the red for five straight days.\n\nWith the bearish momentum showing no signs of slowing, we asked ChatGPT about Ethereum\u2019s price prospects for 2024 and whether the token can rebound.\n\nWe also asked ChatGPT which alternative cryptos could be poised for growth next year \u2013 with Bitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX) emerging as the model\u2019s top contender.\n\nEthereum Prices Slides Below Key Support Levels as Bearish Momentum Builds\n\nEthereum\u2019s price has struggled to gain momentum in the past few days, pulling back over 11% from last week\u2019s high of $1,744.\n\nThe token now trades around $1,553, putting ETH below key levels like the 50-day exponential moving average (EMA).\n\nMultiple technical indicators point to further downside for ETH in the near term, such as the MACD, which shows that bearish momentum is rapidly accelerating.\n\nETH is also fast approaching the $1,532 level, which served as support in early September.\n\nFailing to hold this level could trigger a steeper drop down to $1,500 \u2013 which hasn\u2019t been tapped since March.\n\nGiven that the Ethereum Fear & Greed Index from CFGI.io is now hovering dangerously close to \u201cFear\u201d levels, it\u2019s clear that investor sentiment is deteriorating, potentially exacerbating ETH\u2019s decline.\n\nChatGPT Predicts $2,000 \u2013 $3,000 ETH by 2024 Despite Current Conditions\n\nWhen prompted, ChatGPT provided an optimistic yet grounded price forecast for Ethereum in 2024.\n\nThe model believes that ETH could reach between $2,000 and $3,000 by 2024, assuming that broader market sentiment improves.\n\nChatGPT based this target primarily on the upcoming Bitcoin halving next Spring, which has historically signaled the start of a new crypto bull market cycle.\n\nOpenAI\u2019s model expects this macro environment to lift Ethereum from its slump, especially if the network sees increased adoption.\n\nHowever, ChatGPT did caution that the markets could remain challenged in the short term, noting that low futures ETF volumes and overall weakness could persist through the end of 2023.\n\nAll in all, ChatGPT\u2019s forecast will likely be warmly received by ETH holders, who could be in store for a brighter future if market dynamics align.\n\nWhich Other Cryptos Does ChatGPT Believe Could Rise in 2024?\n\nWith ETH\u2019s future uncertain, many investors are diversifying their portfolios by looking at other potential crypto stars.\n\nChatGPT has highlighted several projects that could be set for a breakout \u2013 with Bitcoin Minetrix emerging as a notable contender.\n\nChatGPT Predicts Up To 40x Gains for Bitcoin Minetrix as Presale Raises Over $1.1m\n\nBitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX) is an exciting new crypto project that aims to make Bitcoin mining more accessible through a decentralized \u201cStake-to-Mine\u201d model.\n\nThe project allows users to purchase and stake BTCMTX tokens to earn \u201cmining credits,\u201d which can then be exchanged for BTC cloud mining power.\n\nBTCMTX tokens are currently available via presale at just $0.011 \u2013 a strategy that has helped raise over $1.1 million in just three weeks.\n\nBitcoin Minetrix boasts appealing features like a user-controlled dashboard, no long-term commitments, and a low cost of entry compared to traditional cloud mining services.\n\nThese features have helped generate a massive buzz around Bitcoin Minetrix\u2019s presale, with YouTuber Connor Kenny highlighting the platform\u2019s passive income potential.\n\nWhen asked about a potential BTCMTX price prediction for 2024, ChatGPT forecasted optimistic yet realistic targets.\n\nIt believes that if Bitcoin Minetrix can meet its roadmap milestones and gain modest adoption once launched, its token could potentially trade between $0.20 and $0.40 in 2024.\n\nThis would represent returns of 20x to 40x for those who invest during Stage 1 of the ongoing presale phase.\n\nUltimately, although ChatGPT\u2019s prediction is entirely hypothetical, it highlights the potential upside for early investors if Bitcoin Minetrix can deliver on its unique value proposition.\n\nVisit Bitcoin Minetrix Presale"

        "content": "Press Releases are sponsored content and not a part of Finbold's editorial content. For a full disclaimer, please click here. If you encounter any issues, kindly report them to [email protected]. Crypto assets/products can be highly risky. Never invest unless you\u2019re prepared to lose all the money you invest.\n\nIn the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrency, where volatility often dictates the mood of the market, three top crypto coins have captured investors\u2019 attention. While Ethereum is showing signs of a bullish turnaround, Neo and InQubeta ($QUBE) are also positioning themselves as frontrunners in this race of technological advancement and investment returns.\n\nInQubeta ($QUBE): The Best ICO in AI Crypto space?\n\nEven before we delve into the dynamics of Ethereum and Neo, it\u2019s essential to spotlight InQubeta, a name that has been resonating louder and louder within the corridors of blockchain and AI technology. As we stand on the cusp of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, where AI technology is poised to reshape industries, InQubeta emerges as a beacon of hope for investors seeking entry into this realm.\n\nA revolutionary platform, InQubeta offers a unique proposition \u2013 fractional investments in promising AI start-ups through its proprietary QUBE token. The opportunities are minted into trending NFTs, which represent a stake in growing ventures. This democratizes the investment landscape, bridging the often-wide gap between innovative start-ups and potential investors.\n\nInQubeta\u2019s model is not merely a conceptual novelty; its presale has witnessed an overwhelming response, raising over $3.4 million, which speaks volumes about its promise and the trust of its community. The deflationary ERC20 coin also rewards its holders through staking, establishing it as the best crypto investment option for those forecasting the growth trajectory of AI technology start-ups.\n\nEthereum (ETH): The Bullish Resurgence\n\nTurning our attention to one of the best altcoins, its current trading trajectory has caught the eye of many technical analysts. The Falling Wedge pattern, generally considered a bullish signal, seems to be indicating that Ethereum is gearing up for a significant move. This pattern often suggests that selling pressure is tapering off, pointing towards a possible reversal.\n\nThe real catch here is Ethereum\u2019s position relative to the crucial $2,000 threshold. With the Falling Wedge in play and various other indicators turning favorable, Ethereum breaking past this mark appears increasingly likely. Should it push through, this could pave the way for further upward momentum, possibly reigniting enthusiasm among Ethereum enthusiasts and investors.\n\nNeo (NEO): The Dark Horse on the Rise\n\nNeo, often termed the \u201cEthereum of China,\u201d has consistently showcased its capabilities as a robust platform for creating a range of decentralized applications. With its unique dual-token mechanism and focus on digital identity and assets, Neo has carved its niche in the blockchain space.\n\nThough not as much in the limelight as Ethereum, recent movements and developments associated with Neo hint at a simmering potential waiting to be unleashed. Investors are keenly observing its trajectory, weighing the possibilities it presents in the broader crypto landscape.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nAs the crypto market continues to navigate through a maze of uncertainties and promises, Ethereum\u2019s prospective breakthrough, combined with the potential of Neo and the burgeoning promise of InQubeta, presents a narrative of opportunities for investors. While Ethereum\u2019s technicals suggest a bullish horizon, InQubeta, with its groundbreaking model, is rapidly cementing its position as a game-changer in the AI-centric crypto space. Meanwhile, Neo, with its unique offerings, is quietly gearing up for what could be a significant phase of growth.\n\nIt\u2019s an exciting time to be a part of the crypto ecosystem. With such promising narratives unfolding, the future indeed seems laden with possibilities.\n\nVisit InQubeta Presale\n\nJoin The InQubeta Communities"

        "content": "A closely followed crypto strategist says he is flipping bullish on Bitcoin (BTC) after the king crypto dipped below the $28,000 level.\n\nPseudonymous analyst Credible Crypto tells his 346,700 followers on the social media platform X that BTC will likely reverse its downtrend after finding support at a key level.\n\n\u201cDid you flip bullish at the highs, anon?\n\nJust as I was short-term bearish at the highs a couple of days ago it\u2019s almost time to shift back to full bull.\n\nOnce we take the equal lows at $27,100 you\u2019re playing with fire if you\u2019re selling/short imo (in my opinion). HTF (high time frame) bullish above $24,800 means longs are the play under $27,000 imo.\u201d\n\nThe trader also warns that Bitcoin may dip below the key $27,000 level before the next leg up.\n\n\u201cTargeting $27,100 at minimum with a test of the mid-range at $26,700 seeming highly likely as well. Zooming out for some additional context, you can see that we have tons of liquidity built up below us after taking liquidity above with plenty of rejection wicks to the upside.\n\nMeanwhile, OI (open interest) is peaking and has hit levels that have marked a local top the last five out of five times. The direction we are headed here is clear imo. The real question is how low we will go.\n\nRemember still high timeframe bullish and don\u2019t expect $24,800 to be breached. I think we test the midrange and if that holds, our bottom could come \u2018early.\u2019 Otherwise, we may be blessed with a quick push under $26,000 (but above $24,800) for an excellent low-risk, high-reward entry once more.\u201d\n\nBTC is trading for $27,441 at time of writing, down 0.6% in the last 24 hours.\n\nThe trader also looks at Ethereum (ETH) against Bitcoin and predicts ETH/BTC is heading even lower in the near term before a trend reversal.\n\n\u201cETH/BTC is down nearly 30% from when I made this post calling for a 50%-plus drop on the pairing. I know many are eyeing up current levels for a higher low/bottom on the pairing, but with BTC\u2019s largest upside moves yet to come, we are going much much lower on ETH/BTC imo.\n\nAfter this bleed-down comes a mega melt-up. We get to enjoy the ride on BTC and then have the chance to enjoy a bigger ride on ETH and other alts soon after. Don\u2019t fear it, embrace it.\u201d\n\nETH/BTC is trading for 0.057 BTC ($1,567) at time of writing.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

The move appears to be the first to formally engage its community on how to react to the SEC\u2019s probe.\n\nBarnBridge community can vote in favor of its founders Tyler Ward and Troy Murray, to comply with the regulator\u2019s orders against the firm. They can also vote in favor for the BarnBridge Treasury to pay all \u201cdisgorgement\u201d amounts or fines required by the SEC order.\n\nBarnBridge products are powered by Ethereum, focusing on tokenizing risk exposure. They provide users new ways to hedge their positions.\n\nHolders can also vote to authorize Douglas Park, the legal counsel to BarnBridge, to sign the final version of the SEC order on behalf of the DeFi protocol, the snapshot post read.\n\nBarnBridge Token Holders Voted to Retain Legal Counsel\n\nIn July, the protocol\u2019s token holders were asked to vote on a proposal whether to retain the law firm Douglas Park for the DAO \u201cfor various legal work.\u201d\n\nThis came after Douglas Park posted on the platform\u2019s Discord channel in July, revealing that the platform and individuals have come under the eyes of the SEC investigation. Park suggested \u201call work\u201d on BarnBridge-related products including liquidity pools should halt in order to \u201creduce potential further legal liability.\u201d\n\nSome decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) members raised suspicions over the announcement made by Douglas Park. However, co-founder Tyler Ward shortly after confirmed Park\u2019s message was true regarding the regulator\u2019s probe on BarnBridge."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nLeading decentralized exchange Uniswap released a mobile crypto wallet for Android on Thursday, months after doing the same on Apple\u2019s iOS platform.\n\nThe app is currently in beta while the company invites members of the DeFi community to help it test the wallet before it\u2019s released more widely to users. As per Uniswap\u2019s Twitter feed, some 35,000 users have already signed up to the waitlist.\n\nIn line with the beta launch, the Uniswap Labs team will also open-source the code as part of its Trail of Bits audit. Trail of Bits is a cybersecurity company that offers blockchain auditing, and develops Web3 tools that identify and fix vulnerabilities in smart contracts and other parts of code.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWEN ANDROID?\u201d How about now? \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25 \ud83e\udef3\n\n\ud83c\udfa4 The Uniswap wallet is coming to Android users \ud83c\udf10 The beta is LIVE \u2014 sign up here to get early access \u2705https://t.co/9OHhpSqbez pic.twitter.com/vXsn2NS5Sx \u2014 Uniswap Labs \ud83e\udd84 (@Uniswap) October 12, 2023\n\nBridgett Frey, a spokesperson for Uniswap Labs, told Decrypt that the Android app is launching today in beta to \u201censure we iron out\u201d any issues as the firm onboards new users, with a broader release expected before the end of the year.\n\nAccording to the Uniswap team, the newly unveiled wallet comes with a set of features for what the firm thinks \u201cmakes a great swap.\u201d A blog post announcing the app\u2019s beta launch promises split-second swaps, easy discovery of new tokens, and transparent pricing that seeks to highlight fees that aren\u2019t readily apparent to traders.\n\nAnother feature is automatic switching between blockchain mainnets, like Ethereum, and layer-2 scaling networks like Optimism or Arbitrum.\n\nFor users looking to swap between layers, Uniswap Labs says the Android wallet will automatically guess the desired target and make the switch. It will offer access to Arbitrum, Polygon, Optimism, Base and BNB Chain.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTwo common exploits in DeFi are known as sandwich and frontrunning attacks. The former refers to when an attacker sandwiches a swap between two transactions to make a profit; the latter occurs when an attacker sees a pending transaction, and knowing the price for which a token will be swapped, submits their own swap.\n\nIn order to defend users against these types of attacks, Uniswap has added \u201cswap protection\u201d to the Android mobile wallet. Essentially, swaps will now default to a private transaction pool, defending users from such MEV attacks.\n\nToday\u2019s launch comes six months after Uniswap launched a version of the app for the Apple iPhone, which the Uniswap Labs team said became a top three download the month it launched. A Uniswap Labs spokesperson did not immediately provide download statistics.\n\nReferring to today's release, Frey told Decrypt that Uniswap Labs \u201calways knew that we would want to quickly follow the iOS launch with an Android app, as Uniswap is a global product and much of the world does not use Apple.\u201d\n\nThe protocol has been under regulatory fire in recent months, after a class action lawsuit was filed against it. The case against Uniswap was ultimately tossed out by New York Judge Katherine Polk Failla, in a ruling that a legal scholar dubbed \u201ca strange kind of anomaly.\u201d"

        "content": "The cryptocurrency market has been under significant pressure recently, shedding more than 3% in value in just the past 24 hours. Among the major players, Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, seems to be on a bearish trajectory. This raises the question: Will Ethereum reach $1,000 mark once more?\n\nWhy is Ethereum Down?\n\nThe crypto market\u2019s resilience has been tested as prices failed to gain momentum. The purchasing power that typically drives up prices was noticeably absent. Instead of bolstering their crypto holdings, investors have become more cautious, pulling back on their acquisitions. This hesitancy can be attributed, in part, to the stock market\u2019s slight retraction, which itself is a reaction to the escalating conflict in the Middle East, particularly between Israel and Gaza. The geopolitical tensions have cast a shadow of uncertainty over global financial markets, including the realm of cryptocurrencies.\n\nEthereum Price Analysis: Ethereum Crash?\n\nA closer look at Ethereum\u2019s price movement reveals a concerning trend for its holders. Starting October at a price of $1,735, Ethereum has since declined to its current price of $1,562, marking a drop of approximately 10%. Over the past week alone, Ethereum has seen a reduction of more than 5% in its value. Such a rapid decline in a short span is a cause for concern for many investors and market analysts.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction: The Road to $1,000?\n\nThe critical question on many investors\u2019 minds is whether Ethereum could slide to the $1,000 mark. If Ethereum\u2019s price breaks below the significant support level of $1,500, it could indeed pave the way for a further decline towards $1,000. However, before reaching that point, Ethereum would need to breach several other support levels at $1,320 and $1,200. These support levels will be crucial in determining the cryptocurrency\u2019s medium-term trajectory.\n\nIf the broader crypto market continues its bearish trend, Ethereum\u2019s price could follow suit. The potential for Ethereum to drop to $1,000 is real, especially if global uncertainties persist and investor confidence remains shaken.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou might also like\n\nMore from Altcoin"

        "content": "The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency Ethereum has come under strong selling pressure with ETH price facing strong rejection at $1,750 levels. At press time, ETH is trading 1.73% down at a price of $1,560 and a market cap of $187 billion.\n\nEthereum Whales Show Strength\n\nAs per the on-chain data, Ethereum whales have continued to show major strength despite the strong selling pressure. The 10 largest whale addresses have accumulated a staggering 40 million ETH recently.\n\nadvertisement\n\nOn-chain data provider Santiment reported that the wealthiest Ethereum addresses, both on and off exchanges, continue to accumulate more wealth while Ethereum\u2019s market value remains slightly above $1,570. At present, approximately 8.51% of all Ethereum ($ETH) is held on exchange platforms, while the top 10 non-exchange addresses collectively possess an impressive 39.22 million $ETH.\n\nHowever, amid the current selling pressure, Ethereum has been losing ground to Bitcoin. The percentage of total market capitalization held by Ether in the $1 trillion crypto market decreased from approximately 18.4% at the beginning of the year to 17.8%. While the ETH market continues to drop further, the BTC market share has soared past 50%.\n\nOn the other hand, On Monday, the Ethereum Foundation converted approximately $2.7 million worth of Ether into the stablecoin USDC through a sale. This has further induced some selling pressure on the world\u2019s second-largest crypto. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez noted that there could be a major sell-off below $1,530 levels.\n\n#Ethereum is hovering above a critical demand zone. Keep a close watch, as a daily close below $1,530 could signal a steep correction ahead for $ETH. pic.twitter.com/5qLuXTXOtr \u2014 Ali (@ali_charts) October 10, 2023\n\nEthereum (ETH) Price Analysis\n\nAs of press time, the ETH price is trading just above the crucial support level of $1,550. However, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the Awesome Oscillator (AO) indicators have both crossed below their respective mean levels of 50 and 0. This indicates a notable increase in bearish momentum.\n\nLooking ahead, investors should anticipate the Ethereum price to potentially retest the next support level at $1,309.\n\nRegardless of the bearish signs, if external factors like news or macro events produce a strong bullish spike, it could shift the winds quickly. In such a case, if the Ethereum price flips the $1,727 hurdle into a support floor, it will invalidate the bearish outlook. This move could further propel ETH to retest the $2,030 hurdle.\n\nThe past week served as a crucial gauge for Ethereum investors as the United States saw the introduction of six futures-based ETFs. However, these new ETFs managed to gather only slightly below $10 million in their initial week, indicating a lukewarm response from investors."

        "title": "Ethereum DeFi Exchange AirSwap Rolls Out NFT Marketplace - Decrypt",
        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nAirSwap launched several new features for users of its decentralized exchange on Tuesday, including a decentralized NFT marketplace, new over-the-counter (OTC) trading features, and voter rewards.\n\nThe move to support a broader decentralized economy aligns with AirSwap\u2019s ethos, co-founder Don Mosites told Decrypt in an exclusive interview.\n\n\u201cThe underlying mission is to bring the idea that decentralized trading is good for everyone to NFTs,\u201d Mosites said. \u201cCentralized venues over the years have grappled with multiple issues, whether its hacks or mismanagement\u2014you run the same risk with NFT platforms.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLaunched in 2017 by founders Michael Oved and Don Mosites, AirSwap is a cryptocurrency exchange that lets users buy and sell digital assets without a third-party intermediary. In 2020, AirSwap\u2019s original developer, Fluidity, was acquired by blockchain software technology company ConsenSys in May 2020. The last major update to the AirSwap decentralized exchange launched in November 2021. (Disclosure: ConsenSys Mesh is one of 22 investors in Decrypt.)\n\nAlso known as a DEX, a decentralized exchange uses smart contracts to facilitate trading between individuals but does not require them to deposit the coins before the trade can occur. Other popular decentralized exchanges include Uniswap, PancakeSwap, SushiSwap, Balancer, and Curve.\n\nWhile proponents of decentralized exchanges champion the benefits of their peer-to-peer systems, DEXs have become a tempting target for cybercriminals.\n\nIn July, the U.S. Department of Justice charged engineer Shakeeb Ahmed with defrauding an unnamed decentralized exchange and allegedly stealing $9 million in crypto in 2022. In August, RocketSwap\u2014the second-largest decentralized exchange by trading volume on Base\u2014was hacked for around $866,500 after a private key was compromised on their servers.\n\nIn addition to the new NFT marketplace, another feature of the updated AirSwap platform, Mosites said, is a more robust OTC trading service, built because the development team wanted to create a space for digital collectibles and design an open-source front-end that can be adapted by community members.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nImage: Airswap\n\n\u201cWe wanted to produce a front end that projects can take for themselves, configure, and run on their own,\u201d Mosites said. \u201cSo they have their own decentralized NFT marketplace for their collections that their communities can rally around.\u201d\n\nIntegral to the AirSwap ecosystem is the AirSwap DAO (decentralized autonomous organization). A DAO is a business structure where control is spread out amongst members. Like DEXs, DAOs use smart contracts, with participants using governance tokens to vote on topics such as fund allocation.\n\nThe DAO label in recent years has often been liberally applied in the Web3 space. However, Mosites insists that token-based voting remains at the heart of a genuine DAO.\n\n\u201cThe purest form of a DAO is a token-based voting system that's able to execute changes in an autonomous way,\u201d Mosites said. \u201cWhatever power you give, it\u2019s up to the designers and is a limited set of functions. It's really a decision-making engine that anyone can participate in, and it is economically driven.\u201d\n\nThe updated AirSwap DAO voter rewards program aims to incentivize community members to actively participate in the DAO and uses the popular decentralized voting system Snapshot to incentivize DAO activity.\n\nImage: Airswap\n\nAs Mosites explained, members stake swapped tokens to gain voting power, and a portion of the protocol fees goes into a reward pool for those participating in the decentralized governance of the DAO. AirSwap claims that since 2021, over 32 million AirSwap AST tokens from over 350 active members have been staked to the existing voter rewards system.\n\n\u201cA lot happens in six years,\u201d Mosites said. \u201cWe look forward to the next six years and welcome other projects and companies to join us on the path to opening up their missions\u2014by putting power into the hands of builders and the people and groups they serve.\u201d\n\nEditor's note: This article was updated after publication to clarify members of the founding team.\n\nAD\n\nAD"

        "content": "Ethereum has struggled alongside Bitcoin through the current bear market climate but this has not stopped bullish predictions for the digital asset. The most recent bullish prediction comes from British multinational bank Standard Chartered which believes that the Ethereum price could climb higher than $8,000.\n\nFactors That Could Trigger The Rise\n\nGeoff Kendrick, Head of Digital Assets Research at Standard Chartered Bank has revealed his forecast for the Ethereum price in a research note. According to the researcher, he sees big things in the future of the digital asset which could climb higher than $8,000 in the coming years.\n\nTalking about the asset\u2019s valuation, Kendrick points toward the many use cases for Ethereum that have emerged over the years but also sees more use cases emerging as time goes on. One of those is the much-coveted gaming and asset tokenization sector.\n\nAlso, the Standard Chartered researcher said that they expect that Ethereum will see more growth than the pioneer cryptocurrency, Bitcoin. While he expects Bitcoin to rise 3.5x, they believe Ethereum will rise 5 from current levels.\n\n\u201cWe think the path higher for ETH prices may take longer than for BTC, but we see ETH eventually reaching a higher price multiple than BTC relative to current levels (5.0x versus 3.5x),\u201d the researcher said.\n\nHe also believes that Ethereum would go on to further register its dominance in the space, especially with the Layer 2 blockchains such as Arbitrum that have popped up to enhance the network. This, he believes, would lead to an increase in the Ethereum profit-earnings ratio (P/E ratio).\n\nETH price succumbs to bear pressure | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nEthereum Could Climb Above $8,000\n\nIn terms of actual dollar values, $8,000 is not the only figure that the researcher dropped for the Ethereum price. The expectations for the digital asset exceed this four-digit figure right into the five-digit territory as Kendrick believes ETH could rise to anywhere between $26,000 and $35,000.\n\nAs for when this might happen, the researcher seems to be targeting the next bull market as he expects the factors that will drive this value growth to happen between 2025-2026. \u201cWe see the $8,000 level as a stepping stone to our long-term \u2018structural\u2019 valuation estimate of $26,000-$35,000,\u201d he said in the note. Then beyond this, the researcher expects the price to continue to rise.\n\nThis is not the first time that Kendrick has released a bullish prediction for cryptocurrencies. He previously said he expects the price of Bitcoin to reach $120,000 and the entire crypto market to rise as well. However, it seems the researcher is much more bullish on ETH.\n\nNot everyone has provided bullish forecasts for ETH though. One crypto analyst actually believes that the digital asset is set for more decline. In the analyst, FieryTrading suggests that Ethereum\u2019s price could fall as low as $900.\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Ethereum price has crashed hard in the past few weeks as concerns about the crypto industry continued. ETH crashed to a low of $1,562, the lowest level since September 12th this year. It has dropped by more than 26% from the highest level this year.\n\nEthereum price received a key upgrade by analysts at Standard Chartered, who have been quite bullish on the industry recently. A few months ago, the analysts predicted that Bitcoin surged to $150,000.\n\nAnd in a report this week, an analyst in the bank said that ETH could jump from the current $1,562 to $8,000 in 2026. If this happens, the coin\u2019s market cap will jump from the current $157 billion to over $960 billion.\n\nThe analysts cited the growing use case of Ethereum\u2019s network and the upcoming Bitcoin halving as a catalyst. Also, it noted that the growing industries like gaming and tokenization will continue. Writing about this, the analyst noted:\n\n\"Importantly, this should provide \u2018proof of concept\u2019 examples in which real-world industries come on-chain to exploit the benefits of Ethereum over their existing setups. We expect significant developments on these fronts by 2025-26.\"\n\nTokenization has become a leading industry this year. Just on Wednesday, JPMorgan made a big milestone when it conducted a major tokenized transaction between Blackrock and Barclays.\n\nAnother potential catalyst for Ethereum price will be the approval of an Ethereum ETF. VanEck has already applied for this fund. Therefore, if the SEC approves a spot Bitcoin ETF, there is a likelihood that it will accept an Ethereum ETF.\n\nStill, there are risks to Ethereum. For one, the transition from a proof-of-work (PoW) to a proof-of-stake (PoS) could have some regulatory challenges. There are also concerns about the network\u2019s centralization and the fact that Ethereum Foundation has been selling the coins. It sold 1,700 ETH coins this week."

        "content": "For the first time since April\u2019s major Shapella upgrade, Ethereum\u2019s backlog of new validators awaiting activation has nearly emptied.\n\nThe queue\u2019s remarkable shrinkage signals a slowdown in demand to stake Ether after initial pent-up fervour was unleashed.\n\nEthereum transitioned to a proof-of-stake consensus model in September\u2019s Merge upgrade. Validators must stake Ether to help secure the network in exchange for rewards.\n\nHowever, strict limits on new validator entries created a long waitlist following the upgrade.\n\nThe queue ballooned to 45 days in June amid excitement over the newly withdrawable staked Ether. But as of Thursday, the expected wait dropped below 5 hours as the blockchain\u2019s staking mania cooled.\n\nValidator numbers have grown exceptionally since the merger, which also enabled staked ether withdrawals for the first time. Removing this lockup risk unleashed a wave of ether inflows.\n\nHowever, staking rewards have since fallen to around 3.5% due to declining network fees. Meanwhile, low-risk US Treasury yields now exceed 5% as the Federal Reserve hikes rates. This makes staking\u2019s yield less appealing.\n\nEthereum\u2019s staking ratio has risen to 22% from just 6.5% before the merger. But it still lags behind proof-of-stake chains like Solana, Cardano and Avalanche. Their staking ratios range from 53% to 69%.\n\nIndustry analysts say the emptying activation queue implies slowing growth in Ethereum\u2019s staked Ether supply.\n\nThe network\u2019s breakneck pace of new validators has evidently moderated as yields drop and investors evaluate options.\n\nFor now, the blockchain\u2019s once-packed waitlist for securing its future has nearly vanished entirely. The fading mania signals Ethereum\u2019s success at opening access to stakes rather than any loss of long-term enthusiasm."
