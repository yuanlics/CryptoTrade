        "title": "Run Ethereum nodes on AWS - AWS Blog",
        "content": "Amazon Managed Blockchain and many partners of AWS offer a convenient way to use Ethereum nodes without operating your own infrastructure. But sometimes, when you want to run archive nodes or participate in Ethereum staking, the managed nodes aren\u2019t enough, and you may choose to run your own Ethereum nodes on AWS.\n\nTo run a self-managed node, you need to configure server-side software components called Ethereum clients. After The Merge, each Ethereum node needs to run two clients: the execution layer (EL) client and the consensus layer (CL) client. These clients work in tandem to synchronize the global state with other nodes of the distributed Ethereum database clusters (usually called blockchain networks) such as mainnet, goerli, and sepolia. When you first install and configure both clients, they won\u2019t contain any data and need to catch up with the current state of the blockchain network managed by the rest of the nodes. This process is called the initial sync, and can take multiple days due to the volume of data that needs to be synchronized.\n\nIn this post, we share our experience with setting up Ethereum nodes on AWS and the ways to speed up the initial sync to quickly bring up new ones when needed.\n\nSpeeding up the initial sync\n\nWhen you start both clients on your new node for Ethereum mainnet, you need to wait for the CL client to get from the genesis block to The Merge transaction before the EL client can start syncing the blocks. Until then, the EL client either idles or downloads only receipts and block headers. This is time consuming and, in our tests, it could take around 4 days for a CL client like Prysm to sync from the genesis block.\n\nTo speed up the process, most CL clients provide checkpoint sync option that makes them only sync from the latest beacon chain checkpoint. The beacon chain introduced the consensus engine (or consensus layer) that replaces proof-of-work mining with proof-of-stake validation. When configuring a checkpoint sync, you have to provide a URL to your trusted checkpoint sync provider. The Ethereum community maintains a list of public endpoints of checkpoint sync providers to choose from. For more information about checkpoint sync, check How To: Checkpoint Sync.\n\nWhen you use checkpoint sync, the CL client syncs the state of the Ethereum beacon chain from the latest checkpoint (which is a block in the first slot of an epoch) and will be fully operational CL client even without syncing all the previous blocks. The process usually completes within minutes, and then the CL client instructs the paired EL client to start synchronizing the blocks for the EL blockchain. CL clients synced from checkpoint are good enough for validators and to kick-start the EL clients, but the CL clients synced from the genesis block also allow to query chain history and state for archive nodes. If you want to use checkpoint sync but need those functions for additional analytics purposes, you can to use a CL client like Lighthouse that support backfill sync of the previous blocks all the way to the genesis and then, optionally, can reconstruct the state as well.\n\nYou can configure EL clients such as Go Ethereum (Geth), Hyperledger Besu, and Nethermind as full nodes to consume less disk space and keep the pruned state only for the most recent 128 blocks. Some EL clients in full node mode also support a quicker sync option called snap sync. It\u2019s about 10 times faster than syncing the state from the Genesis block with full sync. Another node type is archive node, which, in addition to all blocks, builds an archive of historical states to provide richer functionality for historical queries. On the downside, the EL clients configured as archive nodes can\u2019t benefit from snap sync mode and it still takes 5-7 days to sync them. To learn more about node types and sync modes, see Nodes and Clients.\n\nFrom our experience, by using a combination of the checkpoint sync option in the CL client and the snap sync option in EL client, you should be able to shorten the initial sync time for from the initial 5-7 days to about 1 day for full nodes. If you need the richer functionality of the EL client as archive node, you should still use the checkpoint sync option in your CL client to save yourself multiple days of syncing time.\n\nAfter you synchronize your first node, you can use the AWS Cloud to scale those nodes horizontally. For better performance we recommend using a separate Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume to store blockchain data and, when the initial sync is complete, copy that data to Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) bucket. Later, when you bring new nodes online, you can copy blockchain data from S3 bucket and speed up the initial sync time for new nodes to less than an hour. In some situations, though, even the initial sync from the recent data copy can take longer because your node may occasionally get stuck with syncing the delta from a peer node with constrained resources like the network speed or an overloaded CPU. In cases like this, you need to monitor your node for slow sync and restart to force it to connect to other peer nodes.\n\nIt is also possible to use Amazon EBS Snapshots feature instead of copying data to and from S3, but the nodes initialized that way will experience higher I/O latencies for longer periods of time while their EBS snapshots are loaded from S3. In our experiments copying data from S3 with s5cmd tool takes about 36 minutes per 1 TiB while for EBS initialization without Amazon EBS fast snapshot restore feature it might take many hours.\n\nThe approach with keeping your own copy of your client\u2019s blockchain data on AWS works even better for EL clients like Erigon which is operating as archive node and don\u2019t have the snap sync option. It will take several days for such clients to download all necessary data and construct the final state, but after the copy is available, it will take 2 to 3 hours to get the new node up and running.\n\nSolution overview\n\nTo implement the ideas discussed earlier, we set up three instances of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) and use the cost-effective AWS Graviton processor with all clients. Each node has two EBS volumes attached to it: one as the root volume and another to keep the blockchain state data. We\u2019ll call one node a \u201csync node\u201d and dedicate it to synchronizing with the rest of the Ethereum mainnet. The other two nodes are \u201cRPC nodes\u201d, and they provide the RPC API to the user applications (also called decentralized apps or dApps for short). Although functionally the nodes are the same, separating node deployments by roles helps to improve scalability and reliability of the solution.\n\nThe RPC nodes are part of the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling Group (ASG) to quickly provision them from the copy of the sync node\u2019s data. Both of our RPC nodes are behind the Application Load Balancer to manage the load between them. You may also use different Amazon EC2 instance types for the sync node and RPC nodes to achieve better balance between cost and performance. A sync node can be of a smaller instance type, because its sole purpose is to catch up with the chain head. For example, we used AWS Compute Optimizer to assist us in finding the right sizing for the sync node, and found that the r6g.2xlarge EC2 instance type attached by an EBS GP3 volume with 5,700 of provisioned IOPS and 250 Mbps of provisioned throughput is sufficient for a Go Ethereum client with LevelDB as a sync node, but other instance types might work better for other clients. The RPC nodes might require higher specifications for both EC2 instances and EBS volumes and will depend on how often and which APIs are triggered by applications. After initializing from the data copy produced by the sync node, the RPC nodes will keep synchronizing with other nodes in the Ethereum network to serve up-to-date information through their APIs. At the same time, they can be disposed of and replaced by a new instance of an RPC node to scale up, replace faulty nodes, or upgrade client software.\n\nThe following diagram illustrates the deployment architecture.\n\nThe workflow steps are as follows:\n\nAn ongoing data synchronization process is configured with nodes in the Ethereum network with sync node and RPC nodes. The sync node is periodically producing updates to the copy of node\u2019s state data in S3 bucket with s5cmd tool. The key parameters of the blocks syncing progress are sent 5 minutes on automatically created Amazon CloudWatch dashboard for monitoring. When a new RPC node is provisioned, it copies the state data from S3 bucket to speed up the initial sync process. It stays in Pending:Wait state of the Auto Scaling Lifecycle during the data copying process and automatically registers with the Application Load Balancer when ready. Applications and smart contract development tools can now access highly available RPC nodes behind the Application Load Balancer with restricted access.\n\nIf you don\u2019t expect to service a lot of user requests to your nodes, you may instead create only one RPC node in the Auto Scaling group and run your sync node in another Availability Zone as a backup for redundancy.\n\nIn the discussions above we use a popular client combination, Go Ethereum execution client and Lighthouse consensus client, but the same setup can be used with other clients too. With the sample AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) application in the accompanying GitHub repository you can set up multiple other client combinations. And feel free to share your own configurations with pull requests.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn this post, we discussed Ethereum nodes and clients, the initial sync process used by Ethereum nodes, and how to speed it up using checkpoint sync consensus layer clients and snap sync in some execution layer clients. Then we dived deeper into how to use cloud infrastructure to speed up scaling of Ethereum node instances and shorten the initial sync time even further using a copy of the data in S3. Finally, we discussed the step-by-step process of how the solution works. Now you are ready to try out the sample CDK application and deploy the nodes yourself.\n\nAbout the Authors\n\nNikolay Vlasov is a Senior Solutions Architect with the AWS Worldwide Specialist Solutions Architect organization, focused on blockchain-related workloads.

        "content": "JPMorgan analysts warned of the risks of restaking in a recent note.\n\nThe new feature allows users to double-stake their Ether on different protocols.\n\nEthereum\u2019s blockchain is constantly evolving and one of its latest features poses a stability risk, according to analysts at JPMorgan.\n\nPrevious upgrades, The Merge and Shanghai, led to an \u201coverall increase in staking activity on the Ethereum network,\u201d analysts at investment bank JPMorgan said in a note on Thursday. One of the major contributors to this increase in staking was the advent of liquid staking providers.\n\nThese protocols \u201cmade staking accessible to common investors by overcoming barriers such as the high staking requirement of 32 Ether, technical complexities and the illiquidity of the staked Ether,\u201d JPMorgan said.\n\nLiquid staking gives investors access to their staked funds, which would otherwise be locked, in the form of liquidity tokens, like Lido\u2019s stETH. These tokens can also be used for restaking on DeFi platforms.\n\nStay ahead of the game with our weekly newsletters Subscribe\n\nInvestors typically use liquid staking tokens for lending, borrowing, and yield farming, according to JPMorgan. This generates more yield \u2014 which is highly desirable since yields on Ethereum have fallen from earlier this year.\n\nIn search of yield\n\nStandard staking yields on Ethereum, excluding fees and other rewards, have declined to 3.5% from over 4.3% before the Shanghai upgrade in April.\n\nAdditional rewards, which include fees and maximal extractible value, appear to have declined due to lower activity on the Ethereum network, JPMorgan said, down from 3% in April to 2% more recently.\n\n\u201cAs a result, the total staking yield has declined from 7.3% before the Shanghai upgrade to around 5.5% currently,\u201d JPMorgan concluded.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nWith Ethereum yields falling against the backdrop of rising yields in traditional finance, liquid staking offers an exciting prospect, namely through restaking.\n\nRestaking is a blockchain feature that allows users to double-stake their Ether on different protocols, or even chains. It went live on Ethereum in June, through US-based firm EigenLayer, which raised $50 million in a Series A round in March.\n\nThe new feature poses a valuable opportunity for investors. It\u2019s not risk-free, though, as JP Morgan and others have pointed out.\n\nRestaking could result in a \u201ccascade of liquidations if a staked asset drops sharply in value,\u201d JPMorgan said, or if that staked asset is \u201chacked or slashed due to a malicious attack or a protocol error.\u201d\n\nIn May, Ethereum\u2019s co-founder Vitalik Buterin raised concerns about \u201coverloading\u201d the network with complex and poorly-designed restaking models, and now analysts have shared their own warning.\n\n\u201cLike AI, restaking has the potential to unlock awesome services and reshape the ecosystem. Also like AI, restaking likely introduces systemic risks that are hard yet essential to tackle,\u201d Justin Drake, a researcher at Ethereum Foundation, told DL News in May.\n\nEigenLayer\u2019s founder Sreeram Kannan told DL News that he \u201cfully agrees\u201d with Drake\u2019s point and said he\u2019s \u201cglad Vitalik is urging caution in restaking protocols so that the low-risk use cases are cultivated without going over to the high-risk ones.\u201d\n\nFor now, EigenLayer is the only option for investors that want to restake their funds. The total value locked \u2014 a metric that tracks how much crypto is locked up in a DeFi protocol\u2019s smart contracts \u2014 on EigenLayer is around $226 million, according to DeFiLlama data.\n\nAdam Morgan McCarthy is DL News\u2019 London-based Markets Correspondent.

        "title": "JPMorgan Pins Ethereum's Centralization Issues on Lido as the 'Single Point of Failure' - CCN.com",
        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nAccording to JPMorgan, the recent growth in ETH staking has led to higher centralization.\n\nLido is considered a better alternative to centralized staking platforms, but concerns about its centralization persist.\n\nCentralization risks in Ethereum, including concentrated liquidity providers, could threaten the network\u2019s integrity.\n\nThe Merge upgrade was a significant step forward for the Ethereum network. This update occurred in mid-September 2022, signifying the network\u2019s transfer from the Proof of Work consensus process to the Proof of Stake consensus mechanism.\n\nSince then, the ship has been sailing smoothly, and its energy usage has fallen by 99%. However, according to JPMorgan analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, the network has become more centralized since the overhaul.\n\n\u201cThe rise in Ethereum staking since the Merge and Shanghai upgrades has come at a cost as the Ethereum network became more centralized and the overall staking yield declined,\u201d the report said.\n\nAccording to JPMorgan, the primary contributors to staking growth are liquid staking providers. The company says the top five liquid staking providers control more than half of the staking on the Ethereum network. In reality, Lido accounts for over one-third of the total.\n\nThe ETH \u2018Yield\u2019 Appeal Has Been Ruined\n\nMany members of the crypto community believe that Lido, a decentralized liquid staking platform, is a better alternative to the centralized liquid staking platform.\n\nAnalysts, on the other hand, claimed that Lido and other such decentralized solutions \u201cinvolve a high degree of centralization.\u201d Nonetheless, Lido has been adding additional node operators to solve this specific difficulty.\n\nJPMorgan asserted that centralization by any entity or protocol poses risks to the Ethereum network because a concentrated group of liquidity providers or node operators could act as a single point of failure, be attacked, or collaborate to form an oligopoly that would advance their interests at the expense of the community\u2019s interests. For example, a controlling entity could censor specific transactions or front-run end users\u2019 transactions.\n\nAnother risk associated with the emergence of liquid staking, according to JPMorgan, is rehypothecation. This entails using liquidity tokens as collateral across multiple DeFi protocols simultaneously.\n\n\u201cRehypothecation could then result in a cascade of liquidations if a staked asset drops sharply in value or is hacked or slashed due to malicious attack or a protocol error,\u201d the company said .\n\nFurthermore, the increase in staking has harmed ETH\u2019s appeal from a \u201cyield perspective.\u201d The total staking yield has fallen from 7.3% before Shanghai to 5.5% now. The paper emphasized that the outlook is more grim in the face of rising yields on traditional financial assets.\n\nChallenging Centralization in Ethereum Staking\n\nIn the world of Ethereum staking, there are different approaches. The simplest is \u201chome staking,\u201d where you manage assets using a small, energy-efficient PC with Ethereum software. However, some people prefer not to do this for various reasons.\n\nOne group lacks the technical skills or time to set up the required PC, while another group seeks higher returns and is willing to take more risks than the 3% to 6% dividend from staking. These two groups entrust their staking tokens to a third party to manage on their behalf. They provide a service and take a portion of the rewards in return.\n\nThird-party staking providers have pros and cons. They make staking more accessible but also introduce issues, acting like middlemen, which goes against the decentralized nature of crypto.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Shanghai hard fork allowed long-term stakers to withdraw, causing a rush into staking. Many people are joining, but few are leaving, which can risk network stability and centralization. This has led to a negative perception of third-party providers, with Lido being a prominent one.\n\nLido\u2019s actions pose a risk to Ethereum\u2019s core principle of decentralization. To address this issue, Ethereum researchers need more time to find solutions. They are working with top tech experts to tackle the centralization challenge and develop ways to mitigate it."

But what does this mean for Ethereum holders?\n\nShould you stake your Ethereum and earn staking rewards?\n\nThis comprehensive guide will explore the ins and outs of staking Ethereum, its benefits, risks, and various staking options.\n\nAlso read: Cloud and Crypto-Based Gaming: The End for Xbox and PlayStation?\n\nSource: CNBC\n\nUnderstanding Proof-of-Stake (PoS) and Proof-of-Work (PoW)\n\nScalability Improvement\n\nUnder the previous Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism, Ethereum had a limited transaction processing capacity of 15 transactions per second (TPS).\n\nThis pales compared to traditional financial payment services like Visa and MasterCard, which handle thousands of transactions per second.\n\nThe transition to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) will significantly improve Ethereum\u2019s scalability, enabling it to process up to 100,000 TPS.\n\nThis increased capacity opens the doors to a broader range of projects and applications on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nAlso read: Crypto-Friendly Banks in Europe?\n\nEnergy Efficiency Enhancement\n\nAnother significant advantage of PoS over PoW is its energy efficiency. The Ethereum Foundation estimates that the Ethereum blockchain will consume approximately 99.9% less energy under the PoS mechanism.\n\nThis improvement is a crucial step towards addressing the environmental concerns associated with blockchain technology.\n\nAdditionally, there is a growing trend towards using renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind, for mining (PoW) and staking (PoS), further reducing the carbon footprint of the Ethereum network.\n\nWhat Does It Mean to Stake Ethereum?\n\nStaking Ethereum on a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain involves actively participating in the validation of transactions.\n\nUnlike the mining process in Proof-of-Work (PoW), where miners compete based on computational power, PoS randomly selects validators based on the amount and duration of their staked Ether.\n\nValidators are responsible for creating new blocks and validating transactions, ensuring the integrity and security of the network. In return for their participation, validators receive staking rewards in proportion to their stake.\n\nPros and cons of staking Ethereum\n\nSource: MARCA\n\nPros\n\nPassive Investment\n\nStaking Ethereum offers a passive investment opportunity. Once you stake your Ether, there is no additional effort required on your part.\n\nYou can sit back and earn staking rewards, currently averaging an annual percentage rate (APR) of around 4%.\n\nFor example, with a minimum requirement of 32 ETH, you could earn approximately 1.3 ETH per year (based on the current price of one ETH being around $1,320).\n\nSense of Community\n\nIf you are passionate about Ethereum and believe in its value, staking allows you to actively contribute to the network\u2019s health and security.\n\nBy validating transactions and participating in the consensus mechanism, you become an integral part of the Ethereum community.\n\nStaking can be a rewarding experience for those who want to support the network while earning a reasonable payout.\n\nComparatively Low Risk\n\nCompared to other cryptocurrencies, Ethereum is a relatively stable staking option. Its popularity, global use, and established security protocols give it an advantage over many other tokens in the market.\n\nWhile the crypto market may experience fluctuations, Ethereum has shown resilience and potential for long-term growth.\n\nStaking Ethereum allows you to earn rewards without exposing yourself to excessive risk.\n\nCons\n\nWithdrawal Restriction\n\nCurrently, staked Ethereum cannot be withdrawn until the release of Ethereum 2.0, which is expected to take 12 to 18 months, assuming no further delays.\n\nIf you have liquidity constraints or anticipate needing immediate access to your funds, staking may not be a suitable option for you.\n\nHowever, some centralized crypto exchanges offer staking options with more flexibility.\n\nFees\n\nStaking Ethereum may involve certain fees, depending on your chosen staking method. Centralized crypto exchanges and other staking services may charge fees for their services.\n\nThese fees can vary, so it\u2019s essential to consider the trade-off between liquidity costs and staking fees when selecting a staking option.\n\nValidator Penalties\n\nWhile rare, validators can face penalties for being offline or validating incorrect transactions. Non-compliance with the network\u2019s rules can result in a reduction or complete loss of staked Ether.\n\nValidators must consistently fulfill their responsibilities to avoid penalties that may affect their returns.\n\nCustodial Staking Risks\n\nWhen staking with a crypto exchange or a staking service, your Ethereum is held in a custodial wallet managed by the platform.\n\nWhile this offers convenience, it also exposes your staked Ether to certain risks, such as hacking, counterparty failure, or government actions.\n\nIt\u2019s crucial to carefully evaluate the security measures and reputation of the platform before staking your Ethereum.\n\nHow to Stake Ethereum: Options and Considerations\n\nSource: Reuters\n\nSeveral options are available for staking Ethereum, each with its own set of considerations. Let\u2019s explore the different staking methods and their associated benefits and risks.\n\nRunning a validator\n\nRunning a validator allows you to earn the highest rewards but requires a significant investment.\n\nIn most cases, you must stake a minimum of 32 ETH, which can amount to a substantial capital outlay.\n\nAdditionally, running a validator involves technical requirements, such as storing data and processing transactions on the blockchain.\n\nYou\u2019ll need reliable hardware and a stable internet connection. While running a validator can be rewarding, it\u2019s essential to assess the costs and technical challenges involved carefully.\n\nValidator Pools\n\nValidator pools offer an alternative to running a solo validator. In a validator pool, multiple participants pool their ETH to reach the minimum requirement of 32 ETH needed to run a validator.\n\nThis pooling of resources allows individuals with smaller amounts of ETH to participate in staking while enjoying many of the benefits of running a validator.\n\nValidator pools offer a lower barrier to entry. They can be a good option for those who want to stake their ETH without the significant financial commitment and technical requirements of running a solo validator.\n\nExchanges\n\nMany reputable crypto exchanges now offer staking services for Ethereum. Staking your ETH through an exchange offers convenience and accessibility.\n\nMost exchanges have low or no minimum staking requirements, making it possible for anyone with any capital to participate. After purchasing Ethereum, you can immediately start staking.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s important to consider the security measures and fees imposed by the exchange.\n\nCustodial staking carries risks, such as platform hacks or unexpected regulatory actions. Conduct thorough research and choose a reputable exchange with robust security measures.\n\nLiquid Staking\n\nOne of the downsides of staking Ethereum is the inability to withdraw your staked ETH until Ethereum 2.0 is fully implemented.\n\nLiquid staking aims to address this limitation by offering tokens that represent your staked ETH and can be freely traded or used for other purposes.\n\nLiquid staking services Swap your ETH for a receipt token, such as stETH, which can be stored in a private crypto wallet. These receipt tokens maintain the staked ETH\u2019s value while allowing you to utilize them for trading or other transactions.\n\nLiquid staking provides a solution for those who seek more flexibility and liquidity while still earning staking rewards.\n\nConclusion: Is staking Ethereum worth it?\n\nThe decision to stake your Ethereum ultimately depends on your investment goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Staking Ethereum offers the potential for passive income and allows you to actively contribute to the Ethereum network.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s important to consider the risks involved, such as withdrawal restrictions, fees, and custodial-taking risks. Conduct thorough research, evaluate your financial situation, and consult with a financial advisor if necessary.\n\nWhile staking Ethereum can be a rewarding experience, it\u2019s essential to approach it with a long-term perspective.\n\nThe crypto market is highly volatile, and short-term price fluctuations should not deter you from the potential benefits of staking.\n\nDetermine your investment objectives, assess the available staking options, and make an informed decision based on your circumstances.\n\nRemember, staking Ethereum involves locking up your ETH for a specified period, so it\u2019s crucial to consider your liquidity needs and investment horizon.\n\nWith proper research and careful consideration, staking Ethereum can be a valuable addition to your investment strategy.\n\nDisclaimer: The views and opinions expressed in this article are for informational purposes only and do not constitute financial advice.

        "content": "The rise of Ethereum staking since major network upgrades, the Merge and Shanghai, has come at the cost of higher centralization and lower staking yields, a new report by JPMorgan said.\n\nJPMorgan analysts, led by senior managing director Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, issued a new investor note on Oct. 5, warning about the risks stemming from Ethereum\u2019s growing centralization.\n\nMarket share of top five liquid staking providers. Source: JPMorgan\n\nThe top five liquid staking providers: Lido, Coinbase, Figment, Binance and Kraken, control over 50% of staking on the Ethereum network, JPMorgan analysts noted in the report, adding that Lido alone accounts for almost one-third.\n\nThe analysts mentioned that the crypto community has seen the decentralized liquid staking platform Lido as a better alternative to centralized staking platforms associated with centralized exchanges like Coinbase or Binance. However, in practice, \u201ceven decentralized liquid staking platforms involve a high degree of centralization,\u201d JPMorgan\u2019s report said, adding that a single Lido node operator accounts for more than 7,000 validator sets or 230,000 Ether (ETH).\n\nThese node operators get selected by Lido\u2019s decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), which is controlled by a few wallet addresses, \u201cmaking Lido\u2019s platform rather centralized in its decision making,\u201d the analysts wrote. The report mentioned a case when Lido\u2019s DAO rejected a proposal to cap the staking share at 22% of Ethereum\u2019s overall staking to avoid centralization.\n\n\u201cLido didn\u2019t participate in the initiatives as its DAO rejected the proposal by an overwhelming majority of 99%,\u201d JPMorgan analysts wrote, adding:\n\n\u201cNeedless to say that centralization by any entity or protocol creates risks to the Ethereum network as a concentrated number of liquidity providers or node operators could act as a single point of failure or become targets for attacks or collude to create an oligopoly [...]\u201d\n\nApart from higher centralization, post-Merge Ethereum is also associated with an overall staking yield decline, JPMorgan noted. The standard block rewards declined from 4.3% before the Shanghai upgrade to 3.5% currently, the analysts wrote. The total staking yield has declined from 7.3% before the Shanghai upgrade to around 5.5% currently, the report added.\n\nRelated: Time to \u2018pull the brakes\u2019 on Ethereum and rotate back to Bitcoin: K33 report\n\nJPMorgan analysts aren\u2019t the only Ethereum observers who have noticed a significant increase in network centralization following the Merge upgrade. Executed on Sept. 15, 2022, the Merge has been seen as a major impediment to Ethereum\u2019s decentralization and a major reason for dropping yields.\n\nyou are the yield pic.twitter.com/ONJT6QmDch \u2014 Pledditor (@Pledditor) October 5, 2023\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has admitted that node centralization is one of Ethereum\u2019s main challenges.

        "title": "How Have Ethereum Futures ETFs Fared So Far? Data Reveals Shocking Numbers - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Apart from Spot Bitcoin ETFs, Ethereum Futures ETFs have been the talk of the crypto industry for months as investors look toward a catalyst for the next bull run. However, data has shown the highly anticipated ETFs have had underwhelming results in trading volume.\n\nAlthough the crypto market has witnessed some gains in the past few days, this hasn\u2019t flowed into Ethereum Futures ETFs as investors seem hesitant to adopt these new Ethereum investment vehicles.\n\nHow Have Ethereum Futures ETFs Fared So Far?\n\nEthereum futures ETFs provide indirect exposure to the price of ETH through futures contracts and Nine Ethereum Futures ETFs were introduced to the market on Monday, October 2nd. These include ETFs by ProShares, VanEck, Bitwise, and other financial firms following a year of anticipation.\n\nAs the second biggest cryptocurrency by market cap, many expected the ETFs to take off quickly and piggyback on the early success of Bitcoin Futures ETFs. However, data shows the trading volume for these new products has remained relatively low so far.\n\nAccording to a report by Bloomberg, these nine futures ETFs attracted $1.92 million in the 24 hours after launch. Most of this trading occurred in the ProShares Ether Strategy ETF which contributed over 45% of trading volume.\n\nPretty meh volume for the Ether Futures ETFs as a group, a little under $2m, about normal for a new ETF but vs $BITO (which did $200m in first 15min) it is low. Tight race bt VanEck and ProShares in the single eth lane. pic.twitter.com/F9AHtrVcVf \u2014 Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) October 2, 2023\n\nAccording to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence, trading volume reached $15.6 million on Wednesday. At the moment, the inflows are being led by the VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF (EFUT), which has $8.27 million, followed by the ProShares Ether Strategy ETF (EETH), which has $5.96 million.\n\nEther futures ETFs starting see some flows, not a ton, but it\u2019s something, +$15.6m with VanEck in an early lead over ProShares.. pic.twitter.com/e0bu7T0ZLT \u2014 Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) October 4, 2023\n\nIn comparison, Bitcoin Futures ETFs registered $1 billion in trading volume within the first 24 hours after launch. But it\u2019s important to note that the market sentiment during these two periods wasn\u2019t the same. Bitcoin futures ETFs were launched during the peak of the 2021 crypto bull market, and cryptocurrencies have had major pullbacks since then.\n\nFuture Outlook Of ETH\n\nWhile Ethereum futures ETFs provide a new way to gain exposure to Ethereum, low trading volume shows they have yet to gain major mainstream interest. These ETFs were supposed to be a sustained catalyst for the price of Ethereum, but this has not been the case.\n\nEthereum Spot ETFs have also been in the talks, with ARK Invest filing the first application in early September. If granted approval, spot ETFs are more likely to have a better performance than futures ETFs.\n\nDespite Ethereum pushing over $1,700 on Monday after the launch of the futures ETFs, it has since lost all those gains. At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $1,630.\n\nETH price suffers as ETF volumes disappoint | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nFeatured image from Crypto News, chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Ethereum price is struggling to stay above the $1,620 support against the US dollar. ETH must clear the $1,665 hurdle to start a fresh increase.\n\nEthereum trimmed all gains and now trading near the $1,630 level.\n\nThe price is trading below $1,660 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance near $1,650 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair could start a fresh increase if it clears the $1,650 and $1,665 resistance levels.\n\nEthereum Price Holds Support\n\nEthereum managed to recover and stay above the $1,620 pivot level. Yesterday, we discussed a bearish reaction in ETH below the $1,650 level, like Bitcoin.\n\nA swing low was formed near $1,585 before the price recovered above $1,620. It is now consolidating above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1,742 swing high to the $1,585 low. It seems like the bears are active below the $1,650 level.\n\nEthereum is now trading below $1,660 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $1,650 level. There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance near $1,650 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.\n\nThe next major resistance is $1,665 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.

In the stated case, the price could visit the $1,700 resistance. The next key resistance might be $1,720. Any more gains might open the doors for a move toward $1,750.\n\nAnother Drop in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $1,665 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,630 level. The next key support is $1,620.\n\nThe first major support is now near $1,585. A downside break below the $1,585 support might start another strong bearish wave. In the stated case, the price could even visit the $1,540 level. In the stated case, there is a risk of a drop toward the $1,500 level.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bearish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $1,620\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $1,665\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

Six entities and their digital wallet addresses have now been flagged by the government, including five individuals and one company\u2014Valerian Labs.\n\n\u201cThe addresses identified by OFAC as part of this action collectively received just under $3.8 million worth of cryptocurrency, representing huge quantities of drugs potentially trafficked into the United States and other countries,\u201d wrote blockchain surveillance firm Chainalysis in a blog post on the matter.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA total of 17 wallet addresses were identified in OFAC\u2019s action, spanning networks including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Tron.

        "title": "Ethereum Network 'Remains the Place to Operate as a Criminal,' Immunefi CEO Says - CoinDesk",
        "content": "A new report found that more than a billion dollars was lost in crypto this year and more than 600 million lost last quarter. Joining us now to unpack the findings is immun five, founder and Ceo Mitchell Amador. Welcome to the show. Mitchell. Thank you very much. Great to be here. Great to have you. Well, immun Phi has put together this report for Q three, unpacking some pretty large losses. Talk to us about what's driving these big numbers over $600 million lost in Q three. Sure. Sure. So there are two major factors that are driving us the first one and arguably the more concerning is the significant increase in the total number of successful hacks. So this is more than a doubling from the previous quarter at 75 versus 30. The second major factor and making up about 50%. Almost 50% of all the losses over the last quarter were two specific hacks which were the Mixon and the multi chain events. And what you can see here just from that is that there's an extreme Power Law distribution in terms of the level of impact, in terms of the level of loss that occurs as a result of hacks. That is what's driving these losses as a whole. So is sorry, Laura, it's going to go crazy. Is hacking getting easier because more vulnerabilities are introduced into these ecosystems or are hackers getting more sophisticated? That's a difficult question because we have to know who these secret shadowy operators are and what exactly they're doing. Uh But I can tell you on the inside of the good guys, right, in the security industry and our work every day to protect the industry that things are getting much better. Our technology has improved leaps and bounds, the number of participants and the number of companies contributing effective technical solutions has improved. So I don't think it's the and, and I should say, you know, to the point of more vulnerabilities getting introduced the average security bar, the standard for work has improved very significantly, right? So, you know, your investors will not let you launch in YOLO contracts in the way that they might have during defi summer, for example. So I don't think it's more vulnerabilities of being introduced. I do suspect, although it's hard to know that is that our adversaries, if you will, the Attackers and the thieves that plague our industry have become more sophisticated, have increased with in number and have invested more in this as a potential uh channel for their own profits and revenue. Unfortunately, now as far as the scams go how uh how are you defining scams in, in this case? And have they changed in nature at all? I think, you know, here we did a very tight definition of scams because hackers is more of our particular interest in looking into the technical side of things. So uh the, the, the fraud definitions and only like really strongly confirmed cases where we know that to be the case when in fact, if, if you wanna, you, let's just say a be a little bit more liberal with the definitions, I imagine we'd see the numbers be quite a bit larger than our initial investigation. However, it does indicate the broader trend that overall kind of fraudulent activity seems to not be growing in the same way that hacks are. And uh this makes sense, although I suppose I should wait to see if that's of interest to you. Uh Yeah, I, I, you know, I guess, I guess my question is, are, are, are these, uh, you know, spam emails sent to grandma saying, you know, here's your chance to invest in, in Bitcoin and, or, or like, you know, I don't know, Steven Segal coin, whatever it is that that's going on here or is it more of, uh, you know what, uh I guess my question is, what's the nature of those kind of scams? Sure. The really obvious ones are naked rug pulls, right? And for all of our uh viewers who don't understand what that is a rug pull is when someone creates a project and then steals all the money by uh draining, you know, either the project funds or by selling all the tokens that they might have created in mass. Hence pulling out the rug from under everybody else at, at their expense. So that is the the kind of uh very poignant example. There are other types of fraud that are much harder to understand in terms of their scope such as pig butchering, which you might be familiar of or such as fishing and spear fishing or steam swapping that you might be familiar of. But as that activity is much more shadowy, it's, it's extremely difficult to get any read on the magnitude of it. Now, the report said that 70% of successful exploits took place in D I and then just under 30% in CP I, um my first question here on this stat is what chain saw the most losses. Oh, that would be the Ethereum Chain, unfortunately. All right. And why, why do you think that is? Well, I'm afraid the reason is not exciting. It's because all the money is on Ethereum. Ethereum remains the predominant solution for or, you know, just the center of DFI activity as a whole. It remains the place where you have the strongest. Um How do we say it uh Sovereignty assurances? So there's no chance that anybody's gonna be rolling back Ethereum or doing funny business. If you steal something there, you're in the clear. So, you know, for many that's also connected to a lot of the, the major privacy cha uh chains and major Privacy tech that's available if you want to launder your assets. So there's a lot of reasons why Ethereum remains the place to operate as a criminal. Unfortunately. Uh, it, it, now that we're seeing kind of a softness in volumes in crypto, do you think that we'll see a softness in volumes of scams and rug poles and all that stuff? It has, has the, the wind that's gone out of the sales of, of legitimate trading also gone out of the sales of, of uh theft. That's a, that's a complicated question. The answer is, it depends what you look at. Right. My sentiment based on our analysis is that it looks like the fraudulent activity is not growing in the same way. So, you know, crypto is less hot, there's less money in it, more and more of the people participating in the space are hardened. It's less of a juicy target for scammers, you know, and, and the kind of scammer industry tends to go where things are hot where the opportunity is. So you have that side of things and I think that's for the better. Sure. A I it also depends on what country it could be, any number of things. Uh Let's hope they remain far away for as long as possible. But I don't think they will. Now, the hack side is the opposite. Right. When you make an investment into being a advanced, persistent threat, right? A, a professional hacking group for some nation state or as a private business as there are many of those as well. When you make that investment, you can't easily repurpose it. But so after you hire a bunch of, you know, hacker types and set up your organization and start cracking on things you have to stay committed. Because if you don't, then your team falls apart and all your investment is lost. Consequently, the hacking side of things, we should not expect that to slow down in any shape, right? We should expect that to continue to increase. And I think that's what this last quarter is showing in terms of the very material increase in the frequency of successful hacking attempts. Mitchell, thanks so much for joining us this morning. It was a pleasure."

        "title": "Demystifying Ethereum Gas Fees: A Comprehensive Guide - Altcoin Buzz",
        "content": "As the popularity of Ethereum has grown, so has the prominence of Ethereum gas fees. These fees play a crucial role in the Ethereum ecosystem, affecting transaction speed and cost.\n\nIn this comprehensive guide, we will delve into what Ethereum gas fees are, and how they work. Also, the factors influencing their fluctuations, and provide a historical perspective by showcasing the all-time highs and lows of gas fees.\n\nUnderstanding Ethereum Gas Fees\n\nEthereum gas fees are the costs associated with executing transactions and smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. These fees serve multiple purposes within the network:\n\nIncentivizing Miners: Ethereum operates on a proof-of-work consensus mechanism, which relies on miners to validate and add transactions to the blockchain. Gas fees serve as incentives for miners to prioritize and process transactions promptly. Resource Allocation: Gas fees are a mechanism for allocating computational resources on the network. They ensure that users pay for the computational power and storage space their transactions consume. Spam Prevention: By attaching a cost to transactions, Ethereum prevents spam attacks and ensures that the network\u2019s resources are utilized efficiently.\n\n\u26fd GAS FEES: EXPLAINED Do you know what #Ethereum Gas fees are and why they exist? Learn more in this thread \ud83e\uddf5\ud83d\udc47 pic.twitter.com/hJIvdOFxIm \u2014 CoinPayments (@CoinPaymentsNET) April 26, 2023\n\nHow Ethereum Gas Fees Work\n\nEthereum gas fees are denominated in a unit called \u201cGas,\u201d which measures the computational work required to execute a transaction or contract. The total cost of a transaction is calculated by multiplying the Gas price (denominated in Ether) by the amount of Gas used. Here is the formula:\n\nTransaction Cost (in Ether) = Gas Price (in Ether per Gas) \u00d7 Gas Used\n\nGas Price: Users specify the Gas price they are willing to pay for their transactions. Miners tend to prioritize transactions with higher Gas prices since they offer more significant rewards. Therefore, users can influence the speed of their transactions by setting higher Gas prices.\n\nGas Used: This represents the total computational work required to process the transaction. More complex transactions or smart contracts consume more Gas.\n\nFactors Influencing Ethereum Gas Fees\n\nSeveral factors contribute to the fluctuation of Ethereum gas fees, making them variable over time:\n\nNetwork Congestion: High demand for Ethereum\u2019s services can lead to congestion on the network, causing an increase in Gas fees. During periods of heavy usage, such as ICOs or DeFi yield farming frenzies, Gas fees tend to surge. Gas Price Auction: Ethereum uses an auction system to determine which transactions get processed first. Users compete by setting higher Gas prices to have their transactions prioritized, especially when the network is congested. Smart Contract Complexity: The computational complexity of executing a smart contract directly impacts the Gas required and, consequently, the Gas fees. Complex smart contracts consume more Gas, leading to higher fees. Ethereum Upgrades: Ethereum has undergone several upgrades, such as Ethereum 2.0\u2019s transition to proof-of-stake. These upgrades aim to improve scalability and reduce fees, but their impact may not be immediately apparent. Market Speculation: Traders and investors sometimes speculate on Ethereum\u2019s Gas fees, leading to sudden and unpredictable price spikes.\n\nHistorical Perspective: All-Time Highs and Lows\n\nUnderstanding the historical evolution of Ethereum gas fees provides valuable insights into their volatility and growth. Here\u2019s a timeline of the all-time highs and lows:\n\nAll-Time High (February 23, 2021): During the height of the DeFi boom and NFT craze, Ethereum gas fees reached an astronomical level. The average Gas price surged to over 1,400 Gwei (Giga-wei), equivalent to approximately 0.04 Ether per transaction. This was a challenging period for regular Ethereum users as transaction costs became prohibitively expensive.\n\nAll-Time Low (Pre-2015): In the early days of Ethereum, Gas fees were almost negligible, as the network had relatively low usage. It was possible to send transactions with fees as low as a fraction of a cent in Ether. However, as Ethereum gained popularity and adoption, Gas fees began to increase.\n\nCurrent Gas Fee Trends (2023): Since the previous all-time high, Ethereum has undergone significant changes, including the ongoing transition to Ethereum 2.0. These changes are aimed at reducing Gas fees and improving scalability. The Gas fees in 2023 have, on average, become more manageable, but they still fluctuate depending on network demand and usage.\n\nEthereum network gas fees have fallen to their lowest since November 2022 amid a decline in on-network activity, Santiment data shows. The cost of transactions fell to $1.13. pic.twitter.com/EM3BEHnfMe \u2014 Meta Joker \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\udde6 (@MetaJoker777) October 5, 2023\n\nConclusion\n\nEthereum gas fees are an integral part of the Ethereum blockchain, serving as incentives for miners, resource allocation mechanisms, and safeguards against spam attacks. Understanding how Gas fees work and the factors influencing their fluctuations is essential for anyone using the Ethereum network.\n\nWhile Ethereum has experienced both extreme highs and lows in Gas fees, ongoing upgrades and the transition to Ethereum 2.0 hold promise for a more scalable and affordable ecosystem in the future. Keeping an eye on gas prices and network conditions is crucial for users looking to optimize their Ethereum transactions.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe information discussed by Altcoin Buzz is not financial advice.

        "content": "Disclaimer: The opinions expressed by our writers are their own and do not represent the views of U.Today. The financial and market information provided on U.Today is intended for informational purposes only. U.Today is not liable for any financial losses incurred while trading cryptocurrencies. Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEthereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, experienced a significant drop in price, briefly plummeting below the $1,600 mark. As of the latest data, Ethereum is trading at approximately $1,634.82, but the brief dip below $1,600 has raised concerns about the asset's short-term stability. This price action opens up the possibility of Ethereum reaching the $1,500 price threshold, a level that could be met sooner than expected given current market sentiment.\n\nThe recent failed launch of VanEck's Ether futures ETF further exacerbates the situation. The ETF generated a meager trading volume, indicating a lack of institutional interest in Ethereum at this time. This is a concerning sign for the cryptocurrency, as institutional demand often acts as a stabilizing force during market downturns.\n\nThe market's current sentiment is not helping Ethereum either. With Bitcoin struggling to maintain its price levels and the broader market showing signs of weakness, Ethereum's drop below $1,600 could be a precursor to further declines. The lack of institutional demand, as evidenced by the VanEck ETF's poor performance, adds another layer of concern.\n\nIt is crucial to note that Ethereum's price is highly volatile and subject to rapid changes. However, the brief dip below $1,600 serves as a warning sign for investors and traders alike. If Ethereum fails to find strong support soon, we could see it test the $1,500 level, which would be a significant psychological barrier for the asset.\n\nShiba Inu remains jailed\n\nShiba Inu (SHIB) has been struggling to break free from its downward trajectory, and recent data confirms that the meme asset is far from recovery. Currently trading at $0.0000072, SHIB has been below its trendline support, which has now turned into resistance, for the past three days. This essentially cements the notion that the asset has failed to regain its bullish momentum.\n\nThe lack of network activity and general buzz around Shiba Inu is a significant factor contributing to its stagnant performance. Unlike other cryptocurrencies that have robust communities and active development, SHIB seems to be lacking in both. This is particularly concerning given that the broader market has also lost much of its liquidity since Bitcoin's surge toward $30,000.\n\nMeme assets, in general, are showing poor performance, and Shiba Inu is no exception. The asset's inability to break through and sustain above its trendline support indicates a lack of buying interest and could potentially lead to further declines if the situation does not improve.\n\nWhat could help Shiba Inu at this point? For starters, an increase in network activity could signal renewed interest in the asset. Additionally, positive developments or partnerships could also serve as catalysts for a potential uptrend. However, as it stands, the meme coin has a long way to go before it can regain its former glory.\n\nDogecoin remains anemic\n\nDogecoin (DOGE), once the darling of the meme coin world, has been stuck in a rut for the last two months. The cryptocurrency is currently trading at $0.06099, showing a lack of volatility and liquidity that has left investors scratching their heads.\n\nOver the past 60 days, Dogecoin has failed to make any significant price movements, remaining stagnant while other meme coins like Shiba Inu and even PEPE have shown more action. This lack of volatility is a stark contrast to the frenzied trading activity that Dogecoin used to enjoy, especially during its meteoric rise earlier this year.\n\nThe poor performance of DOGE is even more glaring when compared to its competitors. Shiba Inu, for instance, has seen periods of high volatility and has even managed to steal some of Dogecoin's thunder. The lack of price movement on DOGE can be attributed to several factors, including the absence of significant updates or news surrounding the coin.\n\nOne of the most talked-about potential catalysts for Dogecoin is the implementation of smart contract technology, a topic that has been discussed for around a year now. Unfortunately, no progress has been made in this direction, leaving investors disappointed and contributing to the coin's stagnant price.\n\nAnother potential catalyst could be endorsements from high-profile figures like Elon Musk or implementation on platforms like X (formerly Twitter). However, these are speculative at best and cannot be relied upon for sustained growth."

        "title": "Ethereum Price Prediction: ETH Ready To Bounce Hard - CoinGape",
        "content": "Ethereum price jumped to $1,750 on Monday, a price level seen in mid-August. The largest smart contracts token was the focal point of the crypto market as the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) raced to approve Ether futures exchange-traded funds (ETFs). However, the uptrend encountered headwinds leading to a decline back to the $1,600 range.\n\nThe bearish grip on ETH has continued to intensify, with the token remaining relatively unchanged over the last 24 hours and trading at $1,645 on Friday. Bulls must rally behind Ethereum price to prevent another dip below $1,600.\n\nadvertisement\n\nWhy Q4 2023 Could Be Explosive For Ethereum Price\n\nThe crypto market tends to perform well in the last quarter of every year, except in 2022 due to the implosion of FTX exchange. Investors are already looking forward to a bullish October, which has come to be known as the \u201cUptober.\u201d\n\nAnalysts and traders like Altcoin Sherpa believe the fourth quarter of 2023 is the time for Ethereum and other altcoins to shine.\n\n\u201cI expect an extremely explosive Q4 or early Q1, as it always happens.\u201d Altcoin Sherpa said via X. \u201cThese are arguably the best times of the year to trade.\u201d\n\nReading from the ETHBTC price chart, the trader said that he expects Ethereum price to bounce back hard.\n\n$ETH: The time is coming soon to scale into altcoins. I expect an extremely explosive Q4 or early Q1, as it always happens. These are arguably the best times of the year to trade. Watch for .055 area and then I expect #Ethereum to bounce hard with ETHBTC pic.twitter.com/d0YxeYGELg \u2014 Altcoin Sherpa (@AltcoinSherpa) October 5, 2023\n\nSantiment, an on-chain analytics platform, revealed that exchange outflows amounting to 110k ETH were recorded on Wednesday \u2013 \u201cthe largest outflow since August 21.\u201d Non-exchange Ether subsequently spiked to an all-time high of 115.88 million ETH with the supply of the token on exchanges dwindling to a five-year low.\n\nThis shows that fundamentally, Ethereum is strong which suitably places it in a position to rally if given a chance.\n\n\ud83d\ude2e #Ethereum saw about ~110K $ETH ($181M) move off of exchanges Wednesday, the largest outflow day since August 21st. The amount of non-exchange Ethereum now sits at an #AllTimeHigh 115.88M $ETH, while its exchange supply is at its lowest in ~5.5 years. https://t.co/PUOWGt0KS0 pic.twitter.com/u54pp6LZij \u2014 Santiment (@santimentfeed) October 5, 2023\n\nEthereum Price In Search For Higher Support\n\nEthereum has since its rejection from $1,750 earlier in the week been involved in an endless search for support to control its downside. The 21-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) (red) serving as the immediate support at $1,641 must hold in place, otherwise, this search would extend to $1,600.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) upholds the downward trend as it retests support at the midline. Traders interested in shorting Ether must check that the RSI continues to drop toward the oversold area below 30.\n\nMeanwhile, bullish traders should consider the possibility of Ethereum price bouncing back from the support currently provided by the falling channel. A retest of the previous resistance is often interpreted as bullish.\n\nOn the upside, a break above resistance at $1,750 would mean that Ethereum is holding above all the key moving averages, including the 21-day EMA, the 100-day EMA, and the 200-day EMA. Such a position would go a long way to lock in the uptrend, thus encouraging traders to consider longing ETH for a larger breakout to $2,000.\n\nRelated Articles"

        "content": "XRP could be on the verge of surging by as much as 58x from its current value, according to crypto analyst EGRAG, who drew parallels with a past performance from Ethereum (ETH).\n\n#XRP 58X? Nahhhhhhhhhhhh, you're Delusional: Allow me to share some insight: In the previous cycle, #ETH achieved a 58X growth despite the controversies surrounding it.\n\n#XRP is poised to make a significant 58X leap, and this marks just the beginning. With legal clarity now in\u2026 pic.twitter.com/dlWAhlEjtK \u2014 EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) October 5, 2023\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nEthereum achieved a staggering 58x growth in the previous cycle despite its controversies and challenges. Now, EGRAG suggests that XRP is on a similar trajectory, with the added benefit of newfound legal clarity, making its potential even more compelling.\n\nThe analyst stressed that some XRP community members have begun mocking other XRP enthusiasts who believe in lofty price targets such as this. This reality showcases the diverse perspectives within the XRP community.\n\nEthereum Rapid Surge\n\nEGRAG presented a chart showing Ethereum\u2019s remarkable journey to support his claim. In January 2018, Ethereum experienced a significant correction, plummeting from its high of $1,420 to a mere $80.9 by December 2018.\n\nHowever, this marked the beginning of Ethereum\u2019s resurgence. According to the above chart, Ethereum\u2019s price surged by a jaw-dropping 5,815% (58X) from its low of $80.9, eventually reaching the impressive $4,700 price range in November 2021.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nXRP\u2019s Potential\n\nThe crypto analyst believes that XRP has the potential to replicate the impressive resurgence of ETH. Currently trading at $0.5215, XRP has already established itself as a prominent digital asset.\n\nIf it mirrors Ethereum\u2019s previous performance and undergoes a 58x rally from its current position, XRP could surge to an astonishing $30.2. This is nearly ten times its recent all-time high value.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that XRP also has a history of significant price surges. In January 2017, XRP was worth a mere $0.003, but it reached an all-time high value of $3.317 in just one year. This represented a 110,466% increase or a 1,104x surge.\n\nThese past achievements are undoubtedly impressive, but it\u2019s important to remember that past performances do not guarantee future results.\n\nWhile the crypto landscape has changed, and legal clarity has been achieved for XRP, the journey to a projected 58x rally may not be without its hurdles. Cryptocurrencies are mainly volatile, and investors should remain cautious."

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nEthereum futures ETF got off to a poor start, recording less than $3 million in trading volume on first-day trading.\n\nThe paltry figures starkly contrast with the impressive figures notched by Bitcoin futures back in 2021.\n\nNine ETF products were launched on the same day, with the SEC keen on preventing market domination.\n\nAfter months of building anticipation, the Ethereum (ETH) futures exchange-traded fund (ETF) recorded less than stellar results after the first day of trading.\n\nAfter months of regulatory horse-trading, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved nine ETFs to track futures contracts linked to ETH. However, initial enthusiasm waned after the combination of the nine ETFs failed to garner up to $3 million on the first day of trading.\n\n\u201cUnprecedented day today with multiple ETFs all launching at the same time,\u201d said Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas. \u201cNo clear winner has emerged, all of them were pretty average, lower than I would have predicted.\u201d\n\nDespite the lacklustre figures, optimism still runs high, with a cross-section believing that the ETFs could go on to record impressive figures in the coming weeks. Balchunas noted that it would take a while for investors to warm up to ETF tracking the futures contracts tied to ETH citing the preference of investors to hold physical products over derivatives.\n\nAmong the lot, Valkyrie\u2019s Bitcoin Strategy ETF recorded the most activity, with just over $800,000 in volume. Valkyrie\u2019s ETF, originally tracking BTC futures, tweaked its setup to include ETH as it leveraged its soaring popularity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFour out of the nine ETFs track only ETH futures, while the rest operate by tracking a mixture of the futures of two of the largest virtual currencies \u2013 BTC and ETH.\n\nApart from investors\u2019 preference for physical assets, pundits have warned that futures ETFs negatively affect spot markets as virtual currency assets took a hit in the hours following the lunch. Bitcoin (BTC) and ETH experienced minor declines in the hours following the launch as the global market capitalization shrunk by nearly 4%.\n\n\u201cWe would even go further to say a futures-only ETF is arguably detrimental to spot prices \u2013 as it potentially directs demand away from the spot market into synthetic markets,\u201d said one analyst.\n\nA stark difference from 2021\n\nAfter the SEC approved the launch of Bitcoin futures ETFs in October 2021, trading volumes went through the roof. At the time, the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF recorded a staggering $1 billion in volume, with close competitors racking up similar figures amid the push for a spot ETF.\n\nThe impressive ETF volumes propelled BTC to new highs of over $60K, laying the foundation for a new class of institutional interest in the asset. At the moment, investors continue to scan the horizon for an uptick in activity for the new ETH futures ETFs while key players continue to slug it out with the SEC for a BTC spot ETF."

        "title": "Is Ethereum\u2019s Staking Boom A Ticking Time Bomb? JPMorgan Weighs In - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Ethereum (ETH), a forerunner in the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, has seen a notable surge in its staking activities. This staking boom has raised eyebrows among experts from JPMorgan concerned over ETH\u2019s increase in centralization and the consequences that may arise.\n\nEthereum, aiming to transition to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, opened the floodgates for staking. This meant holders could \u2018stake\u2019 or lock their tokens to support network operations like block validation. However, while this promises rewards for the stakers, JPMorgan analysts have reported that there could be ripple effects.\n\nEthereum Centralization Concerns Rise To The Surface\n\nJPMorgan analysts, led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, highlight the inadvertent increase in Ethereum\u2019s network centralization, particularly post the Merge and Shanghai upgrades. The Ethereum network became \u201cmore centralized as the overall staking yield declined,\u201d they noted.\n\nAccording to the analysts, what\u2019s leading to this centralization could be attributed to liquid staking providers. Lido, a notable player, has been pinpointed for its dominant role. The JPMorgan report noted:\n\nThe top 5 liquid staking providers control more than 50% of staking on the Ethereum network, and Lido specifically accounts for almost one-third.\n\nThe analysts further disclosed while platforms such as Lido tote their decentralized nature, the underlying reality appears different. The analysts said these platforms \u201cinvolve a high degree of centralization.\u201d\n\nAccording to the analysts, the ramifications of such centralization can\u2019t be understated. They mentioned that \u201ca concentrated number of liquidity providers or node operators\u201d might compromise the network\u2019s integrity, leading to potential points of failure, attacks, or even conspiracy, resulting in an \u201coligopoly.\u201d\n\nThey further highlighted that such centralized entities could censor or exploit user transactions, undermining the community\u2019s interests.\n\nThe Rehypothecation Risk And Declining Rewards\n\nAnother dimension to the staking story is the looming threat of \u2018rehypothecation.\u2019 In simple terms, it\u2019s the act of leveraging staked assets as collateral across various DeFi platforms. According to the JPMorgan\u2019s analysts:\n\nRehypothecation could then result in a cascade of liquidations if a staked asset drops sharply in value or is hacked or slashed due to a malicious attack or a protocol error.\n\nFurthermore, as Ethereum continues its journey on the staking path, the staking rewards seem to diminish. The report indicated a drop in total staking yield from 7.3% before the Shanghai upgrade to roughly 5.5% recently.\n\nRegardless, Ethereum has shown a slight upward trajectory of 1.5% in the past 24 hours, with a market price currently sitting at $1,643 and a market cap of approximately $9 billion, at the time of writing.\n\nFeatured image from Unsplash, Chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Share this article URL Copied\n\nA new report from crypto brokerage firm K33 Research recommends reducing exposure to Ethereum in favor of Bitcoin after the muted launch of Ether futures ETFs last week.\n\nAccording to the report by Head of Research Anders Helseth and Senior Analyst Vetle Lunde, the freshly launched ETFs saw trading volumes reaching just 0.2% of the trading volumes seen for Bitcoin futures ETFs launched in 2021.\n\n\u201cIncreased institutional access will only create buying pressure if significant unsatiated demand exists. This is not the case for ETH at the moment,\u201d the analysts wrote.\n\nThe analysts argue the lukewarm response has more similarities to the 2017 CME Bitcoin futures debut than the excitement around 2021\u2019s Bitcoin ETFs, which saw immediate institutional demand.\n\nWhile the ETF approval represents a long-term watershed moment for Ethereum, the K33 report suggests reducing elevated Ether exposures for now until broader sentiment improves and institutions show renewed interest.\n\n\u201cWe believe it\u2019s time to pull the brakes on ETH and rotate back into BTC,\u201d the analyst wrote.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum both rose around 5% over the past week, though gave back nearly half of their gains leading to the disappointing ETF launch."

        "content": "A crypto wallet associated with Justin Sun, the co-founder of Tron, a smart contract platform, has moved 20,000 Ethereum (ETH) worth roughly $32.4 million from Lido Finance, a liquidity staking platform. Funds were transferred to Binance, the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange, trading volume and client count.\n\nThe transaction, executed in a single batch, was captured by The Data Nerd, an analysis platform, and shared on X on October 5. As it is, Ethereum (ETH) is under pressure, looking at the performance in the daily chart.\n\nEthereum Drops 4%, Are Bears Flowing Back?\n\nTrackers show that the coin is down roughly 4% in three days, confirming sellers of October 2. Notably, the daily chart has a double bar formation with the bear candlestick of October 2, completely reversing buyers of October 1.\n\nThis arrangement suggests that bears could be in control, especially considering the draw-down of the past few trading days and the level of participation on October 2 when the coin slipped.\n\nIn technical analysis, losses at the back of increasing volumes often point to high participation. If prices are rising, then the coin in question could rally. Conversely, a sell-off could worsen if the bar had high trading volumes.\n\nIt is also unclear whether Justin Sun plans to sell ETH after transferring coins to exchanges. Crypto transfers to centralized exchanges, which support many stablecoins like USDT and others, are often associated with sell-offs.\n\nMarket participants may interpret such movements as bearish, fueling the sell-off, subsequently heaping more pressure on prices. ETH is now at a one-week low.\n\nJustin Sun Shuffling ETH In 2023\n\nThe Data Nerd observes that prices fell the last time the wallet moved ETH to Huobi, which has since rebranded to HTX. In August, the wallet moved 5,000 ETH to HTX. The deposit came a week before ETH prices crashed 12%.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum prices fell sharply in mid-August, causing a \u201ccascade liquidation\u201d that spooked investors. ETH bulls have since failed to reverse those losses. Considering the relatively low trading volumes in the last two months, prices are still boxed within the August 17 trade range, a bearish signal.\n\nIn late February 2023, Justin Sun staked 150,000 ETH, worth roughly $240 million, to Lido Finance. The transfer remains the largest single-stay transaction, forcing the liquidity staking provider to activate the Staking Rate Limit feature, capping the amount of coins one can stake at 150,000 ETH.\n\nLido Finance said the feature is more of a \u201csafety valve\u201d that \u201caddresses possible side-effects such as rewards dilution, without needing to pause stake deposits explicitly.\u201d\n\nFeature image from Canva, chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Despite going through an extended crypto bear market, the most recent approvals and launches of multiple Ether Futures ETFs have boosted institutional investors\u2019 interest in the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap: Ethereum (ETH).\n\nOn October 2, six Ether Futures financial products started to be officially traded. They are, as follows, with their respective net expense ratios, according to CNBC:\n\nBitWise Ethereum Strategy ETF (AETH), 0.85%\n\nBitwise Bitcoin and Ether Equal Weight Strategy ETF (BTOP), 0.85%\n\nProShares Ether Strategy ETF (EETH), 0.95%\n\nProShares Bitcoin & Ether Equal Weight Strategy ETF (BETE), 0.95%\n\nBitcoin & Ether Market Cap Weight Strategy ETF (BETH), 0.95%\n\nVanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF (EFUT), 0.66%\n\nIn this context, James Butterfill \u2014 Head of Research at CoinShares Co. \u2014 reported an institutional inflow of $13 million in Ethereum products by October 4, being the first net-positive week in a seven-week run.\n\nNotably, Butterfill said that this current inflow could not be compared to the $200 million of institutional investors\u2019 capital inflow for Bitcoin (BTC) during the launch of the Bitcoin Futures ETF by ProShares in 2021, which can be explained by the current bearish market cycle, in opposed to 2021\u2019s euphoric bull market.\n\nFollowing the launch of various futures based Ethereum ETF launches in the US, we have seen US$13m of inflows so far this week, breaking a 7 week run of outflows.\n\n\n\nIt is well below the US$200m in the first day for futures based Bitcoin ETFs in the US.

        "content": "Key takeaways\n\nSolana (SOL) has become one of the most decentralized blockchain networks in addition to being one of the most scalable after reporting that its Nakamoto Coefficient score beats other leading chains\n\nA second validator client plus the addition of more nodes into the network have helped to improve the resilience of the blockchain following several major outages during its first 2 years\n\nCoinCodex price prediction algorithm expects SOL to surge in 2024\n\nSolana releases Validator Health Report for October showing major improvement to network decentralization\n\nSolana (SOL) has revealed that its Nakamoto Coefficient score now beats several leading blockchains in its Validator Health Report for October 2023. The report shows that Solana has experienced a steady improvement to the health and growth of its blockchain, with several major changes helping to improve the level of decentralization.\n\n1/ The most recent @Solana Validator Health Report is now published.\n\n\n\nSolana remains one of the largest proof-of-stake networks by node count, one of the most distributed by Nakamoto Coefficient, and now, one of the most resilient by validator clients.\n\n\n\n?https://t.co/84tag5MBCO pic.twitter.com/fRQl1Fb5t9 \u2014 Solana Foundation (@SolanaFndn) October 4, 2023\n\nThe Nakamoto Coefficient measures the least number of nodes required to successfully attack a blockchain. Since a blockchain is a distributed computer network that runs a consensus protocol in order to agree on the correct order of transactions, most blockchains can be successfully attacked if a single party gains control of the majority of nodes in the system.\n\nThe coefficient was designed by former Coinbase CTO Balaji Srinivasan to provide a measure for the level of decentralization, and by extension, the robustness of a given blockchain network. Solana\u2019s announcement that it is now more decentralized when compared against other leading chains follows a series of positive developments for the project.\n\nSolana\u2019s Nakamoto Coefficient score now beats Ethereum (ETH), Avalanche (AVAX), Cosmos (ATOM), and Polygon (MATIC), to name a few. The project has shared a detailed breakdown for the health of the Solana network in its recent Validator Report, discussing a range of key developments that have helped the network to improve the health of the network.\n\nPreviously, Solana had been criticized for being less decentralized than its competitors \u2014 a problem that caused several network outages during its first 2 years on mainnet. A new validator client created by Jito Labs was cited as a key reason why this is unlikely to occur again, and there are two additional validator clients currently in development that can further improve network resilience.\n\nMost notably, the Solana network now contains more nodes than many major blockchains, in addition to these nodes being more widely distributed. This has given Solana a Nakamoto Coefficient score of 31, beating out Ethereum\u2019s 25 and Avalanche\u2019s 27 respectively. This news means that Solana is now one of the most decentralized blockchains in addition to being one of the most scalable.\n\nFollowing spree of positive developments, algorithm predicts +343% move for SOL in the next 12 months\n\nSOL has outperformed the rest of the crypto market during 2023, owing to a particularly poor performance in 2022. The SOL token suffered a -78% loss in the aftermath of the FTX collapse, as investors may have lost confidence in a project that was strongly backed by both FTX and Alameda Research.\n\nYear-to-date, SOL has risen 133%, outperforming the total crypto market cap (TCAP) which has risen 41% in the same time frame. The CoinCodex price prediction algorithm expects SOL to continue its recovery over the next 12 months, forecasting a +343.67% move by 4th October 2024.\n\n1-year price prediction for Solana, via CoinCodex\n\nBottom line: Solana continues to optimize its network, improving robustness and decentralization\n\nDecentralized computer systems rely on the trusted nature of the majority of participants, while also providing financial incentives to help ensure the efficacy of the consensus protocol. The more decentralized a network is, the more robust it becomes, and Solana\u2019s recent achievement of becoming one of the most decentralized proof-of-stake networks is another major success for the project."

        "content": "Image: Shutterstock\n\nOn 2 October, UBS Asset Management announced the launch of its first live pilot of a tokenised variable capital company (VCC) fund. The initiative is part of the Monetary Authority of Singapore\u2019s (MAS) Project Guardian to bring real-world assets on the blockchain.To carry out this controlled pilot, UBS will leverage its in-house tokenisation service, UBS Tokenise. Using a smart contract on the Ethereum public blockchain, the pilot will allow UBS Asset Management to perform various operations, including fund subscriptions and redemptions, seamlessly.The pilot aligns perfectly with UBS Asset Management\u2019s global distributed ledger technology strategy to leverage blockchain technology, both public and private, for efficient fund issuance and distribution. This initiative contributes to the broader expansion of UBS\u2019s tokenisation services, marking a pivotal moment in their digital asset journey.Thomas Kaegi, Head of UBS Asset Management, Singapore and Southeast Asia, expressed that the recent development is a significant step in understanding the tokenisation of funds. He added, \u201cThrough this exploratory initiative, we will work with traditional financial institutions and fintech providers to help understand how to improve market liquidity and market access for clients.\u201dUBS has been at the forefront of developing innovative digital assets. In November 2022, it launched the world\u2019s first publicly traded digital bond - a 375 million Swiss franc-denominated three-year bond with a 2.33% coupon, which has the same instrument structure, legal status, and rating as a traditional UBS senior unsecured note.In June 2023, the UBS Tokenise platform was utilised in Hong Kong to issue digital structured notes by Bank of China Investment (BOCI), amounting to CNH 200 million ($27.3 million). These tokenised notes were created and issued on the Ethereum blockchain.Following the successful rollout of UBS\u2019s first pilot transactions, the asset management firm plans to continue with more live pilot use cases under Project Guardian, working with a broader range of partners and exploring different investment strategies. These collaborations would enhance market liquidity for the clients by gaining valuable insights.Although UBS tokenised service and VCC fund are relatively new, as these innovative solutions continue to evolve and gain traction, they can reshape the digital asset landscape and the financial system in the upcoming years."

        "title": "Wrapped Crypto Tokens, Explained - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "What is a wrapped token? Tokens are wrapped to make them usable on a different blockchain or in a particular environment to which they are not native. A wrapped token is a sort of cryptocurrency or digital asset that is backed by another coin or asset, often one that is native to a particular blockchain or network, or that is \u201cwrapped\u201d by it. But why are wrapped tokens important? Wrapped tokens are especially beneficial for cross-chain interoperability and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. They enable users to take advantage of the various features and services provided on several blockchains by allowing assets from one blockchain to be used easily on another. Depending on the exact use case and architecture of the wrapping mechanism, wrapped tokens can represent a broad variety of assets, including cryptocurrencies, stablecoins and even nonfungible tokens (NFTs). For instance, Wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC) is a well-known example on the Ethereum network. But what is Wrapped Bitcoin? WBTC represents Bitcoin (BTC) and enables users to communicate with Ethereum-based DeFi protocols and decentralized exchanges (DEXs) while preserving Bitcoin\u2019s intrinsic value and characteristics.\n\nHow do wrapped tokens work? When working with platforms for decentralized applications and DeFi that utilize many blockchains, wrapped tokens are very helpful. Here\u2019s how wrapped tokens work: Asset locking A specific amount of the native coin of one blockchain (such as Ethereum) is \u201clocked\u201d into a smart contract in order to generate a wrapped token. A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) or a trusted entity usually keeps an eye on this locking procedure. To create wrapped tokens, the locked native coin is used as collateral. Issuance of wrapped tokens After the original cryptocurrency is locked, a corresponding number of wrapped tokens are created or released on a different blockchain (for example, a wrapped version of Bitcoin known as wBTC is released on the Ethereum blockchain). Within the ecosystem of the second blockchain, these wrapped tokens, which stand in for ownership of the locked native coin, can be freely traded.\n\nTypes of wrapped tokens Various types of wrapped tokens include wBTC, wETH, stablecoin equivalents and blockchain-specific wrapped tokens. Wrapped tokens are designed to operate in harmony with particular blockchain settings, enabling the fusion of many assets into a single ecosystem. Wrapped Bitcoin, one of the many varieties of wrapped tokens, is a prime example; it enables BTC owners to use their holdings in Ethereum\u2019s decentralized applications and on DeFi platforms. The Ethereum network is similarly made more efficient via Wrapped Ether (wETH), which facilitates trading and smart contract interactions. Similarly, stablecoins can be easily used across several blockchain ecosystems because of the wrapped equivalents of stablecoins, such as Tether (USDT), USD Coin (USDC) and Dai (DAI). Additionally, some blockchains host their own wrapped tokens, such as BNB Smart Chain (BSC) and Polygon, fostering cross-chain compatibility and enabling a variety of decentralized use cases. In the constantly changing cryptocurrency ecosystem, these tokens play a crucial role in bridging the gap between blockchain networks, improving liquidity, fostering interoperability and extending accessibility.\n\nWhat are the benefits of wrapped tokens? Wrapped tokens enhance cross-chain compatibility, liquidity and asset functionality, fostering a more interconnected and versatile cryptocurrency ecosystem. In the world of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, wrapped tokens offer advantages. Firstly, they promote cross-chain interoperability, enabling the seamless integration of assets from many blockchains into a specific ecosystem. This improves users\u2019 access to a greater variety of assets and liquidity. Secondly, wrapped tokens can make it easier to integrate assets with other functionality. For example, wBTC can be used to integrate Bitcoin into the Ethereum DeFi ecosystem. They also standardize and simplify asset interactions, making them simpler to use. Additionally, wrapped tokens encourage decentralization by giving users more power over their assets. The utility, accessibility and adaptability of digital assets are significantly increased by these tokens across a variety of blockchain networks, encouraging a more connected and dynamic crypto economy."

        "title": "Crypto Domain Name Better than Ethereum Name Services ENS - Altcoin Buzz",
        "content": "Naming Services. They aren\u2019t just for prestige and vanity. You can make money with them too. See someone made $1.5 million with this Paradigm.eth domain name. Now with Ethereum\u2019s Name Service, many of the best names are taken and that ship has sailed.\n\nBut they aren\u2019t the only game in town. In fact, there\u2019s a great new decentralized name service on the market that\u2019s all about freedom and opportunity. And unlike waiting to flip a domain to see if you can make money, with this new service you are their partner and you make money just by minting a new domain. Curious about ENS? Let\u2019s check out some top naming services.\n\n1) ENS\n\nBy now most of you know the Ethereum Name Service. And it has lots of cool things that it can do. And if you were early, you were able to get some cool vanity names like: [Your First Name]. Eth. Those days are long gone now. While we like ENS and what it can do, here are some common complaints and shortcomings of ENS domains\n\nPay Yearly\n\nYou have to pay annual renewals for your ENS name. Many think if you are bothering to mint an NFT and pay for it it should be forever or until YOU decide to sell.\n\n\ud83d\udd39 https://t.co/go7SpAItLU v2.8 update! \ud83d\udd39 \u2b2b Improvements and anti-spam features in our Direct Messages \u2013 message any .eth @ensdomains address! \ud83d\ude0d (on @xmtp_) \u2b2b Improved HOME and ACTIVITY feeds where you can see your own and your friends activity! \ud83c\udf89 \u2014 Eth.co (@ethdotco) September 29, 2023\n\nOnly .eth\n\nYou can\u2019t register .com or other top-level domains. Only.eth. Some see this as limiting.\n\nBest Names Are Taken\n\nENS has been around for a long time. So all the best names have been taken. No one expects to be able to access Vitalik.eth but it would be cool if at least some names we really liked were available to mint now.\n\nOur next name service will give us some options like this.\n\nFlipping Only Way to Make Money\n\nThe only way to make money using ENS to buy names is to buy, hold, and flip. This means you have to wait for someone to reach out to you or try to find a marketplace where you can buy and sell them like OpenSea.\n\nENS 101: Avatars ENS names can have an associated avatar, enabled via a standard text record These avatars can be a simple picture, but ENS names can also utilize other NFTs as their avatars Check out our support page to learn more about ENS avatars\ud83d\udc47https://t.co/XY1FmU50H2 pic.twitter.com/l8HPy6qKtT \u2014 ens.eth (@ensdomains) September 15, 2023\n\nAll that said, ENS is a great service. But it\u2019s not the only one. And maybe you don\u2019t want a .eth name or to be associated with Ethereum in this way. We get it. So here are some other choices for you.\n\n2) Tomi\u2019s tDNS\n\nNow tomi goes about things a little differently. It\u2019s almost like you can start your own domain name registration business. When you mint a domain there, you earn 25% of the winning auction price for that domain.\n\nAnd because you are early, lots of great, sexy, and vanity names are available for you to mint right now. Some of the more popular names at auction now are:\n\nBitcoin.com\n\nhealthcare.com\n\nMedium.com\n\nLawyer.com\n\nThe internet was created to be decentralised but unfortunately it evolved to become highly centralised and controlling. Learn why the internet is not censorship resistant and how tomi fixes this:https://t.co/IXVlfnoRS0 pic.twitter.com/SvTbXcnOGl \u2014 tomiNet (@tomipioneers) August 23, 2023\n\nSo lots of big, big names that are long gone in other naming services are available here and now. Your own first name.com is probably available now on the tDNS. Tomi\u2019s system is unique. Its business model gives you a chance to make money not by flipping domains like elsewhere, but by being the original minter.\n\nAs I said, you get 25% of the auction price for a domain you minted. So there is nothing stopping you from going to tDNS and thinking of as many popular and vanity names as possible and minting them. In fact, you earn over time. With each increasing bid, you earn 25% of the difference in the new bid price. So you don\u2019t have to wait for the final winning bid to start earning.\n\nGo mint jimmy.com for example. Your name isn\u2019t Jimmy? Who cares? Other Jimmys will bid against each other at auction to get the domain. And you get paid. Once you mint, the domain goes to auction. And for someone wanting to operate domain names like a business, that\u2019s awesome.\n\nBut you should know that all names go directly to the auction automatically. So even if I go to tomi\u2019s tDNS to get mattie.com, it still has to go to auction before I can finally claim it as mine. And someone else could bid for it.\n\nMore About tomi\n\nSo for selling vanity names, this is really cool. For getting and keeping your own vanity name, you\u2019ll have to wait for it. This idea of you being a partner with tomi for the domain name sales is definitely cool and different. Ethereum sure isn\u2019t sharing any revenue with you.\n\nThe internet has transformed our entire lives from Web 1 to Web 2. And now the future is Web 3, a decentralized internet where users control their own data.https://t.co/Smu9Vh2RzQ pic.twitter.com/5aKkz89RIA \u2014 tomiNet (@tomipioneers) August 9, 2023\n\nAnd there\u2019s a great 5-tier referral program too. Once you join, you can earn up to 12.5% of the mint & bid price without even minting the domain yourself.\n\nOne last note. These first auctions are long. They go until May 15, 2024. So that is a while to wait, but the big advantage is that you can get names that are not accessible on other services. You just have to wait for it.\n\nOnce you get it, then you can build out your full tomiNet website. Do you have a custom domain name using one of these services? Let us know yours in the comments below.\n\n3) Unstoppable Domains\n\nLike tomi, once you pay for your domain name on Unstoppable Domains, it\u2019s yours forever. We like that. Unlike tomi, you can\u2019t get .com but unlike ENS, you have many choices here. Some domains you can buy include:\n\n.crypto\n\n.polygon for you MATIC lovers\n\n.x\n\n.blockchain\n\n.nft\n\nOver 3.9 MILLION Unstoppable domains registered so far \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f A huge thank you to our Unstoppable family for helping us hit this milestone! Together, we're unstoppable. pic.twitter.com/LgAidQKTsU \u2014 unstoppable.x (@unstoppableweb) October 4, 2023\n\nSo there are some excellent choices here based on what you like. As Unstoppable says on its own website, they\u2019ve registered more than 3.7 million domain names. It\u2019s VERY popular. This also means that, unlike tomi\u2019s tDNS, many great vanity names are already taken.\n\nUnstoppable is a great product and it has lots of integrations with wallets, apps, and other services. But all of that is still connected to the public Web2 version of the web.\n\nWith tomi\u2019s tDNS, you control now just your domain name but its access to a fully decentralized web too.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe information discussed by Altcoin Buzz is not financial advice.

        "content": "Ethereum and Polygon-based NFTs on OpenSea recorded their lowest sales volume this year in September.\n\nBlur continued to outpace OpenSea in terms of monthly sales volume.\n\nThe monthly sales volume of Ethereum [ETH] and Polygon [MATIC]-based non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on leading marketplace OpenSea closed September at its lowest level so far this year, data from Dune Analytics revealed.\n\nDuring the general bull market in the year\u2019s first quarter, the monthly sales of Ethereum-minted NFTs on the marketplace reached an impressive peak of $659.02 million in February.\n\nAs interest in this form of digital collectibles began to wane in March, monthly sales volume on OpenSea embarked on a descent, and has fallen consistently in the past seven months.\n\nAt the end of September, the sales volume for Ethereum NFTs on OpenSea totaled $74 million. This represented a 98% fall from its February peak and a 30% decline month-over-month (MoM).\n\nSimilarly, following a record-breaking NFT sales volume of $109.12 million in February, Polygon-based NFTs on OpenSea have received decreased patronage from OpenSea\u2019s users.\n\nThe total sales volume in September was $5 million \u2013 a 95% decline in sales since February and a 29% fall MoM. This marked its lowest sales volume since the year began.\n\nIn addition to declining sales volume, the number of traders who completed transactions involving Ethereum and Polygon-based collectibles on OpenSea in September also declined.\n\nRegarding the count of Ethereum-minted NFTs sold on OpenSea in September, this totaled 248,089. This was a 1% uptick from the 244,907 Ethereum-based NFTs sold on the marketplace in August.\n\nHowever, there remains a significant decline on a year-to-date (YTD) basis. In January, over 1 million Ethereum NFTs were sold on OpenSea.\n\nAs for Polygon-based collectibles, the sales count fell to a YTD low in September. During the 30-day period, 169,072 Polygon NFTs were sold on OpenSea.\n\nOpenSea remains in Blur\u2019s shadows\n\nBlur [BLUR] continues to dominate OpenSea in terms of monthly NFT trading volume, data from DappRadar revealed. According to the data provider, NFTs trading volume on Blur totaled $138.8 million.\n\nOpenSea trailed behind it with a trading volume of $59 million, registering a 22% decline in the last month. Moreover, Blur saw more NFT trading activity despite having fewer traders compared to OpenSea during the period under consideration.\n\nAccording to DappRadar, traders that completed NFTs transactions on OpenSea in the last month totaled 173,000. However, Blur saw a mere 28,000 traders."

        "content": "The price of Ethereum (ETH) is giving strong bearish signals despite expectations of an \u2018Uptober\u2019 rally. There has been a lot of fundamentally positive Ethereum news in the past few months. However, the ETH price action keeps disappointing the holders.\n\nOn Thursday, cryptocurrencies remained sideways as the Bitcoin price remained stuck in the Monday range. Ethereum price is underperforming Bitcoin since the start of this week. Despite a 1.28% rebound in Bitcoin in the last trading session, ETH remained in a downtrend.\n\nVanEck Ethereum Futures ETF Goes Live\n\nThis week started with the launch of VanEck Ethereum futures ETF. The first-ever ETH exchange trading fund will give investors exposure to the second-biggest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. However, it won\u2019t translate into a direct investment in the native asset of the Ethereum smart contract blockchain.\n\nAccording to the reports, Proshares, Bitwise, and other asset managers have also launched similar ETFs this week. This suggests that there is a growing interest in Ethereum by the major financial institutions.\n\nETH TVL Is Down 5% YTD\n\nAccording to the decentralized finance (DeFi) tracking website, DeFi Llama, there has been a slight decrease in TVL on the Ethereum blockchain since the start of 2023. The following chart shows that the total locked value has plummeted around 7% in the past 9 months.\n\nSince Ethereum price is up 36% YTD, the TVL decrease points towards an outflow of funds from the biggest blockchain platform. A deeper dive into on-chain analysis reveals that most of these finds have moved to layer 2 networks like zkSync, Scroll, Arbitrum, and Optimism for airdrop farming. In terms of TVL and network activity, Ethereum remains the biggest and most secure smart contract platform on the planet.\n\nETH/BTC Tanks To 15-Month Lows\n\nThe analysis of the ETH/BTC pair on the daily timeframe gives a very bearish outlook. ETH price has been in a free fall against Bitcoin since September 2022. This shows that the investors have moved their capital from Ethereum to Bitcoin during this time. This also shows a prevalent risk-off approach in the crypto markets.\n\nThere is a clear formation of the falling wedge pattern on the following chart. The ETH/BTC pair is trading at its lowest level since July 2022, which shows the weakness of the smart contract asset compared to the Bitcoin price. In case of a breakdown from this pattern, my previously forecasted level of 0.05 will be on the cards.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction\n\nThe short-term outlook of the ETH to USD pair is also not looking very bullish. On a 4-hour timeframe, the price is trading within the $1750-$1577 range. After a rejection from the range highs at the start of October 2023, the Ethereum price prediction is looking extremely bearish.\n\nIn the coming days, there is a strong likelihood of a retest of the range lows around $1,577. Bulls need to gain strength above the range highs to show some strength and boost investor confidence.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Zcash Mining More Profitable Than Bitcoin, Ethereum, Faces Inflation Problems - CoinCentral",
        "content": "The Zcash privacy coin has gained tremendous prominence among miners within the past few months as many disenchanted enthusiasts seek out digital currencies with greater rewards and less capital investment.\n\nAccording to the latest statistics, the coin\u2019s hash rate has grown by over 400 percent since July last year and remained immutable even after the capricious November price slump. Bitcoin and Ethereum\u2019s hash rate dipped in the wake of the shifting landscape as miners struggled to break even.\n\nMining profitability is the main reason why more miners are jumping on the Zcash bandwagon. Mining Zcash is still profitable as compared to other cryptocurrencies. According to CryptoCompare statistics, many Zcash miners are still able to achieve near 100 percent profitability while mining Zcash.\n\nAt a power consumption of 1000 watts and at a cost of $0.12 kilowatts per hour, Zcash mining profits can reach about $85 per month. This translates to just over $1,000 a year. Scaled properly, miners can make substantial gains.\n\nThose with more efficient miners and access to cheap crypto mining power stand to make huge returns on the profitability metric. On the other hand, many Bitcoin miners are set to incur losses reaching up to 81 percent, while mining at a hashing rate of 4730 GH/s and at a power consumption of 1293 watts. Power consumption of the figures listed are at a cost of $0.12 KWh. Ethereum mining does not fare very well either. Mining profitability is in the red at a 41 percent loss.\n\nIt is important to note that the illustrated data is a general average and does not take into account mining equipment efficiency.\n\nThe Zcash Inflation Rate Problem\n\nThat said, the positive returns and the subsequent growth of the Zcash network has caused some unforeseen after-effects. Among them is a climbing inflation rate. Right now the network reportedly has a 0.1 percent daily inflation rate.\n\nDaily digital currency issuance has reached the equivalent of about $400,000. Although these figures seem abysmal, they add up significantly when calculating the yearly inflation rate and may become a major problem in the future. A high inflation rate means that coins devalue over time, and this will have a negative impact on the ecosystem.\n\nRight now, there is ongoing debate as to whether Harmony Mining can solve the problem if included in the Blossom upgrade that is scheduled for October. The upgrade is set to include dual proof-of-work capabilities, which are expected to help redistribute tokens by utilizing two mining algorithms.\n\nMore than one algorithm means more mining options. Miners will be able to use both GPU and ASIC miners, subsequently spreading political influence.\n\nBitcoin, the most dominating cryptocurrency by market cap, has an inflation rate of about 4 percent per annum, which is a lot less than Zcash.\n\nHow Other Networks Are Fighting Inflation\n\nThe Bitcoin Anti-Inflation Mechanism\n\nIt is worth noting that, Bitcoin, the mother of all cryptocurrencies was created to be a decentralized currency alternative in the event that global economies would be upended by hyperinflation. As such, it has an inflation regulation mechanism built into its protocol.\n\nThe lodestar cryptocurrency was invented during the world financial crisis of 2008 and according to the white paper written by Satoshi Nakamoto, the algorithm was designed to regulate the supply of bitcoin by adjusting difficulty. Difficulty would increase if the network experienced an upsurge in mining activity and inversely go down if there was a drop in the number of miners. The network is also programmed to stop the mining of new coins at 21 million.\n\nThis would inevitably create scarcity and rising demand that would consequently counter inflation, thereby triggering a rise in value. With the mining option now out of the equation, bitcoin transactions would increase and inflation would decrease. Right now, over 17.4 million bitcoins have been mined.\n\nThe Bitcoin algorithm is set to cut miner rewards in half in 2020 through a process referred to as halving. The process has been a major bitcoin price-hike catalyst over the years. It has historically led to a price rally in the months preceding the event.\n\nThe subsequent scarcity that is bound to occur will lead to a rise in value, a trend that crypto investors are advised to watch for. A price rally in anticipation of halving historically starts about a year prior to the event and is, in this case, expected to start in May 2019. Block reward halving is expected to occur on May 25, 2020. Prices are expected to rally again and settle at a point of equilibrium.\n\nThe last two halving events triggered huge price escalations. The 2012 halving event, which occurred in November, caused bitcoin\u2019s price to jump from $12 to $240 within six months. And the last halving event, which occurred on July 9, 2016, led to an unprecedented price uptick from $580 to $900 within a few months.\n\nCountering the Ethereum Inflation Rate\n\nEthereum\u2019s inflation rate is bound to decrease after the Constantinople upgrade, currently scheduled for February. It is expected to bring down the supply of the digital currency by 33 percent. Experts envisage that this will cause Ethereum to increase in value. Overall, the hard fork is expected to create greater price stability.\n\n(Feature Image Credit: Pixabay)"

In anticipation of this Friday's official release of US Non-farm payroll data, the preliminary data for September's US Private Payroll employment indicated an increase of 89,000 jobs, below the projected 153,000 jobs. Depending on market momentum holding the pace, Bitcoin's price may either push towards the $30,000 threshold or settle back into the $27,000 trading range. Altcoin AVAX has experienced notable growth, surpassing a 9 percent increase in the last 24 hours, thanks to the launch of Stars Arena, a SocialFi platform, on the Avalanche blockchain.\u201d\n\nShubham Hudda, Senior Manager, CoinSwitch Markets Desk, said, \u201cThe crypto market seems to be calming down after Monday\u2019s sharp rally. Bitcoin (BTC, +0.9 percent) showed an upward move yesterday albeit a slow one with it still remaining below the $28k mark. The major mover of yesterday remained AVAX (+8.7 percent) as it crossed the $10 mark after 28 days due to the gaining popularity of its social app Stars Arena which is a direct competitor of the very popular base chain app friend.tech.\u201d\n\nRajagopal Menon, Vice President, WazirX, said, \u201cBitcoin (BTC) inched up 1.3 percent in the last 24 hours, reaching around $27,700 amid a more stable crypto market and easing traditional market pressures. Although BTC briefly touched $28,000 earlier this week, it retraced some gains. October is expected to see a sideways movement, offering opportunities for investors in the long term. On WazirX, Standard Tokenization Protocol (STPT) and Pendle (PENDLE) have been the top gainers in the last 24 hours.\u201d\n\nSathvik Vishwanath, CEO and co-founder of Unocoin, said, \u201cOn the 4-hour Bitcoin price chart, key levels include the pivot point at $27,267, immediate resistance at $28,427, and further resistance at $29,222 and $29,997. On the other hand, immediate support lies at $26,775, followed by $25,900 and $25,000. Technical indicators suggest bullish sentiment with RSI 59 above the 50 threshold and 50-day EMA at $27,260, indicating a short-term bullish trend. Notably, the 50-day EMA support at $27,300 is particularly interesting and potentially signals a bull market if it holds. In the short term, given the current trends and resistance levels, Bitcoin seems likely to test higher resistance points.\u201d\n\nShivam Thakral, CEO of BuyUcoin, said, \u201cMarket is witnessing an uneasy calm as one of the most high-profile trials of the beleaguered crypto exchange, FTX, begins. The global crypto community will be closely watching the proceedings and the outcome of the trial and recovery of consumer funds will strengthen the trust and credibility of the crypto industry around the globe. The overall crypto market remained flat with XRP rallying around 5 percent after a US judge rejected the SEC bid to appeal against Ripple. The markets will be less volatile in the coming week if there are no surprising news headlines.\u201d\n\nCoinDCX Research Team told ABP Live, \u201cIn the past 24 hours, BTC has seen a 1 percent increase in value, currently trading above Rs 23,50,000 ($27,600). It's maintaining its position above both the 50 and 200 EMA Daily, which is considered a positive sign. On the other hand, ETH has experienced slight gains in the last 24 hours, reaching Rs 1,43,000 ($1,640). However, it remains below the 50 and 200 EMA Daily, which raises some concerns. Avalanche's AVAX, a Layer 1 blockchain, has been a top performer in CoinDCX among major cryptocurrencies, with an impressive 8 percent surge in the last 24 hours.\u201d\n\nSubscribe And Follow ABP Live On Telegram: t.me/officialabplive\n\nDisclaimer: Crypto products and NFTs are unregulated and can be highly risky.

        "title": "Tron Has More Daily Active Addresses Than Ethereum: What's Supercharging Growth? - Bitcoinist",
        "content": "Tron, a platform where users can deploy smart contracts and run decentralized applications (dapps) like they would in Ethereum, is rapidly growing its daily active addresses (DAA). DAA is the count of unique addresses that send or receive tokens on a blockchain on any given day.\n\nTron\u2019s DAA Exploding, Surpasses Ethereum, Bitcoin\n\nAccording to metrics shared by decentralized finance (DeFi) researcher Alex Wacy on October 6, citing Token Terminal, Tron has over 1.9 million DAA, more than twice those in the BNB Chain, which, at the time of sharing, stood at 915,000. Ethereum and Polygon had 320,000 and 301,000 trailing Bitcoin, the legacy blockchain, which had 570,000 DAA.\n\nAt this level, it is estimated that Tron is creating 200,000 new addresses daily. Other metrics also show that Tron has at least 188 million unique accounts that have generated 6.5 billion transactions.\n\nThe spike in DAA, Wacy said, could be because of Tron\u2019s role in stablecoin transactions. Stablecoins are designed to track the value of another asset, mostly fiat currencies like the USD. The researcher said roughly $45 billion of all stablecoins are held in Tron, complying with the TRC-20 standard. Out of this, 50% of all USDT transactions are on Tron.\n\nThe surge in Tron\u2019s DAA is noteworthy. It is when the broader cryptocurrency scene struggles with volatile asset prices and relatively low on-chain activity, especially in areas like DeFi, metaverse, non-fungible token (NFT), and blockchain.\n\nDeFiLlama data shows that the total value locked (TVL) in DeFi, for instance, is below $40 billion, well below the $173 billion level when crypto asset prices peaked in late 2021.\n\nLegacy Blockchains Are Still Preferred Despite Suppressed Activity\n\nLooking at DAA alone, there is an inversion, and legacy networks, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, are trailing third-generation platforms promising cheaper transaction fees and higher throughput. From the DAA leaderboard, Tron, the BNB Chain, and NEAR Protocol are attracting new users.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum\u2019s engagement appear suppressed, looking at DAA. Though DAA can be a metric to consider when gauging how users interact with the network, Bitcoin and Ethereum are still preferred blockchains.\n\nBitcoin, for instance, inherently lacks smart contracts capability, but there are protocols built on it, like Rootstock, that support this feature. However, Bitcoin, due to its first-mover advantage, has found adoption. BTC is also listed in almost most exchanges and enables the daily transfer of millions, if not billions, of dollars.\n\nThis has cemented its activity and could explain why it is above Ethereum despite the latter\u2019s activity density, especially considering fees generated from smart contracts execution and transfers. As of October 6, CryptoFees show that Ethereum generated over $2 million in fees, more than twice in Bitcoin.\n\nFeature image from Canva, chart from TradingView"

        "title": "Bullish signs for Ethereum price: $2,000 by the end of the year? - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "Several on-chain indicators suggest that the price of Ethereum could see an imminent rally, as the circulating supply of ETH on cryptocurrency exchanges is in sharp decline.\n\nMonitoring the change in supply of a cryptocurrency on CEXs is crucial for making medium-term predictions, as this metric provides important information about the potential selling pressure of an asset.\n\nThe price of ETH could be closer than ever to a bullish break of $2,000 per coin, which could happen by the end of the year, given and taking into account the historical returns of the cryptocurrency market in the fourth quarter, especially in October.\n\nLet\u2019s look at all the details together and try to shed some light on it.\n\nOn-chain data shows positive signs for Ethereum\u2019s future price\n\nAlthough the general outlook for the cryptocurrency market is not the best, some on-chain indicators show very positive conditions for Ethereum\u2019s price in the medium term.\n\nIn particular, we can see that ETH\u2019s balance on centralised exchanges has fallen dramatically since the beginning of the year, reaching its lowest level since May 2018.\n\nIndeed, since 1 January 2023, the number of coins on CEX has fallen from 18.48 million ETH to the current 14.56 million. This represents a reduction of almost 4 million crypto coins, which are now held in private wallets or staking on the Beacoin chain.\n\nThis helps to alleviate potential selling pressure on platforms such as Binance, Coinbase, Kraken, Bybit, Okx, etc., where there is generally more trading taking place and more short positions being opened with derivatives.\n\nIf this trend continues for a few more months (and demand picks up in parallel), the price of Ethereum is likely to rise significantly.\n\nStill on the subject of changes in stock market reserves, it should be noted that, according to the Santiment platform, around 110,000 ETH were withdrawn on 4 October, accelerating the flight of capital to decentralised platforms and wallets.\n\nThis is an unusual movement, behind which a whale or a series of individuals with considerable economic power are likely to be hiding.\n\n#Ethereum | Roughly 110,000 $ETH were withdrawn from known #crypto exchange wallets in the past 24 hours, worth around $177.65 million, according to onchain data from @santimentfeed. pic.twitter.com/3CGVgOQUbM \u2014 Ali (@ali_charts) October 5, 2023\n\nCurrently, there are approximately 115.88 million ETH outside of exchanges, of which approximately 27.32 million are staked on the proof-of-stake network.\n\nIn October 2022, this number was around 14.1 million ETH: this means that in about a year, more than 13 million ETH have been taken out of circulation and placed on the Ethereum storage contract or on a liquid staking platform.\n\nIt is also interesting to note that the current price of Ethereum is roughly the same as it was then (closing price October 2022), so those who locked their coins exactly one year ago today can boast a return of around 4-5%.\n\nWill ETH reach $2,000 by the end of the year?\n\nHaving looked at the on-chain data, which suggests that there is fertile ground for Ethereum\u2019s price growth, let\u2019s talk about predictions: will ETH reach $2,000 by the end of the year?\n\nLet\u2019s start with the assumption that, despite the optimism of indicators based on the internal movements of the blockchain, the most important context to watch is the macroeconomic one, especially in the US territory, where a further increase in interest rates on government bonds could be in sight in November.\n\nSuch a scenario could lead investors to reduce their allocation to more speculative markets such as cryptocurrencies, with negative consequences for the price of ether and the crypto sector in general.\n\nFurthermore, the issues surrounding the possible approval of a spot ETF on Bitcoin could also indirectly affect the price of the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalisation.\n\nIndeed, it is well known that BTC and ETH almost always move in tandem, and a catalytic event such as the approval of the first legitimate spot ETF in the US would certainly trigger a major uptrend for Ethereum as well.\n\nSpeaking of ETFs, it is worth noting that an ETH futures on ETF was approved by the SEC a few days ago, but generated very little investor interest with only 2 million trades.\n\nVanEck\u2019s new ETH futures ETF only did $2 million of trading volume in its first day yesterday.\n\n\n\nPretty wild compared to the BTC futures ETF that did 500x that in its first day during the bull mkt.\n\n\n\nShows how dead this market really is lol \u2014 Will (@WClementeIII) October 3, 2023\n\nComing back to our original question, we can confirm that it is very likely that if the FED reverses its monetary policy strategy by switching to quantitative easing and/or if the SEC approves the first spot ETF for BTC in the US, then the price of Ethereum will be well above the $2,000 mark.\n\nUnfortunately, if these two events do not happen by the end of the year, the on-chain data may not be enough to push the value of ETH to that level.\n\nWhile these types of indicators work well in the medium term, they are not accurate in the short term.\n\nSeveral traders are currently short ETH, fearing that the weekly candles that have formed since the beginning of the year have contributed to the \u201cbear flag\u201d pattern that usually indicates the possibility of upcoming declines.\n\nOn X, user \u2018Chill Trader\u2019 shared his opinion on Ethereum\u2019s price action, saying that while he expects a bullish bounce in the next few days, he believes that a breach of the $1,565 level will result in another dump that will take the price of the coin into a range between $1,440 and $1,370."

After bottoming out in June 2022, ETH price has been in an uptrend since the start of 2023.\n\nEthereum price now $[crypto name=\u201dethereum\u201d type=\u201dprice\u201d] Ethereum\u2019s Price change percentage 24h ago [crypto name=\u201dethereum\u201d type=\u201dpriceChangePercentage24h\u201d]% Ethereum\u2019s Price change percentage 7 days ago [crypto name=\u201dethereum\u201d type=\u201dpriceChangePercentage7d\u201d]% Ethereum\u2019s highest price 7 days ago [crypto name=\u201dethereum\u201d type=\u201dhigh7d\u201d]$ Ethereum\u2019s lowest price 7 days ago [crypto name=\u201dethereum\u201d type=\u201dlow7d\u201d]$ Ethereum\u2019s highest price 90 days ago [crypto name=\u201dethereum\u201d type=\u201dlow90d\u201d]$ Ethereum\u2019s lowest price 90 days ago [crypto name=\u201dethereum\u201d type=\u201dlow90d\u201d]$ Ethereum\u2019s highest price all time [crypto name=\u201dethereum\u201d type=\u201dhighAllTime\u201d]$ Ethereum\u2019s lowest price all time [crypto name=\u201dethereum\u201d type=\u201dlowAllTime\u201d]$ Ethereum\u2019s lowest price change percentage of all time [crypto name=\u201dethereum\u201d type=\u201dlowAllTimeChangePercentage\u201d] Ethereum\u2019s lowest price change percentage of all time [crypto name=\u201dethereum\u201d type=\u201dhighAllTimeChangePercentage\u201d] Ethereum\u2019s rank [crypto name=\u201dethereum\u201d type=\u201drank\u201d] Ethereum price overview\n\nCoin Founders\n\nEight co-founders are behind the development of Ethereum. Vitalik Buterin, Gavin Wood, Anthony Di Iorio, Charles Hoskinson, Amir Chetrit, Jeffrey Wilcke, Mihai Alisie and Joseph Lubin are the eight original founders of Ethereum. Of the eight co-founders, Vitalik Buterin remains the only one still actively involved in work on the platform and has become the public face of the project. At least two of the eight co-founders left to start their blockchain projects. The others are involved in other projects supporting Ethereum or have left the industry entirely.\n\nEthereum Road map\n\nThe development of Ethereum was funded by a crowd sale that took place between July and August 2014. More than $18m was raised, with the first live release of the Ethereum blockchain occurring in 2015. Here is a brief timeline of the Ethereum roadmap.\n\nIn May 2015, 25,000 ETH were distributed as rewards for stress tests conducted on the Public Testnet in what was known as the Olympic testing phase. This was followed closely in July 2015 by Frontier, which was the official launch of the public mainnet. The genesis block was mined into existence, with transactions being suspended for a few days to allow for more significant signups from miners and clients. At this time, 5 ETH was the block reward.\n\nHomestead followed in March 2016. This upgrade introduced the Mist ETH wallet and new codes for the Solidity programming language. In addition, the Canary contracts were abolished.The DAO hard fork occurred in 2016 after the theft of $50m worth of Ethereum. The vulnerability led to the split and creation of Ethereum and Ethereum Classic.The Byzantium upgrade reduced the mining rewards from 5ETH to 3ETH. This upgrade occurred on 16 October 2017.\n\nFebruary 2019 brought the Constantinople upgrade, reducing block rewards from 3ETH to 2ETH. Smart contracts could now verify each other with a hash of another contract, and this upgrade also provided better support of off-chain transactions. October 2019 brought the Istanbul upgrade, the next hard fork, and upgrade that preceded Serenity.\n\nChanges to gas costs for different operations were proposed, and the ProgPoW mining algorithm reduced the efficiency advantage of ASIC miners., known as Ethereum 1.x. The first phase of Serenity (Serenity Phase 0) signals the move from the proof-of-work to the proof-of-stake consensus mechanism.\n\nSerenity Phase 1 launched in 2020, dividing the network\u2019s transactions among several sets of randomly organized validators. The Beacon Chain now supports 1024 Shard chains with validation by collecting 128 nodes.\n\nEthereum Merge Upgrade\n\nIn September, Ethereum activated the merge, which brought together the old version and the Beacon Chain. As a result, Ethereum moved from being a proof-of-work (PoW) network to a proof-of-stake network. This was a major milestone for the biggest layer 1 smart contract platform on the planet, which received widespread attention from the whole crypto community.\n\nEthereum Shapella/ Shanghai Upgrade\n\nIn April 2023, Ethereum underwent the Shanghai upgrade, which enabled the unstaking of the ETH crypto from the beacon chain. This was a major development for the whole ecosystem as the validators had billions of dollars of ETH locked. The update also reduced the gas fees for some transactions and implemented better security features with improved support for L2s.\n\nEthereum TVL & Adoption Stats\n\nEthereum is currently by far the biggest smart contract platform in terms of on-chain activity and the total locked value (TVL). Currently, the network boasts $26.4 billion TVL, which is 60% of the total TVL across all blockchains. Most of this TVL comes from decentralized applications (Dapps) like LIDO, AAVE, Maker DAO, and Uniswap.\n\nWhat has been the story of Ethereum\u2019s price adoption?\n\n\u2013 The number of Ethereum addresses in the last five years has grown tremendously, far exceeding that of Bitcoin.\n\n\u2013 Ethereum remains the platform of choice for many developers of decentralized applications (dApps). Nearly 80% of all dApps are built on Ethereum. The data from Consensys is shown below.\n\n(c) Consensys: 2021\n\nAs of July 2021, Ethereum had over 689,000 addresses and exceeded the number of active BTC wallets by more than 200,000, in data showcased by Benzinga.By December 2021, non-zero Ethereum wallets hit an all-time high of 71,364,788. This was made possible by the explosion in interest in non-fungible tokens (NFTs). This data piece was pulled from Glassnode.\n\nSource: Glassnode 2021.\n\nThe various metrics measured show that Ethereum adoption and usage continue to grow, despite the price correction experienced recently.\n\n[crypto name=\u201dEthereum\u201d]\n\nEthereum Price Prediction 2024\n\nSince its November 2022 lows, ETH price has been in an uptrend. During this time, the price has surged 53%. The following chart shows that the asset is facing strong resistance above the key psychological level of $2,000. It is also evident that the price is respecting an upward trendline since the start of 2023.\n\nIf the uptrend remains intact, the Ethereum price prediction of $2,000 seems likely to be met at the start of 2024. However, a lot will also depend on the bulls\u2019 ability to break the $2,000 barrier. On the other hand, a major correction in ETH to $1,200 will be on the cards if BTC breaks down below $25,000.\n\nETH Price Analysis\n\nI\u2019ll keep posting my updated ETH price prediction and my personal trade setups on Twitter, where you are welcome to follow me.\n\nYEAR MINIMUM PRICE MAXIMUM PRICE 2023 $1,601 $3,810 2024 $3,551 $5,087 2025 $4,512 $6,551 2026 $5,920 $8,570 2027 $7,716 $11,132 2028 $9,013 $13,163 2029 $11,012 $16,612 2030 $11,340 $19,442\n\nEthereum Price Prediction 2025\n\nThe Ethereum price prediction 2025 also retains a bullish bias as long as the ascending trendline on the weekly price chart of the ETH/USDT pair is respected. This trendline intersects the 50% Fibonacci retracement level from the swing low of 21 January 2019 to the swing high of 8 November 2021.\n\nMONTH MINIMUM PRICE MAXIMUM PRICE January $4,559 $5,160 February $5,160 $5,260 March $5,260 $5,461 April $5,361 $5,611 May $5,461 $5,761 June $5,611 $5,862 July $5,711 $5,962 August $5,862 $6,112 September $6,012 $6,262 October $6,112 $6,363 November $5,962 $6,463 December $6,162 $6,563\n\nETH/USDT: Weekly Chart\n\nOn a weekly timeframe, Ethereum has made a lower low on the weekly chart, which has broken the bullish market structure. To flip bullish on the weekly chart, the ETH price needs to break above $3,580.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction 2030\n\nThe Ethereum price prediction 2030 is that the coin could be trading closer to the $10,000 mark. This view is consequent on the ETH/USDT pair breaking above the $4877 mark (all-time high), which allows for a push to sequential Fibonacci extension targets at 7324, 8641, 9328, and 10316. But, again, this Ethereum price prediction 2030 depends on the ability of the bulls to hold the fort at the existing trendline that intersects the 50% Fibonacci extension level.\n\nIs Ethereum a Good Investment?\n\nSuppose there is any cryptocurrency that will remain relevant for years to come in terms of the sheer scale of its utility and application. In that case, Ethereum is a powerful candidate. Indeed, it will be a bold statement to say that the advent of Ethereum is the main reason the cryptocurrency market survived the teething challenges of its early years. The Mt.Gox saga nearly buried Bitcoin, but Ethereum resurrected it and led to the market revolutions that followed. The development of initial coin offerings (ICOs) and decentralized finance (DeFi), the development of smart contracts, and cross-chain interoperability are all products of Ethereum\u2019s entrance into the blockchain arena.\n\nHow to buy Ethereum?\n\nHow to buy Ethereum is not an issue. It is available on almost every crypto exchange. There are two ways to do this. The Basic function allows for quick conversion of the purchase of fiat or cryptocurrency with Ethereum at market price. The Advanced process allows for expanded purchase options, such as setting limit prices, purchasing specific amounts, etc. Ethereum is usually listed in pairing with Bitcoin (ETH/BTC), US Dollar (ETH/USD), Tether (ETH/USDT) and several other cryptos.\n\n\u201cThere are multiple fundamental and technical factors behind the negative ETH price action. According to the most recent news, the Securities and Exchange Commission of the United States had sued the top crypto exchanges Coinbase and Binance. These development are acting as the tailwinds for ETH.\n\nSEC has labelled BNB, BUSD, MATIC, SOL, CHZ, ADA, and many other top cryptocurrencies as securities in its latest lawsuits. However, the regulator hasn\u2019t taken any stance on Ethereum yet. Nevertheless, sooner or later we may have big news on the status of ETH as well.\u201d\n\nETH/USDT: Monthly Chart"

        "title": "Ethereum Futures ETFs Fall Short: Analysts Call For Return To Bitcoin - TronWeekly",
        "content": "The debut of nine new Ethereum futures exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on October 2 has fallen short of expectations, prompting market analysts at K33 Research to advocate a return to Bitcoin. In their market report released on October 3, analysts Anders Helseth and Vetle Lunde expressed disappointment in the initial performance of these Ethereum futures ETFs.\n\nThe trading volume for Ether futures ETFs on their first day of trading amounted to a mere 0.2% of the colossal volume achieved by the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) during its October 2021 launch. While it was anticipated that Ether ETFs wouldn\u2019t match the Bitcoin ETF\u2019s initial success, the figures were far from encouraging.\n\nThis lack of enthusiasm from institutional investors led Vetle Lunde to backtrack on his prior advice to increase Ethereum allocations, cautioning that there was no substantial unsatiated demand for Ether at the moment.\n\nLunde\u2019s report also highlighted the current absence of significant short-term price catalysts in the broader cryptocurrency market, indicating a potential continuation of sideways movement. According to Lunde, the most promising prospects lie with Bitcoin, which awaits a potential ETF approval in early 2024 and an upcoming halving event in mid-April.\n\nThis view aligns with Ben Laidler, global markets strategist at eToro, who suggested that macroeconomic factors such as the Federal Reserve\u2019s decisions and rising oil prices could influence the crypto market\u2019s direction.\n\nLimited Investment Inflows for Ethereum ETFs\n\nDespite the excitement surrounding the Ether futures ETFs\u2019 launch, these products saw limited investment inflows. On the first day of trading, all nine ETFs collectively generated less than $2 million in trading volume.\n\nValkyrie\u2019s Bitcoin Strategy ETF, the most popular among them, accumulated $882,000 in trading volume, even though it had initially focused solely on Bitcoin futures before adjusting its strategy to include Ethereum.\n\nComparatively, the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF, introduced during a bullish crypto market in October 2021, recorded over $1 billion in trading volume on its first day. Eric Balchunas, senior Bloomberg ETF analyst, noted that, while the volume wasn\u2019t insignificant, investors generally favored spot ETF products over futures.\n\nUnprecedented day today with multiple ETFs all launching at same time. No clear winner has emerged, all of them were pretty average, lower than I would have predicted, but its a long run and remember, these hold futures (ETF investors much prefer physical to derivatives) https://t.co/fKGOv8T7pP \u2014 Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) October 2, 2023\n\nHowever, the SEC\u2019s simultaneous launch of these products was a strategic move to prevent any single fund from dominating the market. Amid this competition among US firms in the emerging Ether futures market, ETF firm Volatility Shares opted to cancel its plans, citing a lack of opportunity at the current juncture.\n\nRelated Reading | Crypto Revolution: Grand Theft Auto\u2019s Maker\u2019s Sugartown Surpasses $5M"
