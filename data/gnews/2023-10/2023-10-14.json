        "title": "Can Ethereum Reach $5,000? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "As equity markets benefit from a bounce-back year in 2023, so too has the crypto market.\n\nEthereum (ETH 5.05%) has climbed almost 30% this year, after it dropped 68% in 2022. But with it still being down significantly from its peak, some enthusiasts are hoping for huge returns in the years ahead.\n\nAs of this writing, Ethereum's price is sitting at about $1,500. For it to reach the $5,000 mark, that would translate to a gain of about 230%. Is this even a possible scenario? Let's take a closer look at this top digital asset.\n\nIt's gotten close\n\nEthereum's all-time high price was about $4,892, which was set in November 2021. At that point, the token's price skyrocketed 153,000% from its initial launch date in mid-2015. Some lucky early adopters got rich.\n\nBut it's worth pointing out that this huge price run-up happened during a major bull market in both the equity markets and the cryptocurrency industry. Monetary policy was still loose after the depths of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nSince then, it's been a difficult ride for investors. Ethereum is currently 68% below its peak price. The so-called \"crypto winter\" was in full effect after a string of companies in the industry failing. Rapidly rising interest rates have also pressured riskier assets.\n\nWhile impossible to predict, investors can't ignore macroeconomic factors. They can both positively and negatively influence Ethereum's price action.\n\nThe bull case\n\nWithout a doubt, Ethereum has huge potential, according to the most supportive bulls.\n\nThanks to the added functionality and programmability of smart contracts, Ethereum is trying to become the world's decentralized computing platform. This blockchain innovation allows for two parties to transact for different use cases without the need for an intermediary. If it gains broader adoption, industries known for having expensive intermediaries are prone to disruption.\n\nSo far, the use cases have included various decentralized applications like financial protocols and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). While activity here has cooled off, developers continue working on trying to make the network better. According to a report by venture firm Electric Capital, Ethereum has 1,901 active developers working on it, significantly more than any other cryptocurrency. This bodes well for its ability to introduce advancements.\n\nSpeaking more to the development aspect, Ethereum's Merge upgrade is what many consider to be a positive step, particularly as it relates to scalability. Ethereum can only process 11 transactions per second, and when demand is high, transaction fees can soar.\n\nThe Merge transitioned Ethereum to a proof-of-stake (PoS) system, which can lower energy expenditures and set it up for further scaling enhancements. Future upgrades could add more capabilities to Ethereum. And in turn, this could drive usage and demand for the token, causing its price to rise.\n\nReasons to avoid Ethereum\n\nAs is the case with any unproven asset or new technology, there is a ton of uncertainty around the ultimate outcome.\n\nWith any cryptocurrency, there's always inherent technical risk. What happens if there's a bug in the software code that exposes private keys? Then everyone's crypto holdings can be stolen.\n\nIn Ethereum's case, its complex development roadmap introduces the possibility of errors to being made. This means its technical risks are even higher compared to a simpler and more straightforward crypto like Bitcoin.\n\nOne of the biggest bear arguments for Ethereum is that it's becoming more centralized, which goes against the entire premise of cryptocurrencies as tools for decentralization and giving power back to the users. The PoS consensus mechanism leads to larger pools of token holders controlling the processing of transactions.\n\nMoreover, a single person, co-founder Vitalik Buterin, has major influence over the direction of Ethereum. He can make decisions to his benefit at the expense of the average Ethereum user. And this can be a detriment to the integrity of the network.\n\nEthereum has promise, but the uncertainty remains sky-high. So I think investors hoping for the token to reach $5,000 should temper expectations. Unless wild enthusiasm takes over the crypto market again, that's a very lofty price target to set your eyes on"

        "content": "The price of Ethereum\u2019s native token, Ether (ETH), is trading around a 15-month low versus Bitcoin (BTC), and the lowest since Ethereum switched to proof-of-stake (PoS).\n\nWill it continue to weaken for the remainder of 2023? Cointelegraph takes a closer look at the charts.\n\nEthereum price breaks below critical support vs. Bitcoin\n\nThe ETH/BTC pair dropped to as low as 0.056 BTC earlier this week. In doing so, the pair broke below its 200-week exponential moving average (200-week EMA; the blue wave) near 0.058 BTC, raising downside risks further into 2023.\n\nThe 200-week EMA has historically served as a reliable support level for ETH/BTC bulls. For instance, the pair rebounded 75% three months after testing the wave support in July 2022. Conversely, it dropped over 25% after losing the same support in October 2020.\n\nETH/BTC weekly price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nETH/BTC stares at similar sell-off risks in 2023 after losing its 200-week EMA as support. In this case, the next downside target looks to be around its 0.5 Fib line near 0.051 BTC in 2023, down about 9.5% from current price levels.\n\nConversely, ETH price may rebound toward its 50-week EMA (the red wave) near 0.065 BTC if it reclaims the 200-week EMA as support.\n\nBitcoin bull case overshadows Ethereum\n\nEthereum\u2019s persistent weakness versus Bitcoin is reflected in institutional capital flow data.\n\nFor instance, as of Oct. 6, Bitcoin-specific investment funds had attracted $246 million year-to-date (YTD), according to CoinShares. On the other hand, Ethereum funds have lost capital, witnessing outflows worth $104 million in the same period.\n\nNet flows into crypto funds (by asset). Source: CoinShares\n\nThe discrepancy is likely due to growing buzz about a potential spot Bitcoin exchange-traded product (ETF) approval in the United States.\n\nTrade pundits argue that a spot Bitcoin ETF launch will attract $600 billion. In addition, Bitcoin\u2019s fourth halving on April 24, 2024, is also acting as a tailwind versus the altcoin market.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin price gets new $25K target as SEC decision day boosts GBTC\n\nThe halving will reduce the Bitcoin miners\u2019 block reward from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC, a bullish case based on historical precedent that cuts new supply in half.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

This will possibly be in parallel with testing efforts on public testnets.\n\ngm, here's my writeup of this week's Ethereum dev call where devs talked about ongoing issues and bugs on Devnet #9 and had a long debate on the merits of EOF.https://t.co/CbYKBaFlmZ \u2014 Christine Kim (@christine_dkim) October 13, 2023\n\nEthereum developers are gearing up for the upcoming release of Devnet #10. According to the article, Devnet #10 might be ready, hopefully next week.\n\nBarnabas Busa, an Ethereum engineer, underlined that developers are still working through \"big questions\" in the process of testing Dencun.\n\nDevelopers may not proceed with the launch of Devnet #10, likely the final devnet for Dencun, before the upgrade is launched on public Ethereum testnets like Goerli, until these questions are answered.\n\nThe forthcoming Devnet #10 will include a large validator set, maybe with 330,000 active validators. Its launch criteria include updated trusted setup files from the EIP 4844 KZG ceremony, improved visibility for blob transactions, the MEV pipeline and network stability.\n\nThe current Devnet #9 has a 93% participation rate, which means that 93% of validators are actively participating in network consensus. The 7% of invalidators that are not operational are mostly Geth (EL) and Teku (CL) validator nodes.\n\nThe Dencun upgrade contains the eagerly awaited Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 4844, often known as proto-danksharding, which seeks to improve scalability and lower transaction costs on Layer 2 rollup solutions like Arbitrum and Optimism."

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nAs bears continue calling the shots in the crypto market, Ethereum (ETH) has not attained significant momentum to exit the $1,500 level.\n\nAs a result, the second-largest cryptocurrency based on market cap finds itself at a crossroads because it\u2019s sitting at a crucial area illustrating a make-or-break scenario.\n\nLeading analyst Ali took to X, formerly Twitter, to explain this development. He stated, \u201cEthereum is moving within a steady range. Interestingly, the TD Sequential presented a buy signal at the lower end of this range, suggesting ETH could rebound to $1,630. But be cautious \u2013 If ETH closes below $1,530, the bullish outlook will be invalidated.\u201d\n\nSource:TradingView/Ali\n\nThe analyst added that $1,530 was a critical demand zone, and Ethereum ought to trade above it to avoid a steep correction.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEthereum was hovering around the $1,550 area at the time of writing, according to CoinGecko. Therefore, ETH continues to maintain a bullish image despite it being on shaky grounds.\n\nEthereum Whales are on a Buying Spree\n\nDespite the downturn being experienced in the market, ETH whales are not relenting in their quest to accumulate more coins.\n\nLeading market insight provider Santiment acknowledged that both the top 10 exchange and non-exchange wallets were getting richer by the day as their spending rate was going through the roof.\n\nSource: Santiment\n\nAccording to Santiment data, the 10 largest non-exchange and exchange addresses hold ETH worth $61.6 billion and $10.9 billion, respectively.\n\nThis suggests that the bearish momentum in the general crypto market is not dampening the spirits of ETH whales as they continue accumulating more coins.\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum is set for massive growth based on a recent analysis by Standard Chartered Bank. The financial giant stipulated that ETH could skyrocket by 5x and hit $8,000 by the end of 2026, as reported by ZyCrypto.\n\nEthereum continues to be king in various crypto sectors, such as decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\n\nTherefore, Standard Chartered believes this, coupled with real-world adoption in areas such as tokenization and gaming, will spur Ethereum demand, which is bullish for ETH price."

This represents a 5% decline over the course of a week that has generally seen negative trends in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nETH last 7 days performance. Source: Finbold.com\n\nThe loss of momentum extends further, as Ethereum\u2019s price has fallen by 8% in the last two weeks and 2% over the past 30 days. However, it\u2019s important to note that despite recent setbacks, the market\u2019s top altcoin has still managed to maintain a year-to-date increase of 29.6%.\n\nEthereum\u2019s situation remains somewhat mixed, but recent overselling may position the asset for a potential rebound in the coming weeks, particularly when considering the fundamental strength of the Ethereum network, and the potential inflow of investors.\n\nIs the bearish trend set to continue?\n\nEthereum\u2019s price has been on a downward trajectory for a couple of months, showing significant weakness in its indicators since mid-August, coinciding with a broader market downturn.\n\nThe relative strength index (RSI) for ETH, represented by the purple line, has dropped from nearly 70 at the beginning of the month to 35 today. Although there has been a slight uptick in the past few hours, it remains weak, indicating that the token is currently oversold.\n\nA similar situation can be observed with ETH\u2019s 30-day exponential moving average (EMA) in yellow, which continues to slide further below its 200-day average (blue). This emphasizes the presence of substantial selling pressure.\n\nOne of the most discouraging signals at present is the decline in the token\u2019s support level, denoted by the green line, over the past few days. This suggests that ETH may struggle to resist further declines in the coming days.\n\nETH last 2 months performance. Source: TradingView\n\nHowever, despite the potential for minor drops in the very near future, the fact that ETH has been heavily sold recently makes it likely that traders will eventually seize the opportunity to purchase the token at an attractive discount.\n\nIn fact, ETH is currently undervalued relative to its underlying fundamentals, making it a favorable time to invest in the cryptocurrency, which is expected to make a full recovery, particularly given its dominant position in the crypto ecosystem.\n\nEthereum maintains a significant share of the Total Value Locked (TVL) in the industry, with its network and major layer-twos like Optimism (OP), Polygon (Matic), Arbitrum (ARB), and Base accounting for approximately 63% of the sector\u2019s total TVL.\n\nEthereum also continues to evolve and expand, as evidenced by the upcoming launch of the Holesky testnet, a development that will contribute to Ethereum\u2019s progress toward the eventual implementation of Proto-Danksharding, which promises significant improvements in scalability.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

Discover SCENE\n\nThis week, observers caught wind of a stark contrast between large holders of the two top cryptocurrencies on the market\u2013highlighting a seemingly opposite sentiment among whales in Bitcoin and Ethereum. According to on-chain analysis firm Glassnode, Ethereum whales that hold 1,000 or more ETH (worth roughly $1.5 million) have been in a sharp downtrend since 2020, with $20 million ETH being sold off.\n\nOn the other hand, Bitcoin whales have been quietly accumulating. Those holding 1,000 or more BTC (roughly $26.9 million) have remained mostly flat over the same time period\u2014albeit with a couple of sharp drops, perhaps due to the FTX collapse or profit-taking after a successful 2021 bull run.\n\nThe apparent disparity in activity by whales led to a flurry of theories shared across social media, with prominent figures in the Bitcoin aisle seizing the chance to fire shots at its Ethereum community counterparts.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSteven Lubka, head of private client services for Bitcoin financial services Swan, told Decrypt that his company has seen a large number of high-net-worth individuals (HNWI) looking to offload their ETH for BTC. He pointed, above all, to the legal concerns surrounding the industry.\n\n\u201cEthereum is under regulatory pressure, whereas Bitcoin is not,\u201d he said.\n\nHis voice resonated with Jesse Shrader, CEO and co-founder of Amboss, a data analytics firm for the Lightning Network.\n\n\u201cBitcoin provides a simple function: better money,\u201d Shrader said. On the other hand, \u201cwhile Ethereum provides a bounty of enthralling complexity, it risks losing the plot to smart contracts and critical hard fork protocol changes.\u201d\n\nBut the Glassnode data, and the conclusions drawn, seem incomplete.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cDoes the chart correctly adjust for staking?\u201d asks Kunal Goel, senior research analyst for Messari. He explained to Decrypt that \u201ctransfers to a staking contract might look like selling on chain but is not really selling at all.\u201d\n\nAt present, staking in the Ethereum network requires users to lock (or pledge) a 32 ETH in a smart contract in order to help the blockchain validate transactions. This appears to be driving the alleged drop in holdings by large entities.\n\nGoel added that although the large difference in dollar amounts between large holders does not disqualify whales from being compared, \u201cthe data needs to be correct.\u201d\n\nAndr\u00e9 Dragosch, head of research for Deutsche Digital Assets (DDA), a crypto asset manager, echoed Goel\u2019s views. He called the ETH whale-selling drama a \u201cnothing burger,\u201d noting that the percentage supply of ETH in smart contracts has been increasing \u201cconcordantly.\u201d\n\nHe highlighted on Twitter that Glassnode does not include Ether tied in smart contracts to the previously mentioned whale supply metric. In fact, Dragosch added, the percentage of ETH supply held by the top 1% of addresses has not declined at all.\n\nThe numbers might seem to say one thing at first glance, but tell a different story: Bitcoin and Ethereum whales continue to be bullish."

        "title": "Ethereum Price Prediction As New Recovery May Emerge From $1500 - CoinGape",
        "content": "The first half of October has been notably bearish for ETH coin, with the price plummeting 12% from a last recorded high of $1,745 down to a local support level of $1,531. Despite this descent, the appearance of a few green candles at this support level suggests that buyers are attempting to rally and set the stage for a potential recovery.\n\nAlso Read: What Should Ethereum Investors Do Amid Bullish Call for $8000 ETH Price?\n\nadvertisement\n\nWill Buyers Regain the $1700 Mark\n\nThe crypto buyers could witness high demand pressure around $1500\n\nThe Ethereum fear and greed index at 41% indicates neutral to bearish sentiment in the market\n\nThe intraday trading volume in Ether is $2.2 Billion, indicating a 34% loss.\n\nSource- Tradingview\n\nThe short-term trend in Ethereum coin price is currently sideways with its price wobbling between two horizontal levels of $1745 to $1530. With the recent downturn in the crypto market, the ETH price has dropped to the bottom support of the aforementioned range.\n\nOn October 13th, the buyers tried to rebound from this support but could not push the price above the $1573 level. Today, with an insignificant intraday loss of 0.05%, the daily candle shows uncertainty among market participants.\n\nTherefore, for traders to gain a better confirmation of a bullish reversal, the price should surpass the October 13th high of $1573. Under the influence of this range pattern formation, this bullish reversal should surge the prices 12.4% higher to rechallenge the $1745 mark.\n\nWill ETH Price Break Below $1500 Mark\n\nWhile the ETH price struggle to bounce back from the $1,530 mark suggests tepid bullish sentiment, a further slip below this support could find immediate support around the $1,500 level, which aligns with a longstanding trendline. This trendline forms the lower boundary of a rising channel pattern that has historically guided this altcoin\u2019s recovery phases for nearly 500 days. Should market participants continue to respect this pattern, the Ethereum coin could find a footing at $1,500, aiming for a more ambitious target above the last significant swing high of $2,138.\n\nRelative Strength Index: Despite the sideways action, the daily RSI slope rising with a pair for new higher highs and lows reflects the buyers. Attempt to regain higher ground.\n\nPivot levels: the traditional pivot level accentuates the $1573 as significant resistance followed by $1630 and $1732."

        "title": "Best Time to Buy Ethereum Could Be Soon: Last Cycle Suggests - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Ethereum has been in a descending channel against Bitcoin since August of last year, meaning Bitcoin has been the better investment over this time. However, historical trends show the tides could be changing soon, with Ethereum possibly on the brink of entering an accumulation phase.\n\nEthereum Price Action\n\nEthereum is trading at $1600, marking a 22% decrease from its price last August. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is 8% up over the same period.\n\nThis is a common trend that happens during bear markets. Coins with larger market capitalizations tend to be more resilient against price decreases as investors become more risk-averse and look to preserve their capital. While Ethereum isn\u2019t short at a market capitalization of $187 billion, it\u2019s still considerably lower than Bitcoin at $525 billion.\n\nDuring bull markets, coins with lower market capitalization outperform Bitcoin again as investors lean towards assets with greater potential returns.\n\nEthereum Price Compared Against Bitcoin\n\nWhen comparing ETH\u2019s value to BTC, it\u2019s evident that Ethereum has been trading within a descending channel since last August. This pattern, characterized by its lower highs and lower lows, often indicates a bearish trend in the market.\n\nETH's valuation against BTC over time. Source: ETHBTC on TradingView\n\nThe chart above highlights three other distinct phases:\n\nAccumulation phase: During this phase, price tends to stabilize, hinting at an upcoming change in momentum\n\nAscending channel: Here, the price experiences a significant reversal, often on a parabolic trajectory, characterized by highs and higher lows.\n\nDistribution phase: In the final phase, the price ceases its upward movement. Investors typically use this phase to capitalize on their gains and liquidate their positions.\n\nThe accumulation phase is typically the best time for investors to convert their Bitcoin into Ethereum. This phase is marked by price holding on at the bottom and then showing signs of reversal. Ethereum is still forming lower lows against Bitcoin, so it has not entered the accumulation phase yet. However, the last cycle shows that this could be changing soon.\n\nLast Cycle\n\nReflecting on the last cycle, Ethereum was in a descending channel against Bitcoin for 17 months. The accumulation phase then occurred from September 2019 up until February 2020. Based on the four-year theory, which suggests similar phases in the market occur every four years, this shows that the accumulation phase should also be approaching very soon in this cycle.\n\nYet, while the last cycle offers valuable insights, it\u2019s important to note that no two cycles are the same. In the current cycle, ETH\u2019s price action has not seen as much of a drop as in the previous cycle, which could be attributed to changing fundamentals and asset maturation.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nWhile an accumulation phase for Ethereum has not been confirmed yet, there remains the potential for its price to drop even further relative to Bitcoin. However, if the previous cycle is anything to go by, we could enter the accumulation phase soon. This phase typically presents prime buying opportunities for Ethereum.\n\nInvestment Disclaimer: The content provided in this article is for informational and educational purposes only.

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s fees have fallen to their lowest level since 2020.\n\nWith growing supply in the past few weeks, Ether is back to being inflationary.\n\nDemand for Ethereum Mainnet [ETH] has been slowing down over the past few months, driving fees to their lowest level since April 2020, on-chain data provider IntoTheBlock noted in a recent post on X (formerly Twitter).\n\nTotal Ethereum fees hit their lowest point since April 2020! This decrease is driven by the migration to layer 2s and the decreasing usage of applications in Mainnet\n\n?https://t.co/XAGjJnXoDD pic.twitter.com/liNkrd1B5r \u2014 IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) October 13, 2023\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nThe data provider further found that during last week\u2019s trading session, the Layer 1 blockchain recorded an average of 1,380 ETH in daily transaction fees. By the end of this weekend, the chain is projected to see only 1,190 ETH in daily average transaction fees, IntoTheBlock added.\n\nThese fees have significantly declined, plummeting by 90% from their peak in May and standing approximately 50% lower than the figures observed in October 2022.\n\nLow demand for NFTs and low DeFi activity\n\nThe steady fall in Ethereum\u2019s fees since May is primarily attributable to the growing disinterest in non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and low activity across the decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols hosted on the blockchain network.\n\nRegarding NFT activity on Ethereum, this has been beaten down by the general decline in market interest in digital collectibles. According to data from CryptoSlam, it recorded a cumulative $1.7 billion in NFT sales volume in the first two months of the year, logging a month-on-month growth of 39% jump between January and February.\n\nHowever, since February, this has trended downwards. With $143.06 million recorded in September, NFT sales volume on the network has plummeted by 85% in the last nine months.\n\nA major indicator of decline in Ethereum\u2019s DeFi vertical is its total value locked (TVL). According to data from DefiLlama, Ethereum\u2019s TVL at press time was $21.54 billion.\n\nAfter rallying to a high of $35 billion in April, the network\u2019s TVL has since declined by 40%. On a year-to-date (YTD), Ethereum\u2019s TVL has fallen by over 15%, and the last time it was spotted at its current level was in January 2021, data from DefiLlama showed.\n\nFurther, assessing the trading volume of the decentralized exchanges (DEXes) housed within Ethereum offered deeper insights into the decline in the chain\u2019s DeFi ecosystem.\n\nAccording to data from Artemis, Ethereum\u2019s DEX trading volume has dwindled since the 11 March peak of $21 billion. With only $840 million recorded in trading volume on 12 October, this has fallen by 96% in just six months.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s ETH\u2019s market cap in BTC terms\n\nETH supply climbs once again\n\nAs a result of the dwindling on-chain activity and declining gas fees, Ethereum\u2019s supply has once again become inflationary. This means that new Ether tokens are being created and added to the circulating supply, which will put downward pressure on the leading altcoin\u2019s price.\n\nAccording to data from Ultrasound.money, ETH\u2019s supply has risen by over 10,000 ETH in the last week alone."

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nThe recent behavior of Ethereum (ETH) on the market and its deflation have gathered the attention of many crypto traders and investors. Since December 2022, the supply of Ether has been on an upward trajectory. Several factors have contributed to this inflationary trend in Ethereum. Notably, the decreased transaction fees, paired with an increased daily issuance, have accelerated the rise in ETH's supply.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe provided graphical representation highlights Ethereum's deflationary trend, juxtaposed with its network activity. An analysis of this chart brings forth some striking revelations. The burn rate is currently at 402K ETH per year, indicating that while transactions are ongoing and fees are being paid, a significant portion of Ether is being destroyed or \"burned\" but it is still not enough.\n\nOn the other hand, the supply growth shows an increase of 0.36% over a 30-day time frame. Moreover, the issuance sits at 834K ETH per year, which underscores the increasing creation of new Ether in the ecosystem.\n\nHowever, even with these factors pushing Ethereum toward an inflationary stance, it is crucial to note that the net issuance for Ethereum stands at a mere 0.44% annually. When juxtaposed with Bitcoin's inflation rate, Ethereum's figure is still considerably lower.\n\nFrom a pricing perspective, Ethereum has recently faced some challenges. The cryptocurrency has seen a retreat below the $1,600 mark, sparking concerns among investors and traders. With the current trajectory, Ethereum's price is inching closer to the critical $1,400 support level, which historically played a pivotal role in March as a point of trend reversal.\n\nFor now, Ethereum's price movement indicates downward pressure. While it is showing some resilience around the $1,575 zone, the continuous testing of this support suggests a potential breakdown. If ETH fails to maintain this stance, the road toward the $1,400 mark might be its next destination."

This puts it above several major global corporations in terms of market capitalization.\n\nEthereum remains above some global giants\n\nEthereum's current market value bests several globally recognized corporations. Thermo Fisher Scientific, a leader in scientific research services, trails just behind Ethereum with a valuation of $186.35 billion.\n\nPetroChina, a major Chinese oil and gas company, stands at $185.28 billion. Linde, a key player in the industrial gases sector, is valued at $184.38 billion. Pfizer, the pharmaceutical titan, holds a value of $181.29 billion.

Following the Shanghai upgrade in April, JPMorgan Chase reported a 12% drop in daily transactions on the Ethereum network, sparking concerns over its dwindling activity. The total value locked on the Ethereum network has also seen an 8% dip. Adding to Ethereum's woes, the debut of multiple Ether futures ETFs in the U.S. garnered lackluster attention, with trading volumes termed as \"shockingly low.\"\n\nHowever, some analysts remain uber-bullish in the long term.

        "title": "ProShares Is Set To Launch Inverse Ethereum Futures ETF - Crypto Times",
        "content": "ETF provider ProShares is poised to further expand its crypto offerings with an inverse Ethereum futures fund.\n\nThe planned ProShares Short Ether Strategy ETF (SETH) aims to gain exposure to potential declines in the Ethereum price.\n\nProShares filed details of the new fund on Friday, just weeks after debuting three long-only Ether Futures ETFs in early October. SETH would trade on NYSE Arca and track the inverse daily performance of the S&P CME Ether Futures Index.\n\nThe fund would allow investors to benefit from downward moves in Ethereum without directly shorting the asset.\n\nAccording to ProShares, they expect the SEC to approve the registration statement on October 15th, with a launch target in early November.\n\nSETH would join the provider\u2019s Bitcoin inverse futures ETF, the Short Bitcoin Strategy fund launched in June 2022.\n\nCurrently, it has attracted around $75 million in assets so far. ProShares\u2019 long Bitcoin futures ETF (BITO) remains the largest, with $850 million in assets under management.\n\nThe pending introduction of an inverse Ether product comes as Ethereum hovers near $1,500, down 6% in the past week. The cryptocurrency had rallied earlier in October on optimism over the SEC\u2019s approval of futures-based ETFs.\n\nOn August 4, ProShares and Bitwise filed an application with the SEC for exchange-traded funds with a focus on bitcoin and ether. After which, ProShares moved quickly with VanEck and Bitwise to offer the first three Ether funds immediately after SEC greenlighting on October 2nd.\n\nThe products open crypto exposure to a broader investor base via the ETF structure\u2019s convenience.\n\nBut the debut of an inverse fund also allows for capitalizing on potential volatility declines or bearish sentiment. ProShares has established itself as a leader in crafting diverse crypto investment vehicles for various market conditions.\n\nThe SEC took over two years to approve Ether Futures ETFs after the historic first Bitcoin fund. How fast the assets can grow remains uncertain amid the crypto market flux. However, tailored options continue to broaden access for investors with differing risk appetites."
