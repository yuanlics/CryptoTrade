        "content": "Ethereum price is slowly moving lower toward the $1,585 support against the US dollar. ETH must clear the $1,650 resistance to start a recovery wave.\n\nEthereum is struggling to stay above the $1,600 support zone.\n\nThe price is trading below $1,650 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere is a major bearish trend line forming with resistance near $1,645 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair could start a fresh increase if it clears the $1,650 and $1,665 resistance levels.\n\nEthereum Price Grinds Lower\n\nEthereum attempted a recovery wave from the $1,630 zone. ETH climbed above the $1,650 resistance level but upsides were limited, like Bitcoin.\n\nThe price struggled to gain pace for a move above the $1,665 resistance level. A high was formed near $1,654 and the price reacted to the downside. It declined below the $1,620 support and even traded close to the $1,600 level. A low is formed near $1,607 and the price is now consolidating losses.\n\nEthereum is now trading below $1,650 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is also a major bearish trend line forming with resistance near $1,645 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.\n\nOn the upside, the price might face resistance near the $1,630 level. It is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $1,654 swing high to the $1,607 low. The next major resistance is $1,650, the trend line, and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThe trend line is close to the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $1,654 swing high to the $1,607 low. A close above the $1,650 resistance might send the price toward the key resistance at $1,665.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nTo start a steady increase, Ether must settle above the $1,650 and $1,665 levels. The next key resistance might be $1,720. Any more gains might open the doors for a move toward $1,750.\n\nMore Losses in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $1,650 resistance, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,610 level. The next key support is $1,600.\n\nThe first major support is now near $1,585. A downside break below the $1,585 support might start another strong decline. In the stated case, the price could decline toward the $1,540 level. Any more losses may perhaps send Ether toward the $1,500 level.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bearish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $1,585\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $1,665\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "Run Ethereum nodes on AWS - AWS Blog",
        "content": "Amazon Managed Blockchain and many partners of AWS offer a convenient way to use Ethereum nodes without operating your own infrastructure. But sometimes, when you want to run archive nodes or participate in Ethereum staking, the managed nodes aren\u2019t enough, and you may choose to run your own Ethereum nodes on AWS.\n\nTo run a self-managed node, you need to configure server-side software components called Ethereum clients. After The Merge, each Ethereum node needs to run two clients: the execution layer (EL) client and the consensus layer (CL) client. These clients work in tandem to synchronize the global state with other nodes of the distributed Ethereum database clusters (usually called blockchain networks) such as mainnet, goerli, and sepolia. When you first install and configure both clients, they won\u2019t contain any data and need to catch up with the current state of the blockchain network managed by the rest of the nodes. This process is called the initial sync, and can take multiple days due to the volume of data that needs to be synchronized.\n\nIn this post, we share our experience with setting up Ethereum nodes on AWS and the ways to speed up the initial sync to quickly bring up new ones when needed.\n\nSpeeding up the initial sync\n\nWhen you start both clients on your new node for Ethereum mainnet, you need to wait for the CL client to get from the genesis block to The Merge transaction before the EL client can start syncing the blocks. Until then, the EL client either idles or downloads only receipts and block headers. This is time consuming and, in our tests, it could take around 4 days for a CL client like Prysm to sync from the genesis block.\n\nTo speed up the process, most CL clients provide checkpoint sync option that makes them only sync from the latest beacon chain checkpoint. The beacon chain introduced the consensus engine (or consensus layer) that replaces proof-of-work mining with proof-of-stake validation. When configuring a checkpoint sync, you have to provide a URL to your trusted checkpoint sync provider. The Ethereum community maintains a list of public endpoints of checkpoint sync providers to choose from. For more information about checkpoint sync, check How To: Checkpoint Sync.\n\nWhen you use checkpoint sync, the CL client syncs the state of the Ethereum beacon chain from the latest checkpoint (which is a block in the first slot of an epoch) and will be fully operational CL client even without syncing all the previous blocks. The process usually completes within minutes, and then the CL client instructs the paired EL client to start synchronizing the blocks for the EL blockchain. CL clients synced from checkpoint are good enough for validators and to kick-start the EL clients, but the CL clients synced from the genesis block also allow to query chain history and state for archive nodes. If you want to use checkpoint sync but need those functions for additional analytics purposes, you can to use a CL client like Lighthouse that support backfill sync of the previous blocks all the way to the genesis and then, optionally, can reconstruct the state as well.\n\nYou can configure EL clients such as Go Ethereum (Geth), Hyperledger Besu, and Nethermind as full nodes to consume less disk space and keep the pruned state only for the most recent 128 blocks. Some EL clients in full node mode also support a quicker sync option called snap sync. It\u2019s about 10 times faster than syncing the state from the Genesis block with full sync. Another node type is archive node, which, in addition to all blocks, builds an archive of historical states to provide richer functionality for historical queries. On the downside, the EL clients configured as archive nodes can\u2019t benefit from snap sync mode and it still takes 5-7 days to sync them. To learn more about node types and sync modes, see Nodes and Clients.\n\nFrom our experience, by using a combination of the checkpoint sync option in the CL client and the snap sync option in EL client, you should be able to shorten the initial sync time for from the initial 5-7 days to about 1 day for full nodes. If you need the richer functionality of the EL client as archive node, you should still use the checkpoint sync option in your CL client to save yourself multiple days of syncing time.\n\nAfter you synchronize your first node, you can use the AWS Cloud to scale those nodes horizontally. For better performance we recommend using a separate Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume to store blockchain data and, when the initial sync is complete, copy that data to Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) bucket. Later, when you bring new nodes online, you can copy blockchain data from S3 bucket and speed up the initial sync time for new nodes to less than an hour. In some situations, though, even the initial sync from the recent data copy can take longer because your node may occasionally get stuck with syncing the delta from a peer node with constrained resources like the network speed or an overloaded CPU. In cases like this, you need to monitor your node for slow sync and restart to force it to connect to other peer nodes.\n\nIt is also possible to use Amazon EBS Snapshots feature instead of copying data to and from S3, but the nodes initialized that way will experience higher I/O latencies for longer periods of time while their EBS snapshots are loaded from S3. In our experiments copying data from S3 with s5cmd tool takes about 36 minutes per 1 TiB while for EBS initialization without Amazon EBS fast snapshot restore feature it might take many hours.\n\nThe approach with keeping your own copy of your client\u2019s blockchain data on AWS works even better for EL clients like Erigon which is operating as archive node and don\u2019t have the snap sync option. It will take several days for such clients to download all necessary data and construct the final state, but after the copy is available, it will take 2 to 3 hours to get the new node up and running.\n\nSolution overview\n\nTo implement the ideas discussed earlier, we set up three instances of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) and use the cost-effective AWS Graviton processor with all clients. Each node has two EBS volumes attached to it: one as the root volume and another to keep the blockchain state data. We\u2019ll call one node a \u201csync node\u201d and dedicate it to synchronizing with the rest of the Ethereum mainnet. The other two nodes are \u201cRPC nodes\u201d, and they provide the RPC API to the user applications (also called decentralized apps or dApps for short). Although functionally the nodes are the same, separating node deployments by roles helps to improve scalability and reliability of the solution.\n\nThe RPC nodes are part of the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling Group (ASG) to quickly provision them from the copy of the sync node\u2019s data. Both of our RPC nodes are behind the Application Load Balancer to manage the load between them. You may also use different Amazon EC2 instance types for the sync node and RPC nodes to achieve better balance between cost and performance. A sync node can be of a smaller instance type, because its sole purpose is to catch up with the chain head. For example, we used AWS Compute Optimizer to assist us in finding the right sizing for the sync node, and found that the r6g.2xlarge EC2 instance type attached by an EBS GP3 volume with 5,700 of provisioned IOPS and 250 Mbps of provisioned throughput is sufficient for a Go Ethereum client with LevelDB as a sync node, but other instance types might work better for other clients. The RPC nodes might require higher specifications for both EC2 instances and EBS volumes and will depend on how often and which APIs are triggered by applications. After initializing from the data copy produced by the sync node, the RPC nodes will keep synchronizing with other nodes in the Ethereum network to serve up-to-date information through their APIs. At the same time, they can be disposed of and replaced by a new instance of an RPC node to scale up, replace faulty nodes, or upgrade client software.\n\nThe following diagram illustrates the deployment architecture.\n\nThe workflow steps are as follows:\n\nAn ongoing data synchronization process is configured with nodes in the Ethereum network with sync node and RPC nodes. The sync node is periodically producing updates to the copy of node\u2019s state data in S3 bucket with s5cmd tool. The key parameters of the blocks syncing progress are sent 5 minutes on automatically created Amazon CloudWatch dashboard for monitoring. When a new RPC node is provisioned, it copies the state data from S3 bucket to speed up the initial sync process. It stays in Pending:Wait state of the Auto Scaling Lifecycle during the data copying process and automatically registers with the Application Load Balancer when ready. Applications and smart contract development tools can now access highly available RPC nodes behind the Application Load Balancer with restricted access.\n\nIf you don\u2019t expect to service a lot of user requests to your nodes, you may instead create only one RPC node in the Auto Scaling group and run your sync node in another Availability Zone as a backup for redundancy.\n\nIn the discussions above we use a popular client combination, Go Ethereum execution client and Lighthouse consensus client, but the same setup can be used with other clients too. With the sample AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) application in the accompanying GitHub repository you can set up multiple other client combinations. And feel free to share your own configurations with pull requests.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn this post, we discussed Ethereum nodes and clients, the initial sync process used by Ethereum nodes, and how to speed it up using checkpoint sync consensus layer clients and snap sync in some execution layer clients. Then we dived deeper into how to use cloud infrastructure to speed up scaling of Ethereum node instances and shorten the initial sync time even further using a copy of the data in S3. Finally, we discussed the step-by-step process of how the solution works. Now you are ready to try out the sample CDK application and deploy the nodes yourself.\n\nAbout the Authors\n\nNikolay Vlasov is a Senior Solutions Architect with the AWS Worldwide Specialist Solutions Architect organization, focused on blockchain-related workloads.

One of the major contributors to this increase in staking was the advent of liquid staking providers.\n\nThese protocols \u201cmade staking accessible to common investors by overcoming barriers such as the high staking requirement of 32 Ether, technical complexities and the illiquidity of the staked Ether,\u201d JPMorgan said.\n\nLiquid staking gives investors access to their staked funds, which would otherwise be locked, in the form of liquidity tokens, like Lido\u2019s stETH. These tokens can also be used for restaking on DeFi platforms.\n\nStay ahead of the game with our weekly newsletters Subscribe\n\nInvestors typically use liquid staking tokens for lending, borrowing, and yield farming, according to JPMorgan. This generates more yield \u2014 which is highly desirable since yields on Ethereum have fallen from earlier this year.\n\nIn search of yield\n\nStandard staking yields on Ethereum, excluding fees and other rewards, have declined to 3.5% from over 4.3% before the Shanghai upgrade in April.\n\nAdditional rewards, which include fees and maximal extractible value, appear to have declined due to lower activity on the Ethereum network, JPMorgan said, down from 3% in April to 2% more recently.\n\n\u201cAs a result, the total staking yield has declined from 7.3% before the Shanghai upgrade to around 5.5% currently,\u201d JPMorgan concluded.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nWith Ethereum yields falling against the backdrop of rising yields in traditional finance, liquid staking offers an exciting prospect, namely through restaking.\n\nRestaking is a blockchain feature that allows users to double-stake their Ether on different protocols, or even chains. It went live on Ethereum in June, through US-based firm EigenLayer, which raised $50 million in a Series A round in March.\n\nThe new feature poses a valuable opportunity for investors. It\u2019s not risk-free, though, as JP Morgan and others have pointed out.\n\nRestaking could result in a \u201ccascade of liquidations if a staked asset drops sharply in value,\u201d JPMorgan said, or if that staked asset is \u201chacked or slashed due to a malicious attack or a protocol error.\u201d\n\nIn May, Ethereum\u2019s co-founder Vitalik Buterin raised concerns about \u201coverloading\u201d the network with complex and poorly-designed restaking models, and now analysts have shared their own warning.\n\n\u201cLike AI, restaking has the potential to unlock awesome services and reshape the ecosystem. Also like AI, restaking likely introduces systemic risks that are hard yet essential to tackle,\u201d Justin Drake, a researcher at Ethereum Foundation, told DL News in May.\n\nEigenLayer\u2019s founder Sreeram Kannan told DL News that he \u201cfully agrees\u201d with Drake\u2019s point and said he\u2019s \u201cglad Vitalik is urging caution in restaking protocols so that the low-risk use cases are cultivated without going over to the high-risk ones.\u201d\n\nFor now, EigenLayer is the only option for investors that want to restake their funds. The total value locked \u2014 a metric that tracks how much crypto is locked up in a DeFi protocol\u2019s smart contracts \u2014 on EigenLayer is around $226 million, according to DeFiLlama data.\n\nAdam Morgan McCarthy is DL News\u2019 London-based Markets Correspondent.

        "title": "JPMorgan Pins Ethereum's Centralization Issues on Lido as the 'Single Point of Failure' - CCN.com",
        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nAccording to JPMorgan, the recent growth in ETH staking has led to higher centralization.\n\nLido is considered a better alternative to centralized staking platforms, but concerns about its centralization persist.\n\nCentralization risks in Ethereum, including concentrated liquidity providers, could threaten the network\u2019s integrity.\n\nThe Merge upgrade was a significant step forward for the Ethereum network. This update occurred in mid-September 2022, signifying the network\u2019s transfer from the Proof of Work consensus process to the Proof of Stake consensus mechanism.\n\nSince then, the ship has been sailing smoothly, and its energy usage has fallen by 99%. However, according to JPMorgan analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, the network has become more centralized since the overhaul.\n\n\u201cThe rise in Ethereum staking since the Merge and Shanghai upgrades has come at a cost as the Ethereum network became more centralized and the overall staking yield declined,\u201d the report said.\n\nAccording to JPMorgan, the primary contributors to staking growth are liquid staking providers. The company says the top five liquid staking providers control more than half of the staking on the Ethereum network. In reality, Lido accounts for over one-third of the total.\n\nThe ETH \u2018Yield\u2019 Appeal Has Been Ruined\n\nMany members of the crypto community believe that Lido, a decentralized liquid staking platform, is a better alternative to the centralized liquid staking platform.\n\nAnalysts, on the other hand, claimed that Lido and other such decentralized solutions \u201cinvolve a high degree of centralization.\u201d Nonetheless, Lido has been adding additional node operators to solve this specific difficulty.\n\nJPMorgan asserted that centralization by any entity or protocol poses risks to the Ethereum network because a concentrated group of liquidity providers or node operators could act as a single point of failure, be attacked, or collaborate to form an oligopoly that would advance their interests at the expense of the community\u2019s interests. For example, a controlling entity could censor specific transactions or front-run end users\u2019 transactions.\n\nAnother risk associated with the emergence of liquid staking, according to JPMorgan, is rehypothecation. This entails using liquidity tokens as collateral across multiple DeFi protocols simultaneously.\n\n\u201cRehypothecation could then result in a cascade of liquidations if a staked asset drops sharply in value or is hacked or slashed due to malicious attack or a protocol error,\u201d the company said .\n\nFurthermore, the increase in staking has harmed ETH\u2019s appeal from a \u201cyield perspective.\u201d The total staking yield has fallen from 7.3% before Shanghai to 5.5% now. The paper emphasized that the outlook is more grim in the face of rising yields on traditional financial assets.\n\nChallenging Centralization in Ethereum Staking\n\nIn the world of Ethereum staking, there are different approaches. The simplest is \u201chome staking,\u201d where you manage assets using a small, energy-efficient PC with Ethereum software. However, some people prefer not to do this for various reasons.\n\nOne group lacks the technical skills or time to set up the required PC, while another group seeks higher returns and is willing to take more risks than the 3% to 6% dividend from staking. These two groups entrust their staking tokens to a third party to manage on their behalf. They provide a service and take a portion of the rewards in return.\n\nThird-party staking providers have pros and cons. They make staking more accessible but also introduce issues, acting like middlemen, which goes against the decentralized nature of crypto.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Shanghai hard fork allowed long-term stakers to withdraw, causing a rush into staking. Many people are joining, but few are leaving, which can risk network stability and centralization. This has led to a negative perception of third-party providers, with Lido being a prominent one.\n\nLido\u2019s actions pose a risk to Ethereum\u2019s core principle of decentralization. To address this issue, Ethereum researchers need more time to find solutions. They are working with top tech experts to tackle the centralization challenge and develop ways to mitigate it."

        "content": "Sun\u2019s actions have raised eyebrows as he has withdrawn millions from Lido Finance without selling.\n\nA mysterious connection has emerged as another entity has swiftly reshuffled ETH assets on Huobi.\n\nButerin, in contrast, has opted for smaller transfers, maintaining an air of enigma.\n\nIn a startling twist of events, two prominent figures in the blockchain space, TRON founder Justin Sun and Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, have recently made headlines by orchestrating Ethereum (ETH) transfers from their well-known digital wallets.\n\nJustin Sun Withdraws $37.7M in Ethereum from Lido Finance\n\nJustin Sun initiated a substantial withdrawal from Lido Finance, totaling 23,000 ETH, equivalent to a staggering $37.7 million. The entirety of this significant sum was then transferred to a new destination, identified as address 0x454. Remarkably, despite this sizable transaction, Sun chose not to liquidate his ETH holdings.\n\nIntriguingly, another address associated with HTX (Huobi) conducted a withdrawal of 42,999 ETH from Binance shortly after Sun\u2019s ETH deposit into Binance, subsequently reallocating these assets to Lido for staking purposes.\n\nThis recent development marks another instance of Justin Sun\u2019s impactful financial maneuvers. Two days prior, on October 5, Sun withdrew another substantial tranche of 19,000 ETH, totaling $32.8 million, from Lido Finance, subsequently depositing these funds into Binance.\n\nButerin\u2019s Modest $1.64M Transfer Amid Crypto Cleaning\n\nBefore these actions, Sun had made a notable deposit of 5,000 ETH, equivalent to $9.2 million, into Huobi at an ETH price of $1,841 on August 12, 2023, just before the cryptocurrency market experienced a decline, resulting in ETH prices plummeting by more than 14%.\n\nIn contrast, Vitalik Buterin executed a comparatively modest transfer involving 1,000 ETH with a value of $1.64 million, directed towards address 0x556 on the same day. It\u2019s worth highlighting that Buterin has consistently deposited a cumulative total of 2.6 thousand ETH, equivalent to $4.2 million, into Bitstamp and Paxos through this specific address since September 17.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nJustin Sun\u2019s repeated withdrawals and deposits of significant amounts of ETH may be part of a strategic move to capitalize on market fluctuations.\n\nWith notable amounts of ETH being moved by both Sun and Buterin, there\u2019s potential for these actions to affect Ethereum\u2019s price dynamics.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nThese high-profile Ethereum transactions, involving influential figures like Justin Sun and Vitalik Buterin, underscore the dynamic nature of crypto. They shed light on the strategic moves of key players within the industry, potentially influencing market sentiment and investor behavior.\n\nTo learn more about Ether ETFs and their potential impact on institutional crypto adoption, read here:\n\nAre Ether ETFs Initiating an Institutional Surge in Crypto?\n\n\n\nAre you curious about the recent challenges facing the ETH burn mechanism amidst growing interest?

        "content": "The price of Ethereum\u2019s native token, Ether (ETH), has gained around 35% in 2023 so far. But its attempts to break above $2,000, a psychological resistance level, have witnessed strong bearish rejections multiple times.\n\nETH/USD daily price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nCointelegraph takes a closer look at the three likely reasons why Ethereum price has failed to decisively retake $2,000 since May 2022.\n\nEthereum price paints bear cycle fractal\n\nEthereum\u2019s inability to cross above $2,000 in 2023 resembles the bearish rejection near $425 from 2018 to 2019.\n\nETH/USD weekly price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nIn both cases, Ether appears to be in a recovery phase while eying close above its 0.236 Fib line of the Fibonacci retracement graph.\n\nFrom 2018 to 2019, the 0.236 Fib line was near $425 and was instrumental in limiting Ether\u2019s recovery attempts. In 2023, the same line is near $2,000, enforcing itself again as a selling area and, thus, pressuring ETH\u2019s price lower.\n\nStronger U.S. dollar, Bitcoin\n\nA strengthening United States dollar has dampened demand for Ethereum in recent months, thus reducing its ability to close decisively above $2,000.\n\nThe prevailing negative correlation between top cryptocurrencies and the dollar has been the main culprit. In 2023, in particular, the weekly correlation coefficient between Ether and the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) has been consistently negative, as shown below.\n\nETH/USD and DXY weekly correlation coefficient chart. Source: TradingView\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum has largely underperformed Bitcoin in 2023 due to the ongoing spot Bitcoin ETF hype. For instance, the widely-tracked ETH/BTC pair is down 20% year-to-date.\n\nETH/BTC daily price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nAdditionally, the net capital held by Ethereum-tied investment funds has dropped by $114 million so far in 2023, according to CoinShares\u2019 weekly report.

That underscores a reduced availability of funds, resulting in lower yields for investors, as JP Morgan analysts also warned recently.\n\nEthereum TVL since 2019. Source: Defi Llama\n\nThe declining TVL has accompanied a drop in the Ethereum network\u2019s gas fees, which reached a yearly low on Oct. 5.\n\n#Ethereum's network has been particularly cheap to use, and this week's average fee level of $1.13 is the lowest since November, 2022.

In this case, ETH\u2019s price can drop to $1,465 and $1,560 in October 2023, depending on the breakdown point.\n\nETH/USD daily price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nIn the short term, a break above the 50-day EMA could have ETH\u2019s price rise toward the triangle\u2019s upper trendline near $1,730 in October 2023, coinciding with the 200-day EMA (the blue wave).\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Ethereum allows developers to create smart contracts, which are self-executing agreements that run on the blockchain. Smart contracts can enable a variety of use cases, such as decentralized finance, gaming, identity management, and more. But what makes Ethereum so powerful and unique? And what are the risks and challenges that it faces? In this article, we will explore the potential and the pitfalls of Ethereum, and why it is more than just a digital currency.\n\nWhat is Ethereum?\n\nEthereum is a decentralized, open-source blockchain that supports smart contract functionality. It was launched in 2015 by Vitalik Buterin, a young programmer who envisioned a platform that could go beyond the limitations of Bitcoin. Unlike Bitcoin, which is mainly designed for peer-to-peer payments, Ethereum allows developers to build and deploy any kind of application that can run on the blockchain. These applications are called decentralized applications, or DApps.\n\nDApps are powered by smart contracts, which are pieces of code that define the rules and logic of the application. Smart contracts are stored and executed on the Ethereum network, which consists of thousands of nodes (computers) that validate transactions and maintain consensus. By using smart contracts, DApps can operate without intermediaries, censorship, or downtime. This makes them more transparent, efficient, and secure than traditional applications.\n\nSome examples of DApps that run on Ethereum are:"

Their stable values suggest cryptocurrencies are less reactive to the current news cycle than they were during its heady 2021 bull run and subsequent 2022 crash.\n\nMarket leader Bitcoin (BTC) grew a modest 2.7% over the seven days and now changes hands at $27,952. It briefly hit a two-month high on Sunday night when it crossed the $28,000 threshold.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe closest contender Ethereum (ETH) had a comparably harder week and lost 2.1% to trade at $1,636 at the time of writing. Its weak performance comes despite several positive announcements, including a UBS asset tokenization trial supported by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and the launch of nine Ethereum Futures ETFs in the U.S. on Monday.\n\nGrayscale announced on Monday that it hopes to convert its Ethereum trust into a spot ETF. The crypto asset manager\u2019s application stems from its courtroom victory back in August when it won an appeal against the Securities and Exchange Commission after the latter rejected its application to convert its Bitcoin trust into a spot ETF.\n\nThe SEC also lost an appeal in its lawsuit against XRP progenitor Ripple this week. The SEC had hoped in vain that Judge Torres would reconsider her ruling that selling XRP to retail consumers doesn\u2019t constitute a breach of American securities laws.\n\nRipple also secured a Major Payments Institution license from the MAS this week. However, the good news gains were reversed by the weekend. XRP fell 1.6% over the last seven days to hit $0.5224 by the weekend.\n\nOnly two cryptocurrencies posted any notable price movements, rallying around 15% this week: Avalanche (AVAX), which currently trades for $10.39, and Solana (SOL), which is currently worth $23.31.\n\nOn Monday, the Solana network's total value locked (TVL) hit a new 2023 high of $338.82 million.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn the news\u2026\n\nThe week began with Coinbase secured a Major Payment Institution (MPI) license from MAS. This development follows the In-Principle Approval (IPA) Coinbase received last year, part of a drive by the exchange to expand globally due to the uncertain regulatory climate on the company\u2019s U.S. home turf.\n\nOn Tuesday, Helen Boyd, Head of Capital Markets at the independent regulatory watchdog the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), announced that the British Treasury hopes to launch a Digital Securities Sandbox (DSS) by the end of the first quarter of next year.\n\nA sandbox is a controlled test environment for those looking to bring innovative products to the market. The FCA already has a similar engagement via its Regulatory Sandbox where companies with viable products can begin pitching them to a closed circle of early customers, but the DSS has \u201ca new rule set that would allow it to do new things with digital securities.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, Hong Kong\u2019s police force and Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) launched a joint task force to monitor illegal activities on crypto exchanges following the suspension of trading on the JPEX exchange. The JPEX incident is one of the largest cases of financial fraud in Hong Kong history. involving at least 2,305 victims of the incident, who collectively have been defrauded of HK$1.43 billion ($182.9 million).\n\nA report published this week by blockchain data platform Chainalysis shows that recent inflows to Hong Kong have rivaled that of mainland China over the past year, despite hosting only 0.5% of the latter\u2019s population.\n\nFinally this week, both Starbucks and the Museum of Modern Art launched NFTs."

        "content": "Binance, the leading crypto exchange platform, recently released its eleventh proof-of-reserve (POR) report detailing its holdings of users\u2019 cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe exchange holds 385 digital assets, including XRP, Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Shiba Inu, and other notable cryptocurrencies.\n\nBinance XRP Holdings\n\nAs per the official report, Binance claims to safeguard its customers\u2019 XRP tokens at a one-to-one ratio. Specifically, the ratio of XRP in users\u2019 net balances compared to Binance\u2019s net holdings stands at 104.15%.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nIn other words, XRP investors have entrusted 2,629,459,187 XRP tokens to Binance, while the exchange holds 2,738,661,519 XRP. Based on XRP\u2019s market price, the figures translate to Binance holding over $1.43 billion XRP in relation to users\u2019 deposits of $1.37 billion XRP.\n\nNotably, Binance\u2019s XRP in this eleventh report indicated a slight increase compared to the tenth series report. In September, The Crypto Basic disclosed that Binance XRP was at 103.82%. Compared to the current 104.15%, it implies that XRP on the exchange grew by at least 52 million.\n\nAlso, Binance\u2019s August report indicated it held 2.8 billion XRP, valued at approximately $1.75 billion, since XRP traded above $0.6 during the period. Interestingly, Binance has maintained a consistent XRP holding of over 2.5 billion XRP since it began publishing the POR reports.\n\nBitcoin Portfolio\n\nLike XRP, Binance POR suggested it holds the largest market cap, crypto Bitcoin, in a 104.67% ratio to customers\u2019 deposits. In particular, the exchange keeps 616,394 BTC worth over $17 billion against users\u2019 deposits of 588,879 BTC.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nWhile users\u2019 assets increased by 708 BTC since September, Binance\u2019s overall Bitcoin holding dropped by 1,732 BTC or $48,068,299\n\nEthereum Portfolio\n\nOn the other hand, Binance\u2019s ratio of Ethereum portfolio to customer deposits increased by over 2% in the past 30 days. The exchange holds over 4.109 million ETH worth $6.73 billion. In contrast, customers have deposited 3.83 Ether tokens worth $6.27 billion.\n\nNotably, the exchange\u2019s Ethereum holding improved by 17,186 ETH since the last report.\n\nShiba Inu Portfolio\n\nMeanwhile, Binance\u2019s eleventh POR report shows a reduction in its trillion units holding of the dog-themed sensational crypto Shiba Inu. According to the report, Binance\u2019s Shiba Inu holding stands at 76,895,594,975,813 (76.8 trillion) against 74,623,682,522,683 (74.6 trillion) from customers.\n\nHowever, The Crypto Basic reported that Binance held 75,476,904,308,962 SHIB for users in September. The reduction signifies Shiba Inu enthusiasts have withdrawn 853,221,786,279 (853 billion) SHIB off the exchange in the past 30 days.\n\nLitecoin and MATIC Portfolios\n\nOn the other hand, Binance\u2019s portfolio of Polygon (MATIC) tokens to customers\u2019 net balances dipped more than 2.5% from 119.86% to 117.16%. Meanwhile, the eleventh POR indicated the exchange\u2019s Litecoin (LTC) portfolio improved by 1% since the last report.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that no external auditor has independently verified Binance\u2019s proof-of-reserve. Emphatically, the exchange clearly stated that the POR reports result from \u201cself-verification.\u201d"

        "content": "The rise of Ethereum staking since major network upgrades, the Merge and Shanghai, has come at the cost of higher centralization and lower staking yields, a new report by JPMorgan said.\n\nJPMorgan analysts, led by senior managing director Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, issued a new investor note on Oct. 5, warning about the risks stemming from Ethereum\u2019s growing centralization.\n\nMarket share of top five liquid staking providers. Source: JPMorgan\n\nThe top five liquid staking providers: Lido, Coinbase, Figment, Binance and Kraken, control over 50% of staking on the Ethereum network, JPMorgan analysts noted in the report, adding that Lido alone accounts for almost one-third.\n\nThe analysts mentioned that the crypto community has seen the decentralized liquid staking platform Lido as a better alternative to centralized staking platforms associated with centralized exchanges like Coinbase or Binance. However, in practice, \u201ceven decentralized liquid staking platforms involve a high degree of centralization,\u201d JPMorgan\u2019s report said, adding that a single Lido node operator accounts for more than 7,000 validator sets or 230,000 Ether (ETH).\n\nThese node operators get selected by Lido\u2019s decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), which is controlled by a few wallet addresses, \u201cmaking Lido\u2019s platform rather centralized in its decision making,\u201d the analysts wrote. The report mentioned a case when Lido\u2019s DAO rejected a proposal to cap the staking share at 22% of Ethereum\u2019s overall staking to avoid centralization.\n\n\u201cLido didn\u2019t participate in the initiatives as its DAO rejected the proposal by an overwhelming majority of 99%,\u201d JPMorgan analysts wrote, adding:\n\n\u201cNeedless to say that centralization by any entity or protocol creates risks to the Ethereum network as a concentrated number of liquidity providers or node operators could act as a single point of failure or become targets for attacks or collude to create an oligopoly [...]\u201d\n\nApart from higher centralization, post-Merge Ethereum is also associated with an overall staking yield decline, JPMorgan noted. The standard block rewards declined from 4.3% before the Shanghai upgrade to 3.5% currently, the analysts wrote. The total staking yield has declined from 7.3% before the Shanghai upgrade to around 5.5% currently, the report added.\n\nRelated: Time to \u2018pull the brakes\u2019 on Ethereum and rotate back to Bitcoin: K33 report\n\nJPMorgan analysts aren\u2019t the only Ethereum observers who have noticed a significant increase in network centralization following the Merge upgrade. Executed on Sept. 15, 2022, the Merge has been seen as a major impediment to Ethereum\u2019s decentralization and a major reason for dropping yields.\n\nyou are the yield pic.twitter.com/ONJT6QmDch \u2014 Pledditor (@Pledditor) October 5, 2023\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has admitted that node centralization is one of Ethereum\u2019s main challenges.

        "title": "Ethereum Network 'Remains the Place to Operate as a Criminal,' Immunefi CEO Says - CoinDesk",
        "content": "A new report found that more than a billion dollars was lost in crypto this year and more than 600 million lost last quarter. Joining us now to unpack the findings is immun five, founder and Ceo Mitchell Amador. Welcome to the show. Mitchell. Thank you very much. Great to be here. Great to have you. Well, immun Phi has put together this report for Q three, unpacking some pretty large losses. Talk to us about what's driving these big numbers over $600 million lost in Q three. Sure. Sure. So there are two major factors that are driving us the first one and arguably the more concerning is the significant increase in the total number of successful hacks. So this is more than a doubling from the previous quarter at 75 versus 30. The second major factor and making up about 50%. Almost 50% of all the losses over the last quarter were two specific hacks which were the Mixon and the multi chain events. And what you can see here just from that is that there's an extreme Power Law distribution in terms of the level of impact, in terms of the level of loss that occurs as a result of hacks. That is what's driving these losses as a whole. So is sorry, Laura, it's going to go crazy. Is hacking getting easier because more vulnerabilities are introduced into these ecosystems or are hackers getting more sophisticated? That's a difficult question because we have to know who these secret shadowy operators are and what exactly they're doing. Uh But I can tell you on the inside of the good guys, right, in the security industry and our work every day to protect the industry that things are getting much better. Our technology has improved leaps and bounds, the number of participants and the number of companies contributing effective technical solutions has improved. So I don't think it's the and, and I should say, you know, to the point of more vulnerabilities getting introduced the average security bar, the standard for work has improved very significantly, right? So, you know, your investors will not let you launch in YOLO contracts in the way that they might have during defi summer, for example. So I don't think it's more vulnerabilities of being introduced. I do suspect, although it's hard to know that is that our adversaries, if you will, the Attackers and the thieves that plague our industry have become more sophisticated, have increased with in number and have invested more in this as a potential uh channel for their own profits and revenue. Unfortunately, now as far as the scams go how uh how are you defining scams in, in this case? And have they changed in nature at all? I think, you know, here we did a very tight definition of scams because hackers is more of our particular interest in looking into the technical side of things. So uh the, the, the fraud definitions and only like really strongly confirmed cases where we know that to be the case when in fact, if, if you wanna, you, let's just say a be a little bit more liberal with the definitions, I imagine we'd see the numbers be quite a bit larger than our initial investigation. However, it does indicate the broader trend that overall kind of fraudulent activity seems to not be growing in the same way that hacks are. And uh this makes sense, although I suppose I should wait to see if that's of interest to you. Uh Yeah, I, I, you know, I guess, I guess my question is, are, are, are these, uh, you know, spam emails sent to grandma saying, you know, here's your chance to invest in, in Bitcoin and, or, or like, you know, I don't know, Steven Segal coin, whatever it is that that's going on here or is it more of, uh, you know what, uh I guess my question is, what's the nature of those kind of scams? Sure. The really obvious ones are naked rug pulls, right? And for all of our uh viewers who don't understand what that is a rug pull is when someone creates a project and then steals all the money by uh draining, you know, either the project funds or by selling all the tokens that they might have created in mass. Hence pulling out the rug from under everybody else at, at their expense. So that is the the kind of uh very poignant example. There are other types of fraud that are much harder to understand in terms of their scope such as pig butchering, which you might be familiar of or such as fishing and spear fishing or steam swapping that you might be familiar of. But as that activity is much more shadowy, it's, it's extremely difficult to get any read on the magnitude of it. Now, the report said that 70% of successful exploits took place in D I and then just under 30% in CP I, um my first question here on this stat is what chain saw the most losses. Oh, that would be the Ethereum Chain, unfortunately. All right. And why, why do you think that is? Well, I'm afraid the reason is not exciting. It's because all the money is on Ethereum. Ethereum remains the predominant solution for or, you know, just the center of DFI activity as a whole. It remains the place where you have the strongest. Um How do we say it uh Sovereignty assurances? So there's no chance that anybody's gonna be rolling back Ethereum or doing funny business. If you steal something there, you're in the clear. So, you know, for many that's also connected to a lot of the, the major privacy cha uh chains and major Privacy tech that's available if you want to launder your assets. So there's a lot of reasons why Ethereum remains the place to operate as a criminal. Unfortunately. Uh, it, it, now that we're seeing kind of a softness in volumes in crypto, do you think that we'll see a softness in volumes of scams and rug poles and all that stuff? It has, has the, the wind that's gone out of the sales of, of legitimate trading also gone out of the sales of, of uh theft. That's a, that's a complicated question. The answer is, it depends what you look at. Right. My sentiment based on our analysis is that it looks like the fraudulent activity is not growing in the same way. So, you know, crypto is less hot, there's less money in it, more and more of the people participating in the space are hardened. It's less of a juicy target for scammers, you know, and, and the kind of scammer industry tends to go where things are hot where the opportunity is. So you have that side of things and I think that's for the better. Sure. A I it also depends on what country it could be, any number of things. Uh Let's hope they remain far away for as long as possible. But I don't think they will. Now, the hack side is the opposite. Right. When you make an investment into being a advanced, persistent threat, right? A, a professional hacking group for some nation state or as a private business as there are many of those as well. When you make that investment, you can't easily repurpose it. But so after you hire a bunch of, you know, hacker types and set up your organization and start cracking on things you have to stay committed. Because if you don't, then your team falls apart and all your investment is lost. Consequently, the hacking side of things, we should not expect that to slow down in any shape, right? We should expect that to continue to increase. And I think that's what this last quarter is showing in terms of the very material increase in the frequency of successful hacking attempts. Mitchell, thanks so much for joining us this morning. It was a pleasure."

He has also interviewed a few prominent experts within the cryptocurrency space.\n\nAshley Prosper, an XRP community member, highlighted factors from the SEC vs. Ripple lawsuit that might affect Ethereum.\n\nThe Ripple lawsuit emphasized the nature of XRP\u2019s blind sales and lack of buyer knowledge.\n\nRipple\u2019s programmatic sales were less than 1% of global XRP trading.\n\nDiscussions around Ethereum\u2019s early sales are growing, with concerns about concealed major investments.\n\nEthereum\u2019s early sales are making waves in the cryptocurrency community, drawing insights from recent SEC vs. Ripple lawsuit developments. Ashley Prosper, a prominent member of the XRP community, has shed light on five elements derived from the Ripple lawsuit, suggesting potential repercussions for Ethereum should the SEC decide to delve deeper into its past ICO dealings.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Spotlight: Ripple\u2019s Court Insights\n\nThe court\u2019s findings in the Ripple lawsuit emphasized several critical factors regarding Ripple\u2019s programmatic sales of XRP:\n\nThe nature of these sales was likened to blind bid/ask transactions, with buyers unaware if their funds were directed to the blockchain firm.\n\nSuch sales accounted for a mere sliver, less than 1%, of the global XRP trading activity.\n\nRipple, during these transactions, did not make any commitments or offers, primarily because the company lacked knowledge of the identities of those buying XRP on exchanges.\n\nA significant number of these buyers remained oblivious to Ripple\u2019s very existence.\n\nThese XRP sales didn\u2019t follow any contracts with clauses like lockup provisions or explicit statements of purpose.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Sales: A Subject of Contention\n\nAdding fuel to the Ethereum sales discourse was former Ethereum adviser Steven Nerayoff. He presented the inherent difficulty in pinpointing the exact number of Ethereum ICO buyers. His insights stirred debates and led to suspicions that some major players, or \u201cwhales\u201d, could be concealing their Ethereum positions.\n\nThe juxtaposition of the Ripple lawsuit\u2019s findings with Ethereum\u2019s historical sales opens a Pandora\u2019s box of questions and potential regulatory scrutiny. Should the SEC choose to probe Ethereum\u2019s past based on these Ripple precedents, Ethereum might find itself in a regulatory maze, raising concerns for its investors and stakeholders in the crypto industry."

        "title": "Demystifying Ethereum Gas Fees: A Comprehensive Guide - Altcoin Buzz",
        "content": "As the popularity of Ethereum has grown, so has the prominence of Ethereum gas fees. These fees play a crucial role in the Ethereum ecosystem, affecting transaction speed and cost.\n\nIn this comprehensive guide, we will delve into what Ethereum gas fees are, and how they work. Also, the factors influencing their fluctuations, and provide a historical perspective by showcasing the all-time highs and lows of gas fees.\n\nUnderstanding Ethereum Gas Fees\n\nEthereum gas fees are the costs associated with executing transactions and smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. These fees serve multiple purposes within the network:\n\nIncentivizing Miners: Ethereum operates on a proof-of-work consensus mechanism, which relies on miners to validate and add transactions to the blockchain. Gas fees serve as incentives for miners to prioritize and process transactions promptly. Resource Allocation: Gas fees are a mechanism for allocating computational resources on the network. They ensure that users pay for the computational power and storage space their transactions consume. Spam Prevention: By attaching a cost to transactions, Ethereum prevents spam attacks and ensures that the network\u2019s resources are utilized efficiently.\n\n\u26fd GAS FEES: EXPLAINED Do you know what #Ethereum Gas fees are and why they exist? Learn more in this thread \ud83e\uddf5\ud83d\udc47 pic.twitter.com/hJIvdOFxIm \u2014 CoinPayments (@CoinPaymentsNET) April 26, 2023\n\nHow Ethereum Gas Fees Work\n\nEthereum gas fees are denominated in a unit called \u201cGas,\u201d which measures the computational work required to execute a transaction or contract. The total cost of a transaction is calculated by multiplying the Gas price (denominated in Ether) by the amount of Gas used. Here is the formula:\n\nTransaction Cost (in Ether) = Gas Price (in Ether per Gas) \u00d7 Gas Used\n\nGas Price: Users specify the Gas price they are willing to pay for their transactions. Miners tend to prioritize transactions with higher Gas prices since they offer more significant rewards. Therefore, users can influence the speed of their transactions by setting higher Gas prices.\n\nGas Used: This represents the total computational work required to process the transaction. More complex transactions or smart contracts consume more Gas.\n\nFactors Influencing Ethereum Gas Fees\n\nSeveral factors contribute to the fluctuation of Ethereum gas fees, making them variable over time:\n\nNetwork Congestion: High demand for Ethereum\u2019s services can lead to congestion on the network, causing an increase in Gas fees. During periods of heavy usage, such as ICOs or DeFi yield farming frenzies, Gas fees tend to surge. Gas Price Auction: Ethereum uses an auction system to determine which transactions get processed first. Users compete by setting higher Gas prices to have their transactions prioritized, especially when the network is congested. Smart Contract Complexity: The computational complexity of executing a smart contract directly impacts the Gas required and, consequently, the Gas fees. Complex smart contracts consume more Gas, leading to higher fees. Ethereum Upgrades: Ethereum has undergone several upgrades, such as Ethereum 2.0\u2019s transition to proof-of-stake. These upgrades aim to improve scalability and reduce fees, but their impact may not be immediately apparent. Market Speculation: Traders and investors sometimes speculate on Ethereum\u2019s Gas fees, leading to sudden and unpredictable price spikes.\n\nHistorical Perspective: All-Time Highs and Lows\n\nUnderstanding the historical evolution of Ethereum gas fees provides valuable insights into their volatility and growth. Here\u2019s a timeline of the all-time highs and lows:\n\nAll-Time High (February 23, 2021): During the height of the DeFi boom and NFT craze, Ethereum gas fees reached an astronomical level. The average Gas price surged to over 1,400 Gwei (Giga-wei), equivalent to approximately 0.04 Ether per transaction. This was a challenging period for regular Ethereum users as transaction costs became prohibitively expensive.\n\nAll-Time Low (Pre-2015): In the early days of Ethereum, Gas fees were almost negligible, as the network had relatively low usage. It was possible to send transactions with fees as low as a fraction of a cent in Ether. However, as Ethereum gained popularity and adoption, Gas fees began to increase.\n\nCurrent Gas Fee Trends (2023): Since the previous all-time high, Ethereum has undergone significant changes, including the ongoing transition to Ethereum 2.0. These changes are aimed at reducing Gas fees and improving scalability. The Gas fees in 2023 have, on average, become more manageable, but they still fluctuate depending on network demand and usage.\n\nEthereum network gas fees have fallen to their lowest since November 2022 amid a decline in on-network activity, Santiment data shows. The cost of transactions fell to $1.13. pic.twitter.com/EM3BEHnfMe \u2014 Meta Joker \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\udde6 (@MetaJoker777) October 5, 2023\n\nConclusion\n\nEthereum gas fees are an integral part of the Ethereum blockchain, serving as incentives for miners, resource allocation mechanisms, and safeguards against spam attacks. Understanding how Gas fees work and the factors influencing their fluctuations is essential for anyone using the Ethereum network.\n\nWhile Ethereum has experienced both extreme highs and lows in Gas fees, ongoing upgrades and the transition to Ethereum 2.0 hold promise for a more scalable and affordable ecosystem in the future. Keeping an eye on gas prices and network conditions is crucial for users looking to optimize their Ethereum transactions.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe information discussed by Altcoin Buzz is not financial advice.

In January 2018, Ethereum experienced a significant correction, plummeting from its high of $1,420 to a mere $80.9 by December 2018.\n\nHowever, this marked the beginning of Ethereum\u2019s resurgence. According to the above chart, Ethereum\u2019s price surged by a jaw-dropping 5,815% (58X) from its low of $80.9, eventually reaching the impressive $4,700 price range in November 2021.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nXRP\u2019s Potential\n\nThe crypto analyst believes that XRP has the potential to replicate the impressive resurgence of ETH. Currently trading at $0.5215, XRP has already established itself as a prominent digital asset.\n\nIf it mirrors Ethereum\u2019s previous performance and undergoes a 58x rally from its current position, XRP could surge to an astonishing $30.2. This is nearly ten times its recent all-time high value.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that XRP also has a history of significant price surges. In January 2017, XRP was worth a mere $0.003, but it reached an all-time high value of $3.317 in just one year. This represented a 110,466% increase or a 1,104x surge.\n\nThese past achievements are undoubtedly impressive, but it\u2019s important to remember that past performances do not guarantee future results.\n\nWhile the crypto landscape has changed, and legal clarity has been achieved for XRP, the journey to a projected 58x rally may not be without its hurdles. Cryptocurrencies are mainly volatile, and investors should remain cautious."

        "content": "Disclaimer: The opinions expressed by our writers are their own and do not represent the views of U.Today. The financial and market information provided on U.Today is intended for informational purposes only. U.Today is not liable for any financial losses incurred while trading cryptocurrencies. Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEthereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, experienced a significant drop in price, briefly plummeting below the $1,600 mark. As of the latest data, Ethereum is trading at approximately $1,634.82, but the brief dip below $1,600 has raised concerns about the asset's short-term stability. This price action opens up the possibility of Ethereum reaching the $1,500 price threshold, a level that could be met sooner than expected given current market sentiment.\n\nThe recent failed launch of VanEck's Ether futures ETF further exacerbates the situation. The ETF generated a meager trading volume, indicating a lack of institutional interest in Ethereum at this time. This is a concerning sign for the cryptocurrency, as institutional demand often acts as a stabilizing force during market downturns.\n\nThe market's current sentiment is not helping Ethereum either. With Bitcoin struggling to maintain its price levels and the broader market showing signs of weakness, Ethereum's drop below $1,600 could be a precursor to further declines. The lack of institutional demand, as evidenced by the VanEck ETF's poor performance, adds another layer of concern.\n\nIt is crucial to note that Ethereum's price is highly volatile and subject to rapid changes. However, the brief dip below $1,600 serves as a warning sign for investors and traders alike. If Ethereum fails to find strong support soon, we could see it test the $1,500 level, which would be a significant psychological barrier for the asset.\n\nShiba Inu remains jailed\n\nShiba Inu (SHIB) has been struggling to break free from its downward trajectory, and recent data confirms that the meme asset is far from recovery. Currently trading at $0.0000072, SHIB has been below its trendline support, which has now turned into resistance, for the past three days. This essentially cements the notion that the asset has failed to regain its bullish momentum.\n\nThe lack of network activity and general buzz around Shiba Inu is a significant factor contributing to its stagnant performance. Unlike other cryptocurrencies that have robust communities and active development, SHIB seems to be lacking in both. This is particularly concerning given that the broader market has also lost much of its liquidity since Bitcoin's surge toward $30,000.\n\nMeme assets, in general, are showing poor performance, and Shiba Inu is no exception. The asset's inability to break through and sustain above its trendline support indicates a lack of buying interest and could potentially lead to further declines if the situation does not improve.\n\nWhat could help Shiba Inu at this point? For starters, an increase in network activity could signal renewed interest in the asset. Additionally, positive developments or partnerships could also serve as catalysts for a potential uptrend. However, as it stands, the meme coin has a long way to go before it can regain its former glory.\n\nDogecoin remains anemic\n\nDogecoin (DOGE), once the darling of the meme coin world, has been stuck in a rut for the last two months. The cryptocurrency is currently trading at $0.06099, showing a lack of volatility and liquidity that has left investors scratching their heads.\n\nOver the past 60 days, Dogecoin has failed to make any significant price movements, remaining stagnant while other meme coins like Shiba Inu and even PEPE have shown more action. This lack of volatility is a stark contrast to the frenzied trading activity that Dogecoin used to enjoy, especially during its meteoric rise earlier this year.\n\nThe poor performance of DOGE is even more glaring when compared to its competitors. Shiba Inu, for instance, has seen periods of high volatility and has even managed to steal some of Dogecoin's thunder. The lack of price movement on DOGE can be attributed to several factors, including the absence of significant updates or news surrounding the coin.\n\nOne of the most talked-about potential catalysts for Dogecoin is the implementation of smart contract technology, a topic that has been discussed for around a year now. Unfortunately, no progress has been made in this direction, leaving investors disappointed and contributing to the coin's stagnant price.\n\nAnother potential catalyst could be endorsements from high-profile figures like Elon Musk or implementation on platforms like X (formerly Twitter). However, these are speculative at best and cannot be relied upon for sustained growth."

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nEthereum futures ETF got off to a poor start, recording less than $3 million in trading volume on first-day trading.\n\nThe paltry figures starkly contrast with the impressive figures notched by Bitcoin futures back in 2021.\n\nNine ETF products were launched on the same day, with the SEC keen on preventing market domination.\n\nAfter months of building anticipation, the Ethereum (ETH) futures exchange-traded fund (ETF) recorded less than stellar results after the first day of trading.\n\nAfter months of regulatory horse-trading, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved nine ETFs to track futures contracts linked to ETH. However, initial enthusiasm waned after the combination of the nine ETFs failed to garner up to $3 million on the first day of trading.\n\n\u201cUnprecedented day today with multiple ETFs all launching at the same time,\u201d said Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas. \u201cNo clear winner has emerged, all of them were pretty average, lower than I would have predicted.\u201d\n\nDespite the lacklustre figures, optimism still runs high, with a cross-section believing that the ETFs could go on to record impressive figures in the coming weeks. Balchunas noted that it would take a while for investors to warm up to ETF tracking the futures contracts tied to ETH citing the preference of investors to hold physical products over derivatives.\n\nAmong the lot, Valkyrie\u2019s Bitcoin Strategy ETF recorded the most activity, with just over $800,000 in volume. Valkyrie\u2019s ETF, originally tracking BTC futures, tweaked its setup to include ETH as it leveraged its soaring popularity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFour out of the nine ETFs track only ETH futures, while the rest operate by tracking a mixture of the futures of two of the largest virtual currencies \u2013 BTC and ETH.\n\nApart from investors\u2019 preference for physical assets, pundits have warned that futures ETFs negatively affect spot markets as virtual currency assets took a hit in the hours following the lunch. Bitcoin (BTC) and ETH experienced minor declines in the hours following the launch as the global market capitalization shrunk by nearly 4%.\n\n\u201cWe would even go further to say a futures-only ETF is arguably detrimental to spot prices \u2013 as it potentially directs demand away from the spot market into synthetic markets,\u201d said one analyst.\n\nA stark difference from 2021\n\nAfter the SEC approved the launch of Bitcoin futures ETFs in October 2021, trading volumes went through the roof. At the time, the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF recorded a staggering $1 billion in volume, with close competitors racking up similar figures amid the push for a spot ETF.\n\nThe impressive ETF volumes propelled BTC to new highs of over $60K, laying the foundation for a new class of institutional interest in the asset. At the moment, investors continue to scan the horizon for an uptick in activity for the new ETH futures ETFs while key players continue to slug it out with the SEC for a BTC spot ETF."

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s daily exchange outflow reached its highest level since August on 4 October.\n\nETH\u2019s accumulation has continued to dawdle.\n\nOn 4 October, over 110,000 Ethereum [ETH] coins, worth around $177.65 million, were withdrawn from known crypto exchange wallets, marking the highest daily exchange outflow since August.\n\n#Ethereum | Roughly 110,000 $ETH were withdrawn from known #crypto exchange wallets in the past 24 hours, worth around $177.65 million, according to onchain data from @santimentfeed. pic.twitter.com/3CGVgOQUbM \u2014 Ali (@ali_charts) October 5, 2023\n\nWhen an asset\u2019s exchange outflow surges in this manner, it suggests that coin holders are moving their assets off exchanges and into cold storage or other non-custodial wallets, which could signify bullish sentiment.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nETH fails to react\n\nA surge in exchange outflows is typically followed by a rally in an asset\u2019s price, which means a reduction in sell-offs. However, this has yet to manifest in ETH, as the price remains trapped within a narrow range.\n\nAt press time, the leading altcoin exchanged hands at $1,620. Following Bitcoin\u2019s [BTC] brief surge above $28,000 during the intraday trading session on 5 October, ETH\u2019s price touched $1648, after which it shed all its gains, data from CoinMarketCap showed.\n\nOn the daily chart, coin accumulation amongst spot traders has lost momentum. As of this writing, the coin\u2019s Relative Strength Index (RSI) was positioned in a downtrend beneath its 50-neutral line.\n\nLikewise, the coin\u2019s Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) was below the zero line at -0.11. A negative CMF value indicates that more money is flowing out of an asset than into it.\n\nA negative CMF value coupled with price consolidation or decline is taken as a bearish signal, suggesting that investors are selling the asset and reducing their exposure.\n\nAn assessment of the coin\u2019s Directional Movement Index (DMI) revealed that ETH\u2019s sellers regained market control after the coin\u2019s price fell from its $1648 peak on 5 October. At press time, the negative directional indicator (red) at 20.63 was positioned above the positive directional indicator (green) at 20.23.\n\nThis crossover showed that the current price trend in the ETH market was a downtrend and that downward price movements outpaced upward price movements.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s ETH\u2019s market cap in BTC terms\n\nFutures traders tread a different path\n\nDespite the recent price action and the significant bearish sentiments in the ETH market, futures traders have remained steadfast.\n\nThe month so far has seen an uptick in ETH\u2019s Open Interest. According to data from Coinglass, the coin\u2019s Open Interest has increased by 3% since 3 October.\n\nWhen ETH open interest increases, it means that the total number of ETH futures contracts that have not been settled has increased.\n\nIt is a bullish signal as it suggests that more investors are opening new positions in ETH. And that there is increasing demand for the asset.\n\nIt remains notable that the coin\u2019s funding rates across exchanges have remained positive despite ETH\u2019s headwinds since April."

        "title": "Is Ethereum\u2019s Staking Boom A Ticking Time Bomb? JPMorgan Weighs In - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Ethereum (ETH), a forerunner in the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, has seen a notable surge in its staking activities. This staking boom has raised eyebrows among experts from JPMorgan concerned over ETH\u2019s increase in centralization and the consequences that may arise.\n\nEthereum, aiming to transition to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, opened the floodgates for staking. This meant holders could \u2018stake\u2019 or lock their tokens to support network operations like block validation. However, while this promises rewards for the stakers, JPMorgan analysts have reported that there could be ripple effects.\n\nEthereum Centralization Concerns Rise To The Surface\n\nJPMorgan analysts, led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, highlight the inadvertent increase in Ethereum\u2019s network centralization, particularly post the Merge and Shanghai upgrades. The Ethereum network became \u201cmore centralized as the overall staking yield declined,\u201d they noted.\n\nAccording to the analysts, what\u2019s leading to this centralization could be attributed to liquid staking providers. Lido, a notable player, has been pinpointed for its dominant role. The JPMorgan report noted:\n\nThe top 5 liquid staking providers control more than 50% of staking on the Ethereum network, and Lido specifically accounts for almost one-third.\n\nThe analysts further disclosed while platforms such as Lido tote their decentralized nature, the underlying reality appears different. The analysts said these platforms \u201cinvolve a high degree of centralization.\u201d\n\nAccording to the analysts, the ramifications of such centralization can\u2019t be understated. They mentioned that \u201ca concentrated number of liquidity providers or node operators\u201d might compromise the network\u2019s integrity, leading to potential points of failure, attacks, or even conspiracy, resulting in an \u201coligopoly.\u201d\n\nThey further highlighted that such centralized entities could censor or exploit user transactions, undermining the community\u2019s interests.\n\nThe Rehypothecation Risk And Declining Rewards\n\nAnother dimension to the staking story is the looming threat of \u2018rehypothecation.\u2019 In simple terms, it\u2019s the act of leveraging staked assets as collateral across various DeFi platforms. According to the JPMorgan\u2019s analysts:\n\nRehypothecation could then result in a cascade of liquidations if a staked asset drops sharply in value or is hacked or slashed due to a malicious attack or a protocol error.\n\nFurthermore, as Ethereum continues its journey on the staking path, the staking rewards seem to diminish. The report indicated a drop in total staking yield from 7.3% before the Shanghai upgrade to roughly 5.5% recently.\n\nRegardless, Ethereum has shown a slight upward trajectory of 1.5% in the past 24 hours, with a market price currently sitting at $1,643 and a market cap of approximately $9 billion, at the time of writing.\n\nFeatured image from Unsplash, Chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "The price of Ethereum (ETH) is giving strong bearish signals despite expectations of an \u2018Uptober\u2019 rally. There has been a lot of fundamentally positive Ethereum news in the past few months. However, the ETH price action keeps disappointing the holders.\n\nOn Thursday, cryptocurrencies remained sideways as the Bitcoin price remained stuck in the Monday range. Ethereum price is underperforming Bitcoin since the start of this week. Despite a 1.28% rebound in Bitcoin in the last trading session, ETH remained in a downtrend.\n\nVanEck Ethereum Futures ETF Goes Live\n\nThis week started with the launch of VanEck Ethereum futures ETF. The first-ever ETH exchange trading fund will give investors exposure to the second-biggest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. However, it won\u2019t translate into a direct investment in the native asset of the Ethereum smart contract blockchain.\n\nAccording to the reports, Proshares, Bitwise, and other asset managers have also launched similar ETFs this week. This suggests that there is a growing interest in Ethereum by the major financial institutions.\n\nETH TVL Is Down 5% YTD\n\nAccording to the decentralized finance (DeFi) tracking website, DeFi Llama, there has been a slight decrease in TVL on the Ethereum blockchain since the start of 2023. The following chart shows that the total locked value has plummeted around 7% in the past 9 months.\n\nSince Ethereum price is up 36% YTD, the TVL decrease points towards an outflow of funds from the biggest blockchain platform. A deeper dive into on-chain analysis reveals that most of these finds have moved to layer 2 networks like zkSync, Scroll, Arbitrum, and Optimism for airdrop farming. In terms of TVL and network activity, Ethereum remains the biggest and most secure smart contract platform on the planet.\n\nETH/BTC Tanks To 15-Month Lows\n\nThe analysis of the ETH/BTC pair on the daily timeframe gives a very bearish outlook. ETH price has been in a free fall against Bitcoin since September 2022. This shows that the investors have moved their capital from Ethereum to Bitcoin during this time. This also shows a prevalent risk-off approach in the crypto markets.\n\nThere is a clear formation of the falling wedge pattern on the following chart. The ETH/BTC pair is trading at its lowest level since July 2022, which shows the weakness of the smart contract asset compared to the Bitcoin price. In case of a breakdown from this pattern, my previously forecasted level of 0.05 will be on the cards.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction\n\nThe short-term outlook of the ETH to USD pair is also not looking very bullish. On a 4-hour timeframe, the price is trading within the $1750-$1577 range. After a rejection from the range highs at the start of October 2023, the Ethereum price prediction is looking extremely bearish.\n\nIn the coming days, there is a strong likelihood of a retest of the range lows around $1,577. Bulls need to gain strength above the range highs to show some strength and boost investor confidence.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "The Flow community has unveiled a groundbreaking proposal known as \u2018EVM on Flow,\u2019 designed to achieve full Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) equivalence on the Flow blockchain.\n\nThis proposal aims to enable Ethereum developers to deploy their DApps on Flow without making substantial code changes, simplifying the process of migrating or creating DApps on this innovative platform.\n\nFlow blockchain is a fast, decentralized, and developer-friendly blockchain designed to be the on-chain home for mainstream IPs including NBA, NFL, Doodles, and Mattel, as well as an open ecosystem where anyone can build.\n\nThe layer-one blockchain, which was created by a team with experience working at CryptoKitties, Dapper Wallet, NBA Top Shot, has a native token, FLOW which is used to pay network fees for transactions and smart contract computations and can also be traded or invested.\n\nAccording to Flow, the introduction of EVM compatibility on Flow offers a game-changing advantage to Ethereum developers. It allows them to harness the benefits of the Flow blockchain without the need to learn a new programming language or undertake complex code modifications.\n\nAdditionally, the brain behind the proposal, who is also the co-founder of Dapper Labs and Lead Architect at Flow, Dieter Shirley, stated that the process of integration involves the creation of a \u201cgateway\u201d software that can wrap and submit Ethereum transactions to the Flow blockchain. The key highlight is that no fundamental code changes are necessary to achieve full Ethereum Virtual Machine equivalence on Flow.\n\nHe added that this \u2018gateway\u2019 software enables the Flow ecosystem to potentially support Ethereum-based decentralized applications (dApps). It allows developers to wrap external transactions using Cadence, a smart contract programming language for Flow.\n\nHe also revealed that the proposal, which opens the door for the transfer of ERC-20 and ERC-721 tokens between the two networks, presents challenges that need to be addressed. Notable issues include mapping EVM gas fees to Cadence and ensuring seamless interoperability. Additionally, there is a need to finalize details regarding the EVM environment on Flow and its integration with the existing Flow infrastructure.\n\nTo solve this problem, the co-founder said that community input is critical in addressing the technical intricacies and ensuring the successful realization of EVM equivalence on Flow."

        "title": "Tron Has More Daily Active Addresses Than Ethereum: What's Supercharging Growth? - Bitcoinist",
        "content": "Tron, a platform where users can deploy smart contracts and run decentralized applications (dapps) like they would in Ethereum, is rapidly growing its daily active addresses (DAA). DAA is the count of unique addresses that send or receive tokens on a blockchain on any given day.\n\nTron\u2019s DAA Exploding, Surpasses Ethereum, Bitcoin\n\nAccording to metrics shared by decentralized finance (DeFi) researcher Alex Wacy on October 6, citing Token Terminal, Tron has over 1.9 million DAA, more than twice those in the BNB Chain, which, at the time of sharing, stood at 915,000. Ethereum and Polygon had 320,000 and 301,000 trailing Bitcoin, the legacy blockchain, which had 570,000 DAA.\n\nAt this level, it is estimated that Tron is creating 200,000 new addresses daily. Other metrics also show that Tron has at least 188 million unique accounts that have generated 6.5 billion transactions.\n\nThe spike in DAA, Wacy said, could be because of Tron\u2019s role in stablecoin transactions. Stablecoins are designed to track the value of another asset, mostly fiat currencies like the USD. The researcher said roughly $45 billion of all stablecoins are held in Tron, complying with the TRC-20 standard. Out of this, 50% of all USDT transactions are on Tron.\n\nThe surge in Tron\u2019s DAA is noteworthy. It is when the broader cryptocurrency scene struggles with volatile asset prices and relatively low on-chain activity, especially in areas like DeFi, metaverse, non-fungible token (NFT), and blockchain.\n\nDeFiLlama data shows that the total value locked (TVL) in DeFi, for instance, is below $40 billion, well below the $173 billion level when crypto asset prices peaked in late 2021.\n\nLegacy Blockchains Are Still Preferred Despite Suppressed Activity\n\nLooking at DAA alone, there is an inversion, and legacy networks, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, are trailing third-generation platforms promising cheaper transaction fees and higher throughput. From the DAA leaderboard, Tron, the BNB Chain, and NEAR Protocol are attracting new users.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum\u2019s engagement appear suppressed, looking at DAA. Though DAA can be a metric to consider when gauging how users interact with the network, Bitcoin and Ethereum are still preferred blockchains.\n\nBitcoin, for instance, inherently lacks smart contracts capability, but there are protocols built on it, like Rootstock, that support this feature. However, Bitcoin, due to its first-mover advantage, has found adoption. BTC is also listed in almost most exchanges and enables the daily transfer of millions, if not billions, of dollars.\n\nThis has cemented its activity and could explain why it is above Ethereum despite the latter\u2019s activity density, especially considering fees generated from smart contracts execution and transfers. As of October 6, CryptoFees show that Ethereum generated over $2 million in fees, more than twice in Bitcoin.\n\nFeature image from Canva, chart from TradingView"

        "content": "Several on-chain indicators suggest that the price of Ethereum could see an imminent rally, as the circulating supply of ETH on cryptocurrency exchanges is in sharp decline.\n\nMonitoring the change in supply of a cryptocurrency on CEXs is crucial for making medium-term predictions, as this metric provides important information about the potential selling pressure of an asset.\n\nThe price of ETH could be closer than ever to a bullish break of $2,000 per coin, which could happen by the end of the year, given and taking into account the historical returns of the cryptocurrency market in the fourth quarter, especially in October.\n\nLet\u2019s look at all the details together and try to shed some light on it.\n\nOn-chain data shows positive signs for Ethereum\u2019s future price\n\nAlthough the general outlook for the cryptocurrency market is not the best, some on-chain indicators show very positive conditions for Ethereum\u2019s price in the medium term.\n\nIn particular, we can see that ETH\u2019s balance on centralised exchanges has fallen dramatically since the beginning of the year, reaching its lowest level since May 2018.\n\nIndeed, since 1 January 2023, the number of coins on CEX has fallen from 18.48 million ETH to the current 14.56 million. This represents a reduction of almost 4 million crypto coins, which are now held in private wallets or staking on the Beacoin chain.\n\nThis helps to alleviate potential selling pressure on platforms such as Binance, Coinbase, Kraken, Bybit, Okx, etc., where there is generally more trading taking place and more short positions being opened with derivatives.\n\nIf this trend continues for a few more months (and demand picks up in parallel), the price of Ethereum is likely to rise significantly.\n\nStill on the subject of changes in stock market reserves, it should be noted that, according to the Santiment platform, around 110,000 ETH were withdrawn on 4 October, accelerating the flight of capital to decentralised platforms and wallets.\n\nThis is an unusual movement, behind which a whale or a series of individuals with considerable economic power are likely to be hiding.\n\n#Ethereum | Roughly 110,000 $ETH were withdrawn from known #crypto exchange wallets in the past 24 hours, worth around $177.65 million, according to onchain data from @santimentfeed. pic.twitter.com/3CGVgOQUbM \u2014 Ali (@ali_charts) October 5, 2023\n\nCurrently, there are approximately 115.88 million ETH outside of exchanges, of which approximately 27.32 million are staked on the proof-of-stake network.\n\nIn October 2022, this number was around 14.1 million ETH: this means that in about a year, more than 13 million ETH have been taken out of circulation and placed on the Ethereum storage contract or on a liquid staking platform.\n\nIt is also interesting to note that the current price of Ethereum is roughly the same as it was then (closing price October 2022), so those who locked their coins exactly one year ago today can boast a return of around 4-5%.\n\nWill ETH reach $2,000 by the end of the year?\n\nHaving looked at the on-chain data, which suggests that there is fertile ground for Ethereum\u2019s price growth, let\u2019s talk about predictions: will ETH reach $2,000 by the end of the year?\n\nLet\u2019s start with the assumption that, despite the optimism of indicators based on the internal movements of the blockchain, the most important context to watch is the macroeconomic one, especially in the US territory, where a further increase in interest rates on government bonds could be in sight in November.\n\nSuch a scenario could lead investors to reduce their allocation to more speculative markets such as cryptocurrencies, with negative consequences for the price of ether and the crypto sector in general.\n\nFurthermore, the issues surrounding the possible approval of a spot ETF on Bitcoin could also indirectly affect the price of the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalisation.\n\nIndeed, it is well known that BTC and ETH almost always move in tandem, and a catalytic event such as the approval of the first legitimate spot ETF in the US would certainly trigger a major uptrend for Ethereum as well.\n\nSpeaking of ETFs, it is worth noting that an ETH futures on ETF was approved by the SEC a few days ago, but generated very little investor interest with only 2 million trades.\n\nVanEck\u2019s new ETH futures ETF only did $2 million of trading volume in its first day yesterday.\n\n\n\nPretty wild compared to the BTC futures ETF that did 500x that in its first day during the bull mkt.\n\n\n\nShows how dead this market really is lol \u2014 Will (@WClementeIII) October 3, 2023\n\nComing back to our original question, we can confirm that it is very likely that if the FED reverses its monetary policy strategy by switching to quantitative easing and/or if the SEC approves the first spot ETF for BTC in the US, then the price of Ethereum will be well above the $2,000 mark.\n\nUnfortunately, if these two events do not happen by the end of the year, the on-chain data may not be enough to push the value of ETH to that level.\n\nWhile these types of indicators work well in the medium term, they are not accurate in the short term.\n\nSeveral traders are currently short ETH, fearing that the weekly candles that have formed since the beginning of the year have contributed to the \u201cbear flag\u201d pattern that usually indicates the possibility of upcoming declines.\n\nOn X, user \u2018Chill Trader\u2019 shared his opinion on Ethereum\u2019s price action, saying that while he expects a bullish bounce in the next few days, he believes that a breach of the $1,565 level will result in another dump that will take the price of the coin into a range between $1,440 and $1,370."

Teaming up with the blockchain payment platform called FCF Pay, they\u2019re revolutionizing the way people engage with their services. Not only that, but they\u2019re also shining the spotlight brighter onto Japan as a major player in the Web3 industry.\n\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at this exciting partnership and explore the potential impact it could have on the automotive and financial sectors.\n\nNext-Gen Partnerships\n\nHonda\u2019s exciting partnership with FCF Pay shows its commitment to innovation and staying ahead of the curve. This collaboration is set to revolutionize the way Honda customers make purchases, allowing them to use digital currencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum instead of traditional fiat money.\n\nFCF Pay Who??\n\nFCF Pay is a popular blockchain payment platform that supports various cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, and even meme coins like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin. The collab between Honda and FCF Pay is a big step toward the widespread acceptance and use of crypto.\n\nJapan Is All In\n\nJapan is all in for Web3 innovation, as shown by the Web3 project team in the governing Liberal Democratic Party. They recently dropped a white paper with recommendations to boost Japan\u2019s Web3 sector, proving their commitment to leading the tech game. This move is a clear sign that Japan is serious about nurturing innovation and driving growth in the rapidly evolving Web3 world. They\u2019re definitely a global frontrunner\u2026\n\nHonda Isn\u2019t The First\n\nHonda wasn\u2019t actually the first Japanese car company to jump on the crypto train. SBI Motor, another big player in the industry, had already jumped on board by accepting Bitcoin as a payment option. And let\u2019s not forget the buzz that Tesla created when they announced they\u2019d be accepting Bitcoin and even Dogecoin for buying their cars (although they did change their minds later on).\n\nNissan has also been diving into the Web3 world, checking out metaverse-based vehicle sales for brands like Infiniti, Nismo, and Nissan. These advancements show how crypto is becoming more common in the automotive sector, reflecting the broader trend of digital currencies being adopted by various industries.\n\nPartnerships On Top Of Partnerships\n\nHSBC has partnered with FCF Pay to offer a convenient solution for cryptocurrency users, allowing them to utilize digital assets such as XRP, Shiba Inu, and Dogecoin to pay off their mortgage bills and loans. This innovative collaboration aims to provide a seamless experience while retaining the essence of the original digital currency concept. It also shows how cryptocurrencies are gaining acceptance in different sectors, and how they\u2019re becoming more integrated into traditional financial institutions.\n\nWhat Will The Future Bring?\n\nSince a global automotive giant like Honda started accepting cryptocurrencies as payment, it might inspire other industry players to do the same. This shows how the automotive, traditional finance and crypto sectors are coming together, and it could lead to more exciting innovations and collaborations down the road. The future is looking bright!\n\nCheers"
