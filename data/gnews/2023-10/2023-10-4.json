        "content": "The average gas fee on Ethereum stands at $1.13, the lowest since November 2022.\n\nSubsequently, some analysts believe Ethereum\u2019s native cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH), might be forming a bottom similar to the one in late 2022 based on on-chain data.\n\nAccording to an X post by analytics firm Santiment, this week\u2019s average fee level on Ethereum reached $1.13, the lowest since November 2022, when ETH formed a bottom at $1,100.\n\nYou might also like: Ethereum futures ETFs on CME begin with light trading volumes\n\nAnalysts noted this is \u201cnot a perfect signal by any means.\u201d However, they admitted that lower fee costs \u201cgenerally lead to a rise in utility and price rebound.\u201d\n\nhttps://twitter.com/santimentfeed/status/1709659943383752716?s=20\n\nWhen ETH sunk to 2022 lows, it wasn\u2019t before May 2023 that the coin rallied to above $2,157. However, there are no direct indications that this scenario could be replaced.\n\nIn the past week, ETH rose 1.26% increase. The coin is changing hands at $1,637, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nDespite the firmness, ETH\u2019s trading volume has dropped in the last 24 hours, plummeting by 12.2% to $4.6 billion.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/santimentfeed/status/1709743778817540311?s=20\n\nThe drop in trading volume also coincides with massive ETH outflows of centralized exchanges, as per Santiment data.\n\nOn Wednesday, Oct. 4, around 110,000 ETH (worth approximately $181 million) have been moved off of exchanges, making it the largest outflow day since Aug. 21, 2023.\n\nWith the latest outflow, the non-exchange ETH now sits at an all-time high of 115.8 million ETH (around $190 billion), while its exchange supply is at \u201cits lowest in ~5.5 years.\u201d\n\nRead more: Cosmos plans to attract Ethereum developers in 2024\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "content": "The Ethereum network has made the switch from proof-of-work mining to proof-of-stake mining. The transition was completed successfully on September 15, 2022. Additionally, the blockchain went through some major changes as validators replaced miners.\n\nRecently, the much-awaited Shapella upgrade went live, allowing these speakers to withdraw their staked Ethereum 2.0. Additionally, with numerous developments on the Ethereum blockchain, let us learn about ETH a bit more.\n\nAlso read: How to Get a New Bitcoin Address on Cash App?\n\nEthereum in a nutshell\n\nVitalik Buterin built the decentralized blockchain platform Ethereum in 2015, along with the Ethereum Foundation, to support the development and execution of smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). Additionally, it has developed to become one of the biggest and most popular cryptocurrencies in the world. Ethereum is distinguished from Bitcoin by its programmability.\n\nThe blockchain has grown to accommodate a wide range of applications. Developers on the ETH network can design decentralized applications by using smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts with predefined rules. Additionally, over time, ETH has grown to be the second-largest cryptocurrency in the world.\n\nAlso read: How to Add MidJourney to my Discord Server?\n\nSource: CNN\n\nEthereum Cancun upgrade explained\n\nThe upcoming Cancun upgrade for the Ethereum blockchain represents a major milestone focused on boosting scalability and security.\n\nAlso dubbed the \u201cDencun\u201d upgrade, Cancun will introduce 5 Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) designed to increase network throughput and reduce transaction costs.\n\nAt its core, Cancun looks to improve the network\u2019s transactions per second (TPS) to support more usage while retaining decentralization. This aligns with the \u201cSurge\u201d phase of Ethereum\u2019s phased roadmap.\n\nKey changes include EIP-4844 which enhances data availability across Ethereum shards to scale the network. EIP-1153 aims to lower data storage costs to optimize block space usage.\n\nAdditionally, EIP-4788 exposes Beacon chain data to execution layers to strengthen bridges, while EIP-5656 adds a new memory copying instruction to enable more efficient data structures.\n\nAlso read: Will ETH Go Up?\n\nRounding out the upgrades, EIP-6780 alters the SELFDESTRUCT function to limit potential smart contract disruptions.\n\nIn total, the Cancun EIPs constitute foundational improvements to Ethereum\u2019s technical capabilities and security primitives. Researchers tentatively target full implementation in October 2023.\n\nBy boosting throughput and reducing the viability of attacks, the upgrade promises to make the network an even more attractive ecosystem for developers and users over the long term."

        "title": "Vitalik considers implications of adding ZK-EVM, other features to Ethereum mainnet - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin recently wrote an in-depth blog post exploring the question of which features should become official parts of the Ethereum protocol versus being built on top of it. This has been an ongoing debate as the network evolves.\n\nIn the early days, Buterin explains, Ethereum strove to keep its base layer as simple and minimalist as possible. This aligned with the Unix philosophy of creating uncomplicated, flexible software. The goal was for Ethereum to provide a solid foundation for decentralized applications, with most functionality implemented through smart contracts built on top.\n\nOver time, however, some have questioned whether more features should be directly enshrined in the core protocol. But what does \u201censhrining\u201d mean? Buterin defines it as making something intrinsic to the official Ethereum specification that client developers must implement. The alternative, \u201cde-enshrining,\u201d means removing a feature from the base layer and pushing it out to be handled by smart contracts instead.\n\nPros and Cons of Enshrining Features\n\nButerin analyzes the pros and cons of enshrining several potential features. Enshrining can provide efficiency gains, more robust security, and censorship resistance. But it also risks making transactions more expensive, over-complicating governance, and reducing flexibility to meet unanticipated user needs down the road.\n\nButerin uses account abstraction as a case study to analyze this debate. Earlier proposals like EIP-86 tried to make transactions just simple VM calls, minimizing protocol complexity but increasing miner responsibilities. More recent proposals like ERC-4337 still start outside the protocol but may later enshrine components for efficiency and security.\n\nButerin explores enshrining several other potential features:\n\nZK-EVMs: Could improve efficiency and allow leveraging Ethereum\u2019s governance to manage bugs, but challenges around supporting diverse ZK technologies remain.\n\nProposer-builder separation: Could reduce trust assumptions, but extra-protocol approaches already exist.\n\nPrivate mempools: No current encryption technology seems robust enough to enshrine, but valuable to build at the application layer.\n\nLiquid staking: Could reduce centralization risks and open more staking options, but challenges around governance remain.\n\nMore precompiles: This could improve efficiency, but risks over-complicating the protocol and low usage of past precompiles.\n\nEnshrining features can provide efficiency, security, and censorship resistance. But it can also over-extend the protocol\u2019s governance and make it too rigid for unanticipated user needs.\n\nHow the community may be fractured on enshrining.\n\nWithin the Ethereum community, differing perspectives emerge on this question. Pragmatists may prioritize enshrining features that offer clear benefits to users today, even if complex to govern. In contrast, purists argue that radically minimizing the base layer preserves Ethereum\u2019s vision as a decentralized application platform.\n\nBusinesses and institutions want features that support their use cases quickly enshrined, while decentralization advocates worry that risks unaccountable control by privileged groups. Developers desire expanded base layer functionality to ease app building, but security researchers warn enshrinement may lock in suboptimal technical choices.\n\nAs Buterin thoughtfully lays out, navigating these tradeoffs will only grow more complex as expectations of Ethereum diversify and scale. However, discussing core principles helps anchor the conversation as progress compels reassessment. The full blog post \u201cShould Ethereum be okay with enshrining more things in the protocol?\u201d is well worth the read.\n\nUltimately, Ethereum\u2019s open \u201csoft forking\u201d process allows continued evolution based on emerging community priorities. Buterin\u2019s post thus provides a valuable framework to weigh options and build alignment as Ethereum marches toward its ambitious vision."

Source: K33 Research\n\nThis lack of institutional appetite for Ether ETFs caused Lunde to walk back on his previous advice of increasing ETH allocation to best capitalize on the ETF hype.\n\n\u201cThe ETH futures ETF launch provides an important lesson for evaluating the impact of easier access to crypto investments for traditional investors: increased institutional access will only create buying pressure if significant unsatiated demand exists,\u201d wrote Lunde.\n\n\u201cThis is not the case for ETH at the moment.\u201d\n\nIn the section of the report titled \u201cMore chop ahead,\u201d Lunde explained that the vast majority of the crypto market lacks any meaningful short-term price catalysts and will most likely continue on its sideways trajectory for the foreseeable future.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin bull market awaits as US faces \u2018bear steepener\u2019 \u2014 Arthur Hayes\n\nIn Lunde\u2019s view, this landscape is only really favorable for Bitcoin, which has a potential spot for ETF approval to look forward to early next year, as well as the halving event, which is currently on track for mid-April.\n\n\u201cThe gravitational pull in crypto for the time being stays in BTC, with a promising event horizon down the line, still favoring aggressive accumulation.\u201d\n\nBen Laidler, global markets strategist at eToro, charted a similar path ahead for crypto assets, albeit with a slightly more bearish sentiment.\n\nIn emailed comments to Cointelegraph, Laidler pointed to current macro trends as a potential downward trigger for prices of mainstay crypto assets such as Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cThe Fed and oil prices have been consistently powerful macro influencers on the crypto market in the past couple of years,\u201d wrote Laidler. \u201cAt the late stage of the rate hike cycle we\u2019re in, the market is looking for further good news to push on, but with oil prices rising again, this could have a cooling effect on sentiment.\u201d\n\nCollect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space.\n\nMagazine: Blockchain detectives \u2014 Mt.

        "content": "This week, investment managers Bitwise, Proshares, and VanEck all separately launched six futures-based ETFs, the first in the U.S., tied to ethereum, the world\u2019s second most popular cryptocurrency. Grayscale Investments also asked the Securities and Exchange Commission to let it convert the Grayscale Ethereum Trust, the largest ethereum investment product in the world, to a spot ether ETF. The product has $5 billion in assets under management.\n\nThe launches come as the SEC continues to deliberate on the future of a spot bitcoin ETF. Over the last few years, the SEC has denied more than 30 spot bitcoin applications. The SEC also filed lawsuits against Coinbase and Binance, two of the world\u2019s largest crypto exchanges, this year.\n\nEven though the regulatory uncertainty has caused many advisors to stay away from crypto, investment vehicles like ETFs can provide a more secure and compliant way for advisors to gain exposure to bitcoin and Ethereum on behalf of their clients.\n\n\u201cWhat these ETFs do is they take those features and package them up into a ticker that\u2019s accessible to everyday investors, to financial advisors in a brokerage account,\u201d said Matt Hougan, CIO of Bitwise, during a webinar on Tuesday hosted by the Digital Assets Council of Financial Professionals. \u201cLarge institutional investors are not going to pull out their phone and download an app and put a billion dollars to work. They\u2019re going to work in a regulated market.\u201d\n\n[Like this article? Subscribe to RIA Intel\u2019s\u2019 thrice-weekly newsletter.]\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum are the only two cryptocurrencies that the SEC has specifically said were not a security.\n\nLast year, a record $3.82 billion was lost to investment fraud, the bulk of which is tied to cryptocurrency-related scams, including the collapse of FTX and other high-profile crypto exchanges. Of that amount, $2.57 billion was lost specifically to cryptocurrency investment scams last year, according to an analysis done by investment fraud law firm Carlson Law.\n\n\u201cIn the past, you really only had two options when you bought digital assets: either you left them on an exchange or custodian, taking counterparty risk, or you sent them to an offline wallet and self-custodied them,\u201d Kyle DaCruz, director of digital asset products at VanEck said. \u201cAs we\u2019ve seen over the last year, the space is still new and developing. And as with the blow-ups with FTX, perhaps if investors have the opportunity to get exposure to these assets through an ETF or ETF wrapper, they would not have maybe left as much on the exchanges.\u201d\n\nTrading volume of the new ETFs remained relatively low with less than $2 million in trading volumes across the six funds on the first day. Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas said on X, formerly known as Twitter, that Monday\u2019s trading volumes were underwhelming but average for a normal ETF launch. In comparison, the first Bitcoin futures ETF was one of the most-traded ETF debuts, with $984 million in volume and $570 million in assets."

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s network fees have plunged to some of their lowest levels, with this week recording an average of $1.13, a price last seen in November 2022.\n\nCrypto analytics firm Santiment revealed in a post on X that while the latest discovery may not be a perfect signal, it could indicate that ether (ETH) is preparing for a price rebound.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Network Fees Plunge\n\nSantiment disclosed that the last time Ethereum gas fees went below $1.15, ETH experienced a price bottom, which eventually corrected and led to a rise in utility.\n\nSince Ethereum has been cheap to use recently, there could be a repetition of past occurrences as lower ETH costs generally increase the probability of a utility and price rise, according to Santiment.\n\nThe crypto market intelligence platform\u2019s disclosures come as the amount of ETH outside exchanges hits an all-time high. Ethereum recorded its largest outflow day since August 21 on Wednesday as approximately 110,000 ETH worth roughly $181 million found their way out of crypto exchanges.\n\nThe amount of ETH on exchanges, rounding off to 10.6 million ETH, is at its lowest since May 2018 compared to the 115.88 million sitting outside exchanges.\n\nMarket Abuzz With ETH ETFs Launch\n\nThe latest developments coincide with the launch of ETH futures exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S., a move that has set the crypto market abuzz with anticipation. Several investment firms launched nine ETH futures ETFs on October 2, expanding the landscape for institutional investment in one of the world\u2019s largest blockchain networks by total value locked.\n\nWhile investment firms like ProShares and Bitwise launched three and two funds, VanEck, Valkyrie, Kelly, Hashdex, and Volshares unveiled single ETH investment products.\n\nThe multiple ETFs launch raised investors\u2019 hopes about the price of ETH hitting and possibly crossing the $2,000 mark before 2023 runs out. Although ETH leaped by 4% at the time of the launch, it lost the gains within 24 hours and, by the time of writing, was hovering around $1,640, according to data from CoinMarketCap.\n\nMeanwhile, the trading volumes of the nine ETH futures ETFs at launch and present have been lower than expected."

        "content": "Should I stake my Ethereum? A Comprehensive Guide to Staking Rewards\n\nThe long-awaited Ethereum Merge has finally arrived, bringing exciting changes to the Ethereum network.\n\nOne of the key components of this upgrade is the transition from a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism.\n\nThis shift aims to enhance the scalability, security, and energy efficiency of the Ethereum blockchain. But what does this mean for Ethereum holders?\n\nShould you stake your Ethereum and earn staking rewards?\n\nThis comprehensive guide will explore the ins and outs of staking Ethereum, its benefits, risks, and various staking options.\n\nAlso read: Cloud and Crypto-Based Gaming: The End for Xbox and PlayStation?\n\nSource: CNBC\n\nUnderstanding Proof-of-Stake (PoS) and Proof-of-Work (PoW)\n\nScalability Improvement\n\nUnder the previous Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism, Ethereum had a limited transaction processing capacity of 15 transactions per second (TPS).\n\nThis pales compared to traditional financial payment services like Visa and MasterCard, which handle thousands of transactions per second.\n\nThe transition to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) will significantly improve Ethereum\u2019s scalability, enabling it to process up to 100,000 TPS.\n\nThis increased capacity opens the doors to a broader range of projects and applications on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nAlso read: Crypto-Friendly Banks in Europe?\n\nEnergy Efficiency Enhancement\n\nAnother significant advantage of PoS over PoW is its energy efficiency. The Ethereum Foundation estimates that the Ethereum blockchain will consume approximately 99.9% less energy under the PoS mechanism.\n\nThis improvement is a crucial step towards addressing the environmental concerns associated with blockchain technology.\n\nAdditionally, there is a growing trend towards using renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind, for mining (PoW) and staking (PoS), further reducing the carbon footprint of the Ethereum network.\n\nWhat Does It Mean to Stake Ethereum?\n\nStaking Ethereum on a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain involves actively participating in the validation of transactions.\n\nUnlike the mining process in Proof-of-Work (PoW), where miners compete based on computational power, PoS randomly selects validators based on the amount and duration of their staked Ether.\n\nValidators are responsible for creating new blocks and validating transactions, ensuring the integrity and security of the network. In return for their participation, validators receive staking rewards in proportion to their stake.\n\nPros and cons of staking Ethereum\n\nSource: MARCA\n\nPros\n\nPassive Investment\n\nStaking Ethereum offers a passive investment opportunity. Once you stake your Ether, there is no additional effort required on your part.\n\nYou can sit back and earn staking rewards, currently averaging an annual percentage rate (APR) of around 4%.\n\nFor example, with a minimum requirement of 32 ETH, you could earn approximately 1.3 ETH per year (based on the current price of one ETH being around $1,320).\n\nSense of Community\n\nIf you are passionate about Ethereum and believe in its value, staking allows you to actively contribute to the network\u2019s health and security.\n\nBy validating transactions and participating in the consensus mechanism, you become an integral part of the Ethereum community.\n\nStaking can be a rewarding experience for those who want to support the network while earning a reasonable payout.\n\nComparatively Low Risk\n\nCompared to other cryptocurrencies, Ethereum is a relatively stable staking option. Its popularity, global use, and established security protocols give it an advantage over many other tokens in the market.\n\nWhile the crypto market may experience fluctuations, Ethereum has shown resilience and potential for long-term growth.\n\nStaking Ethereum allows you to earn rewards without exposing yourself to excessive risk.\n\nCons\n\nWithdrawal Restriction\n\nCurrently, staked Ethereum cannot be withdrawn until the release of Ethereum 2.0, which is expected to take 12 to 18 months, assuming no further delays.\n\nIf you have liquidity constraints or anticipate needing immediate access to your funds, staking may not be a suitable option for you.\n\nHowever, some centralized crypto exchanges offer staking options with more flexibility.\n\nFees\n\nStaking Ethereum may involve certain fees, depending on your chosen staking method. Centralized crypto exchanges and other staking services may charge fees for their services.\n\nThese fees can vary, so it\u2019s essential to consider the trade-off between liquidity costs and staking fees when selecting a staking option.\n\nValidator Penalties\n\nWhile rare, validators can face penalties for being offline or validating incorrect transactions. Non-compliance with the network\u2019s rules can result in a reduction or complete loss of staked Ether.\n\nValidators must consistently fulfill their responsibilities to avoid penalties that may affect their returns.\n\nCustodial Staking Risks\n\nWhen staking with a crypto exchange or a staking service, your Ethereum is held in a custodial wallet managed by the platform.\n\nWhile this offers convenience, it also exposes your staked Ether to certain risks, such as hacking, counterparty failure, or government actions.\n\nIt\u2019s crucial to carefully evaluate the security measures and reputation of the platform before staking your Ethereum.\n\nHow to Stake Ethereum: Options and Considerations\n\nSource: Reuters\n\nSeveral options are available for staking Ethereum, each with its own set of considerations. Let\u2019s explore the different staking methods and their associated benefits and risks.\n\nRunning a validator\n\nRunning a validator allows you to earn the highest rewards but requires a significant investment.\n\nIn most cases, you must stake a minimum of 32 ETH, which can amount to a substantial capital outlay.\n\nAdditionally, running a validator involves technical requirements, such as storing data and processing transactions on the blockchain.\n\nYou\u2019ll need reliable hardware and a stable internet connection. While running a validator can be rewarding, it\u2019s essential to assess the costs and technical challenges involved carefully.\n\nValidator Pools\n\nValidator pools offer an alternative to running a solo validator. In a validator pool, multiple participants pool their ETH to reach the minimum requirement of 32 ETH needed to run a validator.\n\nThis pooling of resources allows individuals with smaller amounts of ETH to participate in staking while enjoying many of the benefits of running a validator.\n\nValidator pools offer a lower barrier to entry. They can be a good option for those who want to stake their ETH without the significant financial commitment and technical requirements of running a solo validator.\n\nExchanges\n\nMany reputable crypto exchanges now offer staking services for Ethereum. Staking your ETH through an exchange offers convenience and accessibility.\n\nMost exchanges have low or no minimum staking requirements, making it possible for anyone with any capital to participate. After purchasing Ethereum, you can immediately start staking.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s important to consider the security measures and fees imposed by the exchange.\n\nCustodial staking carries risks, such as platform hacks or unexpected regulatory actions. Conduct thorough research and choose a reputable exchange with robust security measures.\n\nLiquid Staking\n\nOne of the downsides of staking Ethereum is the inability to withdraw your staked ETH until Ethereum 2.0 is fully implemented.\n\nLiquid staking aims to address this limitation by offering tokens that represent your staked ETH and can be freely traded or used for other purposes.\n\nLiquid staking services Swap your ETH for a receipt token, such as stETH, which can be stored in a private crypto wallet. These receipt tokens maintain the staked ETH\u2019s value while allowing you to utilize them for trading or other transactions.\n\nLiquid staking provides a solution for those who seek more flexibility and liquidity while still earning staking rewards.\n\nConclusion: Is staking Ethereum worth it?\n\nThe decision to stake your Ethereum ultimately depends on your investment goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Staking Ethereum offers the potential for passive income and allows you to actively contribute to the Ethereum network.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s important to consider the risks involved, such as withdrawal restrictions, fees, and custodial-taking risks. Conduct thorough research, evaluate your financial situation, and consult with a financial advisor if necessary.\n\nWhile staking Ethereum can be a rewarding experience, it\u2019s essential to approach it with a long-term perspective.\n\nThe crypto market is highly volatile, and short-term price fluctuations should not deter you from the potential benefits of staking.\n\nDetermine your investment objectives, assess the available staking options, and make an informed decision based on your circumstances.\n\nRemember, staking Ethereum involves locking up your ETH for a specified period, so it\u2019s crucial to consider your liquidity needs and investment horizon.\n\nWith proper research and careful consideration, staking Ethereum can be a valuable addition to your investment strategy.\n\nDisclaimer: The views and opinions expressed in this article are for informational purposes only and do not constitute financial advice.

        "content": "Apart from Spot Bitcoin ETFs, Ethereum Futures ETFs have been the talk of the crypto industry for months as investors look toward a catalyst for the next bull run. However, data has shown the highly anticipated ETFs have had underwhelming results in trading volume.\n\nAlthough the crypto market has witnessed some gains in the past few days, this hasn\u2019t flowed into Ethereum Futures ETFs as investors seem hesitant to adopt these new Ethereum investment vehicles.\n\nHow Have Ethereum Futures ETFs Fared So Far?\n\nEthereum futures ETFs provide indirect exposure to the price of ETH through futures contracts and Nine Ethereum Futures ETFs were introduced to the market on Monday, October 2nd. These include ETFs by ProShares, VanEck, Bitwise, and other financial firms following a year of anticipation.\n\nAs the second biggest cryptocurrency by market cap, many expected the ETFs to take off quickly and piggyback on the early success of Bitcoin Futures ETFs. However, data shows the trading volume for these new products has remained relatively low so far.\n\nAccording to a report by Bloomberg, these nine futures ETFs attracted $1.92 million in the 24 hours after launch. Most of this trading occurred in the ProShares Ether Strategy ETF which contributed over 45% of trading volume.\n\nPretty meh volume for the Ether Futures ETFs as a group, a little under $2m, about normal for a new ETF but vs $BITO (which did $200m in first 15min) it is low.

At the moment, the inflows are being led by the VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF (EFUT), which has $8.27 million, followed by the ProShares Ether Strategy ETF (EETH), which has $5.96 million.\n\nEther futures ETFs starting see some flows, not a ton, but it\u2019s something, +$15.6m with VanEck in an early lead over ProShares.. pic.twitter.com/e0bu7T0ZLT \u2014 Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) October 4, 2023\n\nIn comparison, Bitcoin Futures ETFs registered $1 billion in trading volume within the first 24 hours after launch. But it\u2019s important to note that the market sentiment during these two periods wasn\u2019t the same. Bitcoin futures ETFs were launched during the peak of the 2021 crypto bull market, and cryptocurrencies have had major pullbacks since then.\n\nFuture Outlook Of ETH\n\nWhile Ethereum futures ETFs provide a new way to gain exposure to Ethereum, low trading volume shows they have yet to gain major mainstream interest. These ETFs were supposed to be a sustained catalyst for the price of Ethereum, but this has not been the case.\n\nEthereum Spot ETFs have also been in the talks, with ARK Invest filing the first application in early September. If granted approval, spot ETFs are more likely to have a better performance than futures ETFs.\n\nDespite Ethereum pushing over $1,700 on Monday after the launch of the futures ETFs, it has since lost all those gains. At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $1,630.\n\nETH price suffers as ETF volumes disappoint | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nFeatured image from Crypto News, chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

This pales in comparison to their Bitcoin-based counterparts, which boasted volumes a hundred times greater.\n\nBloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas suggests that these numbers are common for new ETFs but relatively low for Ethereum (ETH), given its market size.\n\nAccording to Balchunas, the top performer was Valkyrie\u2019s ETF, based on a combination of the first and second-largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, with a trading volume of $787,000.\n\nVanEck\u2019s Ethereum futures-only ETF had a modest volume of just over $300,000.\n\nPretty meh volume for the Ether Futures ETFs as a group, a little under $2m, about normal for a new ETF but vs $BITO (which did $200m in first 15min) it is low.

He revealed that the criminal organization was connected to the CCP, and 98% of Tron\u2019s total token supply was received by these 17 wallets.\n\nThe on-chain investigator also mentioned that cryptocurrency exchanges like Huobi Global, and cryptocurrencies like Shiba Inu may also be linked to the CCP and Wanxiang, a Chinese multinational conglomerate and the team that funded Ethereum Foundation wallets and Ethereum\u2019s Founder, Vitalik Buterin.\n\nETH prie falls back to mid $1,600s | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nInvestigations Cast Shadows On Ethereum\n\nThe crypto industry has experienced a series of Ponzi schemes and rug pulls for years now, causing investors and regulators to be wary of crypto exchanges and organizations in the space.\n\nWhile Tron is faced with speculations of being a well-orchestrated Ponzi scheme and having connections with the CCP, the revelation that Ethereum, the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency may be backed by the CCP and connected to companies involved in drug trafficking has left the crypto community in a paradox.\n\nAccording to BoringSleuth, the CCP is allegedly supporting Ethereum and other blockchains as well as multiple Decentralized Exchanges (DEX) and Centralized Exchanges (CEX) in the crypto space.\n\nThe crypto investigator utilized a previous transaction that saw the CCP receiving 133,700 ether on a single Genesis Block address owned by the party, as a reference to a connection between Ethereum and the CCP.\n\nBoringSleuth has also stated a potential connection between Ethereum\u2019s Founders and the CCP, which he said he would be revealing in detail soon.\n\nThe allegations faced by Tron and Ethereum come amid the increasing scrutiny of China\u2019s role in the cryptocurrency landscape. Although the crypto X community is presently reeling from the on-chain investigator\u2019s hypothesis, no concrete evidence linking Ethereum to the CCP has emerged, leaving the allegations in the realm of speculation.\n\nFeatured image from Medium, chart from Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

LINK\u2019s MVRV recently hit 20%.\n\nMVRV is the ratio of an asset\u2019s current market cap divided by its realized capitalization \u2013 i.e. the value of all measured LINK at the price they were bought. MVRV 30-Day is a timebound metric that only analyzes that ratio among tokens that have moved at least once in the past 30 days. Traders use the metric to detect overbought or oversold conditions.\n\nMartinez, however, believes that LINK will still hit higher highs after a brief correction. The 19th-ranked crypto asset by market cap is trading at $7.40 at time of writing.\n\nThe analyst also looks at Bitcoin (BTC), examining the top crypto asset\u2019s Relative Strength Index (RSI), a widely used momentum indicator that aims to determine if an asset is overbought or oversold.\n\nSays Martinez,\n\n\u201cNotice that each time the RSI on BTC 4-hour chart hits or surpasses 74.21, BTC tends to retrace. The RSI on the 4-hour chart recently hit 82.83!\u201d\n\nThe RSI indicator scales from 0 to 100.

Sure BTC could go to low $20,000s and ETH to low $1,000s and most everything long-tail (except SOL) can hit new lows, but when we look back on Q4 2023 and Q1 2024 it\u2019ll be clear it was a good time to be a buyer.\u201d\n\nThe trader says linear charts of several crypto assets indicate the market bottom is forming.\n\nLinear charts plot the change in the absolute price of an asset, while the logarithmic chart plots the relative change based on the percentage increase or decrease in an asset\u2019s value.\n\n\u201cTo not overcomplicate, I\u2019ll look at the long-term, linear charts. Just as it\u2019s easy to spot tops with those, it\u2019s easy to spot the general bottom range. From there, it\u2019s all about your own style of accumulation, with patience and persistence being commonalities of bottom-feeders.\u201d\n\nLooking at his Ethereum (ETH) chart, the trader shows that after a sudden dip, ETH is retesting both the 200-week simple moving average (SMA) and the 200-week exponential moving average (EMA) as support, which are key indicators traders use to determine market trends.\n\nETH is trading for $1,649 at time of writing, up 0.7% in the last 24 hours.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

The dollar value of these options is approximately $400 million.\n\nAdditionally, 200,000 ETH options are expiring with a max pain of $1,650 and around $330 million in notional value.\n\nJUST IN: $730,000,000 worth of #Bitcoin & Ethereum options expire Friday. \u2014 Watcher.Guru (@WatcherGuru) October 5, 2023\n\n$730,000 worth of Bitcoin & Ethereum options to expire Friday\n\nOptions expirations can lead to heightened volatility as market makers and speculators realign their positions around the expiry. However, trading volume and volatility have been muted in recent weeks. Historically, crypto markets tend to become more active in the fourth quarter, especially in October.\n\nWhile Bitcoin drove an uptrend earlier in the week, implied volatility levels remain subdued across major cryptos. Deteriorating market liquidity also presents the risk of larger price swings around the option expiry.\n\nAlso read: Ex-BlackRock Directors Predict Bitcoin Spot ETF Approval Within Months\n\nThe put-call ratio skews bearish at 0.89 for Bitcoin options and 0.87 for Ethereum options expiring this week. This indicates more put options betting on the downside were opened than calls betting on the upside. On August 25, 2023, crypto derivatives exchange Deribit settled $1.9 billion of Bitcoin options, highlighting the scale of what is at stake in these monthly expiries."

Six entities and their digital wallet addresses have now been flagged by the government, including five individuals and one company\u2014Valerian Labs.\n\n\u201cThe addresses identified by OFAC as part of this action collectively received just under $3.8 million worth of cryptocurrency, representing huge quantities of drugs potentially trafficked into the United States and other countries,\u201d wrote blockchain surveillance firm Chainalysis in a blog post on the matter.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA total of 17 wallet addresses were identified in OFAC\u2019s action, spanning networks including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Tron. Most illicit transactions on the latter two blockchains were received through stablecoins\u2014crypto tokens backed by relatively price-stable fiat currencies, such as U.S. dollars.\n\nBesides Valerian Labs, the five individuals\u2019 wallets are all hosted at the same centralized crypto exchange, where they each received \u201chundreds of thousands of dollars\u2019 worth of cryptocurrency.\u201d The exchange in question was not identified.\n\nEach wallet received funds through a long series of small transfers in \u201cconsistent amounts\u201d from both personal wallets and other mainstream exchanges. For Chainalysis, the pattern of consistent payments was \u201can indication of the sale of specific goods\u2014in this case, fentanyl and associated precursor chemicals.\u201d\n\nCrypto-based fentanyl sales worldwide are on the rise. In May, Chainalysis published a report finding that China-based fentanyl sellers have received $37.8 million worth of cryptocurrency since 2018.\n\nThough the U.S. Treasury has already sanctioned Bitcoin addresses linked to such suppliers, Tuesday\u2019s action is the first to target addresses on Tron. Last month, OFAC also sanctioned an Ethereum address tied to a member of a Mexican money laundering network who allegedly used crypto to transfer fentanyl proceeds across the border.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe sanctions against the individuals and businesses associated with this criminal network are an important step in preventing the abuse of cryptocurrency by drug traffickers, as well as a reminder of the depth of the problem,\u201d Chainalysis concluded."

The largest smart contracts token was the focal point of the crypto market as the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) raced to approve Ether futures exchange-traded funds (ETFs). However, the uptrend encountered headwinds leading to a decline back to the $1,600 range.\n\nThe bearish grip on ETH has continued to intensify, with the token remaining relatively unchanged over the last 24 hours and trading at $1,645 on Friday.

Investors are already looking forward to a bullish October, which has come to be known as the \u201cUptober.\u201d\n\nAnalysts and traders like Altcoin Sherpa believe the fourth quarter of 2023 is the time for Ethereum and other altcoins to shine.\n\n\u201cI expect an extremely explosive Q4 or early Q1, as it always happens.\u201d Altcoin Sherpa said via X. \u201cThese are arguably the best times of the year to trade.\u201d\n\nReading from the ETHBTC price chart, the trader said that he expects Ethereum price to bounce back hard.\n\n$ETH: The time is coming soon to scale into altcoins. I expect an extremely explosive Q4 or early Q1, as it always happens. These are arguably the best times of the year to trade.

The 21-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) (red) serving as the immediate support at $1,641 must hold in place, otherwise, this search would extend to $1,600.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) upholds the downward trend as it retests support at the midline. Traders interested in shorting Ether must check that the RSI continues to drop toward the oversold area below 30.\n\nMeanwhile, bullish traders should consider the possibility of Ethereum price bouncing back from the support currently provided by the falling channel. A retest of the previous resistance is often interpreted as bullish.\n\nOn the upside, a break above resistance at $1,750 would mean that Ethereum is holding above all the key moving averages, including the 21-day EMA, the 100-day EMA, and the 200-day EMA. Such a position would go a long way to lock in the uptrend, thus encouraging traders to consider longing ETH for a larger breakout to $2,000.\n\nRelated Articles"

However, van de Poppe expects \u201ctrendy coins\u201d to continue showing momentum despite the altcoin correction as long as BTC consolidates.\n\nLastly, van de Poppe says that the top crypto asset by market cap could rally to $30,000 as long as it can successfully retest the $26,700-$26,900 range.\n\n\u201cFew levels of importance for Bitcoin here. Holding above $27,200 would be substantial for upwards continuation, but preferably is a retest at $26,700-26,900 before we\u2019ll continue the rally to $30,000.

        "content": "Share this article URL Copied\n\nA new report from crypto brokerage firm K33 Research recommends reducing exposure to Ethereum in favor of Bitcoin after the muted launch of Ether futures ETFs last week.\n\nAccording to the report by Head of Research Anders Helseth and Senior Analyst Vetle Lunde, the freshly launched ETFs saw trading volumes reaching just 0.2% of the trading volumes seen for Bitcoin futures ETFs launched in 2021.\n\n\u201cIncreased institutional access will only create buying pressure if significant unsatiated demand exists. This is not the case for ETH at the moment,\u201d the analysts wrote.\n\nThe analysts argue the lukewarm response has more similarities to the 2017 CME Bitcoin futures debut than the excitement around 2021\u2019s Bitcoin ETFs, which saw immediate institutional demand.\n\nWhile the ETF approval represents a long-term watershed moment for Ethereum, the K33 report suggests reducing elevated Ether exposures for now until broader sentiment improves and institutions show renewed interest.\n\n\u201cWe believe it\u2019s time to pull the brakes on ETH and rotate back into BTC,\u201d the analyst wrote.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum both rose around 5% over the past week, though gave back nearly half of their gains leading to the disappointing ETF launch."

        "title": "Justin Sun Unstakes 20,000 Ethereum (ETH) From Lido Finance, What\u2019s Going On? - NewsBTC",
        "content": "A crypto wallet associated with Justin Sun, the co-founder of Tron, a smart contract platform, has moved 20,000 Ethereum (ETH) worth roughly $32.4 million from Lido Finance, a liquidity staking platform. Funds were transferred to Binance, the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange, trading volume and client count.\n\nThe transaction, executed in a single batch, was captured by The Data Nerd, an analysis platform, and shared on X on October 5. As it is, Ethereum (ETH) is under pressure, looking at the performance in the daily chart.\n\nEthereum Drops 4%, Are Bears Flowing Back?\n\nTrackers show that the coin is down roughly 4% in three days, confirming sellers of October 2. Notably, the daily chart has a double bar formation with the bear candlestick of October 2, completely reversing buyers of October 1.\n\nThis arrangement suggests that bears could be in control, especially considering the draw-down of the past few trading days and the level of participation on October 2 when the coin slipped.\n\nIn technical analysis, losses at the back of increasing volumes often point to high participation. If prices are rising, then the coin in question could rally. Conversely, a sell-off could worsen if the bar had high trading volumes.\n\nIt is also unclear whether Justin Sun plans to sell ETH after transferring coins to exchanges. Crypto transfers to centralized exchanges, which support many stablecoins like USDT and others, are often associated with sell-offs.\n\nMarket participants may interpret such movements as bearish, fueling the sell-off, subsequently heaping more pressure on prices. ETH is now at a one-week low.\n\nJustin Sun Shuffling ETH In 2023\n\nThe Data Nerd observes that prices fell the last time the wallet moved ETH to Huobi, which has since rebranded to HTX. In August, the wallet moved 5,000 ETH to HTX. The deposit came a week before ETH prices crashed 12%.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum prices fell sharply in mid-August, causing a \u201ccascade liquidation\u201d that spooked investors. ETH bulls have since failed to reverse those losses. Considering the relatively low trading volumes in the last two months, prices are still boxed within the August 17 trade range, a bearish signal.\n\nIn late February 2023, Justin Sun staked 150,000 ETH, worth roughly $240 million, to Lido Finance. The transfer remains the largest single-stay transaction, forcing the liquidity staking provider to activate the Staking Rate Limit feature, capping the amount of coins one can stake at 150,000 ETH.\n\nLido Finance said the feature is more of a \u201csafety valve\u201d that \u201caddresses possible side-effects such as rewards dilution, without needing to pause stake deposits explicitly.\u201d\n\nFeature image from Canva, chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Share:\n\nBitcoin price has a chance at the $30,000 psychological level if it overcomes the $28,200 barrier.\n\nEthereum price could extend the fall with a pending sell signal about to execute. Traders should watch for $1,585 level.\n\nRipple price coils up and could breach the $0.5604 hurdle in the next lift-off.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price is showing that volatility could be coming back to the market, with the same case going for Ethereum (ETH) price as the two giants recently recorded tight consolidation. Meanwhile, Ripple (XRP) price is trying to overcome a crucial hurdle, standing at a crossroads in a make-or-break moment for holders.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin bull market awaits as US faces 'bear steepener' \u2013 Arthur Hayes\n\nBitcoin price needs to clear $28,200 first\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price is sitting on strong support downward, presented by the 100-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $27,331 and the confluence between the 50- and 200-day EMAs around the $26,988 level.\n\nThe odds still favor the upside, with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) above 50 and the Awesome Oscillators (AO) histograms still green in the positive territory.\n\nThe level to beat at this point is the $28,200 hurdle, which has proven formidable since the August 17 crash. A break and close above it would give Bitcoin price a chance at contending with the previous range low at $28,708.\n\nReclaiming above levels last seen pre-Evergrande catastrophe and SpaceX rumors, would make $30,000 psychological level plausible, potentially even going as high as the $31,172 range high.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-day chart\n\nConversely, if Bitcoin price folds and closes below the critical support at $26,988, it could invalidate the bullish outlook, potentially dropping to the September 25 lows around the psychological $26,000, or in the dire case, extend the losses to the range low at $25,140. Such a move would constitute an 8% fall below current levels.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin price will likely hit $22,800 before 2024 should it follow its nine-year pattern\n\nEthereum price is not done with the downtrend\n\nEthereum (ETH) price could extend the ongoing slump and test the demand zone at the $1,600 psychological level. This view is reinforced by the RSI about to execute a sell signal by crossing below the signal line (yellow) band.\n\nA break and close below the midline of this order block (ranging between $1,600 and $1,571) at $1,585 would confirm a downtrend, bringing the $1,552 range low in sight. The AO histogram bars are already turning red, suggesting bears are having their say.\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the flip side, if Ethereum price can flip the 50-day EMA back to a support floor at $1,667, prospects for more gain would revitalized, confirmed by a decisive candlestick close above the 200-day EMA at $1,731. ETH could target the supply zone at $1,733 from here.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum ETFs fail to live up to hype: combined trading volume amounts to just $1.7 million\n\nRipple price readies for a steep climb\n\nRipple (XRP) price continues along an ascending trendline, invigorated by a positive development in the SEC vs. Ripple case. The RSI position above 50 spurs optimism and could make another move north soon as momentum grows.\n\nThe AO histogram bars support this stance, and Ripple price could shatter the $0.5604 level soon. A break and close above this level would set the tone for XRP to target the supply zone between the $0.6146 and $0.6432 range.\n\nXRP/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the other hand, profit booking could cut the rally short, sending Ripple price below the support offered by the ascending trendline at $0.5199, its confluence with the 200 EMA. A decisive candlestick close below the $0.5000 psychological level would invalidate the bullish outlook.\n\nAlso Read: Ripple victory over SEC reaffirmed as Judge Torres denies regulator\u2019s motion to appeal"

        "title": "Top Blockchains With the Most Daily Active Developers (DADs) - Bitcoin Market Journal",
        "content": "At Bitcoin Market Journal, we talk a lot about Daily Active Users (DAUs), and today, we\u2019ll look at a different type of daily active user: the developer.\n\nThese are the people actively creating the blockchains we use. And they are just as important to growth as the end-user. Developer contributions directly impact crypto projects\u2019 valuation, stability, and future.\n\nIn this article, we\u2019re going to cover some of the central questions about DAD and its importance for investors:\n\nWho are daily active developers?\n\nWhat role do they play in blockchain ecosystems?\n\nWhat can crypto investors learn from a fundamental analysis of DAD metrics?\n\nHow do the numbers and growth in daily active developers compare with that of daily active users regarding the overall value of the blockchain?\n\nWhat are Daily Active Developers?\n\nIn simple terms, anyone actively involved in the regular development and maintenance of software in the blockchain space is called a daily active developer (DAD). The term can be used to refer to both individual developers and developer teams.\n\nElectric Capital, compiler of the blockchain Developer Reports, looks at blockchain projects from the perspective of open-source commits to projects through platforms like Github. In other words, \u201cactive developers\u201d are actively making and publishing changes to the blockchain\u2019s code.\n\nDADs come from diverse backgrounds and work in various capacities from all over the globe. We can broadly divide DADs into the following categories:\n\nCore Development Teams : The major cryptocurrencies have underlying blockchain protocols. The development and maintenance of these protocols are handled by teams of software developers, engineers, and data scientists. They are typically at the forefront of innovation in the blockchain space.\n\n: The major cryptocurrencies have underlying blockchain protocols. The development and maintenance of these protocols are handled by teams of software developers, engineers, and data scientists. They are typically at the forefront of innovation in the blockchain space. Independent Contributors : Open-source development plays a crucial role in crypto. Outside core teams, thousands of independent developers and blockchain enthusiasts contribute their time and expertise to improve specific features or look for bug fixes in crypto projects, often voluntarily.\n\n: Open-source development plays a crucial role in crypto. Outside core teams, thousands of independent developers and blockchain enthusiasts contribute their time and expertise to improve specific features or look for bug fixes in crypto projects, often voluntarily. Startups and Service Providers : Employees of blockchain-based startups and major companies also fall under the definition of daily active developers. They are usually involved in developing wallet services, dApps, smart contracts, and other crypto projects.\n\n: Employees of blockchain-based startups and major companies also fall under the definition of daily active developers. They are usually involved in developing wallet services, dApps, smart contracts, and other crypto projects. Academic Researchers: Universities and research institutions also play a defining role in crypto. Various protocols and blockchains often start as research projects involving professors and students in an academic setting. For example, the Zcash crypto project started at Johns Hopkins University in 2013.\n\nWhat Do Active Developers Do?\n\nDADs are the brains behind blockchains. The blockchain ecosystem wouldn\u2019t exist without the contributions of these developers. They are the ones who develop a blockchain protocol codebase from scratch, creating core functionalities and features.\n\nYou need active developers to test the code, fix bugs, optimize performance, improve security, patch out vulnerabilities, provide community support, offer technical assistance, create documentation, and conduct other forms of routine maintenance.\n\nEverything in the crypto sphere relies on developer output, from protocol hard forks and upgrades to new smart contracts and dapps. Many senior DADs also work in crypto governance roles. Vitalik Buterin, the co-creator of Ethereum, is an excellent example of this.\n\nWhy Measure Daily Active Developers?\n\nCrypto investors can glean valuable insights by closely examining the active developers behind a particular blockchain, project, or app. Here are some key performance indicators that tell us a blockchain project is getting traction:\n\nDeveloper Interest : When many developers consistently flock to a protocol, it is usually a good indicator of the project\u2019s long-term viability. For example, due to its large number of developers, Ethereum is widely expected to overtake bitcoin at some point and become the world\u2019s most valuable crypto \u2013 an event dubbed \u201cthe flippening.\u201d\n\n: When many developers consistently flock to a protocol, it is usually a good indicator of the project\u2019s long-term viability. For example, due to its large number of developers, Ethereum is widely expected to overtake bitcoin at some point and become the world\u2019s most valuable crypto \u2013 an event dubbed \u201cthe flippening.\u201d Not surprisingly, Ethereum has consistently ranked at the top of the pile in daily active developers. At 5,946 in June 2023, it has nearly three times as many total developers as the next-highest project (Polkadot). High levels of developer interest are usually an indicator of the stability, maturity, and long-term viability of a blockchain project.\n\nCompetitive Advantage : Skilled talent is needed in any IT field. The same is also true in crypto, especially during growth markets like 2022. There is extreme competition between various projects and companies for talented developers. If a project retains or increases its DAD counts, it is usually a sign of its advantage over its competitors.\n\n: Skilled talent is needed in any IT field. The same is also true in crypto, especially during growth markets like 2022. There is extreme competition between various projects and companies for talented developers. If a project retains or increases its DAD counts, it is usually a sign of its advantage over its competitors. Again, Ethereum leaves all other blockchain projects in the dust here. The number of full-time developers at Ethereum has increased by 35% since 2021, indicating high activity levels across its ecosystem. More DADs improve a project\u2019s ability to polish existing features, innovate, and gain a competitive advantage.\n\nCommunity Support and Engagement : Hype often plays a critical role in the early stages of a crypto project. It is useful to increase awareness among users and eventually develop a community around the project. Having many active developers, especially those who actively post on social media about the project, is a good sign.\n\n: Hype often plays a critical role in the early stages of a crypto project. It is useful to increase awareness among users and eventually develop a community around the project. Having many active developers, especially those who actively post on social media about the project, is a good sign. Constant interaction between users and developers can also contribute to the evolution of the project. It creates feedback loops that allow developers to find problems faster and figure out essential features for improved user experience.\n\nDADs as an Investor Valuation Metric\n\nThe market price, token supply, token ownership, market cap, and daily active users are all valuable metrics for evaluating cryptocurrencies. However, these metrics are largely focused on the demand side of the equation.\n\nA balanced assessment of crypto requires an in-depth understanding of the supply side as well. Supply metrics from a crypto POV include tokenomics, governance, security, bug hunting, smart contract support, cross-chain interoperability, and more.\n\nAll this requires massive volumes of software code. The number of available developers will determine a project\u2019s ability to manage these responsibilities and complete critical tasks quickly.\n\nIn short, the contributions from DADs affect cryptocurrency valuation in the following ways:\n\nProject Health : The size of a project\u2019s developer community can tell you a lot about what people in the know think about its viability and prospects. A higher number of DADs indicate that the crypto is healthy and vibrant.\n\n: The size of a project\u2019s developer community can tell you a lot about what people in the know think about its viability and prospects.

Stability and Security : The codebase of cryptocurrencies is constantly threatened by hackers and cybercriminals looking for flaws and vulnerabilities. Having more hands on deck for patching, bug fixing, and code reviews helps improve the stability and minimize the security risks of crypto.\n\n: The codebase of cryptocurrencies is constantly threatened by hackers and cybercriminals looking for flaws and vulnerabilities. Having more hands on deck for patching, bug fixing, and code reviews helps improve the stability and minimize the security risks of crypto.

A higher DAD count indicates that the crypto is more likely to succeed.\n\n: Crypto projects must continue. They must constantly improve and evolve, adding new features and use cases to drive user adoption. A higher DAD count indicates that the crypto is more likely to succeed. Trust and Market Perception: For insights, seasoned investors and crypto users look at the developer community behind cryptos. A strong and active DAD community helps build trust and confidence in the project among users, investors, and other stakeholders. Solana, which has been under pressure due to its connection with FTX, is a good example.\n\nThe Relationship Between DADs and Users\n\nThe \u201cnetwork effect\u201d is an economic concept where the value of a network increases exponentially as more people use it. It has played a critical role in many industries in recent years, including social media and e-commerce platforms.\n\nIn crypto, the rise of most tokens can be attributed to the network effect. It involves a close relationship between developers and users through several dynamic stages:\n\nThe User Adoption Stage : The process starts with creating the initial codebase of the project. The development team then markets the project among potential users by publishing whitepapers, social media, airdrops, influencers, and bounty programs.\n\n: The process starts with creating the initial codebase of the project. The development team then markets the project among potential users by publishing whitepapers, social media, airdrops, influencers, and bounty programs. Community engagement is critical here. Developers often engage in forum discussions, conduct AMA sessions, and answer queries on social media handles to interact with their audience and increase awareness about the project.\n\nCommunity Building : In the second stage, the continued interaction between developers and users helps amplify the network effect in several ways. It increases trust in the project and helps it gain credibility. High engagement levels eventually lead to strong communities that market the crypto to other potential users.\n\n: In the second stage, the continued interaction between developers and users helps amplify the network effect in several ways.

Support from developers helps the project become more user-friendly, increasing its adoption rate.\n\n: When developers constantly interact with users, the result is a mutually beneficial exchange of information. Support from developers helps the project become more user-friendly, increasing its adoption rate. Developers also gain valuable feedback and constructive criticism from daily users of the crypto/project. They can use these insights to improve the codebase further, identify potential security threats early, and generate more user value.\n\nWhen a team consistently delivers exciting new features, quality-of-life improvements, and bug fixes to a software project, you will generally see a steady uptick in active users. Having more DADs can help crypto attract more daily active users.\n\nBitcoin, NEAR, Ethereum, and BNB are all on top of our list of blockchains with the most daily active users. These are also crypto ecosystems with hundreds of full-time developers, according to the latest figures from DeveloperReport.com.\n\nEmerging Ecosystems and Small Chains\n\nSince 2020, the crypto market has launched hundreds of new blockchain projects, including Layer-1 protocols. While most of these have faded into obscurity, several notable exceptions exist.\n\nFrom a daily active developer count perspective, three stand out as of this writing: Sui, Aptos, and Osmosis. The Sui Network recorded a 444% increase in its full-time developer count in 2023, coinciding with the launch of its token in April 2023.\n\nAptos has been around since early 2022, increasing its DAD count by 191%. Launched in June 2021, Osmosis has increased its total developer count by 296% over two years. All three projects have between 200 and 300 total developers as of this writing.\n\nTo put things in perspective, other established blockchains have clocked a decline in developer counts since the beginning of the bear market in 2022 \u2013 examples include Algorand (-63%), Avalanche (-57%), and NEAR (-51%).\n\nAptos and Sui have received millions of dollars in funding from major investors like a16z, Binance Labs, Accel Partners, Tiger Global, and Multicoin Capital. Similarly, Osmosis Labs counts Paradigm and Ethereal Ventures among its main backers.\n\nIn market cap, Aptos is ranked 36, Sui is 88, and Osmosis is much lower at 157. And yet, these emerging blockchain ecosystems manage to attract both investors and developers, indicating considerable future growth potential.\n\nThey highlight the importance of looking beyond price and market cap when researching new crypto investments. Factors like investor funding activity and rising developer counts often hint at the future growth potential of emerging ecosystems.\n\nInvestor Takeaway\n\nThe spectacular market crash in 2022 resulted in $2 trillion in crypto losses. Major tokens like Bitcoin and Ethereum lost over 60% of their peak valuation. And yet, we only saw a marginal decrease in daily active developer counts between 2022 and 2023.\n\nMore crucially, the developers contributing over 80% of the code commits for years are still actively involved in crypto. Most developers are in crypto for the long haul, boding well for the industry's long-term growth.\n\nAs crypto winter leads to spring, this is another reason investors need to include DADs as a metric for fundamental research in crypto.\n\nDevelopers are the architects of crypto\u2019s fundamental infrastructure. They build and maintain the codebase, interact with users, and help in community growth. Development and innovation are necessary for growth in crypto, and developers are the bellwether for both.\n\nSubscribe to Bitcoin Market Journal to learn about the metrics that make blockchain and crypto the most valuable assets."

        "content": "Despite going through an extended crypto bear market, the most recent approvals and launches of multiple Ether Futures ETFs have boosted institutional investors\u2019 interest in the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap: Ethereum (ETH).\n\nOn October 2, six Ether Futures financial products started to be officially traded. They are, as follows, with their respective net expense ratios, according to CNBC:\n\nBitWise Ethereum Strategy ETF (AETH), 0.85%\n\nBitwise Bitcoin and Ether Equal Weight Strategy ETF (BTOP), 0.85%\n\nProShares Ether Strategy ETF (EETH), 0.95%\n\nProShares Bitcoin & Ether Equal Weight Strategy ETF (BETE), 0.95%\n\nBitcoin & Ether Market Cap Weight Strategy ETF (BETH), 0.95%\n\nVanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF (EFUT), 0.66%\n\nIn this context, James Butterfill \u2014 Head of Research at CoinShares Co. \u2014 reported an institutional inflow of $13 million in Ethereum products by October 4, being the first net-positive week in a seven-week run.\n\nNotably, Butterfill said that this current inflow could not be compared to the $200 million of institutional investors\u2019 capital inflow for Bitcoin (BTC) during the launch of the Bitcoin Futures ETF by ProShares in 2021, which can be explained by the current bearish market cycle, in opposed to 2021\u2019s euphoric bull market.\n\nFollowing the launch of various futures based Ethereum ETF launches in the US, we have seen US$13m of inflows so far this week, breaking a 7 week run of outflows.\n\n\n\nIt is well below the US$200m in the first day for futures based Bitcoin ETFs in the US. But then, we aren't in the\u2026 pic.twitter.com/PafFR2h3G8 \u2014 James Butterfill (@jbutterfill) October 4, 2023\n\nInstitutional investors\u2019 flows amid an extended bear market\n\nNevertheless, the extended bear market is still visible among institutional investors\u2019 money flow.

        "content": "BLOCKCHAIN BAKE-OFF! In July, when the smart-contracts blockchain Celo proposed to ditch its independent \u201clayer-1\u201d status in favor of becoming a layer 2 network atop Ethereum, the people behind the project may have had little inkling of just how popular they would become. Now there\u2019s suddenly a burst of competition among veteran layer-2 teams to supply the technology for Celo\u2019s new system. The migration initially was supposed to rely on Optimism\u2019s OP Stack software kit, which served as the template not only for Coinbase\u2019s new Base blockchain but also the Binance-incubated BNB Chain\u2019s new opBNB network. Then last month, Polygon injected itself into the mix, offering up its Polygon Chain Development Kit, known as Polygon CDK, as an alternative. As of last week, there\u2019s yet another suitor to host Celo: Matter Labs, the creators of another rollup, zkSync, as well as the ZK Stack open-source software, which can be used to create new \u201chyperchains\u201d on Ethereum. \u201cThe modular and open-sourced ZK Stack is the optimal L2 stack for Celo\u2019s transition to Ethereum,\u201d according to the Matter Labs proposal. \u201cWe hope to trigger an honest, open discussion amongst the Celo and zkSync communities regarding the tradeoffs between the ZK Stack, the OP Stack, Polygon CDK and other options.\u201d Coming in the depths of crypto winter, the episode offers a reminder of the intensity of the consolidation trend, with the various networks scrambling to find fresh business."

        "content": "Key takeaways\n\nSolana (SOL) has become one of the most decentralized blockchain networks in addition to being one of the most scalable after reporting that its Nakamoto Coefficient score beats other leading chains\n\nA second validator client plus the addition of more nodes into the network have helped to improve the resilience of the blockchain following several major outages during its first 2 years\n\nCoinCodex price prediction algorithm expects SOL to surge in 2024\n\nSolana releases Validator Health Report for October showing major improvement to network decentralization\n\nSolana (SOL) has revealed that its Nakamoto Coefficient score now beats several leading blockchains in its Validator Health Report for October 2023. The report shows that Solana has experienced a steady improvement to the health and growth of its blockchain, with several major changes helping to improve the level of decentralization.\n\n1/ The most recent @Solana Validator Health Report is now published.\n\n\n\nSolana remains one of the largest proof-of-stake networks by node count, one of the most distributed by Nakamoto Coefficient, and now, one of the most resilient by validator clients.\n\n\n\n?https://t.co/84tag5MBCO pic.twitter.com/fRQl1Fb5t9 \u2014 Solana Foundation (@SolanaFndn) October 4, 2023\n\nThe Nakamoto Coefficient measures the least number of nodes required to successfully attack a blockchain. Since a blockchain is a distributed computer network that runs a consensus protocol in order to agree on the correct order of transactions, most blockchains can be successfully attacked if a single party gains control of the majority of nodes in the system.\n\nThe coefficient was designed by former Coinbase CTO Balaji Srinivasan to provide a measure for the level of decentralization, and by extension, the robustness of a given blockchain network. Solana\u2019s announcement that it is now more decentralized when compared against other leading chains follows a series of positive developments for the project.\n\nSolana\u2019s Nakamoto Coefficient score now beats Ethereum (ETH), Avalanche (AVAX), Cosmos (ATOM), and Polygon (MATIC), to name a few. The project has shared a detailed breakdown for the health of the Solana network in its recent Validator Report, discussing a range of key developments that have helped the network to improve the health of the network.\n\nPreviously, Solana had been criticized for being less decentralized than its competitors \u2014 a problem that caused several network outages during its first 2 years on mainnet. A new validator client created by Jito Labs was cited as a key reason why this is unlikely to occur again, and there are two additional validator clients currently in development that can further improve network resilience.\n\nMost notably, the Solana network now contains more nodes than many major blockchains, in addition to these nodes being more widely distributed. This has given Solana a Nakamoto Coefficient score of 31, beating out Ethereum\u2019s 25 and Avalanche\u2019s 27 respectively. This news means that Solana is now one of the most decentralized blockchains in addition to being one of the most scalable.\n\nFollowing spree of positive developments, algorithm predicts +343% move for SOL in the next 12 months\n\nSOL has outperformed the rest of the crypto market during 2023, owing to a particularly poor performance in 2022. The SOL token suffered a -78% loss in the aftermath of the FTX collapse, as investors may have lost confidence in a project that was strongly backed by both FTX and Alameda Research.\n\nYear-to-date, SOL has risen 133%, outperforming the total crypto market cap (TCAP) which has risen 41% in the same time frame. The CoinCodex price prediction algorithm expects SOL to continue its recovery over the next 12 months, forecasting a +343.67% move by 4th October 2024.\n\n1-year price prediction for Solana, via CoinCodex\n\nBottom line: Solana continues to optimize its network, improving robustness and decentralization\n\nDecentralized computer systems rely on the trusted nature of the majority of participants, while also providing financial incentives to help ensure the efficacy of the consensus protocol. The more decentralized a network is, the more robust it becomes, and Solana\u2019s recent achievement of becoming one of the most decentralized proof-of-stake networks is another major success for the project."

        "content": "Press Releases are sponsored content and not a part of Finbold's editorial content. For a full disclaimer, please click here. If you encounter any issues, kindly report them to [email protected]. Crypto assets/products can be highly risky. Never invest unless you\u2019re prepared to lose all the money you invest.\n\nOctober is shaping up to be an eventful month for the crypto market, with prices showing increased volatility in recent weeks.\n\nMajor cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP could face uncertain conditions that could significantly impact their value.\n\nThis article will provide price predictions for these three cryptos before highlighting one brand-new altcoin that could be poised to surge in October.\n\nBitcoin Faces Resistance at $28k \u2013 But Could Push Higher\n\nFirst up is Bitcoin (BTC), which has had a wild ride in 2023 and is up 65% year-to-date (YTD).\n\nAt the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $27,530 and appears to be forming higher highs and lower highs on the daily price chart \u2013 indicating a strong uptrend.\n\nHowever, this uptrend could be challenged, with BTC rejecting the resistance zone at $28,000 on October 2.\n\nThis resistance zone was also tested on August 29, suggesting it is a significant barrier to Bitcoin\u2019s upward momentum.\n\nThe good news for BTC bulls is that price has yet to react aggressively to this level, meaning the current pullback may only be temporary.\n\nIn the last day, BTC\u2019s price has been trading sideways on the daily chart, yet zooming in to the 4-hour time frame reveals that the bullish momentum may be resuming on a smaller scale.\n\nThis hints that Bitcoin could be poised to test $28,000 once more in the near term.\n\nNotably, crypto experts at Changelly expect the average Bitcoin price to be $30,633 in October, with the minimum price forecast at $26.966.\n\nSupporting this is an analyst\u2019s post on the Binance Feed, stating that BTC must settle above $28,500 if it has any chance of hitting $30,000 by the end of the month.\n\nIf BTC hits this key threshold, it would represent a gain of 8.80% from today\u2019s price.\n\nEthereum ETF Launch Fails to Excite as ETH Faces Downside Pressure\n\nEthereum (ETH) could also be set for an exciting October, mainly due to the recent launch of nine ETH futures ETFs.\n\nAlthough these ETFs saw muted volume on their first day of trading, this could change as more institutional investors begin to allocate resources to them.\n\nUnfortunately for ETH bulls, the launch of futures ETFs didn\u2019t positively affect the token\u2019s value, which is down 6% since Sunday\u2019s high.\n\nETH is currently trading around $1,647 and has breached a minor support zone at $1,650.\n\nAnalysts from AMBCrypto have previously forecast Ethereum\u2019s average price for 2023 will be $2,190 \u2013 which indicates that ETH could be in for significant upside potential in the weeks ahead if their forecast holds true.\n\nThis sentiment was reinforced by YouTube analyst Crypto World, who told his audience of 139,000 subscribers that ETH could return to $1,740 if the price bounced from its current level.\n\nHowever, with ETH having posted two bearish daily closes in a row and heading for a third, this outlook may be challenged sooner rather than later.\n\nETH is still up 37% YTD, yet trading volume has dropped 27% in the past day, potentially indicating investor sentiment around the token could be waning.\n\nAll things considered, the coming weeks will be crucial in determining whether ETH can regain its bullish momentum and head back above $1,740 by the end of October.\n\nXRP Builds Momentum After SEC Rejection, But Gains Prove Short-Lived\n\nLastly, XRP (XRP) is also a token to watch in October, given the latest news regarding Ripple Labs\u2019 long-running legal battle with the SEC.\n\nOn October 3, Judge Analisa Torres denied the SEC\u2019s motion to appeal July\u2019s favorable ruling in what was seen as a major victory for Ripple Labs.\n\nAlthough Ripple Labs and the SEC will still be going to trial in April 2024 regarding other issues, the momentum appears to be on Ripple Labs\u2019 side.\n\nSurprisingly, this announcement didn\u2019t significantly affect the price of XRP, which only rose around 7% on the news.\n\nXRP has now given back a significant portion of these gains, with price rejecting the minor resistance zone at $0.540.\n\nHowever, many in the crypto community are still bullish on the token\u2019s prospects.\n\nXRP Whale, a crypto commentator on Twitter, asked his followers, \u201cWho\u2019s ready for $5?\u201d indicating that he believes there\u2019s tremendous upside for XRP.\n\nThis sentiment was reinforced by a YouTube video from NCashOfficial, who laid out a pathway for XRP to hit between $25 and $45 in the coming years.\n\nAlthough these bullish predictions certainly catch the eye, October is likely to be more muted for XRP as the token finds its feet \u2013 with a price target of $0.065 being a more likely outcome.\n\nWhich Other Cryptos Could Post Gains in October?\n\nAlthough Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP will likely be three of the most talked-about cryptocurrencies this month, other altcoins could be poised for growth.\n\nOne altcoin gaining traction in this regard is Bitcoin Minetrix, which has raised over $450,000 during its ongoing presale phase.\n\nBitcoin Minetrix Presale Builds Momentum as Stake-to-Mine Mechanism Grips Investors\n\nBitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX) is an innovative platform that lets users earn Bitcoin through a staking model called \u201cStake-to-Mine.\u201d\n\nThis model allows participation in the crypto mining space without the need for expensive hardware or advanced technical knowledge.\n\nBitcoin Minetrix\u2019s team is conducting a presale before the project\u2019s official launch, with BTCMTX tokens on offer for $0.011.\n\nThe presale will be split into ten stages, each with its own price point \u2013 meaning those who invest early will be rewarded with a more favorable rate for acquiring BTCMTX tokens.\n\nMany analysts are bullish on Bitcoin Minetrix\u2019s potential, including YouTuber Michael Wrubel, who highlighted the developers\u2019 comprehensive roadmap as a strong indicator of the project\u2019s long-term success.\n\nBitcoin Minetrix\u2019s potential is also evidenced by the strong response from the social media community, with hundreds of people following the project\u2019s X (formerly Twitter) account over the past week.\n\nGiven that Bitcoin Minetrix solves the major issues plaguing traditional cloud mining systems, like a lack of user control and transparency, it\u2019s no surprise that the project is garnering early attention.\n\nWith BTCMTX tokens expected to debut on several major exchanges before the end of the year, Bitcoin Minetrix could be another project worth watching in the near term.\n\nVisit Bitcoin Minetrix Presale"

        "content": "Image: Shutterstock\n\nOn 2 October, UBS Asset Management announced the launch of its first live pilot of a tokenised variable capital company (VCC) fund. The initiative is part of the Monetary Authority of Singapore\u2019s (MAS) Project Guardian to bring real-world assets on the blockchain.To carry out this controlled pilot, UBS will leverage its in-house tokenisation service, UBS Tokenise. Using a smart contract on the Ethereum public blockchain, the pilot will allow UBS Asset Management to perform various operations, including fund subscriptions and redemptions, seamlessly.The pilot aligns perfectly with UBS Asset Management\u2019s global distributed ledger technology strategy to leverage blockchain technology, both public and private, for efficient fund issuance and distribution. This initiative contributes to the broader expansion of UBS\u2019s tokenisation services, marking a pivotal moment in their digital asset journey.Thomas Kaegi, Head of UBS Asset Management, Singapore and Southeast Asia, expressed that the recent development is a significant step in understanding the tokenisation of funds. He added, \u201cThrough this exploratory initiative, we will work with traditional financial institutions and fintech providers to help understand how to improve market liquidity and market access for clients.\u201dUBS has been at the forefront of developing innovative digital assets. In November 2022, it launched the world\u2019s first publicly traded digital bond - a 375 million Swiss franc-denominated three-year bond with a 2.33% coupon, which has the same instrument structure, legal status, and rating as a traditional UBS senior unsecured note.In June 2023, the UBS Tokenise platform was utilised in Hong Kong to issue digital structured notes by Bank of China Investment (BOCI), amounting to CNH 200 million ($27.3 million). These tokenised notes were created and issued on the Ethereum blockchain.Following the successful rollout of UBS\u2019s first pilot transactions, the asset management firm plans to continue with more live pilot use cases under Project Guardian, working with a broader range of partners and exploring different investment strategies. These collaborations would enhance market liquidity for the clients by gaining valuable insights.Although UBS tokenised service and VCC fund are relatively new, as these innovative solutions continue to evolve and gain traction, they can reshape the digital asset landscape and the financial system in the upcoming years."

        "title": "Wrapped Crypto Tokens, Explained - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "What is a wrapped token? Tokens are wrapped to make them usable on a different blockchain or in a particular environment to which they are not native. A wrapped token is a sort of cryptocurrency or digital asset that is backed by another coin or asset, often one that is native to a particular blockchain or network, or that is \u201cwrapped\u201d by it. But why are wrapped tokens important? Wrapped tokens are especially beneficial for cross-chain interoperability and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. They enable users to take advantage of the various features and services provided on several blockchains by allowing assets from one blockchain to be used easily on another. Depending on the exact use case and architecture of the wrapping mechanism, wrapped tokens can represent a broad variety of assets, including cryptocurrencies, stablecoins and even nonfungible tokens (NFTs). For instance, Wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC) is a well-known example on the Ethereum network. But what is Wrapped Bitcoin? WBTC represents Bitcoin (BTC) and enables users to communicate with Ethereum-based DeFi protocols and decentralized exchanges (DEXs) while preserving Bitcoin\u2019s intrinsic value and characteristics.\n\nHow do wrapped tokens work? When working with platforms for decentralized applications and DeFi that utilize many blockchains, wrapped tokens are very helpful. Here\u2019s how wrapped tokens work: Asset locking A specific amount of the native coin of one blockchain (such as Ethereum) is \u201clocked\u201d into a smart contract in order to generate a wrapped token. A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) or a trusted entity usually keeps an eye on this locking procedure. To create wrapped tokens, the locked native coin is used as collateral. Issuance of wrapped tokens After the original cryptocurrency is locked, a corresponding number of wrapped tokens are created or released on a different blockchain (for example, a wrapped version of Bitcoin known as wBTC is released on the Ethereum blockchain). Within the ecosystem of the second blockchain, these wrapped tokens, which stand in for ownership of the locked native coin, can be freely traded.\n\nTypes of wrapped tokens Various types of wrapped tokens include wBTC, wETH, stablecoin equivalents and blockchain-specific wrapped tokens. Wrapped tokens are designed to operate in harmony with particular blockchain settings, enabling the fusion of many assets into a single ecosystem. Wrapped Bitcoin, one of the many varieties of wrapped tokens, is a prime example; it enables BTC owners to use their holdings in Ethereum\u2019s decentralized applications and on DeFi platforms. The Ethereum network is similarly made more efficient via Wrapped Ether (wETH), which facilitates trading and smart contract interactions. Similarly, stablecoins can be easily used across several blockchain ecosystems because of the wrapped equivalents of stablecoins, such as Tether (USDT), USD Coin (USDC) and Dai (DAI). Additionally, some blockchains host their own wrapped tokens, such as BNB Smart Chain (BSC) and Polygon, fostering cross-chain compatibility and enabling a variety of decentralized use cases. In the constantly changing cryptocurrency ecosystem, these tokens play a crucial role in bridging the gap between blockchain networks, improving liquidity, fostering interoperability and extending accessibility.\n\nWhat are the benefits of wrapped tokens? Wrapped tokens enhance cross-chain compatibility, liquidity and asset functionality, fostering a more interconnected and versatile cryptocurrency ecosystem. In the world of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, wrapped tokens offer advantages. Firstly, they promote cross-chain interoperability, enabling the seamless integration of assets from many blockchains into a specific ecosystem. This improves users\u2019 access to a greater variety of assets and liquidity. Secondly, wrapped tokens can make it easier to integrate assets with other functionality. For example, wBTC can be used to integrate Bitcoin into the Ethereum DeFi ecosystem. They also standardize and simplify asset interactions, making them simpler to use. Additionally, wrapped tokens encourage decentralization by giving users more power over their assets. The utility, accessibility and adaptability of digital assets are significantly increased by these tokens across a variety of blockchain networks, encouraging a more connected and dynamic crypto economy."

Now with Ethereum\u2019s Name Service, many of the best names are taken and that ship has sailed.\n\nBut they aren\u2019t the only game in town. In fact, there\u2019s a great new decentralized name service on the market that\u2019s all about freedom and opportunity. And unlike waiting to flip a domain to see if you can make money, with this new service you are their partner and you make money just by minting a new domain. Curious about ENS? Let\u2019s check out some top naming services.\n\n1) ENS\n\nBy now most of you know the Ethereum Name Service. And it has lots of cool things that it can do. And if you were early, you were able to get some cool vanity names like: [Your First Name]. Eth. Those days are long gone now. While we like ENS and what it can do, here are some common complaints and shortcomings of ENS domains\n\nPay Yearly\n\nYou have to pay annual renewals for your ENS name. Many think if you are bothering to mint an NFT and pay for it it should be forever or until YOU decide to sell.\n\n\ud83d\udd39 https://t.co/go7SpAItLU v2.8 update! \ud83d\udd39 \u2b2b Improvements and anti-spam features in our Direct Messages \u2013 message any .eth @ensdomains address! \ud83d\ude0d (on @xmtp_) \u2b2b Improved HOME and ACTIVITY feeds where you can see your own and your friends activity! \ud83c\udf89 \u2014 Eth.co (@ethdotco) September 29, 2023\n\nOnly .eth\n\nYou can\u2019t register .com or other top-level domains. Only.eth. Some see this as limiting.\n\nBest Names Are Taken\n\nENS has been around for a long time. So all the best names have been taken. No one expects to be able to access Vitalik.eth but it would be cool if at least some names we really liked were available to mint now.\n\nOur next name service will give us some options like this.\n\nFlipping Only Way to Make Money\n\nThe only way to make money using ENS to buy names is to buy, hold, and flip. This means you have to wait for someone to reach out to you or try to find a marketplace where you can buy and sell them like OpenSea.\n\nENS 101: Avatars ENS names can have an associated avatar, enabled via a standard text record These avatars can be a simple picture, but ENS names can also utilize other NFTs as their avatars Check out our support page to learn more about ENS avatars\ud83d\udc47https://t.co/XY1FmU50H2 pic.twitter.com/l8HPy6qKtT \u2014 ens.eth (@ensdomains) September 15, 2023\n\nAll that said, ENS is a great service. But it\u2019s not the only one. And maybe you don\u2019t want a .eth name or to be associated with Ethereum in this way. We get it. So here are some other choices for you.\n\n2) Tomi\u2019s tDNS\n\nNow tomi goes about things a little differently. It\u2019s almost like you can start your own domain name registration business. When you mint a domain there, you earn 25% of the winning auction price for that domain.\n\nAnd because you are early, lots of great, sexy, and vanity names are available for you to mint right now. Some of the more popular names at auction now are:\n\nBitcoin.com\n\nhealthcare.com\n\nMedium.com\n\nLawyer.com\n\nThe internet was created to be decentralised but unfortunately it evolved to become highly centralised and controlling. Learn why the internet is not censorship resistant and how tomi fixes this:https://t.co/IXVlfnoRS0 pic.twitter.com/SvTbXcnOGl \u2014 tomiNet (@tomipioneers) August 23, 2023\n\nSo lots of big, big names that are long gone in other naming services are available here and now. Your own first name.com is probably available now on the tDNS. Tomi\u2019s system is unique. Its business model gives you a chance to make money not by flipping domains like elsewhere, but by being the original minter.\n\nAs I said, you get 25% of the auction price for a domain you minted. So there is nothing stopping you from going to tDNS and thinking of as many popular and vanity names as possible and minting them. In fact, you earn over time. With each increasing bid, you earn 25% of the difference in the new bid price. So you don\u2019t have to wait for the final winning bid to start earning.\n\nGo mint jimmy.com for example. Your name isn\u2019t Jimmy? Who cares? Other Jimmys will bid against each other at auction to get the domain. And you get paid. Once you mint, the domain goes to auction. And for someone wanting to operate domain names like a business, that\u2019s awesome.\n\nBut you should know that all names go directly to the auction automatically. So even if I go to tomi\u2019s tDNS to get mattie.com, it still has to go to auction before I can finally claim it as mine. And someone else could bid for it.\n\nMore About tomi\n\nSo for selling vanity names, this is really cool. For getting and keeping your own vanity name, you\u2019ll have to wait for it. This idea of you being a partner with tomi for the domain name sales is definitely cool and different. Ethereum sure isn\u2019t sharing any revenue with you.\n\nThe internet has transformed our entire lives from Web 1 to Web 2. And now the future is Web 3, a decentralized internet where users control their own data.https://t.co/Smu9Vh2RzQ pic.twitter.com/5aKkz89RIA \u2014 tomiNet (@tomipioneers) August 9, 2023\n\nAnd there\u2019s a great 5-tier referral program too. Once you join, you can earn up to 12.5% of the mint & bid price without even minting the domain yourself.\n\nOne last note. These first auctions are long. They go until May 15, 2024. So that is a while to wait, but the big advantage is that you can get names that are not accessible on other services. You just have to wait for it.\n\nOnce you get it, then you can build out your full tomiNet website. Do you have a custom domain name using one of these services? Let us know yours in the comments below.\n\n3) Unstoppable Domains\n\nLike tomi, once you pay for your domain name on Unstoppable Domains, it\u2019s yours forever. We like that. Unlike tomi, you can\u2019t get .com but unlike ENS, you have many choices here. Some domains you can buy include:\n\n.crypto\n\n.polygon for you MATIC lovers\n\n.x\n\n.blockchain\n\n.nft\n\nOver 3.9 MILLION Unstoppable domains registered so far \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f A huge thank you to our Unstoppable family for helping us hit this milestone! Together, we're unstoppable. pic.twitter.com/LgAidQKTsU \u2014 unstoppable.x (@unstoppableweb) October 4, 2023\n\nSo there are some excellent choices here based on what you like. As Unstoppable says on its own website, they\u2019ve registered more than 3.7 million domain names. It\u2019s VERY popular. This also means that, unlike tomi\u2019s tDNS, many great vanity names are already taken.\n\nUnstoppable is a great product and it has lots of integrations with wallets, apps, and other services. But all of that is still connected to the public Web2 version of the web.\n\nWith tomi\u2019s tDNS, you control now just your domain name but its access to a fully decentralized web too.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe information discussed by Altcoin Buzz is not financial advice.

        "title": "OpenSea: Ethereum and Polygon NFT sales hit 2023 lows - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "Ethereum and Polygon-based NFTs on OpenSea recorded their lowest sales volume this year in September.\n\nBlur continued to outpace OpenSea in terms of monthly sales volume.\n\nThe monthly sales volume of Ethereum [ETH] and Polygon [MATIC]-based non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on leading marketplace OpenSea closed September at its lowest level so far this year, data from Dune Analytics revealed.\n\nDuring the general bull market in the year\u2019s first quarter, the monthly sales of Ethereum-minted NFTs on the marketplace reached an impressive peak of $659.02 million in February.\n\nAs interest in this form of digital collectibles began to wane in March, monthly sales volume on OpenSea embarked on a descent, and has fallen consistently in the past seven months.\n\nAt the end of September, the sales volume for Ethereum NFTs on OpenSea totaled $74 million. This represented a 98% fall from its February peak and a 30% decline month-over-month (MoM).\n\nSimilarly, following a record-breaking NFT sales volume of $109.12 million in February, Polygon-based NFTs on OpenSea have received decreased patronage from OpenSea\u2019s users.\n\nThe total sales volume in September was $5 million \u2013 a 95% decline in sales since February and a 29% fall MoM. This marked its lowest sales volume since the year began.\n\nIn addition to declining sales volume, the number of traders who completed transactions involving Ethereum and Polygon-based collectibles on OpenSea in September also declined.\n\nRegarding the count of Ethereum-minted NFTs sold on OpenSea in September, this totaled 248,089. This was a 1% uptick from the 244,907 Ethereum-based NFTs sold on the marketplace in August.\n\nHowever, there remains a significant decline on a year-to-date (YTD) basis. In January, over 1 million Ethereum NFTs were sold on OpenSea.\n\nAs for Polygon-based collectibles, the sales count fell to a YTD low in September. During the 30-day period, 169,072 Polygon NFTs were sold on OpenSea.\n\nOpenSea remains in Blur\u2019s shadows\n\nBlur [BLUR] continues to dominate OpenSea in terms of monthly NFT trading volume, data from DappRadar revealed. According to the data provider, NFTs trading volume on Blur totaled $138.8 million.\n\nOpenSea trailed behind it with a trading volume of $59 million, registering a 22% decline in the last month. Moreover, Blur saw more NFT trading activity despite having fewer traders compared to OpenSea during the period under consideration.\n\nAccording to DappRadar, traders that completed NFTs transactions on OpenSea in the last month totaled 173,000. However, Blur saw a mere 28,000 traders."

        "title": "Zcash Mining More Profitable Than Bitcoin, Ethereum, Faces Inflation Problems - CoinCentral",
        "content": "The Zcash privacy coin has gained tremendous prominence among miners within the past few months as many disenchanted enthusiasts seek out digital currencies with greater rewards and less capital investment.\n\nAccording to the latest statistics, the coin\u2019s hash rate has grown by over 400 percent since July last year and remained immutable even after the capricious November price slump. Bitcoin and Ethereum\u2019s hash rate dipped in the wake of the shifting landscape as miners struggled to break even.\n\nMining profitability is the main reason why more miners are jumping on the Zcash bandwagon. Mining Zcash is still profitable as compared to other cryptocurrencies. According to CryptoCompare statistics, many Zcash miners are still able to achieve near 100 percent profitability while mining Zcash.\n\nAt a power consumption of 1000 watts and at a cost of $0.12 kilowatts per hour, Zcash mining profits can reach about $85 per month. This translates to just over $1,000 a year. Scaled properly, miners can make substantial gains.\n\nThose with more efficient miners and access to cheap crypto mining power stand to make huge returns on the profitability metric. On the other hand, many Bitcoin miners are set to incur losses reaching up to 81 percent, while mining at a hashing rate of 4730 GH/s and at a power consumption of 1293 watts. Power consumption of the figures listed are at a cost of $0.12 KWh. Ethereum mining does not fare very well either. Mining profitability is in the red at a 41 percent loss.\n\nIt is important to note that the illustrated data is a general average and does not take into account mining equipment efficiency.\n\nThe Zcash Inflation Rate Problem\n\nThat said, the positive returns and the subsequent growth of the Zcash network has caused some unforeseen after-effects. Among them is a climbing inflation rate. Right now the network reportedly has a 0.1 percent daily inflation rate.\n\nDaily digital currency issuance has reached the equivalent of about $400,000. Although these figures seem abysmal, they add up significantly when calculating the yearly inflation rate and may become a major problem in the future. A high inflation rate means that coins devalue over time, and this will have a negative impact on the ecosystem.\n\nRight now, there is ongoing debate as to whether Harmony Mining can solve the problem if included in the Blossom upgrade that is scheduled for October. The upgrade is set to include dual proof-of-work capabilities, which are expected to help redistribute tokens by utilizing two mining algorithms.\n\nMore than one algorithm means more mining options. Miners will be able to use both GPU and ASIC miners, subsequently spreading political influence.\n\nBitcoin, the most dominating cryptocurrency by market cap, has an inflation rate of about 4 percent per annum, which is a lot less than Zcash.\n\nHow Other Networks Are Fighting Inflation\n\nThe Bitcoin Anti-Inflation Mechanism\n\nIt is worth noting that, Bitcoin, the mother of all cryptocurrencies was created to be a decentralized currency alternative in the event that global economies would be upended by hyperinflation. As such, it has an inflation regulation mechanism built into its protocol.\n\nThe lodestar cryptocurrency was invented during the world financial crisis of 2008 and according to the white paper written by Satoshi Nakamoto, the algorithm was designed to regulate the supply of bitcoin by adjusting difficulty. Difficulty would increase if the network experienced an upsurge in mining activity and inversely go down if there was a drop in the number of miners. The network is also programmed to stop the mining of new coins at 21 million.\n\nThis would inevitably create scarcity and rising demand that would consequently counter inflation, thereby triggering a rise in value. With the mining option now out of the equation, bitcoin transactions would increase and inflation would decrease. Right now, over 17.4 million bitcoins have been mined.\n\nThe Bitcoin algorithm is set to cut miner rewards in half in 2020 through a process referred to as halving. The process has been a major bitcoin price-hike catalyst over the years. It has historically led to a price rally in the months preceding the event.\n\nThe subsequent scarcity that is bound to occur will lead to a rise in value, a trend that crypto investors are advised to watch for. A price rally in anticipation of halving historically starts about a year prior to the event and is, in this case, expected to start in May 2019. Block reward halving is expected to occur on May 25, 2020. Prices are expected to rally again and settle at a point of equilibrium.\n\nThe last two halving events triggered huge price escalations. The 2012 halving event, which occurred in November, caused bitcoin\u2019s price to jump from $12 to $240 within six months. And the last halving event, which occurred on July 9, 2016, led to an unprecedented price uptick from $580 to $900 within a few months.\n\nCountering the Ethereum Inflation Rate\n\nEthereum\u2019s inflation rate is bound to decrease after the Constantinople upgrade, currently scheduled for February. It is expected to bring down the supply of the digital currency by 33 percent. Experts envisage that this will cause Ethereum to increase in value. Overall, the hard fork is expected to create greater price stability.\n\n(Feature Image Credit: Pixabay)"

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC), the world\u2019s oldest and most valued cryptocurrency, remained below the $28,000 mark early Thursday. Popular altcoins \u2014 including the likes of Ethereum (ETH), Dogecoin (DOGE), Ripple (XRP), and Litecoin (LTC) \u2014 traded sideways, seeing minor movements across the board.

In anticipation of this Friday's official release of US Non-farm payroll data, the preliminary data for September's US Private Payroll employment indicated an increase of 89,000 jobs, below the projected 153,000 jobs. Depending on market momentum holding the pace, Bitcoin's price may either push towards the $30,000 threshold or settle back into the $27,000 trading range. Altcoin AVAX has experienced notable growth, surpassing a 9 percent increase in the last 24 hours, thanks to the launch of Stars Arena, a SocialFi platform, on the Avalanche blockchain.\u201d\n\nShubham Hudda, Senior Manager, CoinSwitch Markets Desk, said, \u201cThe crypto market seems to be calming down after Monday\u2019s sharp rally. Bitcoin (BTC, +0.9 percent) showed an upward move yesterday albeit a slow one with it still remaining below the $28k mark. The major mover of yesterday remained AVAX (+8.7 percent) as it crossed the $10 mark after 28 days due to the gaining popularity of its social app Stars Arena which is a direct competitor of the very popular base chain app friend.tech.\u201d\n\nRajagopal Menon, Vice President, WazirX, said, \u201cBitcoin (BTC) inched up 1.3 percent in the last 24 hours, reaching around $27,700 amid a more stable crypto market and easing traditional market pressures. Although BTC briefly touched $28,000 earlier this week, it retraced some gains. October is expected to see a sideways movement, offering opportunities for investors in the long term. On WazirX, Standard Tokenization Protocol (STPT) and Pendle (PENDLE) have been the top gainers in the last 24 hours.\u201d\n\nSathvik Vishwanath, CEO and co-founder of Unocoin, said, \u201cOn the 4-hour Bitcoin price chart, key levels include the pivot point at $27,267, immediate resistance at $28,427, and further resistance at $29,222 and $29,997. On the other hand, immediate support lies at $26,775, followed by $25,900 and $25,000. Technical indicators suggest bullish sentiment with RSI 59 above the 50 threshold and 50-day EMA at $27,260, indicating a short-term bullish trend. Notably, the 50-day EMA support at $27,300 is particularly interesting and potentially signals a bull market if it holds. In the short term, given the current trends and resistance levels, Bitcoin seems likely to test higher resistance points.\u201d\n\nShivam Thakral, CEO of BuyUcoin, said, \u201cMarket is witnessing an uneasy calm as one of the most high-profile trials of the beleaguered crypto exchange, FTX, begins. The global crypto community will be closely watching the proceedings and the outcome of the trial and recovery of consumer funds will strengthen the trust and credibility of the crypto industry around the globe. The overall crypto market remained flat with XRP rallying around 5 percent after a US judge rejected the SEC bid to appeal against Ripple. The markets will be less volatile in the coming week if there are no surprising news headlines.\u201d\n\nCoinDCX Research Team told ABP Live, \u201cIn the past 24 hours, BTC has seen a 1 percent increase in value, currently trading above Rs 23,50,000 ($27,600). It's maintaining its position above both the 50 and 200 EMA Daily, which is considered a positive sign. On the other hand, ETH has experienced slight gains in the last 24 hours, reaching Rs 1,43,000 ($1,640). However, it remains below the 50 and 200 EMA Daily, which raises some concerns. Avalanche's AVAX, a Layer 1 blockchain, has been a top performer in CoinDCX among major cryptocurrencies, with an impressive 8 percent surge in the last 24 hours.\u201d\n\nSubscribe And Follow ABP Live On Telegram: t.me/officialabplive\n\nDisclaimer: Crypto products and NFTs are unregulated and can be highly risky.

        "title": "Vitalik Buterin openly reflects on the future of Ethereum: should the protocol add more functionality? - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "In a post published on 30th September on his personal blog, Vitalik Buterin addressed some very sensitive issues, the main topic being the future of Ethereum.\n\nIn his speech, we find reflections on the challenges and opportunities facing the Ethereum community, especially in the areas of ZK-EVM rollups, liquid staking and private mempools.\n\nThe gist of the discussion can be summed up in a very precise question that Vitalik posed at the beginning of his blog: does it make sense to add more functionality to the protocol or is it better to aim for a minimalist structure?\n\nObserving the changes in the blockchain landscape over the last few years, Vitalik has come up with 5 important lessons that reflect the modus operandi with which this question should be approached, and which we should all take inspiration from.\n\nLet\u2019s look at the details together.\n\nVitalik Buterin and philosophical reflections on Ethereum\u2019s past and future\n\nVitalik Buterin, a prominent figure in the world of blockchain, published a post on his personal blog a few days ago in which he discusses some philosophical topics about the future of Ethereum and its community.\n\nThe founder of the world\u2019s most famous smart contract development platform began the post by reflecting on the priorities the protocol set for itself in its early years, which now seem to have changed with the evolution of society and the entire decentralised ecosystem on which Ethereum orbits.\n\nIn fact, in the beginning, the ultimate goal of his blockchain was to make the backbone as simple as possible and to make the maximum effort to build as many applications on top of it as possible.\n\nIn 2013, Vitalik and his initial team\u2019s idea was to build a virtual machine that would be operated through a blockchain check, which would essentially result in a call to the machine itself.\n\nIn recent years, however, there has been a strong interest in the community to include as much functionality as possible in the main protocol, without leaving it to the rest of the world to solve the challenges that have arisen over the years.\n\nAmong these, we now find narratives that focus more on the mere issue of scalability that has always plagued Ethereum\u2019s global computer, but we also find user needs that range from the simple exchange of digital resources to issues of privacy, account security, resistance to censorship and even advanced cryptography.\n\nThe basic question that Vitalik Buterin poses in the published text is therefore this:\n\nShould the Ethereum protocol include more features?\n\nLet us try to be more specific by reporting Vitalik\u2019s thoughts on Zk-EVM rollups, private mempools and liquid staking.\n\nShould Ethereum build more functionality into the protocol? The challenge of ZK-EVM rollups\n\nLooking at each of Vitalik Buterin\u2019s thoughts on the future of Ethereum and whether or not the protocol structure should be enshrined by adding or removing functionality, we can see the following.\n\nStarting with the topic of ZK EVM rollups, which are increasingly present as L1 scaling structures that use off-chain computation tests to offload the main chain, Vitalik addresses the controversy surrounding the possibility of running into bugs in ZK code.\n\nIn fact, many ZK projects have a \u201csafety board\u201d that can be consulted in the event of bugs in the test systems. The doubt concerns how these roll-up networks should handle the level of trust in the test systems and in the safety board.\n\nThe way forward seems to be to give less and less power to these bodies, which are made up of people who think outside the blockchain information.\n\nThere are plans to start supporting \u201cquasi-EVM\u201d versions with custom code tested by other systems, which can act as a hybrid for these complications.\n\nIn conclusion, the consecration of ZK EVMs holds both promise and challenges: for now, the underlying technology is immature and requires exceptional human control.\n\nMore complex designs could be added as the technology develops.\n\nPrivate Mempools and Liquid Staking\n\nLet\u2019s turn to the topic of private mempools: With the increasing notoriety of MEV bots on Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin and the entire community started thinking about alternative solutions to avoid the damage caused by attacks such as frontrunning transactions.\n\nAs the pools are currently public and visible to everyone, an MEV can easily be \u2018corrupted\u2019 by paying more fees than necessary and choosing the order in which it wants the Tx to be executed in order to gain financial advantage at the expense of the end user.\n\nTo solve this problem (which actually also has benefits for DEXs, such as lower price spreads and stability of lending protocols), some developers have come up with a kind of private mempool that can keep users\u2019 transactions encrypted until they are added to a blockchain, thus reducing the profit opportunities for MEVs.\n\nThe problem, however, is that such schemes require a special kind of encryption: which, to put it simply, must be self-decrypting once the transaction is actually irrevocably accepted.\n\nUnfortunately, there is no single solution that is reliable enough to be practically accepted at Layer 1.\n\nTherefore, consecrating anti-frontrunning functionality at layer 1 seems a difficult proposition, at least until delayed encryption is perfected. Again, the complexity of Ethereum\u2019s structure is viewed positively, but we still need time and compromises.\n\nFinally, on the liquid stakes front, Vitalik Buterin\u2019s thoughts are related to the risk of future centralisation that Ethereum could suffer from given the growth of certain protocols such as Lido and RocketPool.\n\nIn the short term, the most immediate solution is to convince the community to use a variety of providers so that no single entity gets too big.\n\nThe experiment has already failed, as several providers have appealed to stakers, without success, trying to eliminate part of Lido\u2019s marketshare, which to date amounts to 32%.\n\nSince moral pressure has not worked, Vitalik leaves the door open to the simple creation of a fungible ETH staking token in the protocol, possession of which would grant governance access to choose who manages the nodes.\n\nThere are actually other, more complex ways to address the risk of centralisation of the system, such as committees of random depositors voting off-chain to decide the management of nodes, but this would undermine the concept of collective power.\n\nAs ideas and concerns about this sensitive issue grow, Vitalik concludes by simply saying that the way forward is not all black or all white, but that there is the possibility of \u201csanctioning some things and leaving other things to the users\u201d.\n\nVitalik Buterin\u2019s 5 conclusions from his reflections on the future of Ethereum\n\nAt the end of his post, Vitalik Buterin draws some conclusions based on his previous observations about the future of Ethereum and the doubts about whether or not to include as much functionality as possible in the protocol.\n\nBelow we summarise 5 interesting lines of thought from Vitalik:\n\n1- In order to understand whether the consecration is right or not, it is necessary to be aware of the fact that blockchains are social systems and not personal computing platforms.\n\nThinking along these lines can help to provide answers to the challenges that arise in the future.\n\n2- Consecration of functions can help avoid the risks of centralisation in other parts of the stack. However, too much consecration can strain the trust and governance of the protocol and compromise Ethereum\u2019s neutrality.\n\n3- A cross between minimal consecration and full consecration of all functionalities may be the right way forward as the technology evolves. This is especially true for liquid staking.\n\n4- Dedication may prove counterproductive in the long run, as user needs are unpredictable. Features that we consider essential today may not be widely used in the years to come.\n\n5- It could be highly beneficial to simplify or even eliminate certain functionalities, such as pre-calculations that optimise contracts to save time and gas prices."

        "content": "Vitalik Buterin conceptualized Ethereum in 2013 and published a whitepaper to this effect in which he described a decentralized, censorship-resistant network to develop applications with real-life use cases. However, Ethereum was born in June 2014 when eight co-founders met in the woods to establish the foundation of what was to become the 2nd largest blockchain network.\n\nEthereum price has been in an intense downtrend since its all-time high in 2021. The native asset of the biggest smart contract platform soared to $4,878 on November 10, 2021. However, the price had a brutal correction throughout 2022. After bottoming out in June 2022, ETH price has been in an uptrend since the start of 2023.\n\nEthereum price now $[crypto name=\u201dethereum\u201d type=\u201dprice\u201d] Ethereum\u2019s Price change percentage 24h ago [crypto name=\u201dethereum\u201d type=\u201dpriceChangePercentage24h\u201d]% Ethereum\u2019s Price change percentage 7 days ago [crypto name=\u201dethereum\u201d type=\u201dpriceChangePercentage7d\u201d]% Ethereum\u2019s highest price 7 days ago [crypto name=\u201dethereum\u201d type=\u201dhigh7d\u201d]$ Ethereum\u2019s lowest price 7 days ago [crypto name=\u201dethereum\u201d type=\u201dlow7d\u201d]$ Ethereum\u2019s highest price 90 days ago [crypto name=\u201dethereum\u201d type=\u201dlow90d\u201d]$ Ethereum\u2019s lowest price 90 days ago [crypto name=\u201dethereum\u201d type=\u201dlow90d\u201d]$ Ethereum\u2019s highest price all time [crypto name=\u201dethereum\u201d type=\u201dhighAllTime\u201d]$ Ethereum\u2019s lowest price all time [crypto name=\u201dethereum\u201d type=\u201dlowAllTime\u201d]$ Ethereum\u2019s lowest price change percentage of all time [crypto name=\u201dethereum\u201d type=\u201dlowAllTimeChangePercentage\u201d] Ethereum\u2019s lowest price change percentage of all time [crypto name=\u201dethereum\u201d type=\u201dhighAllTimeChangePercentage\u201d] Ethereum\u2019s rank [crypto name=\u201dethereum\u201d type=\u201drank\u201d] Ethereum price overview\n\nCoin Founders\n\nEight co-founders are behind the development of Ethereum. Vitalik Buterin, Gavin Wood, Anthony Di Iorio, Charles Hoskinson, Amir Chetrit, Jeffrey Wilcke, Mihai Alisie and Joseph Lubin are the eight original founders of Ethereum. Of the eight co-founders, Vitalik Buterin remains the only one still actively involved in work on the platform and has become the public face of the project. At least two of the eight co-founders left to start their blockchain projects. The others are involved in other projects supporting Ethereum or have left the industry entirely.\n\nEthereum Road map\n\nThe development of Ethereum was funded by a crowd sale that took place between July and August 2014. More than $18m was raised, with the first live release of the Ethereum blockchain occurring in 2015. Here is a brief timeline of the Ethereum roadmap.\n\nIn May 2015, 25,000 ETH were distributed as rewards for stress tests conducted on the Public Testnet in what was known as the Olympic testing phase. This was followed closely in July 2015 by Frontier, which was the official launch of the public mainnet. The genesis block was mined into existence, with transactions being suspended for a few days to allow for more significant signups from miners and clients. At this time, 5 ETH was the block reward.\n\nHomestead followed in March 2016. This upgrade introduced the Mist ETH wallet and new codes for the Solidity programming language. In addition, the Canary contracts were abolished.The DAO hard fork occurred in 2016 after the theft of $50m worth of Ethereum. The vulnerability led to the split and creation of Ethereum and Ethereum Classic.The Byzantium upgrade reduced the mining rewards from 5ETH to 3ETH. This upgrade occurred on 16 October 2017.\n\nFebruary 2019 brought the Constantinople upgrade, reducing block rewards from 3ETH to 2ETH. Smart contracts could now verify each other with a hash of another contract, and this upgrade also provided better support of off-chain transactions. October 2019 brought the Istanbul upgrade, the next hard fork, and upgrade that preceded Serenity.\n\nChanges to gas costs for different operations were proposed, and the ProgPoW mining algorithm reduced the efficiency advantage of ASIC miners., known as Ethereum 1.x. The first phase of Serenity (Serenity Phase 0) signals the move from the proof-of-work to the proof-of-stake consensus mechanism.\n\nSerenity Phase 1 launched in 2020, dividing the network\u2019s transactions among several sets of randomly organized validators. The Beacon Chain now supports 1024 Shard chains with validation by collecting 128 nodes.\n\nEthereum Merge Upgrade\n\nIn September, Ethereum activated the merge, which brought together the old version and the Beacon Chain. As a result, Ethereum moved from being a proof-of-work (PoW) network to a proof-of-stake network. This was a major milestone for the biggest layer 1 smart contract platform on the planet, which received widespread attention from the whole crypto community.\n\nEthereum Shapella/ Shanghai Upgrade\n\nIn April 2023, Ethereum underwent the Shanghai upgrade, which enabled the unstaking of the ETH crypto from the beacon chain. This was a major development for the whole ecosystem as the validators had billions of dollars of ETH locked. The update also reduced the gas fees for some transactions and implemented better security features with improved support for L2s.\n\nEthereum TVL & Adoption Stats\n\nEthereum is currently by far the biggest smart contract platform in terms of on-chain activity and the total locked value (TVL). Currently, the network boasts $26.4 billion TVL, which is 60% of the total TVL across all blockchains. Most of this TVL comes from decentralized applications (Dapps) like LIDO, AAVE, Maker DAO, and Uniswap.\n\nWhat has been the story of Ethereum\u2019s price adoption?\n\n\u2013 The number of Ethereum addresses in the last five years has grown tremendously, far exceeding that of Bitcoin.\n\n\u2013 Ethereum remains the platform of choice for many developers of decentralized applications (dApps). Nearly 80% of all dApps are built on Ethereum. The data from Consensys is shown below.\n\n(c) Consensys: 2021\n\nAs of July 2021, Ethereum had over 689,000 addresses and exceeded the number of active BTC wallets by more than 200,000, in data showcased by Benzinga.By December 2021, non-zero Ethereum wallets hit an all-time high of 71,364,788. This was made possible by the explosion in interest in non-fungible tokens (NFTs). This data piece was pulled from Glassnode.\n\nSource: Glassnode 2021.\n\nThe various metrics measured show that Ethereum adoption and usage continue to grow, despite the price correction experienced recently.\n\n[crypto name=\u201dEthereum\u201d]\n\nEthereum Price Prediction 2024\n\nSince its November 2022 lows, ETH price has been in an uptrend. During this time, the price has surged 53%. The following chart shows that the asset is facing strong resistance above the key psychological level of $2,000. It is also evident that the price is respecting an upward trendline since the start of 2023.\n\nIf the uptrend remains intact, the Ethereum price prediction of $2,000 seems likely to be met at the start of 2024. However, a lot will also depend on the bulls\u2019 ability to break the $2,000 barrier. On the other hand, a major correction in ETH to $1,200 will be on the cards if BTC breaks down below $25,000.\n\nETH Price Analysis\n\nI\u2019ll keep posting my updated ETH price prediction and my personal trade setups on Twitter, where you are welcome to follow me.\n\nYEAR MINIMUM PRICE MAXIMUM PRICE 2023 $1,601 $3,810 2024 $3,551 $5,087 2025 $4,512 $6,551 2026 $5,920 $8,570 2027 $7,716 $11,132 2028 $9,013 $13,163 2029 $11,012 $16,612 2030 $11,340 $19,442\n\nEthereum Price Prediction 2025\n\nThe Ethereum price prediction 2025 also retains a bullish bias as long as the ascending trendline on the weekly price chart of the ETH/USDT pair is respected. This trendline intersects the 50% Fibonacci retracement level from the swing low of 21 January 2019 to the swing high of 8 November 2021.\n\nMONTH MINIMUM PRICE MAXIMUM PRICE January $4,559 $5,160 February $5,160 $5,260 March $5,260 $5,461 April $5,361 $5,611 May $5,461 $5,761 June $5,611 $5,862 July $5,711 $5,962 August $5,862 $6,112 September $6,012 $6,262 October $6,112 $6,363 November $5,962 $6,463 December $6,162 $6,563\n\nETH/USDT: Weekly Chart\n\nOn a weekly timeframe, Ethereum has made a lower low on the weekly chart, which has broken the bullish market structure. To flip bullish on the weekly chart, the ETH price needs to break above $3,580.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction 2030\n\nThe Ethereum price prediction 2030 is that the coin could be trading closer to the $10,000 mark. This view is consequent on the ETH/USDT pair breaking above the $4877 mark (all-time high), which allows for a push to sequential Fibonacci extension targets at 7324, 8641, 9328, and 10316. But, again, this Ethereum price prediction 2030 depends on the ability of the bulls to hold the fort at the existing trendline that intersects the 50% Fibonacci extension level.\n\nIs Ethereum a Good Investment?\n\nSuppose there is any cryptocurrency that will remain relevant for years to come in terms of the sheer scale of its utility and application. In that case, Ethereum is a powerful candidate. Indeed, it will be a bold statement to say that the advent of Ethereum is the main reason the cryptocurrency market survived the teething challenges of its early years. The Mt.Gox saga nearly buried Bitcoin, but Ethereum resurrected it and led to the market revolutions that followed. The development of initial coin offerings (ICOs) and decentralized finance (DeFi), the development of smart contracts, and cross-chain interoperability are all products of Ethereum\u2019s entrance into the blockchain arena.\n\nHow to buy Ethereum?\n\nHow to buy Ethereum is not an issue. It is available on almost every crypto exchange. There are two ways to do this. The Basic function allows for quick conversion of the purchase of fiat or cryptocurrency with Ethereum at market price. The Advanced process allows for expanded purchase options, such as setting limit prices, purchasing specific amounts, etc. Ethereum is usually listed in pairing with Bitcoin (ETH/BTC), US Dollar (ETH/USD), Tether (ETH/USDT) and several other cryptos.\n\n\u201cThere are multiple fundamental and technical factors behind the negative ETH price action. According to the most recent news, the Securities and Exchange Commission of the United States had sued the top crypto exchanges Coinbase and Binance. These development are acting as the tailwinds for ETH.\n\nSEC has labelled BNB, BUSD, MATIC, SOL, CHZ, ADA, and many other top cryptocurrencies as securities in its latest lawsuits. However, the regulator hasn\u2019t taken any stance on Ethereum yet. Nevertheless, sooner or later we may have big news on the status of ETH as well.\u201d\n\nETH/USDT: Monthly Chart"
