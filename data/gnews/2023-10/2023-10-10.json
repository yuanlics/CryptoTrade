        "title": "Bitcoin vs. Ethereum: A Detailed Comparative Study - Clarion Ledger",
        "content": "William Mullane\n\nContributor\n\nAs the digital age moves ahead, the Bitcoin vs. Ethereum debate continues to captivate financial markets globally. Bitcoin enjoys worldwide recognition and the highest market cap in the industry, whereas Ethereum stands as a versatile contender, enriching the crypto ecosystem with its multifaceted functionality and solidifying its place as the second most valuable cryptocurrency. Investors, faced with the formidable task of selecting between these two titans, are in dire need of an in-depth comparison to make well-informed decisions. This is where this detailed article can bridge the information gap, providing you with the clarity required in this dynamic crypto race.\n\nWhat follows is a comprehensive comparison of the two, exploring their underlying technology, investment potential, and future prospects, delivering a compelling argument for prospective investors and blockchain enthusiasts alike.\n\nInitially, it is vital to recognize the foundational technology that underpins these cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin, the vanguard of digital currencies, operates on a simple, unalterable blockchain technology, ensuring a secure, decentralized ledger for transactions. Its primary purpose is to serve as a digital substitute for traditional fiat currencies. Ethereum, conversely, expands upon this foundational blockchain concept by integrating \u201csmart contracts\u201d\u2014autonomous scripts that execute transactions when predefined conditions are met. This enables Ethereum to function not just as a currency but as a platform for decentralized applications (dApps), thus providing a broader functionality.\n\nTransitioning from technology to investment potential, the inherent characteristics of both Bitcoin and Ethereum significantly influence their respective financial value. Bitcoin's greatest investment appeal lies in its scarcity; with a predetermined limit of 21 million bitcoins, it is often likened to \u201cdigital gold.\u201d This artificial scarcity has fueled its value, rendering Bitcoin an intriguing hedge against inflation. Ethereum, however, holds a different investment proposition through its potential for growth. As the fuel for dApps, its utility extends beyond being a mere currency, which could potentially lead to increased demand and, subsequently, value.\n\nSimultaneously, it's crucial to cast an analytical eye on the future prospects of these cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin, with its robust security and simplicity, is steadily gaining acceptance as a viable form of payment, hinting toward a promising future. Yet, its lack of a broader technological use poses a challenge to its long-term relevance. Ethereum, on the other hand, is projected to undergo significant technological upgrades, such as the transition to Ethereum 2.0. This shift towards a more energy-efficient model, paired with its increasing utilization in the burgeoning field of decentralized finance (DeFi), suggests a future of endless possibilities.\n\nWhile Bitcoin and Ethereum are currently industry leaders, their future depends on a multitude of factors, including regulatory pressures, market sentiments, and technological advancements. However, it is crucial to remember that the world of cryptocurrency is replete with risk and unpredictability. Investors are strongly advised to conduct thorough research and consult with financial advisors before venturing into the turbulent seas of cryptocurrency investments.\n\nWhile Bitcoin and Ethereum share the common foundation of blockchain technology, their purposes, investment potential, and future prospects diverge significantly. With its straightforward operation and scarcity-based value, Bitcoin offers a stable yet limiting experience. Ethereum's more complex and innovative approach provides a wider array of applications but requires a higher tolerance for potential volatility. Choosing between these two depends largely on an individual's investment goals and risk tolerance. If you're interested in staying informed about the latest developments in the cryptocurrency market, including the Ethereum price and Bitcoin price, it's suggested to follow reputable sources and stay up-to-date on market trends. As the crypto saga continues to unfold, these digital currencies\u2019 distinct characteristics will shape their respective journeys, influencing the future of the digital financial market.\n\nThis is for informational purposes only.

        "title": "Vitalik Buterin: Co-founder of Ethereum, Crypto Visionary - FinTech Magazine",
        "content": "Vitalik Buterin is the Co-founder of what is now the world\u2019s second-most valuable cryptocurrency, Ethereum, worth an estimated US$220.2bn. Involved in crypto from its beginnings, Buterin is also the founder of Bitcoin Magazine and is today a figure synonymous with all things crypto.\n\nBut how did he get here? We look at Buterin\u2019s rise to prominence as Co-founder of Ethereum.\n\nButerin: Capitalising on a gift\n\nBorn in Moscow Oblast in 1994, Buterin left his native Russia to live in Canada aged just six, as his parents sought greater employment opportunities.\n\nAn immigrant primary school student, Buterin was placed in a programme for the gifted, where his early nous for mathematics and programming made him a novelty to his teachers, let alone his fellow students.\n\nDespite his initial flippancy for education success in the traditional sense, Buterin developed a hunger to acquire knowledge during his four years at the private Aberald school.\n\nA fan of World of Warcraft, Buterin soon became opposed to centralised services in general, after game developer Blizzard removed a feature from the game, \u2018nerfing\u2019 one of his favourite characters.\n\nPerhaps it was here a love for the decentralised was born, as in 2011, Buterin developed a keen interest in the newly launched Bitcoin \u2013 the world\u2019s first cryptocurrency.\n\nUnable to purchase any Bitcoin tokens, Buterin sought out employment writing for this new mysterious industry, where he would earn 5 BTC per article.\n\nStriking a relationship with fellow crypto enthusiast Mihai Alisie, the pair launched their own publication, Bitcoin Magazine.\n\nButerin: Founding Ethereum\n\nLaunching a print edition in 2012, Bitcoin Magazine is regarded as the first publication exclusively dedicated to cryptocurrencies.\n\nDuring this time, Buterin attempted to join the crypto platform Ripple but was unable to do so because of US Visa issues.\n\nDetermined to make his way in the world of crypto, Buterin completed a whitepaper detailing his idea for what would later become Ethereum, summarised as a \u201cdecentralised mining network and software development platform rolled into one\u201d.\n\nEssentially, Ethereum would provide a platform that facilitated the creation of new crypto assets and associated programmes using the same blockchain, or cryptographic transaction ledger.\n\nInitially planning his idea to \u2018improve\u2019 Bitcoin \u2013 arguing it needed a scripting language to develop applications \u2013 Bitcoin\u2019s disregard of the proposal saw Buterin move ahead with Ethereum, co-founding the crypto platform alongside a string of other investors.\n\nThese included Bitcoin Magazine Co-founder Mihai Alisie, as well as computer programmers Jeffrey Wilcke and Gavin Wood, ConsenSys Founder Joseph Lubin, Charles Hoskinson, Anthony Di Lorio and Amir Chetrit.\n\nUnveiled in 2014 at a conference in Miami, the founders soon held an initial coin offering for Ether \u2013 Ethereum\u2019s native coin \u2013 raising US$18m to grow the Ethereum platform.\n\nThe team then established the Ethereum Foundation, a non-profit organisation based in Switzerland, that would run the crypto platform.\n\nDistinguishing five key principles \u2013 simplicity, universality, modularity, agility and non-discrimination/non-censorship \u2013 Ethereum was successfully launched, and Buterin was at the core of it all.\n\nEthereum: A leading crypto platform\n\nA rapid rise over a short space of time, Buterin looked back on Etehreum\u2019s unprecedented growth in 2020.\n\nHe said: \"I am truly grateful to have the opportunity to work in such an interesting and interdisciplinary area of industry, where I have the chance to interact with cryptographers, mathematicians and economists prominent in their fields, to help build software and tools that already affect tens of thousands of people around the world, and to work on advanced problems in computer science, economics and philosophy every week.\"\n\nPioneering in a new industry space, Ethereum\u2019s rise has not come without its issues, after a decentralised autonomous organization (DAO) using the Ethereum platform was hacked due to codebase flaws.\n\nAs a result, the Ethereum blockchain was hard forked (when nodes of new blockchain entries no longer accept older versions) to retrieve funds, a controversial move that flew in the face of blockchain being unchangeable and censorship-resistant.\n\nDespite these issues, Ethereum remains on a path to increased scalability after completing a transformative process known as The Merge.\n\nPer the upgrade, Ethereum adopted sharding, a process where its network is split into shard chains, making it possible to distribute the Ethereum network load across several avenues.\n\nA process that relieved network congestion, the crypto platform also moved to a proof-of-stake mining model \u2013 as opposed to the traditional proof-of-work model \u2013 reducing its energy output by as much as 99%.\n\nButerin: A crypto leader\n\nButerin\u2019s achievements with Ethereum, conceiving and creating the platform himself, make him a leader in the world of crypto. It has been said that Buterin today develops his time to research, removing the focus on him as a crypto pioneer.\n\nHis father, Dimitry Buterin, said to The New Yorker: \"He is trying to focus his time on research. He's not too excited that the community assigns so much importance to him. He wants the community to be more resilient.\"\n\nDespite this, we believe Buterin deserves saluting as a pioneer in the world of crypto nonetheless."

        "title": "ETF Prime: Islam on the Debut of Ethereum Futures ETFs and More - ETF Trends",
        "content": "On this episode of ETF Prime, host Nate Geraci speaks with a trio of individuals discussing several different ETF-related topics. His guests include VettaFi\u2019s Roxanna Islam who discusses the debut of Ethereum futures ETFs. Geraci also speaks with Baird\u2019s Rich Lee who discusses ETF trading volumes and more. To close the podcast Geraci talks with Texas Capital\u2019s Ed Rosenberg about the Texas Capital Texas Equity Index ETF (TXS).\n\nDebut of Ethereum Futures ETFs\n\nTo open the podcast Geraci brings on VettaFi\u2019s Roxanna Islam to discuss the debut of the Ethereum futures ETFs. Geraci first points out how last week seven Ethereum Futures ETFs launched, and he highlights how he feels that the SEC accelerated the launch of these funds. He mentions that the possible government shutdown could\u2019ve been what brought these funds to market so quickly. However, Geraci mentioned that despite the government accelerating the release of these funds they were not met with a lot of interest from the market. He says there are about $17 million in net assets from all seven funds following their initial release. Geraci then asks Islam for her initial reaction to this disappointing debut.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it has been much of a surprise especially when you compare it to those Bitcoin Future ETF launches a couple of years ago,\u201d said Islam.\n\nIslam continues by comparing the releases of these Ethereum funds to the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) which brought in close to a billion on its first-day trading. While these Ethereum funds only brought in about seven million on its first day on the market.\n\nDifferences Between Bitcoin and Ethereum\n\nIslam then highlights several other reasons as to why these Ethereum Futures ETFs have had such a disappointing debut. She first points out that you need to look at pure Bitcoin versus pure Ethereum, not underneath the ETF wrapper but as cryptocurrencies. Islam mentions that Bitcoin by far has more popularity among investors when you compare the two.\n\n\u201cIt has about 50% market share in the crypto market versus Ethereum which has less than 20% of market share,\u201d Islam said.\n\nUltimately, Islam believes that it is safe to assume that interest in Ethereum is not as high as it is in Bitcoin. Islam then points out the fact that the cryptocurrency market is much different than it was back when the Bitcoin futures ETFs were first launched. Today the attitude on cryptocurrency is also in a different place than it was when funds like BITO first came to market. She also points out the differences between spot and future ETFs as another reason why these funds may have not garnered that much attention.\n\nTo close the segment the pair continue going in-depth into the future of these funds, and more.\n\nBond ETF Trading Volumes\n\nThe conversation then switches gears when Geraci brings on Rich Lee, Head of Program Trading and Execution Strategy at Baird to discuss a multitude of different topics. Geraci highlights how Lee himself is involved in several different areas of Baird\u2019s business, but he primarily helps institutional clients with their ETF trading strategies. He then asks for Lee\u2019s thoughts on bond ETF trading in today\u2019s market as last week there was a record amount of trade volume in the iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond ETF (HYG).\n\n\u201cLast week it quickly dawned on me that basically five of the top 10 most active ETFs that we traded were actually bond or treasury-related ETFs,\u201d said Lee.\n\nLee then highlights several different funds in the bond space that Baird\u2019s has specifically been trading. He mentioned that he and his firm have a significant amount of interest in the current fixed-income space. The pair discuss the concept of \u201cbottom fishing\u201d when pertaining to the significant number of flows that the bond space has seen this year.\n\nAdditionally, Geraci and Lee discuss concentration risk pertaining to the S&P 500, active management, and several other topics.\n\nThe TXS ETF\n\nTo close the podcast Geraci brings on Ed Rosenberg, the Head of ETF and Fund Management at Texas Capital to discuss his firm\u2019s TXS ETF. Prior to the conversation, Geraci mentioned that the TXS is the only state-specific ETF. Rosenburg joins the conversation by sharing his thoughts on what makes Texas Capital a full-service firm. Rosenberg attributes the number of different service offerings his firm gives its clients as one of the main reasons he considers Texas Capital a full-service firm. He then dives into what made the firm want to get into the ETF space.\n\n\u201cIt is another service offering for the clients of Texas Capital, and beyond,\u201d said Rosenburg.\n\nTo close the discussion Geraci and Rosenburg spotlight some of the key features of the TXS ETF as well as the philosophy behind investing in the state of Texas. The pair also touch on what the firm\u2019s future plans are within the ETF space.\n\nListen to the entire episode of ETF Prime Featuring Roxanna Islam, Rich Lee, and Ed Rosenberg:\n\nFor more ETF Prime podcast episodes, visit our ETF Prime channel."

ETH started a fresh decline from the $1,665 resistance zone and dived below the $1,650 level.\n\nThe bears pushed the price below the $1,600 level and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. Ether retested the $1,550 support. A low was formed near $1,549 and the price is now attempting a recovery wave. There was a move above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $1,664 swing high to the $1,549 low.\n\nEthereum is now trading below $1,600 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $1,610 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.\n\nOn the upside, the price might face resistance near the $1,600 level. The first major resistance is near the trend line and $1,610. It is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $1,664 swing high to the $1,549 low.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nThe next major resistance is $1,620 or the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average, above which the price could rise toward the $1,665 resistance zone.

As liquidity in the pool increases and adjusts to the entry queue, rewards are expected to fluctuate between 0% and 4% in the first days after the launch.\n\n\n\n\u2013 For legal reasons, US-based users cannot use the pooled staking service through Ledger Live.\n\n\n\nPooled staking is now available on Ledger Live. Kiln allows you to stake any amount of ETH and earn rewards.\n\nEthereum\u2019s transition to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism allowed holders to put their ETH to work and earn rewards. After that, Ledger Live users could solo stake their ETH with Kiln or use Lido for liquid staking. However, native staking requires a deposit minimum of 32 ETH while liquid staking is often considered risky due to the transferable receipt tokens.\n\nWith pooled staking, your ETH is combined with the stakes of other users to meet 32 ETH deposit thresholds.\n\nThe Kiln Staking Pool will be bootstrapped organically, relying on early adopters and platform integrations for its success. During this initial phase, the validator entry queue may be long, which can result in longer times for staked assets and rewards to accumulate. Currently, the queue stands at around 1 day and 15 hours.

        "title": "NFTs: An Interesting Frontier in the Ethereum Ecosystem - Naples Daily News",
        "content": "William Mullane\n\nContributor\n\nStep into the marketplace of Ethereum, where sparks of innovation can ignite fresh paradigms. Amid this pulsating landscape, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have emerged as the latest beacon, a novel frontier promising a unique blend of artistry, technology, and lucrative investment.\n\nNFTs, the fascinating new kids on the Ethereum blockchain, are painting a revolutionary tableau on the vast canvas of digital transactions. Unlike cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ether, each NFT is unique, carrying distinct information that, much like a snowflake, cannot be replicated. This quality imbues NFTs with a special charm, unlike the aura surrounding an original piece of art amidst a sea of replicas.\n\nThe rise of NFTs in the Ethereum ecosystem traces an exciting trajectory that has left spectators, users, and investors agog. At their inception, NFTs might have seemed a quaint novelty, a charming aberration in the world of cryptocurrencies. Their uses ranged from digital artwork to digital pets and even collectibles, all underpinned by Ethereum's versatile blockchain technology.\n\nHowever, it didn't take long for the investment world to understand the potential inherent in these unique digital creations. With their sharp, forward-looking instincts, investors began to perceive the layers beneath the initial novelty. They saw the transformative potential of NFTs, underpinned by Ethereum's robust and reliable blockchain technology, which assures their uniqueness and ownership.\n\nNFTs, you see, are not just digital doodles or virtual trinkets. Instead, they are the gateways to an unseen universe of potential that extends beyond art and collectibles. They promise transformative applications in fields such as real estate, gaming, digital identity, and intellectual property rights.\n\nImagine owning a piece of virtual real estate, your ownership unequivocally established by the immutable records of the Ethereum blockchain. Picture yourself as the proud owner of exclusive, valuable in-game assets you can trade or sell, turning virtual victories into tangible wealth. What if you could keep your unique digital identity as an NFT, immutable and safe in the Ethereum ecosystem? Such are the tantalizing prospects that the NFT frontier holds.\n\nThe investment potential of NFTs is a lush, verdant field waiting to be sown with the seeds of vision and courage. Just as early adopters of Bitcoin were often rewarded with astronomical returns, so too could those who venture into the realm of NFTs reap substantial rewards. Of course, like any other, this frontier comes with its fair share of volatility and uncertainty, but those elements only add to the thrill of exploration and discovery.\n\nThe journey across this digital landscape, however, requires wisdom and discernment. Just as the gold rush had its fool's gold, so does the NFT landscape have its ephemeral mirages. Those who thrive here will be the ones who understand the terrain and who can differentiate between passing fads and lasting value. It's an ecosystem where the judicious thrive and the reckless falter.\n\nAs we stand at the cusp of this enticing new era, it's clear that NFTs within the Ethereum ecosystem are not just another development; they herald a seismic shift in the world of digital transactions and investments. We are participating in an unfolding saga that will likely shape the digital landscape for generations to come.\n\nThis is for informational purposes only. Please invest at your own risk.\""

        "content": "What is driving the price of Ethereum? Bullish and Bearish Factors for Q4\n\nThe price of Ethereum continues to range, with no clear momentum in either direction. What are the possible bullish and bearish factors likely to impact ETH\u2019s performance in Q4, 2023?\n\nEthereum (ETH) is currently the largest smart contract platform in the world by value of its native currency. Ether, the native currency that powers Ethereum, is also the second largest cryptocurrency in the world. Ethereum is also the largest smart contract chain by Total Value Locked (TVL) into Decentralized Finance (DeFi).\n\nEthereum currently has a market cap of ~US$201.3 billion, with each individual Ether currently priced at US$1583.17. Year to date the price of Ether is up ~32.0%. While YTD performance may suggest that ETH has had an excellent year, after hitting a cycle peak of ~US$2100 in April 2023, the price of the asset has steadily slid to a price level of around ~US$1600.\n\nTo evidence this middling 6-month period, if an investor was dollar cost averaging (DCA) Ether from the 1st of January, buying it weekly, they would be at a loss as of today. Dollar-cost averaging is the process of investing the same amount of money in a targeted asset at regular intervals over a certain period of time, regardless of price.\n\nBuying US$10 of ETH weekly from January 1, 2023, to October 3, 2023, would have turned US$400.00 into ~US$392, resulting in a loss of ~4.1%.\n\nSource: Brave new coin\n\nBackground\n\nEthereum was launched in 2015 and builds on the original blockchain innovations first introduced by Bitcoin.\n\nBoth Bitcoin and Ethereum allow users to exchange value without payment providers or banks. Ethereum, however, differs because it allows application developers to build decentralized applications. It is able to do this because it supports more complex, programmable transactions than Bitcoin. These more complex transactions are facilitated by smart contracts, which are self-executing \u2018contracts\u2019 where the terms of agreement or conditions are written into lines of code. The \u2018contracts\u2019 in this case can be considered similar to traditional contracts for value exchange with penalties and rules predetermined and \u2018smart\u2019 because they can be triggered automatically.\n\nThe project has humble beginnings. A whitepaper for the project was written by 19-year-old Canadian developer Vitalik Buterin in 2013. After successful funding rounds in 2014 powered by the concept of Ethereum\u2019s vision of a new internet powered by decentralized applications, the project had its real coming out party in 2017 during the ICO bull run.\n\nBecause of its multi-purpose functionality, it became the platform of choice for Initial Coin Offerings, a method of fundraising blockchain projects through launching new tokens. With a swathe of highly successful projects conducting ICOs using Ethereum as a medium, value rushed into the network.\n\nAfter the emergence of Decentralized Finance in 2019 and 2020, alongside a re-emergence of Non-Fungible tokens (NFTs) and Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), in 2021, Ethereum once again experienced an extreme surge in value. While this bull run shared similarities with the bull run from 2017\u2014 a rush of value from developers and projects choosing to finance themselves using Ethereum \u2014 a distinguishing feature of this bull run was institutional interest in Ethereum.\n\nDuring this period, for example, Real Vision Founder and noted Macro investor, Raoul Pal, said in an interview that the market cap of Ethereum could overtake that of Bitcoin by the next market cycle. A Former Goldman Sachs executive, Pal also said he believed Ethereum was the \u201cgreatest trade\u201d setup that he has ever seen because cryptocurrency\u2019s fundamentals suggested that it had an enormous value.\n\nDuring 2021, Ethereum went from a fringe technology to one that was advocated and accepted by a growing number of legacy financial traders.\n\nThe story Now\n\nTechnological strength and developer popularity \u2013 Bullish\n\nDespite six months of tepid price activity, Ethereum continues to evidence the powerful underlying macro fundamentals that Pal was referring to. \u201cThey\u2019re two entirely different things. One is this pristine collateral store-of-value asset. The other one is basically a technology platform that\u2019s the fastest-growing on Earth. Is that [second one] going to be worth more? Yeah,\u201d explained Pal when referring to Ethereum.\n\nEthereum remains the de facto platform to build blockchain projects on top of. It is the oldest and most trusted smart contract blockchain and because of this it has a wealth of open source code available to replicate. It also has well-known tooling like OpenZeppelin and applications on Ethereum are more auditable than many other blockchains. It remains the gateway blockchain for most new entrants, particularly institutions and brands.\n\nDespite having relatively higher costs and slower transaction processing speeds than many other comparable platform blockchains, Ethereum is also preferred thanks to its size and inherent security.\n\nVenture Capital firm Electric Capital is highly regarded for its analysis of the Crypto/Blockchain developer ecosystem. As of June 2023, it reports that Ethereum has 5946 active developers working on it in total and that 1901 of these developers are full-time. This dwarfs the next most popular chain by total developers, Polkadot, which has 1923 total developers and 645 full-time ones.\n\nThe only other major blockchains comparable to Ethereum in terms of developer growth are smaller platforms with lower market caps like Cosmos and Solana.\n\nIn the last yearly report for crypto developers by Electric Capital, at the end of 2022, it measured that in the 4 years between 2018 and 2022, Ethereum experienced a more than 5 times increase in monthly active developers, from 1,084 to 5,819.\n\nIt is difficult to verify Pal\u2019s assertion that Ethereum is the fastest-growing technology platform in the world. It is certainly the largest technology platform in the rapidly growing blockchain space but how it compares to other technology paradigms like Cloud and IoT is difficult to verify. Data from the State of Developer Ecosystem 2021 by Jetbrains would suggest, however, that it is much larger than IoT but much smaller than the cloud.\n\nEthereum, because of its incumbency as the most developed blockchain in the world, is in a strong position to be at the forefront of the Web3, Defi, NFT, and Metaverse revolutions. Groundbreaking apps like Compound, Opensea, and Decentraland were built on Ethereum first for a reason.\n\nProne to attacks- Bearish\n\nWhile Ethereum is a technology platform that is growing in popularity it is prone to being exploited. On 20 July 2016, a reentrancy attack on the Ethereum DAO\u2019s smart contract led to losses of 3.6 million ether (worth about US$50 million at the time). After initially blocking off the over 11 million within the DAO, the attacker made off with about a third of this by setting up a \u2018Child DAO\u2019 smart contract with a similar structure to the DAO. The attack led to community disagreements that forked Ethereum forever and led to a drop off in confidence across the Ethereum investment landscape.\n\nWhile Ethereum developers have become better at writing smart contracts, there are still numerous vectors that attackers are targeting. An example is cross-chain bridging platforms. Bridging applications will generally be set up with smart contracts on either blockchain and an intermediary that communicates between the two.\n\nBridging technology has helped users shift from incumbent chains like Ethereum to new networks like Metis with a few clicks and through easy-to-navigate portals. Bridges have helped promote the growth of emerging blockchains like Metis, Moonbeam, and Optimism. While also offering relevance to Ethereum as a feeder blockchain.\n\nWriting robust smart contracts across multiple blockchains, however, is no easy task. Bridging between blockchains is a complex operation with many moving parts. There are more points of failure and well-resourced hackers can often move faster than developers.\n\nRecent years have seen the emergence of government-funded, professional hacking groups who will find ways to exploit any sort of smart contract flaw in a permissionless web3 application. Bridges, because of their complexity and the high value of fund movements, appear to be more prone to attacks than many other application types.\n\nThe biggest DeFi hack ever was a bridge attack tied to Ether. Over 170,000 Ether, worth ~US$600 million was lost during the Ronin bridge hack. Ronin is the native blockchain of the popular NFT-based game Axie Infinity. Many users swap between Ronin and Ethereum to cash out winning or deploy earnings.\n\nBearish \u2013 Ethereum\u2019s \u2018invisible tax\u2019 \u2013 MEV\n\nThere are other attack vectors that have become very specifically tied to Ethereum, namely Maximal Extracted Value (MEV). MEV has been described as one of Ethereum\u2019s biggest threats. It affects decentralization and the bottom line of honest users.\n\nMEV refers to the maximum value that can be extracted from block production in excess of the standard block reward and gas fees by including, excluding, and changing the order of transactions in a block. By reordering transactions, value can be lost or gained by small amounts each time that steadily accrue. In 2022, according to Eigen Research MEV bots generated revenue of at least $307 million on Ethereum. This revenue was taken from honest everyday users which is why MEV is often called the invisible tax.\n\nIn today\u2019s Ethereum, Validators (previously miners) have the power to reorder or select transactions waiting in the mempool. The mempool can be described as the viewable pool of transactions submitted to a blockchain network that is valid and waiting to be added to the chain by miners or validators.\n\nIndependent network participants known as \"searchers\" are core to how MEV manipulators capture value. Searchers run complex algorithms that will seek out MEV opportunities across Ethereum and have bots automatically submit those profitable transactions to the network. An example of an MEV profit opportunity may be DEX arbitrage or a flash loan opportunity. DEX arbitrage would for example entail a difference in the exchange rate between an ETH/AXIE pair between two exchanges on Ethereum.\n\nMEV bots will pay extra to validators to process transactions that capture their profit opportunity first from the mempool before it dissipates. The MEV landscape is competitive and searchers are willing to pay up to 90% of the revenue they may gain from vectors like DeFi arbitrage. Searchers and validators both earn from this process but users on the applications like traders, stakers, and liquidity providers tend to lose out.\n\nIt should be noted that other smart contract blockchains with DeFi arbitrage and other application-based MEV opportunities like Solana also suffer from MEV challenges.\n\nThere is also a danger that MEV bots are censoring Ethereum transactions. A number of MEV bot services work by building proposer/block-builder separation (PBS) tooling.\n\nA block proposer, or Ethereum validator in a proof-of-stake network, can increase their ETH staking rewards by up to 60% by selling blockspace to a pool of block builders. The separation of Block proposers and block builders is a technical solution implemented post-merge.\n\nThe problem to some with many PBS-based MEV bots, including industry leader Flashbots, is that they openly state they will refuse to include transactions deemed to be forbidden by the USA\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). This can include transactions that are a part of the Tornado Cash mixing service built to make Ethereum transactions more private and less traceable. There is evidence to suggest that Tornado Cash was used by Money Launderers and Cyber Criminals from nations like North Korea.\n\n31% of the Ethereum blocks in the last month have been OFAC compliant.\n\nNeutral: Ethereum is just a higher beta version of Bitcoin\n\nEthereum and Bitcoin are fundamentally different assets but they are strongly correlated.\n\nBoth Bitcoin and Ethereum allow users to exchange value without payment providers or banks. Ethereum, however, differs because it allows application developers to build decentralized applications. It is able to do this because it supports more complex, programmable transactions than Bitcoin.\n\nEthereum\u2019s value proposition is much broader than Bitcoin\u2019s and covers the range of Web3 including DeFi, NFTs, Metaverse projects, and new token launches. Bitcoin offers purity, deeper decentralization, a manageable roadmap, and a truly decentralized, public digital currency that has the best chance of being adopted over fiat.\n\nInvestors, however, tend to group Ethereum and Bitcoin together as \u2018risk assets\u2019 or assets with a tendency to fluctuate more than the market baseline. Mainstream investors, both institutional and retail tend to lump the two assets and other digital assets together as \u2018crypto\u2019\n\nParticularly during periods of market turmoil, BTC and Ether tend to be sold together. This may be down to a lack of broad understanding of how the two assets work and their significant differences.\n\nOver the last year, the correlation between Bitcoin and Ethereum has hovered between 0.8-0.95. This is objectively high and suggests that the two assets are currently moving in step with each other.\n\nSource: Coinmetrics\n\nBitcoin has outperformed Ethereum and is up ~65.6% year-to-date. The original digital asset has observed greater resilience during the post-April period of bearish market activity. The two assets, however, have broadly shared similar characteristics of record-low volatility this year.\n\nSource: Glassnode\n\nSource: Glassnode\n\nAbove are charts for Ethereum and Bitcoin\u2019s Realized Volatility. This is the standard deviation of returns measured against the mean return of a market. High values in realized volatility indicate a phase of high risk in that market.\n\nHere, Glassnode calculates the realized volatility based on daily returns and multiplies it with a factor of sqrt(365) to yield the annualized daily realized volatility over a rolling window of 2 weeks. For both assets, volatility has been muted for most of 2023.\n\nBoth Ethereum and Bitcoin have had to deal with characteristics of an uncertain global macroeconomic environment where it is uncertain whether major economies will face or when interest rate hikes will end. This has reduced mainstream interest in risk assets. Additionally, cyclical interest in blockchain technology has cooled following booms in 2022, not helped by the scandalous Luna/Terra and FTX incidents.\n\nBoth assets and crypto in general, are dealing with lukewarm demand as evidenced by the lower volatility.\n\n**Bullish: The Triple Halving and Ethereum\u2019s Ultrasound Money Characteristics **\n\nIn September 2022, the Merge upgrade was implemented on the Ethereum blockchain. The Ethereum Foundation states that the Merge will be \u2018the most significant upgrade in the history of Ethereum.\u2019 The Merge will witness the joining together or \u2018merging\u2019 of the execution layer, Ethereum as we know it today, with a consensus layer called the Beacon chain.\n\nThe Beacon chain uses a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus model that will replace the current Proof-of-Work (PoW) model that the mainnet currently uses. The switch to PoS will replace energy-intensive mining, and instead secure the network with staked ETH.\n\nThe bitcoin halving is pivotal in crypto markets because of the strong positive effect it has on the price of BTC. It occurs approximately every 4 years and cuts the supply rate of new Bitcoin in half. The halving reduces the rate of inflation and like clockwork, creates upward price pressure for Bitcoin.\n\nEthereum underwent something similar to a halving type of effect with the transition to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) leading up to the merge. Calculations from some analysts suggest that the inflation rate cut to Ethereum will be the equivalent of \u201cthree Bitcoin halvings.\u201d\n\nPoS makes securing the network much cheaper than with Proof-of-Work, and because of this, PoS validators are paid far less than PoW miners. Because of Ethereum\u2019s existing free burn model introduced as part of the London Hard Fork and EIP-1559, the supply impact of the Merge is set to be even more exaggerated. With less ETH being issued and the asset now being burnt, the potential for an ETH supply shock was massive.\n\nThe dashboard for Ultrasound.money, gives us insight into the rate of new supply and the simulated rate if Ethereum didn\u2019t switch to Proof-of-Stake.\n\nSource: Ultrasound.money\n\nSource: Ultrasound.money\n\nThe difference in new yearly supply of Ether with the new Proof-of-Stake compared with Proof-of-Work is estimated to be around 94% less.\n\nIf transaction activity is high enough then there is a possibility that Ethereum switches to becoming deflationary, meaning it has a negative inflation rate. This has occurred on numerous occasions in the last year. This should further buoy the price appeal of Ethereum.\n\nOther factors driving the price of Ethereum\n\nBullish\n\nStaking rewards for Ether\n\nCurrently, anyone holding Ether can delegate it to a Validator and earn a share of their Proof-of-Stake consensus earnings. Holders can currently earn ~3.8% on any Ether they stake. ~22% of all Ether is locked into staking. This ratio is low because once Ether is staked it cannot be used for activities like paying for gas. Native staking rewards add more value to a token as a store of value. More Ether staked also restricts the available supply of Ether and increases its supply.\n\nLayer-2 solutions boost the scaling capabilities of Ethereum\n\nLayer 2 refers to any secondary framework or protocol built on top of an existing blockchain that adds features that improve the scaling capabilities of the base chain. Base layer blockchains like Ethereum can slow down and become expensive when they are congested because of events such as popular NFT drops. Layer 2s are booming. The value of assets being deployed onto layer 2 platforms is hitting unprecedented levels in the billions of dollars. Layer-2\u2019s boost the value of networks like Ethereum by moving transactions off them. Ethereum, if layer-2\u2019s continue to flourish, should be in a good position to absorb rising transactions during the next bull run.\n\nBearish\n\nOther Smart contract blockchains pull value away from Ethereum\n\nOther smart contract networks like Solana, Polkadot, and Cosmos offer compelling alternatives to Ethereum. They offer faster and cheaper transactions, alternative architecture, more accessible programming languages for programmers, greater scalability, and many other advantages designed to improve upon Ethereum. Ethereum is the earliest version of blockchain technology and over time new flasher alternatives have and will arrive. This may pull money away from Ether.\n\nIs Ethereum censorship resistant?\n\nAs mentioned earlier, certain MEVbots publicly state they censor transactions that OFAC deems as non-compliant. Beyond this, Ethereum development platforms like Infura and Circle have stated they will ban Ethereum addresses believed to be attached to cyber criminals and illegal activity. Censorship resistance is a core tenant to blockchains and a decentralized ethos. In many users\u2019 views, an entity like OFAC should not decide what is and isn\u2019t allowed on the Ethereum network. If this trend continues Ethereum, may in some way have to pick sides during global conflicts, or will simply have to bend the knee if the US government decides transactions from a particular group should not be published on the network.\n\nConclusion\n\nEthereum\u2019s narrative in 2023 has played out as a mix of bullish and bearish signals, reflecting the evolving nature of this pioneering blockchain platform. The ecosystem\u2019s resilient development community, institutional interest, and cutting-edge upgrades like the Merge have solidified its position in the rapidly evolving digital landscape. Ethereum\u2019s adaptability and integration with Layer-2 solutions illustrate a blockchain that\u2019s not static but evolving, indicative of its potential to scale and adapt.\n\nHowever, this optimism is tempered by existing vulnerabilities, notably security challenges and the contentious issue of MEV \u2013 an \u2018invisible tax\u2019 that threatens user experience and the blockchain\u2019s decentralized ethos. The platform\u2019s correlation with Bitcoin underscores its susceptibility to broader market sentiments and macroeconomic factors, painting a picture of a digital asset still in the throes of maturation. Whether Ethereum is now censorship resistant because of its clear OFAC compliance approach will divide opinions but it is ultimately turning many original users away from the network who initially joined it because it promised a more free internet.\n\nThe future of Ethereum is likely not going to be linear. Investor sentiment is likely to continue to ebb and flow. Ethereum, however, remains central to the conversations and innovations shaping the future of the digital economy."

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nAn average of just 7% of Ethereum users will stick with the platform for a year.\n\nEthereum\u2019s high churn rate contrasts with most mobile apps.\n\nCould more mobile integrations solve Ethereum\u2019s user retention problem?\n\nDespite the development of increasingly advanced and numerous decentralized apps (dApps) on the platform, research suggests that Ethereum has a serious user retention problem.\n\nAs it turns out, people are less likely to stick with the blockchain than they are with the average Web2 mobile app.\n\nEthereum Retention Rates Poor Compared to Mobile Apps\n\nAccording to research by Token Terminal , between August 2015 and September 2023, the average retention rate for Ethereum users was just 16.3% after a month. After a year, that figure falls to as low as 7%\n\nof those that start using @ethereum mainnet this month, ~7% will be around on mainnet in one year pic.twitter.com/p3a1pF7mUg \u2014 Token Terminal (@tokenterminal) October 9, 2023\n\nLooking at different Ethereum-based dApps, although specific retention rates diverge, the overall pattern is repeated across the board.\n\nFor instance, the dropoff rate for the decentralized exchange Uniswap was even worse than for Ethereum as a whole. On average, just 5% of Uniswap users were still using the platform a year after first signing up, Token Terminal data shows.\n\nEthereum\u2019s high user churn contrasts with the retention rates observed among standard mobile apps. According to Geckoboard , on average, mobile apps have a 30-day retention rate of 42%. For the best-performing apps, that figure rises to 66%.\n\nBut what are Ethereum dApps doing wrong? Could a poor user experience be holding the network, and a move to blockchain-based apps, back from greater adoption?\n\nDo Web3 Apps Have a User Experience Problem?\n\nOf course, there are some great Web3 dApps with an exceptional user experience. But to date, the most popular Ethereum-based applications have been designed for web browsers, or as standalone pieces of software.\n\nIn contrast, mobile apps have changed the way people access digital tools. And some of the most popular Web2 applications today are designed to be mobile first.\n\nThanks to Apple\u2019s App Store and Google Play, downloading new apps to a smartphone is almost always simpler than installing new software on a computer or configuring a new browser extension.\n\nIn addition to offering a more streamlined onboarding experience, people find it easier to integrate mobile apps into their daily routines once they download them.\n\nFor developers, there is no better way to build an active user base than making an application accessible from a device that most people carry around in their pocket.\n\nSo, maybe Web3 apps don\u2019t have a user experience problem as much as they have a mobile problem.\n\nApp Stores Remain Hostile to dApps\n\nIn defense of blockchain developers, mobile ecosystems have hardly welcomed them.\n\nFor example, in the US, Congress deemed Apple\u2019s developer guidelines hostile enough to warrant investigation by the House Subcommittee on Innovation, Data, and Commerce.\n\nAt issue are App Store guidelines that impose a 30% levy on gas fees tied to NFT transactions.\n\nMajor blockchain developers, including Coinbase and Axie Infinity, have long objected to the policy, which they argue invalidates their business model and makes it nearly impossible for them to offer their apps in an iOS-friendly format.\n\nIn the case of Coinbase, Apple\u2019s policy forced the firm to suspend NFT transfers for its iOS wallet users.\n\nApple\u2019s claim is that the gas fees required to send NFTs need to be paid through their In-App Purchase system, so that they can collect 30% of the gas fee. \u2014 Coinbase Wallet \ud83d\udee1\ufe0f\ud83d\udcde (@CoinbaseWallet) December 1, 2022\n\nMeanwhile, to comply with the App Store guidelines, Axie Infinity had to dramatically redesign its platform for iPhone users, who can only play a \u201clite\u201d version of the game without NFT functionality.\n\nFor Android users, on the other hand, Google only recently moved to embrace blockchain integrations and in-app NFTs.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Mobile Future\n\nDespite recalcitrance from mobile ecosystem gatekeepers, slowly but surely, Web3 is going mobile.\n\nWith new, mobile-focused Ethereum apps being developed all the time, alongside advances in blockchain-focused hardware , the greater integration of Web3 applications into mobile devices and networks looks almost inevitable.\n\nAnd once everyone can easily access tools and services built on Ethereum from their smartphones, perhaps the blockchain\u2019s dismal track record for user retention will improve."

        "title": "Benjamin Cowen Doubles Down on Ethereum Call, Says Big ETH Collapse By End of the Year Most Likely Outcome - The Daily Hodl",
        "content": "A widely followed crypto analyst is doubling down on his prediction for Ethereum (ETH), the top smart contract platform by market cap.\n\nIn a new strategy session, crypto analyst Benjamin Cowen tells his 787,000 YouTube subscribers that Ethereum is likely to collapse by the end of the year.\n\n\u201cI think Ethereum returns home before it goes on any sustained bull run. A lot of people got excited \u2013 I mean, they can get excited all they want about this rally. It\u2019s still just a 2X move. You can celebrate a 2X move if you want, but you can get that in the stock market pretty easily. I mean, a lot of stocks do 2X moves\u2026\n\nYou ride a 50X move up, and then, you know, you take a side, whether you\u2019re bullish or bearish, and everyone celebrates $100 moves in either direction. But that\u2019s not what you\u2019re here for. What you\u2019ll notice is that every time Ethereum made a rally to new highs, it did not happen until Ethereum went home first. \u2018Home\u2019 is the lower regression band. Right now, we need to see Ethereum go home for new highs to come.\n\n[We\u2019ve] still got to see ETH go home, my friends, and it hasn\u2019t happened yet. So, I think that it will. And again, you can see on these lower time frames, at least over the last year and a little over a year, that it\u2019s trying to hold those levels. But again, at some point, it likely breaks, and when it does, that\u2019s likely when Ethereum starts to head home.\u201d\n\nAccording to an analysis published almost a year ago, Cowen says \u201chome\u201d for ETH is between $600-$800, where his own version of the logarithmic regression band sits.\n\nCowen says ETH will be coming \u201chome\u201d within the next several months.\n\n\u201cI think the most likely outcome is for Ethereum to drop below $1,200 within the next two and a half months and I mean it could certainly go lower.\u201d\n\nETH is worth $1,572 at time of writing, down 5% in the last week.\n\nI\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "title": "Ethereum NFT production falls to all-time low in September - Forkast News",
        "content": "Non-fungible token (NFT) production on Ethereum, or the value of the primary sales generated from NFT minting, fell to an all-time low of US$17.55 million in September, down 12.4% from US$20.05 million in August, according to Forkast Labs data.\n\nNFTs are blockchain-based digital assets that can provide information on digital ownership. Notable collections like the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) were trading at a floor price of 128 ETH (US$211,000) in May 2022, before dropping more than 60% along with other notable NFT collections like CryptoPunks, which fell 60.4% to 45 Eth (US$72,727), from an all-time high of 113.9 Eth (US$184,080) recorded on Oct. 9, 2021.\n\n\u201cBlue-chip NFT collections such as Bored Ape Yacht Club and CryptoPunks serve as indicators of broader NFT market sentiment. Their decline might signify a shift in investor sentiment, perhaps questioning the intrinsic value of such assets,\u201d Matan Doyich, the chief executive officer of Crypto Index, a firm building centralized infrastructure for tokenized crypto exchange-traded funds, told Forkast.\n\nReflecting the overall NFT bear market, the Forkast ETH NFT Composite, an index that measures the performance of the top 250 NFTs in the Ethereum blockchain, fell 48% year-to-date to an all-time low of 715.22 points recorded on Sept. 28.\n\nNFT production on the Polygon blockchain fell to a seven-month low of US$4.7 million in September, down from a yearly high of US$14.44 million in August. Polygon NFT production is up 219% year-to-date, from US$1.47 million in January. Despite the rising numbers, the Forkast POL NFT Composite fell over 46% year-to-date.\n\nThe overall NFT market slump, along with the decrease in NFT production, can be attributed to a loss of interest by NFT investors, according to Anndy Lian, author of NFT: From Zero to Hero.\n\n\u201cThe NFT market was driven by a lot of hype in 2021. However, this has died down in recent months, as people have become more realistic and choosy about the kind of NFTs they want,\u201c said Lian.\n\nNFT services revenue on Ethereum, or total marketplace fees and creator royalties from secondary sales, fell 84.4% year-to-date to US$6.01 million in September from US$38.74 million in January according to Forkast Labs data.\n\nAt OpenSea, one of the world\u2019s largest NFT marketplaces, the protocol\u2019s monthly NFT trading volume fell 31.8% to US$76.79 million in September from US$112.74 million in August, according to data from The Block.\n\nBlur, OpenSea\u2019s rival marketplace, had its trading volume fall 38.3% to US$150.42 million in September, down from US$243.92 million in August.\n\n\u201cTo reignite interest in NFTs, the industry needs to see and demand innovations that go beyond digital art and collectibles, such as incorporating NFTs into more substantial real-world applications,\u201d Doyich told Forkast.\n\nThis year brought new use cases for NFTs, which will be needed to drive institutional investors, according to David Tng, managing director at TZ APAC, the Asian entity of the Tezos blockchain.\n\n\u201cNFTs will rely on the same pain point of needing to prove their utility, especially against the backdrop of a very volatile market. However, we are still seeing rapid growth and innovation. Enterprises and artists continue to use NFTs as a platform to explore, create and engage with their audiences,\u201d wrote Tng, in a statement shared with Forkast.\n\nDespite the market slump, globally recognized brands continue adopting NFTs. Starbucks launched an NFT version of its iconic pumpkin spice latte last Thursday, to commemorate the 20-year anniversary of the iconic drink. The NFTs worth US$20 have no minting limit and users will receive 250 bonus points that can be spent to improve their Starbucks Odyssey experience, which is the company\u2019s Web3 rewards and loyalty platform.\n\nSee related article: DeFi revenue remains resilient despite Curve Finance hack"

        "title": "Ethereum Foundation Suffered from MEV Bot Attack in Eth Selling - Blockchain.News",
        "content": "The Ethereum Foundation suffered a Sandwich attack by an MEV Bot during a 1.7k ETH transaction on Uniswap V3, resulting in a $9,101 loss. The incident spotlights the rising menace of MEV exploits and underlines the necessity for enhanced security protocols in blockchain transactions.\n\nThe recent exploit faced by the Ethereum Foundation on the decentralized finance (DeFi) platform Uniswap V3 casts a spotlight on the burgeoning issue of Sandwich attacks orchestrated by MEV (Miner Extractable Value) Bots within the blockchain and cryptocurrency domain. According to data unveiled by EigenPhi and shared by WuBlockchain, during a transaction that occurred at 16:18 UTC+8, the Ethereum Foundation endeavored to sell 1,700 ETH on Uniswap V3. However, this transaction was exploited by an MEV Bot, resulting in a loss of $9,101 for the Ethereum Foundation, while the MEV Bot was able to secure a profit of $4,060 after deducting the cost. The malevolent MEV Bot, denoted as (0x00\u20266B40), tactically capitalized on the transaction, shedding light on the imperative need for fortified security measures to avert such financial predations in the future.\n\nThe transaction conducted by the Ethereum Foundation on Uniswap V3 fetched a total of 2.738 million USDC . Following the transaction, the Ethereum Foundation's holdings were detailed as 240.68 ETH, 3.238 million USDC, 49,700 DAI, and 10,000 ARB, collectively valued at $3.687 million. The detailed account of this illicit activity, including the transaction hash, has been meticulously documented and can be referenced on EigenPhi's website. Further specifics regarding the Ethereum Foundation's assets post-transaction have been made available on Arkham Intelligence\u2019s platform.\n\nRead more: What is MEV Bot?\n\nThe term 'Sandwich attack' denotes a particularly malevolent activity within the blockchain community. In a Sandwich attack, a nefarious actor places a buy order, followed by a sell order, surrounding a victim's transaction. This tactic is employed to momentarily manipulate the price of the asset being traded to the perpetrator's advantage, facilitating a scenario where the attacker can buy low and sell high within a very short timeframe, thereby securing a profit at the victim\u2019s expense. The term \"Sandwich\" is derived from the attacker's orders enveloping or \"sandwiching\" the victim's transaction, hence its nomenclature.\n\nThe exploit underscores a growing concern within the blockchain and cryptocurrency realm. The MEV Bot-driven Sandwich attack on the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s transaction highlights the continual threat that MEV exploits pose to decentralized exchanges and the broader DeFi ecosystem. This incident brings to the forefront the urgent need for enhanced security protocols to mitigate the risks associated with MEV exploits and to foster a more secure transaction environment for all participants. The rising menace of MEV exploits and the resultant financial losses beckon a call for action towards the implementation of more robust security measures to safeguard against such malicious financial activities in the blockchain space.\n\nImage source: Shutterstock"

Ethereum has been unable to recoup its previous-day losses and is currently in the red. ETH was down 0.54% in the last 24 hours to $1,583 at the time of writing.\n\nAccording to IntoTheBlock data, Ethereum is currently hovering above a demand zone with a lower support level of $1,533. This is where 2.39 million ETH were bought by 1.83 million Ethereum addresses.\n\nA loss of this support might trigger a decline near $1,485, where, unfortunately, Ethereum has little support even to $1,342.\n\nOn the upside, Ethereum faces huge resistance, slightly above where it trades at the moment.

ETH could take a hit if it settles below $1,550 and then $1,540.\n\nEthereum is showing bearish signs and struggling to clear the $1,600.\n\nThe price is trading below $1,600 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere is a major bearish trend line forming with resistance near $1,600 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair could start a recovery wave if the bulls defend the $1,550 support zone.\n\nEthereum Price Struggles\n\nEthereum failed to start a recovery wave above the $1,600 resistance zone. ETH remained in a bearish zone and extended its decline toward $1,550, like Bitcoin.\n\nIt seems like the bears already attempted a close below the $1,550 support zone. A new swing low was formed near $1,542 and the price is now consolidating losses. The price is back above the $1,550 level, but it is still showing heavy bearish signs.\n\nEthereum is now trading below $1,600 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. Besides, there is a major bearish trend line forming with resistance near $1,600 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.\n\nOn the upside, the price might face resistance near the $1,570 level. It is near the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1,664 swing high to the $1,542 low. The first major resistance is near the trend line and $1,600 or the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nThe 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1,664 swing high to the $1,542 low is also near the trend line. The next major resistance is $1,620, above which the price could rise toward the $1,665 resistance zone. A close above the $1,665 resistance might send the price toward the main resistance at $1,750. Any more gains might open the doors for a move toward $1,880.\n\nDownside Break in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $1,600 resistance, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,550 level. The next key support is $1,540.\n\nA downside break below the $1,540 support might start another strong decline. In the stated case, the price could revisit the $1,480 level. Any more losses may perhaps send Ether toward the $1,420 level.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bearish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $1,540\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $1,600\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nIt has been nearly two years since the Bitcoin upgrade that introduced Ordinals.\n\nAs the network has evolved, new use cases have expanded.\n\nToday, Bitcoin developers are working on new applications.\n\nThese may give the blockchain Ethereum-style capabilities.\n\nMany often credit Bitcoin Ordinals with significantly boosting the transaction volume on the Bitcoin network. Now, nearly 2 years after the upgrade that first enabled Ordinals, developers are using the technology to build Ethereum-style capabilities into the blockchain.\n\nBut with Ethereum advancing its own roadmap toward greater transaction volumes and more complex on-chain functions, does Bitcoin need to keep up?\n\nHow Ordinals Have Already Changed Bitcoin\n\nFirst introduced in November 2021, Bitcoin Ordinals enable the numbering, identification, and inscription of individual Satoshis, each representing one hundred millionth of a Bitcoin.\n\nThanks to Ordinals, the cost of inscribing data on the Bitcoin blockchain has dramatically reduced, and up to a 4 MB limit, it\u2019s possible to inscribe any kind of data on a single Satoshi.\n\nSince the 2021 upgrade, Ordinals have fueled a surge in activity on the Bitcoin network, driven by the development of new use cases like the BRC-20 NFT standard.\n\nAccording to Dune data, over 35M Ordinals inscriptions have occurred to date. Although the vast majority of these are text-based, more complex data formats have also helped power the surge in Ordinals inscriptions.\n\nOrdinals inscriptions\n\nFor example, users have recorded over 760,000 PNG images and more than 229,000 WEBP images on-chain as Bitcoin Ordinals. Advocates assert that Ordinals play a crucial role in diversifying the functionality of the Bitcoin network and are essential for ensuring its long-term survival.\n\nHowever, not everyone has been happy with Bitcoin\u2019s evolution to embrace a wider variety of transaction types. Purists argue that the blockchain should only be for its original purpose: the peer-to-peer transfer of value.\n\nFacing a slew of Bitcoin-based meme tokens and NFTs, critics have pointed out that transactions stemming from Ordinals inscriptions have occasionally clogged the network, leading to higher fees for users.\n\nIs Bitcoin Due a Layer 2 Revolution?\n\nAs well as expanding the range of Bitcoin token types available, the same upgrade that enabled Ordinals inscriptions is also leading to the development of new off-chain protocols.\n\nFor example, several projects have recently made advances toward realizing the vision of Ethereum-style rollups for Bitcoin.\n\nBy moving computation off-chain, recent innovations by Kasar Labs and Chainway could significantly scale transactions on the Bitcoin network and trigger an L2 revolution akin to Ethereum\u2019s.\n\n1/ We're thrilled to share that we're open-sourcing our Bitcoin Data Availability Adapter which allows Sovereign SDK to be compatible with Bitcoin. This is a crucial step in building our Bitcoin secured rollup \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f\n\nThe significance of this \ud83e\uddf5https://t.co/1dkuVL4Xbj \u2014 Chainway (@chainway_xyz) August 30, 2023\n\nMeanwhile, on October 9, a White Paper for a new system dubbed BitVM was published. The project\u2019s developers claim that BitVM enables the verification of any computable function on Bitcoin. Additionally, unless there are disputes with transactions, the resulting on-chain footprint remains minimal."

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nEthereum Foundation faced a sandwich attack during its recent sale of 1,700 ETH on Uniswap V3. The foundation, which is a key player in the Ethereum ecosystem, was caught off guard, resulting in a loss of U.S. $9,101.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to data from EigenPhi, the Ethereum Foundation's transaction was targeted by an MEV Bot (0x00...6B40). This bot, capitalizing on the opportunity, managed to make a neat profit of U.S. $4,060 after covering its costs.\n\nThe foundation's sale took place at 16:18 UTC+8, where they exchanged 1.7K ETH for a hefty 2.738 million USDC. A peek into the foundation's wallet reveals a balance of 240.68 ETH, 3.238 million USDC, 49,700 DAI and 10,000 ARB, bringing their total assets to a cool $3.687 million.\n\nBut what exactly is a sandwich attack? For the uninitiated, a sandwich attack is a form of front-running tactic used in the world of decentralized exchanges. In this strategy, a malicious actor spots a pending transaction on the Ethereum network and quickly places their own transaction with a higher gas fee, ensuring it gets processed first.\n\nThey then place another transaction right after the target transaction, effectively \"sandwiching\" the original transaction. This allows the attacker to manipulate the price in a way that they can profit from the victim's trade.\n\nThe fact that the Ethereum Foundation, a central entity in the Ethereum space, fell victim to such an attack raises eyebrows. It brings forth questions about the security measures in place and the vulnerabilities that exist even for seasoned players in the crypto arena.\n\nInterestingly, there is a pattern observed on Ethereum Foundation's sales. It often liquidates Ethereum just before significant sell-offs occur. While it is speculative to draw conclusions, the timing of its sales in relation to market movements has not gone unnoticed by keen market observers."

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEthereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has been experiencing a challenging phase. The once-thriving DeFi and NFT sectors, which significantly contributed to Ethereum's meteoric rise, are currently subdued. The buzz and activity around these sectors have dwindled, leading to a noticeable decline in Ethereum's trading volume.\n\nFurthermore, the concept of Ethereum as \"ultrasound money\" is facing scrutiny. Touted as a deflationary asset due to the EIP-1559 upgrade, which introduced a mechanism to burn a portion of the transaction fees, Ethereum's current state suggests otherwise. The deflationary pressures are not as pronounced as many had anticipated, leading to questions about its long-term economic model.\n\nAmid these challenges, Ethereum has found itself at a relatively unnoticeable support level. This support, often overlooked in favor of more prominent price points, could play a pivotal role in determining ETH's trajectory in the coming weeks. If Ethereum manages to hold above this level, it could provide the foundation for a potential rebound. Conversely, a breach below could exacerbate the bearish sentiment.\n\nThe importance of this hidden support is magnified by the broader market context. With the overall trading volume on the decline and the DeFi and NFT landscapes not providing the bullish impetus they once did, Ethereum needs all the support it can get, both technically and sentimentally.\n\nShiba Inu remains oppressed\n\nShiba Inu (SHIB) has been facing a challenging period recently. The token's price dynamics have been less than favorable, raising concerns among its vast community of holders.\n\nAt the time of writing, Shiba Inu is trading at $0.00000693, a value that is significantly suppressed from its all-time highs. A detailed analysis of its price movement reveals that SHIB is currently moving below the 21-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), a technical indicator that often provides insights into an asset's momentum. The position below this EMA suggests that SHIB is heavily suppressed and is currently in a downtrend.\n\nThe downtrend is further emphasized by the lack of attempts from the token to break through and reclaim higher levels. The 21 EMA acts as a dynamic resistance, and SHIB's consistent position below it indicates a strong bearish grip on its price action.\n\nAnother concerning factor for Shiba Inu's potential recovery is its trading volume. A robust trading volume often signifies strong interest and activity around an asset, which can be a precursor to significant price movements. However, in the case of SHIB, the trading volume is at an extremely low level. This diminished trading activity suggests a lack of buying interest, which can further dampen any hopes of a swift price recovery.\n\nSolana remains solid\n\nNot all setbacks are created equal, and Solana's (SOL) recent dip in price is one that should not raise too many alarms for investors.\n\nA detailed analysis of Solana's price reveals that the cryptocurrency is still one of the strongest performers on the market. Currently trading at $22.93, Solana has only seen a slight decline of a little over 7% in the past few days. This is a modest dip, especially when compared to other assets in the crypto space that have experienced losses of around 15% from their recent highs.\n\nThe resilience of Solana can be attributed to its robust ecosystem and the growing interest in its platform. As decentralized applications (dApps) and DeFi projects continue to find a home on Solana, the demand for SOL, its native token, remains high. This demand acts as a buffer, preventing drastic price drops and ensuring stability even in turbulent market conditions.\n\nAnother positive sign for Solana is the decreasing trading volume. While a drop in trading volume can be a cause for concern in some scenarios, in this case, it is a silver lining. The reason being that Solana is currently bearish on more local time frames but remains bullish on longer-term charts. A decrease in trading volume during a short-term bearish phase can indicate a lack of strong selling pressure, which can pave the way for a potential rebound."

        "title": "Ethereum Price Crash: Analyst Predicts ETH Price Might Drop To $600-$800 By Year End - Coinpedia Fintech News",
        "content": "Qadir Ak is the founder of Coinpedia. He has over a decade of experience writing about technology and has been covering the blockchain and cryptocurrency space since 2010. He has also interviewed a few prominent experts within the cryptocurrency space.\n\nA prominent cryptocurrency analyst, Benjamin Cowen, raises concerns about Ethereum (ETH), the leading smart contract platform. He\u2019s sticking to his prediction that Ethereum could potentially experience a substantial decline, leading its price to plummet from $600 to $800 by the year\u2019s end.\n\nAnalyst Benjamin Cowen Stays Bearish on Ethereum, Anticipates Price Dip\n\nRecently, Benjamin Cowen, known for his accurate analysis, has shared his thoughts on his YouTube channel about Ethereum. He thinks his popular cryptocurrency, Etherum will most likely lose its value by the end of the year.\n\nEthereum needs to take a step back before it starts going up. Some folks are excited about a possible rally, but it won\u2019t be huge, maybe just twice as much as it\u2019s worth now. This kind of growth can happen in regular stock markets, too.\n\nI\u2019m saying that stocks often have these kinds of two-times increases, whether they go up a lot or just a little. People get all excited about a $100 change, up or down. But that\u2019s not what\u2019s happening with Ethereum.\n\nLooking back, every time Ethereum reached new high prices, it only happened after it dropped to what I call \u2018home,\u2019 which is a specific price range at the lower end. Ethereum needs to \u2018come home\u2019 before it can make new highs.\n\nMeanwhile, Cowen\u2019s prediction is grounded in his comprehensive technical analysis of the Ethereum market. He points to several indicators, including price patterns and trading volumes, to support his view that ETH is at risk of experiencing a significant decline in value.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum Price Could Surge 5x to $8,000 by 2026, Says Standard Chartered Bank\n\nEthereum to Fall to $600 Level\n\nHe in his video, he further pointed out that this expected drop in Ethereum\u2019s value hasn\u2019t happened yet:\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still waiting for Ethereum to come back \u2018home,\u2019 and that hasn\u2019t happened yet. For over a year now, we\u2019ve seen Ethereum trying to stay at these prices, especially when we look at shorter time periods. But there\u2019s going to be a time when this support line breaks, and when it does, Ethereum is likely to head back \u2018home.'\u201d\n\nCowen had previously defined \u2018home\u2019 for Ethereum as being between $600 and $800 using a special method. He believes that Ethereum is going to return \u2018home\u2019 in the next few months and emphasized his view:"

        "title": "Here\u2019s Why The Ethereum Price Fell Toward $1,500 - NewsBTC",
        "content": "The price of Ethereum has experienced a notable decline following a major Ether sale this week. The unexpected decrease has left the crypto community anxious about the stability of the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency and the long-term effects of the decline.\n\nEthereum Price Drops After Large-Scale Ether Swap\n\nOn Monday, October 9, the price of Ethereum declined following an extensive Ether swap by the Ethereum Foundation, a non-profit community-run organization dedicated to enabling better human coordination.\n\nThe Ether transaction which took place on Uniswap, a decentralized crypto exchange platform, saw the ETH price drop 5% from its daily high of $1,635 to a local low of $1,553 before recovering once more.\n\nAccording to Arkham data, the Ethereum Foundation swapped approximately 1,700 ETH worth $2.7 million to a single wallet address which contained almost $400,000 worth of cryptocurrencies and was titled \u2018Grant Provider\u2019 by Etherscan.\n\nThe specific intentions behind the large-scale swap have not been disclosed by the Ethereum Foundation. However, the Ethereum Foundation, an organization that holds a considerable influential position, regularly swaps large amounts of tokens to fund its operations.\n\nPresently, Ethereum is trading at a price value of 1589.36 after recovering from the initial decline. The steep decline has left the crypto community worried about the health of the cryptocurrency and whether the price of Ethereum would recover.\n\nETH price recovers after 5% decline | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nETH Whales Dump $8.5 Billion\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation has not been the only large wallet to sell in recent times as other ETH whales have taken advantage of the altcoin\u2019s price. According to crypto analyst Ali Charts on X, ETH whales dumped a whopping $8.5 billion worth of tokens.\n\nThis large selling started in February this year and has continued into October. As a result, the whale selling has seen over 5 million ETH sold and redistributed over this 8-month period. The analyst also points out that \u201cthis selling trend continues with no current indication of a shift towards #ETH accumulation yet.\u201d\n\nETH whales dump 5 million tokens | Source: X\n\nCompared to its all-time high of $4891.70 in 2021, the price of ETH has dropped by more than half and has been struggling to reclaim the $2,000 mark. However, this could present a unique buying opportunity for investors who could see the price decline as ETH being on discount.\n\nNevertheless, Ethereum continues to hold its position as the second-largest cryptocurrency in the market with a market cap of $191.5 billion at the time of writing. Over the last day, the altcoin has also seen some recovery, rising to $1,593 as bulls gear up to retest the $1,600 resistance.\n\nFeatured image from Techopedia, chart from Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

You can opt-out at any time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nImproving efficiency and boosted demand will lead to a seismic rise in the world's second largest cryptocurrency, Standard Chartered said in a Wednesday note.\n\nBy the end of 2026, ether could reach $8,000, or a 400% jump from today's price of around $1,600.\n\n\"We think the path higher for ETH prices may take longer than for BTC, but we see ETH eventually reaching a higher price multiple than BTC relative to current levels (5.0x versus 3.5x),\" Head of FX Research, West, and Digital Assets Research Geoff Kendrick wrote.\n\nBut that's only a \"stepping stone\" to a larger long-term valuation of $26,000-$35,000, though this estimate assumes use cases and revenue streams that have not yet come about, the note said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe forecast partially stems from expected improvements to the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nThe block is looking to enhance its performance through layer two scaling solutions and upcoming architecture improvements. For instance, plans to implement \"danksharding\" would allow Ethereum to manage 100,000 transactions per second.\n\nA version of this, called \"proto-danksharding,\" is set to be introduced in early 2024, and would significantly lower transaction costs on the blockchain.\n\n\"This should help to cement ETH's dominance in the smart contract space, thereby increasing its P/E ratio (if not its earnings) over the next couple of years,\" Kendrick said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, demand for ether will climb as it finds new use cases, while trends that rely on the cryptocurrency are set to expand.\n\nFor instance, NFT transactions are the leading Ethereum use case, which Kendrick predicts will expand. Though he acknowledges that NFT market activity has faded, digital art prices generally follow broader crypto price flows \u2014 with the \"crypto winter\" coming to an end, NFTs should recover as well.\n\nThe development of blockchain gaming will also fuel NFT demand, in turn boosting ether. NFTs create scarcity in these types of games, representing virtual assets such as items or real estate.\n\nReal-world asset tokenization, where ownership rights are represented in blockchain tokens, would also be a boon for ether that is set to grow.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"The obvious initial benefit of tokenisation is that it allows fractional ownership of otherwise lumpy or illiquid investments (e.g., real estate) at low cost; the costs associated with tokenisation are very low compared to other fractional ownership models, like IPOs,\" Kendrick wrote.\n\nTokenization also allows for around the clock trading, immediate settlement, ownership transparency, better investor access and cheaper costs.\n\nMeanwhile, inflows into bitcoin \u2014 which Kendrick has previously projected to hit $120,000 by end-2024 \u2014 would likely spill over into ether, while the upcoming bitcoin halving next year would put upside pressure on crypto in general.\n\nPositive regulator developments, such as the approval of crypto spot ETFs, would also benefit ether.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBoth bitcoin and ether will see a considerable boost from the end of the bond market sell-off, which has seen Treasury yields surge to 16 year highs."

If implemented, it would allow \u201csidechains\u201d to be built on the network.\n\nOn Oct. 9, Bitcoin developer Robin Linus released a white paper titled \u201cBitVM: Compute Anything on Bitcoin,\u201d which details how Ethereum-like optimistic rollup smart contracts could be made on the Bitcoin network.\n\nRelated: El Salvador\u2019s Bitcoiners teach 12-year-olds how to send sats\n\nUnlike the Spiderchain, BIP-300 would require Bitcoin to soft fork and would be activated by miners \u2014 similar to the Taproot soft fork in November 2021 that paved the way for the NFT-emulating Ordinals and BRC-20 tokens.\n\nThe BIP\u2019s creator, Paul Sztorc, says those favoring BIP-300 believe it will offer new privacy and scaling use cases to Bitcoin, among other benefits.\n\nSo far at @tabconf:\n\n\n\n* Many pro Bip300 -- popular usecases are Privacy, Scaling, and experimentation (get new OP codes now)\n\n* Very popular question is: when is my debate with Peter Todd (Friday at 2 PM)\n\n* Many complained about off-base Twitter dialog and nonsense propaganda\n\n*\u2026 \u2014 Paul Sztorc (@Truthcoin) September 7, 2023\n\nHowever, not everyone likes the idea of expanding Bitcoin\u2019s ecosystem beyond its current use cases.\n\nCory Klippsten, the CEO of BTC-only exchange Swan Bitcoin, believes drivechains and solutions that bring other assets to Bitcoin will bring an influx of scammers.\n\nSaifedean Ammous, the author of The Bitcoin Standard, opposes the idea of issuing altcoins on Bitcoin, suggesting that \u201cgood money\u201d is the only token needed.\n\nPeople only think tokens are a good idea because we live in a world of broken money.

Bitcoin is going to detokenize the world. https://t.co/q8Nhc7XcOX \u2014 Saifedean Ammous (@saifedean) August 28, 2023\n\nHowever, Schro\u00e9 said he thinks bringing together Bitcoin and Ethereum could produce a new array of applications \u201cwith decentralization and security as first principles.\u201c\n\n\u201cEVM is the winning virtual machine, and Bitcoin is the best money,\u201d he said.\n\nMagazine: Ethereum is eating the world \u2014 \u2018You only need one internet\u2019"

However, in a bid for the best of both worlds, developer Robin Linus has proposed a groundbreaking upgrade that could revolutionize Bitcoin\u2019s technical capabilities, potentially rendering altcoins obsolete.\n\nDo Anything on Bitcoin\n\nOn October 9, Linus published a whitepaper titled \u201cBitVM: Compute Anything on Bitcoin\u201d, which detailed proposals for enhancing Bitcoin\u2019s technical capabilities and functionality without requiring a fork of the code or changes to the consensus rules, thus preserving Bitcoin\u2019s integrity.\n\nAccording to the white paper, the basic architecture of the upgrade moves computational load off the technologically limited base layer, relying instead on the off-chain interaction between a prover and a verifier. The prover claims a function produces a specific output for certain inputs while the verifier assesses the prover\u2019s claim.\n\n\u201cAs long as both parties collaborate, they can perform arbitrarily complex, stateful off-chain computation, without leaving any trace in the chain,\u201d read the BitVM whitepaper.\n\nCurrent Bitcoin smart contract capabilities are reduced to basic metadata, such as signatures and time locks. Still, BitVM enables a more expressive smart contract design, opening up new possibilities, including games, proof verification, bridges, and prediction markets. Nonetheless, BitVM faces several technical and practical challenges to overcome.\n\nChallenges and Limitations\n\nDetailing the limitations, Linus mentioned that BitVM could be more efficient by utilizing Bitcoin\u2019s higher-level operations, including script support for 32-bit numbers and fully using each block\u2019s 4MB capacity.\n\nFurther limitations lie in the model\u2019s two-party setup of prover and verifier. However, Linus revealed that research is underway to extend the system to include more participants, including exploring the possibility of chaining two-way channels together.\n\nBitcoin developer \u201cBob Bodily\u201d waded into the discussion to voice multiple drawbacks with BitVM, including it being slower, more expensive, and more complicated than Ethereum\u2019s virtual machine (EVM).\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nBitcoin has a history of proposals that struggle to gain traction , such as OKX \u2019s BRC-30 token standard .\n\nAlts provide a ground-up design to accommodate sophisticated functionality, whereas BitVM approaches the issue as an afterthought.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nSome have criticized Bitcoin as an inflexible protocol that cannot evolve. However, BitVM is challenging this notion and demonstrating that Bitcoin has the potential to compete with other cryptocurrencies in terms of functionality.\n\nFind out more details on CZ\u2019s post-halving Bitcoin price prediction here:\n\nCZ Forecasts Bitcoin\u2019s Next Future Peak: Here\u2019s When\n\n\n\nDiscover why the community is pushing back against THORSwap reinstating swap functionality here:\n\nTHORSwap Token Swaps Return, But at What Cost?"

        "content": "Quick Take\n\nRecent market data underscores a significant shift in cryptocurrency dynamics as Bitcoin\u2019s dominance over altcoins, like Ethereum and BNB, surges forward. Yesterday marked a notable sell-off in altcoins, encompassing all cryptocurrencies besides Bitcoin. This sell-off has led to Binance Coin (BNB) and Ethereum (ETH) reaching new lows against Bitcoin this cycle.\n\nWhen evaluated in terms of USD, Binance Coin hit $208 for the third time. The Ethereum to Bitcoin ratio plunged to an all-time low of $0.057. Interestingly, Ethereum\u2019s USD-denominated value avoided hitting a new low, holding steady above its previous low of $1,544 in September.\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin has been steadily amplifying its market cap dominance, now accounting for more than 51%, and seems to be approaching a new cycle high. This shift indicates a possible investor preference towards Bitcoin, the world\u2019s largest and most established cryptocurrency, over its smaller counterparts like Ethereum and Binance Coin."

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nCharles Hoskinson addressed misconceptions surrounding the Hydra project in a YouTube video.\n\nHoskinson emphasized that Cardano\u2019s goals have evolved beyond increasing transaction per second (TPS) metrics.\n\nThe founder and Cardano remain under pressure after calling their biggest competitor a \u2018dumpster fire.\u2019\n\nCardano co-founder Charles Hoskinson has finally responded to the growing chorus of criticism aimed at the Hydra project. After his public swipes at Ethereum and its limited transactions-per-second (TPS) potential, Hoskinson found himself on the back foot amid accusations of dishonesty around Hydra\u2019s capabilities, but he has attempted to face these down with a rebuttal in a YouTube video.\n\nOn Hydra Scaling https://t.co/u5tl7FBI9A \u2014 Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) October 5, 2023\n\nHydra\u2019s Potential for Scalability\n\nTo improve scalability through a novel approach to transaction processing, Cardano created Hydra. Additionally, the project has been enhancing Hydra\u2019s functionality since its conception. New Application Programming Interfaces, for instance, were released by updated Hydra for Web3.0 developers to use.\n\nHoskinson explained that over three years, Hydra made a slight pivot and changed its focus to: \u201clet\u2019s build some middleware that is going to be really easy for you as a developer to plug into your application work with Plutus to help get a lot of that complex logic that should not run on the main network but run it in a different network.\u201d\n\nHowever, Hoskinson was faced with allegations of deceit regarding the Hydra project. To demonstrate Cardano\u2019s throughput potential, he unveiled a TPS graphic that showed roughly 1,000 TPS, yet the narrative built that Hydra could lead to 1 million TPS. A Cadano developer has refuted this.\n\nNo it is not. Please stop spreading the \"1 million tps\" narrative \ud83d\ude4f, it is misleading. If you need more information about what is Hydra and what can it do, check: \u2013 https://t.co/D3xqC2Z6Fs\n\n\u2013 https://t.co/1x2x1CARLK\n\n\u2013 https://t.co/s5rSg1O9rw \u2014 KtorZ (@_KtorZ_) May 13, 2023\n\nThe ambiguous nature of Hydra\u2019s potential and the narrative that built around its incredible TPS led many to question the founder of the project, yet he has come out in defense of Hydra and what has been said previously.\n\nHoskinson responded to the most recent skepticism and false information on their initiative. He claims that the majority of people spread misinformation online to damage Cardano\u2019s reputation.\n\n\u201cEvery time a lie is said, it takes ten times as much effort to undo that in people\u2019s memory. So, when people run around and say Hydra\u2019s failed, we lied about Hydra, there\u2019s no way to achieve any of these performance claims\u2026then what they\u2019re really doing is they\u2019re taking the hard work of dozens of people and everybody building on it,\u201d he stated .\n\nHe added this is not okay, and it\u2019s not fair, and it has to stop.\n\n\u201cYou know the internet has become a cesspool where everything goes, and misinformation spreads, and people absorb it and does have an impact,\u201d he said .\n\nHoskinson emphasized that Cardano is a credible project thanks to extensive study, open-source contributions from worldwide developers and engineers, and peer-reviewed fundamentals. Additionally, the ongoing initiatives to enhance the blockchain and provide cutting-edge solutions suggest a promising future for cryptocurrencies.\n\nEthereum As a \u2018Dumpster Fire\u2019\n\nHoskinson has often been a controversial figure and recently made a risky statement on Twitter by outlining some of Cardano\u2019s greatest advantages over Ethereum.\n\nIn his response, Hoskinson primarily criticized Ethereum while also showcasing the advantages of his own system.\n\nAs part of the team that launched Ethereum, Hoskinson has a good understanding of the project, but he has been a long-time skeptic of the second-largest cryptocurrency by market caps and its potential to be a \u2018World Computer.\u2019 His outspoken attacks on Ethereum may be at the heart of some of the backlash he is getting for positioning Hydra as a superior offering.\n\nIt's getting delusion town now. Hydra is live on mainnet and evolving fast. Mithril is live as well and the first step towards a rich DA and light client strategy. We already designed a significantly better way of handling transactions via tiered pricing and Babel fees. There's\u2026 https://t.co/2cJa8ivJGu \u2014 Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) August 17, 2023\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, Ethereum has a dumpster fire of a consensus layer, has a terrible programming model that they can\u2019t change, and are getting eaten alive by their own layer 2 ecosystem,\u201c he said.\n\nSEC Not Pursuing ADA\n\nDespite the backlash he faces for Hydra, Hoskinson stated in a recent interview that he doesn\u2019t think the American Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will pursue the project\u2019s native coin, ADA, as a security.\n\nHe emphasized that despite the fact that ADA was listed as a security in a complaint against a cryptocurrency exchange, there hasn\u2019t been any enforcement action taken against it thus far, and that won\u2019t change.\n\nThe SEC recently declared approximately 12 tokens, including Cardano (ADA), Binance Coin (BNB), Solana (SOL), Polygon (MATIC), and Filecoin (FIL), to be securities and demanded that they be registered before being listed on exchanges in two lawsuits brought against the world\u2019s two largest cryptocurrency exchanges, Coinbase and Binance.\n\nHoskinson highlighted that the SEC\u2019s activities have not affected ADA in answer to a query about why the agency has been acting \u201csomewhat antagonistically towards Cardano\u201d and other blockchains."

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) has maintained its spot as a leading altcoin. However, a recent analysis from Benjamin Cowen indicates that its journey, at least in comparison to Bitcoin (BTC), could have followed a better trajectory.\n\nIn a space where past trends can sometimes indicate future outcomes, ETH\u2019s price behavior, when viewed against BTC, offers a tale of potential concern.\n\nEthereum Stumbling Blocks In 2023\n\nA leading voice in the crypto analytical community, Benjamin Cowen, expressed his lack of enthusiasm for ETH\u2019s performance in 2023 during a YouTube video. The ETH / BTC valuation, a critical metric for gauging relative performance, is the bedrock for his statements.\n\nAccording to his observations from monthly charts, Cowen\u2019s analysis primarily orbits around the ETH / Bitcoin valuation, which has trended downwards.\n\nThe analyst cites patterns from 2019, a pre-halving year, where ETH\u2019s value relative to BTC fell significantly. That year alone, the ETH / BTC valuation declined by about 49%.\n\nAccording to the analyst, fast forward to 2023, and ETH\u2019s comparative valuation has already plummeted by 20.56%. If Cowen\u2019s prediction and the patterns from 2019 hold any water, Ethereum could be staring down a deeper abyss.\n\nYet, it\u2019s not all bleak. Cowen remains measured, as he acknowledges the change the nature of \u201cThe Merge\u201d brought on Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem, believing it is a \u201cgame changer.\u201d While Cowen wasn\u2019t overly optimistic, the analyst refrained from forecasting ETH\u2019s next moves, primarily due to the unpredictable ripple effects of The Merge.\n\nThe Merge: A Game-Changing Variable?\n\nThe Merge, a much-anticipated Ethereum upgrade, has already marked its influence on the ETH / BTC valuation. Ethereum\u2019s weekly charts have been in a continuous downtrend following its implementation, creating further lows.\n\nCowen recognizes that The Merge, with its deflationary component, could mean ETH might not toe its historical line. This deflationary aspect could be Ethereum\u2019s wild card, making its trajectory even more elusive.\n\nNotably, while many parallels might be drawn between 2019 and 2023, such updates as The Merge means that Ethereum\u2019s journey this year might still hold a few surprises.\n\nMeanwhile, the Ethereum price against the US dollar has seen quite a bearish trend, particularly over the past week. The second largest crypto by market capitalization has plunged nearly 5% in the past 7 days, bringing its price to fall below $1,600 with a current trading price of $1,569.\n\nFeatured image from Unsplash, Chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

As this bear stretch continues, which the analyst expects to be even longer, they see a high possibility of the Ethereum price reaching as low as $900 once more, as shown in the chart below.\n\nDespite being seemingly convinced about ETH\u2019s price decline, the analysis still needs confirmation. Their explanation which is shown in the chart as well asks to wait for the price to break below the $1,510 level for this to take place.\n\nETH price falls to $1,567 | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nBearish Going Into The Bitcoin Halving\n\nAs the analyst explains, the bearish expectation is not localized to just the Ethereum price alone. It seems to encompass the whole market which the analyst believes has finished out its half bullish stretch and has now entered into the bearish half that often leads up to the halving. As the analyst puts it, this indicates \u201cthat it\u2019s the turn of the bears by now.\u201d\n\nThis school of thought is not new and is actually backed up by historical data. When looking at the charts of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, it shows that there was a bearish stretch leading up to the Bitcoin halving. After the event, this trend tends to reverse, which then signals the start of the bull market.\n\nIn the months leading up to the 2020 halving event, the price of Ethereum saw a sharp decline that put its price in the $120 region before picking back up. So if there is a repeat of this, then FieryTrading\u2019s analysis for ETH could play out.\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "A report out Wednesday argues that the price of the ethereum cryptocurrency may eventually climb as high as $35,000. Ether's price has been stuck alongside bitcoin's this year, but patient investors with a long horizon could be rewarded as ethereum reclaims its dominance in crypto's smart contracts space and new use cases emerge, according to Standard Chartered. In recent years, a wave of ethereum competitors have emerged to challenge the flagship Web3 blockchain network's high fees and slow processing times, including Solana , Cardano and Polkadot . Now, \"layer 2\" scaling solutions and new use cases are becoming \"ever more important\" and could help lift the price of ether 5x in the next three years before rocketing even higher, Standard Chartered said in a note Wednesday. \"We expect further change ahead,\" said Geoff Kendrick, an analyst at the London-based bank. \"Layer 2 scaling solutions \u2026 are likely to grow in importance over time, particularly as architecture upgrades expected in early 2024 sharply lower fees on these platforms. This should help to cement ETH's dominance in the smart contract space, thereby increasing its P/E ratio (if not its earnings) over the next couple of years.\" \"Layer 2\" solutions such as Arbitrum and Optimism are developed on ethereum itself to enhance its efficiency and help keep transactions within the ethereum ecosystem, rather than moving to a competing network in an attempt to find lower fees. Keeping activity on ethereum should increase the token's price-to-earnings ratio, Kendrick said. \"We think Ethereum's established dominance in smart contract platforms, along with emerging uses in gaming and tokenization, has the potential to push ETH to the $8,000 level by end-2026,\" he added. That level is \"a stepping stone to our long-term 'structural' valuation estimate of $26,000-$35,000,\" he added. ETH.CM= 1Y mountain Ether (ETH) over the past year That valuation assumes future use cases and revenue streams that may not exist yet, Kendrick noted. He highlighted gaming and tokenization of real-world assets as the next big use cases for the network. Both could add demand to its existing nonfungible token and decentralized finance channels, respectively, by giving \"real world\" companies and industries examples of how and why they could benefit from moving certain processes onto ethereum. Standard Chartered expects \"significant developments on these fronts by 2025-26,\" Kendrick said. \u2014 CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed reporting."

        "title": "Are Ethereum ETFs Already A Failure? - CoinGape",
        "content": "Despite the highly anticipated launch of Ethereum ETFs in the United States, hopes of a significant boost to Ethereum price have remained unfulfilled as the cryptocurrency continues to underperform Bitcoin (BTC). But, is this a short term trend and is there a comeback around the corner?\n\nBitcoin Outperforms Ethereum Despite Ether ETFs\n\nIn a blog post on Monday, crypto research firm Kaiko analyzed this trend, highlighting what could have caused Ether\u2019s weakness. Notably, last week marked the launch of six futures-based ETH ETFs on U.S. markets, following an earlier-than-expected approval by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). However, these ETFs failed to generate significant trading volume or provide the anticipated boost to the overall crypto market.\n\nadvertisement\n\nAccording to Kaiko, among these newly launched ETFs by VanEck and ProShares, the two largest by trade volume struggled to achieve an average daily trade volume of just $0.5 million during their initial week of trading.\n\nIn contrast, the first Bitcoin futures ETF, ProShares Bitcoin Strategy (BITO), attracted more than $1 billion in trade volume on its debut day. The firm attributes the dull response to launch of Ethereum ETFs to the prevailing market conditions, marked by a September surge in risk-free rates driven by robust U.S. economic data and escalating macroeconomic uncertainties. These factors, it noted, have diminished interest in riskier assets such as cryptocurrencies.\n\nEthereum\u2019s underperformance compared to the broader crypto market has also been evident since \u201cthe Merge\u201d with the ETH/BTC price ratio and volume being on a downward trend over the past year.\n\n\u201cETH\u2019s underperformance is likely due to the ongoing impact of the bear market, which historically has seen traders turn to BTC, the oldest and largest crypto asset,\u201d Kaiko wrote.\n\nAdditionally, despite the increase in open interest for ETH perpetual futures since early September, funding rates have also stayed neutral to negative, indicating a lack of clear market direction.\n\nAre Institutions Buying Ether ETFs?\n\nHowever, Kaiko noted that even though ETH futures ETFs did not attract significant trading volume, they still provide a liquid, cost-efficient, and transparent way for investors to gain exposure to Ethereum. This could potentially alter institutional investors\u2019 perceptions of ETH, which currently remains strongly correlated with BTC, despite their conceptual differences.\n\nMeanwhile, ETH extended its losses on Monday, after shedding approximately 7% over the past week to reach a trading price of $1,569. This contrasts BTC which was trading at $27,401 after losing just 2.22% over the same period."

This optimistic view is anchored in Ethereum's growing role in smart contracts, gaming and the tokenization of traditional assets. Geoff Kendrick, StanChart Head of FX Research, also hinted at a more ambitious long-term structural valuation ranging from $26,000 to $35,000 by 2040, supported by emerging real-world use cases.\n\nNot everyone is bullish\n\nDespite Standard Chartered's bullish outlook, other industry voices hold a more cautious perspective on Ethereum.\n\nNotably, after the Shanghai upgrade in April, daily transactions on the Ethereum network experienced a 12% decline, as reported by JPMorgan Chase. Analysts at the bank, spearheaded by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, expressed concerns regarding the platform's dwindling network activity.\n\nDaily active addresses experienced a massive 20% decrease. Moreover, the total value locked on the Ethereum network plunged by 8%.\n\nFurthermore, the launch of nine Ether futures ETFs showed lackluster performance, pushing K33 Research analysts to advocate for a shift back to Bitcoin.\n\nEthereum's declining market share\n\nAs Ethereum faces challenges, Bitcoin's market dominance is on an upward trajectory. The market share of the top cryptocurrency is now inching close to 50%, according to CoinGecko data.\n\nOver the past week, Bitcoin has seen a less sharp decline of 1.7% compared to Ethereum's 4.6%.\n\nAdding to this, Bitcoin's market share recently reached a three-month high, further emphasizing the flagship cryptocurrency's rising dominance in the space, even as altcoins underperform."

Ethereum and Solana provide a great example of what is possible for a protocol that can attract a large amount of developers, build a usable platform, and gain a loyal network of users. When done right, there is clearly a lot of value that can be created for investors.\u201d\n\nFidelity goes on to say that those who invest in non-Bitcoin (BTC) digital assets tend to take small positions in many different altcoins rather than just one, giving them options in an increasingly complex and growing crypto landscape.\n\n\u201cGiven the increased amount of competition and potential paths of failure for many of these projects, allocating to non-Bitcoin tokens is often done with a venture capital-like mindset. Instead of picking one particular project, investment allocators typically take small positions across many individual names.\n\nThis typically results in seeking out an actively managed solution to deal with the increase in overall complexity. Again, this shows a stark contrast to a simple Bitcoin-only approach to digital assets.\u201d\n\nEthereum is trading for $1,565 at time of writing, a fractional decrease on the day while Solana is moving for $22.07.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Cowen, who has gained prominence for his insightful analyses, shared his latest findings on the trajectory of Ethereum (ETH) against Bitcoin (BTC), which may send shockwaves through the crypto space.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Cowen's analysis, Ethereum is set to endure a significant setback, with a projected 40% fall against Bitcoin. Cowen substantiated his claim by pointing to the continuous decline of the ETH/BTC ratio, emphasizing that this decline might mark the culmination of the altcoin reckoning.\n\nThe expert's prediction was underscored by a detailed chart he shared on social media, illustrating Ethereum's potential fall from its current position of 0.057 BTC to a worrisome low of 0.035 BTC.\n\nJust a continuous bleed by #ETH / #BTC.\n\n\n\nRemember the collapse of the ETH/BTC ratio could also correspond to the end of the altcoin reckoning. pic.twitter.com/dhaNiBNz3B \u2014 Benjamin Cowen (@intocryptoverse) October 10, 2023\n\nThis dire forecast is not the first of its kind from Cowen.

Despite the gradual pace of the decline, Cowen remained steadfast in his analysis, reiterating his concerns last week about the ongoing downtrend.\n\nCowen's prediction is based on his assessment of the growing dominance of Bitcoin and the consistent drain of liquidity from the broader cryptocurrency market.

Since February 2023, Ethereum whales, typically large holders with significant influence on market movements, have been consistently cashing in on the elevated prices. Their actions have led to the offloading or redistribution of over 5 million ETH, translating to an approximate value of $8.5 billion.\n\nThis whale-driven exodus is not a fleeting event.

Strong support lies at $1,498.81, with resistance hovering around the $1,666.23 mark. While the token has impressed with a 22% growth over the past year, outperforming 84% of the top 100 crypto assets, its recent performance raises eyebrows. Out of the last 30 days, only 16 have been in the green, at 53%, and is currently trading at $1,589.\n\nETH 1 day price chart.

Not to mention Ethereum is also down 67% from its all-time high.\n\nIn the fast-paced world of cryptocurrencies, the movements of big players, or \u2018whales\u2019, can often provide early warning signs of impending market shifts.\n\nWhile Ethereum\u2019s long-term prospects remain promising, given its historical performance and the myriad of real-world applications it supports, the recent actions of whales, coupled with some concerning technical indicators, suggest that investors should proceed with caution.\n\nFor now, the market watches and waits, with many hoping for a return to bullish sentiment soon.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

Notably, its novel idea, which aims to revolutionize the trading ecosystem, has been met with enthusiasm. Consequently, over $6.4 million has been raised in the ongoing presale, and more than 18,000 users have been onboarded.\n\nIts unique solution in the crypto landscape will be a hybrid trading platform that intersects with centralized and decentralized exchanges. Therefore, users will enjoy the best of both worlds, including anonymity, institutional-level liquidity, and high leverage, to mention a few.\n\nFurthermore, as an all-in-one trading platform, users will be able to trade diverse assets, not limited to cryptocurrencies. As a result, it will enable users to trade stocks, forex, commodities, and other financial instruments, in addition to cryptocurrency. Interestingly, all of this will be on a single account.\n\nMoreover, it will be the only trading platform that allows users to deposit crypto and use it as collateral to trade derivatives without the need for KYC checks. Hence, by providing deep liquidity across thousands of assets and promising full anonymity, Tradecurve Markets is set to disrupt the trading world.\n\nMeanwhile, its ongoing presale offers the opportunity to be an early adopter of the exciting project. The presale phase is currently at stage 6 at a price of only $0.03, which analysts forecast will rise by 100x after launch. Therefore, it comes as little surprise that investors in well-established tokens like Ethereum Classic and Aave are actively participating in its presale.\n\nFor more information about the Tradecurve Markets (TCRV) presale:\n\nWebsite: https://tradecurvemarkets.com/\n\nBuy presale: https://tradecurvemarkets.com/sign-up\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Tradecurveapp"

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nCrypto analyst @sunnydecree has taken to the X app (formerly known as Twitter) to share the news that Bitcoin whales have proven to be harder holders and believers in their favorite crypto than Ethereum holders.\n\nDespite both leading cryptos trading in the lows at the moment, unlike BTC whales, large Ethereum holders are selling their ETH hard. According to the chart, ETH whales did the same in 2018, when the crypto winter started.\n\nEthereum whales are selling like there is no tomorrow. #Bitcoin whales keep hodling. pic.twitter.com/4ZL43AXyQJ \u2014 sunnydecree (@sunnydecree) October 10, 2023\n\nEthereum price action vs. Bitcoin performance\n\nOverall, taking into account the small price recovery that occurred earlier today, since the start of the week, the second largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum, has lost 3.70%, dropping from $1,634 to the $1,573 level, where it is currently exchanging hands.\n\nEthereum is following the example of the marker leader Bitcoin, which has declined by 2.75% since Monday, now trading at $27,164. The drop took place due to the recent Stars Arena hack and the continuation of challenging geopolitical events in the Middle East.\n\nCrypto analyst Ali Martinez expects Ethereum to demonstrate a steep correction if it shows a daily close above the $1,530 level. Currently, ETH is hovering above a critical demand zone.\n\nTop 10 largest wallets stocking up on Ethereum\n\nDespite small and medium-sized whales selling off their Ethereum holdings, the 10 largest nonexchange and exchange wallets continue to accumulate more and more Ethereum.\n\nAccording to data recently shared by the Santiment on-chain data agency, the top 10 ETH wallets linked to crypto exchanges contain 8.81% of the entire Ethereum supply, while the 10 largest addresses not connected to exchanges hold a staggering stash of 39.11 million ETH."

If you encounter any issues, kindly report them to [email protected]. Crypto assets/products can be highly risky. Never invest unless you\u2019re prepared to lose all the money you invest.\n\nIn the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrency, where volatility often dictates the mood of the market, three top crypto coins have captured investors\u2019 attention. While Ethereum is showing signs of a bullish turnaround, Neo and InQubeta ($QUBE) are also positioning themselves as frontrunners in this race of technological advancement and investment returns.\n\nInQubeta ($QUBE): The Best ICO in AI Crypto space?\n\nEven before we delve into the dynamics of Ethereum and Neo, it\u2019s essential to spotlight InQubeta, a name that has been resonating louder and louder within the corridors of blockchain and AI technology. As we stand on the cusp of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, where AI technology is poised to reshape industries, InQubeta emerges as a beacon of hope for investors seeking entry into this realm.\n\nA revolutionary platform, InQubeta offers a unique proposition \u2013 fractional investments in promising AI start-ups through its proprietary QUBE token. The opportunities are minted into trending NFTs, which represent a stake in growing ventures. This democratizes the investment landscape, bridging the often-wide gap between innovative start-ups and potential investors.\n\nInQubeta\u2019s model is not merely a conceptual novelty; its presale has witnessed an overwhelming response, raising over $3.4 million, which speaks volumes about its promise and the trust of its community. The deflationary ERC20 coin also rewards its holders through staking, establishing it as the best crypto investment option for those forecasting the growth trajectory of AI technology start-ups.\n\nEthereum (ETH): The Bullish Resurgence\n\nTurning our attention to one of the best altcoins, its current trading trajectory has caught the eye of many technical analysts. The Falling Wedge pattern, generally considered a bullish signal, seems to be indicating that Ethereum is gearing up for a significant move. This pattern often suggests that selling pressure is tapering off, pointing towards a possible reversal.\n\nThe real catch here is Ethereum\u2019s position relative to the crucial $2,000 threshold. With the Falling Wedge in play and various other indicators turning favorable, Ethereum breaking past this mark appears increasingly likely. Should it push through, this could pave the way for further upward momentum, possibly reigniting enthusiasm among Ethereum enthusiasts and investors.\n\nNeo (NEO): The Dark Horse on the Rise\n\nNeo, often termed the \u201cEthereum of China,\u201d has consistently showcased its capabilities as a robust platform for creating a range of decentralized applications. With its unique dual-token mechanism and focus on digital identity and assets, Neo has carved its niche in the blockchain space.\n\nThough not as much in the limelight as Ethereum, recent movements and developments associated with Neo hint at a simmering potential waiting to be unleashed. Investors are keenly observing its trajectory, weighing the possibilities it presents in the broader crypto landscape.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nAs the crypto market continues to navigate through a maze of uncertainties and promises, Ethereum\u2019s prospective breakthrough, combined with the potential of Neo and the burgeoning promise of InQubeta, presents a narrative of opportunities for investors. While Ethereum\u2019s technicals suggest a bullish horizon, InQubeta, with its groundbreaking model, is rapidly cementing its position as a game-changer in the AI-centric crypto space. Meanwhile, Neo, with its unique offerings, is quietly gearing up for what could be a significant phase of growth.\n\nIt\u2019s an exciting time to be a part of the crypto ecosystem. With such promising narratives unfolding, the future indeed seems laden with possibilities.\n\nVisit InQubeta Presale\n\nJoin The InQubeta Communities"

        "content": "Top 3 Price Predictions: Bitcoin, Ethereum, and eTukTuk Forecasts for 2023\n\nDisclaimer: The text below is a press release that is not part of Cryptonews.com editorial content.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum continue to dominate the market uncontested. But their performance over the last few months has been lackluster. Do they have what it takes to give generous returns to investors this year?\n\nOr, is it time for investors to start looking for emerging alternatives like eTukTuk for that 10X price surge? Here is an analysis.\n\nCan Bitcoin Price Climb to $50K in 2023?\n\nThe Bitcoin price has been hovering below $30,000 over the past couple of months. But long-term investors are optimistic that a potential price reversal is just around the corner.\n\nThey\u2019re not completely wrong. Bitcoin appears to be slowly regaining its footing, and the Bitcoin halving event scheduled for April 2024 is likely to play a key role in shaping its price trajectory.\n\nAccording to analysts, Bitcoin could climb to as high as $100,000 in the weeks leading up to this event. Investors are expanding their BTC portfolio and cherishing this dream.\n\nBitcoin 1-year price action, CoinMarketCap\n\nBut such a rapid ascent to $100,000 is unrealistic. If BTC were to hit $100,000 by April 2024, it should have begun the climb long back. That has led a substantial portion of analysts to predict a more conservative target of $50,000 for BTC.\n\nThere are also less popular opinions that BTC could experience a significant dip, potentially to as low as $20,000, ahead of the halving event. High-cap assets like BTC are losing their grip among young investors who have faced losses since 2021.\n\nBTC\u2019s price trajectory in the coming months will be crucial to its journey ahead. If it fails to cross the $40,000 mark by the year\u2019s end, a cascade of sell-offs may follow.\n\nEthereum will Flat-Line into 2024\n\nETH has to be one of the most disappointing cryptocurrencies of 2023. Despite the growth of the underlying blockchain and its unrivaled dominance, ETH has not managed to target a price point above $2K.\n\nEthereum 1-year price action, CoinMarketCap\n\nIt is likely to flat-line into 2024, as a result. But if the broader market perks follow in the lead of Bitcoin, Ethereum will also benefit from the enthusiasm. In that case, it has the potential to climb anywhere from 25% to 30% up the charts.\n\nBut whether or not it will be able to retain the price surge depends on a wide range of factors. The general market environment plays a key role in that. ETH investors targeting anywhere above $2K are going to be disappointed, however.\n\neTukTuk Provides Hope\n\neTukTuk is one of the most promising cryptocurrencies to enter the market this year. The utility-first project is led by the vision to introduce a rich EV infrastructure to developing economies. It is widely touted as the Tesla of developing nations for the same reason.\n\nThe best that established cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and Bitcoin can hope in a year is 50% to 100% above their current price. Robust new cryptocurrencies like eTukTuk, on the other hand, have the potential to complete that trajectory in less than a few days.\n\neTukTuk, being still in the presale phase, provides a large room for growth.\n\nHigh market relevance\n\nDeveloping economies stand to gain a lot from the shift to electric vehicles (EVs). To begin with, their large traffic congestion leads to higher levels of air pollution. EVs, being powered by greener electricity, leave less carbon footprint.\n\nThe reduced operational and maintenance cost associated with EVs is another benefit. Local drivers can benefit from up to a 400% surge in income by switching to eTukTuk.\n\nBut the affordability of EVs remains a considerable challenge for people living in developing countries. EVs require higher initial capital than their traditional, carbon-intensive counterparts. Moreover, private vehicle ownership remains an elusive dream for the majority of them.\n\nHere, public transportation options like buses, trains, metros, and Tuk Tuks are the norm. Three-wheeler taxis called Tuk Tuks strike a perfect balance between affordability and convenience. But they emit more CO2 than the average car and are a major contributor to air pollution.\n\nHow eTukTuk makes a difference\n\nHere are the key features of eTukTuk:\n\nA streamlined design comprised of fewer than 200 components enables local manufacturing. That, in turn, cuts down their initial capital investment.\n\nPrioritizes safety with patented roll cage designs and the use of LFP batteries.\n\nCutting-edge AI solutions boost driver efficiency, optimize routes, ensure efficient battery consumption, and accurately predict recharging schedules.\n\neTukTuk operates within a peer-to-peer economy that rewards all participants \u2013 Territory Partners, Drivers, and Power Stakers.\n\nThe project also has a play-to-earn game in development that offers users an additional source of income from the comfort of their homes.\n\nHow high can TUK go?\n\nTUK is the native crypto of eTukTuk that is now selling for its presale price. That gives users an attractive opportunity to buy the token before it hits public exchanges and take advantage of its upcoming price surges.\n\nTUK works best as a long-term investment with the potential to surge 80X to 100X in a year. FOMO gives it short-term growth potential, ranging from 1500% to 2000% this year."

        "content": "Share this article URL Copied\n\nEthereum is known for its high gas fees, which have been a significant roadblock to mainstream adoption. Yet, Ethereum gas prices have dropped to all-time lows in recent days, with the average Ethereum gas price reaching 8.8 gwei this week, surpassing the previous record low of 8.9 gwei set in January 2020, according to Etherscan data.\n\nGwei, short for gigawei, refers to the denomination used to calculate gas fees on the Ethereum network. One gwei is equal to 0.000000001 ETH.\n\nOne reason for lower costs is increased usage of layer 2 scaling solutions like Optimism and Arbitrum, which reduce congestion on the main Ethereum chain by processing transactions off-chain.\n\nEthereum\u2019s scaling solutions have seen a surge in both adoption and value. The total value locked (TVL) in L2 networks has soared to $10.5 billion, more than double from the previous year, according to L2Beat data. In contrast, Ethereum\u2019s TVL has experienced a drop of over 30% in the past year, settling at $20 billion.\n\nAdditionally, transaction volumes and active users on Ethereum have dropped over the past year as the broader crypto market has slumped. This lower demand for block space reduces competition for transactions, allowing fees to drop.\n\nEthereum\u2019s average weekly transactions are down nearly 20% over the last year, while the weekly average number of active Ethereum addresses is also down more than 20%, according to IntoTheBlock data."

        "content": "A closely followed crypto strategist says he is flipping bullish on Bitcoin (BTC) after the king crypto dipped below the $28,000 level.\n\nPseudonymous analyst Credible Crypto tells his 346,700 followers on the social media platform X that BTC will likely reverse its downtrend after finding support at a key level.\n\n\u201cDid you flip bullish at the highs, anon?\n\nJust as I was short-term bearish at the highs a couple of days ago it\u2019s almost time to shift back to full bull.\n\nOnce we take the equal lows at $27,100 you\u2019re playing with fire if you\u2019re selling/short imo (in my opinion). HTF (high time frame) bullish above $24,800 means longs are the play under $27,000 imo.\u201d\n\nThe trader also warns that Bitcoin may dip below the key $27,000 level before the next leg up.\n\n\u201cTargeting $27,100 at minimum with a test of the mid-range at $26,700 seeming highly likely as well. Zooming out for some additional context, you can see that we have tons of liquidity built up below us after taking liquidity above with plenty of rejection wicks to the upside.\n\nMeanwhile, OI (open interest) is peaking and has hit levels that have marked a local top the last five out of five times. The direction we are headed here is clear imo. The real question is how low we will go.\n\nRemember still high timeframe bullish and don\u2019t expect $24,800 to be breached. I think we test the midrange and if that holds, our bottom could come \u2018early.\u2019 Otherwise, we may be blessed with a quick push under $26,000 (but above $24,800) for an excellent low-risk, high-reward entry once more.\u201d\n\nBTC is trading for $27,441 at time of writing, down 0.6% in the last 24 hours.\n\nThe trader also looks at Ethereum (ETH) against Bitcoin and predicts ETH/BTC is heading even lower in the near term before a trend reversal.\n\n\u201cETH/BTC is down nearly 30% from when I made this post calling for a 50%-plus drop on the pairing. I know many are eyeing up current levels for a higher low/bottom on the pairing, but with BTC\u2019s largest upside moves yet to come, we are going much much lower on ETH/BTC imo.\n\nAfter this bleed-down comes a mega melt-up. We get to enjoy the ride on BTC and then have the chance to enjoy a bigger ride on ETH and other alts soon after. Don\u2019t fear it, embrace it.\u201d\n\nETH/BTC is trading for 0.057 BTC ($1,567) at time of writing.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "The cryptocurrency market has been under significant pressure recently, shedding more than 3% in value in just the past 24 hours. Among the major players, Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, seems to be on a bearish trajectory. This raises the question: Will Ethereum reach $1,000 mark once more?\n\nWhy is Ethereum Down?\n\nThe crypto market\u2019s resilience has been tested as prices failed to gain momentum. The purchasing power that typically drives up prices was noticeably absent. Instead of bolstering their crypto holdings, investors have become more cautious, pulling back on their acquisitions. This hesitancy can be attributed, in part, to the stock market\u2019s slight retraction, which itself is a reaction to the escalating conflict in the Middle East, particularly between Israel and Gaza. The geopolitical tensions have cast a shadow of uncertainty over global financial markets, including the realm of cryptocurrencies.\n\nEthereum Price Analysis: Ethereum Crash?\n\nA closer look at Ethereum\u2019s price movement reveals a concerning trend for its holders. Starting October at a price of $1,735, Ethereum has since declined to its current price of $1,562, marking a drop of approximately 10%. Over the past week alone, Ethereum has seen a reduction of more than 5% in its value. Such a rapid decline in a short span is a cause for concern for many investors and market analysts.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction: The Road to $1,000?\n\nThe critical question on many investors\u2019 minds is whether Ethereum could slide to the $1,000 mark. If Ethereum\u2019s price breaks below the significant support level of $1,500, it could indeed pave the way for a further decline towards $1,000. However, before reaching that point, Ethereum would need to breach several other support levels at $1,320 and $1,200. These support levels will be crucial in determining the cryptocurrency\u2019s medium-term trajectory.\n\nIf the broader crypto market continues its bearish trend, Ethereum\u2019s price could follow suit. The potential for Ethereum to drop to $1,000 is real, especially if global uncertainties persist and investor confidence remains shaken.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou might also like\n\nMore from Altcoin"

        "content": "A Bitcoin developer has proposed a new way to bring more expressive off-chain smart contracts to Bitcoin without needing a soft fork.\n\nAnnounced in an Oct. 9 white paper titled \u201cBitVM: Compute Anything on Bitcoin\u201d by ZeroSync project lead Robin Linus, BitVM enables Turing-complete Bitcoin contracts without altering Bitcoin\u2019s consensus rules.\n\n\"Any computable function can be verified on Bitcoin\"https://t.co/Itf9UHos0C pic.twitter.com/CLQv49Ydsg \u2014 \u044fobin linus (@robin_linus) October 9, 2023\n\nA Turing-complete system is one that can theoretically provide an answer to any computational problem.\n\nWith BitVM, the \u201clogic\u201d of Bitcoin contracts would be executed off-chain, but verification would be made on Bitcoin \u2014 similar to Ethereum\u2019s optimistic rollups.\n\nBitVM\u2019s architecture is based on fraud proofs and a challenge-response model where a \u201cprover\u201d can make claims and a \u201cverifier\u201d can perform a fraud proof to punish the prover when false claims are made.\n\nLinus explained that Bitcoin, in its current form, is limited to basic operations, such as signatures, timelocks and hashlocks \u2014 but that can now be broadened with BitVM, which Linus says can compute a host of interesting applications.\n\n\u201cPotential applications include games like Chess, Go, or Poker, and particularly, verification of validity proofs in Bitcoin contracts.\u201d\n\n\u201cAdditionally, it might be possible to bridge BTC to foreign chains, build a prediction market, or emulate novel opcodes,\u201d said Linus.\n\nLinus said a limitation of the model is that it is limited to a two-party setting with a prover and a verifier and that a significant amount of off-chain computation and communication is needed to execute programs.\n\nLinus said the next \u201cmilestone\u201d is to fully implement the BitVM in addition to Tree++, a high-level programming language to write and debug Bitcoin contracts.\n\nBitVM is enabled by the Taproot soft fork, which took place in November 2021.\n\nLinus cited Ethereum research into optimistic rollups and a study on Merkle trees in contributing to the eight-page white paper.\n\nBitcoiners respond to BitVM\n\nProminent Bitcoiner Eric Wall posted on X (Twitter) that the concepts outlined in the BitVM white paper \u201ccheck out\u201d and that he is \u201ccautiously excited\u201d to see what real-world experiments stem from it.\n\nBitcoin analyst Dylan LeClair is also impressed with BitVM\u2019s white paper. But Adam Back, a Bitcoin Core contributor, suggested that people shouldn\u2019t get too excited about the development just yet.\n\nfor people getting (over) excited, this is cool but effectively a generalization of a two-party game - it says right in the abstract - so it's a bit like Greg Maxwell's 2016 ZKP contingent payments implemented example https://t.co/OeHRsbFjud \u2014 Adam Back (@adam3us) October 9, 2023\n\nRelated: BIP-300 biff: Debate reignites over years-old Bitcoin Drivechain proposal\n\nOne builder in the blockchain space, \u201cdotta,\u201d noted that there is already a proof-of-concept on GitHub.\n\nAnother X user, Sam Parker, attempted to resolve a common fear among Bitcoin (BTC) maximalists by explaining that BitVM won\u2019t force Bitcoin\u2019s to be \u201clocked\u201d into these contracts.\n\n\u201cFinally, this is opt-in. If you don\u2019t trust your coins being locked to some Turing complete contract (totally reasonable) then don\u2019t lock them to a Turing complete smart contract. One of [the] beauties of the UTXO system is security sandboxing.\u201d\n\nOthers, such as \u201cPsage,\u201d say BitVM adds to the list of things that will push Bitcoin\u2019s price forward in the next bull market.\n\nThe bullish stuff around #Bitcoin is snowballing, lots of them controversial, nevertheless a few off my finger tips:\n\n- BitVM\n\n- Ordinals\n\n- Multiple Pres Candidates talking about it\n\n- ETF\n\n- Halving\n\n- Privacy improvements\n\n- Exponential Hash Rate increase\n\n- Countries mining\n\n.... \u2014 psage (@perspiringsage) October 9, 2023\n\nCointelegraph contacted Linus for comment but did not receive an immediate response.\n\nMagazine: Wolf Of All Streets worries about a world where Bitcoin hits $1M: Hall of Flame"

        "content": "One altcoin project soared over a 24-hour period as a crypto whale accumulated a massive amount of its tokens, according to on-chain data.\n\nBlockchain tracking firm Lookonchain says that the native token of the automated market maker (AMM) Bancor Network (BNT) witnessed a big burst to the upside in a day as a single wallet acquired millions of BNT.\n\nThe firm says that the wallet is thought to belong to Upbit, a South Korean cryptocurrency exchange.\n\n\u201cThe price of BNT has increased nearly 40% today. A wallet suspected to be Upbit has accumulated 4.71 million BNT ($2.54 million, 3.3% of the total supply) in the past 11 hours, which seems to be related to the rise in BNT price.\u201d\n\nAccording to the firm\u2019s chart, BNT was trading for $0.399 before rallying to around $0.55. The altcoin peaked at around $0.625 yesterday prior to witnessing a sell-off event.\n\nAt time of writing, BNT is trading for $0.52, down over 17% in the last 24 hours.\n\nThe firm also noticed that blockchain infrastructure provider Orbs (ORBS) rallied more than 40% in one day as crypto players sent the coin\u2019s trading volume soaring.\n\n\u201cThe price of ORBS surged by 43% today. 93.8% of the trading volume came from the Korean exchange Upbit, and 4.8% came from the Korean exchange Bithumb.\n\n(Investment firm) DWF Labs deposited 24 million ORBS ($792,000) into Bithumb after the price increase.\u201d\n\nThe firm\u2019s daily chart shows Orbs shooting up from $0.02297 to $0.033.\n\nOrbs has since retraced and is trading for $0.026 at time of writing, down nearly 9% in the past day.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "The non-profit arm of the Ethereum Foundation sold some of its holdings.\n\nTraders opened more short positions moments after the sale.\n\nOn-chain data from Arkham Intelligence showed that the Ethereum [ETH] Foundation sold 1,700 ETH, and exchanged it for 2.7 USD Coin [USDC] on 9 October.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ETHs worth today?\n\nAccording to the foundation\u2019s wallet 0x9eE457023bB3De16D51A003a247BaEaD7fce313, the sell-off took place on the Uniswap [UNI] exchange.\n\nHowever, the foundation did not abruptly sell the altcoins without a prior plan. According to Arkham, the non-profit organization sent the coins from its Gnosis Safe Proxy wallet five days ago.\n\nFew ETH left in the wallet\n\nCommonly used by Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), a Gnosis Safe is a smart contract multi-sig wallet running on Ethereum that requires a minimum number of people to approve a transaction.\n\nAfter the sale, Ethereum returned 494,000 USDC to the foundation\u2019s wallet before resending it to the Gnosis Safe. Also, the assets left on the Ethereum Foundation wallet include 240.67 ETH, 49,658 DAI, 10,125 ARB, and 7,096 USDC.\n\nHowever, a look at the foundation\u2019s X (formerly Twitter) page showed that it was unclear why the coins were sold.\n\nETH immediately felt the impact of the sale as the price dropped by 1.45 % within 2 hours that the action took place. As a result, the coin price fell below the $1,600 threshold, which it had held for a while. But how about traders?\n\nAccording to Coinglass, ETH\u2019s 4-hour Long/Short Ratio was 0.87. Typically, values over 1 of this indicator suggest more long positions than shorts. Conversely, a Long/Short Ratio of less than 1 means that there are more short positions than long.\n\nWatch out for more downside\n\nTherefore, ETH\u2019s aforementioned Long/Short Ratio means traders share the sentiment that the price may decrease further.\n\nHowever, the price of ETH may not go below $1,500 in the short term. This is because the Supply on Exchanges stayed put around the same point it has since last week.\n\nSupply on Exchanges is a measure of the number of coins sent into exchange wallets from external addresses. If the metric spikes, then it means there could be an impending selling pressure.\n\nTherefore, the flatlined status means there was enough strength from ETH to withstand the foundation\u2019s sale.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nMeanwhile, traders who opt to go long may need to watch out for the rising Open Interest on exchanges. As an indicator of market sentiment, the Open Interest on exchanges can tell when there is an increase in exchange activity.\n\nHowever, the increase in this metric could be connected to spot or derivatives trading. While it may be uncertain which actions are being taken on these platforms, it is also necessary to be wary of opening long positions."

        "content": "On-chain data shows Ethereum whales have sold around 12 million in the cryptocurrency within the past year and have shown no signs of slowing down.\n\nEthereum Whale Holdings Have Been In Constant Downtrend Since 2020\n\nIn a new post on X, analyst James V. Straten has discussed how the Bitcoin and Ethereum whales have shown some stark contrast in their behavior.\n\nHere is the chart that the analyst has shared, which compares the trends in the holdings of these humongous holders for the two assets over their entire history:\n\nHow the holdings of the whales differ between the two cryptocurrencies | Source: @jimmyvs24 on X\n\nFor defining what a \u201cwhale\u201d is, the analyst has chosen the 1,000 tokens cutoff for both assets. The graph shows that the holdings of the Bitcoin whales have been in an overall uptrend throughout the asset\u2019s history.\n\nSome deviations have been from this upward trajectory, like during the 2021 bull run, where these investors participated in some profit-taking. However, such deviations have only been temporary as the whales have eventually resumed their accumulation.\n\nHowever, a deviation that is yet to be reversed fully is the drawdown observed around the FTX collapse in November 2022. Nonetheless, the whales have participated in some accumulation since the start of the year; more is needed to retrace the aforementioned plunge.\n\nThe Bitcoin whales have seen their holdings move sideways in the past couple of years. The Ethereum whales, on the other hand, have participated in a steep selloff during the same period.\n\nSince 2020, these holders have shed 20 million ETH from their combined holdings, worth about $31.6 billion at the current exchange rate. In the past year alone, they have sold about 12 million ETH ($18.9 billion), an astonishing figure.\n\nAs highlighted in the graph, the Ethereum whales showed a temporary deviation phase when they bought at the bear market lows. Nevertheless, this accumulation was quickly reversed as the indicator resumed a sharp plunge soon after.\n\nSomething worth noting here is that the size of the whales isn\u2019t the same between the two assets. Due to the difference in the prices of the coins, 1,000 tokens of each have vastly different weightages. Based on this cutoff, Bitcoin whales would hold at least $27.4 million worth of the asset, while the ETH whales hold just $1.58 million.\n\nA more fair comparison may be made by looking at the holdings of the ETH entities of comparable size to the BTC whales. As displayed in the chart below, the Ethereum whales with between 10,000 to 100,000 ETH ($15.8 million to $158 million) have shown accumulation over the years. Still, this cohort has also sold massive amounts this year.\n\nLooks like the value of the metric has sharply declined recently | Source: @jimmyvs24 on X\n\nHowever, the mega whales on the network ($158 million+) have shown behavior more in line with the aggregate 1,000+ ETH group, as they have distributed heavily since 2020.\n\nThese whales have been selling for a few years now | Source: @jimmyvs24 on X\n\nEthereum\u2019s situation looks bleak, at least in terms of the holdings of the whales. The fact that these humongous holders have shown no signs of a turnaround so far may be the most concerning, as they lack interest in accumulating the asset. This differs greatly from the sentiment around the Bitcoin whales, who have been participating in net buying this year.\n\nETH Price\n\nEthereum has registered some decline recently, as the coin\u2019s price is now retesting the same lows as back in August.\n\nETH has been moving sideways over the past couple of months | Source: ETHUSD on TradingView\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.com, charts from TradingView.com, Glassnode.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Recent upgrades to Ethereum, specifically the Merge and Shanghai, have reportedly led to an increased centralization of the network. This rise in centralization is primarily attributed to the surge in ether (ETH) staking, which, while beneficial in some ways, has its drawbacks.\n\nIs Staking GOOD?\n\nStaking, especially in Ethereum, has grown in popularity. However, this has inadvertently caused the overall yield from staking to decrease. For instance, where staking yield once stood at a robust 7.3%, post the Shanghai upgrade, it has diminished to around 5.5%.\n\nMoreover, the allure of decentralized staking platforms had gained traction in the crypto community as they were viewed as preferable to their centralized counterparts. These decentralized platforms have been making efforts to increase their node operators. This strategy aims to ensure that no single operator controls a disproportionate amount of staked ether, addressing some centralization concerns.\n\nThe Risks of Centralization\n\nIt\u2019s essential to understand that any form of centralization, regardless of the entity or protocol, introduces potential risks. If too few liquidity providers or node operators control the majority of the network, it can lead to vulnerabilities. Such concentration could result in a single failure point, or in a worst-case scenario, create opportunities for malicious attacks. There\u2019s also the fear that these dominating entities might prioritize their interests over the community\u2019s welfare.\n\nRehypothecation: A Rising Concern\n\nAnother pressing concern is rehypothecation. This involves liquidity tokens being used simultaneously as collateral across multiple decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. DeFi encompasses a range of financial activities executed on a blockchain, such as trading and lending. The problem with rehypothecation is that it could trigger a series of liquidations if the staked asset suddenly drops in value or faces security breaches.\n\nStaking Yield\u2019s Diminished Appeal\n\nWith traditional financial assets witnessing increasing yields, Ethereum\u2019s declining staking yield makes it less attractive. The drop from 7.3% to 5.5% post the upgrades underscores this shift.\n\n\u2014> BUY CRYPTOS WITH BITPANDA <\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\nYou might also like\n\nMore from Altcoin"

If you encounter any issues, kindly report them to [email protected]. Crypto assets/products can be highly risky. Never invest unless you\u2019re prepared to lose all the money you invest.\n\nEthereum BSC announces the beginning of its presale, a significant milestone on its journey to becoming a prominent cryptocurrency project.\n\nAfter weeks of eager anticipation and discussions among investors about the project\u2019s potential, the presale is now open for participation on the official website.\n\nIn a short time since the presale launch, Ethereum BSC has already secured over $31,000 in funding, reflecting the crypto community\u2019s high level of interest and confidence.\n\nThis presale marks an essential step in Ethereum BSC\u2019s broader fundraising strategy, aiming to raise approximately $2.1 million to support the platform\u2019s growth and development.\n\nEthereum BSC Initiates Its Presale Phase Amidst High Investor Enthusiasm\n\nEthereum BSC, a new cryptocurrency project aimed at providing opportunities for those who may have missed out on Ethereum\u2019s initial offerings, has officially announced the commencement of its $ETHBSC token presale, offering an attractive presale price of just $0.035 per token, a similar cost last seen in Ethereum\u2019s early days of 2014.\n\nThe presale is already in progress and will conclude upon reaching its fundraising goal of approximately $2.1 million, intended to fuel the platform\u2019s expansion and development.\n\nNotably, this presale has garnered significant attention from investors, amplified by recent discussions within niche channels regarding the project\u2019s potential, including the unique features of this BEP-20 token \u2013 Ethereum BSC.\n\nWhat truly sets Ethereum BSC apart is its robust staking mechanism, differentiating itself from energy-intensive traditional mining methods. Ethereum BSC employs a stake-to-earn model, allowing token holders to stake their ETHBSC holdings and, in return, earn rewards over time. This innovative and environmentally conscious approach aligns with the evolving digital currency landscape.\n\nWith a capped total supply of 120 million tokens, Ethereum BSC ensures scarcity, enhancing the potential for value appreciation. Each token carries significant weight, and as demand surges, the opportunity for price appreciation grows.\n\nThis announcement marks an optimistic beginning for Ethereum BSC, inviting novice and experienced investors to participate and contribute to the project\u2019s thriving journey.\n\n$ETHBSC\u2019s Hassle-Free Process to Buy the Token\n\nIf you\u2019re eager to get your hands on ETHBSC tokens, whether you\u2019re a novice or an experienced investor, you can choose one of these three methods to buy ETHBSC:\n\nPaying with BNB (Binance Coin)\n\nThe swiftest way to obtain ETHBSC tokens is through BNB. So, ensure you hold some BNB in your MetaMask or Trust Wallet in order to buy ETHBSC. The process involves a simple token swap. Also, remember to reserve a small amount of BNB in your wallet to cover the minimal gas fee.\n\nPaying with ETH (Ethereum)\n\nAlternatively, you can purchase ETHBSC tokens using ETH on the Ethereum chain. Connect your wallet to the Ethereum network to facilitate the payment. Make sure you have sufficient ETH in your wallet to cover the gas fee, as the claiming process occurs on the BNB Smart Chain.\n\nUsing USDT (Tether)\n\nFor added convenience, you can buy ETHBSC tokens using USDT, either on the Ethereum or BSC chains. Connect your wallet to the respective chain and choose USDT as your payment option. It\u2019s important to have ETH or BNB readily available to cover the associated gas fee.\n\nAbout Ethereum BSC\n\nEthereum BSC serves as a bridge between Ethereum and the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), offering a green BEP-20 version of Ethereum. It encapsulates the spirit of Ethereum\u2019s early stages, providing users with a distinctive staking mechanism.\n\nBy staking $ETHBSC tokens, rewards can be periodically earned using the BSC\u2019s efficient and environmentally friendly infrastructure.\n\nTheir goal with Ethereum BSC is to create an opportunity for individuals who may have missed Ethereum\u2019s initial offerings or find Ethereum mining too complex.\n\nAccess to the world of cryptocurrencies is democratized through a presale for $ETHBSC tokens and a simplified \u201cmining\u201d process introduced via staking.\n\nRegarding their launch plans, the project\u2019s team intends to roll out Ethereum BSC on a decentralized exchange within a few weeks after the presale begins. The exact timing of this launch will depend on how swiftly the presale concludes.\n\nStay Tuned\n\nIf you want to learn more about Ethereum BSC, its evolution, presale status, and various updates about the project, you can follow its activity on the official Ethereum BSC website, as well as on platforms such as Telegram and Twitter."

        "content": "Share this article URL Copied\n\nOver the past 30 days alone, Ethereum\u2019s token supply has increased by nearly 30,000 ETH, equivalent to over $47 million at current prices, according to data from ultrasound.money. This increase in ETH token supply is partly driven by lower network usage and fees stemming from the adoption of layer 2 (L2) scaling solutions.\n\nAccording to data from L2 analytics L2Beats, scaling solutions have gained significant user adoption and Total Value Locked (TVL). Currently, the TVL of L2 networks amounts to roughly $10.5 billion, more than double that of a year ago.\n\nIn comparison, Ethereum\u2019s TVL dropped more than 30% over the past year from nearly $30 billion to more than $20 billion, according to DefiLlama data.\n\nEther\u2019s deflationary narrative first emerged after the activation of EIP-1559 in August 2021, which introduced a fee-burning mechanism that burns a portion of ETH paid in fees by users. This acted as a deflationary force on ETH\u2019s circulating supply.\n\nEIP-1559, combined with The Merge\u2019s transition to proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus cut issuance by nearly 90%, significantly reducing Ethereum\u2019s inflation rate. Before The Merge, miners received approximately 13,000 ETH per day as block rewards. Since transitioning to PoS, only around 1,700 ETH is issued per day.\n\nDuring periods of high network usage and congestion, the amount of ETH burned in fees exceeds the new ETH created, slowing supply growth and benefiting prices. However, lower activity means fewer burns, increasing supply and potential inflation.\n\nThe increased supply in the past month can\u2019t be attributed only to low usage though, as Ethereum\u2019s daily active addresses and on-chain transaction volume have held relatively steady this year. The weekly average of daily transactions has increased nearly 7% since the start of the year, while the weekly average on-chain volume has jumped nearly 80% from more than $1 billion to roughly $1.9 billion over the same period, according to data from IntoTheBlock.\n\n."

        "title": "The Latest Comparison Between Ethereum and Solana - Altcoin Buzz",
        "content": "Solana was or is still known as an Ethereum killer. But how realistic is this? There are strong believers in Solana that think it will get up to the same levels as Ethereum.\n\nHowever, many others don\u2019t. Where is the truth? So, it\u2019s time to look a bit deeper into this Solana vs Ethereum saga. Let\u2019s compare some platforms on market cap and TVL.\n\nThe Ecosystems\n\nSo, first things first, we\u2019re looking at the bigger picture. In other words, we compare their respective ecosystems.\n\nWill Solana ever reach Ethereum's current levels? Some people believe in that, while others don't. In this thread, I'll be featuring interesting projects on Solana, comparing them with Ethereum in terms of Mcap and TVL. In the end, I'll be sharing some personal thoughts! \ud83e\uddf5\ud83e\udee1 pic.twitter.com/C5jsmqIplW \u2014 DefiFerr (@dontbuytops) October 3, 2023\n\nWe include their respective market cap, TVL, and number of daily active addresses:\n\nEthereum:\n\nIts TVL is 20,206 billion.\n\nMarketcap = 202,74 billion.\n\nDaily Active Addresses = 315k.\n\nSolana:\n\nTVL = 333,7M. (64x from Ethereum)\n\nMarketcap = 9,57B. (~21x from Ethereum)\n\nDaily Active Addresses = 241k. (~1,3x from Ethereum)\n\nIt should come as no surprise that Ethereum has a clear lead here. Ethereum ranks as #1 of all chains. In contrast to Solana, that comes in at a respectable 9th spot. The picture below shows the current TVL for both chains.\n\nSource: Artemis\n\nDEXes\n\nFor DEXes, we look at the most popular ones. On Ethereum, that is Uniswap. On Solana, we look at the two current top-performing DEXes, Orca and Raydium. Here are the TVL and market cap of these dApps at the time of writing this article:\n\nEthereum (Uniswap (Uniswap $UNI ): TVL = 3.071 billion. Marketcap = 3.132 billion. Solana (Raydium $RAY): TVL = 30.53 million. Marketcap = 38.57 million. Solana (Orca (Orca $ORCA ): TVL = 44.62 million. Marketcap = 19.38 million.\n\n\n\nEthereum will have the upper hand in all comparisons we make. Both Solana DEXes don\u2019t come anywhere near the Ethereum TVL or market cap. I will comment on all the data at a later stage. The picture below shows the TVL for Uniswap between December 2022 and October 9th, 2023.\n\nSource: DeFiLlama\n\nLending Protocols\n\nWith lending protocols, we do the same. We look at the biggest lending protocol on Ethereum, which is Aave. On Solana, the two top lending platforms are Solend and MarginFi.\n\nEthereum (Aave (Aave $AAVE TVL = 4,72 billion. Marketcap = 935.51 million.\n\n\n\nSolana (Solend $SLND) TVL = 50 million. Marketcap = 43.89 million.\n\n\n\nSolana ($MarginFi) TVL = 22.64 million. No token yet.\n\n\n\nOnce again, we see that both the Solana TVLs and market caps don\u2019t come close to Ethereum. The picture below shows Aave on DeFiLlama.\n\nSource: DeFiLlama\n\nDerivatives\n\nFor derivatives, we add an extra metric, the derivative volume. For Ethereum, we look at dYdX. However, their move to the Cosmos Hub is imminent. On Solana, we look at Drift. They\u2019re the top platforms on their respective chains.\n\nEthereum ($DYDX):\n\nTVL = 343.66 million\n\nMonthly Derivatives Volume (September) = 858.43 million\n\nMarketcap = 348.33 million\n\nSolana (Drift)\n\nTVL = 18.59 million\n\nMonthly Derivatives Volume (September) = 8.97 million\n\nNo token yet.\n\nDrift drifts quite a long way from dYdX. Below you can see the DeFiLlama chart for dYdX.\n\nSource: DeFiLlama\n\nLiquid Staking\n\nLiquid staking platforms take the current top positions for TVL. On Ethereum, Lido is miles away from its nearest competitor. On Solana, Marinate Finance is the undisputed leader, followed by Jito. However, Lido is on Jito\u2019s heals here.\n\nEthereum (Lido $LDO)\n\nTVL = 14.116 billion\n\nMarketcap = 1.361 billion\n\nSolana (Marinade Finance $MNDE)\n\nTVL = 124.94 million.\n\nMarketcap = 8.42 million.\n\nSolana (Jito)\n\nTVL = 54.99 million.\n\nNo token yet\n\nJito is seeing some great monthly changes on TVL. Well over 80%. But, as already pointed out, Lido is closing in on Jito. However, the picture below shows the Marinade Finance TVL chart on DeFiLlama.\n\nSource: DeFiLlama\n\nMemecoins\n\nMemecoins are not our favorite coins at Altcoin Buzz. However, recently, they have been making waves. So, let\u2019s take a look at some memecoins and their market cap on both chains.\n\nEthereum ($PEPE)\n\nMarketcap = 279.5 million.\n\nSolana ($BONK)\n\nMarketcap = 8.258 million.\n\nSolana ($GUAC)\n\nMarketcap = 1.86 million.\n\nOnce more, it\u2019s Ethereum that is miles ahead of the Solana tokens.\n\nYield Aggregator\n\nFor yield aggregators, we look at Yearn on Ethereum. On Solana, we eye Hawksight and Meteroa.\n\nEthereum (Yearn Finance $YFI)\n\nTVL = 316.61 million.\n\nMarketcap = 173.25 million.\n\nSolana (Hawksight $HAWK)\n\nTVL = 2.03 million.\n\nMarketcap = 0.04 million.\n\nSolana (Meteroa)\n\nTVL = 9.37 million.\n\nNo token yet.\n\nThere are no surprises here, Hawksight and Meteroa have, once more, nothing on Yearn. The picture below shows the Yearn TVL on DeFiLlama.\n\nSource: DeFiLlama\n\nConclusion\n\nIt should come as no surprise that Ethereum is ahead in all metrics we looked at. However, Ethereum has a clear first-mover advantage. So, this pays out in its history and the general adaption that the chain has. On the other hand, Solana has some great features that Ethereum still lacks. For instance, scalability, and fast and cheap transactions. However, Solana is a younger chain and is still building.\n\nCatching up on Ethereum is a big task. But in crypto, you never know how things can turn around.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe information discussed by Altcoin Buzz is not financial advice.

        "title": "Ethereum Whales Buying At Every ETH Price Dip, What's Next? - CoinGape",
        "content": "The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency Ethereum has come under strong selling pressure with ETH price facing strong rejection at $1,750 levels. At press time, ETH is trading 1.73% down at a price of $1,560 and a market cap of $187 billion.\n\nEthereum Whales Show Strength\n\nAs per the on-chain data, Ethereum whales have continued to show major strength despite the strong selling pressure. The 10 largest whale addresses have accumulated a staggering 40 million ETH recently.\n\nadvertisement\n\nOn-chain data provider Santiment reported that the wealthiest Ethereum addresses, both on and off exchanges, continue to accumulate more wealth while Ethereum\u2019s market value remains slightly above $1,570. At present, approximately 8.51% of all Ethereum ($ETH) is held on exchange platforms, while the top 10 non-exchange addresses collectively possess an impressive 39.22 million $ETH.\n\nHowever, amid the current selling pressure, Ethereum has been losing ground to Bitcoin. The percentage of total market capitalization held by Ether in the $1 trillion crypto market decreased from approximately 18.4% at the beginning of the year to 17.8%. While the ETH market continues to drop further, the BTC market share has soared past 50%.\n\nOn the other hand, On Monday, the Ethereum Foundation converted approximately $2.7 million worth of Ether into the stablecoin USDC through a sale. This has further induced some selling pressure on the world\u2019s second-largest crypto. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez noted that there could be a major sell-off below $1,530 levels.\n\n#Ethereum is hovering above a critical demand zone. Keep a close watch, as a daily close below $1,530 could signal a steep correction ahead for $ETH. pic.twitter.com/5qLuXTXOtr \u2014 Ali (@ali_charts) October 10, 2023\n\nEthereum (ETH) Price Analysis\n\nAs of press time, the ETH price is trading just above the crucial support level of $1,550. However, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the Awesome Oscillator (AO) indicators have both crossed below their respective mean levels of 50 and 0. This indicates a notable increase in bearish momentum.\n\nLooking ahead, investors should anticipate the Ethereum price to potentially retest the next support level at $1,309.\n\nRegardless of the bearish signs, if external factors like news or macro events produce a strong bullish spike, it could shift the winds quickly. In such a case, if the Ethereum price flips the $1,727 hurdle into a support floor, it will invalidate the bearish outlook. This move could further propel ETH to retest the $2,030 hurdle.\n\nThe past week served as a crucial gauge for Ethereum investors as the United States saw the introduction of six futures-based ETFs. However, these new ETFs managed to gather only slightly below $10 million in their initial week, indicating a lukewarm response from investors."

        "title": "Ethereum Foundation Falls Victim to MEV Bot Attack - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "Ethereum, the second-largest blockchain network, suffered a substantial setback through a sandwich attack, losing over $9K.\n\nThis data underscores an increasing problem of sandwich attacks in the crypto sphere, with over $1.3 million lost through such schemes in the past 30 days on the Ethereum chain.\n\nThe Sandwich Attack\n\nAccording to Eigenphi\u2019s data, on Oct. 9, the Ethereum network experienced a significant sandwich attack by the MEV bot (0x00\u20266B40), resulting in a profit of approximately $4,060 after factoring in costs.\n\nMEV bots are well-known for extracting miner-extractable value in blockchain transactions.\n\nVarious blockchain analysts, including EigenPhi, promptly identified this recent incident. Network data reveals that this sudden attack followed an Ethereum foundation attempt to sell 1.7K Ethereum tokens through Uniswap V3. The foundation aimed to exchange these tokens for 2.738 million USDC via Uniswap.\n\nData charts illustrate a series of transactions involving multiple tokens such as WETH, USDC, ETH, aUSDC, aWETH, and variable WETH, enabling the attacker to ultimately secure profits. The MEV bot generated approximately 5.616 ETH in revenue during these transactions, accumulating 3.111 ETH after deducting costs after the incident.\n\nAt the time of the attack, Ethereum was trading in the $1,600-$1,618 range. This implies that the MEV bot obtained revenue of approximately $9,101, with actual profits amounting to $4,060. Consequently, the attack resulted in a $9,101 loss for the Ethereum Foundation.\n\nDespite this significant setback, the foundation\u2019s address retains substantial assets, including 240.68 ETH, 3.238 million USDC, 49,700 DAI, and 10,000 ARB, totaling $3.687 million.\n\nThe Sandwich Problem in Blockchain\n\nA closer examination of Eigenphi\u2019s analysis suggests that there has been significant activity from sandwich attackers recently. Within 24 hours prior to the reports, 85 sandwich attackers managed to generate profits totaling $22.9K.\n\nOver the past seven days, approximately 20.4K victims have been reported, with 123 attackers accumulating profits of $239.4K. In the last 30 days alone, attackers have profited a minimum of $1.38 million through sandwich attacks.\n\nAlthough the Ethereum chain remains the primary target, BSC chains closely follow suit, with attackers earning $497.4K in the past 30 days.\n\nThese recent incidents serve as a clear reminder of the significant risks associated with the blockchain ecosystem, which can impact anyone."

        "content": "The cryptocurrency industry and community are abuzz with the latest Bitcoin update: BitVM. This computing paradigm, designed to express Turing-complete Bitcoin contracts, has the potential to revolutionize the Bitcoin network. What is even more intriguing is that this does not require any changes to the network's consensus rules. Instead of executing computations on Bitcoin, they are merely verified, drawing parallels with optimistic rollups.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis mechanism allows any computable function to be verified on Bitcoin, paving the way for smart contracts on the Bitcoin network. But what does this mean for Ethereum and Cardano, two giants in the smart contract space?\n\nSource: BitVM Whitepaper\n\nEthereum, once the undisputed leader in the DeFi and NFT sectors, has been experiencing a downturn. The once-thriving DeFi and NFT landscapes have lost their sheen, with users becoming wary due to recurring scams and a perceived lack of innovation since the 2021 bull run. Cardano, on the other hand, has been positioning itself as a more efficient and scalable alternative to Ethereum, but it too faces challenges in gaining widespread adoption.\n\nWith Bitcoin's BitVM, the game could change dramatically. The ability to perform complex off-chain computation without leaving any trace on the chain, unless there is a dispute, is a game-changer. It offers a level of privacy and efficiency that could make Bitcoin a formidable competitor in the smart contract arena.\n\nIf Bitcoin can successfully implement and popularize this feature, it could potentially draw developers and users away from Ethereum and Cardano. The trust and security associated with Bitcoin, combined with the new capabilities of BitVM, could make it an attractive platform for developers looking to build decentralized applications.\n\nMoreover, the fact that Bitcoin is Turing-complete, allowing it to verify the execution of any program, further solidifies its position. While the current model is limited to a two-party setting, future generalizations could expand its capabilities."

        "title": "Ethereum Open Interest Rising: Is This A Signal Bulls Have Been Waiting For? - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Ethereum prices might be stagnant at spot rates, weaving around the $1,540 and $1,560 zone, looking at technical charts. However, amid this period of consolidation and holders worrying about Ethereum\u2019s prospects, Kaiko notes that the coin\u2019s open interest has been gradually rising since September 2023.\n\nEthereum Open Interest Rising: What Does It Mean?\n\nAs of October 10, Kaiko observes that there are more than 2.2 million contracts, and the number has been rising steadily over the past few trading weeks. With increasing open interest, it can hint that bulls are in the equation, which may support prices now that prices are under immense pressure.\n\nIn crypto trading, open interest is the total number of outstanding derivative contracts of a given coin. Meanwhile, derivatives are contracts that derive value from the underlying asset, in this case, Ethereum. Herein, the total open interest data is accrued from ETH options, futures, and perpetual futures from platforms where traders can use leverage.\n\nThere can be different interpretations of open interest depending on the market state. Since open interest includes long and short positions at any time, gauging the directions of how market participants are posting trades can be challenging.\n\nEven so, rising open interest indicates that more traders are opening positions, which can be seen as bullish, especially if prices are expanding. Conversely, falling open interest suggests that traders are exiting, which means waning momentum and bearish sentiment.\n\nETH Consolidates Even After Ethereum Futures ETF Approval\n\nBased on this, Ethereum remains in a critical position and support. Notably, the coin is moving sideways with low trading volumes.\n\nFrom the daily chart, ETH is around the $1,500 and $1,550 primary support. Though buyers appear to be in control, since prices are boxed inside the June to July 2023 trade range, any break below the support zone may trigger more losses.\n\nThe general optimism explaining rising open interest could be due to the recent approval of Ethereum Futures exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved multiple Ethereum Futures ETFs for the first time.\n\nThis decision saw Ethereum prices edge higher in early October. Though prices have since contracted, institutional investors can now find exposure in Ethereum via structured and regulated products approved by the stringent regulator.\n\nIt is unclear whether the rising ETH open interest signals strength and if the coin will recover going forward. From the daily chart, ETH has strong liquidation at around the $1,750 level and remains consolidated.\n\nFeature image from Canva, chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

This turbulence resulted from a wallet seemingly linked to the Ethereum Foundation choosing to sell a portion of its allocated tokens, causing widespread panic.\n\nConsequently, Ethereum price slipped by approximately just over 2% within a few hours. This sudden decline came as a surprise to many, leaving traders scrambling to react. Monday was a particularly brutal day for cryptocurrency traders, as the market witnessed a dramatic sell-off. As a result, over $100 million worth of liquidations occurred, primarily affecting long positions\u2014those who had bet on price increases.\n\nadvertisement\n\nNotably, the chaos also unfolded against the backdrop of escalating tensions in the Middle East, where Israel\u2019s conflict with Hamas and increasing regional turmoil rattled investors, impacting risk assets across the board.\n\nEther\u2019s Imminent Danger\n\nHowever, even as Ethereum seemingly stabilized on Tuesday, concerns continued to loom. Prominent crypto analyst Ali Martinez issued a warning via Twitter, cautioning that Ethereum was precariously perched above a critical demand zone.\n\nHe emphasized the importance of monitoring the situation closely, highlighting that 1.59 million address bought $1.92 million ETH worth $2.9 billion along this area in the past.\n\nEarlier on Monday, Martinez pointed out that since February 2023, Ethereum whales had been capitalizing on surging prices, offloading or redistributing over 5 million ETH, which translates to approximately $8.5 billion. According to the pundit, what is particularly striking is that this trend of selling has persisted, with no current indications of a shift towards Ethereum accumulation.\n\nThat said, it\u2019s important to note that Ethereum has found itself under a shadow of negativity in recent times. From Vitalik Buterin\u2019s sale of his coins to the growing concerns within the cryptocurrency community regarding Ethereum\u2019s apparent centralization within its staking pools, these factors that have been exerting significant downward pressure on its price.\n\nAt press time, Ether was trading at $1,585 after a 0.45% drop over the past 24 hours."

Currently, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Awesome Oscillator (AO) indicators show a slowdown in bullish momentum and the potential for a build-up of bearish momentum.\n\nBut since the momentum indicators have not flipped bearish yet, investors can expect another dead cat bounce to $30,500 before kick-starting a downtrend. This move would collect the buy-stop liquidity resting above the swing highs formed between August 8 and July 20.\n\nPost liquidity run, BTC could trigger a sell-off that retests the $24,808 support level, a breakdown of which could send it down to the $21,351 foothold.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the other hand, if Bitcoin price flips the $30,000 psychological level into a support floor, it will invalidate the bearish thesis and attract sidelined buyers.

In such a case, XRP could fall back on the $0.469 and $0.420 support levels.\n\nWith no drivers like the Ripple lawsuit to push Ripple price higher, XRP is likely to keep sliding lower. In some situations, the altcoin could eye a sweep of the sell-side liquidity resting below swing lows formed between March 22 and May 11 at $0.411 and $0.406, respectively.\n\nThe RSI has breached below the mean level of 50, and AO is close to breaching the zero level, further adding proof to Ripple\u2019s bearish outlook.\n\nRead More: Ripple developers announce completion of AMM testing, hint at automated trading coming soon to XRPL\n\nXRP/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the other hand, if Ripple price flips the $0.540 hurdle into a support level, it will create a higher high and invalidate the bearish thesis. In such a case, XRP price could be suspended for the foreseeable future between the $0.540 and $0.668 levels."

        "title": "Ethereum Analysis: ETH Drops Below $1,600 for the First This Month. How low Will it go? - Coinfomania",
        "content": "Ethereum is one of the top losers in the top 10 during the previous intraday session. It opened trading at $1,633 but retested the $1,600 support and flipped it. Afterwards, it dropped to a low of $1,548. Although it saw a slight recovery, it ended the session at $1,580 which signifies a more than 3% loss.\n\nWith the current session in view, the apex altcoin is yet to register any significant increases. After its failed attempt at the highlighted barrier, it retraced to a low $1,551. Following a high of $1,595, this marks the second day of ETH failing to reclaim the lost level.\n\nThe massive drop was in response to the news that a wallet belonging to the Ethereum Foundation sold some of its assets. The non-profit organization\u2019s actions spread panic across the crypto market with crippling effects on other cryptocurrencies.\n\nFollowing the dip a few days into October, much speculations are out about how the altcoin may perform.\n\nThe previous month was the first green after two months of significant downtrend. It kicked off trading at $1,645 but made an attempt at the $1,700 resistance but failed as it faced strong corrections at $1,693. Afterward, it retraced to a low of $1,531 before a rebound. In the end, the asset closed September at $1,671 which signifies a less than 2% increase. Will ETH surge higher this month?\n\nRecords Show Ethereum May Gain 6%\n\nThe ninth month of the year is one of the most bearish for the asset as on average, it loses more than 15%. However, it defied the odds during the previous month as it registered small gains. It gained almost 2% and peaked close to $1,700.\n\nHistorically, October is a positive month for the asset. On average, ETH gains more than 6%. A closer look at the trend reveals that there is no clear pattern of the losses. Nonetheless, the biggest loss the coin incurred in the tenth month was in 2016 when it dropped by more than 17%.\n\nOn the other hand, Ether gained 43% in 2021; the highest during the session under consideration. Going by the average, many may expect a more than 6% surge this month. This may send price above $1,700.\n\nKey Levels to Watch\n\nVital Resistance: $1,700, $1,900, $2,030\n\nVital Support: $1,520, $1,400, $1,150\n\nA closer look at the chart suggests several key levels to watch over the next few days. With respect to resistance, the coin may retest the $1,700 barrier in the coming days it may experience a surge in buying volume. The main catalyst for this may be a fundamental across the crypto market. Nonetheless, the said markis one of the toughest as previous attempts at it failed. As a result, it may serve a key support once it flips.\n\nAlthough far-fetched, the $1,900 is another important level to watch. Based on previous price movements, once the previously highlighted mark breaks, it is next in line. Will it get a test? An attempt at this may guarantee a retest of the $2k resistance.\n\nOn the other hand, ETH may experience reversals in prices that may send prices to retesting supports. One of the first lines of defense is the $1,520 barrier. Over the last three months, the trend for the apex altcoin is a deeper low than the previous month. However, all the downtrends failed to drop below $1,500 with most stopping at the highlighted mark.\n\nThis time may be different as deeper low may mean a retest of the $1,400.\n\nYour crypto deserves the best security.

        "title": "Analyst Delivers a $950 Billion Ethereum (ETH) Price Prediction - Bankless Times",
        "content": "Ethereum price has crashed hard in the past few weeks as concerns about the crypto industry continued. ETH crashed to a low of $1,562, the lowest level since September 12th this year. It has dropped by more than 26% from the highest level this year.\n\nEthereum price received a key upgrade by analysts at Standard Chartered, who have been quite bullish on the industry recently. A few months ago, the analysts predicted that Bitcoin surged to $150,000.\n\nAnd in a report this week, an analyst in the bank said that ETH could jump from the current $1,562 to $8,000 in 2026. If this happens, the coin\u2019s market cap will jump from the current $157 billion to over $960 billion.\n\nThe analysts cited the growing use case of Ethereum\u2019s network and the upcoming Bitcoin halving as a catalyst. Also, it noted that the growing industries like gaming and tokenization will continue. Writing about this, the analyst noted:\n\n\"Importantly, this should provide \u2018proof of concept\u2019 examples in which real-world industries come on-chain to exploit the benefits of Ethereum over their existing setups. We expect significant developments on these fronts by 2025-26.\"\n\nTokenization has become a leading industry this year. Just on Wednesday, JPMorgan made a big milestone when it conducted a major tokenized transaction between Blackrock and Barclays.\n\nAnother potential catalyst for Ethereum price will be the approval of an Ethereum ETF. VanEck has already applied for this fund. Therefore, if the SEC approves a spot Bitcoin ETF, there is a likelihood that it will accept an Ethereum ETF.\n\nStill, there are risks to Ethereum. For one, the transition from a proof-of-work (PoW) to a proof-of-stake (PoS) could have some regulatory challenges. There are also concerns about the network\u2019s centralization and the fact that Ethereum Foundation has been selling the coins. It sold 1,700 ETH coins this week."

One of the largest projects so far to come out of the disaster is Crypto Aid Israel, a campaign led by Israeli crypto firms to gather crypto donations to help citizens who have been affected or displaced by the ongoing war. Separately, a local media outlet reported that Israeli police have frozen cryptocurrency accounts linked to Hamas, working with the crypto exchange Binance.

Readers should do their own research before taking any actions related to the company. U.Today is not responsible, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with the use of or reliance on any content, goods or services mentioned in the article.\n\nAs technology advances and develops, the cryptocurrency ecosystem is seeing a remarkable shift from old-generation platforms to modernized blockchain networks with improved technology and adaptive consensus mechanisms. Bitcoin Spark is initiating a new beginning that solves the weaknesses and limitations found on the Ethereum and Bitcoin networks. The solutions provide a massive utility that has attracted whales and institutions to its ongoing ICO event.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLimitations of Bitcoin and Ethereum\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum are considered generation blockchains since their respective networks feature older technology that contains glitches and expensive limitations hindering the growth of developers. For instance, Bitcoin's network is highly outdated, and the transaction speeds on the network could be better. The platform also experiences limited scalability due to a lack of smart contracts. The network also charges high transaction costs that sometimes exceed the transacted amount.\n\nOn the other hand, Ethereum luckily underwent a major hard fork upgrade that converted it from a proof of work network to a proof of stake. However, the network still charges high transaction costs and the network's growth. Ethereum's smart contracts are also characterized by loopholes that have led to the vulnerability of decentralized applications to malicious hackers.\n\nBitcoin Spark Overcomes Bitcoin and Ethereum Shortcomings\n\nAlthough Bitcoin Spark is a Bitcoin hard fork, some applications provide alternative solutions to Ethereum's limitations. Bitcoin and Ethereum charge high transaction costs, keeping away participants.\n\nBitcoin Spark will be a gas network, but the transaction costs will be lower than those experienced on the Bitcoin and Ethereum networks. The gas token of the Bitcoin Spark network will be BTCS tokens. All transaction charges will be sent to the mining pools and distributed to miners by the Bitcoin Spark smart contract layer.\n\nBitcoin Spark's mainnet will launch soon, introducing a unique smart contract layer that will diversify the development of the network. The platform's smart contracts will deploy decentralized applications in EVM-compatible languages like Vyper or Solidity.\n\nThe Contract Wolf audited Bitcoin Spark smart contract will have four independent but interjecting layers programmable in low- and high-level languages. The smart contract will also have an underlying parallel layer to deploy contracts in Rust alongside a special feature that settles transactions on the Spark mainnet.\n\nThe four layers include the rewards layer, the mining layer, the consensus layer, and the execution layer. Mining BTCS tokens will take place in the mining layer of the network and allow network participants to donate idle processing power to the platform. Although serving different purposes, the layers will reach a common network finality to power a growing ecosystem supporting numerous utilities.\n\nUnlike Bitcoin and Ethereum, Bitcoin Spark encourages network validators to join the ecosystem. Instead of wasting energy like in proof-of-work blockchains, Bitcoin Spark will trap idle energy during mining due to the network's lightweight nature.\n\nThe lightweight component of the mining process allows the mining activity to take place on devices that run on low power, like Laptops, PCs, mobile phones, and tablets. This also opens up BTCS mining to the general public. To get started, users need an updated smart device that can install the Bitcoin Spark mining application and connect the device to a stable internet connection.\n\nLearn more about Bitcoin Spark on:\n\nWebsite: https://bitcoinspark.org/"

        "title": "Not Ethereum, But Bitcoin Minetrix Is The Hottest New Coin In Crypto \u2013 Here\u2019s Why - NewsBTC",
        "content": "The crypto market has entered a period of uncertainty in recent weeks, with majors like Ethereum struggling to maintain upward momentum.\n\nHowever, while legacy cryptocurrencies battle bearish sentiment, new disruptive projects are emerging to capture investor attention.\n\nOne such rising star is Bitcoin Minetrix, whose innovative cloud mining solution and wildly successful presale have propelled it into the spotlight. As Ethereum wavers below key support levels, all eyes are on whether Bitcoin Minetrix can sustain its epic start and become the next big thing in crypto.\n\nEthereum Price Struggles to Maintain Momentum\n\nEthereum has been facing some struggles this week. The price of ETH is now trading below the crucial and psychological $1600 level amid a broader crypto market downturn.\n\nAccording to top analyst Ali on Twitter, Ethereum whales have been capitalizing on surging prices since February 2023, offloading or redistributing over 5 million ETH \u2013 equivalent to roughly $8.5 billion. This selling trend is apparently continuing, with no indication yet of a shift towards ETH accumulation.\n\nAli notes that Ethereum is hovering above a critical demand zone, advising traders to keep a close watch. A daily close below $1530 could signal a steep correction ahead for ETH.\n\nFrom altFINS\u2019 technical analysis perspective, Ethereum recently saw a bullish breakout from the Falling Wedge pattern. This could suggest buyers have absorbed all the supply from sellers, and the price is ready to resume an uptrend.\n\nEthereum is currently retesting that breakout level around $1600. The upside potential is the $1800 horizontal resistance zone if bulls can maintain control. This area also coincides with the 200-day moving average, making it a stiff resistance point.\n\nThe Falling Wedge pattern usually results in a bullish breakout. When the price breaks above the upper trendline, it often continues trending higher. Traders can play the emerging pattern between the convergence lines before the breakout. However, most traders wait for a complete pattern and confirmed breakout before going long.\n\nThe momentum indicators are currently bearish for Ethereum. The MACD line is below the signal line, and the RSI is below 45. This reflects the recent downturn and loss of upside momentum.\n\nThe nearest significant support zone for Ethereum is $1600, which has already been broken on Monday. Below that lies $1500, which could see buyers emerge to defend this area. On the upside, resistance is seen at $1800 (previous support turned resistance), followed by the psychological $2000 level.\n\nHottest New Cryptocurrency Bitcoin Minetrix Raises Close To $1 Million\n\nWhile Ethereum faces some uncertainty in the short-term, an interesting new project called Bitcoin Minetrix has been gaining substantial momentum.\n\nBitcoin Minetrix\u2019s presale recently hit a major milestone, raising $925,000 within the first few weeks. Hitting $1,000,000 is only a matter of time at this pace.\n\nWith its innovative approach to cloud mining and current low entry point, could Bitcoin Minetrix become the next explosive crypto success story that creates tremendous wealth?\n\n#BitcoinMinetrix has once more crossed a crucial milestone! \ud83d\ude80 We have raised over $900,000. pic.twitter.com/zWvJsUwiBb \u2014 Bitcoinminetrix (@bitcoinminetrix) October 10, 2023\n\nThe possibilities are certainly there for major upside. Bitcoin Minetrix aligns perfectly with the opportunity to enhance the user experience for Bitcoin mining. Its presale also offers investors a chance to buy in at a very low starting price.\n\nThe presale consists of ten rounds, with each round seeing a 10% token price increase. However, those purchasing now at $0.011 per token will be pleased to know this is the base price. It won\u2019t get any cheaper than this stage one cost.\n\nThe main feature of Bitcoin Minetrix is its decentralized cloud mining solution. It tackles the common issues of excessive hardware costs and deceptive scams associated with Bitcoin mining. Users can buy and stake BTCMTX tokens to gain cloud mining credits, ensuring a more secure and transparent mining process.\n\nBitcoin Minetrix\u2019s novel Stake-to-Mine concept throws open the doors of Bitcoin mining to all crypto enthusiasts. Users can now participate in this potentially lucrative activity without grappling with technical complexity or sinking money into prohibitive hardware costs. By leveraging this innovation, the project strives to make BTC mining genuinely accessible and democratic like never before.\n\nHere\u2019s how it works:\n\nUsers need an Ethereum-compatible wallet like MetaMask to purchase and stake BTCMTX tokens. Staking the BTCMTX tokens earns users non-tradable ERC-20 token credits. These credits must be burned in exchange for actual Bitcoin cloud mining power. This innovative Stake-to-Mine concept makes bitcoin mining accessible for regular crypto investors.\n\nCloud mining provides several advantages, including easy entry, cost efficiency, and avoiding the physical annoyances of noise and space from mining rigs. It removes the need for technical skills, hardware setup, and maintenance, making it user-friendly even for beginners.\n\nMarketing Efforts\n\nThe project\u2019s high potential yields have already attracted the attention of major crypto influencers. YouTube analyst Jacob Bury predicts returns of 10x or greater once BTCMTX makes its market debut after the presale. Meanwhile, Zach Humphries and Michael Wrubel have also endorsed Bitcoin Minetrix\u2019s novel cloud mining approach.\n\nBitcoin Minetrix is currently undertaking massive marketing efforts across the crypto space. It\u2019s being featured on all the top crypto media outlets, including CryptoPotato, CaptainAltcoin, NewsBTC, Cryptonewsz, and many more.\n\nWhile Ethereum is facing some temporary uncertainty, Bitcoin Minetrix is just getting started on what could become an explosive journey.\n\nIts innovative cloud mining solution, coupled with a low-cost presale entry point, makes Bitcoin Minetrix a very intriguing crypto investment opportunity worth watching closely in the weeks ahead.\n\nVisit Bitcoinminetrix.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Circle stablecoin issuer has unveiled its latest initiative of minting USD Coin (USDC) directly on the Ethereum layer-2 scaling protocol, Polygon. This development simplifies the process for users and developers, eliminating the need to bridge the stablecoin from Ethereum to another blockchain.\n\nUSDC on Polygon Enables Instant Transactions\n\nWith this new offering, Circle\u2019s Mint and developer APIs now seamlessly support Polygon-based USDC. Consequently, businesses and developers can now craft decentralized applications using USDC on Polygon. Moreover, this integration promises near-instant transactions with minimal fees. Such capabilities are crucial for a range of applications, from payments and remittances to trading, borrowing, and lending.\n\nadvertisement\n\nBefore this announcement, users relied on bridged USDC (USDC.e) from the Ethereum blockchain. However, this token wasn\u2019t issued by Circle. In contrast, the newly introduced offering guarantees redemption at a 1:1 ratio with the United States dollar. Additionally, Circle had previously facilitated deposits and withdrawals for USDC.e on Polygon through Circle Mint and its APIs. However, Circle will end this service on Nov. 10. They caution users that sending USDC.e to Circle Mint accounts after this date might make their assets irretrievable.\n\nPolygon-based USDC Enables Ethereum Transfers\n\nCircle\u2019s integration with Polygon is poised to revolutionize the decentralized finance (DeFi) landscape. By providing native Polygon USDC, Circle is paving the way for affordable global payments and remittances. Additionally, it ensures easier access to prominent DeFi protocols like Aave, Compound, Curve, Uniswap, and QuickSwap.\n\nFurthermore, Circle has plans in the pipeline to introduce a cross-chain transfer protocol on Polygon. This will foster interoperability with other blockchain networks, significantly enabling Polygon-based USDC transfers to and from the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nIn related news, Circle made headlines in September by announcing native stablecoin liquidity access on the NEAR protocol ecosystem. Circle Account and Circle APIs now offer USDC NEAR access, marking a significant step in expanding the stablecoin\u2019s usability and accessibility across various blockchain networks.\n\nRead Also: SBF Trial: Recap of First Week of Broken Trusts as SBF Loyalists Testify"

        "title": "Which Crypto Will Make You Rich? Best Cryptos to Buy Now Including Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), Solana (SOL ... - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "As we stand on the cusp of a new year, the world of cryptocurrencies continues to evolve at a breakneck pace. With each passing day, new tokens emerge, promising innovations and potential wealth for investors. But amidst this vast sea of digital currencies, which ones truly hold the potential to redefine our financial future? In this comprehensive guide, we delve into the most promising cryptocurrencies by the end of 2023, shedding light on their unique value propositions, growth trajectories, and the underlying factors that could make them the stars of the crypto universe.\n\nBest Cryptocurrencies Which will make you rich in 2023\n\nDiving deep into the cryptocurrency realm of 2023, we spotlight the following standout contenders:\n\nEthereum (ETH) ScapesMania Ripple (XRP) Solana (SOL) Cardano (ADA) Litecoin (LTC)\n\nFrom the steadfast presence of Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) to the promising potential of ScapesMania and the robust platforms of Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA), the crypto landscape is a dynamic playfield. Each coin displays something unique, but the buzz around the innovations of ScapesMania expected to grow by 410% upon listing is particularly hard to ignore. Litecoin (LTC), as one of the older cryptocurrencies, continues to hold its ground, showcasing its resilience and adaptability.\n\nSeeing the True Value of ScapesMania\n\nScapesMania has rapidly become a synonym for originality in the relatively new cryptocurrency market. ScapesMania stands out from the crowd of underrated altcoins and well-established crypto titans because of its innovative revenue streams and meteoric rise in its presale.\n\nBacked by an award-winning team, ScapesMania is all about safety, having successfully passed audits by top-tier security labs. With a presence on key exchanges on the horizon, ScapesMania is poised for visibility and liquidity, which are going to fuel its growth.\n\n>>> Find Out More on the Official Site <<<\n\nWhat is a Presale?\n\nThe purpose of a crypto presale is to provide interested parties a chance to learn about and perhaps buy a new coin before it is officially released and listed on online trading platforms. Plus, it\u2019s a great way to acquire tokens at a much lower price than they will be once the project goes live.\n\nThe current ScapesMania presale is gathering steam by the day, giving traders a small window of opportunity to leverage this token while it is still in its initial stages. Joining the presale enables you to save significantly as ScapesMania is expected to surge in value upon listing. Such offers don\u2019t last long \u2013 as the clock is ticking, the opportunity to acquire discounted ScapesMania tokens is slipping away.\n\nIs ScapesMania Going to Be the Hottest Altcoin of 2023 and Beyond?\n\n\n\nSeveral factors point to ScapesMania being the most promising new cryptocurrency of 2023:\n\nInnovative Mechanisms: ScapesMania allows crypto-savvy people to benefit from the multi-billion gaming industry;\n\nInstantaneous Token Access: ScapesMania distinguishes itself from the crowd by letting purchasers take instant possession of and use their tokens after payment.\n\nStraightforward Tokenomics: The project\u2019s tokenomics are cutting-edge and simple to understand since they avoid any ambiguity;\n\nRising Presale Numbers: ScapesMania\u2019s impressive presale statistics indicate that it is gaining significant traction in the crypto world.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Response to US Dollar Risks\n\n\n\nExperts warn of US dollar risks due to the Federal Reserve\u2019s inflationary actions. This could boost cryptocurrency values, especially Ethereum (ETH).\n\nThe Federal Reserve may take strong monetary steps due to a $33 trillion U.S. debt issue, possibly affecting the dollar. Such moves could enhance cryptocurrencies, likening them to assets like gold. Christopher Wood of Jefferies views Bitcoin and gold as inflation shields.\n\nEthereum (ETH) value ranges from $1570 to $1733, with resistance at $1795 and $1957. Support levels at $1469 and $1307 indicate bearish points. Institutions are showing increased interest in cryptocurrencies, notably Ethereum (ETH). BlackRock\u2019s Larry Fink is positive on digital assets.\n\nIn conclusion, Ethereum (ETH) may grow due to US dollar issues, but investors should stay alert.\n\nRipple (XRP) Automated Market Maker Proposal\n\n\n\nRipple (XRP) CTO, David Schwartz, has proposed adding an Automated Market Maker (AMM) feature to the Ripple (XRP) Ledger (XRPL). If the community agrees, this addition could significantly influence Ripple (XRP) price. With community approval, the XRPL could implement this feature in just two weeks, enhancing Ripple (XRP) market position.\n\nCurrently, Ripple (XRP) trading range is between $0.466 and $0.556. With the positive buzz around the AMM feature and the adaptability of XRPL, Ripple (XRP) might challenge resistance levels at $0.597 and possibly aim for $0.687. However, it\u2019s essential to watch the support levels at $0.417 and $0.327, as they are key to Ripple (XRP) price stability. The community\u2019s decision will be pivotal in determining Ripple (XRP) next major price movement.\n\nSolana (SOL) Resilience and Innovation\n\n\n\nSolana (SOL) has shown resilience and innovation despite challenges, influencing its future price. With a 100% uptime this year and a TVL of $30.95 million, it indicates a strong ecosystem. Solana (SOL) efficient NFT minting positions it well against rivals, attracting more users.\n\nThe market should monitor FTX/Alameda\u2019s large Solana (SOL) holdings, as changes could affect prices.\n\nTrading between $18.53 and $22.99, given Solana (SOL) advancements, the price might approach $24.63 or $29.09. Supports at $15.71 and $11.25 are key for bullish trends. Solana (SOL) price seems set for growth, but investors should remain cautious.\n\nCardano (ADA) Development Surge\n\nCardano (ADA) surpassed Polkadot and Kusama in development, as noted by Santiment, hinting at a potential price rise. This development surge often aligns with positive market sentiment.\n\nCurrently, Cardano (ADA) price ranges from $0.241 to $0.264. With its development momentum, it might challenge $0.273 and aim for $0.296. Support levels at $0.227 and $0.204 are crucial for stability.\n\nGiven these factors, Cardano (ADA) price seems set for growth. Investors should closely watch these indicators in the Cardano (ADA) market.\n\nLitecoin (LTC) Market Fluctuations and Potential\n\nLitecoin (LTC) has faced market fluctuations recently. It\u2019s struggling to maintain above the $66.40 mark against the US Dollar after a drop from near $68.40. Yet, its retest of the $63.00 support could fuel a rally.\n\nLitecoin (LTC) price ranges between $59.60 and $70.37. Given its adaptability and recent events, it might approach resistance at $74.78 and target $85.55. Support levels at $53.24 and $42.47 are crucial for its price direction.\n\nA noted contracting triangle with resistance near $65.50 hints at a breakout. If breached, it could lead to a significant rally towards the mentioned resistances.\n\nConsidering market trends and Litecoin (LTC) history, its price may rise. However, investors should remain cautious and informed.\n\nUnderstanding the Crypto Landscape of 2023:\n\nScapesMania has rapidly become a synonym for originality in the relatively new cryptocurrency market. Its innovative revenue streams and rapid ascent in its presale make it stand out. On the other hand, Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), and Litecoin (LTC) each have their own unique value propositions and growth potential. From Ethereum (ETH) positioning amidst potential US dollar challenges to Ripple (XRP) potential integration of the AMM feature, and from Solana (SOL) resilience and innovation to Cardano (ADA) proactive approach in development, each coin offers something different to the market. Litecoin (LTC), being one of the pioneers, showcases its adaptability and potential for a rally.\n\nProceed with Caution:\n\nWhile the crypto world offers numerous opportunities, it\u2019s essential to remember the inherent risks. This article aims to provide insights and not financial advice. Always conduct personal research before investing in any cryptocurrency. The volatile nature of cryptocurrencies means they\u2019re not suitable for everyone. If any of these coins, be it ScapesMania, Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), Solana (SOL), Carnado (ADA), or Litecoin (LTC) resonate with you, ensure you\u2019re well-informed about their market dynamics, potential growth, and any regional restrictions or requirements. A careful review of ScapesMania\u2019s official website and community can offer clarity regarding restrictions and other essential information concerning eligibility requirements.\n\nSite: https://scapesmania.io/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/scapesmania\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Bitcoin: BitVM Introduces Ethereum-Inspired Smart Contracts - Cointribune EN",
        "content": "Tue 10 Oct 2023 \u25aa 4 min of reading \u25aa by Fenelon L.\n\n\u25aa Blockchain\n\nThe advent of BitVM promises to bring a new dimension to the Bitcoin sphere, introducing Ethereum-style smart contracts. This innovation could bridge the gap between the capabilities of the two leading blockchains, while preserving the fundamental characteristics of Bitcoin.\n\nBitVM Introduces Smart Contracts to Bitcoin\n\nDescribed in a white paper published on October 9 by Robin Linus, the ingenious mind behind the ZeroSync project, BitVM has been designed to enable \u2018Turing-complete\u2019 Bitcoin contracts without altering the consensus rules currently in force on the Bitcoin network.\n\nInstead of executing the contract logic directly on the Bitcoin blockchain, BitVM performs this execution off-chain, while carrying out the verification on Bitcoin, an approach that draws its inspiration from Optimism rollups on Ethereum.\n\nBitVM\u2019s architecture relies heavily on a challenge-response and proof-of-fraud model, similar to that employed by Ethereum. In this framework, a \u201cprover\u201d makes assertions which, if false, can be contradicted by a \u201cverifier\u201d through a proof of fraud, thus sanctioning the prover for his inaccuracies.\n\nBitVM extends the possibilities offered by Bitcoin, going far beyond fundamental operations such as signatures and hashlocks. Potential applications, Linus points out, \u201ccover a variety of fields, from gambling to verifying proof of validity of contracts, and even as far as linking BTC with other chains.\u201d\n\nThe next phase would be to fully implement BitVM, coupling it with Tree++, a new programming language aimed at Bitcoin contracts.\n\nCommunity reactions to BitVM\n\nThe launch of BitVM has sparked a variety of reactions within the Bitcoin community. Prominent figures such as Eric Wall and Dylan LeClair have expressed excitement and a favorable impression of the white paper, while other voices, notably that of Adam Back, a key contributor to Bitcoin Core, advocate a more cautious and measured approach.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that, while BitVM has definite potential, it is also subject to limitations, including a notable consumption of computation and off-chain communications. In addition, Linus has explicitly stated that the model is, for the time being, restricted to a bipartite environment with one prover and one verifier.\n\nAmong the reactions from the community, some users also took the time to dispel potential fears linked to the use of BitVM. For example, Sam Parker assured that bitcoins would not be \u2018locked\u2019 into these contracts, and that the use of this technology.\n\n\u201cFinally, it\u2019s opt-in. If you don\u2019t think your coins will stay locked to a Turing-complete contract (quite reasonable), don\u2019t lock them to a Turing-complete smart contract. One of the beauties of the UTXO system is security sandboxing.\u201d\n\nTowards a Multi-Faceted Bitcoin\n\nThe ongoing energy and development around BitVM and related technologies reflects the robustness and vitality of the sector, where innovation is relentless and blockchain technology improvements are always on the rise.\n\nIf BitVM delivers on its promise, it could pave the way for further innovations on the Bitcoin blockchain, increasing its value and relevance in the crypto space. Some optimists even suggest that BitVM could propel Bitcoin into the next bull market.\n\nBitVM is undoubtedly one of the most exciting advances for Bitcoin in recent years. By combining the security and robustness of Bitcoin with the flexibility of Ethereum-style contracts, it has the potential to revolutionize the way we perceive and use Bitcoin.\n\nNevertheless, as with any emerging technology, careful and well-informed adoption is essential.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program!

        "title": "Ethereum Futures ETFs launch to little fanfare as institutional tokenization efforts grow - CityAM - City A.M.",
        "content": "Ethereum Futures ETFs launch to little fanfare as institutional tokenization efforts grow\n\nData from CryptoCompare shows that the price of the flagship cryptocurrency Bitcoin (BTC) moved sideways throughout most of the past week, starting at around $28,000 and dropping to roughly $27,500 after a sell-off over the weekend.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Ether, the second-largest digital asset by market capitalisation, saw a more pronounced decline over the week, starting above the $1,700 mark and now trading below $1,600.\n\nHeadlines in the cryptocurrency space this week were partly focused on the recent launch of Ether Futures exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States. The products had a notably slow first day of trading, with less-than-stellar trading volumes reported across the board.\n\nWith a total of nine Ether futures ETFs launched early in the week, trading volumes were below $2 million on debut. Five of the ETFs only invest in Ether futures, while the other four combine them with Bitcoin futures contracts as well.\n\nOne of the more popular ETFs, EFUT by VanEck, had a trading volume of only $425,000, with an average price of $17 per share and about 25,000 shares traded. In comparison, ProShares\u2019 Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO), had a trading volume of over $1 billion on its debut day back in October 2021, although it launched during a crypto bull market.\n\nNOW TRADING: The VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF, $EFUT.\n\n\n\nThe transformation happens when enough of us are ready. #EnterTheEther. pic.twitter.com/cb2KMG3wfW \u2014 VanEck (@vaneck_us) October 2, 2023\n\nBefore the Ether futures ETFs were launched, VanEck had announced it plans to allocate 10% of the profit generated from its EFUT offering to Ethereum\u2019s core developers for a period of \u201cat least 10 years.\u201d\n\nThe beneficiary of the act will be the Protocol Guild, a group that works on the development, governance, and improvement of the Ethereum protocol. It comprises developers, researchers, and other vital participants collaborating on the network.\n\nThe launch of these ETFs prompted Grayscale Investments, which has been trying to turn its Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into an ETF, is now planning to do the same for its Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE), aiming to turn it into a spot Ethereum ETF.\n\nUBS pilots tokenized money market fund on Ethereum\n\nEthereum also saw UBS Asset Management, a global giant in the fund industry, launch its first \u201clive pilot\u201d of a money market fund tokenized on the Ethereum blockchain. The pilot lets the firm experiment with different fund operations on-chain, such as buying and selling shares.\n\nThe move came during the same week it was revealed during a panel discussion at CCData\u2019s Digital Asset Summit in London by Tyrone Lobban, Head of Blockchain Launch and Onyx Digital Assets at JPMorgan, that an overwhelming 99.9% of the firm\u2019s client conversations are centered on the tokenization of traditional financial assets rather than on cryptocurrencies.\n\nLobban observed that in the past year, nearly all major global bank, broker-dealer, or asset manager has started some kind of blockchain-related activity, either on permissioned or public blockchains. These initiatives are still in the testing phase, but the determination to exploit blockchain\u2019s potential is clear.\n\nOn JPMorgan\u2019s Onyx platform, financial institutions like Goldman Sachs, DBS, and BNP are running nodes and creating tokens for assets. The platform also enables clients to do repurchase agreements, or repos, with tokenized treasuries as collateral.\n\nFTX employees unearthed secret code favouring Alameda before the collapse\n\nAccording to reports some US-based employees of the now collapsed cryptocurrency exchange FTX found a secret feature on the platform\u2019s code allowing it to let its sister company Alameda Research access billions of dollars of customer funds.\n\nThe discovery was made before the firm collapsed in November 2022 amid a bank run. Those who uncovered the secret feature in FTX\u2019s code informed their division head, who spoke to one of the top executives of FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried. But nothing was done to resolve the problem.\n\nIn 2022, the leader of the team that challenged Alameda\u2019s access to customer funds was fired and the secret feature is now crucial evidence in the fraud case against Bankman-Fried, who is facing a criminal trial in a federal court in New York.\n\nThe former FTX boss has rejected any wrongdoing, but prosecutors say he took funds from FTX\u2019s customers partly by using the hidden feature. Court documents showed that inside FTX\u2019s code there was a hidden line that allowed Alameda to have a negative balance of up to $65 billion.\n\nAlameda line of credit from FTX: $65 Billion\n\n\n\nOther traders max line of credit from FTX: $1-10 Million pic.twitter.com/mzniCjmP9h \u2014 Rhett Creighton (@rhett_creighton) October 9, 2023\n\nFTX\u2019s regular users had to follow an automatic liquidation process that made them sell their assets before their balances went below zero.\n\nMeanwhile, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) suffered a major setback in its lawsuit against Ripple, the crypto firm associated with the XRP token, when a federal judge denied its motion for an interlocutory appeal.\n\nFrancisco Memoria is a content creator at CryptoCompare who\u2019s in love with technology and focuses on helping people see the value digital currencies have.

        "title": "Ethereum FUD Explodes As ETH Under $1,600, Time To Buy? - Bitcoinist",
        "content": "Data shows bearish sentiment among the Ethereum investors has shot up as the asset\u2019s price has dipped under the $1,600 level.\n\nEthereum Has Declined Under The $1,600 Mark Recently\n\nAround the start of this month, Ethereum enjoyed some sharp upward momentum as the cryptocurrency reached the $1,750 level. Since that peak, however, the coin has struggled, as its price has now declined again under the $1,600 mark.\n\nYesterday, ETH even retested a brief $1,550, but the asset quickly found a rebound and has so far held above the level, as the chart below shows.\n\nETH has registered a drawdown in the past couple of days | Source: ETHUSD on TradingView\n\nThe bounce has been small, however, meaning that Ethereum could be in danger of making another retest of the $1,550 level in the coming days. Something that may hold hints regarding if more decline is coming could be the investor sentiment.\n\nETH Social Dominance Spike May Suggest Increase In Market FUD\n\nAccording to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, the social dominance of the asset has seen a large increase since the recent volatility occurred.\n\nThe \u201csocial dominance\u201d here refers to an indicator that keeps track of the percentage of discussions on social media related to the top 100 assets in the cryptocurrency sector that involve the topic of Ethereum.\n\nWhen the value of this metric is high, ETH-related discussions make up a significant part of the total discussions related to the sector.\n\nOn the other hand, low values imply that cryptocurrency doesn\u2019t have much mindshare on social media right now, at least when compared to the other top assets in the market. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in Ethereum\u2019s social dominance over the past year:\n\nThe value of the metric seems to have spiked in recent days | Source: Santiment on X\n\nThe above graph shows that Ethereum\u2019s social dominance has sharply increased this month. This increase in interest around the asset on social media first came with the price rally above $1,700, but the indicator\u2019s value remained high even after the decline.\n\nGenerally, a high amount of social media talk after a plunge is a sign of rising FUD in the market, as traders take to these platforms to express their panic about the cryptocurrency\u2019s situation.\n\nHowever, Such a bearish sentiment has often been positive for the asset\u2019s price in the past. The chart shows that the rebound back in March had occurred as the social dominance had been at very high levels.\n\nAt the current value of the indicator, more than 10% of discussions related to the top 100 assets are about Ethereum. \u201cRising bearish sentiment is a good sign of an impending turnaround,\u201d explains Santiment.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether Ethereum has already found its bottom or if there is still more downside before ETH can witness a rebound.\n\nFeatured image from iStock.com, charts from TradingView.com, Santiment.net"

        "content": "In the dynamic world of cryptocurrency, Ethereum has long cemented its position as the second-largest crypto leader with an impressive market cap of $200B. Known for its robust credibility and \u2018blue-chip\u2019 status, Ethereum seemed a promising investment till it hit saturation. Today, the dream of making multifold returns from Ethereum in 2023 seems far-fetched, especially given its current market position.\n\nHowever, what if you could turn back the hands of time to 2014 when investing in Ethereum for just $0.1 would be a possibility? Well, ETH20 is here to make that \u2018what if\u2019 a reality.\n\nETH20: Echoing Ethereum\u2019s Embryonic Stage\n\nThe latest name to stir the crypto market is ETH20, an ERC-20 crypto token that operates on the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) protocol. Built atop the Ethereum blockchain, ETH20 aims to recreate the magic of Ethereum\u2019s early days promising a unique investment opportunity coupled with the potential for considerable passive income.\n\nJust as Ethereum in April 2014, ETH20\u2019s presale holds an initial circulating supply of 30 million tokens, each priced at a paltry $0.1. But that\u2019s not all. The project also lets early investors earn significant passive income through an Ethereum-based staking contract and also offers the opportunity to mint a unique NFT collection.\n\nThe ETH20 Strategy: Staking, Minting, and More\n\nETH20 has a total supply of 120 million tokens. Of these, 30 million tokens are up for grabs during the presale, each priced at $0.1. The project has earmarked a whopping 78 million tokens from the total supply to reward network participants through staking. Additionally, 12 million tokens have been specifically allocated for liquidity.\n\nETH20, a green, Proof-of-Stake (PoS) token, leverages the power of staking smart contracts to provide a secure, efficient, and flexible platform for digital transactions. Further, the project has adopted Ethereum\u2019s 12-second block rewards strategy for the distribution of rewards, offering staking returns to all members based on their proportionate share in the staking pool and the prevailing annual percentage yield.\n\nThe contract code of ETH20 has undergone a thorough manual audit by Coinsult and has been hailed as utterly secure. This bolsters faith and assurance in the ETH20 platform, marking a triumphant stride in the project\u2019s commitment to secure cryptocurrency transactions.\n\nTaking a Deep Dive into the NFT World with ETH20\n\nAnd the excitement doesn\u2019t end there! ETH20 is your ticket to an entirely new realm of collectibles \u2014 NFTs! ETH20 introduces the ETH20 Avatar NFT Collection, a dazzling array of 10,000 unique NFTs that encapsulate the essence of Ethereum and the artistic charm of pixel art.
