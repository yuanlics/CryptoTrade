        "summary": "  Layer-2 blockchains built on Ethereum offer increased security, speed, and lower costs for transactions. However, the term \"secured by Ethereum\" can be interpreted in different ways, and there are various approaches to achieving this security.\n\nThe main selling point of layer-2s is their ability to increase throughput while maintaining the security of Ethereum. This means that users can transact faster and cheaper without sacrificing the security of their assets.\n\nThere are four main types of layer-2s, each with its own trade-offs:\n\n1. zkRollups: These use validity proofs with data on L1 Ethereum, providing a secure and efficient way to roll up transactions.\n2. Optimistic Rollups: These use fraud proofs with data on L1 Ethereum, allowing for faster and cheaper transactions while maintaining security.\n3. Validium: This type uses validity proofs with data kept off-chain, providing an alternative to zkRollups.\n4. Plasma: This type also uses fraud proofs with data kept off-chain, but with a different implementation than Optimistic Rollups."

He suggests that wallets are the area to watch right now, with companies like Coinbase building \"wallet as a service\" tools to make it easier for firms to integrate crypto into their operations. Lubin's optimism is echoed by venture capitalist Chris Dixon, who believes that crypto is on the cusp of another big leap forward. However, some skeptics argue that the crypto industry needs to focus more on ensuring that people stop getting robbed, rather than pursuing utopian visions of Web3."

        "summary": "  Ethereum transactions were frozen for 12 seconds as a group of researchers demonstrated a new way to exploit the proposer-builder separation (PBS) feature to censor transactions. The group, known as the Special Mechanisms Group (SMG), showed that by bidding on priority fees, they could force a block to include only one transaction, which was a URL to their research paper. Reactions to the experiment were mixed, with some noting that the gas fee market would make it difficult to delay transactions for long. The SMG group argues that censorship-resistance is not just about ensuring transactions get on-chain eventually, but also about making it fast. They suggest that layer-2 solutions may not be able to solve all problems and that enshrined PBS, or ePBS, could be a solution to make on-chain auctions and other mechanisms more censorship-resistant."
