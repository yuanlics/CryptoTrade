The layer-2 scaling solution promises faster transaction speeds than optimistic rollups and is the first \"fully EVM equivalent\" zk rollup to reach Ethereum mainnet. The launch is seen as a significant step towards scaling Ethereum and bringing Web3 to the masses. Other teams are also competing in the zkEVM race, with different approaches, but Polygon's zkEVM has been classified as a Type-3 by Vitalik Buterin due to its near EVM equivalence and choice to forgo precompiles. Security is the highest priority, and Polygon will be revealing more details about the Mainnet Beta over the next couple of weeks. At the time of writing, Polygon's MATIC token is trading at $1.23, up by over 4% in the past 24 hours."

        "summary": "  OFAC-compliant blocks on Ethereum have reached a three-month low of 47%, according to Cointelegraph. This marks a decline from the peak of 79% on Nov. 21. The percentage of blocks excluding transactions involving sanctioned parties by the US Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). The fall could be seen as a win for those opposing censorship within the Ethereum ecosystem. The decrease may be attributed to more validators using MEV-boost relays that don't censor transactions in accordance with OFAC requirements. Labrys, a blockchain consulting firm, created MEV Watch, which tracks the percentage of OFAC-compliant blocks. The Ethereum community has made progress addressing the issue since the Merge, but there is still more work to be done. OFAC sanctioned Ether and USD Coin wallet addresses using Tornado Cash in August. After the Merge, only 9% of blocks were OFAC-censored, but this figure increased sharply over the next two months."

This is a reversal of the trend towards increased censorship following the US government's blacklisting of Tornado Cash transactions. The decrease is attributed to validators connecting to non-Flashbots relays, which are not censoring Tornado Cash transactions by default. There are now seven non-censoring relays, with BloXroute, Ultrasound, and Gnosis making up the majority of uncensored block space. While this is a positive development, the dependence on just a few entities raises concerns about the long-term sustainability of Ethereum's censorship resistance."

The collectible was burned using a new feature called Teleburn, which allows users to assign an existing asset from another network to a Bitcoin Inscription while removing it from circulation. The move has sparked discussion in the NFT community, with some seeing it as a way to bridge digital collectibles across chains, while others question the legitimacy of the burned asset. The owner of BAYC #1626 believes the Ape now exists on Bitcoin, while Yuga Labs, the creator of the Bored Ape Yacht Club, states that the Inscription linked to the Ape is an unlicensed reproduction since the owner no longer maintains its possession on Ethereum's network. The development of the Teleburn function has the potential to change the way digital collectibles are traded and valued, but it remains to be seen how the market will respond to this new approach."

The SEC has deemed the program an unregistered security, and Kraken has agreed to shut it down. This development has implications for the broader cryptocurrency industry, as it highlights the tension between blockchain networks and nation-states in terms of international sanctions.\n\nLast year, the Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) imposed sanctions on a smart contract called Tornado Cash, which was frequently used by criminals and hostile nation-states. In response, some cryptocurrency exchanges, including Kraken, have been censoring transactions that touch Tornado Cash or other suspicious addresses. However, not all validators are complying with these sanctions, and the proportion of blocks that censor transactions has been dropping, according to MEVWatch, a site that tracks blockchain censorship.\n\nThe situation raises questions about the political neutrality of cryptocurrency and the extent to which it"

Gas costs and transaction finality have increased due to network load, but the Ethereum Merge set the groundwork for future gas fee optimizations. Optimistic and Zero-Knowledge (ZK) rollups help reduce computational demands on the Ethereum network by moving transactions off-chain, bundling them, and submitting them as a single piece of data. ZK-rollups have the advantage of always reflecting a correct L2 state, but require proofs for all state transitions, which limits scalability. ZK-rollup space is focused on StarkNet, zkSync, Polygon zkEVM, and Scroll, with each project taking a different angle on data availability and proving algorithms. Challenges include language compatibility, secretive nature of projects, and decentralization. Projects plan to decentralize sequencer functions and tokenize services to generate activity and decentralize products. The future of zkEVMs is competitive, with projects like StarkNet, zkSync, and Polygon zk"
