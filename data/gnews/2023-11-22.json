        "title": "Ethereum (ETH) Shows Crucial Breakthrough, Most Important Test Is Ahead - U.Today",
        "content": "Disclaimer: The opinions expressed by our writers are their own and do not represent the views of U.Today. The financial and market information provided on U.Today is intended for informational purposes only. U.Today is not liable for any financial losses incurred while trading cryptocurrencies. Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nEthereum (ETH) has been a focal point for crypto enthusiasts and investors alike, and its latest chart is a pivotal moment for the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. As ETH approaches a well-known resistance level that has stymied its progress multiple times in the past, the crypto community is watching with bated breath to see if this test will result in a definitive breakthrough.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe resistance level in question has acted like a ceiling for Ethereum's price, capping its upward momentum on several occasions. Now, as ETH inches closer to this barrier once again, the stakes are high. A successful break above this level could confirm a bullish trend, potentially propelling the price to new highs.\n\nTechnical analysis suggests that if Ethereum manages to sustain a breakout above this resistance, we could witness an accelerated move toward the next major psychological level. The key will be a strong closing above the resistance on significant volume, which would likely attract more buyers into the market, further fueling the upward trajectory.\n\nAn interesting aspect to consider is the market's reaction to recent news events, such as the departure of Changpeng Zhao (CZ) from Binance. Contrary to some expectations, CZ's stepping down has not had a detrimental impact on the market. Instead, it may have alleviated some regulatory concerns, removing a potential risk factor and possibly contributing to a healthier market environment for major assets like Ethereum.\n\nThe Fibonacci extension levels and previous high points could serve as markers for where the price might head. Conversely, if Ethereum fails to break through, it may retest lower support levels, but the overall trend still appears to be leaning toward the positive, given the recent market resilience."

        "content": "Shiba Inu (SHIB) has announced a crucial partnership with Atomic Wallet to expose its tokens to over five million users. Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) saw a price surge after BlackRock took a significant step ahead in the approval of a spot Ethereum ETF. However, a new coin is gaining traction as it aims for a $100 million market cap.\n\nLet\u2019s explore what this new emerging crypto coin is and why some crypto enthusiasts are looking into it and considering it a contender for the cryptos to watch out for!\n\nShiba Inu Announces Integration With Atomic Wallet, SHIB Soars\n\nOn November 15, 2023, Shiba Inu confirmed the integration of Atomic Wallet, a prominent non-custodial decentralized wallet, into its platform. This integration marks a strategic move for Shiba Inu, allowing the wallet's expansive user base of 5 million to access the Shibarium blockchain seamlessly.\n\nThe announcement highlights Atomic Wallet's newfound support for Shibarium-native cryptocurrencies, including SHIB, LEASH, and BONE. Since its launch in August, Shibarium has rapidly gained adoption, processing nearly 3.5 million transactions within its initial 90 days.\n\nFollowing the news of the integration, the market responded with a notable surge in the price of Shiba Inu. On November 15, the SHIB price stood at $0.000008343, and after the announcement, SHIB experienced a substantial increase of 9.7%, reaching $0.000009156 by November 16. But has since experienced a decrease in price to $0.000007947 as of November 22.\n\nPer SHIB price prediction, some enthusiasts anticipate a bullish trajectory for Shiba Inu. Projections indicate that SHIB could experience an impressive surgeby 2024.\n\nThis optimistic outlook is grounded in anticipating an upcoming bull run, coupled with the positive impact of recent partnerships and integrations.\n\nHowever, a more conservative forecast suggests that SHIB may maintain a more modest level in 2024, acknowledging the potential influence of bearish sentiments in the market.\n\nBlackRock Registers Ishares Ethereum Trust in Delaware\n\nIn a pivotal move on November 9, 2023, Blackrock took a significant step in the crypto space by formally recording its Ishares Ethereum Trust with Delaware\u2019s Division of Corporations.\n\nThe official document, dated November 9, identifies the trust as statutory and acknowledges Blackrock Advisors as the filing party. This development has sparked speculation among market watchers, hinting that Blackrock may be strategically positioning itself to introduce a spot Ethereum ETF.\n\nThis move follows the firm's earlier submission for a spot Bitcoin ETF on June 15, for which regulatory approval from the SEC is still pending.\n\nThe market's immediate response to this news has been substantial, with the price of Ethereum experiencing a notable surge. On November 9, ETH was trading at $1,884.20. However, post-announcement, ETH soared by 10% to $2,018.66 as of November 22.\n\nPer ETH price prediction, Ethereum's future appears promising.\n\nThis optimistic outlook is grounded in anticipating an upcoming bull run and the potential approval of an Ethereum ETF.\n\nRebel Satoshi: A New Meme Coin Aiming for the $100 Market Cap\n\nRebel Satoshi (RBLZ) has emerged as more than just a meme coin; it's a passionate force aiming to disrupt the status quo and achieve a remarkable $100 million market capitalization. As crypto enthusiasts seek the next hidden gem, Rebel Satoshi positions itself as a unique blend of playfulness, purpose, and the potential for substantial returns.\n\nAt its core, Rebel Satoshi represents a movement, a call to rebellion against centralized systems and the entrenched elite. Inspired by historical figures like Satoshi Nakamoto and Guy Fawkes, Rebel Satoshi carries the torch of defiance and unity.\n\nThe $RBLZ token, an ERC-20 standard asset, becomes the symbolic embodiment of this mission, signifying unity against the established norms in the crypto space.\n\nKey features of $RBLZ include staking rewards, deflationary characteristics, meme coin status, a limited collection of 9,999 rare and exclusive NFTs, and governance within the Rebel Satoshi ecosystem.\n\nCurrently in the Early Bid Round of its public presale with a price of $0.010, the company says that $RBLZ is poised to list on exchanges at $0.025.\n\nFor the latest updates and more information, be sure to visit the official Rebel Satoshi Presale Website or contact Rebel Red via Telegram\n\nThis post was authored by an external contributor and does not represent Benzinga's opinions and has not been edited for content.
