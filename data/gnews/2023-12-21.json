        "content": "Legal clarity will also likely improve in 2024, in Moody\u2019s view, as regulators progress in developing frameworks to support new digital assets and services, although not all regions are advancing at the same pace. Regions including the EU, Singapore and the UAE could all attract new investors as a result of new customer and investor protections and new licensing regimes for digital assets. The U.S., meanwhile, will likely continue to use regulatory enforcement actions to establish legal precedent within the digital asset marketplace, as development of a digital asset framework in the U.S. remains a more distant goal."

        "content": "Solana\u2019s DeFi DEX Volume Surpasses Ethereum\u2019s For the First Time\n\nSolana (SOL) has achieved a significant milestone by surpassing Ethereum (ETH) in terms of decentralized exchange (DEX) trading volume over the past week. According to DefiLlama, DEX volume on Solana soared to $10.1 billion over the last seven days, while Ethereum recorded $8.8 billion in volume during the same period.\n\nSolana's recent surge in DEX activity can be attributed to its lower gas fees compared to Ethereum, and rise of memecoin trading. The chain\u2019s leading memecoin, BONK, dominated headlines after its meteoric rise to over a billion-dollar market capitalization, following Binance and Coinbase listings. Another Solana memecoin, Dogwifhat (WIF), has also captured attention, skyrocketing from obscurity to reach $322 million in market cap. BONK and WIF are among the top traded tokens on Solana DEXs over the past week, excluding stablecoins.\n\nThe success of these memecoins and heightened activity, coupled with major airdrops from protocols like Jito (JTO), have contributed to SOL's impressive rally, with the token flipping XRP and reaching a new 2023 high of $99, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nHowever, despite recent gains, SOL's market cap currently sits just above $41 billion, while Ethereum remains has a market cap of $268 billion, more than seven times larger than Solana.\n\nLet us know what you loved about this article, what could be improved, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form."
