        "content": "If you decided to invest $100 in each BTC and ETH last Christmas, how much would they be worth today?\n\nAs the market is seemingly out of a prolonged crypto winter that began in early 2022, on Christmas day, we\u2019re witnessing a significant contrast in the value of major cryptocurrencies, notably Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), compared to the previous year\u2019s values.\n\nIf an investor had the foresight to invest or gift someone $100 worth in Bitcoin and Ethereum last Christmas, they would be reaping some handsome profits.\n\nLet\u2019s delve into the numbers. On Christmas Day in 2022, Bitcoin was valued at approximately $16,900. Fast forward to today, it stands at around $43,500. This substantial growth means that a $100 investment in Bitcoin a year ago would now be worth approximately $257.4, representing a 157.4% increase.\n\nYou might also like: SEC met multiple spot Bitcoin ETF applicants on Dec. 21\n\nEthereum has shown a similar performance. It has soared from around $1,200 on Christmas Day 2022 to about $2,290 today. Consequently, a $100 investment in Ethereum last Christmas would now amount to approximately $190.83, marking a 90.8% increase.\n\nHeading into 2024, the market is beaming with positivity, as the hype of Bitcoin ETFs and halving is poised to bring the market back to its all-time highs. Analysts are hoping for this bull market to stretch beyond next Christmas, but it will depend on which side of the scale market sentiment goes in the new year.\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "content": "Ethereum price is correcting gains from the $2,350 resistance zone. ETH could start a fresh increase if it stays above the $2,200 support zone.\n\nEthereum started a downside correction from the $2,350 resistance zone.\n\nThe price is trading near $2,275 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $2,285 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair could attempt a fresh increase unless there is a close below $2,200.\n\nEthereum Price Remains Supported\n\nEthereum price failed again to gain pace for a move above the $2,350 level. ETH formed a short-term near $2,350 and recently started a downside correction, like Bitcoin.\n\nThere was a move below the $2,320 and $2,300 levels. The price even spiked below $2,250. A low was formed near $2,247 and the price is now correcting higher. There was a move above the $2,265 level. The price climbed above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2,326 swing high to the $2,247 low.\n\nEthereum is now near $2,275 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $2,285 level. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $2,285 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.\n\nThe trend line is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2,326 swing high to the $2,247 low. A close above the $2,285 resistance could send the price toward $2,350.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nA clear move above the $2,350 zone could start a major increase. The next resistance sits at $2,420. Any more gains could start a wave toward the $2,500 level, above which Ethereum might rally and test the $2,550 zone.\n\nMore Losses in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $2,285 resistance, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,220 level.\n\nThe first key support could be the $2,200 zone. A downside break and a close below $2,200 might send the price further lower. In the stated case, Ether could revisit the $2,170 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,120 level in the coming sessions.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bullish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $2,200\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $2,285\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Shayan is a digital nomad and a professional journalist. He delivers high-quality engaging articles to Coinpedia through his in-depth research and analysis.\n\nIn recent weeks, Ethereum\u2019s price has witnessed a growing surge of confidence as the total crypto market cap prepares to gain old momentum. As Bitcoin\u2019s dominance exhibits a minor downturn, traders are increasingly placing their bets on Ethereum. This has steered Ethereum\u2019s price towards critical immediate resistance levels. Analysts are now keenly observing whether Ethereum will break the $2,500 mark, marking a significant surge, or if it will encounter a decline.\n\nOI Loses Momentum Near High\n\nData from Coinglass reveals a recent decline in Ethereum\u2019s open interest (OI), signaling a reduction in market momentum. The OI decreased from a peak of $7.95 billion to $7.57 billion, marking a drop of more than $380 million. This trend indicates that traders are actively closing their futures positions, which in turn is leading to a decrease in Ethereum\u2019s volatility.\n\nIn the past 24 hours, Ethereum\u2019s price experienced a total liquidation exceeding $15 million. This occurred as Ethereum struggled to break above the $2,300 mark, resulting in the liquidation of $10 million worth of long positions.\n\nA recent report by crypto analytics firm IntoTheBlock shows that Ethereum\u2019s market cap has surged by 87% in the past year, rising from about $149 billion to its present value of $280 billion. Despite this growth, Ethereum\u2019s performance, when compared to other major assets, indicates that there is still room for improvement, particularly given the numerous positive developments the asset has undergone in 2023.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Layer 1 scalability challenges and high transaction fees have halted the expansion of its DeFi ecosystem. Despite being a leading player in decentralized applications, Ethereum\u2019s scaling limitations have resulted in high costs and slower transactions, leading to user and developer dissatisfaction.\n\nIn contrast, Solana has been advancing rapidly, outpacing Ethereum with its high throughput and low-cost transactions. Solana has been dominating the altcoin market recently with robust buying demand, capturing a significant market share and surpassing ETH.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next For ETH Price?\n\nEther\u2019s price surged past the 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), reaching $2,300, but failed to hold momentum due to increasing selling pressure. Currently, bears are aiming for a decline to solidify their positions. As of writing, ETH price trades at $2,278, declining over 0.8% from yesterday\u2019s rate.\n\nShould the price remain above $2,300, it is anticipated that Ether might approach its 52-week peak of $2,403. This level is crucial for sellers to defend, as a breakthrough and sustained trading above this mark could trigger the next upward trend phase, potentially pushing the ETH price towards the $2,500 mark.\n\nConversely, if Ether faces resistance at this key level and starts to decline, it might retest the significant support level around $2,200. For the sellers to gain an advantage, they would need to break the ascending support line. In that case, we might see ETH price below the $2K mark."
