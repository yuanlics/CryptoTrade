        "summary": "  The article from CryptoPotato discusses the similarities between the current market cycle of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) and previous cycles, specifically the 2018-2022 period. According to a research report by Coinbase Research and Glassnode, the prices of both cryptocurrencies have surged by 500% and 1,000%, respectively, following a pattern that mirrors previous trends. The report highlights various cyclicality metrics, such as net unrealized profit/loss and supply in profit, which indicate that the current market state does not resemble the euphoric conditions seen during the peak of 2023. However, the report also notes a lack of robust supporting evidence for the potential positive impact of the forthcoming Bitcoin halving, and cautions that the relationship between the halving and market performance is somewhat speculative. Additionally, the article discusses the success of the Shapella upgrade and the increasing likelihood of approval for spot crypto ETFs as factors driving the surge in Ethereum's price in 2023, and the upcoming E"

According to the analysis, Ethereum has outperformed Bitcoin since the fake approval of the spot Bitcoin ETF, with a 10% increase in value. The firm's head of research notes that the SEC's approval order for spot Bitcoin ETFs may pave the way for the approval of an Ethereum ETF, as both assets are subject to the same potential manipulation. Traders are also accumulating crypto assets supporting ETH's ecosystem, with layer-2 tokens and liquid staking protocols recording gains of over 10%. The analysis concludes that market speculators have shifted their attention to ETH in anticipation of spot ETFs generating a similar effect on the second-largest crypto asset.

According to Glassnode data, 91.6% of the total ETH supply, equivalent to 110 million coins, are in profit. This surge in the percentage of profitable coins is attributed to the recent price increase, which has risen by almost 10% since the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) approval of a Bitcoin ETF.\n\nHowever, the article also notes that the disparity in trading strategies adopted by short-term and long-term holders could impact the future price of ETH. Short-term traders may be tempted to sell their coins to lock in profits, which could lead to temporary price dips if selling pressure outweighs buying. On the other hand, long-term holders may be more inclined to hold their coins, reducing the circulating supply and potentially contributing to price appreciation in the long term.\n\nThe article also provides technical analysis indicators, such as the Relative Strength Index"
