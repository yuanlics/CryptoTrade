        "summary": "  Sure, here's a summary of the article in less than 256 tokens:\n\nCrypto markets had a turbulent weekend with prices plunging on Monday. Ethereum, Bitcoin, and Dogecoin saw significant drops, with Ethereum's price falling due to the Ethereum Foundation transferring tokens to an exchange. Bitcoin's congestion and high transaction fees also contributed to its decline. The drop is likely due to profit-taking, but high fees remain a problem for crypto's wider adoption. Binance's actions are being closely watched, and investors are concerned about the impact of these events on the long-term market."

        "summary": "  Ethereum gas fees have skyrocketed to an unexpected level, with a single transaction incurring a fee of 64 ETH (worth approximately $118,600) according to WhaleAlert. This is a concern for traders, as it was expected that the transition to proof-of-stake (PoS) would help decongest the network. However, the recent meme coin hype and panic selling have contributed to network congestion, leading to high gas fees. Layer 2 solutions such as Polygon zkEVM, Arbitrum, and Optimism have emerged as alternatives to Ethereum's main chain, offering lower fees and scalability."

        "summary": "  Title: Liquid staking tokens to fuel the next DeFi boom\n\nSummary: The DeFi space is experiencing a correction after reaching a peak of $50 billion in TVL. However, the market is preparing for another wave of adoption, primarily driven by liquid staking tokens (LSTs). LSTs allow Ether (ETH) stakers to benefit from yield farming opportunities while their ETH tokens are locked, providing a native form of yield. The Shanghai upgrade, which allows stakers to withdraw their staked tokens for the first time since the Beacon Chain integration, is expected to boost demand for staking services that provide yield opportunities. Liquid staking protocols are addressing main obstacles in the LST space, including complexity, poor user experience, and high fees. Swell is one of the few liquid staking protocols that are working to address these challenges, providing a user-friendly experience, reducing fees, and focusing on security. Swell can help DeFi projects attract more users and secure a continual growth of the sector's TVL, while individual stakers can start earning rewards without any deposit barriers"
