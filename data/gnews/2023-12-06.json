        "content": "SEC Delays Grayscale Spot Ethereum ETF Decision, Extends Review to January 2024\n\nThe United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced it will delay its decision on Grayscale's proposed Ethereum spot ETF. The SEC needs more time to assess a proposed rule change that would allow NYSE Arca to list and trade shares of the Grayscale Ethereum Trust.\n\nThe SEC has allocated a longer period to evaluate the proposed rule change and has set January 25, 2024, as the deadline for its decision or the initiation of proceedings to determine its disapproval. The SEC emphasized the importance of having sufficient time to thoroughly consider the proposal and the concerns raised.\n\nWhile the SEC has approved investment vehicles tied to crypto futures in the past, it has not yet given approval for a spot BTC or ETH ETF on a U.S. exchange. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart speculated that if the commission approves a spot BTC ETF, it could potentially proceed with approving funds from multiple firms simultaneously.\n\nGrayscale submitted its filing in October, seeking to convert shares of its Grayscale Ethereum Trust into an Ether ETF. The company is among other firms, including BlackRock, Hashdex, ARK 21Shares, Invesco Galaxy, VanEck, and Fidelity, awaiting a decision from the SEC regarding their spot crypto ETF applications.\n\nLet us know what you loved about this article, what could be improved, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form."

To forecast Ethereum's potential to hit this target, let\u2019s examine its technological infrastructure and historical market performance.\n\nEthereum stands apart from other cryptocurrencies through its foundational technology \u2013 it's a decentralized platform, built for decentralized applications dApps). At its core, Ethereum operates on a blockchain that supports smart contracts \u2013 self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code.\n\nThis functionality has opened a wide range of possibilities, from decentralized finance (DeFi) to non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). Acronyms aside, there\u2019s a ton of potential in these innovative new products, the key being decentralization. This quality makes Ethereum the backbone of the current crypto-ecosystem, as the most popular applications in crypto are built on Ethereum.\n\nWhy Did Ethereum Crash?\n\nEthereum, like many cryptocurrencies, experiences intense market cycles characterized by rapid price increases followed by sharp declines. For instance, during the 2018-2019 period, Ethereum witnessed a significant crash following the 2017 crypto boom. After reaching a peak price of $1400, ether crashed below $100 in the subsequent years.\n\nThis pattern reflects a typical boom and bust cycle where the initial excitement and overinvestment (often fueled by FOMO) leads to inflated prices, which are unsustainable in the long run. The COVID black swan event in 2020, followed by increased money printing and record-low interest rates, demonstrates this trend.\n\nWhen Will Ethereum Hit All-time Highs?\n\nFor Ethereum to hit all-time highs depends on its technical progression and user adoption, as well as large macro trends. Two upcoming events could play a big role in moving the price of ETH upwards, which are slated to happen in 2024.\n\n\n\nThe Fed may pivot to risk-off with looser monetary policies in 2024. When money flows back into the economy, crypto historically acts like a sponge for the excess liquidity, benefiting Ethereum.\n\n\n\nThe second key event is the Bitcoin halving next year, which decreases the amount of BTC rewarded to Bitcoin miners by 50%, an action that has historically caused the crypto market to rally.\n\nHistory of Ethereum Prices\n\nEthereum's (ETH) price shows a pattern of volatility with significant peaks and troughs. For instance, after its launch in 2015, Ethereum saw a surge in 2017 during the ICO boom followed by a sharp decline in 2018.\n\nHowever, its recovery and subsequent growth, especially with the rise of DeFi and NFTs, indicates a growing confidence in its utility and value. Despite the crash in 2022, these trends may justify a price target of $10,000. While ambitious, it does not seem implausible in the next few years.\n\nCould Ethereum Hit $20,000?\n\nThe likelihood of Ethereum hitting $20,000 in 2024 is quite low, although some people believe in its potential and are willing to bet it will hit this mark next year. More realistically, ETH bulls who believe in the technology are holding for the long term.\n\nThe $20,000 mark is more believable if you are willing to hold for many years. If you zoom out on the ETH chart, you can see a 10x in ETH price has happened before, so you shouldn\u2019t rule it out of happening again.\n\nWhere to Buy Ethereum (ETH)\n\nYou can buy ETH on most trading platforms. One popular platform is Kraken, which offers many other cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum layer 2s. The alternative to a trading platform is to use a non-custodial wallet and purchase from a decentralized exchange (DEX).\n\nIs Ethereum a Good Investment?\n\nInvestment in crypto is almost certain to be volatile. Many altcoins (cryptocurrencies that are not Bitcoin) have crashed to $0. However, Ethereum has shown staying power and has begun to provide enough utility that a lot of the speculatory risk has been lifted.\n\nIndividuals looking to get exposure to crypto outside of Bitcoin tend to hold ETH. The best way to understand if this is a good investment for you is to use the blockchain and get a better understanding of the decentralization philosophy. Then, you can decide for yourself whether this is something you want to trade or hold.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions"
