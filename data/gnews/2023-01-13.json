        "title": "Ethereum 'shark' accumulation, Shanghai hard fork put $2K ETH price in play - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Ether (ETH) price technicals suggest that 35% gains are in play by March 2022 due to several bullish technical and fundamental factors.\n\nEther price rises above two key moving averages\n\nOn Jan. 8, Ether\u2019s price crossed above its 21-week exponential moving average (21-week EMA; the purple wave) and 200-day simple moving average (200-day SMA; the orange wave).\n\nHistorically, these two moving averages have separated bull and bear markets. When ETH\u2019s price trades above them, it is considered to be in a bull market, and vice versa.\n\nETH/USD daily price chart featuring 21-week EMA and 200-day SMA. Source: TradingView\n\nThe last time Ether crossed above its 21-week EMA and 200-day SMA was in April 2022. But this was a fakeout, in part due to the collapse of Terra (LUNA) the following month.\n\nBut while Ether\u2019s MA crossover does not guarantee further gains, the upside potential becomes greater if one looks at it in conjugation with other bullish factors, described below.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Shanghai hard fork, shark accumulation\n\nEther\u2019s price has risen by up to 20% in the first two weeks of January 2023, driven upward by an easing macro outlook and growing anticipation of Ethereum\u2019s upcoming Shanghai upgrade.\n\nThe upgrade is expected to go live in March and will enable withdrawals of staked ETH.\n\nRelated: 5 signs that an altcoin bull run could be underway\n\nSeveral experts, including Messari research analyst Kunal Goel and IntoTheBlock head of research Lucas Outumuro, believe the Shanghai upgrade will make staking Ether more attractive despite the sell-off risks of unlocking a large chunk of Ether\u2019s supply.\n\nMeanwhile, a rise in Ethereum\u2019s richest addresses is already underway by entities called \u201csharks\u201d that hold anywhere between 100 and 10,000 ETH. The number of sharks has grown by 3,000 since November 2022, according to data from Santiment.\n\nEthereum shark addresses. Source: Santiment\n\nThis suggests a strong accumulation of ETH, which may be a key reason behind ETH\u2019s current rebound so far in 2023.\n\nETH\u2019s price eyes breakout above key trendline\n\nFrom a technical perspective, Ether is eyeing a breakout above a resistance confluence, namely the 50-3D EMA (the red wave) near $1,395, and a descending trendline that comes as a part of a prevailing symmetrical triangle.\n\nETH/USD three-day price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nIn other words, a decisive close above the confluence could have ETH pursue a run-up toward its next upside target at its 200-3D EMA (the blue wave) near $1,880, up around 35% compared to current price levels.\n\nInterestingly, the $1,880 level was instrumental as resistance in May 2022 and August 2022.\n\nConversely, a pullback from the confluence would increase Ether\u2019s possibility of undergoing a correction toward the symmetrical triangle\u2019s lower trendline around $1,200, or a 15% price decline from current levels.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations. Every investment and trading move involves risk, and readers should conduct their own research when making a decision."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nThe popular crypto wallet MetaMask has launched its staking functionality, meaning that users can now lock up their Ethereum through the new feature via Lido or Rocket Pool to earn financial rewards.\n\nWhat that means is anyone with a MetaMask wallet can now easily start earning yield on any amount of ETH they\u2019d like right from their wallet, and without having to navigate what can often be complicated user interfaces on staking applications. But should they?\n\nStaking, after all, isn\u2019t without risk\u2014not to mention the fact that unstaking (i.e. getting your ETH back from a staking contract) isn\u2019t an option right now. Ethereum developers say, however, that this feature will be coming soon.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWEN STAKING? We are extremely happy to announce that you can now stake ETH with Lido or Rocket Pool through the Portfolio Dapp\ud83c\udf89 \ud83d\udd17https://t.co/HVLvcSDbw6 pic.twitter.com/9VkiU5jlsw \u2014 MetaMask \ud83e\udd8a\ud83d\udc99 (@MetaMask) January 13, 2023\n\nStaking Providers\n\nFor users who don\u2019t mind the risks, staking can be a lucrative activity. While the rewards rates vary, MetaMask\u2019s site claims users can earn a yield of about 5.22% per year on ETH deposits with Lido, and 4.59% with Rocket Pool.\n\nAccording to Lido\u2019s website, over $6.9 billion of ETH is currently staked through its service, earning users roughly 4.9% annually. Lido is a so-called liquid staking provider, meaning users who stake ETH through Lido receive an equivalent amount of Staked Ethereum (stETH) in return for their staked tokens. This enables stakers to remain \u201cliquid\u201d while locking up their ETH, allowing them to use their stETH on other DeFi services.\n\nStaked Ethereum currently trades at a slight discount to ETH. While ETH is priced at around $1,418, stETH currently trades for $1,407, per CoinGecko data.\n\nLido is currently the most popular staking provider, with 29% of all staked ETH, according to Dune Analytics data.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRocket Pool is another liquid staking service, which provides users with rETH in return for their staked tokens. But Rocket Pool on MetaMask appears to have already reached \u201cmax capacity,\u201d meaning users may only have the option to stake ETH through Lido on MetaMask for now.\n\nRocket Pool staking via MetaMask has reached capacity. Image: MetaMask.\n\nHow many have already staked through MetaMask so far? While MetaMask\u2019s Senior Product Manager Abad Mian did not offer precise numbers, he told Decrypt that the team is pleased with the rollout thus far.\n\n\u201cWe started rolling out yesterday at 10% with full roll-out today. We have seen an exciting engagement since the news went live four hours ago,\u201d Mian said.\n\nBut there are other options for ETH staking beyond the two providers MetaMask now offers through its platform. Coinbase, Binance US, Kraken, and Nexo also offer Ethereum staking, each with varying rewards rates. Of those centralized providers, only Coinbase and Nexo currently offer a liquid staking option, returning Coinbase Wrapped Staked ETH (cbETH) tokens or Nexo Staked Ethereum (NETH) in exchange for ETH, respectively.\n\nSolo staking is also an option\u2014but users will need a minimum of 32 ETH (roughly $45,800) to do so.\n\nStaking Benefits\n\nBecause Ethereum is a proof-of-stake blockchain, more users staking ETH and running validators around the globe will, in theory, make the network more secure and decentralized over time. That\u2019s a good thing for the network, which has been criticized for being more centralized when compared to Bitcoin.\n\nPassive income through staking rewards might also seem like a no-brainer to some who are long-term holders and don\u2019t plan to immediately sell or trade their bags of ETH in the short term.\n\nStaking Risks\n\nBut locking up crypto with a third party has its risks. There\u2019s a common phrase in crypto: \u201cNot your keys, not your coins.\u201d And it has unfortunately rung true as the market deals with the devastating effects of Terra\u2019s crash and FTX\u2019s meltdown. Even now, as Gemini shutters its \u201cEarn\u201d program following the collapses of crypto lenders BlockFi and Celsius, should holders ever trust their crypto with a third party at all? What are the risks, and what do Ethereum developers think?\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMetaMask parent firm ConsenSys explained in a post last month what it believes to be the primary risks that come with staking ETH. Specifically, it points to potential risks surrounding compromised third-party software, buggy smart contracts, and substantial token price fluctuations.\n\nIt also raises the possible risks associated with undesirable governance decisions made through any related DAOs, issues with code transfers, \u201clegal uncertainty,\u201d and the possibility of compromised private keys. While that might seem like a broad range of potential risks, each one is possible if the user compromises their own data\u2014or a powerful third-party makes decisions that change the rules of the game.\n\nStaking Withdrawals\n\nBefore considering staking Ethereum, it\u2019s essential to know that unstaking is not currently available. This means that right now, your Ethereum can go in\u2014but it can\u2019t yet come out. This might come as a shock to some, as it means that staking is currently a one-way experience, but Ethereum developers have plans to change that very soon.\n\nThe Shanghai update slated for early this year will enable staked ETH withdrawals.\n\n\u201cAfter the Shanghai update, stakers will then be able to withdraw their rewards and/or principle deposit from their validator balance if they choose,\u201d the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s website reads.\n\nEthereum developer Marius van der Wijden told Decrypt that withdrawals could come as soon as March.\n\n\u201cWe have launched three withdrawal devnets and will do some withdrawal shadow forks soon (where we enable the feature on a shadow copy of the normal Ethereum chain),\u201d he told Decrypt in a message. \u201cWithdrawals are expected to go live in March.\u201d\n\nAs to whether Ethereum holders should stake their ETH or not, \u201cpeople should listen to their gut whether they want to stake now or in a couple of months,\u201d van der Wijden said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe code for withdrawals is mostly done, but it still needs to be thoroughly tested before being rolled out,\u201d he said."

Of those centralized providers, only Coinbase and Nexo currently offer a liquid staking option, returning Coinbase Wrapped Staked ETH (cbETH) tokens or Nexo Staked Ethereum (NETH) in exchange for ETH, respectively.\n\nSolo staking is also an option\u2014but users will need a minimum of 32 ETH (roughly $45,800) to do so.\n\nStaking Benefits\n\nBecause Ethereum is a proof-of-stake blockchain, more users staking ETH and running validators around the globe will, in theory, make the network more secure and decentralized over time. That\u2019s a good thing for the network, which has been criticized for being more centralized when compared to Bitcoin.\n\nBig Firms Dominate Post-Merge Ethereum Validation\n\nPassive income through staking rewards might also seem like a no-brainer to some who are long-term holders and don\u2019t plan to immediately sell or trade their bags of ETH in the short term.\n\nStaking Risks\n\nBut locking up crypto with a third party has its risks. There\u2019s a common phrase in crypto: \u201cNot your keys, not your coins.\u201d And it has unfortunately rung true as the market deals with the devastating effects of Terra\u2019s crash and FTX\u2019s meltdown. Even now, as Gemini shutters its \u201cEarn\u201d program following the collapses of crypto lenders BlockFi and Celsius, should holders ever trust their crypto with a third party at all? What are the risks, and what do Ethereum developers think?\n\nEthereum Staking Pools: Who Runs the Largest Ones?\n\nMetaMask parent firm ConsenSys explained in a post last month what it believes to be the primary risks that come with staking ETH. Specifically, it points to potential risks surrounding compromised third-party software, buggy smart contracts, and substantial token price fluctuations.\n\nIt also raises the possible risks associated with undesirable governance decisions made through any related DAOs, issues with code transfers, \u201clegal uncertainty,\u201d and the possibility of compromised private keys. While that might seem like a broad range of potential risks, each one is possible if the user compromises their own data\u2014or a powerful third-party makes decisions that change the rules of the game.\n\nStaking Withdrawals\n\nBefore considering staking Ethereum, it\u2019s essential to know that unstaking is not currently available. This means that right now, your Ethereum can go in\u2014but it can\u2019t yet come out. This might come as a shock to some, as it means that staking is currently a one-way experience, but Ethereum developers have plans to change that very soon.\n\nEthereum Staking Tokens Rally as Shanghai Upgrade Nears\n\nThe Shanghai update slated for early this year will enable staked ETH withdrawals.\n\n\u201cAfter the Shanghai update, stakers will then be able to withdraw their rewards and/or principle deposit from their validator balance if they choose,\u201d the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s website reads.\n\nEthereum developer Marius van der Wijden told Decrypt that withdrawals could come as soon as March.\n\n\u201cWe have launched three withdrawal devnets and will do some withdrawal shadow forks soon (where we enable the feature on a shadow copy of the normal Ethereum chain),\u201d he told Decrypt in a message. \u201cWithdrawals are expected to go live in March.\u201d\n\nAs to whether Ethereum holders should stake their ETH or not, \u201cpeople should listen to their gut whether they want to stake now or in a couple of months,\u201d van der Wijden said.\n\n\u201cThe code for withdrawals is mostly done, but it still needs to be thoroughly tested before being rolled out,\u201d he said."
