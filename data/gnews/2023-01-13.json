This is the second consecutive week of gains, with Bitcoin reaching $19k for the first time in two months. The strong performance of stock indexes, particularly the tech sector, is contributing to the bullish trend. Recent positive inflation data and other encouraging economic data have improved investor attitudes, leading to a rise in the Fear & Greed Index to 31 points. Cardano (ADA) is among the top gainers, with a 25% increase in the past week. Technical signals are supporting the uptrend, but support levels need to be consolidated to validate the bullish structure. A break below $17,500 could undo the good work done so far. Ethereum is revisiting $1,440 levels, with $1,300 being the first support level. If the rise continues without a pause, $1,600 will be the next target for short-term traders."
