        "title": "3 Cryptos to Buy Before the Coming Ethereum Upgrade - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s (ETH-USD) dominance as the leading smart contract and Web 3.0 platform is facing its most significant test yet. The upcoming Deneb/Cancun upgrade could once again revolutionize interest in this token. However, it\u2019s also an upgrade that comes with some element of risk. Thus, it\u2019s wise to align your portfolio to benefit from any potential impact of this upgrade, and do so in a way that limits your downside exposure.\n\nThe main feature of this upgrade is called proto-danksharding. In plain English, this scaling solution should make Ethereum layer 2 rollups much faster and cheaper to use. For those unaware, rollups move computation and data storage off the main Ethereum chain. However, these computations still retain the underlying security and decentralization Ethereum provides.\n\nProto-danksharding allows large blobs of transaction data to be stored briefly on the main chain, just long enough for validation, before getting passed along to rollups. This eliminates the need for expensive calldata that has previously congested the Ethereum network.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWhile the upgrade could be a huge boost for many Web 3.0 projects built on smart contracts or reliant on transaction speeds, Web 3.0 assets remain highly speculative. As such, I only recommend allocating a small portion of your crypto portfolio to chase the upside in these tokens.\n\nWith that said, here are three cryptos to buy ahead of this major upgrade.\n\nEthereum (ETH-USD)\n\nCrypto currency etherium. ethereum coin on exchange charts. e-currency Ethereum. Ethereum price predictions\n\nSource: viktoryabov / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs the dominant smart contract and Web 3.0 ecosystem, Ethereum has the most to gain from its ambitious Deneb/Cancun upgrade. While the upgrade aims to solve Ethereum\u2019s nagging fee issues, Vitalik Buterin has hinted that base gas costs may still rise, keeping prices high for end users. However, developers could have a field day with greatly-improved layer-2 efficiency. This might just be enough to retain developers into Ethereum\u2019s orbit, rather than losing talent to rival chains like Solana (SOL-USD) or Avalanche (AVAX-USD).\n\nStory continues\n\nI remain adamantly bullish on Ethereum heading into the upgrade event. As a deflationary cryptocurrency, growing demand for Ethereum tokens fueled by Web3 apps should drive prices higher. And with Ethereum hosting most smart contract-based platforms, demand is likely to increase over time. Deneb/Cancun will be a definitive test of Ethereum\u2019s technical prowess and its ability to meet user needs.\n\nBeyond the upgrade, there are some promising emergent use cases that could propel Ethereum adoption. Decentralized finance (DeFi) retains strong activity, decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) are on the rise, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are transforming digital ownership and asset provenance, and even central banks are experimenting with the prospect of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) on Ethereum. As both a crypto asset and a decentralized network powering Web3, Ethereum remains a top long-term buy.\n\nOptimism (OP-USD)\n\nCrypto coins on a phone screen showing stats for various cryptocurrencies.. Cryptos to Buy Before the Market Swing. rising meme cryptos. altcoins\n\nSource: Chinnapong / Shutterstock\n\nAs a leading layer-2 scaling solution utilizing optimistic rollups for Ethereum, Optimism (OP-USD) checks all the boxes as a top Deneb/Cancun speculative buy. The project aims to provide faster and cheaper transactions for Ethereum dApps like decentralized exchanges, gaming platforms, and social networks.\n\nImportantly, Optimism is EVM-compatible, meaning developers can deploy existing smart contracts on Optimism with minimal effort. While the network is currently live, supporting prominent apps like Uniswap (UNI-USD), Synthetix (SNX-USD), and Chainlink (LINK-USD), wider usage has been hampered by throughput constraints. This could change in a big way once Optimism leverages proto-danksharding and blobs to enhance its rollups.\n\nOptimism offers an encouraging early sign of its upgrade readiness. Its team recently implemented the Ecotone hard fork on the Optimism Goerli test network. This hard fork trial enabled batch submission via EIP-4844 blobs, verifying that Optimism will hit the ground running with blob support on mainnet post-upgrade.\n\nWith strong fundamentals and a 25% market share of total value locked in layer-2 platforms at over $5.4 billion, Optimism looks poised to capitalize on the greater efficiency unlocked by Deneb/Cancun. As rollup activity expands, Optimism could be one of the biggest beneficiaries of Ethereum\u2019s push to scale.\n\n0xGasless (0XGAS-USD)\n\nA close-up shot of the concept for a cryptocurrency exchange page. Cryptos to Sell Before a Recession\n\nSource: PixieMe / Shutterstock.com\n\n0xGasless (0XGAS-USD) is a Web 3.0 project focused squarely on expanding Ethereum\u2019s addressable market by eliminating gas fees. It\u2019s a great choice for investors seeking outsized upside from higher Ethereum transaction volumes after the upgrade.\n\nAt the core of 0xGasless\u2019 offering is support for ERC-4337 and account abstraction. This is a standard that replaces traditional externally owned accounts (EOAs) with smart contract wallets. These wallets feature built-in logic for transaction validation, authorization, and, crucially \u2013 gas payment. This shields users from managing seed phrases, paying volatile gas fees directly and losing funds to theft or mistakes.\n\n0xGasless also offers intriguing functionality that could hasten mainstream adoption. For example, users can deploy ERC-4337 smart contract wallets on the user-friendly Telegram platform. Additionally, a custom paymaster service enables gas fee payment using any ERC-20 token.\n\nProjects like 0xGasless building on account abstraction and user experience have asymmetric upside. The road to mass adoption starts by allowing users to easily access Ethereum applications without crypto\u2019s usual harsh learning curve.\n\nOn Low-Capitalization and Low-Volume Cryptocurrencies: InvestorPlace does not regularly publish commentary about cryptocurrencies that have a market capitalization less than $100 million or trade with volume less than $100,000 each day.

        "content": "The Securities and Exchange Commission is expected to follow the strategy employed in approving spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds for spot Ethereum ETH +0.86% ETFs, starting with rejections and ultimately granting approval on the initial final deadline on May 23, according to Standard Chartered Bank.\n\n\"We expect pending applications for ETH U.S. spot ETFs to be approved on May 23, the final deadline for the first of the ETFs under consideration \u2014 the equivalent date to Jan. 10 for BTC ETFs,\" Geoffrey Kendrick, head of Standard Chartered Bank's forex and digital assets research, wrote in a report on Tuesday. \"If ETH prices perform similarly to how BTC prices performed in the lead-up to BTC ETF approval, ETH could trade as high as $4,000 by then.\"\n\nKendrick foresees the approval of spot Ethereum ETFs primarily on the grounds that the SEC has not categorized ether as a security in its legal actions against crypto companies, and the listing of ETH as a regulated futures contract on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange adds weight to this expectation.\n\n\"Grayscale also has an ETH trust that it wants to turn into an ETF, so a denial of that application would likely lead to another appeal by Grayscale,\" he said, adding that \"we see no fundamental reason for the SEC to view ETH differently than the CME already does.\"\n\nConsistently optimistic\n\nKendrick generally holds an optimistic outlook on crypto, especially regarding price trends. Earlier this month, before spot bitcoin ETFs were approved, he said those funds are expected to attract inflows of $50-100 billion this year, and as a result, the bitcoin price could rise to $100,000 by the end of the year and $200000 by the end of 2025.\n\nThe $100,000 price prediction \"still looks achievable,\" Kendrick said in today's report, adding that expected steady inflows in spot bitcoin ETFs will gradually raise the bitcoin price.\n\nBitcoin price declined after spot bitcoin ETF approvals, mainly due to outflows from Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), but has since bounced back and is currently trading at around $43,540.\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nKendrick said ether is less susceptible to the post-approval selling that bitcoin saw. \"The key reason for this is that the Grayscale Ethereum Trust has a smaller share of total ETH market cap than GBTC did before approval of BTC ETFs; and within that, FTX holdings are even lower,\" he noted.\n\nEthereum ETFs that include staking yields to be approved later\n\nOn May 23, Kendrick only expects simple Ethereum ETFs that replicate ether price movements to get approved, while ETFs that include staking yield rewards may be introduced later, he said.\n\n\"Both types exist in Europe; AETH [21Shares Ethereum Staking ETP] is the largest ETF that includes staking yield rewards. However, given that AETH has higher fees than ETH, staking rewards are offset by fees,\" he said.\n\nKendrick also commented on Ethereum's upcoming Dencun or Proto-Danksharding upgrade and said it would benefit the ether price. \"Overall, this upgrade should see more value captured within the ETH ecosystem as lower Layer 2 fees make ETH more competitive, and slower staking should keep staking rewards higher for longer. Both of these are positive for ETH prices,\" he concluded.\n\nAs a whole, crypto experts have been both optimistic and pessimistic that a spot ether ETF approval is on the horizon."

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s Nethermind client software saw a bug that pulled validators offline for four hours last week, raising concerns in the Ethereum community about client centralization.\n\nEthereum clients are software that enable users to interact with the blockchain, allowing them to send transactions and run smart contracts, for example.\n\nWhen a minority client shuts down, the penalty often involves losing ether. However, in this case, Nethermind going offline has also sparked similar concerns around what would happen if Geth, Ethereum\u2019s most popular execution client, failed as well.\n\nRead more: Coinbase confronts client diversity risk following Nethermind bug\n\nLast week, it was estimated that 84% of validators used Geth, meaning that Ethereum itself would not finalize if Geth were to go offline.\n\nMark Mackey, an Ethereum Core Developer at Sigma Prime, noted in a post on X that the reason Geth has become one of the most popular execution clients is correlated with its early mover advantage.\n\n\u201cBack in the day, we used to have 2 clients: Geth and Parity. They were roughly equal in their usage,\u201d Mackey wrote. \u201cBut then an exploit in the Parity wallet froze [500,000] ETH forever, including the vast majority of funds that were raised for the development of Polkadot.\u201d\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nAfter Gavin Wood, the founder and CEO of Parity, decided to pull the plug on developing the execution client following the Parity wallet exploit, Geth became the only viable option, Mackey wrote.\n\nIn the aftermath of the recent Nethermind bug, a renewed interest in execution clients has arisen and crypto community members are now calling for client diversification.\n\nOne of the most prominent companies to respond to client diversification concerns was Coinbase Cloud, whose nodes currently solely rely on Geth.\n\nThe company noted that although Geth is the only execution layer software client that meets its technical requirements, it is also looking into other client execution layers for alternative options, with further details to be expected in February.\n\nCoinbase Cloud is not the only team to have looked into diversifying its execution client. Allnodes shared in a recent post on X that it had fully transitioned to Besu, noting that not a single one of its 23,895 validators is on Geth anymore.\n\nP2P, another proof-of-stake validator and RPC node provider, had also transitioned to using Besu. It noted in an X post that \u201cwe believe that together with the rest of the community, we can reduce GETH usage to below 66%.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Aave-Chan, a delegate platform, noted that it would be switching minority EL clients for all its ETH nodes.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t be diversity maxi without putting our money where our mouth is,\u201d wrote Marc Zeller, founder of the Aave-Chan Initiative.\n\nA week following calls for client diversification, there are \u2014 as of today \u2014 an estimated 78% of validators using Geth, meaning that in just a week, around 6% of node operators had switched their execution client.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

Additionally, ETH\u2019s presence as a regulated futures contract on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange bolsters the likelihood of approval.\n\nKendrick\u2019s predictions extend beyond mere approval, suggesting a potential spike in Ethereum\u2019s price to $4,000, akin to Bitcoin\u2019s price performance prior to its ETF approval. He noted:\n\n\u201cIf ETH prices perform similarly to how BTC prices performed in the lead-up to BTC ETF approval, ETH could trade as high as $4,000 by then.\u201d\n\nEthereum ETFs\n\nThe potential for Ethereum ETFs isn\u2019t without its nuances. Kendrick anticipates the initial approvals to focus on simple Ethereum ETFs that track the price movements of ETH. He predicted that more complex offerings, such as ETFs incorporating staking yield rewards, may emerge later, drawing on European models as a reference.\n\nFurthermore, Kendrick comments on Ethereum\u2019s impending network upgrades, like Dencun or Proto-Danksharding, viewing them as beneficial for price growth. These upgrades will enhance the Ethereum ecosystem\u2019s value retention by reducing Layer 2 fees and maintaining higher staking rewards.\n\nKendrick also maintained a positive view of the broader cryptocurrency market, including Bitcoin. His earlier projections anticipated a surge in the flagship cryptocurrency\u2019s price to $100,000 by year-end and a staggering $200,000 by the close of 2025, driven by inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs."

        "content": "Standard Chartered: Ethereum Spot ETFs Likely To Be Approved by May 2024\n\nStandard Chartered has projected that Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) will be approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and potentially double the current price of ETH, according to a report by the British multinational bank on Tuesday.\n\nStandard Chartered expressed confidence that spot ETH ETFs will receive the green light from the SEC by the final deadline on May 23, citing the fact that the regulator has not classified ETH as a security. This is in contrast to the SEC's crackdown on crypto companies selling unregistered securities. The Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), on the other hand, has consistently classified ETH as a commodity, an asset that can be bought and sold.\n\nStandard Chartered expects that the approval of spot ETH ETFs will lead to a surge in the value of ETH, with the cryptocurrency potentially reaching $4,000. ETH is currently priced at $2,332, according to CoinMarketCap\u2019s data. Several high-profile asset management firms, including BlackRock, have submitted their applications for spot ETH ETFs.\n\nStandard Chartered also maintained its bullish outlook on Bitcoin, reiterating its prediction that BTC could reach $100,000 per coin by the end of 2024. Geoffrey Kendrick, head of Standard Chartered Bank's forex and digital assets research, stated that this price range \"still looks achievable.\""

You might be familiar with names ending in .eth. These are ENS\u2019s original implementation that is akin to domain names for wallet address. Instead of remembering a long wallet address, people could use a .eth name instead. It\u2019s similar to how DNS-based domain names replace IP addresses.\n\nPeople could use real domain names in place of .eth domains for a while, but setting it up (or making changes) could be costly because of Ethereum gas fees that could be as high as 0.5 ETH.\n\nNow, a new smart contract eliminates the need for a large amount of DNSSEC proof needed to be saved to the Ethereum blockchain. Essentially, it will allow DNS records to be verified via an off-chain gateway and eliminate the gas fee.\n\nThis means you can use your real domain names in the ENS ecosystem for free.\n\nDomain name owners will need to enable DNSSEC and add a TXT record, but will no longer have to pay gas fees."

        "content": "TD Cowen\u2019s Washington Research Group predicted that spot Ethereum ETFs will not gain approval this year, according to Kitco on Jan. 29.\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) must soon decide on proposed rule changes that would allow spot Ethereum ETFs to be listed and traded on securities exchanges. TD Cowen argued that approval is unlikely, stating:\n\n\u201c[The SEC] can eventually reject the rule change, which either will lead to a new application or litigation \u2026 Either will take another year or two to play out.\u201d\n\nIn that event, any possible spot Ethereum ETF approval is unlikely to occur until late 2025 or early 2026, the research group said.\n\nThe SEC must reach a decision on VanEck\u2019s spot Ethereum ETF application by May 23 but is not required to approve the fund. The securities agency is expected to reach a decision on similar applications at the same time.\n\nOther sources are divided on whether a May approval is likely. One Polymarket prediction market suggests 47% odds of approval, while one JP Morgan executive has suggested a 50% chance of approval. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart is slightly more optimistic and has predicted a 60% chance of approval.\n\nPolitical factors are at play\n\nTD Cowen said that its low approval expectations are based on partisan attitudes toward cryptocurrency. The research group wrote:\n\n\u201cThis is a political call. We believe there is no upside for SEC Chair Gary Gensler to approve a spot Ethereum ETF given how upset progressive Democrats were over the agency\u2019s approval of a spot bitcoin ETF earlier this month.\u201d\n\nTD Cowen noted that SEC Chair Gary Gensler, a Democrat, needs support from progressives in order to advance his agenda or potentially obtain a different government position in the event that U.S. President Joe Biden wins a second term. It suggested that approving a spot ETF would involve a \u201cneedless fight\u201d and that Gensler is likely in \u201cno hurry\u201d to approve such a fund.\n\nDemocrats broadly opposed the earlier approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, as TD Cowen observed. Within the SEC, two Democratic commissioners voted against the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF while two Republicans voted in favor of approval. Gensler voted in favor of approval in spite of his Democratic party membership and his broader concerns about cryptocurrency.\n\nOutside of the SEC, Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren expressed complaints about the decision to approve a spot Bitcoin ETF on Jan. 12."

        "content": "Although the digital asset industry is a relatively new creation in the grand scheme of technology, it is noted for its rapid progression. Subsequently, its presence requires a steep learning curve for many entering the field. Therefore, this guide is going to share some insight into how to bridge Ethereum (ETH) to Solana.\n\nThe process of bridging your digital assets has become increasingly necessary in the vast marketplace. Different networks and cryptocurrencies all coexist within the sector and necessitate the understanding of how to work alongside the technology parameters that exist today.\n\nBoth Ethereum and Solana represent two of the most popular digital assets present in the marketplace today. However, due to compatibility restraints, it is important to know how to bridge different assets from one network to the other.\n\nThis guide is going to delve a bit deeper into the role that bridges play in the current digital asset landscape. Moreover, it is going to explore the best way to approach bridging Ethereum to Solana in a way that will hopefully equip and empower newfound and seasoned traders alike.\n\nWhat is Bridging?\n\nAlso Read: How to Bridge to Fantom?\n\nNow, before we get to specifics regarding a bridge from ETH to Solana, it is crucial to start at the beginning. For new traders, the idea of bridging assets from different networks may be a little bit confusing. So, let\u2019s discuss a little bit about the process, what it entails, and why it\u2019s important.\n\nBridges in the cryptocurrency sector are the foundation of cross-chain maneuvering for investors. As the title explains, a bridge allows a pathway for both assets and necessary information to travel from one chain to another.\n\nThis becomes necessary when one user is seeking to use bridges to allow one network to interact with another. For the case of this guide, a bridge is necessary to transfer assets from the Ethereum network to Soolana.\n\nAlso Read: How To Bridge to Avalanche?\n\nA bridge will ensure that assets can move between differing blockchains that may not otherwise be compatible. however, it is important to note that the actual bridge being used by the individual to trade is subject to change depending on who is transferring, and other factors.\n\nYet, most all bridges, work through the locking of assets on what is called the source chain, or the starting network. then, it will mint assets equivalent to that total on the destination chain, or the network you are transferring to. This way, you can maintain the value across the process.\n\nNow that we know a bit more about bridges in cryptocurrency, let\u2019s delve into how to bridge ETH to Solana\n\nHow to Bridge ETH to Solana?\n\nSource: Blockworks\n\nAlso Read: How to Bridge Polygon to Solana?\n\nNow, to begin a bridge from Ethereum to Solana, it starts with selecting what bridge is right for you. As previously mentioned, this is a process that is one only you can truly know. For this example, we are going to be divulging the bridging process using Portal Bridge.\n\nNow, when it comes to bridging these two blockchains, it can be presented in four rather simple steps. First, you are going to need to open Portal Bridge. Within this step, you are going to want to connect your supported wallet. This can be anything from MetaMask to Phantom, depending on whichever you have.\n\nSecondly, you will want to select \u2018Ethereum Mainnet\u2019 as the source chain. This is the vital starting point because that is where the assets are being transferred from. Moreover, in this step, you will want to select \u2018Solana\u2019 as the destination chain.\n\nThirdly, you will want to select Ethereum (ETH) as the token you wish to bridge. This is another simple step that is also crucial to the process. Within this step, you will also have to specify the amount that you want to transfer across chains. After that is inputted, you will select the \u2018Next\u2019 button.\n\nFinally, you are going to want to make note of instructions that will arrive on your wallet interface. Specifically, you will need to complete these to facilitate the bridge which should be rather quick and secure.\n\nRemember, that fees will be a part of the bridging process. However, the specifics of those fees will be dependent on various factors. Starting from Ethereum will likely make fees start at around $20. Moreover, using Portal Bridge will make transaction fees rather low. Specifically, they should be around $0.0001 per transfer."

Indeed, they predict that the approval could come on May 23rd, according to a report from The Block.\n\nAdditionally, Standard Chartered has forecasted a $4,000 target for Ethereum if approval is granted. Specifically, it notes that the potential value surge if the asset could mimic what occurred with Bitcoin (BTC) before its Spot ETF approval in the United States. Overall, the bank said that the process for Ethereum\u2019s ETF approval will mirror Bitcoin\u2019s journey at the tail end of last year.\n\nAlso Read: SEC Delays BlackRock Spot Ethereum ETF\n\nStandard Chartered Bank Predicts Spot Ethereum ETF Approval in May\n\nThe digital asset industry experienced a landmark development just ten days into the new year. After months of speculation, the SEC greenlit the creation of 11 Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States. Naturally, that approval led many market participants to ask what next. What other asset could receive the same coveted approval that BTC had witnessed?\n\nWell, according to one prominent bank, Ethereum could well be on its way. Specifically, the SEC is predicted to approve Spot Ethereum ETFs in May, according to Standard Chartered Bank.\n\n\u201cWe expect pending applications or ETH US spot ETFs to be approved on May 23, the final deadline for the first of the ETFs under consideration- the equivalent date to Jan. 10 for BTC ETFs,\u201d says Geoffrey Kendrick, the head of Standard Chartered Banks foret and digital assets research.\n\nSource: CNBC\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum: BlackRock CEO Larry Fink Sees Value in ETH ETF\n\nMoreover, Kendrick noted that ETH could follow a similar pre-approval trajectory that Bitcoin enjoyed. Although BTC has failed to surge in value since approvals were issued, the expectation of such approval had a massive impact on its price. Subsequently, Kendrick predicts that Ethereum \u201ccould trade as high as $4,000\u201d by the approval time.\n\nKendrick expects approvals because the SEC has not categorized ETH as a security in its legal actions against digital asset firms. Moreover, ETH is listed as a regulated futures contract on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Therefore, increasing the potential for approval.\n\nAdditionally, Kendrick notes that Grayscale is seeking to convert its ETH trust into an ETF. Subsequently, a denial of that application will \u201clikely lead to another appeal by Grayscale.\u201d Ultimately, Kendrick said they \u201csee no fundamental reason,\u201d the SEC and the CME would view Ethereum differently."

        "title": "Why Solana Beats Ethereum In This Bull Cycle: Crypto Expert - NewsBTC",
        "content": "In a recent analysis, Andrew Kang, co-founder and partner of Mechanism Capital, provided a comprehensive analysis of the cryptocurrency market, focusing on the comparative strengths of Solana (SOL) over Ethereum (ETH) in the current bull cycle. Kang shared his insights via X, the platform formerly known as Twitter.\n\nCentral to Kang\u2019s argument is the idea that in the current market, Solana presents a more favorable trading option than Ethereum. He states, \u201cThe definition of insanity is repeatedly trying to long ETHBTC when longing SOLBTC (or SOLETH) is the much better trade in a bullish environment.\u201d This succinctly captures his perspective on the shifting dynamics between these major cryptocurrencies.\n\nWhy Solana Is The Superior Trade Than Ethereum\n\nKang offers a retrospective view of Ethereum\u2019s journey, noting, \u201cOver the first 6-7 years of ETH\u2019s life, there was a lot of uncertainty and lack of education around ETH. There were a lot of Bitcoin holders to be converted to Ethereum holders.\u201d He recognizes Ethereum\u2019s early volatility and its eventual emergence as a stable trading asset.\n\nHowever, he suggests that this relative stability has now become a double-edged sword: \u201cETH also became a \u2018safe\u2019 risk-on asset that traders could get into in size. That\u2019s what made it a great cross to trade. But over time, people\u2019s allocation to eth vs btc started to harden and the amount of people left to convert whittled away.\u201d\n\nAddressing Ethereum\u2019s advancements in technology, Kang points out a paradox. He states, \u201cWhile these [Layer 2 solutions and Modular technology] might seem like good things, it is these characteristics/innovations that weighs heavy on ETH during risk on periods where ETH previously outperformed.\u201d He suggests that these developments, though innovative, have introduced new complexities that impact Ethereum\u2019s performance in bull markets.\n\n\u201cYes, you may have some conversion from BTC to ETH during risk on periods (much less so these days), but in this era ETH faces much more rotational pressure from those going from ETH as their base asset to these very L2s, modularity coins, SOL, those capitulating ETHBTC longs, and other shitcoins that it is supposed to benefit from,\u201d Kang claimed.\n\nIn contrast, the crypto expert highlights Solana\u2019s advantages, asserting, \u201cNot only does SOL not face these same issues but it also has crossed the chasm in becoming a blue-chip Layer 1.\u201d He emphasizes Solana\u2019s resilience and its appeal to conservative investors who previously focused mainly on Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nKang further elucidates, \u201cConservative giants that previously were comfortable with BTC and ETH have SOL as an easy, safe next step. It is this transition phase of becoming a new major or base asset that you want to ride. A young fast horse, not a horse encumbered by the troubles of age, baggage and Jared Gray.\u201d\n\nSignificantly, Kang notes a major shift in market dynamics, stating, \u201cThere was a secular shift in the collapse of ETHBTC volatility in 2023.\u201d He posits that this shift has redefined the comparative advantage in favor of Solana. Concluding his analysis, Kang confidently asserts, \u201cEven if that ever changes, SOLBTC will be the superior trade.\u201d\n\nAt press time, SOL was just 30% short of a new all-time high against ETH.\n\nFeatured image from securities.io, chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nTake a look at the most important crypto events with U.Today's top three news stories.\n\nEthereum's Vitalik Buterin makes surprising visit to Binance\n\nAs has been recently shared by Binance CEO Richard Teng on the X platform, Ethereum cofounder Vitalik Buterin made a surprising visit to the Binance office. Teng thanked Buterin for finding time to speak to his team in person, saying that it was a privilege to have him in the company's office. This spontaneous visit caused quite a stir in the crypto community, with many users speculating about a potential collaboration between these two giants of the crypto market. As a reminder, Binance is currently struggling with a $4 billion fine and ongoing regulatory challenges; considering this, Buterin's focus (described in his essay entitled \"Make Ethereum Cypherpunk Again\") on security, privacy and scalability, and concern for centralized exchanges and their vulnerability to hacking, feed rumors about possible cooperation between Buterin and Binance. However, neither Buterin nor Teng made any statements in this regard.\n\nShibarium: Thousands of projects to join L2 network with numerous partnerships \u2013 SHIB rep\n\nIn a recent X post, Shiba Inu team member Lucie shared Shibarium's plans for the future . Lucie wrote that the layer-2 solution aims to \"onboard 1,000 projects with numerous partnerships,\" reminding the community that supporting new projects does not necessarily mean canceling existing ones. The SHIB representative then called on all meme token supporters to stay strong as a community during challenging times, stating that there is hardly any point in giving up now if they got \"this far\" in their support for the project's team. Lucie's post has evoked mixed reactions among SHIB army members; even though many of them praised the SHIB developers, some users questioned the project team's ability to accomplish anything more than just making plans and promising new advances.\n\nJPMorgan: Bitcoin ETF hype cooling"

        "content": "Ethereum could reach $4,000 ahead of a likely spot ETF approval in May, Standard Chartered wrote.\n\nThe SEC will probably handle the funds' approval similarly to how the bitcoin spot ETF was approached.\n\nBut unlike bitcoin, ethereum is less at risk of price downside after the ETFs' launch.\n\nNEW LOOK Sign up to get the inside scoop on today\u2019s biggest stories in markets, tech, and business \u2014 delivered daily.

You can opt-out at any time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEthereum's price could hit $4,000 before late May, if the token is able to secure its own spot exchange traded fund, Standard Chartered said on Tuesday.\n\nHead of FX Research Geoff Kendrick wrote in a note that this will likely happen, marking a 70% price upside from ethereum's current value.\n\n\"We expect pending applications for ETH US spot ETFs to be approved on 23 May, the final deadline for the first of the ETFs under consideration \u2014 the equivalent date to 10 January for BTC ETFs,\" he said.\n\nKendrick forecasts that the process will look similar to how the Securities and Exchange Commission handled the recent bitcoin spot ETF applications, which eventually led to the launch of 11 funds after months of regulatory pushback.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn theory, ethereum should follow bitcoin's performance in the run-up to the ETFs' approval. Originally, SEC delays first caused bitcoin to flatline, before Grayscale's court victory against the regulator sent the apex token rallying at the end of 2023.\n\nEthereum has already risen around 19% since Blackrock filed for an ETF on November 16. But that's a modest gain compared to what Kendrick says could happen in May, the final deadline date for VanEck and Ark21Shares' applications.\n\nStill, to reach the $4,000 price target, some conditions will have to be met.\n\nExpectations for the approval will have to be low, as happened ahead of the bitcoin ETF launch, Kendrick said. Market-side implications for an approval will also have to miss the mark \u2014 though some may worry that the SEC's stance that ethereum should be treated as a security could get in the way, the commission has already lost that argument in court, Kendrick outlined.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFinally, a number of ETFs must be approved at the May deadline for ethereum to enjoy a boost.\n\nWhile the crypto's pre-ETF price action should resemble that of bitcoin, it's a different story once the funds are active.\n\nThough bitcoin jumped to an intra-day high of $49,000 on the ETFs' approval, it has since slid 6.7%. The surprising downside stems from massive outflows from Grayscale's fund, which previously functioned as a bitcoin trust.\n\nBut the Grayscale Ethereum Trust accounts for a much smaller market cap of the crypto than the bitcoin fund did.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Grayscale ETH Trust's current market cap of USD 6bn is 2.2% of total ETH market cap, whereas the comparable share for BTC was 3.1% at the time of the ETF approval,\" Kendrick wrote.\n\nAnd while the failed crypto exchange FTX led the Grayscale bitcoin selloff, its holdings in the Ethereum Trust amount to just 0.05% of the token's market cap."

        "content": "The bank\u2019s report also predicted ETH could hit $4,000 in the lead-up to an approval.\n\nStandard Chartered Bank is eyeing May 23 as the date for the Securities and Exchange Commission to approve spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds, according to a report shared with the bank\u2019s clients and reviewed by Unchained.\n\nThe Block first reported the news.\n\nThe SEC is likely to take a strategy similar to the one it took for approving spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, according to the report. If approved, Ethereum ETFs would be the second domino to fall after the long-awaited approval of Bitcoin ETFs on Jan. 10, and be a boon for an industry that has undergone a prolonged bearish period.\n\nRead more: SEC Delays Decision on BlackRock\u2019s Spot Ethereum ETF\n\nUnder a section of the report entitled \u201cHistory doesn\u2019t repeat itself, but it often rhymes,\u201d Geoffrey Kendrick, head of Standard Chartered Bank\u2019s crypto research, wrote that he expects \u201cpending applications for ETH U.S. spot ETFs to be approved on May 23, the final deadline for the first of the ETFs under consideration \u2014 the equivalent date to Jan. 10 for BTC ETFs.\u201d\n\nKendrick noted that if Ether follows how Bitcoin performed in the lead-up to its ETF approval, its price could hit $4,000 by late May. Ether is currently trading at around $2,370, according to CoinGecko.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t comment on individual filings,\u201d said an SEC spokesperson when asked for comment. \u201cBroadly speaking, if the Commission declares a registration statement effective, that is reflected on EDGAR. Any Commission 19b-4 orders will be posted on our website and then published in the Federal Register.\u201d\n\nStill, the SEC postponing decisions on two ETH ETFs (BlackRock and Fidelity) on Jan. 24 follows the same pattern as its deliberative process when it came to Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nThe market doesn\u2019t seem to agree with Kendrick, however, with a wide range of opinions about whether Ethereum ETFs will even be approved at all.\n\n\u201cBased on market commentary, we believe approval expectations are relatively low, likely below 50%,\u201d wrote Kendrick. Yet, he believes the market is wrong in this case."

Pick one of the Ethereum online casinos from our list\n\nBegin by selecting a reputable Ethereum casino from a trusted source. Consider factors such as security, reputation, and game selection. Also, check user reviews to make an informed choice.\n\n2. Open an account\n\nVisit the chosen Ethereum casino's website and sign up for an account. Provide the required information, including a valid email address and a password. Some casinos may require additional verification steps to ensure security.\n\n3. Buy Ethereum\n\nTo fund your account, you'll need to purchase Ethereum. Use cryptocurrency exchanges such as Binance or Kraken to buy Ethereum.\n\nOf course, ETH isn\u2019t the only digital currency you can use. For instance, Binance Coin casinos are widely esteemed in the market. You should always take note of the different cryptocurrencies that you can use.\n\nIt's advisable to avoid platforms that may penalize gamblers. Follow the exchange's instructions to create an account.\n\nComplete the necessary verification process, and purchase Ethereum using fiat currency or other cryptos.\n\n4. Prepare your Ethereum\n\nOnce you have obtained Ethereum, it's important to store it in a secure wallet. Choose a non-custodial or hosted wallet that provides you with full control over your funds.\n\nPopular options include hardware wallets like Ledger or software wallets like MetaMask. Follow the wallet provider's instructions to set up and secure your Ethereum wallet.\n\n5. Check your account's deposit address\n\nIn your Ethereum casino account, navigate to the deposit section. You will find a unique deposit address, which is a cryptographic code or public key.\n\nDouble-check this address to ensure accuracy. Avoid sending funds to the wrong destination.\n\n6. Deposit and start playing\n\nTransfer the desired amount of Ethereum from your wallet to the provided address. Initiate the transaction from your wallet, following the prompts.\n\nOnce the ETH is successfully transferred, it will appear in your account balance. Next, you can start playing your favorite games.\n\n7. Withdraw your winnings\n\nIf you're fortunate enough to win, you can withdraw your winnings. Navigate to the withdrawal section of your casino account, and enter the desired amount.\n\nProvide the wallet address where you want to receive your Ethereum. Review the transaction details carefully, and confirm the request.\n\nThe Ethereum will be sent to your specified wallet address. You can manage it from there.\n\nHow To Select Your Ethereum Casino\n\nWhen you choose an Ethereum casino, there are several factors to consider. Let's explore each of these aspects in detail.\n\nAvailable payment systems and cryptos for deposit\n\nLook for Ethereum casinos that offer a wide range of payment methods. The emphasis should be on cryptocurrencies to deposit. The more options available, the better it is for you.\n\nLook for casinos that explicitly state their acceptance of Ethereum or cryptocurrencies. It's also a great feature if they support other cryptos like Bitcoin or Litecoin.\n\nAdditionally, consider sites that regularly add new currencies, as you might want to diversify your deposit options.\n\nYou should stick with casinos that accept fiat payment methods alongside cryptocurrencies. Ensure that the casino supports popular and reputable payment methods.\n\nThe list should include credit/debit cards, bank transfers, and e-wallets. A wide variety of payment options increases flexibility and convenience.\n\nWithdrawal speed and limits on Ethereum casinos\n\nEthereum transactions are known for their speed. However, some sites may introduce additional validation steps. This could delay your withdrawals.\n\nEnsure that the withdrawal speed offered by the casino is at least close to what ETH allows.\n\nAlso, check the withdrawal limits imposed by the Ethereum casino. This will ensure they align with your betting preferences and financial goals.\n\nAside from this, also assess the transaction fees associated with depositing Ethereum.\n\nSome casinos may charge additional fees for cryptocurrency deposits. In fact, this should be one of the main factors in your decision-making process.\n\nConsider casinos that offer competitive or low transaction fees, as this will maximize your betting budget.\n\nGames quality, variety, and exclusivity\n\nThe quality and variety of games available at an Ethereum casino are crucial factors. Look for casinos that offer a wide selection of high-quality games.\n\nThey should come from top software providers. Exclusive or proprietary games can also enhance your gaming experience, and give you unique offerings.\n\nLook for games from the leaders such as Microgaming and NetEnt. Other good options are Betsoft, Evolution, and Yggdrasil, among others.\n\nYou should also be aware of the Return to Player (RTP) percentage of specific games.\n\nStick with Ethereum casinos that welcome users from your country\n\nDifferent countries have varying laws and regulations regarding online gambling.\n\nYou should select an Ethereum casino that welcomes users from your country. This ensures compliance with local laws.\n\nYou can also mitigate legal risks and enjoy better protection of your information.\n\nETH casinos that cater to specific countries tailor their platforms to users\u2019 preferences. This can result in a more localized user experience, with relevant and varied language options, and better customer support availability during the day.\n\nIn addition, you can expect region-specific promotions or bonuses.\n\nYou should always pay close attention to the casino's terms and conditions, avoiding sites with unclear wording.\n\nReputation\n\nConsider the reputation of the Ethereum casino before making your choice. Look for casinos with robust security features and appropriate licenses.\n\nCuracao licensing is a standard in the crypto space, but be aware that it can be relatively easy to get.\n\nSearch for any complaints or feedback from players to gain insights into their experiences and the reliability of the site.\n\nEngage in thorough research by reading user reviews and ratings. Feedback from other users can provide valuable insights into the reliability and security.\n\nYou should pay particular attention to any positive or negative comments regarding payment systems and deposits.\n\nPromotions, bonuses, and VIP benefits on Ethereum casinos\n\nExamine the promotions and bonuses offered by the Ethereum casino. Look for welcome bonuses and deposit offers.\n\nYou also want to check VIP benefits, and other bonuses, including those specific to Ethereum. Understand the wagering requirements associated with these bonuses, and look for VIP benefits with bigger bonuses, free spins, or special gifts.\n\nAlso, make sure you consider what the casino offers in terms of rewards for loyal players. Here is a little more information about specific bonuses.\n\nWelcome bonuses\n\nThese are rewards for players and a way to attract them to join the platform. These bonuses usually come in the form of a percentage match on the initial deposit. This provides players with extra funds to explore the games.\n\nWelcome bonuses can boost your bankroll and increase your chances of winning.\n\nDeposit bonuses\n\nOffered to players who make subsequent deposits after the initial one. These bonuses can be structured as a match percentage or a fixed bonus.\n\nEthereum casinos run promotions where they match a certain percentage of a player's deposit so that you get more funds to play with. Deposit bonuses are a popular feature that allows players to extend their gameplay.\n\nFree spins\n\nMany Ethereum casinos offer free spins as part of their bonus packages. Free spins allow players to spin the reels of selected slot games. They provide an excellent opportunity to try out different slot titles.\n\nIn this way, you can potentially win real money without risking your own capital.\n\nNo deposit bonus\n\nSome Ethereum casinos offer no deposit bonuses that do not require a deposit. These bonuses are usually provided as a small amount of free funds. They can also be in the form of free spins upon registration.\n\nNo deposit bonuses give players a chance to explore the casino's offerings.\n\nCustomer support\n\nEvaluate the customer support provided by the Ethereum casino. Live chat support that responds promptly in your language is essential.\n\nThe support team should also be easy to find and efficient when it solves any queries. It\u2019s always helpful to test the support before making a deposit.\n\nFavor end-to-end Ethereum casinos\n\nIt is recommended to choose end-to-end Ethereum casinos, as they provide a complete crypto experience. These brands not only accept crypto deposits but also allow players to use their native currency.\n\nBe cautious of casinos that only accept crypto as a deposit method. They could convert the funds into another currency, and impose additional fees and spreads.\n\nBy considering these factors when selecting an Ethereum casino, you can make an informed decision. This will ensure an enjoyable and secure gambling experience.\n\nOur Review Process for ETH Casinos\n\nOur review process for Ethereum casinos involves the following step-by-step procedure.

Here are the reasons why you should choose ETH casinos today!\n\nGeo restrictions are a thing of the past\n\nIf you opt for an Ethereum casino, you definitely have fewer geo-restrictions. This is because it operates on a decentralized blockchain and is therefore accessible to players worldwide. This allows individuals from different regions to engage in online gambling activities.\n\nOn this note, it\u2019s important to underline that online gambling regulations vary from country to country. It is unwise to try and gamble in a country where online casinos play is banned.\n\nFaster transactions, higher limits\n\nWhen you pick an Ethereum casino, you can enjoy faster payments and higher limits. Ethereum speeds up transactions, so you can add or take out money faster than with other methods.\n\nWith Ethereum, there are no middlemen or third-party processors involved.\n\nIn addition, Ethereum casinos often allow higher limits. This means you have more flexibility and can bet larger amounts.\n\nEthereum's decentralized nature helps handle financial transactions efficiently. As a result, you have higher limits for deposits and withdrawals. This is useful if you like to bet big or need the freedom to manage your transactions.\n\nYour ETH balance could increase over time\n\nOn traditional online casinos, your winnings are paid out in fiat currency. On the other hand, Ethereum casinos allow you to gamble and accumulate Ethereum cryptocurrency.\n\nThe value of Ethereum has shown significant growth over the years. This makes it a possibly promising investment.\n\nThen, when you gamble with Ethereum, you can win prizes and also profit from the growth in value of your Ethereum holdings.\n\nYet don\u2019t forget that when you use Ethereum for gambling, the value of your balance can rise or fall. It will depend on the market price of Ethereum.\n\nIf the price of Ethereum increases, your balance could also increase. As a result, you can get additional gains.\n\nBut it's important to note that this applies to Ethereum and not stablecoins because these maintain a stable value by following major currencies.\n\nEthereum casinos give you higher privacy and anonymity\n\nPlaying on Ethereum casinos offers the advantage of higher privacy and anonymity. This is certainly superior to what you find with traditional online casinos.\n\nWhen you engage in gambling activities at Ethereum casinos, you can enjoy a greater level of privacy. Indeed, your personal information is not directly linked to your transactions.\n\nInstead of providing sensitive personal details, you can use your Ethereum wallet address.\n\nAnonymous casinos provide an added layer of security so that your identity and financial information are safe from breaches or misuse.\n\nNo bank involvement\n\nBy leveraging the power of blockchain technology, Ethereum casinos offer a more private experience.\n\nAs a result, when you play at Ethereum casinos, your bank or financial partner won't know about it. Ethereum transactions are pseudonymous, and your protection is huge.\n\nWith these platforms, you have a level of anonymity that isn\u2019t possible with traditional banking methods.\n\nCutting-edge sites\n\nEthereum casinos are often at the forefront of innovation. Not only do they take full advantage of blockchain technology to create immersive experiences, but also provide seamless user journeys and visually appealing interfaces.\n\nEthereum casinos are well-made and high-tech, so you can have a good time while playing.\n\nThey also offer a better user experience and modern designs. Aside from this, their interfaces are usually mobile-friendly. All these benefits enhance convenience and accessibility for players.\n\nSome Ethereum casinos even offer dedicated mobile apps, making them similar to the top real-money mobile casinos. This makes it possible to access your favorite games on the go.\n\nThe emphasis on innovation and user-centric design ensures that you have an engaging experience.\n\nCrypto or fiat?\n\nCrypto offers a decentralized and transparent financial system that operates independently of traditional banking institutions.\n\nChoosing Ethereum allows you to embrace the world of cryptocurrencies over traditional currencies.\n\nCrypto is considered cool and new, with many enthusiasts finding the concept and technology behind cryptocurrencies exciting. You too can now become part of this growing community.\n\nCrypto gives autonomy\n\nWith Ethereum, you don't need permission from any central authority. It's a decentralized system that empowers individuals with control over their money.\n\nYou can transact freely and securely, without relying on third parties. As a result, you enjoy the freedom in managing your finances.\n\nThe Cons of Using Ethereum Casinos\n\nWhile Ethereum casinos offer numerous advantages, it's important to consider the potential disadvantages. Let's explore these drawbacks in detail.\n\nA largely unregulated sector\n\nThe Ethereum casino industry operates in a legal gray zone due to the absence of regulation. Obtaining a Curacao license is common and easy.\n\nHowever, it may not provide the same level of protection as stricter regulatory bodies. Trust in an Ethereum casino often relies on its historical reputation within the crypto space.\n\nOne of the main concerns with a largely unregulated sector is the potential for fraud and scams. Without proper regulation, it becomes easier for malicious actors to create fake casinos or crypto bookmakers.\n\nThey can also manipulate the outcomes of bets. This can lead to individuals losing their hard-earned money without any legal protection.\n\nA lack of recourse\n\nThere is also no standardized system for dispute resolution. If a user has an issue with a bet or a payout, there is no governing body or regulatory authority to turn to for assistance.\n\nThis lack of accountability can result in frustration and financial loss.\n\nAnother drawback is the risk of money laundering and illegal activities. In an unregulated environment, it becomes easier for individuals to use ETH and launder money.\n\nThe lack of KYC (Know Your Customer) protocols and identity verification makes this issue worse.\n\nTransfers irreversibility\n\nEthereum transactions are processed quickly, with low fees. Sometimes, you won\u2019t face any limits. However, one of the downsides is the irreversibility of these transactions.\n\nIt is crucial to be extremely cautious when using a deposit address. Even a small error can result in sending your Ethereum to the wrong recipient. This means that you won\u2019t be able to recover your funds.\n\nThis lack of reversibility increases the importance of due diligence and caution. Be aware that errors or fraudulent activities can result in permanent losses.\n\nLess help if you have issues\n\nSince Ethereum casinos operate outside the traditional banking system, you need to do your research carefully to choose trustworthy Ethereum casinos.\n\nReliable brands are so crucial to play on because they always prioritize customer support and fair play.\n\nAnother point to consider is that in traditional casinos, regulatory bodies enforce responsible gambling practices. They also ensure that operators adhere to strict guidelines.\n\nHowever, in the unregulated Ethereum casino, there are no such mechanisms. This could make players more vulnerable.\n\nKnowing how to use Ethereum\n\nIf you decide to play on an Ethereum casino, you need to be familiar with crypto. For instance, it\u2019s vital to know how to create and manage an Ethereum wallet and interact with smart contracts.\n\nYou\u2019ll also need to learn how to navigate decentralized applications. This technical expertise could be a challenge for individuals new to crypto.\n\nUsers should also be aware of gas fees; that is, transaction fees paid to miners for processing transactions on the network.\n\nThe fluctuating nature of gas fees can impact the overall cost of casino betting. This is why users have to stay informed and adjust their strategies accordingly.\n\nVolatility of ETH value\n\nBeing a cryptocurrency, Ethereum can fluctuate in price, which could have a direct impact on the value of bets and payouts.\n\nThe unpredictable nature of ETH's value introduces an element of risk. This is not a great thing for individuals looking for stable betting environments.\n\nThis volatility of ETH value could eventually affect the profitability of casino and crypto sports betting platforms, as operators of Ethereum betting platforms need to account for the fluctuations in ETH price.\n\nThis is especially the case when determining the odds and setting the payout ratios.\n\nWhat Sorts of Games Are Available on Ethereum Casinos?\n\nEthereum casinos offer a wide variety of games to cater to different preferences and interests. Here are some of the popular game categories you can find on Ethereum casino.s\n\nETH casino classics\n\nEthereum casinos feature classic casino games that have been enjoyed by players for decades.\n\nThese include card games like crypto blackjack and baccarat. Players can test their skills and strategies as they aim to beat the dealer.\n\nOne of the most popular classic games is blackjack. This card game of skill and strategy challenges players to beat the dealer. They need to get a hand value as close to 21.\n\nEthereum blackjack offers the same thrilling gameplay as its traditional counterpart. However, you\u2019ll enjoy added benefits such as secure transactions and transparent gameplay\u2026\n\nOther \u201cclassics\u201d include roulette, slots, and video poker.\n\nLive casino games with Ethereum\n\nEthereum casinos also offer live casino games. They provide a captivating and authentic gaming experience.\n\nPlayers can engage in real-time gameplay with professional dealers, and also have the chance to interact with other participants.\n\nNotable providers such as Evolution Gaming and Pragmatic Play offer high-quality live casino games. Some of them are live blackjack, live roulette, live baccarat, and live poker.\n\nThese games are hosted by professional dealers who conduct the gameplay. The action happens in real-time through high-quality video streaming.\n\nLive games feature various betting options and table limits and cater to players of different preferences. The availability of live games with Ethereum ensures that you can find your favorite titles.\n\nEthereum Crash games\n\nCrash games have gained popularity in the Ethereum casino space. It's a thrilling and fast-paced game that offers the opportunity for big winnings.\n\nIn Ethereum Crash Games players bet on the \"crash point\" of a rising multiplier. The multiplier starts at a certain value and continues to rise until it suddenly crashes.\n\nThe goal is to predict the point at which the multiplier will crash. You have to cash out your bet before it happens.\n\nOne benefit of Ethereum Crash gambling is the potential for substantial winnings. As the multiplier continues to rise, so do the potential rewards.\n\nOther provably fair games\n\nEthereum casinos often feature provably fair games. They use blockchain technology to ensure transparency. These games include Mines, Plinko, Dice, Hi-Lo, and others.\n\nPlayers can verify the integrity of the game outcomes. They can enjoy the excitement of these provably fair options.\n\nWhat Is the #1 Exchange for Ethereum Casinos?\n\nChoosing an exchange for Ethereum casinos requires considering several factors. Some of them are reliability, security, and fees. While there are several exchanges available, we recommend Binance as the top choice.\n\nBinance is a widely recognized and reputable exchange. It comes with a user-friendly platform and a range of features.\n\nIt has established itself as a trusted platform in the crypto space. Binance has a strong track record in terms of security and reliability.\n\nOne of the pros of using Binance for casino Ethereum is the competitive fee structure. Binance offers relatively low transaction fees.\n\nThis allows users to maximize their funds for crypto gambling purposes. It could be beneficial for frequent gamblers who want to minimize costs.\n\nAnother significant advantage of Binance is that it welcomes gamblers. This is crucial to note, as some exchanges may freeze accounts if they are used for gambling transactions.\n\nHowever, Binance has a more open approach and does not penalize users.\n\nBenefits and Drawbacks of Using Ethereum on Casinos\n\nEthereum is a decentralized blockchain platform that has its own native cryptocurrency called Ether (ETH). This is the primary method of value exchange within the ETH ecosystem.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at the pros and cons of using it for online gambling.\n\nPros of using Ethereum on online casinos\n\nHere are a few reasons why gamblers can\u2019t get enough of ETH:\n\nFast and secure transactions: Ethereum offers fast and secure transactions and allows quick deposits and withdrawals on casinos that accept it.

        "content": "Bitcoin and Ethereum Price Prediction as BTC Spikes Up 10% and ETH Approaches $2,500 \u2013 Time to Buy?\n\nAmidst a rally that has seen Bitcoin (BTC) spike over 10%, crossing the $43,000 threshold, and Ethereum (ETH) approach the $2,500 mark, the crypto market is riding a wave of bullish momentum. This surge sparks an intense focus on Bitcoin and Ethereum price predictions as investors gauge the sustainability of this uptrend.\n\nThis remarkable uptrend is partly fueled by Grayscale\u2019s decreased Bitcoin sales, injecting a wave of optimism among investors and contributing to the positive market sentiment.\n\nAdditionally, the buoyant performance of the US stock market and Google\u2019s renewed acceptance of Bitcoin ads have further bolstered BTC prices.\n\n#Bitcoin pump as market await Fed #rate verdict. If #btc fails to break this trend line to the upside, this could be a trap. pic.twitter.com/dcS0qQwQJA \u2014 Nelson Julius (@hbdherculean) January 30, 2024\n\nHowever, with the upcoming US Federal Reserve meeting casting a shadow of uncertainty, investors are on edge.\n\nThe meeting\u2019s outcome, along with the January job numbers, could significantly impact Bitcoin and Ethereum price predictions, making this a critical moment for potential buyers and the broader cryptocurrency landscape.\n\nBitcoin Price Rises as Whales Gain Confidence\n\n\n\nThe global digital asset industry witnessed a brief surge as Bitcoin reclaimed the $43k level, leading to a 2% increase in the total market cap to $1.66 trillion within 24 hours.\n\nDespite a temporary drop to $38k, Bitcoin whales showed confidence by accumulating more BTC, with 67 new entities now holding 1,000 BTC or more, indicating a 4.50% increase in two weeks.\n\nThis surge positions Bitcoin for its fifth consecutive monthly gain, marking the longest streak since the pandemic-era rally. The recent boost is attributed to the launch of US spot Bitcoin ETFs by BlackRock and Fidelity, contributing to positive market sentiment.\n\nBITCOIN WHALES ACCUMULATED $3 BILLION IN JANUARY, SURPASSING ETF INFLOWS Bitcoin whale wallets holding >1,000 BTC have amassed a staggering $3 billion worth of BTC in January.

This is a big deal because it means companies like VanEck and BlackRock can now reach more people through Google, increasing awareness and attracting more investors.\n\nThis move shows that cryptocurrencies are gaining acceptance in finance. However, there are risks, like scams. Google says they\u2019ll enforce rules globally to prevent misuse.\n\nAll in all, Google allowing Bitcoin ETF ads is a major step in making cryptocurrencies more mainstream, but everyone should stay informed and careful in this evolving market.\n\nGM!\u2600\ufe0f#Bitcoin ETF ads are live on Google!

Currently, Bitcoin trades narrowly above its pivot point, marked by the green line at $42,491. This level serves as a fulcrum for the price action, with immediate resistance waiting at $42,710. Beyond that, the subsequent resistance levels are charted at $42,989 and $43,769, potentially capping upward movements. Conversely, supports are arranged below, providing a safety net at $42,491, followed by more substantial floors at $41,675 and $40,586. These levels will be crucial if Bitcoin experiences a downturn. The RSI indicator, positioned at 65, suggests that the market is approaching overbought territory but not excessively so, hinting at a tempered bullish momentum. Ethereum Price Prediction Ethereum\u2019s price action, as of the latest four-hour chart snapshot, suggests a market in cautious ascent. The cryptocurrency is currently trading at $2,346.5, with the pivot point established at $2357.7, indicated by the green line. Resistance levels are delineated at $2,359.5, $2,423.1, and $2,477.2, each forming a potential ceiling for upward price movements. On the downside, immediate support is found at $2,286.3, with further cushions at $2,263.9 and the more definitive level at $2,240.6. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 57, suggesting a neutral to slightly bullish sentiment without veering into overbought territory. The 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $2,263.9 provides additional support, reinforcing the positive bias as the current price is hovering above this line. Observing Ethereum\u2019s chart patterns, we see a recent break above the 0.236 Fibonacci retracement level, typically a bullish sign. However, the proximity to the pivot point warrants vigilance, as a drop below could quickly shift the trend."

A new weekly high was formed near $2,327 and the price is now consolidating gains.\n\nIt is now trading above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2,234 swing low to the $2,327 high. Ethereum is also trading above $2,280 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nOn the upside, the first major resistance is near the $2,330 level. The next major resistance is near $2,350, above which the price might rise and test the $2,420 resistance. If the bulls push the price above the $2,420 resistance, they could aim for $2,450. A clear move above the $2,450 level might start a decent increase. In the stated case, the price could rise toward the $2,550 level.\n\nAnother Bearish Wave in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $2,330 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,300 level.\n\nThe next key support could be the $2,280 zone or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2,234 swing low to the $2,327 high. A daily close below the $2,280 support might start another major decline. In the stated case, Ether could test the $2,200 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,120 level.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bullish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now above the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $2,280\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $2,330\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "Analyst Anticipates Spot Ethereum ETF Approval by Late May as SEC Delays Decision on Fidelity\u2019s - ZyCrypto",
        "content": "Advertisement\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has postponed its decision on Fidelity\u2019s proposal for a spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) until March 5.\n\nAccording to a filing on Thursday, the SEC cited the need for additional time to evaluate the proposed rule change and the associated issues thoroughly. Fidelity had initially applied for the Fidelity Ethereum Fund in November, referencing a court ruling from the previous year that questioned the SEC\u2019s rationale for rejecting spot crypto ETFs while permitting futures-based products.\n\nNotably, the delay had been widely anticipated, with Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst James Seyffart expressing his expectation on X, stating, \u201cFidelity #ethereum ETF delayed just now. Completely expected. Dates that really matter are late May, in my view.\u201d Seyffart\u2019s insight suggested that the crucial decisions regarding the Fidelity Ethereum ETF will likely transpire in late May.\n\nLast week, TD Cowen analyst Jaret Seiberg noted that they anticipate the SEC will not approve ETFs for alternative crypto tokens, including Ethereum, \u201cany time soon.\u201d The reasoning behind this cautious approach is the SEC\u2019s intention to gain experience from the recent approval of Bitcoin ETFs before extending the approval to other cryptocurrencies. He further noted that the expectation is that Ethereum and other crypto token ETFs may face a longer wait, possibly extending beyond the 2024 U.S. presidential elections scheduled for November.\n\nNotably, the SEC recently granted authorization for 11 spot bitcoin ETFs to commence trading, prompting speculation within the industry about the potential approval of a spot Ethereum ETF. Fidelity, entering the race for a spot Ethereum ETF alongside industry giants BlackRock and Grayscale, is thus poised to play a significant role in shaping the regulatory landscape for Ethereum-related investment products.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLast week, Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin highlighted the significance of the SEC approving a spot Ether ETF, citing the inefficiency of existing financial instruments compared to ETFs. He distinguished Bitcoin and Ethereum, noting that while Bitcoin serves as a store of value or collateral currency, Ethereum is a commodity that powers transactions and storage on its network.\n\nRecently, BlackRock\u2019s CEO, Larry Fink, also expressed his endorsement for spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs), coming on the heels of the triumphant launch of the asset management giant\u2019s long-awaited spot Bitcoin ETF, stating he sees \u201cvalue in having an Ethereum ETF.\u201d\n\nThat said, following the latest development, investors are vigilantly monitoring potential shifts in the regulatory landscape. Notably, the approval of a spot ETH ETF could also serve as a catalyst, paving the way for approvals in the realm of other cryptocurrencies like Solana, XRP, and Cardano according to some experts."

        "content": "Disclaimer: The opinions expressed by our writers are their own and do not represent the views of U.Today. The financial and market information provided on U.Today is intended for informational purposes only. U.Today is not liable for any financial losses incurred while trading cryptocurrencies. Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDogecoin, the cryptocurrency that started as a joke but became a favorite of the masses, including Elon Musk, has recently experienced a significant breakout.\n\nAfter a period of consolidation, DOGE has broken past a critical resistance level, stirring excitement among traders and investors. The coin is currently sitting above the $0.088 mark, which previously acted as substantial resistance. If DOGE manages to maintain its position above this level, it could solidify this area as new support.\n\nA break above the $0.095 resistance could signal a continued bullish trend, potentially leading Dogecoin to test the psychological barrier of $0.10. If the momentum is sustained and market sentiment remains positive, DOGE could attempt to reach higher highs, possibly moving toward the $0.105 to $0.11 range last seen during its peak periods of trading activity.\n\nImmediate support for DOGE is now at $0.088 which, if held, could act as a springboard for further climbs. However, should Dogecoin fail to maintain this level, it might fall back to its previous support near $0.078, where buyers have historically shown interest.\n\nA scenario where DOGE's breakout continues would likely involve increased adoption news or a resurgence of interest in meme coins, potentially sparked by social media or celebrity endorsements. Such catalysts could drive demand and push DOGE past the $0.095 level, cementing its breakout status.\n\nConversely, if the breakout fails to sustain, perhaps due to broader market bearishness or fading interest, DOGE could slide back below $0.088. This would retest the resilience of the $0.078 support. A drop below this level could lead to a bearish phase, with DOGE potentially seeking lower ground.\n\nSolana shows strength\n\nDuring this market cycle, Solana has established itself as a leader. With its stable and easily scalable performance, it outpaces giants like Bitcoin and Ethereum, as the majority of DeFi volume went to the \"Ethereum killer.\"\n\nAs the DeFi ecosystem on Solana flourishes, it is becoming a hub for innovation, blending meme culture with decentralized applications. The network's efficiency and scalability are attracting a wide array of developers.\n\nThe cryptocurrency that has been on a strong upward trajectory. Currently, Solana is testing a resistance level at approximately $100, a significant psychological and technical barrier. A convincing break above this level could signal continued bullish momentum, potentially leading to testing the next resistance zone around $108, which coincides with recent highs.\n\nOn the downside, the 50-day moving average, sitting near $93.23, is providing dynamic support. This level has been defended multiple times, indicating its importance to traders. If Solana can maintain its footing above this moving average, it would reinforce the asset's stability and could serve as a springboard for further gains.\n\nThe next crucial test for Solana will be sustaining above $100. Should it consolidate above this level, it would not be unrealistic to envision a push toward $108, or even higher, as the market reassesses Solana's value proposition in the context of a rapidly evolving DeFi and NFT landscape.\n\nFundamental Ethereum problems\n\nAs it struggles to gain momentum, Ethereum's scalability suffering and the diminishing traction of meme coins on its network are at the forefront of the bearish case for the second-biggest cryptocurrency on the market.\n\nThe network's inability to handle high transaction volumes without exorbitant fees has led to the sentiment that Ethereum is becoming \"unusable\" for the day-to-day transactions that meme coins require.\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, Ethereum's price analysis paints a picture of uncertainty. The asset has been struggling to maintain momentum above crucial support levels. Currently, Ethereum is wavering around the $2,250 mark, with immediate support near the $2,150 level. A break below this support could see a decline toward the $2,000 psychological barrier, which would represent a significant bearish development.\n\nLayer-2 solutions like Optimism and Arbitrum have emerged as potential stopgaps, offering faster and cheaper transactions. However, their adoption has been less than stellar, with many viewing these platforms as temporary fixes rather than a comprehensive solution to Ethereum's underlying scalability problems."

        "content": "Dencun\u2019s final testnet deployment will take place on Feb. 7.\n\nBy: Samuel Haig \u2022 Loading...\n\nCrypto News\n\nEthereum\u2019s Dencun upgrade is now live on the Sepolia testnet following a smooth deployment.\n\nDencun went live on Sepolia on Jan. 30, marking the second of three testnet deployments for the highly-anticipated upgrade.\n\n\u201cSepolia has finalized,\u201d tweeted Terence Tsao of Prysmatic Labs, the team behind the Ethereum client, Prysm. \u201cSorry for an uneventful upgrade.\u201d\n\n\u201cBlobs are now flowing in Sepolia,\u201d tweeted Paritosh, a DevOps engineer at the Ethereum Foundation. \u201cUneventful testnet forks are the best ones!\u201d\n\nThe fork follows a somewhat rocky initial dress rehearsal on the Goerli testnet on Jan. 17. The Goerli fork triggered a network split resulting from a bug encountered by the Prysm client. Developers rectified the incident several hours after the fork's initiation.\n\nDencun final testnet deployment will take place on Ethereum\u2019s Holesky testnet come Feb. 7.\n\nEIP-4844\n\nDencun will significantly improve data availability and reduce the fees associated with transacting on Layer 2 by replacing gas-intensive calldata with blobs via the EIP-4844 upgrade, also dubbed proto-danksharding.\n\nThe upgrade positions Ethereum\u2019s Layer 2 ecosystem to compete with the transaction fees offered by alternative Layer 1s while inheriting the benefits of the Ethereum\u2019s mainnet robust security layer.\n\nA recent increase in on-chain activity has driven up Layer 2 transaction costs, with gas fees up between roughly 50% and 100% since mid-October on many leading L2s including Arbitrum, OP Mainnet, and Base, according to data from GrowThePie.\n\nIn an appearance on The Defiant Podcast, Carl Beekhuizen of the Ethereum Foundation described the cost of storing data on-chain as the primary bottleneck restricting the scalability gains available at Layer 2.\n\nDeFi Alpha Premium Content DeFi Daily | Weekdays\n\nDeFi Alpha Letter | Weekly\n\nDefiant Podcast Transcript | Weekly\n\nInbox Dump | Saturday\n\nWeekly Recap | Sunday Looking for Alpha?

        "content": "Forget Ethereum, this rival token Priced at $0.09 will reach $16 in 2024\n\nThe cryptocurrency landscape is witnessing a seismic shift as a new challenger, priced at a mere $0.09, emerges to rival Ethereum\u2019s long standing supremacy. This token, Retik Finance, is not just another entrant in the crowded crypto space; it represents a paradigm shift in decentralised finance (DeFi). As of writing, Retik\u2019s Presale Stage 7 has seen remarkable success, with 85.83% of the tokens sold, raising close to $14 million. This surge in interest is a testament to its potential and the growing recognition of its unique value proposition.\n\nIntroduction\n\n\n\nFor years, Ethereum has been the cornerstone of the DeFi ecosystem, known for its pioneering smart contract capabilities. However, the tides are turning with the advent of Retik Finance. Priced at just $0.09, Retik is more than just an affordable investment option; it\u2019s a symbol of innovation and a beacon of change in the cryptocurrency world.\n\nRetik Finance: A New DeFi Powerhouse\n\n\n\nRetik Finance is redefining the DeFi landscape with its comprehensive suite of services. It extends beyond the traditional boundaries of DeFi, offering a non-custodial wallet, swap aggregator, DeFi debit cards, payment gateway, AI-powered peer-to-peer lending, and options trading. This multifaceted approach is designed to bridge the gap between crypto and fiat realms, making it a formidable Ethereum rival.\n\nPresale Success: A Sign of Growing Confidence\n\nThe overwhelming response to Retik\u2019s presale stages, particularly Stage 7, is indicative of the crypto community\u2019s faith in its potential. With nearly 86% of its tokens already sold, raising close to $14 million, Retik is on the cusp of a significant breakthrough. This impressive presale performance highlights investors\u2019 appetite for innovative and utility-rich tokens like Retik.\n\nThe Utility and Appeal of Retik Finance\n\nRetik stands out with its real-world applications and user-centric design. Its DeFi debit cards allow for seamless crypto-to-fiat transactions, enabling users to use their digital assets for everyday purchases. This practical utility, combined with the security and autonomy of a non-custodial wallet, positions Retik as a practical and empowering financial tool.\n\nCompeting with Ethereum: A Tall Order?\n\nEthereum\u2019s position as a leading blockchain platform for DeFi is undisputed. However, Retik Finance is carving its niche by addressing some of Ethereum\u2019s most significant challenges, such as high gas fees and network congestion. By offering a scalable, efficient, and user-friendly alternative, Retik is not just competing with Ethereum; it\u2019s providing a viable solution for the next generation of DeFi users.\n\nWhat the Future Holds for Retik Finance\n\nAs Retik Finance gears up for its next milestones, the crypto world is watching closely. The success of its presale stages, especially Stage 7, is a strong indicator of its future trajectory. With its ambitious vision and robust ecosystem, Retik Finance is well-positioned to not just rival Ethereum but also redefine the DeFi landscape.\n\nConclusion\n\n\n\nThe rise of Retik Finance, priced at a modest $0.09, is a significant development in the crypto space. Its successful presale stages, innovative offerings, and real-world utility make it a token to watch out for. As it prepares for its next milestones, Retik Finance stands as a testament to the ever-evolving and dynamic nature of cryptocurrency, where innovation drives growth and challenges the status quo.

        "title": "One Crucial Factor for Ethereum ETF Approval: Bitfinex\u2019s Head of Derivatives - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "The industry is bustling with the trading of the newly introduced spot Bitcoin ETF in the United States, yet there\u2019s no equivalent for Ethereum.\n\nHowever, Jag Kooner, Bitfinex\u2019s Head of Derivatives, suggests that the approval of a Bitcoin ETF could impact the SEC\u2019s view on an Ethereum ETF, likely influenced by Ether\u2019s classification as a security or commodity.\n\nWhile speaking to CryptoPotato, Kooner highlighted that Ethereum ETFs swiftly emerged in other regions following the launch of the first Bitcoin ETF, particularly in Canada, where regulators were comfortable with the product due to the presence of a regulated futures market for ETH. This environment facilitated risk management for market makers during the creation and redemption of units.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Path to ETF Approval\n\nThe Bitfinex exec also noted SEC chairman Gary Gensler\u2019s stance, suggesting that crypto other than Bitcoin are viewed as securities, contrasting with Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart\u2019s observation that the SEC appears to regard Ethereum as a commodity, given the implicit acceptance of Ethereum futures-based ETFs.\n\nThe entry of prominent financial entities like BlackRock into the Bitcoin ETF space signaled a positive trajectory for crypto ETFs, potentially extending to Ethereum ETFs, as institutional participation often validates the market for regulators.\n\nHowever, initial attempts by Grayscale and BlackRock to convert their Ethereum trusts into ETFs faced SEC pushback, underscoring the importance of Ether\u2019s categorization. While spot Bitcoin ETFs have seen favorable trends, driven partly by GBTC\u2019s substantial investment, a similar scenario could unfold for Ethereum, according to Kooner, albeit contingent on Ether\u2019s recognition as a commodity.\n\n\u201cHowever, it must be noted that ETFs serve the purpose of bridging tradfi US investors and traders and crypto and the same could most likely not be true for other crypto assets which have not stood the test of time and established the reputation of \u201cdigital gold\u201d or a commodity as the largest crypto asset by market capitalization. An example could be the lackluster performance on the launch of futures Ethereum ETFs in comparison to futures-based Bitcoin ETFs.\u201d\n\nWhen Spot Ethereum ETF?\n\nTD Cowen, through its Washington Research Group led by Jaret Seiberg, has outlined a clearer timeline for the potential approval of a spot Ethereum ETF in the United States, targeting late 2025 or early 2026.\n\nDespite previous speculation that approval could occur post-November 2024 elections, the bank now anticipates a delay, stating that the SEC is unlikely to approve a fund dedicated to Ether in 2024. This decision is speculated to have been influenced by political factors, particularly the potential backlash from progressive Democrats following the recent approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF."

        "title": "TD Cowen: Spot Ethereum ETF Approval Unlikely to Happen in 2024 - Coinspeaker",
        "content": "According to TD Cowen, several factors, including Gensler\u2019s \u201cgo-slow\u201d approach, make spot ETH ETF approval unlikely this year.\n\nIn a recent note, investment bank TD Cowen has doubled down on its prediction that the approval of spot Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) will not happen any time soon. According to TD Cowen, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will take its time before any more approvals of this sort. The note also contains a likely timeline for the approval:\n\n\u201cWe do not expect the SEC in 2024 to approve a spot Ethereum ETF. This is a political call. We believe there is no upside for SEC Chair Gary Gensler to approve a spot Ethereum ETF given how upset progressive Democrats were over the agency\u2019s approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF earlier this month.\u201d\n\nGensler Not in a Hurry to Approve Spot Ethereum ETF\n\nLed by Jaret Seiberg, the TD Cowen Washington Research Group had previously noted that SEC Chair Gary Gensler is \u201ctaking a go-slow approach\u201d with the ETH ETF. According to the note, one of the reasons for this approach is that Gensler\u2019s tenure runs until June 2026. This gives the Chair quite a bit of time to wade through court cases and more enforcement action, instead of supporting legislation. Essentially, TD Cowen believes that \u201cGensler is in no hurry to act\u201d.\n\nAfter rejecting applications for over a decade, the SEC approved spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this month. Since the first application by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss\u2019 Gemini in 2013, the SEC has disapproved all proposals due to fraud concerns. Consequently, recent submissions seemed to address these concerns by including a surveillance-sharing agreement (SSA), which promotes market transparency and reduces the risk of fraud. While this contributed to the SEC\u2019s recent decision to approve, another major factor is a court ruling against the agency.\n\nGrayscale Investments had dragged the SEC to court after the Commission\u2019s 2022 refusal of the company\u2019s proposal to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) to an ETF. The company accused the Commission of \u201cfailing to apply consistent treatment to similar investment vehicles\u201d. According to Grayscale, the SEC was \u201cacting arbitrarily and capriciously\u201d. After the SEC lost the case, it seemed that approval was only a matter of time.\n\nTD Cowen Believes Gensler Is Treading Carefully on ETH ETF\n\nTD Cowen writes that Gensler might be unwilling to upset progressives any further as he would need them for any agenda he intends to push this year. Also, the investment bank believes that Gensler\u2019s possible interest in other roles, such as Treasury Secretary, might not come to fruition even if President Joe Biden wins a second term if the progressives are not on his side. The note also adds that Gensler would also like to monitor the performance of spot Bitcoin ETFs before approving ETH products.\n\nSo far, more than a dozen applicants have submitted proposals for spot ETH ETFs to the SEC. Last week, the Commission delayed decisions on Grayscale\u2019s and BlackRock\u2019s applications, stating that it needed more time to consider certain uses. For Grayscale, the SEC has instituted certain proceedings, including calling for public comments on the ETF."

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) and Polkadot\u2019s (DOT) wallet application, Talisman Wallet, launched Signet\u2019s private beta on January 30. Signet is an enterprise workflow management and multisig solution for on-chain organizations.\n\nFollowing the launch, Signet Lead Willian Chen explained how his product aligns with the Web3 needs to assist institutional operations.\n\n\u201cThe Web3 world must adapt to the complex needs of modern on-chain organizations, and this solution, which can be thought of as an operating system for blockchain financial operations, does just that. Signet improves organization workflow and enables signers to execute Multisig transactions more efficiently than ever.\u201d \u2014 William Chen, Signet Lead\n\nAside from workflow process management, Signet is committed to data privacy, \u201coffering several built-in features to support the Aleph Zero (AZERO) ecosystem,\u201d as communicated to Finbold.\n\nSignet to join the Polkadot ecosystem\n\nNotably, the Talisman Wallet is a popular choice for over 70,000 users, according to the team. These users have staked 5 million DOT using Talisman, worth $33.35 million considering Polkadot\u2019s current price of $6.67.\n\nTherefore, Signet Multisigs will be able to connect with thousands of decentralized applications (dApps) throughout the Polkadot ecosystem.\n\nErin Grasmick, Technical Lead of Infrastructure & Data at Parity Technologies, said the following:\n\n\u201cSignet is a fantastic addition to the Polkadot ecosystem and fills a much-needed gap in the multisig space. The talent behind the beloved UX and design of the Talisman wallet have applied their years of experience to streamlining multisig signing \u2013 and the result is a product that has all the usability we\u2019ve come to expect from this team. The work put in, and the attention to detail given should benefit anyone with a complex multisig workflow immensely. I\u2019m very excited to see where future development takes the project.\u201d \u2013 Erin Grasmick\n\nIn conclusion, Talisman Wallet\u2019s Signet targets figures involved in the Polkadot ecosystem, particularly on-chain enterprises and large institutions. As Signet embarks on its journey with the Private Beta program, it encourages interested parties to explore the future of enterprise workflow management and Multisig solutions in the blockchain space."
