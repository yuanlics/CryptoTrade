The bank's head of forex and digital assets research, Geoffrey Kendrick, expects the SEC to follow a similar approach to the one taken with spot bitcoin ETFs, starting with rejections and ultimately granting approval on the final deadline. Kendrick believes that the SEC's lack of classification of ether as a security in legal actions against crypto companies and the listing of ETH as a regulated futures contract on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange support the approval of spot Ethereum ETFs. He also notes that Grayscale's Ethereum trust could be turned into an ETF, and the SEC has not provided any fundamental reason to view ETH differently than the CME does. Kendrick predicts that the approval of spot Ethereum ETFs could lead to ETH prices reaching $4,000 by May"
