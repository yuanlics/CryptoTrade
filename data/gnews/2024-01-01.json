        "title": "Ethereum Improvement Proposals to watch in 2024 - Blockworks",
        "content": "The latest Ethereum All Core Developers meeting finally put some tentative dates on the upgrade schedule for the next mainnet hard fork, Dencun.\n\nWith the caveat that it\u2019s only \u201cif no major issues arise,\u201d Ethereum devs are eyeing the following dates for forking Ethereum\u2019s public testnets:\n\nGoerli: Jan. 17\n\nSepolia: Jan. 30\n\nHolesky: Feb. 7\n\nThis will be the last time that Goerli is included in the testing regimen, as the network is slated for deprecation.\n\nThey also discussed what comes next \u2014 the as-yet-un-nicknamed Prague/Electra upgrade. The Ethereum community is considering whether to focus on a large core feature \u2014 which could take a year of work \u2014 or structure the upgrade around multiple smaller improvements, which could be feasible for late 2024.\n\nA decision will come in the new year, but for now, here are some of the improvements to watch in 2024 in the wake of Dencun:\n\nEIP-4844 (Proto-Danksharding)\n\nThis is the big kahuna among Dencun EIPs, which were the focus of many news stories in 2023.\n\nRead more: Ethereum\u2019s next upgrade to focus on blobs\n\nThe upgrade \u201cwill reduce the cost of data availability across all layer-2s,\u201d StarkWare co-founder Eli Ben-Sasson told Blockworks. \u201cSo that\u2019s something that Starknet is very much anticipating so that users can have lower costs.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s at the \u201cforefront\u201d of what Lucas Henning, chief technology officer of Web3 wallet developer Suku, calls \u201ca year of groundbreaking improvements for Ethereum.\u201d\n\n\u201c[EIP-4844 is] a transformational enhancement\u201d that will slash rollups gas fees \u201cby up to 100x,\u201d Henning told Blockworks.\n\nRead more: Core devs rule out Dencun fork this year\n\nAccount abstraction comes into its own\n\nAlso at the top of Henning\u2019s mind are improvements taking advantage of account abstraction: ERC-4337 and its extension, ERC-6900.\n\nERCs are a subset of EIPs focusing specifically on token standards within the Ethereum ecosystem. They define rules for token implementations to ensure interoperability. Unlike some EIPs that modify the core protocol, ERCs typically don\u2019t require a hard fork.\n\nERC-4337 went live in March and the concept of account abstraction \u201cwill play a pivotal role as the most significant changes for the end-user,\u201d Henning said.\n\n\u201cAccount abstraction is set to revolutionize the way we perceive and interact with wallets, making gasless transactions the standard and secure social logins the new norm, fundamentally reshaping the Ethereum user experience,\u201d he said.\n\nTraditionally, Ethereum has two types of accounts: externally owned accounts (EOAs) controlled by private keys and contract accounts controlled by their code. Account abstraction blurs this distinction, allowing users to create accounts that behave more like smart contracts.\n\nIt can enhance both user experience and security, and allows for more complex account logic, such as multisig wallets or social recovery of lost keys.\n\nERC-6900, introduced the concept of \u201cdelegated transactions.\u201d This standard, which also did not require changes to Ethereum\u2019s mainnet consensus, allows users to delegate the ability to send transactions on their behalf, for instance, to make one approval for a batch of actions to save time and hassle.\n\nEIP-1153 (transient storage opcodes)\n\nThis proposal, part of Dencun, aims to introduce a new mechanism for handling temporary or transient storage during smart contract execution.\n\nTraditional storage operations on Ethereum are permanent and consume gas. This can be inefficient for temporary data that doesn\u2019t need to persist for longer than one transaction.\n\nEIP-1153 is an opcode (operational code) that would allow smart contracts to use transient storage \u2014 storage that would be wiped clean at the end of transaction execution.\n\nThe Uniswap team lobbied for 1153 to be included, and wanted it already in Shapella, but they couldn\u2019t rally enough support to reach consensus among the core developers. The upgrade is expected to play a significant role in enhancing the capabilities and efficiency of Uniswap\u2019s upcoming v4 protocol.\n\nRead more: What has Uniswap Labs cooked up for v4?\n\nBy enabling temporary storage, EIP-1153 can reduce the gas costs associated with storing data during contract execution and provide developers more flexibility in designing smart contracts.\n\nAnd by reducing the burden on permanent storage and minimizing state bloat, EIP-1153 can contribute to the overall scalability of the Ethereum network.\n\nEIP-4788 (Beacon block root commits)\n\nImagine Ethereum as a vast library with two main sections: the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) section, which is like the reading room where people come to read books (execute smart contracts), and the Beacon Chain section, which is like the library\u2019s catalog system, keeping track of all the books and their locations (consensus and coordination of the Ethereum network).\n\nBefore EIP-4788, these two sections functioned somewhat independently. The EVM section doesn\u2019t have direct access to the up-to-date catalog; it has to rely on indirect methods to understand what\u2019s happening in the Beacon Chain section.\n\nEIP-4788 proposes to put a \u201cBeacon Block Root\u201d (a summary or hash tree root of the parent block) into each EVM block.\n\nIt\u2019s like moving from an outdated card filing system in a library \u2014 inefficient and sometimes inaccurate \u2014 to a system with a real-time, accurate and direct link to the main library database.\n\nIn this modern library, every time a new book is added, moved or removed (the Beacon Chain updates), the readers (EVM) have immediate and accurate information. Readers can trust they\u2019re getting the most current information and the library operations (like executing smart contracts) are more aligned with the overall catalog system (the state of the consensus layer).\n\nAll this happens in a trust-minimized manner, eliminating the need for external oracles to provide this data, and thereby reducing potential points of failure or manipulation.\n\nThis change is particularly beneficial for liquid staking protocols such as Lido, smart contract-based bridges and restaking solutions, as it allows these protocols to access crucial data like validator balances and states directly from the consensus layer, enhancing their security and operational efficiency.\n\nEIP-4788 essentially introduces a protocol-level oracle, relaying Ethereum\u2019s consensus state throughout the mainnet.\n\nMisha Komarov, founder of Nil Foundation, which is deploying a zkOracle for Lido, called it \u201cdefinitely helpful.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey need the consensus layer state root within their application logic (right now it is being proven by Casper FFG proof done via zkLLVM to the execution layer within the zkOracle design,\u201d he told Blockworks.\n\nRead more: New Ethereum rollup takes a zero-knowledge approach to sharding\n\nEIP-5656 (MCOPY opcode)\n\nThe EVM operates using a set of opcodes that dictate various operations.\n\nEIP-5656 introduces a new opcode called MCOPY, which is proposed to optimize the process of copying data in memory during the execution of smart contracts.\n\nIn the current EVM architecture, copying large data segments can be inefficient and costly when using existing opcodes. MCOPY offers a more efficient way, one which is expected to reduce the gas fees associated with these operations, while improving performance.\n\nFaster memory operations mean quicker execution of contracts, and developers would have more tools at their disposal to optimize their smart contracts \u2014 particularly when dealing with large data structures or complex operations that involve memory manipulation.\n\nEIP-6780 (restrict SELFDESTRUCT)\n\nIn Ethereum, the SELFDESTRUCT opcode allows a smart contract to delete itself from the blockchain.\n\nWhen executed, it removes the contract\u2019s code and storage from the state and sends the contract\u2019s remaining ether to a specified address.\n\nHowever, this feature has led to several issues, including complexity in state management and potential security vulnerabilities.\n\nBy restricting SELFDESTRUCT, Ethereum can better manage its state size, leading to a more stable and predictable blockchain.\n\nThis is crucial for the network\u2019s long-term scalability and maintenance, as it will simplify future Ethereum upgrades.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "Vitalik Buterin Shares Ethereum Roadmap For 2024, Focuses on Six Key Components\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has shared the Ethereum roadmap for 2024, outlining the project's continued focus on six main components.\n\nButerin posted on X (formerly Twitter) an updated roadmap with annotations and diagrams, elaborating on each of the six elements: the Merge, the Surge, the Scourge, the Verge, the Purge and the Splurge.\n\nButerin noted that as Ethereum's technical direction becomes clearer, there are only a handful of minor adjustments compared to the 2023 roadmap. The Merge, which integrated the Ethereum mainnet with the proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain the Beacon Chain in September 2022, remains a key focus area. Buterin emphasized the importance of maintaining a simple and resilient PoS consensus.\n\nFollowing the Merge, the most significant observation on Ethereum was the transition from a power-intensive proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism to PoS, leading to a major reduction in the network's overall energy consumption.\n\nButerin also highlighted the developments in Ethereum's single-slot finality (SSF), which aims to ensure that changes to a blockchain block are irreversible without burning at least 33% of the total staked Ether (ETH).\n\nButerin stated:\n\n\"The role of single slot finality (SSF) in post-Merge PoS improvement is solidifying. It's becoming clear that SSF is the easiest path to resolving a lot of the Ethereum PoS design's current weaknesses.\"\n\nButerin's roadmap also emphasizes the importance of rollups, zero-knowledge proofs, account abstraction, and second-generation privacy solutions, which align with the original cypherpunk principles of Ethereum.\n\nLet us know what you loved about this article, what could be improved, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form."

        "title": "Ethereum Price Prediction: Will ETH Hit $10,000 In 2024? - CoinGape",
        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) has recently become the focal point of speculation, particularly regarding its potential surge to $10,000 in the upcoming bull run. According to a post by Altcoin Daily on X, Ethereum has the potential to hit $10,000. The bold Ethereum price prediction has sparked a wave of discussions and analysis within the crypto community.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Bullish Run In 2023\n\nAt press time, Ethereum price was trading around the $2,300 range, making Altcoin Daily\u2019s projection a staggering 350% gain. However, other analysts\u2019 projections and technical indicators suggest that hitting this target would take some time. To understand better, let\u2019s summarise Ethereum\u2019s performance in 2023 while looking at the technical aspects of its performance.\n\nadvertisement\n\nIn October 2023, the Ethereum price surged beyond $1,800 and surpassed the $2,000 mark in November. Since then, the second-largest crypto has maintained an upward trajectory in December, showcasing an approximately 14% increase. Despite a recent correction, it continues to hover around $2,300 after almost seven months of relatively stagnant performance.\n\nAlso Read: Analyst Predicts 22% Surge In Ethereum (ETH) Price Sparking Market Optimism\n\nETH Price Technical Analysis\n\nA closer look at technical analysis data reveals that Ethereum surpassed December 2023\u2019s Fibonacci pivot R2 level, approaching $2,210, signaling a positive trajectory. However, the brief touch of the R3 level before correction suggests potential volatility. As of now, the technical projections estimate Ethereum to trade between $2,300 and $2,400 by the end of 2023.\n\nWhilst, $2,350 is identified as the immediate goal for 2023 end and support is found between $2,000 and $2,125. Currently, Ethereum\u2019s price is trading well above the 50-day and 200-day EMAs, indicating an upward trajectory. Immediate expectations suggest a rally towards $2,500 towards the beginning of 2024.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction 2024-2030\n\nFurthermore, ETH price prediction by another renowned analyst paints a compelling picture. In a recent tweet, Rekt Capital, a popular crypto analyst on X, noted that Ethereum could witness a 22% surge if it\u2019s able to regain the $2,274 mark as support. This implies that the ETH price would propel up to more than $2,600.\n\nOn the other hand, the ETH forecasts by Changelly for the period from 2024 to 2030 range between $4,000 to $34,700. The projections hint at a volatile journey marked by bullish surges and significant pullbacks. In conclusion, while the $10,000 mark remains an unrealistic projection for 2024, Ethereum\u2019s current trends and technical analysis indicate a promising performance.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum Price Prediction as New Bearish Pattern Threats a Dive Below $2000"

He has previous trading experience and has been working in the Fintech industry since 2017.\n\nCryptocurrencies have been the topic of discussion since their inception, and many known personalities believe in investing in them. They also give investors their outlook and share predictions about them.\n\nNow, let\u2019s talk about Ethereum, which is used worldwide due to its secure network, validated transitions, and sustainable ecosystem. According to YChart, as of September 2023, there are over 245 million distinct Ethereum wallets in use globally.\n\nScott Melker\u2019s Predictions for Ethereum\n\nScott Melker, a prominent cryptocurrency trader, author, and podcaster, has made a bold prediction for the future price of Ethereum. Melker forecasts that the value of Ethereum will reach $12, 000 in 2024. He believes that the growing interest among investors in decentralized finance and the increasing demand for smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain will drive up the price.\n\nMoreover, Melker anticipates that the upcoming merger between the Ethereum mainnet and Beacon Chain will significantly enhance the network\u2019s scalability and security, making it more appealing to investors.\n\nMy target for 2025 is $12,000.\n\n\n\nBut not for $BTC.\n\n\n\nFor $ETH. \u2014 The Wolf Of All Streets (@scottmelker) December 31, 2023\n\nLark Darvis Predictions for Cryptocurrencies\n\nLark Davis, a well-known crypto YouTuber, has also given his thoughts regarding the future of cryptocurrencies. Davis speculates that the cryptocurrency markets will surge in 2024. Davis\u2019s predictions are grounded in several factors.\n\nFirstly, he expects that the current parabolic growth of stock markets will result in more people having spare cash to invest in exchanges.\n\nSecondly, he anticipates that Bitcoin ETFs may be approved by the SEC in Q1 of this year, which could significantly boost the value of Bitcoin and other exchanges.\n\nThird, Davis points out that major corporations are increasingly adopting blockchain technology, which could drive up the interest and need for cryptocurrencies.\n\nEthereum started 2023 with a slow start and a value of $1196, and itself did even better than most, almost doubling its price since the outset of the year! It went from $1200 to a happy $2260, a whopping 99% increase.\n\nIn 2024 it is expected that Ethereum will surge to mark $3000 and this may be due to global macroeconomic conditions, increased security, and many other aspects."

Additionally, a robust demand wall at $2,000 provides solid support, potentially cushioning any corrections. Ali Charts\n\nNearly two million wallets accumulated almost 40 million ETH between $1,900 and $2,020 price ranges, forming a formidable wall against massive market dumps.\n\nEthereum is also scheduled for notable technological upgrades like EIP-7514 and EIP-4844, also referred to as proto-danksharding, which is geared towards enabling more transactions for cheaper gas fees. Both EIPs are included in Dencun and could roll out before the end of the first quarter of 2024 as crypto.news reported.\n\nYou might also like: Vitalik Buterin reveals 6 main focuses for Ethereum in 2024\n\nApplications for spot ETH ETFs from firms like BlackRock, Fidelity, Galaxy, Grayscale, and Invescco could also act as catalysts for progressing Ethereum price movements.

Here\u2019s the level ETH may end up surpassing.\n\nEthereum Has No Significant On-Chain Resistance Ahead\n\nIn a new post on X, analyst Ali has discussed how Ethereum\u2019s support and resistance levels are looking like based on on-chain data. In on-chain analysis, the potential for any level to provide any notable amount of support/resistance to the price depends on the number of investors who acquired their coins.\n\nHere is a chart that shows the amount of ETH that was bought at some of the price ranges that the asset has visited before:\n\nThe density of cost basis at each of the different ETH price ranges | Source: @ali_charts on X\n\nThe graph shows that the $2,235 to $2,302 range carries the cost basis of a significant number of coins. More specifically, 1.84 million addresses acquired more than 6 million ETH inside this range.\n\nCurrently, the Ethereum price is trading just above this range, implying that all these investors are in the green. If the Ethereum spot price retraces into this range, these holders could show some reaction, as their profit-loss boundary would be retested.\n\nSince these holders would have been in profits just before the retest, they might want to buy more, as they may believe that this same price range that was profitable earlier might turn out to be a worthy buy again.\n\nSince the range is thick with investors, this buying effect that may arise on a retest could end up providing support to the price. If the support fails, the price might be between $1,958 and $2,029.\n\nThis range is much more robust, hosting a cost basis of over 37 million ETH. Ali notes that this support could potentially help cushion any corrections that may take place.\n\nNow, Ethereum has strong support below, and as is apparent in the chart, there is no major demand wall above it simultaneously. Investors in loss (those with a cost basis higher than the current spot price) may be desperate to escape the market, so the price rising to their break-even can be an enticing exit opportunity.\n\nIf many holders are sitting at a loss, their demand zone could provide significant resistance to the price because of such selling. ETH has no such obstacles in the nearby price ranges so that the coin could rally further. \u201cThe path ahead of ETH is clear, with no significant supply barriers in sight, suggesting a potential rise to $2,700 or beyond,\u201d explains the analyst.\n\nThe market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock has also shared a chart that could provide further evidence for a bullish case of Ethereum.\n\nThe trend in the HODLer ratio for Bitcoin and Ethereum | Source: IntoTheBlock\n\nAs is visible in the above graph, the percentage of Ethereum investors who can be classified as \u201cHODLers\u201d (1 year+ holding time) has shot up recently. \u201cThis year, the percent of long-term ETH holders surpassed that of Bitcoin for the second time ever!\u201d notes IntoTheBlock.\n\nETH Price\n\nEthereum is currently at the $2,316 mark, not too far above the support zone mentioned earlier.\n\nLooks like the price of the coin hasn't been moving much recently | Source: ETHUSD on TradingView\n\nFeatured image from Kanchanara on Unsplash.com, charts from TradingView.com, IntoTheBlock.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Qadir Ak is the founder of Coinpedia. He has over a decade of experience writing about technology and has been covering the blockchain and cryptocurrency space since 2010. He has also interviewed a few prominent experts within the cryptocurrency space.\n\nStory Highlights Experts predict Ethereum could reach $5,300, fueled by Vitalik Buterin's roadmap for advancements.\n\nBitcoin's dominance may peak before a halving event, opening doors for altcoins like Ethereum.\n\nInitiatives like Scourge address PoS system issues, showcasing Ethereum's dedication to improvement.\n\nThe crypto sphere is buzzing with anticipation as Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, charts a course toward a potential price surge. Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum, has rolled out a detailed plan for 2024, highlighting significant advancements in the blockchain world.\n\nHere are the exciting predictions for ETH in the year 2024.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Growing Momentum\n\nCurrently, Ethereum is valued at $2,275.86, showing a daily increase of 2.84% and a monthly growth of 14.45%. This steady rise suggests Ethereum might reach $5,000 soon. The surge in December was driven by hopes of ETF approval and BlackRock\u2019s involvement in the Ethereum ETF market.\n\nMarket experts believe Ethereum could hit $5,300 based on Buterin\u2019s 2024 plan and market trends. This expected rise is backed by key metrics and upcoming improvements to Ethereum\u2019s blockchain.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum Price Records New High! Will ETH Price Hit $2,500 This Week?\n\nEchoing the same sentiment, Raoul Pal, a prominent figure in the crypto space, in his video adds weight to this speculation, predicting a significant uptick in Ethereum\u2019s value. He ties this projection to the advent of an Ethereum ETF, marking a critical catalyst that could propel Ethereum\u2019s market sentiment to all-time highs.\n\nPal highlights, that Buterin\u2019s updated roadmap for Ethereum\u2019s evolution provides a blueprint for the network\u2019s future. It outlines transformative changes such as the implementation of Single Slot Finality (SSF), designed to rectify existing Proof-of-Stake (PoS) design flaws, potentially enhancing transaction speeds and overall security. These strides in scalability, especially through the Surge and rollup enhancements, signal Ethereum\u2019s relentless pursuit of efficiency and broader usability.\n\nEthereum vs. Bitcoin: The 2024 Outlook\n\nWhile Bitcoin has dominated the crypto market recently, many predict Ethereum will lead in 2024. A common view is that Bitcoin\u2019s market dominance will peak before a halving event, paving the way for altcoins like Ethereum to shine. Ethereum\u2019s growing ecosystem, with projects like Arbitrum and Optimism, adds to this optimism. Buterin\u2019s efforts to streamline Ethereum further highlight its potential.\n\nButerin\u2019s plan also addresses challenges within Ethereum\u2019s PoS system. Initiatives like Scourge aim to tackle issues like Maximum Extractable Value (MEV) and stake pooling. Despite facing challenges like Verifiable Delay Functions (VDFs), Ethereum\u2019s dedication to improvement remains evident.\n\nThe Journey to $5k\n\nEchoing positive sentiments, Arthur Hayes underscores Ethereum\u2019s rising importance in the crypto landscape. If Ethereum maintains its growth momentum, reaching $5,000 is plausible. Technical measures like RSI and MACD also support Ethereum\u2019s promising path forward.\n\nRead More: Ethereum Will Make Millionaires In 2024 \u2013 Predicts Crypto Expert Lark Davis"

        "content": "Ethereum's 2024 roadmap, shared by Vitalik Buterin, prioritizes minor adjustments and continuity with core priorities like merge, surge, scourge, verge, purge, and splurge.\n\nWith a strategy that places an emphasis on continuity from the previous year, Ethereum is making steady growth throughout the year 2024, with co-founder Vitalik Buterin serving as the driving force behind this success. A recent sequence of tweets by Buterin reveals that the emphasis for the year 2024 is mainly aligned with the components that have been formed since the beginning of the year: merge, surge, plague, verge, purge, and splurge. This indicates that the strategy for the year is more evolutionary than revolutionary.\n\nThe merging continues to be an essential component in the evolution of Ethereum. Putting an emphasis on the significance of single-slot finality (SSF), Buterin highlights the function that it plays in strengthening the Proof of Stake (PoS) architecture that was created after the merger. He makes the observation that SSF is gradually being seen as the most easy solution to the present limits of Ethereum's Proof-of-Stake architecture, which improves the network's security and efficiency at the same time.\n\nAdditionally, steady effort will be made on the surge in 2024, with the primary emphasis being on improving cross-rollup standards and interoperability with the objective of achieving a considerable increase in scalability over the long run. In the meanwhile, the plague is being rethought in order to fight the economic concentration that occurs in PoS. In accordance with Ethereum's philosophy of decentralisation, it entails addressing significant problems such as Miner Extractable Value (MEV) and general stake pooling concerns.\n\nThe verge is going to undergo significant revisions, the most important of which is going to be the incorporation of Verkle trees. Through this new development, the Layer 2 (L2) networks of Ethereum are going to be optimised, which will further improve the scalability and efficiency of the blockchain. However, Buterin's approach to the issue demonstrates a proactive posture on network improvements. This suggests that the gas limit for Ethereum may be raised at any moment, without requiring waiting for complete SNARKs. This is particularly true for modest enhancements.\n\nIn the year 2024, the purge will concentrate on simplifying the Ethereum protocol by decreasing the amount of space on hard drives that validators need to have and getting rid of data that is no longer relevant. This will result in storage being streamlined and network congestion being reduced. The phase includes a number of modest modifications that are designed to guarantee that the process will go smoothly after the preceding stages. This encompasses anything else that does not cleanly fall into the categories that came before it, but is necessary for the general health and effectiveness of the network.\n\nImage source: Shutterstock"

The first on his list was the fact that stock markets are going parabolic right now with all the major market indexes growing. As a result, people are making a lot of money and have spare cash to invest in cryptocurrency in the near future.\n\nThe second one was the likely approval of Bitcoin ETFs by the SEC regulator. He expects it to happen in Q1, which could be either in January or in March, if the SEC delays it in January.\n\nAmong the other reasons mentioned by Davis was the expected victory of the Coinbase exchange over the SEC in court; should this happen, this will indicate the ultimate loss suffered by the regulator in court. In 2023, the SEC was beaten by Grayscale and by Ripple Labs, when the judge ruled that secondary sales of XRP did not qualify as security sales. Besides, the SEC on its own initiative dropped personal cases against Ripple chief Brad Garlinghouse and its co-founder and former CEO Chris Larsen.\n\nDavis also named the upcoming fourth Bitcoin halving event in April this year and a massive wave of games based on Web3 where cryptocurrencies will be utilized as in-game currencies. Besides, the U.S. Fed considers starting to cut down interest rates this year."

        "title": "Ethereum Classic and BNB Devotees Targeting Rebel Satoshi for the Next Major Crypto Triumph! - BSC NEWS",
        "content": "Despite gains from ETC and BNB, investor attention seems to be shifting towards Rebel Satoshi, an emerging meme coin aiming to combat centralization in the crypto market.\n\nTLDR\n\nEthereum Classic gains 6% in a week, and analysts foresee more growth soon.\n\nBNB pumps 11% in a week, with more gains coming before the year ends.\n\nRebel Satoshi has generated a 100% ROI thus far, with more gains coming soon.\n\nAs the year nears its end, top altcoins like Ethereum Classic (ETC) and BNB (BNB) have recorded notable gains. However, investor sentiment is shifting to new tokens with low entry points and promising returns. This explains why Rebel Satoshi ($RBLZ), an upcoming meme coin, is witnessing an influx of investors.\n\nWhy are Ethereum Classic and BNB investors lining up to invest in Rebel Satoshi? Continue reading to find out!\n\nEthereum Classic Surges 6% in a Week: More Gains Coming?\n\nEthereum Classic has performed decently over the past seven days. On December 19, ETC was trading at around $19.78. However, ETC started climbing on December 20 due to the bullish sentiment in the broader crypto market. With ETC being one of the earliest altcoins, this bullish sentiment saw it surge as high as $22.08 on December 22.\n\nNonetheless, ETC failed to hold these gains and started retracing its growth. By December 26, ETC had stabilized at around $21.09. This price means ETC has gained 6.62% in a week. So, why are ETC investors abandoning it despite its recent gains? Let\u2019s jump into expert predictions for December to determine whether it is a good idea to dump ETC now!\n\nPer experts, ETC will surge to close the year at $24.06. Experts peg this prediction on Ethereum Classic getting more adoption before the Spiral Network upgrade ships on January 31. This prediction makes Ethereum Classic a good crypto to buy!\n\nBNB Jumps 11% in a Week: Will Bulls Continue Charging?\n\nBNB has performed well over the past seven days. On December 19, BNB was changing hands at around $267.90. After trading sideways for days, BNB started surging on December 26 after Binance announced the opBNB festivities, which promised a $450,000+ giveaway.\n\nThis news saw BNB surge as high as $302.37 on December 26 before experiencing a slight correction to level off at $298.61. This price means BNB has gained 11.46% in a week. Based on this performance, is BNB a top crypto to buy for massive gains before the year ends?\n\nPer experts, BNB will continue its uptrend to close the year at $319.50. Experts base this prediction on BNB gaining more adoption after Binance reached a $4.3 billion settlement with U.S. authorities.\n\nRebel Satoshi Inches Closer to Its February Launch Date After Jumping 100%!\n\nRebel Satoshi, an emerging meme coin that aims to combat centralization in the crypto market, has attracted hordes of investors after completing Warriors Round 2 of its presale in 15 days. It is worth noting that Rebel Satoshi completed the Early Bird Round of its presale in three weeks before concluding Rebels Round 1 in ten days.\n\nThese growth metrics make Rebel Satoshi the fastest-growing meme coin. Rebel Satoshi has achieved these milestones due to $RBLZ. $RBLZ is Rebel Satoshi\u2019s governance and membership token. This means $RBLZ offers investors access to features like the Rebel NFT Vault, an NFT marketplace, a staking program, and a P2E game.\n\nAs of December, Rebel Satoshi was underway with Citizens Round 3 of its presale. During this round, the price for $RBLZ stood at $0.020. This price means Early Bird Round investors that bought $RBLZ at $0.010 have realized a 100% ROI.\n\nOn the other hand, Rebels Round 1 and Warriors Round 2 investors have seen the value of their $RBLZ investments surge 53.85% and 11.11%, respectively. More importantly, $RBLZ will generate a 25% ROI for Citizens Round 3 investors when it climbs to its listing price of $0.025. This forecast makes $RBLZ the best crypto to invest in now!\n\nFor the latest updates and more information, be sure to visit the official Rebel Satoshi Presale Website or contact Rebel Red via Telegram."

        "content": "Ethereum has released its roadmap for 2024, focusing on scalability, security, and sustainability improvements.\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin announced the plan on social media on Dec. 31, outlining several key initiatives for the platform\u2019s development.\n\nEnhancements in scalability\n\nIn 2022, Ethereum underwent a significant change known as \u2018The Merge,\u2019 transitioning from a proof-of-work (PoW) to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. The transition is expected to reduce the platform\u2019s energy consumption and lay the groundwork for future enhancements.\n\n\u2018The Surge,\u2019 a crucial component of Ethereum\u2019s roadmap, aims to increase network scalability through data sharding. By dividing the blockchain into smaller parts, Ethereum intends to boost its transaction processing capabilities and reduce costs, addressing one of the most pressing issues faced by blockchain technologies today.\n\nThis development is expected to bring Ethereum closer to achieving its goal of processing over 100,000 transactions per second, as noted by Buterin in recent statements.\n\nNetwork streamlining and future research\n\n\u2018The Scourge\u2019 and \u2018The Verge\u2019 focus on enhancing network security and user experience, respectively.\n\nThe Scourge is designed to tackle potential security vulnerabilities and improve the robustness of the network, including the challenges posed by Miner Extractable Value (MEV) and liquidity pooling.\n\nOn the other hand, The Verge aims to streamline user experiences and provide improved tools for developers, making Ethereum more accessible and efficient.\n\nThe roadmap also includes \u2018The Purge\u2019 and \u2018The Splurge.\u2019\n\nThe Purge involves removing outdated code to improve network efficiency and security.\n\nMeanwhile, The Splurge represents an investment in Ethereum\u2019s future, exploring emerging technologies like zero-knowledge proofs and rollups and fostering innovation within the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nFoundational principles\n\nButerin has emphasized the need for Ethereum to reconnect with its original cypherpunk vision, which prioritizes decentralized applications, privacy protection, and peer-to-peer communication.\n\nThis includes integrating rollups and zero-knowledge proofs to enable more private and censorship-resistant applications on the Ethereum network.\n\nEthereum\u2019s 2024 roadmap reflects a comprehensive strategy to address current challenges and capitalize on emerging opportunities in the blockchain space. With a focus on scalability, security, sustainability, and staying true to its foundational principles, Ethereum is poised to strengthen its position as a leader in the digital currency ecosystem."

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) may be experiencing a major drawdown at the moment, however, on-chain data points to a potential run in price in the short to mid-term.\n\nNext Ethereum (ETH) Price Target Locked\n\nAccording to on-chain market analyst, Ali Martinez, Ethereum currently has no significant barrier ahead of it judging by the In and Out of the Money Around Price indicator from crypto analytics platform IntoTheBlock.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThis data shows that a total of 7.82 million addresses or 65.4% of the total wallets in the network are in the money, or profitable at the moment. This is compared with the 4.13 million addresses or 34.5% that are out of the money or in losses. Ethereum holders that are at break-even points or \u201cAt The Money\u201d are just approximately 12,430 or 0.10% of the total wallets in the network.\n\nTo Martinez, since there are no supply barriers in sight, Ethereum could ultimately soar as high as $2,700 in the short term, a level beyond the $2,500 conservative projection. Should this feat be achieved, Ethereum would be retesting a price level last seen in early May 2022.\n\nThis price call, though ambitious, is a big shift from current reality. At the time of writing, Ethereum was trading for $2,310.95, up by 0.28% in the past 24 hours as it tries to wriggle away from the mild losses accrued as the new year unfolds. Over the past week, Ethereum has still maintained a mildly bullish outlook, having surged by 1.12%.\n\nEthereum Versus Alternative Chains\n\nEthereum is facing an existential threat from some of the key rivals that surround it including Solana (SOL), XRP Ledger, Avalanche (AVAX), and Cardano (ADA) to mention a few.\n\nWhile the growth of Ethereum has been relatively poor compared to these alternatives, Solana has expanded its influence over the former with the visible flippening happening to DEX volumes and other core areas.\n\nIn addition, Solana has recorded a more bullish price action when compared to the past year as SOL jumped as high as 989% while Ethereum has only managed to print 94.16% over the past year. Other chains like Cardano and the XRPL are also innovating in a way that proves they are fully ready to evolve in the coming months."

        "content": "Ethereum is still the leading Dapp chain. It comes with a first mover advantage. Furthermore, it offers security, due to its size, to all projects and L2s. It also offers a thriving consumer crypto ecosystem.\n\nIn this article, we dig into 10 apps to watch out for in 2024. So, let\u2019s take a closer look at what 10 interesting apps Ethereum has to offer in 2024. This is the first part.\n\n1) Interface\n\nInterface is a mobile explorer. It allows you to follow wallets. This, in turn, allows you to see their activity. The app has a few tricks up its sleeve. For example, you can view other accounts based on common assets. Or how about finding other users you follow on other platforms?\n\nHowever, one of its top features is the push notification option. It allows you to see what your friends are up to in real time. What are they minting or trading. Never miss out on trendy events, like hot meme coins.\n\nTo date, they have raised $1.4 million. That\u2019s after an initial crowdfunding campaign. This campaign netted the platform 50 ETH back in early 2022. Before you can enter the app, you need to meet some criteria. These show that you have some Web3 experience.\n\nFollow creators on Interface -> get notified when a new article is published -> be first to mint -> earn Mirror Protocol rewards. https://t.co/Eb2cG7Ym4I \u2014 Interface (@interfacedapp) December 19, 2023\n\n2) Zora\n\nZora is an NFT marketplace. The platform dates to 2020 when it was founded. It\u2019s also a Layer 2 on Ethereum. Zora has plenty of cool features. For instance, there\u2019s a no-code creator tool kit. You can create collections with ease and put them up for minting.\n\nAnd guess what, the Zora chain doesn\u2019t have a token yet. So, being active on Zora, and mint regularly, may help you to qualify for their airdrop. You can mint on Zora or other NFT marketplaces, that you can find on the Zora chain. For example, mint dot fun.\n\nThey also have a cool referral program. If you bring in creators, you get 0.000111 ETH per mint. That can quickly add up to an interesting amount of ETH.\n\nWe made it rewarding:\n\n\u2737 No create fees\n\n\u2737 Protocol Rewards\n\n\u2737 Mint + create referrals\n\n\u2737 First minter rewards\n\n\u2737 Splits + so much more \u2014 Zora (@ourZORA) December 31, 2023\n\n3) Brian\n\nWith Brian, we move into the AI space. That\u2019s one of the narratives that has a lot of growth potential in 2024. Brian has a specific feature that makes it stand out. It gives prompts in English. It offers three different bots that you can deploy. There\u2019s a Telegram, X, and website bot available.\n\nThe app is also noncustodial. This is of importance because you stay in control of your assets. The project already has a token, BRAIN. Their website is brainai.tech. Brain advertises itself as the first blockchain AI SaaS offering. Besides the contextual chat, staking and NFT minting are in the pipeline. Currently, Brian is only available as a mobile version.\n\nSo, next time, you can tell the app, \u201cHi Brian, please swap 150 OP to BRAIN on Uniswap\u201d. How cool is that?\n\n\ud83e\udd16 Five FAQs for all the new @BrianknowsAI users! 1. What is Brian? Brian is an AI assistant that allows users to perform transactions, research web3 info and data, and deploy smart contracts by prompting. These operations are already available in the Brian App, which is in\u2026 pic.twitter.com/4znzAz0zM3 \u2014 Brian (@BrianknowsAI) December 29, 2023\n\n4) Warpcast\n\nWarpcast is like Twitter. It\u2019s a social media app on the Farcaster protocol. It offers a lot of Web3 features. However, you can also port your following into various other apps. Now that is a real special feature. Wherever you go on Ethereum, you will see familiar faces this way. It\u2019s like making Ethereum your hood!\n\nAs a result, their X profile is not very active. Their last X post dates to 16th August 2023. Instead, you can create an account and join their conversation in real time. It\u2019s a decentralized app that wants to give data ownership back to its users. That\u2019s you.\n\nThe team behind Warpcast is former Coinbase staff. So, it seems like a solid team with a Web3, and crypto background is at the helm. The picture below shows the X based messages.\n\nSource: Warpcast\n\n5) Privy\n\nPrivy is an embedded wallet for Web3 logins. You can onboard users to a Web3 app, regardless if they already have a wallet or not. You most likely have used it, without knowing or realizing it. Not only that, but you can sign in with an email or password. At the same time, a wallet already works in the background. A convenient option for Web2 users to get into Web3.\n\nIn November, the team had a series A funding round that netted $18 million. So, they seem financially sound. They\u2019re backed by some heavy weights. For example, Sequoia, Paradigm, or Electric Capital. Furthermore, the team offers secure solutions for their app. You can also customize the app, which helps with integration in your very own app.\n\n1/ Transaction MFA \ud83d\udee1\ufe0f Wallets are not one-size-fits-all. As assets grow in a user\u2019s account, it becomes important to layer on additional security measures. Privy now offers the ability for users to require successful MFA verification prior to embedded wallet transactions. pic.twitter.com/JKFPq1q1bV \u2014 Privy (@privy_io) December 20, 2023\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe information discussed by Altcoin Buzz is not financial advice.

Let\u2019s see how they can perform well if markets are going up high.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Surges By 9%, Will It Cross $2,500?\n\nEthereum (ETH) is beginning to pick up the pace after a rather slow start in the bull market. Ethereum has marked a 2023 high of $2,445 after its recent 9% price increase. Analysts have been excited about the rally, although its price has dropped to $2,330.\n\nThe increase in the price of Ethereum can be liked by several events. A significant reason is the approval of a spot ETF that has caused huge excitement in the crypto space.\n\nAn increase in the interest of decentralized finances (DeFi) has also been observed on the network. The recent purchase of BTC worth $615 million serves as a secure base for Ethereum (ETH) to move towards the upside, according to Jordi Alexander, the CIA of Selini Capital.\n\nHe has said that the ETH price will hit a big rally by breaking $2,500 in the next few weeks. Alexander added that at the start of January 2024, the stakes and rewards will be high for Ether. Pentoshi is another trader who also has a similar bullish take.\n\nPentoshi has said the price of Ethereum is $3,485 bound and is one of the top crypto coins to buy. But in order to raise the value of Ethereum, bulls must overcome $2,500. On the flip side, Meme Moguls have come up as a top altcoin with more momentum.\n\nMeme Moguls (MGLS): The Dark Horse of the Bull Market\n\nThe popularity of Ethereum means it is one of the most talked about cryptocurrencies. However, while it has been predicted to rally in 2024, Meme Moguls (MGL) is one project that has shown enough potential to outperform the market.\n\nMeme Moguls has created the world\u2019s first DeFi project that blends investing and memes. The platform provides users with an innovative way to manage and grow their wealth by interacting with the meme-based marketplace.\n\nThis is how they can learn new investing strategies. A total amount of $100,000 will be given to new users to test their ideas and improve them on this new blockchain ICO.\n\nThere will also be many contests and matches through which students can win exciting prizes. A significant benefit, is to be able to withdraw the rewards will create an amazing passive income opportunity, which makes it even more interesting.\n\nMeme Moguls had a surge in activity in December as a result of its innovative new model. This has aided the rise of its native token, MGLS, to $0.0025. Analysts predict a 20x price increase for MGLS once the blockchain ICO gathers popularity and launches in early 2024.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nEthereum\u2019s recent price increase and strong fundamentals suggest that it is well-positioned to lead the altcoin rally. While ETH is expected to rally in the first quarter of 2024, Meme Moguls looks set to outperform the altcoin market. While still underpriced, now is a great opportunity to stack MGLS tokens before it becomes one of the top crypto coins.\n\nVisit Meme Moguls\n\nDisclaimer: The statements, views and opinions expressed in this article are solely those of the content provider and do not necessarily represent those of Crypto Reporter.

        "title": "Ethereum - Vitalik Buterin Reveals the Roadmap for 2024 - Cointribune EN",
        "content": "Mon 01 Jan 2024 \u25aa 3 min of reading \u25aa by Eddy S.\n\nVitalik Buterin, the renowned co-founder of Ethereum, has recently revealed the roadmap and vision for the network in 2024. In a series of posts, he detailed the 6 main components that will shape Ethereum this year. Here\u2019s an overview of the strategic directions for the network\u2019s development in 2024.\n\nSingle-slot finality at the heart of technical improvements\n\nOne of the key points of the roadmap is the development of single-slot finality (SSF). This mechanism aims to reinforce the irreversibility of blocks on Ethereum. The SSF allows for locking in changes in a block, except in the case of a major attack.\n\nFor Buterin, the SSF seems to be the ideal solution to address the current weaknesses of proof of stake. By consolidating irreversibility, it would greatly improve the resilience and security of the consensus. Therefore, the SSF appears as the cornerstone of the upcoming technical efforts.\n\nBack to the cypherpunk roots of the initial vision\n\nButerin also recalled his original vision for Ethereum, rooted in the cypherpunk legacy. He wanted it to be a kind of \u201cdecentralized hard drive\u201d using cryptography. But this aspect has faded since 2017 with the rise of financial features.\n\nAccording to Vitalik Buterin, recent innovations like rollups or ZK-Snarks could help reconnect with the cypherpunk values. Thus, returning Ethereum\u2019s technological and liberating dimension is part of the goals for 2024.\n\nOther pillars of Ethereum\u2019s development in 2024\n\nAside from single-slot finality and a return to a more cypherpunk vision, Buterin has outlined several other key directions for the ongoing development of Ethereum in 2024 in his roadmap:\n\nImproving scalability through rollups and sharding\n\nStrengthening the decentralization of validation nodes\n\nOptimizing user experience to attract more developers\n\nContinuing with security updates and protocol upgrades\n\nIncorporating innovations from recent academic research\n\nThe ultimate goal is to make Ethereum a reference blockchain, combining security, decentralization, high processing capacity, privacy, and innovation capacity. An extremely ambitious program that will require cutting-edge technical advancements in the years to come.\n\nThrough this roadmap, Vitalik Buterin sketches the contours of a more technically proficient Ethereum that remains true to its cypherpunk roots. Realizing this ambitious vision will involve innovations like single-slot finality. The plan for 2024 offers a fascinating glimpse into the developments to come for Ethereum.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program!

        "content": "A popular crypto analyst believes that the current upside potential for Bitcoin is limited despite the possible approval of spot market BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\n\nWidely followed strategist Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe tells his 680,000 followers on the social media platform X that the top crypto asset by market cap will rally somewhere between $48,000 and $52,000 if the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approves BTC ETFs sometime in January.\n\nHowever, Van de Poppe says he envisions BTC hitting a new all-time high in late 2024.\n\n\u201cMy vision for the Bitcoin price action remains the same. I expect we\u2019re relatively capped to the upside with the spot ETF approval news. Perhaps peaking at $48,000-$52,000 and then a relatively calm period of sideways, range-bound price action until a new ATH (all-time high) in late 2024.\u201d\n\nBitcoin is trading for $42,391 at time of writing, a fractional increase during the last day.\n\nMoving on to the top smart contract platform Ethereum (ETH), Van de Poppe says that he believes the top altcoin is bottoming out against Bitcoin (ETH/BTC), adding that Q1 2024 would be a \u201creasonable period\u201d for ETH.\n\n\u201cEthereum shows signals of a potential bottom. As I suspect Bitcoin to be close to finalizing this upward run, I think Ethereum will start to take over. Based on historical price actions, multiple signals of a potential reversal + Q1 is a reasonable period for Ethereum.\u201d\n\nLooking at the trader\u2019s chart, he seems to predict that ETH/BTC will rally to 0.12 BTC ($5,088) by April 2024. At time of writing, ETH/BTC is worth 0.05384 BTC ($2,282).\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "At the end of the day, Ethereum's recent price movements reflect a pattern of buyers stepping in during dips, signaling a quest for value opportunities.\n\nEthereum's recent trading sessions have exhibited some fluctuations, but it appears that buyers are stepping in during brief dips.\n\nThis pattern suggests that market participants are actively seeking value opportunities.\n\nThe driving force behind this trend seems to be the anticipation of ample liquidity stemming from the United States, as the Federal Reserve is expected to implement rate cuts in 2024. This has injected added momentum into the cryptocurrency markets.\n\nForex Brokers We Recommend in Your Region See full brokers list\n\nWhen analyzing the support levels, the $2,100 mark stands out as a crucial support zone. Not only has it previously acted as resistance, but it also coincides with the presence of the 50-day Exponential Moving Average, which naturally garners attention from traders.\n\nSimilarly, the 20-day EMA has demonstrated its effectiveness in providing significant support. In essence, Ethereum currently benefits from multiple layers of support, which reinforces the notion that it may be only a matter of time before it experiences a substantial upward movement.\n\nThe $2,500 level could potentially serve as a point of resistance in the short term. However, surpassing this hurdle opens the door to further gains, with the $2,750 level representing the next potential target. Beyond that, the $3,000 level looms as a viable objective. It's important to recognize that Ethereum's ascent relies heavily on a robust risk appetite. Presently, indications suggest there is a favorable level of risk appetite in the market.\n\nMomentum and Consolidation\n\nNonetheless, it is important to acknowledge that Ethereum has recently experienced a notable upward surge. Consequently, it is sensible to anticipate a period of consolidation to alleviate some of the excess enthusiasm that has built up over the past few weeks.\n\nAdditionally, the prevailing liquidity conditions must be taken into consideration. Many traders, particularly institutional ones, are expected to be away from their trading desks during this timeframe. While Ethereum may not attract as much institutional trading activity as Bitcoin, it can still influence overall market behavior.\n\nAt the end of the day, Ethereum's recent price movements reflect a pattern of buyers stepping in during dips, signaling a quest for value opportunities. The anticipation of increased liquidity resulting from US rate cuts in 2024 has provided added impetus to the cryptocurrency markets. Ethereum boasts multiple layers of support, with $2,100 and the associated 50-day EMA being significant. The short-term outlook points to resistance around $2,500 but surpassing this level could open the door to further gains. However, a degree of consolidation is expected to work off the recent momentum, and the influence of liquidity conditions should not be underestimated.\n\nReady to trade ETH/USD?

        "content": "Ethereum has recently witnessed a notable development with the unveiling of its 2024 roadmap by co-founder Vitalik Buterin. Released in a series of informative posts on December 30, the roadmap has stirred the market, giving a promising trajectory for Ethereum\u2019s value. Ethereum (ETH)price stands at $2,281, with a slight 0.41% dip in the last 24 hours.\n\nBy popular demand, an updated roadmap diagram for 2023! pic.twitter.com/oxo58A2KuG advertisement \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) December 30, 2023\n\nCentral to Ethereum\u2019s strategy is \u2018The Merge,\u2019 a landmark shift to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, first implemented in 2022. This transformative change marked Ethereum\u2019s shift from the energy-intensive proof-of-work model, showering a new era of efficiency and sustainability for the network. The Merge has been instrumental in Ethereum\u2019s progressive journey, significantly reducing its energy consumption and setting the stage for future innovations.\n\nInnovations and Market Response\n\nThe roadmap emphasizes Ethereum\u2019s commitment to enhancing blockchain stability and security. A key highlight is the focus on single-slot finality (SSF), a feature aimed at fortifying blockchain transactions. The roadmap addresses the Scourge priority, which focuses on mitigating economic centralization challenges, particularly in MEV (Miner Extractable Value) and liquid stake pooling.\n\nThese strategic developments have strengthened Ethereum\u2019s infrastructure and boosted market confidence. Consequently, there\u2019s growing anticipation of Ethereum reaching the $5,000 mark, driven by these roadmap revelations and positive market forecasts. Prominent crypto figure Raoul Pal and industry expert Arthur Hayes shared a recent video underscoring Ethereum\u2019s expanding influence and potential growth.\n\nTechnical Indicators and Market Trends\n\nEthereum\u2019s price analysis shows ETH has been fluctuating between $2,100 and $2,250 in recent months, exhibiting a bullish bias. The asset has surged over 90% in the past year, signaling the more buyers have been coming to the market.\n\nTechnical indicators reveal mixed signals as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the 4-hour chart suggests a balancing act between bearish and bullish forces. Meanwhile, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) hints at a potential trend reversal. The convergence of the 50-day and 200-day moving averages indicates a long-term bullish trend. The narrowing of Bollinger Bands points towards reduced volatility, possibly setting the stage for an upcoming price surge.\n\nEthereum Continues Trading Above $2,200 Amid Bearish Pressure\n\nIn the 4-hour chart, the Ethereum price has been trading around the $2,200 mark where buyers successfully defended against a further drop. This support zone triggered a rebound, with ETH climbing back to a supply zone at $2,304. Notably, this level has seen the formation of several double bottoms, a potential bullish reversal pattern.\n\nETH\u2019s recent trading session witnessed Ethereum bulls gaining enough strength to breach and the prices nearly broke the minor resistance at $2,400. Following this breakout, ETH ascended to an intraday high of $2,371, aligning closely with the 10-simple moving average, which currently sits at $2,317.\n\nThe broader market sentiment, as indicated by 25 major indicators, leans heavily towards a bullish bias with 15 indicators signaling \u2018buy\u2019, 9 staying neutral, and only 2 suggesting \u2018sell\u2019. Oscillators present a more mixed view with 8 neutral, 2 sell, and 1 buy signals. The Moving Averages echo the bullish sentiment strongly, with 14 buys, 1 neutral, and no sells. However, the MACD remains negative at 35.3 on the 4-hour chart, indicating a sell signal, while the RSI at 54.9 is in the neutral zone.\n\nLooking ahead, the bulls are targeting the $2,400 level, following a decisive move above the 10-day EMA 10 ($2,291.9). Should the bears take full control at current levels, ETH might retreat to its main support at EMA 100 ($2,038.39). A failure to hold this support could see Ethereum descend towards EMA 50 and SMA 50, around $2,170. Such a move would open the possibility of a downturn below the $2,000 threshold, a crucial psychological level for the market.\n\nAlso read:"

If you encounter any issues, kindly report them to [email protected]. Crypto assets/products can be highly risky. Never invest unless you\u2019re prepared to lose all the money you invest.\n\nDespite the current market surge since mid-October, Ethereum has recently been trading below the $2,500 resistance. Investors are now wondering what will boost the price of ETH above the $2,500 level.\n\nMeanwhile, InQubeta has emerged as the best crypto investment for retail investors. The price of the coin has increased by 150% to $0.01925, enticing average investors from all around the cryptoverse.\n\nCan Ethereum (ETH) Soar Past $2,500?\n\nEthereum (ETH) has been on an upward rise since October 12th and has stayed above $2,100 throughout December. Currently, Ethereum is facing a significant challenge at the $2,500 mark.\n\nDespite several attempts to surpass this mark, it has failed. However, this time around, there\u2019s a growing sense of optimism among investors that Ethereum will finally cross this resistance.\n\nThe main reason why investors are feeling positive again is due to the excitement surrounding the Ethereum ETF. There is a belief that the launch of an Ethereum ETF could lead to a rise in the price of Ether beyond $2,500.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s a twist: the US SEC has decided to delay the decision on the Ethereum ETF until March 2024. Due to the delay, Ethereum\u2019s prospects remain unaffected\n\nAccording to @Mangyek0, the upward trend of Ethereum will likely continue, and based on positive indicators from the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the Awesome Oscillator (AO), it is possible that Ethereum will surpass the $2,500 target.\n\nCurrently, Ethereum is being sold at $2,300. The price of the token has risen by 100% in the last year. Many believe that Ethereum is one of the best coins to invest in, given that its current value is less than $2,500.\n\nInQubeta (QUBE) Captures Retail Investors\u2019 Interest\n\nInQubeta (QUBE) has made a name for itself as the world\u2019s first crypto crowdfunding platform dedicated to AI startups. The platform has made it much easier for AI startups to fund and connect with the public. Additionally, InQubeta is gaining popularity among retail investors who are looking for lucrative investment opportunities in the crypto market.\n\nMany people are buying into InQubeta because they believe in the project\u2019s future potential. It is currently in stage 6 with a token costing $0.01925, and the presale has accumulated more than $7.7 million.\n\nThis indicates a massive amount of interest from investors and traders. InQubeta is also creating an NFT marketplace for AI startups. Minting NFTs out of investment opportunities will allow AI startups to exhibit their potential to investors who can then buy them.\n\nThe inclusion of fractional NFTs enables more individuals to engage in AI startups with any amount they have. This makes it easy for them to invest according to their income. The QUBE ERC20 coin from InQubeta also gives other advantages like staking and governance. Holders can stake their QUBE tokens to avail the tokens from a 5% sell tax.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nThe postponement of an Ethereum ETF\u2019s approval has caused the crypto community to wonder what will push the altcoin past $2,500.\n\nMeanwhile, the increase in the attention of retail investors towards QUBE tokens indicates that they have faith in the project.\n\nVisit InQubeta Presale\n\nJoin The InQubeta Communities"

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH)\u2019s recent surge in momentum encountered a significant obstacle upon reaching a pivotal resistance area. As a result, it captured the attention of analysts. Alongside it, the Litecoin (LTC) crypto has also gone upwards and could reach new heights. Yet, the most significant attention is given to Pullix (PLX), which has strolled through stage 4 of its presale after launching less than a month ago.\n\nEthereum (ETH) to Reach Over $4,000 in 2024\n\nEthereum (ETH) witnessed a robust uptrend that resulted in a weekly peak at $2,335. This underscores the prevailing influence of buyers in the market. The upward trajectory is further emphasized by the golden cross on the daily chart that signals an overall bullish sentiment for the Ethereum crypto.\n\nCrypto analyst Shayan Navabi conducted an analysis where a close inspection of the chart revealed that amid recent sideways movements, the price of the Ethereum altcoin found robust support in the critical range between $2,211 and $2,166 on the Fibonacci retracement indicator. It served the role as a barrier, preventing further downward attempts.According to the Ethereum price prediction, it can reach $4,056.67 in 2024.\n\nLitecoin (LTC) to Face $80 Resistance and Surge Above $130\n\nLitecoin (LTC) is another notable altcoin that made major waves this year. The value of Litecoin was at an uptrend structure and revealed a possible sign of recovery as it neared the $80 price level.\n\nLitecoin is set for a colossal surge as it is gearing up to crack this critical resistance level and rocket towards new peaks from the support zone. During the past week, LTC witnessed an upswing from $69.24 to $77.16. According to the Litecoin price prediction, it can surge as high as $134.42 by the end of 2024.\n\nPullix (PLX) to Feature a DeFi and NFT Launchpad\n\nPullix (PLX) is growing in popularity as it will introduce elements to the TradFi space that can solve key issues. For example, most DEXs have faced liquidity issues, which have resulted in a lack of mainstream adoption. However, Pullix will resolve these issues by introducing a community-driven approach.\n\nBy utilizing the platform, users are able to participate in yield farming, staking, and even liquidity provision. Other features include futures, CFDs, and a value for secure storage of cryptocurrencies. Anyone can also access a lending protocol and get passive income while also accessing a DeFi and NFT launchpad.\n\nPLX is the native crypto in its blockchain ICO phase that has massive utility, as it\u2019s used as a revenue-sharing mechanism. This means that users can profit from the daily revenue of the exchange and earn a fixed passive income. This is done through providing liquidity to automated market makers, and as a result, it\u2019s seen as one of the best cryptos to buy.\n\nSummary\n\nAside from Ethereum and Litecoin, another crypto that can see an upswing in its value is Pullix. So far, the blockchain ICO has reached Stage 5, where a single PLX crypto trades at $0.07. At launch, analysts project a price upswing of 100x, making it one of the best cryptos to buy for 2024 and beyond.\n\nFor more information regarding Pullix\u2019s presale see links below:\n\nVisit Pullix\n\nJoin The Pullix Communities\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "2024-01-01 | Press Release | Donald Trump Selling Ethereum (ETH) Amidst Price Surge, PancakeSwap (CAKE ... - Stockhouse Publishing",
        "content": "(NewsDirect)\n\nRecently, there have been some exciting developments in the DeFi market, as Donald Trump reportedly sold some of his Ethereum (ETH) holdings while it surged. Meanwhile, PancakeSwap (CAKE) has revealed a proposal that could change its tokenomics to the core. And finally, Meme Moguls (MGLS) - the Stage Three presale star, has unveiled its new tier system. Let\u2019s see why so many experts believe MGLS is the next 100x altcoin in 2024.\n\nEthereum News\n\nThe on-chain analytics platform Arkham recently revealed that indications suggest Donald Trump might have been selling his Ethereum (ETH) holdings. They said Trump transferred 1,075 ETH, valued at $2.4M, to Coinbase.\n\nThis is a strange move as the Ethereum crypto has recently experienced growth from $2,261 on December 21 to $2,372 on December 28. Additionally, over 26 technical indicators are showing green for this altcoin.\n\nDue to all these reasons, market analysts project that Ethereum could trade at the $2,628 level in January 2024.\n\nPancakeSwap (CAKE): New Proposal\n\nPancakeSwap (CAKE) has announced a new proposal to slash its supply from 750M to 450M. With this development, the PancakeSwap exchange signals the transition from a high-inflation emissions model to the Ultrasound CAKE era.\n\nAfter this PancakeSwap news, its value jumped from $3.50 to $3.87 in just a few hours on December 28. This bullish trend may continue as PancakeSwap is now trading above its 50 and 100-day EMAs - good bullish signs.\n\nExperts in the crypto field foresee its value reaching $4.24 in January 2024. This makes CAKE one of the altcoins to watch.\n\nMeme Moguls (MGLS) : Tier System Makes It One of the Top Altcoins\n\nMeme Moguls (MGLS) has been making headlines recently, raising over $1M during Stage Three of its presale. To thank its community, Meme Moguls revealed its tier system. This tier system ranges from $500-1000 holdings (Bronze VIP) to $50,000+ holdings (Meme Whale). Each tier will have perks like monthly bonuses and the ability to speak to a team member.\n\nAt its core, Meme Moguls will introduce utility to the meme coin sector. It aims to accomplish this by creating a unique play-to-earn (P2E) game where its native token, MGLS, is used as governance and in-game currency. Holding this token is also crucial as it will allow you to make decisions about the future of Meme Moguls and staking rewards.\n\nIn the Meme Moguls game, you will learn all there is to know about investments and wealth-building. It also brings various features, including simulated investing and head-to-head battles. An in-game Marketplace will also be available, allowing you to buy, sell, or trade the items you collect.\n\nGlobal investors are flocking to this crypto ICO event as one MGLS token costs only $0.0025 - a 31% ROI for those who bought it early. Given that Statista predicts the meme industry will be valued at $6.1B by 2025 - this DeFi project\u2019s long-term growth potential is stellar. Experts predict it may surge to $0.19 in 2024, a 100x ROI if you buy it now. If interested, now is the perfect time to purchase it, as you will also obtain a 15% deposit bonus.\n\nConclusion\n\nAlthough all three of these altcoins are worth monitoring, one stands out - Meme Moguls. Thanks to its low market cap of $7.5M, MGLS will experience a faster price growth than Ethereum and PancakeSwap as they have market caps of $287B and $1B. In other words, they need a large influx of new funds for their prices to see noticeable growth. Thus, MGLS is one of the best cryptos to invest in.\n\nVisit Meme Moguls\n\nMeme Moguls and all cryptocurrencies are subject to significant price fluctuations and volatility. Investing in or holding Meme Moguls tokens carries substantial risks, including the potential for total loss. Past performance should not be considered indicative of future results.\n\nContact Details\n\nMeme Moguls\n\ncontact@mememoguls.com\n\nCompany Website\n\nhttps://mememoguls.com/\n\nCopyright (c) 2024 TheNewswire - All rights reserved."

        "title": "BitMex Co-Founder Picks Ethereum over Solana, Chainlink Staking Reaches New Milestone, Everlodge Projected 10x ... - CryptoDaily",
        "content": "Table of Contents\n\nAs the end of 2023 draws close, investors are shifting focus to the upcoming year, and many are seeking diverse investment opportunities especially in the crypto space. With the altcoin season still in full swing, attention is firmly fixed on high-performing digital assets. Notably, Ethereum (ETH), Chainlink (LINK), and Everlodge (ELGD) have emerged as standout altcoins to keep a close eye on, given their remarkable performance in recent months. Let's delve deeper into these exciting investment prospects.\n\nBitMex Co-founder Stays Confident on Ethereum (ETH) Over Solana\n\nArthur Hayes, co-founder of BitMEX, shared that he has made a bold move across to Ethereum (ETH). Despite the impressive performance of Solana (SOL) in the market, Hayes opted to sell his SOL holdings and allocate more resources towards Ethereum (ETH). In a post on X, Hayes expressed his inspiration to support Vitalik Buterin's Ethereum, particularly in light of the rising prices of SOL.\n\nHayes didn't just stop at the switch; he also made a bold prediction, foreseeing the Ethereum price reaching $5,000. During the first and second quarters of 2023, Bitcoin (BTC) experienced significant institutional interest, thanks to the rise of spot ETC applications. In contrast, Ethereum struggled with slower numbers, extending into Q3 despite the buzz surrounding the futures ETF.\n\nStill, Ethereum's recent performance may align with Hayes' positive view. In early December 2023, Ethereum's price surged, crossing $2,100 in value.\n\nChainlink Staking v0.2 Sees Over 11 Million Tokens Staked\n\nChainlink (LINK), the top decentralized oracle network, just rolled out a significant upgrade to its staking protocol, known as Staking v0.2. The launch sparked a surge of activity, with over 11 million Chainlink tokens staked within just 30 minutes of going live.\n\nThis buzz around Staking v0.2 reflects a robust belief in Chainlink's prospective growth.\n\nChainlink's price has been trailing behind market leaders like Bitcoin and Solana. With a modest 7.95% increase in the last 30 days, it falls short compared to the broader market trends.\n\nEverlodge (ELDG) is Predicted to 10X on Launch\n\nEverlodge (ELDG) is an emerging player in the DeFi market, aiming to revolutionize real estate ownership by turning properties such as vacational homes and hotels into fractional NFTs. This distinctive approach allows investors to acquire these properties at a reduced cost, with the value of the NFTs directly linked to the underlying properties.\n\nHere's what the process looks like in theory: The platform tokenizes vacation properties into fractional NFT items, making property acquisition affordable for all investors regardless of financial status. Plus, you can use these NFTs as collateral for loans as well as stake the proceeds in the ecosystem\u2019s liquidity pool.\n\nCurrently, in the eighth stage of its presale, the platform's native cryptocurrency, ELDG, is priced at 0.027. Analysts have also predicted Everlodge to be among the best cryptocurrency investments to watch out for ahead of 2024 considering its potential to reach 10X on launch.\n\nLooking ahead, Ethereum, Chainlink and Everlodge have established significant potential for high yields and are noteworthy options to consider when seeking the best crypto investments to add to your portfolio.\n\nFor more context, Ethereum's enduring relevance within the crypto community enhances its value and attractiveness, while Chainlink's innovative solutions hold the potential to drive its prices to new heights. Additionally, Everlodge's practical utility establishes a robust foundation of financial security for your investment.\n\nVisit Everlodge\n\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored press release and is for informational purposes only.

        "title": "Renowned Crypto Analyst Predicts The Top 5 Altcoins For 2024 - TradingView",
        "content": "In a recent YouTube video, Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe, a highly respected figure in the crypto analysis sphere, disclosed his top 5 altcoin picks for 2024. Van de Poppe, known as founder of Eight Global, emphasized the importance of a balanced approach over speculative bets on lesser-known altcoins. He stated, \u201cI don\u2019t believe in getting into very small altcoins to maximize the risk. Compounding your returns with a proper strategy benefits in the long run.\u201d\n\nEthereum (ETH) \u2013 The Primary Crypto Choice\n\nVan de Poppe\u2019s foremost recommendation is Ethereum. The crypto analyst rationalizes this choice by pointing out the crowded space Bitcoin currently occupies, suggesting a shift of focus to altcoins. He articulated, \u201cBitcoin has been seeing a lot of upside already [caused by the spot ETF hype] \u2026 it\u2019s getting a little bit overcrowded and I think the upside is relatively capped.\u201d\n\nHe added that Ethereum is currently bottoming out against Bitcoin. \u201cI think that Ethereum is undervalued at this point because there is a deflationary system involved.\u201d His belief in Ethereum stems from its fundamental growth and the deflationary aspect of its economic model.\n\nWith regards to the 3-day ETH/USDT chart, he commented: \u201cEthereum holds a crucial level at $2,150 and is ready to continue the upwards path. Likely, we\u2019ve bottomed on the ETH/BTC pair and have peaked on the Bitcoin dominance.\u201d\n\nNewsBTC\n\nScalability Solutions \u2013 Arbitrum and Optimism\n\nDelving deeper into the Ethereum ecosystem, van de Poppe highlighted the importance of scalability solutions. He sees Arbitrum as an attractive crypto investment, especially given its current stage and potential for growth.\n\n\u201cArbitrum has not much price action yet, which is tricky, but can give you a very interesting investment thesis,\u201d he explained, underscoring its upward trend against Bitcoin. \u201cRetest at $0.98 did work, continuation towards $1.35 as well and even further. Some beautiful S/R flips, I think $1.40-1.45 should hold and we can continue to $2,\u201d he stated.\n\nOptimism is his second scalability solution choice, albeit with a cautionary note on its recent substantial run. Van de Poppe recommends a dollar-cost averaging strategy for Optimism, noting \u201cthe hype is already substantial here\u2026 buying a portion on every 10 cents that\u2019s dropping to make sure that you get a nice average entry.\u201d\n\nChainlink (LINK) \u2013 The Dark Horse\n\nChainlink (LINK) emerged as his fourth pick. Van de Poppe sees its prolonged bear market and early peak against Bitcoin in 2020 as indicators of significant potential, especially in conjunction with DeFi, RWA, and NFTs. \u201cChainlink\u2026 has been going into the longest bear market that it existed\u2026 cycles will happen, and that\u2019s why the opportunity costs are big,\u201d the crypto analyst remarked.\n\n\u201cChainlink shows that the markets are looking for a higher low on the BTC pairs. Bitcoin pairs show strength in altcoins and are a key indicator in bull markets. As long as LINK stays above 0.000253 BTC, it\u2019s fine and we can start targeting 0.006 BTC,\u201d van de Poppe noted.\n\nNewsBTC\n\nSUI \u2013 The New Competitor\n\nThe final altcoin in van de Poppe\u2019s selection is SUI, a newer project he compares to successful platforms like Phantom, Avalanche, and Matic. He advises on investing in Ethereum competitors, asserting, \u201cThe final one that I am going to explain here is SUI, which is currently also starting to trend upwards. I\u2019m not sure what it is going to hold though, but outside of the Ethereum ecosystem and DeFi corner.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cI want to be investing into competitors of Ethereum and you can choose SUI, DOT, ATOM, all those projects. I would like to choose something that\u2019s relatively new, SUI.\u201d\n\nLooking at the 1-day chart of SUI/BTC, the crypto analyst stated: \u201cThe ecosystems are heating up, and SUI is waking up alongside ARB and OP. Looking for the BTC pair here, which is ready to do a beautiful retest at the 0.00001710 area. If that holds, an uptrend likely starts to 0.00003000 BTC.\u201d\n\nNewsBTC\n\nCrypto Portfolio Distribution And Strategy\n\nVan de Poppe suggests a balanced portfolio distribution, advocating for a larger allocation to more established coins: 40% in Ethereum, 20% in Chainlink, and smaller portions in Arbitrum and Optimism (each 15%) as well as SUI (10%). He also emphasized the need for a dynamic approach to trading and profit-taking, saying, \u201cTrading is a lot about being flexible and having a flexible mindset.\u201d"

        "title": "Solana's Surge Above $100 Shows Ethereum Now Has Major Competition, But Could This New Altcoin Outpace Them? - CryptoDaily",
        "content": "Table of Contents\n\nWhile Ethereum has remained the unrivaled top altcoin for a long time, Solana's recent surge above $100 is a strong indication that it could become a major competitor. In 2023 alone, the price of Solana has increased by more than 950%, while Ethereum has managed only 100%.\n\nAs the big names lock horns, a new DeFi project has emerged as the potential dark horse for the bull market. After building substantial traction in December, does Meme Moguls (MGLS) have what it takes to outpace the current market leaders?\n\nEthereum Now Has a Worth Competitor in Solana (SOL)\n\nSolana (SOL) has been the standout performer in 2023, outperforming the rest of the market. The price of Solana has increased by more than 950% since the start of the year. In December, SOL rallied as high as $120, becoming one of the top 5 cryptocurrencies in the process.\n\nThis rally has piqued excitement about the altcoin among market experts. According to experts, Solana now looks like a worthy competitor of Ethereum. Unlike Ethereum's large market capital, SOL has attracted many investors due to its exceptional growth.\n\nThe recent discussion by David Hoffman and Ryan Adams emphasizes why they believe Solana is going to be a very strong competitor against Ethereum. It is considered to be a better cryptocurrency network because it offers the tradeoff with higher efficiency, lower fees, and faster speed.\n\nThese features have helped the Solana network become one of the most active hubs for meme coins and other top DeFi coins. As this growth extends in 2024, Ivan on Tech has predicted that the price of Solana could reach $200 in January. However, there is a new altcoin challenger, Meme Moguls.\n\nCan Meme Moguls (MGLS) Outperform the Top Altcoins in 2024?\n\nMeme Moguls (MGLS) has captured the interest of investors in December largely because of its uniqueness. As its name suggests, the project is built around memes; however, this new DeFiproject has introduced the crypto space to a one-of-a-kind ecosystem.\n\nThe ecosystem is designed to help users improve their trading and memecoin-picking skills. Users will partake in virtual trading competitions using advanced trading strategies. The most profitable portfolios of users are rewarded.\n\nAnother element that has piqued users' interest is the \"wealth leaderboard\" of Meme Moguls. This feature was added to give the top 20 players a share of the platform's daily earnings. Because the benefits are in cash, Meme Moguls is an extremely profitable site.\n\nThe goal is to develop a friendly, competitive environment among its user base. This strategy was successful, as thousands of new members joined Meme Moguls in December. They have also given more than $1 million to the ecosystem's development.\n\nThe utility token of the ecosystem, MGLS, has responded in return, rallying to a new high of $0.0025 in December. However, as the platform debuts early in 2024, analysts have forecasted a 25x price surge.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nSolana's rally above $100 has confirmed claims that it could challenge Ethereum for the top altcoin position. Meanwhile, Meme Moguls (MGLS) continues to grow behind the scenes. However, the projections make MGLS one of the top 5 cryptocurrencies to buy ahead of the 2024 bull market.\n\nVisit Meme Moguls\n\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored press release and is for informational purposes only.

        "content": "(NewsDirect)\n\nCryptocurrency markets often move in response to various factors, including the sentiments and predictions of industry analysts. Recently, prominent crypto analyst Ali Martinez predicted a bearish Ethereum (ETH) price. This sparked reactions within the crypto community as they are now turning towards a new ICO in Stage 8 of its presale called Everlodge, which experts have pegged as the next 30x token in 2024. Let\u2019s find out more.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction\n\nAccording to Ali Martinez, Ethereum (ETH) has recently seen 200,000 ETH tokens (valued at around $460M) transferred to crypto exchange wallets. This transfer increase may cause the Ethereum price to experience volatility and significant changes soon. At this time, the Ethereum crypto is trading hands at $2,322 - a 4.31% rise from its price of $2,230 on December 21.\n\nThe technical analysis points to a bullish sentiment for Ethereum, as 29 technical indicators are in the green. Because of this, CoinCodex analysts forecast that the Ethereum price may reach $2,463 in January 2024.\n\nHowever, the uncertainty surrounding Ethereum is high at the moment. We will have to wait to determine if these large transfers dramatically impact Ethereum\u2019s price. Therefore, many traders are gravitating to a new ICO that may be more stable and with a higher growth ceiling.\n\nEverlodge (ELDG): One Of The Best DeFi Coins\n\nEverlodge (ELDG) is a crypto ICO that could disrupt markets. With its innovative features, it has the potential to reign supreme in the real estate market (valued at over $280T). Essentially, Everlodge will be the world\u2019s first NFT marketplace backed by real-world luxurious villas, hotels, and more.\n\nThis innovative approach will solve many issues found on other real estate investment platforms. For instance, compared to conventional real estate investments, NFTs offer enhanced liquidity. Everlodge will let you trade these NFTs on secondary markets, potentially facilitating faster entry and exit strategies.What makes them the best NFTs to buy is also the fact that these NFTs are fractionalized. Therefore, if you buy just one piece of it for prices as low as $100, you will gain passive income when the actual property gets rented out or its value appreciates.\n\nWhile the marketplace is the main attraction of this DeFi project, its team will also include other components in its ecosystem:\n\nLending: Marketplace property co-owners use property-backed NFTs as collateral, accessing short to medium-term loans.\n\nRewards Club: Members earn free stays at Everlodge properties, allowing for resale to generate additional income.\n\nLaunchpad: Unlock early access to upcoming projects in development, maximizing your potential return on investment (ROI).\n\nThe ELDG native token powers all these features and is used as the primary payment currency on Everlodge. Holding this token will bring you passive income via staking and discounts on trading fees. It is now worth just $0.027 in Stage 8 of its presale. Demand is high as over 12M tokens have been sold already, and early buyers are enjoying a 170% ROI.\n\nIf you wish to purchase it, now is the perfect time, as Everlodge offers a 10% deposit bonus. It may be the best crypto investment, with predictions of a 3,000% price pump after ELDG launches and hits exchanges.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhile Ethereum faces challenges, Everlodge may capitalize as its interest grows daily. It also gains a competitive edge if we look at its market cap, which now sits at $14.3M - drastically lower than Ethereum\u2019s $279B. This means that ELDG will only need $14.3M for its current price to double, bringing significant returns to buyers at a faster rate. Because of this, Everlodge looks to be the best DeFi crypto.\n\nVisit Everlodge\n\nEverlodge provides you with a seamless approach to fractional investing in vacation rentals, eliminating the complexities associated with traditional real estate investment. Our innovative platform revolutionizes the way people invest in second homes.\n\nContact Details\n\nEverldoge.io\n\nadmin@everlodge.io\n\nCompany Website\n\nhttps://everlodge.io/\n\nCopyright (c) 2024 TheNewswire - All rights reserved."
