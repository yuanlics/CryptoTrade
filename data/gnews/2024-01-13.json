        "summary": "  Blackrock CEO Larry Fink expressed support for an Ethereum ETF, but regulatory hurdles remain. Blackrock, Fidelity, and VanEck have filed for spot Ethereum ETFs, with VanEck's deadline set for May 23. SEC Chair Gary Gensler clarified that the approval of a spot bitcoin ETF does not necessarily open the door for other crypto asset ETFs, including Ethereum. The regulatory status of Ethereum as a security is a potential roadblock, with some arguing that it may be classified as an unregistered security. However, some legal experts believe that Ethereum's possible status as a security is a minority view, and diligent lawyering may address the issue in required statutory investor disclosures. The odds of a spot Ethereum ETF approval by May are currently pegged at 70%."

        "summary": "  The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is unlikely to approve spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the near future, according to investment bank TD Cowen. The SEC recently approved spot bitcoin ETFs after over a decade of rejections, but TD Cowen believes the agency will take a cautious approach when it comes to approving ETFs for other cryptocurrencies. The bank notes that SEC Chair Gary Gensler is taking a \"go-slow approach\" and will likely wait for more court rulings and legislative action before approving ETFs for other cryptocurrencies. Gensler's term ends in June 2026, and TD Cowen expects him to maintain a Democratic majority at the SEC until then, which could further delay the approval of spot Ethereum ETFs."
