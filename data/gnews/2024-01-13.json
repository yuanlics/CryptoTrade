        "title": "Blackrock CEO Larry Fink Sees A Case For Spot Ethereum ETF, But Will It Get Approval? - Investopedia",
        "content": "Key Takeaways Blackrock CEO Larry Fink said he \"sees value\" in an Ethereum ETF in a recent interview.\n\nBlackrock, Fidelity, VanEck, and others have already filed for spot Ethereum ETFs, with some of the final deadlines for decisions from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) scheduled for May.\n\nA spot Ethereum ETF approval may be more problematic than was the case with bitcoin, as there is the potential for Ethereum's underlying crypto asset to be classified as a security.\n\nBlackrock (BLK) CEO Larry Fink may have generated momentum for a spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF). However, the approval for such a product will likely face a big regulatory hurdle.\n\n\"I see value in having an Ethereum ETF. As I said, these are just stepping stones towards tokenization,\" Fink said in an interview with CNBC Friday morning, just a day after the first spot bitcoin ETFs began trading in the U.S.\n\n\n\nWhy Fink's Comments Matter To An ETH ETF?\n\nBlackrock originally changed how people thought about whether a spot bitcoin ETF would even be possible when the financial titan filed for their own offering in June 2023. They now have their own spot Ethereum ETF proposal as well. Many of the other same financial institutions, such as Ark, and Fidelity, that saw their spot bitcoin ETF products launch on Thursday, have also filed for spot Ether ETFs with the SEC.\n\n\n\nVanEck is first in line for the potential approval of their spot Ethereum ETF product, with a final deadline for a decision from the SEC set for May 23rd.\n\n\n\nETH ETF May Face Regulatory Hurdles\n\nWhile ether is often lumped in with bitcoin (BTCUSD) as the two major blue chip crypto projects, there are concerns that a spot ether ETF approval could be a more complex proposal. Much of the uncertainty around such a financial product has to do with the potential classification of ether (ETHUSD), which is the underlying crypto asset of the Ethereum system, as a security.\n\nWhen asked whether the approval of a spot bitcoin ETF could open the door for other crypto asset ETF approvals, such as a spot Ethereum ETF, SEC Chair Gary Gensler stated, \"I look at what we did this week as its cabined to one non-security, commodity called bitcoin.\"\n\nThat said, Brown Rudnick Partner Preston Byrne says there may not be many regulatory roadblocks to a spot Ethereum ETF approval. \"So far, the only American regulator to assert that Ethereum is a security in an enforcement action is the NYAG's office,\" Byrne told Investopedia. \"Ethereum's possible status as an unregistered security is a minority view, especially given the fact that the Ethereum Foundation's 2014 sale of Ether is now well past the statute of limitations. I would expect diligent lawyering to address the point in required statutory investor disclosures, but would not expect too much more regulatory interference beyond that.\"\n\nBloomberg ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas has pegged the odds of a spot Ethereum ETF approval by May at 70%.\n\nNotably, futures-based Ether ETF products are already available for trade in the U.S. market. However, these offerings have not gained much traction and originally launched without much interest from traders."

        "title": "SEC unlikely to approve spot Ethereum ETFs 'any time soon': TD Cowen - The Block",
        "content": "The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is not expected to approve spot Ethereum ETH +1.34% exchange-traded funds in the near future, according to the investment bank TD Cowen. The initial deadline for approving such funds is in May.\n\n\"Our expectation is that the agency will not be approving ETPs for other crypto tokens any time soon as we believe the SEC will want to gain experience from Bitcoin BTC +2.44% ETPs before it approves an Ethereum or other crypto token ETP,\" wrote TD Cowen Washington Research Group, led by Jaret Seiberg, in a note earlier this week. \"The wait might not be as long as 26 months, but it likely would be after the election.\"\n\nThe SEC approved spot bitcoin ETFs earlier this week after over a decade of rejections, and 26 months after greenlighting bitcoin futures ETFs in October 2021. The 2024 U.S. presidential elections are scheduled to be held in November.\n\nAfter the spot bitcoin ETF approvals, traders are now betting that spot Ethereum ETFs could be next in line to receive the green light as the price of ether has surged over the past week. While some analysts are more optimistic that spot ETH ETFs will get approved, others, like those at JPMorgan, aren't betting big. \"In our opinion, for the SEC to approve spot Ethereum ETFs in May, it would need to classify Ethereum as a commodity (similar to bitcoin) rather than a security,\" JPMorgan's Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou told The Block this week. \"This is far from given, and I wouldn't put more than a 50% chance to the SEC classifying Ethereum as a commodity before May.\"\n\nSeveral big firms, including BlackRock and Fidelity, have recently filed for spot ETH ETFs.\n\n'Gensler is in no hurry to act'\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nWhile approving spot bitcoin ETFs, SEC Chair Gary Gensler said that a federal court gave the agency little choice but to approve those funds as the SEC had lost in a legal case brought against it by Grayscale Investments. \"While we approved the listing and trading of certain spot bitcoin ETP shares today, we did not approve or endorse bitcoin,\" Gensler said at the time, adding that he maintains his view that \"the vast majority of crypto assets are investment contracts and thus subject to the federal securities laws.\"\n\nTD Cowen said it views the spot bitcoin ETF approval as consistent with its thesis that Gensler is \"taking a go-slow approach modeled over how the agency established rules for the ABS [asset-backed securities] market.\" The approval also \"does not expedite the schedule for crypto market structure legislation,\" the bank said.\n\n\"This does not change our expectations for crypto market structure. We believe it will require Congress to enact legislation to establish the framework for how tokens will be regulated, what type of disclosures will be required and which agency will be in charge of investor protections,\" TD Cowen said. \"Our view remains that Gensler sees enforcement actions and litigation as aiding that process by narrowing the issues that Congress must resolve.\"\n\nGensler's term ends in June 2026, and he could maintain a Democratic majority at the SEC until then, according to TD Cowen. \"It is yet another reason we believe Gensler is in no hurry to act,\" the bank said, adding that he has time to bring more cases and await more court rulings rather than trying to rush legislative action.\n\n\"This also lets the U.S. learn from other jurisdictions before enacting a regulatory regime that will be tough to change once adopted,\" the bank concluded."

        "title": "Ethereum Price Prediction: Key Levels to Focus If $ETH Enters New Correction - CoinGape",
        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction: The second largest cryptocurrency Ethereum(ETH) has been notably bullish this week likely attributed to the recent launch of the first spot Bitcoin ETF in the U.S market. Surprisingly, the ETH price surpassed the Bitcoin performance amid the ETF approval recording a 17.7% weekly growth. Amid this upswing, the coin buyers breached above the $2430 swing high, indicating the potential for a higher recovery.\n\nIs Ethereum Price Heading to $3000?\n\nThe ETH price will continue to walk an aggressive rally until the ascending support trendline is intact.\n\nThe rising prices may face supply pressure at $2700, followed by $3000\n\nThe intraday trading volume in Ether is $16.8 Billion, indicating a 14% loss.\n\nOver the past three months, the Ethereum price has exhibited a consistent upward trajectory, evidenced by an ascending trendline. Starting from a low of $1522, the price of the coin has experienced a remarkable surge of 77%, reaching a new high of $2717.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe periodic pullbacks within this rally suggest active buyer accumulation at lower price points, a crucial characteristic of a prolonged rally. Throughout December, the ETH price movement was predominantly lateral, as the market anticipated the approval of the spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nAs the US SEC approved BTC ETF trading on Wednesday, the ETH price jumped 10.21% to breach the overhead resistance of $2140 indicating the asset is poised for higher growth.\n\nMoreover, Larry Fink, the Chief Executive Officer of BlackRock, expressed support for the idea of introducing an Ethereum-based exchange-traded fund (ETF). This statement came shortly after the launch of the highly anticipated Bitcoin ETF. In a recent discussion on CNBC, Fink said, \u201cI see value in having an Ethereum ETF,\u201d. Later he also added, \u201cThese are just stepping stones towards tokenization and I really do believe this is where we\u2019re going to be going\u201d.\n\nFollowing the approval of the spot Bitcoin ETF, the prospects for a Spot Ethereum ETF have significantly increased, potentially setting the stage for substantial growth in Ethereum\u2019s value.\n\nKey Support To Watch in Market Correction\n\nBy the press time, Ethereum (ETH) is trading at $2,565, experiencing a slight retracement to retest the previously surpassed resistance level of $2,400. Should the price sustainably remain above this newly established support, there\u2019s potential for the ongoing recovery to extend towards targets of $2,700, followed by $3,000, and $3,281.\n\nConversely, in the event of a fresh correction in the ETH price, investors should pay close attention to the ascending trendline. This could present an opportunity for a strategic pullback, offering a potential entry point for those looking to capitalize on such market movements\n\nBollinger Band: An uptick in the upper boundary of the Bollinger Band indicator shows the buyers dominating the asset.\n\nAverage Directional Index: The daily ADX value of 19% indicates the last correction has managed to recover the exhausted bullish momentum.\n\nRelated Articles:"

        "content": "Discover how Ethereum\u2019s shift to PoS and liquid staking protocols transform blockchain technology and address the 32 ETH staking challenge.\n\nEthereum staking has revolutionized the way we use and interact with blockchain technology. With its security now relying on capital rather than computing power, Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) shift to proof-of-stake (PoS) offers numerous benefits, including a reported 99% reduction in the network\u2019s carbon footprint.\n\nHowever, it still presents several drawbacks, chief among them being the 32 ETH economic requirement for participants to run a dedicated node on the network.\n\nYou might also like: What is proof-of-stake (PoS)?\n\nLiquid staking protocols: what to look out for\n\nAs of January, 32 ETH is about $84,724. Not many would-be validators can easily afford that amount, especially in regions with lower incomes.\n\nAdditionally, staking funds become locked and lack liquidity, pushing stakers to join staking pools instead. These pools often prove more profitable than individual validators due to the advantages of smoothing effects, safety mechanisms, and insurance they offer.\n\nThe situation has led to a concentration of power on the Ethereum network, with a small number of stakers controlling a significant share of the blockchain. Since these entities hold most of Ethereum\u2019s validator keys, it gives them full control over crucial aspects like block production, transaction censorship, and MEV (maximal extractable value) choices.\n\nBreakdown of top depositors on Ethereum | Source: Etherscan\n\nAnd as these pools grow larger, they gain more strength, eroding the core decentralization principles of Ethereum. As a result, there have been calls for more decentralized and pocket-friendly solutions to address this concern.\n\nThis is where community-driven liquid staking protocols come in. These platforms offer a new way to stake ETH and enjoy the benefits of staking while maintaining liquidity and flexibility. To shed light on this groundbreaking trend, we sat down with the teams behind three emerging liquid staking protocols: ether.fi, Diva, and Tenderize.\n\nYou might also like: Vitalik Buterin unveils major overhaul of Ethereum staking\n\nether.fi: unlocking liquid staking\n\nEther.fi team has pioneered a non-custodial protocol that enables users to stake their ETH holdings while keeping their private keys securely in their possession.\n\nether.fi business model | Source: ether.fi\n\nAmong the people associated with this project is Arthur Hayes, an investor who actively contributes to ether.fi through his family office, Maelstrom.\n\nYou might also like: Arthur Hayes dumps Solana for Ether, cites divine inspiration\n\nWhen we asked the ether.fi team about their target audience, they responded,\n\n\u201cWe cater to individuals who have a keen interest in staking Ethereum.\u201d\n\nHowever, they also highlighted the regulatory uncertainties surrounding ETH staking in the United States. Consequently, ether.fi has temporarily geofenced U.S. users until the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) provides more precise guidance.\n\nYou might also like: Staking rewards are now taxable, says IRS\n\nThe ether.fi team prioritized security for their protocol, employing auditors like Nethermind, Omniscia, Zellic, and Solidified to enhance safety measures.\n\nEther.fi offers loyalty points and membership programs, providing rewards for users. The platform adopts a non-custodial approach, allowing users to maintain control over their keys, aligning with the principle of \u201cNot your keys, not your coins.\u201d\n\nTo tackle liquidity and volatility issues in staked tokens, ether.fi has made provisions for users to withdraw or trade their assets through the eETH liquidity pool.\n\nAs of Jan. 12, ether.fi was one of the major liquid staking protocols per the amount of ETH staked in the last six months.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/ether_fi/status/1745565800830763314\n\nDiva: another approach to liquid staking\n\nDiva, a liquid staking protocol that will be launched in 2024. Diva\u2019s distributed validator technology (DVT) allows the entire network to perform validation, reducing the risks associated with centralization. Per developers, Diva\u2019s security model, based on DVT, offers improved uptime and a diverse range of operators without requiring permission.\n\nDiva liquid staking model | Source: Diva on Medium\n\nIt provides an alternative to solo staking, which demands 32 ETH per validator and requires considerable technical expertise. Diva\u2019s operator union model makes staking more accessible by allowing users to lock as little as 1 ETH while providing better rewards and flexibility, according to the protocol\u2019s developers.\n\nThe platform engages its community through Discord channels, encouraging users to contribute to early testing and provide feedback. According to the team, the community plays a significant role in governance decisions, ensuring the protocol evolves in response to the needs and concerns of its users.\n\nThe Ethereum Shanghai upgrade has played a crucial role in accelerating the growth of liquid staking for ETH. This upgrade completed the circle for Diva, particularly by making liquid staking tokens (LSTs) fully functional. This functionality allows LSTs to trade closely to their fair value, significantly reducing the cost of providing liquidity in defi.\n\nYou might also like: Ethereum Shanghai upgrade for geeks: unpacking the tech side\n\nWith deep liquidity pools now more accessible, protocols like Diva may gain a competitive advantage over established players like Lido Finance.\n\nTo ensure the stability and liquidity of the stETH derivative token, Diva employs divETH tokens, which closely track ETH at a 1:1 ratio. This approach, combined with DVT-based security, is how Diva mitigates significant price deviations from ETH.\n\nThe protocol has also adopted a special approach to navigate legal challenges and ensure regulatory compliance globally. Instead of operating as a traditional company or platform, Diva positions itself as a pure software extension of Ethereum. Its immutable code, similar to contracts such as Wrapped ETH or Liquity, ensures that no central entity offers services or charges fees. Diva aims to establish regulatory equivalences by staking on Ethereum itself, simplifying compliance efforts.\n\nAt the time of writing, Diva has not yet launched. However, by offering an Operator Testnet Alpha and proposing a Pre-Launch Vault, Diva aims to encourage early commitments of total value locked (TVL) in ETH or stETH.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/divastaking/status/1737879212625719690\n\nTenderize: empowering validators\n\nTenderize is a liquid staking solution that allows any validator on the network to participate, potentially unlocking as much as $30 billion worth of crypto previously neglected in liquid staking.\n\nAccording to the Tenderize team, the platform has attempted to tackle issues of neglected assets by providing each validator with highly-liquid staked tokens, promoting decentralization in the ecosystem.\n\nTendirize ecosystem | Source: Tenderize website\n\nThe platform has a new upgrade dubbed Tenderize v2, and what sets it apart, in the words of its creators, is its self-custodial nature, which eliminates the need for intermediaries. It means users can swiftly exit staking through a native decentralized exchange (DEX), with the shared liquidity approach ensuring greater flexibility and liquidity access without centralizing stake on whitelisted nodes.\n\nMuch like Diva, the Ethereum Shanghai upgrade played a vital role in accelerating the growth of liquid staking for Tenderize, with the platform reportedly experiencing its fair share of positive impact.\n\nPrior to the upgrade, TenderSwap, a crucial component of the Tenderize protocol, faced limitations in facilitating unstaking. However, with the upgrade, users could unstake ETH, which paved the way for the launch of tETH through Tenderize v2.\n\nThe protocol emphasizes community involvement in its development, with Tenderize offering grants to validators and liquidity providers for their input and testing. The platform also involves token holders in governance decisions, such as fee and reward determination.\n\nIn liquid staking, addressing stability and liquidity concerns is crucial. Tenderize offers two methods for converting tTokens back to their original form.\n\nOne method is through TenderSwap v2, where users can exchange their tTokens (like tMATIC, tLPT, or tGRT) for the corresponding asset (MATIC, LPT, or GRT) at a 1:1 ratio, subject to a service fee. The alternative method requires waiting for the unstaking period to end, which varies by blockchain. Tenderize aims to maintain a 1:1 swap ratio on TenderSwap to manage price deviation risks and support user stability and liquidity.\n\nThe mainnet launch is scheduled at Jan. 29, according to Tenderize X account.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/tenderize_me/status/1745799023569879411\n\nLiquid staking protocols: the future of staking?\n\nEthereum staking represents a notable development in the cryptocurrency space, with various projects contributing to this trend. These projects enable users to stake amounts less than 32 ETH, supporting Ethereum\u2019s transition to proof-of-stake.\n\nAdditionally, these projects offer methods for users to liquidate their staked assets without undergoing a full withdrawal process, enhancing the flexibility of cryptocurrency staking.\n\nProjects supporting ETH staking below the 32 ETH threshold provide an opportunity for users to participate in staking with smaller investments.\n\nRead more: Ethereum applications take place as top gainers ahead of ETF announcement\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

This negative price movement comes after an initial price boost by the token which it gained by over 19% following news of the Bitcoin spot ETF approval in the US on Wednesday.\n\nInterestingly, popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez has offered more insight into ETH\u2019s developing downtrend, highlighting the next possible support zones for crypto\u2019s largest altcoin.\n\nEthereum May Be Headed For $2,450 \u2013 Analyst\n\nIn an X post on January 11, Martinez shared that the TD Sequential indicator presented a sell signal on the Ethereum 4-hour chart, which could possibly result in the altcoin\u2019s price falling to a support level of $2,530.\n\nFor context, the Tom Demark Sequential indicator is a popular TA tool used to identify trend exhaustion and predict possible trend reversals.\n\nAccording to Martinez, this analysis tool showed that ETH was due for a price correction following a price surge in which the asset traded above $2,700 in reaction to the US Securities and Exchange greenlighting the launch of Bitcoin spot ETFs on US securities markets.\n\nIf #Ethereum can\u2019t hold above $2,530, the next stop will be $2,450! https://t.co/wtjcdRTWnv \u2014 Ali (@ali_charts) January 12, 2024\n\nInterestingly, in a second post on January 12, the renowned crypto analyst doubled down on this prediction stating that if the ETH bulls failed to keep the coin\u2019s value above $2,530, there was a chance the token could trade as low as $2,450.\n\nAccording to Martinez, ETH\u2019s current negative price movement appears to be a mere correction which is likely true as the general investor sentiment around the altcoin remains bullish.\n\nEarlier this week, NewsBTC reported that ETH investors are hyped with the expectation of an Ether spot ETF in the US following the SEC\u2019s clearance of 11 Bitcoin spot ETF applications on Wednesday. Considering ETH\u2019s rank as the second-largest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin, as well as the rising number of Ether spot ETF applications, investors believe the altcoin may be in line for the SEC\u2019s favor.\n\nETH\u2019s Price Overview\n\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum was trading at $2,548 with a slight decline of 2.67% in the last day. However, the altcoin has shown an overall bullish performance in the last week, with a notable gain of 14.48%. Adding to this positive narrative, there is also an uptick in ETH\u2019s daily volume by 22.25% which is currently now valued at $26.8 billion.\n\nETH trading at $2,553 on the daily chart | Source: ETHUSDT chart on Tradingview.com\n\nFeatured image from Forbes, chart from Tradingview\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

If you encounter any issues, kindly report them to [email protected]. Crypto assets/products can be highly risky. Never invest unless you\u2019re prepared to lose all the money you invest.\n\nEthereum, often regarded as the backbone of the decentralised finance (DeFi) ecosystem and a primary driver of the crypto market, is currently experiencing a resurgence that has caught the attention of investors and enthusiasts alike. After a rollercoaster ride, Ethereum has not just survived but thrived, with its price surging from $1,600 and smashing past the $2,000 barrier. With the next obstacle at $2,400, the question on everyone\u2019s minds is whether Ethereum is gearing up for a new breakout. Adding fuel to the fire of Ethereum\u2019s resurgence is the improving sentiment in the crypto market, largely driven by high expectations surrounding the potential approval of the Bitcoin Spot ETF. As a result, the price of ETH has been skyrocketing. As of the latest data, ETH\u2019s price action reveals the formation of a bullish flag pattern due to the consolidation between the $2,200 support and the $2,400 resistance. With Ethereum dropping hints of further breakouts, buyer enthusiasm is growing, suggesting a potential bullish trend for 2024.\n\nETH Price Prediction for January 2024\n\nEthereum\u2019s price has been engaged in a tantalising game of tug-of-war, struggling to establish a definitive trend over the past 30 days. However, the recent market-wide recovery aligns well with bullish ETH price predictions. All eyes are currently on the $2,400 barrier, which buyers are eagerly eyeing to breach. Despite experiencing a slight retreat from the New Year\u2019s rally, ETH has managed to avoid the sharp declines witnessed in other smaller-cap altcoins. The robust buying activity around the $2,200 support level is fueling this resilience. At the time of writing, ETH is trading at $2,432, with a minor intraday pullback following a significant overnight surge. The consistent bouncing off the $2,200 mark keeps hopes alive for a breakout beyond $2,400. The current technical landscape suggests that Ethereum is on the verge of a bullish breakout. The formation of a bullish flag pattern in the daily chart, a classic trend continuation indicator, points to the potential for a surge beyond the $2,400 level. With a recent test of the $2,400 resistance and a growing likelihood of surpassing $2,500, Ethereum may well be on its way to $2,700. However, traders should remain cautious, as a reversal could send ETH tumbling back to the $2,200 support zone.\n\nETH Price Prediction 2024\n\nEthereum market price has shown remarkable recovery, forming an ascending triangle pattern in the weekly chart. After bouncing off the psychological barrier of $1,000 in November 2022, the uptrend has continued to gain momentum in the Ethereum weekly chart. Despite facing consistent rejection at the $2,100 barrier, buyers are making efforts for a bullish breakout, fueled by the recent Uptober rally of 2023. Having surged past the overhead resistance, the ETH price has broken through the $2,200 barrier. Moreover, this breakout rally signals a prolonged uptrend and avoids a death cross in the weekly chart. If buyers successfully push Ethereum\u2019s market value above $2,200, the continuation of the bull run could lead to exponential growth in 2024. With potential Spot ETF approvals and the potential impact of the Bitcoin Halving on altcoins, Ethereum\u2019s price could potentially reach $3,825.\n\nRetik Finance: Paving the Way for DeFi Excellence in 2024\n\nWhile Ethereum\u2019s resurgence and price predictions are garnering significant attention, there is another player in the crypto space that is creating a path for itself to outperform altcoins in 2024.

        "content": "BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink is supporting the creation of spot Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\n\nIn a new interview on CNBC\u2019s Squawk Box, Fink says that after spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs were just approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), it would be worthwhile for the agency to also approve spot ETH ETFs.\n\nFink also believes that tokenization in the financial space could result in a crackdown on corruption, such as money laundering.\n\n\u201cI see value in having an Ethereum ETF. As I said, these are just stepping stones towards tokenization. And I really do believe this is where we\u2019re going to be going. We have the technology to tokenize today. Think about this, if you had a tokenized security and you have a tokenized identity, you Andrew [Sorkin], the moment you buy or sell an instrument, it\u2019s known, it\u2019s on a general ledger that is all created together. You want to talk about issues around money laundering and all that, this eliminates all corruption by having a tokenized system.\u201d\n\nFink adds that he believes Bitcoin is a safe store of value similar to how gold was historically during times of uncertainty.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a believer in [Bitcoin] because I do believe it is an alternative source for wealth holding. I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s ever going to be a currency. I believe it\u2019s an asset class. I think we\u2019re going to create digital currencies. We\u2019re going to use the technology for it. We\u2019re going to use the blockchain\u2026\n\nI believe [Bitcoin] goes up if the world is more frightened, if people are fearful of geopolitical risk, if they\u2019re fearful of their own risk. It\u2019s no different than what gold represented over thousands of years. It is an asset class that protects you.

        "title": "Forget XRP: This Crypto Could Be Unstoppable in 2024 - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "At the end of December, Solana (CRYPTO: SOL) flipped XRP (CRYPTO: XRP) to become the fifth-most valuable cryptocurrency. This capped off an impressive run for Solana in 2023. At one point, Solana was up more than 1,000% for the year.\n\nAll this has me thinking it's finally time to forget about XRP. The former crypto market darling is still bogged down in litigation with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Until that regulatory matter is cleared up, XRP shows no signs of breaking through the $1 price level. Contrast that to Solana, which now seems to have a very bright future ahead of it. Let's take a closer look.\n\nSolana is on pace to topple Ethereum\n\nThe primary investment thesis for Solana is that it is the new Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH). Since 2020, crypto investors have been touting Solana as a potential \"Ethereum killer,\" and that scenario now seems to be finally playing out. While there are plenty of other Layer 1 blockchain challengers out there, Solana seems to be the one with the best chance of displacing Ethereum.\n\nSimply stated, Solana is a faster, cheaper, more efficient version of Ethereum. While Ethereum had to pull off a very complicated technical transformation (known as The Merge) to become an energy-efficient, proof-of-stake blockchain back in 2022, Solana launched right out of the box as a proof-of-stake blockchain. Whether it's transaction processing speed or overall transaction throughput, Solana seems to have the superior technology.\n\nGranted, the \"best technology\" does not always win. There are a lot of other factors to consider, including first-mover advantage and network effects. That's why Solana has taken nearly four years to finally catch up to Ethereum. But the investment narrative around Solana certainly seems to be shifting. A number of very smart investors -- including Cathie Wood of Ark Invest -- now seem to buy into the idea of Solana as a faster, more cost-efficient version of Ethereum.\n\nStory continues\n\nSolana has some big-time growth catalysts in place\n\nWhile Ethereum has been around longer than Solana, Solana has one thing Ethereum does not: a mobile crypto strategy. First announced back in the summer of 2022, this mobile crypto strategy has steadily been taking shape over the past 18 months.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nLast May, Solana finally launched the first-ever mobile crypto phone, the Saga. The goal of the crypto phone was to usher in a new mobile-first approach to crypto. Think about it -- today's smartphones are not crypto-native. They are designed for neither crypto users nor crypto wallets or for buying non-fungible tokens (NFTs) while waiting in line for a coffee from your favorite barista. So, Solana -- led by a talented team of former Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM) engineers -- decided to change all that.\n\nThis mobile crypto strategy also includes a mobile payments component. In February 2022, Solana launched Solana Pay, a blockchain-based payment protocol for merchants who want to accept crypto at the point of sale. Again, this builds on a very intuitive idea: Some people want to pay with crypto, and most merchants want to avoid high credit card processing fees. As a proof-of-concept, Solana announced an integration with Shopify (NYSE: SHOP) at the end of August.\n\nYes, of course, these mobile crypto initiatives could absolutely fail. But they are the types of big-time growth catalysts that XRP simply does not have right now. As long as the legal drama with the SEC stretches on (which could be until the end of 2024), it's highly unlikely that XRP will be able to do much of anything in the U.S. market.\n\nAt the same time, the company behind the XRP token (Ripple Labs) is hemorrhaging cash to pay lawyers. According to Ripple executives, these legal costs could wind up being more than $200 million.\n\nBefore you dump all your XRP tokens\n\nWhile I'm highly confident that Solana could be an unstoppable crypto in 2024, there's also a chance that XRP could soar in price this year. Last summer, when XRP scored a major legal win in its ongoing SEC court case, the price of XRP doubled nearly overnight. So, there is upside potential. If you're currently holding XRP tokens, it could be worth waiting to see what develops.\n\nOver a long-term horizon, though, Solana appears to be a far superior investment. As soon as Solana flipped XRP at year-end, that should have been a wake-up call to XRP investors. It's finally time to look for a new crypto champion, and right now, that champion appears to be Solana.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Solana right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Solana, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Solana wasn't one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "content": "In a recent development in the volatile cryptocurrency space, an Ethereum whale has made a substantial move, transferring about 15,000 ETH, valued at approximately $37 million, to the leading crypto exchange, Coinbase. The blockchain transactions tracking platform, Whale Alert, brought attention to this significant transfer, igniting curiosity among crypto enthusiasts and triggering a drop in Ethereum\u2019s market price.\n\nEthereum Whale Move Triggers Concern On Price\n\nWhale Alert reported the transfer of 14,699 ETH, equivalent to $37.58 million, from an unknown wallet to Coinbase, raising eyebrows in the crypto community. This sizable movement seems to have impacted the current performance of Ethereum, as witnessed by the recent price of ETH.\n\nadvertisement\n\nOn the other hand, prominent crypto analyst Ali Martinez has also shared his views on the Ethereum price on the X platform recently. According to Martinez, if the ETH price cannot maintain its position above the $2,530 mark, it may witness a further slip to the $2,450 level.\n\nMeanwhile, the crypto market is now on edge as Ethereum currently flirts around the $2,550 mark. Notably, analysts and investors are closely monitoring Ethereum\u2019s price movements following this significant whale transaction.\n\nAlso Read: Binance Dethroned As Indian Traders Flock To Local Firms Amid Regulatory Scrutiny\n\nA Closer Look Into Price & Other Developments\n\nThe price concern is compounded by the observations from CryptoQuant data, revealing that Ethereum\u2019s Coinbase premium index, measuring the gap between Ethereum\u2019s dollar-denominated price on Coinbase and its USDT-denominated price on Binance, fell to -0.51, marking its lowest level since December 31, 2023.\n\nMeanwhile, this heightened Coinbase premium index adds another layer of uncertainty to Ethereum\u2019s short-term future, raising questions about potential further price drops. As the market anticipates the next move, crypto enthusiasts brace for potential turbulence, with the $2,450 threshold becoming a critical level to watch.\n\nNotably, as of writing, the Ethereum price traded at $2,554.15, down 1.42% over the last 24 hours. However, its trading volume from yesterday rose 26% to $24.22 billion at the same time. The ETH price has touched a high of $2,710.42 and a low of $2,460.93 over the last 24 hours.\n\nAlso Read: GameStop to Shutdown Its NFT Marketplace Amid Regulatory Scrutiny"

        "content": "The winds of change are swirling through the once-Bitcoin-dominated cryptocurrency landscape, as Ethereum (ETH) stages a stunning rally, leaving the reigning king, Bitcoin (BTC), in its wake.\n\nJust days after the highly anticipated approval of Bitcoin\u2019s spot ETF, a paradoxical scene unfolds: ETH soars 13.5%, scaling a 9-month high above $2,650, while BTC stumbles with a 10% dip. This unexpected turn of events has sent shockwaves through the crypto community, igniting a fierce debate \u2013 is Ethereum finally usurping Bitcoin\u2019s throne?\n\nWhile the Bitcoin ETF approval was initially heralded as a game-changer, its muted impact left investors bewildered. This begs the question: what hidden forces are propelling Ethereum\u2019s meteoric rise? Several factors seem to be fueling this ETH revolution:\n\nTech Titans Take Notice\n\nUnlike Bitcoin, often shrouded in an aura of anonymity and regulatory uncertainty, Ethereum is increasingly embracing a collaborative, future-oriented approach. Upcoming technological advancements like the \u201cDencun\u201d hard fork promise enhanced data availability and reduced transaction costs, while account abstraction paves the way for smoother user experiences and secure social logins.\n\nLarry Fink is already beating the Ethereum drum. One day after the Bitcoin launch. The rotation is real. https://t.co/5Ctvqqqauy \u2014 The Wolf Of All Streets (@scottmelker) January 12, 2024\n\nThese innovations are attracting the attention of tech giants like BlackRock, whose CEO, Larry Fink, recently expressed \u201cseeing value\u201d in a potential Ethereum ETF. This institutional validation adds significant fuel to the ETH fire.\n\nEthereum Staking Rewards And Scarcity\n\nUnlike its proof-of-work rival, Ethereum rewards its holders with attractive annualized staking rewards (around 4.3%). This incentivizes investors to lock up their ETH in the network, effectively reducing supply and pushing the price up. Additionally, Ethereum\u2019s issuance rate is slightly negative, further contributing to its scarcity and increasing its appeal as a valuable asset.\n\nEthereum currently trading at $2,540.5 on the daily chart: TradingView.com\n\nOutpacing The Competition\n\nWhile Bitcoin grapples with its identity crisis, Ethereum thrives in a bustling ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps) and blockchain-based projects. This vibrant network effect creates a self-reinforcing loop, attracting developers, users, and investors, and solidifying Ethereum\u2019s position as the go-to platform for innovation in the blockchain space.\n\nMeanwhile, direct competitors like BNB and SOL have encountered recent stumbles, further highlighting Ethereum\u2019s relative strength and resilience.\n\nEther/USD vs. BTC/USD, SOL/USD, and BNB/USD. Source: TradingView\n\nThe ETF Factor Looms Large\n\nThough still shrouded in uncertainty, the possibility of an Ethereum ETF approval later this year adds another layer of intrigue to the story. With BlackRock openly advocating for it, and regulatory hurdles potentially clearing by May, the prospect of an influx of institutional capital into the Ethereum market has investors salivating.\n\nHowever, the crypto world is as unpredictable as a rollercoaster. While Ethereum\u2019s current trajectory is undeniably impressive, challenges remain. Regulatory hurdles, potential network upgrades, and broader market fluctuations could all disrupt its momentum.\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin, though seemingly faltering, still boasts a massive market cap and a loyal following. It\u2019s too early to write off the digital gold just yet.\n\nThe battle for crypto supremacy has entered a fascinating new chapter. Ethereum, armed with technological prowess, staking rewards, and a burgeoning ecosystem, appears poised to challenge Bitcoin\u2019s long-held dominance.\n\nBut whether it can dethrone the king and claim the crown remains to be seen. This crypto saga, still unfolding with every traded byte, promises to keep us on the edge of our seats, wondering who will ultimately rule the digital kingdom.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

However, Panigirtzoglou conveyed his reservations, stating,\n\n\u201cThis is far from given, and I wouldn\u2019t put more than a 50% chance to the SEC classifying Ethereum as a commodity before May.\u201d advertisement\n\nComparison with Bitcoin ETFs\n\nThe context of this uncertainty stems from the SEC\u2019s recent move to approve spot Bitcoin ETFs, marking a significant shift after a decade of rejections. Ethereum\u2019s market dynamics have shown a notable surge, with a nearly 18% increase in its price over the last week. However, at press time, ETH had fallen under bearish pressure, exchanging hands at $2,591.62, a 0.82% decline from the intra-day high.\n\nDespite these positive market indicators and the success of Bitcoin ETFs, the SEC\u2019s approach to cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin remains cautious and, as Panigirtzoglou suggests, is still skewed towards viewing them as securities.\n\nImplications of Ethereum\u2019s Staking Protocols\n\nThe debate over Ethereum\u2019s classification is further complicated by its transition to staking protocols. SEC Chair Gary Gensler has previously indicated that tokens using such protocols could fall under the category of securities. This stance was evident during a congressional hearing last year, where Gensler refrained from categorically defining Ethereum\u2019s status.\n\nMoreover, while approving Bitcoin ETFs, Gensler\u2019s remarks did not hint at a similar openness towards other cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum.\n\nJPMorgan\u2019s Stance on Ethereum ETF Contradicted\n\nDespite JPMorgan\u2019s cautious outlook, other market analysts, like Bloomberg Intelligence\u2019s James Seyffart, hold a more optimistic view on the approval of Ethereum ETFs. The recent filings for spot ETH ETFs by major firms such as BlackRock and Fidelity underscore this optimism.\n\nMoreover,, BlackRock\u2019s CEO Larry Fink has acknowledged the potential for an Ethereum ETF in the United States following the successful launch of their Bitcoin ETF, which saw impressive trading volumes.\n\nRead Also: Bitcoin Price Slips 6% to Hit $43500, Is Sell-the-News Strategy in Action?"

        "content": "The US Securities and Exchange Commission finally greenlighted a spot Bitcoin ETF earlier this week, although in a slightly reluctant fashion.\n\nNow, speculations are starting to arise on when the agency will do the same in terms of an exchange-traded fund tracking the performance of the second-largest cryptocurrency.\n\nWhen ETH ETF?\n\n2023 will go down in history as the year with the most news and developments in terms of ETFs as numerous companies filed for such products for BTC and ETH. Perhaps the trend intensified after BlackRock did so in the middle of the year, and many others followed.\n\nWith already nearly a dozen BTC ETFs trading on US stock markets, the focus has now shifted to other cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum. Currently, several companies have filed to launch such products, including Grayscale, which is trying to convert its ETH Trust into a spot ETF, as it did with its flagship Trust \u2013 GBTC.\n\nThe SEC, though, keeps delaying the decision, with most applications now having to wait until May. History shows that the Commission tends to delay or reject crypto ETFs for years before it finally allows them to reach the markets, but will this be the case now as well?\n\nThe analytics platform Santiment took it to X to check with the community about their opinion on the matter. It turns out that the majority, over 52% in fact, believe the US will have a spot Ethereum ETF by the end of this year. Roughly 10% are even more optimistic, saying it will be greenlighted this month, while 11.3% don\u2019t see it happening ever.\n\n\ud83e\udd14 With several #Bitcoin #ETF\u2018s being approved by the #SEC Wednesday, there are growing hopes that #Ethereum and other assets will have their own ETF\u2019s approved next. When do you believe another asset, $ETH or otherwise, have their own ETF be officially accepted for public use? \u2014 Santiment (@santimentfeed) January 12, 2024\n\nPrice Effects?\n\nWe saw that BTC skyrocketed in the months ahead of the SEC approvals and even on the first day of trading. However, the trend reversed violently in the following day or so, and the asset slumped by almost $8,000 in 36 hours when the ETFs were already live for trading.\n\nThis has given those in camp \u201csell-the-news\u201d advantage so far. ETH, on the other hand, has just now started to increase in value, which could be a speculative run as many expect an ETF to arrive soon.\n\nAs such, it would be interesting to follow how ETH\u2019s price will perform in the months prior and after such a product is approved, if ever."

In a recent CNBC interview, Fink acknowledged the value of an Ethereum ETF, signaling a significant shift in institutional interest towards the cryptocurrency.\n\nBlackRock, commanding an impressive $10 trillion in assets under management, has highlighted the importance of these ETFs, envisioning them as pivotal connectors between traditional finance and the evolving crypto sector.\n\n\ud83d\udea8NEW: @BlackRock CEO Larry Fink to @FoxBusiness\u2019s @CGasparino on #Bitcoin: \u269c\ufe0fIf you\u2019re fearful of your government, or worrying your government is devaluing the currency, then you could see this as a great potential long-term store of value.

        "content": "United States regulators finally approved the highly awaited spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), with analysts expressing that this move opens up more opportunities for the cryptocurrency sector. Indeed, there is a bullish sentiment regarding the product\u2019s long-term impact, mainly due to its potential to attract institutional investors.\n\nIn this context, there are speculations that such a product will likely spill over to other cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum (ETH), the second-ranked cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Analysts are also speculating that there is a possibility of a spot Ethereum ETF getting approved in 2024.\n\nWith the product likely to impact the value of ETH, Finbold consulted the generative artificial intelligence (AI) tool ChatGPT by OpenAI to provide a possible price trajectory for Ethereum. If the product is approved, the tool offered bullish and bearish scenarios for Ethereum.\n\nBullish scenario\n\nAccording to the tool, if a spot Ethereum ETF secures regulatory approval, it could mark a pivotal moment for Ethereum. Increased institutional interest and mainstream adoption may attract investors seeking exposure to Ethereum without direct ownership.\n\nThe ETF\u2019s approval could generate a surge in demand, fostering positive sentiment and confidence in Ethereum.\n\nIn this optimistic scenario, ChatGPT pointed out that Ethereum\u2019s price might experience a significant surge but acknowledged the challenges of identifying the exact valuation of the asset. Nevertheless, the AI tool noted that the cryptocurrency could potentially reach levels above $3,000.\n\nThe tool, however, cautioned that the bullish outlook depends on market dynamics, institutional interest, and broader cryptocurrency trends.\n\nEthereum ChatGPT bullish price prediction. Source: ChatGPT.\n\nBearish scenario\n\nContrary to expectations, approving a spot Ethereum ETF might not guarantee sustained positive market sentiment. The tool suggested that traders and investors could opt to \u201csell the news,\u201d leading to a short-term price correction.\n\nAdditionally, regulatory uncertainties or concerns about the ETF\u2019s structure might create skepticism among market participants.\n\nChatGPT noted that Ethereum could face a temporary decline in a bearish scenario. The price might drop below its current trading levels, ranging from $2,300 to $2,000 or even lower, depending on the extent of market reactions.\n\nEthereum spot ETF Potential\n\nIndeed, prominent figures in the financial world suggest that an Ethereum ETF could be monumental. Specifically, BlackRock\u2019s (NYSE: BLK) CEO Larry Fink noted that he \u2018sees value\u2019 in a spot Ethereum ETF following the successful launch of the Bitcoin ETF.\n\nIt is worth noting that BlackRock, the largest investment management firm in the world, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a spot in Ethereum ETF in November of last year.\n\nMoreover, decisions on spot Ethereum ETF applications are anticipated from the SEC starting in May. Apart from BlackRock, other notable firms in line for approval include Invesco, Ark, and VanEck, alongside Grayscale, which aims to convert its existing Ethereum Trust (ETHE) into an ETF.\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum faces heightened buying pressure, contrasting with Bitcoin\u2019s weakening trend following the ETF approval.\n\nEthereum price analysis\n\nBy press time, Ethereum was trading at $2,548, reflecting weekly gains exceeding 13%.\n\nETH seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nIn terms of technical analysis, the asset is characterized by bullish sentiments. A summary of the one-day gauges retrieved from TradingView indicates a \u2018buy\u2019 rating at 15, with moving averages signaling a \u2018strong buy\u2019 at 13. Additionally, oscillators are holding a \u2018neutral\u2019 position at 8.\n\nETH technical analysis. Source: TradingView\n\nIn conclusion, the approval of the spot Bitcoin ETF has potentially increased the likelihood of witnessing a similar product for Ethereum. However, the impact on the price of Ethereum will likely be influenced by the overall market sentiment at the same time.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

Despite recording a series of downward trends in the preceding days, Ethereum regained its stability soon to register significant price appreciation just before the spot ETF approval.\n\nEthereum sees a bullish trend\n\nFollowing the flash crash on 3 January, Ethereum faced challenges in recovering, dropping to the $2,200-price range. However, as news of the Bitcoin ETF approval circulated, Ethereum\u2019s price rebounded. On the daily timeframe chart, a noticeable uptrend began on 8 January, resulting in a 4.95% hike, pushing the price beyond $2,300.\n\nFurthermore, on the day of the ETF announcement, Ethereum went over $2,500, underlining a more than 10% increase. Comparatively, Bitcoin, with its ETF approval, noted a hike of less than 2%. This suggested that the impact on ETH\u2019s value was comparatively more positive.\n\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum was trading above $2,600. Additionally, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) highlighted an oversold condition, with the RSI line slightly above 70 too.\n\nVolume peaks to highest level in months\n\nAn analysis of Ethereum\u2019s volume over the past few days revealed an uptrend. The volume began its hike around 9 January, touching a peak on 11 January. On this day, the volume surged to over $31 billion, marking the highest level observed in over five months. At press time too, the volume remained high and was over $19 billion.\n\nThis trend in volume indicates high trading activity, with buyers displaying a more aggressive approach in the market.\n\nEthereum supply in profit goes past 86%\n\nThe price decline significantly affected Ethereum\u2019s profitability, as shown by Santiment\u2019s chart. However, following the subsequent price recovery, the supply in profit registered an increase. During the price downturn, the supply in profit fell to around 80%. On the contrary, it saw a notable surge soon after, climbing close to 87% on 11 January.\n\nAt the time of writing, figures for the same were around 86.2%, equivalent to over 113 million. Simultaneously, the seven-day active addresses have risen to around 2.3 million too.\n\n\u2013 Is your portfolio green? Check out the Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nPreviously, the chart had flashed a decline starting around 20 December 2023, with the number falling to around 2.1 million before the commencement of the uptrend."

If you encounter any issues, kindly report them to [email protected]. Crypto assets/products can be highly risky. Never invest unless you\u2019re prepared to lose all the money you invest.\n\nTLDR\n\nEthereum and NuggetRush have emerged as altcoins to watch.\n\nInternet Computer took a hit as its price nosedived.\n\nNuggetRush is tipped for a 60x rally after its launch.\n\nThe week has been a flurry of excitement and events. With the crypto market set to explode, investors have been urged to HODL. Gaining a head start is Ethereum (ETH), with its surge creating quite a buzz in the crypto scene. Meanwhile, Internet Computer (ICP), another top altcoin, is trading on the downside, facing strong bearish pressure. Worthy of note is NuggetRush (NUGX), a new ICO fast becoming a safe haven among investors.\n\nThis post will discuss the diverging trajectories of Ethereum and Internet Computer. Further, it will cover why NuggetRush is one of the best cryptos to buy now.\n\n>> Buy NuggetRush Now <<\n\nNuggetRush (NUGX): A New Investor Haven\n\nFlying under the radar is NuggetRush (NUGX), one of the new ICOs with the biggest potential. Still in its early stages, it is fast becoming a safe haven for investors seeking low risk and staggering gains.\n\nAlthough it combines memetic features, it has an edge over most hype-driven coin offerings. This is because it will be more than just a meme, as its ecosystem will boast real-world applications and the token will have strong use cases.\n\nPositioned at the intersection of memes, play-to-earn (P2E), and GameFi, it has been hailed as the most promising narrative. The ecosystem will host a thrilling gold mining game, which promises an immersive gameplay experience and opportunities to earn tangible rewards. The NUGX coin will function as the in-game currency as well as a governance token.\n\nIn the fourth round of the presale, a token is priced at $0.015. According to experts, its price will rally by 60x after its launch, which makes it the best new crypto to invest in today.\n\n>> Buy NuggetRush Now <<\n\nEthereum (ETH): One of the Best Coins to Hold\n\nEthereum (ETH) is on a roll following the significant surge in its price. Holders are giving themselves a tap on the back for holding amid bearish pressure and sentiment. With the fear of missing out (FOMO) expected to rise in the future, Ethereum is still a good crypto to buy at its current price.\n\nAs a bull market approaches, Ethereum has been tipped as one of the altcoins to watch. Given its staggering upside potential, it is a wave you shouldn\u2019t miss out on. So, if you have yet to add ETH to your crypto portfolio, this might be a reminder to do so.\n\nInternet Computer (ICP): Anticipated Rally in the Coming Days\n\nAfter a significant rally in the price of the Internet Computer (ICP), it is now exposed to the downside. The crypto market moving sideways isn\u2019t uncommon, so the dip in the price of Internet Computer isn\u2019t shocking.\n\nDespite the recent price dip, many remain optimistic. According to experts, Internet Computer will make a comeback in the coming days. Hence, you can see its current low price as an opportunity to add more ICP tokens to your bag at a discounted price.\n\nConclusion\n\nEthereum is soaring ahead of most altcoins, which is great news if you are a current holder. On the other hand, Internet Computer is facing bearish pressure, although a bounceback is on the cards. Meanwhile, NuggetRush has emerged as one of the altcoins to watch.\n\nVisit NuggetRush Presale Website"

        "title": "Ethereum ETF Prospects Not as Bright as Bitcoin's; Here's Why - CoinGape",
        "content": "The journey toward approving an Ethereum ETF stands on shaky ground when compared to the recent launch of Bitcoin ETF. While the BTC ETF launch took nearly a debate and a few lawsuits, SEC Chair Gary Gensler never called Bitcoin anything other than a commodity.\n\nBut, Gensler weighs caution on how he defines Ethereum.\n\nadvertisement\n\nWhen Gensler deemed Bitcoin a non-security commodity, it became akin to gold and silver. But Ethereum\u2019s classification remained ambiguous, clouding the prospects for its own ETF.\n\nBitcoin is a loner among its peers\n\nIn a recent interview with CNBC, Gensler\u2019s comments have set a precedent for the market once again by recognizing Bitcoin as the lone crypto commodity, suggesting that an Ethereum ETF may face tougher scrutiny.\n\nHe stated, \u201cWhat we did this week\u2026 it\u2019s happened to one non-security commodity token called Bitcoin,\u201d positioning Bitcoin as unique among its peers.\n\nGensler added, \u201cLike we\u2019ve had gold spot exchange-traded products and silver exchange-traded products in the past and approved in the past.\u201d\n\nThis clarification comes amidst the SEC\u2019s rigorous debate on what is deemed a security. It is especially highlighted by the Ripple case, with several community arguments partly resting on Ethereum\u2019s status.\n\nETH ETF approval odds lower than BTC\n\nGensler\u2019s careful language suggests that the SEC is not ready to categorically separate Ethereum from the potential label of a security, which would require all its transactions to be either registered or exempt from registration.\n\nWhile Gensler has openly categorized Bitcoin as a commodity, his reluctance to speak on individual tokens like Ethereum signals complexity. This ambiguity could cast a shadow on the expectations for an Ethereum ETF by May.\n\nBloomberg\u2019s senior ETF analyst, Eric Balchunas, reportedly places a 70% chance of approval by May for the ETH ETF. It is a dip from the more favorable odds given to Bitcoin at 90%.\n\nUpcoming deadlines in 2024\n\nThe list of Ethereum ETF proposals awaiting SEC decisions this year calls for clarity sooner. VanEck and ARK 21Shares have proposed ETFs backed by physical Ethereum, with custodianship potentially involving major players like Gemini and Coinbase. The SEC\u2019s final decisions are due by May 2024.\n\nHashdex and Grayscale are taking their offerings to NASDAQ and NYSE respectively, with decisions expected by the first half of 2024. Grayscale, in particular, has a significant deadline in June 2024 for its Ethereum Trust Conversion.\n\nNew deadline to obsess over just dropped May 23rd is the final deadline for decision on VanEck\u2019s spot ETH ETF pic.twitter.com/dgi5EVbPeQ \u2014 Will (@WClementeIII) January 10, 2024\n\nInvesco Galaxy and Fidelity are in the race with final decisions anticipated in July or August 2024. BlackRock has thrown its hat into the ring with an ETF under Nasdaq\u2019s umbrella, hoping for a decision by early August 2024.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin ETF Surge: Day Two Saw Spot Bitcoin Funds Flourish"

Discover SCENE\n\nIllustration by Mitchell Preffer for Decrypt.\n\nThe historical and hotly anticipated approval of Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETF) this week basically blocked out the sun for the rest of the crypto solar system, and frankly fueled a flood of headlines at Decrypt.\n\nAll the theories and analysis over what the approval would mean for the value of the top cryptocurrency was finally put to the test. Up or down? Priced in or not? Would Bitcoin enter the next phase of its evolution, or simply shrug? After all, Bitcoin spot ETFs aren't exactly new outside the U.S.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOn the question of up or down, the answer is so far both: The price of Bitcoin flirted across a crowded room with $49,000 when the ETFs were approved. One day later, though, and it plunged back to $43,000\u2014a neighborhood where it's been hanging out for quite a while.\n\nTrading just below $43,000 now, Bitcoin is down about 2% from where it was seven days ago. Over the past month, BTC is totally flat. But hodlers are still happy to see Bitcoin up over 120% since this time last year.\n\nPerennial \"distant second\" Ethereum saw more green candles, by comparison, buoyed in part by a rise in \"wen ETH ETF?\" speculation now that the Bitcoin version exists. Ethereum hit an 18-month high of nearly $2,700 yesterday.\n\nETH is changing hands at $2,568 today, a rise of about 1% from this time yesterday. But over the last week, it's up over 14%, and up more than 12% for the last month. The one-year return is about 80%. Ethereum scaling networks also had a strong week, with Arbitrum (ARB) up 22% and Optimism (OP) popping 16%.\n\nElsewhere in the top 5, Binance Coin (BNB) is down just under 2% this week while Solana has posted a 2% gain. Some other crypto bright spots include Tezos (XTZ) and Stacks (STX), both posting double-digit percentage gains over the past week.\n\nInterestingly, the Ethereum Name Service and its ENS token\u2014at the very back of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market cap\u2014had the best week, up nearly 75% over the last seven days.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

He has a strong understanding of market sentiment and uses this to inform his trading decisions and price predictions.\n\nStory Highlights Expect a major altcoin bull market in 2024 fueled by potential Ethereum and XRP spot ETFs.\n\nEthereum ETF approval around May is likely, boosting Ethereum and potentially shaping it as a non-security asset.\n\nAnticipate milestones like the Ethereum Dencun upgrade and Bitcoin halving.\n\n2024 started on a high note with the groundbreaking approval of spot ETFs for Bitcoin by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Despite Bitcoin\u2019s stable pricing in the $45K-$47K range, the altcoin market witnessed a surge, notably Ethereum Classic (ETC) soaring by 48%, leading the way for other major altcoins such as Ethereum (ETH), Cardano (ADA), and Avalanche (AVAX) with double-digit gains.\n\nSo, what\u2019s next for the market? Here\u2019s all you must know to navigate the future!\n\nAltcoins Pick Pace\n\nThe recent rally in altcoin prices is fueled by rising expectations within the crypto community about the SEC\u2019s potential approval of spot-based ETFs for alternative cryptocurrencies. Crypto analyst Lark Davis, known as \u201cCrypto Lark,\u201d speculates Ethereum spot ETFs might gain approval around May, a significant development for the second-largest cryptocurrency. Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas puts the odds of an Ethereum ETF in May at 70%.\n\nEthereum spot ETFs coming in May (first final deadline from SEC)!\n\n\n\nETH futures already approved\u2026 so that means ETH is already classified as not a security.\n\n\n\nEIP 4844 coming to lower layer two fees big time!\n\n\n\nBitcoin halving coming\u2026\n\n\n\nProbably an XRP ETF as it is also not a\u2026 \u2014 Lark Davis (@TheCryptoLark) January 13, 2024\n\nMiles Jennings, A16Z general counsel, suggests that the SEC\u2019s approval of Ethereum futures products signals a favorable stance on Ethereum, steering clear of classification as a security.\n\nAlso Read: XRP Bulls Well in Position: Can They Trigger a Fresh Upswing to Hit $1 in January 2024?\n\nIs An XRP ETF Coming?\n\nFollowing the Ripple SEC lawsuit\u2019s landmark ruling declaring XRP not a security, Crypto Lark considers the potential for an XRP ETF. The crypto community eagerly awaits the next major ETF approval post-Bitcoin, with Steve McClurg, co-founder and CIO of Valkyrie Funds, dropping hints about potential Ethereum or XRP ETFs.\n\n2024 \u2013 The Year We Hit the Biggest Milestones!\n\nBeyond these groundbreaking developments, 2024 promises other significant events, including the Ethereum Dencun upgrade and the Bitcoin halving. Analysts paint a bullish picture of an altcoin boom in 2024. Lark Davis envisions it as \u201cthe biggest altcoin party ever seen.\u201d This optimism draws parallels to historical precedents, where the SEC\u2019s approval of BTC futures funds triggered a spectacular rally in altcoins, soaring over 500%.\n\nIf history repeats itself, Ethereum, XRP, and other altcoins could experience substantial growth in 2024, potentially overshadowing Bitcoin in market dominance. The crypto community stands at the brink of a year filled with anticipation. Folks, we\u2019re in for a wild ride. We\u2019re excited \u2013 are you?"

        "content": "The Bitcoin spot ETF approval brought volatility to the cryptocurrency market, mostly favoring altcoins for the weekend. Meanwhile, smart money in and outflows hint at which cryptocurrencies profitable traders are accumulating and getting rid of.\n\nIn onchain analysis, smart traders are active crypto addresses with a profitable history considering tokens\u2019 inflow and outflow. If the address acquired tokens at a lower average price than what they later spent, it is smart money.\n\nNotably, the smart money inflow was massively dominated by Ethereum (ETH) in the past 24 hours, according to SpotOnChain data. $78.87 million in ETH entered smart traders\u2019 accounts, while the second place had only a $3.25 million inflow.\n\nSmart trader monitor \u2013 Top smart money inflow. Source: SpotOnChain\n\nIn the meantime, the top 2 smart money outflows were Injective (INJ) and Wrapped BTC (WBTC). Smart traders dumped $12.05 million and $6.66 million worth of INJ and WBTC, respectively.\n\nSmart trader monitor \u2013 Top smart money outflow. Source: SpotOnChain\n\nWhat do WBTC and Bitcoin ETFs have in common?\n\nEssentially, WBTC is a synthetic version of Bitcoin (BTC), running on Ethereum and other DeFi blockchains, similar to Bitcoin ETFs. Someone does the custody of the real Bitcoin, while the traders get exposure to its price activity on other markets.\n\nArbitrage might occur if any connected assets have a huge price variation. In particular, arbitrage smart money profits from the price difference of a base asset in different markets. These dynamics guarantee a price balance and that each connected asset can serve as a leading indicator to the other.\n\nTherefore, if there is a considerable outflow of WBTC, a similar sell-off is expected for Bitcoin or its ETFs. As one usually influences the other, it is tough to distinguish between cause and effect \u2014 a \u201cchicken-egg\u201d paradox.\n\nBitcoin price analysis amid smart money outflow\n\nInterestingly, a sell-the-news event occurred after a quick pump to $48,965 per BTC following the Bitcoin spot ETF approval. The leading cryptocurrency lost 12.4% of its value from this peak to its current price of $42,550\n\nBTC hourly price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nSimultaneously, Bloomberg\u2019s ETF analyst James Seyffart reported a $484 million outflow from Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). Thus, in a similar flow direction to the one from smart money DeFi traders.\n\nIn this context, it is evident that ETFs might have a more extensive influence on Bitcoin\u2019s price and vice-versa. Now, the narrative is shifting towards an awaited Ethereum spot ETF approval, possibly motivating the first-mentioned smart money inflows to ETH.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "content": "Sat 13 Jan 2024 \u25aa 3 min of reading \u25aa by Luc Jose A.\n\nCurrently, all eyes are on the potential approval by the SEC of a Bitcoin Spot ETF. If this materializes, the emergence of an Ethereum Spot ETF should capture the interest of the crypto community. A prospect that would be beneficial for the ecosystem surrounding the 2nd largest crypto in the market.\n\nTowards a Revival of Investor Enthusiasm for Ethereum?\n\nThe famous YouTuber Crypto Rover echoed a projection involving Ethereum. According to it, the emergence of an Ethereum Spot ETF will be the next significant event in the crypto industry.\n\nCrypto Rover predicts a shift of market fervor from bitcoin (BTC) toward Ethereum\u2019s Ether (ETH). He believes this movement will occur after the much-anticipated approval of a Bitcoin Spot ETF by the SEC.\n\nThis prospect could change the current dynamics of the Ethereum ecosystem, which is presently facing a lack of attention from the crypto community. He attributes this situation to the recent price surge of Solana\u2019s SOL, which increased by 360% in 90 days.\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum has seen a more modest increase of 48% over the same period. However, some traders believe that the situation will soon change, driven by a significant influx of capital in anticipation of an Ethereum ETF following a Bitcoin ETF.\n\nAt the Dawn of a Pivotal Stage?\n\nFor crypto analyst Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe, the prospects for ETH are somewhat certain. According to him, the asset is in a critical situation that could result in a substantial increase in its valuation.\n\nAccording to the expert, this outlook would trigger a liquidation candle on the ETH/BTC trading chart. This concretely indicates a strong price fluctuation followed by investor funds flowing toward Ethereum.\n\nCurrently, Ethereum\u2019s Ether (ETH) is valued at $2,300. The crypto has seen an increase of 3.19% over the last 24 hours. This rise is supported by a notable improvement in transaction volume of 36.14%, reaching $12.48 billion.\n\nJames Seyffart, an ETF specialist, notes interesting developments for Ethereum. Specifically, the SEC\u2019s approval of Ethereum futures and the CFTC\u2019s designation of ETH as a commodity. For him, these are signs that an Ethereum Spot ETF could emerge this year.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program!

        "content": "The meteoric rise of VC Spectra (SPCT) during the public presale has inspired several market experts to recognize SPCT as one of the best coins to invest in 2024. On the other hand, analysts evaluate Ethereum (ETH) and XRP (XRP) as high-risk investments for the following term, so let\u2019s delve into detail and find out which is the best cryptocurrency to buy today.\n\n>>BUY SPCT TOKENS NOW<<\n\nSummary\n\nVC Spectra (SPCT) offers 900% gains before the official launch.\n\nEthereum (ETH) could increase over $2,800 by the end of January 2024.\n\nXRP (XRP) could decrease under $0.55 by February 2024.\n\nVC Spectra (SPCT) Brings Unsurpassed Real-Life Utility and Massive Rewards\n\nVC Spectra (SPCT) is a fresh decentralized hedge fund that empowers users to recognize the most viable investments across several niche market sectors. Furthermore, VC Spectra (SPCT) investors can detect the most lucrative current technology startups and receive optimized rewards by supporting the best-performing blockchain platforms.\n\nOn top of that, VC Spectra (SPCT) holders can utilize the platform\u2019s advanced AI-powered algorithms to create unique trading strategies and receive quarterly dividends and buybacks from their investments\u2019 profits. In addition, the deflationary VC Spectra (SPCT) token is built on the unrivaled Bitcoin blockchain and grants early access to unbelievable pre-ICO discounts.\n\nHowever, SPCT adopters also receive voting rights for future investment proposals, meaning that each member of the democratically governed community has an active influence over the platform\u2019s important decisions.\n\nVC Spectra (SPCT) is at Stage 5 of the presale, priced at only $0.080. Thus, SPCT investors can expect remarkable gains when the token soon reaches the $0.080 presale target and rises by as much as 900% from the starting price figure of $0.008.\n\nVC Spectra\u2019s groundbreaking features have caught the attention of many experienced crypto traders, which is just one of the reasons why SPCT is regarded as the best new crypto to invest in 2024.\n\n>>BUY SPCT TOKENS NOW<<\n\nETH Price Prediction: Can Ethereum Withstand the Heat?\n\nThe price of Ethereum (ETH) has increased by 15.85% within five days, from $2,241 on January 6 to $2,597 on January 11. Ethereum (ETH) bulls claim that ETH is set to continue its bullish trend due to the expected approval of several spot Ethereum ETFs within the following months. According to a recent ETH price prediction, Ethereum (ETH) could surge over $2,800 by the end of January.\n\nContrary to this optimistic Ethereum prediction, ETH bears point out that Ethereum could soon run out of steam due to the rising selling pressure. As for the latest negative ETH price prediction, Ethereum could trade at around $2,200 during the first week of February.\n\nIn recent Ethereum (ETH) news, the platform announced the upcoming launch of the Ethereum Dencun Upgrade on January 17.\n\n\ud83d\udd0a Ethereum Dencun Upgrade (4844) will go live on Goerli testnet at 6:32 UTC on January 17, 2024!\n\nThe upgrade introduces \u201cprotodanksharding\u201d (EIP-4844), featuring ephemeral data blobs to reduce L2 transaction fees.\n\nMore details you can found here\n\n\ud83d\udd17https://t.co/fsYdBhaaWP pic.twitter.com/rxHCIUNr6K \u2014 Ethereum Daily (@ETH_Daily) January 11, 2024\n\nXRP Price Prediction: Could XRP Drop Under $0.55?\n\nRipple\u2019s XRP has decreased by 3.56% over six days, from $0.62 on January 2 to $0.60 on January 11. XRP bears warn that XRP could enter a prolonged negative trend if it fails to achieve closes above $0.60 over the forthcoming term. Thus, some analysts have given a pessimistic XRP price prediction, stating that XRP could decrease under $0.55 by the end of the month.\n\nOn the other hand, XRP bulls believe that the recent approval of 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs could pave the way for XRP ETF applications. Furthermore, Grayscale added XRP to its Digital Large Asset Cap Fund on January 5, which is another reason why XRP enthusiasts expect significant rallies over the next XRP crypto price movements. According to a recent bullish XRP price prediction, XRP could surpass the $0.70 threshold by the beginning of February.\n\nAnalysts claim that VC Spectra (SPCT) has the potential to overshadow Ethereum (ETH) and XRP (XRP) once SPCT hits major exchanges, so join the presale today to earn an excellent bonus on any deposit!\n\nLearn more about the VC Spectra presale here:\n\nPresale: https://invest.vcspectra.io/login\n\nWebsite: https://vcspectra.io\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/VCSpectra\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/spectravcfund\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Ripple (XRP), Solana (SOL), or Ethereum (ETH). Top crypto analyst picks Pushd (PUSHD) over all three - CryptoDaily",
        "content": "Table of Contents\n\nIn the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies dominated by Ripple (XRP), Solana (SOL), and Ethereum (ETH), a compelling newcomer has emerged \u2013 Pushd. As the established players chart their courses, let\u2019s delve into what sets Pushd apart, offering a simple yet promising avenue for crypto enthusiasts.\n\nRipple (XRP): Navigating Legal Waves\n\nRipple (XRP) finds itself in legal waters with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The recent request for financial statements adds a layer of uncertainty. The SEC argues that XRP gets its security label only when sold to institutional investors. With a trial set for April 2024, Ripple faces an uncertain future.\n\nDespite the legal drama, Ripple (XRP), currently priced at $0.60, retains its place in the crypto landscape. The SEC's involvement has injected volatility, but investors are patiently awaiting the trial outcome to gauge XRP's resilience.\n\nSolana (SOL): Riding the Positive Wave\n\nSolana (SOL), positioned as the fifth-largest cryptocurrency, is riding high on recent gains. A 4.5% surge brings SOL closer to the notable $100 mark. Insights from analyst Ali Martinez hint at a potential 47% rally if SOL breaks free from a bullish flag pattern.\n\nQ4 2023 showcased Solana's prowess, with a 423% quarter-on-quarter increase in market capitalization. Surpassing tokens like ADA, USDC, and XRP, SOL's decentralized finance (DeFi) Total Value Locked (TVL) reached $1.5 billion, securing its position in the crypto market.\n\nEthereum (ETH): Whales in Action\n\nEthereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency, witnesses strategic moves by whales. Addresses like \"0xAA15\" and \"0x9314\" accumulate significant amounts, propelling ETH to an 11.42% surge in the past 24 hours. A 65.99% surge in large transactions signals a shifting landscape for Ethereum.\n\nThe recent approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF has fueled positive sentiment, with Ethereum eyeing the coveted $2,700 benchmark. Analysts foresee potential approval for a spot Ethereum ETF, further bolstering retail sentiment. Ethereum's ongoing rally showcases its resilience and potential for sustained growth.\n\nPushd (PUSHD): Simplifying E-Commerce\n\nPushd is a disruptor in online marketplaces that goes beyond simplifying transactions. As the pioneer of the Web3 platform with a fully decentralized marketplace, Pushdtransforms the e-commerce landscape. Pushd stands as a beacon of transparency in a thriving global e-commerce sector projected to exceed $6 trillion.\n\nBeyond just lower fees and immediate fund releases, Pushd introduces a suite of user-friendly features. These include a versatile debit card, revenue-sharing for presale investors, a seamless swap service, a rewarding program, decentralized governance, and an exclusive VIP program. Together, these features position Pushd as a preferred decentralized online marketplace, ready to usher in a new era of online retail.\n\nAs Ripple (XRP), Solana (SOL), and Ethereum (ETH) navigate their paths, Pushd stands out with a comprehensive and innovative approach. In a crypto landscape often filled with complexities, Pushd's vision for the future of online marketplaces is clear. With predictions of a 50x - 100x price increase during the 2024 bull market, Pushdpresents a unique opportunity for investors seeking more than just simplicity \u2013 a transformative future for online retail. As the crypto community seeks growth and evolution, Pushd emerges as a frontrunner poised to redefine the landscape of online marketplaces.\n\nFind out more about the Pushd presale at their official website.\n\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored press release and is for informational purposes only.

        "title": "Three Bullish Tokens Investors Should Consider in Q1 of 2024: Everlodge (ELDG), Cardano (ADA) and Ethereum ... - CryptoDaily",
        "content": "Table of Contents\n\nCardano (ADA) recent developments have alerted the attention of analysts with the token predicted for a bullish run. Moreover, Ethereum Classic (ETC) is expected to leverage the power of the main Ethereum network for an upswing. However, Everlodge (ELDG) is making huge progress in the crypto market with the revolutionary idea of fractional ownership of real estate properties. Let's explore the three tokens and see why they have been picked as the best cryptos to invest in Q1 of 2024.\n\nEverlodge (ELDG) Enables Real Estate Investment With Minimal Capital\n\nAlongside Cardano and Ethereum Classic, Everlodge is another token that is expected to rally in the first quarter of 2024. When launched, Everlodge will enable investment into luxury properties for only $100.\n\nThe platform will achieve this feat through fractional ownership of real estate properties that have been minted into digital NFTs. The implication is that instead of purchasing a million dollars worth of luxurious homes and villas, investors can purchase tamper-proof NFT assets with underlying real estate properties that are stored as an on-chain day on the blockchain.\n\nThe platform utility token, ELDG, is an erc20 token built on the Ethereum Blockchain. The token will be used for payment and transaction purposes across different Evelodge features. The project is currently in the 9th stage of presale and selling for $0.029 per ELDG, with the price increasing soon. By holding this token, investors can attract tons of rewards, such as low trading fees, maintenance fee reductions, and staking of assets for passive income.\n\nAccording to Everlodge's white paper, the team token will be locked for two years and the liquidity pool for eight years, giving more price stability for the token. The project's smart contract has been audited by an independent auditing firm and the KYC has also been completed. With a predicted price increase of 280% before the end of presale and a 30x increase by launch, Everlodge is one of the best defi tokens analysts are bullish on.\n\nCardano (ADA) Holders Optimistic Despite Recent Market Downturn\n\nNotwithstanding the recent crypto market downturn, there is growing optimism among investors that Cardano's price will turn bullish soon. This growing optimism has been attributed to the recent improvement being done on the Cardano network.\n\nIn the last 30 days, Cardano developers have made an average of 449 daily commits on GitHub to become one of the networks with the highest engagement on GitHub. Although there has been some reduction in Cardano's key market metrics, such as the reduction of 9.30% in its stablecoinmarket cap, Cardano is expected to outgrow these negativities and spark a resurgence. The token still remains one of the best cryptos to invest in the year.\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC) Price Predictions\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC) is not having the best of moments with the token battling the bear market. The ETC token has slipped by 14.84% in the last 30 days. A look at the Ethereum Classic technical indicators also indicates that the bearish market is having a 58% advantage with the Fear and Greed Index displaying a score of 71 (Greed).\n\nHowever, Ethereum Classic can not be ruled out just yet as it leverages the power of the Ethereum network. With the Ethereum network set for a massive bull run soon, the Ethereum Classic price is predicted to rise to $30 before the end of the first quarter of 2024.\n\nVisit Everlodge\n\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored press release and is for informational purposes only.

        "title": "Crypto Updates: Cardano holders Decline for 7 months Straight, Retik Finance Presale crosses $7 Million mark with ... - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "The cryptocurrency market is a dynamic and ever-evolving space, with developments and updates happening regularly. In this article, we\u2019ll explore three significant updates in the crypto world, including the ongoing decline in Cardano holders, Retik Finance\u2019s successful presale crossing the $7 million mark, and Ethereum\u2019s upcoming Dencun upgrade, set to reduce gas fees and bring about transformative changes.\n\nCardano Holders Decline for 7 Consecutive Months\n\nCardano (ADA) has been a prominent name in the blockchain space, known for its robust developer engagement and commitment to creating a secure and scalable blockchain platform. Despite its strong development community, recent data reveals a concerning trend\u2014Cardano holders have been on the decline for seven consecutive months. One of the distinguishing features of Cardano is its active GitHub development activity. It consistently records the highest number of GitHub commits among blockchain platforms, indicating a high level of developer engagement and commitment to improving the network\u2019s infrastructure. However, there seems to be a disparity between the vibrant development landscape and the performance of Cardano\u2019s decentralised finance (DeFi) ecosystem. Recent statistics show that Cardano\u2019s DeFi sector is experiencing subdued engagement. This is reflected in a 21.58% decline in trading volume within the network and a 9.15% downturn in stablecoin transfers. While Cardano maintains a total value locked (TVL) of $356.54 million in its DeFi space, the dominance is primarily held by Indigo with a 23.94% share. The decline in Cardano holders can be attributed to several factors, including the overall bearish sentiment in the crypto market, the absence of significant DeFi projects on the platform, and the need for broader adoption and use cases. Despite these challenges, Cardano continues to work on improving its ecosystem, and upcoming developments and partnerships may bring about positive changes in the future. As the crypto market remains highly dynamic, Cardano\u2019s ability to adapt and grow its DeFi space will be crucial in reversing the trend of declining holders.\n\nRetik Finance Presale Surpasses $7 Million Mark with Ease\n\nRetik Finance, a blockchain project with a clear mission and vision, has achieved a remarkable milestone by surpassing the $7 million mark in its presale. This achievement is a testament to the project\u2019s utility and the growing interest it has garnered within the crypto community. Retik Finance is not just another cryptocurrency; it represents an ecosystem designed to redefine decentralised finance (DeFi) and bridge the gap between the crypto and traditional financial worlds. The project\u2019s mission is to empower individuals and businesses worldwide by providing innovative solutions that make cryptocurrency more accessible and practical in everyday life.\n\nKey features and utilities of Retik Finance include:\n\nDeFi Debit Cards : Retik Finance introduces DeFi Debit Cards, allowing users to spend their cryptocurrencies seamlessly, similar to traditional fiat currencies.\n\nSmart Crypto Payment Gateway : The platform offers a smart crypto payment gateway, enhancing transaction speed and security for cryptocurrency users.\n\nAI-Powered Peer-to-Peer Lending : Retik Finance utilises artificial intelligence to facilitate peer-to-peer lending, optimising lending rates and creating a user-friendly lending experience.\n\nMulti-Chain Non-Custodial DeFi Wallet : Security is a top priority, and Retik Finance\u2019s non-custodial DeFi wallet ensures users have full control over their assets while enjoying the benefits of decentralised finance.\n\nReal-Life Integration : Retik Finance aims to make cryptocurrency a part of everyday life, enabling practical use cases and real-world integration.\n\nThe success of Retik Finance\u2019s presale indicates a strong demand for innovative DeFi solutions that simplify cryptocurrency usage and make it more accessible to a broader audience. As the project continues to develop and expand its ecosystem, it has the potential to play a significant role in shaping the future of decentralised finance.\n\n>>>> Click Here To Buy RETIK Tokens <<<<\n\nEthereum\u2019s Dencun Upgrade to Reduce Gas Fees Considerably\n\nEthereum, the leading blockchain platform for decentralised applications and smart contracts, is on the verge of a major upgrade known as Dencun. This upgrade is expected to bring substantial changes to the Ethereum network, with a primary focus on reducing transaction costs, enhancing scalability, and enabling new use cases. Dencun will introduce a series of Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) designed to enhance the network\u2019s efficiency and user experience. Some of the notable EIPs included in the Dencun upgrade are:\n\nEIP-4844 (Proto-Danksharding or The Surge):\n\nThis proposal introduces temporary \u201cdata blobs\u201d that can be used by Layer 2 solutions to post transaction and proof data instead of CALLDATA. These data blobs are not stored permanently on the blockchain, resulting in significantly lower gas costs for Layer 2 transactions. The implementation of EIP-4844 is expected to reduce the cost of Layer 2 transactions by a substantial margin, making Ethereum more cost-effective for users.\n\nOther EIPs:\n\nIn addition to EIP-4844, the Dencun upgrade will include several other Ethereum Improvement Proposals, such as EIP-6780, EIP-1153, and EIP-6475, each addressing specific aspects of network optimization and user experience. The Dencun upgrade represents a significant step forward for Ethereum, as it aims to make the platform more scalable, efficient, and affordable for users and developers alike. Lowering gas fees is a crucial goal, as high gas costs have been a point of concern for Ethereum users, particularly during periods of network congestion. As Ethereum continues to evolve and adapt to meet the growing demands of the decentralised ecosystem, the Dencun upgrade is poised to play a pivotal role in enhancing the platform\u2019s competitiveness and usability in the blockchain space.\n\nIn conclusion, the cryptocurrency market is characterised by constant change and innovation. While Cardano faces the challenge of declining holders, it remains committed to improving its DeFi ecosystem. Retik Finance\u2019s successful presale highlights the demand for user-friendly DeFi solutions, and Ethereum\u2019s Dencun upgrade promises a more cost-effective and efficient network. As these developments unfold, they contribute to the ongoing evolution of the crypto landscape, shaping the future of blockchain technology and decentralised finance.\n\nClick Here To Take Part In Retik Finance Presale\n\nVisit the links below for more information about Retik Finance (RETIK):\n\nWebsite: https://retik.com\n\nWhitepaper: https://retik.com/retik-whitepaper.pdf\n\nLinktree: https://linktr.ee/retikfinance\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "In the cryptocurrency space, recent news has shaken the market, with Ethereum and Pandoshi emerging as protagonists of a particularly dynamic week.\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) approval of Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) requests has triggered a series of events leading to both a rise in Ethereum\u2019s price and a significant increase in the presale of Pandoshi.\n\nEthereum Aims for Breakout with Increased Trading Volume\n\nIn the context of a still highly volatile market, Ethereum (ETH) has shown remarkable resilience, nearing the level of $2,640 at the time of writing. This recent positive performance by ETH has manifested through two consecutive bullish daily closes, suggesting the possibility of a third if the current momentum can be maintained, and we believe it can.\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, Ethereum\u2019s price is still confined within a range between $2,250 and $2,750, but the recent bounce from the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the daily timeframe suggests the potential breakout of this band.\n\nSpot trading volume for Ethereum has increased by 35% in the last 24 hours, with investors looking to participate before a possible breakout. This increase in volume coincides with the Crypto Fear & Greed Index reaching \u201cExtreme Greed\u201d territory, indicating an atmosphere of growing optimism.\n\nThanks to all the factors at play, Ethereum could be well-positioned to return to its annual highs of December in the coming days. The news of the Bitcoin ETFs approval has contributed to fueling investor enthusiasm, paving the way for new opportunities in the cryptocurrency sector.\n\nPandoshi Phase 3 Is Quickly Selling Out\n\nPandoshi\u2019s recent presale has been exceptionally successful, securing over $1.7 million within a mere two weeks since its inception. This impressive milestone underscores the growing investor interest and the project\u2019s potential within the cryptocurrency space.\n\nCurrently, Pandoshi is advancing through its third presale phase, with preparations underway for the next stage, which will see an increase in the token price, signifying a key development for both the project and its backers.\n\nContrary to initial impressions, Pandoshi is much more than a meme coin.

        "title": "Will Solana (SOL) take over the Market Cap of Ethereum (ETH) in 2024 and become the second biggest after - Bitcoinist",
        "content": "In the world of cryptocurrencies, few projects have achieved the level of recognition and impact that Ethereum (ETH) has. As the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, Ethereum has played a pivotal role in shaping the blockchain landscape. However, there\u2019s a rising contender on the horizon\u2014Solana (SOL). In this article, we\u2019ll explore the potential for Solana to surpass Ethereum\u2019s market cap in 2024 and become the second-largest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin.\n\nUnderstanding Ethereum\n\nEthereum, often referred to as the \u201cworld computer\u201d of blockchain, is an open-source blockchain platform introduced by Vitalik Buterin and his co-founders in 2015. Ethereum\u2019s native digital currency, Ether (ETH), fuels the network and serves as the foundation for a wide range of decentralised applications (DApps). At its core, Ethereum enables the execution of smart contracts, self-executing agreements with coded terms that run without the need for intermediaries. Ethereum\u2019s journey began with a white paper outlining its ambitious vision for a decentralised, censorship-resistant global computer. The project raised funds through a public crowd sale in 2014, leading to its official launch in 2015. Since then, Ethereum has undergone several updates, with the most recent being the London Hard Fork.\n\nKey Features of Ethereum:\n\nSmart Contracts: Ethereum\u2019s introduction of smart contracts revolutionised the blockchain industry. These self-executing contracts enable a wide array of decentralised applications and use cases. Decentralised Applications (DApps): Ethereum\u2019s blockchain serves as the foundation for a multitude of DApps, ranging from DeFi platforms to NFT marketplaces. ERC-20 Tokens: Ethereum\u2019s ERC-20 standard allows developers to create tokens on the platform, giving rise to a vast ecosystem of tokens and projects. Decentralised Autonomous Organizations (DAOs): Ethereum facilitates the creation of DAOs, organisations governed by code rather than individuals, fostering trustless decision-making.\n\n>>>> Click Here To Buy RETIK Tokens <<<<\n\nSolana: A Rising Star\n\nSolana, on the other hand, is a relative newcomer to the crypto scene, but it has rapidly gained attention for its innovative approach to blockchain technology. Launched by the Solana Foundation in March 2020, Solana aims to provide scalable and cost-effective solutions for decentralised finance (DeFi) applications.\n\nKey Features of Solana:\n\nProof of History (PoH): Solana employs a unique consensus mechanism called Proof of History, granting each node its independent clock and decision-making capability. This enhances the overall efficiency of the network. Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT): Solana utilises BFT algorithms to ensure the stability and functionality of the system, even in the face of node failures. Speed and Cost-Efficiency: Solana\u2019s blockchain offers lightning-fast transaction speeds, with an average cost of just $0.00025. This scalability addresses common issues of high fees and slow confirmation times in the crypto space.\n\nSolana (SOL) vs. Ethereum (ETH): Investment Perspective\n\nAs the crypto market continues to evolve, investors are faced with the choice of whether to invest in established giants like Ethereum or explore newer projects like Solana. Let\u2019s take a closer look at the investment perspective for both. Ethereum has solidified its position as a cornerstone of the blockchain industry. With a rich ecosystem of DApps, DeFi platforms, and NFT marketplaces, Ethereum offers a diverse range of use cases. Recent updates, such as the London Hard Fork, have increased efficiency and scalability. Ethereum\u2019s native token, Ether (ETH), remains an attractive investment option for those seeking long-term growth and passive income through staking. On the other hand, Solana has garnered attention for its speed and cost-efficiency, making it an appealing choice for traders and DeFi enthusiasts. Its ability to process a high volume of transactions within seconds has positioned it as a strong contender in the DeFi space. Institutional and retail interest in Solana has surged, reflecting confidence in its potential for further growth. Analysts suggest that including a percentage of established tokens like Ethereum in a portfolio can offer passive income potential over the long term. However, the rapidly evolving crypto landscape also presents opportunities in newer projects like Solana. Investors should conduct thorough research to make informed decisions based on their risk tolerance and investment goals.\n\n>>>> Click Here To Buy RETIK Tokens <<<<\n\nRetik Finance: The Emerging DeFi King\n\nWhile Ethereum and Solana vie for market dominance, there\u2019s another player in the DeFi arena worth considering\u2014Retik Finance (RETIK). This innovative project, currently in its presale stage, aims to bridge the gap between traditional finance and cryptocurrencies. Retik Finance offers a comprehensive ecosystem that includes the Retik Wallet, DeFi Debit Cards, and Retik Pay, enabling seamless cryptocurrency transactions and spending. The recent success of Retik Finance\u2019s Certik audit adds a layer of trust and credibility to the project, attracting investors seeking security and transparency. As of the latest data, Retik Finance\u2019s presale Stage 5 has achieved 81.92% completion, with over $7.3 million raised. This strong performance reflects growing investor confidence in the project\u2019s potential.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe battle for supremacy in the crypto world continues, with Ethereum and Solana competing for market dominance. While Ethereum boasts a rich history and a diverse ecosystem of DApps and tokens, Solana\u2019s speed and cost-efficiency have positioned it as a formidable contender. Amidst this competition, Retik Finance (RETIK) emerges as an exciting newcomer in the DeFi space. With its focus on bridging the gap between traditional finance and cryptocurrencies, Retik Finance has garnered attention for its innovative solutions and transparency. Investors must weigh the potential rewards and risks associated with each project and align their investments with their financial goals. The cryptocurrency market is dynamic, and opportunities for growth and innovation abound.

        "content": "JPMorgan expressed skepticism about the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) likelihood of approving spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by May, marking the first deadline for such approvals. According to Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, a representative from JPMorgan, the SEC\u2019s classification of ETH as a commodity, similar to Bitcoin, is crucial for approving spot Ethereum ETFs. Panigirtzoglou stated:\n\nFor the SEC to approve spot Ethereum ETFs in May, it would need to classify Ethereum as a commodity (similar to Bitcoin) rather than a security. This is far from given, and I wouldn\u2019t put more than a 50% chance to the SEC classifying Ethereum as a commodity before May.\n\nThe SEC recently approved spot Bitcoin ETFs, a significant development after over a decade of rejections. Traders are optimistic that spot Ethereum ETFs could be the next in line for approval. However, Panigirtzoglou emphasized that the SEC is still signaling its stance, indicating that it views all cryptocurrencies outside Bitcoin as securities. Last year, JPMorgan suggested that U.S. lawmakers might create a new category for ETH to avoid classifying it as a security.\n\nWill Ethereum Follow Bitcoin\u2019s Footsteps?\n\nMeanwhile, ETH\u2019s price experienced a notable surge between January 10 and January 12, gaining 13.5%. This boost saw the cryptocurrency break above $2,650 for the first time since May 2022. The catalyst for this rally appears to be the recent approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nSource: CoinMarketcap\n\nInvestors question whether cryptocurrency can maintain its current market capitalization of $322 billion. Over the past 60 days, ETH\u2019s price has outpaced Bitcoin\u2019s positive move, gaining 27% compared to Bitcoin\u2019s 24%.\n\nThe approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs was expected to increase Bitcoin\u2019s price by opening up new opportunities for clients who could not directly acquire cryptocurrency. However, ETH\u2019s recent surge has led to speculation about its potential to steal Bitcoin\u2019s thunder in the market.\n\nBloomberg ETF analysts currently estimate a 70% chance of an Ethereum ETF approval by May, in contrast to a 95% likelihood for Bitcoin. Major asset managers, including BlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale, and VanEck, are anticipating the final SEC decision on spot Ethereum ETFs by May 23. Some analysts, considering the precedent set by Bitcoin, believe the final decision might come sooner than anticipated.\n\nRelated Reading | FTX Customers Demand Fair Compensation For Crypto Losses"

        "content": "In a significant move for the cryptocurrency market, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently gave the green light to a spot Bitcoin ETF, albeit with a touch of hesitation. With this breakthrough, attention within the crypto community is now shifting toward Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, as speculations arise regarding the SEC\u2019s stance on an exchange-traded fund tracking its performance.\n\nThe year 2023 witnessed a surge in ETF-related news, particularly with various companies filing applications for both Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) products. The momentum gained momentum, especially after BlackRock entered the arena mid-year, inspiring other entities to follow suit.\n\nWhile nearly a dozen BTC ETFs are now actively trading on US stock markets, the spotlight has shifted to Ethereum. Notable companies, including Grayscale, are vying to launch ETH ETFs, with attempts to convert their existing ETH Trust into a spot ETF, mirroring their success with the flagship GBTC Trust.\n\nDespite the growing interest, the SEC has consistently delayed decisions on these applications, pushing most of them to wait until May. Historically, the Commission has been known to either delay or reject crypto ETFs for years before granting approval. The lingering question now is whether this pattern will hold true in the case of Ethereum.\n\nTo gauge community sentiment, analytics platform Santiment conducted a poll, revealing that over 52% of respondents believe the US will witness a spot Ethereum ETF by the end of the year. A further 10% are even more optimistic, predicting approval as early as this month, while 11.3% are skeptical, asserting that it may never materialize.\n\nPrice Effects and Market Dynamics\n\nA historical analysis of similar developments in the cryptocurrency market, such as the approval of Bitcoin ETFs, offers insights into potential price effects. BTC experienced a surge in the months leading up to SEC approvals, with a notable spike on the first day of trading. However, this upward trend reversed swiftly, resulting in a significant slump of almost $8,000 within 36 hours post-approval.\n\nThis trend, commonly referred to as \u201csell-the-news,\u201d has given astute investors an advantage. Interestingly, Ethereum\u2019s price has only recently begun to climb, possibly indicating a speculative run as market participants anticipate the approval of an ETH ETF.\n\nThe Road Ahead for Ethereum ETF Approval\n\nWhile the SEC\u2019s recent approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF has generated optimism within the crypto community, the path to Ethereum ETF approval remains uncertain. The Commission\u2019s historical tendency to delay or reject crypto ETFs raises questions about the timeline for Ethereum\u2019s inclusion in the market.\n\nGrayscale\u2019s efforts to convert its ETH Trust into a spot ETF, following the success of the GBTC Trust, underscore the industry\u2019s eagerness for diverse investment opportunities. The involvement of major players like BlackRock further intensifies the anticipation for a broader range of crypto investment products.\n\nCommunity Insights and Expectations\n\nAs the Santiment poll indicates, a significant portion of the community is optimistic about the approval of a spot Ethereum ETF in 2024. The sentiment reflects a growing appetite for diverse crypto investment options and the belief that regulatory barriers are gradually lifting.\n\nConclusion: Navigating Uncertainty\n\nIn conclusion, the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF has set the stage for increased optimism and speculation within the crypto market. While Ethereum enthusiasts eagerly await a similar nod from the SEC, the historical context of regulatory decisions prompts caution. The journey toward a diversified crypto investment landscape continues, with Ethereum at the center of attention."

        "title": "Altcoin Mania: Ethereum Leads, But Optimism (OP) and Pullix (PLX) Ready to Outshine the Market! - Blockchain Reporter",
        "content": "Crypto enthusiasts and investors are hyped about 2024 being a very bullish year. With this bull market starting soon, Ethereum (ETH) has already claimed a front position, rallying when Bitcoin slides.\n\nHowever, there are two top altcoins that are set to outperform the market in 2024 \u2013 Optimism (OP) and Pullix (PLX). Read on to find out why these altcoins are set to outperform the market.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Leads the Bull Market, Crosses $2,400\n\nEthereum (ETH) has picked up after the recent drop in the $2,100 support level. The price of Ethereum is up by more than 12% on the weekly chart as it rallies past $2,400. The ETH rally has been accompanied by several positive reports.\n\nAccording to WuBlockchain, more than 78% of all Ethereum addresses are now in profit. In addition, there has been an acquisition spree as whales expect the price of Ethereum to continue increasing. LookOnChain reported that Justin Sun is at the heart of the acquisition.\n\nSun has purchased more than $143 million worth of Ethereum since January 1, as per LookOnChain. Other whales have joined the acquisitions as they expect altcoins to rally in 2024. While Ethereum has been on the upside, it is being outperformed by some top crypto coins, including Optimism.\n\nOptimism (OP) Soars As Binance Supports Network Upgrade\n\nThe world\u2019s biggest centralized crypto exchange, Binance, has announced that it will support the upcoming Optimism (OP) upgrade. In anticipation of this upgrade that has promised to bring increased efficiency to the Optimism crypto, the OP coin has been rallying.\n\nThe Optimism crypto has snapped its week-long downtrend, rallying by 14% to reach $3.70. This price puts OP in a good position to extend its gains. If the Optimism price reclaims the $4 resistance level, then it could rise as high as $5, making it one of the top altcoins to buy.\n\nPullix (PLX) To Lead the Altcoin Market in 2024\n\nPullx (PLX) is one of the newest platforms generating much buzz in the crypto space. PLX has been increasing, reaching $0.08 in the last week. However, analysts have predicted that this new DeFi coin could outperform the altcoin market in 2024. So, why are analysts bullish about this new coin?\n\nEveryone is talking about Pullix a lot because they see it as a potential first look at the future of cryptocurrency exchanges. Pullix is a type of hybrid exchange that contrasts conventional ones. It implies that consumers can benefit from the advantages of both DEXs and CEXs. Because of this, Pullix is made to provide users with a trading experience that is more seamless, affordable, and secure than that of any other exchange.\n\nPullix has branched out into international financial markets in an effort to give its customers as many options as possible. It currently offers trading in FX, ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds), and commodities as a result. With over $6.6 trillion in daily trade volume on the forex market, PLX is a worthwhile cryptocurrency to purchase.\n\nPullix and PLX have a lot of space to expand because these markets offer even more liquidity than cryptocurrency exchanges. Analysts project that in 2024, Pullix\u2019s price could rise by up to 100x due to this potential. PLX is one of the best DeFi coins to purchase as a result.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nWhile Ethereum is currently leading the altcoin rally, Optimism (OP) and Pullix (PLX) are the two top crypto coins you should watch out for. The upgrade brings significant improvement to Optimism and provides OP with room for growth. Meanwhile, Pullix has tapped markets bigger than crypto, giving it the potential for a parabolic price rise in 2024.\n\nFor more information regarding Pullix\u2019s presale see links below:\n\nVisit Pullix\n\nJoin The Pullix Communities"

        "content": "In a groundbreaking week for the cryptocurrency market, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has given the nod to 11 spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This pivotal decision has prompted a surge of anticipation regarding the possibility of a similar approval for the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, Ethereum.\n\nOver the past seven days, as the crypto community eagerly awaited the SEC\u2019s approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, Ethereum\u2019s price witnessed a notable uptick of 15.79%.

This positive outlook is supported by the market\u2019s response to Bitcoin ETF approvals and the overall growing interest in cryptocurrency investments.\n\nWhile Ethereum Futures ETFs had a somewhat underwhelming debut last year, experts believe that lessons learned from that experience will pave the way for a more successful launch of spot Ethereum ETFs.\n\nIn October 2023, the introduction of several Ethereum Futures ETFs left some speculators underwhelmed. Nine such ETFs were launched by prominent investment firms like ProShares, VanEck, Bitwise, Valkyrie, Kelly, and Volshares. However, upon their October 2 launch, Ether Futures attracted just under $2 million in flows.\n\nDespite the tepid debut of Ethereum Futures ETFs, industry experts remain optimistic about the potential success of spot Ethereum ETFs. They emphasize the lessons learned from the initial futures offerings and the heightened market interest in Ethereum as a valuable investment asset.\n\nAs the crypto community eagerly awaits further developments, the spotlight remains firmly on Ethereum, with analysts projecting potential approval of spot ETFs in the coming months.

Data from on-chain analytics platform Santiment has revealed Ethereum and other large market cap cryptos are now at extremely optimistic levels.\n\nEthereum Shines As Investor Optimism Persists After Bitcoin ETF\n\nBitcoin is enjoying its time in the spotlight, with a lot of discussions centered around the cryptocurrency and the performance of 11 spot ETFs in their first two days on the market. According to a social media post by Santiment, Bitcoin sentiment and discussion rate are now at their highest level since March 2023.\n\nNotably, other major cryptocurrencies have been quietly gaining ground.

        "content": "Ethereum, often referred to as the king of smart contract platforms, is on the cusp of a transformative upgrade known as Dencun.\n\nIn the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrencies, two significant developments have captured the attention of investors and enthusiasts alike. Ethereum (ETH), the pioneer of smart contract platforms, is gearing up for the highly-anticipated Dencun upgrade set to enhance its scalability and efficiency. Meanwhile, Retik Finance (RETIK), a rising star in the DeFi space, has made headlines by swiftly surpassing $7 million in its presale. In this article, we will delve into these exciting updates and their implications for the crypto market.\n\nEthereum's Dencun Upgrade: A Leap Forward in Scalability\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nEthereum, often referred to as the king of smart contract platforms, is on the cusp of a transformative upgrade known as Dencun. This upgrade also referred to as Cancun-Deneb, is slated for completion in the first quarter of 2024, and it promises to usher in a new era for the Ethereum blockchain. The primary focus of the Dencun upgrade is to address some of the pressing challenges that Ethereum faces, namely scalability, efficiency, and security. These improvements are set to be achieved through a series of Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs). One of the notable EIPs that will be implemented as part of the Dencun upgrade is EIP-4844, also known as proto-danksharding. This proposal is expected to bring tangible benefits to Ethereum end-users, particularly in the form of reduced gas fees for layer-two (L2) transactions. Lower gas fees are a welcome development for the Ethereum community, as they enhance the cost-effectiveness of using the network. The Dencun upgrade follows the successful Shanghai upgrade, which enabled staked ETH withdrawals in April 2023. With nine EIPs slated for implementation, the Dencun upgrade marks the beginning of \"The Surge\" era in Ethereum's development roadmap. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has expressed the network's ambitious goals during The Surge, emphasising the removal of scalability bottlenecks. The ultimate aim is to achieve a staggering \"10,000 transactions per second and beyond.\" This monumental scaling effort will pave the way for Ethereum to handle mass-scale adoption effectively. Key among the EIPs within the Dencun upgrade is proto-danksharding, which is poised to play a pivotal role in enabling Ethereum's transition to layer-two rollups. The reduction in gas fees for Ethereum L2s is expected to drive an ecosystem-wide shift towards rollups, further enhancing Ethereum's scalability.\n\nClick Here To Buy RETIK Tokens\n\nRetik Finance (RETIK): Surpassing $7 Million in Presale\n\nWhile Ethereum's Dencun upgrade is poised to elevate the network to new heights, Retik Finance (RETIK) has been making waves in the decentralised finance (DeFi) space. The project's remarkable performance in its presale has caught the attention of investors and underscores its potential as a game-changer. Retik Finance is on a mission to reshape the world of finance by offering a range of innovative DeFi solutions. These include DeFi debit cards, a next-gen payment gateway, AI-powered peer-to-peer (P2P) lending, and one of the most secure DeFi wallets available. The project's commitment to bridging the gap between cryptocurrencies and everyday life has resonated with investors seeking real-world applications for digital assets. The presale stage of Retik Finance has seen overwhelming interest and support from the crypto community. Investors have rushed to secure their stake in this promising project, and as a result, Retik Finance has surpassed $7 million in its presale, a significant milestone that was achieved earlier than expected. This impressive achievement in the presale highlights the enthusiasm and confidence that investors have in Retik Finance's core features and real-life application. As the project prepares to conclude its presale phase, it is poised for further growth and development in the rapidly evolving DeFi landscape.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies, Ethereum's upcoming Dencun upgrade promises to address key challenges and enhance the network's scalability and efficiency. This upgrade aligns with Ethereum's ambitious goal of achieving mass-scale adoption through layer-two rollups and reduced gas fees. Simultaneously, Retik Finance (RETIK) has emerged as a formidable player in the DeFi sector, with its groundbreaking DeFi solutions capturing the imagination of investors. Surpassing $7 million in its presale is a testament to the project's potential and the growing demand for DeFi platforms that bridge the gap between cryptocurrencies and real-world applications. As Ethereum and Retik Finance continue to make strides in their respective journeys, the crypto market remains as vibrant and exciting as ever, with innovation and adoption at the forefront of these developments. Investors and enthusiasts are eagerly awaiting the positive impact these two projects will have on the crypto landscape in the coming months.\n\nClick Here To Take Part In Retik Finance Presale\n\nVisit the links below for more information about Retik Finance (RETIK):\n\nWebsite: https://retik.com\n\nWhitepaper: https://retik.com/retik-whitepaper.pdf\n\nLinktree: https://linktr.ee/retikfinance\n\n\u201cCrypto products and NFTs are unregulated and can be highly risky.
