        "content": "One year after one of the most talked about software upgrades since the Y2K changeover more than two decades ago, crypto\u2019s most important commercial highway risks becoming a victim of its own success.\n\nThe revamp of the Ethereum network , which was known as the Merge, turned out to be a seamless transition to a more energy-efficient system of ordering transactions on the blockchain. One of the incentives offered to participants is the ability to earn a yield on tokens used to help the network run. Surging demand for the so-called staking feature has now raised the prospect of the network bogging itself down."

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nIn a new tweet, on-chain analytics firm Santiment notes that the second largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum (ETH), and Binance USD (BUSD) stablecoin are seeing dormant coin movements.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSantiment observes that Ethereum and BUSD have had historic dormant movements this week. This is because the average age at which both tokens have been sitting in wallets has become much younger after massive stagnation. In this regard, that of BUSD fell by 378 days, while that of Ethereum fell by 26 days.\n\n\ud83e\udd14 The average age in which #Ethereum and #BinanceCoin tokens have been sitting in wallets both became much younger after massive stagnation. Do you believe both coincide with the #FTX liquidations and sell-offs that began this week? https://t.co/RyFfUbMe22 pic.twitter.com/KfRZPtCZn1 \u2014 Santiment (@santimentfeed) September 15, 2023\n\nIt is speculated that this historic dormant movement might be related to the FTX-triggered liquidations and sell-offs that began earlier in the week.\n\nFTX, which currently controls over $3.4 billion in crypto assets, has been granted permission to sell its crypto holdings by a U.S. judge.\n\nFTX will be allowed to sell off in weekly batches, with a first-week restriction of $50 million and following weekly limits of $100 million. However, BTC and ETH can only be sold after giving the creditors' committee, ad hoc committee and the U.S. trustee a 10-day notice.\n\nThis aside, in recent weeks, Ethereum has seen dormant ICO-era whale wallets come to life. In the past week, a dormant pre-mine address that held 185 ETH worth $302,096 revived after 8.1 years.\n\nBinance moving to end support for BUSD\n\nAs part of its gradual move to end support for the BUSD stablecoin by 2024, crypto exchange Binance moved to burn several idle Binance-pegged tokens this week.\n\nOn Sept. 14, Binance set fire to idle Binance-pegged tokens, namely TUSDOLD (BSC), BUSD on the MATIC network, BUSD both on the BSC and BNB networks and BUSD on the TRX network.\n\nIn August, Binance announced it would gradually end support for BUSD, urging users to convert the token to other crypto assets by February next year. Paxos stopped issuing the stablecoin in February following a regulatory crackdown on the BUSD token."

        "title": "Bitcoin Dominates Ethereum In Daily Active Addresses Despite Lagging In TX Count - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Ethereum might be the king of smart contracts and the world\u2019s primary hub for decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) activity but onchain data suggests that Bitcoin is ahead in user engagement, interpreted by the number of daily active users, and network activity is at acceptable, healthy levels, reading from the number of daily transactions confirmed.\n\nBitcoin Leads Ethereum In Daily Active Addresses\n\nAccording to Artemis Terminal data on September 15, Bitcoin, despite being predominantly a transactional layer, enabling the peer-to-peer (P2P) transfer of value between addresses, has more daily active users than Ethereum.\n\nThis observation is even as Ethereum serves as a conduit of value since assets can be moved, just like in Bitcoin, and a smart contract platform for deploying trustless and automated decentralized applications (dapps). Some, like Uniswap, a decentralized exchange (DEX), process billions worth of transactions every month.\n\nOn September 15, Bitcoin had over 800,000 daily active addresses (DAA), more than twice those in Ethereum, which stood at slightly over 378,000. The only time there was a slight change was on September 13, when over 1 million addresses were activated on Ethereum.\n\nThen, the number of DAA on Bitcoin also fell to around 743,000. However, the DAA on Ethereum has fallen sharply while Bitcoin has maintained an upward trajectory since late August. During this time, Ethereum\u2019s DAA has been fluctuating heavily, as evidenced by the rise and fall on Sep 13 and through to today.\n\nEthereum Processes Over 1 Million Transactions Everyday\n\nEthereum shines in the number of daily transactions processed. When writing on September 15, the smart contract platform had processed over 1 million transactions while Bitcoin lagged, confirming less than 600,000.\n\nEven at this level, Ethereum has processed less than half of what it did on September 13, when the network processed over 2.3 million transactions. On the other hand, Bitcoin\u2019s daily transactions have been steady, while those of Ethereum have, on average, risen over the past three months, as Artemis Terminal data shows.\n\nDAA and daily transaction count are important metrics that on-chain analysts use to analyze the level of engagement and health of public blockchains.\n\nOver the past 18 months, activity has rapidly shrunk as asset prices fall in the crypto winter. Ethereum\u2019s drop from around $5,000 in late November 2021 to as low as $1,500 in 2022 weighed negatively on DeFi and NFT activity.\n\nAccording to DeFiLlama, the total value locked (TVL) of DeFi protocols has stabilized below $50 billion, down from around $180 billion in 2021. Meanwhile, trading volume has crashed by over 90%, dragging the value of NFT-related projects, including Immutable X and ApeCoin. To illustrate, APE is down 96% from peaks.\n\nFeature image from Canva, chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nIllustration by Mitchell Preffer for Decrypt.\n\nIt was another week of fairly stable prices for leading cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin (BTC) grew 3% over the seven days and started Saturday trading at $26,564, while Ethereum (ETH) remains more or less at the same price it was seven days ago at $1,636.\n\n\u200b\u200b\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEthereum\u2019s growth may have been hobbled by reports that its supply recently turned inflationary (meaning more Ether is issued than burned) in one of few such periods since the Merge in September 2022. Last week, Ethereum\u2019s supply increased by 4,092 ETH tokens worth around $6.6 million, per Ultrasound.money data.\n\nThe leading cryptocurrencies traded sideways all week, even after the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 (BLS) latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) on Wednesday revealed that inflation had risen a fraction above economists\u2019 projections last month due to rising gasoline prices.\n\nOnly three cryptocurrencies posted any notable price movement this week. Two tokens rallied: Bitcoin Cash (BCH) grew 11.5% to $213.79, while Toncoin (TON) blew up 23% to trade at $2.20.\n\nTON\u2019s explosive price movement this week was catalyzed by news on Wednesday that its parent company\u2014Telegram\u2014has integrated The Open Network blockchain\u2019s Web3 wallet into its messaging app, bringing easy access to TON for the app\u2019s 800 million users.\n\nThe move represents a symbolic win for Telegram. Technically, the company withdrew from involvement in TON in 2020 after litigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Telegram was accused of offering unregistered securities in the form of a token called Gram. It settled with the SEC by paying a fine of $18.5 million and returning unspent funds to investors.\n\nOne cryptocurrency notably depreciated over the week: Stellar (XLM) fell 9.3% to trade at $0.118263 at the time of writing. Its poor performance this week appears to be a correction from last week, when XLM rallied 10% off the back of a tweet that promised \u201csomething cool\u201d in ten days.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWas it a major network overhaul? Nope, it was a big-budget commercial with Idris Elba.\n\nIn the news: adoption!\n\nThere were more encouraging signs of crypto adoption throughout the global north this week.\n\nOn Monday, Sony subsidiary Sony Network Communications announced it was developing a blockchain network in collaboration with crypto tech firm Startale Labs. The Singapore-based joint venture will be known as Sony Network Communications Labs Pte. Ltd. It remains unclear what Sony may use the platform for.\n\nAmerican payments giant PayPal launched crypto to USD off-ramps on Tuesday. The move came after PayPal launched a crypto On Ramp integration last month, enabling direct crypto purchases to MetaMask and Ledger users. Undoubtedly, the company\u2019s biggest move in the space this year was the announcement of its own in-house greenback-pegged stablecoin PayPal USD.\n\nFinally, on Wednesday, Taurus\u2013a Swiss crypto fintech firm\u2014announced an agreement with Deutsche Bank. Deutsche Bank will also use Taurus\u2019 infrastructure to offer custody and tokenization services for its customers, according to a press release shared with Decrypt."

        "title": "Could This New Move From Cathie Wood and Ark Invest Send Ethereum Soaring? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "In what could be a big catalyst for Ethereum (ETH -0.54%), Cathie Wood's Ark Invest has filed an application for the first-ever spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF). This comes after a summer filled with twists and turns surrounding the launch and approval of the first-ever spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nSo could this new ETF from Ark Invest send the price of Ethereum soaring? There are several different factors to consider.\n\nInstitutional demand\n\nLet's face it -- the launch of a spot Ethereum ETF probably means little for the seasoned crypto investor. Why would you go to the added step of buying an ETF (which comes with management fees), when you can already go to a cryptocurrency exchange like Coinbase Global and buy Ethereum directly? The only allure of a spot crypto ETF is if you want exposure to crypto, but without the risk or hassle of investing directly in crypto.\n\nThe big reason a spot Ethereum ETF is so bullish for the markets is because it signals pent-up institutional demand for the world's second-largest cryptocurrency. Many institutional investors are unwilling or unable to purchase crypto directly, due to the constraints placed on them. Do you really want your pension fund or university endowment dabbling in a volatile, poorly regulated industry with significant risk of loss?\n\nBut the picture changes when you take into account a market-traded financial instrument that has been approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). According to the Ark Invest filing, the spot Ethereum ETF would trade on the CBOE BZX Exchange and custody its crypto assets with Coinbase. That essentially makes Ethereum \"safe\" (relatively speaking) for the world's biggest institutional investors. And that's where things get really exciting, because it could signal a tsunami of new money flowing into Ethereum. Theoretically, that new influx of money should boost Ethereum's price. It's just simple supply and demand.\n\nLessons from Bitcoin this summer\n\nAnd that, of course, brings us to what happened this summer, which was headlined by one big event: the decision by BlackRock, the world's biggest fund manager, to file for a spot Bitcoin ETF on June 15. That led to a flurry of follow-on filings from other institutional investors, a response by the SEC, and new adjustments to those filings in response to the SEC. Just about everyone -- including Ark Invest -- was trying to be first in line for the first-ever spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nAnd the market responded accordingly. The Bitcoin rally in June was very real. On the date of the BlackRock ETF filing, Bitcoin was trading around $25,000. Thirty days later, it was trading near $30,000, and bullish sentiment was risiing. It seemed to be a matter of not if, but when, a new spot Bitcoin ETF would be approved. Finally, it looked like Bitcoin was about to go mainstream.\n\nGranted, the effect on Ethereum is not going to be as great as for Bitcoin, simply due to the fact that institutional investors still prefer Bitcoin to Ethereum. But there is almost certain to be a similar type of effect, given that Ethereum now accounts for roughly 20% of the entire market cap of the crypto market.\n\nThe heavy hand of the SEC\n\nSo what could possibly go wrong? There's a short answer: the SEC. There's something about a spot Bitcoin ETF that the SEC doesn't like. Despite the fact that the SEC has already approved futures-based Bitcoin ETFs, it doesn't seem to want to approve a spot Bitcoin ETF. So it's uncertain how long the approval process could take. Ark Invest, for example, originally filed its first spot Bitcoin ETF application back in 2021.\n\nAnd, in the case of Ethereum, there's an added wrinkle. That's because Ark Invest is essentially skipping a step here. Unlike with Bitcoin, no futures-based Ethereum ETF has yet been approved in the U.S., although several applications have been filed. So Ark Invest is skipping from no Ethereum ETF in the U.S. to spot Ethereum ETF without the intermediate step of a futures-based Ethereum ETF.\n\nThe big picture\n\nDespite these regulatory challenges, the big picture is that the decision by Ark Invest to file for a spot Ethereum ETF appears to signal that there's plenty of institutional demand for Ethereum. As crypto becomes more and more of a mainstream asset class for institutional investors, that's huge for Ethereum's future prospects. So buckle up: This could get interesting if Cathie Wood ever gets SEC approval for the first-ever spot Ethereum ETF."
