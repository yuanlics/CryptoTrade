        "content": "ETMarkets.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe major crypto tokens were trading lower on Monday. Meanwhile, the global cryptocurrency market cap declined 0.5% to around $1.09 trillion in the last 24 hours.Bitcoin was down 0.5% at $27,806, while Ethereum was below the $1,650 level.XRP, Solana, Dogecoin , Polygon, Polkadot, and Litecoin were trading in the red, while Toncoin was trading in the green.\"Bitcoin has been trading close to the $28000 level over the weekend. This price movement is in the wake of US non-farm payroll data reporting 336,000 jobs added in September versus economist forecasts for just 170,000. If BTC remains well above the current level, we can see it breach the $28,350 level. If not, support lies at $27,800 level,\" said Edul Patel, CEO of Mudrex.The total volume in DeFi is currently $2.24 billion, 12.36% of the total crypto market 24-hour volume. The volume of all stablecoins is now $16.28 billion, which is 89.84% of the total crypto market 24-hour volume.Bitcoin's dominance is currently 49.98%, according to CoinMarketCap. Meanwhile, BTC volume in the last 24 hours stood at approximately $7.8 billion, rising 14.5% in the last 24 hours.\"Trading close to $28k, BTC has been maintaining firm support at $27k. Even though there has been a BTC sell-off from short-term holders, the support levels come in as long-term holders are buying more. In fact, last week, the supply held by the long-term buyers stood at 15.6 million BTCs, as opposed to the short-term holder supply of 3.8 million BTCs\u2014the first time since November 2015,\" said Parth Chaturvedi, Investments Lead at CoinSwitch Ventures.Tech view by ZebPay Trade DeskBitcoin maintained its upward pressure, nearing the $28,000 mark as the week closed on October 8th. Geopolitical uncertainty became a factor for traders during this period. The price of BTC exhibited resilience, avoiding significant downward volatility over the weekend. It recovered from a sudden test of the $27,000 level on October 6th, primarily due to surprising employment data in the United States that contrasted with policy adjustments by the Federal Reserve. As the new week began, the $28,000 resistance level became the primary focus for market participants.Bitcoin, after testing the crucial support level of $25,000 (Horizontal Trendline & 50% Fibonacci Retracement Level) has witnessed a relief rally and the prices went up to $28,580. The asset broke the downsloping trendline. However, it failed to break the resistance of $28,500. Currently, BTC is consolidating from $28,250 to $27,000. Once it breaks and sustains above $28,500, it may go up to $32,500 and to witness a rally, BTC needs to break, close and maintain above the key resistance level of $32,500.(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

        "content": "Bitcoin inscriptions, a new way to store data on the Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) blockchain, have surpassed 35 million since their inception in January.\n\nOrdinals are digital artifacts that can be inscribed onto Bitcoin using the Ordinals protocol.\n\nThey can be anything from text files, images, and audio to videos, and can be used to store a wide variety of data on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nAccording to a report by Galaxy Digital, text files represent the vast majority of Bitcoin inscriptions, accounting for approximately 95% of all inscriptions.\n\nAlso Read: People Are Going To Start Cashing Out Bitcoin \u2014 Here's Why\n\nImage-based inscriptions account for approximately 3.5% of all inscriptions, with the remaining 1.5% consisting of other types of digital artifacts.\n\nOrdinals Activity Since March: In the first 200 days since the first inscription on Bitcoin, a total of 1.14 million image-based inscriptions have been created.\n\nThis surpasses the number of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) minted on other blockchains, such as Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH), Solana (CRYPTO: SOL), and Polygon (CRYPTO: MATIC), since the debut of NFTs on these respective networks.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that Bitcoin's minting activity throughout the first 200 days is still much lower than the total minting activity for NFTs on other blockchains, illustrating how Ordinals still have a long way to go in terms of adoption relative to the broader NFT ecosystem.\n\nOrdinals Trading Volume: Despite the unfavorable market conditions for NFTs in 2023, Ordinals accomplished meaningful growth.\n\nBitcoin has accumulated the third-highest NFT trading volume by the network at $596.4 million.\n\nEven when excluding BRC-20s, which represent ~30% of all Ordinals volume ($187.5 million), Bitcoin remains the third most popular chain for digital collectible activity after Ethereum and Solana.\n\nOrdinals Marketplaces: The most dominant marketplaces by volume for Ordinals are now Magic Eden, Unisat, and OKX at 28%, 28%, and 38% respectively.\n\nImplications for the Future of Bitcoin: The growing popularity of Bitcoin inscriptions is a significant development for the Bitcoin ecosystem.\n\nIt suggests that Bitcoin is being used for more than just a store of value and a medium of exchange. It is also being used to store and share data, which could lead to new and innovative use cases for Bitcoin in the future.\n\nFor example, Bitcoin inscriptions could be used to create a decentralized social media platform or a decentralized storage platform. They could also be used to create new forms of digital art and collectibles.\n\nRead Next: Bitcoin To $20K, Ethereum To $1K?

The largest individual liquidation occurred on Binance, involving the ETH/BUSD pair with a value of $4.53 million.\n\nCoinGlass data reveals that a staggering $105 million of long positions, which were speculative bets on price increases, were entirely wiped out.
