Bitcoin operates on a simple blockchain technology, making it a secure and decentralized ledger for transactions. Ethereum expands on this technology by integrating \"smart contracts\" for decentralized applications. Bitcoin's scarcity makes it an attractive hedge against inflation, while Ethereum's potential for growth through dApps could lead to increased demand and value. Both have different future prospects, with Bitcoin gaining acceptance as a viable form of payment and Ethereum undergoing significant technological upgrades.
