The top 10 holders of Ethereum and Shiba Inu, on the other hand, have cut their holdings on exchanges by 4.3% and 2.7%, respectively, over the past 90 days.\n\nEthereum is trading at $2,306 at time of writing, while Shiba Inu is changing hands at $0.0000106. Fetch.ai is priced at $0.729 at time of writing, up by 259% from its October 23rd price of $0.203.\n\nEarlier this week, Santiment said that the supply of Ethereum on exchanges had reached a new low since the official launch of the second-largest crypto asset by market cap.\n\n\u201cAs Ethereum\u2019s market value hangs just above $2,170, the largest exchange wallets continue to move coins into smaller wallets or off exchanges entirely. 240,000 ETH has been collectively moved from these wallets in 24 hours, a 2.99% drop in coins held.\u201d\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "title": "Ethereum Faces Crossroads as Solana Gains Ground in Smart Contract Dominance - ZyCrypto",
        "content": "Advertisement\n\nEthereum (ETH), the once-revered pioneer in smart contract platforms, now finds itself at a crucial juncture as Solana (SOL) makes significant strides in the domain.\n\nOver the past week, the cryptocurrency community has been abuzz with discussions sparked by Solana\u2019s 800% YTD price surge and the ecosystem\u2019s impressive growth, with some speculating about its potential to surpass Ethereum. The ongoing debate revolves around scalability, transaction fees, and the fundamental shift from Proof of Work (PoW) to Proof of Stake (PoS) that Ethereum made.\n\nNotably, Ethereum\u2019s troubles seem to compound, with the ultra-sound money narrative faltering as Ether (ETH) faces a 30% decline year-to-date against Bitcoin (BTC). Simultaneously, it\u2019s losing ground to Solana on the smart contract front, as highlighted by popular trader Rip Vanwinkle on Saturday via X (formerly Twitter).\n\nAccording to Vanwinkle, Ethereum\u2019s move from Proof of Work (PoW) to Proof of Stake (PoS) was a betrayal of its initial principles. In the tweet, he argued that the transition aimed at enriching founders and insiders by enabling them to stake ETH and profit from fees that would otherwise be burned as gas. This transition, according to him, undermined Ethereum\u2019s core purpose as a gas token and challenged the principles of decentralization.\n\nIn response to these criticisms, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has recently acknowledged the need for improvements, noting they are actively working on the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade. This upgrade intends to address scalability and transaction fee issues by implementing a PoS consensus mechanism. However, the success of this transition remains uncertain, leaving Ethereum vulnerable to the growing popularity of Solana.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is important to note that Solana\u2019s appeal lies in its scalability and cost-effectiveness for smart contracts. Despite lacking complete decentralization, users prioritize low fees and fast transactions over absolute decentralization.\n\nMeanwhile, the broader cryptocurrency landscape has witnessed a surge in smart contract platform tokens, with Solana and Avalanche closing in on Ethereum and Binance Coin (BNB). Notably, in terms of value, Solana has experienced a 67% surge in the past month, positioning itself as the closest contender to Ethereum which is up only 11%.\n\nAdditionally, as highlighted by ZyCrypto, Solana\u2019s Decentralized Exchange (DEX) trading volumes surpassed those of Ethereum for the first time in history this week, holding consistently for three days. Digital asset platform Coinchange has even predicted that this trend could extend to the Total Value Locked (TVL) in DeFi in the near future.\n\nThat said, Ethereum\u2019s fate in this evolving landscape remains uncertain as it grapples with internal challenges and external competition. It thus remains to be seen whether Ethereum can maintain its dominance as a smart contract platform."

        "title": "3 reasons why Ether (ETH) could rally above $2,500 - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Ether (ETH) last approached the $2,400 resistance on Dec. 9 but failed to break through, resulting in a retest of the $2,120 support level. This time, investors are gaining confidence in surpassing this level, venturing into territory not seen since May 2022, before the collapse of the Terra ecosystem. On Dec. 22, Ether stood out with a 4% increase, while Bitcoin (BTC) and BNB (BNB) remained primarily unchanged.\n\nWhile the spotlight is on the exchange-traded fund (ETF) narrative as the primary driver of recent cryptocurrency gains, there are several reasons supporting Ether\u2019s price surge that could potentially push it above $2,500 before the expected ETF approval in mid-January, although the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) might take until March.\n\nEthereum network DApp volumes and protocol fees\n\nRather than attempting to predict the future, which is a challenging task in the fast-paced cryptocurrency industry, it\u2019s more prudent to analyze recent trends influencing the demand for Ether using decentralized applications (DApps) activity as an indicator. One can start by examining DApp volumes, as some sectors do not require a large total value locked (TVL), such as nonfungible token marketplaces, games, layer-2 bridges and social networks.\n\n7-day DApp volumes per blockchain in U.S. dollars. Source: DappRadar\n\nEthereum DApp volumes reached $27.8 billion in the last seven days, marking a 14.2% increase on the previous week. This growth was driven by a 21% gain in Uniswap and a 52% gain in Balancer volumes. In contrast, BNB Chain\u2019s volumes for the same period stood at $4.5 billion, while Arbitrum amassed another $5 billion. Most notably, Ethereum was the only blockchain among the top six to experience a volume increase in the past seven days.\n\nTo provide some perspective, Solana (SOL) would need to increase by 12 times to reach half of Ethereum DApps\u2019 current transaction volume. In general, 20% of users account for 80% of the volume, which holds for DApps. Given Ethereum\u2019s first-mover advantage and substantial treasury for ecosystem development support, the odds do not favor a flipping in the short to medium term.\n\nFurthermore, no other blockchain can match Ethereum\u2019s protocol, which generated $95.4 million in fees in the last seven days, excluding Bitcoin, which is not a direct competitor in the DApp ecosystem. Aside from incentivizing network security, this data indicates significant potential for increased activity following future updates, including \u2019DenCun\u2019 scheduled for January, which aims to enhance processing capacity and reduce costs.\n\nEthereum spot ETF approval is not priced in according to derivatives markets\n\nThe eventual approval of the Ether spot ETF will set Ether apart from other cryptocurrencies in terms of regulation. Competitors have only been nominally mentioned by regulators in recent court cases against exchanges, which face charges for offering securities brokerage and services without proper registration.\n\nRelated: Community responds to Gary Gensler\u2019s latest jab at crypto\n\nFinally, investors should assess the positioning of Ether derivatives traders, especially large investors and market makers. The Ether futures premium, measuring the difference between two-month contracts and the spot price, has reached its highest level in over a year. In a healthy market, the annualized premium, or basis rate, typically falls within the 5% to 10% range.\n\nEther two-month futures premium vs. spot markets. Source: Laevitas.ch\n\nThe current 13.5% Ether futures annualized premium suggests that traders are not taking the spot Ether ETF approval for granted. During widespread excitement, this indicator tends to exceed 20%, driven by increased demand for leveraged long positions, causing price distortions relative to the spot market. This data implies the potential for a positive price impact in case of approval, whether in January or March.\n\nBased on Ethereum\u2019s network activity, Ether investors should not yield to the pressure from contenders gaining momentum, at least not until these contenders pose a genuine threat in terms of volumes and deposits. Furthermore, the ETH derivatives indicator provides clear guidance that professional traders are bullish despite Ether\u2019s price nearing its highest level since May 2022. This suggests that investors are confident in Ether\u2019s ability to break above $2,500.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.
