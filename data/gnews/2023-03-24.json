        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s price has been consolidating over the past week as the price is struggling to break above a key resistance area. Did ETH mark a local top?\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nBy: Edris\n\nThe Daily Chart:\n\nOn the daily time frame, ETH\u2019s price has broken above the symmetrical triangle pattern lately and above the 50-day moving average line (around the $1600 mark). However, ETH is trading inside a very tight range above the broken triangle and has yet to break with confidence above the $1800 level.\n\nIf the market fails, a pullback toward the 50-day and even the 200-day moving average located around the $1600 and $1400 levels, respectively, could be expected. On the other hand, a valid break above the $1800 level could lead to another short-term rally \u2013 first to target the $2K level for the first time in 2023, and then a further target amind the $2300 area.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart\n\nOn the 4-hour chart, the consolidation becomes more evident, as the price has been bouncing around the $1800 resistance level. The RSI indicator has been indicating a clear bearish divergence signal for a while, which could point to a pullback in the coming days.\n\nIn this case, the $1650 level could be retested as support, followed by the $1500 level. However, it is still too soon to predict whether the bullish trend will continue or reverse, as the market has yet to decide amid the $1800 resistance.\n\nOn-Chain Analysis\n\nBy: Edris\n\nEthereum Open Interest\n\nEthereum\u2019s price has steadily climbed over the last few months, following a reversal around the $1000 support mark. However, the futures market behaves quite differently from the previous few times when the market experienced short-term rallies during the recent bear market.\n\nThe open interest metric (OI) measures the daily number of open futures contracts and is a handy indicator for evaluating the futures market sentiment. Generally, rising open interests are followed by high volatility and bearish reversals. However, the open interest has remained relatively low during the recent rally.\n\nAs a result, the uptrend could still be sustained as there is a lower chance of long liquidation cascades occurring in the short term. Note \u2013 the spot market should also be considered in order to make more precise predictions."

        "title": "Better Buy: Ethereum or Polygon? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Amid all the excitement surrounding The Merge last year, the fortunes of Ethereum (ETH 1.51%) and Polygon (MATIC 1.81%) appeared to be inextricably linked. After all, Polygon was the most popular Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum, so any future growth in the Ethereum ecosystem implied future growth in the Polygon ecosystem. But fast forward to 2023, and it looks like the paths of these two cryptocurrencies are starting to diverge.\n\nWhile both cryptos are up about 50% for the year, it's their performance over the past 30 days that's the most troubling. During that time, Ethereum was up about 10%, while Polygon was down 17%. Is this a short-term mispricing in the marketplace or a sign for investors that Polygon's future growth prospects are coming under pressure?\n\nWhat happened to Polygon's growth?\n\nOn the surface, the growth story for Polygon remains in place. It's arguably still the most popular Layer 2 in the Ethereum ecosystem and has some of the best technology out there for making Ethereum run faster, better, and more efficiently.\n\nMoreover, there are still plenty of top brands and companies utilizing Polygon for new Web3 initiatives. As a result, Polygon has a market capitalization of $9.8 billion, making it one of the top 10 cryptos in the world.\n\nHowever, look beneath the surface, and the picture gets a bit murkier because there's been a steep falloff in growth at Polygon since December.\n\nFor example, consider the number of new Polygon addresses being created on a daily basis. These are down 32% from mid-February levels, a warning sign that developers and users could be looking elsewhere when deciding to build on top of Ethereum. Even more troubling, Polygon recently said it was cutting of 20% of its team.\n\nThe crowded Layer 2 field\n\nWhat's going on here? The problems at Polygon could be linked to the emergence of new competition.\n\nPolygon isn't the only Layer 2 option that developers have, and it's starting to become very evident now. For example, Optimism (OP) seemingly exploded out of nowhere this year to become a super-popular Layer 2 scaling solution. For the year, it's up more than 170%.\n\nOptimism recently made headlines as the result of a high-profile partnership with crypto exchange operator Coinbase Global. If you look at key blockchain metrics such as total value locked (TVL), Optimism appears to be narrowing the gap with Polygon.\n\nMoreover, there are other Layer 2 names out there that are generating buzz. Another top Layer 2 solution is Immutable X (IMX -2.93%), which is up more than 200% this year. It now has a market cap of over $1 billion, making it the No. 53 crypto in the world.\n\nBut the name that everyone is talking about now is Arbitrum, which is about to get its own crypto token soon. According to some traders, the price of Polygon could sink as much as 15% as soon as the new Arbitrum token starts trading.\n\nLayer 1 or Layer 2?\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum has shown little-to-no impact from the recent spate of bank failures and bank runs and is now being mentioned as a potential safe haven for investors thinking about moving their money into crypto. According to Cathie Wood of Ark Invest, Ethereum has not \"skipped a beat\" during the recent market upheaval, and that should be very reassuring to investors.\n\nUltimately, the choice of whether to invest in Ethereum or Polygon comes down to a single question: Do you feel more comfortable investing in a Layer 1 or a Layer 2 blockchain? While there's a lot of exciting activity happening at the Layer 2 level, the field is getting so crowded now that investing in a Layer 1 looks a lot more appealing.\n\nFinally, keep in mind track records. Ethereum has a proven track record dating back to 2015 and managed to pull off The Merge in 2022 amid one of the worst crypto meltdowns ever. If you're looking for a crypto to ride out the gathering financial storm, the clear choice now is Ethereum."

        "content": "DotNames\n\nDotNames puts an end to the need of remembering lengthy wallet addresses by allowing users the option of customizing usernames and using them instead of their addresses.\n\nLondon, UK, March 24, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Despite attaining new and unimaginable heights, there are many hassles in the crypto space that need to be addressed. Not just this, but many of the features and innovations being offered are complex and difficult to adopt. The crypto world needs to make its process simple and more user-oriented. Among the many problems faced by investors, memorization of the 42-character-long Ethereum address is perhaps the most problematic of all. What the sector needs right now is a solution to this hindrance. DotNames is a newbie firm in the crypto sector that caters to this issue.\n\nWhat is DotNames\n\nUsers in the crypto space have been subjected to great anguish since the advent of the Ethereum addresses in 2015. They are an absolute nuisance since remembering them is almost near impossible. Individuals who have more than one wallet do not even bother to try and memorize these long codes anymore.\n\nDotNames is a superlative cryptocurrency firm that puts an end to this problem by providing customized domains. Individuals who have trouble remembering their wallet addresses can create a user name of their choice and use it instead of their address. The DotName username can be as short or long as one wishes for and can have any character.\n\nInstant Utility\n\nThe firm has launched a mini wallet dApp which gives utility to the DotName domains. Individuals wishing to send tokens to other users simply have to enter that person\u2019s DotName domain in the transfer section of the wallet instead of the lengthy 42-character address.\n\nA similar process is followed when receiving tokens. Users simply have to share their DotName domains with the sender to experience a seamless transfer of assets at the rate of knots.\n\nStore Limitless Data\n\nAnother great use case of the DotName domain is that it can be utilized for storing almost anything. This can be bios, personal information, and specific information. The information stored is 100% secure and only the domain owner has permission to modify that data.\n\nStory continues\n\nDecentralized\n\nThe world is rapidly adopting the concept of decentralization in all spheres. DotName is no different. It employs blockchain technology to offer a decentralized environment for its users. This means that only domain owners can update or change the name and specifications of the address.\n\nCustomizable\n\nWallet addresses allotted by Ethereum are always too prolix and users have no say in what they want their addresses to be. With DotNames, this is no longer the case. Since DotName domains are a replacement for Ethereum addresses, users can thus give them any name that they want.\n\nStorage\n\nCompanies or individuals looking for a place to store important data can also make use of DotNames. The firm allows users to store any type and amount of data. This data is linked to their DotName domains.\n\nTokenomics\n\nThe endurance and longevity of any cryptocurrency firm are highly dependent on how well the company manages its finances. For this reason, DotNames has laid down a well-considered Tokenomics.\n\nThe native token of the firm, $DNS has a total supply of 100 million coins. For every transaction, the firm fixes a 6% tax. The tax rates have been kept low to refrain from burdening traders.\n\nDotNames efficiently utilizes the tax collected for the benefit of the community and the firm itself. A 5% tax is used for marketing purposes. Marketing is of utmost importance for alluring new investors. The remaining 1% of the tax is used for development.\n\nThe firm uses 50% of the generated revenue for a buyback. $DNS tokens obtained via buyback are burned to reduce the circulating supply. The reduced supply together with an increased demand for the token helps to ameliorate the price of the token.\n\nRoadmap\n\nDotNames has divided its roadmap into three major parts. Ignition, Ascent, and Orbit. Ignition, the first part has been completed. Ascent is still in progress, which will be closely followed by Orbit.\n\nFinal Words\n\nDotNames offers its services on leading blockchains such as Ethereum, Arbitrum, and Polygon. The firm and its multi-utility token are bound to have a lasting impact on the crypto sector.\n\nTo learn more about the project, visit the official website, read the whitepaper, or follow DotNames on social media to become a part of the DotNames community:\n\nWebsite | Twitter | Telegram | Medium\n\n\n\nDisclaimer:\n\nThe information provided in this release is not investment advice, financial advice, or trading advice.
