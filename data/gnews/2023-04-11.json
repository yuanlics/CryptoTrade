This reduces immediate sell pressure as capital moves to the sidelines, and future sell-offs are expected to be limited."

It is also just 2% above the pair\u2019s local low of 0.0622 BTC from March 20, showing that Ether\u2019s bullish reversal attempt versus Bitcoin is near failure.\n\nInterestingly, institutional interest also appears to gravitate more toward Bitcoin than Ethereum, according to CoinShares\u2019 weekly report.

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s Shanghai/Capella upgrade \u2014 also known by the portmanteau Shapella \u2014 may not be the technical marvel of last year\u2019s \u201cMerge\u201d or introduce turbocharged speeds to the network.\n\nVolumes of over 100,000 transactions per second will have to wait for future \u201cdanksharding\u201d upgrades, according to the Ethereum Foundation.\n\nBut the hard fork remains an important step on Ethereum\u2019s roadmap to the future, i.e., further shoring up the network\u2019s new validation mechanism while (potentially) removing barriers for institutional investors.\n\nCurrently scheduled for 10:27 pm UTC on April 12, the upgrade will allow stakers to unlock their Ether (ETH) rewards \u2014 or even exit staking entirely \u2014 for the first time since September\u2019s Merge.\n\nIt's happening\n\n\n\nShapella is scheduled on mainnet for epoch 194048, scheduled for 22:27:35 UTC on Apr. 12, 2023\n\n\n\nClient releases compatible with the upgrade are listed in the announcement below https://t.co/I0hSv9lnjz \u2014 timbeiko.eth \u2600\ufe0f (@TimBeiko) March 28, 2023\n\nPre-fork publicity hasn\u2019t matched that surrounding last autumn\u2019s change of consensus mechanisms from proof-of-work to a proof-of-stake (PoS). \u201cThis time, we won\u2019t have a war room,\u201d Freddy Zwanzger, Ethereum ecosystem lead at Blockdaemon, told Cointelegraph. Still, \u201cthere\u2019s always risks\u201d when one reshuffles the deck like this.\n\nEthereum\u2019s stakers and validators will shortly be able to withdraw $32 billion of Ether from the Beacon Chain, which accounts for about 15% of the ETH\u2019s circulating supply, according to Coinbase\u2019s April 5 newsletter. Some worry that the upgrade, also known as the Shanghai hard fork, may lower the overall number of validators and put selling pressure on the network, among other concerns.\n\n\u201cEvery hard fork brings some upgrade risk,\u201d Paul Brody, EY\u2019s global blockchain leader, told Cointelegraph, especially in cases like this where you\u2019re enabling withdrawals. On the technical side, there could be bugs latent since \u201cday zero\u201d in some of the network\u2019s staking smart contracts, for example, that may not emerge until the withdrawal date \u2014 though Brody doesn\u2019t think that\u2019s likely.\n\nThe upgrade should mitigate risks for investors. \u201cLower volatility plus a yield makes for a more familiar and less risky asset to hold long-term,\u201d Rich Rosenblum, co-founder and president at GSR, a crypto market-making firm, told Cointelegraph.\n\nMore institutional investors?\n\nWill Shapella really attract more institutional investors to the blockchain, as some believe? Research and brokerage firm AB Bernstein stated in a late-February research report that the upgrade could bring in staking from new institutional investors, and Blockdaemon\u2019s Zwanzger, whose firm has many institutional clients, foresees more interest in Ethereum staking opportunities from large professional investors. Some institutional investors have been reluctant to lock up funds without a clear withdrawal option.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s probably going to be a queue for the first couple of weeks,\u201d Zwanzger said. \u201cSo they might be better off waiting until that comes down to normal levels.\u201d\n\nAccording to Rosenblum, \u201cOnce the PoS network is fully operational, more institutions will feel comfortable holding ETH, especially once the staking yield becomes more accessible.\u201d\n\nEY\u2019s Brody, on the other hand, doesn\u2019t see much of a change. \u201cA lot of the big institutional investors that we know and work with are basically sitting on the sidelines. They want to comply, but they want to be more comfortable that they know what the rules are.\u201d Comprehensive crypto reform legislation in the United States would probably be more likely to get them off the sidelines.\n\nLonger-term risks\n\nSo what about regulatory risk, particularly in the United States? For years Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether were thought to be impervious to Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) scrutiny, with many U.S. regulators tacitly agreeing that the native coins for decentralized systems like these were more like commodities than securities, placing them under the Commodity Futures Trading Commission\u2019s jurisdiction. But with Ethereum\u2019s move to a staking validation mechanism, some think the SEC may now have Ethereum in its sights.\n\nStill, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t consider it a significant risk for the network,\u201d even if that happens, said Zwanzger. The Ethereum protocol is global, and not all jurisdictions will likely share the SEC\u2019s view of what needs regulating. Of course, other countries could ultimately choose to follow the U.S., so one never knows.\n\nOthers worry that Ethereum\u2019s move to staking may herald increasing network centralization. In March, Cointelegraph reported that \u201cconcentration of ETH staked through third parties raises concerns over decentralization at Lido and Coinbase in particular.\u201d\n\nRecent: Crypto audits and bug bounties are broken: Here\u2019s how to fix them\n\n\u201cThe battle to keep Ethereum sufficiently and properly decentralized is probably one of the most important ones out there in terms of governance and organization,\u201d Brody told Cointelegraph. If any single staking partner were to have 33% of the ecosystem, that \u201ccould potentially \u2014 and I say potentially \u2014 have an impact on transaction finality, although you would get slashed for doing so.\u201d If any single or cooperating group of entities controlled two-thirds of the staking infrastructure, \u201cyou would have the potential to change the governance of the chain\u201d \u2014 something that would be \u201cvery suboptimal,\u201d he said.\n\nBut these dangers remain largely theoretical given how things have evolved since the Merge. \u201cA relatively vibrant staking ecosystem\u201d has emerged, said Brody, with \u201ca few highly centralized custodial players\u201d but also \u201csome semi-centralized custodial players\u201d like Lido, which is a liquid staking pool leader that invests with funds from tens of thousands of individual crypto wallets. There are also prominent staking groups that are \u201ctrying to be more fully decentralized,\u201d like the Rocket Pool, he added.\n\n\u201cAs long as this remains a very competitive ecosystem,\u201d dangers from centralization are unlikely, Brody continued. Moreover, as more enterprise users join the network and become de facto stakeholders, including \u201cFortune 1000\u201d companies, the system \u201cbecomes quite heavily decentralized.\u201d\n\nZwangzer said that centralization was more of a threat in the pre-Merge days when a few proof-of-work pools dominated ETH mining. In any event, he added:\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think this is going to become a problem as long as we can keep the centralized [cryptocurrency] exchanges at bay.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe golden age of digital monopolies\u201d\n\nOne might wonder why decentralized digital networks are even important for commerce and society. Cointelegraph posed this question to EY\u2019s Brody, who believes that public blockchains, especially Ethereum\u2019s, \u201care going to be the big global winners,\u201d with the caveat that public blockchains will first need to be \u201cprivacy-enabled.\u201d\n\nDecentralized blockchain-based networks simply offer the world\u2019s best hope to develop monopoly-resistant global digital marketplaces, he said. \u201cWe live in the golden age of digital monopolies\u201d like Amazon, Google and Facebook, mainly because that is simply the nature of networks. According to Metcalfe\u2019s Law, as a network grows, its value increases exponentially. The first to market has a good chance to dominate.\n\nBut monopolies come at a social and economic cost. New York University finance professor Thomas Philippon has estimated that monopolies cost the median American family $300 a month, and the inefficiencies they entail \u201cdeprives American workers of about $1.25 trillion of labor income.\u201d According to Brody, \u201cIf we want to fully digitize the economy, and we want to do it without digital monopolies, we should be doing it on public decentralized systems.\u201d\n\nIn recent years, EY Global has been devoting significant resources to \u201cindustrializing blockchain privacy technology\u201d through its Starlight project, a zero-knowledge proof compiler that enables secure, private business logic on the public Ethereum blockchain. The project is still in beta, but developers can now experiment with building privacy-enabled features for solidity smart contracts. The goal is to enable blockchain-based business agreements where business logic is shared at the network level, but privacy from potential competitors is still preserved.\n\nThis last point is critical. In the business world, no company wants another firm to know its commercial secrets, after all. A pharmaceutical manufacturer, for instance, may want to track its medicine packets through its supply chain, beginning with the drug\u2019s raw materials, through to distributors and hospitals.\n\nEach packet can be attached to a nonfungible token recorded on a public blockchain. The pharma firm may also want to attach some business agreements as well. For example, a distributor selling one million units of the manufacturer\u2019s drug could trigger an automatic rebate payment to the distributor via a smart contract. But the pharma firm doesn\u2019t want the whole world to know about this rebate agreement.\n\n\u201cWe are starting to build a blockchain-based inventory management system that\u2019s going to use privacy technology to manage those individual tokens,\u201d said Brody. It\u2019s starting on a private chain, but they \u201care building it with privacy technology because they want to go on to the public chain so that anybody can join with them using these standards.\u201d Brody added:\n\n\u201cSo essentially, you\u2019ll be able to take an entire business contract and supply chain operations and run it under privacy on public Ethereum at a cost-effective level.\u201d\n\nTasks like tracking products and attaching business agreements to digital ledgers may seem mundane, but their economic impact could be huge. \u201cSomewhere between 2 and 5% of all the money on earth in corporations is spent administering stuff, keeping track of it, moving it around,\u201d said Brody. \u201cBy using smart contracts and tokenized assets, we could drive that down dramatically.\u201d\n\nFeature: The state of the Bitcoin Lightning Network in 2023\n\nAll of this brings us back to Shapella and why such upgrades matter. A trouble-free launch would be further evidence that Ethereum is still on course to achieve the three key goals laid out in the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s roadmap: scalability, security and sustainability. Or as Blockdaemon\u2019s Zwanzger told Cointelegraph:\n\n\u201cIt also will reinforce the confidence in the network and in the protocol design so that a developer launching a project can be sure that, for example, gas fees and scalability will not be a big problem over the next one or two years.\u201d"
