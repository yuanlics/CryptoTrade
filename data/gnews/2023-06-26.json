        "summary": "  Ethereum (ETH) price is experiencing a minor pullback after reaching its highest level in eight months, but the near-term technical outlook remains positive. The cryptocurrency is finding support at the 21-Day Moving Average and all of its other major moving averages are rising in consecutive order. The Shapella upgrade on April 12th could lead to short-term selling pressure, but most analysts view it as a long-term positive for the network. Some concerns have been raised about a potential \"sell-the-news\" reaction, but the overall outlook for ETH remains strong. The cryptocurrency could potentially hit new highs this year, but investors should always be on the lookout to diversify their holdings. As an alternative investment strategy, some investors might consider getting involved in crypto presales, which can offer high-risk-high-reward investment opportunities."

The trader has 6.64x leverage and entered the position at $1,703.97. The liquidation price is $1,945.18, and the trader may double down on their bet. The analyst speculates that the liquidation price could rise to $2,000 if the trader uses up all of their assets as collateral. Rumors circulate that the liquidation could trigger a breakout of ETH above $2,000. The 1-hour chart shows the price stuck in a range between $1,964 and $1,930, with a potential breakout to the upside or downside. The 1-day chart shows a resistance level at $1,975, which could prevent a follow-through to $2,000."

The changes are expected to be positive for the valuation of Ether in the short term, but the price could drop following the hard fork.

The protocol has seen a 700% increase in daily transactions since the start of the year, with over 1 million transactions per day. This growth has led to an increase in daily active addresses, unique addresses registered on the protocol, and TVL in DeFi protocols. Analysts believe this growth is bullish for Ethereum, as it addresses two of the network's biggest drawbacks: low transaction throughput and high network fees. As layer-2 solutions like Arbitrum can process 40,000 transactions per second, they can compete with more centralized but scalable layer-1 competitors while keeping dApps and projects within Ethereum's \"zone of sovereignty.\" The growth of layer-2 solutions also contributes directly to Ethereum network growth, making the recent surge in Arbitrum's popularity a positive for ETH."

        "summary": "  Ethereum's deflation rate, which measures the rate at which the Ether (ETH) supply is decreasing, has been rising and could continue to accelerate due to increasing network activity. The annualized daily net inflation rate of Ether hit a record low of -2.772% last Tuesday, and as of Sunday, the rate had risen to around -1%. This is driven by higher gas fees, which are burned as a result of Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 1559, removing the tokens from circulation permanently. As the base gas fee rises, the ETH burn rate also rises, which could lead to further deflation. Additionally, the total amount of capital locked within smart contracts on the Ethereum network has been rising, and network activity levels are expected to continue increasing as investors dive back into Decentralized Finance (DeFi) amid improved market sentiment. This could lead to a staggering 5.5% deflation rate if the EIP 1559 burn rate returns to its early 2022 highs."

The DeFi ecosystem, which includes ETH, Chainlink, Uniswap, and SushiSwap, has seen a significant rally in 2020. The recent launch of ETH 2.0, which promises lower fees and faster-responding speed, has attracted institutional investors, leading to increased money flow into ETH. Analysts expect ETH to reach $2,000 in the coming months, with a total open interest of $1.8 billion in ETH options. The ratio of ETH deposits at exchanges has dropped to 22%, indicating increasing hodling sentiment among traders. The upgrade to ETH 2.0 is expected to enhance the network's scalability, programmability, and security, and the final phase is expected to launch in 2021.

Buterin argues that L3s can provide different roles, such as privacy and weakly-trusted scaling, and that L2s can be used for scaling, while L1 is reserved for security. However, he also acknowledges that the concept of L3s is not new and that others are already discussing their utilization.

Rollups are a scaling technique that keeps transaction data on-chain but pushes computation off-chain, while sharding divides the blockchain's nodes into smaller groups to increase the number of transactions processed per second. Buterin argues that rollups are already viable before sharding and can offer a 100x increase in throughput. He suggests that the Ethereum ecosystem should focus on rollups and sharding as a way to achieve scalability in the short-to-medium term. The proposal has gained support from developers and users, with some arguing that it makes more sense to focus on scalability before Phase 2, which is still years away."

The proposal from Mikhail Kalinin would build a version of the Ethereum Mainnet with a PoS mechanism on the Ethereum 2.0 Beacon Chain, which could accelerate deployment.

        "summary": "  One Ethereum Classic (ETC) development team, ETCDEV, has shut down due to lack of funds, but other teams are still working on the project. The ETC community has clarified that the shutdown of ETCDEV does not affect the future of Ethereum Classic. Other teams, such as ETC Cooperative, are still hiring and have open job positions. ETCDEV had planned to focus on scalability improvements, light clients for IoT and mobile, interoperability with other blockchains, and improving cryptography on the EVM. Despite the shutdown of ETCDEV, Ethereum Classic's price has suffered a prolonged sell-off along with the rest of the crypto market."

Despite the competition, Gokal believes that Solana and Ethereum can work together and grow the movement as a whole. The exchange was sparked by a Twitter thread from Chris Burniske, co-founder of Placeholder, who expressed skepticism that everyone in crypto would get along and noted that \"knives are fully out\" in the competition between layer 1 protocols. However, Gokal insists that Solana is not trying to \"kill\" Ethereum and instead aims to grow the movement and expand the user base. At the time of writing, Solana trades at $230, up 11,422% in the past year, while Ethereum trades at $4,747, up 925% in the past year."

Jake explained that while Ethereum has become feature-rich due to \"standards and cool stuff\" built since its launch in 2015, XRP Ledger's design has a variety of features \"natively.\" Jake believes that the combination of XRP Ledger's core design, Hooks functionality, and L2 scaling tools unlocks significant opportunities for flexibility and leverage. However, there are still functions waiting to be implemented into XRP Ledger's technical design. Additionally, XRPL Hooks, a simple smart contract for XRP Ledger, recently passed an audit with no major bugs disclosed, and the discussion is now centered around the next phases of Hooks Amendment implementation in mainnet."

The new collection will feature 20,000 NFTs and will be available for purchase on Tuesday, with a starting price of 2 ETH (approximately $3,750) per NFT. Existing Azuki holders have already been airdropped a token for one of the Elementals, and the art for the collection has not yet been revealed. The Elementals sale will be conducted via a Dutch auction, with the price dropping every 5 minutes until the supply is depleted. The final sale price will be the price that everyone pays, and earlier buyers will be refunded the difference. The collection will consist of four tiers of Elementals, each with a higher chance of revealing rare traits, and will be comprised of randomized attributes of varying rarity. This is the first full follow-up collection to Azuki, which has racked up over $1 billion worth of trading volume and has been quick to capitalize on its success by extending the IP into other realms, including a partnership with Line Friends"

        "summary": "  Demand for ETH staking has surged since the implementation of the Shanghai upgrade, with the waiting period for new validators increasing to 27 days. Despite this, the number of ETH tokens being staked has continued to rise, with a current participation rate of around 18%. The addition of withdrawal flexibility has reduced the risk for investors and could potentially lead to a staking participation rate of 50%. This would result in 38.4 million ETH tokens moving into the less liquid staking contract, causing a scarcity of unstaked ETH and a tailwind for the price. Furthermore, the Ethereum network is experiencing deflation, with the ETH burn rate surging above 8% earlier this month, further supporting the long-term price of ETH."
