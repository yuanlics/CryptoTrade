        "title": "How will Ethereum price react to Bitcoin ETF approval? - Cointelegraph",
        "summary": "  The article discusses the potential impact of a Bitcoin ETF approval on the price of Ethereum (ETH). The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is set to make a decision on a Bitcoin ETF on January 10, and the market is hopeful about approval. If approved, it could set a regulatory precedent for other crypto-based ETFs, including Ethereum. The article highlights that Ethereum is not named as a security in any of the SEC's recent lawsuits targeting crypto exchanges, and the commission has also not challenged Ethereum's classification through the ETF registration process with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).\n\nThe article also notes that Ethereum's price has been correlated with Bitcoin's price in recent years, which could suggest that a Bitcoin ETF approval may trigger a surge in crypto exposure among traditional investors and lead to an increase in ETH price. However, the article also notes that a delay or denial of the Bitcoin ETF approval could result in short-term bearish pressure"
