        "title": "How will Ethereum price react to Bitcoin ETF approval? - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is moving closer to its Bitcoin (BTC) ETF decision deadline on Jan. 10, with the market hopeful about approval. This pivotal event could have wide-ranging implications on the crypto market, including the second-largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum (ETH).\n\nEthereum ETF hopes\n\nApproving a Bitcoin ETF could set a regulatory precedent to ease the path for other crypto-based ETFs. The reasoning is that a Bitcoin ETF approval would likely involve establishing a framework that could be applicable to other cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum.\n\nIn December 2023, the SEC delayed its decision on several pending Ethereum ETF applications in the U.S. to May 2024. This includes the Hashdex Nasdaq Ethereum ETF, the Grayscale Ethereum Futures ETF, the VanEck spot Ethereum ETF, and the spot Ethereum ETF lodged by Cathie Wood\u2019s ARK Invest and 21Shares.\n\nThese delays are part of the SEC's process, which involves gathering public input before deciding whether these ETFs should be listed. Nonetheless, they also appear amid the commission's attempt to categorize some proof-of-stake (PoS) cryptocurrencies as securities.\n\nInterestingly, Ethereum is not named as a security in any of the SEC's recent lawsuits targeting crypto exchanges. The commission has also not challenged Ethereum's classification through the ETF registration process with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).\n\nHere we go \u2026 expect more spot #ethereum ETFs filings in the coming days.\n\n\n\nNOTE: this is an S-1 and not a 19b-4. Which means it does not start a clock in any way \u2026 yet. Expect 19b-4\u2019s soon. https://t.co/sNus2vr5qV \u2014 James Seyffart (@JSeyff) September 6, 2023\n\nThat raises the potential of seeing a spot Ethereum ETF approved in the U.S. by May 2024, a likely boost for ETH prices.\n\nEthereum-Bitcoin correlation\n\nProviding a Bitcoin ETF approval does not become a sell-the-news event, Ether's price is well-positioned for a rally because of its consistent correlation with BTC's price in recent years.\n\nETH/USD and BTC/USD's daily correlation coefficient chart. Source: TradingView\n\nFundamentally, it means a Bitcoin ETF approval may trigger a substantial increase in crypto exposure among traditional investors. In turn, that will likely lead to a surge in ETH price as the market anticipates increased demand.\n\nThe #Ethereum supply crisis on exchanges is worsening day by day.\n\n\n\nEvery day, supply is getting tighter, which indicates even stronger demand for #ETH.\n\n\n\nMassive gains ahead. pic.twitter.com/k0SQJAUDHW \u2014 Leon Waidmann | On-Chain Insights (@LeonWaidmann) January 6, 2024\n\nConversely, a delay or denial may result in short-term bearish pressure as the market adjusts to the setback. A recent Bitwise survey found that only 39% of U.S.-based financial advisers believe a Bitcoin ETF will be approved this year.\n\nEthereum price technicals hint at correction\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, ETH's price is treading near the resistance trendline of its prevailing rising wedge pattern ahead of the Bitcoin ETF decision. A delay or denial could result in the price correction toward the wedge's lower trendline near $1,865 by February.\n\nETH/USD weekly price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe $1,865 level coincides with ETH's 0.236 Fibonacci line and its 50-week exponential moving average (50-week EMA; the red wave).\n\nRelated: Key elements to watch on the Ethereum network roadmap\n\nOn the other hand, an ETF approval may have Ethereum invalidate its rising wedge setup altogether in favor an ascending triangle reversal pattern, as shown below.\n\nETH/USD weekly price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe triangle's upside target is near $3,870 by March, up 75% from current price levels, and coinciding with the 0.786 Fibonacci line.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "title": "Ethereum Giga Whales On A Historic Buying Spree \u2013 Here\u2019s How Much ETH They\u2019ve Bought - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Ethereum whales have been on a buying spree for a while now, which is an indication of their sustained support for the king of altcoins. These whale buys have particularly increased in the past few weeks. On-chain data from Santiment reveals Ethereum\u2019s largest private wallets now hold an all-time high of 56.25 million ETH, representing 46.8% of the crypto\u2019s total circulating supply.\n\nEthereum Whales Accumulate Record Amounts Of ETH\n\nEthereum is currently trading in a range, as price action shows the crypto trading between the higher end of $2,434 and the lower end of $2,127 in the past 30 days. However, the crypto is now showing signs of recovery after a recent price recovery and is now building strong momentum above $2,200.\n\nAmidst the price theatrics, Ethereum whales have been buying more ETH into their wallets to push the total count to new highs upon new highs. At the same time, these whales have been withdrawing from exchanges, causing ETH on exchange-owned addresses to drop to their lowest levels in over five years.\n\nAccording to data from on-chain analytics platform Santiment, a record 65.71 million ETH, representing 54.67% of the total circulating supply is now held by top addresses. Out of this figure, 56.25 million ETH belong to the top 150 self-custodial wallets. Consequently, the top 150 exchange-linked wallets now hold 9.46 million ETH, nearing its lowest level since June 2018.\n\nIncreasing Whale Accumulation: Possible Explanation\n\nThe crypto industry went through a strong price surge in the last quarter of 2023, flipping the optimism around most cryptocurrencies bullish. Continued whale acquisitions can be linked to an anticipated continuation of the price growth in 2024, with the imminent approval of Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs in the US lurking in the background.\n\nETH market cap currently at $268 billion. Chart: TradingView.com\n\nThe accumulation from Ethereum\u2019s largest whales is a good sign for the long-term price, as it signals they believe the price will continue to increase. Their buying power also helps to establish price support by reducing the supply of ETH for sale.\n\nSpotonchain recently showed that an Ethereum whale, identified as \u20180x931\u2019, bought 21,192 ETH worth approximately $48 million at an average price of $2,265. The recent purchase now puts the whale\u2019s total buys at 79,500 ETH since January 2023 and is now sitting on $36.84 million unrealized profit.\n\nAt the same time, liquid staking protocols witnessed steady deposits throughout 2023. Data from DeFiLlama shows that 12.3m ETH ($27.585 billion) are currently locked in ETH liquid staking derivatives. This represents an 80% growth from 6.8 million ETH locked in January 2023.\n\nFeatured image from Pixabay\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Nidhi is a Certified Digital Marketing Executive and Passionate crypto Journalist covering the world of alternative currencies. She shares the latest and trending news on Cryptocurrency and Blockchain.\n\nIn the year 2023, Ethereum (ETH) made notable progress, though it didn\u2019t shine as brightly as some other altcoins like Solana (SOL) and Avalanche (AVAX). While ETH saw an increase of about 90%, SOL surged by nearly 1000%, and AVAX rose by over 200%.\n\nLooking ahead, there\u2019s growing speculation that 2024 could be a pivotal year for Ethereum, possibly pushing its boundaries further.\n\nEthereum Price Analysis\n\nCredible Crypto, a respected figure in cryptocurrency analysis and trading, recently shared ambitious predictions for Ethereum in 2024. Through the digital platform X, he conveyed his belief that ETH could reach a minimum of $10,000 this year. This projection would signify a substantial 343% rise from its current value.\n\nAdditionally, he presented a maximum target of $20,000 for ETH in 2024, indicating a potential growth of 786%. Examining recent trends, Credible Crypto pointed to a price bottom near $2,100 for ETH. He expects a possible rise to $2,160 before targeting a breakthrough above the $2,400 resistance level. This positive perspective aligns with data from the blockchain analytics firm, santiment santiment On-Chain , which suggests an increased accumulation of Ethereum by major holders.\n\nWhat are the Ethereum Whales Up To?\n\nSantiment\u2019s data indicates that the top 150 self-custody wallets now hold a record 56.25 million ETH. In contrast, the amount held in exchange wallets is at its lowest since June 2018, standing at 9.46 million ETH. When combined, these top 150 holders collectively own 65.71 million ETH, marking a new high in their holdings. As of the latest update, Ethereum is valued at $2,255.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum Price Prediction for 2024: Can Vitalik Buterin\u2019s Roadmap Lead ETH to $5000?\n\nFactors Influencing Ethereum\u2019s Potential Growth\n\nEthereum\u2019s potential ascent to $10,000 in 2024 is based on several factors. Firstly, there\u2019s anticipation of a positive market reaction if the SEC approves a spot Bitcoin ETF and Bitcoin undergoes its halving event. Such developments could trigger a market momentum similar to the one observed in 2021. If Bitcoin achieves a new peak, it\u2019s likely that Ethereum will follow a similar path.\n\nAdditionally, the potential approval of an ETH ETF, with interest from significant entities like BlackRock and the SEC\u2019s acknowledgement of Ethereum\u2019s commodity status, may facilitate a more favorable environment for Ethereum, potentially aiding its upward trajectory."

        "content": "ETH was down by more than 1.5% in the last seven days.\n\nIf ETH initiates a bull rally, it might face resistance near $2,300 and $2,400.\n\nThe year 2024 began on a sweet note as Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] value surged above $2,400. However, the king of altcoins witnessed a price correction, pushing its value under $2,300 once again.\n\nWhile this happened, an interesting whale activity occured.\n\nEthereum\u2019s chart turns red\n\nAfter a comfortable beginning in 2024, ETH fell victim to a price correction on the 3rd of January. Because of the price correction, ETH\u2019s value plummeted by more than 1.6% in the last seven days.\n\nAccording to CoinMarketCap, at the time of writing, Ethereum was trading at $2,243.76 with a market capitalization of over $269 billion. Amidst this, Lookonchain recently posted a tweet highlighting an intriguing development.\n\nAs per the tweet, Paradigm deposited 6,500 ETH on Coinbase, which was worth more than $14.6 million. If historical data is to be considered, Paradigm has always bought ETH during bear markets and sold ETH in bull markets to earn profits.\n\nTherefore, since Paradigm dumped ETH, does this mean a larger sell-off is on its way?\n\nAre whales selling Ethereum?\n\nAMBCrypto planned to check Ethereum\u2019s whale activity to see how they were behaving. Notably, Ali, a popular crypto analyst, posted a tweet on the 6th of January, which revealed a promising development.\n\nAs per the tweet, in the past month, Ethereum whales bought over 410,000 ETH, worth nearly $1 billion. This showed that the whales were stockpiling ETH in hopes of a bull rally.\n\nOur analysis of Santiment\u2019s data painted a similar picture. AMBCrypto found that whale activity around the token remained high, as evidenced by the spike in its Whale Transaction Count.\n\nIts supply held by top addresses also increased last week, meaning that whales were accumulating more ETH until press time.\n\nNot only the whales, but the market at large also seemed to have been buying Ethereum. The token\u2019s Supply on Exchanges dropped last week, while its Supply outside of Exchanges increased.\n\nAlso, AMBCrypto\u2019s analysis of CryptoQuant\u2019s data showed that ETH\u2019s net deposit on exchanges was low compared to the last seven-day average, clearly reflecting high buying pressure.\n\nTo top it off, ETH\u2019s Coinbase Premium was in the green, which meant that buying sentiment was dominant among US investors at press time.\n\nIt was interesting to note that on the one hand, buying pressure on ETH was increasing, while on the other hand, the blockchain\u2019s network activity declined.\n\nAMBCrypto had earlier reported that BNB Chain [BNB] has surpassed Ethereum in terms of user activity over the past month. As per the data, only 1.28 million active addresses transacted on Ethereum, witnessing a 13% drop in user activity.\n\nWill high buying pressure initiate a bull rally?\n\nWhile buying pressure increased and prices sank, ETH\u2019s derivatives market metrics somewhat turned bullish. For example, ETH\u2019s Open Interest dropped along with its price. Such instances indicate an increased chance of a trend reversal.\n\nIts BitMEX Funding Rate also declined last week, and market sentiment around the token remained bearish, as shown by the dip in Ethereum\u2019s Weighted Sentiment.\n\nIf we consider that ETH will soon begin a bull rally, it would still have quite a few barriers to overcome to skyrocket its price. To find that, AMBCrypto took a closer look at ETH\u2019s liquidation heatmap.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nOur analysis found that if a bull run is bound to happen, ETH would face a strong resistance level near the $2,300 mark. And if it goes above that level, then ETH\u2019s would face its next barrier at $2,400.\n\nThe last time ETH\u2019s price touched those levels, its liquidation spiked sharply."

This represented a 50% growth in month-over-month (MoM) fees paid by its users to use its network.\n\nFrom these fees, the chain saw a revenue of $2 million from these fees.\n\nDue to its lower user activity, Ethereum\u2019s fees and revenue climbed by just 10% in the last month, according to data from Token Terminal\n\nBNB on a weekly chart\n\nAt the time of writing, BNB traded at $305.80, logging a 31% price rally in the last month, per data from CoinMarketCap.\n\nThe coin\u2019s price assessed within a wider time frame (weekly) showed that despite the 3% price correction recorded in the last week, accumulation persisted.\n\nThe coin\u2019s Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Money Flow Index (MFI) rested above their center lines, suggesting that buying activity exceeded distribution. As of this writing, RSI was 67.22, while the Money Flow Index (MFI) was 71.69.\n\nRead Binance Coin\u2019s [BNB] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nShowing that the bulls were in control of the market, BNB\u2019s positive directional index (green) rested significantly above its negative directional index (red). This also confirmed the strength of the buying trend in the market.\n\nThe coin\u2019s 50-day simple moving average (blue), above its 200-day simple moving average (yellow), lent credence to the position above. When these averages are so positioned, it is generally considered an indication of an upward trend."

        "content": "What Is NEO?\n\nNEO is a blockchain developed to fully digitize assets and identities through smart contracts, which will facilitate the emerging smart economy. In the theory behind a smart economy, digital assets and digital identities are seen as being essential to improving the quality of life for everyone.\n\n\n\nNEO aims to automate digital asset management through smart contracts, with the eventual goal of building a distributed, network-based, smart economy system using decentralized applications.\n\nKey Takeaways NEO is a blockchain ecosystem designed to be used to build a smart economy.\n\nNEO has two native tokens. NEO is used to establish ownership and management roles in the blockchain, and NEO Gas is used to pay for transactions on the blockchain.\n\nNEO defines a smart economy as one that uses smart contracts to manage and secure digital identities and assets.\n\nUnderstanding NEO\n\nNEO was founded as AntShares by Da Hongfei and Erik Zhang in 2014. It was rebranded to NEO in June 2017. It is a blockchain-based platform that supports two native tokens, NEO and NEO Gas. The NEO project's blockchain is designed to digitize identities and assets and use smart contracts to track and transfer ownership\u2014a smart economy.\n\nNEO originally described its smart economy system as:\n\nDigital Assets + Digital Identity + Smart Contract = Smart Economy.\n\nDigital Assets\n\nDigital assets are not only digital property but are also physical assets tokenized by transferring their value to the blockchain and having it issue a token for each asset. Tokenization creates a decentralized, trustworthy, traceable, and transparent manner for asset management, free of intermediaries and their associated costs.\n\nUsers can record, buy, sell, exchange, or circulate various assets. NEO developers believe this digitization supports asset protection because they are registered on its platform, giving them a validated digital identity.\n\nDigital Identity\n\nDigital identity enables verifiable key information about participating individuals, organizations, and other entities that exist in the digital context. The developers believe that securing individual information through blockchain, consensus mechanisms, and encryption methods is essential as life becomes more and more digital.\n\nNEO and NEO Gas are not minable cryptocurrencies. There will only be 100 million NEO\u201450 million of which went to fund-raising supporters, and the remaining 50 million are for developers, cross investments, and contingencies. NEO Gas is awarded for blockchain work and transaction fees. However, you can purchase NEO on exchanges.\n\nNEO uses the Public Key Infrastructure standard (X.509) as a guide for managing identities by creating encrypted private and public keys used to verify identities. Digital identities can be verified using facial recognition, fingerprints, voice, SMS, and multi-factor identification methods.\n\nSmart Contracts\n\nSmart contracts are code that automatically execute transactions and agreements between different parties. Smart contracts remove the requirement for third-party involvement because transfers are automatically completed. They also allow traceability, transparency, and transaction irreversibility.\n\nHow Is Neo Different From Bitcoin and Ethereum?\n\nNEO maintains a clear distinction from other standard blockchain platforms in its focus on being regulatory-compliant and a development platform for decentralized applications. It also uses a different consensus mechanism than Bitcoin and Ethereum, called delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance (dBFT).\n\nDelegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance\n\nRather than use a system like proof-of-work where random numbers are generated in a competitive bid to open a new block on the blockchain, Delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance (dBZT) designates nodes in consensus rounds using a \"staking\" method similar to proof-of-stake to achieve a majority agreement of more than two-thirds.\n\nTo address the issue of non-reliable validators (the Byzantine General Problem), consensus nodes with NEO Gas staked are randomly chosen for consensus rounds to validate transactions and open new blocks.\n\nThe NEO dBFT is reportedly capable of achieving 1,000 transactions per second (TPS), compared to Bitcoin's much slower three to seven TPS.\n\nEthereum\n\nWhile digitized assets and smart contracts are popular on the Ethereum blockchain, the third key feature of what it calls \u201cdigital identity\u201d separates NEO from the rest. Every participant operating on the NEO platform must have a unique digital identity that can be verified\u2014which means that you must enter information unique to you to receive a public key, somewhat reducing the anonymity provided by other blockchains.\n\nEthereum is designed to be scaled for any application a person can think of, be it new currencies, non-fungible tokens, decentralized apps, or something as of yet uninvented. NEO claims to be focused on facilitating a smart economy.\n\nBitcoin\n\nBitcoin was created to be a decentralized digital currency and uses proof-of-work in its consensus mechanism. It has one cryptocurrency that is used as a reward for mining\u2014the process of validating transactions and opening new blocks on the chain. The NEO network is less dependent on processing power for validation, so transaction costs and times are much lower.\n\n\n\nIs NEO a Good Crypto? Whether NEO is a good crypto depends on your risk tolerance, cryptocurrency outlook, and what you intend to use it for. It might increase in value, or it might not. NEO is designed to track and transfer asset ownership but also has a market value.\n\nHow Many NEO Coins Are Left? There were 50 million coins issued to project backers, and 15 million are held for contingencies. In addition, there are 20 million being used to incentivize developers and 15 million for cross-investing in other projects. No other coins will be issued, but NEO is available on some exchanges.\n\nWhat Is NEO in Crypto? NEO is a cryptocurrency used to incentivize the development of the NEO smart economy blockchain.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nNEO is a blockchain designed to create a smart economy by digitizing assets and identities and introducing interoperability\u2014the ability for different blockchains to communicate with each other.\n\n\n\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s price is currently finding it difficult to rally higher following weeks of aggressively bullish price action. Yet, there are still several support levels nearby that could keep the cryptocurrency from dropping lower.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nBy TradingRage\n\nThe Daily Chart\n\nOn the daily timeframe, the price has been on the rise since breaking above the 200-day moving average and the large descending channel. While ETH is still trading above the key $2,000 level, it is going through a consolidation phase below the $2,400 level, failing to climb higher.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index is also hovering around the 50% level, pointing to an equilibrium in momentum. As a result, the short-term price action heavily depends on whether the cryptocurrency drops below the $2,000 level or successfully breaks above the $2,400 level to target the $2,700 resistance zone.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart\n\nLooking at the 4-hour chart, it is evident that the price has been oscillating between the $2,100 and $2,400 levels over the last month. Following the recent rapid drop toward the former area, ETH has rebounded and is consolidating in the middle of the range.\n\nTherefore, while the market structure is still relatively bullish, things could go either way, depending on the direction of the potential breakout from the mentioned range.\n\nSentiment Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nEthereum Open Interest\n\nEthereum has undergone a significant uptrend in recent months, surging from below $1K to over $2.4K. Currently, the price is exhibiting uncertainty about its future trajectory, prompting a closer look at futures market sentiment for valuable insights.\n\nThe provided chart illustrates the open interest metric across all exchanges, counting the number of open futures contracts regardless of trade direction. Higher values indicate confidence among futures traders regarding the trend, while lower values suggest uncertainty. Additionally, increased open interest correlates with heightened price volatility, raising the likelihood of liquidation cascades.\n\nWhile the price has been on an upward trend, open interest has consistently risen, indicating a bullish market sentiment. However, a recent phase of sideways consolidation has coincided with a notable decline in open interest. This suggests that many long positions have been flushed out, indicating a healthy futures market, potentially paving the way for a renewed impulsive trend. The direction of the upcoming trend, however, remains uncertain until the funding rate metric experiences a notable move, either above or below one."

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) is on track to chart a new recovery path with an ongoing mega accumulation by the whales within its community. According to top market analyst Ali Martinez, Ethereum Whales have accumulated over 410,000 ETH units over the past month.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Whales: Catalysts for Growth\n\nThe total Ethereum (ETH) whale accumulation is valued at $920,745,200, a sum significant enough to shift the price of the cryptocurrency by some fraction of a percentage. According to the shared charts, the valuation boost of whales ranging from 1000 to 10,000,000 Ethereum units is at its highest level since at least 24 November 2023.\n\nadvertisement\n\nFrom that time until now, the coin\u2019s price has been erratic, rising to a high above $2,400 sometime on December 9 before experiencing a bearish correction as we have it today. At the time of writing, Ethereum is changing hands for $2,251.76, up 0.81% in the past 24 hours.\n\nEthereum\u2019s growth has been mixed with many uncertainties as it has exhibited a stronger-than-expected correlation with Bitcoin in recent times. Rebounding to its current level from a 24-hour low of $2,219.78, Ethereum\u2019s short-term growth trend has trailed that of Bitcoin but the revived interest from its whales can change the narrative moving forward.\n\nOther crucial on-chain metrics include the Daily Active Addresses which, according to the crypto analytics platform, IntoTheBlock (ITB) is up by 2.21% to 480,990. The ITB data also confirmed the Ethereum (ETH) whales transaction which has seen a 15.83% jump in the past 24 hours with over $4.79 billion traded.\n\nEthereum Getting Interesting Updates\n\nWhile the Ethereum (ETH) whales outlook shows interesting trends ahead owing to the shrinking supply by these accumulations, Ethereum is also getting a series of other fundamentals that can ultimately help bolster the network moving forward.\n\nAs reported earlier, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has hinted at one of the latest focuses that the Layer-2 scaling solutions resident on the blockchain should focus on. This focus should be hinged on developing Ethereum Name Service (ENS) for these L2s in the hope of bolstering further adoption and ease of use.\n\nAdditionally, Ethereum is also anticipating a spot ETF product that might see the light of day if spot Bitcoin ETF is approved as currently widely speculated."

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBitcoin (BTC) whales are slowly taking profits amid the upcoming ETF approval. Solana (SOL) and Ethereum (ETH) also saw some respectable profit taking on the market. However, all the assets show stable performance. Meanwhile, Pushd (PUSHD) has entered the new stage of its presale launch.\n\nSolana (SOL) and Ethereum (ETH) Enter New Market Stage\n\nSolana (SOL) and Ethereum (ETH) have long been perceived as competitors as both blockchains build out their respective robust smart contract platforms with a variety of decentralized applications. Solana (SOL), for instance, has risen in value by 1,100% from January to December 2023, while Ethereum (ETH) is up by approximately 80% within the same time frame.\n\nThe start of 2024 has seen Solana (SOL) and Ethereum (ETH) undergo a period of price adjustment, with SOL and ETH experiencing a 17% and 3% decrease in their trading value over the last two weeks, respectively. This trend reflects a strategic move by Solana investors to capitalize on their investments, while Ethereum maintains a steady, though unhurried, progression at the beginning of the year. Notably, prominent crypto influencer Raoul Pal holds an optimistic view on the future trajectory of these cryptocurrencies. He suggests that both Solana and Ethereum have the potential to revisit their peak prices within the year, particularly if a bull market is stimulated by the anticipated Bitcoin halving in April. This event, often a significant milestone in the crypto market, could potentially herald a period of robust growth for these leading digital assets.\n\nIs a Bitcoin (BTC) ETF Approval Imminent?\n\nBitcoin (BTC) holders are most definitely bullish in 2024, especially as speculations of an imminent approval from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission intensify. Notably, Bitcoin (BTC) rallied throughout 2023 off the back of the speculation, with the token recording a 160% increase in price from January to December 2023. The Securities and Exchange Commission recently ordered prospective Bitcoin ETF aspirants to make certain changes to their filings ahead of a crucial week which hint at an approval in the making.\n\nPushd (PUSHD) Enteres Presale\n\nThe Pushd (PUSHD) new stage presale is live. Pushd is building the world\u2019s first viable decentralized alternative to Web2 ecommerce platforms. The Pushd marketplace features low platform fees, minimal listing charges and KYC processes, and a user experience tailored for both crypto natives and newbies. PUSHD presale investors are incentivized by revenue sharing on the Pushd marketplace, giving them a bigger income the more PUSHD tokens they hold.\n\nAccording to developers, PUSHD is on pace to sell out stage 2 of its presale token allocation. With over 8,000 registrants and counting, PUSHD is quickly gaining its market share.\n\nFind out more about the Pushd presale at their official website."

        "content": "Major cryptocurrencies dipped on Sunday evening, fueled by market anxiety over how Bitcoin would react to the potential approval or denial of the United States\u2019 inaugural spot BTC exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nCryptocurrency Gains +/- Price (Recorded 9:30 p.m. EST) Bitcoin BTC/USD -0.63% $43,804 Ethereum ETH/USD -1.69% $2,207 Dogecoin DOGE/USD -3.36% $0.078\n\nWhat Happened: According to senior Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, most applicants are expected to receive approval within the week, provided they have met the regulator\u2019s requirements before Dec. 29.\n\nOn Jan. 5, key players in the Bitcoin Spot ETF race, such as BlackRock, Grayscale, 21Shares, and others, submitted 19b-4 amendments in response to the SEC\u2019s request. The 19b-4 filing represents one of the last stages in the SEC\u2019s approval process. This step could potentially pave the way for the first-time approval of the funds in the U.S. this week, as Reuters reported, citing sources.\n\nBalchunas notes that the final S-1 documents from the asset managers are due at 8 am on Monday.\n\nTop Gainer (24 Hour)\n\nCryptocurrency Gains +/- Price (Recorded 9:30 p.m. EDT) Siacoin SC/USD +21.04% $0.009752 Bitget Token BGB/USD +0.69% $0.61 Stacks STX/USD +0.64% $1.62\n\nThe global crypto market cap has reached $1.66 trillion, marking a 4.80% decrease in the last 24 hours.\n\nU.S. stock futures showed little change Sunday night following a down week for the major averages in 2024. Traders are anticipating inflation data and big bank earnings in the week ahead. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures dropped by 35 points, or 0.1%. Meanwhile, S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures saw increases of 0.14% and 0.21%, respectively.\n\nCongressional leaders announced a deal on Sunday, agreeing on a $1.59 trillion top-line spending to prevent a potential government shutdown.\n\nThese developments come after the year-end rally, during which a dovish pivot from the Federal Reserve raised concerns among investors about equities being overbought. Additionally, a strong December jobs report and Fed meeting minutes indicating uncertainty about the future of rate cuts added to these worries.\n\nThe December consumer price index is scheduled for release on Thursday, and the producer price index is due on Friday. These reports will provide insight into whether the Fed\u2019s efforts to bring inflation down to its 2% target are succeeding.\n\nSee More: Best Cryptocurrency Scanners\n\nAnalyst Notes: Cryptocurrency analyst Michael Van de Poppe predicts a significant impact on the crypto markets due to the Bitcoin ETF. \"Approx. $30-60 billion in liquidity flowing into the markets, through which Bitcoin will face a bull cycle comparable to the http://Dot.com bubble or Gold in 2004-2011.\"\n\nAnalyst PlanB predicts a 10x price surge for Bitcoin (BTC), citing multiple bullish indicators.\n\n\"Bitcoin's growth used to be 100x in the first couple of bull markets, but lately that has slowed down a little bit to 10x, a little bit under 10x. I don't expect diminishing returns because we're at 2 or 3% adoption, and if we follow the logistic S-curve and Metcalfe's law, we can't have diminishing returns below 50% adoption, so we'll have exponential growth for a couple more years. I expect a nice 10x that brings it to somewhere in the $100,000 to $1 million range.\"\n\nAs we near ETF week, brace for significant volatility in the Bitcoin market, with alternative cryptocurrencies being influenced by its movements. This prediction comes from CrediBull Crypto, another pseudonymous analyst.\n\n\"For ETH- something like this seems most plausible and should coincide with the local breakdown on ETH/BTC mentioned in my post below. It would make sense for BTC to break local highs following ETF approval while alts led by ETH lag a bit and then ultimately follow BTC up.\"\n\nData from Santiment, a blockchain analytics firm, has indicated, \u201cBitcoin is mildly declining as the weekend kicks off, and there may be some volatility ahead with whale transactions hitting their highest level since June 12, 2022. When whale activity spikes, prices often foreshadow a breaking cycle.\u201d\n\nRead Next: Jim Cramer Advises Against Using Binance, Provokes Strong Reactions From Twitter Users\n\nPhoto via Shutterstock"

This feat is unprecedented, seeing Ethereum still dominates the ecosystem in different aspects.\n\nWith Polygon outpacing Solana, signs are there that layer-2 solutions are attaining maturity, a trend that has spurred Vitalik Buterin to call for the development of customized Name Service for these protocols to enhance their adoption and usability.\n\nThis current milestone is part of a unique growth trend in Polygon which as reported earlier also extends to growing daily active users."

The annual low is estimated to be around $1.70, with a potential high of up to $5.18. The outlook for Osmosis (OSMO) is quite positive, indicating a strong upward trend and substantial momentum over the next year.\n\nWith its strategic alliance with Umee, Osmosis (OSMO) is poised for potential further advancement. Yet, to keep its edge post-merger, Osmosis (OSMO) must navigate the choppy waters of market volatility with steady progress. To prosper, Osmosis (OSMO) needs to integrate effectively within the expansive Cosmos network and resonate with its user community. For Osmosis (OSMO) to succeed in the competitive DeFi landscape, it must seamlessly assimilate into the Cosmos ecosystem and captivate its user base.\n\nSpotlight on Emerging Cryptocurrencies: Render (RNDR), Optimism (OP), Sui (SUI), Arbitrum (ARB)\n\nAs the cryptocurrency landscape continues to evolve, it's crucial to look beyond the giants and consider emerging tokens like Render (RNDR), Optimism (OP), Sui (SUI), and Arbitrum (ARB).

        "title": "How To Bridge And Trade On The Injective (INJ) Network - TradingView",
        "content": "Injective is a blockchain designed specifically for finance. It is an interoperable and environmentally-friendly layer 1 blockchain that supports advanced DeFi applications, including crypto trading dApps, like spot and derivative exchanges, and lending protocols.\n\nThat being said, in the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency, the Injective Network has emerged as a trailblazing force, revolutionizing the landscape with its innovative approach to scalability and seamless trading experiences. In my opinion, I will say that Injective is trying to follow the Solana path in terms of progressive growth in the ecosystem and price value.\n\nIn this in-depth guide, we\u2019ll navigate through the essential features of the Injective (INJ) Network, unravel the intricacies of initiating your trading journey, and explore various methods to acquire and trade the coveted Injective Coin (INJ).\n\nSolving Scalability: The Essence of Injective (INJ) Network\n\nThe scalability challenge has long been a hurdle for widespread crypto adoption, and Injective Network steps up to the task as a groundbreaking solution. Scalability is the reason some people don\u2019t trade certain coins. For instance, I avoid making certain Ethereum transactions because of the high gas fees. If I want to make any monetary transaction, I prefer to use a more scalable coin like injective (INJ).\n\nScalability isn\u2019t just about transaction costs but also about the speed of transactions. Injective Network boasts a remarkable transaction speed of 0.8 seconds, leaving competitors, including Ethereum and its layer 2 counterparts, in the rearview mirror. What more can you ask for with their gas fees as low as $0.01, Injective Network brings unparalleled efficiency to the world of blockchain transactions.\n\nInjective (INJ) gives you a better DeFi experience, this is because you are not scared of exploring the DeFi space due to high gas fees and slow annoying transaction speed. If you have transacted on the Ethereum chain or done any past DeFi activity on the Ethereum chain, you will be conscious of your exploration because each activity will incur a transaction fee whether the contract signed is successful or not and it\u2019s not cheap.\n\nInitiating Your Injective Trading Journey\n\nEmbarking on your trading journey within the Injective Network involves meticulous steps to ensure a seamless experience. The choice of a compatible wallet is paramount, and here, we delve deeper into two main types:\n\nEVM Based Wallets:\n\nEVM compatibility is the bedrock for smooth integration with Injective Network. While Metamask is a popular choice, it\u2019s essential to understand its intricacies, especially when it comes to the EVM chain. Exploring alternative EVM-based wallets can provide tailored solutions for optimal user experience.\n\nIt is preferable to use an EVM wallet like Metamask if you are bridging from an EVM chain to an injective chain. As we go further into this post, you will learn how to bridge from EVM to the injective chain. EVM wallet like metamask makes your Defi experience on the injective easier but you can\u2019t compare it to that of the cosmos-based wallet.\n\nCosmos Based Wallet:\n\nFor a user-friendly experience on your PC, consider Cosmos-based wallets like Leap and Keplr. These Chrome extensions are tailor-made for Injective Networks, ensuring not just compatibility but also enhanced security features. Using a Cosmos-based wallet makes interaction far easier than EVM-based wallets. But you can\u2019t have EVM-based assets on this wallet, this means that you can\u2019t bridge EVM assets to injective using this wallet, you need to use Metamask.\n\nThese wallets, the EVM-based wallets, and the Cosmos-based Based Wallets are great for your smooth Defi experience when interacting on the injective chain. Acquiring Injective Coin (INJ)\n\nOnce your wallet is set up, the next crucial step is acquiring the prized Injective Coin. INJ is prominently listed on various centralized exchanges, including Binance, Coinbase, Kucoin, Bybit, OKX, and Gate.io. Each exchange offers its unique advantages, and strategic users may explore multiple platforms for optimal trading conditions.\n\nConsider securing your INJ in a Keplr wallet for efficient portfolio management. When you are sending INJ from centralized crypto exchanges to your Keplr wallet, make sure you choose the Injective network and paste your Injective network address from your Keplr wallet.\n\nSetting Up Keplr Wallet for Injective Chain Visibility\n\nCreating a Keplr wallet is a straightforward process through the Chrome extension. Get your Keplr wallet, and create a new wallet, you will be given a seed phrase, save the seed phrase, usually a 12 or 24-word seed phrase. Do not forget to save them, in order not to lose your account permanently.\n\nTo make the Injective chain visible in your Keplr wallet, follow these steps:\n\nClick on the hamburger sign in the top left corner.\n\nNavigate to \u201cManage Chain Visibility.\u201d\n\nThis will take you to where you can view the chain visibility on the Keplr wallet, this is essential as it helps you select other chains on the Keplr wallet.\n\nSearch for \u201cInjective\u201d or \u201cInj\u201d and click on \u201cAdd Token.\u201d\n\nBy enhancing Injective-related keywords in your wallet setup process, you not only optimize for search engines but also ensure clarity for users seeking to manage their INJ effectively.\n\nIt is important to know that every address on the injective chain starts with the \u201cinj\u201d prefix, this helps you identify the injective chain easily. Congratulations you are about to begin your Injective DeFi journey.\n\nDefi means Decentralised Finance, this is a type of transaction that doesn\u2019t require a centralized platform like Binance, Bybit, OKX, or whatever centralized exchange you know. All you need to perform a DeFi transaction is a DEX (Decentralised Exchange) wallets like Keplr and a Dapp (Decentralised Application).\n\nWe have a wallet now, we need to fund it with INJ before interacting with a Dapp on the Injective wallet. You can get INJ tokens from an exchange like Binance Binance. You can deposit on your Binance in whatever way you are used to depositing on your Binance, you can deposit USDT with fiat. Trade the USDT for INJ. The next step is to withdraw the INJ to your Keplr wallet. Withdraw the INJ on the Injective wallet. Withdrawing INJ coin and Bridging Tokens:\n\nThe withdrawal process after acquiring INJ involves selecting the coin, choosing the Injective chain, and pasting your Keplr Injective address. Remember the address has to start with \u201cINJ\u201d. This step is crucial for securing your assets, and benefits from additional details regarding security measures, transaction confirmation times, and potential challenges users might encounter. This is just one method to get INJ from a centralized exchange, you can also get INJ by bridging.\n\nBridging, an alternative method for bringing tokens to Injective, is an essential strategy, especially for users keen on optimizing their portfolio across multiple chains. Bridging from an EVM-based wallet requires a metamask and INJ on an EVM chain. For instance, if you have INJ on the ETH chain in your metamask, all you need to do is connect your metamask to the Injective Bridge platform. This will help you bridge from the ETH chain to the injective chain.\n\nBridging Tokens in the Cosmos-Based Wallet Ecosystem:\n\nAn intriguing method to diversify your portfolio involves bridging tokens from the Cosmos-based wallet ecosystem to Injective. For example, bridging TIA (Celestia) to Injective and swapping TIA (Injective) to INJ (Injective) using Astroport opens up opportunities within the Cosmos ecosystem.\n\nYou will have to go to the Injective Bridge platform, connect to your cosmos-based wallet, select whatever cosmos-based wallet token you have like TIA (Celestia), and bridge from the Celestia chain to the injective chain. Emphasizing this integration showcases the versatility of Injective Network and its compatibility with other blockchain ecosystems. Now you have TIA(Injective) you need to swap it to INJ, trading or swapping can be done Astroport.\n\nTrading INJ on Astroport\n\nAstroport, the decentralized exchange (DEX) on the Injective chain, serves as the epicenter for token swaps. After successfully bridging tokens, users can initiate trades on Astroport, leveraging the platform\u2019s decentralized nature for portfolio diversification. Whatever you are swapping here is expected to be on the injective chain, you can swap INJ for all the available tokens, and now you can trade as easily as you like. How To Trade on Coinhall\n\nCoinhall is a site where you can bridge directly and swap. It is a multi-token bridge swap DEX that you can use to bridge and swap at the same time but only for Cosmos-based tokens and coins. It serves as a smart chart for all cosmos-based tokens including injective and also for swapping and bridging.\n\nYou can see all the available coins and tokens with their respective prices here, it\u2019s a good DEX dApp to use. You can scroll here and search for the token you are looking for. You can also search by using the search bar.\n\nIf you want to trade a token and you can find it on the list, all you have to do is go to Coinhall and type the name of the token, as well as search using a contract address.\n\nCoingecko is also a good site that has the details of coins. Here, you can search for the name of the coin or token you are looking for, and get the contract address directly.\n\nGo to the info section and search for the contract, copy the smart contract from Coingecko, and paste it into the coinhall market search button.\n\nLike this:\n\nThis will take you to where you will be able to trade any token based on the dex.\n\nLet\u2019s explore Coinhall as A Bridge Swap DEX\n\nTo explore Coinhall this way, you need to navigate to the Swap section. This section will give you the opportunity to bridge and swap at the same time. For instance, if you want to swap TIA (Celestia) to INJ (Injective) you can do this at ease with one click.\n\nInstead of bridging TIA (Celestia) to TIA (Injective) then swapping it to INJ. You can do it as shown below:\n\nConclusion\n\nWith your INJ Coin securely stored in your wallet, you\u2019re now poised to explore the exciting world of trading on the Injective Network. The scalability, low transaction fees, and swift processing times position the blockchain as a promising platform for crypto enthusiasts and traders alike. In the dynamic realm of decentralized finance (DeFi), Injective Network stands tall, offering innovative solutions for seamless and efficient trading experiences.\n\nAs you navigate this multifaceted landscape, remember that the Injective Network isn\u2019t just a platform; it\u2019s a gateway to transformative technology shaping the future of cryptocurrency. These steps, when taken with a strategic mindset, offer not only trading opportunities but also a deeper understanding of the evolving crypto ecosystem.\n\nStay informed, trade wisely, and harness the full potential of the Injective Network, where every transaction is an opportunity to redefine your crypto journey.\n\nIn summary, this comprehensive guide provides an extensive roadmap for mastering the Injective Network, ensuring that users, from beginners to seasoned traders, can navigate the intricacies of this innovative blockchain ecosystem with confidence and clarity."

        "title": "Ethereum's liquid staking protocols experience remarkable growth, surpassing $27 billion in value - Cryptopolitan",
        "content": "The landscape of liquid staking protocols in the Ethereum ecosystem has experienced significant growth over the past six months, indicating a robust upward trend in both the volume and value of Ether (ETH) deposits.\n\nEthereum\u2019s dominance in liquid staking\n\nAs of January 6, 2024, Ethereum-based liquid staking protocols have locked in 12.31 million ETH, a substantial increase from the 10.16 million recorded on July 5, 2023. This rise translates to an impressive value growth from $19.69 billion to $27.49 billion. Lido Finance, a leading player in this domain, has also seen a dramatic rise in Ethereum holdings, amassing 1.7 million ETH since July 2023, holding over 75% of the total deposited Ethereum.\n\nLiquid staking protocols are revolutionizing how investors interact with Ethereum, allowing them to stake their ETH while retaining liquidity. This is achieved through derivative tokens like Lido\u2019s STETH or Rocket Pool\u2019s RETH, representing the staked capital and accrued rewards. These tokens can be used across various decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms.\n\nKey players and market dynamics\n\nThe past six months have witnessed notable shifts in the liquid staking space. Lido\u2019s Ethereum reserves have increased by 21.16%, accounting for a staggering 9.26 million ETH. On the other hand, Rocket Pool\u2019s holdings have grown from 810,502 ETH to 1.09 million. Binance\u2018s liquid staking protocol has exponentially increased, with its Ethereum holdings skyrocketing by 981%, from 72,077 ETH to 779,785 ETH.\n\nThis period also observed shifts in market positions among various protocols. Coinbase\u2019s staking service, previously the second-largest, has now fallen to the fifth position. New entrants like Mantle and Swell have risen in the ranks, holding 174,532 and 142,725 ETH, respectively. Stakewise has seen a modest increase in its Ethereum holdings, from 91,910 to 97,199 ETH.\n\nFuture outlook\n\nThe addition of 2.15 million ETH, valued at $4.83 billion, across the top 27 liquid staking protocols signifies a strong and growing interest in Ethereum-based liquid staking. This trend highlights the increasing trust and participation in Ethereum\u2019s staking mechanisms, which is a crucial aspect of the network\u2019s security and functionality.\n\nEthereum\u2019s leading position in the liquid staking market is a testament to its robust ecosystem and the confidence it commands among investors. As Ethereum continues to evolve and expand its capabilities, the liquid staking sector is likely to witness further growth and diversification, playing a vital role in the broader DeFi landscape.\n\nThe momentum behind Ethereum and its liquid staking protocols shows no signs of abating, pointing to a vibrant and dynamic future for Ethereum\u2019s staking ecosystem. As investors continue to seek avenues for passive income generation within the cryptocurrency space, Ethereum\u2019s liquid staking protocols stand out as a compelling and increasingly popular option."

        "title": "Ethereum whales acquire over 410,000 $ETH valued at nearly $1 billion in the past month - Cryptopolitan",
        "content": "Cryptocurrency investors and enthusiasts have been closely monitoring Ethereum\u2018s recent market movements as large investors, often referred to as \u201cwhales,\u201d have acquired a significant amount of Ethereum (ETH) in the past month.\n\nWith over 410,000 ETH worth nearly $1 billion in total, this development has sparked interest and speculation within the crypto community.\n\nEthereum whales are on the move\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, Ethereum whales, individuals or entities holding substantial amounts of the cryptocurrency, have been active in accumulating more ETH over the past month.\n\nThe data suggests that these whales have collectively acquired over 410,000 ETH, which currently translates to nearly $1 billion in market value.\n\nMarket impact and implications\n\nThis substantial influx of capital into Ethereum has not gone unnoticed in the cryptocurrency market. Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has experienced increased demand and rising prices as a result of these whale purchases.\n\nWhile some might view this as a positive sign of confidence in Ethereum\u2019s future, it has also raised questions and concerns regarding potential market manipulation.\n\nThe recent acquisition of Ethereum by Whales has led to a debate within the crypto community about the motives behind these purchases. Some argue that whales are accumulating ETH as a long-term investment, anticipating future price appreciation.\n\nOthers speculate that these large purchases could be part of a broader strategy, potentially aimed at influencing the market.\n\nMarket dynamics and whales\u2019 influence\n\nEthereum\u2019s decentralized nature has always been one of its defining features. However, the concentration of a significant portion of ETH in the hands of a few whales raises questions about the extent of their influence over the market.\n\nLarge-scale transactions by whales can trigger volatility and affect price movements, leading to concerns about market stability and fairness.\n\nThe accumulation of substantial amounts of cryptocurrency by whales has caught the attention of regulators worldwide. Governments and financial authorities are increasingly focusing on the cryptocurrency space, aiming to establish regulations that ensure fair and transparent market practices. The actions of Ethereum whales may contribute to the urgency of these regulatory efforts.\n\nThe recent activity of Ethereum whales has led to divided opinions within the cryptocurrency community. Some investors view these large purchases as a positive sign of confidence in Ethereum\u2019s technology and its potential to disrupt traditional finance. Others remain cautious, emphasizing the need for transparency and equitable market practices.\n\nMarket reaction and price trends\n\nEthereum\u2019s price has experienced fluctuations in response to the significant whale activity. While the overall trend has been upward, the market has witnessed periods of heightened volatility. This dynamic underscores the potential impact that large-scale transactions by whales can have on Ethereum\u2019s price trajectory.\n\nThe debate surrounding Ethereum whales and their influence on the cryptocurrency market is likely to continue. As the cryptocurrency ecosystem evolves and matures, it is essential to address concerns related to market manipulation, transparency, and investor protection.\n\nThis ongoing discussion highlights the need for a robust regulatory framework to ensure the long-term sustainability and integrity of the cryptocurrency market."

        "title": "New ICO Token's +950000% ROI Potential Makes BONK, ETH, & Shiba Inu Traders Invest Fast & Big - Blockchain Reporter",
        "content": "Bonk Inu (BONK), Ethereum (ETH), Shiba Inu (SHIB), Tether (USDT), Ripple (XRP), Polygon (MATIC), and Dogecoin (DOGE) cryptocurrency traders appear to all agree on one thing currently; Mollars initial Coin offering has a +10,000% ROI prediction that\u2019s worth learning about.\n\nMentioned as the New Bitcoin by crypto media giant CryptoPotato and the top ICO for 2024, according to ICOHolder.com\u2019s hot list, Mollars is the future for Ethereum-blockchain users. It\u2019s a solution that can\u2019t be ignored by the intelligence of millions of crypto wallets on the ERC-20 network. No longer will crypto traders lose money in horrendous fees to buy Bitcoin as Mollars will make it so Ethereum-Blockchain users can have a store-of-value token with low minting numbers on-chain.\n\nMollars is an Intelligent Solution For Ethereum Users\n\nWhile to the novice, saving money on $BTC cross-chain swapping may not seem much. However, Bitcoin has seen fees in 4th quarter 2023 that were the worst in 2 years. Last November, the average Bitcoin trader lost nearly $39 per $BTC transaction. The founding coin\u2019s fees have gotten so bad, they now exceed all other blockchains according to a report from DailyCoin.\n\nApparently this issue was analyzed long before it was reported. And Ethereum crypto guru plotted the creation of the \u201cMollars Saves Dollar\u201d movement and $MOLLARS token concept to rid Ethereum-blockchain users of the hassle of cross-chain swaps for the $BTC and loss of major money to fees. That movement & concept materialized into the launch of the Mollars.com initial coin offering, which offers the $MOLLARS token in the presale stage to foster infrastructure and stability for the New Bitcoin for Ethereum users.\n\nTether (USDT), Ethereum (ETH), & Bonk Inu (BONK) Traders Buying The Most Mollars ICO Tokens\n\nTraders who buy now via Mollars.com private exchange, get the new ERC-20 token at the discounted rate of US$0.30. This is half the price of what it will cost on it\u2019s first public crypto exchange, US$0.62.\n\nThe ROI yields of just over +100% are appetizing to any investor. As word spreads through the crypto newsphere, Investors are coming from all cryptocurrency groups. However, the most notable investments are coming from Ethereum (ETH), Bonk Inu (BONK), Ripple (XRP), Polygon (MATIC), Ripple (XRP), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Tether (USDT) cryptocurrency holders. Tether holders most notably perhaps, have seen a spike of over +900% in sales in the last 7 days. That group is followed by Ethereum & Bonk Inu traders who have risen by nearly +600% each.\n\nInvestor buys are likely to keep rising as predictions are released by different blog analysts and independent sources. Mollars tokens will be limited to 10,000,000 [million] tokens total supply for eternity. This stat is particularly appetizing to crypto investors because that is half of the supply of Bitcoin [21-million], a crypto coin that\u2019s yielded over +20,000,000% returns on investments to ICO investors of 2011. With the $MOLLARS token offering an intelligent solution to a well-noted issue for $BTC investors on the Ethereum-blockchain, it\u2019s almost certain thousands will fancy the \u2018New Bitcoin\u2019 over the old.\n\nWildcard Prediction Suggests ROI Yields Of +950,000% Long-Term\n\nLong term, if $MOLLARS were to follow the trajectory of $Bitcoin, a simple & long-shot analysis would suggest the token could return nearly +950,000% ROI.\n\nThis wildcard prediction comes from the formula of Bitcoin having a +20,000,000% ROI yield on 21-million tokens. That yield is 1-million percent less than the total tokens, over 13 years. This means that in the same time frame, 10-million Mollars tokens could have a +9,500,000% yield \u2014 simply reverse engineering the logistics of the $BTC yields and applying it to Mollars.\n\nIt may sound crazy, but Bitcoin was crazy to most in 2011. At US$0.30 cents, it\u2019s much better to lose $3 on 10 coins than miss the next Bitcoin for certain.\n\nOther key statistics about the Mollars token revolve around its decentralization. The ERC-20 token will have no owner. Also, the full minted supply will be sold on exchange and no one will be gifted tokens from the supply ever. The $MOLLARS token anyone holds, including founder or developers, will have to be purchased in the ICO or once on public exchange, fair trade to all.\n\nThe total fundraising goal of the Mollars initial coin offering is US$2,000,000 according to the official Whitepapers. If that hard cap is reached, half of funds will go towards the token\u2019s CEX liquidity pool. The other half will go towards a token culture catalyzing web3 product\u2019s development, marketing, brand value and equity building, and other long-term infrastructure needs that will be pre-set and run in autonomy before and after CEX listing.\n\nOnce the $2-Million-dollar hardcap is met, the Mollars ICO will end or on the deadline of May 2024. Analysts across various websites predict this token presale will likely end early based on current buyer growth however.\n\nOnly 4-million tokens will be sold at the discounted rate during the $MOLLARS initial coin offering. That is 40% of the total token supply being minted [ever] of the store-of-value token. If sold-out, it leaves only 6-million tokens for the public crypto trading exchanges to sell. A sell-out of the 4-million presale tokens during the 6 months of this ICO makes it highly plausible that the remaining 6-million tokens could be sold out during the 7 months to remain in 2024 after the ICO\u2019s official deadline.\n\nIf sold-out in 2024, any prediction above from crypto analysts about $MOLLARS token could materialize, including the yields of +950,000% ROI. In layman\u2019s terms, that\u2019s a 950x on initial coin offering investments.\n\nBiggest Investors Thus Far In Mollars ICO\n\nNearly 100,000 $Mollars tokens have already been purchased via Mollars.cc. The daily buy averages are increasing weekly.\n\nThe top buyers of the ICO to date, according to the Initial Coin Offering\u2019s Tether (USDT) & Ethereum (ETH) transaction addresses, both purchased over US$2,000 of the mollars token.\n\nOn Friday, one Ethereum trader invested 1.15 $ETH into $MOLLARS. This one transaction amounts to US$2,575 or ~8584 Mollars tokens. If the investor holds long term and the \u2018New Bitcoin\u2019 leaps to 950x the current value, their 1.15 Ethereum tokens would yield a staggering $2.44-million-dollar return on investment.\n\nOn Wednesday, January 3rd, a Tether (USDT) trader decided to start their New Year\u2019s holiday by making a potential life changing investment of over US$2,000 as well. This is the second biggest investment spotted on the Mollars transaction list. This 2nd place trader invested $2,050 worth of $USDT in a total of 3 transactions \u2014 $1000, $1000, and $50. Their investment of 2,050 USDT will net a profit of a whopping $1.94-Million-dollars if the investors hold long term and the wildcard prediction is found to be true.\n\nCrypto Shrimps & Dolphins but Smart Investors\n\nRegardless, both trades will have the chance to double their investments in a few months once this ICO launches on a public crypto exchange by May of 2024. Also, for both traders to have thousands of dollars to invest, which is more than many people have in their bank account to their name in 2024, they must have some sort of financial intelligence to have obtained such amounts for investment.\n\nSee the latest in trader discussion about Mollars on the official subreddit community, r/MollarsToken. This is open to the public and a great way to get unmoderated thoughts from real cryptocurrency investments.\n\nGet the latest sales stats on this dollar-saving Bitcoin-alternative\u2019s token pre-sale or purchase token via Mollars.cc."
