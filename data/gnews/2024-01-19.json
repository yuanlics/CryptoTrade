This increased competition may be adding pressure on the SEC to make a decision.\n4. Uncertainty around SEC's stance: The article quotes Morgan Creek Capital co-founder and CEO Mark Yusko as saying that the SEC is still hostile toward crypto, despite approving Bitcoin ETFs. This uncertainty may be contributing to the delay in approval of Fidelity's Ether ETF.",
        "How": "  The article focuses on the \"How\" aspect of the news, providing information on the SEC's decision-making process and the factors that could influence its decision. Here are some key points:\n\n1. Delay: The SEC has delayed its decision on Fidelity's Ether ETF bid by 45 days, citing the need for additional time to consider the proposed rule change and the issues raised.\n2. Filings: Five new Bitcoin ETFs have been filed with the SEC by Direxion, joining the three previously filed by ProShares and REX Shares. These filings show plans for 1x, 1.5x, and 2x long leveraged Bitcoin funds, as well as one of each for short leveraged funds.\n3. Leveraged ETFs: The filing of multiple leveraged Bitcoin ETFs could lead to a situation where leveraged ETFs outnumber long-only ETFs, which is a rare occurrence.\n4. Approval odds: Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas has pinned a 70% chance of approval by May for spot Ether ETFs based on the SEC's final deadline for VanEck's fund. However, Morgan Creek Capital co-founder and CEO Mark Yusko believes the SEC is still hostile toward crypto and may classify ETH as a security, unlike Bitcoin, which SEC Chair Gary Gensler previously considered a commodity.\n5. Factors influencing decision: The SEC's decision on Fidelity's Ether ETF bid and other pending spot Ether ETF bids will be influenced by various factors, including the SEC's regulatory framework, market conditions, and the potential impact of these ETFs on investor protection and market stability.",

        "When": "  Sure! Here's a summary of the news in the aspect of \"When\":\n\n* Over the past two months, founder Sreeram Kannan has revealed a change that may minimize collateral damage (mentioned in the article)\n* EigenLayer has not given a timeline for introducing attributable security (mentioned in the article)\n* Node operators and an EigenLabs-built AVS are expected to launch in the first half of 2024 (mentioned in the article)\n* Third-party AVSs are expected to follow (mentioned in the article)",
        "Where": "  The article discusses the EigenLayer security model, which is a new approach to securing the Ethereum blockchain. The model relies on a pooled security model, where multiple protocols share the same pool of capital to access security. This model is being introduced to make it cheaper and easier to launch new protocols on the Ethereum blockchain. The article mentions that EigenLayer is based in Istanbul, where the founder, Sreeram Kannan, detailed the change in a conference presentation. The article also mentions that EigenLayer has attracted over $1.7 billion in user deposits and that the protocol is expected to launch in the first half of 2024.",
        "Why": "  The article discusses why EigenLayer, a protocol that relies on a pooled security model to make it cheaper to launch certain protocols on Ethereum, may introduce attributable security as a solution to address concerns over collateral damage. The reason for this is to give AVSs (active validated services) the option to purchase insurance-like coverage to limit collateral damage in the event of an attack or failure. This feature is intended to address sceptics' fears that the pooled security model could introduce unproductive incentives and potentially destabilise the Ethereum ecosystem. By offering attributable security, EigenLayer aims to make the ecosystem safer while also incentivising AVSs to take on more risk with security that is being subsidised by other people.",

The company is introducing a new feature called attributable security, which allows AVSs to purchase insurance-like coverage to limit their exposure in the event of a failure. This feature will give AVSs the option to purchase attributable security, which will allow them to enjoy the benefits of pooled security while limiting collateral damage to node operators, restakers, and other AVSs.

The author presents a balanced view of the new security model proposed by EigenLayer, highlighting both its potential benefits and drawbacks. While some experts, such as Chunda McCain, express concerns about the potential risks of the pooled security model, others, like Meir Bank, see it as a positive development that could make the Ethereum ecosystem safer. The article also notes that EigenLayer is taking a cautious approach to introducing attributable security, suggesting that the company is prioritizing caution over speed.
