        "summary": "  Ethereum gas fees have dropped to $1.13, the lowest since November 2022, which some analysts believe could be a sign that Ether (ETH) is bottoming out. On-chain data suggests that ETH might be forming a bottom similar to the one in late 2022. However, there are no direct indications that this scenario could be repeated. In the past week, ETH rose 1.26% and is currently trading at $1,637, but its trading volume has dropped by 12.2% to $4.6 billion. Additionally, there have been massive ETH outflows from centralized exchanges, with 110,000 ETH (worth approximately $181 million) moved off exchanges on Wednesday, the largest outflow day since Aug. 21, 2023."

Initial trading volume of ETH futures ETFs accounted for only 0.2% of what Bitcoin futures ETFs amassed in 2021. Lunde believes institutional appetite for ETH is lacking, and the crypto market lacks meaningful short-term price catalysts, making Bitcoin the favored asset. Laidler charts a similar path ahead for crypto assets, citing potential downward triggers from macro trends such as the Fed and oil prices."

        "summary": "  Ethereum fees have dropped to their lowest level in a year, according to Santiment, a cryptocurrency sector analytics platform. This could be a sign of a potential price rebound for the second-largest digital asset by market capitalization. Average Ethereum network fees are currently $1.13, the lowest since November 2022. Lower fees generally lead to an increase in utility and price rebound, as seen in the past. Ethereum is currently trading at $1,640.50, with a 0.35% decline in the last 24 hours but still holding onto a 1.3% gain across the previous week and a 0.58% increase in the past month. Technical analysis gauges on TradingView are strongly bearish, with moving averages and oscillators indicating a'strong sell' at 13. CoinCodex's AI price prediction algorithms have set the price of Ethereum at $2,623.13 by the end of 2023."

In comparison, Bitcoin futures ETFs registered $1 billion in trading volume within the first 24 hours after launch. The low trading volume shows that Ethereum futures ETFs have yet to gain major mainstream interest.

The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is considering Ether futures exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Analysts expect a bullish Q4 2023 for Ethereum and other altcoins, with a possible explosive rally. Exchange outflows of 110k ETH were recorded on Wednesday, the largest since August 21. Non-exchange Ethereum reached an all-time high, while exchange supply is at a five-year low. Ethereum is searching for higher support, with the 21-day EMA serving as immediate support at $1,641. The RSI is upholding the downward trend, with traders interested in shorting Ether monitoring the RSI. Bullish traders are considering a retest of the previous resistance as bullish. A break above resistance at $1,750 would confirm the uptrend and encourage traders to consider longing ETH for a larger breakout to $2,"

The transfer comes at a time when Ethereum is under pressure, with prices down 4% in the past three days. The Data Nerd notes that the transfer of coins to exchanges is often associated with sell-offs, which could put further pressure on prices.
