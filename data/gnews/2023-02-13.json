        "content": "Former Goldman Sachs executive Raoul Pal says that Ethereum is destined to reach a five-figure price in the next crypto bull market, and that some of ETH\u2019s biggest rivals will outperform.\n\nIn a new interview teaser with Altcoin Daily, Pal says that Ethereum will probably present the best risk-adjusted returns moving forward, but that plenty of other competing altcoin projects could still post higher gains.\n\n\u201cETH is the money of the internet. And I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to lose that. But, that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s the best performer. Because we\u2019re going to push use cases elsewhere for innovation.\n\nWe\u2019ve got things like Sui coming. Aptos hasn\u2019t been fully utilized yet. We need to see the network effects. Solana, I think they\u2019re aiming for the broadest adoption by making it a consumer-friendly place, to onboard normies. That\u2019s very powerful. If they get that right\u2026 and their work with people like Meta and stuff like that \u2013 Instagram \u2013 is very interesting. That\u2019s super amazing.\n\nPolygon, amazing group, what are they doing? They\u2019re onboarding a lot of people. They\u2019ve got a lot of throughput, super interesting.\n\nSui hasn\u2019t even come on to the market yet, and that is faster, incredible team, stuff like that, so there\u2019s a lot going on here. But ETH is the easiest way because it\u2019s probably got the least risk.\u201d\n\nThe macro expert says that he has a rough price target of about $10,000 for ETH, though he\u2019s not a fan of price predictions.\n\n\u201cI hate doing it but, I don\u2019t see any reason why it\u2019s not above $10,000. I see no reason at all why it\u2019s not above $10,000 so that\u2019s a decent upside from here.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, ETH is trading for $1,525.\n\nO\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Guy Turner from Coin Bureau is keeping a close eye on Ethereum (ETH) and one other altcoin, predicting that the crypto assets have much more to rise.\n\nIn a new interview on the CryptoBusy podcast, Turner says that he believes Ethereum will eventually usurp Bitcoin (BTC) and become the leading crypto by market cap.\n\nHowever, Turner notes that such an event wouldn\u2019t be as significant as most people believe.\n\n\u201cI guess the important thing about whether the flippening happens or not is that it isn\u2019t a big deal. I think a lot of maxis on either side of the fence tend to get worked up about it and stuff.\n\nThey have different roles. They\u2019re doing different things, so [if] ETH flips BTC or doesn\u2019t, it\u2019s not really a big deal as far as I\u2019m concerned.\n\nI personally think it will probably happen given the just continued growth of Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem and how many people I think in the future will be using it. And it will be one of those things you\u2019ll be using without really realizing it.\u201d\n\nTurner says he only envisions Ethereum growing due to its versatility and constant upgrades.\n\n\u201cI can only see Ethereum growing. I mean, it\u2019s got so much market share at the moment. It is constantly evolving, constantly finding new things, and we\u2019ve already got this whole layer-2 ecosystem system built on top of it already. I really do feel that Ethereum is going to be the base layer, the base chain.\u201d\n\nThe crypto analyst is also closely watching interoperable blockchain ecosystem Cosmos (ATOM), saying that the digital asset has yet to fulfill its potential.\n\n\u201cI still think ATOM has a long way to go\u2026 ATOM, in the last bull market, as I remember, I don\u2019t think it fulfilled its potential yet by any means.\u201d\n\nEthereum is trading for $1,524 at time of writing while ATOM is worth $13.48.\n\nI\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.
