        "content": "Advertisement\n\nJoe Lubin, Ethereum Co-Founder and the CEO of ConsenSys is not worried about ether (ETH) being classed as a security in the United States after the crypto\u2019s transition to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus model.\n\nSpeaking during a June 28 interview with CNBC, Lubin noted that a regulatory decision on ether has already been made. \u201cThe CFTC has spoken very crisply a number of times that they consider Ether like a commodity,\u201d he stated.\n\nNotably, the Commodity Futures and Trading Commission (CFTC) boss Rostin Benham has previously said that the top three cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum, and Tether\u2019s USDT, belong under his agency\u2019s purview as commodities.\n\nBenham\u2019s opinion, however, directly contradicts that of Securities and Exchange Commission boss Gary Gensler, who has on multiple occasions indicated that \u201ceverything other than Bitcoin\u201d fits the definition of securities. Earlier this month, Gensler\u2019s hammer struck twice as the SEC filed landmark lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase for purportedly offering cryptocurrencies that the regulator deems to be unregistered securities.\n\nThe commission\u2019s chairman has also hinted that ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, fell under this umbrella after the network\u2019s monumental shift to a proof of stake consensus mechanism.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Gensler wasn\u2019t always so trenchant a detractor. Before becoming the chair of SEC, he taught courses on digital currency at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and consulted with that school\u2019s Digital Currency Initiative. During this time, he believed ether had graduated from being a security into a commodity by 2018.\n\n\u201cThe SEC has spoken,\u201d Lubin opined, referencing former SEC director William Hinman\u2019s 2018 speech Ethereum speech where he declared the asset a non-security. Recently unmasked documents revealed that Hinman dismissed warnings from other SEC staffers who believed his comments would cause immense market confusion.\n\nNotably, Gensler refused to say whether ether was a security during a five-hour-long hearing in April. \u201cIt\u2019s really a forgone conclusion at this point,\u201d Lubin observed. \u201cThere may be a regulator or two in the United States that can\u2019t bring himself to utter the fact that Ether is not a security, but I don\u2019t know why that\u2019s the case.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, industry figures and billionaires like Mark Cuban are calling out the SEC for failing to provide crypto firms with a clear registration process to comply with."

The financial and market information provided on U.Today is intended for informational purposes only. U.Today is not liable for any financial losses incurred while trading cryptocurrencies.

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nEthereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, experienced a sharp price drop recently, moving from $1,940 to $1,847. While various factors play into the volatility of cryptocurrency prices, the substantial sell-off by a particular \"whale\" is believed to have significantly contributed to Ethereum's decline in this instance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA \"whale\" in the crypto universe refers to an individual or entity that holds a large amount of a particular cryptocurrency. When such a player makes substantial trades, it often triggers notable price movements. In this case, an Ethereum whale strategically deposited 25,000 ETH (valued at approximately $47.24 million) to Binance, the popular crypto exchange platform, and withdrew 15.9 million USDT 12 hours later.\n\nThe smart whale who deposited 25K $ETH ($47.24M) to #Binance yesterday withdrew 16M $USDT again 9 hrs ago.\n\n\n\nThe drop in $ETH price 11 hrs ago was most likely due to the sell-off of this whale.\n\n\n\nAnd the whale may have ~8K $ETH ($14.7M) left unsold.https://t.co/EucQrT7C4w pic.twitter.com/Aogfv9vOdO \u2014 Lookonchain (@lookonchain) June 29, 2023\n\nRenowned for buying low and selling high, this crypto whale has maintained a perfect win rate for Ethereum trading over the past couple of months. This successful strategy, while profitable for the whale, has recently resulted in downward pressure on ETH's price.\n\nJust nine hours after the initial transaction, the whale proceeded to withdraw another 16 million USDT, further contributing to Ethereum's downward spiral. Analysts believe the sudden drop in Ethereum's price was largely attributed to this whale's substantial sell-off.\n\nWith approximately 8,000 ETH (roughly $14.7 million) yet to be sold, this influential whale's future trading activities could potentially exert additional selling pressure on Ethereum's market value. However, it is also crucial to note that crypto markets can be affected by a myriad of factors, including global economic trends, regulatory news and changes in investor sentiment.\n\nThis recent event underscores the amount of power and influence whales have on the cryptocurrency market. Retail investors should always stay cautious and track large wallets to avoid unexpected sell-offs like this one."
