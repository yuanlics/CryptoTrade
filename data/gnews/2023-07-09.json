        "title": "Bitcoin Ordinals About to Flip Ethereum NFTs - U.Today",
        "content": "Bitcoin's native non-fungible tokens (NFTs), known as \"Ordinals,\" are on the verge of surpassing Ethereum in the NFT market, according to data from Crypto Slam.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOrdinals have seen a significant surge in both sales and active buyers, achieving an impressive 129.50% growth in USD sales and attracting close to 10% of the buyer market.\n\nEthereum still currently leads the NFT sector with a sales total of over $24 million, however, the rapid rise of Bitcoin's Ordinals suggests that a \"flip\" could be imminent.\n\nOrdinals, which have been rapidly gaining traction since their inception in April 2023, are unique digital assets inscribed on a satoshi, the smallest unit of Bitcoin.\n\nTheir creation was facilitated by the Taproot upgrade, launched on the Bitcoin network in November 2021, which made it possible to inscribe data on the Bitcoin network in a way that's similar to creating NFTs on other blockchain platforms. Since their launch, Ordinals have been creating a stir in the Bitcoin community, setting record numbers of inscriptions on multiple occasions.\n\nApart from Bitcoin's Ordinals and Ethereum's NFTs, several other blockchains have also made significant strides in the NFT market. Solana holds the third spot, showing robust sales growth of 44.61% with total sales of $1.2 million and attracting 31.40% of buyers, a number that surpasses even Ethereum's buyer market share.\n\nPolygon follows closely behind in the fourth position, with a sales increase of 30.75% amounting to $1.3 million. The BNB Chain comes fifth, with sales totaling $856,027 and a buyer share of 7.54%. Lastly, Cardano, despite having a sales growth of 36.22% and total sales of $346,115"

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\n\u201cI think if we want Bitcoin to be more than payments, it needs more scaling solutions,\u201d said Vitalik Buterin, on a Twitter Spaces this week, pointing to several experiments that Ethereum has been trying out over the past years.\n\nBut the main problem, for him, is politics.\n\n\u201cBitcoin has really weird politics,\u201d he said, adding that he \u201cdoesn\u2019t vibe with them.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOver 32,000 people tuned in to listen as the Ethereum inventor talked with \"altcoin slayer\" Eric Wall and Bitcoin developer Udi Wertheimer about what Bitcoiners can learn from Ethereum.\n\nThe trio tackled one of the main pain points of the world's biggest cryptocurrency by market cap: Bitcoin's slow transaction throughput, and thus the need for layer two scaling approaches to increase the speed at which people can send and receive the digital asset.\n\nThe majority of the discussion revolved around scaling, which is where Buterin, Wall, and Wertheimer think Bitcoiners could learn the most from the presumed rival chain.\n\n\u201cI think if we want Bitcoin to be more than just payments, it will need scaling options like Plasma or ZK Rollups,\u201d said Buterin, both of which have been tried on Ethereum. Optimism and Arbitrum are two successful examples of \u201crollups\u201d that could serve as case studies for Bitcoin, he said, adding that it would \u201cbe good to have an open mind\u201d with regards to ZK-snark based solutions\u2014indicating a clear preference.\n\nEthereum has been experimenting with a wide variety of scaling solutions over the years, and is in the process of its latest update, EIP-4844, which introduces blob blocks\u2013enabling up to 100,000 transactions per second.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWall pushed the idea that Bitcoin should be studying these trials, fearing that the ecosystem will be left with less secure rollups. Buterin responded that the proposal will likely draw \u201ccontroversy with security hawks.\u201d\n\nWall, who has been taking center stage as of late with the Taproot Wizards, brought up Bitcoin\u2019s security model, and the 21 million hard cap. It\u2019s a question that Buterin said he has grappled with, although he pointed to Ordinals as providing a reasonable fee market to cover the reducing block subsidies as well as subsequent security concerns.\n\nButerin also thinks Ordinals have brought a \u201creturn to builder culture\u201d which in his words \u201cis very good.\u201d He added that he \u201cdefinitely see signs of hope now that we have Ordinals,\u201d calling them a \u201creal pushback to laser eyed maximalism.\u201d\n\nButerin also tried to find ten things that both ecosystems shared. He pointed to claims of immutability by both chains, along with the fact they both have issues with layer-1 privacy. Buterin also mentioned that both Ethereum and Bitcoin have showcased how difficult it is to do things in decentralized consensus models.\n\nThe Ethereum co-founder ended on a rather optimistic note, trying possibly to bring together both communities.\n\n\u201cI think a world where there is at least one of these chains is better than one with none,\u201d he concluded."

        "title": "Ethereum Node Locations Raise Concerns About US Government Involvement | Bitcoinist.com - Bitcoinist",
        "content": "Ethereum is currently the largest proof of stake (P0S) network after transitioning from a proof of work (PoW) mechanism late last year. This means that the network now uses validators to carry out transactions as opposed to miners using energy-intensive computers to solve complex mathematical problems to do the same thing \u2013 something that has been applauded as a step in the right direction by many in the space.\n\nHowever, the location of Ethereum nodes worldwide, particularly their concentration in a particular location, has raised concerns among participants after a Twitter user pointed out a disturbing fact.\n\nMore Than 50% Of Ethereum Nodes Are In The United States\n\nOn Sunday, a Twitter user that goes by Hamzah Khan made a post revealing that over 50% of Ethereum\u2019s nodes are being hosted in datacenters in the United States.\n\nThere are currently about 5,500 nodes running Ethereum, and about half are based in the US. Of these, over half are in a single data center in Virginia, 20 minutes away from the white house and the CIA headquarters. FUD Morning \ud83d\ude4f \u2014 Hamzah Khan (@_khanhamzah) July 9, 2023\n\nMore interestingly though was that of this massive share of the node distribution being hosted in the country, more than 50% were being hosted in a single datacenter.\n\nThe location of this particular datacenter was of the most interest. The datacenter which is located in the state of Virginia is reportedly only 20 minutes away from the headquarters of the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), as well as the White House.\n\nNow, while the location has been pointed out, it shows no participation of the US government in the running of Ethereum. Rather, as the Ether.fi website points out, it shows that Ethereum is not as decentralized as participants would like.\n\nETH price falls below $1,900 support | Source: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nAdditionally, Mike Silagadze, CEO of Ether.fi, also responded to the tweet to clarify that the number of nodes on its website needed to be updated. Compared to the 5,500 on the website, Silagadze said there were now around 6,800 Ethereum nodes running. But as another Twitter user pointed out, it doesn\u2019t change the \u2018distribution\u2019 of the nodes already pointed out above.\n\nThe Rise Of Liquid Staking\n\nBecoming a validator on Ethereum carries a high barrier to entry because valuators are required to have a total of 32 ETH. At current prices, this translates to around $60,000 to run a single validator node. And since a large percentage of users cannot afford this, liquid staking protocols have seen a lot of success for the services they offer.\n\nLiquid staking protocols such as Lido Finance and Rocket Pool allow investors to still become validators even if they don\u2019t have up to 32 ETH. Users are able to pool their ETH together to make a validator. This way, they are able to earn rewards without operating a full node themselves.\n\nLido leads ETH liquid staking | Source: DeFiLlama\n\nOver the last year, protocols such as Lido Finance have seen sharp growth, propelling them to the forefront of ETH staking. Currently, there is over $14 billion staked on the Lido liquid staking protocol, accounting for around 30% of the total staked ETH. In total, liquid staking now accounts for more than 37% of the total staked ETH, and rising.\n\nThis growth was born out of the need for more decentralization in the Ethereum network as nodes become more spread out. However, despite the rise in liquid staking, Ethereum nodes are still highly concentrated, mainly in the United States."
