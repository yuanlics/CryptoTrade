        "content": "Arbitrum (CRYPTO: ARB) is among the leading large-cap cryptocurrencies in the market this week. As of 1:45 p.m. ET, Arbitrum has surged 27.2% since last Friday's close and is one of the only top cryptos to have reached a fresh all-time high this past week.\n\nFor mega-cap cryptos, it's been a rather ho-hum week. Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) and Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH), for example, ended the week up 3.7% and down 3.4%, respectively. Hence, the outsize interest in names like Arbitrum.\n\nHere's what investors are watching closely when it comes to this Layer-2 Ethereum scaling solution right now.\n\nArbitrum passes Ethereum in decentralized exchange volume\n\nThe big headline that drove an incredible amount of interest in Arbitrum relative to other top cryptos over the past week is a surge in decentralized exchange (DEX) trading volume on the Arbitrum network. Earlier today, Arbitrum pushed past Ethereum to process a 24-hour trading volume of $1.83 billion, making this the leading platform in terms of daily DEX volume.\n\nArbitrum's surge in trading volume was very noticeable, with overall volume increasing more than 32% over the past week. Ethereum's corresponding volume dropped nearly 5% over the same period. Arbitrum's infrastructure, which includes using optimistic rollups to improve speed, scalability, and cost on its network, appears to be striking a chord with traders. In the highly competitive market for DEX market share, Arbitrum is not so quietly rising in the ranks.\n\nTo make things better, Arbitrum also announced record-high total value locked (TVL) metrics this week. The project's overall TVL surged past the $2.5 billion mark for the first time, surpassing Layer-1 network Solana (CRYPTO: SOL) in the process.\n\nAdditionally, Orbit (a Layer-3 project providing developers with the ability to build applications on Arbitrum) announced this week that ARC-20 tokens can now be used for transaction fees. This added benefit for Orbit's individual blockchains and corresponding decentralized applications appears to be spurring overall ecosystem growth for Arbitrum.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat now?\n\nArbitrum appears to be firing on all cylinders. The network's lower-cost, higher-throughput ecosystem is clearly one developers are looking to build upon and users are flocking to. So long as these fundamental metrics continue to improve, this project could certainly continue to see momentum well into 2024.\n\nNow, some of Arbitrum's transaction volume surge can be attributed to a meme token-driven frenzy in recent months. Most conservative investors wouldn't bet the farm on that continuing, and at some point, I think the fuel this catalyst is providing will run out.\n\nThat said, Arbitrum's infrastructure and value as a scaling solution are being validated in a big way by the market. For those betting on growth within the Ethereum ecosystem (with the majority of the spoils in terms of volume going to scaling solutions like Arbitrum), this is a crypto to keep your eye on.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in ARB right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in ARB, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and ARB wasn't one of them.

        "content": "BONK Meme Coin Leads Solana: Is NuggetRush The Next Crypto Gem In Ethereum?\n\nCrypto has been on a tear since October 2023. With Bitcoin prices rallying, other altcoins have also benefited. Among them, Solana (SOL) has gone up more than 10X, rising from as low as $10 to above $110. As SOL prices boomed, the Solana ecosystem blossomed as enterprising developers launched meme coins. Though launched in Q4 2022, when critics deemed Solana dead, the Bonk coin meme led the altcoin surge in 2023, outperforming even the world's most capitalized meme coin, Dogecoin (DOGE).\n\nAmid this upswing, traders and investors have been exploring Ethereum, looking for potential projects that could replicate BONK and SOL in 2024. Among the few, interest is on NuggetRush (NUGX), a project whose presale is ongoing, raising over $1.5 million from the crypto community.\n\nWhat Is BONK, And Why Is It Rallying?\n\nLike Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin, BONK is a meme coin. However, one big difference is that the token was distributed to affected Solana and Solana ecosystem token holders when prices plunged in late 2022 following the collapse of FTX.\n\nBONK was meant for relief holders, but due to its large community and SOL revival in 2023, the meme coin bounced strongly to be one of the top-performing assets in 2023.\n\nTo illustrate, BONK soared by over 270X in 2023, lifting the token from obscurity to commanding a market cap of over $700 million as of early January 2024.\n\nHowever, because of the team's mission of eventually integrating BONK across multiple chains, incorporating it in decentralized finance (DeFi) and gaming, the meme coin could find utility, rising as Solana recovers after the dump in 2022.\n\nDue to its rising popularity, BONK is available for trading on some of the world's mainstream exchanges, including Binance and Coinbase.\n\nEven so, after the rally in 2023, the upside momentum is fading as prices retrace. When writing, BONK is down 60% from early December 2023 peaks.\n\nAccordingly, some investors are considering alternatives, with NuggetRush emerging as an option.\n\nNuggetRush: The Next Big Thing in Ethereum?\n\nNuggetRush is deploying on Ethereum--a Solana competitor--and aims to add utility to meme coins, including BONK.\n\nThe platform plans to launch a play-to-earn (P2E) where the goal is for players to have fun and, at the same time, benefit NUGX holders.\n\nNUGX complies with the ERC-20 standard on Ethereum. Besides serving as a utility, meaning it will be used as an ecosystem currency, holders can also participate in governance. This is part of the project's plan to ensure the project is decentralized.\n\nAlready, the team has declared plans to eventually renounce its audited smart contracts to the community. Afterward, NUGX holders will directly determine how the project is developed. SolidProof has audited all NuggetRush code as a preventive measure against hacks.\n\nNuggetRush will reward players with in-game NFTs, tradable on the platform's marketplace. NUGX is a medium of exchange. As such, NFT holders can swap them for NUGX or other NFTs. At the same time, NFTs can be staked for up to 20% APY, payable in NUGX.\n\nWith its strong community, unique tokenomics, and potential for utility, NuggetRush has the potential to be the next big thing in the Ethereum ecosystem. Some even argue it can track and possibly outperform BONK in the months ahead, especially if 2024 is bullish.\n\nIn the NuggetRush presale in progress, NUGX is available for 0.015 USDT in stage 4. Over $1.5 million has been raised.\n\nEventually, NUGX will launch at $0.02 once the presale ends.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs the crypto market warms up, new opportunities are emerging. The community is exploring these opportunities, and some analysts suggest that NUGX may follow in BONK's footsteps, bringing the meme coin scene on Ethereum back into the limelight.\n\nVisit NuggetRush Presale Website\n\nThis post was authored by an external contributor and does not represent Benzinga's opinions and has not been edited for content.
