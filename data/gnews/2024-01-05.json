They are built on top of Ethereum and help speed up transaction processing while keeping costs down for the parent chain.\n\nThere are different types of Ethereum Layer 2 blockchains, including sidechains and blockchain rollups. Sidechains are independent blockchains with native tokens and consensus mechanisms that help scale the parent network, while blockchain rollups \"rollup\" or bundle transactions and send them to Ethereum as a single piece of data.\n\nPopular Ethereum Layer 2 solutions include Polygon, Arbitrum, Base, ImmutableX, and Ronin. These solutions prioritize different use cases and audiences, but all aim to improve Ethereum's scalability and make it more accessible for users.\n\nBy using Ethereum Layer 2 solutions, users can enjoy faster and cheaper transactions, play Web3 games, exchange tokens, mint NFTs, and trade ETH without the"

The article highlights several reasons why Ethereum's dominance may be at risk, including:\n\n1. Lackluster strategic roadmap: Ethereum's new roadmap for 2024 has been criticized for being too focused on resolving design problems from The Merge, rather than introducing new and exciting developments.\n2. Scaling back grand goals: Ethereum's initial goal of achieving 1 million transactions per second has been scaled back to 100,000, which may not be achievable in its current stage of development. Meanwhile, rival blockchain Solana has already demonstrated the ability to handle 65,000 transactions per second.\n3. Shift away from financialization: Ethereum's co-founder Vitalik Buterin appears to be backing away from the \"financialization\" of the blockchain, which could impact its future growth prospects.\n4. Rise of competitors: Several credible competitors, including Solana, Avalanche,"

Developers are considering either a feature-focused set of smaller Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) or a major protocol upgrade to introduce Verkle Trees to the execution layer. Verkle Trees are a new data structure that could handle more transactions and reduce state bloat, but may take 18 months or more to deliver. Some developers advocate for keeping the focus squarely on Verkle Trees, while others recommend prioritizing a feature-rich fork first. EOF (EVM Object Format) is one candidate for the next upgrade, but may not be included in the small fork.

The company has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and has announced a recovery plan that includes distributing ETH or BTC to creditors. According to Nansen, almost a third of the ETH in the pending withdrawal queue belongs to Celsius, totaling $468.5 million.

Celsius' founder, Alex Mashinsky, is facing fraud charges and is currently out on bail, adding complexity to the company's journey. Despite these challenges, Celsius has entered into an interim agreement with Bitcoin mining company Hut 8 to construct and deploy new mining operation centers in Texas for Celsius creditors."

Celsius has been working towards a settlement plan that allows qualified users to withdraw 72.5% of their crypto holdings until February 28.

The newly formed entity, MiningCo, will be operated by Hut 8 under a four-year mining management contract. Celsius intends to relaunch under a temporary name, \"NewCo,\" until a permanent name is chosen and focus on staking and mining activities, with a projected balance sheet of $1.25 billion and annual earnings of $10 to $20 million through staking crypto on the Ethereum network."

On-chain data from Santiment shows that the 150 largest non-exchange Ethereum wallets have been rapidly accumulating ETH since April 2023, despite a slump in the cryptocurrency's price between August and October. This suggests that these large entities are bullish on the asset and may be driving its long-term optimistic outlook.

This sudden surge in validator exit queues may be linked to Celsius' plans to recall and rebalance crypto assets, including Ethereum, to repay its creditors. Nearly one-third of the ETH in the pending withdrawal queue is attributed to Celsius, with a value of approximately $467 million. The crypto lender's withdrawal share accounts for 206,300 ETH. The recent move by Celsius has positive implications for customers who have been waiting for the return of their funds after 18 months of uncertainty. The liberated Ethereum will serve a dual purpose for Celsius, repaying creditors and offsetting costs incurred during the restructuring process, providing financial maneuverability."
