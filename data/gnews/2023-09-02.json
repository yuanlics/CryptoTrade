        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nIllustration by Mitchell Preffer for Decrypt.\n\nMost of the top thirty cryptocurrencies by market capitalization posted negligible losses or gains over the last seven days.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) starts the weekend at $26,051, pretty much the same level it was at last week.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe world\u2019s most popular cryptocurrency briefly surged on Tuesday after a judge representing the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit ordered a review of the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) denial of crypto asset manager Grayscale\u2019s spot Bitcoin ETF application. The Court said the SEC had failed to provide a \u201ccoherent explanation\u201d for the denial.\n\nEthereum (ETH) took inconsequential seven-day losses of 0.4% and now changes hands at $1,646.\n\nVirtually every other leading cryptocurrency is approximately the same price it was last weekend except Toncoin (TON), which blew up 22% to trade at $1.75, and Bitcoin Cash (BCH), which rose 8.6% to $206.87.\n\nToncoin\u2019s bullish momentum can be attributed to the development of the TON ecosystem.\n\nThe TON Foundation, which spun out from Telegram to develop TON, recently released a Telegram-centric Web3 app store and launched a community-driven initiative, Believers.ton, to promote ecosystem development.\n\nBitcoin Cash was one of the fastest risers when the Grayscale/SEC news broke on Tuesday and appears to have sustained the rally into the weekend. Similarly, Coinbase stock soared 15% in the hours following the news.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAny intraweek gains that Bitcoin and Ethereum made were wiped out early on Friday as the industry reacted to news that the SEC needed more time to approve or reject 6 Bitcoin ETF applications.\n\nAll told, it was another excruciatingly slow news cycle this week for those looking to see some sign of growing global crypto adoption. On Thursday, airline Giant Lufthansa launched an NFT-based loyalty program on Polygon. Polygon\u2019s MATIC token didn\u2019t particularly react to the news, though\u2014it ended the week 1.2% higher at a price of around $0.55."

        "content": "During the aggressive sell-off in mid-August, the Ethereum price showed a bearish breakdown from the support trendline of the channel pattern. Losing the support which carried a bullish trend for nine months, reflects this coin is at risk of an extended correction. However, the falling price halted at 200 EMA slope around $1620 reflecting the buyers\u2019 push to hold higher prices. Will this support bolster the continuation of the prior downtrend?\n\nAlso Read: End Of \u201cGoerli\u201d As Ethereum Clients Release Updates For Holesky Testnet\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum Daily Chart: Key Points\n\nThe Ethereum price may remain at risk of longer correction if the ETH price is unable to rebound from 200 weekly EMA\n\nA breakdown below 200 EMA will trigger a sharp 10% drop in the near term\n\nThe intraday trading volume in Ether is $4.8 Billion, indicating a 30% loss.\n\nSource- Tradingview\n\nDespite a high momentum breakdown from the channel pattern, the ETH sellers failed to offer a suitable follow up reflecting a lack of conviction in bears. Moreover, the weekly chart showed long-wick rejection candles at 200-day EMA as a sign of active accumulation.\n\nThe 200-day EMA is an important technical tool that segregates between the bullish or bearish sentiment in the market. Historically, this EMA slope has acted as major support or resistance and an important turning point in the market.\n\nConsidering the bearish momentum in the market, the Ether price should give a weekly candle closing above the aforementioned support to get a better confirmation for downtrend continuation.\n\nThe post-break fall may have plunged the price to $1500, followed by $1366.\n\nHere\u2019s how ETH Price may restore a bullish trend.\n\nWhile the bearish momentum seems valid for the ETH price, the increasing demand pressure at EMA support could offer a significant bounceback. However, the potential upswing must surpass the aforementioned breakdown high of $1800 to get better confirmation of recovery.\n\nRelative Strength Index: A downtick in the daily RSI slope reflects the selling momentum is active.\n\nExponential Moving Average: A bearish crossover between the 20-and-50 weekly EMAs would bolster sellers for a prolonged downfall."

        "content": "A blue-chip Ethereum (ETH)-based altcoin is showing signs of a potential rally, according to the crypto analytics platform Santiment.\n\nPer Santiment, various metrics are signaling that the native token of the blockchain oracle Chainlink (LINK) could surge, though the prediction is dependent on the behavior of Bitcoin (BTC) and the wider crypto market.\n\n\u201cChainlink has hit a key level that has historically foreshadowed a price rebound. Presuming Bitcoin and the overall crypto sector stays relatively stable, LINK\u2019s drop in exchange supply (currently just 15.5%) is hinting at a bullish divergence.\u201d\n\nLINK is trading at $6.00 at time of writing.\n\nTurning to the governance token of the decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Maker (MKR), Santiment says that whales and sharks have accumulated over $71 million worth of the crypto asset since July 9th.\n\n\u201cMaker has enjoyed a nice +12% day while the rest of crypto slumps. This can largely be attributed to the accumulation by the whales and sharks holding between $11,600 to $11.6 million [in] MKR. Their holdings will continue to correlate with future price movement.\u201d\n\nMKR is trading at $1,155 at time of writing.\n\nOn Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Santiment says,\n\n\u201cBitcoin Cash enjoyed a healthy price rebound, currently back at $214 after being as low as $180 just two weeks ago. Short and long-term traders are both in profit for the first time since mid-June, and whales will be key to a further surge.\u201d\n\nBCH is trading at $206 at time of writing.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Elena is an expert in technical analysis and risk management in cryptocurrency market. She has 10+year experience in writing - accordingly she is avid journalists with a passion towards researching new insights coming into crypto erena.\n\nRenowned macro guru Raoul Pal expresses unwavering optimism in the face of lingering market uncertainties. Pal, a steadfast bull, maintains that his bullish stance, which he has held for an extended period, remains unshaken.\n\nWhen questioned about the foundation of his bullish outlook, Pal elucidated that he believes the much-anticipated recession, which had loomed ominously on the economic horizon, was largely factored into the market dynamics last year. According to him, the substantial downturns witnessed in equity markets and the cryptocurrency realm during that period were clear manifestations of this anticipatory pricing.\n\nRaoul Pal\u2019s Unwavering Bullish Stance\n\nIn a recent interview with Crypto Banter, Pal reiterated his consistent perspective, asserting that the long-anticipated recession has already transpired and was duly assimilated by the markets in the preceding year.\n\nTo illustrate this point, he cited the substantial market fluctuations, including a precipitous 75% decline in cryptocurrencies and a 30-35% dip in stock values, as compelling evidence of the market\u2019s proactive response to the impending economic cycle.\n\nPal expounded on how the market had preemptively adjusted to these anticipated changes in the prior year. Subsequently, it embarked on a path of anticipatory behavior, as evidenced by the discernible surge in liquidity since the month of June.\n\nDrawing from his forward-looking indicators, Pal revealed that liquidity had exhibited an upward trajectory since June of the preceding year. These indicators played a pivotal role in shaping his investment decisions, most notably in Ethereum, where he augmented his holdings during a significant market sell-off.\n\nContemplating the future landscape, Pal highlights that current data trends are now harmonizing with his forward-looking indicators. He emphasized that inflationary pressures are gradually receding, while unemployment figures are showing a gradual ascent. Furthermore, economic growth appears to be losing momentum. These unfolding trends, in Pal\u2019s assessment, suggest that the Federal Reserve may, in due course, contemplate halting its ongoing rate hikes and, potentially, resort to rate cuts in a bid to sustain economic stability."

        "content": "A cold wallet owned by collapsed crypto exchange FTX moved almost $10 million in altcoins from Solana to Ethereum since Aug. 31 for undisclosed reasons, according to on-chain data.\n\nThe altcoins include notable tokens like LINK, SUSHI, LUNA, and YFI. The transfers were conducted through Wormhole Bridge.\n\nIt is unclear if the transfers are connected to the exchange\u2019s bankruptcy proceedings or its recent request to hire Galaxy Digital to sell its crypto holdings for fiat.\n\nFTX did not respond to a request for comment as of press time.\n\nFTX looking to sell assets\n\nFTX recently filed a request with the bankruptcy court seeking permission to engage Galaxy Digital Capital Management as its investment manager for certain digital assets. The exchange also requested permission to stake some idle crypto assets to generate passive yield.\n\nUnder the proposed agreement, Galaxy would manage, trade, and convert FTX\u2019s assets into fiat currency or stablecoins, and hedge the collapsed exchange\u2019s exposure to volatile cryptocurrencies in return for a monthly fiduciary fee.\n\nFTX argued that Galaxy\u2019s expertise in selling large cryptocurrency positions without affecting the market made it a suitable choice. The engagement aimed to support FTX\u2019s restructuring efforts by monetizing its cryptocurrency holdings.\n\nAdditionally, the exchange has filed a separate motion to establish guidelines for managing and selling its digital assets and to enter into hedging arrangements on eligible cryptocurrencies \u2014 primarily Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nCreditors criticize pace\n\nFTX is facing criticism from creditors over the slow pace of its bankruptcy plan negotiations.\n\nThe exchange\u2019s attorney, Brian Glueckstein, resisted calls for expedited mediation at the latest bankruptcy hearing on Aug. 23, saying the process is on track for conclusion in the second quarter of 2024.\n\nA draft plan proposed by FTX on July 31 outlined the intent to repay customers through asset liquidation and litigation against insiders. However, tensions have risen over FTX\u2019s efforts to find a buyer for its international exchange, FTX.com, and the lack of information shared about incoming bids.\n\nCreditors\u2019 committee attorney, Kris Hansen, also highlighted the $50 million monthly spent on attorneys\u2019 fees and other costs due to FTX\u2019s delay in resolving creditor concerns. FTX seeks to increase creditors\u2019 recovery through lawsuits against its founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, investment firm K5, and the founders of FTX acquisition targets.\n\nThe bankruptcy case was filed in November 2022 after allegations that FTX misused and lost billions of dollars of customers\u2019 crypto deposits."
