        "summary": "  Ethereum price may fall to $1500 if buyers lose key support, according to CoinGape. The ETH price showed a bearish breakdown from a support trendline in mid-August, and losing this support could indicate a risk of an extended correction. However, the price halted at 200 EMA slope around $1620, reflecting buyer push to hold higher prices. The post-break fall may have plunged the price to $1500, followed by $1366. To restore a bullish trend, the increasing demand pressure at EMA support could offer a significant bounceback. However, the potential upswing must surpass the breakdown high of $1800 to get better confirmation of recovery."

The price drop is attributed to Bitcoin's recent drop below $26,000, raising questions about Ethereum's stability. If Ethereum fails to show prompt bullish action, it could potentially see a significant price dip. The ETH/BTC chart hints at a breakout from a falling wedge pattern, which could lead to Ethereum outdoing Bitcoin by 10%. However, any decline below the trend line could spell disaster for Ethereum's price. Additionally, a bearish ascending triangle pattern could lead to a 54% decrease in Ethereum's value."

Despite a court victory for Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, the ETH price has lost all of its weekly gains. The trendline is critical, and if bulls don't step in soon, bears may target a massive downside in the coming months. The ETH/BTC chart shows a potential breakout from a falling wedge pattern, which could lead to a 10% outperformance by Ethereum. However, the ETH to USD pair is respecting an upward trendline since June 2022, and a breakdown below this trendline would be cataclysmic for Ethereum price prediction. A higher timeframe analysis shows the formation of an ascending triangle pattern, which could break to the downside with a technical price target of $759, or 54% below the current price level."

He also noted that as \"there already exists examples of the Solana codebase being forked and adapted to act as appchains,\" MakerDAO could follow a similar process to develop NewChain. The proposal aims to make the ecosystem more secure and efficient, and Christensen believes that using Solana's codebase could provide cost-effective and high-quality talent for MakerDAO."
