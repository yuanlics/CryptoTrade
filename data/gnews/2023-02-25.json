        "title": "Ethereum: As blue chip NFTs leave, who takes the spotlight? - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "The volume of blue chip collections, including BAYC, Otherdeed, and MAYC, all declined around the same period\n\nOther not-so-popular collections filled in for the decrease, but there were no substantial changes.\n\nEthereum [ETH] NFTs like Otherdeed, Moonbirds, and Bored Ape Yacht Club [BAYC] were almost always on the list of collections with the most daily gains. Historically, in cases where some do not fall into the fray, others still join those with the most sales volume and transactions.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-2024\n\nBut on 23 February, BAYC, Mutant Ape Yacht Club [MAYC], Otherdeed, and Azuki recorded massive declines as attention moved to other collections. According to CryptoSlam, MAYC still led the volume ranking, but it was only because of the NFT\u2019s high floor prices.\n\nAt press time, the MAYC sales volume was $14.88 million \u2014 8.41% down from the previous 24 hours. Transactions were also down to 564, with reduced involvement of buyers and sellers. In BAYC\u2019s case, it went down to the fifth position. However, it suffered a more tremendous decline than its Yuga Labs\u2019 counterpart.\n\nFrom the image above, BAYC dumped 52.31% in volume, with double-digit decreases in transactions, buyers, and sellers. So, which collection has outperformed the usual suspects?\n\nPenguins, Valhalla, and KILLABEARS NFTs\n\nIn a surprising move, the Pudgy Penguins collection broke into the top 10. Launched in 2021, Pudgy Penguins is an Ethereum-based collection comprising 8,888 penguin NFTs. The project was also an instant hit during the season when profile picture projects (PFP) were the center of attraction.\n\nAt press time, Pudgy Penguins\u2019 sales volume was $2.43 million in the last 24 hours. This represented a 41% increase within the said timeframe. However, data from the NFT aggregator revealed that an incredible increase in buyer and seller participation was vital to the landmark. All in all, 297 transactions led to the rise.\n\nHowever, Pudgy Penguins was only one of many Ethereum NFTs with such a performance. KILLABEARS registered $1.128 million in sales despite being the 16th. However, the most notable surge out of the lots was the Valhalla collection.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nThe collection, which is a crypto-native brand for gamers, increased 483%, thereby making its 24-hour sales volume $2.43 million.\n\nDespite the giant strides recorded by these collections, sales of the Ethereum NFT ecosystem were still down. At the time of writing, the overall sales volume was $82.12 million \u2014 a 28.53% decline. Nonetheless, the decline in the blue-chip collections volume might only last a while."

        "content": "Sohrab is a passionate cryptocurrency news writer with over five years of experience covering the industry. He keeps a keen interest in blockchain technology and its potential to revolutionize finance. Whether he's trading or writing, Sohrab always keeps his finger on the pulse of the crypto world, using his expertise to deliver informative and engaging articles that educate and inspire. When he's not analyzing the markets, Sohrab indulges in his hobbies of graphic design, minimal design or listening to his favorite hip-hop tunes.\n\nPolygon (MATIC) has become one of the most talked-about projects in the cryptocurrency world due to its explosive growth and numerous high-profile partnerships. The project has gained traction and made significant progress in the scaling and adoption of blockchain technology in recent years. Its success has led many to wonder if MATIC can outpace Ether as the go-to blockchain for corporations and the mainstream audience.\n\nBitboy Crypto, the popular YouTube channel run by Ben Armstrong, recently highlighted Polygon\u2019s massive momentum and wind underneath its wings, leading to speculation that it could outpace Ethereum in the near future.\n\nExplosive Growth on the Horizon\n\nAccording to a recent announcement, Polygon has settled on March 27 as the launch date for its much-anticipated ZK EVM mainnet beta network. ZK EVM is a groundbreaking technology that aims to increase the speed of blockchain transactions and reduce their cost.\n\nIt generates cryptographic proofs to process transactions faster before those transactions are sent back to layer 1 networks, in this case, Ethereum. This technology is similar to that used by Polygon\u2019s rivals, Solana and XRP, which have faster transaction speeds and unparalleled centralization. The adoption of ZK EVM by Polygon could help it to overtake Ethereum in the near future.\n\nPartnerships Galore\n\nPolygon has already signed partnerships with Dolce and Gabbana, Disney, and Stripe, among other major corporations. Instagram\u2019s recent announcement that it would be using Polygon for its upcoming in-app NFT minting feature is another major endorsement.\n\nInstagram has over two billion monthly users, which means lots of potential traffic for the Polygon network. Nike has also joined the bandwagon, with its Web3 Studio kicking off with Polygon NFTs. DraftKings and the PGA Tour have also jumped on the Polygon train, with their NFT player cards being built on the platform.\n\nPolygon\u2019s Stellar Performance\n\nPolygon has been performing exceptionally well, with its daily active addresses recently surpassing those of Ethereum. Daily active users on Polygon have surpassed those on Ethereum, with the blockchain coming in second behind BNB Chain, which is known for being set up for a bunch of rug pulls. Polygon\u2019s NFT sales on Open Sea have also beaten Ethereum for the second straight month. These low-cost assets are popular with investors and traders alike.\n\nMATIC Price\n\nThe price of MATIC has risen dramatically over the previous two days, reaching the $1.25 threshold. Speed was gained, and MATIC is now clearly above the $1.30 resistance area. The price surged beyond the $1.50 barrier, an increase of roughly 25%.\n\nA peak was set close to $1.568, and a subsequent downward correction has begun, mirroring that of Bitcoin and Ethereum. There was a break from the $1.40 and $1.42 support levels, indicating more weakness in the market."

        "title": "Arbitrum Scaling Solution: Everything You Need to Know - DailyCoin",
        "content": "Arbitrum is a layer 2 (L2) chain built on Ethereum that helps solve the congestion problem on the Ethereum main net. The network was developed by a New-York based company called Offchain labs.\n\nThe Arbitrum chain is a scaling solution used to confirm transactions on the main Ethereum network. The chain does this by recording Ethereum transactions and then relaying them to the Ethereum main chain at a later point. By doing this, it solves the congestion problem on the main net.\n\nHistory of Arbitrum\n\nArbitrum was founded by Offchain Labs in 2018. Offchain Labs itself was founded in 2018 by Ed Felten, Harry Kalodner, and Steven Goldfeder.\n\nFelten was a Computer Science and Public Relations professor at Princeton before he started building Offchain Labs. He also served as the Deputy Chief Technology officer of the White House between 2015 and 2017. After leaving his position at the White House, Felten went on to found Offchain Labs.\n\nAccording to Felten, the idea behind Offchain Labs came to him while he was an academic at Princeton. He says that he\u2019d started working on it back then, and only started doing it full-time after leaving his White House position.\n\nSince Felten started Offchain Labs, the company has received a lot of support. It has gotten investment from crypto juggernauts such as Coinbase Ventures, Panthera, and Blocknation since its inception.\n\nBut what is Arbitrium, and how does it work?\n\nHow Does Arbitrum Work?\n\nA big problem of the Ethereum blockchain is speed. The blockchain can only facilitate a certain number of transactions at a time, and when this number is exceeded, other transactions form a queue. This could lead to some inconvenient situations.\n\nFor example, some dApps, such as Farmers World require transactions to be completed in real-time. If these transactions aren\u2019t completed in real-time (or a close approximation), they could render the dApp worthless. The congestion on Ethereum means that these transactions could be delayed by a considerable period of time.\n\nSuch dApps now have to endure that delay because of Ethereum\u2019s popularity. There are more dApps on Ethereum now, and transaction delays have only grown. That means more transactions are being loaded into the chain, and it\u2019s taking even more time for these transactions to be completed.\n\nThere are two proposed solutions for this congestion problem on the Ethereum chain. The first solution to this problem is to embrace sharding. That is, the Ethereum chain will be split into multiple shards, which should theoretically increase the capacity of the chain to complete transactions.\n\nHowever, sharding the Ethereum network is a long and complicated process. While it already exists right now, it\u2019s not yet at a scale where it will necessarily impact transaction time. This means that dApps that want faster transaction time need to look for another immediate solution.\n\nThe second solution for this decongestion is off-chain data confirmation. This means relaying the smart contracts to an off-chain solution that confirms it and then adds it to the Ethereum chain at a later date.\n\nThis method of confirming transactions is called roll-up. According to Ethereum, rollup solutions perform transactions outside the Ethereum blockchain and then post the data to the chain where consensus is reached.\n\nThis means that certain transactions can be confirmed in real-time, while consensus over the transaction will be reached on the Ethereum main chain at a later point. Since the transaction data is included in the layer 1 blocks, the transactions retain an equal level of safety as directly confirmed transactions.\n\nThese rollups are performed by layer 2 chains, and Arbitrum is one such chain.\n\nThe Ethereum Merge and Gas Fees\n\nIn late 2022, Ethereum took a huge step towards sharding by completing the Ethereum merge. This merge was theoretically supposed to reduce congestion on the Ethereum chain and make it easier to confirm transactions through it. However, Ethereum\u2019s congestion problem has remained despite the merge. This means that Arbitrum and layers like it will probably become even more popular.\n\nArbitrum doesn\u2019t just solve the decongestion problem on Ethereum, it also solves the gas fees problem too. The bigger the congestion on the ETH network, the higher the gas fee one has to pay for quick transactions. However, Arbitrum solves that problem because contracts are now validated in batches.\n\nThe Optimistic Arbitrum\n\nThere are two types of transaction rollup chains, and they differ because of their security models.\n\nThe first is the zero-knowledge rollups. The zero-knowledge rollups perform the computation of transactions off-chain and then submit it to the layer 1 chain through a validity proof. The summary data submitted to the chain from the rollup only defines the changes that should be made to the Ethereum state and cryptographic proof that those changes are correct and valid.\n\nOptimistic rollups, on the other hand, submits the data assuming it is correct by default. Hence, the validity of the data is only double-checked if there\u2019s someone challenges it. To ascertain the validity of the transaction, a fraud-proof is automatically run on the changed data.\n\nArbitrum is an optimistic rollup chain, which means that data is submitted with the assumption that it is valid by default. Because of Arbitrum\u2019s optimistic data outlook, it has important advantages over zero-knowledge layer 2 chains.\n\nFor one, optimistic rollups are cheaper than zero-knowledge solutions. The gas fees are often lower per transaction batch, and the network also has lower off-chain computation costs.\n\nSecondly, optimistic rollups are directly compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). This means that even layer 1 applications can easily connect to Arbitrum and enjoy faster confirmation times.\n\nThe Arbitrum Coin?\n\nLayer 2 solutions usually have native coins that are used to compensate validators. However, Arbitrum doesn\u2019t have a native coin. According to Ed Felten, the co-founder of Offchain labs, there is no plan to launch a separate Arbitrum token.\n\nThis means there is no direct way to invest in Arbitrum. However, there\u2019s been a few changes to the position of Offchain Labs when it comes to minting an Arbitrum Coin. In April 2022, a cofounder of Offchain labs, Steven Goldfeder, posted a tweet that insinuated that an \u201cArbi\u201d coin is in the works. This tweet was most likely a response to Arbitrum\u2019s competitor, Optimism, releasing an OP token.\n\nHowever, it may not be advisable for Arbitrum to drop a token right now. The bear market is still ravaging the crypto ecosystem despite Bitcoin\u2019s recent recovery, and things are still a bit uncertain. While no one can say what Offchain Labs will do for sure, it\u2019s likely that they hold off any potential token drop until the market recovers.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nVitalik Buterin has argued that layer 2 chains may be the permanent solution to Ethereum\u2019s congestion problems, rather than a stopgap.\n\nArbitrum doesn\u2019t have a token. This means that it\u2019s impossible for small retail investors to invest in it.\n\nWhy You Should Care\n\nLayer 2 chains like Arbitrum are one of the most exciting developments in crypto in recent times. This is because they could be the permanent solution to Ethereum\u2019s congestion problem. Since Ethereum\u2019s congestion problem is a big stumbling block to crypto adoption, solving it could be big news for the crypto ecosystem.\n\nFAQs"
