        "content": "Concurrently, stakers over the last 24 hours have deposited more ETH into the chain than there have been withdrawal requests, creating a net 86,000 ETH staked, or 0.3% increase in staked ETH \u2013 despite all the withdrawals that have already taken place. This shows that since the upgrade, stakers have gained confidence in Ethereum\u2019s staking process."

The Shanghai upgrade primarily impacted Ethereum's (ETH) Execution Layer, while Capella targeted the Consensus Layer. The implementation dubbed \"Shapella,\" is expected to enhance the network's performance, security, and efficiency.The upgrade allowed users to withdraw billions of dollars in Ether, the native token of the Ethereum network, and the network recorded a hefty inflow of deposits, touching a yearly high of $2,129.Staking in crypto involves holding and locking up a certain amount of cryptocurrency to participate in the network and earn returns akin to a traditional bank FD.Investors were fearing that Ether holders would quickly withdraw their staked tokens, but fresh deposits helped sustain the staking balance for a couple of days. But lately, withdrawals from Ethereum staking contracts have exceeded deposits.Indian investors said that Ethereum holders now have more confidence to stake their tokens after the Shanghai upgrade as it will allow them to unstake their ETH after a 14-day lock-in period from that day.\"Unlike other Smart Contract Blockchains, the percentage of staked tokens is only 15% in Ethereum, which is expected to rise from here on. Cardano has 69% of ADA tokens staked, Avalanche has 54% AVAX staked, Solana has 71% of SOL staked,\" said Ashwini Nadar, a Mumbai-based software professional and avid crypto enthusiast.Ethereum, a decentralized blockchain platform founded by Vitalik Buterin in 2015, allows developers to create decentralised applications (dApps) and smart contracts. It ranks as the second-largest cryptocurrency platform by market capitalisation, following Bitcoin.Ethereum upgrades, often called \"hard forks\" or \"network upgrades,\" entail modifications to the Ethereum protocol or the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), which operates smart contracts.At CoinDCX, Ethereum gained more than 6% a day after the upgrade.The exchange said that its on-chain data showed that there was a significant increase of nearly 100,000 ETH tokens staked on the Ethereum blockchain on April 14, marking the largest one-day increase in almost two months.\"This suggests that rather than withdrawing staked ETH to cash out, a significant portion of investors view the successful Shapella upgrade as an indication to stake their Ether tokens,\" said Thukral of CoinDCX.The upgrade sets the stage for a transition to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, replacing the existing proof-of-work (PoW) system."
