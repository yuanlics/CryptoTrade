        "title": "Ethereum Staking Explained: Is ETH Staking Worth It? - CoinCodex",
        "summary": "  Ethereum staking is now available, and ETH holders can earn rewards by staking their coins. The Ethereum network has transitioned to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, which allows validators to stake ETH in exchange for participating in the consensus process. Stakers can earn rewards for adding new blocks to the Ethereum blockchain and for checking the validity of transactions. The rewards vary depending on the number of validators active on the network and network activity.\n\nThere are different ways to stake ETH, including solo staking, staking as a service, staking pools, and staking through crypto exchanges. Solo staking requires 32 ETH to launch a validator, while staking as a service and staking pools allow users to stake smaller amounts of ETH. Crypto exchanges also offer Ethereum staking services, but they take a cut of the rewards.\n\nThe benefits of staking ETH include passive income growth, decentralization, and the ability to contribute to the security of the Ethereum network. However, there are also risks involved"

The subsequent 3.5% correction down to $2,560 on Jan. 16 may have disappointed some bulls. Despite this, Ether's price has outperformed Bitcoin by 19.5% since Jan. 8.\n\nHowever, it is unclear if the $2,500 level will hold, as the most obvious drivers are not expected in the short term, such as the Ethereum spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) and the planned Ethereum network upgrades. While these events present an opportunity for Ether to further decouple from the remaining cryptocurrency market, they also present a risk if they either backfire or are postponed.\n\nEther usually does not outperform Bitcoin by 15% or higher in a week, and the latest instance happened 14 months ago."
