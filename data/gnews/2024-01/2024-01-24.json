        "title": "SEC Delays BlackRock Spot Ethereum ETF - Watcher Guru",
        "summary": "  The SEC has delayed BlackRock's Spot Ethereum ETF application, citing the need for more time to consider the proposal and the issues raised. This is the latest development in the next wave of cryptocurrency ETFs, following the approval of Spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this month. The SEC has also delayed decisions on every Spot Bitcoin ETF application before approval, including BlackRock's, and has a new deadline of March 10, 2024, to approve or deny the ETF. The SEC is not a fan of cryptocurrency and has been criticized for delaying the approval of ETFs, leading to feelings of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu among cryptocurrency enthusiasts. Other asset management firms have filed ETF applications for Ethereum, but their approval may also be delayed."
