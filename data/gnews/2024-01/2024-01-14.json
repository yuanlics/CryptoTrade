This is fueled by the recent price surge, which has risen by almost 10% since the SEC approved a Bitcoin ETF. However, the disparity in trading strategies between short-term and long-term holders could impact the coin's price movement. Some short-term traders may sell their ETH to lock in gains, which could lead to temporary price dips. Long-term holders may be more inclined to hold their ETH, reducing the circulating supply and contributing to price appreciation in the long term. The market sentiment remains bullish, with key momentum indicators at overbought highs and steady capital inflow."
