        "summary": "  Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) are in a debate over which cryptocurrency is more sound, with proponents of both sides presenting arguments. Ultra Sound Money, an Ethereum-focused Twitter user, compared the two cryptocurrencies' supply issuance and suggested that ETH's deflationary model makes it sounder. However, BTC proponents argue that soundness comes from the credibility of the monetary policy, not an ever-changing one. They also pointed out that Ethereum's monetary policy has changed multiple times in the past, while Bitcoin has not. In response, Ethereum educator Anthony Sassano claimed that every change on the Ethereum network has been approved by node operators, and Leo Glisic stated that ETH has become sound money now, but BTC won't hit its cap until 2140. The debate highlights the ongoing discussion around the merits of capped versus deflationary supply models in the context of cryptocurrency."
