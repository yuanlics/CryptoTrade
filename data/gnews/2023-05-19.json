Vitalik Buterin launched the network in 2015, and it has since become a hub for decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The network's native cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH), is used to pay transaction fees and has a mechanism to remove some ETH from circulation, making it deflationary when network traffic is busy. However, the network can become congested and expensive to use during periods of high market activity. To address this, Ethereum is implementing additional upgrades to make it faster and cheaper to use. (248 tokens)"

The problem stemmed from two consensus clients, including Prysm, spending too much computing resources on processing worthless block attestations. The Prysm client is used by 37.6% of Ethereum validating nodes, but it struggled to handle incoming attestations due to a huge increase in staked ether. This caused a failure to finalize for nine epochs, but the damage was minimal. The issue has been fixed, and the community is taking a toll on some members."

The bot sells the attacker's pepe for ether, causing the price to climb, then swaps the pepe for ether, receiving less than expected due to the price hike. The bot gains 0.04 ETH and 300 memecoins, unbeknownst to the victim. The bot is effective due to its large supply of pepe and ability to \"snipe\" at the right moment.
