        "content": "Spotlight Wire\n\nSpotlight Wire\n\nThe crypto industry is constantly growing, redefining the very concept of financial assets. Decentralised Finance (DeFi) is coming into the spotlight, and with its accessibility, affordability, and convenience, it\u2019s no surprise to see why.Blockchain networks are the heart of cryptocurrency, and DeFi blockchains offer several altcoins the support they need. Meanwhile, the industry is also welcoming new DeFi cryptocurrencies like Big Eyes Coin (BIG) , which is wrapping up its iconic presale to launch very soon.Do Big Eyes have what it takes to take over the top DeFi blockchains like Ethereum and Avalanche? Read on to find out.Launched in 2014, the Ethereum network is the founder\u2019s solution to Bitcoin\u2019s inability to attach real-world assets to its blockchain and its need for a robust language to carry this process out. Ethereum has since grown to accommodate 1589 tokens, and its native cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH), is now the second largest cryptocurrency in terms of market capitalisation.Ethereum provides a highly versatile platform for building decentralised applications using the Solidity programming language and Ethereum Virtual Machine. Developers who create smart contracts on Ethereum benefit from a mature ecosystem of developer tools and best practices.The platform\u2019s maturity also reflects in the user experience, with user-friendly wallets such as MetaMask, Argent, and Rainbow, enabling easy interaction with the Ethereum blockchain and smart contracts. The extensive user base of Ethereum motivates developers to deploy their applications on the network, solidifying Ethereum\u2019s position as the leading platform for DeFi and NFTs.Avalanche started in 2018 as a protocol to solve the issue of unreliable machine crashes. Later, it was developed by a research team. They made a start-up company that would meet the finance industry\u2019s needs. The company introduced its native token AVAX in 2020.The Avalanche network boasts several advantages. The maximum supply of AVAX coins is 720 million, but AVAX holders who vote to adjust the reward for adding a new block to the Avalanche blockchain determine the coin creation rate. Transaction fees vary depending on transaction type and network congestion, and all fees are burned to reduce the number of coins in circulation.AVAX fees are subject to change based on user voting. Transactions on the Avalanche blockchain are confirmed using a unique method requiring random network participant subsets to confirm transactions. Network participants can earn more AVAX rewards for processing transactions by maintaining high uptime and fast response times.For a while now, the brand new DeFi meme coin, Big Eyes (BIG), has created quite a stir with its presale . This was no ordinary feat, as BIG has managed to break the presale record of Ether itself. And launching on the 15th of June, BIG is preparing to take over Ethereum\u2019s network as an ERC-20 token.What makes the Big Eyes Coin goal plausible? It boasts an ecosystem free from buying, selling, and trading tax. The supply is limited to 200 billion tokens, but 75% will be available on launch and locked in a liquidity pool to provide stability and liquidity to the token. In other words, remember how Bitcoin\u2019s price skyrocketed when there was high demand but limited supply?But this isn\u2019t just about making a fortune. Big Eyes Coin has set aside 5% of its supply to create a charity wallet that supports ocean sanctuaries. A cat has got to eat. The good intentions come from a passionate community that powers this paw-dorable coin. This is evident from their ever-so-happening Twitter handle and the 26,000-member Telegram group But that\u2019s not all. Their roadmap includes projects that cater to the broader investor base. There is an NFT Space, the Sushi Crew, under development.As they wrap up their presale on the 3rd of June, Big Eyes Coin has one last trick up its sleeve. Until the end of the presale, the team is selling BIG tokens for its Stage 3 price, which is only $0.00017 per token. Go BIG, or go home with Big Eyes!Big Eyes Coin flaunts unmatched potential with its plethora of features and offerings. With a track record of collecting over $38.3 million in the presale stage, it is on its way to taking over the best DeFi blockchains. Try Big Eyes Coin to be a part of the next BIG thing in the crypto world."

        "content": "CHEYENNE, WY / ACCESSWIRE / May 19, 2023 / Cryptographic protocols that secure networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum are - for the time being - impervious to even the most advanced computers. However, imagine a near-future scenario where computers have advanced to such a level that current cryptographic standards become insufficient.\n\nThe Quantum Resistance Corporation, Friday, May 19, 2023, Press release picture\n\nThis potential danger arises from quantum computers, a cutting-edge technology that has the potential to compromise many of the encryption protocols used in cryptocurrencies today. Although quantum computers are in their infancy and not yet powerful enough to do so, experts predict that, if current trends continue, they could threaten blockchain networks by 2030.\n\nQuantum Resistant Ledger ( QRL ) aims to address this doomsday threat as the world's first post-quantum store of value and decentralized communication network to proactively tackle the threat of advanced quantum computing. The following article will deep dive into the nature of the quantum threat, and explain how QRL could be positioned to transform the industry by providing a post-quantum solution.\n\nThe Quantum Threat to Cryptocurrency\n\nBefore delving into how QRL offers a solution to the quantum threat to cryptocurrency , it is important to understand how quantum computers work and the current risks associated with popular blockchains such as Ethereum and Bitcoin.\n\nWhat Is Quantum Computing?\n\nQuantum computers are a type of supercomputer with far superior processing power than classical computers. They are able to carry out many computations while simultaneously considering several different configurations - this makes them exponentially faster than traditional computers.\n\nOver the past few years, quantum computing has shown significant progress in various fields, including AI, weather forecasting and medical research. However, in the wrong hands, quantum computing has the potential to pose a substantial risk to cybersecurity, and consequently, to cryptocurrencies as well.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor example, Google's 54-qubit Sycamore processor completed a computation in 200 seconds that would have taken the most powerful classical computer in the world 10,000 years . According to a report by IBM , in theory, cryptographic protocols can be solved within a few hours with quantum computers.\n\nTypes of Quantum Attacks\n\nBroadly speaking, traditional cryptocurrencies face two primary types of threats, which are:\n\nStorage Attacks: An attack that targets individual wallet addresses, trying to break their security and steal the cryptocurrency stored in them.\n\nTransit Attacks: An attack that focuses on taking control of all transactions happening in real-time on the network.\n\nVulnerabilities of Existing Cryptocurrencies\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum, the world's two largest cryptocurrencies, account for almost 60% of the industry's total market capitalization. Bitcoin as an asset functions like digital gold, providing a decentralized, immutable and secure store of value. Conversely, Ethereum is like a publicly shared computer network that enables developers to create applications on decentralized servers.\n\nWhen it comes to storage attacks, Ethereum is at a higher risk than Bitcoin. A recent Deloitte study revealed that about 65% of all Ether is vulnerable to quantum attacks, significantly more than the 25% of vulnerable Bitcoin.\n\nTransit attacks, though more severe, are also more challenging to execute. According to Mark Webber at the University of Sussex in the U.K., breaking this level of encryption would reportedly require a quantum computer with 1.9 billion qubits of power.\n\nThis number is staggering, especially when compared to IBM's most advanced quantum computer, which has only 127 qubits in comparison. Ethereum's creator, Vitalik Buterin, tweeted in 2019 that current speculations about quantum computing are as distant from real quantum computing as hydrogen bombs are from nuclear fusion. But rapid advancements in AI-assisted technology could be changing the outlook and accelerating the quantum timeline.\n\nQRL's Quantum-Safe Blockchain Technology\n\nTraditional cryptographic methods such as RSA and elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) rely on computational complexity for security. However, this model is an ineffective long-term solution since quantum computers can solve these methods. QRL says it solves this vulnerability by creating cryptography based on problems that are believed to be resistant to quantum attacks, providing enhanced security in the quantum era.\n\nOne of the key components of QRL's cryptography is the eXtended Merkle Signature Scheme (XMSS). This is a unique mathematical function that is designed to allow for secure and efficient transaction authentication when taking into account the trends of quantum computers.\n\nIn addition to securing transactions, QRL leverages advanced techniques such as on-chain lattice key storage and layer-to-internode communication to secure communications on the blockchain.\n\nThe Road Ahead For QRL And The Cryptocurrency Industry?\n\nOverall, although the advent of quantum technology raises concerns, the ongoing development of cryptographic encryption has the potential to surpass the progress of quantum computing.\n\nAs quantum computing remains in its nascent stages, investors and centralized organizations have the opportunity to transition to quantum-resistant cryptography. The situation is much different for decentralized blockchain technology, which post-quantum security analysts insist has a fatal and fundamentally unfixable flaw . QRL doesn't have this problem, they maintain. In any case, QRL seems to be at the vanguard of the post-quantum security frontier and well-positioned to offer a safe way for transactions and communications in a post-quantum world.\n\nFeatured Photo by Sunil Ray on Unsplash\n\nContact:\n\nMike Zeiger\n\n4d5a@theqrc.com\n\nSOURCE: The Quantum Resistance Corporation\n\n\n\n\n\nView source version on accesswire.com:\n\nhttps://www.accesswire.com/756041/The-Quantum-Threat-To-Cryptocurrency-How-QRLs-Quantum-Safe-Blockchain-Technology-Could-Be-Poised-To-Revolutionize-The-Industry\n\n\n\n"
