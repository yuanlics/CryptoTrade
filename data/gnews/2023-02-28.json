        "content": "The Ethereum blockchain\u2019s Sepolia testnet has undergone a successful upgrade that simulates the upcoming Shanghai hard fork expected to take place on mainnet in March.\n\nThe \u201cShapella\u201d upgrade, which combines the names of the upcoming Shanghai and Capella hard forks, was successfully implemented on the testnet on Feb. 28.\n\nSepolia testnet has successfully upgraded to Shapella!\n\n\n\nSome of the Prsym validators are offline due to the old geth version.

One of the major changes enables validators to withdraw their staked Ether from the Beacon Chain back to the execution layer.\n\nRelated: Lido Finance activates staking rate limit after more than 150,000 ETH staked\n\nValidators needed to stake 32 Ether (ETH) to validate on the Ethereum blockchain. They will now be able to withdraw rewards in excess of 32 ETH and be permitted to keep validating while those who wish to fully withdraw can take all 32 ETH plus rewards and cease validating.\n\nThe next step before the Shanghai fork goes live on the mainnet will be to release the upgrade on the Ethereum Goerli testnet, which is expected to commence in March."

        "content": "Ethereum Price Today: The market is trading in red today, as most of the significant coins see a decline. Investors are currently exercising caution when it comes to investing in riskier assets, primarily due to concerns surrounding mounting macroeconomic issues, which have been exacerbated by higher-than-anticipated inflation rates.\n\nThe global crypto market cap stands at 1.07 trillion USD, a decrease of 0.36% over the past day. The total crypto market volume in the last 24 hours increased by 28.36% and is currently at 45.38 billion USD.\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum (ETH) decreases by 0.51%\n\nThe second largest crypto, Ethereum price today dropped by 0.51% in the last 24 hours. The market cap for Ethereum is 199.31 billion USD. Moreover, trading volume increases by 14.87% over the previous 24 hours. Each ETH token is trading for 1,628 USD, holding on to the support level of 1600. Source: coinmarketcap\n\nA step further to Shanghai Upgrade\n\nThe Sepolia testnet, Ethereum\u2019s second test network, has successfully replicated withdrawals of staked ether (ETH), marking a significant step towards the highly anticipated Shanghai Upgrade for the Ethereum blockchain. This upgrade, which was triggered at epoch 56832, allows validators to withdraw their stake from the Beacon Chain back to the execution layer and introduces new features to the execution and consensus layers.\n\nOnce implemented, the Shanghai Upgrade will signify Ethereum\u2019s complete transition to a fully functional proof-of-stake network, enabling validators to withdraw rewards earned from adding or approving blocks to the blockchain. The announcement of the live and finalized Shapella network on the Sepolia testnet was shared by Ethereum developers and clients on Twitter. The next upgrade will occur on the Goerli testnet, followed by the mainnet, ultimately finalizing the Shanghai upgrade."

        "title": "Vitalik Buterin says 'more still needs to be done' over high Ethereum txn fees - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "In a new blog post published on Feb. 28, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin documented the continued need to improve the network to better facilitate Ether (ETH) as a means of payment.\n\nButerin shared how he tried to pay for tea for himself and friends at a coffee shop in Argentina in 2021 but had to pay 0.01 ETH (around $40 at the time), as that was the minimum deposit for the owner\u2019s exchange account. \u201cI did not mind the 3x overpayment and treated it as a tip,\u201d the co-founder wrote.\n\nIn another instance, Buterin explained how he tried to pay for tea at another location in 2022, but two separate transactions failed due to requiring \u201cextra gas to process the transfer\u201d and a UI glitch in his mobile wallet. Buterin also raised the issue of unpredictable transaction times, writing:\n\n\u201cMany times, there has been a surprisingly long time delay between my transaction getting accepted on-chain, and the service acknowledging the transaction, even as \u2018unconfirmed.\u2019 Some of those times, I definitely got worried that there was some glitch with the payment system on their side.\u201d\n\nAccording to Buterin, outliers nevertheless remain on the Ethereum network despite recent improvements. \u201cIf you send a transaction at the same time as when many others are sending transactions and the base fee is spiking up, you risk the base fee going too high and your transaction not getting accepted,\u201d he wrote. \u201cEven worse, wallet UIs suck at showing this. There are no big red flashing alerts, and very little clear indication of what you\u2019re supposed to do to solve this problem.\u201d Buterin added that even experts could be confused about how to speed up transactions in such cases.\n\n\u201cGood user experience is not about the average case, it is about the worst case. A UI that is clean and sleek, but does some weird and unexplainable thing 0.723% of the time that causes big problems, is worse than a UI that exposes more gritty details to the user but at least makes it easier to understand what\u2019s going on and fix any problem that does arise.\u201d\n\nAmong other issues, Buterin raised the problem of the internet being \u201cnot 100% reliable\u201d and the need for possible offline proof that customers indeed transfered their transaction data directly to the merchant. Another issue raised was \u201closing a small amount of BTC and ETH\u201d due to secret-sharing-based off-chain social recovery methods for wallets, which Buterin deemed as fragile.\n\nAccording to YCharts, Ethereum transaction fees have fallen to an average of $0.656 at the time of publication, which is much lower than the average of $20 witnessed during the peak of the crypto bull market in 2021.\n\n\u201cAlong with the all-important issue of high transaction fees due to scaling not yet being fully solved, user experience is a key reason why many Ethereum users, especially in the Global South, often opt for centralized solutions instead of on-chain decentralized alternatives that keep power in the hands of the user and their friends and family or local community.\u201d"

        "content": "Action Mounts on Goerli ETH Despite Switch to Holli Testnet\n\nBy: Samuel Haig \u2022 Loading...\n\nMarkets\n\nThe Goerli testnet may have given way to a new one, but that hasn\u2019t stopped traders from speculating on the price of Goerli ETH.\n\nOn Sunday, Polygon\u2019s Mudit Gupta flagged that GoETH were trading for $0.69 each. Hayden Adams, the founder of Uniswap, shared data showing that users traded $1.5M worth of GoETH over 24 hours.\n\nThis despite the fact that Ethereum\u2019s devs are transitioning away from the Goerli network to a new testnet called Holli.\n\n\u201cTestnet Ether is supposed to be free but is being marked up by speculators,\u201d Gupta said. \u201cKeyboard warriors will tell you that the developers are buying it but no, they are not. Maye 0.1% are buying for consumption.\u201d\n\nExperiment With Code\n\nGoerli is a testnet used by developers to experiment with code before launching to the public on the Ethereum mainnet. GoETH is used to pay for transactions of the testnet.\n\nGoETH was initially freely distributed to users via \u201cfaucets,\u201d websites that issue coins to users without charge. However, developers resorted to purchasing testnet coins amid a shortage last year. Without GoETH, devs cannot experiment on the test network, posing a threat to innovation on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nGupta launched a faucet that distributed 6M GoETH for free. The coins he distributed would be worth $4M at current prices.\n\nDenali Marsh, a blockchain engineer for Kava Labs, said he bought 10 GoETH for testing last week.\n\n\u201cI tried every faucet including yours, but swapping was the only way to get the amount I needed quickly,\u201d Marsh tweeted. \u201cSpeculation on public utilities is gross but the market drives solutions.\u201d\n\nGupta replied that monetizing testnet coins offers a short-term solution, but lamented that people have not invested the same resources into solving the underlying problem they\u2019ve spent on devising methods to profit from it.\n\nThe GoETH speculation comes despite Ethereum\u2019s devs making plans to abandon the test network. \u201cY\u2019all know [Goerli is] deprecated and soon to be fully unsupported testnet right?\u201d Adams tweeted.\n\nDeFi Alpha Premium Content DeFi Daily | Weekdays\n\nDeFi Alpha Letter | Weekly\n\nDefiant Podcast Transcript | Weekly\n\nInbox Dump | Saturday\n\nWeekly Recap | Sunday Looking for Alpha?

Start for free\n\nDifferent Strategies\n\nOn Feb 24, Tim Beiko of the Ethereum Foundation confirmed that a new testnet, Holli, will launch later this year to replace Goerli.\n\n\u201cOver the years, application developers\u2019 usage of testnets grew exponentially,\u201d Beiko said. \u201cThe distribution methods for GoETH (informal allocations + easy-to-game faucets) became less and less reliable, leading to the current issues around acquiring GoETH.\u201d\n\nBeiko said Ethereum\u2019s devs are considering different strategies for issuing test tokens on Holli, urging community members to reach out with suggestions.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really hard to fix live testnets, but fairly easy to set up the next ones with better starting conditions,\u201d Beiko said. \u201cIf you have strong opinions about this, now\u2019s a good time to make them heard.\u201d"
