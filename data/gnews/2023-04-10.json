        "title": "Analyst Names Year When Ethereum (ETH) Might Reach $10,000 - U.Today",
        "content": "Disclaimer: The opinions expressed by our writers are their own and do not represent the views of U.Today. The financial and market information provided on U.Today is intended for informational purposes only. U.Today is not liable for any financial losses incurred while trading cryptocurrencies. Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nIn a recent series of tweets , Chris Burniske, a well-known analyst, made a bold prediction about the future of Ethereum (ETH). Burniske hinted that Ethereum's price could reach $10,000 by 2025. While this may seem like a stretch, especially considering Ethereum's current price of $1,858, Burniske's optimism should not be disregarded.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBurniske's tweets were seemingly aimed at those who have been consistently bearish on Ethereum, even as its price has risen from $1 to $10, $100 and $1,000. He suggests that the naysayers may have to reconsider their stance as Ethereum continues its upward trajectory, potentially reaching the $10,000 mark by 2025.\n\nThere are several factors that could contribute to Ethereum's bullish rally in the coming years. The recently announced staking contract unlock could lead to increased adoption of Ethereum and its associated technologies, such as decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\n\nFurthermore, the resurgence of interest in blockchain technology and digital currencies from institutional investors may considerably boost Ethereum's value. As an increasing number of institutions start allocating a portion of their portfolios to cryptocurrencies, Ethereum is expected to reap the benefits of heightened demand and investment.\n\nIt is important to highlight that Ethereum's supply dynamics are undergoing a transformation due to the introduction of EIP-1559, which implements a fee-burning mechanism. This modification could render Ethereum scarcer, potentially resulting in a rise in its worth over time.\n\nAlthough Burniske's forecast of Ethereum hitting $10,000 by 2025 may appear excessively optimistic, it is crucial to bear in mind that the crypto market is infamously unstable and erratic. Even the most seasoned experts can have difficulty precisely predicting the future trajectories of digital assets."

        "content": "Developers at Ethereum, the world\u2019s second-biggest blockchain with a capitalization of US$231 billion, are set to upgrade the software network on Wednesday with reported new features and improvements to efficiency, cost and security.\n\nHowever, the main feature of the so-called Shanghai upgrade \u2013 to take place at 10:27 p.m. UTC on Wednesday, according to the Ethereum Foundation \u2013 is the EIP-4895. This allows users to withdraw their staked Ether, or tokens deposited to support the operations of a blockchain in return for a passive income, usually in the form of more tokens.\n\nWith around 18 million Ether (US$34.5 billion) \u2013 or about 15% of the total supply \u2013 staked into the network, according to Etherscan, concerns emerged that holders could rush to sell Ether to lock in profits, which would drive prices lower. Ether has risen about 60% so far this year and recently traded at more than US$1,900.\n\nBut on-chain data provider CryptoQuant doesn\u2019t expect a flood of Ether sales, according to a report it released in February.\n\n\u201cWe argue that there would be low selling pressure for Ether from staking withdrawals after the Shanghai upgrade,\u201d CryptoQuant said, adding that the majority of the staked Ether was still holding losses compared to Ether prices when it was staked. Ether reached all time highs of more than US$4,600 in November 2021.\n\n\u201cTypically, selling pressure emerges when market participants are sitting on extreme profits, which is not the case right now for the Ether that has been staked,\u201d CryptoQuant said.\n\nCryptoQuant also pointed out that the currently locked Ether cannot be withdrawn simultaneously, estimating it may take up to a year to withdraw the total value staked in the network,\n\nOther benefits\n\nZhuling Chen, chief executive officer of crypto staking service provider RockX, said some short-term market volatility is to be expected following the upgrade, but he preferred to focus on the \u201csubstantial\u201d long-term benefits to the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cEthereum\u2019s capacity to handle more transactions per second increases, transaction costs decrease, and the security and efficiency of smart contracts improve,\u201d Chen said in a statement. The staking landscape will be transformed and Ethereum will become the benchmark yield for crypto, Chen added.\n\nThat\u2019s a view shared by Alex Esin, chief executive officer of P2P.org, which offers institutional staking and blockchain development services. Expect a substantial increase in staking activity in the year following the Shanghai upgrade, Esin said in a statement.\n\n\u201cWe do not anticipate a massive unstaking once this functionality goes live,\u201d Esin said.\n\nGuilhem Chaumont, chief executive officer of crypto-financial service Flowdesk, points out the system to withdraw staked Ether could itself prevent a sell off in the token.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to realize that the withdrawal queue only allows a limited set of requests per day (115,200), so while there may be sustained downward pressure on the price, unstaking is not likely to cause a sharp, sudden dip,\u201d he said in an emailed comment.\n\nChaumont said it\u2019s more likely a sizable portion of Ether will remain staked \u201cwith staking rewards outperforming current interest rates.\u201d\n\nOverreact?\n\nKen Timsit, head of Cronos Labs, the accelerator of the Cronos chain that links the Ethereum and Cosmos blockchains, did caution that Ether stakers will monitor withdrawals after the Shanghai upgrade kicks in and may potentially overreact if there is significant withdrawal demand.\n\n\u201cOnce short-term volatility has been smoothed out, however, it is likely that the outcome will be neutral given that this upgrade has been priced into Ether value for some time,\u201d Timsit said in an emailed comment.\n\nDanny Chong, co-founder of Tranchess, a decentralized app that offers Ethereum services, said the Shanghai upgrade will lower the risks associated with liquid staking and \u201cshould see increased institutional participation.\u201d\n\nLiquid staking, also known as soft staking, allows investors to access their locked funds for other crypto-based activities while still earning rewards. Users with deposits locked on liquid staking platforms receive a tokenized version of their crypto assets, which then can be stored or traded elsewhere.\n\nThe total value of crypto assets locked in liquid staking services stood at US$17.3 billion on Tuesday, up from US$14 billion on March 1, making liquid staking the second-largest service in decentralized finance, following decentralized exchanges, according to data provider DefiLlama.\n\n\u201cEarning yield from liquid staking shares similarities with certain traditional financial instruments such as bonds or stocks that offer interest payments,\u201d Chong said. \u201cHence it would likely attract TradFi [traditional finance] participants who are familiar with such instruments.\u201d\n\nChen of RockX shared similar views: \u201cWe will see more innovations coming from direct and liquid staking solutions, and liquid staking will start playing a much larger role in the cryptocurrency space.\u201d\n\nSome cryptocurrency exchanges have also spotted opportunities to expand their staking products. For example, Singapore-based crypto exchange Bybit last month launched a new staking pool in time for the Shanghai upgrade.\n\n\u201cThe highly liquid and trading-integrated ETH staking options we will be rolling out around the time of Ethereum\u2019s Shanghai upgrade will open up many new opportunities for our users,\u201d Ben Zhou, chief executive officer of Bybit, said in a March statement.\n\nSee related article: What impact will Ethereum\u2019s Shanghai upgrade have on ETH and crypto markets?"
