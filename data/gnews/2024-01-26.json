        "content": "The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has again delayed issuing a decision on Grayscale\u2019s application to launch a spot Ethereum (ETH) ETF.\n\nAccording to a message on the regulator\u2019s website, the Commission requested public comments on how the regulator should handle Grayscale\u2019s application. The SEC is interested in whether the ETH algorithm \u2013 Proof-of-Stake (PoS) and the concentration of a large volume of Ethereum in the hands of several individuals could make the fund vulnerable to fraud and manipulation.\n\nThe next application deadline is in May. The company first applied to launch a spot Ethereum ETF in October 2023. The SEC published its first decision on the application on Dec. 5, 2023. The deadline was January 25, 2024.\n\nIn addition to the application for a spot Ethereum ETF from Grayscale, the Commission previously extended the consideration of applications from Fidelity and BlackRock. The new deadline for the other two applications will be in March.\n\nAt the same time, journalists predict the adoption of spot Ethereum-ETFs by the summer of 2024. This will be preceded by a decision by the CFTC and the SEC to recognize that the second-largest cryptocurrency by capitalization does not comply with a security status.\n\nReporting on the timeline for a potential $ETH ETF approval has turned up a plethora of different takes from ETF issuers, investment management firms and sources close to the @SECGov.\n\n\n\n\u2728One $BTC Spot ETF issuer with an ETH Spot ETF application says they\u2019re confident the\u2026 \u2014 Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) January 23, 2024\n\nJournalists suggested that such certainty could arise during the trial with Binance. They referred to the previous meeting, noting that DAO tokens can be considered securities.\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "content": "Ethereum price is attempting a recovery wave above the $2,200 zone. ETH could start a decent increase if it settles above the $2,240 resistance.\n\nEthereum started an upside correction from the $2,165 zone.\n\nThe price is trading below $2,250 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere is a short-term bearish trend line forming with resistance near $2,225 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair might start a decent increase if it clears the $2,240 resistance zone.\n\nEthereum Price Eyes Recovery\n\nEthereum price managed to form a support base above the $2,165 level. ETH seems to be consolidating losses near the $2,200 level and might aim for a recovery wave, like Bitcoin.\n\nThere was a minor upside correction above the $2,200 level, but the bears are still active near the $2,240 resistance zone. There is also a short-term bearish trend line forming with resistance near $2,225 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.\n\nEthereum is now trading below $2,250 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the first major resistance is near the $2,240 level. It is close to the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the key drop from the $2,480 swing high to the $2,165 low.\n\nThe next major resistance is near the $2,280 or the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average, above which the price might rise and test the 50% Fib retracement level of the key drop from the $2,480 swing high to the $2,165 low. If the bulls push the price above the $2,320 resistance, they could aim for $2,360.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nA clear move above the $2,360 level might start a decent increase. In the stated case, the price could rise toward the $2,420 level. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2,500 zone.\n\nAnother Failure in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $2,240 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,200 level.\n\nThe next key support could be the $2,165 zone. A daily close below the $2,165 support might start another major decline. In the stated case, Ether could test the $2,080 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,000 level.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bearish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now above the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $2,165\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $2,240\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "Could a forthcoming Ethereum upgrade boost Ether's price? A recent study says yes - DLNews",
        "content": "The price of Ether is seen to increase in the weeks before major upgrades.\n\nA small group of contributors holds significant influence over key decisions regarding Ethereum Improvement Proposals.\n\nThe increase in Ether's price is most significant in the weeks before final discussions regarding EIPs.\n\nEthereum\u2019s governance decisions have emerged as an underappreciated influence on prices of Ether.\n\nA recent study by a trio of academics shed light on this relationship, particularly regarding EIPs, or Ethereum Improvement Proposals.\n\nAn Ethereum Improvement Proposal is a formal document suggesting new features or changes to the Ethereum blockchain that serves as a guideline for community consensus.\n\nThe study, focusing on Ethereum\u2019s decision-making process, uncovered a striking trend. In the periods leading up to final discussions of Core EIPs, Ether\u2019s price increased about 18%, and relative to Bitcoin it increased 12%.\n\nStay ahead of the game with our weekly newsletters Subscribe\n\nThe research also examined the concentration of power in Ethereum\u2019s governance, and found that a small group of developers and influencers hold significant sway over the EIP process.\n\nThe next major Ethereum upgrade, Dencun, which is expected to reduce the cost of transactions on layer 2s, is on track to launch in late February.\n\nEthereum developers will run through tests for Dencun on the Sepolia and Holesky testnets on January 30 and February 7.\n\nThe authors of the study were Cesare Fracassi and Moazzam Khoja at the University of Texas at Austin, and Fabian Sch\u00e4r at the University of Basel. The paper has yet to go through the academic peer-review process.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nData speaks volumes\n\nThe study analysed Ether\u2019s price trends during the final discussions and approvals of successful Core EIPs, looking at hourly price data from May 2016 to November 2023.\n\nOne of the most important findings was the 18% increase in Ether prices in the weeks preceding the last AllCoreDevs call before a major EIP.\n\nAn AllCoreDevs call is a regular meeting when Ethereum\u2019s core developers discuss and make decisions on EIPs.\n\nThis surge in prices was seen to reflect investors\u2019 evolving expectations about the likelihood of a proposal\u2019s approval, and its potential impact on the token\u2019s value.\n\nTo ensure an accurate analysis, the researchers focused on a specific period of 80 days, split equally before and after these meetings.\n\nEther\u2019s price began to increase, the study found, about 30 days before the crucial discussions.\n\nA clear pattern was also seen when comparing Ether with Bitcoin.\n\nIn the 25 days leading up to the approval of a Core EIP, Ether\u2019s price against Bitcoin typically increased by about 12%, showing that Ether\u2019s price does tend to increase significantly in anticipation of major changes to the Ethereum network.\n\nSuch increases are particularly significant considering the concentrated governance structure where a small group holds substantial influence over key decisions.\n\nFor example, an average of 10 people per client implementation \u2014 each client being a different version of software that runs the Ethereum protocol \u2014 are responsible for 80% of all software changes.\n\nWhen comparing Ether\u2019s performance with the S&P 500, its price movements didn\u2019t always align with the stock market trends, showing that factors influencing Ether are different from those driving the markets.\n\nFor market participants, from casual investors to institutional traders, these insights may offer some potentially valuable perspectives on how governance-related events can be crucial indicators for investment strategies.\n\nFor the Ethereum community and developers, the data highlights the impact their decisions have, not just on the network\u2019s technical trajectory, but on its financial ecosystem as well.\n\nEther's price performance for the last 30 days.\n\nEther\u2019s price is $2,270, up 3.7% on the day, after falling 16% from its yearly high of $2,700 on January 12.\n\nThe Dencun upgrade is about one month away from being finalised, which according to the study, should coincide with an increase in Ether\u2019s price."

        "title": "When Will Our Forecasted Price Of $10,000 Ethereum Be Hit? - Investing Haven",
        "content": "Ethereum is the cornerstone of decentralized finance and the second-largest coin by market cap. Currently trading above $2,000, the price of ETH would need 5x before it hits $10,000.\n\nSee Related: 2024 Is A Hidden Crypto Bull Market\n\nIt\u2019s important to understand that our ETH to $10,000 forecast is based on charting analysis and not minor news, that is often irrelevant to price increases. Such news is usually helpful when taken into account with other information to provide a more accurate context/backdrop.\n\nWe use charts to back up all statements, separating us from typical crypto media and online headlines.\n\nWelcome in the magic world of price forecasting. We will guide you in how we think about our Ethereum price prediction, particularly how we get to an answer to the when can ETH go to $10,000 question.\n\nMaking accurate forecasts on the price of ETH\n\nTime and time again, it has been proven that fundamental news information is not correlated to short or even medium-term price increases in the Web3 space. It does not matter how many partnerships a network signs or what upgrades have taken place \u2013 the token will rise or fall along with the wider market.\n\nSuch information is useful mainly in terms of project longevity \u2013 it\u2019s less likely to go out of business with strong fundamentals. It\u2019s relevant primarily when taken in a much broader context of charting analysis and the wider crypto economy. However, many \u201canalysts\u201d will use standalone fundamental news to make unsubstantiated claims about the price of ETH. A classic example would be Ethereum\u2019s Merge, which did next to nothing regarding its price:\n\nETH to $10,000 after the Merge? Discounted cash flow models are estimating this. If you're stacking ETH for the Merge, you should be earning passively from it too. Top 5 ETH yield strategies \ud83e\uddf5\ud83d\udc47 \u2014 Ross Booth (@therossbooth) March 31, 2022\n\nEthereum\u2019s \u2018buy the rumor, sell the news\u2019 moment\n\nThe price of ETH actually dropped after the Merge. While the upgrade was undoubtedly an excellent technical advance for Ethereum\u2018s ecosystem, this will only have a long-term price effect. But the financial trading markets, driven by those looking to make huge returns in a short space of time, are often not concerned with long-term rewards.\n\nIt\u2019s quite simple. Just like in other markets, fundamental news is great for long-term investors who can wait for longer time horizons (2 \u2013 5 years). Executing a trade based on fundamental news and expecting price increases in the near term makes little sense. And regarding Ethereum, we already know it has rock-solid fundamentals, as the home of DeFi. The skill lies in knowing if the fundamentals are already priced into the token.\n\nEthereum charts to the rescue\n\nWhile fundamental information is useful to a degree, it\u2019s the charts that really help when dealing with accurate price predictions. Fundamental news information can also be useful because it indicates where people will be misled. For instance, with all eyes on BTC spot approval pushing up the price of BTC, we knew it was practically exhausted, and placed our attention on ETH.\n\nStated differently, fundamentals alone will not help in understanding whether ETH can go to $10,000. Moreover, the question WHEN can ETH go to $10,000 cannot be answered without decent chart analysis.\n\nWe have 3 ETH charts that paint a clear picture, and tell a great story.\n\nETH daily price chart\n\nFirst, the daily ETH chart which exhibits retracement levels. These retracement levels, represented by different colors on our chart, are important because they create one logic structure. The structure we are talking about is the the big drop (correction) since ETH hit its ATH.\n\nThe point with this retracement analysis is that it helps you understand when the long consolidation, otherwise boring, is entering a bullish period.\n\nAs seen below, in this long and boring consolidation, price is moving above the critical 50% retracement level. This is critical. Why? Because readings above the 50% retracement level are turning the consolidation into a bullish setup (more confirmation is needed before getting very bullish but it\u2019s getting potentially very interesting for investors).\n\nA similar but very different ETH daily chart\n\nNow here is some magic that comes from our top charting team. We take the exact same chart, switch from a horizontal chart view (retracement levels) to a chart pattern view. Suddenly, the colored chart above turns into a dynamic chart exhibiting trends, see below.\n\nThis view of the ETH chart looks extremely promising, to say the least. Suddenly, the $10,000 price forecast for ETH is not such a crazy idea, on the contrary. What clearly stands out from the chart shown below is that $3,525.50 plays a pivotal role in Ethereum\u2019s price evolution. That\u2019s because $3,525.50 is a pivotal price point on ETH\u2019s chart: once above this level, an accelerated uptrend should start. Stated differently, below $3,525.50 the uptrend will be rather soft. In that case, we should not expect those big rallies we have seen in 2017 or 2020.\n\nWeekly ETH chart confirms $10,000 target\n\nAs an investor it is important to take a top-down view. In practical terms, it means that we always should check both the weekly and the daily charts, always. This certainly applies when forecasting the price of a token.\n\nIf we want to know whether ETH can go to $10,000, we must check daily and weekly timeframes.\n\nWhile the daily charts, above, painted a very bullish picture, we must seek confirmation on the longer timeframe.\n\nLuckily, the weekly chart indicates a bullish pattern: a rounded reversal. That\u2019s a bullish pattern provided key support levels hold.\n\nWhat may sound counter-intuitive, especially to the \u2018instant pump\u2019 crowd, is that this consolidation needs to continue for a lot longer before getting strongly bullish.\n\nWhat we are saying is that serious ETH investors would hope for the following to occur:\n\nSupport levels to hold (think 2022 and 2023 lows).\n\nThe rounded pattern to further mature below $3,525.50 in 2024.\n\nIn doing so, create a W-structure.\n\nThis, ultimately, would make for the perfect setup on this weekly ETH chart to move to our forecasted $10,000 ETH target in 2025. In other words, the longer the consolidation, the better, as the result on the weekly timeframe would result in a stronger bullish reversal.\n\nETH to $10,000 \u2013 chart conclusion\n\nThe good news from our charting analysis team is that the acceleration of the uptrend will start around $3525. We expect this to occur in 2025. When it does, it\u2019s a more reasonable 3x increase to $10,000.\n\nThe weekly view also confirms a price rise acceleration to $10,000 in 2025 is perfectly possible, consistent with the daily chart.\n\nMUST READ \u2013 Crypto Markets Almost Ready For Alt Season 2024. Are You?\n\nThe price of ETH in 2024\n\nThis year, the price of ETH could hit between $3,000 \u2013 $4,000, with $3,000 the more realistic estimate. Despite a current freefall in the markets and the rising popularity of Solana-based coins, we\u2019re still very bullish on Ethereum throughout the course of the year. We accurately predicted the current Bitcoin price fall after the overhyped Bitcoin ETF approval and significant bullish momentum.\n\nWe can stick with our estimate that Bitcoin, and Ethereum, could hit all-time highs in 2024. The market is simply clearing house of those who bought at the high and will now sell at the low. There are many discounted coins available at the present time.\n\nOur premium charting service can instantly reveal which ones offer the best ROI. We called many winners in 2023 such as Fetch.ai, Ocean, Render Token, Stargate Finance, Metis Dao, and more.\n\nEthereum price of $10,000 still stands\n\nIn sum, the price of Ethereum could easily rise to $10,000. This will most likely occur in 2025. The level to reach is $3,525. Throughout 2024, the price of ETH will likely move to $3,000 \u2013 $4,000. First, we have to get out of the current bear cycle, consolidate, and push upwards.\n\nThe only point of concern would be a black swan event that pushed ETH below $1,300, in which case estimates would need to be revised. But this is a low-probability event.\n\nEthereum is still up 35% on a yearly basis at the time of this writing, trading around $1,600 at the beginning of 2023.\n\nDisclaimer: This is not financial advice.

Furthermore, 84% of these brands are reported to share or sell this personal data, with 56% potentially sharing it with government agencies upon request.\n\nThis alarming level of data collection and sharing has raised significant privacy concerns among experts and consumers alike.\n\nTechnology and privacy\n\nButerin's post has sparked a discussion on social media about the balance between technological advancements and privacy.\n\nSome users express interest in retrofitting classic cars to avoid modern privacy issues while others accuse Buterin of being a technology denier.\n\nHowever, Buterin clarifies his stance, stating that he supports various modern technologies, including certain AI applications, but he maintains a critical view of specific technologies that pose privacy risks. \"There's a small-but-important subset of things I worry about!\" he stressed."

        "content": "Spot ether ETFs have roughly a 60% chance of being approved in May, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffart.\n\nEarlier this week, the Securities and Exchange Commission delayed decisions on the potential BlackRock and Grayscale ether ETFs. Alongside BlackRock and Grayscale, Ark 21Shares and VanEck are also in the running for a spot ether ETF.\n\nThe delays were not surprising, according to experts who expect the SEC to put off a decision on the ETFs until later this year. The SEC, earlier this month, approved a slew of bitcoin ETFs.\n\nRead more: Race for a spot ether ETF begins with bid from Ark Invest, 21Shares\n\nSeyffart is eyeing May 23 as the next date to watch in the spot ether saga. May 23 marks the 240-day window for the SEC to decide on proposals from Ark/21Shares and VanEck.\n\n\u201cMy base case is still probably around 60-ish percent that they\u2019ll approve them\u201d around that date, he told Blockworks. \u201cBut there\u2019s plenty of ways they can delay.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo if the SEC wants to get geared up and ready to go and wants everyone to go at the same time, they\u2019ll likely do it on May 23 unless they can figure out some way to deny or delay this whole process and do what they want,\u201d he continued.\n\nIf a May approval doesn\u2019t pan out, then Seyffart plans to watch 2025.\n\nGrayscale is taking a similar approach to its bitcoin ETF by trying to convert the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) into an ETF.\n\nThe company\u2019s Chief Legal Officer Craig Salm said in a radio interview that the firm is looking at summer 2024 for an SEC decision.\n\n\u201cThat clock will come due sometime this summer,\u201d he said.\n\nRead more: After spot bitcoin ETF approval, eyes shift to ether fund decision\n\nIts application for a bitcoin ETF was initially denied which led the firm to file an appeal. Back in August, a panel of judges sided with Grayscale, leaving the SEC to reconsider the application.\n\n\u201cThis ruling opened the floodgates for BTC, so to speak. And also put the SEC in a logical pretzel,\u201d Van Buren Capital general partner Scott Johnsson said.\n\nFast forward to January, and Grayscale was one of nearly a dozen firms approved to launch. It is also the fund with the highest number of outflows since the ETFs went live earlier this month.\n\nJohnsson further gave his insights on the possible ETH ETF roadmap in a post on X Thursday.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nHe noted that there\u2019s a lot of \u201cnuance right now,\u201d but he expects that, in the long term, \u201cETH spot is almost guaranteed.\u201d\n\nHowever, the SEC can choose to ask potential issuers to pull their applications or issue denials when the May deadlines come around. If the SEC were to ask Ark/21Shares or VanEck to withdraw then it\u2019s a \u201cgood indication that the SEC is going to approve these,\u201d Seyffart said.\n\n\u201cThe SEC might just need more time to get up to speed with Ethereum versus Bitcoin,\u201d he added, noting how different the two are.\n\nCaution, Johnsson said, \u201cis warranted in assuming spot ETF approval.\u201d\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nJohnsson believes that the existence of ether futures ETFs is a bright spot for the potential green light, having seen that the SEC approved the bitcoin ETFs partially on that basis.\n\nSeyffart added that the SEC could say that the futures market isn\u2019t \u201clarge enough or liquid enough or impactful enough\u201d when looking at spot ether ETFs.\n\nBut, as May approaches, there should be clues that \u201cinform\u201d the public as to what the SEC is thinking.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a few different things that we can look to to get a feel for what\u2019s going on that we don\u2019t have yet, and I wouldn\u2019t expect us to have it for some time. Perhaps another month or two,\u201d Seyffart said. These things include filings and responses from both the issuers and the SEC.\n\n\u201cIt would certainly not surprise me if the SEC decided to avoid the [DC Circuit] at all costs and simply issued approval,\u201d Johnsson said in a post on X.\n\nSEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, in an interview earlier this week, said that the SEC \u201cshouldn\u2019t need a court to tell us that our approach is arbitrary and capricious in order for us to get it right.\u201d\n\nShe added that the SEC will \u201capply precedent\u201d to spot ether decisions.\n\nCurrently, Seyffart told Blockworks, the process for spot ETH approval reminds him of July of last year. Around that time, BlackRock and other issuers were about a month into the spot bitcoin ETF race and the Grayscale decision had yet to be issued.\n\n\u201cI know the timeline isn\u2019t exactly lining up that way, but what we know and what we don\u2019t know are kind of in the same boat,\u201d he said.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "Michael van de Poppe, a prominent crypto analyst, recently outlined three key factors that could herald a bullish phase for Ethereum, the second-largest crypto by market capitalization. One crucial factor he identifies is Bitcoin\u2019s current behavior.\n\nThe analyst pointed out that as the market leader, Bitcoin\u2019s recent signs of bottoming out tend to precede altcoin rallies, hinting at a potential upswing for Ethereum. Moreover, Van de Poppe highlights the growing anticipation surrounding spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\n\nAccording to Van de Poppe, the increasing buzz about these spot ETFs is a significant catalyst that could drive Ethereum\u2019s value over the coming weeks.\n\nAdditionally, Ethereum is on the cusp of rolling out critical network upgrades. These updates, aimed at reducing transaction costs by up to 90%, are expected to improve the network\u2019s efficiency and scalability significantly.\n\nThe momentum towards $ETH is probably going to come in the next few weeks. Arguments:\n\n\u2013 #Bitcoin bottoming out is a trigger for altcoins to make a new run.\n\n\u2013 Ethereum Spot ETF hype.\n\n\u2013 Ethereum launching new upgrades to reduce 90% of the costs. pic.twitter.com/N8bDi52F8M \u2014 Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) January 25, 2024\n\nLatest Update On Ethereum Deacon Upgrade\n\nRegarding updates, Ethereum\u2019s development team is making strides with the upcoming Dencun upgrade, a significant \u201chard fork\u201d that aims to enhance the blockchain\u2019s efficiency.\n\nTim Beiko, a core Ethereum developer, updated the community earlier today on the progress. Dencun, which incorporates \u201cproto-danksharding,\u201d is set to reduce transaction costs on layer 2 solutions, making Ethereum more accessible and affordable for users.\n\nAccording to the developer, the upgrade is scheduled to activate on the Sepolia testnet on January 30 and the Holesky testnet on February 7, with mainnet implementation following if these tests succeed.\n\nMore testnet blobs on the way .oO Dencun will activate on Sepolia Jan 30, and on Holesky Feb 7. If running a node on either network, now\u2019s the time to update it! Assuming both of these go smoothly, mainnet is next \u2705https://t.co/QbEUACix2S \u2014 timbeiko.eth \u2600\ufe0f (@TimBeiko) January 25, 2024\n\nBrighter Future Ahead\n\nDespite these positive developments, Ethereum\u2019s market performance mirrors the overall bearish sentiment in the crypto market, led by Bitcoin. ETH has seen a 13.7% decline in the past week, currently trading at $2,216.\n\nHowever, analysts like Van de Poppe urge caution, particularly regarding the impact of the Bitcoin spot ETF. While there may be short-term selling pressure, Van de Poppe remains optimistic about the long-term prospects.\n\nThe analyst suggests that the influx of new capital from diverse market participants could propel Bitcoin, and by extension, Ethereum, to new heights.\n\nThe markets need to be more accurate with the impact of the ETF. There\u2019s some selling pressure in the short term, but in the long term, a massive amount of new money flows into the markets from new participants. As a result, #Bitcoin might push higher this cycle than we think. \u2014 Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) January 25, 2024\n\nFeatured image from Unsplash, Chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nThe deadline for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to approve a spot ether (ETH) exchange-traded fund (ETF) is just months away, and analysts are divided on the odds of the regulator greenlighting such a product.\n\nLegal experts Jake Chervinsky and Scott Johnsson have cast doubt on the likelihood of a positive outcome.\n\n\"Many people seem to assume that because the SEC gave up fighting against the spot BTC ETF, they\u2019ll do the same on ETH. I\u2019m not sure,\" Chervinsky said on the X social media platform.\n\nRegulatory hurdles\n\nScott Johnsson cautioned investors to prepare for the possibility of the ETF's disapproval.\n\nAccording to Johnsson, the SEC might require consistent correlation across the entire 2.5-year sample period to satisfy the requirements of section 6(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act.\n\nThis stance, while potentially frustrating for proponents of the ETF, is not seen as unreasonable or capricious by Johnsson.\n\nHe also argues that approval is more likely in the following year, making an appeal less attractive and portraying the SEC in a constructive light. \"And more importantly, why would someone appeal such a tough argument when they know with high certainty it will be approved before their appeal is decided,\" he wrote.\n\nThis perspective was further discussed on X, with users debating the arbitrariness of the 2.5-year period and the prospects of an eventual approval.\n\nEarlier this week, the SEC postponed its decision on the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF until March.\n\nDiverging views on approval odds\n\nContrasting opinions have emerged regarding the approval odds for the spot ether ETF. A recent report by JPMorgan gave the ETF no more than a 50% chance of approval by May, citing ongoing lawsuits against crypto exchanges offering staking services for proof-of-stake blockchains, including Ethereum.\n\nThis legal uncertainty adds complexity to the SEC\u2019s decision-making process. On the other hand, Bloomberg Intelligence Senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas initially estimated a 70% chance of approval this year, with his colleague James Seyffart offering a slightly more cautious outlook of 60-65%.\n\nSeyffart acknowledges the existence of strong arguments both for and against the ETF's approval, indicating a less confident stance compared to previous Bitcoin ETF approvals."

        "content": "Flipsides say the ongoing demand for economical alternatives to Ethereum, will drive more layer-2 projects to prioritize reducing end-user costs this year.\n\nEthereum is set to confront heightened competition in the blockchain space in 2024, driven by the persistent demand for cost-effective alternatives and the proliferation of Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible layer-2 networks, Flipside, a blockchain data platform, said in a recent research report.\n\nIs the bull is really here? How can we tell?\n\n\n\nData.\n\n\n\nSentiment isn't the only thing that's changed lately. According to the data, user behavior is shifting \u2014 and with it, crypto markets.\n\n\n\nWe cover it all in The Onchain Crypto User Report \ud83e\uddf5\ud83d\udcca\ud83d\udc47 pic.twitter.com/IsclNOZhJk \u2014 Flipside \ud83d\udcca (@flipsidecrypto) January 25, 2024\n\nAs per analysts, a substantial portion of EVM users are now actively exploring alternative options to Ethereum due to the allure of lower fees and faster transactions offered by emerging layer-2 solutions. The significance of this shift is underscored by historical patterns, where past bull runs fueled by Ethereum-based protocols resulted in soaring transaction costs.\n\n\u201cThe continued need for cost-effective alternatives to Ethereum, plus the growing number of EVM-compatible layer-2s, will pressure more layer-2 projects to focus on lowering end user costs.\u201d Flipside\n\nYou might also like: SEC delays Grayscale spot Ethereum ETF to May\n\nThe competitive landscape is further shaped by a growing number of EVM-compatible layer-2 networks, compelling layer-2 projects to pivot towards prioritizing cost reduction for end users. As part of this evolution, governance tokens of layer-2 networks such as Optimism (OP), Arbitrum (ARB), and Polygon (POL) are gaining renewed attention.\n\n\u201cThe ability of these governance tokens to impact each network\u2019s competitive advantage will play a central role in the layer-2 narrative.\u201d Flipside\n\nAdding to the dynamics, Ethereum\u2019s planned Dencun upgrade, featuring a new feature known as \u201cblobs\u201d that will allow storing large pieces of data on Ethereum blocks through EIP-4844, is anticipated to amplify the competition. Flipside says blobs will enhance block space on the mainnet and boost throughput for layer-2 networks, further challenging Ethereum\u2019s dominant position.\n\nAnalysts at Mike Novogratz\u2019s crypto bank, Galaxy Digital, echo a parallel sentiment, foreseeing a pivotal 2024 for Ethereum amid increasing stakes raised by other layer-1 blockchains.\n\nGalaxy Digital highlights Ethereum\u2019s modular architecture, specifically diverse rollup types, as a source of potential challenges and technological risks due to their early developmental stage. Singling out Solana as the primary contender with its distinctive monolithic architecture, Galaxy Digital positions it as the main competitor against Ethereum this year.\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "content": "A crypto analyst, Elja on X, predicts that Ethereum (ETH) will reach a staggering $15,000 by 2025 based on technical analysis. The analyst argues that the current bearish sentiment in the crypto market is \u201ctemporary.\u201d\n\nMoreover, Elja notes that the second most valuable coin by market cap follows a similar fractal pattern that fueled its previous major price rally in 2021.\n\nIs Ethereum Ready To Rip Despite The Current Consolidation?\n\nSharing a screen grab of the current ETH price action, Elja says most people in crypto are \u201cshort-sighted\u201d and only focus on immediate price movements. In the analyst\u2019s assessment, traders should look at the long-term to understand the overall price pattern.\n\nThus far, Ethereum, like Bitcoin (BTC), remains under pressure and struggling to break above immediate resistance levels. Looking at the development in the daily chart, ETH is back at a critical support level of around $2,200. Notably, the coin is down 20% from January 2024 highs of about $2,700.\n\nETH is under pressure, at least in the short to medium term. As it is, the coin follows the technical candlestick arrangement visible in Bitcoin.\n\nThe altcoin downtrend appears to have been triggered by events following the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). As an illustration, Bitcoin fell from around $47,000 to below $40,000 this week, weighing down altcoins, including Ethereum.\n\nOn-chain data shows that Grayscale Investments has been unloading thousands of coins behind Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). Subsequently, there has been a sell-off in Bitcoin and across the altcoin scene. The situation has been made worse for Ethereum following the United States SEC\u2019s decision to postpone the approval of spot Ethereum ETFs.\n\nWhile these developments have negatively impacted sentiment, Elja believes they will not derail Ethereum\u2019s long-term growth trajectory. Specifically, the analyst notes that ETH is consolidating, a \u201chealthy sign.\u201d\n\nETH To $15,000: Will Fundamental And Technical Factors Help?\n\nElja added that when crypto prices consolidate, it could suggest that whales are accumulating their position. Once this ends, ETH prices could trend higher. From the analyst\u2019s chart, the coin will break above $5,000 to $15,000 in the coming sessions.\n\nWhen making this prediction, the analyst compared the Ethereum price action to the fractal pattern that propelled ETH from around $200 to $4,800 in 15 months from 2019 to 2021. Extrapolating from past price action, Elja believes Ethereum is on a similar path. Based on analysis, the coin will likely break above November 2021 peaks.\n\nBeyond technical factors, ETH supporters cite the decreasing issuance rate. According to Ultrasound Money data, the network has been burning thousands of ETH, reducing supply. Additionally, Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock, believes Ethereum will be the choice network for tokenizing real-world assets (RWAs) in the years ahead.\n\nFeature image from Canva, chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nThe cryptocurrency market is witnessing a strong bullish momentum as Bitcoin and Ethereum bulls start to assert control. In a significant development, shorts worth approximately $60 million have been liquidated, signaling a potential shift in market sentiment as we approach the weekend.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnalyzing the current charts, Bitcoin has demonstrated resilience, managing to sustain above the crucial support level of $40,000. The coin has recently experienced a rebound from this level, which has historically acted as a strong psychological barrier for both bulls and bears.\n\nIf BTC maintains its position above this support, the next key resistance to watch will be around $42,000, a level where we might expect some consolidation before a further push. On the downside, if the $40,000 level fails to hold, traders should look for potential support near the $38,500 region.\n\nEthereum, on the other hand, is also showing signs of recovery after a recent sell-off. The coin has found support near the $2,100 mark, just above the 200-day exponential moving average, which is often considered a significant indicator of long-term trends.\n\nIf ETH can sustain this rebound, the immediate resistance is expected at $2,400. A breakthrough above this could open the path toward $2,500, a level that previously acted as both support and resistance. A fall below the current support level could see the price testing the next support zone around $2,000.\n\nThe liquidation heatmap provides additional context, illustrating the pressure on short sellers as the market moves against their positions. This liquidation is particularly evident in the case of Bitcoin and Ethereum, which have seen a significant number of short positions being closed in a short span of time. Overall, the market is currently displaying bullish signs, with strong support levels holding up."

        "title": "Beware the crypto bull run predictions in 2024 - Fortune",
        "content": "Aside from the high-profile court cases, much of 2023 was a fairly lackluster year for crypto. Market activity remained mostly flat compared to the historical average. Major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) traded sideways all year, and total volume locked (TVL) in decentralized finance ecosystems drifted within a narrow range, far below all-time highs. This lack of dramatic volatility was far from the norm we usually associate with crypto assets. The minor pricing pump in Q4 closed out the year on a positive note.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a year for making money. But the recent green light from the Securities and Exchange Commission for 11 Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) applications, featuring heavyweight players such as BlackRock, Ark Investments/21Shares, Fidelity, Invesco, and VanEck has led to a notable upswing in the crypto market, expressing optimistic outlook. Speculation is rife that a sustained bull run will replace this latest crypto winter.\n\nWhile I remain bullish on digital assets and the wider crypto industry on a long-term horizon, there\u2019s reason to remain cautious going into 2024. Investors face mixed signals, and it\u2019s possible the good news regarding Bitcoin ETF approval\u2013which has been leading crypto headlines for some months\u2013has already been priced in.\n\nWhile markets didn\u2019t skyrocket last year, they also didn\u2019t crater. There has been sufficient optimism to maintain pricing stability. That optimism is largely related to two major events in 2024: the recent approval of spot Bitcoin ETF and the potential approval of Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S., as well as the upcoming Bitcoin halving. The ETF approvals are expected to bring improved trading volumes and liquidity to crypto markets in general, and the halving will prevent BTC deflation and thus support prices.\n\nMany pundits have attributed the Q4 pricing pump to these factors, and that\u2019s been coupled with bullish activity in the derivatives market as well. Investors overall appear to believe that central bank rate hikes are mostly behind us and that there\u2019s enough weight to these optimistic murmurings to look forward to a breakout bull run in 2024.\n\nDespite the undeniably positive impact of institutional endorsements and the market sentiment reflected by the recent pricing upswing, I believe there is some truth to the Wall Street saying \u201cbuy the rumor, sell the news\u201d here. The crypto market is forward-looking, and traders who have already bought the rumor might be waiting to sell regardless of what the news is.\n\nAfter the initial surge on the back of the highly anticipated news, markets may quickly pare those gains as wider adoption fails to keep pace. A subsequent correction could take place before an actual bull run begins. ETFs are a big step\u2013but not nearly enough to declare we\u2019ve achieved mass crypto adoption. While the approval of Bitcoin spot ETFs is a big win, I won\u2019t be holding my breath for new all-time highs for crypto asset prices or total value locked (TVL) in the short run.\n\nAs for BTC\u2019s halving in Q2, it will support markets but it\u2019s unlikely to drive a full-fledged bull run. This anti-inflationary measure makes mining new BTC more difficult, restricting supply. In the absence of significant crypto adoption, this alone isn\u2019t enough to take us back to BTC\u2019s peak of nearly $69,000, let alone surpass it.\n\nOn the other hand, an additional reason for optimism is the fact that 2024 is an election year in the U.S. We can expect U.S. regulators to tone down their headline-seeking activities in this high-stakes year. As such, there ought to be less bad news on the horizon for crypto that has the potential to dent investors\u2019 enthusiasm. This can possibly set the stage for the next bullish trend.\n\nAll in all (and Black Swan events aside), 2024 is shaping up to be more of the same for crypto asset prices. My base case scenario is that the market will bottom out and begin recovering more meaningfully by Q4 2024. In the meantime, we can expect some minor volatility as investors whiplash from heady anticipation to mild disappointment.\n\nHowever, the overall relative lack of volatility indicates that the crypto finance market is maturing, and thus our investment and trading strategies must mature as well.\n\nRachel Lin is a co-founder and CEO of SynFutures, a decentralized derivatives trading platform.\n\nMore must-read commentary published by Fortune:\n\nThe opinions expressed in Fortune.com commentary pieces are solely the views of their authors and do not necessarily reflect the opinions and beliefs of Fortune."

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s blockchain is on the brink of a transformation with the impending Dencun upgrade. Scheduled for a late February or early March release on the mainnet, this upgrade is poised to revolutionize Ethereum\u2019s transaction framework. Developers have scheduled critical tests on the Sepolia and Holesky testnets on January 30 and February 7, respectively, marking the final steps before the upgrade goes live.\n\nPrevious Testnet Hiccups and Forward Momentum\n\nDespite experiencing minor setbacks during its implementation on the Goerli testnet, the Dencun upgrade showed resilience. A bug in Prysm nodes caused a delay in finalization but was swiftly rectified. This hiccup did not deter the progress, as the Ethereum community remains focused on enhancing the blockchain\u2019s efficiency and scalability.\n\nadvertisement\n\nProto-Danksharding\n\nAt the core of Dencun lies the proto-danksharding feature, a technical innovation designed to drastically lower transaction costs on layer 2s and provide more affordable data storage on the blockchain. This development is not just a step forward for Ethereum but a potential game-changer for the entire blockchain ecosystem.\n\nThe Dencun upgrade, as a result, is a technical milestone and a potential catalyst for Ethereum\u2019s market performance. Historically, significant upgrades have led to notable shifts in Ether\u2019s (ETH) market value. For instance, following the Shapella upgrade last March, ETH\u2019s price saw a substantial uptick.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Market Response to Upgrade Developments\n\nIn anticipation of the Dencun upgrade, Ethereum\u2019s market behavior has exhibited noteworthy trends. The cryptocurrency has seen a fluctuating trajectory, with its price rallying significantly before the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States, only to soften in the subsequent weeks. However, Ethereum has outperformed Bitcoin in several key aspects, as on-chain analytics firm Glassnode reported.\n\nGlassnode\u2019s analysis reveals that Ethereum has surpassed Bitcoin in quarterly, monthly, and weekly performance. The firm, moreover, points to a more than 20% increase in Ether\u2019s value against Bitcoin, coinciding with heightened activity in the ETH derivatives market. This outperformance, in addition, is underscored by Ethereum\u2019s growing market cap dominance, which has gained 2.9% compared to Bitcoin since the ETF approval.\n\nHowever, ETH traded at $2,211, a 0.34% at press time decline from the intraday high of $2,242.\n\nRead Also: Is It A Good Time To Buy Terra Luna Classic (LUNC) 30% Dip In A Month?"

However, according to a Celsius asset distribution FAQ updated on Jan. 12, a limited number of corporate accounts will be able to receive cryptocurrency through Coinbase.\n\nFor non-corporate accounts, distributions to creditors residing in the United States will be made via PayPal, and distributions to creditors outside of the U.S. will be made by Coinbase, it stated.\n\nA community of Celsius creditors on X (formerly Twitter), named \u201cCelsius NewCo Community,\u201d said they expect the distribution of liquid crypto to creditors to start in mid-February, adding that the distribution window will be open for one year.\n\nCelsius is aiming for an Effective Date of January 31st.\n\n\n\n\ufe0f We expect the distribution of liquid crypto to Earn Creditors to start in mid-February.\n\n\n\n\u23f3 The distribution window will be open for one year. pic.twitter.com/TznON0ddBV \u2014 Celsius NewCo Community (@CelsiusNewCo) January 25, 2024\n\nMeanwhile, Celsius user \u201cTheHawk\u201d reported that they had officially been able to remove all of their ETH from Celsius, adding that funds were in the custody account, not the Earn account.\n\nBetween Jan. 8 and 12, Celsius transferred another $95.5 million to Coinbase, while $29.7 million was transferred to FalconX, according to data from Arkham Intelligence.\n\nRelated: Celsius transfers $125M of ETH to exchanges as FTX and Alameda dump\n\nEarlier in the month, the bankrupt lending firm stated that it had begun shifting assets to \u201censure ample liquidity\u201d in preparation for any asset distributions.\n\nCelsius said it will unstake its existing Ether holdings to \u201coffset certain costs incurred throughout the restructuring process\u201d and \u201cunlock ETH to ensure timely distributions to creditors.\u201d It no longer has any ETH pending staking withdrawal, according to Nansen.\n\nOn Jan. 9, Celsius bankruptcy administrators filed an intent to notify its creditors that account holders who withdrew more than $100,000 in the 90 days before the date of the firm\u2019s bankruptcy declaration on July 13, 2022, may be required to return them by Jan. 31, 2024.\n\nETH prices have yet to react, remaining flat on the day at $2,225 at the time of writing.\n\nMagazine: Tiffany Fong flames Celsius, FTX and NY Post: Hall of Flame"

This move comes amidst similar delays for other proposed spot Ethereum funds from major players like BlackRock and Fidelity. The SEC\u2019s decision to seek further public input marks a significant moment in the ongoing debate over cryptocurrency-based investment products.\n\nConcerns Over Ethereum\u2019s Proof of Stake\n\nThe SEC\u2019s focus in this latest delay centers around Ethereum\u2019s transition to a proof of stake mechanism. The regulator is keen to understand whether this change could lead to potential issues of fraud and manipulation within the proposed fund.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe agency has openly questioned the concentration of control or influence by a few entities or individuals in Ethereum\u2019s network and its impact on the overall stability and security of the proposed ETF. These concerns underline the SEC\u2019s cautious approach to the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency market.\n\nWith the SEC setting a 21-day deadline for public comments and an additional 35 days for rebuttals, the crypto community is keenly awaiting further developments.\n\nThe prolonged timeline for a decision, extending beyond previous deadlines, has sparked varied reactions from industry experts. Some remain hopeful for a positive outcome, especially following the recent approval of spot bitcoin ETFs. However, SEC Chair Gary Gensler\u2019s recent comments suggest a more measured approach towards other crypto-linked exchange-traded products.\n\nExpert Opinions on Ethereum ETF\n\nAs the market anticipates the SEC\u2019s decision, opinions among crypto experts vary. Some are optimistic about a potential approval by May, drawing parallels with the recent approvals of spot bitcoin ETFs.\n\nOthers, however, remain skeptical, given the unique challenges and regulatory concerns surrounding Ethereum and its underlying technology. The consensus is a cautious optimism, with a recognition of the hurdles that lie ahead in gaining regulatory approval for such a novel financial product.\n\nRead Also: Ethereum\u2019s Dencun Upgrade Nears Mainnet Debut: Will ETH Rally?"

If ETH price fails to hold above this level, the altcoin could nosedive to its psychologically important level of $2,000, as seen in the chart below.\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nA daily candlestick close above the $2,232 level could invalidate the bearish thesis for Ethereum price."

        "content": "FxPro senior analyst Alex Kuptsikevicha projects Ethereum\u2019s price could further dip towards $2,000, as the altcoin is down by over 8% weekly.\n\nThe crypto market is experiencing a period of subdued volatility, with the total market capitalization hovering around $1.6 trillion for the third consecutive day. Simultaneously, equity indices in the stock market have also significantly declined in the past 24 hours.\n\nHowever, the impact on cryptocurrency investors has been minimal. Kuptsikevich thinks that the fall in stock values is seen more as a result of individual corporate stories rather than an indication of a global shift in market sentiment.\n\nBitcoin is benefiting from this consolidation phase, with its market share exceeding 50% once again. On the other hand, Ethereum has found itself at the lower end of the consolidation range, which it has been in for most of December. Kuptsikevich predicts that Ethereum is showing signs of possibly dropping to the $2,100 area, a level that marked the upper end of its November consolidation phase.\n\nETH 7-day market performance | Source: CoinMarketCap\n\nYou might also like: OKX shuts down mining pools after five years of operation\n\nKuptsikevich suggests that a further decline towards the $2,000 mark is possible, citing the cryptocurrency market\u2019s inherent volatility. This potential dip could mirror a similar retracement in Bitcoin to the $37,500 level.\n\nThe SEC has also delayed its decision on BlackRock\u2019s application for a spot Ethereum ETF until March 10. While some experts remain optimistic about the ETF\u2019s approval by May, with a probability of 50-to-70%, others are wary of regulatory resistance.\n\nThe introduction of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. has broadened the appeal of cryptocurrencies to a wider audience. According to the head of institutional at Coinbase, this marks a potential shift towards mainstream adoption of digital currencies.\n\nHowever, the influx of new capital into new cryptocurrencies is expected to be a gradual process, unfolding over months or even years.\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "content": "Bitcoin and Ethereum Price Prediction as Tesla Still Holds $380 Million BTC and Another ETH ETF Gets Delayed\n\nIn the ever-evolving landscape of cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (BTC) has recently reversed its downward trend, surpassing the significant $41,000 mark. This resurgence not only bolsters confidence in Bitcoin but also paves the way for other major cryptocurrencies like Ethereum (ETH), Dogecoin (DOGE), Solana (SOL), Ripple (XRP), and Litecoin (LTC), all of which have witnessed modest gains.\n\nThe overall crypto market cap now stands at an impressive $1.56 trillion, marking over 0.30% increase in the last 24 hours. This positive momentum in the crypto world is partly attributed to the burgeoning interest in Bitcoin ETFs, a development that underscores the cryptocurrency\u2019s growing acceptance in mainstream finance.\n\nConcurrently, Tesla\u2019s unwavering hold on $380 million worth of Bitcoin through Q4 2023 plays a critical role in shaping market sentiment, while the SEC\u2019s postponement of Grayscale and BlackRock\u2019s Ethereum ETFs introduces a layer of uncertainty in the ETH market.\n\nTesla\u2019s Q4 2023 Bitcoin Holdings: Influence on BTC Prices\n\n\n\nIn Q4 2023, Tesla\u2019s Bitcoin (BTC) holdings remained steady, as indicated in their recent earnings report released on Wednesday. The report didn\u2019t mention any Bitcoin transactions, suggesting no buying or selling during the quarter.\n\nCurrently valued at $387 million, Tesla owns approximately 9,720 BTC, ranking as the third-largest public holder after MicroStrategy and Marathon. Tesla initially invested $1.5 billion in Bitcoin in February 2021, acquiring around 43,000 BTC.\n\n\ud83d\ude97\ud83d\udd12 Tesla's #Bitcoin holdings stand strong at $184 million since Dec 2022, according to the Q4 2023 earnings report. \ud83d\udcca No new purchases or sales, marking a period of inactivity in their #Crypto journey.#Tesla currently ranks fourth among public companies with 10,500 $BTC. \ud83c\udf10\u2026 \u2014 Bitcoinbsc (@Bitcoinbsctoken) January 25, 2024\n\nDespite selling 75% of their holdings in Q2 2022 amid COVID uncertainties, the electric car giant continues to maintain a substantial Bitcoin reserve.\n\n$BTC holdings of Elon Musk's Tesla, worth nearly $387 million at current prices, remained unchanged in Q4 2023.https://t.co/lPfhWkK8jj \u2014 David odeyale (@odeyale_david) January 26, 2024\n\nTherefore, Tesla maintaining its Bitcoin holdings in Q4 2023 signals stability, impacting BTC price sentiment positively.

The SEC has been cautious about spot crypto ETFs, recently allowing only spot bitcoin ETFs in January. Therefore, the delay in deciding on Grayscale and BlackRock\u2019s applications is not unexpected.\n\nIn no surprise, the @SECgov has delayed decisions on spot #etherETF applications from Grayscale and BlackRock.https://t.co/hLt54lbv7m \u2014 CoinDesk (@CoinDesk) January 26, 2024\n\nThe filings raise questions about the similarities between spot Ethereum and spot bitcoin ETFs, addressing concerns like market manipulation and the size of the CME futures market. So, this echoes the SEC\u2019s previous inquiries about bitcoin.\n\nConsequently, the SEC\u2019s delay in approving spot ether ETFs from Grayscale and BlackRock has introduced uncertainty, potentially impacting Ethereum\u2019s price. Market participants keenly await regulatory decisions, as approval could positively influence ETH\u2019s value, while continued delays may introduce volatility.\n\nBitcoin Price Prediction"

While the bug was fixed quickly, it raised the question of what would happen to the blockchain if Geth, which is used by more than two-thirds of validators and so is considered a \u201csupermajority client,\u201d had a bug. The situation could potentially result in a catastrophic fork of Ethereum.\n\nEthereum developer Lefteris Karapetsas joined Unchained to discuss the different scenarios of what could happen, the potential impact of a supermajority client issue on staking services such as Lido, why he feels the incentive system is poorly designed, and what other solutions are out there to address the lack of client diversity.\n\nShow highlights:\n\nWhat a consensus issue is in Ethereum and what happened with Nethermind last weekend\n\nWhy it would be a big problem if a supermajority client had a bug\n\nThe potential impact on staking services such as Lido\n\nWhy Lefteris feels like he is reliving the historic Ethereum DAO hack all over again\n\nWhether the largest entities running nodes will start pursuing client diversity\n\nHow the data on the prevalence of specific Ethereum execution clients is not verifiable or programmatic, making it less transparent and difficult to analyze\n\nWhy Lefteris believes that the incentive system is not designed to achieve client diversity\n\nWhether there are developments in the works to try to solve the lack of client diversity\n\nThank you to our sponsors!\n\nGuest\n\nLinks"

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nVitalik Buterin has recently voiced apprehensions about the privacy risks inherent in modern automotive technologies.\n\nA new report discloses alarming privacy issues in modern cars, termed \u201ccomputers on wheels\u201d.\n\nThe study reveals that most brands may share personal data, and a majority could even sell it.\n\nButerin supports modern technologies, including AI, but remains cautious about technologies posing privacy risks.\n\nVitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum, has recently expressed concerns about the privacy risks associated with modern automotive technologies.\n\nHis remarks come in the wake of a comprehensive report by researchers Jen Caltrider, Misha Rykov, and Zo\u00eb MacDonald, highlighting the substantial privacy challenges present in contemporary vehicles.\n\nAlarming Privacy Gaps in Modern Cars Revealed\n\nThe recent report, highlighted by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, reveals serious privacy concerns in modern vehicles, often referred to as \u201ccomputers on wheels.\u201d\n\nReminder: modern cars are highly networked computers and are a privacy nightmare. Very under-explored sector for privacy improvements. Some \"fancy ZK\" but also some plain boring \"collect and track less stuff please\".https://t.co/dWOga6SMcI \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) January 26, 2024\n\nThe study evaluated 25 car brands, all of which received a \u201cPrivacy Not Included\u201d warning, indicating notable privacy deficiencies.\n\nThe study claims :\n\n\u201cAll but two of the 25 car brands we reviewed earned our \u201cding\u201d for data control, meaning only two car brands, Renault and Dacia (which are owned by the same parent company) say that all drivers have the right to have their personal data deleted.\u201d\n\nModern computerized vehicles are gathering extensive user data , from personal traits and location to driving habits, which goes beyond vehicle operation and is crucial for business activities like marketing.\n\nThe study also found that 56% of these brands share data with government authorities upon request, and 86% reportedly sell or share this information. Alarmingly, 92% of drivers in modern vehicles have no control over the data collected.\n\nThe report stated :\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s bad enough for the behemoth corporations that own the car brands to have all that personal information in their possession, to use for their own research, marketing, or the ultra-vague \u201cbusiness purposes.\u201d But then, most (84%) of the car brands we researched say they can share your personal data \u2014 with service providers, data brokers, and other businesses we know little or nothing about. Worse, nineteen (76%) say they can sell your personal data.\u201d\n\nWhat are ZK-Rollups? We researched it, so you don't have to. \ud83c\udfaf ZK stands for Zero-Knowledge. A kind of proof that mathematically validates the correctness of transactions without revealing their exact details. So, in one word, Privacy. \ud83c\udfaf Rollup is a kind of Layer 2 (chain\u2026 pic.twitter.com/wON1730b5p \u2014 Dexifier (@DexifierX) January 22, 2024\n\nButerin\u2019s Stance Sparks Social Media Debate\n\nVitalik Buterin\u2019s recent comments on the privacy implications of modern cars have ignited a debate on social media regarding the trade-off between technological progress and privacy.\n\nDiscussions range from enthusiasts considering retrofitting classic cars to bypass contemporary privacy issues, to accusations of Buterin being anti-technology. In response, Buterin has clarified his position, affirming his support for various modern technologies, including certain AI applications.\n\nI embrace life extension, human genetic enhancement, artificial wombs, mind uploading, many kinds of modern AI (eg. I use it to make many pictures in my blog posts), geoengineering, ZK privacy, going to Mars\u2026 There's a small-but-important subset of things I worry about! \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) January 26, 2024\n\nHe emphasizes, however, his critical perspective on specific technologies that jeopardize privacy, underlining, \u201cThere\u2019s a small-but-important subset of things I worry about!\u201d\n\nAlarming Privacy Implications in the Modern Automotive Industry\n\nThe research has unveiled a troubling landscape in automotive data privacy. Each brand examined has been collecting more personal data than necessary, utilizing it for purposes beyond vehicle operation and customer relationship management. This issue isn\u2019t isolated to the automotive sector; it\u2019s reminiscent of the privacy challenges in mental health apps, yet the potential for data collection in cars is even more expansive. Vehicles can amass personal information through various channels, ranging from in-car interactions and connected services to external data sources like Sirius XM or Google Maps.\n\n.@WTKR3 \u2019s #CoastLive hosts discuss how cars are collecting and selling your data back to automakers for profit. Hey @CherylNelsonTV & @1AprilWoodard , we don\u2019t like that, either. Sign our petition to demand access & control of your car\u2019s data (via @Change ): https://t.co/ljAZJcDV9r pic.twitter.com/O8CuUBXFu0 \u2014 Auto Care Association (@AutoCareOrg) November 28, 2018\n\nDisturbingly, majority of these brands admit to sharing or selling this data. The depth and complexity of this data collection, including sensitive personal details, raise profound privacy concerns.\n\nThis trend suggests that car companies will exploit data privacy to the extent permissible by law. The modern automotive industry, therefore, not only represents a significant privacy risk but also highlights the urgent need for robust privacy regulations to protect consumers in an increasingly data-driven world."

        "content": "Ethereum Leads Weekly Altcoin Losses as Wider Market Sell-Off Continues\n\nThe crypto market remains in the red zone with altcoins and pack leader Ethereum (ETH) posting losses two weeks after the approval of spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETF by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nOn-chain data shows the price of several crypto assets trading at monthly lows. This comes in contrast to the uptick in prices towards the end of last year.\n\nThe recent sell-off can be seen across Bitcoin and a slew of altcoins as daily trading volumes of cryptocurrency plunge.\n\nIn the last 24 hours, daily trading volumes stood at $46.27 billion, a 6.61% decline from the previous day. This brings the total crypto market capitalization to $1.56 trillion.\n\nWith asset prices down, decentralized finance (DeFi) volumes have also plummeted and remain at $3.6 billion. At 7% of the entire crypto market, this shows reduced activity and sell-offs.\n\nEthereum Leads The Pack\n\n\n\nEthereum has recorded the biggest loss among altcoins in the top 20 ranked assets across the last seven days with its decline entering double figures.\n\nETH is down by 10.7% in a week at the time of writing and exchanges hands at $2,212, a 0.4% slight slump in the past 24 hours.\n\nLike most assets, Ethereum gained momentum in Q4 2023 after a slow start to the year coming off the 2022 bear market. The altcoin giant recorded 90% profits throughout the year notching institutional inflows and impressive DeFi numbers.\n\nHowever, gains posted in December have been wiped off amid the recent market correction. Bears are currently predicting a slightly lower price in the upcoming weeks. Solana (SOL) and Ripple (XRP) had 6.69% and 6.4% losses in the past week to trade at $87.83 and $0.51 respectively.\n\nLike ETH, massive December gains recorded by SOL have been wiped out as the asset posts a monthly decline of 23.22%. XRP\u2019s monthly losses are at 17.63%. Cardano (ADA) and Avalanche (AVAX) have plunged 5.54% and 7.5% respectively in the past week with a larger 22% and 15.29% in the last 30 days.\n\nBitcoin Is Still in The Sell-off Mix\n\n\n\nAs the altcoin market remains in the red zone, Bitcoin\u2019s correction after the approval of spot ETFs has drawn opinions from several commentators with some stating that this was simply a sell-the-news event.\n\nThe months leading up to the approval were marked with an improved institutional investor appetite as the asset\u2019s price surged to levels not seen in months.\n\nThis was followed by predictions from analysts of a massive price gain after the approval as it became a new window for investors to increase their exposure to the top assets.\n\nMatrixport projected a $50,000 price for the asset in December and with the recent price correction, a new report has been released on a potential price decline to $36,739 before a rebound."

The firm also moved 146,507 ETH, valued at around $323.3 million, to Paxos, and another 7,800 ETH, worth $17.2 million, were transferred to FalconX.\n\nThis latest transfer follows a series of similar fund movements by Celsius in recent days. On Jan. 24, blockchain investigator Lookonchain reported that the firm deposited 18,000 ETH, worth $40 million, to Coinbase.\n\nMeanwhile, the crypto analytical platform Spot on Chain provided a more in-depth analysis of the transfers. According to the firm, Celsius has deposited 740,321 ETH, worth an estimated $1.69 billion, to centralized exchanges, including FalconX, Coinbase, OKX, and Paxos, since November 2023.\n\nHowever, despite these transactions, the firm still holds a sizeable amount of ETH. Its address retains 62,468 ETH, approximately $139 million as of press time.\n\nWhy is Celsius making these transfers?\n\nSpot On Chain\u2019s analysis suggests the possibility of an over-the-counter (OTC) transaction, as around 97.2% of the total deposited funds to Coinbase were withdrawn to 12 newly created wallets.\n\n\u201cWe noticed that 12 fresh wallets have withdrawn 296,835 $ETH (660M) from Coinbase shortly after Celsius deposited $ETH to the CEX, accounting for ~97.2% of the total deposited amount. This is probably an OTC deal,\u201d the firm said.\n\nMeanwhile, the motive behind the transfer remains undisclosed. But it coincides with creditors\u2019 anticipation of a potential repayment launch in February.\n\nOn Jan. 25, the Celsius Newco Community suggested that the firm had an effective date of Jan. 31, with expectations of distributing liquid crypto to Earn Creditors starting mid-February.\n\nA Celsius distribution FAQ hints at Coinbase being the platform of choice for creditor repayments in specific countries. Eighty-nine countries (excluding the United States) are eligible for the Coinbase distribution.\n\nThe Celsius Creditors Community group on social media platform X (formerly Twitter) also includes several creditors of the failed firm, who reveal that they received instructions to prepare for their Celsius distribution via Coinbase."

        "title": "Report Shows Polygon Users Rivaled Ethereum In 2023, But Why Has Price Failed To Clear $1? - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Layer-2 network Polygon is reported to have competed with Ethereum in 2023, as both networks saw the most influx of new users. This development has once again raised concerns about MATIC\u2019s price, considering that such an achievement should potentially mean that new money moved into the ecosystem last year.\n\nPolygon and Ethereum Acquired The Most Users In 2023\n\nAccording to a report by Blockchain analytics firm Flipside, Polygon and Ethereum led the pack with 30.6 million acquired users in 2023. Giving a further breakdown, Polygon is said to have acquired 15,24 million users, while Ethereum attracted 15.4 million users. Meanwhile, these users are defined as persons who performed at least two transactions on the networks.\n\nDespite falling about 160,000 short of Ethereum\u2019s numbers, Polygon\u2019s numbers are still impressive, considering that it ranked ahead of other networks like Bitcoin and Solana. The layer-2 network also outperformed other Ethereum L2 networks like Arbitrum, Optimism, and Base, which recorded 7.3 million, 3.3 million, and 1.9 million acquired users, respectively.\n\nNotably, Polygon hit the ground running as soon as 2023 began, setting the record for monthly acquired users with 2 million in January. Interestingly, January 2023 was the first time MATIC rose above $1 in a very long while. It held above that level until the end of April 2023. After that, MATIC traded below that level for most of the year, only rising above $1 towards the end of December 2023.\n\nMATIC price at $0.74 | Source: MATICUSDT on Tradingview.com\n\nWhy Has MATIC Failed To Rise And Hold Above $1\n\nA recent analysis by Blockchain intelligence firm ChainArgos suggested that the Polygon team has been secretly selling off MATIC tokens, something which could have accounted for the significant sell pressures that have risen at different times for the crypto token. This could also serve as a plausible explanation for why MATIC has struggled to hold above $1 despite enjoying great utility.\n\nThe Polygon team was accused of not executing its token allocations in line with the publicly stated plan, with part of the allocated funds accounting for some of the tokens that were sold. These secret sales, which have for long gone under the radar, are said to be circumvented through wallets linked to the crypto exchange Binance.\n\nSo far, about 767 million MATIC have apparently been offloaded in these secret transactions. ChainArgos hinted at how these transactions have no doubt affected MATIC\u2019s price on different occasions, as they noted that the outflows are a \u201cgood indicator for an upcoming top and subsequent move lower.\u201d\n\nAt the time of writing, MATIC is trading at around $0.73, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.\n\nFeatured image from CoinGape, chart from Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

Next date that matters is May 23rd https://t.co/2zBBvHkrVk \u2014 James Seyffart (@JSeyff) January 24, 2024\n\nAs the SEC recently approved spot Bitcoin ETF applications, issuers, and exchanges responded by filing updated documents to address the regulator\u2019s queries. The current status of the spot Ethereum ETF applications in this regard remains uncertain.\n\nThis week\u2019s developments include the SEC inviting public input on several questions related to these applications. A key query for consideration is whether a spot Ethereum ETF would bear similarities to its Bitcoin counterpart, indicating a new phase of scrutiny and public engagement in the process of evaluating Ethereum-based ETFs.\n\nThe filing asked :\n\n\u201cDo commenters agree that arguments to support the listing of Bitcoin ETPs apply equally to the Shares?

These inquiries delve into issues of market manipulation, the correlation between spot and futures markets, and whether the CME futures market for Ethereum is sufficiently large.\n\nThe final deadline for the Spot #Ethereum ETF is in 124 days! pic.twitter.com/vjSpzGWsUG \u2014 Crypto Rover (@rovercrc) January 22, 2024\n\nAmid regulatory deliberations, optimists are predicting that spot Ethereum-ETFs could be adopted by the summer of 2024. This optimistic outlook hinges on a forthcoming decision by the CFTC and the SEC, which is expected to clarify whether Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by capitalization, does not meet the criteria of a security.\n\nReporting on the timeline for a potential $ETH ETF approval has turned up a plethora of different takes from ETF issuers, investment management firms and sources close to the @SECGov . \u2728One $BTC Spot ETF issuer with an ETH Spot ETF application says they\u2019re confident the\u2026 \u2014 Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) January 23, 2024\n\nExperts suggest that the ongoing trial involving Binance could provide much-needed clarity regarding Ethereum\u2019s status in terms of securities law.\n\nSEC Commissioner Talks Ethereum ETF Approval\n\nHester Peirce, often called \u201cCrypto Mom\u201d for her positive stance on cryptocurrencies, has highlighted the correlation between futures and spot markets in cryptocurrencies, which could influence the SEC\u2019s decision-making process. Her\u2026 \u2014 guardando user (@notouchbitch) January 26, 2024\n\nBinance\u2019s Challenges Signal a Path to Mainstream Crypto Adoption\n\nThis anticipation stems from discussions in previous meetings, particularly the reference to DAO tokens being considered securities. The outcome of the Binance trial is seen as potentially pivotal in establishing a clearer regulatory framework for Ethereum and similar cryptocurrencies.\n\nBinance\u2019s regulatory challenges are indicative of a broader trend affecting the crypto industry, with global regulators increasingly demanding transparency from crypto exchanges. This heightened scrutiny isn\u2019t limited to regulatory bodies; major banks have also limited Binance\u2019s access, reflecting a broader reevaluation of their stance on crypto.\n\nThe primary concerns cited are risks related to money laundering. However, this intensified regulatory focus on Binance and other crypto firms doesn\u2019t signal an end for the industry. Instead, it suggests the onset of a more regulated and potentially mainstream future for crypto assets and exchanges."

        "content": "The metaverse hype train veered sharply off the tracks in late-2021 as crypto markets soured. This left many virtual worlds feeling more like ghost towns. But while metaverse mania has cooled considerably, I believe the long-term growth narrative for Web3 and immersive digital environments remains intact. Cyclical downturns are par for the course in crypto, and today\u2019s laggards can spearhead gains when the next bull run begins.\n\nSeveral catalysts on the horizon could re-ignite \u201cmeta mania\u201d and crypto bullishness more broadly in 2024 and beyond. More Bitcoin (BTC-USD) ETF approvals, block reward halvings, and potential Fed rate cuts could all fuel digital assets. We\u2019ll look at some top projects today instead of small-cap cryptos. Here are three to consider based on their ties to Web3 and the metaverse.\n\nEthereum (ETH-USD)\n\nA coin with the Ethreum logo on top of a financial document\n\nSource: shutterstock\n\nEthereum (ETH-USD) remains the go-to cryptocurrency for anyone seeking major exposure to the Web 3.0 ecosystem. Even if the recent metaverse and NFT frenzies have cooled, Ethereum still stands as the leading blockchain underpinning countless decentralized apps and services.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nEthereum\u2019s key edge over Bitcoin relates to its support for smart contracts and advanced functionality beyond payments. As the dominant Web3 blockchain, most projects being built in areas like DeFi, NFTs, and the metaverse, increasingly rely on Ethereum\u2019s global computing network. Users of these apps must pay gas fees in Ethereum, creating perpetual demand even during bear markets.\n\nThis wide utility and role as the \u201cfuel\u201d of Web3 is why Ethereum has massively outperformed Bitcoin in previous bull runs. And with the major Dencon upgrade slated to launch by mid-2024, I expect Ethereum\u2019s advantage over Bitcoin to widen further in the next cycle. Dencon aims to slash Ethereum gas fees by up to 90% while accelerating layer-2 scaling solutions.\n\nSo, if we do get an influx of new crypto buyers and restore Web3 hype, I anticipate Ethereum providing major upside. We could see surging decentralized application usage, NFT sales volume growth, and higher gas consumption pushing Ethereum prices significantly higher, perhaps even to new highs. For broad exposure to a potential Web3 resurgence, Ethereum remains the leading crypto to consider.\n\nStory continues\n\nSolana (SOL-USD)\n\nAbstract 3d rendered coin solana (SOL-USD)\n\nSource: solvertv / Shutterstock.com\n\nEven if the upcoming Dencon cuts Ethereum fees and enhances layer-2 capabilities, transacting and building on Ethereum will likely remain pricier and more cumbersome than alternatives like Solana (SOL-USD).\n\nWith lightning-fast speeds and rock-bottom fees, Solana presents a compelling Web3 option for both developers and users. It has already successfully peeled off market share from Ethereum in NFT trading volume and other areas like DeFi.\n\nI expect the network effects and composability benefits of building on a high-activity chain like Solana to help it gain additional traction if we enter a fresh bull cycle, particularly if congestion and high gas fees resurface on Ethereum amid surging usage.\n\nOf course, Solana still has progress to make, notably in improving its network reliability and uptime. However, the Solana team has made big strides in optimizing stability and mitigating outages over the past year.\n\nGiven the immense room for adoption and growth, I think Solana\u2019s price levels around $90 per token seem attractive. Despite its early-stage flaws, Solana remains one of my top altcoin picks for mega returns if the Web3 and metaverse themes catch fire again.\n\nRender Token (RNDR-USD)\n\nThe Render (RNDR) crypto logo displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: Maurice NORBERT / Shutterstock.com\n\nUnlike Ethereum and Solana, which are essentially generalized Web3 blockchains, Render Token (RNDR-USD) and the Render Network target a specific niche \u2013 GPU graphics processing power.\n\nRender operates a network that lets users easily buy and sell excess graphics and compute resources for rendering 3D visuals, animations, models, and more. This on-demand access allows smaller creators to tap into strong GPU performance without substantial up-front investment.\n\nAs metaverse and Web3 content creation pick back up, Render stands to see surging demand from various verticals like architectural and product visualization, special effects, advertisements, video game development, and VR/AR experiences.\n\nIn fact, Render\u2019s native token RNDR has already rocketed higher in recent months \u2013 surging from around 40 cents to current levels approaching $4. I expect this momentum to continue over 2023 and 2024 if the overall environment improves for cryptos and its futuristic applications.\n\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Share this article URL Copied\n\nEthereum layer-2 blockchains (L2) could start a war on which one of them offers the lowest cost fees in 2024, according to a Jan. 25 report by on-chain data platform Flipside. This dispute could happen if a bull run starts in 2024, raising transaction costs for Ethereum and making users look for alternatives.\n\nMoreover, a more competitive environment for L2s could result in smaller margins for the projects, better user experience, and renewed interest in those chains\u2019 governance tokens, such as OP, ARB, and POL. Ultimately, Flipside analysts believe that this war will accelerate the adoption of EVM-compatible blockchains.\n\nEVM stands for Ethereum Virtual Machine, which can be simply understood as the software translating and executing smart contracts commands. Thus, the existence of a decentralized application like Uniswap or Aave needs an EVM to process the information sent from their smart contracts.\n\nAnother catalyst for a wider Ethereum L2 adoption is the upgrade Dencun, set to happen in 2024\u2019s first semester, which will introduce \u2018blobs\u2019. Blobs are transactions capable of handling large amounts of data and can be attached to Ethereum\u2019s blocks. As a result, L2 will be able to use those blobs to store transaction data, freeing up more space in Ethereum\u2019s blocks and raising L2\u2019s throughput.\n\nNew market participants\n\nFlipside\u2019s report also mentions expectations around more blockchains being launched in 2024 than during the previous year. This could mean that more blockchains with specific use cases will capitalize on each network\u2019s advantages.\n\nThose new chains will emerge to meet new and existing demand, and Ethereum L2s might have to fight for users\u2019 interest, since there\u2019s still an appetite for new blockchains, according to Flipside.\n\nBesides, the report underscores that new blockchains were still relatively new during the bull run seen between 2020 and 2021. However, those chains have made significant developments in the last two years regarding cross-chain interactions and transfers, making it easier for Web3 users to interact with multiple chains.\n\nWhile most crypto users will continue to engage with one single chain, the report points out, \u201cthe overall crypto community will become more mobile, flexible, and willing to move across different chains to capitalize on various opportunities\u201d. Therefore, on top of their war on Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem, L2s may face more external competition this year."

If you encounter any issues, kindly report them to [email protected]. Crypto assets/products can be highly risky. Never invest unless you\u2019re prepared to lose all the money you invest.\n\nIn the fast-paced world of cryptocurrencies, where innovation and potential are constantly reshaping the market, two standout tokens are poised for a significant impact in the upcoming bull market surge. Ethereum (ETH), a stalwart of the blockchain industry, and Pandoshi (PAMBO), an emerging force with a unique approach, are capturing the attention of both seasoned investors and newcomers alike.\n\nWhile Ethereum has long held its position as the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, Pandoshi is rapidly ascending, driven by its dedicated community and forward-thinking strategies.\n\nEthereum (ETH): The Trailblazing Pioneer\n\nEthereum, often hailed as the trailblazer of blockchain technology, has firmly secured its position as the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Launched in 2015 by the visionary Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum introduced a decentralized platform powered by blockchain technology to the world. At the heart of this ecosystem lies its native token, ETH, which serves as the lifeblood of the network.\n\nThe significance of Ethereum extends beyond its market ranking. It has become a cornerstone of the decentralized finance (DeFi) space, revolutionizing traditional financial systems. Ethereum\u2019s blockchain enables a wide range of financial instruments, including lending, borrowing, and trading, all without the need for reliance on traditional financial institutions. This innovation has unlocked new opportunities for users worldwide, empowering them to take control of their financial activities.\n\nDespite recent market turbulence that may raise concerns, Ethereum stands on a foundation of strength. Its fundamentals remain robust, with a thriving community of developers continuously working on improvements and enhancements. Ethereum\u2019s dynamic ecosystem is influenced by various factors, including network upgrades, adoption by businesses, and market sentiment.

This emerging player is gaining attention for its impressive performance during its ongoing presale stage and its potential for substantial growth in the upcoming bull run.\n\nClick Here To Take Part In Pandoshi Presale\n\nPandoshi (PAMBO): The Emerging Contender\n\nPandoshi, with its dedicated community and a wide range of utilities within its ecosystem, has positioned itself as a promising contender in the crypto space. The project\u2019s unique approach includes a deflationary token model, aligning with the current trends favoring scarcity and value preservation. This model involves the gradual reduction of the token supply over time, a feature that appeals to investors seeking assets with growth potential.\n\nThe Pandoshi platform boasts a comprehensive and dynamic ecosystem, centered around a Layer-2 Network utilizing the Proof of Stake protocol. This choice underscores the project\u2019s commitment to eco-friendliness, offering a greener alternative to traditional Proof of Work methods. The ecosystem encompasses various elements: a decentralized exchange, the recently released Pandoshi Wallet on the Google Play Store, offering secure and user-directed control, immersive Metaverse gaming, educational programs, and cryptocurrency-friendly prepaid cards.

Experts in the crypto sphere have taken note of Pandoshi\u2019s potential to surge in value during the anticipated bull market. As investors and enthusiasts seek opportunities beyond the established giants, Pandoshi\u2019s presence in the market offers a fresh perspective.\n\nConclusion: A Tale of Two Tokens\n\nAs the cryptocurrency market enters a new phase of potential growth, Ethereum (ETH) and Pandoshi (PAMBO) are positioned on different points of the spectrum. Ethereum, with its established reputation and fundamental strength, is poised to continue its journey as a blockchain powerhouse, driving innovation in the DeFi space. Meanwhile, Pandoshi, as an emerging contender, has captured the attention of experts and investors alike, showcasing its potential for significant growth in the upcoming bull market.\n\nThe crypto world remains dynamic and filled with opportunities, and the stories of Ethereum and Pandoshi exemplify the diverse paths that tokens can take in this ever-evolving landscape.

        "content": "Celsius moved $1 billion worth of ETH.\n\nETH ETF approval got delayed, but price of ETH remain unaffected.\n\nThe now-inoperative crypto lending platform Celsius made significant transfers of Ethereum [ETH] to centralized exchanges over the last few days. The latest transaction involved a substantial 459,561 ETH, valued at around $1 billion at press time.\n\nBig ETH moves\n\nThe reason for the ETH transactions remained unclear.\n\nHowever, according to an earlier report, Celsius had initiated a process of recalling and rebalancing its assets, part of which was unstaking its ETH holdings. This was to meet the troubled crypto lender\u2019s liabilities under the bankruptcy proceedings.\n\nNevertheless, the recent transactions gave boost to creditor expectations that Celsius will start repaying them soon.\n\nAt the same time, there is a possibility that these transactions may add further selling pressure on ETH, causing its price to decline.\n\nAt press time, ETH was trading at $2,221.23 and its price had grown by 0.44% in the last 24 hours.\n\nETF uncertainty\n\nApart from the Celsius transfers, another factor that could influence ETH\u2019s price could be the anticipation around the ETH ETF and its approval.\n\nRecently, the U.S. SEC delayed its decision on Grayscale Investments application to transform its Ethereum trust product (ETHE) into an exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nSimilarly, the SEC also postponed BlackRock\u2019s application for a similar investment vehicle.\n\nThe delay in the approval of Ethereum ETFs could impact the sentiment around ETH to decline and could cause a negative impact on the price of ETH.\n\nHowever, the progress of Ethereum\u2019s developments could help in countering the FUD caused by these events.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nIn a recent development call, developers got together to discuss future plans for Ethereum.\n\nThe upcoming Dencun upgrade will play a pivotal role in shaping the narrative around Ethereum in the future and could nudge ETH\u2019s price to move in a positive direction."

        "content": "Parallelizing the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) has been a topic of interest for many in the cryptocurrency space in recent weeks.\n\nParallelization increases transaction throughput and improves blockchain scalability by executing multiple transactions simultaneously rather than in the sequential order in which they arrive.\n\nHowever, Rachel Bousfield, tech lead at Offchain Labs, told Blockworks in an interview that people often overstate the value of parallelism.\n\n\u201cThe kinds of returns and fee reductions that people expect don\u2019t really play out in practice,\u201d Bousfield said. \u201cA lot of the times when people talk about fees being cut due to parallelism, it\u2019s often cut due to other things that are around it.\u201d\n\nRead more: Parallelized EVMs are gaining popularity, but they won\u2019t scale blockchains alone\n\nBousfield explains that different blockchains have different hardware requirements. In the case of Ethereum, the blockchain is designed to ensure that running a node is relatively inexpensive and that low-end computers are able to meaningfully contribute to the Ethereum network in the form of running applications or running validators.\n\nThis differs from other blockchains, which may enable parallelism, but the cost demands for running a node become much higher.\n\nRyan Watkins is the co-founder of Syncracy Capital, on Solana \u2014 a network that does enable parallelism. According to a post by Watkins, it is estimated that the cost to run a node is five times more expensive to run than Ethereum nodes. He said that the network currently has an estimated 40% of the number of nodes that Ethereum has.\n\n\u201cIf Ethereum wanted to, they could dramatically increase the demands and costs of running an Ethereum validator, and you would see performance improve, there\u2019d be more capacity, and people\u2019s fees would be lower, but is that really the kind of scaling that Ethereum wants in its future? It\u2019s not clear to me that that would be an advisable decision,\u201d Bousfield said.\n\nRead more: Scaling Ethereum\u2019s virtual machine is a \u2018solvable problem,\u2019 says Monad Labs\u2019 Galler\n\nAdditionally, Bousfield notes that parallelism enables throughput to improve efficiency when there are multiple users wanting to do different kinds of things in crypto at the same time.\n\n\u201cThe problem is that in real life, the actual demand we see on these blockchain networks is when people want to do very similar things to each other. When there is an airdrop, everyone wants to mint it at the same time. When there is a price discrepancy between DEXs, everybody wants to rush in and get MEV arbitrage out of it,\u201d Bousfield said.\n\nShe notes that the technical term to describe this type of activity is called \u201ccontention,\u201d adding that gas prices are often the highest when multiple people hope to do the same thing.\n\nIn fact, a recent study by Polygon Labs shows that parallelism is applicable to around 55% of the transactions in most blocks on its network.\n\n\u201cThis means that if parallelism was perfect, had a million cores, and ran really, really fast to the point where everything parallelized was executed instantaneously, you could, at best, double Polygon\u2019s capacity with that,\u201d she explained.\n\nWith that said, Bousfield notes that parallelism itself is not a bad thing, but it is not the silver bullet that many are anticipating.\n\nOn tackling the problem around transaction speeds and ways to increase throughput, Bousfield notes that Arbitrum Stylus achieves this by making it simpler for hardware to read and interpret data.\n\nIn a traditional EVM, when the hardware receives data, it must check that it is accurate, enable branches and simulate it in memory \u2014 steps that often take a great deal of time. In contrast, Bousfield notes that Stylus is designed to speak the language of the central processing unit (CPU).\n\n\u201cBy removing that layer of interpretation, Stylus is able to get a 10-100x speed on all compute workloads,\u201d she said. \u201cI think that strategies like this are where the big gains are going to be.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "Ethereum's decentralized mantra in tatters after execution of client bug - CoinGeek",
        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s claims of decentralization are ringing ever more hollow due to the network\u2019s lack of client software diversity, an overreliance that could pose an existential threat to ETH stakers.\n\nLast weekend, around 8% of Ethereum proof-of-stake (PoS) transaction validators suddenly began producing invalid blocks due to a critical flaw in the Nethermind client software. The issue followed the release of Netherland\u2019s v1.23.0 update, requiring a frantic patch to get these network nodes back in business.\n\nWhile the order was eventually restored, a similar scenario befell the Besu client earlier this month. Besu\u2019s share of the Ethereum execution client market was around 5% at the time and has since fallen to 4%.\n\nEthereum watchers soon warned that the fallout could be catastrophic if/when a similar situation impacted the Geth (Go Ethereum) client. Geth accounted for around 84% of network execution clients at the time of the Nethermind bug, but a concerted effort to sound the \u2018eggs in one basket\u2019 alarm has since pushed this down to a mere 79%.\n\nGeth is client software developed by the Ethereum Foundation that supports network functions like transaction validation and smart contract execution. Geth is generally considered a more robust option than its rivals, which, along with the Foundation\u2019s stamp of approval, is why it accounts for such an outsized market share.\n\nRegardless, such a high concentration level would be problematic in any sector. But in an industry so prone to probing by malicious actors\u2014particularly those adept at software supply chain attacks\u2014it\u2019s a recipe for disaster.\n\nA Geth failure would bring Ethereum finalization to a screeching halt, but as Labrys developer Lachlan Feeney recently suggested, this vulnerability could also result in the loss of the majority of the roughly 29 million ETH currently staked by validators.\n\nBecause validators are penalized for being offline, an \u2018inactivity leak\u2019 could rob validators of two months\u2019 worth of staking rewards in just two days. Should the downtime extend for five days, a year\u2019s worth of rewards would be lost. A weeklong outage could cost validators 10% of their staked ETH, while 90% of that stake could be lost if the outage extends to six weeks. While such a prolonged outage may be unlikely, it\u2019s also not impossible.\n\nGeth-based validators would likely stampede for the exits rather than watch their stake bleed away to nothing. But they\u2019d get caught in a logjam of similarly minded validators, all of whom would continue bleeding ETH as they wait their turn to disembark this sinking ship. Given the sheer number of Geth-based validators, this bottleneck could mean that only one in 12 could exit with more than 50% of their stake.\n\nFork me\n\nThe potential repercussions of a serious Geth bug don\u2019t stop there. Should a Geth-based validator produce an invalid block, Geth\u2019s domination of the network could result in this invalid block being added to the chain, resulting in a fork that would quickly become the dominant chain. Geth validators would be blocked from the valid chain until the smaller chain is finalized.\n\nAs Feeney put it, \u201cBecause the Geth validators are stuck on the invalid chain, they are considered inactive on the non-Geth chain and will suffer the inactivity leak. No software update or bug patch to Geth will save these validators. They will be bled out until their stake represents <\u2153 of the network, allowing the non-Geth chain to finalize.\u201d\n\nFeeney estimates that this bleeding could result in an 18% reduction in the total supply of ETH. (That\u2019s definitely one method of creating artificial scarcity and thus losing the token\u2019s fiat value.)\n\nFeeney offered this warning: \u201cStaked ETH is not risk-free yield. Would you invest a minimum of $75,000 USD [the rough value of the 32 ETH required for serving as a validator] into an instrument where the maximum potential gain is 3.5% p.a. but the potential for loss is 100% (even if that loss is unlikely)? Probably not, but this is what 84% of the Ethereum stakers are doing today.\u201d\n\nLido shuffle\n\nRetail users lacking the 32 ETH necessary to stake on their own have several options for pooling their resources, but staking via a service won\u2019t necessarily protect them from the potential carnage described above.\n\nLido Finance, the largest staking service with around 9.4 million ETH staked, relies on Geth for most of its operations. On January 23, Lido stated that its preliminary Q4/23 data put Geth usage across Lido protocol validators at 67%, down from 76% in Q3/23 and 93% in Q3/22. Lido said \u201cclient diversity is fundamental\u201d to its \u201cmission to decentralize Ethereum.\u201d\n\nLido added that its Lido DAO (decentralized autonomous organization) node operators \u201care afforded high degrees of autonomy,\u201d but they \u201chave already begun to signal their commitments to reduce majority client usage, or explain how their setups avoid the possibility of being affected by supermajority bugs.\u201d\n\nCoinbase has a plan to make a plan\n\nThe Coinbase (NASDAQ: COIN) exchange has faced similar queries this week about its reliance on Geth. On January 22, CEO Brian Armstrong personally responded to a Coinbase customer who tweeted that they had \u201cunstaked all of the ETH I had staked with you since you offered it as a service.\u201d The user added that this \u201csingle client staking setup\u201d made it \u201cnot worth the risk\u201d of losing \u201ca large percentage of my deposit.\u201d Armstrong replied: \u201cTaking a look.\u201d\n\nLater that day, the Coinbase Cloud account tweeted that when it launched its ETH staking service, \u201cGeth was the only client that met our technical requirements.\u201d Coinbase claimed that \u201cexecution client diversity \u2026 is a critical concern,\u201d and thus, it was conducting \u201can updated technical assessment with the goal of adding another execution client to our infrastructure.\u201d Coinbase promised to provide an update on its progress \u201cby the end of February.\u201d\n\nNot everyone found this reassuring, with at least one customer suggesting that the situation wasn\u2019t \u201ca review and plan kind of phase. This is take serious and urgent action, with informed customers phase.\u201d Coinbase was urged to set up \u201can insurance fund or allow us to opt in to other clients\u201d because \u201cthe risk of supermajority failure is a *bigger* risk to your customers than minority client failure.\u201d\n\nThis probably wasn\u2019t the best week for Coinbase to run a sponsored post on Decrypt promoting the claim that its staking service \u201caims to be a \u2018one-stop shop\u2019 for crypto staking.\u201d One stop, one point of failure\u2026 Synergy!\n\nCoinbase rival exchanges Binance, Kraken, and Bitfinex (among others) also rely solely on Geth to power their staking services. However, they have kept quiet regarding any plans they may have to inject a little diversity into their operations.\n\nAll in one\n\nDecentralization theater has been Ethereum\u2019s stock-in-trade from its inception, starting with the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s oversight-bereft crowd sale that delivered the majority of ETH into the hands of a few whales. This concentration of wealth and power continues to this day via the PoS consensus mechanism that further enriches the whales who can afford to run multiple validators.\n\nThis centralization was recently cited by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as part of the reason it was delaying decisions on applications to offer Ethereum spot-based exchange-traded funds (ETF). BlackRock, Grayscale Investments, and Fidelity are among those chomping at the bit to offer Ethereum ETFs to the public following the launch of multiple BTC spot-based ETFs earlier this month.\n\nIn approving those BTC ETFs, SEC chairman Gary Gensler stressed that the decision was limited to \u201cone non-security commodity\u201d (BTC) and \u201cshould in no way signal the Commission\u2019s willingness to approve listing standards for crypto asset securities.\u201d Gensler, who has previously stated his belief that ETH is an unregistered security, reiterated his \u2018don\u2019t expect ETH ETF approvals anytime soon\u2019 message earlier this week.\n\nOn Thursday, the SEC posted a list of ETH-related questions for public comment before making any ETF decision. For instance, the SEC wonders if there are \u201cparticular features related to ETH and its ecosystem, including its proof of stake consensus mechanism and concentration of control or influence by a few individuals or entities, that raise unique concerns about ETH\u2019s susceptibility to fraud and manipulation?\u201d\n\nInterested parties are instructed to submit their comments within three weeks. Just remember Ethereum Foundation members, you have to at least try to make it look like they\u2019re not all coming from the same address.\n\nFollow CoinGeek\u2019s Crypto Crime Cartel series, which delves into the stream of groups\u2014from BitMEX to Binance, Bitcoin.com, Blockstream, ShapeShift, Coinbase, Ripple, Ethereum,\n\nFTX and Tether\u2014who have co-opted the digital asset revolution and turned the industry into a minefield for na\u00efve (and even experienced) players in the market.\n\nNew to blockchain?

        "content": "Market picture\n\nVolatility in the cryptocurrency market remains subdued, keeping the capitalisation near $1.56 trillion for the third day. Meanwhile, Bitcoin remains around $40K, and Ethereum looks pegged to $2200.\n\nThe drop in equity indices over the past 24 hours hasn\u2019t been too much of a concern for cryptocurrency investors so far, as it looks more like a series of individual corporate stories rather than a global shift in sentiment.\n\nBitcoin is benefiting from this consolidation as its share of all cryptocurrencies has once again surpassed 50%.\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum, the second most-capitalised coin, has returned to the lower end of the consolidation it spent most of December in, losing since the start of the day and threatening to fall a notch lower to the $2100 area, which was the upper end of the consolidation in November. A decline here would be as logical a move as a BTCUSD pullback to $37500, which remains the main scenario. At the same time, however, be prepared for a brief dip towards $2000 due to cryptocurrency volatility.\n\nNews background\n\nThe SEC postponed the decision on BlackRock\u2019s application to launch a spot Ethereum ETF until 10 March. Optimistic experts expect the Ethereum ETF to be approved in May with a 50-70% probability, while sceptics point to regulatory resistance.\n\nThe emergence of spot bitcoin ETFs in the US has opened the door for the cryptocurrency to reach a wider audience. Now, for the first time, cryptocurrency could become mainstream, said the head of institutional at exchange Coinbase. New cryptocurrencies will attract a lot of capital, but it won\u2019t happen overnight. It will take \u201cmonths and even years\u201d.\n\nThe G20\u2019s Financial Stability Board in 2024 plans to focus on global regulations for the digital asset industry and the regulation of artificial intelligence.\n\nReuters confirmed the existence of a thriving underground crypto market in China. Investor interest in digital assets is growing against the backdrop of a troubled economy and a lack of value preservation tools. With Hong Kong\u2019s approval of digital assets in 2023, Hong Kong has become one of the opportunities for Chinese investors to access cryptocurrencies."

        "content": "Ethereum Scaling Solution AltLayer Launches With $100 Million Airdrop\n\nAltLayer recently became the first of at least three protocols to go live with an impressive $100 million token airdrops scheduled for the upcoming week. The launch marks a milestone in the field of blockchain technology, offering promising solutions for Ethereum's scalability issues.\n\nThe much-anticipated ALT token and the claiming process were officially made available to the public as of Jan. 25, 9 am UTC, as per Cointelegraph. A staggering 300 million tokens were allocated for the initial airdrop, resulting in a total value of approximately $96 million based on the current average daily price of $0.32 per token.\n\nHowever, Celestia stakers eager to participate in the ALT airdrop will have to exercise patience as AltLayer reported technical differences delaying the distribution to Celestia. Despite this delay, AltLayer's airdrop comes at a time when several other projects are also expected to distribute their respective tokens to eligible recipients within the same timeframe.\n\nDymension and Jupiter to Follow Suit\n\nAccording to ADVFN, among these projects is Dymension, a multilayer rollup deployer poised to launch its mainnet in the near future. Dymension plans to airdrop 70 million DYM tokens, primarily benefiting Celestia stakers and Pudgy Penguin NFT holders, as well as participants in the Solana and Ethereum ecosystems.\n\nFurthermore, the Solana-based decentralized exchange Jupiter has confirmed the launch of its highly anticipated JUP token on Jan. 31. A total of 1 billion tokens will be distributed through the airdrop, making it potentially worth around $410 million based on the current pre-market trading price of approximately $0.41 per token.\n\nBitcoin Ordinals Users Could Benefit from Airdrop\n\nIn addition, Bitcoin Ordinals users may also have an opportunity to participate in an airdrop. Ordinals developer Leonidas recently announced the launch of \"Runestone,\" a decentralized \"fairdrop\" initiative designed to reward early users of the Ordinals protocol. The airdrop aims to incentivize users' early adoption and engagement.\n\nWhile airdrops offer exciting possibilities, crypto users must exercise caution. The X platform is currently plagued by scam accounts posing as crypto firms' official social media pages announcing airdrops. Users must remain vigilant to avoid falling victim to these fraudulent schemes.\n\nPhoto: Traxer/Unsplash\n\nTokenPost | [email protected]"

        "title": "3 cheap Ethereum Alternatives primed for quick 15x profits - Cryptonews",
        "content": "3 cheap Ethereum Alternatives primed for quick 15x profits\n\nInvestors and enthusiasts are perpetually seeking alternatives that not only bring unique features to the table but also promise substantial profits. Ethereum, as a frontrunner in the blockchain space, has paved the way for the emergence of innovative projects aiming to provide viable alternatives. Notable among these alternatives are Retik Finance, Ripple (XRP), and Cardano (ADA), which distinguish themselves as promising contenders. Frequently hailed as cheap alternatives to Ethereum, these projects are positioned for potentially rapid 15x profit gains. As the cryptocurrency landscape continues to evolve, the allure of these alternatives lies not only in their affordability but also in their potential to deliver significant returns, attracting attention from investors looking for diverse and lucrative opportunities in the blockchain sphere.\n\nRetik Finance: Illuminating the Path to Financial Empowerment\n\n\n\nRetik Finance steps onto the financial stage with a forward-looking vision that extends beyond current norms, envisioning a future marked by heightened financial empowerment, steadfast reliability, and unparalleled transparency. The project\u2019s mission involves seamlessly integrating cryptocurrency with traditional fiat payment systems, breaking down barriers to enable global financial inclusion regardless of geographical location or financial status. Employing cutting-edge technologies, Retik aspires to revolutionise financial transactions, introducing a paradigm shift that transcends the constraints of existing systems.At the core of Retik\u2019s transformative vision is the foundational principle of decentralisation, offering access to a diverse range of assets without cumbersome trust procedures. The project\u2019s product architecture incorporates five decentralised layers, governed by an open payment consensus protocol adaptable to major public chains and layer 2 networks. This approach streamlines merchant onboarding, reconciliation, and settlements, and enhances the overall value proposition.Security is paramount for Retik Finance, with a robust credit scoring architecture ensuring a comprehensive and reliable approach to credit assessment. Emphasising sustainability through consensus mechanisms, Retik fosters innovation and growth within its ecosystem. Utilising a decentralised operational support infrastructure, the platform aims for cost-effectiveness and high efficiency through the implementation of smart contracts.As a cost-effective Ethereum alternative, Retik Finance has garnered attention for its potential to yield quick 15x profits. With CertiK audit certification, a presence on reputable platforms like CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, and as of writing trades at a cheap price of $0.080 in presale stage 6, Retik Finance has witnessed significant momentum. Selling out 220 million RETIK tokens in under 8 weeks and accumulating $13.15 million, experts project that the platform, as it nears its Q3 2024 listing, is positioned for a rapid 15x profit surge fueled by increased momentum and adoption.\n\nRipple (XRP): Whales Amass as Regulatory Dynamics Unfold\n\n\n\nIn recent weeks, Ripple (XRP) has been in the spotlight due to significant developments surrounding its regulatory status. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) offered a settlement that would categorise XRP as a security. However, Ripple firmly stands its ground, asserting that XRP is not a security. This regulatory uncertainty has led XRP whales to start accumulating tokens, amassing a staggering 360 million virtually overnight.Binance\u2019s announcement of introducing XRP trading pairs against USDC further fueled the buying spree among XRP whales. Despite its cheap current trading price of $0.5077, a 14% increase compared to one month ago, experts project a potential surge to $0.85 by the end of January 2024, positioning XRP as an Ethereum alternative primed for quick 15x profits.While regulatory challenges pose a risk, the strategic moves by major platforms and the anticipation of an upward spiral signal potential opportunities for those eyeing quick profits within the XRP market.\n\nCardano (ADA): Charting a Bullish Trajectory\n\n\n\nCardano (ADA) has been garnering attention for its potential to follow Ethereum\u2019s footsteps in terms of profitability. Analysts predict a potential rise to $7 or even $15, drawing parallels between ADA\u2019s current behaviour and its late 2020 patterns. Notably, Dan Gambardello, founder of Crypto Capital Venture, highlights ADA\u2019s enhanced functionalities in the current market compared to the previous bull run.Gambardello emphasises Cardano\u2019s growth in the decentralised finance (DeFi) landscape since 2021, drawing parallels between ADA and Ethereum\u2019s historical development. He also points out Cardano\u2019s preparations for the next bull run, noting a bottoming-out structure before the upcoming Bitcoin Halving event. This cooling-off period for ADA is seen as notably bullish, potentially signalling an imminent upward move.As of writing, ADA trades cheaply at $0.4596 and is positioned as an Ethereum alternative, also viewed by experts as having the potential for quick 15x profits, showcasing the optimism surrounding its future trajectory.\n\nConclusion: Diverse Paths to Profits in the Crypto Universe\n\n\n\nRetik Finance, Ripple (XRP), and Cardano (ADA) represent three distinct paths within the crypto universe, each with its unique set of features and potential for profitability.

        "title": "Ethereum co-founders knew ETH was a security from the get-go, insider says - CoinGeek",
        "content": "An Ethereum insider says the network\u2019s co-founders knew all too well that their 2014 token crowdsale involved unregistered securities and relied on friends in government to keep them out of trouble.\n\nLast November, Steven Nerayoff released an audio recording of several phone conversations he had with Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin in April 2015, several months before the Ethereum blockchain officially mined its genesis block. Nerayoff, a former legal advisor to the Ethereum Foundation, says he\u2019d been tasked with assessing the network\u2019s problems and proposing a \u2018restructure plan\u2019 to ensure its long-term survival.\n\nNerayoff had teased the release of the recordings for weeks in advance, claiming that Ethereum insiders like Buterin and Joseph Lubin are involved in \u201cthe biggest fraud of our lives.\u201d Unfortunately, the recording (full transcript viewable here) proved a bit of a letdown on that front, although Nerayoff claimed shortly before its release that evidence of said fraud will be detailed in a lawsuit he intends to file at some future date.\n\nWhat the recording did show was just how out of his depth Buterin was at the time. Having just turned 21, Buterin was clearly overwhelmed by Ethereum\u2019s haphazard organizational structure and its dwindling financial resources.\n\nThe controversial crowdsale of ETH tokens the previous summer had brought in over 30,000 BTC tokens worth over $18 million at the time. But the failure of Ethereum\u2019s leadership to deliver on many of the pre-sale promises they\u2019d made to the roughly 9,000 participants had left many of the latter feeling betrayed by Buterin, Lubin, and the other co-founders.\n\nAs Nerayoff explained to Buterin, a lot of these crowdsale participants were \u201cnot wealthy people \u2026 they\u2019re young people that have sold their Bitcoin and put their savings into this thinking this is the next best thing. These people are not going to be happy if this thing goes below par, so to speak. So one issue is, you must not only keep the organization going, you must keep Ether above par.\u201d\n\nNerayoff added that he was \u201cfairly convinced that securities laws and these other laws have been tripped. And so the question \u2026 is anybody going to come after you? And the likelihood of that diminishes greatly if the price of Ether stays above par and people don\u2019t lose money.\u201d\n\nButerin never pushes back against these observations, likely because he understood the reality of Nerayoff\u2019s argument. But Nerayoff\u2019s suggestion that Buterin had the power to boost the price of ETH\u2014and Buterin\u2019s apparent acknowledgment of this reality\u2014ticks another box on the Howey test for determining whether assets are securities.\n\n\"At this point, if you're investing in Ethereum, I would say you're investing in the team and community.\"\n\n\u2013@VitalikButerin pic.twitter.com/DGBF8VMgRp \u2014 Pledditor (@Pledditor) November 16, 2023\n\nFor those who might argue that inference isn\u2019t evidence, consider that in March 2014, Buterin gave a presentation on Ethereum at the Texas Bitcoin Conference in Austin. In a sideline interview, he ticked more Howey boxes by telling would-be crowdsale participants that not only was ETH considered an \u2018investment,\u2019 but \u201cif you\u2019re investing in Ethereum, I would say you\u2019re investing in the team and the community.\u201d\n\nPapering the cracks\n\nNerayoff wasn\u2019t the only Ethereum insider who believed ETH met the criteria for an unregistered security. Nerayoff posted screenshots of emails from July 2014 detailing a conversation between Lubin and Jeffrey Alberts, a partner at the law firm Pryor Cashman (CC\u2019d were Buterin, Nerayoff, and another Pryor Cashman partner, Bertrand Fry).\n\nLubin speaks of the need to acquire \u201ca strong opinion letter\u201d that would leave Ethereum insiders \u201cwell insulated from criminal liability regarding securities laws\u201d should they permit U.S. residents to participate in the crowdsale that was then only a week away. (Lubin later publicly celebrated this \u201cpiece of paper in our pocket\u201d as having legally immunized the crowdsale in advance.)\n\nAlberts replies that while the opinion letter \u201cprobably does give you a defense under certain circumstances,\u201d there was no legal defense against fraud. Based on Alberts\u2019 advice, the Ethereum Foundation reserved $1 million from the crowdsale proceeds to cover potential legal bills.\n\nIn mid-December, Nerayoff sat for an interview with attorney John E. Deaton and offered additional evidence of ETH\u2019s security status. Nerayoff displayed an \u2018opinion party certificate\u2019 from Pryor Cashman that lists what Nerayoff called \u201ccertain requirements that Ethereum is attesting to (to the law firm) in order for the opinion to be valid. Vitalik signed that. One of those [requirements] was not held up to be valid.\u201d\n\nPer Pryor Cashman\u2019s instructions, the Ethereum Foundation agreed to issue 60 million ETH (the same amount sold via the crowdsale) to blockchain reward miners over a 40-month period so that the distribution of tokens would be balanced.\n\nThe exact wording of this stipulation read: \u201cAn amount of Ether equal to 30% of the Pre-Sale Amount will be issued annually to blockchain miners, with the result that blockchain miners are expected to have received, by roughly three years and four months after the launch of the genesis block, an amount of Ether equal to the Pre-Sale Amount.\u201d\n\nAccording to Nerayoff, \u201ceffectively, what they were saying was, \u2018we\u2019re not decentralized, and in order to become decentralized, we need to balance it out with the miners.\u2019 The problem with that analysis is that, if you go out three years and four months, they issued less than half of that, which means the opinion letter\u2019s no good and [ETH is] probably a security.\u201d\n\nPumping Joe\u2019s bags\n\nEthereum\u2019s crowdsale is widely regarded as a fundamentally flawed procedure in which a relative handful of whales\u2014less than 100\u2014snapped up as much as 40% of the available tokens. Lubin himself informed these whales in advance that they wouldn\u2019t be subjected to any real scrutiny should they wish to purchase more than the stated 12.5% maximum available to any one buyer. (There\u2019s also evidence that Ethereum issued 168,000 additional ETH via its ICO than the amount Buterin claimed on Github at the time.)\n\nA couple of years ago, former Ethereum developer Lane Rettig claimed that maybe 60% of all ETH in existence was still the product of the premine and that Lubin was \u201cprobably the largest holder\u201d of ETH following the crowdsale. Rettig said the premine was \u201cthe biggest reason I left Ethereum,\u201d adding that this belated realization that his work was ultimately responsible for \u201cpumping Joe Lubin\u2019s bags\u201d was \u201cjust not what I want to do.\u201d\n\nAt the Consensus 2022 event, Lubin was asked to clarify the size of his bags. Lubin refused to offer specifics but claimed that his ETH holdings have \u201cnever been even close to even half a percent\u201d of the total supply. But as Nerayoff noted to Deaton, Lubin didn\u2019t say it was \u201cnever more than half a percent,\u201d and Lubin\u2019s phrasing doesn\u2019t rule out the possibility that he holds 40% of the total supply, which is objectively not close to half a percent.\n\nNerayoff told Deaton that it was \u201ctwo parties, maybe it was three parties, that bought the vast majority of all the ETH\u201d in the crowdsale. Nerayoff further claimed that these same few parties were also \u201cmining the vast majority of the ETH\u201d right up until Ethereum\u2019s \u2018Merge,\u2019\n\naka the 2022 shift from a proof-of-work consensus mechanism to one based on proof-of-stake.\n\nIn Nerayoff\u2019s view, the fact that the miners receiving ETH via block rewards were also the biggest ETH crowdsale participants meant the network had become more centralized over time, making a mockery of its public proclamations of seeking greater decentralization. (That ship has now permanently sailed, given the post-Merge whale-favoring design of staking-based transaction validation.)\n\nEnter the Hinman\n\nGovernment agencies are notoriously slow off the mark, but other Ethereum insiders expressed similar concerns that the crowdsale would eventually provoke the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to act. Vinay Gupta, who worked as project manager on strategy and communications for Ethereum\u2019s 2015 launch, was sufficiently worried to discuss the matter with his own attorneys.\n\nThe attorneys told Gupta that ETH was indeed an unregistered security and \u201cyou can\u2019t massively profit from this at the same time that you\u2019re selling it to people.\u201d Gupta was advised to either divest himself of his ETH holdings or move to a jurisdiction without an extradition treaty with the United States.\n\nGupta chose the former and now says his decision to divest cost him an estimated $56 million. Still, how was he to know Ethereum had men on the inside ensuring the SEC would take no action against it?\n\nIn June 2018, William Hinman, then-director of the SEC\u2019s corporation finance division, gave a now-infamous speech at the Yahoo Finance All Markets Summit on the topic of \u201cwhether a digital asset offered as a security can, over time, become something other than a security.\u201d\n\nIn this speech, Hinman declared that \u201cputting aside the fundraising that accompanied the creation of Ether, based on my understanding of the present state of Ether, the Ethereum network and its decentralized structure, current offers and sales of Ether are not securities transactions.\u201d As such, Hinman believed that \u201capplying the disclosure regime of the federal securities laws to current transactions in Ether would seem to add little value.\u201d\n\nThis speech has come under renewed scrutiny in recent years, in part due to the SEC\u2019s suit against Ripple Labs over whether its XRP token is an unregistered security. Internal SEC documents disclosed in that suit reveal internal debate amongst SEC execs regarding Hinman\u2019s Ethereum comments prior to his speech, including whether they reflected broader SEC policy or simply Hinman\u2019s personal views.\n\nThe fact that Hinman himself referred to the speech as the \u2018Ether speech\u2019 in SEC emails\u2014despite his also referencing the BTC token in the same speech\u2014raises additional questions as to his motivations in crafting it. As does his June 4, 2018 email stating that he was planning \u201ca call with Buterin later this week to confirm our understanding of how the Ethereum Foundation operates.\u201d (Hinman would later deny under oath that he communicated with anyone other than SEC staff regarding the substance of the speech.)\n\nConflicted much?\n\nBefore joining the SEC in May 2017, Hinman was a partner at the Simpson Thacher & Barlettt law firm. That same year, the firm became a member of the Ethereum Enterprise Alliance (EEA), a group formed to \u201cbuild, promote, and broadly support Ethereum-based technology.\u201d\n\nHinman left the SEC in December 2020 and quickly rejoined Simpson Thacher as a senior advisor. It was later revealed that Hinman was paid millions of dollars from Simpson Thacher during his SEC tenure, money that a source close to Hinman described as part of Hinman\u2019s pension from the firm. However, the majority of it appears to have come via partnership income, aka profit sharing.\n\nSimpson Thacher quietly left the EEA in the spring of 2022, later declaring that its \u201cminimal involvement\u201d with the group was \u201cpurely educational, to gain a better understanding of blockchain technology.\u201d\n\nBut the exit dovetailed with the whistleblowers group Empower Oversight finally receiving SEC emails they\u2019d sought via freedom of information access requests. The emails showed the SEC ethics office warning Hinman early on about his \u2018retirement benefits\u2019 being based on Simpson Thacher\u2019s future profits, which could give him \u201ca financial interest in the firm\u2019s profitability while you are in government.\u201d\n\nThe SEC ethics office warned Hinman that this \u201cfuture interest is enough to give you a full financial interest in the firm,\u201d and thus, he should recuse himself from any matters in which Simpson Thacher stood to benefit. Despite this warning, Hinman met with another Simpson Thacher partner at least three times during his time on the SEC payroll.\n\nThe SEC ethics officials continued to press Hinman in January 2018, saying \u201c[i]t occurs to us that you have a full financial conflict with your old firm, not just an impartiality one.\u201d The SEC warned Hinman not to have \u201cany meetings with your old firm, even group meetings.\u201d\n\nAnd yet, Hinman met with Simpson Thacher partner Chris Lin in August 2019 so that Lin could \u201creport what is going on in China.\u201d At the time, Lin represented Canaan, a China-based block reward mining firm that Simpson Thacher helped take public in November 2019.\n\nHow did Hinman get away with this flagrant ignoring of ethics guardrails? It didn\u2019t help that in 2021, Carl Hoecker, the SEC official tasked with investigations of wrongdoing by agency staff, was found guilty of \u201cserious misconduct\u201d following an Integrity Committee probe that began in November 2017. Predictably, Hoecker\u2019s punishment was limited to a brief suspension without pay, after which he went back to doing his heckuva job keeping watch over other SEC execs until May 2022.\n\nSay it ain\u2019t so, Joe\n\nIn 2020, Lubin told a podcast that Ethereum \u201carrived on the scene before regulators were watching,\u201d and the co-founders had been \u201cfortunate enough to be able to frame our token as a utility token\u201d by the time regulators began watching.\n\nThe year before, Lubin told a conference audience that \u201cwe are big friends and fans of [the SEC]. I think they\u2019re really understanding the space well.\u201d Lubin described how the SEC had \u201cintroduced a new construct\u2013decentralization\u2013into their thinking,\u201d and thus, no Ethereum transactions \u201care considered to be transactions of securities.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt that Hinman had been lobbied hard on this \u2018decentralization\u2019 angle ahead of his June 2018\u2032 Ether speech.\u2019 Emails show Lubin pushing to meet with SEC execs\u2014including Hinman\u2014with the first meeting taking place in December 2017.\n\nThis full-court press quickly gained pace, as the court-ordered release of Hinman\u2019s calendar of appointments shows. Between March 29 and April 23, 2018, Hinman met twice with Lubin and individuals associated with ConsenSys, Lubin\u2019s Ethereum-based blockchain software outfit. Two other Hinman meetings show the subject of discussion was \u2018ETH\u2019 or \u2018Ether.\u2019\n\nThat March, the Andreessen Horowitz venture capital group\u2014a major investor in Ethereum-based projects\u2014submitted a white paper to the SEC proposing a \u2018safe harbor\u2019 for \u2018decentralized\u2019 tokens. The paper singled out ETH as \u201ca good example of this type of protocol token that has become so decentralized it should not be deemed a Security.\u201d\n\nIn September 2019, Cooley LLP attorney Nancy Woitas appeared on a crypto regulation panel and referenced Hinman\u2019s speech, saying, \u201cmost of what he says in there came out of the safe harbor, as well as the meetings that we had with him.\u201d\n\nLowell Ness, a partner at Perkins Coie, told a BlockCon audience that he wrote the material presented to the SEC in the safe harbor paper. Ness added that the firms who attended an April 2018 meeting with SEC officials were taken aback by the \u201cinteresting dichotomy\u201d between the SEC\u2019s public tough talk re \u2018crypto\u2019 enforcement versus \u201cthis interesting sort of welcome that we got privately.\u201d\n\nFor the record, both Cooley and Perkins Coie belonged to the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance.\n\nAlso, for the record, on June 2021, Andreessen Horowitz announced that it had added Hinman as an advisory partner to its $2 billion \u2018a16z crypto\u2019 fund.\n\nSham Master Jay\n\nHinman\u2019s boss at the SEC was then-chairman Jay Clayton. Clayton\u2019s tenure was marked by a significant number of civil actions against projects involving initial coin offerings (ICOs), nearly all of which occurred on Ethereum. And yet, Ethereum somehow escaped censure for enabling this illegality.\n\nIn February 2018, Clayton told the Senate banking committee that \u201cevery ICO I\u2019ve seen is a security\u2026 Those who engage in semantic gymnastics or elaborate re-structuring exercises in an effort to avoid having a coin be a security are squarely in the crosshairs of our enforcement provision.\u201d And yet, Ethereum\u2019s own deeply flawed ICO and its subsequent failure to decentralize got the thumbs-up from Hinman just four months after Clayton made that statement.\n\nClayton was a partner at the Sullivan & Cromwell (S&C) law firm (of FTX fame) before his SEC stint and rejoined the firm after leaving government. It\u2019s unclear when the relationship began, but at some point, Lubin hired S&C to advise ConsenSys on regulatory matters, including its various funding rounds.\n\nIn his July 2021 deposition in the Ripple suit, Hinman was specifically asked whether he\u2019d had any communications with Clayton regarding Hinman\u2019s pre-speech meetings with Lubin and other ConsenSys officials. Hinman admitted having communicated with Clayton regarding the ConsenSys meetings \u201conce or twice.\u201d\n\nLike Hinman, Clayton\u2019s devotion to The Cause went neither unnoticed nor unrewarded. In March 2021, the One River Digital Asset Management firm\u2014which in December 2020 bought around $600 million worth of ETH and BTC and announced plans to boost that sum to $1 billion by early 2021\u2014added Clayton to its advisory council.\n\nAn interesting footnote regarding the dynamic duo of Clayton and Hinman. The pair both worked on the 2014 initial public offering of Chinese tech giant Alibaba (NASDAQ: BABAF) as the point people for their respective law firms. A mere three years later, Alibaba would be responsible for 10% of global blockchain-related patent applications.\n\nETHgate\n\nWhile his stint as SEC chair was due to run through June 2021, Clayton opted to resign on December 23, 2020 (less than three weeks after Hinman made his own premature exit).\n\nThat same day, the SEC sued Ripple Labs for offering unregistered securities.\n\nIn 2021, documents filed by the SEC in its suit v. Ripple indicated that \u201con approximately April 13, 2018, staff in the SEC\u2019s newly-formed Cyber Unit began investigating whether Ripple\u2019s and others\u2019 conduct violated the federal securities laws.\u201d On April 12, 2018, Hinman emailed Lubin to say he\u2019d \u201cgreatly enjoyed\u201d meeting Lubin and his team and wondering if \u201cwe could have a brief call in order to discuss the possibility of another meeting?\u201d\n\nThe alleged favoritism the SEC showed Ethereum while aggressively targeting rival protocols such as Ripple has become known as \u2018ETHgate\u2019 among Ripple supporters. To be sure, CoinGeek can hardly be described as Ripple fans, seeing little difference between XRP, ETH, and any of the other bazillion \u2018alt-coins\u2019 that emerged in the 15 years since Satoshi Nakamoto released his Bitcoin white paper.\n\nBut as the saying goes, just because you\u2019re paranoid doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t after you.\n\nThe empire strikes back\n\nNerayoff\u2019s public re-emergence onto the digital asset stage followed a failed attempt by the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) to put the former Ethereum insider inside a prison cell for a long, long time.\n\nIn 2017, Nerayoff worked as an advisor for some of the countless Ethereum-based projects that launched ICOs that year. In September 2019, Nerayoff and his alleged co-conspirator, Michael Hlady (aka Michael Peters), were arrested and charged with attempting to extort millions of dollars from a Seattle-based token project. (The project goes unidentified in court docs but was long ago outed as StormX.)\n\nNerayoff, who\u2019d signed a deal to assist StormX in launching its ICO, was accused of shaking down StormX\u2019s founders for millions more in cash and tokens than their original agreement called for, with Hlady allegedly issuing veiled threats of violence to compel the founders to agree. An FBI director called it \u201can age-old extortion scheme \u2026 with a modern day twist.\u201d\n\nWhile Hlady pleaded guilty in April 2021, Nerayoff maintained his innocence from the start. Nerayoff claimed he\u2019d been set up by Hlady, who Nerayoff alleged was an established conman who\u2019d stolen hundreds of thousands of dollars from him. Nerayoff further claimed that Hlady was a government informant who\u2019d exchanged 100 text messages and 45 phone calls with a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agent during the period in which the alleged extortion was said to have occurred.\n\nNerayoff was ultimately vindicated in May 2023 after the DoJ abruptly filed a motion to dismiss the indictment with prejudice, citing \u201cmaterial exculpatory evidence obtained by the government well after return of the Indictment\u201d and \u201csubsequent investigation based on that evidence.\u201d The Department of Justice (DOJ) concluded that it was \u201cunable to prove the charges in the Indictment beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d\n\nAmong this exculpatory evidence were Skype video recordings of meetings between Nerayoff and StormX founders that, in Nerayoff\u2019s lawyers\u2019 view, \u201cclearly establish that not only were the agreements entered into freely, the parties\u2019 dealings were entirely cordial.\u201d Nerayoff\u2019s lawyers noted that some of the exculpatory evidence had \u201cbeen in the government\u2019s possession since sometime in February 2019,\u201d seven months before the complaint was filed.\n\nThe dismissal brought a halt to a motion filed by Nerayoff\u2019s team one month prior that sought to compel the government to produce certain evidence related to his case. Nerayoff claimed that the government had tried to strongarm him into helping them bring criminal cases against some prominent figures within the blockchain sector. Nerayoff said he refused to cooperate despite the government\u2019s suggestion that doing so could shave years off the sentence he\u2019d receive on the extortion charge.\n\nSelective outrage\n\nDespite Nerayoff declining to throw anyone under the bus to save his own skin, at least one of Ethereum\u2019s co-founders doesn\u2019t appear all that grateful. Last September, Buterin was asked by journalist Laura Shin about some of Nerayoff\u2019s recent claims. Buterin said that in 2015, he was still too young and na\u00efve to \u201cdetect the problems in someone like Steven Nerayoff.\u201d\n\nButerin went on to say that the Ethereum Foundation had since \u201csuccessfully distanced ourselves\u201d from \u201cbad characters that caused us a lot of damage.\u201d Buterin claimed Nerayoff was involved in \u201chuge amounts of, like, fraud and behaving in \u2026 ways that made women around him very uncomfortable at the very least \u2026 That\u2019s a shady character, man.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear what Buterin is referencing here re \u2018uncomfortable women.\u2019 Granted, Nerayoff has spoken favorably of Andrew Tate, the U.K. kickboxer turned misogynist-for-profit and multilevel marketing scammer. Nerayoff has clarified that his empathy for Tate has more to do with Tate allegedly being subjected to the kind of \u2018bogus\u2019 charges that Nerayoff says he endured via the \u201cunchecked power of governments.\u201d\n\nRegardless, Buterin compared Nerayoff unfavorably to Virgil Griffith, the former Ethereum developer currently doing time in a U.S. federal prison after ignoring warnings not to travel to North Korea to educate regime officials on how \u2018crypto\u2019 could help them evade U.S. economic sanctions. Buterin said he couldn\u2019t say bad things about Griffith \u201cjust because he was, uh, you know, more geopolitically open-minded than a lot of other people.\u201d\n\nButerin\u2019s blinkered devotion to Griffith ignores the grotesque human rights violations that North Korea\u2019s regime inflicts on its own people. Just last week, two teenagers were\n\nsentenced to 12 years of hard labor simply for watching South Korean television dramas. It seems that in Buterin\u2019s world, Kim Jong-un is less of a \u2018shady character\u2019 than Nerayoff. High praise, indeed.\n\nOnly the beginning\n\nNerayoff appears nowhere near done shaking Ethereum\u2019s tree, telling Deaton that he has \u201ca lot of recordings\u201d from the period of his involvement with the Ethereum Foundation.\n\nNerayoff closed his Deaton interview with the bombshell that the 2016 hack of The DAO\u2014in which nearly 15% of all ETH in circulation was stolen from a decentralized autonomous organization and resulted in the controversial fork of the blockchain\u2014was \u201can inside job by members of the Ethereum Foundation.\u201d\n\nWhile Nerayoff had made this claim prior to the interview, he explained to Deaton that \u201cwhoever was controlling the Bitcoin wallet [from the crowdsale] is directly implicated, but it had to involve quite a number of people, so there was no DAO hack. That was a complete inside job. They benefited from it in a whole host of different ways.\u201d\n\nNerayoff said he wasn\u2019t going to offer up any \u201cindividual accusations\u201d during the interview but did say that \u201cone of the wallets connected to a certain individual communicated with the hacker\u2019s wallet 10 days before\u201d the hack. \u201cAnother one of the individuals at the Ethereum Foundation set up the contract for the hack and set up the wallets \u2026 There\u2019s a lot more. I\u2019m just giving you some anecdotal stuff.\u201d\n\nNerayoff added that the so-called \u2018DAO Report\u2019 issued by the SEC in 2017 detailing the fallout from the hack\u2014and which declined to \u201cpursue an enforcement action in this matter\u201d\u2014was allegedly written by none other than Bill Hinman.\n\nElsewhere, other blockchain analysts believe they\u2019ve connected the 2016 hack of the Gatecoin exchange to wallets linked to the Ethereum Foundation. But that\u2019s a subject for the next installment in our ongoing series delving into the shady dealings that seem to surround Ethereum, the insiders who\u2019ve profited from it, and the network\u2019s deep ties to China.

        "content": "Celsius has transferred ETH worth over a billion dollars to Coinbase, FalconX and Paxos.\n\nEarlier this month, the bankrupt crypto lender started \u201crebalancing assets\u201d ahead of creditor repayments.\n\nUsers have been able to withdraw funds held in Celsius Custody accounts since last year, but interest-bearing Earn accounts are subject to a different repayment plan.\n\nUnder its court-approved bankruptcy plan, Celsius started repaying users last year, but many creditors still haven\u2019t received a single scent.\n\nHowever, recent developments have sparked hopes that further payouts are imminent. Earlier this month, Celsius unlocked more than 200,000 staked ETH. Now, the bankrupt crypto lender has sent a billion dollars worth of crypto to various exchanges.\n\nCelsius Wallet Transfers 460,000 ETH\n\nOver the course of about an hour on Thursday, January 25, a Celsius wallet transferred around 460,000 ETH worth more than a billion dollars toCoinbase, Paxos and FalconX.\n\nThe largest recipient was a Coinbase Prime deposit address which received 297,000 ETH. alongside smaller denominations of USDC (<$100,000). A further 147,000 ETH was sent to Paxos and 7,800 ETH to FalconX.\n\nAccording to Arkham Intelligence, known Celsius wallets still hold assets worth over $700 million.\n\nWhy Have Some Celsius Users Been Paid But Others Are Still Waiting?\n\nIn June 2022, Celsius suspended withdrawals for all users who held assets on the platform.\n\nThroughout the ensuing bankruptcy proceedings, the court approved separate repayment types for different groups of Celsius users. Judge Martin Glenn deemed that certain funds held in non-interest-bearing Custody accounts belonged to the account holder.\n\nThe ruling only applied to deposits that weren\u2019t commingled with other assets, and which hadn\u2019t been transferred from an interest-bearing account in the 100 days before the the platform\u2019s suspension. Withdrawals for this specific group opened up in March last year. The remaining Custody account assets were released in November, subject to the terms of Celsius\u2019 settlement agreement.\n\nHowever, Celsius users who had funds in interest-bearing Earn accounts are still waiting to recover their assets. According to Celsius\u2019 bankruptcy plan, Earn creditors will receive payment in Bitcoin and Ether based on their account balance, when withdrawals were suspended.\n\nCreditor Payments Incoming?\n\nIn a post on X earlier this month, Celsius said it had started \u201cstarted the process of recalling and rebalancing assets to ensure ample liquidity.\u201d Accordingly, the latest Ether transactions appear to suggest that more creditor payments are imminent.\n\nAlthough Celsius hasn\u2019t officially confirmed when it will begin distributing payments to Earn creditors, Ionic Digital, which emerged out of Celsius\u2019 post-bankruptcy restructuring, has reported that disbursements are expected to start in mid-February. Eligible creditors will have a one-year window to withdraw their funds, the firm added."
