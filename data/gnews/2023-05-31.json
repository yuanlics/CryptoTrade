So from that perspective, they are dapps in the sense that there are a multitude of other addresses/contracts interacting with applications such as WETH, OpenSea, Circle and Tether.\u201d"

        "title": "'Bitcoin Jesus' says Ethereum is the front-runner for global crypto adoption - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Early Bitcoin (BTC) investor and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) advocate Roger Ver claimed that Ethereum, not Bitcoin, will be responsible for driving the bulk of new users towards crypto.\n\nOn a May 31 episode of the Show Me The Crypto podcast, Ver \u2014 labeled \u201cBitcoin Jesus\u201d for his early Bitcoin advocacy \u2014 said that despite Ethereum\u2019s scaling issues and the other layer-one \u201cclones\u201d that have popped up in its wake, the Ethereum ecosystem is still where the action is:\n\n\u201cEven though Ethereum doesn\u2019t have the biggest market cap compared to Bitcoin, I think Ethereum is the front-runner in terms of driving worldwide adoption.\u201d\n\nVer praised the rise of Ethereum Virtual Machine-compatible (EVM) blockchains and layer-2 scaling solutions such as Polygon (MATIC) that can help share some of the load away from the main chain.\n\nVer provides an account of the \u201ccivil war\u201d that occurred in the early days of Bitcoin between Etheruem\u2019s co-founder Vitalik Buterin and Bitcoin core developers.\n\nDisagreements over the use of smart contracts and moving away from the idea of blockchains being used purely as currency or stores of value eventually drove Buterin to develop Ethereum, Ver noted:\n\n\u201cAll of that would have been built on top of Bitcoin if not for the scaling civil war that happened. These Bitcoin core developers hate Vitalik, and they basically drove him from the project to go and create Ethereum, and more power to him for that.\u201d\n\nVer also spoke on the recent Ledger debate, calling the controversial Recover service \u201cdisappointing.\u201d The service allows users to store their encrypted seed phase with external custodians to safeguard against loss; Ver said that while it\u2019s fine for people to have custodial accounts and choose to recover their keys if they wish, the ethos of crypto is centered on having full control of your assets at all times.\n\nRelated: Hybrid rollups: The silver bullet for scalability and security on Ethereum\n\nIn January, Ver was sued by a trading unit of the crypto lending firm Genesis for failing to pay some $20.8 million in unsettled crypto options.\n\nVer claimed in a January Reddit post that he had \u201csufficient funds\u201d to pay the outstanding sum but argued that because Genesis was no longer solvent, he was not legally required to uphold his end of the deal.\n\nLast year, Ver made headlines for allegations of defaulting on a debt. CoinFLEX CEO Mark Lamb claimed Ver owed the firm $47 million USD Coin (USDC) and was bound by a written contract. On June 28, Ver denied these claims without directly mentioning the company.\n\nMagazine: Ordinals turned Bitcoin into a worse version of Ethereum \u2014 Can we fix it?"

        "title": "Ethereum Price is Primed For a Rally And Only 1 Thing is Holding it Back - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Ethereum price is correcting gains from the $1,920 resistance against the US Dollar. ETH could start a fresh rally if it clears the $1,920 and $1,930 resistance levels.\n\nEthereum is still struggling to clear the $1,920 resistance zone.\n\nThe price is trading above $1,880 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere is a crucial bullish trend line forming with support near $1,890 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair could start a substantial decline if it breaks the $1,870 support.\n\nEthereum Price Reaches Key Support\n\nEthereum\u2019s price started a downside correction after it failed to clear the $1,920 resistance zone. ETH corrected lower below the $1,900 level, similar to Bitcoin.\n\nThere was a move below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the key increase from the $1,836 swing low to the $1,930 high. However, the bulls were active above the $1,870 support zone. There is also a crucial bullish trend line forming with support near $1,890 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.\n\nEther is now trading above $1,880 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. Immediate resistance is near the $1,920 zone. The next major resistance is near the $1,930 level.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nA proper move above the $1,920 and $1,930 resistance levels might send Ether toward $2,000. The next resistance sits near $2,050, above which Ethereum could rise toward $2,120. Any more gains above the $2,120 resistance zone might send the price toward the $2,250 resistance. An intermediate resistance might be $2,200.\n\nDownside Break in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $1,920 resistance, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,890 level and the trend line.\n\nThe next major support is near the $1,870 zone or the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. It is close to the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the key increase from the $1,836 swing low to the $1,930 high. If there is a close below the $1,870 support, the price could decline toward the $1,840 support. Any more losses may perhaps send the price toward the $1,800 level or even $1,780 in the coming sessions.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bearish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is below the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $1,870\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $1,920\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.
