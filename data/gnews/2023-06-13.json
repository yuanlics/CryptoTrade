        "summary": "  In a recent court decision, the plaintiffs sued Kim Kardashian, Floyd Mayweather, and former professional basketball player Paul Pierce for endorsing the Ethereum Max (EMAX) cryptocurrency without disclosing that they were paid to do so. The court provided guidance on social influencer advertising and found that the #AD disclaimer in Kardashian's post was clear that she was being paid, even though it appeared towards the bottom of the post. The court also weighed in on a so-called dark pattern in Kardashian's post, which created a false sense of scarcity. Mayweather's statement at a conference was found to be puffery and not a measurable, objective statement of fact. The court rejected the plaintiffs' argument that Mayweather had a duty to disclose that he was being paid by EMAX's founders when he wore certain articles of EMAX clothing and allowed EMAX to exploit his name and likeness. The court also found that the relevant information was not disclosed anywhere by anyone, and consumers could not confirm or dispel the belief that the celebrities were being paid to"

This is not the first time Buterin has donated to Crypto Relief, as he previously allocated $100 million in 2022 to Covid-19 initiatives selected by Buterin. The donation comes in the form of USDC instead of physical cash to avoid capital gains tax.\n\nPros of crypto donations include avoiding capital gains tax and potentially receiving larger donations in crypto than in cash. Some nonprofits have established programs to immediately convert crypto gifts into liquid funds.\n\nCons of crypto donations include confusion for nonprofits on how to accept cryptocurrency or when to convert it into cash, as well as the unstable nature of the crypto market providing an additional layer of risk for institutions.

However, this poses significant risks to the Ethereum ecosystem, as Lido's market share has grown since the Shapella upgrade enabled staking withdrawals. Ethereum developers have warned about the dangers of staking \"cartelization,\" in which platforms like Lido can extract outsized profits compared to non-pooled capital. There is a growing movement to divest from Lido and explore alternative Ethereum staking options. Meanwhile, ETH price has taken a hit following last week's regulatory attacks on the industry, losing over 8% since the SEC sued Binance and Coinbase.
