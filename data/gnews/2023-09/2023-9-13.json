        "content": "The co-founder of Ethereum, Joseph Lubin, said \"clear heads will prevail\" as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission continues to dispute with crypto firms in court over whether crypto tokens are considered securities.\n\n\"I anticipate that, with previous technologies like the internet, the web and cryptography, clear heads will prevail,\" Lubin told CNBC's \"Capital Connection\" on Thursday.\n\n\"America will see that decentralized protocols, blockchain, cryptocurrency are aligned with the philosophies of the U.S. And I think much of the rest of the world will follow suit,\" said Lubin, who is also the CEO of blockchain technology company ConsenSys.\n\nCrypto firms such as Binance, Coinbase and Ripple are fighting lawsuits with the SEC, which has accused them of law violations.\n\nThe SEC sued Ripple and its co-founders in 2020 of violating securities laws by selling its native cryptocurrency XRP without first registering it with the SEC. Meanwhile, the SEC accused Coinbase of operating an unregistered exchange and broker in June. In the same month, Binance was charged for several securities law violations."

        "content": "Ethereum celebrates the one year anniversary of its transition to Proof-of-Stake on Friday.\n\nUnder Proof-of-Stake, the network has reduced global electricity demand by an amount equal to that of entire countries such as Myanmar and Slovakia.\n\nBut the Merge has done little to help some existing problems, such as a lack of client diversity.\n\nA year on from the Merge, Ethereum\u2019s landmark upgrade has bolstered the blockchain\u2019s public image and enhanced its green credentials. But issues of centralisation and technical diversity remain, according to developers and DeFi builders.\n\nSeptember 15 marks the one-year anniversary of the Merge, which, among other things, transitioned the leading smart contract network from the energy-intensive Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism to the greener Proof-of-Stake.\n\nUnder Proof-of-Stake, Ethereum has reduced global electricity demand by an amount equal to that of entire countries such as Myanmar and Slovakia in the year since the Merge.\n\nThat\u2019s according to data from The Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance, which says Ethereum\u2019s energy use dropped 99.99%, down from the estimated 21.41 terawatt hours of electricity it used the year before the Merge under Proof-of-Work.\n\nStay ahead of the game with our weekly newsletters Subscribe\n\nEthereum\u2019s new green credentials have had the biggest impact in the year since the transition.\n\n\u201cThe discussion changed a lot,\u201d Ethereum core developer Marius van der Wijden told DL News. \u201cIf you discussed crypto or Ethereum before the Merge, it immediately went to energy consumption and emissions.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow we can have good discussions about the merits of blockchain without having to discuss the environmental impacts,\u201d he added.\n\nNOW READ: Vesta Finance token soars 150% as DeFi protocol is rocked by rage quit proposal\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nAnd Van der Wijden isn\u2019t the only one to say so.\n\n\u201cNo longer being a wanton environmental polluter is a significant improvement to the blockchain\u2019s public image,\u201d Nick Ashley, marketing manager at Ether liquid staking provider Rocket Pool, told DL News. \u201cInstitutions can take Ethereum more seriously, with the option to earn a return on their holdings while complying with ESG policies.\u201d\n\nAshley also noted the increasing interest from universities, which are now more eager to participate in Ethereum\u2019s security and contribute to ongoing research and education.\n\nHowever, while many predicted that Ethereum might see increased investment interest after the Merge thanks in part to its energy use reduction, this has yet to materialise.\n\nData from Coinshares shows that institutional investment into Ethereum actually decreased by $108 million since the start of the year. In a September 11 report, Coinshares noted that Ethereum was the \u201cleast loved digital asset amongst exchange traded products investors this year.\u201d\n\nEconomic improvements\n\nAside from cutting carbon emissions, The Merge also cut issuance of Ethereum\u2019s native cryptocurrency Ether by about 95%. Under Proof-of-Work, the network paid out around 13,000 Ether a year to miners for securing the network. Under Proof-of-Stake, this figure dropped to 1,600 Ether annually.\n\nAccording to Ashley, this \u201csolved one of the most important problems of all by ensuring that Ethereum can remain sustainable in the long term.\u201d If the pre-Merge issuance continued, the supply of Ether would have grown indefinitely, diluting the market and providing stakers little incentive to lock up their Ether to secure the network.\n\nThe reduced emissions, combined with a previous upgrade which enabled the Ethereum network to burn a portion of transaction fees, has made Ether disinflationary over the past year \u2014 even more so during times of high network activity when more transaction fees are burned.\n\nWith Ether burned from transactions outpacing new emissions since the Merge, projections from Ethereum data platform ultrasound.money show the Ether supply is likely to find equilibrium at around 73 million, if the current yearly usage continues.\n\nSince the Merge, the Ethereum network has burned 300,000 Ether, worth approximately $480 million.\n\nEther supply since the Merge. (ultrasound.money/ultrasound.money)\n\nDiversity issues\n\nDespite the improvements to Ethereum\u2019s energy consumption and economic structure brought by the Merge, it also exacerbated an existing problem.\n\nAccording to Ethereum core developer Preston Van Loon, the lack of Ethereum client diversity following the Merge has been \u201cprominently discussed\u201d in developer circles.\n\nEthereum clients are pieces of software that run Ethereum and communicate over the network with other clients.\n\nVan Loon explained how shortly after the Merge, the Prysm client became dominant and exceeded a super majority above two-thirds of the entire Ethereum network.\n\nNOW READ: Compound founder Robert Leshner says \u2018institutions aren\u2019t coming\u2019 to DeFi\n\n\u201cHaving a single client representing more than two-thirds of the network was a considerable risk,\u201d Van Loon said. \u201cThe client could have a bug that may become finalised with the remaining third in disagreement.\u201d\n\n\u201cDiversity has improved significantly, but there is still room to improve, especially on the execution layer where Go Ethereum is an overwhelmingly dominant client,\u201d Van Loon added.\n\nAn Ether staking surge\n\nThe Merge, and the subsequent April 2023 Shanghai upgrade, also drove billions worth of Ether into staking \u2014 particularly liquid staking services such as those offered by Lido and Rocket Pool.\n\n\u201cEthereum\u2019s transition to Proof-of-Stake can be broken down into two phases, the Merge in September of last year and the Shanghai upgrade back in April,\u201d Marin Tvrdi\u0107, a business development contributor at Lido DAO, told DL News.\n\n\u201cThe biggest impact of this transition is the rapid growth of the liquid staking economy,\u201d he said.\n\nSince the Merge, deposits to liquid staking protocols have more than doubled. According to DefiLlama data, over $19 billion worth of Ether is currently staked through liquid staking protocols, with the biggest protocol, Lido, accounting for 73% of the market.\n\nLido dominates liquid staking derivatives with a 73% share of the market.\n\nTvrdi\u0107 also noted that the Merge has allowed staking protocols to focus on expanding access to staking, helping to consolidate Ethereum\u2019s overall decentralisation.\n\nVan Loon also highlighted how the switch to Proof-of-Stake has helped open up Ether staking not just for liquid staking protocols, but also for individuals by lowering barriers to entry. Under Proof-of-Work, only entities with sufficient hash power or operating mining pools had the privilege of building new blocks and verifying transactions.\n\nNOW READ: Speed-trading giant borrows Coinbase playbook in slamming Gary Gensler after SEC lawsuit\n\nNow, he explained, anyone with ordinary hardware and 32 Ether can become a block producer.\n\n\u201cUltimately, the switch has made Ethereum a more decentralised network,\u201d he said.\n\nTim Craig is DL News\u2019 Edinburgh-based DeFi Correspondent.

The highest count was registered on Dec. 9, 2022, aligning with Ether\u2019s reevaluation following its losses from the post-2021 bear market.\n\nAs a result, analysts at Santiment suggest that the Ether market may experience increased volatility, potentially leading to a recovery. Additionally, this uptick in on-chain activity indicates a growing demand for the underlying asset.\n\nThe #Ethereum network just saw 1,089,893 unique wallets acting as a sender or receiver of $ETH on Wednesday, the 2nd highest amount in the asset's 8+ year history.

Nevertheless, Ethereum maintains its position in the decentralized finance ecosystem and smart contract arena, securing around $20 billion in total value locked.\n\nEthereum remains attractive to institutional investors, as seen in the growing interest in spot exchange-traded funds. Additionally, the Ethereum network holds a central role in numerous blockchains due to its Ethereum Virtual Machine network. As a result, Ethereum\u2019s prospects seem largely optimistic, supported by the network\u2019s significant valuation, liquidity and strong trading activity.\n\nWhen it comes to analyzing Ether\u2019s price, it\u2019s worth noting that, despite being a prominent altcoin with unique fundamentals, ETH\u2019s price movement is still considerably impacted by Bitcoin (BTC). Throughout history, September, particularly before a halving event, has been recognized as a bearish period for the cryptocurrency market.\n\nRelated: Nasdaq\u2019s Hashdex mixed Ether ETF filing joins crypto ETF race\n\nThis might suggest that Ether\u2019s price will continue its decline in the upcoming weeks, potentially nearing the next support level at approximately $1,500.

This level of low-cost predictability helps make it an attractive network to explore efficiencies and cost savings for existing payment operations.\n\nIn [the figure] below, Solana clearly stands out from a cost perspective compared to Bitcoin and Ethereum, whose fees can fluctuate unpredictably based on demand for transactions to execute on the network. A network with unpredictable transaction costs can be more difficult for payment companies to manage within their products and can lead to confusing consumer experiences.\u201d\n\nVisa goes on to say that because of Solana\u2019s efficiency, they have decided to expand their stablecoin settlement program to include Solana as a means of testing the blockchain\u2019s capacity to meet the financial demands of modern corporations.\n\n\u201cSolana\u2019s unique technological advantages, including high throughput with parallel processing, low cost with localized fee markets and high resiliency with a significant number of nodes and multiple node clients, work together to create a scalable blockchain platform with a compelling value proposition for payments.\n\nThese are some of the reasons that we decided to expand our stablecoin settlement pilot to include transactions over the Solana network. As we pilot our stablecoin settlement functionality on Solana, we plan to test whether Solana has the ability to meet the demands of modern corporate treasury operations.\u201d\n\nSolana is trading for $18.39 at time of writing, a 2.19% increase during the last 24 hours.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "title": "What is the Future of Ethereum? We Analyze its Roadmap - Altcoin Buzz",
        "content": "The Ethereum network, which supports a sizable ecosystem of decentralized applications (dapps), has advanced significantly over the last couple of years.\n\nEthereum has been the pioneering force behind smart contracts, leading to ground-breaking innovations including DeFi), NFTs, the metaverse, and blockchain gaming. However, the rise in Ethereum\u2019s popularity led to problems such as high costs, high energy consumption, and scalability. In this article, we\u2019ll analyze Ethereum\u2019s Roadmap to know how the future will be for this important blockchain.\n\nA Journey of Upgrades\n\nEthereum\u2019s developers devised a grand plan to address these problems. They called that plan \u201cEthereum 2.0,\u201d which is a set of upgrades on the network. With these improvements, the network should become more resilient, scalable, safe, and effective for practical applications.\n\nSo, the changes in Ethereum 2.0 are intended to improve the performance of the Ethereum network in a number of areas. The adventure started in December 2020 with the Beacon Chain\u2019s launch. This update in particular introduced the concept of the Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism to the network.\n\nEthereum\u2019s developers didn\u2019t stop there. They proceeded with other enhancements. Next on their list were the Berlin and London upgrades, which came in 2021. These upgrades optimized gas fees and introduced Ethereum Improvement Proposal 1559 (EIP-1559).\n\n\ud83d\udfe0 The merge Ethereum merge merged the proof-of-stake testnet with the proof-of-work mainnet, converting the latter to PoS. The merge finished on 15 September 2022. And the last merge-related upgrade (Shanghai-Capella) concluded last week. 2/ https://t.co/N1RjRgJj4T \u2014 satvik.shm \u039e (@7vik_writes) April 17, 2023\n\nEthereum developers took things a notch higher in 2022 with the launch of the Gray Glacier, Bellatrix, and Paris upgrades\u2014collectively referred to as \u201cThe Merge\u201d. These effectively converted Ethereum from Proof of Work (PoW) to Proof of Stake (PoS), where validators who staked ETH took over from miners as the source of blocks. Here are some of the benefits of the merger:\n\nMinimized energy consumption.\n\nDecreased the net issuance of ETH.\n\nReduced block times (13.3s \u2192 12s).\n\nIt led to stronger finality.\n\nIntroduced yield.\n\nDistributed Validator Technology(DVT). This resulted in better decentralization.\n\nImproved security.\n\nCurious about what lies ahead for #Ethereum? In our latest #Binance Research report, we take a closer look at Ethereum's roadmap, highlighting some of the key phases and upgrades worth keeping an eye on. Read about them here \u2b07\ufe0fhttps://t.co/WNXegI1bhE \u2014 Binance Research (@BinanceResearch) September 4, 2023\n\nThe Shanghai Upgrade.\n\nThe Shanghai Upgrade in April 2023 was the most recent Ethereum update. This upgrade, which also included EIP-4895, enabled ETH validators to unlock their network-staked ETH. It improved ETH liquidity since it enabled people to access staked ETH and related rewards.\n\nNow let\u2019s look at what Ethereum\u2019s future looks like based on its roadmap.\n\nThe Surge\n\nThe surge intends to improve the Ethereum network\u2019s scalability and decentralization. It features the implementation of EIP-4944, also known as Proto Danksharding. This will enable a new format of transaction via \u201cdata blobs\u201d that can be seamlessly integrated into nodes and their processes.\n\n\ud83d\udfe0 The surge The Ethereum surge is a set of upgrades that will increase the speed of the blockchain and its L2 counterparts. This increase in scalability would solve the blockchain trilemma without compensating for network security. The main upgrade here will be sharding: 3/ https://t.co/HtkGxjCdOt \u2014 satvik.shm \u039e (@7vik_writes) April 17, 2023\n\nThe sharding method used by Ethereum divides transactions into numerous smaller batches, scaling the network horizontally, a process that is significantly simpler than enhancing a single machine.\n\nFor instance, it is more effective for 20 validators to validate five batches of 20 transactions each than it is for 100 validators to validate 1,000 transactions one at a time. Additionally, EIP-4844 establishes the foundation for transactions based on roll-up technology as well as resources that make it easier to create zero-knowledge scaling solutions. This phase will increase the scalability of the Ethereum network from 15 TPS to 100,000 TPS.\n\nThe Scrouge\n\nThe Scrouge upgrade seeks to prioritize decentralization and address protocol risks related to Maximum Extractable Value (MEV). It is the highest possible value that can be obtained from manipulating the order of transactions in a block above the recognized gas fees and block reward.\n\nMany in #DePin space have suggested the future will be nodes run from mob devices. @VitalikButerin advocating stateless clients to unlock this. End result is more decentralisation. This is what the future internet looks like and why we are building #Web3https://t.co/0AseX6hcEg \u2014 marklittle.eth (@mark_little2) September 6, 2023\n\nOne of the ways to tackle this MEV issue is through the implementation of PBS (Proposer Builder Separation). PBS addresses the centralization risk posed by MEV and also offers an anti-censorship solution\n\nThe Verge\n\nAccording to Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin, the Verge will reduce the amount of data validators store on their machines. It will accomplish this by introducing Verkle trees. Buterin claims this is an improvement over Merkle proofs that enables substantially reduced proof sizes.\n\n\ud83d\udcf1\ud83d\ude80 Vitalik Buterin believes that future upgrades to Ethereum could allow full nodes to run on mobile devices, making the network more decentralized. #Ethereum #VitalikButerin #mobile #decentralization \u2014 CubeCoin | News (@CubeCoinCrypto) September 7, 2023\n\nThe Verkle trees are one component of a larger roadmap for making Ethereum stateless, a difficult idea that is still being developed. In simple terms, the proposal seeks to establish stateless clients, in which validating nodes don\u2019t need to store state data before block verification.\n\nThe Purge\n\nThe Purge upgrade contains a number of improvements to get rid of outdated network history and gradually clean up the network. It will minimize Ethereum\u2019s technical debt and historical data storage requirements. This will reduce the storage requirements for node operators.\n\nThe Purge also plans to introduce history expiration (EIP-4444), which will allow some node operators to skip storing some of the data from earlier blocks. Validators will simply store one year\u2019s worth of history rather than the entire blockchain\u2019s history.\n\nEIP-4444 also aims to remove excessive or unneeded functions from the Ethereum Virtual Machine, optimize the protocol, minimize technical complexity, and lower the cost of participating in the network. The major objective is to reduce network traffic and increase transaction speed.\n\nThe Splurge\n\nThe Splurge upgrade, which is the final stage, is intended to solve all outstanding issues in the network. This upgrade will only be used for research and to guarantee the proper execution and implementation of previous processes.\n\nvery concerned about what will happen after the Ethereum Merge, Surge, and Verge because then we're just left with rhymes like the Purge, Scourge, or Dirge pic.twitter.com/z2INpfQ9UN \u2014 Molly White (@molly0xFFF) September 17, 2022\n\nThe phases contained in Ethereum\u2019s roadmap will improve the network once they each go live. They will also lead to more liquidity and earning opportunities. However, these upgrades could possibly affect the price of ETH. But we can\u2019t say in what direction that will happen.

        "title": "Layer 2 solution Arbitrum drives Ethereum ecosystem's growth, suggests Pantera Capital - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "According to the latest Pantera Capital Blockchain Letter, the crypto market may finally turn a corner after a brutal bear market in 2022, and leading Ethereum layer 2 solution Arbitrum is emerging as one of the biggest beneficiaries.\n\nAs Pantera\u2019s letter illustrates,\n\n\u201cArbitrum is a massive share taker within the Ethereum ecosystem, and Ethereum, in turn, has itself been a massive share taker across all of crypto.\u201d\n\nFurthering this point, Pantera reports that Arbitrum has single-handedly fueled 100% of the incremental growth in Ethereum\u2019s transaction volume this year, even as other layer 2 solutions and competitors stayed largely stagnant.\n\nPantera\u2019s fundamentals-based investing.\n\nPrincipally focusing on fundamentals-based investing, Pantera acknowledges the significant bottlenecks Ethereum has grappled with due to its scalability constraints. Reflecting on Ethereum\u2019s predicament, the letter indicates that layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum are surfacing as preferred solutions, promising faster and cheaper transactions while retaining Ethereum\u2019s robust security measures and wide-ranging application support.\n\nDrawing from Pantera\u2019s analysis, Arbitrum\u2019s critical edge lies in its capacity to process transactions that are 40x faster and 20x cheaper than the base Ethereum layer. This superiority has propelled Arbitrum to considerable growth, both in absolute terms and in contrast to its peers, making it one of the fastest-expanding layer 2 solutions on Ethereum and enabling it to seize a substantial proportion of Ethereum\u2019s transaction market share over the past year.\n\nPantera notes that Arbitrum has consistently grown in transaction volume despite a bearish trend across the crypto market this year. Citing available data, Pantera\u2019s letter reveals that Arbitrum has been instrumental in the Ethereum ecosystem\u2019s growth this year, contributing to 100% of its incremental growth.\n\nArbitrum growth and expanding user base.\n\nThe letter further explores the driving factors behind Arbitrum\u2019s growth, spotlighting its expanding user base and the subsequent rise in developers keen to build new applications on its platform. This virtuous upward spiral, as Pantera notes, is critical to Arbitrum\u2019s continued evolution. However, the firm underscores that the pivotal concern for fundamental value investors resides in the potential revenue from this increasing activity.\n\nAmplifying its distinctiveness in the market, Arbitrum stands out as a profitable protocol in Pantera Capital\u2019s analysis. The platform generates revenue by amassing transaction fees on its network, assembling these transactions into larger bundles, and consigning them to the Ethereum base layer. This mechanism implies a gross profit of about 10 cents per transaction for Arbitrum.\n\nWith a product that has found a market fit and a viable unit economics model, Pantera Capital deems Arbitrum\u2019s valuation as defensible. Per Pantera\u2019s letter, the protocol has consistently grown quarter-over-quarter since its launch, with transactions nearing 90 million per quarter and revenue hitting $23 million in Q2. The gross profit for the same period approached nearly $5 million, equivalent to an annualized $20 million.\n\nThe letter illustrates that Arbitrum, with about 2.5 million monthly average users and roughly 350 million transactions yearly, is nearly a $100 million annual revenue business, generating around $50 million of standardized gross profit.\n\nArbitrum market capitalization.\n\nRegarding market capitalization, Arbitrum currently boasts a $5 billion figure on an issued shares basis. This represents an appealing prospect to Pantera, particularly when compared to similar market capitalizations of other layer 1 and layer 2 protocols, given Arbitrum\u2019s superior usage, revenue, and profit statistics.\n\nFrom a growth and valuation perspective, the letter suggests Arbitrum could potentially scale to a transaction run rate of over 1 billion at 10 cents profit per transaction over the next year. This projection implies about a hundred million in earnings and, at a $5 billion market capitalization, infers a valuation of roughly 50 times forward earnings. Despite appearing expensive on an absolute basis, Pantera considers this valuation reasonable for an asset still growing in the triple digits.\n\nPantera Capital\u2019s Blockchain Letter presents Arbitrum as a rapidly evolving protocol that has found a product-market fit, demonstrates profitability, and trades at a reasonable valuation relative to its growth, other crypto assets, and traditional financial assets."

        "content": "ETH could drop below $1,500 as many old coins changed wallets.\n\nThe sentiment remained bearish, but ETH\u2019s burn mechanism could rescue the altcoin in the long-term.\n\nEthereum\u2019s [ETH] plunge to $1,540 has been accompanied by interesting changes that could push the altcoin into capitulation, Santiment revealed. The on-chain analytic platform, in its 12 September post on X (formerly Twitter), noted that a large number of ETH have been transferred from old wallets.\n\n? #Ethereum dropped to $1,540 for the first time since March 12th, and this coincided with large quantities of stagnant $ETH moving away from old wallets. A continued dip in mean $ age while prices drop is a capitulation sign, which foreshadows reversals. https://t.co/50jK2C7aLi pic.twitter.com/4RhtlVX3rr \u2014 Santiment (@santimentfeed) September 12, 2023\n\nOldies leave their former abode\n\nThe post focused on using the Mean Coin Age (MCA) to decipher the possibility. The MCA is the sum of a coin\u2019s Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) alive at the time of coin creation.\n\nAs a long-term indicator, a drop in the MCA implies a massive movement of UTXOs that have been immobile for a long period.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-2024\n\nAt the time of writing, ETH\u2019s 90-day MCA had decreased to 41.07. This further affirmed Santiment\u2019s position that a big fall could be close. Although the 90-day dormant circulation has now reduced, the surge to 634,000 on 11 September reinforced the notion that old coins were moving in droves.\n\nSo, the spike implies that it\u2019s not just the two to five years dormant coins on Ethereum that are moving. Those who have remained stagnant for just three months joined the party.\n\nPreviously, AMBCrypto had explained why ETH\u2019s price action could remain bearish. However, Santiment mentioned that after the rain comes sunshine, noting that relief could come to ETH after the projected price drop.\n\nIs light at the end of the tunnel?\n\nHowever, traders do not expect the recovery to be anytime soon, as shown by the funding rate. As of this writing, ETH\u2019s funding rate was -0.003%. Since perpetual futures contracts can be held indefinitely, it becomes very necessary to have the funding rate.\n\nFunding rate is the amount of an asset paid between long and short-positioned traders with open contracts. When the funding rate is positive, it means that longs are paying too short to keep their position. In this case, traders\u2019 sentiment is bullish.\n\nBut a negative funding rate means that shorts are paying longs a funding fee. Here, like it was with ETH, the sentiment is bearish. So, the broader bias was for ETH to drop much below $1,500.\n\nFor now, Ethereum may need to depend on other metrics besides its market-based indicators in the hope of recovery. One metric that comes to mind is the Ethereum burned supply.\n\nThis Ethereum burned supply represents the cumulative sum of ETH incinerated since the implementation of the EIP-1559. For context, the EIP-1559 was implemented during the London Hard Fork\u2014 the same period Ethereum began the burn mechanism.\n\nIn EIP-1559, the base for transactions is not sent to any miner/validator. Rather, it is burned as a means to reduce ETH\u2019s supply and improve its value in the long term.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nLately, ETH turned inflationary, which could be a cause for concern. However, the burned supply of Ethereum had also increased to 4.25 million (as displayed above).\n\nIf the number continues to increase, then ETH may get back its deflationary pressure, and in the long term, could be profitable for its price."

These are \u201cindividual pieces that are designed to fit into an ecosystem that\u2019s otherwise the same as before,\u201d Buterin said.\n\nWhat he\u2019s excited about is decentralized social, repeatedly name-dropping Farcaster, a Twitter-like protocol built on the OP mainnet with a companion Warpcast mobile app that is currently in invite-only alpha release.\n\nAlong with Lens, developed by Aave-founder Stani Kulechov and running on Polygon\u2019s proof-of-stake chain, Farcaster and similar social experiences are using crypto tools to compete with centralized platforms.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s see how far we can push things in that direction,\u201d Buterin said. \u201cBut where I see the longer term future here is it really can plug into all of the other stuff that we\u2019ve been doing as a space.\u201d\n\nBuilding Sybil-resistance for example, so that \u201cthe 894 likes are 894 people, and not 894 accounts that are all controlled by the Kremlin.\u201d\n\nCrypto-based solutions have the potential to be more decentralized, privacy-preserving and secure than the current Web2 landscape, according to Buterin, citing building blocks such as ENS, various proof-of-humanity ideas, and POAPs \u2014 or a next generation version using zero-knowledge technology that will be even better \u2014 and Gitcoin Passport, as examples.\n\n\u201cThe big dream here is to like, really create an independent open tech stack,\u201d Buterin said. Something to compete with the likes of Google and Twitter, without going down a closed, centralized system such as China\u2019s tight integration of Wechat, Alipay and increasingly CBDC.\n\nButerin envisions a gradual on-ramping process for new Web3 users to create an Ethereum address, initially controlled by a familiar service like Gmail, but using account abstraction, giving people the ability to take ownership when they are ready to use more crypto-native approaches.\n\n\u201cBasically, give people the opportunity to slide down the decentralization ladder and then, at the end of it, really properly be in this totally independent stack that actually works together \u2014 all the different pieces inside it,\u201d he said.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "Criticisms aimed at the perceived centralization of Ether (ETH) staking pools may finally be quelled by an alternative staking infrastructure that aims to improve private key security and reduce validator downtimes and slashing penalties.\n\nSpeaking exclusively to Cointelegraph, SSV.network founder Alon Muroch outlined how the platform\u2019s distributed validator technology (DVT), developed in partnership with the Ethereum Foundation, can help decentralize ETH staking pools and validators.\n\nSSV.network launched its public mainnet with more than 10 staking decentralized applications deploying their platforms on the network on Sept. 14. DVT is intended to decentralize the current landscape of staking providers, which is currently dominated by a handful of ETH staking pools that command a significant share of ETH locked in the Eth2 staking contract.\n\nRelated: SSV launches $50M ecosystem fund to support ETH staking tech\n\nAccording to Muroch, the technology is an approach to validator security that spreads out key management and signing responsibilities across multiple parties, reducing single points of failure and increasing validator resiliency.\n\nThe technology splits a private key used to secure a validator across a cluster of computers. This increases security and allows for some nodes of a validator cluster to go offline, which also reduces single points of failure from the network and makes validator sets more robust.\n\n\u201cBy splitting keyshares between a diverse set of nodes in a cluster, validators become much more decentralized. Staking pools that use DVT can decentralize their own infrastructure or delegate it to SSV.network node operators.\u201d\n\nData from blockchain analytics firm Nansen shows that Lido Finance accounts for 32% of ETH locked in the Beacon Chain deposit contract. ETH staking pools offered by Coinbase (8%) and Binance (4%) also command a significant share of staked ETH.\n\nAn overview of the largest ETH staking entities. Source: Nansen Eth2 deposit contract\n\nAs SVV noted in an announcement marking the mainnet launch, centralized exchanges such as Coinbase, Binance and Kraken hold around 18% of the total staked ETH, while liquid-taking pools like Lido, RocketPool, Stader and Stakewise account for over 36% of the total market share.\n\nLiquid staking pools became hugely popular in the build-up to Ethereum\u2019s anticipated Shanghai upgrade in July 2023. The event introduced the ability for Ethereum users to withdraw staked ETH from the Beacon contract for the first time.\n\nSSV intends to offer alternative liquid and centralized staking pools, which it describes as \u201cfundamentally centralized and custodial\u201d. Muroch added that SSV can significantly increase validator private key security and maximize rewards through high performance and a fault-tolerant setup that stops slashing penalties for offline validators.\n\nSSV.network grabbed headlines in January 2023 when it launched a $50 million ecosystem fund to support other projects developing using DVT. The technology was previously highlighted as an important aspect of Ethereum\u2019s scaling roadmap laid out by co-founder Vitalik Buterin in December 2021.\n\nMagazine: Are DAOs overhyped and unworkable?

        "content": "A widely followed crypto analyst believes that a monumental collapse is in the cards for the smart contract platform Ethereum (ETH).\n\nIn a new video, analyst Nicholas Merten tells his 512,000 YouTube subscribers that Ethereum had more than a year to break out from an ascending triangle pattern.\n\nAccording to Merten, Ethereum\u2019s inability to convincingly move above the resistance of the bullish formation suggests that ETH is weak and likely headed to much lower levels.\n\n\u201cEthereum cannot show up to the plate. It keeps getting shot down [at around] $2,000, and that\u2019s okay for a while. But eventually, you\u2019ve got to be able to either break out to the upside or if you break through the ascending line of support to the downside, that spells bad news. That is a failed technical pattern\u2026\n\nSo if we are not going to catch a bid here, then that means we\u2019re probably going to revisit $1,100 \u2013 the previous support range \u2013 or come down to $890 like we were back here in June.\n\nOr maybe even worse: perhaps our scenario of anywhere from $300 to $500 Ethereum is not too bearish at all. Perhaps is not too far off.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, Ethereum is trading for $1,597, slightly below the diagonal support of Merten\u2019s ascending triangle pattern.\n\nMerten is not the only analyst sounding the alarm about a possible Ethereum crash. Crypto strategist Benjamin Cowen previously said that it is in the realm of possibility for ETH to nosedive to as low as $400.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a good chance that [there will] be a lower low, and it might not be a much lower low, maybe it just goes down to just below $800. It could go lower. It could go to $600 or $500 or $400, but that is in the cards for Ethereum.\u201d\n\nI\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "The Ethereum scaling story tends to center around layer-2 rollups, but what about the EVM itself? Does the virtual machine suffer from limitations that are inherent to the execution layer of the system, or can developers overcome them?\n\nWhile rollups take the computation load off the Ethereum mainchain, Blockworks co-founder Michael Ippolito wondered how the computation that occurs directly on Ethereum could be more \u201cperformant.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo rollups solve all of our scalability challenges, or is there still work to be done on the execution layer?\u201d he asked during the Permissionless II conference in Austin, Texas.\n\nMonad Labs developer relations engineer Kevin Galler replied: \u201cA lot of the current limitations of the EVM we know today are actually more of a side effect of how the backend computer of this EVM has been constructed up until now,\u201d but are not inherent to the interface or the bytecode.\n\n\u201cYou can actually design parallelism and stuff into this,\u201d he said, acknowledging that \u201cthere\u2019s stuff you have to work around to maintain backwards compatibility.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s like, 20 years of high performance computing research on how to do these things,\u201d he said, \u201cso, it\u2019s a very solvable problem.\u201d\n\nOffchain Labs senior software engineer Raul Jordan admitted that the current implementation of the EVM is \u201cfairly slow for many reasons,\u201d adding \u201cthere are many things we can do to power that up.\u201d\n\nJordan noted that developers are already accustomed to being able to build DeFi primitives and other \u201creally cool applications\u201d with the EVM as it stands today, but wondered \u201chow can we give them superpowers to build something greater than they have before?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow can we empower them?\u201d he asked. \u201cShould we make the EVM faster, or can we introduce new constructs that allow them to do things that weren\u2019t possible before?\u201d\n\nCan\u2019t cheat physics\n\nSomani expressed concerns with the possibility of an excess of layer-2 protocols. \u201cThe issue with the single threaded EVM\u2026is that it results in a lot of rollups.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s people suggesting there should be millions of rollups or something,\u201d Somani continued. \u201cThat\u2019s going to lead to a lot of issues with liquidity fragmentation and end-to-user experience.\u201d\n\n\u201cSufficiently advanced virtual machines\u201d have local fee markets, Somani said, \u201cso that if there\u2019s a lot of activity on one app, it doesn\u2019t congest all those.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo bringing that [virtual machine] to Ethereum can lead to this highly parallelized [layer-2] that doesn\u2019t really need all these other robots to exist,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t cheat physics,\u201d Galler interjected. \u201cBandwidth is fundamentally what limits how fast a lot of these blockchains can run.\u201d\n\nReflecting on scaling challenges, Jordan referred to the example of Arbitrum Stylus, noting that the product allows developers to write code in common programming languages like Rust and C++, compiling to a special instruction format called WebAssembly. \u201cYou can actually execute this side by side with EVM smart contracts.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo we ended up realizing that the EVM is not the ceiling,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s actually the floor.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can do a lot more than you thought was possible while still maintaining the same guarantees.\u201d\n\nScalability at the execution layer \u201chas a long way to go,\u201d Jordan added, \u201cand we\u2019re trying to get there.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "DEXES DINGED! Last week, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission charged three decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms \u2013 Opyn, Inc., ZeroEx (0x), Inc. and Deridex, Inc. \u2013 with operating illegal derivatives trading services. Notably, the CFTC reprimanded the smart-contract based trading platforms for supporting tokens that were issued by third-parties. Just a week earlier, a New York court dismissed similar claims against Uniswap in a class action case, with a judge arguing that the decentralized exchange platform was not accountable for third-party \u201cscam tokens\u201d listed to its platform. The CFTC charges were significant in the context of the wider U.S. regulatory landscape. For several years now, the CFTC and Securities and Exchange Commission have been in a jurisdictional turf war over who should regulate the U.S. crypto industry. The industry has generally lobbied in favor of oversight by the CFTC, which holds a reputation as the less strict agency, but last week\u2019s aggressive CFTC actions drew long-standing assumptions about the regulator into doubt. On the other hand, CFTC Commissioner Caroline Pham did pitch a relatively crypto-friendly, \u201ctime-limited\u201d program last week to pave the way for regulated crypto markets and tokenization."

        "content": "The Nasdaq stock exchange has submitted an application to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) seeking approval to list an Ethereum Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) offered by Hashdex, an asset management company. This ETF is designed to include a combination of spot ether holdings and futures contracts in its portfolio and pioneering a new approach to cryptocurrency investment within the regulatory framework.\n\nKnown as the Hashdex Nasdaq Ethereum ETF, this investment fund is the first '33 Act Ethereum futures filing of futures Ethereum under the \u201833 Act and is overseen and supervised by Toroso Investments. Toroso Investments is registered as a commodity pool operator with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and is also a member of the National Futures Association.\n\nThe current surge in cryptocurrency ETF applications has placed significant emphasis on whether the proposed funds intend to include futures contracts or spot assets. While the SEC has granted approval for the former, the latter remains unapproved. Fund managers appear to be exploring a middle-ground option, testing their chances in this regulatory landscape.\n\nThe primary investment goal of the Hashdex fund is to ensure that its shares mirror the daily fluctuations in the Nasdaq Ether Reference Price. To achieve this objective, the fund intends to allocate its assets to investments in ether, ether futures contracts traded on the CME, as well as cash and cash equivalents. Nasdaq said in the 19b-4 form:\n\n\"Instead of holding 100% spot Ether, which could make it more susceptible to price manipulation in the spot market, the Fund will hold a mix of Spot Ether, Ether Futures Contracts, and cash,\"\n\nThe Fund aims to decrease its reliance on the spot market and address worries regarding potential manipulation in unregulated Ether spot exchanges by including Ether Futures Contracts and cash in its holdings, it elaborated.\n\nRelated: Franklin Templeton files for spot Bitcoin ETF\n\nHashdex joined the competition for a spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund in the United States. However, Hashdex\u2019s approach differs from recent filings as it won\u2019t depend on the Coinbase surveillance sharing agreement, opting to acquire spot Bitcoin from physical exchanges within the CME market.\n\nIn the previous week, both Ark Invest and 21Shares submitted applications to the SEC for a spot ether ETF, a type of ETF also being pursued by VanEck. The SEC has thus far deferred its determinations on all the applications it has received for spot cryptocurrency funds.\n\nCollect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space.\n\nMagazine: Crypto regulation: Does SEC Chair Gary Gensler have the final say?"

        "content": "Ethereum increased the Churn Limit to 12, aiming to enhance network scalability and security.\n\nThe price of ETH declined along with its volume.\n\nEthereum[ETH], despite its recent struggles in achieving positive price momentum, has been actively working on network improvements. One notable development was the increase in Ethereum\u2019s Churn Limit, which saw a recent rise from 11 to 12. This adjustment is part of ongoing efforts to enhance the network\u2019s efficiency and scalability.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nRising Churn Limit\n\nThe Churn Limit plays a crucial role in Ethereum\u2019s blockchain, as it regulates the number of validators allowed to join or exit the network within a specific timeframe. By increasing this limit, Ethereum aims to accommodate more validators, thereby strengthening network security and decentralization.\n\nYesterday, the churn limit increased from 11 to 12. Next churn limit increase projected to occur around October 4! H/t: @dapplion pic.twitter.com/ftwhRxbGFE \u2014 Christine Kim (@christine_dkim) September 11, 2023\n\n\n\nHowever, it\u2019s essential to consider the Ethereum entry queue\u2019s behavior. This queue, which represents validators waiting to join the network, has been gradually decreasing since its peak on 10 June. The ongoing trend suggested that if no new validators join the network by the end of September, the number of pending validators could return to zero.\n\nDespite these challenges, Ethereum has been making notable improvements in terms of its Churn Rate, reflecting the network\u2019s dedication to optimization. Furthermore, the number of Ethereum validators also grew from 880,000 to 924,024, showcasing a continued interest in supporting the network\u2019s security and operations.\n\nState of the validators\n\nValidator Attestations, vital for confirming transactions and maintaining Ethereum\u2019s blockchain integrity, witnessed a decline in the past month. These attestations serve as a critical aspect of Ethereum\u2019s security framework and require careful monitoring to ensure the network\u2019s reliability.\n\nHowever, daily validator income has shown limited growth, with an average daily income of $0.000236 ETH. This income level may not be attractive enough to incentivize potential validators to participate actively, potentially slowing down network expansion.\n\nIn parallel to these technical challenges, Ethereum\u2019s market performance has faced hurdles. The price of Ethereum remains below $1,623, and trading volume also decreased. Thus, contributing to the overall uncertainty within the Ethereum community.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s ETH\u2019s market cap in BTC\u2019s terms\n\nFurthermore, Ethereum experienced a setback when Vitalik Buterin\u2019s Twitter account was compromised in a security breach. It was later confirmed that a SIM swap attack was used to gain unauthorized access to his account, involving manipulation of the telecom company T-Mobile to access his SIM card."

ETH has fluctuated between the $1,500 and $2,000 mark in 2023. The world\u2019s second-biggest cryptocurrency is treading cautiously in the indices and is down nearly 15% since last month.\n\nHowever, leading cryptocurrency analyst Nicholas Merten warned that Ethereum could crash and fall below the $1,000 mark. According to his prediction, ETH could trade in three digits on the charts and plummet to $890 levels.\n\nAlso Read: XRP Could Reach $10,000 For Its Role in CBDCs, Predicts Analyst\n\nEthereum: ETH Could Be Poised For a Crash & Trade Below $1,000, Predicts Analyst\n\nSource: CNN\n\nMerten explained to his half-million subscribers on YouTube that Ethereum had more than a year to break out of an ascending triangle pattern. He said that ETH\u2019s inability to climb above its resistance in the bullish formation makes the cryptocurrency weak and most likely headed for a crash.\n\nAlso Read: \u2018Solana a Solid Bet for the Next Bull Run\u2019 Predicts Analyst\n\nSource: YouTube DataDash / Nicholas Merten\n\n\u201cEthereum cannot show up to the plate. It keeps getting shot down to $2,000, and that\u2019s okay for a while. But eventually, you\u2019ve got to be able to either break out to the upside or if you break through the ascending line of support to the downside, that spells bad news. That is a failed technical pattern,\u201d he said.\n\nThe analyst explained that things could get worse for ETH from here and might go below the $1,000 mark. \u201cSo if we are not going to catch a bid here, then that means we\u2019re probably going to revisit $1,100. The previous support range, or come down to $890 like we were back here in June.\u201d\n\nAlso Read: Dogecoin: How Much Could You Earn if You Invested $1,000 5 Years Ago?\n\nAt press time, Ethereum was trading at $1,616 and was up 1.7% in the 24-hour day trade.

Santiment experts claim that this might be a potential bullish sign.\n\n1.1 million wallets: Second most active day in Ethereum's (ETH) history\n\nYesterday, Sept. 13, 2023, 1,089,893 unique wallets transacted on the Ethereum (ETH) network as either a sender or recipient of Ether. So far, this is the second largest number in Ethereum's (ETH) mainnet history, as noticed by leading on-chain data analysis platform Santiment.\n\n\ud83d\ude2e\ud83d\udcca The #Ethereum network just saw 1,089,893 unique wallets acting as a sender or receiver of $ETH on Wednesday, the 2nd highest amount in the asset's 8+ year history. This historic anomaly could be the capitulation signal needed for prices to rebound. https://t.co/JF0g8vvBWs pic.twitter.com/1dRnPCjxcA \u2014 Santiment (@santimentfeed) September 14, 2023\n\nTypically, this metric ranges between 300,000 and 450,000 wallets; that said, yesterday, the network witnessed a 150-200% mysterious spike. Per Santiment analysts, this striking upsurge might be \"the capitulation signal needed for prices to rebound.\"\n\nThe most active day in Ethereum's (ETH) history was registered on Dec. 9, 2022, after the collapse of the FTX/Alameda ecosystem. It preceded a painful Ethereum (ETH) price decline to its multimonth low below $1,160. More than 1.42 million of Ethereum (ETH) accounts transacted in a record-breaking day.\n\nAs covered by U.Today previously, yesterday, a whopping amount of 640,000 Ethers (ETH) was withdrawn by users of centralized exchanges. Experts foresee volatility coming, as major Ethereum (ETH) activity metrics are rocketing.\n\nEthereum (ETH) close to having first \"inflationary\" week in a long time\n\nDespite this mini-rally, net activity on the Ethereum (ETH) network remains very low. As such, its EIP 1559-enabled token burn process is slowing down while the issuance rate remains stable.\n\nIn the last seven days, Ethereum (ETH) validators received 15,610.53 Ethers (ETH), as calculated by Ultrasound Money tracked. Meanwhile, only 11,762.10 Ethers (ETH) were destroyed in the corresponding period.\n\nAs such, Ethereum (ETH) lost its deflationary status that used to excite network enthusiasts. As of today, Ethereum (ETH) is subject to 0.167% per year inflation.\n\nEthereum (ETH) is changing hands at $1,619 on major spot platforms, up 1.3% in the last 24 hours."

As a registered commodity pool operator with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and a member of the National Futures Association, Toroso Investments holds an influential position in this venture.\n\nThe proposed Ether ETF has gotten attention for its intention to hold both futures contracts and spot funds. This strategic move is in response to the SEC\u2019s approval of futures contracts while rejecting spot products.\n\nAccording to the 19b-4 form, the Hashdex fund aims to reflect daily changes in the Nasdaq Ether Reference Price and will invest in ETH, Ether futures contracts listed on the CME, cash, and cash equivalents.\n\nThe fund will diversify its holdings across Spot Ether, Ether Futures Contracts, and cash. This approach intends to lessen the fund\u2019s reliance on the spot market, thereby mitigating potential manipulation concerns in unregulated Ether spot exchanges. Instead, the fund will rely on Ether Futures Contracts and Ether futures EFPs traded on the regulated CME Market, ensuring high transparency and oversight levels.\n\nHashdex\u2019s CEO Confident in Future Spot BTC ETF Approval\n\nEarlier this year, Marcelo Sampaio, the CEO and co-founder of Hashdex, stated that his firm prefers to cooperate with regulators rather than take legal action against them. This was a reference to Grayscale Investments, who won a lawsuit against the SEC after its proposed spot bitcoin ETF was rejected. Sampaio also expressed confidence in the eventual approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF, although the timeline and circumstances are still uncertain.\n\nMeanwhile, Ark Invest and 21Shares made a pioneering application last week with the SEC for this initiative to launch the ARK 21Shares Ethereum ETF. This product is set to become the first US ETF backed by Ethereum, the second most valuable cryptocurrency after Bitcoin.\n\nThe applications occur amidst a growing competition to approve the first US spot Bitcoin ETF. Despite multiple rejections due to fraud and price manipulation concerns, many analysts view Grayscale Investments\u2019 recent lawsuit victory against the SEC as a potential catalyst for future approvals of such funds."

Discover SCENE\n\nCollapsed digital asset exchange FTX was today given the green light to sell billions in crypto assets by the judge overseeing its bankruptcy proceedings.\n\nJudge John Dorsey on Wednesday approved that the defunct crypto brand can now sell $3.4 billion in Solana, Ethereum, Bitcoin, and other assets at the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware.\n\nThe company\u2019s plan for offloading the assets, first outlined in August, will appoint Mike Novogratz\u2019s Galaxy Digital as the investment manager overseeing the sale. According to the plan, FTX will cap its selling at $100 million worth of tokens per week, a limit that could be increased to $200 million on an individual token basis.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nJudge Dorsey will allow FTX to raise its weekly maximum if the company gets written authorization from the court. But a footnote on the order clarifies that sales of Bitcoin, Ethereum, stablecoins, and the redemption of stablecoins will not count towards the $100 million weekly limit. Calculation of the limit will also exclude transactions made to bridge tokens from non-native blockchains back to their native networks.\n\nFTX quickly and unexpectedly went bankrupt last November due to alleged criminal mismanagement.\n\nBillions of dollars in customer cash disappeared and now the exchange\u2019s new management now is working to pay back creditors. Selling these assets will help plug the hole, which originally stood at $7 billion.\n\nA Monday court filing showed that FTX owns $1.16 billion in Solana (SOL), $560 million in Bitcoin (BTC), $192 million in Ethereum (ETH), and $137 million in Aptos (APT). The crypto prices in the court document are based on pricing from August 31.\n\nSome $800 million in cash and public equity has already been recovered.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEx-CEO and co-founder of FTX Sam Bankman-Fried is awaiting a massive criminal trial in October after his crypto behemoth went bust last year.\n\nFeds arrested and hit the fresh-faced ex-Jane Street trader and MIT graduate with 13 criminal charges, including wire fraud, securities fraud, conspiracy to commit bank fraud, and defrauding the Federal Election Commission."

        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction as $10 Billion Trading Volume Comes In \u2013 Can ETH Reach $10,000?\n\nETH Chart / Source: TradingView\n\nEther (ETH), the cryptocurrency that powers the world\u2019s largest and most widely used smart-contract-enabled layer 1 blockchain Ethereum, has been nudging higher in recent trade and was last changing hands around 0.5% higher in the last 24 hours in the $1,610 area, now up close to 5% from earlier weekly lows in the $1,530s.\n\nCrypto markets have seen a broad recovery since jitters regarding FTX\u2019s plans to sell $3.4 billion in digital assets weighed on sentiment earlier in the week.\n\nDigital asset investment firm Arca\u2019s CIO Jeff Dorman was quoted in the crypto press on Tuesday as saying that the market reaction to potential FTX sales was an overreaction.\n\n\u201cThe way crypto market makers and traders are front-running the FTX supply shows a complete misunderstanding of how a syndicated sale process works,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cthis isn\u2019t an every-man-for-himself VC unlock\u2026 This is a court-ordered process that Galaxy will sell very slowly and opportunistically\u201d.\n\n24-hour trading volumes of nearly $10 billion in the Ether market, as per CoinGecko, suggest potential dip buying activity.\n\nUS Inflation Continues to Fall\n\nElsewhere, US inflation data, despite the headline YoY and Core MoM numbers coming in a little above expected, may also be cushioning sentiment.\n\nThat\u2019s because the YoY rate of Core inflation posted a big decline to 4.3% from 4.7%, easing pressure on the Fed to continue hiking interest rates.\n\nThe US central bank embarked on a historic interest rate hiking cycle last March and has since lifted interest rates 525 bps to 5.25-5.5%.\n\nCore inflation is more closely monitored by the Fed as, according to them, it gives a better representation of price pressures in the US economy than the headline figures, which can be easily buffeted by volatile food and energy prices.\n\nWith interest rates already well above the Core inflation rate, meaning a positive real interest rate, the Fed will want to avoid tightening financial conditions too much, as they still hope to achieve a \u201csoft-landing\u201d scenario for the US economy, defined as bringing inflation under control without causing a recession.\n\nPrice Prediction \u2013 Where Next for Ether (ETH)?\n\nRecent Ether price stabilization will not assuage fears about a price drop to sub-$1,500 levels, given the cryptocurrency\u2019s still unfavorable near-term technical outlook.\n\nEther remains stuck below its 21DMA, which has been offering strong resistance recently, as well as below a downtrend that began in August.\n\nA break above these resistance levels will be needed for the short-term outlook to improve.\n\nFor now, with Ether in the process of forming a bearish descending triangle structure, a drop to sub-$1,500 levels remains a strong possibility.\n\nA potential retest of the March lows around $1,370 remains a strong possibility.\n\nArguably, the fundamental outlook doesn\u2019t warrant a decline back to such levels, so strong dip buying would be likely.\n\nEther future ETF approvals in the US are likely in the next few months, with spot ETF approvals likely next year.\n\nMeanwhile, Ether has for now been able to avoid the US SEC\u2019s wrath of being labeled as a security (unlike major rivals like BNB, SOL and ADA).\n\nIt seems likely that after 2022\u2019s slump, Ether remains in the early accumulation stages of a new bull market that is yet to really get going.\n\nCan ETH Reach $10,000?\n\nIf Ether is in the early stages of a new bull market, big gains could lie ahead.\n\nETH posted gains of 5,700% from its December 2018 bear market lows of around $70 to its 2021 record highs in the $4,800s.\n\nWith the market has matured and higher market caps achieved over time, Ether is unlikely to post another 5,700% gain from its 2022 lows at $880 this bull market, which would take its price to over $50,000 and market cap to over $11 trillion.\n\nBut could ETH rally 11x from its 2022 lows to rise above $10,000 in the coming years?\n\nAbsolutely, assuming the Ethereum blockchain is able to maintain its rapid adoption and position as the dominant Web3 infrastructure provider.\n\nRemember, ETH is deflationary thanks to its token burn mechanism, more ETH are constantly being removed from supply as ETH staking gains ground, and one of the fastest areas of crypto growth is in the Ethereum layer-2 protocol space (the likes of Arbitrum, Optimism, Base and Polygon), all of which rely on Ethereum\u2019s underlying security.\n\nEthereum will also be undergoing major network upgrades to address scalability concerns in the coming quarters, further boosting its use case, such as danksharding.\n\nA price of $10,000 at the current supply of just over 120 million ETH tokens would imply a market cap of around $1.2 trillion, which seems very reasonable and attainable in the coming years, assuming a broad crypto bull market that also sees the likes of Bitcoin rally into the $100,000s per coin.\n\nAlternatives to Consider\n\nIt\u2019s always smart for crypto investors to hedge their bets, given the unpredictability of the market.\n\nOne excellent Ether (ETH) alternative that crypto investors should consider is a new coin being launched by Wall Street Memes, one of the internet\u2019s largest retail investing communities.\n\nWall Street Memes, with its over 1 million following across various social media channels, has traditionally described itself as \u201cthe king of stonks\u201d (stocks for the uninitiated), but is also looking to claim the crown of being \u201cthe king of crypto\u201d, with the launch of its very own meme coin token $WSM.\n\nThe presale of $WSM has been a resounding success, with over $25 million raised, and dozens of major crypto industry influencers and analysts backing the coin for major success.\n\nAnd investors are running out of time to get involved, with the presale scheduled to end in under 14 days.\n\nGet in now on a token that could match or even surpass the likes of Pepe Coin, Dogecoin and Shiba Inu.\n\nBuy $WSM Here\n\nDisclaimer: Crypto is a high-risk asset class.

        "content": "The popular Web3 wallet has officially unveiled a novel feature called \u2018Snaps,\u2019 which paves the way for its expansion beyond the confines of Ethereum.\n\nThis marks a new dawn for developers and users of Metamask, who will benefit from interoperability and compatibility for different non-EVM blockchains.\n\nThe inception of this feature traces back to a proposal by Dan Finlay, the co-lead developer in Metamask, to construct a platform welcoming developers to build permissionless solutions that integrate with the wallet.\n\nFollowing significant advancement, the concept envisioned by Dan Finlay is becoming a reality with the introduction of Metamask Snaps in Extension v11.0+.\n\nMetamask defines Snaps as novel features developed by third parties that users can directly install into their wallets without permission. The project offers a functionality allowing anyone to add features from other independent developers straight into their Metamask wallet.\n\nAccording to Metamask;\n\n\u201cSnaps run in a sandboxed environment and use a permissions model to protect your data and respect your consent. Snaps do not have access to your MetaMask account data. When installing a Snap, make sure you understand what permissions you are granting.\u201d\n\nSources indicate that Metamask engaged with about 150 different devs in developing this new functionality. The launch of Snaps is a giant leap forward for innovation grounded in Metamask, propelling the decentralization movement into a new era.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvVwXoep9oE&t=1s&ab_channel=CryptoPotato\n\nSnaps Welcome Interoperability with non-EVM Blockchains\n\nAs indicated in Metamask\u2019s snap directory, 34 snaps are integrated and ready to use by crypto investors at launch. Based on Metamask, one of the primary classes of the allowlisted \u2018Snaps\u2019 focuses on the interoperability and compatibility of Metamask with non-EVM blockchains, including Solana, Bitcoin, Algorand, Cosmos, and more. There are two Solana-focused, 1-Algorand-focused, and 1 Bitcoin-focused Snaps.\n\nThe BTCSnap is the first-ever product allowing users to manage BTC directly within Metamask without wrapping the tokens.\n\nAlgorand Foundation now has an Algorand Snap, which allows people to manage, swap, and transfer accounts directly with Metamask.\n\nSolflare Wallet and Drift Labs have launched different integrations of Solana wallets so investors can swap, stake, connect to Solana Dapps, and even bridge from EVM to SOL with utmost ease.\n\nMore interoperability-focused snaps already launched include Tezos-Metamask-Snap, CubeSigner, Cosmosnap, Consensys/Starknet Snap, and Mina Portal, etc.\n\nNotification and Transaction Insight Snaps\n\nAside from the interoperability Snaps, Metamasks brought the Notification and Transaction insights the new feature as well. Notification snaps bring with them chat features and notifications provided directly into Metamask. Examples of such tools include Push Snap by Push V1, Walletchat-Metamask Snap, and more.\n\nTransaction Insight Snaps are features that bring clear and in-depth analysis of blockchain transactions. Such Snaps include Forta network-Metamask Snap, risk detect-snap, Blockfence-insights, Tenderly Snap, and Wallet Guard."

Considering the current market structure, more downside can be expected.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nBy Edris\n\nThe Daily Chart\n\nOn the daily chart, the price has recently broken below the $1,650 support. However, this level is currently being retested. A further bearish continuation is likely if the price fails to climb above the broken level soon.\n\nThe recent bearish crossover between the 50-day and 200-day moving averages is also a negative signal, indicating the potential beginning of a downtrend in the coming weeks.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart\n\nLooking at the 4-hour timeframe, it is evident that after weeks of testing the $1,650 support zone, the price has finally broken through and is currently pulling back towards it.\n\nIf the market rises above the $1,650 level in the coming days, a rally toward $1,750 is imminent. Otherwise, a deeper decline would materialize, spreading fear among investors and making them wonder if the bear market may not be over yet.\n\nOn-Chain Analysis\n\nBy: Edris\n\nEthereum Taker Buy Sell Ratio\n\nOver the past few weeks, Ethereum\u2019s price has been trending down after being rejected from the $2,000 resistance level multiple times. Analyzing the futures market sentiment can provide insights into the current situation.\n\nThis chart shows the taker buy-sell ratio with a 30-day moving average applied to enhance visualization. The metric indicates whether buyers or sellers are executing their orders more aggressively. Positive values are associated with bullish sentiment, and negative values are considered bearish.\n\nThis metric has been trending in the negative region over the past few months, indicating that futures market traders are bearish on ETH. As long as this is the case, there is a low probability of a bullish reversal in the short term."

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nA recent data dump from IntoTheBlock reveals a puzzling trend: a whopping 640,000 ETH has exited exchanges. This mass exodus of Ethereum from trading platforms was not exactly on anyone's bingo card, especially given Ethereum's recent market performance. As of the latest data, Ethereum is priced at approximately $1,598.67. So, what is fueling this unexpected dynamic?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFirst, accumulation. The outflow could be a bullish sign, indicating that investors are hoarding Ethereum for the long haul. However, it is essential to note that Ethereum's long-term performance has been bearish. This makes the accumulation theory a bit shaky but still plausible. Investors might be seeing this as an opportune moment to stock up on Ethereum at a lower price point.\n\nSource: TradingView\n\nAnother angle to consider is portfolio de-risking. Some whales might be liquidating their Ethereum holdings \u2014 not because they have lost faith in the asset, but perhaps to diversify their portfolios. In a volatile market, putting all your eggs in one basket is rarely a good idea.\n\nThe sudden drop in exchange reserves also opens up a conversation about liquidity. Reduced liquidity could lead to increased volatility, which traders should keep an eye on.\n\nWhile the reasons behind this massive outflow remain speculative, the data do not lie. Ethereum is seeing a significant shift, and whether it is for accumulation or diversification, the impact on the market will be worth monitoring.\n\nIs this the calm before a storm, or is it a storm in itself? Only time will tell. But one thing is certain: the Ethereum landscape is shifting, which might lead to an unexpected surge of volatility."

He argues that such a claim cannot be made without evidence.\n\n\"Gensler indicated that he feels that many tokens are securities, although they really need to be demonstrated to be that.

        "content": "Share:\n\nBitcoin price has risen above the $25,586 resistance level as it gingerly treads a recovery higher.\n\nEthereum price recoups losses, but the $1,800 psychological level could be difficult to overcome.\n\nRipple price decisively breaks above a bearish channel at $0.4600, but growing headwinds leave a lot to be determined.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price is leading the rest of the market, including Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) prices, north, with momentum indicators painting a bullish picture. However, investors must exercise caution from here on out, with a lot still to be determined.\n\nAlso Read: US CPI annual inflation comes in above expectations at 3.7%, Bitcoin price rests above $26,000\n\nBitcoin price forging an uptrend\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price is forging an uptrend after two successive green candlesticks. While the outlook appears promising, investors should exercise caution lest the recovery prove fake.\n\nFor the bullish perspective, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) moving north points to rising momentum, which is corroborated by the green candlesticks of the Awesome Oscillator (AO). Furthermore, RSI is converging bullishly with Bitcoin price adding weight to prospects of an uptrend. This is indicated by BTC price\u2019s recent streak of lower lows, which were not mirrored by the RSI.\n\nFurthermore, BTC has retained above the last higher low of the previous uptrend \u2013 the June lows at $24,800. Given this key level has held, the market structure remains long-term positive, making a recovery a real possibility.\n\nIn an uptrend scenario, Bitcoin price could break past the resistance confluence between the 50- and 200-day Simple Moving Averages (SMA) before confronting the 100-day SMA, with the three moving averages converging around the psychological $28,000. This makes this obstacle a formidable one. A confirmed breach above the $28,838 resistance level would increase the odds for a continuation north.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the flipside, a strong resistance barricade hovers above Bitcoin price, indicated by the 50-day SMA (short-term moving average) crossing below the 200-day SMA (longer-term moving average). Any move up to this cluster of MAs will likely be met with technical selling pressure.\n\nThis technical formation is also what is known as a \u2018death cross\u2019 which is when the 50-day SMA crosses below the 200-day SMA, and signals oncoming bearishness in the market. However, it is not a textbook version of the pattern as the 200-day SMA is rising as the 50 crosses below it. Ideally, for a five-star set-up, both MAs should be falling.\n\nA bearish reversal could, nevertheless, send Bitcoin price back below $25,586, or in a dire case, to test the $24,000 psychological range. The June lows at $24,800 are a key make-or-break level, and if breached could flip the script for the lead crypto.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin price rise pulls crypto market cap above $1 trillion; US headline CPI forecast to rise; core to fall\n\nEthereum price could have trouble overcoming the $1,800 hurdle\n\nEthereum (ETH) price is recovering, like BTC, but overhead pressure seems to be gathering up. To the upside, the 50-day SMA could reject ETH, or worse, the confluence between the 100- and 200-day SMA, at around the $1,800 psychological level, present a formidable resistance level. A break above this hurdle could see ETH tag $1,919 \u2013 levels last tested around mid-July.\n\nThe RSI is northbound, converging bullishly with price, and bolstered by the green bars of the AO\u2019s histograms, adding credence to the bullish thesis.\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the other hand, Ethereum price still risks a correction, considering the pattern of lower lows and lower highs since the April highs were lost. Bears still have a presence in the ETH market, as indicated by the mixed AO histogram.\n\nShould the optimistic forecast fail, Ethereum price could break below the $1,552 support level, or in the dire case, extend toward the $1,407 support level, thereby reclaiming the March 11 lows. This would indicate a 12% slump below current levels.\n\nAlso Read: Total Crypto market cap falls below $1 trillion as whales dump Bitcoin and Ethereum\n\nRipple price faces strong headwinds after a bullish breakout\n\nRipple (XRP) price successfully broke out from a bearish falling channel, which it then pulled back for a retest and final leg-up goodbye. If it continues to hold above this channel for the second consecutive day it could turn the upper boundary of the descending channel into support at $0.4600.\n\nHowever, Ripple price faces strong opposition, with the 200-, 100-, and 50-day SMAs, acting as resistance levels to cap the upside potential for XRP at $0.5107, $0.5666, and $0.5753 levels respectively.\n\nXRP/USDT 1-day chart\n\nConversely, early profit takers could cut the budding uptrend short, sending Ripple price back into the confines of the descending channel. A decisive break below the midline of the channel at $0.4191 would invalidate the bullish outlook, possibly sending XRP to the channel\u2019s lower boundary at $0.3562. Such a move would indicate a 25% crash below current levels.\n\nAlso Read: Ripple Price Forecast: XRP holders need to prepare for 25% crash"

America will see that decentralized protocols, blockchain, cryptocurrency are aligned with the philosophies of the U.S. And I think much of the rest of the world will follow suit.\u201d\n\nLubin\u2019s remarks come at a time when digital asset platforms including Binance and Coinbase are facing allegations from the US regulator for offering unregistered securities and a slew of other charges.\n\n\u201cEther is a Commodity\u201d\n\nThe US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under Chair Gary Gensler is viewing most tokens as securities, however, a year-long battle between Ripple Labs and the SEC over the nature of Ripple\u2019s XRP token concluded in July, confirming that XRP is not a security when sold to the general public.\n\nReferring to Gensler\u2019s remarks, Lubin said that crypto assets really need to be demonstrated to be a security. \u201cHe can\u2019t just make that pronouncement,\u201d Lubin added.\n\nHe also stood by his stance on calling Ether (ETH) a \u201ccommodity.\u201d In March, Lubin made a statement, saying that Ether is more akin to a commodity like oil.\n\n\u201cI stand by my conviction that ether is a commodity.\u201d\n\nFurther, Lubin believes that \u201cclear heads\u201d in the crypto industry would prevail amid a crackdown on crypto companies. He said that the US still remains an example for a lot of countries."

        "title": "Ethereum Leverage Ratio Is Rising, What Does It Mean? - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Data shows the Ethereum leverage ratio has been going up recently, something that may lead to higher volatility for the asset\u2019s price.\n\nEthereum Estimated Leverage Ratio Has Risen To 23% Now\n\nAs explained by an analyst in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, the Ethereum leverage ratio is pointing at increased risk in the market. The \u201cestimated leverage ratio\u201d (ELR) refers to the ratio between the Ethereum open interest and derivative exchange reserve.\n\nThe former of these, the \u201copen interest,\u201d keeps track of the total amount of positions that are currently open in the ETH futures market, while the latter metric, the derivative exchange reserve, simply measures the number of tokens sitting in the wallets of all centralized derivative exchanges.\n\nThe ELR basically tells us about how much leverage the average user on the futures market is currently opting for. When this indicator has a high value, it means that the open interest has a significant value compared to the exchange reserve, and so, the average contract is going for a high amount of leverage.\n\nOn the other hand, low values imply that the futures market users aren\u2019t willing to take risks at the moment as they haven\u2019t taken any significant amount of leverage.\n\nNow, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Ethereum ELR over the last few years:\n\nThe value of the metric seems to have been heading up in recent days | Source: CryptoQuant\n\nHistorically, whenever the ELR has gone up, the price of the cryptocurrency has become more likely to show volatility. This is due to the fact that a higher amount of leverage means that the average contract becomes more likely to get liquidated.\n\nA large amount of liquidations happening at once can lead to chaos in the market, and since this is more likely to happen when the ELR is high, the price can naturally have a greater chance of turning volatile.\n\nAs displayed in the above graph, the Ethereum ELR had risen to some high values in August. As it usually plays out, this overleveraged market condition resulted in sharp price action for the asset, which, in this case, occurred in the form of a steep crash from the $1,800 level to the $1,600 level.\n\nThe ELR quickly cooled down to relatively low values with the crash, as the positions with the most leverage were weeded out. For a while, the metric moved sideways at these lows, but recently, the indicator has once again started to rise.\n\nAt present, the metric has a value of 23%, which isn\u2019t as high as the pre-August crash value, but is still notable nonetheless. Huobi, Derbit, and OKX appear to have a disproportionate amount of leverage as compared to the wider sector, as the ELR for the platforms is currently 88%, 73%, and 43%, respectively.\n\n\u201cWhen ELR increases, volatility tends to follow the same path,\u201d notes the quant. \u201cIn this sense, Ethereum may be heading towards a period of increased turbulence.\u201d\n\nETH Price\n\nEthereum had declined towards $1,500 at the start of the week but has since made recovery back above the $1,600 mark.\n\nETH has returned back to its consolidation level | Source: ETHUSD on TradingView\n\nFeatured image from Kanchanara on Unsplash.com, charts from TradingView.com, CryptoQuant.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEthereum's price has been a roller coaster lately, but a recent uptick has everyone scratching their heads. As of the latest data, ETH is priced at $1,582.21. What is fueling this unexpected bounce?\n\nSome market watchers believe we are seeing the effects of mass capitulation among bearish traders. The theory goes like this: the recent price plummet that sent Bitcoin below $25,000 and Ethereum under $1,600 triggered a buying frenzy. Retail traders, sensing an opportunity, swooped in to snap up assets at bargain-basement prices.\n\nBut let's not get carried away. While the capitulation theory holds some water, it is crucial to remember that the crypto market is a complex beast. Multiple factors, often interlinked, contribute to price movements. So, while retail buying power might be a factor, it is unlikely to be the sole driver of Ethereum's recent price uptick.\n\nWhat is clear, however, is that the market is in a state of flux. Volatility is the name of the game, and Ethereum is no exception. Whether this bounce is a temporary blip or the start of a more sustained recovery remains to be seen. But for now, at least, Ethereum investors have a little something to smile about.\n\nXRP loses important support\n\nXRP's recent tumble below the pivotal $0.5 mark has traders on edge. This price level was not just a number; it served as a psychological bulwark, a line in the sand that many hoped would not be crossed. Yet here we are, with XRP currently trading at approximately $0.4776, according to the latest data.\n\nWhy does the $0.5 level matter so much? It is not just about the number itself but the sentiment it carries. When XRP held above this level, it was a sign of relative stability and investor confidence. Now that it has been breached, the market's mood has shifted, and not for the better. The RSI (Relative Strength Index) is also in oversold territory, adding another layer of concern.\n\nWhat is the next line of defense? If we look back at the price action in June and April of this year, the $0.45 level stands out as a robust support point. During those periods, the asset showed strong consolidation around this price, making it a likely candidate for the next battleground.\n\nThe breach of the $0.5 level could serve as a catalyst for further downward movement, especially if the market fails to recover swiftly. The next few trading sessions will be crucial in determining whether XRP can regain its footing or if it will continue its descent into more precarious territory.\n\nShiba Inu investors waking up\n\nWhile Shiba Inu's price might not be painting the rosiest picture \u2014 hovering around $0.00000722 according to recent data \u2014 the meme token is quietly making waves in another department. Specifically, its trading volume on Binance has skyrocketed by a staggering 200%, reaching a colossal three trillion. What's the story behind this volume surge?\n\nOne of the main reasons could be the increased activity of whales, which suggests a possible accumulation phase. Whales often have the foresight and resources to buy low and sell high, and their heightened activity could be a precursor to a future price uptick.\n\nSecondly, this volume explosion is not happening in a vacuum; it coincides with a market-wide price drop. This juxtaposition could imply that savvy traders are seizing the opportunity to buy the dip, anticipating a rebound. The surge in trading volume, especially during a market downturn, could be a bullish indicator disguised as a bearish trend."

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nNasdaq has filed an SEC application to list an ETF that invests in both spot Ether markets and Ether futures.\n\nThe proposed fund would be issued by the Brazilian digital asset manager Hashdex.\n\nThe SEC has so far resisted spot crypto funds but endorsed their futures-based equivalents.\n\nCould mixed spot/futures ETFs could overcome the impasse?\n\nThe US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has so far resisted allowing Exchange-Traded Funds (ETF) to directly hold cryptocurrencies. Yet, since 2021, several funds that invest in cryptocurrency futures markets have been approved.\n\nWith the SEC currently stalling its decision on several spot Bitcoin ETF applications, Nasdaq has proposed listing a mixed spot/futures fund as a novel third path.\n\nAssuaging SEC Concerns Over Market Manipulation\n\nOn Tuesday, September 12, Nasdaq filed an SEC application to list an ETF that invests in both spot Ether markets and Ether futures. The fund would be issued by Hashdex, a Brazilian firm specializing in digital asset management.\n\nThe decision to mix direct cryptocurrency investments with crypto futures is framed in terms that are designed to appease the SEC\u2019s objections to spot crypto ETFs. Namely, the Commission\u2019s concerns that spot cryptocurrency markets are vulnerable to manipulation.\n\nNasdaq\u2019s filing argues that \u201cinstead of holding 100% spot Ether, which could make it more susceptible to price manipulation in the spot market, the Fund will hold a mix of Spot Ether, Ether Futures Contracts, and cash.\u201d\n\nSecuring a Role for the CME\n\nTo the SEC, allowing crypto futures ETFs is justified because futures contracts are issued by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME).\n\nCrypto spot trades, on the other hand, are facilitated by exchanges that the SEC hasn\u2019t sanctioned. (And which it therefore views illegal, according to the SEC\u2019s classification of the majority of cryptocurrencies as securities.)\n\nIn response, to the SEC\u2019s stance on spot crypto ETFs, the Nasdaq\u2013Hashdex application insists that the fund will incorporate \u201cdynamic investment restrictions,\u201d designed to mitigate the risk of market manipulation.\n\nAs the filing notes, the fund would ensure that the CME is the only \u201cmarket of significant size\u2019\u201d facilitating investments for the proposed ETF.\n\nOvercoming the ETF Impasse\n\nUltimately, critics have argued that the SEC\u2019s logic is flawed and it has been questioned by US courts.\n\nRegardless of how much oversight the SEC exercises over the CME, crypto futures are still bound by the price of the underlying assets they track. They are thus subject to the same manipulation and volatility risks of crypto markets.\n\nThat being said, if they help appease the SEC and weaken its resistance to allowing ETFs to directly hold cryptocurrency, mixed funds could overcome a regulatory hurdle that has constrained the growth of crypto investment in the US."

Calculated by summing up sending and receiving transactions from these unique addresses, being more reliable data for the market\u2019s sentiment than overall transaction activities, that could be inflated by a few addresses performing multiple sendings.\n\nNotably, Glassnode spotted an increase in this general data, as the number of sending addresses also hit an 8-month high of 17,364 this morning.\n\nETH number of sending addresses (hourly chart, 7d MA).

        "title": "Top 3 Recent Price Predictions: Bitcoin (BTC), Ripple (XRP), Ethereum (ETH) - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "It is safe to assume that crypto investors are quite intrigued by the future price of some of the most popular digital currencies. Being among the largest by market capitalization, Bitcoin (BTC), Ripple (XRP), and Ethereum (ETH) have gathered much of the interest.\n\nIn the following lines, we will take a closer look at some of the recent price predictions regarding the aforementioned crypto assets.\n\nWhat Does the Future Hold for Bitcoin?\n\nNumerous finance experts and crypto proponents have supported the thesis that the primary cryptocurrency will surpass the $100,000 milestone sooner or later. Such examples are Robert Kiyosaki (the author of the best-seller Rich Dad, Poor Dad), Adam Back (CEO of Blockstream), Tom Lee (Managing Partner at Fundstrat), Anthony Scaramucci (former White House official), and many others.\n\nOne of the most recent forecasts came from analysts of Pantera Capital, who predicted that the leading digital asset could tap almost $150,000 sometime next year. According to them, the driving factor for the price increase will be the BTC halving that will take place in 2024.\n\nOther events that could prompt a rally are the potential approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF in the US, the Fed halting its aggressive interest rate policy, adoption from a leading corporation (such as Apple, for example), etc.\n\nHow About XRP?\n\nThe native token of Ripple has also been in the spotlight lately (especially after the crypto firm secured a partial victory in its lawsuit against the SEC in July). Back then, XRP skyrocketed above $0.80 while many bulls expected to see the price surpassing the $1 mark.\n\nHowever, the asset failed to keep the momentum and plunged in the following months to its current level of approximately $0.48 (per CoinGecko\u2019s data).\n\nThe popular cryptocurrency analyst Shannon Thorp recently made the bold forecast that XRP could reach $500 in the next four years, considering that the total value of cross-border payments tap $250 trillion by 2027.\n\nIf the coin indeed explodes to such a level, it would mean that its market capitalization will stand at around $260 trillion (about 260 times greater than the current market cap of the entire crypto industry).\n\nAnother fact that shows how prosperous this forecast might sound is the sector\u2019s condition during the bull market in 2021. Back then, BTC hit an all-time high price of almost $70K, whereas the total market capitalization of the industry was nearly $3 billion at its peak (120 times shy of the target envisioned by Thorp).\n\nETH Might Plummet\n\nThe latest Matrixport analysis (reported by CryptoPotato) estimated that the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap could nosedive to $1,000 (or drop to a 15-month high) based on the ecosystem\u2019s revenue projections.\n\nThe entity also touched upon FTX and its creditor\u2019s plan to sell billions in crypto assets, including ETH. It believes this could be another factor pushing the coin\u2019s valuation south."

        "content": "Polygon co-founder Sandeep Nailwal believes the layer-2 blockchain firm is reaping the benefits of allocating $1 billion to develop zero-knowledge (ZK) proof-powered scaling solutions for the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nSpeaking at a keynote address during the latest edition of the Token2049 conference in Singapore, Nailwal touched on the development of \u201cPolygon 2.0\u201d scaling efforts and the promise of recursive ZK-proof technology to create a seamless interoperable blockchain ecosystem.\n\nPolygon co-founder Sandeep Nailwal at Token2049 in Singapore.\n\nNailwal highlighted how Web2 and Web3 are similar in form and function, with the former serving as the internet of information with \u201cpractically unlimited scalability\u201d as well as the ability to transfer or convey information in various forms seamlessly across the world at great speeds.\n\nRelated: Polygon\u2019s \u2018holy grail\u2019 Ethereum-scaling zkEVM beta hits mainnet\n\nWeb3, meanwhile, represents the \u201cinternet of value,\u201d which, according to Nailwal, will require two capabilities to become ubiquitous.\n\n\u201cFirstly, infinite, unlimited, unbounded scalability and unified liquidity for value to be transferred, there cannot be 100 chains with the value distributed across them, and they cannot interoperate.\u201d\n\nIn order to tap into the characteristics that have made Web2 able to become the internet of information, Nailwal pointed to the importance of an aggregator or interoperability layer to amalgamate ZK-proofs of different chains into a common layer.\n\n\u201cThe moment those two proofs are submitted on Ethereum layer, we have a mechanism where we have a global state route on Ethereum, and then any kind of liquidity can move across the chain without coming to Ethereum.\u201d\n\nRecursive ZK-proof technology holds the key to this aggregator layer, which Nailwal expects to be deployed in the coming months. The technology will allow different blockchains to submit ZK-proofs of their network state to the aggregator, which then submits a proof of these combined attestations to the Ethereum network.\n\n\u201cOur goal is that this proving will eventually go down to, like, probably two seconds. So, every chain is submitting a proof of whatever has happened on their ecosystem or on their chain every two seconds to this aggregator layer.\u201d\n\nThe Polygon co-founder believes that cross-chain transactions could be executed in four to five seconds, one third of an Ethereum block time, which will begin to feel \u201clike one single big block space.\u201d\n\nNailwal highlights the potential benefit of having high liquidity chains like their zkEVM and proof-of-stake chain to share value to applications while noting that larger layer-1 blockchain platforms have expressed interest in tapping into an interoperable layer.\n\n\u201cAnybody can join this layer, and it\u2019s a mutual win-win because everybody benefits from each other\u2019s liquidity.\u201d\n\nPolygon zkEVM\u2019s beta hit mainnet in March 2023, allowing developers to deploy smart contracts and decentralized applications that benefit from faster throughput and lower costs than Ethereum\u2019s layer 1.\n\nThe company also recently launched its Chain Development Kit, which allows developers to build, customize and deploy layer-2 chains connected to the wider Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nCollect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space.\n\nMagazine: Recursive inscriptions: Bitcoin \u2018supercomputer\u2019 and BTC DeFi coming soon"

        "content": "When Fidelity Investments rolled out its crypto service in 2021, it introduced digital assets for the first time to the company's approximately 40 million individual clients.\n\nCrypto isn't for everyone \u2014 it's risky, volatile and can be hard to navigate. Fidelity's product has simplified the process, largely by starting investors with just a few crypto options.\n\nFidelity Crypto could be appealing for investors who are curious about cryptocurrency and already know and trust Fidelity with their investments.\n\nBut if you\u2019re already a hardcore crypto investor, chances are you\u2019re not going to be interested in switching for these new offerings alone. While Fidelity\u2019s low trading costs are competitive with some of the leading crypto exchanges, the selection and crypto functionality announced by the firm are not yet up to par.\n\nFor instance, Fidelity offers only two cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin and Ethereum. And users can't send or receive cryptocurrency from their accounts, a must for users who want to use crypto for payments or to access blockchain-based services on the web. You can sell crypto for fiat money, though.\n\n\u00bb Learn more: Read our review of Fidelity's brokerage.\n\nAdvertisement Charles Schwab Interactive Brokers IBKR Lite Webull NerdWallet's ratings are determined by our editorial team.

Learn More Learn More Learn More\n\nWhy you might want to sign up\n\nHere are a few factors to consider as you evaluate Fidelity's crypto offerings.\n\nCrypto trading fees\n\nFidelity is offering customers what it describes as \u201ccommission-free\u201d crypto trading. That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean trading is free. The company says it takes a spread of up to 1% on crypto trades.\n\nStill, that\u2019s relatively good compared with other crypto services reviewed by NerdWallet. Coinbase, the largest U.S.-based exchange focused solely on crypto, often charges a fee of $2.99 on simple transactions, which would exceed 1% on small purchases.\n\nOther crypto services can have significantly higher fees, with some upward of 10% depending on how you pay.\n\nFunding and minimums\n\nFunding a Fidelity Crypto account could be easy if you already have a brokerage or cash management account with the company. You\u2019ll be able to move money from Fidelity accounts into Fidelity Crypto.\n\nThere\u2019s no minimum deposit to open a crypto trading account. And the minimum crypto purchase is $1, Fidelity says. These factors put the company on even footing with most other leading exchanges.\n\nIf you don\u2019t have a Fidelity account, making purchases will require you to create and fund an account such as a brokerage or cash management account.\n\nWhy you might want to use another exchange\n\nAvailability\n\nFidelity Crypto is initially available 35 states. If you can\u2019t access the service in your state, you\u2019ll have to go with another option.\n\nCrypto selection\n\nFidelity Crypto\u2019s offerings are on the low end among cryptocurrency platforms reviewed by NerdWallet. Granted, Bitcoin and Ethereum are the two most valuable cryptocurrencies, which means they are widely used and relatively well-established in this emerging sector.\n\nHowever, cryptocurrency traders often look at more options when they are buying and selling. Crypto.com, another major cryptocurrency exchange, has more than 300 cryptocurrencies for sale. Other brokerages also have more crypto options. SoFi, for example, has about 20.\n\nIt may turn out that Fidelity follows the path of other brokerages, such as Robinhood, which started with limited crypto offerings, then expanded over time.\n\nFunctionality\n\nFidelity Crypto does not offer some of the advanced features available on competing exchanges. It doesn't allow staking, a process that allows owners of some cryptocurrencies to earn rewards similar to interest.\n\nAnd unlike some other crypto exchanges, Fidelity Crypto does not offer round-the-clock crypto transactions, with trading limited to 4 a.m. to 12 a.m. Eastern time.\n\nFinally, the company says it does not allow customers to transfer cryptocurrency out of their accounts or to external crypto wallets.\n\nTransfers are crucial if you want to do anything with cryptocurrency other than hold it in hopes that it will increase in value. You won\u2019t be able to use crypto purchased through Fidelity on decentralized finance products, for instance.\n\nTrack your finances all in one place.

However, the majority of the tokens were inching up. The potential selling and layoff news is weighing on digital markets, while traders are on tenterhooks ahead of US economic data due later today.\n\nA joint policy paper on crypto published by the IMF and FSB warned jurisdictions against implementing blanket bans to mitigate risks associated with the sector, and recommended targeted restrictions and sound monetary policy instead. Targeted restrictions might come in handy for emerging economies in particular, it said.\n\nBitcoin posted mild gains as the largest crypto token rose about half a per cent, flirting with $26,000-levels. Its largest peer, Ethereum, also inched up slightly, to remain below $1,600-mark. Price action in the altcoins remained on the positive side in the morning.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s trading price crossed the $25,900 mark, which could be a reflection of renewed market attention on the Bitcoin Spot ETF race. Franklin Templeton, a prominent asset management firm, has recently filed an application with the US SEC, which may have caused bullish sentiment in the market, said Edul Patel, Co-Founder & CEO at Mudrex.\n\n\"Moreover, the number of wallets holding 0.1 bitcoin surged to a record-breaking 12 million yesterday, indicating a rising level of confidence among market participants in Bitcoin. Meanwhile, Ethereum has been trading around the $1600 level,\" he added.\n\nBarring a few exceptions, all top crypto tokens were trading higher on Wednesday. Toncoin surged more than 9 per cent, while Tron jumped about 3 per cent. Among the losers, Solana, Polkadot and Dogecoin shed about a per cent each. Cardano was also down about half a per cent.\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market cap was trading slightly higher, rising to $1.03 trillion-mark, as it rose about one-third per cent in the last 24 hours. However, the total trading volumes dropped as much as 12 per cent to $32.09 billion.\n\nImage: Crypto-chart-price\n\nTech View by Giottus Crypto Platform\n\nOptimism (OP) is experiencing a short rally.

        "content": "Thu 14 Sep 2023 \u25aa 3 min of reading \u25aa by Fenelon L.\n\nMarket predictions in the crypto space often lead to spirited debates among investors. Recently, Benjamin Cowen, a respected analyst in the field, made some waves by forecasting a significant downturn for Ethereum (ETH) and Cardano (ADA).\n\nAlarming Projections for Ethereum and the Crypto Market\n\nFollowing the recent tumble of Bitcoin, which dragged down a large portion of the crypto market with it, renowned analyst Benjamin Cowen is anticipating an extended winter period for Ethereum and Cardano.\n\nIn a video, Cowen paints a bleak future for Ethereum. According to him, not only could Ethereum\u2019s price decline, but it could also drop below the critical threshold of $800.\n\nHis analysis doesn\u2019t stop there; he even envisions a potential drop to levels of $600, $500, or even $400.\n\nOutlining a trajectory for Ethereum, Cowen anticipates a mix of gradual declines and brief rallies, fueling an atmosphere of uncertainty. This volatility could persist until the end of the year, raising doubts among both optimistic and pessimistic investors. In such a context, significant losses could loom for market participants.\n\nCardano (ADA): Heading for an Imminent Decline?\n\nCowen\u2019s outlook for Cardano, another major player in the crypto space, is equally gloomy. He draws parallels between a potential downturn in Cardano and a 50% drop in the Nasdaq. According to his estimations, Cardano could plummet to less than $0.20, down from a previous position of $0.37.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t stop there. If Cardano were to fall by 27% from its current level, we could see a price near $0.16, a level last seen in August 2020. To bolster his analysis, Cowen also recalls other historical milestones for Cardano, including a peak at $0.11 in 2019 and pre-pandemic prices ranging from $0.07 to $0.08.\n\nFaced with this uncertainty, Cowen expresses reservations about the short-lived rebounds of Cardano, which could deceive investors and lead them to adopt risky strategies.\n\nCowen\u2019s analysis serves as a reminder of the importance of exercising caution in the world of cryptocurrencies. However, it\u2019s worth noting that these are his personal forecasts, which may or may not materialize. Meanwhile, the crypto sphere is holding its breath, anticipating the SEC\u2019s resolution regarding the Ethereum Futures ETF. Its approval could potentially catalyze an upward trend for ETH and the entire crypto market.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program!

        "content": "Ethereum, the cryptocurrency, is still under investigation from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission due to disputes over crypto tokens being made available and secure.\n\nIn a press release this week, Co-founder of Ethereum, Joseph Lubin suggested that clear heads and clarity of thinking are the best way to proceed through the investigation. This comes after the cryptocurrency has been hit by waves of regulatory boards demanding the tightening and transparency of crypto commodities, tokens and intermediaries.\n\nLubin stated:\n\nAmerica will see that decentralized protocols, blockchain, and cryptocurrency are aligned with the philosophies of the U.S. And I think much of the rest of the world will follow suit.\n\nIn March, Lubin told CNBC:\n\nPeople buy barrels of oil with the expectation of profit \u2013 I stand by my conviction that ether is a commodity.\n\nEthereum is not the only crypto company to face duress; Binance, Ripple, and Coinbase are also under the watchful eye of the SEC for violating security laws by selling native cryptocurrency XRP without registering it with the SEC.\n\nDon\u2019t miss out the latest news, subscribe to LeapRate\u2019s newsletter\n\nHowever, many crypto leaders have warned the SEC that their laws and regulations lack clear instructions. CEO of Binance, Changpeng Zhao indicated that the company would remove itself from U.S. users if the SEC does not implement better-outlined laws. This would damage the U.S. reputation as the global leader in crypto-related movement."

        "content": "Cryptocurrencies have done modestly well this week, with Bitcoin rebounding above $26,000 and the market cap of all digital coins soaring to $1.06 trillion. This happened after Franklin Templeton applied for its spot Bitcoin ETF, joining other companies like Blackrock, Invesco, and WisdomTree that are waiting for their approvals.\n\nCryptocurrencies reacted mildly to the strong US retail sales and inflation numbers that raised the possibility of more Fed tightening. The headline consumer price index (CPI) jumped to 3.7% in August, the biggest increase in months. Retail sales continued soaring, signaling that the American consumer is still strong.\n\nThe next key macro news that will move cryptocurrency prices will be the UAW strike in the United States. More than 150k workers will go to a strike after negotiations with the Big Three auto companies failed.\n\nThese workers, through their unions, are seeking several things, including a 40% pay increase, healthcare coverage, and job guarantees. Auto companies like Ford, GM, and Stellantis believe that these requests are extreme. Stellantis has even warned that it will relocate manufacturing of its trucks to Mexico.\n\nThis strike will have a major impact depending on how it lasts. First, the automobile sector is a major job creator in the United States. As such, a long strike will hurt the economy, the three auto companies, and their suppliers.\n\nMost importantly, this strike will lead to low new vehicle supplies in the US, which will lead to higher prices for new and used cars. Vehicles are some of the most important contributors of inflation in the US.\n\nHigher inflation, also because of soaring crude oil prices, will force the Federal Reserve to consider hiking interest rates in the coming meetings. In most periods, cryptocurrency prices tend to underperform in a period of high-interest rates.\n\nMeanwhile, millions of Americans are scheduled to restart paying their student debts later this month. And with the M2 money supply falling, there is a likelihood that these repayments will hit the economy and crypto prices.\n\nTherefore, the outlook of key cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, Cosmos ATOM, Algorand, and Jasmy is bearish. These coins will likely see weaker demand as people move to the relatively safe and high-yielding US dollar.\n\nRead more: How to buy Algorand.\n\nAccording to Crane Data, money market funds by companies like Western Asset, Federated Hermes, State Street, and Allspring Heritage are yielding over 5.45%. As such, many people will likely move to these liquid and safe assets as hopes of more Fed hikes rise."

        "content": "The BNB Chain blockchain ecosystem is set to tap into Optimism\u2019s rollup technology, powering its newly launched opBNB layer-2 scaling platform.\n\nBNB Chain announced the public mainnet launch of its Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible L2, which delivers lower gas fees and faster transactions to decentralized applications running within the ecosystem.\n\nThe opBNB platform reportedly handled over 35 million on-chain transactions and saw more than 150 decentralized applications (DApps) deployed on its testnet. BNB Smart Chain also claims that the platform achieved a peak of 4,000 transactions per second during a stress test of its capabilities.\n\nRelated: Can the Optimism blockchain win the battle of the rollups?\n\nBNB Chain senior solution architect Arno Bauer highlighted scalability and security as top priorities for the scaling solution while meeting stringent criteria:\n\n\u201cThis included high availability, 4K transactions per second, rigorous stress testing, reduced gas costs under 0.2 gwei, fast finality under 1 second and enhanced security with multiple external audits.\u201d\n\nAs Cointelegraph previously reported, opBNB is based on the Optimism OP Stack and is EVM-compatible, allowing it to interact with Ethereum-based smart contracts, networks and ERC-20 token standards.\n\nThis solution makes use of optimistic rollups to scale transactions by assuming that transaction data proven off-chain is valid until proven otherwise. The technology has been important in helping the Ethereum network scale, but critics highlight the week-long lockup of funds in these protocols, while validation checks are processed.\n\nOptimism has seen significant growth in daily transaction volumes processed and an increasing number of active daily addresses, suggesting that the layer-2 solution continues to offer value to users and DApps.\n\nA number of major decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols have also deployed on Optimism to harness its scaling capabilities. This includes the likes of Uniswap, Aave, 1inch Network, SushiSwap and Curve Finance.\n\nCointelegraph has reached out to BNB Chain to ascertain further details of opBNB\u2019s development and other scaling solutions that may have been considered by the ecosystem.\n\nCollect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space.\n\nMagazine: Recursive inscriptions: Bitcoin \u2018supercomputer\u2019 and BTC DeFi coming soon"

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) dropped below $1,600 on Monday dropping to $1,530, levels last seen in March. The largest altcoin by market capitalization briefly regained the $1,600 ground on Tuesday before dropping back to the current price at $1,589.\n\nThe drop in Ether\u2019s price on Monday coincided with a surge in the movement of previously dormant ETH tokens away from old wallets, according to Santiment. The on-chain and social metrics intelligence platform posted the following chart on the social media platform X showing a noticeable increase in the most dormant ETH over three months, according to its Age Consumed on-chain metric.\n\n\u201cA continued dip in mean $ age while prices drop is a capitulation sign, which foreshadows reversals\u201d, the post read.\n\nThe decline to March levels could attract more buyers, who could take advantage of the dips and buy more ETH at a discount, targeting short-term profits once ETH rebounds toward the $2,000 psychological level. This means Ethereum is building up fresh momentum for a sustained recovery.\n\nEthereum Could Reach $2,000 in the Short Term\n\nIncreased buying from the $1,500 demand zone could push ETH first above $1,600 then to $1,800, and later to $2,000. A sustained break past $2,000 could usher Ethereum into a bull run that could take place between 2024 and 2025.\n\nThe RSI is pointing upwards and moving away from the oversold region. This suggested that the buyers had begun returning to the scene.\n\nETH/USD Daily Chart\n\nUpholding support at $1,600 could help ease the potential selling pressure that has continued to build up after the confirmation of a death cross pattern. This bearish signal occurred on September 1 when the short-term moving average, the 50-day SMA (yellow) crossed below a long-term 200-day sMA (purple).\n\nThe death cross adds credence to the bearish outlook, implying that sellers have the upper hand and the ongoing downtrend is far from over.\n\nUnless investors put the fear of uncertainty aside and rally behind Ethereum, the RSI will drop back into the oversold region, which will validate another sell-off to $1,450.\n\nNote that the longer the price stays below the $1,600 level, the higher the chances of another sell-off trimming gains and forcing investors to capitulate.\n\nAnalysts believe it is too early to rule out a potential drop to $1,000 \u2013 a level that would appear justified based on the revenue projection from the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "Polygon Labs\u2019 vision of an interconnected layer-2 Ethereum ecosystem powered by zero-knowledge cryptography begins in earnest following three inaugural improvement proposals that will begin the transition to Polygon 2.0.\n\nThe scaling technology firm unveiled Polygon 2.0 in June 2023, outlining plans for a scaling ecosystem made up of four protocol layers. The staking, interop, execution and proving layers all play a role in creating an interconnected ecosystem of chains that enable fast value transfer and information sharing.\n\n1/ The wait is over. Polygon 2.0 implementation kicks off now with the release of 3 Polygon Improvement Proposals (PIPs), and a roadmap for Phase 0.https://t.co/gk7FW0zCpc pic.twitter.com/YJo3BtQy4y \u2014 Polygon (Labs) (@0xPolygonLabs) September 14, 2023\n\nPolygon co-founder Sandeep Nailwal recently unpacked how the ecosystem aims to become the value layer of the internet by using zero-knowledge (ZK) technology to provide low-fee, high-throughput performance to the wider Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nPolygon released three Polygon Improvement Proposals (PIPs) on Sept. 14 for community consideration and voting that are earmarked to begin taking place in the final quarter of 2023.\n\nRelated: Polygon\u2019s \u2018holy grail\u2019 Ethereum-scaling zkEVM beta hits mainnet\n\nThe PIPs outline technical details for \u201cPhase 0\u201d of the establishment of a network of interconnected ZK-powered layer-2 chains that scale Ethereum. This includes a proposal for the transition and specifications that will see MATIC (MATIC) tokens become POL tokens, which will become the Polygon proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol\u2019s native token.\n\nPIP-17 will include the initiation of the upgrade from MATIC to POL. This includes its transition to POL as the native gas token and staking token for the Polygon ecosystem, as well as the launch of the staking layer and migration of Polygon public chains.\n\nPIP-18 includes the technical description of POL tokens as well as accompanying contracts that will handle emission and token migrations. POL tokens can be migrated at a 1:1 ratio from existing MATIC tokens. The PIP notes an initial supply of 10 billion and a yearly emission of 2% equally distributed between validator staking rewards and a community treasury.\n\nLastly, PIP-19 proposes the update of the native gas token on Polygon PoS from MATIC to POL while ensuring maximum backwards compatibility.\n\nPolygon\u2019s announcement notes that PIP-19 will not change contracts on Polygon PoS, while the properties of the protocol\u2019s native token will not change either. However, contracts on Ethereum that are awaiting MATIC from the native MATIC bridge may be affected by the upgrade.\n\nMagazine: Here\u2019s how Ethereum\u2019s ZK-rollups can become interoperable"

        "content": "As an ERC-20 token, SHIB is connected to the Ethereum blockchain, and similarly, Everlodge operates within the Ethereum network. So, what implications does this hold? Let\u2019s delve into the details.\n\nJoin the Everlodge presale and win a luxury holiday to the Maldives\n\nShiba Inu\u2019s Link with Ethereum\n\nShiba Inu takes the form of an ERC20 token, effectively entwining its operations, including the Shiba Inu burning mechanism and the Shibarium platform, with the Ethereum blockchain. With the transition to Proof of Stake (PoS), Ethereum mining\u2019s relevance has waned, replaced by Ethereum staking for transaction validation. This shift implies that Shiba Inu transactions will undergo validation via an alternative method. Furthermore, there\u2019s speculation that the Ethereum price\u2019s fluctuations could influence the entire array of tokens inherent to the Ethereum chain.\n\nThis connection might hold particular significance for certain SHIB holders. Despite a recent temporary shutdown of Shibarium, the Shiba Inu developer team asserts that the blockchain is primed for a re-release, eagerly anticipated by the Shiba Inu community. Recent enhancements have introduced safety measures and a monitoring system to avert potential disruptions. The initial launch of Shibarium led to a suspension of transactions, rendering $2.5 million in bridge assets temporarily inaccessible and affecting the value of Shiba Inu.\n\nWith its revival, an increased number of validators come online to bolster security on the Layer-2 system. Shibarium\u2019s goal is to curtail gas fees for users, and the public beta phase is slated to commence before September\u2019s end.\n\nThe fact that Shiba Inu and the Shibarium are bulit on Ethereum means that they benefit from the security and decentralisation of Ethereum.\n\nEverlodge: Co-Ownership of Luxurious Vacation Properties\n\nEverlodge is also built on Ethereum, and is offering a unique opportunity for individuals to invest in high-end vacation properties across the globe. The whitepaper is available on the official Everlodge website, expounding on the mission of Everlodge.\n\nThe crux of Everlodge\u2019s business model revolves around acquiring and transforming luxury properties into NFTs. This transformation confers legal ownership via the blockchain, with the fractionalization making it accessible to potential investors. Thanks to the nature of blockchain technology, all pertinent details are stored on the chain, publicly accessible, and the participation process is user-friendly.\n\nEverlodge is aiming to democratize the real estate market, making it accessible to investors irrespective of their background, nationality, or financial circumstances. Everlodge will introduce a decentralized NFT marketplace for real-world properties.\n\nAs global financial uncertainties rise, confidence in the traditional financial system wanes, compelling investors to explore alternative avenues.\n\nThrough Everlodge, investors can profit from rental income and the appreciation in property values. In addition to earning rewards through staking the Everlodge token, ELDG, which offers a 10% APR. Issued on Ethereum, the ELDG token remains within the influence of the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nHolders of Everlodge tokens are poised to enjoy incentives such as complimentary stays in vacation properties. The ongoing Everlodge presale presents the opportunity to acquire ELDG on the official Everlodge website, with prices starting at a mere $0.012. Notably, the token\u2019s projected minimum launch price stands at $0.38.\n\nFind out more about the Everlodge (ELDG) Presale\n\nWebsite: https://www.everlodge.io/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/everlodge\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "The crypto market seems to be stuck in a puzzling state right now. It\u2019s like everyone\u2019s waiting for something big to happen. But you know what? Many top analysts are still bullish about Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Solana (SOL). They believe these cryptos could pull off some serious 10X growth, which is pretty impressive.\n\nAnd even better, if these big players make it big, it could give a boost to the entire altcoin scene. Some analysts have their eyes on coins like Wall Street Memes ($WSM), Bitcoin BSC ($BTCBSC), and Launchpad XYZ ($LPX), expecting them to go 10X, too. But first, let\u2019s see why top analysts expect BTC, ETH, and SOL to grow 10X.\n\n>>>Buy Wall Street Memes Now<<<\n\n10X Growth on the Horizon \u2013 Insights from Top Analysts on Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana\n\nWhile the current crypto market might seem a bit shaky, some top analysts are actually quite bullish on Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana.\n\nStarting with Bitcoin, top analysts like Bill Miller and Cathie Wood are optimistic, even predicting a 10X surge. Their confidence stems from Bitcoin\u2019s limited supply and the growing interest from institutional investors, both of which could lead to some serious gains. They firmly believe that Bitcoin\u2019s role as a store of value is set to drive its value way up.\n\nEthereum is also on analysts\u2019 radar, especially the renowned investment firm VanEck. The company is eyeing a potential 10X return on Ethereum investments. In its view, Ethereum\u2019s upcoming 2.0 upgrade, the explosive adoption of DeFi applications, and its real-world applications could drive its value up.\n\nMeanwhile, other analysts are also bullish on Solana, predicting a remarkable 10X increase in its value. They attribute this potential surge to Solana\u2019s lightning-fast and cost-effective transactions. Solana\u2019s strategic collaborations, such as with Visa, have experts excited about the possibility of substantial gains in the near future.\n\nWhile top analysts are focusing on Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana, others are paying close attention to altcoins like Wall Street Memes, Bitcoin BSC, and Launchpad XYZ and predicting that these coins will surge 10X or even more. So, let\u2019s dig into what makes these coins special.\n\n>>>Buy Wall Street Memes Now<<<\n\n1. Wall Street Memes ($WSM) \u2013 Dubbed as the 10X Meme Coin of 2023 by Top Analyst\n\nWall Street Memes ($WSM) is undoubtedly the hottest meme coin of 2023, and it\u2019s an exciting opportunity for you to get massive gains as top analysts are buzzing about its potential for 10X gains! This coin is riding the meme wave and encapsulating the rebellious spirit of WallStreetBets within the crypto realm.\n\nSince the beginning, WSM\u2019s presale has been phenomenal, having now surpassed $25 million! Moreover, WSM is doing its tokenomics right. They\u2019ve allocated 50% of the tokens to the presale, ensuring community engagement and thwarting rug pulls. Another 30% goes into community rewards, keeping the community motivated and involved. The remaining 20% is for liquidity.\n\n>>>Buy Wall Street Memes Now<<<\n\nBut what truly sets WSM apart is it boasts a massive following of over a million dedicated supporters, and Elon Musk has interacted with them. Plus, there\u2019s an exciting $50K airdrop to keep the frenzy going.\n\nTop crypto analysts like Michael Wrubel are optimistic regarding WSM\u2019s potential for 10X growth. He is thrilled about WSM\u2019s established community, which gives it a significant edge over other meme coin launches.\n\nThe presale is wrapping up, and less than 20 days are left until WSM hits tier-1 exchanges. Analysts are buzzing about potential 10X gains, so don\u2019t wait too long \u2013 jump on board now.\n\n>>>Buy Wall Street Memes Now<<<\n\n2. Bitcoin BSC ($BTCBSC) \u2013 Top Analyst Predicts 10X Surge Due to Innovative Staking\n\nBitcoin BSC ($BTCBSC) is a new player in the crypto scene that could potentially give you a shot at Bitcoin-like gains. Why? Well, it draws inspiration from Bitcoin but takes advantage of the Binance Smart Chain, making it more efficient. Plus, top analysts like Jacob Bury are talking about a possible 10X surge in its value.\n\n>>> Buy Bitcoin BSC Now<<<\n\nCurrently priced at $0.99, it harks back to Bitcoin\u2019s initial price parity with the dollar back in 2013 before its meteoric rise. The $BTCBSC presale has already raked in over a million dollars in just a short time. Its presale supply mirrors Bitcoin\u2019s 2013 numbers but boasts a unique feature \u2013 a Stake-to-Earn model instead of resource-intensive mining.\n\nJacob Bury underlines the significance of staking rewards, advocating for long-term holding and growth. Every 10 minutes, a generous 69% of the remaining 14 million+ tokens are distributed to stakers. This greener alternative to mining has experts excited about a potential 10X surge for $BTCBSC.\n\nAs top analysts foresee 10X growth for Bitcoin, it\u2019s expected that clones like Bitcoin BSC will experience a significant uptick in value, and the unique staking mechanism could propel $BTCBSC even further. The presale is filling up fast, so it\u2019s wise to jump in early to potentially ride that 10X wave.\n\n>>> Buy Bitcoin BSC Now<<<\n\n3. Launchpad XYZ ($LPX) \u2013 The Web3 Powerhouse Eyed for 10X Gains by Top Analyst\n\nLaunchpad XYZ is a crypto project that\u2019s creating quite a buzz, and experts like Conor Kenny are calling it a potential 10X winner. Launchpad XYZ is on a mission to bring together all the crucial Web3 tools you need for smarter trading and investment decisions, all under one roof.\n\n>>> Buy Launchpad XYZ Now<<<\n\nTheir platform boasts some exciting features, such as an AI assistant that combines sentiment analysis, the latest news, and insights from pro traders. They also have a dedicated charting platform, watchlists to keep an eye on the hottest tokens, and an automated project rating system to make your life easier.\n\nTo access the Launchpad XYZ platform, you will need the native $LPX token, which is currently available in presale for $0.0445 per token, nearly 40% off the list price of $0.07. The presale has already pulled in over $1.6 million, but time is running out, so it\u2019s a smart move to get in early.\n\nKenny is particularly impressed with Launchpad XYZ\u2019s suite of trading tools and exclusive access, seeing them as key factors that could potentially drive it to a 10X growth.\n\n>>> Buy Launchpad XYZ Now<<<\n\nConclusion\n\nAs top analysts anticipate the growth for BTC, ETH, and SOL, coins like $WSM, $BTCBSC, and $LPX could achieve 10X even faster. These tokens have gained attention due to their distinctive attributes, strong communities, and innovative staking systems. Importantly, these coins are currently in presale, presenting a timely opportunity to get involved.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Where is Best to Stake My ETH? - BSC NEWS",
        "content": "This article explores the top Ethereum staking platforms, both centralized and decentralized, providing insights into their features and rewards.\n\nETH Staking: A Secure Path to Passive Income in Crypto\n\nIn the ever-evolving landscape of cryptocurrencies, one question looms large for Ethereum investors seeking to maximize their returns: \"Where is best to stake my ETH?\"\n\nStaking, a process involving supporting the blockchain network and validating transactions, has emerged as an enticing option for those seeking passive rewards. Among the myriad choices available, Ethereum (ETH) staking stands out as a beacon of security and reliability, promising a steady income derived from protocol revenue.\n\nIn the realm of proof-of-stake consensus mechanisms, validators take a pivotal role by locking up a specific amount of cryptocurrency as collateral. This collateral serves as the bedrock upon which new blocks are created, and transactions are validated.\n\nIn return for their commitment, those staking their Ethereum tokens actively contribute to enhancing the security and decentralization of the Ethereum network while enjoying rewards as a token of appreciation.\n\nWhat sets staking Ethereum apart from the traditional mining process is its significantly reduced energy consumption, which minimizes its environmental footprint.\n\nListed below are six platforms you can use to stake your ETH. These platforms not only excel in offering remarkable staking rewards but also serve as strategic assets for astute investors navigating the dynamic and ever-evolving realm of Decentralized Finance (DeFi).\n\nSource: Ethereum Twitter\n\nLets discover the best places to stake your Ethereum and see how your investments can flourish in the burgeoning world of DeFi.\n\n\u200d\n\nTop Decentralized ETH Staking Platforms\n\nWhile staking Ethereum (ETH), choosing the right platform is paramount. Here, we present the top decentralized Ethereum staking platforms that offer unique advantages, each catering to different user preferences and requirements.\n\n1. Lido: Unleashing the Power of Liquidity\n\nLido takes the lead as a premier Ethereum staking platform, offering a seamless, efficient, and decentralized staking experience. One of its standout features is its remarkable liquidity, boasting over $1.5 billion provided on Curve. This liquidity empowers users with the flexibility to easily convert their staked ETH (stETH) tokens into other assets, opening doors to diverse opportunities within the DeFi ecosystem.\n\nStaking with Lido yields stETH tokens, representing staked ETH and earned rewards, with an impressive current APR of 3.8%.\n\nLido has a firm commitment to security, decentralization, and user-friendliness, combined with substantial liquidity, making it one of the best platform to stake ETH coins and contribute to ETH's robustness and growth.\n\n2. RocketPool: Decentralization at its Core\n\nRocketPool secures the second spot as a top Ethereum (ETH) staking platform, championing a decentralized approach to ETH 2.0 staking. As a decentralized staking pool, RocketPool allows users to stake 8, 16, or 32 ETH, receiving rETH tokens in return.\n\nUtilizing a network of node operators, RocketPool ensures the trifecta of security, decentralization, and trustlessness, making it a favored option among those in search of a more decentralized staking solution. While offering ETH rewards at a current 3.27% APR, it's worth noting that RocketPool is better suited for advanced on-chain users due to its complexity.\n\nRocketPool's decentralized nature reduces dependence on a single point of failure, enhancing its overall security.\n\n3. Frax Finance: Innovating Ethereum Staking with Frax Ether\n\nFrax Finance introduces a pioneering Ethereum staking DeFi platform, Frax Ether (frxETH), designed to maximize staking yields and simplify the Ethereum staking process. Frax Ether's liquid staking removes the technical barriers and the 32 ETH requirement associated with solo staking, making it accessible to a broader range of users.\n\nThis platform offers a unique twist by combining three primary components\u2014Frax Ether (frxETH), Staked Frax Ether (sfrxETH), and the Frax ETH Minter.\n\nFrxETH acts as a stablecoin loosely pegged to ETH, providing a seamless entry point into the Frax ecosystem. Users unlock staking yields by exchanging frxETH for sfrxETH, which can be redeemed when converting sfrxETH back to frxETH.\n\nWith potential earnings of up to 6% APR in interest on their ETH holdings, liquid staking with Frax Ether offers users flexibility and composability within the DeFi landscape.\n\nSource: Frax Finance Twiiter\n\n\u200d\n\nTop ETH Centralized Staking Platforms\n\nWhile decentralized staking platforms offer unique advantages, centralized alternatives provide a simplified and user-friendly approach to Ethereum (ETH) staking. Here, we delve into the top centralized Ethereum staking platforms, each offering its blend of convenience and rewards.\n\n1. Binance: Streamlined Staking with Binance Staked Ethereum (BETH)\n\nBinance is a robust centralized Ethereum (ETH) staking platform, providing a user-friendly interface for staking ETH and earning a current 3.42% APR in rewards through Binance Staked Ethereum (BETH). Binance excels at simplifying the staking process, catering to users with varying levels of technical expertise. However, it's important to note that Binance offers comparatively lower yields when compared to alternatives like Bybit.\n\nDespite this, Binance's immense user base and stringent security measures make it an appealing choice for Ethereum staking. Users can conveniently stake their ETH holdings and enjoy competitive rewards with minimal complexity.\n\n2. Bybit: Global Leader in Ethereum Staking\n\nBybit emerges as the premier choice for Ethereum (ETH) staking across more than 180 countries, thanks to its user-friendly integration of ETH 2.0 staking and support for stETH. By locking up your ETH as collateral, you actively contribute to the validation of the Ethereum network while earning up to 7% APR in rewards.\n\nBybit's automatic conversion of staked ETH to stETH at 1:1 ensures that users begin accruing daily rewards based on their stETH holdings. The platform's Unified Trading Account goes a step further, allowing you to trade using your stETH tokens as collateral, granting access to both the Spot market and the ability to withdraw your stETH holdings.\n\nWith its user-centric approach and generous rewards, Bybit firmly establishes itself as a key player in Ethereum staking.\n\nSource: ByBit Twitter\n\n3. Coinbase: A Top Exchange Embraces Staking\n\nCoinbase, a publicly traded company and one of the largest crypto exchanges globally offers Ethereum staking with a competitive 3.27% APY.\n\nNotably, Coinbase does not impose a lock-up period, though users may need to wait for the unstaking process to complete as per the protocol before accessing their crypto. Staking ETH on Coinbase follows a straightforward process akin to staking other cryptocurrencies. Similar to Lido DAO, Coinbase offers a synthetic staked ETH token, cbETH, allowing users to earn an additional yield.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that Coinbase's rigorous KYC requirements translate to a more extended sign-up process, demanding additional verification steps. Nonetheless, for users seeking a familiar and trusted exchange to stake their ETH and other assets, Coinbase presents a compelling choice.\n\n\u200d\n\nThe Path to Secure and Rewarding Ethereum Staking\n\nAs with any investment, caution and prudence are paramount. Ethereum staking presents its considerations and risks, ranging from smart contract vulnerabilities to centralization concerns.\n\nSmart contract risk is a focal point, as once your ETH is staked within a PoS smart contract, it's no longer under your direct custody and becomes susceptible to potential hacking attempts.\n\nMoreover, the consequences of a significant smart contract breach could extend beyond the immediate loss of funds. It could have a cascading effect on the entire Ethereum ecosystem, impacting the value of unstaked ETH held in self-custody.\n\nAdditionally, there are considerations related to slashing penalties and rule violations by some lesser-known staking platforms.\n\nAs regulatory bodies like the SEC explore the classification of PoS cryptos as securities, it becomes vital for stakers to stay informed about potential regulatory changes.\n\nNevertheless, the allure of passive rewards on one of the most promising assets of recent years provides an avenue for compounding crypto gains.\n\nBefore embarking on the journey of crypto staking, it is essential to be well-informed and diligent. Conduct thorough research, select reputable platforms, and stay attuned to the evolving regulatory landscape. By taking these precautions, users can confidently navigate the world of Ethereum staking, contributing to the network's security and growth while enjoying its rewards."

        "content": "Vitalik Buterin, a computer programmer who co-founded the popular cryptocurrency Ethereum, is clearing the air after his account on Twitter (now known as X) was hacked this weekend. The hack involved a post touting a commemorative NFT that was actually a cryptocurrency wallet drainer.\n\n\u201cFinally got back my T-mobile account (yes, it was a sim swap, meaning that someone socially-engineered T-mobile itself to take over my phone number),\u201d Buterin wrote. \u201cMain learning re twitter was: > A phone number is sufficient to password reset a Twitter account even if not used as 2FA. Can completely remove phone from Twitter.\u201d\n\nButerin revealed that a SIM swap attack was the method for the hack in a post on the decentralized social media platform Farcast, as reported by Decrypt. The outlet says that the swap allowed the hackers to take over Buterin\u2019s Twitter account by manually resetting his password using his phone as well as using the number to bypass the platform\u2019s two-factor authentication. The Ethereum co-founder boasts a big 4.9 million followers on the platform, and the hack resulted in an estimated $US650,000 worth of NFTs being stolen from unsuspecting victims.\n\nThis weekend, the hackers took control of Buterin\u2019s account to post a phony link to a limited edition NFT, which was advertised to commemorate the release of proto-danksharding for Ethereum. Proto-danksharding is an upcoming update to the cryptocurrency\u2019s digital infrastructure, which developer Mario Havel told Decrypt was in its last stages of development before release, seemingly in the next few months. The new update will use so-called \u201cdata blobs,\u201d allowing the Ethereum network to expand and handle up to 100,000 daily transactions.\n\n\u201cTo celebrate the Proto-Darksharding coming to Ethereum, @Consensys is marking the moment with a commemorative NFT. \u2018Proto honors the work of the devs who made this possible. The collection is free for the next 24 hours,\u201d the alleged hackers posted on Buterin\u2019s account, followed by a link to a webpage where users were encouraged to claim the NFT. The tweet was posted and subsequently removed over the course of 20 minutes."

        "content": "Don\u2019t invest unless prepared to lose all the money you invest. This is a high-risk investment, you shouldn\u2019t expect to be protected if something goes wrong.\n\nJoin Our Telegram channel to stay up to date on breaking news coverage\n\nA phisher who stole about $24.2 million of staked Ethereum (ETH) from a crypto whale is transferring the assets to crypto mixing firm Tornado Cash, says blockchain security firm Peckshield.\n\nThe stolen cryptocurrencies were liquid staking tokens including Lido Staked Ether (stETH) and Rocket Pool ETH (rETH), Peckshield said.\n\nThe security firm said that the phisher initially transferred 701 Ethereum (ETH) tokens worth about $1.15 million to the cryptocurrency mixer, and then exchanged 28,000 DAI tokens for 17.3 ETH and subsequently moved 1,100 ETH ($1.78 million) to Tornado Cash.\n\nLater, the phisher transferred 2,000 ETH worth about $3.1 million to a new wallet address, and sent 600 ETH to Tornado Cash. Currently, the attacker holds a total of $22.7 million in various cryptocurrencies including 13,100 ETH and 1.1 million DAI tokens, Peckshield said.\n\nPeckshield said on Sept. 7 that the attacker exchanged the stolen assets for 13,785 ETH and 1.64 million Dai (DAI), a stablecoin valued at $1.00. A considerable portion of the acquired DAI has already been moved to FixedFloat, a fully automated cryptocurrency exchange.\n\nLegal Challenge and Sanctions\n\nTornado Cash was sanctioned in August last year for its alleged involvement in money laundering, a practice it was accused of since its establishment in 2019. The Justice Department says it was responsible for enabling over $1 billion in money laundering activities, with a significant portion of these funds believed to have benefitted North Korea\u2019s Lazarus Group.\n\nU.S. authorities say that the Lazarus Group\u2019s illicit actions have provided financial support to North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs.\n\nLast month, a court decision in the US reaffirmed sanctions against Tornado Cash. Six Tornado Cash users had challenged these sanctions, but the court upheld the ban, ruling that the plaintiffs\u2019 claims of constitutional violations were not compelling enough.\n\nTornado Cash\u2019s Private Ethereum Transactions\n\nTornado Cash provides a platform for users to make their Ethereum transactions more private. This is done by combining their funds with those from other cryptocurrency holdings. This process effectively hides the origin of a cryptocurrency transaction, making Tornado Cash an attractive option for cybercriminals seeking to convert their ill-gotten gains.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nNew Crypto Mining Platform - Bitcoin Minetrix Rating Audited By Coinsult\n\nDecentralized, Secure Cloud Mining\n\nEarn Free Bitcoin Daily\n\nNative Token On Presale Now - BTCMTX\n\nStaking Rewards - Over 50% APY Learn More"
