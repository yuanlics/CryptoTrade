        "content": "So staking may simply have become an expectation, something that cryptocurrencies are supposed to do. To me, this seems like a positive trend. It offers cryptocurrencies a touchpoint with dividend-paying stocks, and helps reduce the immateriality of crypto. For many, crypto is entirely untethered from reality \u2013 prices fluctuate randomly, and most people never encounter blockchains while going about their lives. In fact, one of the most popular complaints of crypto is the supposed lack of intrinsic value to any of these assets."

        "content": "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has listed several problems that need to be handled to fix the issue of centralization on the leading smart contract blockchain.\n\nDuring the ongoing Korea Blockchain Week (KBW), Buterin revealed that the centralization of nodes is one of the major problems. He recommended that the challenge be fixed by reducing the cost of running nodes and making such activities less difficult.\n\nFixing Ethereum\u2019s Centralization Issues\n\nData from Ethereum mainnet statistics shows that most of the network\u2019s nodes are run through centralized entities \u2013 roughly 60% handled by Amazon Web Services (AWS) and 6% run by Google Cloud. This means that AWS runs 1,810 nodes out of the 5,901 active Ethereum nodes while Google Cloud handles 186.\n\nThe centralization issue has raised concerns about the Ethereum blockchain facing the challenge of a single point of failure. Some industry experts have also warned that Amazon founder Jeff Bezos could shut down Ethereum-based decentralized applications by simply turning off AWS.\n\nSpeaking at the KBW event, Buterin said the node centralization problem is a \u201cbig piece of the puzzle\u201d to make sure Ethereum remains decentralized in the long run. He explained that statelessness is an essential technology in making it easier for people to run nodes.\n\nAs the Ethereum Foundation noted in a report about statelessness, decentralization is impossible if the benefits of running a node are only available to users with expensive hardware. Statelessness involves the ability of a network to validate blocks without relying on any centralized service providers.\n\n\u201cToday, it takes hundreds of gigabytes of data to run a node. With stateless clients, you can run a node on basically zero\u2026 In the longer term there\u2019s a plan to maintain fully verified Ethereum nodes where you could literally run it on your phone,\u201d Buterin said, disclosing that Ethereum will take significant steps towards statelessness during the upcoming Verge and Purge upgrades.\n\nEthereum Statelessness to be Fixed in 20 Years\n\nWhile statelessness is a major part of the Ethereum roadmap, the network\u2019s founder mentioned that the issue would most likely be fixed in ten to twenty years.\n\nNevertheless, Buterin outlined other steps that can be taken to enhance Ethereum\u2019s decentralization, including easing documentation, eliminating barriers to distributed staking, and making staking more secure and convenient.\n\nMeanwhile, the computer programmer stated that achieving higher levels of scalability is currently the most pressing concern for the Ethereum network."

        "title": "Lido dominates on Ethereum, but struggles on Solana. Why? - Blockworks",
        "content": "\u201cFor those of us who\u2019ve been paying attention to crypto over the last couple of years, hacks are still incredibly real,\u201d says Mike Ippolito.\n\nSecurity in crypto ecosystems is often judged by what\u2019s called the Lindy effect: The longer a technology hasn\u2019t failed, the more likely it is to continue to not fail.\n\nWith all the potential value swirling around in liquid staking, such ecosystems tend to be attractive targets for unscrupulous attacks. Lido stands alone as the liquid staking leader on Ethereum, at least in part thanks to its history of maintaining solid security in a self-fulfilling Lindy loop.\n\n\u201cIn order for you to justify not using the product or service of a leader,\u201d Ippolito says on the Bell Curve podcast (Spotify/Apple), \u201cthe [competing] product has to be an order [or] two orders of magnitude better, and there\u2019s just not that much to really differentiate within liquid staking.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s this \u201cLindy-ness\u201d that leads to liquidity, Ippolito says, which is ultimately what users want from a liquid staking protocol.\n\nSolana\u2019s liquid staking game\n\nDue to the history of successful security on Lido, Ippolito expects it to remain the dominant liquid staking system on Ethereum. But he doesn\u2019t necessarily expect this pattern to carry over to other blockchains. \u201cLido made a pretty unsuccessful play into Solana a while ago,\u201d he says.\n\nReferring to a conversation with Chorus One chief information officer Xavier Meegan, Ippolito explains that Lido\u2019s network effects on Ethereum failed to travel to the Solana ecosystem. He expects to see a liquid staking provider eventually \u201ctake off\u201d on Solana in a similar way that Lido has on Ethereum. \u201cMaybe that\u2019s JitoSOL. Maybe it\u2019s Marinade. I think they\u2019re the front-runner today,\u201d he says.\n\nIn the conversation Ippolito had with Meegan, the CIO described the chicken-egg problem that Solana faces with liquid staking popularity, currently experiencing much lower DeFi traffic and total value locked (TVL) than Ethereum enjoys.\n\nBut the lack of \u201cLindy-ness\u201d \u2014 a long history of network security \u2014 coincides with more opportunities for growth in a younger system that sees more competitors vying for dominance in a less established market, Meegan said.\n\nAssociate at the advisory and investment firm Reverie, Myles O\u2019Neil doesn\u2019t expect to see any \u201cbig technical disruption\u201d that would unseat the existing incumbents in liquid staking\u2019s near future on Ethereum. He suggests that yield is one area in which up-and-comers could attempt to compete, but says it\u2019s \u201cunclear exactly where that stacks up versus brand, security and Lindy.\u201d\n\nOffering one or two extra percentage points yield does not \u201cmove the needle enough to unseat Lido,\u201d O\u2019Neil argues, noting that the service\u2019s liquid staking token (LST) is \u201cnot the highest yielding LST\u201d by a large margin, yet it has managed to maintain dominance in Ethereum.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see a lot of winners here,\u201d O\u2019Neil says.\n\n\u201cLido is really well positioned for Ethereum,\u201d he says, adding that he is less certain of how the liquid staking game plays out on Solana. \u201cIt is a little bit more fragmented over there,\u201d he says, with more possibilities for competition.\n\nIppolito notes that liquid staking on Solana won\u2019t necessarily ever attract the same kind of activity as it does on Ethereum. A major reason for this difference, Ippolito says, is the blockchain\u2019s unique ability to be more liquid than Ethereum in the first place. \u201cThe more the protocol does on its own, the less opportunity there is available for external liquid staking providers.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "A widely followed crypto strategist believes that one Ethereum (ETH) competitor with high institutional interest has massive upside potential.\n\nThe anonymous host of InvestAnswers tells his 447,000 YouTube subscribers that Solana (SOL) has key advantages over ETH that could send its price soaring.\n\n\u201cBut the real difference is how much better by what magnitude is Solana. And if you look here, red is Solana and the deltas, and then blue is ETH. You can see it smashes it. These things are on a log scale on the left. And that is the big difference. Looking at all of the key factors, they have 10 wins each, but in reality, where Solana wins, it wins by a lot more. Where Ethereum wins, it only wins by a fraction.\u201d\n\nHis chart shows 19 different categories comparing Solana to ETH. Solana beats ETH in such categories as block time, average fee and the maximum number of transactions that a blockchain can carry out in a second, also known as transactions per second (TPS).\n\nThe trader says that ETH is considered more established than Solana and a safer bet for investors.\n\nHowever, he notes that more institutional money has flowed into Solana so far in 2023.\n\n\u201cEthereum is safe. It\u2019s established. It has been around for a long time. The risk is very low. When big money comes in, they\u2019ll go into ETH first, although we have seen so far this year in 2023 institutional money is going into Solana more so than Ethereum.\u201d\n\nAccording to the trader, since Solana\u2019s market cap is much smaller than Ethereum\u2019s, SOL has a greater opportunity for a larger price increase than ETH.\n\nSolana is the 10th-ranked digital asset by market cap with a market cap of $8.2 billion. Ethereum is the second top digital asset by market cap with a market cap of $196 billion.\n\n\u201cThis is the magic question though. When you break it all down is Ethereum 20 times better than Solana? And the answer in my opinion is no. But there is risk with Solana, therefore you allocate accordingly. My Solana bag is about a third the size of my ETH bag but it will grow and I think it\u2019ll grow faster.\n\nBut that little skinny green sliver on the right is the market cap of Solana versus the market cap of ETH. And the ETH market cap is 20 times higher, which is stunning. And I look as an investor for relative value. Solana is a screaming buy at this price.\u201d\n\nSolana is trading for $20.28 at time of writing, up 4% in the last 24 hours.\n\nI\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nVitalik Buterin has outlined his vision for a more decentralized Ethereum network in which it is much easier to run validators.\n\nAt present, over half of all Ethereum nodes are run through hosting services operated by companies like Amazon.\n\nMeanwhile, critics have speculated that Chinese firms secretly control a huge stash of ETH.\n\nThe Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin has criticized the present state of Ethereum nodes. Pointing out that the majority of nodes are currently run through providers like Amazon Web Services, he identified node centralization as a major problem the Ethereum community needs to deal with.\n\nIn another potential threat to Ethereum\u2019s decentralization, critics have speculated that Chinese firms secretly control some of the richest ETH wallets in existence.\n\nThe Problem of Ethereum Node Centralization\n\nThe Ethereum network is made up of computers that communicate with each other in order to validate transactions and record data about the status of the blockchain.\n\nEach computer in the network is known as an Ethereum node. From its inception, the Ethereum community has worked to establish nodes all around the world. In order to ensure the network\u2019s decentralization, various computers belonging to individuals, businesses, universities and other organizations all operate nodes.\n\nHowever, not all computers are up to the task. In fact, to operate a full Ethereum node, Quicknode recommends a minimum of 16 GB of RAM, a fast SSD drive with at least 1 TB of space, at least 25 MBit/s bandwidth and a fast CPU with 4 or more cores.\n\nDue to the high technical bar node operators must meet, 57.5% of all nodes are run through cloud hosting services. As a consequence, although there are currently 5882 Ethereum nodes in operation, over half of these are controlled by just 21 cloud service providers.\n\nIn fact, 1805 nodes are operated via Amazon Web Services (AWS) alone, presenting a major challenge to Ethereum\u2019s decentralization.\n\nVitalik Buterin on the Future of Ethereum Nodes\n\nSpeaking at Korea Blockchain Week, Vitalik Buterin discusses how to create a more decentralized Ethereum network by making it easier to run nodes.\n\nAddressing the problem of node centralization in Seoul on Monday, September 4, Buterin observed that reducing the amount of data each node has to store would lower technical barriers for would-be operators.\n\n\u201cToday, it takes hundreds of gigabytes of data to run a node\u2026 In the longer term, there\u2019s a plan to maintain fully verified Ethereum nodes where you could literally run it on your phone,\u201d he said .\n\nPlans to change how Ethereum nodes handle data have already been formed. For example, the Ethereum Roadmap identifies planned upgrades that will allow computers operating Ethereum nodes to delete historical data they no longer need.\n\nIn the immediate future, the Ethereum Foundation is focused on data expiry as the most achievable goal for reducing the computational burden on network participants.\n\nLooking further ahead, however, a concept known as statelessness could make it much easier to run an Ethereum node.\n\nUnder a stateless system, not all nodes would have to access the network\u2019s full state data. But the most ambitious vision for the future of Ethereum nodes, a concept known as \u201cstrong statelessness,\u201d may not happen for a long time.\n\nAccording to Buterin, \u201cThese technical problems will have to be addressed eventually\u2014maybe a 10-year timescale, maybe a 20-year timescale.\u201d\n\nChinese Government Wallets May Hold a Huge Stash of ETH\n\nAs well as the concentration of nodes among a few operators, another threat to Ethereum\u2019s decentralization could come from the concentration of ETH among a small number of wallets.\n\nIn the proof of stake (PoS) era, ETH accumulation of that kind poses a major threat to Ethereum decentralization.\n\nUnder Ethereum\u2019s previous proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism, what\u2019s known as a 51% attack would require a single party to control over half of all miners, thus requiring a huge amount of resources to pull off. However, with the switch from miners to stakers, to seize control of the network, attackers would need to control more than half of the circulating supply of ETH instead.\n\nFor some researchers, this prospect is especially worrying given that many of the oldest and richest Ethereum wallets remain shrouded in secrecy. Moreover, concerns have been raised recently about the role of the Chinese business conglomerate Wanxiang in Ethereum\u2019s early history.\n\nAs the Twitter sleuth TruthLabs has observed, Wanxiang has been associated with Ethereum since its inception and likely received a portion of the 72 million ETH that was distributed to early investors.\n\nA quick \ud83e\uddf5showing that Wanxiang, Chinese auto and early Ethereum Investor funded and setup Vitalik Buterins official wallets. 1/6https://t.co/4uMLLnzguq pic.twitter.com/Ec1cjLOLz2 \u2014 TruthLabs \ud83e\udee1 (@BoringSleuth) January 29, 2023\n\nIn fact, the Chinese company has ties to Vitalik Buterin going back to 2015, when the then-CEO of Wanxiang Blockchain Labs, Feng Xia, purchased $500,000 worth of ETH from the Ethereum founder.\n\nFor TruthLabs, Wanxiang\u2019s deep roots in the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) are a good reason to be suspicious of its ETH holdings. In fact, the crypto investigator speculates that the CCP is Ethereum\u2019s biggest whale, secretly controlling as much as 66.6% Of the ETH supply.\n\nA complete guess, 66.6%. I found 12 Genesis Block Wallets today, alone where they ended up with the majority of the ETH from. Its so hard to know. They were invested in over 500 projects by EOY 2021, and in many cases got the pre-ICO tokens prior to both ETH/altcoin price waves. \u2014 TruthLabs \ud83e\udee1 (@BoringSleuth) June 28, 2023"

        "title": "What Is Ethereum Sharding? A Beginner's Guide - Unchained - Unchained",
        "content": "Read through this guide to learn what Ethereum sharding is and why it is important to help scale the Ethereum network.\n\nThe Ethereum developer community has been keen to address the blockchain\u2019s prevalent scalability challenges via development updates. Following the shift to proof of stake (PoS), the next scalability step is Ethereum sharding.\n\nRead on as we define sharding, explain how it works on the Ethereum network, and highlight its importance.\n\nWhat Is Sharding?\n\nSharding is a scaling solution aimed at improving the Ethereum network\u2019s capacity and transaction speed.\n\nThe Ethereum \u201cmainnet\u201d is divided into smaller, interconnected networks called \u201cshards.\u201d Each shard processes its own transactions and smart contracts parallel to the others, significantly increasing the network\u2019s throughput and helping to reduce gas fees.\n\nSharding also helps to decentralize the Ethereum network as it reduces the load on individual nodes by distributing the transaction load across many nodes.\n\nHow Does Ethereum Sharding Work?\n\nEthereum sharding starts with the division of the network into multiple sections. Each shard handles a set of nodes that process transactions. Consequently, the nodes in each shard process transactions that belong to that shard. The validators on each shard verify the transactions and maintain the state.\n\nAllocation to a shard is random and requires validators to have a stake to participate. Under the proof of stake consensus mechanism, a validator stakes a certain amount of ETH for their participation.\n\nThe sharding technique departs from the current transaction processing format, where all nodes are involved in every transaction. Cross-shard communication prevents role duplication, with shards sharing information about their transactions.\n\nCurrently, full nodes take up plenty of space and continually increase in size as more users join the platform. Sharding reduces node sizes since users only need to store a part of Ethereum\u2019s transactional information.\n\nBenefits and Drawbacks of Sharding Ethereum\n\nSharding Ethereum presents various benefits and drawbacks. Here\u2019s a look at the most significant ones.\n\nPros\n\nIncreased Efficiency & Scalability\n\nInstead of a single chain processing transaction, sharding enables parallel processing, which increases the number of transactions. This will go a long way in rivaling Web2 transaction speeds. Payment systems such as MasterCard and Visa process up to 24,000 transactions per second (TPS), while Ethereum currently stands at 20-30 TPS.\n\nIncreased Participation\n\nSharding offers the opportunity to scale without compromising transaction security. Ultimately, people can validate transactions without specialized hardware or high electricity consumption.\n\nCons\n\nAttack Vulnerabilities\n\nWith transaction processing broken down to the shards level, attackers could potentially target a single unit. If such an action were successful, the bad actors could share information on invalid transactions with other shards, potentially compromising the entire network\u2019s security.\n\nCentralization Concerns\n\nThe possibility of collusion arises with the splitting of nodes into smaller groups. Such collusion could potentially lead to a form of centralization that goes against the ethos of Web3.\n\nHowever, danksharding is a possible solution to the challenge of ensuring diversity and randomness in the composition of the committee members.\n\nSmart Contract Compatibility\n\nDevelopers may need to modify their smart contract codes since not all may be compatible with sharding. For those already live on the network with no upgrade option, that may present a challenge in their execution due to the incompatibility.\n\nWhy Is Sharding Important?\n\nSharding offers a solution to the high gas fees and low transaction speeds that hinder the use of the Ethereum mainchain from mass adoption.\n\nOverly optimistic projections suggest sharding could help hit 100,000 transactions per second. Such speeds would present Ethereum as a convenient payment infrastructure that could rival mainstream payment rails.\n\nWith the number of participating nodes increasing, the power distribution also increases (provided there\u2019s no collusion). This would lead to increased security as a highly decentralized network lacks a single point of failure.\n\nSuccessful sharding implementation could open up new use cases for Ethereum as more businesses could choose to embrace the fast and secure transactions the network could provide. However, the successful implementation of sharding relies on the Ethereum developer community identifying potential challenges and developing solutions."

        "title": "Can Ethereum Reach $3,000? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Despite a rocky end to the summer, Ethereum (ETH -1.21%) is still up 37% for the year. But it has largely disappointed crypto investors who were expecting it to skyrocket in value after a key event this time last year.\n\nAfter surging past the $2,000 mark in mid-April, Ethereum has had a difficult time regaining the $2,000 level over the past four months, and bullish sentiment around the digital currency is clearly fading.\n\nCan Ethereum mount another rally to hit the $3,000 level? There are three key factors to consider. If it can deliver on all three, then the chances for a bull market rally become much higher. Let's take a closer look.\n\n1. Remain the market leader\n\nThe good news is that Ethereum continues to be the market leader in just about every niche of the blockchain and crypto world.\n\nTake non-fungible tokens (NFTs), for example. This is the one area where Ethereum first burst into prominence for many crypto investors, thanks to the emergence of best-selling NFT collections such as the Bored Ape Yacht Club and CryptoPunks.\n\nBased on current NFT sales data, these two collections continue to remain among the most valuable, and Ethereum continues to remain the No. 1 player in the NFT world on the basis of overall sales volume.\n\nIt's much the same story in decentralized finance (DeFi), another key niche of the blockchain world. Based on the latest data for total value locked (TVL), the leading metric used to assess overall DeFi strength, Ethereum remains No. 1 in DeFi as well.\n\nIn fact, it accounts for an astounding 57% of all TVL in the blockchain world. Yes, new entrants such as Base, the new blockchain from Coinbase Global, have been getting a lot of buzz of late, but no other blockchain even comes close to Ethereum.\n\n2. Deliver on a new strategic plan\n\nThat being said, I'm not expecting Ethereum to rest on its laurels. Yes, the change to a proof-of-stake model, known colloquially as \"The Merge,\" was by all accounts a technical tour de force, and yes, the crypto remains the market leader in many categories. But there are plenty of top-tier rivals nipping at its heels. So there is a need to continue to produce innovations and new market opportunities.\n\nThat's why I've been keeping a close eye on Ethereum's post-Merge road map, which can be thought of as its long-term strategic plan. It suggests that the crypto is hardly finished when it comes to updating, improving, and expanding the range of functionality of its blockchain.\n\nIn fact, co-founder Vitalik Buterin has outlined five new stages of development that outline upcoming technical changes to the Ethereum blockchain and what they will mean in terms of future performance.\n\nFor example, one of the next goals is to boost processing speeds on the blockchain to 100,000 transactions per second. That could create new opportunities to make it a world-class payments network, on par with today's top credit-card processing networks.\n\n3. Stay clear of regulators\n\nLastly, there's the issue of the ongoing regulatory crackdown on cryptocurrency. In February, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) started looking into crypto staking, which is vital to any proof-of-stake blockchain such as Ethereum.\n\nThen, in June, the SEC spooked the markets with lawsuits filed against top cryptocurrency exchanges Coinbase Global and Binance. And the SEC continues to hunt for cryptos that it believes to be unregistered securities.\n\nThrough it all, Ethereum has remained relatively unscathed. The problem, though, is that regulatory risk is never going to go away completely. SEC head Gary Gensler has never specifically targeted Ethereum, but he has sent plenty of signals that he might want to take a closer look at staking on the platform.\n\nThe long-term outlook\n\nAs long as Ethereum retains its leadership in key markets, delivers on its strategic plan, and remains free and clear of crypto's regulatory crackdown, I'm highly confident that it has the potential to reach the $3,000 mark.\n\nThat might sound like an aggressive goal, given that it represents a nearly 80% hike from today's price, but just keep in mind that Ethereum's all-time high from just two years ago is $4,891.70. For now, I'm both short-term and long-term bullish on Ethereum's prospects."

        "content": "The centralization of nodes is one of the biggest problems facing the Ethereum network and should be addressed by making the running of nodes cheaper and easier, according to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin.\n\nCurrently, the majority of the 5,901 active Ethereum nodes are being run through centralized web providers like Amazon Web Services, which many experts claim leaves the Ethereum blockchain exposed to a centralized point of failure.\n\nDistribution of Ethereum nodes from web service providers. Source: Ethernodes\n\nSpeaking at Korea Blockchain Week, Buterin outlined six key problems that need addressing to solve centralization but highlighted that the node issue was a \u201cbig piece of the puzzle\u201d to ensure the Ethereum network remains decentralized in the long run.\n\n\u201cOne of those six things is making it technically easier for people to run nodes and statelessness is one of the really important technologies in doing that right,\u201d he explained.\n\n\u201cToday, it takes hundreds of gigabytes of data to run a node. With stateless clients, you can run a node on basically zero.\u201d\n\nThe concept of statelessness refers to removing the reliance on centralized service providers to verify activity on the network. According to the Ethereum Foundation, true decentralization is not possible until node operators can run Ethereum on modest and inexpensive hardware.\n\nAs Buterin noted, statelessness forms a key component of the Ethereum roadmap, with major steps towards statelessness being made in \u201cThe Verge\u201d and \u201cThe Purge\u201d stages:\n\n\u201cIn the longer term there\u2019s a plan to maintain fully verified Ethereum nodes where you could literally it on your phone.\u201d\n\nDespite statelessness forming a core part of the Ethereum roadmap, Buterin admitted that these highly-technical concerns were unlikely to be addressed any time in the immediate future.\n\n\u201cThese technical problems will have to be addressed eventually \u2014 maybe a 10-year timescale, maybe a 20-year timescale,\u201d he said.\n\nRelated: Ethereum staking services agree to 22% limit of all validators\n\nOutside of statelessness, Buterin said the next most significant moves toward decreasing Ethereum centralization included making documentation easier, lowering barriers to distributed staking, ensuring staking was more secure and more broadly, making it more convenient to stake Ether (ETH) in general.\n\nUltimately however, Buterin concluded that the most time-sensitive and pressing concern for Ethereum as whole was achieving higher levels of scalability.\n\nAt present, Ethereum scaling protocols dominate the use of zero-knowledge (ZK) rollups.\n\nZK-rollups have been lauded by many within the Ethereum community as a key tool to achieving scalability, as ZK-rollups work to improve throughput on the main Ethereum chain by moving computation and state storage off-chain.\n\nCollect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space.\n\nMagazine: Here\u2019s how Ethereum\u2019s ZK-rollups can become interoperable"

Discover SCENE\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalk Buterin believes that future upgrades to the network could make it possible to run full nodes on mobile devices, helping to decentralize the network and improve its scalability.\n\nSpeaking during Korea Blockchain Week, Buterin addressed the decentralization and scalability challenges facing the Ethereum mainnet, as initially reported by CoinTelegraph.\n\n\u201cIn the longer term there\u2019s a plan to maintain fully verified Ethereum nodes where you could literally run it on your phone,\u201d Buterin told the conference, reiterating a point on the Ethereum roadmap.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFull nodes are computing devices that validate and verify all transactions and smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nCurrently, a full node requires hardware specifications including a solid state drive (SSD) larger than 2TB, along with 16 GB RAM. These requirements have increased the level of centralization, with most full nodes run on centralized servers like Amazon Web Services.\n\nButerin highlighted six key problems that must be addressed in order to solve centralization of the Ethereum network, calling full nodes a \u201cbig piece of the puzzle\u201d in the pursuit of greater decentralization on Ethereum.\n\nHe pointed to Ethereum\u2019s roadmap, which includes \u201cstateless clients\u201d using \u201cVerkle Trees,\u201d as a means of significantly reducing the hardware requirements for running full nodes on the network. He noted that, \u201cToday, it takes hundreds of gigabytes of data to run a node. With stateless clients, you can run a node on basically zero.\u201d\n\nStatelessness involves reducing the network\u2019s reliance from all nodes needing to store the entire state of the Ethereum blockchain to only requiring limited space for validating transactions. In a recent blog post, the Ethereum Foundation outlined the concept of weak statelessness, in which only block producers need access to full state data, while verifiers don\u2019t require the entire data.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHowever, Buterin also mentioned that implementation of statelessness comes with \u201ctechnical problems,\u201d which may be resolved in a \u201c10-year timescale, maybe a 20-year timescale.\u201d\n\nDistribution of staked ETH\n\nButerin also tackled other centralization concerns, including the need for a more widespread distribution of staked ETH and making documentation easier for developers and users.\n\nIn a recent message posted to the Reflexer Finance Discord community, he recommended adding \"non-dominant forms of staked ETH (excluding Lido)\" as new collateral options on the stablecoin lending platform.\n\nLido currently accounts for more than one-third of the total staked ETH, which has raised centralization concerns.\n\nLastly, Buterin emphasized that scalability remains the most pressing issue, with progress being made through the adoption of rollup solutions, especially those based on zero-knowledge proofs."

This indicated that the altcoin\u2019s futures market has become rife with more sell orders than buy orders.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nThe taker buy-sell ratio is a metric that measures the ratio between the buy volume and sell volume in an asset\u2019s futures market. A value greater than 1 indicates more buy volume than sell volume, while a value less than 1 indicates more sell volume than buy volume.\n\nAccording to a recently published report by CryptoQuant analyst who goes by the pseudonym \u2018Greatest_Trader,\u2019 ETH\u2019s taker buy-sell ratio has spent the past few months in a \u201cdownward trajectory\u201d to reach a yearly low at the end of last month.\n\nThe analyst said,\n\n\u201cThis consistent behavior underscores the dominant bearish sentiment among futures traders participating in Ethereum\u2019s market.\u201d\n\nThrough it all, market participants have continued to \u201clong\u201d ETH\n\nAn assessment of ETH\u2019s futures open interest confirms the trend. At $4.67 billion at press time, the coin\u2019s open interest was at its lowest mark so far this year. It began its descent on 19 April and has since fallen by 36%, data from Coinglass revealed.\n\nSince the open interest decline began, ETH has fallen from its $2000 psychological price level and has since failed to reclaim it. In the last 138 days, the coin has mostly traded in a tight range between $1600 and $1800.\n\nWith the context of recent market movements in mind, ETH\u2019s price consolidation and the attendant decline in its open interest show that the alt\u2019s holders have spent the past few months unwinding their large speculative positions as sentiment grows poorer.\n\nThe fall in open interest can also be due to cyclical factors, such as summer doldrums. Since June, the general market has traded sideways, with very few periods of price jumps.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nHowever, while the daily count of open positions in ETH\u2019s futures market has dwindled in the past few months, funding rates across leading cryptocurrency exchanges have been significantly positive.\n\nApart from the severe decline experienced on 12 March, ETH\u2019s funding rates have been positive for most of the year. This suggests that long positions have continued to outpace short positions in spite of sideways price movements."

        "content": "Qadir Ak is the founder of Coinpedia. He has over a decade of experience writing about technology and has been covering the blockchain and cryptocurrency space since 2010. He has also interviewed a few prominent experts within the cryptocurrency space.\n\nStory Highlights Ethereum is facing a problem with node centralization.\n\nVitalik Buterin proposed a solution called stateless clients.\n\nStatelessness will be introduced gradually into Ethereum's ecosystem.\n\nEthereum is facing a big issue. Too many of its computer servers, known as nodes, are run by a few big companies. This goes against the idea of decentralization that blockchain aims for. Addressing this issue, Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum\u2019s co-founder, took the spotlight at Korea Blockchain Week to outline potential solutions.\n\nHere\u2019s what happened.\n\nToo Many Eggs in One Basket?\n\nRight now, big service providers like Amazon host more than 5900 of Ethereum\u2019s nodes. This is risky because if Amazon has a problem, Ethereum could too. Buterin says it\u2019s crucial to make it easier and cheaper for regular people to run these nodes.\n\nVitalik Buterin's concerns about node centralization on Ethereum are valid and highlight a critical issue in the blockchain space. Centralization of nodes on services like AWS could potentially make the network more vulnerable to outages and censorship. The timeline of up to 20\u2026 \u2014 Crypto Simon (@TheCryptoSimon) September 5, 2023\n\nButerin introduced a revolutionary concept to tackle this issue\u2014statelessness. Running an Ethereum node currently demands an extensive storage capacity of hundreds of gigabytes. Stateless clients aim to drastically reduce these resource requirements. This approach not only encourages wider individual participation but also bolsters Ethereum\u2019s resilience against centralization risks.\n\nA Glimpse into \u2018The Verge\u2019 and \u2018The Purge\u2019\n\nButerin is known for his long-view approach, and he did not disappoint. Unveiling stages with names straight out of a sci-fi novel\u2014\u201cThe Verge\u201d and \u201cThe Purge\u201d\u2014he described how statelessness will be incrementally introduced into Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem. While this solution is not imminent, its phased rollout demonstrates a commitment to thoroughness and rigor. But he warns it could take years, maybe even decades, to solve this completely.\n\nRead More: Ethereum\u2019s On-Chain Activity Hits Yearly High as Market Remains Bearish\n\nButerin was quick to clarify that tackling node centralization is just one piece of a larger puzzle. He stressed the need for improved documentation, simplified staking procedures, and robust security mechanisms\u2014all aimed at creating a more inclusive and resilient network.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Scaling Issues\n\nAs if confronting centralization weren\u2019t enough, Buterin reiterated that scalability remains Ethereum\u2019s most pressing issue. He cited zero-knowledge (ZK) rollups, a technology designed to move computations off-chain, as a pivotal element in resolving Ethereum\u2019s throughput bottlenecks.\n\nTo round off a week of compelling developments, Buterin also made some notable transfers of Ether and Maker tokens. These financial maneuvers have stirred speculation, adding yet another layer to the complex narrative surrounding Ethereum\u2019s future.\n\nThe road ahead\n\nWhile immediate solutions may be elusive, the groundwork laid at Korea Blockchain Week reflects a depth of understanding and a commitment to long-term viability. Ethereum, it appears, is positioning itself not as a mere participant but as a leader in the decentralization revolution.\n\nThis Might Interest You: Unraveling Raoul Pal\u2019s Approach to Investing in Ethereum and Beyond"

        "title": "Ether price risks losing the $1.6K support as multiple ETH price metrics decline - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Ether's price surged by 31.3% from March 10 to March 18, coinciding with the Federal Reserve\u2019s injection of $300 billion to address the insolvency of Silicon Valley Bank. Since then, Ether\u2019s (ETH) price has consistently maintained a daily closing price above $1,600.\n\nHowever, investors are now casting doubt on Ether\u2019s ability to sustain this support level, given the prevailing bearish sentiment in the cryptocurrency space and declining metrics on the Ethereum network.\n\nOver the past six months, the cryptocurrency sector has been plagued by negative developments. Notably, the Digital Currency Group (DCG), the owner of the Grayscale mutual fund manager, has faced financial troubles. Concerns are mounting that a portion of the $4.8 billion worth of ETH deposits held in the Grayscale Ethereum Trust could be liquidated to address DCG's debts.\n\nFurthermore, two major global exchanges, Binance and Coinbase, are currently facing legal action from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Additionally, investors initially expressed excitement when several requests for futures-based Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) surfaced in early August. However, it's important to note that these instruments, unlike spot ETFs, would not involve actual ETH coins if approved.\n\nOn-chain metrics point to declining demand\n\nAside from a handful of unfavorable market conditions, Ethereum\u2019s on-chain metrics point to a stagnation in demand, both in terms of ETH investments and smart contract transactions.\n\nNumber of Ethereum addresses with a minimum $1,000 deposit in ETH. Source: Coin Metrics\n\nNotably, the number of Ethereum addresses holding a minimum of $1,000 worth of ETH deposits has reached its lowest level in nearly six months. This is concerning, considering that Ether\u2019s price reached a peak of $2,130 in mid-April, which should have attracted new investors.\n\nPart of the lack of investor interest can be attributed to the fact that Ethereum\u2019s average transaction fee has remained above $4 for the past six months. Consequently, despite fluctuations in network staking metrics, there appears to be no increase in the total number of investors when using the $1,000 threshold as a proxy.\n\nMoreover, data on decentralized application (DApps) activity on the Ethereum network corroborates the notion of a dearth of new users.\n\nEthereum network top DApps, 30-day active addresses. Source: DappRadar\n\nEven excluding the significant 60% decline in the Uniswap NFT Aggregator, the average number of active addresses across the top Ethereum network DApps decreased by 4% compared to the previous month.\n\nFrom cryptocurrency games to decentralized exchanges, nonfungible token marketplaces and Web3 services, every sector has witnessed a decline in the number of active users, according to DappRadar. Regarding token activity on the network, with the exception of stablecoins and Wrapped ETH, no project has recorded more than 13,000 unique receiver addresses over the past week.\n\nTop token by unique receivers, last 7 days. Source: Etherscan\n\nThis analysis underscores the fact that Ethereum\u2019s network is currently constrained by its relatively high transaction fees, which limits the number of active users. Without an uptick in network activity, the catalysts for a price recovery are lacking, such as potential network upgrades and implementations that could lead to lower costs or enhanced user privacy.\n\nCompetitors are benefiting from the stablecoin volumes\n\nIn the meantime, recent developments have left Ethereum enthusiasts somewhat disappointed. Visa, the payment processor, has incorporated Solana blockchain settlement capabilities, following Circle\u2019s USD Coin (USDC) introducing native accounts and transfers on the Base chain. In response, Coinbase promptly announced its intention to assist partners in converting old, bridged versions of USDC to the new format.\n\nFurthermore, Rune Christensen, co-founder of MakerDAO, has put forth a proposal to develop the decentralized finance project's upcoming native chain based on Solana's codebase despite its longstanding affiliation with Ethereum.\n\nIn light of the prevailing bearish sentiment in the cryptocurrency market, which includes exchanges facing legal challenges from the SEC and diminishing interest in cryptocurrencies, as indicated by the latest Google Trends data, the likelihood of Ether\u2019s price dipping below the $1,600 support level has increased.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

        "content": "Image: Shutterstock\n\nAlex Gluchowski, the co-founder and CEO of Matter Labs, has unveiled a groundbreaking concept that could reshape blockchain governance and security. He proposed the creation of an \"Ethereum Supreme Court\" within the Ethereum network, a unique idea aimed at offering a final recourse for parties involved in disputes related to smart contracts.The Ethereum Supreme Court concept represents a comprehensive strategy designed to enhance the robustness of governance and security mechanisms operating within the Ethereum ecosystem. At its core, this proposal aims to provide a structured framework for addressing conflicts and challenges that may arise in the realm of smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.Gluchowski's motivation behind this ambitious idea is to create a robust barrier against malicious players and external political interference while elevating Ethereum's status as a secure and dependable network. By establishing a system akin to real-world legal structures, the Ethereum Supreme Court concept seeks to instil confidence in the Ethereum network's ability to uphold contractual agreements and resolve disputes fairly and effectively.The heart of this innovative proposal lies in forming a network of on-chain courts, each equipped with its own governance structure reminiscent of the hierarchical nature of traditional legal systems. These courts would handle disputes and manage critical upgrades within the Ethereum ecosystem. The proposal introduces a layered approach, culminating in the \"Court of Final Appeal\" at the Ethereum Layer-1 level, which would serve as the highest authority.Protocols would designate unique contracts capable of triggering an appeal process to facilitate the resolution of disputes and initiating emergency upgrades. An appeal period would be instituted, allowing Ethereum users to submit challenges during this window. Submitting a challenge would necessitate a predefined bail deposit, ensuring that only substantial and legitimate disputes advance.Alex Gluchowski's proposal for the \"Ethereum Supreme Court\" can potentially revolutionise how blockchain networks handle disputes and governance. This concept seeks to fortify Ethereum's security and autonomy and aims to enhance its reputation as a dependable network. However, navigating the path to implementation will require overcoming challenges, including garnering broad community support and addressing cost-related considerations. The Ethereum community now stands at a crossroads, contemplating the possibility of a transformational shift in its governance and security mechanisms."

The fund would provide traditional investors with a way to invest in a fund that is physically backed by Ethereum (ETH) without the need to purchase or hold cryptocurrency itself directly. Furthermore, Ark\u2019s spot Ethereum ETF would be the first of its type if it is successful.\n\nCathie Wood, CEO and CIO of Ark Invest, commented on the ambitious nature of the plan in light of the fact that no equivalent Bitcoin fund exists. She told Bloomberg:\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been so much regulatory controversy about a Bitcoin spot ETF that I guess many people thought it was a step too far \u2014 but we don\u2019t \u2026 And it\u2019s always nice to be first.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Ophelia Snyder, co-founder and president of 21Shares, suggested that Grayscale\u2019s victory against the SEC \u2014 which will see Grayscale press the agency to approve its GBTC ETF conversion \u2014 influenced the timing of its own application. Snyder added that Ethereum market fundamentals also spurred its application.\n\nETH application follows BTC attempts\n\nArk is additionally pursuing a Bitcoin spot ETF alongside its latest Ethereum application. Following an application from BlackRock in June, Ark and many other asset managers filed similar applications to offer a Bitcoin spot ETF.\n\nThose applications are seen as promising due to BlackRock\u2019s role as a financial giant and due to each filing\u2019s inclusion of a Coinbase surveillance-sharing agreement.\n\nWood commented on the current situation in August. She correctly predicted that the SEC would delay a decision around the latest spot Bitcoin ETF applications; however, she said that she believes the SEC will eventually approve multiple applications for a spot Bitcoin ETF due to the fact that most current applications are similar.\n\nDespite widespread optimism, no spot Bitcoin or spot Ethereum ETF has been approved to date. In fact, Ark\u2019s own Bitcoin ETF applications are among those previously declined by the SEC. The firm faced its latest rejection in January 2023.\n\nArk also has other ETF applications underway, including one fund tied to Bitcoin and Ether futures. The SEC has previously approved Bitcoin futures ETFs."

Discover SCENE\n\nCathie Wood\u2019s Ark Invest moved to establish America\u2019s first spot Ethereum ETF on Wednesday, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nDubbed the ARK 21Shares Ethereum ETF, the application resembles those for spot Bitcoin ETFs that were recently delayed by the SEC. The regulator said last week that it needs more time to decide on several following Grayscale\u2019s recent courtroom victory.\n\nArk Invest named Coinbase as a custodian in its application, meaning the crypto exchange would hold onto Ethereum that backing the shares of Ark Invest\u2019s ETF. The ETF itself would be traded on the Cboe BZX Exchange.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe SEC has received multiple applications for futures-based Ethereum ETFs, but Ark Invest\u2019s bid resembles a step beyond that, considering futures-based Bitcoin ETFs have traded in the U.S. since ProShares' launched on the New York Stock Exchange 2021.\n\nTwo years later, futures-based ETFs seem like a logical place for Ethereum to make its Wall Street debut. Anticipation has grown the SEC could approve a wave of Ethereum futures ETFs, which track the price of derivatives traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), as soon as October.\n\nWeeks before the SEC\u2019s recent spat of Bitcoin-related delays, Ark Invest\u2019s application for a spot Bitcoin ETF was drawn out by the regulator too. ARK Invest first filed for a spot Bitcoin ETF in June 2021.\n\nIn terms of futures-based Ethereum ETFs, the SEC has told hopefuls to pull applications around a week after they\u2019re filed, according the Bloomberg\u2019s senior ETF analyst Eric Baclhunas. But this time around, they\u2019ve stayed on the SEC\u2019s desk.\n\nOn Wednesday, Baclhunas said in a Tweet that other companies are likely to follow in Ark Invest\u2019s footsteps quite quickly. He said there are probably more applications coming if they aren\u2019t already imminent.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nhttps://twitter.com/EricBalchunas?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\n\nWhen the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit recently sided with Grayscale, it said the SEC\u2019s previous denial of an application from Grayscale to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into a spot ETF was \u201ccapricious.\u201d\n\nIn the decision, the court said market manipulation concerns\u2014which the SEC has cited repeatedly in swatting away applications since 2013\u2014weren\u2019t coherent enough, given the SEC has greenlit futures-based Bitcoin ETFs in the past.\n\nIn Ark Invest\u2019s application on Wednesday, the firm proposes that the Cboe BZX Exchange\u2019s ability to obtain information about activity in the CME\u2019s Ethereum futures market should be sufficient to abate concerns previously articulated by the SEC."

        "content": "ETH staked was over 28 million at press time.\n\nLikewise, ETH staked through Lido stood at over 8 million.\n\nEthereum [ETH] staking has seen a consistent rise in participation since its inception. With the increasing popularity of ETH staking, Lido\u2019s [LDO] share of the staking market has also expanded, leading to certain concerns.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nEthereum staking and Lido\u2019s dominance keeps rising\n\nAccording to Ethereum\u2019s staking chart on CryptoQuant, the press time amount of ETH staked exceeded 28 million. What\u2019s particularly notable in the chart was the significant surge in Ethereum staking, with this upward trend becoming evident around April.\n\nAdditionally, data from Dune Analytics indicated that the total ETH staked accounted for approximately 22% of the total ETH in circulation.\n\nHowever, the most intriguing aspect emerged when the percentage of ETH staked through Lido was examined. According to Dune Analytics, Lido commanded 32.4% of the total ETH staked, amounting to more than 8 million ETH.\n\nIn comparison, the closest competing platform had approximately 2 million ETH staked as of this writing.\n\nGiven Lido\u2019s pronounced dominance in the Ethereum staking landscape, concerns regarding the centralization of the Ethereum network have recently arisen.\n\nLido\u2019s Ethereum staking dominance sparks concerns\n\nRyan Berckmans has expressed concern that the increasing dominance of Lido may lead to Ethereum being viewed as a centralized platform.\n\nBerckmans cautioned that this growing centralization could potentially damage Ethereum\u2019s reputation, particularly in the eyes of corporations and governments, and undermine its aspirations of becoming a globally recognized settlement layer within the financial system.\n\nimo, the realistic worst-case scenario for Lido's uncapped dominance isn't network disruption. It's that Ethereum develops a reputation among corporations and governments as having been \"captured\" or \"not actually that decentralized relative to other chains\".

        "title": "Visa Expands Stablecoin Settlement Capabilities to Merchant Acquirers - Business Wire",
        "content": "SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Visa (NYSE: V), a global leader in payments, announced its next step in modernizing cross-border money movement. Visa is expanding its stablecoin settlement capabilities to the high-performing Solana blockchain and is working with merchant acquirers Worldpay and Nuvei.\n\nThrough live pilots with issuers and acquirers, Visa has already moved millions of USDC between its partners over the Solana and Ethereum blockchain networks to settle fiat-denominated payments authorized over VisaNet.\n\nWhen consumers use Visa cards to make a purchase at any of the millions of Visa-accepting merchant locations around the world, they can experience the convenience of nearly instant payment authorizations. But what they don\u2019t see is that the funds used for their purchase need to move between their bank (the issuer) and the merchant\u2019s bank (the acquirer). This is where Visa\u2019s treasury and settlement systems enable the clearing, settlement and movement of billions in transactions a day, making sure the correct amount in the preferred currency is received from the issuer and sent to the acquirer. This process happens seamlessly between nearly 15K financial institutions and across more than 25 currencies globally.\n\n\u201cBy leveraging stablecoins like USDC and global blockchain networks like Solana and Ethereum, we're helping to improve the speed of cross-border settlement and providing a modern option for our clients to easily send or receive funds from Visa\u2019s treasury,\u201d said Cuy Sheffield, Head of Crypto, Visa. \u201cVisa is committed to being on the forefront of digital currency and blockchain innovation and leveraging these new technologies to help improve the way we move money.\u201d\n\nBuilding on the Crypto.com Pilot\n\nIn 2021, Visa began testing how USDC could be used inside its treasury operations which led to a pilot with Crypto.com, making Visa one of the first major payments networks to test stablecoin settlement on the issuance side. This work led to a successful pilot leveraging USDC and the Ethereum blockchain to receive payments from Crypto.com for cross-border volume on their live card program in Australia. Crypto.com now uses USDC to fulfill its settlement obligations on the Visa card in Australia and intends to roll out this capability in other markets.\n\nBefore that pilot, settlement for cross-border purchases made on Crypto.com Visa cards required a days-long currency conversion process and costly international wire transfers. Now, Crypto.com can send USDC cross-border over the Ethereum blockchain directly to a Visa treasury managed Circle account which helps reduce the time and complexity of international wire transfers.\n\n\u201cWe are excited about the USDC use cases Visa and its partners are driving to create fundamental blockchain innovation,\u201d said Jeremy Allaire, Co-founder and CEO, Circle. \u201cCircle built USDC to provide a functional digital dollar that could move at the speed of the internet to facilitate secure, reliable payments. Expanding the pilot exemplifies how pairing USDC with Visa\u2019s innovation opens up the future of payments, commerce and financial applications.\u201d\n\nMoving from Issuers to Acquirers\n\nWhile Visa\u2019s treasury operation continues to test receiving funds onchain from multiple issuer partners, with these new settlement options Visa can send funds onchain to acquirers like Worldpay and Nuvei to help speed up settlement times for their merchants.\n\nWorldpay and Nuvei are global acquirers serving merchants worldwide from a diverse range of sectors. This includes a growing number of merchants interacting with the blockchain and crypto economy including on-ramp providers, games, and NFT marketplaces who may prefer to receive stablecoins over traditional fiat currencies for the card payments they accept. Using Visa\u2019s own Circle account, Visa can now manage settlement payouts in USDC to Worldpay and Nuvei who can then route these payments in USDC to their end merchants.\n\nAdding Support for the Solana Blockchain Network\n\nAs Visa looked to expand this capability to additional clients, there has been significant demand to leverage newer, high performance blockchains that can send and receive stablecoins with higher speed and lower costs. For these reasons, Visa chose to add support for Solana as a high performance blockchain that its partners can choose to send or receive USDC settlement payments. This makes Visa one of the first major payments companies at scale to directly utilize Solana for live settlement payments between its clients. The Solana blockchain sees 400 millisecond block times, averages 400 transactions per second (TPS) and typically surges to more than 2K TPS1 across a variety of use cases during periods of peak demand.\n\nForging New Partnerships\n\nWith an eye towards the future in an increasingly digital financial landscape, Visa is forging ahead with new partnerships and embracing the innovative potential of digital currencies. Visa\u2019s work with Worldpay and Nuvei represents a significant stride in this direction.\n\n\u201cVisa's USDC settlement capability enables Worldpay to bring more of our treasury operations in-house and allows us to offer merchants more choices for receiving funds,\u201d said Jim Johnson, President of Worldpay Merchant Solutions, FIS. \u201cDiversifying funding options and increasing flexibility is critical to serving the changing needs of global merchants in today\u2019s rapidly evolving commerce landscape.\u201d\n\n\u201cStablecoins like USDC are cutting edge payments technology that can enable online businesses around the world to accelerate their growth,\u201d said Philip Fayer, Chair and CEO, Nuvei. \u201cOptimizing cross-border transactions is only one use case where stablecoins can benefit businesses. As a leading global payments company, we are constantly focused on innovation, and we\u2019re excited to work with Visa to bring these capabilities to our partners.\u201d\n\nAbout Visa\n\nVisa (NYSE: V) is a world leader in digital payments, facilitating transactions between consumers, merchants, financial institutions and government entities across more than 200 countries and territories. Our mission is to connect the world through the most innovative, convenient, reliable and secure payments network, enabling individuals, businesses and economies to thrive. We believe that economies that include everyone everywhere, uplift everyone everywhere and see access as foundational to the future of money movement.

While many remain hopeful of an eventual blessing from the agency, the optimism isn\u2019t being reflected on the technical charts of BTC/USD just yet.\n\nBTC/USD Weekly Chart\n\nChart Created by Manish Jaradi Using TradingView\n\nBTC/USD is now testing key support at the June low of 24750 \u2013 this support is crucial as a break below would disrupt the higher-highs-higher-lows sequence since late 2022. Furthermore, such a break would trigger a double top (the April and July highs), pointing to a deeper retracement toward the March low of 19550.\n\nBTC/USD Daily Chart\n\nChart Created by Manish Jaradi Using TradingView\n\nThe recent weakness follows an inability to rise past the upper edge of the Ichimoku cloud on the weekly charts, roughly coinciding with a slightly upward-sloping trendline from 2021 and the 89-week moving average.

This support is crucial for the broader recovery from the end of 2022 to continue. Any break below would confirm that the bullish bias had dissipated.

        "content": "Share:\n\nBitcoin price could fall soon, with the $24,995 multi-month support level barely holding.\n\nEthereum price tests the $1,621 support level with a 5% drop down in sight unless this bullish divergence pans out.\n\nRipple price must hold above $0.4800 or risk a retest of the May lows at $0.4191.\n\nBitcoin, Ethereum, and Ripple prices are consolidating tightly along their current support levels. While BTC shows signs of a continued trend, the ETH daily chart says otherwise.\n\nAlso Read: BlackRock deliberately driving down Bitcoin price in anticipation for Spot BTC ETF approval, analyst says\n\nBitcoin price readies for a fall\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price is treading on dangerous grounds, exhausting the $24,995 support level after a longstanding consolidation. Unless the king of crypto finds its footing, it could soon lose the aforementioned support, and descend to the psychological $24,000 level. In the dire case, expect an extended hobble to the demand zone at $21,915, where some buying activity could finally present. This assumption comes as demand zones are often populated by buyers.\n\nNotably, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is inclined south and could soon cross below the signal line (yellow band). Such a move is often interpreted as a sell signal. Also notable, the histogram bars of the Awesome Oscillator (AO) are negative, suggesting bears have the upper hand.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the flip side, with the $24,995 support level acting as a buyer congestion zone, bullish momentum above this level could send Bitcoin price north, potentially confronting the 200-, 50-, and 100-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) at $27,085, $27,830, and $27,522 levels respectively, before the $29,692 resistance is activated.\n\nWhile overcoming this barricade would be ideal, Bitcoin price would remain in the woods until after a decisive daily candlestick close above the $31,518 level.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin set to form death cross as Dollar Index teases Golden crossover.\n\nEthereum price could fall if the RSI divergence fails\n\nEthereum (ETH) price is inclined towards the downside, recording lower lows as the price tests the $1,621 support level. Meanwhile, the RSI is recording higher highs, with the disparity presenting a bullish divergence. This forecasts a possible move north, but it all depends on whether the $1,621 support level holds. If it does not, ETH could fall 5% to the $1,552 support level. The negative AO adds credence to the bearish outlook.\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nConversely, if the bullish divergence works out, Ethereum price could pull north, past the $1,701 hurdle before confronting the 50-, 200- and 100-day EMAs at $1,741, $1,765, and $1,778, respectively. The $1,841 could be overcome in highly ambitious cases, but the bearish outlook would only be invalidated once the Proof-of-Stake token makes it above the $2,008 level.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum whales accumulate ETH as researchers explore scaling beyond EIP-4844.\n\nRipple price bulls are not acting\n\nRipple (XRP) continues to stagnate despite swimming in a demand zone, suggesting bulls are sitting on their hands. This exposes XRP to a slump, possibly sending it below the critical support at $0.4800, which is the mean threshold of the order block. A decisive break below this level would whiplash any short-term hope of a bullish case, with the price possibly breaking below the lower base of the demand zone at $0.4600.\n\nIn a dire case, Ripple price could extend to the August 17 intraday low of $0.4191, marking a 15% drop below current levels. The RSI is also heading down, pointing to falling momentum.\n\nXRP/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the flip side, the AO histograms are edging toward the midline with consistently green bars, showing that bulls maintain a presence in the market. Increased activity from this cohort of traders could send XRP higher, flipping the 200-day EMA hurdle into support and potentially using it as a jumping-off point for more gains. In such a case, the $0.5040 mark would be the level to beat, considering it is where the 100- and 50-day EMA converge at $0.5567 and $0.5624 levels, respectively.\n\nAlso Read: XRP to power international remittance for banks in Philippines, Vietnam and Indonesia through SBI Remit"

The asset\u2019s price is down 10.8% in the past 30 days, struggling to reclaim the $1,700 price level, according to data from CoinGecko at the time of writing.\n\nAmid the asset\u2019s price struggles, significant ETH transfers to Coinbase have stoked the flames of uncertainty. Is a price dump incoming?\n\nRoutine Internal Movement of Funds or Impending Selloff?\n\nOn Monday, September 4, blockchain tracker Whale Alert sent ripples through the crypto community by revealing that unknown whales had sent approximately 300k ETH to Coinbase in two equal transactions of about 150k ETH.\n\nThe large ETH transfers to Coinbase highlighted by Whale Alert. Source: Twitter\n\nReporting the huge and startling transfers on Tuesday, September 5, Wu Blockchain revealed that Arkham Intelligence data labeled the wallets as Coinbase cold wallets, noting that after the initial deposit to the exchange, the funds had been split into tranches of 4282 ETH sent to multiple addresses. While this increases the likelihood that it is a routine internal movement of funds, doubts remain.\n\nAccording to Whale Alert, about 300,000 ETH (approximately $488 million) was transferred from two wallets to Coinbase. The two wallet addresses are both Coinbase cold wallet addresses. After being transferred to the Coinbase hot wallet, they were transferred to multiple addresses\u2026 \u2014 Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) September 5, 2023\n\nChiming in, Santiment noted that the transfers are among the largest of 2023 and have led to the most significant on-chain transaction spike since June 13. Still, the firm maintained that the move might not impact the price action of ETH.\n\nETH\u2019s Price Reaction\n\nDespite initial fears, ETH\u2019s price has yet to react to the development. The asset is trading for $1,637 at the time of writing, up 0.7% in the last 24 hours, per data from CoinGecko.\n\nAt the same time, the asset\u2019s market cap has also experienced a mild bump. At $197.17 billion, it represents a 0.59% increase in the past 24 hours, per data from CoinMarketCap.\n\nUsers had initially feared a selloff as exchange transfers usually indicate an interest to sell.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nThe reason for the transfers remains unclear.\n\nETH\u2019s price remains unfazed.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nCrypto transfers to exchanges typically indicate an intent to sell.

We are pleased to date with the outpouring of support we have received from other shareholders in the trusts who want to join Alameda in its fight to hold Grayscale accountable for its egregious violations. Shareholders of the trusts are determined to recover lost value and demand justice for Grayscale\u2019s consistent failure to protect shareholders\u2019 interests. We urge others to sign on and join to ensure our case can proceed.\u201d\n\nSince Alameda first filed in March, it\u2019s received overwhelming support from trust shareholders. In addition, numerous funds, family offices and individual shareholders have expressed interest in joining, including:\n\nFir Tree Partners\n\nSaba Capital\n\nOwl Creek Asset Management\n\nAristides Capital\n\n\u201cSince last year, Fir Tree Partners has been seeking to hold Grayscale accountable for its massive ongoing destruction of shareholder value at GBTC,\u201d said Sachin Gupta, managing director at Fir Tree Partners. \u201cWe strongly support this effort by Alameda and dozens of other shareholders to recover the exorbitant management fees that have been extracted from the Grayscale Bitcoin and Ethereum Trusts and to force Grayscale to allow redemptions so that the trusts\u2019 long-time discount to NAV can finally be reversed.\u201d\n\n\u201cGrayscale has enriched itself at shareholders\u2019 expense,\u201d said David Bailey, general partner at UTXO Management. \u201cWe\u2019re not standing for it any longer and neither should any other shareholder. We\u2019ve joined this lawsuit to recover the value in our digital assets and we encourage other shareholders to sign on too. It\u2019s time to band together so we can get back the money that belongs to Grayscale shareholders, not Grayscale\u2019s principals.\u201d\n\nBackground\n\nOn March 6, 2023, Alameda filed a lawsuit in the Delaware Court of Chancery against Grayscale and its controllers, seeking to:\n\nRecoup Grayscale\u2019s historically excessive fees.\n\nReduce fees to a reasonable rate going forward.\n\nOpen redemptions so that shares once again track the trusts\u2019 asset values consistent with the investment purpose of each trust.\n\nAlameda\u2019s seeking the repayment of hundreds of millions of dollars to the trusts and a ruling that Grayscale and its controllers have breached their obligations under the trust documents and Delaware law by failing to ensure Grayscale\u2019s sponsor\u2019s fees are competitive and by failing to open a shareholder redemption program that could reverse the discount at which the trusts are trading. The changes Alameda seeks would maximize the trusts\u2019 assets into the future and cause share values to better reflect the value of the trusts\u2019 holdings.\n\nIn response, Grayscale has argued that the trusts\u2019 governing documents require Alameda\u2019s litigation to be brought collectively by shareholders currently owning a minimum of 10% of the shares of each trust. As a result, Alameda and other shareholders are seeking support from current shareholders in the trusts prepared to join the effort to ensure this litigation proceeds.\n\nAdvisors\n\nThe FTX debtors are represented in this action by Quinn Emanuel Urquhart and Sullivan, LLP as legal counsel, and Abrams and Bayliss LLP as Delaware counsel. In their chapter 11 cases, the FTX debtors are also represented by Sullivan and Cromwell LLP as legal counsel, and Landis Rath and Cobb LLP as Delaware counsel. UTXO Management and its affiliates are represented in this action by Balch and Bingham LLP as legal counsel, and Ashby and Geddes, P.A. as Delaware counsel.\n\nBalch & Bingham LLP also represents most shareholders who have agreed to join the suit to date on a contingency basis and will represent additional co-plaintiffs who seek to join the suit on the same basis. Shareholders represented by Balch and Bingham will also be represented in Delaware by Ashby and Geddes, P.A. Meanwhile, Fir Tree Partners, which has expressed strong interest in joining Alameda\u2019s lawsuit as a co-plaintiff, is represented by Willkie Farr and Gallaher LLP as well as Potter Anderson and Corroon LLP.\n\nSource: Alameda Research Ltd., UTXO Management, and Balch and Bingham LLP"

        "title": "Top 3 Price Prediction Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple: Possible moves as BTC goes back to consolidation mode - FXStreet",
        "content": "Share:\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price is back to consolidation after the recent Grayscale-infused data provided market impales. Ethereum (ETH) price is following in a path almost similar to BTC, but Ripple (XRP) price would not yield.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin price likely to fall 10% from current levels this September, crypto analyst says\n\nCryptocurrency metrics FAQs What is circulating supply? The developer or creator of each cryptocurrency decides on the total number of tokens that can be minted or issued. Only a certain number of these assets can be minted by mining, staking or other mechanisms. This is defined by the algorithm of the underlying blockchain technology. Since its inception, a total of 19,445,656 BTCs have been mined, which is the circulating supply of Bitcoin. On the other hand, circulating supply can also be decreased via actions such as burning tokens, or mistakenly sending assets to addresses of other incompatible blockchains. What is market capitalization? Market capitalization is the result of multiplying the circulating supply of a certain asset by the asset\u2019s current market value. For Bitcoin, the market capitalization at the beginning of August 2023 is above $570 billion, which is the result of the more than 19 million BTC in circulation multiplied by the Bitcoin price around $29,600. What is trading volume? Trading volume refers to the total number of tokens for a specific asset that has been transacted or exchanged between buyers and sellers within set trading hours, for example, 24 hours. It is used to gauge market sentiment, this metric combines all volumes on centralized exchanges and decentralized exchanges. Increasing trading volume often denotes the demand for a certain asset as more people are buying and selling the cryptocurrency. What is funding rate? Funding rates are a concept designed to encourage traders to take positions and ensure perpetual contract prices match spot markets. It defines a mechanism by exchanges to ensure that future prices and index prices periodic payments regularly converge. When the funding rate is positive, the price of the perpetual contract is higher than the mark price. This means traders who are bullish and have opened long positions pay traders who are in short positions. On the other hand, a negative funding rate means perpetual prices are below the mark price, and hence traders with short positions pay traders who have opened long positions.\n\nBitcoin price back to consolidation\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price has fallen back to its longstanding range bound movement, coiling up around the $25,824 level. Two outcomes are likely after such a move, a break north or south. Currently, the odds favor the downside and BTC could draw nearer to the $24,995 support level and extend the losses to the psychological $24,000.\n\nIn the dire case, Bitcoin price could dip into the demand zone between $21,711 and $20,155. This outlook draws inspiration from the Relative Strength Index (RSI), currently declining to show falling momentum. Similarly, the histogram bars of the Awesome Oscillator flash red to suggest a presence of bears in the market.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-day chart\n\nConversely, a renaissance by the bulls could alter the impending fate for Bitcoin price, with a possible foray back above the psychological $28,000, level last tested on August 29. Increased buyer momentum could send the flagship crypto past the $29,692 barricade, or in a highly bullish case, shatter the $31,518 obstacle.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin investors expect more downside, Vitalik Buterin sells his MKR holdings\n\nEthereum price tests $1,630 support level\n\nEthereum (ETH) price is barely holding above the $1,630 support level, even as BTC shows weakness. Increased seller momentum could send the price lower, potentially breaching the $1,522 support level. A decisive flip of this buyer congestion level into resistance would solidify the downtrend for the short term and mark a 5% landslide.\n\nLike BTC, the momentum indicators point to a similar outcome as momentum is steadily declining and the RSI could soon activate a signal to sell ETH when it crosses below the signal line (yellow band). Traders heeding this call would bode poorly for ETH.\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the other hand, late or sidelined investors could salvage Ethereum price from the impending slump, with a possible move above the $1,701 resistance level. Increased buying pressure from this level could see ETH ascend to confront the mid-August highs around $1,835, or in the highly ambitious cases, attempt to break from current gloom by making a strong reach above $2,008.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum Cancun upgrade development is on track, testing phase comes next\n\nRipple price goes AWOL\n\nRipple (XRP) price is nurturing a uptrend that could materialize if early profit takers keep their profit appetite in check. The token boasts three successive green candlesticks, pointing to bulls gaining ground.\n\nIncreased buying pressure could sustain the uptrend, sending Ripple price above the immediate hurdle at $0.5667, which stands as multi-month resistance level barring two equal highs and therefore significant.\n\nHigher, Ripple price would have a shot at reclaiming the ground lost after the July 13 ascent, first breaching the $0.6840 level before taking back control with a solid move above the $0.8193 resistance level.\n\nNoteworthy the RSI had executed a bullish crossover, moving above the signal line in an attempt to siren a buy signal. Traders harkening to this call could enhance the uptrend for Ripple price. The AO makes the bullish outlook stronger, with the histogram bars soaking in green and edging toward the midline. This adds credence to the bullish outlook.\n\nXRP/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the other side, early profit takers from XRP holders who are incurring losses at current price or breaking even and looking for early exits to escape losses could sell the remittance token, so much so that the demand zone between $0.5040 and $0.4600 fails to hold as support. A decisive break below the mean threshold (midline of demand zone marked in blue) would invalidate the bullish thesis, exposing XRP to an extrapolated slump toward the $0.4191 support level.\n\n\n\nBreaking: Ripple files opposition to SEC\u2019s motion to certify interlocutory appeal"

        "content": "Crypto enthusiasts expected Ethereum (ETH) to flip Bitcoin (BTC) after the Merge, the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade in September 2022. But nothing has happened so far.\n\nMoreover, on Sep. 1, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) delayed the approval of the Ethereum Futures exchange-traded fund (ETF) and a spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nWhile ETH drops in an already depressed market, VC Spectra (SPCT) is firm in its ongoing presale.\n\nHopes for ETH bull run fade after SEC postponements\n\nETH bulls were confident after the Merge in September 2022.

        "title": "ETH Price Could Outperform Bitcoin In September and October - CoinGape",
        "content": "ETH price bulls are starting to get a hold of the bearish situation with clear intentions of fighting for a trend reversal. The second largest crypto is up 1.2% on Wednesday to $1,635 although the trading volume remains significantly depressed at $5.6 billion. Its market capitalization worth $196 billion has been on a persistent slope since June.\n\nCan ETH Price Clear The Barricades To $2,000?\n\nEthereum live price has since the sell-off in August remained range bound between support at $1,600 and the upper limit resistance at $1,730. After making a strong attempt to escape the range barrier late in August, fueled by the hype surrounding Grayscale Investments\u2019 win against the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the appeals court, ETH price trimmed the gains, resting the support at $1,630.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe path with the least resistance appears to have flipped to the upside, bolstered by a buy signal from the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator. As the blue MACD line crosses above the red signal line and the momentum indicator generally assumes an uptrend to the mean line and later into the positive region, traders become confident in their decisions to seek exposure to long positions in Ether.\n\nHolding onto the short-term support at $1,630 would be instrumental for the uptrend continuation. However, traders should consider the plausible bottlenecks, starting with the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) (red) at $1,645, the 100-day EMA (blue) at $1,668 and the 200-day EMA (purple) at $1,715.\n\nProfit-booking can take place at any of those moving averages, which could slow down the uptrend. However, long-term holders of Ether are likely to compensate for the lost momentum as they keep their positions intact amid speculations of the SEC approving the first Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) futures this September.\n\nA break out of the range channel on the upside would affirm the bullish grip and increase investor confidence in the uptrend to $2,000.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that, the ETF futures approval could be the catalyst ETH price needs to escape the bearish shackles in the range. According to the Stochastic oscillator, bulls may struggle to close the gap to the range limit at $1,730 \u2013 a situation that could result in increased selling pressure.\n\nInvestors can hold their long positions as long as Ethereum is wobbling within the range limits. It is too early to rule out another sell-off, where Ether slides below $1,600 to seek support at $1,400 and $1,200 if push comes to shove.\n\nCan ETH Price Outperform Bitcoin?\n\nA report released by research firm K33 suggests that Ethereum could outperform Bitcoin in September and October if the first ETF futures receives approval for listing. According to experts in the industry, chances are high that the SEC will green-light the investment product.\n\nVetle Lunde, a senior analyst at the firm believes the futures-based ETF product would significantly boost ETH price, citing a 60% spike in Bitcoin following a similar approval a couple of years ago.\n\n\u201cThe odds are stacked in favor of ETH,\u201d Lunde said, referring to it as a \u201cstrong relative buy\u201d versus bitcoin. \u201cETH/BTC trades near 2.5-year range lows, with considerable wiggle room for relative upside.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the industry continues to hope that the SEC will green-light the first spot Bitcoin ETF, which many experts expect will have an enormous impact on BTC price by attracting massive inflows. The SEC delayed the decision on seven BTC ETF applications last week.\n\nRelated Articles"

        "content": "ETH retests support levels. Evaluating the possibilities amid mixed reactions.\n\nETH whales might sway the market as accumulation takes place.\n\nEthereum is facing the barrel of potential capitulation all over again as the bulls struggle to secure momentum. ETH managed to restest a short-term support level again. However, it might lose that support if the bears extend their dominance.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nETH\u2019s sideways price action since the start of September shared similarities with its performance in the second week of August. Capitulation followed that sideways activity, leading to an 11% downside. If a similar outcome occurred, ETH would likely push down to the next support level. This would lead to sub $1,500 price levels.\n\nCan the bears really take over once again? That might seem unlikely considering that it was oversold in August at the same level. However, we have seen past instances wherein prices continue dipping even in oversold conditions.\n\nA look at the latest on-chain performance may offer noteworthy insights. For example, the latest Glassnode data revealed that the number of ETH exchange deposits has been on the rise. It could indicate that ETH is flowing from private addresses onto exchanges. This is usually considered a sign of sell pressure or that investors are preparing to sell.\n\n? #Ethereum $ETH Number of Exchange Deposits (7d MA) just reached a 1-month high of 2,145.685 Previous 1-month high of 2,145.327 was observed on 04 September 2023 View metric:https://t.co/Bar49XOvlB pic.twitter.com/Malli7yTlw \u2014 glassnode alerts (@glassnodealerts) September 5, 2023\n\n\n\nTracing ETH exchange flows revealed that the supply of ETH held by top exchange addresses (denoted in green) remains close to its four-week lows. This coincides with the exchange deposits according to Glassnode.\n\nDespite these findings, the percentage of ETH held by top addresses as a percentage of total supply (denoted in blue) has been growing.\n\nAssessing the level of accumulation at the current level\n\nETH\u2019s next move will depend on which is dominant between the bulls and the whales. We can determine or attempt to predict which way it will sway by observing what whales are currently doing.\n\nAccording to the supply distribution metric, some whales have been buying the dip while others are still contributing to sell pressure.\n\nTwo of ETH\u2019s largest whale categories have been buying. These include addresses holding between 10,000 and 100,000 (denoted in blue) which have been accumulating in the last 2 days. They currently control 21.63 of ETH\u2019s circulating supply.\n\nRead about Ethereum\u2019s price prediction for 2024\n\nThe larger whale category contributing to bullish momentum includes addresses between 10 million and 100 million. Addresses in this category collectively control 23.47% of ETH\u2019s circulating supply.\n\nThis is a potentially good sign for the bulls because continued accumulation might eventually support a rally."

        "title": "Fixing Ethereum node centralization may take two decades: Vitalik Buterin - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "The project\u2019s founder explained how a reduction in node costs could help its goals.\n\nDevelopers\u2019 contributions decreased, and validator activity fell.\n\nEthereum [ETH] co-founder Vitalik Buterin, while admitting that node centralization was one of the blockchain\u2019s biggest challenges, said that it could take 20 years to fix. Buterin, who was speaking at the South Korean Blockchain Week, gave reasons for his opinion.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-2024\n\nEthereum nodes are necessary for the blockchain to function as they are responsible for validating transactions and monitoring the functional status of the blockchain.\n\nNode operation requires a reduction\n\nCurrently, Ethereum has about 6,801 nodes with most of them hosted in the United States and Germany. About 35% of these nodes rely heavily on Amazon Web Services (AWS), which is a centralized entity.\n\nAccording to Buterin, it takes about 100 gigabytes of data to run a node. And for Ethereum nodes to be fully decentralized, the cost of node operation needs to be reduced while Statelessness also needs to be taken seriously.\n\nOn 31 August, the Ethereum Foundation updated its roadmap where it discussed the role of Statelessness, state, and history expiry. In the document, the foundation defined Statelessness as a bit of a misnomer for changing the way Ethereum nodes handle state data.\n\nWhile highlighting how weak Statelessness may come before the strong one, Ethereum mentioned the need for Verkle trees. For the unaccustomed, Verkle trees are small, fixed-sized \u201cwitnesses\u201d that could be used to verify blocks on the blockchain. The document explained:\n\n\u201cWeak statelessness is in an advanced state of research, but it relies upon proposer-builder separation and Verkle Trees to have been implemented so that small witnesses can be passed between peers.\u201d\n\nWith statements like the above, it is expected that a lot of development might occur on the Ethereum blockchain soon. Meanwhile, on-chain analytic platform Santiment revealed that development activity on the blockchain had slowed down.\n\nAssessing the road ahead\n\nDevelopment activity measures the public GitHub repositories connected to a project. An increasing value of the metric indicates a rise in developer contributions or code commits. On the other hand, a decrease in development activity signifies a shrinking dedication to polishing a project\u2019s network.\n\nTherefore, Ethereum\u2019s development activity implied that commitment to polishing the network was not at its peak. When it comes to staking activity following its last major upgrade\u2014 the Shapella upgrade, on-chain data revealed that it has been up and down.\n\nFrom the chart shared above, Ether deposits on the Beacon Chain have reduced. This meant the rate of validator entry into the Ethereum staking system has decreased. Regardless of the staking state, Ethereum seems to be focused on the upcoming Dencun upgrade.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check the Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nWhile Dencun might not be as big as the Merge it aims to reduce transaction fees on the blockchain. The upgrade could also increase transactions throughout.\n\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum\u2019s throughput is currently around 13 Transactions Per Second (TPS). But with the upgrade, the throughput has the potential to have a much higher TPS."

        "title": "Investing In Push Protocol (PUSH) \u2013 Everything You Need to Know - Securities.io",
        "content": "*As of Sept. 2022, Ethereum Push Notification Service (PUSH) has rebranded to Push Protocol (PUSH)*\n\nWeb 3.0, also called Web3, is well on its way. However, it will take some time for it to arrive, as it depends a lot on solving some crucial issues of the blockchain technology, that have been avoiding solutions for years. Fortunately, there is a constant inflow of new talents that are coming to the crypto/blockchain industry from all over the world, and some of these issues seem like they might be solved in the near future.\n\nSome have already been solved, in fact, such as the notification mechanism that was really supposed to be invented a long time ago, but for some reason, it wasn\u2019t. That is, until Ethereum Push Notification Service (PUSH), or EPNS for short, was invented. The project has been around only for about a year now, after launching in April 2021, and it definitely deserves a look over.\n\nWhat Problems Does Ethereum Push Notification Service Solve?\n\nEPNS is focusing on the issues of communication, in a way that can benefit the traders and investors the most. For example, it:\n\nAllows wallet addresses to receive notifications\n\nEPNS is a notification protocol that allows wallet addresses of users to get notifications by any smart contract or dApp that they are involved with. The same goes for various services, all of which can send notifications that will reach users in a platform-agnostic way. That way, users do not need to manually check for new changes and developments \u2013 they can simply be notified of them as they happen.\n\nChanges the way services communicate with users\n\nUntil now, crypto services that users interact with could only send feedback to them through social media, such as Twitter or Reddit. The clear downside of this is that users would not necessarily see the services\u2019 posts and be notified of important events in time, which could lead to missed opportunities, or failure to react to important events \u2013 whether good or bad \u2013 in time.\n\nImproves UX, communication, and engagement\n\nBy being able to communicate with users directly, services can improve the users' overall experience. What\u2019s more, by notifying them of what is going on in real-time, they can increase user engagement, which is beneficial for both, the users and services.\n\nBenefits of Ethereum Push Notification Service\n\nThere are several benefits that users can expect from interacting with EPNS, some of which may be quite obvious, while others are completely unique. For example:\n\nReceive important updates\n\nAs a user, you would be able to receive important updates directly to your wallet address, which would immediately warn you of anything that is happening with the project, its coin or token, new developments and impactful events, and more. The problem is that until EPNS, something like that did not exist, and because of this, users were missing a lot of important events. Even if they were published on Twitter or Reddit or some other social network, the projects can only do so much to get the information across, and users would have to check regularly what is going on, which is neither efficient nor practical.\n\nEarn crypto for receiving notifications\n\nOne thing that may not have been so obvious from everything mentioned so far is that EPNS also contains an important DeFi aspect to the project. This DeFi portion of the deal allows users to earn cryptocurrencies simply for receiving the actual notifications. The so-called incentivized alerts rely on staking by service, which is lent out to AAVE to generate interest, which is then distributed among the service\u2019s subscribers, as the project itself explains it.\n\nDecide what services can send notifications\n\nFinally, the project is very user-centric, meaning that users can change, select, and decide most things regarding the alerts. You can always opt in or out from receiving the alerts, or choose specific services that you wish to receive alerts from, or even opt in for a type of service that will reward you first, and then send the notification that they were planning to send to their users. Essentially, all of it is your decision.\n\nHow Does Ethereum Push Notification Service Work?\n\nEthereum Push Notification Service is a notification protocol that aims to revolutionize the way the crypto world communicates with its participants. So far, there was simply no solution that would directly notify users that work with some service or project, or are affected by it in some way. Projects and companies were limited in their communication by posting updates on social networks, and hoping that the algorithms that are presenting content to users would let them see the announcement as soon as possible.\n\nAlternatively, it was the users\u2019 responsibility to check in with these projects, the markets, and alike, on regular basis and remain up to date with all new developments. This did not provide a particularly great user experience, and it led to users missing out on important events and activities at best, or resulted in losses when they failed to react in time to negative developments.\n\nEPNS introduces an advanced new notification system that is blockchain-agnostic, tied directly to the users\u2019 wallet addresses, and provides direct communication between services and users. It is a type of project that is considered a necessary part of the upcoming Web3.\n\nHow to Buy Ethereum Push Notification Service (PUSH)\n\nCurrently, Ethereum Push Notification Service (PUSH) is available for purchase on the following exchanges.\n\nKuCoin \u2013 This exchange currently offers cryptocurrency trading of over 300 other popular tokens. It is often the first to offer buying opportunities for new tokens. USA Residents are Prohibited.\n\nWazirX \u2013 This exchange is part of the Binance Group, which ensures a high standard of quality. It is the best exchange for residents of India.\n\nEthereum Push Notification Service (PUSH) \u2014 A project for chain-agnostic, platform-independent, incentivized notifications\n\nThe crypto/blockchain industry continues to evolve, and with each new idea such as what EPNS has come up with, it is getting closer to making Web3 a reality. There is still a long road ahead, of course, but even before Web3 becomes reality, a push notification system that can notify users of important development will be extremely useful. Especially if said system can be used by any dApp and smart contract on any blockchain.\n\nAs a result, we believe that EPNS has great potential in the blockchain world of the present, as well as future, and are interested to see its development."

        "title": "Financial privacy and regulation can co-exist with ZK proofs \u2014 Vitalik Buterin - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has published a research paper diving into privacy pool systems as a tool to achieve more privacy in financial transactions, allowing users to prove dissociation from illicit funds through zero-knowledge-proof technology.\n\nThe document initially discusses one of the most popular privacy-enhancing protocols, Tornado Cash, which allows users to deposit and withdraw cryptocurrencies without creating an identifiable link between the two addresses. Recently, United States authorities filed criminal charges against its founders, alleging extensive use by bad actors.\n\n\"The critical issue with Tornado Cash was essentially that legitimate users had limited options to dissociate from the criminal activity the protocol attracted,\" reads the paper, co-authored by Jacob Illum, Matthias Nadler, Fabian Schar and Ameen Soleimani.\n\nThe analysis then elaborates on an extension of Tornado Cash\u2019s approach that would enable users to publicly prove the source of funds on-chain by allowing membership proofs (\u201cI prove that my withdrawal comes from one of these deposits\u201d) and exclusion proofs (\u201cI prove that my withdrawal does not come from one of these deposits\").\n\nAccording to the authors, the concept could provide a balance between honest and dishonest protocol users, potentially enabling financial compliance on-chain in the future:\n\n\u201cThe core idea of the proposal is to allow users to publish a zero-knowledge proof, demonstrating that their funds (do not) originate from known (un-)lawful sources, without publicly revealing their entire transaction graph. This is achieved by proving membership in custom association sets that satisfy certain properties, required by regulation or social consensus.\"\n\nWith privacy pools, users can exclude themselves from anonymity sets that include addresses related to illegal activities based on zero-knowledge proofs \u2014 a method of proving a statement without disclosing the statement\u2019s details.\n\nThe underlying idea presented in the document asserts that instead of simply using zero knowledge to prove that a \u201cwithdrawal is linked to some previously-made deposit, a user proves membership in a more restrictive association set.\"\n\nThe association set can include all previously made deposits, only the user\u2019s own deposits, or anything in between. As a public input, the user specifies the set by providing its Merkle root. \u201cFor simplicity, we do not directly prove that the association set actually is a subset of the previously-made deposits; instead, we just require the user to zero-knowledge-prove two Merkle branches.\"\n\nTo illustrate it in a law enforcement context, the authors provide a simple example:\n\n\u201cSuppose that we have five users: Alice, Bob, Carl, David and Eve. The first four are honest, law-abiding users who nevertheless want to preserve their privacy, but Eve is a thief. Suppose also that this is publicly known.\"\n\nIn the example, when one of the users wants to withdraw funds, the individual can specify which association set to be a part of, meaning users are incentivized to make their association sets larger to safeguard privacy. However, to avoid their funds from being perceived as suspicious by merchants or exchanges, the users do not include Eve in their association set. Eve, however, cannot exclude her own deposit and will be forced to make an association set equal to the set of all five deposits.\n\nVisual representation of participants\u2019 association set selection. Source: Buterin et al., 2023\n\n\u201c[W]e assume that Alice, Bob, Carl and David include all other 'good\u2019 deposits in their respective association sets and exclude deposit 5, that originates from a known illicit source. Eve, on the other hand, cannot create a proof that disassociates her withdrawal from her own deposit.\"\n\nAccording to the authors, the example illustrates one possibility for the use of association sets in privacy pool protocols. \"Note, that the system does not rely on altruism on Alice, Bob, Carl and David\u2019s part; they have a clear incentive to prove their disassociation.\"\n\nThe paper further offers several other use cases of zero-knowledge proofs for users to demonstrate that funds are not tied to illicit sources or to prove that funds originate from a specific set of deposits without revealing any further information.\n\n\u201cIn many cases, privacy and regulatory compliance are perceived as incompatible. This paper suggests that this does not necessarily have to be the case, if the privacy-enhancing protocol enables its users to prove certain properties regarding the origin of their funds.\"\n\nProtocols working on zero-knowledge solutions are on the rise, with the Ethereum network dominating major launches, according to recent research. The findings point out that scaling ZK-proof solutions are set to experience the highest growth in the coming 12 months as global regulations evolve and users seek to protect their privacy.\n\nMagazine: Recursive inscriptions \u2014 Bitcoin \u2018supercomputer\u2019 and BTC DeFi coming soon"

        "content": "After rising above the $1,600 mark in March, following the bail attempts of the Silicon Valley Bank by the Federal Reserve, Ethereum price has remained above this level since then. The second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is trading 24% below the 2023 high at $2,140 with multiple metrics suggesting that it could drop below $1,600.\n\nThis is validated by the current bearish sentiment in the market and declining metrics related to the Ethereum network. Data from Alternative, a company that analyzes \u201cemotions and sentiments\u201d around cryptocurrencies, shows that the Crypto Fear and Greed index is in the \u201cFear\u201d zone.\n\nThis means that investors are worried about their investments and they may continue selling to minimize losses.\n\nOn-chain Metrics Show Declining Demand for ETH\n\nIn addition to the drab price action and bearish market conditions, on-chain metrics point to decreasing demand. Notably, the value locked on Ethereum has decreased from a 2023 high of $31.5 billion in April to the current value of $21.46 billion, according to data from DeFiLlama.\n\nTotal Value Locked On Ethereum\n\nSimilarly, the number of Ethereum addresses holding a minimum of $1,000 in ETH has hit its lowest point in six months.\n\nNo. of Addresses with a Min. of $1,000 in ETH\n\nThis is worrying considering that the altcoin\u2019s price reached a peak of $2,140 in April, which was expected to have attracted more users to the network. Similarly, the amount of revenue generated on the platform has dropped by over 84% from $14.43 million in mid-April to $2.27 million on Sept.5. This points to a lack of interest among investors and developers.\n\nPart of the lack of investor interest can be attributed to the fact that the transaction fees on the Layer 1 blockchain remain notably high. Note that Ethereum\u2019s average transaction fee has remained above $4 for the past six months. This keeps investors and developers away, hence decreasing revenues.\n\nOn the upside, whales appear to be taking advantage of the low prices to accumulate more. According to Ali Martinez, a popular crypto analyst on Twitter, Ethereum Whales added 260,000 ETH with a staggering $425 million within 24 hours.\n\n#Ethereum whales appear to have purchased around 260,000 $ETH within the last 24 hours, worth nearly $425 million. pic.twitter.com/rPRMhnI6oD \u2014 Ali (@ali_charts) September 5, 2023\n\nThis comes on the heels of a strong ETH whale movement in the past few days. Two whale addresses moved a total of 300,000 ETH on Coinbase earlier on Monday.\n\nWill Whale Activity Affect Ethereum\u2019s Price Action?\n\nWhile the motivations behind these transfers remain unknown, it\u2019s worth noting that they may have a significant impact on Ether\u2019s price.\n\nAt press time, ETH was trading at $1,629 with bears determined to pull it below the $1,600 support lines. If they are successful, they may pull the smart contracts token lower toward the $1,545 swing low or the $1,500 psychological level. Such a move would represent a 5% drop from the current price.\n\nETH/USD Daily Chart\n\nThis negative outlook was supported by the down-facing moving averages. These trend-following chart overlay indicators also presented areas of stiff resistance on the upside at $1,657, $$1,772, and $1,812 where the 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs) sat respectively.\n\nAlso validating the grim outlook for Ethereum was the Stochastic RSI which was facing downwards. Its position at 43 in the negative region suggested that the bears were more than buyers in the market.\n\nOn the upside, if the ETH were to stage a sustained recovery, it has to turn up from the current level rising above the areas defined by the SMAs toward the $1,900 psychological level. A bullish breakout would be confirmed if the token produces a daily candlestick close above the $2,000 psychological level and later the April swing high of $2,140. Such a move would then set the token on a sustained price recovery.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "Decentralized exchange (DEX) platform dYdX plans to offer a \u201cpurely decentralized\u201d order book exchange as it migrates its ecosystem from the Ethereum network to the interchain network Cosmos.\n\nAt the Korea Blockchain Week 2023, Cointelegraph\u2019s Andrew Fenton spoke with dYdX Foundation CEO Charles d\u2019Haussy about the DEX\u2019s plans to implement decentralized order books on the exchange and how it plans to shift its ecosystem to a new blockchain network.\n\nAttendees at the Korea Blockchain Week 2023, held in Seoul, South Korea. Source: Cointelegraph\n\nIn the interview, d\u2019Haussy told Cointelegraph that one of the issues faced by DEXs is the slow performance of on-chain order books. Because of this issue, order books for DEXs had to be taken off-chain to cater to the needs of the users. He explained:\n\n\u201cIf you have like a one-second block time, you still have a one-second latency. And the market of crypto derivatives is a very high-frequency market. So, you cannot offer one-second latency.\u201d\n\nD\u2019Haussy highlighted that dYdX is taking a \u201cnew step forward\u201d in decentralization by making the order book decentralized. According to the executive, the order book will not be on the dYdX chain because it will still be slow, but it will instead be hosted within the validators.\n\n\u201cSo, the architecture choice by dYdX engineers is to decentralize the order book, without adding it on-chain because it will be too slow. The decision was made to essentially host the order book within the memory of the validators,\u201d d\u2019Haussy added.\n\nD\u2019Haussy believes this method is a \u201cnew thing within the space.\u201d The executive explained that validators usually validate blocks and create new blocks with a set of transactions. He also said the validators will still do this on the dYdX chain but will also store order books in their memory. \u201cAnd that\u2019s one solution, which we\u2019ll use to essentially offer to the market a purely decentralized order book exchange,\u201d he explained.\n\nRelated: 40% of crypto trading platforms are decentralized: World Federation of Exchanges\n\nApart from the decentralized order book, d\u2019Haussy spoke about dYdX\u2019s move to Cosmos. \u201cDYdX is not expanding, dYdX is migrating. So, the Ethereum exchange will close within a few months [...] we are migrating the full ecosystem,\u201d he explained.\n\n\ufe0f v4 Adoption & DYDX Token Migration\n\n\n\nThe dYdX community has voted in support of v4 Adoption and a potential DYDX Token Migration\u2757\n\n\n\n\u2705 ~36M DYDX from 392 addresses\n\n\u274c ~43 DYDX from 4 addresseshttps://t.co/FBLMZATURn pic.twitter.com/RwyOaDwpe4 \u2014 dYdX Foundation (@dydxfoundation) September 3, 2023\n\nAccording to d\u2019Haussy, users will barely notice the change, which will be very smooth. Users will only need to connect their MetaMask wallets to the new dYdX chain, adding that dydx will \u201ctake care of all the heavy lifting.\u201d\n\nCollect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space.\n\nMagazine: Web3 Gamer: Crypto games need viral moment, Nitro Nation review, Axie\u2019s project Greenlight"

        "title": "Vitalik Buterin sells his cryptos: ETH goes backwards! - Cointribune EN",
        "content": "Tue 05 Sep 2023 \u25aa 3 min of reading \u25aa by Mikaia A.\n\nVitalik Buterin, whose crypto portfolio is worth around 244,000 ETH, has recently disposed of several thousand tokens. No explanation for this voluminous transfer of cryptocurrencies from the Ethereum co-founder. Would he need them to develop other projects? Or simply to cover personal expenses? No one knows what he\u2019s up to. Crypto-enthusiasts are panicking. Let\u2019s find out!\n\nIn brief:\n\nVitalik Buterin has just transferred 31,000 ETH to Bitstamp and other addresses\n\n10 days ago, he already sent 300 ETH to Coinbase\n\nThe prince of cryptos dropped to $1,637.94 on the occasion, or -0.09%\n\n31,000 ETH out of Vitalik Buterin\u2019s crypto wallet\n\nTen days ago, Vitalik Buterin\u2019s crypto wallet saw a voluminous transfer of ethers. Specifically, on August 21, the Ethereum co-founder sent 600 ETH to Coinbase. He offered no explanation for this initiative. As a consolation, the crypto community engaged in speculation as to the reasons for this transfer.\n\n#PeckShieldAlert Vitalik-related address (0xD04d\u20268fd7) recently transferred ~999 $ETH (equivalent to ~$1.64M) to address 0x5567\u202631B1 ~20 days ago, this address 0x5567 previously received ~1,701 $ETH from Vitalik-related address (0xD04d\u20268fd7) and subsequently moved these funds\u2026 pic.twitter.com/n7jrKotsXq \u2014 PeckShieldAlert (@PeckShieldAlert) September 4, 2023 Details of Vitalik Buterin\u2019s latest ETH transactions\n\nEarlier this morning, PeckShieldAlert revealed another ETH transaction by Vitalik Buterin. The amount designated by Coin Edition leaves crypto analysts baffled: 31,000 ETH.\n\nMultiplying this amount by the current ether price, $1,633.87 on CoinGecko, gives us $50.623 million.\n\nAs usual, cryptocurrency investors have shown their concern over this dubious transfer.\n\nWhat are the reasons for these ETH crypto transfers?\n\nAccording to U\u00b0Today, these spaced-out exercises don\u2019t actually represent anything serious. The most plausible theory is \u201cportfolio diversification\u201d. In other words, Vitalik Buterin is cleaning up his own financial ecosystem.\n\nAnd if this isn\u2019t the case, we can\u2019t rule out the theory that he\u2019s developing a new project or cashing in his crypto holdings.\n\nWhat if he\u2019s trying to establish new strategic partnerships? Or preparing for future rounds of financing?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like he\u2019s planting seeds, but we don\u2019t yet know what kind of forest he wants to grow,\u201d reads the columns of this crypto media outlet.\n\nLastly, analysts have suggested that Vitalik Buterin is being forced to transfer ETH en masse in order to create positive ripples in the cryptocurrency market. In other words, the decline in bitcoin, as well as ether, won\u2019t last as long as druids like Buterin are around.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program!

        "title": "Investing In Aurora (AURORA) - Everything You Need to Know - Securities.io",
        "content": "Aurora is an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) ecosystem created by the NEAR protocol development team. Notably, NEAR is among the highest-performing third-generation L1 protocols available to Ethereum developers today. It provides the infrastructure which enables Aurora to improve the Dapp developer experience considerably, via turn-key solutions. Notably, the network combines a straightforward interface with dual consensus mechanisms to provide support for all the latest DeFi features and services.\n\nAurora is a popular project with more than $78M in TVL (total value locked) across +232 active projects currently. The network continues to attract more users due to its low transaction cost and full Ethereum compatibility. Additionally, the platform is one of the few programmable networks that enable users to leverage ETH to pay network fees. Here's everything you need to know about Aurora.\n\nWhat Problems Does Aurora Attempt to Fix?\n\nAurora seeks to provide another layer of performance to the Ethereum ecosystem The developers wanted to create a faster and more scalable alternative for users. They accomplished this task with the introduction of their next-generation DeFi protocols. Notably, the platform is much faster than Ethereum with 2-3 second transaction finalization times.\n\nCentralization\n\nAnother major concern for developers was to prevent centralization. When Aurora launched, Ethereum V1 was still in use. This version of Ethereum was experiencing many issues due to centralization in the ecosystem. The Aurora ecosystem provides a more democratic and transparent alternative for developers to consider. The network supports community governance as part of this strategy.\n\nSecurity Concerns\n\nAnother issue that the team wanted to reduce is security risks. To accomplish this goal, the platform leverages a two-tiered consensus mechanism that improves performance and security. The network integrates a Byzantine Fault Tolerant system with a Delegated Proof of stake option to enable better transaction throughput and faster finality.\n\nBenefits of Aurora\n\nThere are a lot of benefits that have helped Aurora become a popular project in the Ethereum ecosystem. For one, the platform features a straightforward approach that can help programmers build and release software with fewer steps. The entire project is geared towards elevating the Ethereum development experience.\n\nThe system is regarded as one of the top-performing programmable blockchains available today and it was built from day one to support complex smart contracts and Dapps. Developers gain the bonus of knowing that all of the most popular Ethereum tools work perfectly when programming on the network.\n\nEnergy Efficient\n\nThe platform leverages dual consensus mechanisms which help reduce its energy consumption compared to PoW networks like ETH 1.0. As such, the system eliminates miners from the consensus equation which eliminates many of the reasons why a blockchain network would need so much energy to remain valid. The new system leverages stakers which is far more efficient than miners. Users can lock up their tokens in network wallets rather than compete using high-powered miners.\n\nReduced Transaction Fees\n\nExecuting smart contracts on Ethereum 1.0 could get expensive. The network was plagued with congestion-related issues that could result in delays and higher fees. Aurora provides a smart and more cost-effective alternative to the market. The network introduces gasless meta-transactions as part of this strategy.\n\nPassive Income Options\n\nAnyone can secure returns when they participate in the network. The system enables you to stake your coins to help secure the network without any technical know-how. For your participation, you receive rewards in the form of AURORA tokens. This approach enables you to continually increase your staked assets to secure higher ROIs in the future.\n\nFees Paid in ETH\n\nAll transaction fees on the network are paid in ETH. This structure is ideal because it provides a reliable and well-recognized base asset. It also ensures that the networks tokens don\u2019t become over-saturated in the market. Lastly, using ETH as the base asset in the network helps developers streamline their creative process by eliminating the need to convert tokens over to other utility tokens to operate Dapps and execute smart contracts.\n\nHow Does Aurora Work?\n\nThe Aurora blockchain ecosystem lives on the NEAR protocol. This high-performance network enables users to enjoy a host of benefits that regular Ethereum developers could not. The network introduces a new programmable blockchain and a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency as part of this approach.\n\nAurora Engine\n\nAt the core of the network is the SputnikVM. This Ethereum virtual machine (EVM) was built on the NEAR protocol to provide better performance across the board. SputnikVM is capable of executing all Ethereum-compatible applications. Additionally, it offers lower fees and more scalability. From here, the network can be broken into a few components including the Aurora Bridge and governance token.\n\nThe Aurora Bridge\n\nThe Aurora Bridge plays a vital role in the ecosystem. The protocol enables anyone to transfer ETH and ERC20 tokens between Ethereum and the platform. Notably, the protocol operates in a fully trustless manner that enables developers to leverage multiple assets across different networks in their creations. Additionally, bridge transfers are free.\n\nToken\n\nAURORA is the primary utility token of the network. Developers need to hold the token to participate in the network DeFi features such as staking. Additionally, the asset plays a vital role in the network's community governance system. You can stake the token to gain voting rights. Notably, the asset is a limited token with a maximum supply of 1,000,000,000 slated for issuance over the life of the project.\n\nConsensus\n\nAurora leverages two consensus mechanisms to help improve performance. One mechanism is designed to approve transactions and validate the state of the network. The other handles smart contract executions. This multi-layered approach improves security and responsiveness.\n\nGovernance\n\nUsers can have a say in the network's future developments using the community governance system called the AuroraDAO the goal of this strategy is to keep the community decentralized well into the future. Users can stake AURORA to gain access to submitting proposals and network changes.\n\nHistory\n\nThe Aurora coin was released in November 2021. At that time, Ethereum was suffering from serious congestion. Aurora successfully provided a reliable alternative that didn\u2019t require a lot of alterations on the part of developers to use. As such, Aurora has managed to become one of the most popular EVM-boosting networks in the market today.\n\nHow to Buy Aurora (AURORA)\n\nCurrently, Aurora (AURORA) is available for purchase on the following exchanges.\n\nUphold \u2013 This is one of the top exchanges for United States & UK residents that offers a wide range of cryptocurrencies. Germany & Netherlands are prohibited.\n\nUphold Disclaimer: Terms Apply. Cryptoassets are highly volatile. Your capital is at risk. Don\u2019t invest unless you\u2019re prepared to lose all the money you invest. This is a high-risk investment, and you should not expect to be protected if something goes wrong..\n\nKuCoin \u2013 This exchange currently offers cryptocurrency trading of over 300 other popular tokens. It is often the first to offer buying opportunities for new tokens. USA Residents are Prohibited.\n\nAurora \u2013 Streamlining ETH Development\n\nAurora is a great example of how developers sought to provide relief to ETH users. Even though Ethereum 2.0 has launched and provides improved performance, there is still a home for a network like Aurora that helps to keep the entire sector running smoothly. As such, you should keep an eye on AURORA in the coming months as the team has some exciting updates planned for the year."

        "title": "Bitcoin Spark: The New Crypto Mining King Outshining Bitcoin and Ethereum - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "Bitcoin Spark (BTCS) has caught the attention of the crypto community, recently being compared to Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC). Mining fanatics suggest that this new Bitcoin fork outshines these established players.\n\nHow to mine Bitcoin\n\nMining Bitcoin is a complex process that involves solving cryptographic puzzles to validate and record transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain through a Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism. To mine Bitcoin, you\u2019ll need specialized hardware known as ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit) since general-purpose computers are no longer efficient for this task. Set up your mining rig and connect it to a reliable power source and the internet. Once your rig is connected, it will start running through various combinations of numbers to solve complex mathematical problems. When your mining rig successfully solves a puzzle, you are rewarded with the transaction fees for that block and a certain number of BTC. It\u2019s important to note that Bitcoin mining has become highly competitive, requiring significant investment in equipment and energy.\n\nHow to mine Ethereum\n\nEthereum moved from a Proof-of-Work system and now relies on the Proof-of-Stake (PoS). In this new system, individuals can no longer mine Ethereum in the conventional sense. Instead, Ethereum holders can become validators by locking up a certain amount of ETH (at least 32 ETH) as collateral and participating in the network\u2019s consensus process. Validators are chosen to create new blocks and validate transactions based on the amount of ETH they hold and are willing to \u201cstake\u201d as collateral. Validators receive rewards in the form of interest on their staked coins. The shift to PoS aimed at reducing energy consumption, increasing scalability, and making Ethereum more environmentally friendly.\n\nHow to mine Bitcoin Spark\n\nBitcoin Spark uses a new consensus mechanism, the Proof-of-Process (PoP), which combines aspects of Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake. The PoP rewards miners for confirming blocks and contributing to the processing power of their devices. The network has a massive number of nodes to ensure it can accommodate many miners. Additionally, the PoP is combined with an algorithm that exponentially reduces the rewards per additional power, ensuring a fairer distribution of rewards. Moreover, the Bitcoin Spark network is incredibly lightweight, allowing for lower-power devices to run the network. BTCS mining will be through the Bitcoin Spark application, which will become open source for third-party application development after the network\u2019s launch.\n\nTo mine BTCS, you will need to install the Bitcoin Spark application and grant it access to your device\u2019s processing unit. The app will be compatible with Windows, Mac OS, Linux, iOS, and Android. Once installed and granted access, the application will create a virtual environment isolated from the device\u2019s operating system functions to ensure security. It will also regularly adjust itself to resources it can use on the device, accounting for overheating, battery life, and simultaneous device usage needs. Nonetheless, you can manually set the amount of device resources permitted for mining use. With the simplicity of the application, you will be able to get started incredibly easily. Bitcoin Spark\u2019s method greatly reduces the work and power consumption required for mining, essentially opening it up to anyone with a smart device.\n\nThe miners\u2019 collective power will be safely \u2018rented out\u2019 to Bitcoin Spark\u2019s clients undertaking high CPU/GPU tasks, such as 3D rendering, machine learning, and running servers. Those using the network for remote computing will pay with BTCS, which will be sent to the mining pool. This means miners within the Bitcoin Spark network will be rewarded with transaction fees, new BTCS coins, and revenue from leasing their processing power. Thus, BTCS miners should be able to turn a profit regardless of energy or asset prices, which is one of the many issues facing crypto miners today.\n\nBitcoin Spark is offering investors a chance to get BTCS early and at discounted prices through its Initial Coin Offering (ICO). Analysts who\u2019ve reviewed the project suggest it is a sound project with great potential for growth and adoption, which can prove extremely rewarding for early investors.\n\nConclusion\n\nBitcoin Spark provides a true path to decentralization, where mining is accessible to all. The network also instills a greater desire for network validation by providing multiple ways for miners to earn. As crypto miners continue to search for more sustainable and efficient alternatives, Bitcoin Spark\u2019s vision could see rank at the top.\n\nFor more on Bitcoin Spark and its ICO:\n\nWebsite: https://bitcoinspark.org/\n\nBuy BTCS: https://network.bitcoinspark.org/register\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "Sometimes the investment world receives a jolt that reminds everyone just how rapidly the financial landscape is evolving. Enter the scene: Ark Invest. Teaming up with 21Shares, the duo boldly declared their intent to debut the first-ever U.S.-based Ethereum ETF that would provide direct exposure to Ether \u2013 the crypto world\u2019s silver. The move? Undeniably audacious. The impact? Potentially colossal.\n\nA Direct Investment Strategy: Because Why Not?\n\nRecent rumblings in the finance sphere have whispered of Ether futures spot-ETFs. But Ark Invest, never one to tiptoe around the edges, took it up a notch. Their strategy to directly hold Ether isn\u2019t just gutsy\u2014it\u2019s unprecedented. And let\u2019s be clear; this is no mere attempt to offer yet another crypto product. This is about reshaping the narrative, and more crucially, raising the stakes. It\u2019s a game-changer, with a twist.\n\nThe Ark 21Shares Ethereum ETF, for the uninitiated, isn\u2019t just an ordinary exchange-traded fund. Its primary intent, bold as ever, is to track the performance of Ether. And how will it do this? By focusing on the CME CF Ether-Dollar Reference Rate \u2013 a New York Variant. In layman terms, it\u2019s all about reflecting Ether\u2019s performance, valued in the good ol\u2019 U.S. dollar.\n\nAnd who\u2019s at the heart of this operation? A diverse ensemble. Ark Investment Management LLC, designated as the Sub-Adviser, isn\u2019t just sitting on the sidelines. They\u2019re in the thick of it, aiding and guiding the marketing of the Shares.\n\nAs for holding the Trust\u2019s Ether, that responsibility rests with the trusty hands of Coinbase Custody Trust Company, LLC. And let\u2019s not even get started on the litany of other roles and intricacies, like the Authorized Participants, ensuring everything runs as smooth as butter.\n\nUnpacking the Trust\u2019s Core Objectives\n\nDiving deeper into this financial behemoth, the ARK 21Shares Ethereum ETF has set itself some monumental tasks. Firstly, there\u2019s the objective to mirror Ether\u2019s performance as determined by the CME CF Ether-Dollar Reference Rate. Sounds straightforward? It\u2019s anything but.\n\nThe Index itself is a product of rigorous calculations by CF Benchmarks Ltd., basing its results on a comprehensive aggregation of the trade flows from major ether spot exchanges.\n\nThe Trust\u2019s core appeal to investors, however, lies elsewhere. Imagine being able to delve into the ether market without the pesky hurdles of direct Ether trading or dealing with spot market nuances. That\u2019s the promise this ETF brings. And with Coinbase Custody as its custodian, it offers a semblance of security. Although, remember, it\u2019s not FDIC-insured, but hey, they\u2019ve got private insurance. Small consolations?\n\nAs for its modus operandi, the Trust is pretty clear-cut. Barring some cataclysmic event, they aren\u2019t in the business of buying or selling Ether. Instead, their focus rests on \u201cin-kind\u201d transactions. Think of it as a barter system, where Authorized Participants bring Ether to the table, and in exchange, they\u2019re handed Shares by the Trust. And vice versa. It\u2019s a straightforward yet intricate dance of finance.\n\nSo, what\u2019s the takeaway? Ark Invest and 21Shares aren\u2019t just stepping into the future; they\u2019re dragging the rest of us with them. Their Ethereum ETF is audacious, ambitious, and just the kind of shake-up the investment world didn\u2019t know it needed. But let\u2019s not roll out the red carpet just yet. Like every pioneer, they\u2019ve got challenges ahead. Only time will tell if this bet pays off, but one thing\u2019s for sure\u2014it\u2019s going to be one hell of a ride.\n\n**You can read the SEC filing here."
