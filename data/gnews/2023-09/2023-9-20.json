        "content": "A \u201croutine\u201d Binance account consolidation process sent gas fees on Ethereum soaring, prompting accusations of incompetence on Thursday.\n\nAt approximately 6 am ET, an address labeled Binance 14 received hundreds of incoming ether transactions. Per Etherscan, the process sent gas prices as high as 280 gwei \u2014 over twenty times more expensive than the 13 gwei at the time of writing.\n\nThe activity briefly made the address one of the largest gas guzzlers on Ethereum, as the wallet was responsible for 83% of fees at the peak of the transfers. Top spenders tend to include the decentralized exchange Uniswap, various MEV bots, and layer-2 networks settling transactions to the base chain.\n\nThe Binance 14 address has spent $842,000 in total gas fees on a 24-hour basis, and just $562 in the last three hours. Over the course of its existence, the address \u2014 which currently accounts for $250 million of Binance\u2019s nearly $56 billion in holdings \u2014 is responsible for $95 million in gas expenditure between both incoming and outgoing transfers.\n\nIn a statement to Blockworks, a Binance spokesperson said, \u201cBinance carried out a routine consolidation of [ether] ETH to one of its wallets. Any impact to gas prices was unintentional but quickly resolved.\u201d\n\nIndeed, throughout its existence the Binance 14 address has seen a number of gas spend spikes, including one on Dec. 9, 2022 that led to an 880 ETH spend over a 24-hour period.\n\nBinance was the target of ire on social media as a result of the account consolidation process, with many observers noting that if they had simply spread the transactions out over a longer period of time, the gas spike would have been significantly subdued.\n\nAs a result of what some labeled as inefficient methodology, Binance ended up spending more on gas than they would have otherwise and made the network more expensive for others.\n\n\u201cEvery interaction I have had with them screams of incompetence,\u201d said Rotki app founder Lefteris Karapetsas of the transfers.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "If This 1 Metric Is Right, Ethereum Could Be Massively Undervalued - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Ethereum (ETH -0.58%) is up a resounding 37% so far this year. That might sound impressive, but keep in mind that Ethereum is still trading at nearly the same level it was 12 months ago when it completed The Merge. Shouldn't Ethereum's price have soared after this much-hyped technological breakthrough?\n\nClearly, crypto investors aren't impressed by technical upgrades and are waiting for the next big catalyst to appear for Ethereum. But that next big catalyst might be right under their noses, and they aren't even aware of it yet. As a result, Ethereum could be massively undervalued at its current price of $1,645.\n\nLayer 2 blockchain activity\n\nThe one metric to keep an eye on is the amount of activity happening on Layer 2 blockchain networks. These Layer 2 blockchains are built directly on top of the main Ethereum network, and help make Ethereum run faster, more efficiently, and more affordably. As such, they are very much part of the broader Ethereum ecosystem, and should be taken into account when thinking about Ethereum's growth prospects.\n\nEven after The Merge, Ethereum needs these Layer 2 blockchains, and founder Vitalik Buterin has always been clear that he supports the development of these Layer 2 networks. They are not cannibalizing the future growth of Ethereum. Instead, they are actively contributing to a much faster rate of growth for Ethereum.\n\nTo give you an idea of just how important these Layer 2 blockchain networks are, there are now five that rank among the top 55 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Granted, many of them are hardly household names. With the exception of Polygon, which garnered a fair amount of attention around the time of The Merge, they are quietly working behind the scenes, helping to scale Ethereum.\n\nImpact on growth\n\nThese Layer 2 blockchains are directly contributing to Ethereum's market dominance in key areas. For example, take non-fungible tokens (NFTs). If you examine the 30-day sales volume for NFTs, Ethereum is still the clear leader, with just under $200 million in sales. The next biggest Layer 1 blockchain network is Solana, with just under $30 million in sales. So, as a quick approximation, it's possible to say that Ethereum is doing nearly 7 times the sales volume of its next closest competitor.\n\nHowever, two of the top blockchains for NFT sales volume are Immutable X and Polygon, and both of these are Layer 2 blockchains for Ethereum. When you add in the 30-day NFT sales volume for both of these (approximately $50 million total), then it's possible to say that Ethereum is doing 8 times or even 9 times the sales volume of its next closest competitor.\n\nAnd the same story is true in the decentralized finance (DeFi) market. Again, Ethereum is the clear market leader here, accounting for nearly 55% of Total Value Locked (TVL). This metric describes how much value is \"locked up\" in various DeFi protocols, and is the single best indicator for overall DeFi strength. But four Layer 2 blockchains also rank in the Top 10 for TVL, and these account for another 10% of TVL on an aggregate basis. Taking this into account, Ethereum is responsible for a staggering two-thirds of all TVL in the blockchain world.\n\nValuation models\n\nAs demonstrated above, taking into account Layer 2 blockchain activity shows just how much Ethereum is potentially undervalued. A new report from crypto research firm RxR came to a similar conclusion. Using a valuation model based on Metcalfe's Law, which states that the value of any network is directly proportional to the square of the number of users, the research firm suggested that Ethereum might be undervalued by as much as 27%. In short, investors are overlooking the massive user growth on Layer 2 blockchain networks, and that is causing them to undervalue Ethereum.\n\nGranted, there are bound to be some skeptics who think that Metcalfe's Law shouldn't be applied to cryptocurrencies. After all, it's inconclusive whether adding a new user to an existing blockchain network should lead to a huge increase in value. It's different in the case of, say, telecom networks, because it's immediately clear how each new user (i.e., the person paying the phone bill each month) can be monetized.\n\nMoreover, Metcalfe's Law can lead to some pretty dizzying price estimates for cryptocurrencies. During the last crypto bull market rally, models based on Metcalfe's Law were projecting a $20,000 price target for Ethereum. The all-time high for Ethereum is just under $5,000, so that price target was wildly off the mark.\n\nSo is Ethereum undervalued or not?\n\nStill, it's easy to see how Ethereum could be significantly undervalued. Ethereum's metrics seem to be flatlining or declining. But dig deeper, and you'll see Layer 2 activity is taking off. The big question you have to ask yourself as an investor is whether this Layer 2 activity should be additive to the overall value of Ethereum.\n\nIt might be a controversial take, but I'm firmly in the camp of investors and analysts who think that Ethereum is trading at a huge discount right now. There's just too much activity happening on Layer 2 blockchain networks to ignore."

        "title": "Who Earns Ethereum Gas Fees: An In-Depth Guide - Blockgeeks",
        "content": "Who earns Gas fees on the Ethereum blockchain? \u2013 sounds like some kind of intergalactic fuel for cryptocurrency transactions, right?\n\n\u2026With Ethereum\u2019s transaction speed and transaction verification, these gas fees are charges incurred for processing transactions on the network. Well, it\u2019s not exactly rocket science, but it does power the Ethereum spaceship with cryptocurrency and the bitcoin blockchain! The Ethereum blockchain network operates on gas units. So, hold on tight as we take a hilarious journey through the world of charging Ethereum gas fees in cryptocurrency wallets. The hashrate is an important factor to consider.\n\nNow, you might be wondering what these gas fees, charge for ethereum transactions, are all about. It\u2019s important to understand that these fees are necessary to incentivize ethereum miners and maintain the hashrate of the network. Picture this: whenever you make a transaction involving cryptocurrency on the Ethereum network, whether it\u2019s sending ETH or interacting with decentralized applications (dApps), you gotta pay up a charge. These cryptocurrency fees are like tolls for investors using the Ethereum highway, charging them to keep things running smoothly and allowing for tips.\n\nUnderstanding gas fees is a crucial tip for investors who want to navigate the Ethereum universe without breaking the bank. Gas fees are influenced by factors such as block size and can significantly impact an investor\u2019s control over their finances. The complexity of ethereum transactions, smart contracts, and network congestion can impact gas fee levels for ethereum miners. This is especially true due to the limited block size, which affects the efficiency of eth transfers. So, before embarking on your interstellar ETH transfer journey, investors should buckle up and get ready to learn how these fees, including the gas limit, play a significant role in determining the cost of using dApps. Here\u2019s a tip: consider the size of the transaction when calculating fees.\n\nBut wait! High gas fees have been a major concern for Ethereum investors, causing quite a stir within the community. Here\u2019s a tip to tackle the issue: consider the size of your transactions to avoid excessive fees. In this blog post, we\u2019ll delve into the hot topic of eth transfer fees and explore ways to keep those fees from burning through your digital pockets. We\u2019ll provide tips on how to protect yourself from potential attack and manage your eth gas efficiently.\n\nHow Gas Fees Work on the Ethereum Blockchain\n\nGas fees are an integral part of the Ethereum blockchain, serving as a measure of computational effort required to execute transactions or smart contracts. These fees help protect against potential attack on the network. These fees help protect against potential attack on the network. Understanding how gas fees and attacks work is crucial for anyone engaging with the Ethereum network, whether you are a user, miner, or developer.\n\nGas Consumption and Operations\n\nEach operation on the Ethereum network consumes a specific amount of gas, which includes a transaction fee. This fee is necessary to prevent attacks and ensure the priority of the transaction. These operations, including eth transfers and complex smart contract executions, can be affected by ethereum gas fees. It is important to keep track of the eth gas fees chart to avoid high fees. Additionally, it is crucial to be aware of potential attacks when conducting these operations. For example, executing a decentralized application (DApp) that involves multiple computations and interactions requires more gas compared to transferring Ether from one account to another. This is because the DApp is more vulnerable to attack.\n\nGas consumption in Ethereum (ETH) is influenced by factors such as the complexity of the operation, the data being processed, and the risk of a potential attack. As each transaction or smart contract execution consumes gas, it is important to consider these costs when interacting with the Ethereum blockchain to prevent any potential attack.\n\nSetting Gas Price and Transaction Prioritization\n\nUsers have the ability to set their desired gas price when submitting transactions in ETH. This feature helps protect against potential attacks. The gas price represents the amount of Ether they are willing to pay per unit of gas consumed during an attack. By setting a higher gas price, users incentivize miners to include their ETH transactions in blocks more quickly, reducing the risk of an attack.\n\nMiners play a vital role in processing transactions on the Ethereum network, defending against potential attack. They prioritize ETH transactions based on their potential earnings from gas fees to prevent an attack. Transactions with higher gas prices in eth are given priority, leading to faster processing times and confirmation on the blockchain, which helps prevent attack.\n\nFailed Transactions and Gas Costs\n\nEven if an ETH transaction fails due to an attack, error, or insufficient funds, it still incurs gas costs. This is because computational resources were utilized during its execution attempt, specifically for the eth gas. Therefore, it\u2019s essential to double-check transaction details and consult the ethereum gas fees chart before submitting them to avoid unnecessary expenses.\n\nFailed transactions in the Ethereum network can occur due to various reasons such as incorrect input data or insufficient gas limits set for complex operations involving eth. Being mindful of these factors can help minimize failed transaction costs and optimize your interaction with the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nGas Limits and Computation Restrictions\n\nGas limits are imposed on each block in the Ethereum blockchain, restricting the amount of computation that can be performed within a block. This limitation ensures that blocks remain manageable in size and prevents abuse of computational resources for eth.\n\nWhen submitting a transaction or executing a smart contract, it\u2019s important to consider the gas limit. If the gas required exceeds the block\u2019s gas limit, the transaction will fail. Therefore, users must estimate and set an appropriate gas limit to ensure successful execution.\n\nFactors Impacting High Ethereum Gas Fees\n\nNetwork Congestion and Competition for Block Space\n\nDuring peak usage periods, the Ethereum network experiences increased congestion, leading to a surge in gas fees. This is primarily due to the high demand for block space as more transactions compete to be included in each block. Think of it like rush hour traffic on a busy highway, where everyone is vying for a spot on the road.\n\nAs the number of transactions being processed increases, so does the competition among users who are willing to pay higher gas fees to have their transactions prioritized by miners. Miners are incentivized to include transactions with higher fees because they earn those fees as rewards. Consequently, this competition drives up gas fees and makes it more expensive for users to interact with the Ethereum network.\n\nComplex Smart Contracts and Higher Gas Costs\n\nSmart contracts on Ethereum can range from simple agreements to highly intricate programs with complex logic. The computational resources required to execute these smart contracts directly impact gas costs. More intricate smart contracts often involve multiple conditions, loops, or complex calculations that require additional processing power.\n\nWhen a user interacts with such a smart contract, they need to pay for every computation step executed by the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Each step consumes gas, and since gas has a monetary value attached to it, complex smart contracts naturally result in higher gas costs.\n\nDeFi\u2019s Contribution to High Gas Fees\n\nThe rise of decentralized finance (DeFi) applications has been one of the main factors contributing significantly to high gas fees on the Ethereum network. DeFi protocols enable users worldwide to access financial services without intermediaries using blockchain technology.\n\nHowever, many popular DeFi applications operate on Ethereum and rely heavily on smart contracts for their functionality. As more users flock towards DeFi platforms seeking opportunities such as yield farming or lending/borrowing assets, there is an exponential increase in transaction volume.\n\nThis surge in demand further amplifies network congestion, leading to higher gas fees. Users engaging in DeFi activities often find themselves paying substantial amounts just to interact with these platforms due to the intense competition for block space.\n\nScalability Limitations and Congestion Spikes\n\nThe current Ethereum network faces scalability limitations, which contribute to increased congestion and subsequent fee spikes. Ethereum\u2019s design, while groundbreaking, has struggled to keep up with the growing demand for its services.\n\nAs more users join the network and execute transactions simultaneously, the limited capacity of Ethereum\u2019s infrastructure becomes apparent. The network can only process a certain number of transactions per second, resulting in bottlenecks during peak periods.\n\nTo address this issue, Ethereum is undergoing a transition from its current Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) through the implementation of Ethereum 2.0. This upgrade aims to improve scalability by introducing shard chains that will increase the network\u2019s transaction processing capacity.\n\nInefficient Resource Allocation Mechanisms\n\nThe lack of efficient resource allocation mechanisms within the Ethereum network also affects fee optimization. Gas fees are determined by two main components: the base fee and priority fee.\n\nThe base fee increases when there is high demand for block space and decreases when there is less competition. However, it does not adjust instantaneously but rather follows a pricing algorithm that takes into account historical demand trends.\n\nCalculation of Ethereum Gas Fees: Pre and Post London Upgrade\n\nPre-London Upgrade:\n\nBefore the London upgrade, Ethereum gas fees were calculated by multiplying the \u201cgas price\u201d with the \u201cgas used.\u201d This calculation determined the total cost of a transaction on the Ethereum network. Users had the flexibility to manually set their preferred \u201cgas price\u201d based on urgency or priority.\n\nThe gas price represented the amount of Ether (ETH) users were willing to pay per unit of gas. Gas, in this context, referred to the computational effort required to execute a specific operation or smart contract on the network. The gas used indicated how much computational work was performed during a transaction.\n\nFor instance, if a user set a higher gas price and more gas was consumed for their transaction, they would end up paying a higher fee. Conversely, setting a lower gas price could result in slower processing times if miners prioritized transactions with higher fees.\n\nPost-London Upgrade:\n\nWith the introduction of EIP 1559 through the London upgrade, Ethereum aimed to improve fee predictability and reduce volatility. This upgrade brought significant changes to how gas fees were calculated and provided users with more control over their transactions.\n\nOne key element introduced by EIP 1559 was the concept of base fee. The base fee is dynamically adjusted based on network congestion levels, aiming to maintain blocks around 50% full. When there is high demand for block space, causing congestion, the base fee increases; conversely, during periods of low demand, it decreases. This mechanism allows for greater fee predictability as users can estimate how much they will need to pay based on prevailing network conditions.\n\nEIP 1559 introduced tips as an incentive mechanism for miners. Users can include tips when submitting transactions to incentivize miners for faster processing and inclusion in blocks. Tips are optional and go directly to miners as an additional reward beyond the base fee.\n\nThe inclusion of the base fee and tips provides users with a better understanding of how gas fees are determined. They can now make more informed decisions when setting their preferred gas price, taking into account the dynamic nature of the base fee and whether they want to add tips for faster transaction processing.\n\nWho Benefits from Ethereum Gas Fee Collection\n\nMiners: The Primary Beneficiaries\n\nMiners play a crucial role in the Ethereum network and are the primary beneficiaries of gas fee collection. These individuals or groups of individuals dedicate their computational power to validate transactions and secure the network. In return for their efforts, miners receive gas fees as rewards for including transactions in blocks they mine.\n\nWhen a user initiates a transaction on the Ethereum blockchain, they attach a certain amount of gas to it. This gas acts as fuel that powers the execution of smart contracts and dApps. Miners prioritize transactions with higher gas fees because including them in blocks allows them to earn more rewards. Thus, high gas fees can lead to increased miner revenue, creating an incentive for miners to actively participate in securing the network.\n\nIncentivizing Network Security and Participation\n\nThe collection of gas fees not only benefits miners but also incentivizes network security through mining participation. As miners compete to include transactions in blocks, they contribute to the overall security and decentralization of the Ethereum network. With more miners actively participating, it becomes increasingly difficult for any single entity or group to manipulate or control the system.\n\nFurthermore, high gas fees provide additional motivation for miners to invest in powerful hardware and infrastructure required for efficient mining operations. This investment strengthens the overall security of the network by increasing its computational power and making it more resistant to potential attacks.\n\nIndirect Benefits for the Ethereum Community\n\nWhile miners directly benefit from gas fee collection, the Ethereum community as a whole also reaps indirect benefits from this process. By supporting a secure and decentralized network through mining activities, miners help maintain trust among users and developers alike.\n\nA reliable blockchain infrastructure is essential for developers who create decentralized applications (dApps) or smart contracts on Ethereum. Gas fees ensure that these applications execute reliably without any interruption or manipulation. Developers can have confidence that once their code is deployed on the blockchain, it will operate as intended, providing a seamless user experience.\n\nDevelopers and the Reliable Execution of dApps\n\nDevelopers who create dApps or smart contracts are among the key beneficiaries of gas fee collection. Gas fees serve as a mechanism to prioritize transactions and ensure their reliable execution. By attaching an appropriate amount of gas to their transactions, users can guarantee that their interactions with dApps will be processed in a timely manner.\n\nGas fees also incentivize developers to optimize their code and make it more efficient. Since gas fees are directly related to the computational resources required for executing transactions, developers have an incentive to write smart contracts that minimize unnecessary operations and reduce gas consumption. This optimization benefits both users and developers by making transactions more cost-effective and improving overall network performance.\n\nStrategies to Reduce Ethereum Gas Fees\n\nOptimize Smart Contract Code and Reduce Complexity\n\nOne effective strategy for reducing Ethereum gas fees is to optimize the code of your smart contracts and minimize complexity. When writing smart contract code, every operation consumes gas, which in turn incurs fees. By optimizing your code, you can reduce the amount of gas consumed by each transaction, ultimately lowering the associated fees.\n\nTo achieve this optimization, it\u2019s important to carefully analyze and streamline your smart contract logic. Look for opportunities to simplify operations and eliminate any unnecessary steps. For example, you can avoid redundant calculations or data storage that may not be essential for the contract\u2019s functionality. By doing so, you can significantly decrease the gas consumption and subsequently reduce the fees paid for executing transactions on the Ethereum platform.\n\nUtilize Layer-Two Scaling Solutions\n\nAnother effective approach to mitigating high Ethereum gas fees is by leveraging layer-two scaling solutions. These solutions aim to alleviate congestion on the main Ethereum network by moving certain transactions off-chain or onto secondary networks known as sidechains or rollups.\n\nBy utilizing layer-two scaling solutions, you can significantly reduce gas costs for specific types of transactions that are suitable for off-chain processing. These solutions allow users to perform actions like token swaps or transfers at a fraction of the cost compared to executing them directly on the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nLayer-two scaling works by batching multiple transactions together and submitting them as a single transaction on-chain. This consolidation reduces overall gas consumption and enables more efficient use of network resources. However, it\u2019s important to note that not all types of transactions are suitable for layer-two scaling, so careful consideration should be given when deciding which actions can benefit from this approach.\n\nMonitor Network Congestion and Select Appropriate Times\n\nGas fees on Ethereum often fluctuate based on network congestion levels. During periods of high demand, such as when there are popular decentralized applications (dApps) or significant market activity, gas fees tend to spike. Conversely, during periods of lower network congestion, gas fees can be considerably lower.\n\nTo take advantage of lower gas fees, it\u2019s advisable to monitor the Ethereum network and select appropriate times for executing transactions. By observing historical trends and analyzing real-time data on gas prices, you can identify periods of relatively low congestion and initiate your transactions during those windows.\n\nVarious online platforms and tools provide information about current gas prices and network congestion levels. These resources enable users to make informed decisions regarding the optimal timing for their transactions. By strategically planning your activities based on network conditions, you can minimize the impact of high gas fees on your Ethereum transactions.\n\nLeverage Transaction Batching Techniques\n\nTransaction batching is a technique that allows multiple actions to be executed within a single transaction on the Ethereum platform. Instead of submitting each action as an individual transaction, batching combines them into one comprehensive transaction. This consolidation reduces the overall number of operations performed on-chain and subsequently lowers the associated gas fees.\n\nBy leveraging transaction batching techniques, you can optimize your Ethereum wallet\u2019s usage by grouping together similar actions or operations. For example, if you frequently perform token transfers or interact with multiple decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, you can combine these actions into a single batched transaction.\n\nBatching not only reduces gas consumption but also enhances efficiency by reducing the number of interactions required with smart contracts.\n\nFuture Outlook: Lowering Gas Costs and \u201cThe Merge\u201d\n\nUpcoming upgrades like Eth2 (Ethereum 2.0) aim to address scalability issues, potentially reducing network congestion and lowering gas costs.\n\nEth2, also known as Ethereum 2.0, holds great promise for the future of the Ethereum network. One of its primary objectives is to tackle the scalability challenges that have plagued Ethereum in recent years. As demand for transactions on the network has grown exponentially, so too have gas prices \u2013 a reflection of the cost associated with executing smart contracts and interacting with decentralized applications (dApps).\n\nWith Eth2, developers are working on introducing several significant upgrades that could alleviate these concerns. By implementing shard chains, Eth2 will enable parallel processing within the Ethereum network. This means that multiple transactions can be processed simultaneously across different shards, increasing the overall capacity of the network.\n\nImagine a busy highway with multiple lanes instead of just one congested road. Shard chains act as these additional lanes, allowing more vehicles (transactions) to flow smoothly without causing traffic jams or excessive delays. As a result, this expansion in capacity has the potential to significantly reduce network congestion and subsequently lower gas costs.\n\nThe introduction of shard chains in Eth2 will enable parallel processing, increasing the capacity of the Ethereum network.\n\nShard chains represent a fundamental shift in how Ethereum operates by introducing parallel processing capabilities. Currently, all transactions on Ethereum need to be processed sequentially through a single main chain known as the Beacon Chain. This limitation often leads to bottlenecks and increased transaction fees during periods of high demand.\n\nHowever, with shard chains set to be implemented in Eth2\u2019s roadmap, this bottleneck issue may soon become a thing of the past. Shard chains will allow for concurrent execution of transactions across different shards within the Ethereum ecosystem. Each shard will have its own mini-blockchain capable of handling its subset of transactions independently.\n\nThink of it as having multiple smaller teams working on different tasks simultaneously, rather than waiting for a single team to complete each task one after another. This parallel processing capability will significantly increase the network\u2019s capacity and throughput, enabling Ethereum to handle a much higher volume of transactions without experiencing congestion or exorbitant gas costs.\n\nThe implementation of \u201cThe Merge\u201d will transition Ethereum\u2019s consensus mechanism from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS), further improving scalability and energy efficiency while potentially impacting miner revenue streams.\n\n\u201cThe Merge\u201d refers to the upcoming transition in Ethereum\u2019s underlying consensus mechanism. Currently, Ethereum relies on the energy-intensive proof-of-work (PoW) algorithm for transaction validation and block creation. However, this approach has its limitations.\n\nTo address these concerns, Ethereum plans to shift from PoW to proof-of-stake (PoS) with the introduction of Eth2. In a PoS system, validators are chosen based on the number of cryptocurrency tokens they hold and are willing to \u201cstake\u201d as collateral. These validators then take turns proposing and validating blocks based on their stake, rather than through computational work as in PoW.\n\nThis transition holds several advantages for the Ethereum network. Firstly, it greatly improves scalability by reducing the computational burden required for transaction validation. Without relying on complex computations, PoS allows for faster block confirmation times and increased throughput.\n\nSignificance of Ethereum Gas Fees for Investors\n\nIn conclusion, understanding the significance of Ethereum gas fees is crucial for investors navigating the world of decentralized finance. Gas fees play a pivotal role in determining the cost and speed of transactions on the Ethereum blockchain. By comprehending how gas fees work and the factors that impact their levels, investors can make informed decisions to optimize their investment strategies.\n\nTo take advantage of lower gas fees and maximize your returns, consider implementing some practical strategies. For instance, you can leverage layer 2 solutions like Polygon or Optimism to conduct transactions at reduced costs. Staying updated with upcoming upgrades such as the London Upgrade and the long-awaited transition to Proof-of-Stake through \u201cThe Merge\u201d can provide insights into potential improvements in gas fee dynamics.\n\nRemember, investing in Ethereum is not just about buying and holding tokens; it also involves actively managing transaction costs. By keeping an eye on gas fees and adopting smart strategies, you can position yourself for success in this ever-evolving landscape.\n\nFAQs\n\nWhat are some common factors that contribute to high Ethereum gas fees?\n\nSeveral factors contribute to high Ethereum gas fees. The most significant ones include network congestion, demand for computational resources required by smart contracts, and the complexity of executing specific operations within a transaction.\n\nCan I reduce my Ethereum gas fees without compromising transaction speed?\n\nYes! There are several strategies you can employ to reduce your Ethereum gas fees while still maintaining reasonable transaction speeds. Some options include utilizing layer 2 scaling solutions, batching multiple transactions together, or conducting transactions during periods of lower network activity.\n\nWho collects the Ethereum gas fees?\n\nEthereum miners collect the gas fees associated with each transaction they process. These miners provide computational power to validate transactions and secure the network while being rewarded with both newly minted Ether (ETH) and collected transaction fees.\n\nAre there any plans to lower Ethereum gas costs in the future?\n\nYes! The Ethereum community has been actively working on various solutions to lower gas costs. The London Upgrade, which introduced the EIP-1559 fee structure, is one example. The upcoming transition to Proof-of-Stake through \u201cThe Merge\u201d is expected to significantly reduce gas fees by replacing miners with validators.\n\nHow can I stay updated on Ethereum gas fee dynamics and optimizations?\n\nTo stay informed about Ethereum gas fee dynamics and optimizations, it\u2019s recommended to follow reputable sources such as official Ethereum blogs, developer forums like Reddit\u2019s r/ethereum subreddit, and influential voices in the blockchain space. Joining relevant online communities or participating in decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms can provide valuable insights from experienced users."

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nEthereum drops to a 14-month low versus Bitcoin.\n\nWhales and Vitalik Buterin send $60 million worth of ETH to exchanges.\n\nThe ETH/BTC ratio has recently decreased, continuing a pattern that started more than a year ago.\n\nNew on-chain study shows that Ether (ETH) is currently trading 27% below its value.\n\nAs major token holders, like Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, shifted their holdings to cryptocurrency exchanges, presumably as a prelude to selling, the Ether-to-Bitcoin ratio fell to a 14-month low.\n\nAccording to TradingView statistics , ETH-BTC fell as close to 0.0602 on Wednesday, its lowest value since July.\n\nThe second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization had a recent price movement that continued a trend that started in September 2022 and supported some gloomy analyst predictions.\n\nPopular crypto analyst and founder of IntoTheCryptoverse, Benjamin Cowen, in an X post that there may be a breakdown in the value of ETH relative to BTC.\n\n\u201cA more significant move to the downside\u2026\u201d\n\n\ud83d\udcfahttps://t.co/iuq2iTBFaI pic.twitter.com/J1x7qgYDRJ \u2014 Into The Cryptoverse (@ITC_Crypto) September 19, 2023\n\nEthereum Whales On the Move\n\nThe most recent price drop happened when some well-known investors, or \u201cwhales,\u201d recently deposited a total of $60 million ETH to cryptocurrency exchanges, setting up fears about additional price drops.\n\nMarket watchers closely monitor whale on-chain moves, as they\u2019re seen as informed and influential. Deposits on an exchange signal potential selling, while withdrawals suggest accumulation.\n\nThe most recent move was made by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin who sent 300 ETH, or about $493,000, to Kraken, according to blockchain statistics compiled by security company PeckShield. Despite the deposit\u2019s modest size, it sparked curiosity among cryptocurrency observers due to Buterin\u2019s prominence for Ethereum.\n\nAnother significant investor recently made a total of 30,000 ETH deposits to the cryptocurrency exchanges Binance, OKX, and KuCoin, amounting to around $50 million, according to Lookonchain.\n\nLookonchain also noted that 6,000 ETH, or slightly under $10 million, were deposited to Kraken on Monday by a cryptocurrency wallet that had purchased tokens from Ethereum\u2019s initial coin offering (ICO) nine years prior.\n\nEthereum Undervalued at $275 Billion Market Cap\n\nAccording to a recent analysis using a new version of Metcalfe\u2019s Law, the network value of Ethereum is north of $275 billion.\n\nIn its most recent analysis, RxR, a partnership between Re7 Capital and Republic Crypto, estimated that ETH is fairly valued at $275 billion. If some important elements are taken into account holistically, the analysis claims that the network is currently selling 27% below fair value.\n\nThe study used a new Metcalfe-centric model to reach its conclusion and pointed out that current models do not account for scale dynamics. RxR\u2019s models rely on data from the layer 2 networks of Ethereum, unlike conventional models that prioritise the quantity of active users on the network\u2019s mainnet.\n\nMetcalfe\u2019s rule posits that a network\u2019s financial worth precisely equals the square of its connected user count. However, with layer 2 activities incorporated into the model, it yields new findings.\n\nLewis Harland, an RxR analyst, explained that the \u201cEthereum\u2019s network valuation tracks the updated ML index better when the active user base of Ethereum\u2019s scaling networks is factored into the model than when omitted.\u201d\n\nThe research analyst stated that integrating L2 activities made long-term estimates more accurate. The experts emphasized that overlooking L2 and off-chain activity might create a misleading impression of the Ethereum network being overvalued.\n\nWith a market capitalization of $199 billion and a price of $1,655, Ethereum is currently displaying signs of a rally. Contrary to common belief, the market has not yet \u201cpriced in\u201d the levels of network adoption for Ethereum, according to RxR\u2019s blended model.\n\nHarland stated that Ethereum\u2019s user growth as an application platform will likely surpass that of simple value-transfer networks over time, implying higher relative valuations according to Metcalfe\u2019s law.\n\nThe Blooming L2 Ecosystem of Ethereum\n\nThe L2 area of Ethereum has seen a flurry of activity as numerous projects test out creative solutions to the network\u2019s scaling problems. With their innovative products, Arbitrum and Optimism are pushing the limits of Ethereum\u2019s scaling, and Coinbase\u2019s BASE is seeing extremely high adoption rates.\n\nGiven the reliance on rollups and other cutting-edge scaling techniques, aggregate total value locked (TVL) rose over $10 billion with over 30 L2 networks in use. Experts praised the increase in L2 activity for preventing single points of failure and significantly easing congestion."

        "title": "Understanding Ethereum Merge: A Game-Changer for Cryptocurrency Investors - Finance Magnates",
        "content": "The cryptocurrency industry was buzzing with expectation and excitement as Ethereum, the second-largest blockchain by market capitalization, prepared for the Ethereum Merge. In this detailed article, we will look at the Ethereum Merge concept, its relevance in the crypto industry, the mechanics of this transfer, and the impact it had on cryptocurrency investors.\n\nIntroduction\n\nSince its creation, Ethereum, also known as the backbone of the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), has used a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism. However, the scalability and energy efficiency of Ethereum have long been a source of contention. The Ethereum community went through a long journey known as the Ethereum Merge to address these concerns and pave the path for a more sustainable and scalable future.\n\nUnderstanding the Ethereum Network\n\nBefore we go into the Ethereum Merge, let's take a quick look at the Ethereum network and its current state. Ethereum is a decentralized blockchain that allows smart contracts and decentralized apps (DApps) to be created. It has garnered significant acceptance because to its adaptability and programmability, enabling a plethora of initiatives in the cryptocurrency industry.\n\nIntroduction of Ethereum Merge\n\nThe Ethereum Merge includes the network's consensus mechanism switching from proof of work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS Proof-of-Stake (PoS) Proof-of-stake is a type of consensus algorithm in which a blockchain network aims to achieve distributed consensus. It is also process used to reach an agreement on a single data value. In PoS-based cryptos, the creator of the next block is chosen through various combinations and parameters. In essence, an individual person can mine or validate block transactions based on how many coins he or she holds. Adhering to this concept, the more Bitcoin or altcoin owned by a miner, the greater the mini Proof-of-stake is a type of consensus algorithm in which a blockchain network aims to achieve distributed consensus. It is also process used to reach an agreement on a single data value. In PoS-based cryptos, the creator of the next block is chosen through various combinations and parameters. In essence, an individual person can mine or validate block transactions based on how many coins he or she holds. Adhering to this concept, the more Bitcoin or altcoin owned by a miner, the greater the mini Read this Term). This modification fundamentally alters how transactions are validated and new blocks are added to the ethereum blockchain. PoS selects validators to create new blocks based on the amount of cryptocurrency they own and are prepared to stake ether as collateral, whereas PoW relies on miners solving complicated mathematical riddles.\n\nKeep Reading KuCoin and Revolut Forge Alliance for Instant Euro-to-Crypto Transactions\n\nOne Year After the Ethereum Merge: What Has Changed?\n\nEthereum's transition from proof of work to proof of stake led to a dramatic reduction in energy consumption. The network's carbon footprint decreased by 99.99%, aligning with growing environmental concerns associated with crypto.\n\nIn what concerns liquid staking, the amount of Ethereum staked has nearly doubled since the merge, with 26.5 million Ethereum, worth around $43 billion, now staked.\n\nEthereum's scalability, however, still remains a key concern for adoption. While the merge itself didn't directly impact speed, the upcoming \"surge\" upgrades are expected to enhance Ethereum's scalability. Layer-2 solutions have already increased transactions per second significantly.\n\nAs for regulatory challenges, staking has become a regulatory focal point in the U.S., with the SEC targeting crypto exchanges offering staking services. Ethereum's classification remains uncertain, creating a regulatory divide between the SEC and CFTC.\n\nLastly, in terms of supply and the project\u2019s direction, the merge has altered Ethereum's token supply dynamics, resulting in a decrease in the overall circulating supply. This change highlights Ethereum's long-term direction and its ability to implement major technical upgrades.\n\nExploring Proof-of-Stake\n\nThe Ethereum Merge is a component of Ethereum 2.0, a set of improvements designed at improving the network's scalability, security, and sustainability. Ethereum 2.0, also known as ETH2 or Serenity, introduced numerous significant enhancements, including shard chains for greater throughput, eWASM for enhanced smart contract capabilities, and, of course, the Ethereum Merge to shift to PoS.\n\nExamining the Pros and Cons of Using Proof of Stake for Ethereum Merge\n\nThe adoption of PoS via the Ethereum Merge has both advantages and cons.\n\nPros:\n\nEnergy Efficiency: When compared to PoW, PoS utilizes substantially less energy, alleviating concerns about Ethereum's carbon footprint.\n\nWhen compared to PoW, PoS utilizes substantially less energy, alleviating concerns about Ethereum's carbon footprint. Security: By forcing validators to maintain a considerable stake, PoS adds a stronger level of security, making malevolent behavior monetarily impractical.\n\nBy forcing validators to maintain a considerable stake, PoS adds a stronger level of security, making malevolent behavior monetarily impractical. Scalability: PoS can theoretically process more transactions per second than Ethereum, potentially addressing Ethereum's scalability Scalability Scalability is a term that describes the constraints of a network via hash rates to meet increased demand. In the context of Bitcoin, scalability reflects the issue in which a limited rate can process transactions adequately.Blocks within the Bitcoin blockchain are limited in both size and frequency. The overall transaction processing capacity of the network is dictated by the average block creation time of 10 minutes as well as a block size limit of 1 megabyte. Consequently, this leads to pain Scalability is a term that describes the constraints of a network via hash rates to meet increased demand.

The overall transaction processing capacity of the network is dictated by the average block creation time of 10 minutes as well as a block size limit of 1 megabyte. Consequently, this leads to pain Read this Term\n\nCons:\n\nCritics contended that PoS could lead to centralization because individuals with larger stakes would have more control over the network.\n\nTransition Difficulties: Transitioning from PoW to PoS is always a challenging process fraught with technical difficulties that must be properly addressed.\n\nWhile PoS has numerous benefits, it also raises questions about the allocation of money and power within the network. Critics were concerned that these changes would benefit the wealthy and powerful, potentially leading to a more centralized ecosystem. Furthermore, the switch to PoS demanded a robust and secure network upgrade, which was no easy task.\n\nImpact on Cryptocurrency Investors\n\nLet us now look at how the Ethereum Merge influenced cryptocurrency investors.\n\nThe switch to PoS was expected to boost Ethereum's value by addressing worries about energy usage and scalability. It enticed more institutional investors who have been wary of PoW networks like Bitcoin due to environmental issues.\n\nFurthermore, Ethereum's update to Ethereum 2.0, which includes the introduction of shard chains, created new opportunities for developers, resulting in an increase in decentralized applications and DeFi initiatives. Active investors in these industries seek to benefit from higher returns.\n\nThe shift was bound to bring up uncertainties and price swings which is why diversifying one's crypto portfolio beyond Ethereum was recommended for optimal risk management.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Ethereum Merge was a watershed point in the evolution of blockchain technology. As Ethereum upgraded and transitioned from PoW to PoS, it aspired to become more sustainable, scalable, and secure, hence offering up new opportunities for innovation and growth within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. While the transformation was fraught with difficulties and uncertainty, it also presented tremendous potential for both investors and developers.\n\nFAQ\n\nWhat Is Beacon Chain?\n\nThe Beacon Chain is a PoS blockchain that runs alongside Ethereum's existing PoW chain. It was introduced to lay the groundwork for Ethereum 2.0 and to make the transition to PoS easier. The major function of the Beacon Chain is to coordinate validators and administer the PoS consensus mechanism.\n\nWhat Is Ethereum 2.0?\n\nEthereum 2.0, also known as Eth2 or Serenity, is a set of improvements intended at improving Ethereum's scalability, security, and long-term viability. It features the Ethereum Merge shift to PoS, the introduction of shard chains for increased throughput, and the inclusion of eWASM for advanced smart contract capabilities.\n\nWhat are the benefits of the Ethereum merge?\n\nThe Ethereum Merge provides various advantages, including higher energy efficiency, increased security via PoS, improved scalability, and the potential for a value boom. It overcomes the environmental concerns raised by PoW, making Ethereum more appealing to institutional investors and environmentally sensitive users. Furthermore, the enhancements to Ethereum 2.0 may stimulate innovation and growth in the DeFi and DApp sectors, benefiting both investors and developers."

        "content": "A flurry of transactions from Binance wallets sent Ethereum gas fees soaring Thursday morning.\n\nThe transaction spree cost Binance over $844,000.\n\nLast year, a near identical event occurred, but Binance gave prior notice that time.\n\nA flurry of transactions from Binance-connected crypto wallets sent Ethereum fees soaring Thursday morning, leaving onlookers confused.\n\nAt around 10:30 a.m. in London, data from blockchain explorer Etherscan showed hundreds of long-inactive wallets that simultaneously started sending Ether to a single wallet tagged as Binance 14.\n\nThe transactions continued for approximately 20 minutes, and caused Ethereum gas fees to jump from around 15 to 300 gwei. This caused the cost to process simple peer-to-peer Ether transactions to shoot up from around 40 cents to over $10.\n\nA Binance spokesperson told DL News the transactions were part of a \u201croutine consolidation\u201d of Ether to one of its wallets. \u201cAny impact to gas prices was unintentional but quickly resolved,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\nStay ahead of the game with our weekly newsletters Subscribe\n\nOn Ethereum, \u201cgas\u201d refers to the fee associated with the computational work necessary to process transactions or execute smart contract operations. Its cost, or \u201cgas price,\u201d is typically expressed in gwei. Just as a dollar is divided into 100 cents, one Ether is divided into a billion gwei.\n\nBinance spent over $844,000 on the transactions, according to Etherscan data.\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time Binance has clogged Ethereum with transactions.\n\nIn December, a near identical event occurred, but for transfers of Tether\u2019s USDT stablecoin. But unlike today\u2019s spike in gas fees caused by Binance activity, that one came with a prior notice.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nJust before the activity, Binance said that it was consolidating funds from various deposit addresses in preparation for a Proof of Reserves audit.\n\n\u201cAs a result, during this time you may notice temporary increases in ETH gas fees,\u201d the post said at the time.\n\nProof of Reserve audits are where centralised crypto exchanges create a cryptographic proof to show they hold enough assets to back all users\u2019 crypto deposits. Exchanges do this to reassure depositors that they will be able to withdraw all the crypto they hold there at any time.\n\nBinance 14 is one of several Binance exchange wallets. It\u2019s a non-custodial wallet controlled by Binance where the exchange stores crypto deposits from its users.\n\nAn error?\n\nBinance\u2019s choice to again conduct numerous simultaneous transactions is puzzling, given that spacing them out could have prevented network congestion and resulted in lower fees.\n\nIn the aftermath, some onlookers pointed out that Binance had overpaid for the transactions. If the exchange had spread out its transactions, instead of firing them all off at once, it could have avoided clogging the network and paid less in fees.\n\nThat\u2019s because Ethereum gas fees \u2014 small amounts of Ether paid to the blockchain to process transactions \u2014 increase as activity on the blockchain increases.\n\nWhen there are many transactions waiting to be processed, Ethereum automatically ups the cost to submit new transactions. Such a feature is necessary to protect Ethereum from spam attacks."

        "content": "Ether (ETH) has seen a 36% year-to-date increase in its price in 2023 in U.S. dollar terms. This recovery, however, is modest given that ETH is currently trading 66% below its November 2021 peak of $4,870.\n\nEthereum vs. Bitcoin: 14-month downtrend and counting\n\nMoreover, on Sept. 20, Ether reached its lowest levels against Bitcoin (BTC) in 14 months, breaching the critical 0.06 BTC support. This has raised questions among Ether investors about the factors behind this price decline and what it will take to reverse the trend.\n\nETH/BTC price on Coinbase. Source: TradingView\n\nETH buyers placed their biggest hopes on protocol upgrades that significantly reduced the need for new coin issuance when the network transitioned to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism.\n\nThese hopes were realized in mid-September 2022, resulting in an annualized issuance rate of just 0.25% of the supply. This transformation aligned with the Ethereum community\u2019s vision of \u201cultrasound money.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, the subsequent Shapella upgrade on April 12 allowed for withdrawals from the native staking protocol, addressing a major concern for investors. Previously, both the 32 ETH deposits and the yield from participating in the network consensus were locked up indefinitely.\n\nConfidence among Ethereum enthusiasts grew as these significant hurdles were crossed with minimal issues. They anticipated that the price of Ether would surpass $2,000, a prediction that came true on April 14.\n\nHowever, this optimism was short-lived, as ETH\u2019s price promptly fell back to the same $1,850 level just a week later.\n\nNotably, instead of witnessing a net withdrawal, Ethereum staking experienced a net inflow of 3.1 million ETH in the 30 days following the Shappela upgrade, surpassing even the most optimistic expectations.\n\nGiven that the Ethereum network\u2019s planned developments have generally been on track, albeit with the customary delays, investors now need to explore other potential catalysts for reversing the current downtrend in Ether\u2019s price relative to BTC.\n\nExternal factors present important triggers for ETH price\n\nOne of these potential catalysts lies in the ongoing legal battle between Ripple (formerly Ripple Labs) and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which could significantly impact Ether\u2019s price momentum.\n\nThe SEC contends that XRP (XRP) sales to retail investors constitute a securities offering. However, in July, Judge Analisa Torres ruled that XRP generally does not qualify as a security under SEC guidelines, especially when distributed through exchanges.\n\nAs noted by the \u201cAmerican lawyer and Bitcoiner\u201d Bryan Jacoutot on X (formerly Twitter), the Ethereum Foundation remains exposed due to the presale of ETH directed toward institutional investors and subject to a lock-up period.\n\n(1/12) ANALYSIS: I've reviewed the district court ruling on XRP and it rests on very shaky ground. Expect an appeal.\n\n\n\nAND Ethereum Foundation remains at risk even if its upheld because of important distinctions in the methods used by Ripple to sell the \"pre-mine\"\n\n\n\n\u2b07\ufe0f\u2b07\ufe0f \u2014 Bryan Jacoutot (@BryanJacoutot) July 13, 2023\n\nAccording to Jacoutot, even if Ripple were to secure a favorable outcome, it wouldn\u2019t immediately mitigate the risks for Ethereum. Nevertheless, it\u2019s undeniable that the regulatory uncertainty surrounding the Ether initial coin offering (ICO) remains a source of concern for investors.\n\nOn Sept. 20, an Ethereum address associated with the ICO era showed its first activity, transferring 32.1 ETH (valued at $52,000 at the time) directly to Coinbase. This additional movement only amplified regulatory concerns since there are no apparent incentives for addresses that have remained dormant for four to eight years to divest at this particular point in the market cycle.\n\nAn Ethereum ICO participant who has been dormant for 8 years transferred 32.1 $ETH to #Coinbase just now.\n\n\n\nThe address received 200 $ETH at Ethereum Genesis.\n\n\n\nAnd the address appears to be related to shemnon.eth (@shemnon).https://t.co/nj5eF8iRT0 pic.twitter.com/6Viytn4dU5 \u2014 Lookonchain (@lookonchain) September 20, 2023\n\nA similar occurrence unfolded with an address linked to Vitalik Buterin, which sent 300 ETH (worth $490,000 at the time) to the Kraken exchange on Sept. 19.\n\nMore positive news gives hope to Ethereum investors\n\nOn the news side, Ethereum has seen some positive surprises, such as the unexpected request for a spot Ether exchange-traded fund by ARK Invest and 21Shares on Sept. 6. This development reduced the risks associated with excessive institutional concentration in Bitcoin, particularly if the ETF is approved.\n\nAdditionally, Canto, a layer-1 Cosmos-native blockchain, announced its expansion to Ethereum\u2019s layer 2 on Sept. 18. This zero-knowledge, permissionless rollup, compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine, is primarily focused on bringing traditional finance into the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nShould Bitcoin\u2019s price surge be driven solely by the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF or inflation concerns in the United States, Ether is well-positioned to follow suit, benefiting from the same catalysts.\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum\u2019s primary competitors in the decentralized applications sector, namely Solana and BNB Chain, face similar risks pertaining to ICO and securities regulations, making it unlikely for them to challenge Ethereum\u2019s dominance in terms of total value locked and trading volumes.\n\nCollect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

        "content": "Polygon Labs has suggested that the Celo blockchain community utilize its Chain Development Kit (CDK) for their upcoming Layer 2 transition on Ethereum.\n\nThis proposal surfaces after Celo\u2019s core team, cLabs, revealed an alternative idea involving a transition from Layer 1 to an Ethereum-based Layer 2 using software from OP Labs named OP Stack.\n\nSandeep Nailwal, Polygon\u2019s co-founder, voiced his proposal on Celo\u2019s governance forum, stating, \u201cWe propose the Celo Ecosystem to employ the Polygon CDK for its L2 migration. The CDK is an open-source toolset that facilitates developers in constructing ZK-powered L2s for Ethereum. Its beauty lies in the ease with which it allows L1s to transition to Ethereum L2s, coupled with an emphasis on modularity.\u201d\n\nPolygon\u2019s CDK, a product of Polygon Labs, is rooted in open-source principles. It\u2019s tailored for the creation of Layer 2s, which utilize zero-knowledge rollup technology, inheriting Ethereum\u2019s robust security via ZK proofs.\n\nYou might also like: Celo unveils 2-megabyte stablecoin wallet for Opera Mini\n\nThis innovative software kit hasn\u2019t gone unnoticed. Established blockchain enterprises like Canto, Astar, Immutable, IDEX, and Palm Network have already expressed their keen interest, collaborating with Polygon Labs for their Ethereum(ETH) Layer 2 migration needs.\n\nAs discussions ensue, Rene Reinsberg, Celo\u2019s co-founder, indicated that cLabs is keen on involving the wider community in their deliberation process, ensuring a transparent and communal decision-making process.\n\nHowever, the Layer 2 migration scene is bustling with activity and options. Numerous teams are exploring transitions to the Ethereum Layer 2 ecosystem, with many having a range of software tools at their disposal, courtesy of prolific teams like Polygon, Optimism(OP), and Arbitrum(ARB).\n\nA captivating dynamic is observed with Polygon\u2019s CDK and OP Stack from Optimism Labs. While various entities, including Base and Zora, have embraced OP Stack\u2019s optimistic rollups for Layer 2 designs, Polygon\u2019s CDK remains a compelling alternative, accentuating the potential of zero-knowledge rollups.\n\nRead more: Animoca brands partners with Celo to drive web3 adoption with focus on sustainability\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "content": "The ether-to-bitcoin ratio dropped to a 14-month low as large token holders, including Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, moved coins to crypto exchanges, possibly as a prelude to selling.\n\nETH-BTC dipped to near 0.0602 on Tuesday, according to TradingView data, its lowest reading since July.\n\nThe recent price action extended a trend that began in September 2022, confirming some bearish forecasts from analysts for the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.\n\nMarcus Thielen, head of strategy and research at Matrixport, said Monday on CoinDeskTV that Ethereum\u2019s protocol revenues have been decreasing for the last three months, and expected BTC to continue outperforming the broader crypto market, including ETH.\n\nPopular crypto analyst Benjamin Cowen, founder of IntoTheCryptoverse, noted in an X post that a potential breakdown in the ETH\u2019s valuation versus BTC could be in the cards.\n\nLarge ETH investors on the move\n\nThe latest slide in price occurred as some prominent investors \u2013 also known as whales \u2013 have recently deposited a total of $60 million ETH to crypto exchanges, raising alarms about further declines in price.\n\nMarket participants closely follow the on-chain maneuvers of whales, as they are considered well-informed and have a sizable impact on the market. Depositing assets to an exchange usually signals intention to sell, while withdrawals suggest accumulation.\n\nMost recently, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin transferred 300 ETH \u2013 worth roughly $493,000 \u2013 to Kraken on Tuesday, according to blockchain data noted by security firm PeckShield. While the deposit is rather small, it spurred speculation among crypto watchers given Buterin\u2019s stature for Ethereum.\n\nAnother large holder deposited a total of 30,000 ETH \u2013 worth nearly $50 million \u2013 to crypto exchanges Binance, OKX and KuCoin over the past four days, blockchain sleuth Lookonchain noted.\n\nLookonchain also pointed out that a crypto wallet that acquired tokens from Ethereum\u2019s initial coin offering (ICO) nine years ago deposited Monday 6,000 ETH \u2013 worth just shy of $10 million \u2013 to Kraken.\n\nThis entity received roughly 255,000 ETH during the ICO, now worth $423 million Lookonchain noted. Given that the token\u2019s initial price was around 31 cents, selling the coinw now at $1,650 would represent a 527,000% profit."

        "title": "Better Buy: Bitcoin vs. Ethereum - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Despite recent volatility in the crypto markets, Bitcoin (BTC -2.26%) and Ethereum (ETH -0.60%) remain two of the best-performing large-market-cap cryptos. For the year, Bitcoin is now up 65% while Ethereum is up 40%.\n\nBased on recent performance, Bitcoin would seem to be the obvious better buy. But just remember -- past performance is no guarantee of future performance. If you are a long-term investor, you need to keep your eye on future developments as well. With that in mind, there are three key factors that could determine which crypto is the better buy over the long haul.\n\nFlow of institutional money\n\nThe most important factor remains the flow of institutional money into the crypto asset class. Currently, Bitcoin appears to have a massive edge over Ethereum, with many institutional investors viewing it as a \"safe haven\" asset that can protect them from volatility in the broader market. We saw this scenario play itself out earlier this year, when a regional banking crisis in the U.S. immediately led to a flow of new money into Bitcoin, which in turn led to rapid price gains.\n\nMoreover, this entire summer seemed to be dominated by one single topic: the launch of the first-ever spot Bitcoin ETF. This led to a mini-rally for Bitcoin in mid-June, as investors recalibrated what it could mean for institutional investor flows into crypto if the SEC finally signs off on a spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nHere, too, Bitcoin seems to have the edge over Ethereum, since there seems to be much more investor appetite for a spot Bitcoin ETF than a spot Ethereum ETF. As long as that remains the case, there will likely be more institutional money flowing into Bitcoin than Ethereum.\n\nUser adoption rates\n\nThe next major factor to keep in mind is user adoption rates. The big-picture view here is that, as both Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to go mainstream, they will both likely see a massive surge in their built-in user bases. So which blockchain is set to grow at a faster pace in coming years?\n\nFor Bitcoin, some of the best user adoption rate numbers come from Cathie Wood and Ark Invest, which released a research report this year with a set of scenarios to describe how Bitcoin usage will increase between now and the year 2030. In a base-case scenario, for example, Bitcoin could soon account for 3% of the M2 money supply of emerging market nations, 10% of the remittance asset market, and 2.5% of all institutional assets. Over time, these percentages could grow even higher, as Bitcoin increasingly goes mainstream around the world.\n\nIn the case of Ethereum, the best user adoption rate numbers typically come from valuation models based on Metcalfe's Law, which states that the value of any network is directly proportional to the square of the number of users on it. This law has been used to model the valuation of telecom and internet companies, and now it is being used to model the valuation of cryptocurrencies. Thus, it's very possible that Ethereum's future valuation could be quadratic, not linear, in nature as more users are added to its ecosystem.\n\nThe easiest place to see the impact of this growth happening is in the Layer 2 space, which describes all of the blockchains that are building directly on top of the main Ethereum blockchain. By some accounts, Ethereum's total market capitalization should be $250 billion right now, not $200 billion, if you calculate all of the extra user activity that is happening on Layer 2 blockchain networks. In short, Ethereum could be undervalued by as much as 25% right now.\n\nTechnological improvements\n\nIf there's one area where Ethereum has a decided edge, it's in the technology supporting its blockchain. Whereas Bitcoin is built on old, proof-of-work technology that requires expensive, energy-intensive mining, Ethereum recently transitioned to new, proof-of-stake technology that does not require mining at all. As soon as Ethereum pulled off The Merge last year, it immediately became 99.9% more energy-efficient.\n\nAnd Ethereum is hardly resting on its laurels. As founder Vitalik Buterin has pointed out, Ethereum still has at least five new cycles of technological improvement incoming, all of which will finally lead to the creation of a super-fast, super-efficient \"Ethereum 2.0.\" When that happens, Ethereum will become one of the fastest, most secure transaction networks in the world.\n\nAnd the winner is...\n\nCrypto investors for years have been looking forward to \"the flippening\" -- the moment in time when Ethereum finally overtakes (i.e., \"flips\") Bitcoin as the most valuable crypto in the world. For that to happen, Ethereum's future growth needs to outpace Bitcoin's future growth by a significant margin.\n\nBased on the above, it's possible to see such a scenario taking place. But for now, I'm sticking with Bitcoin, which currently accounts for approximately 50% of the total market value of the entire crypto market. As long as Bitcoin remains the clear favorite option of both retail and institutional investors, it's likely to outpace Ethereum as the better buy going forward."

        "content": "In the dynamic landscape of cryptocurrency, while Bitcoin maintains a stronghold in terms of market share across most US states, certain regions have shown an increased inclination towards Ethereum. According to recent findings, four states \u2014 New Jersey, Colorado, Florida, and Wisconsin \u2014 stand out with a higher Ethereum preference.\n\nLet\u2019s delve deeper into the reasons behind this shift.\n\nTop 4 US states that prefer Ethereum over Bitcoin in 2023\n\nNew Jersey\u2019s interest in Ethereum and crypto\n\nNew Jersey\u2019s recent legislative moves clearly signal its intent to become a pivotal crypto hub. The state\u2019s General Assembly has passed the \u201cDigital Assets and Blockchain Regulation\u201d Act, which introduces a range of provisions favorable for the cryptocurrency sector. It lays down regulations for digital assets, cryptocurrencies, and blockchain technologies and paves the way for decentralized autonomous organizations to establish themselves within the state.\n\nSen. Robert Singer\u2019s comments reflect the state\u2019s approach: \u201cWe want to be more industry-friendly.\u201d This, combined with incentives for virtual currency businesses and the focus on blockchain integration, positions New Jersey at the forefront of Ethereum adoption.\n\nColorado: The home of ETHDenver\n\nGovernor Jared Polis\u2019s 2022 announcement to establish Colorado as a center for crypto innovation has borne fruit. The state has introduced a program allowing tax payments through cryptocurrency and embraced Ethereum-centric events like ETHDenver.\n\nETHDenver, one of the largest web3 conferences in the world, has seen enormous support from the blockchain community. Its mission to build Colorado as the ultimate destination for a decentralized future is making significant strides. The event\u2019s community-funded approach and the proposed $10 million fund for decentralized projects further amplify Colorado\u2019s commitment to Ethereum and the broader blockchain ecosystem.\n\nFlorida: Crypto Adoption led by a passionate Mayor and Governor\n\nFlorida is emerging as an attractive destination for crypto investment, thanks to the efforts of Governor Ron DeSantis and Miami Mayor Francis Suarez. The state\u2019s endeavors to integrate blockchain technology into various sectors and Mayor Suarez\u2019s aggressive campaign to lure crypto businesses to the region have significantly fueled Ethereum\u2018s popularity. The renaming of the Miami Heat\u2019s stadium to FTX Arena (before FTX went down in flames and the stadium quickly ditched the moniker) and the symbolic gesture of leaders receiving pay in Bitcoin testify to the state\u2019s growing enthusiasm for digital currencies. With the state attracting several businesses and developers, there is hardly any surprise why they lean more heavily towards the sophisticated use cases of the Ethereum ecosystem over Bitcoin.\n\nWisconsin: The Silent Ethereum Advocate\n\nThere is not much information out there about Wisconsin\u2019s interest in crypto. However, the survey suggests otherwise. The state, known for its progressive approach towards technology and innovation, is likely recognizing Ethereum\u2018s potential beyond just a digital currency. As Ethereum establishes itself as a robust platform for decentralized applications, states like Wisconsin, which value technological progress, would naturally gravitate towards it.\n\nWhy should you buy Ethereum instead of Bitcoin?\n\nCertainly, Bitcoin holds the mantle as the premier cryptocurrency, its pioneering presence and vast adoption making it a household name. However, when diving into the intricate tapestry of blockchain technology, Ethereum emerges as a potent contender, not just as a cryptocurrency but as a comprehensive platform for decentralized applications and smart contracts.\n\nEthereum\u2018s programmability is its trump card. This isn\u2019t just about trading or holding a currency; it\u2019s about harnessing a versatile framework upon which a myriad of applications can be built. In essence, Ethereum offers an entire ecosystem, opening doors to decentralized finance (DeFi), gaming, art, and much more.\n\nThis functionality has a magnetic pull on states with a burgeoning crypto presence and developer community. Consider Colorado and Florida; their robust crypto-awareness has led them to prefer the multifunctional Ethereum over the monolithic Bitcoin. As these states champion technological innovation, it\u2019s only logical for them to gravitate toward a platform that offers more than just a digital currency.\n\nIn Conclusion\n\nWhile Bitcoin remains a significant player in the cryptocurrency market, Ethereum\u2019s multifaceted capabilities, from decentralized finance (DeFi) to smart contracts, are drawing the attention of progressive states. The proactive measures by the states of New Jersey, Colorado, Florida, and Wisconsin clearly indicate Ethereum\u2018s growing significance in the US\u2019s crypto narrative. As 2023 unfolds, observing how other states respond to this trend and the innovations that Ethereum will undoubtedly catalyze will be interesting.\n\nFAQ\n\nIs it better to buy Bitcoin or Ethereum?\n\nBuying Bitcoin or Ethereum often boils down to individual investment goals and risk tolerance. Being the first and most well-established cryptocurrency, Bitcoin is often seen as a \u201cstore of value\u201d and likened to \u201cdigital gold.\u201d On the other hand, Ethereum offers a platform for decentralized applications and smart contracts, making it a currency and a comprehensive ecosystem. Those seeking a diverse range of applications lean towards Ethereum, while those looking for a more established and straightforward digital currency might choose Bitcoin.\n\nWhat problem does Ethereum solve?\n\nEthereum was designed to overcome limitations in earlier cryptocurrencies, primarily regarding flexibility. While Bitcoin introduced the concept of blockchain and decentralized money, Ethereum took it a step further by creating a platform where developers can build and deploy smart contracts and decentralized applications. This means tasks, transactions, and programs can run autonomously without intermediaries, potentially revolutionizing various sectors, from finance and real estate to entertainment and governance.\n\nWill Ethereum overtake Bitcoin?\n\nPredicting the future of the crypto market is challenging due to its volatile nature. While Ethereum brings a lot of functionality to the table with its smart contract capabilities, Bitcoin\u2019s primary value proposition is its status as the original cryptocurrency and its widespread adoption as a store of value. Some experts believe Ethereum\u2018s expansive use cases might give it an edge in the long run, a concept termed the \u201cflippening,\u201d but it remains speculative. Both cryptocurrencies have their strengths and could coexist, catering to different market segments.\n\nWhat will happen to Ethereum in 2030?\n\nIt is impossible to predict Ethereum\u2019s valuation in 2030. With the incorporation of multiple L2s and sharding, Ethereum\u2019s scalability issues should be solved, potentially making Ethereum more efficient and capable of handling more transactions per second. With favorable regulations, Ethereum should have plenty of use cases.\n\nWhat are the disadvantages of Ethereum?\n\nEthereum\u2019s biggest problem is integrating and deploying all the cool scalability innovations that are happening right now. For example, sharding can be complicated, and integrating it with Ethereum\u2019s chain could have unforeseen consequences."

        "content": "CROWD CONTROL: Ethereum has been so successful in attracting new validators for its proof-of-stake blockchain that the network is now starting to suffer from sprawl. There are nearly 800,000 active validators on the network, up about 41% since April\u2019s \u201cShapella\u201d upgrade, when withdrawals of staked ETH were first allowed, according to a Sept. 14 report by Galaxy Research\u2019s Christine Kim. Based on certain assumptions, the number is on track to hit 1 million by mid-November and 2 million by June 2024. \u201cEthereum is getting close to reaching an unsustainable number of active validators,\u201d Kim wrote. It\u2019s pretty technical, but network \u201clatency\u201d is becoming a key problem, according to the report: There\u2019s been \u201can increasing frequency of block reorgs and missed blocks in the first two slots of an epoch, likely due to increasing latency in attestation aggregation.\u201d Developers have formalized EIP-7514 \u2013 an improvement proposal that would help, at least in the short term, by limiting entries of new validators to 8 per epoch (roughly 12 seconds), down from the current rate of 12. Another major concern from the rapid proliferation of validators, according to the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s Dankrad Feist in a recent post, is that staking is becoming too concentrated in the hands of Lido, the biggest protocol for so-called liquid staking tokens. The plan to reduce the \u201cchurn limit\u201d for new validators could be a stopgap measure for a more \u201celegant\u201d fix down the road, Feist wrote."

        "content": "After countless forum posts and Discord back-and-forths, MakerDAO\u2019s expansive \u201cendgame\u201d plan is finally seeing concrete action.\n\nMaker passed a poll initiating the Spark Lend DeFi protocol on the Gnosis Chain. This sets the stage for the impending launch of its DeFi-focused subDAO. The move is meant as an example for how Spark Lend can proceed after the Maker \u201cendgame\u201d is finalized and the subDAO becomes fully autonomous.\n\nIn preparation for the endgame, MakerDAO has launched a prototypical set of so-called subDAOs meant to govern different aspects of the DAO. SparkDAO is Maker\u2019s DeFi subDAO, and its Spark Protocol lending platform has been buoyed by the popularity of sDAI, or savings DAI, a yield-bearing token benefiting from high Treasury returns.\n\nUsers can now access Spark Lend, an Aave fork with similar features, on both Gnosis Chain and Ethereum. While demand grows, Karpatkey \u2014 the treasury manager for Gnosis \u2014 is providing liquidity to the DAI market, essentially acting as a stand-in for Maker until it assumes the operations itself.\n\nThe endgame is largely aimed at reducing DAO governance fatigue, an issue MakerDAO founder Rune Christensen called the \u201ccentral issue\u201d of DAOs on the Unchained podcast this week. For now, the protocol\u2019s governance process remains unchanged, and the passed proposal is headed to a second \u201cexecutive\u201d vote.\n\nMaker subDAOs are meant to be specialized groups who can make decisions quickly. They operate with their own governance tokens and have a reduced number of stakeholders voting on each proposal.\n\nCurrently, Spark and other initial Maker subDAOs lack their own tokens and are not autonomous. While subDAOs could eventually overturn Spark\u2019s work, Phoenix Labs CEO Sam MacPherson believes Spark sets a precedent for future subDAOs. Until SparkDAO governance starts in earnest, Maker\u2019s focus remains on expanding Spark Lend\u2019s deployment.\n\n\u201cOther chains will be putting out proposals, and we\u2019re going to go to all of them is the idea,\u201d MacPherson said.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nA major Ethereum whale transferred nearly $10M worth of ETH to Kraken.\n\nThe wallet\u2019s current ETH stash is worth approximately $466 million.\n\nThe whale originally received 254,908 ETH in 2014 during Ethereum\u2019s early days when each coin was valued at $40.\n\nA sizable number of cryptocurrency assets have been transferred to the cryptocurrency trading site Kraken by one of the largest ETH whales.\n\nA whale deposited 6,000 $ETH ($9.96M) into #Kraken 50 minutes ago. This whale is an Ethereum ICO participant, receiving 254,908 $ETH ($422.6M currently), the ETH ICO price is ~$0.31.https://t.co/f0Ob9tqPqc pic.twitter.com/n3aj96tA31 \u2014 Lookonchain (@lookonchain) September 18, 2023\n\nThe whale bought 254,908 ETH at Ethereum\u2019s 2014 initial coin offering (ICO), when the second-largest cryptocurrency asset was only worth $0.31.\n\nSince ETH is currently trading at $1,632, the value of the cache of 6,000 ETH increased by an astounding 531,360% while it was in the whale\u2019s care for nine years.\n\nAccumulating Over $80M in ETH at Cost of $2.80\n\nAccording to blockchain-tracking firm Etherscan , the wealthy investor spent $2.80 to complete the hefty ETH deposit.\n\nAs per Etherscan data , the whale still owns more than 49,070 ETH, which is equivalent to $80.7 million.\n\nThe wallet has repeatedly received tiny amounts of Ethereum over the last nine years, indicating possible dusting attacks. In these attacks, scammers and hackers send small cryptocurrency amounts (known as \u201cdust\u201d) to numerous wallets, aiming to compromise the privacy of the wallet owners.\n\nAccording to the crypto analytics firm Santiment , significant Ethereum holdings behaved bearishly in the second and third quarters of this year.\n\nThe company explained that the price of ETH is currently around one-third of what it was 22 months ago, however, following a sharp decline and the slaughter that was 2022 (in particular).\n\nThe project garnered media attention around a year ago during the highly anticipated merger, which successfully achieved reduced energy consumption and improved scalability.\n\nHowever, due to the asset\u2019s lack of significant price movement, traders have gradually lost interest in it over the past year, in contrast to other major cryptocurrencies.\n\nHope At The End Of the Road\n\nSantiment remains optimistic about the project\u2019s viability despite its current value. However, the metrics show a significant decline in utility for Vitalik Buterin\u2019s initiative, with both on-chain transaction activity and trade volume sharply decreasing since their peak in early November last year.\n\nAccording to the Santiment\u2019s report , all of this is a sign of the audience simply losing interest at a time when many traders are unsure whether the $1,650 price level is overvalued or undervalued, however, it is not necessarily a warning sign for any asset.\n\nIf ETH drops to such a low level, we\u2019ve seen significant psychological support around the $1,500 mark. Therefore, if and when this scenario unfolds, expect a notable increase in trading volume.\n\nMonitoring the behavior of significant players, both whales and the general crowd, is crucial. We\u2019ve seen a supply dump lasting about four months from addresses holding 10 to 10,000 ETH.\n\nThese prominent investors did accumulate significantly towards the end of last year. However, once the price reached a one-year high of around $2,120, they began taking profits rapidly.\n\nThe ongoing decrease in the Ethereum supply held by large investors, such as whales and sharks, is a trend worth watching. While price increases may still occur as these investors cash in, their actions don\u2019t necessarily indicate an immediate return to the $2,000+ range.\n\nLastly, for those concerned about Ethereum\u2019s role in the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem, it\u2019s important to note that the development activity led by the ETH team remains robust and active, concludes Santiment."

        "content": "Major cryptocurrency investment firm Grayscale has finally mad the decision to abandon all the rights to the post-Merge proof-of-work (PoW) Ethereum tokens (ETHPoW).\n\nAnnouncing the news on Sept. 18, Grayscale said that the firm has \u201cirrevocably abandoned\u201d all the rights to ETHPoW tokens on behalf of the record date shareholders of each product.\n\nAfter a thorough review, Grayscale determined that the ETHPoW tokens have not developed meaningful liquidity, while the products\u2019 custodian doesn\u2019t support such tokens. The firm wrote:\n\n\u201cAs such, it is not possible to exercise the rights to acquire and sell the ETHPoW tokens, and on behalf of the record date shareholders, Grayscale is abandoning the rights to these assets.\u201d\n\nGrayscale\u2019s decision to drop the rights for ETHPoW tokens comes more than a year after the Ethereum Merge, an event that marked Ethereum\u2019s full transition from PoW to proof-of-stake (PoS). The Merge occurred on Sept. 15, 2022, forking the Ethereum blockchain into main PoS-based Ethereum and minor PoW-based Ethereum.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Merge, Grayscale was considering whether the company should acquire EthereumPoW and sell ETHW on behalf of the record date shareholders. 180 days after the Merge, the company took another six months to make a decision on whether to acquire those PoW tokens, citing uncertainty regarding the support of ETHW tokens by digital asset custodians and trading venues.\n\nRelated: Ethereum Merge anniversary \u2014 99% energy drop but centralization fears linger\n\nUnlike Grayscale, some cryptocurrency investment firms like ETC Group have attempted to launch dedicated EthereumPoW exchange-traded products (ETPs). ETC Group eventually terminated its PoW-based ZETW ETP just six weeks after the launch, citing the absence of eligible custody providers.\n\nThe news on Grayscale\u2019s ETHW decision came one day before Grayscale proposed to launch a new Ether (ETH) futures exchange-traded fund. The firm filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission to list and trade shares of the Grayscale Ethereum Futures Trust (ETH) ETF under the New York Stock Exchange Arca Rule 8.200-E on Sept. 19."

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nAn almost eight-year-inactive Ethereum ICO participant has sent 32.1 ETH to Coinbase.\n\nWhales in Ethereum sold out their shares. Price impact remained negligible.\n\nGrayscale applied for another ETF, maintaining the strong level of institutional interest in Ethereum.\n\nAfter being dormant for eight years, an inactive Ethereum ICO participant deposited 32.1 ETH to Coinbase wallet.\n\nAn Ethereum ICO participant who has been dormant for 8 years transferred 32.1 $ETH to #Coinbase just now. The address received 200 $ETH at Ethereum Genesis. And the address appears to be related to shemnon.eth (@shemnon ).https://t.co/nj5eF8iRT0 pic.twitter.com/6Viytn4dU5 \u2014 Lookonchain (@lookonchain) September 20, 2023\n\nThis specific Ethereum address was a part of Ethereum Genesis and was initially been given 200 ETH. It looks to be connected to shemnon.eth (@shemnon).\n\nThe unexpected action has sparked attention and speculations among cryptocurrency enthusiasts, especially in light of Ethereum\u2019s notable value growth since its launch.\n\nRecent Signs Of Early ETH Whales Migrating\n\nAfter years of inactivity, a number of Ethereum addresses related to the platform\u2019s initial coin offering (ICO) have recently displayed activity.\n\nJust recently, a major Ethereum whale transferred nearly $10M worth of ETH to Kraken while in July, an Ethereum ICO participant resumed activity after an eight-year break by depositing a sizable 61,216 ETH, or around $116 million, into the Kraken cryptocurrency market.\n\nAnother long-inactive wallet transferred 641 ETH and started staking in a second incident that coincided with Ethereum\u2019s ninth birthday, amounting to a transaction value of almost $1.19 million.\n\nSuch transactions are notable not only for their quantity, but also for the large gains that these early Ethereum supporters have experienced.\n\nEarly adopters have seen exponential growth in their investments considering that the price of Ethereum during its initial coin offering (ICO) was around $0.31 per ETH and that it currently trades for around $1,623.\n\nPotential Justifications For the Actions\n\nThere are concerns regarding the motivations behind these transfers due to the unexpected migration of substantial quantities of Ethereum from wallets that have been dormant for years.\n\nSome have theorised that the original holders may be collecting profits or diversifying their assets in light of Ethereum\u2019s spectacular price increase over the years.\n\nOthers could think that these changes are a result of Ethereum staking, which is becoming more and more popular and enables holders to receive incentives for helping to protect the network.\n\nEffects on ETH\n\nThe price of ETH, which was trading at $1,630 at the time of writing, nevertheless remained largely constant despite these significant changes.\n\nThis steadiness demonstrated the altcoin\u2019s adaptability as a market that took these sizable transactions in stride without seeing appreciable price changes.\n\nHowever, these behaviours by ICO participants may cause FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt) among bitcoin enthusiasts. Concerns about market manipulation or negative sentiment might arise when investors carry on large transactions on exchanges.\n\nInstitutional Enthusiasm Remains High\n\nIt\u2019s interesting to see that institutional interest in Ethereum has not decreased. A well-known cryptocurrency investing company called Grayscale recently applied for a new Ethereum futures exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nGrayscale had previously filed a registration for the same investment vehicle under different regulatory legislation; therefore, this action startled many in the cryptocurrency community.\n\nThe company\u2019s latest filing under the Securities Act of 1933 could be viewed as a backup plan in the event that the SEC rejects its initial proposal for an ETH futures ETF.\n\nIf no regulatory authorities object, the initial ETF proposal should go live in October. Grayscale has shown significant belief in the long-term potential of cryptocurrency, despite short-term market changes, by taking the initiative to develop an Ethereum-focused ETF."

        "content": "On the back of its partial victory against the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Grayscale has applied to the Commission for another Ethereum Futures Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF).\n\nWhy Another ETH Futures ETF?\n\nAccording to a report by the Wall Street Journal (WSJ), Grayscale Investments filed this application on September 20. This development may come as a surprise to many, considering that the asset manager had filed an earlier application to offer this same investment vehicle. As such, this will represent its third application (Grayscale withdrew its first application due to SEC concerns before filing another one in July).\n\nThere is, however, a distinction between both applications, as WSJ noted. The latest application is filed under the Securities Act of 1933, a regulation under which spot Bitcoin ETFs like BlackRock\u2019s filed. Meanwhile, the initial application was filed under the Investment Company Act of 1940, a regulation which securities-based ETFs are registered under.\n\nWhile the exact reason for Grayscale\u2019s action remains unknown, it may be a contingency plan in case the SEC denies its initial proposed Ethereum futures ETF, which is expected to launch in October, barring any denial.\n\nGrayscale\u2019s filing under the Securities Act of 1933 isn\u2019t the first, as Brazilian investment firm Hashdex filed its Ethereum ETF application under that Act. Last week, Hashdex applied with the SEC to offer a fund that will hold both Ether futures contracts and a Spot Ethereum ETF (the first of its kind).\n\nThe firm justified this move by stating that a combination of both markets will help mitigate the risk of market manipulation.\n\nHashdex\u2019s application has been singled out for how distinct it is from other applications. The investment firm has proposed to use the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) to track the price of Ethereum and also plans to buy the Ether, which the fund will hold from the CME Market\u2019s Exchange for Physical (EFP) transactions.\n\nETH price holding above $1,600 support | source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nEthereum Futures ETF Imminent?\n\nSeveral Ethereum futures ETFs are expected to hit the market in October, barring a denial by the SEC. Rule 485(a) of the SEC Rules allows these ETFs to launch 75 days from their respective filing dates if the SEC doesn\u2019t deny them before then.\n\nIn line with this, the ETFs of fund managers like Volatility Shares, Bitwise, VanEck, ProShares, and Roundhill will be the first to launch if they receive approval from the SEC.\n\nVolatility Shares was the first among them to apply to offer Ethereum futures ETF. As such, it will gain the first-mover advantage, carrying a possible October 12 launch date, with others coming after. However, this is subject to any decision by the SEC.\n\nThe SEC approving an Ethereum ETF will be a historical event that is expected to give the crypto market a much-needed boost as the bear market continues to linger. There are already forecasts that ETH\u2019s price could rise above $2,000 when these funds launch.\n\nFeatured image from Analytics Insight, chart from Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Best Place to Stake Ethereum: The Top 5 Best Places to Earn Staking Rewards with Ethereum\n\nCryptocurrency staking has become an increasingly popular way for individuals to earn passive income by holding and locking their tokens in a wallet. With the recent Shanghai upgrade and the introduction of Ethereum 2.0, Ethereum staking has gained significant attention in the crypto space.\n\nIn this guide, we will explore the top 5 places where you can earn staking rewards with Ethereum and become your validator.\n\nWhether you\u2019re a seasoned crypto enthusiast or new to the staking world, this article will provide valuable insights and step-by-step guidance to help you make informed decisions.\n\nAlso read: BRICS Influence in the Oil Sector Grows, Puts US Dollar in Danger\n\nSource: CNN\n\nWhat is cryptocurrency staking?\n\nCryptocurrency staking is when individuals hold and lock a certain amount of cryptocurrency in a wallet for a predetermined period.\n\nBy doing so, they contribute to the network\u2019s stability and security and, in return, earn staking rewards in the form of additional native cryptocurrency.\n\nAlso, staking is particularly popular in Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain networks, where staking is used to secure the network rather than rely on miners, as seen in Proof-of-Work (PoW) blockchains.\n\nFurthermore, the amount of cryptocurrency that can be staked and the staking period vary depending on the specific cryptocurrency and its protocols.\n\nAlso, some protocols allow staking with a few coins, while others require a larger minimum stake. Ethereum, with its recent upgrade to Ethereum 2.0, has introduced staking as a way to validate transactions and earn rewards.\n\nAlso read: BRICS Influence in the Oil Sector Grows, Puts US Dollar in Danger\n\nBenefits of Staking\n\nStaking offers several benefits to cryptocurrency holders, making it an attractive option for earning passive income. These benefits include:\n\nPassive Income: Staking allows individuals to earn passive income by simply holding and locking their crypto coins in a wallet. The additional coins earned through staking can be cashed out or used for other purposes. Increased Network Stability: By keeping their deposits on the blockchain, stakers inject liquidity into the platform, contributing to smoother operations and better network stability. Reduced Supply: Staking can help reduce the circulating supply of a particular cryptocurrency by locking coins in a wallet, which can potentially increase its value. Lower Transaction Fees: Some blockchain networks use staking to process transactions more efficiently, resulting in lower transaction fees for users. Increased Governance and Security: Stakers in certain blockchain networks can participate in the network\u2019s decision-making process, giving them voting rights and contributing to the platform\u2019s governance and security. No Specialized Hardware Required: Unlike mining, staking does not require specialized hardware, making it accessible to a wider range of users.\n\nWhile staking offers numerous benefits, it\u2019s also important to consider the potential disadvantages.\n\nDisadvantages of Staking\n\nStaking also comes with its share of disadvantages, which should be taken into account before engaging in the process:\n\nLocked Funds: Staking locks your funds for a specific period, making them inaccessible. If you require immediate access to your funds, staking may not suit you. Risk of Loss: There is always the risk of losing some or all of the staked funds if the network fails or if there is a hack or attack on the blockchain network. Potential for Lower Returns: Staking returns can vary depending on the cryptocurrency and network performance. Lower demand for the cryptocurrency or network inefficiencies can result in lower stakeholder returns. Centralization: Some protocols and cryptocurrencies may require a higher minimum stake, leading to the centralization of staking power among small individuals or entities. Regulatory Risks: Staking may be subject to regulatory scrutiny in certain jurisdictions, potentially causing legal issues for stakers.\n\nDespite drawbacks, staking can be rewarding, especially with Ethereum.\n\nSource: CNBC\n\nWhy Should You Stake Your ETH?\n\nEthereum, as one of the oldest and most established blockchain networks, offers several compelling reasons why you should consider staking your ETH:\n\nEstablished Network: Ethereum has a large and active community of developers and users, providing stability and security to stakeholders. Large Market Cap: With a significant market capitalization, Ethereum\u2019s popularity and liquidity make it an ideal cryptocurrency for staking and receiving rewards. Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Ecosystem: Ethereum has a thriving DeFi ecosystem, allowing for a wide range of financial applications to be built on top of the network. This provides numerous opportunities for stakeholders to earn rewards and participate in the network\u2019s growth.\n\nWith these advantages, staking your ETH can be a strategic move to earn passive income and contribute to the Ethereum network.\n\nHow Can You Stake ETH?\n\nThere are several ways to stake Ethereum and start earning staking rewards. Here are three main methods:\n\nBecome an ETH Validator: This is the most direct method of staking ETH but also the most challenging. To become a validator, you must hold 32 ETH and run a validator node with a 24/7 internet connection. Use a Staking Pool: Staking pools collect resources from different account holders and pool them into nodes.\n\n\n\nYou can stake smaller amounts and earn rewards by joining a staking pool. Staking pools also offer liquidity through intermediary tokens, allowing you to withdraw your funds anytime. Use a Centralized Exchange: Many centralized exchanges now offer staking services for Ethereum. All you need is a wallet for the exchange and a payment method. This method is the easiest way to stake ETH, but it may have some limitations or fees imposed by the exchange.\n\nYou grasp the basics. Ethereum\u2019s appeal is clear. Explore the top 5 places for Ethereum staking rewards.\n\nTop 5 Places to Earn Staking Rewards with Ethereum\n\nThe world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchange offers Ethereum staking through its staking platform. Binance allows staking in a pool with as little as 0.1 ETH and offers a \u201cFlexible Lock\u201d option, allowing you to redeem your assets at any time.\n\nWhile Binance mandates the 32 ETH requirement for independent validators, it tokenizes BETH as the proof of staked Ethereum in a 1:1 ratio. Binance does not charge staking fees, making it an attractive option for staking your ETH.\n\n2. Coinbase\n\nThis leading cryptocurrency exchange provides an easy-to-use platform for staking Ethereum.\n\nCoinbase has no staking minimums for ETH, but they charge a 25% commission on staking rewards, which is higher than other options.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that staking ETH on Coinbase may have geographical restrictions, and you may not be able to stake if you live outside the United States.\n\n3. Kraken\n\nSource: Reuters\n\nKraken, a regulated crypto exchange, has expanded into several international markets and offers Ethereum staking.\n\nAdditionally, you can buy and sell a wide range of cryptocurrencies on Kraken, including staking Ethereum. Kraken allows you to join a staking pool with as little as 0.0001 ETH, making it far more affordable for newcomers or users with a small crypto budget.\n\nKraken charges a 15% administrative fee for staking Ethereum, which is withdrawn from your reward earnings.\n\n4. Rocket Pool\n\nRocket Pool is a decentralized staking platform built on top of the Ethereum network. It offers a unique approach to staking that allows for more flexibility and decentralization.\n\nFurthermore, with Rocket Pool, you can stake ETH as an independent node without having to stake the full 32 ETH. You can also choose to stake in an ETH pool.\n\nRunning a node through Rocket Pool can yield a higher rate of APY. The commission fees on the platform are competitive with other staking options.\n\n5. Lido\n\nLido is a decentralized staking platform that provides a user-friendly and secure way to stake Ethereum. It allows users to stake any amount of Ethereum, regardless of the 32 ETH minimum requirement for independent staking.\n\nAdditionally, Lido achieves this by pooling funds from multiple users and staking them together as a single entity. Users can earn staking rewards and receive a tokenized representation of their stake (stETH), which can be traded, used in DeFi applications, or used as collateral.\n\nThis allows users to enjoy the benefits of staking while maintaining liquidity.\n\nGetting Started with Ethereum Staking\n\nTo get started with Ethereum staking, follow these steps:\n\nChoose a platform: Evaluate the features and offerings of different Ethereum staking platforms and select the one that suits your requirements. Create an account. Sign up for an account on the chosen platform and complete the necessary verification processes.

        "content": "Developers From Prominent Web3 Security Firms Collaborate On Proposal To Make Smart Contract Audit Reports Easily Accessible On-chain\n\nBy: Samuel Haig \u2022 Loading...\n\nDeFi News\n\nEthereum developers have proposed a new smart contract standard intended to help users look up smart contract audits for DeFi protocols.\n\nDevs have been spiritedly debating ERC-7512 since it was first published to the Ethereum Magicians forum by Richard Meissner, the co-founder of Safe, on Sept. 5. Developers representing OtterSec, ChainSecurity, OpenZeppelin, Ackee Blockchain, and Hats Finance also contributed to the proposal.\n\n\u201cThe proposal aims to create a standard for an on-chain representation of audit reports that can be parsed by contracts to extract relevant information about the audits, such as who performed the audits and what standards have been verified,\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cTo provide strong guarantees about security and allow better composability, it is important that it is possible to verify on-chain that a contract has been audited.\u201d\n\nWhile the intent of the proposal has drawn broad support from the community, developers are discussing the finer points of how to implement the standard.\n\n\u201cThe idea of having on-chain audits is useful,\u201d replied Dexara, the founder of Callisto Network. \u201cHowever, the implementation proposed in this ERC is overcomplicated significantly.\u201d\n\nDexara and others suggest utilizing a registry to organize audits in the form of non-transferable Soulbound Tokens as an alternative to developing a new Ethereum standard. Meissner responded that the proposed ERC could be used in the context of a registry, but warned that solely relying on a registry offers \u201ca very centralized approach.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis ERC focuses on standardizing what auditors should sign, rather than defining the registry,\u201d added Shay Zluf. \u201cThe goal is to ensure consistent verification across the ecosystem.\u201d\n\nMeissner also noted that while security audits are useful, they do not guarantee that a protocol\u2019s code is impenetrable.\n\nFor example, the highly-anticipated launch of BANANA, the token for a Telegram trading bot, ended in tears hours after its deployment when a bug was discovered in the smart contract, despite the team claiming its code underwent two audits.\n\nHowever, Twitter user punk9059 ran BANANA\u2019s code through the popular AI chatbot, ChatGPT, which immediately identified the problem."

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s price may have been dealt a massive blow as a research report on the Ethereum valuation has revealed that the cryptocurrency giant has been trading below its fair price.\n\nEthereum Trading Value Slips\n\nA new on-chain research report has delved deep into the fair value of the Ethereum cryptocurrency since its inception, segregating the cryptocurrency\u2019s value into sections and utilizing its trading activities and active addresses to evaluate the network\u2019s worth over the past years.\n\nLewis Harland, an RxR analyst, revealed in the research report that Ethereum has been trading below fair value by a 27% discount. The analyst arrived at this conclusion after employing the Metcalfe law-centric valuation model which involves comparing active user base on Ethereum\u2019s robust scaling networks and active user adoption to measure the network\u2019s fair value.\n\nHarland explained that Ethereum\u2019s network valuation can be measured and tracked slightly more accurately when the active user base of the blockchain\u2019s scaling networks is integrated into the model. He stated that if the model excludes active user bases, then Ether\u2019s (ETH) valuation would be trading significantly below its fair value of $275 billion.\n\n\u201cEthereum\u2019s network valuation tracks the updated ML index better when the active user base of Ethereum\u2019s scaling networks is factored into the model than when omitted,\u201d Harland, stated in the research report.\n\nHe added that \u201cthe updated model, which does factor in these networks, puts ETH\u2019s valuation at $275 billion (current MCAP trading at a 27% discount), assuming no further user growth in perpetuity.\u201d\n\nGoing by Harland\u2019s research, Ethereum should be trading at around $2,300 with a market cap of $275 billion. However, Ethereum\u2019s price is currently sitting at $1,637 with a market capitalization of $197.62 billion.\n\nAnalyst says ETH price is sitting 27% below fair value | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nEthereum\u2019s Worth Revealed Through Value Layers\n\nWhile exploring the decline in Ethereum\u2019s trading value, RxR disclosed its analysis of Ethereum\u2019s supposed value using value layers. The research firm explained that Ethereum\u2019s commodity value layer can be analyzed through the amount of ETH millions of users utilize to facilitate their crypto transactions daily.\n\nIt further stated that the annual run rate of the transaction fees is well over $1.6 billion presently. It also described Ethereum\u2019s equity value, stating that \u201cthe value of ETH is the present-day value of the sum of all of its future cash flows. To date, over 3.5m ETH ($5.8B) has been burned by EIP-1559.\u201d\n\nLastly, the research firm represented Ethereum\u2019s network value layer, and the analysis utilized Metcalfe\u2019s law approach to conclude the recent data that revealed that the Ethereum blockchain network was trading below fair value.\n\nEthereum\u2019s price has been dealing with a series of strong declines that may push the growth of the ecosystem back a few years. The tenacity of the cryptocurrency\u2019s native token Ether (ETH) was tested when it fell to a critical support level of $1,530 earlier in September. However, the cryptocurrency later made a slight recovery which pushed it back to a more stable position.\n\nFeatured image from Analytics Insight, chart from Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

A recent report shows that the SEC would allow the first ETFs based on Ether futures, inducing hype into the Ethereum market.\n\nGrayscale Advisors \u2013 which manage the ETF . are referred to as the \u201csponsor\u201d in the company\u2019s filing, as the proposal is pursuant to the provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and rule change submitted by NYSE to the SEC.\n\n\u201cThe Sponsor is in the process of becoming registered as a commodity pool operator with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and is in the process of becoming a member of the National Futures Association,\u201d reads Grayscale\u2019s filing.\n\nThe document also mentions that The Grayscale Ethereum Futures Trust will keep its holdings in Ether futures contracts with a \u201croughly constant expiration profile,\u201d and that it will \u201cnever carry futures positions all the way to cash settlement.\u201d\n\nThe trust plans to initiate an open position in futures contracts by depositing an initial margin amount.

Grayscale even said it won\u2019t refile its Bitcoin spot ETF application as it sees its current application as sufficient.\n\nAnd, according to an analyst, now is definitely the time to start investing in Ethereum, which is exactly how Grayscale aims to expand its business."

        "content": "Blockchain oracle network Chainlink has tapped into Ethereum layer-2 scaling protocol Arbitrum to drive cross-chain decentralized application development.\n\nThe two protocols announced the mainnet launch of the Chainlink Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) on Arbitrum One on Sept. 21, giving developers access to Chainlink\u2019s solution, which taps into Arbitrum\u2019s high-throughput, low-cost scaling.\n\nThe combination of CCIP and Arbitrum One\u2019s ecosystem aims to unlock a myriad of use cases, including cross-chain tokenization and collateralization, blockchain gaming, data storage and computation.\n\nChainlink Labs chief business officer Johann Eid commented on the partnership, highlighting Arbitrum\u2019s role in offloading transaction congestion from Ethereum\u2019s base layer and providing a base to build decentralized applications (DApps).\n\n\u201cCCIP now gives these users access to a highly secure and easy-to-use interoperability protocol built on Chainlink\u2019s time-tested infrastructure, powering cross-chain smart contracts in a way that will open up new avenues of growth, accessibility, and innovation.\u201d\n\nThe integration will marry Arbitrum\u2019s optimistic rollup technology that currently commands around 60% of total value locked in the wider Ethereum layer 2 ecosystem. Arbitrum facilitates fast, low-fee transactions that are batched off-chain and then submitted to Ethereum\u2019s base layer.\n\nThe optimistic rollup is assumed to be valid until proven otherwise by validators of the network.\n\nMeanwhile, CCIP allows developers to build cross-chain DApps that use arbitrary messaging and simplified token transfers. This taps into Chainlink\u2019s decentralized oracle network that enables smart contracts to securely access off-chain data sources, APIs and payment systems.\n\nRelated: Blockchains need an interoperable standard to evolve, say crypto execs\n\nThe protocol allows smart contracts to interact with real-world data and events, making it possible for them to be triggered by data from external sources.\n\nStarkWare, another prominent Ethereum scaling technology firm, previously tapped into Chainlink\u2019s oracle services. As Cointelegraph previously reported, StarkWare\u2019s zero-knowledge proof rollup protocol StarkNet integrated Chainlink\u2019s data and price feeds for its ecosystem in February 2023.\n\nCollect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space.\n\nMagazine: NFT collapse and monster egos feature in new Murakami exhibition"

        "content": "According to a recent analysis by top crypto market watcher Dark Defender, XRP sets sail to outperform Ethereum (ETH) by five times.\n\nDark Defender\u2019s latest analysis leverages the Elliott Wave Theory and considers XRP\u2019s price movements against Ethereum on the monthly timeframe. The analysis is a follow-up to his earlier posts on the current situation of the XRP/ETH market.\n\nPrevious Analyses\n\nHis first analysis in this series was in mid-July after XRP rallied to the $0.93 high on the back of the lawsuit victory. Dark Defender confirmed that this XRP price spike allowed the asset to break above a long-standing five-year resistance on the XRP/ETH chart.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe analyst emphasized that XRP had begun flipping Ethereum as he drew five Elliott Waves on the weekly chart. XRP had already completed the first two waves and was on track to complete the third wave, which would see it outperform ETH by a large margin.\n\nHowever, Dark Defender\u2019s second analysis, which came up in August, projected a drop for XRP to see the asset back-test the resistance point it broke in July. XRP underperformed in August, correcting the gains of July 13. Amid this bearish trend, the asset dropped against ETH.\n\nDark Defender noted that XRP would retest the previous resistance point and flip it into support before rallying further. He called attention to a green signal on the chart, asserting that it indicates that XRP would continue to appreciate against ETH in the long term.\n\nXRP to Outperform ETH by 5x\n\nIn the latest analysis, the chartist confirmed that XRP had completed the back-test against ETH. Notably, the asset successfully retested the resistance and turned it into a support point.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nDark Defender believes XRP would now follow the third Elliott Wave, leading to a rapid surge against ETH. According to him, XRP would increase five times more than Ethereum. This would bring the XRP/ETH pair to a value of 0.001764.\n\nThis does not mean XRP will rally five times on its own; it only tells the asset will surge five times more than ETH. If ETH rises 2x, XRP will soar by 10x; if ETH surges 3x, XRP will increase by 15x.\n\nInterestingly, regardless of the rate, should XRP soar five times more than ETH, it would still not overtake ETH in the market cap. A five times increase would take XRP\u2019s market cap from $27.4 billion to $137 billion at $2.5 per XRP. This is still below ETH\u2019s $195 billion valuation."

The filing is distinct from Grayscale\u2019s previous attempts at an Ethereum futures ETF, which it submitted under the Investment Company Act of 1940.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal noted that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has approved a number of Bitcoin futures ETFs under both the 1933 and 1940 Acts. Spot Bitcoin ETFs, none of which have been approved, have been filed under the 1933 Act.\n\nThe fact that the SEC approved certain earlier Bitcoin futures ETFs starting around October 2021 \u2014 combined with more general optimism around cryptocurrency ETFs \u2014 could make Ethereum futures ETFs a viable pursuit for asset managers.\n\nIndeed, multiple asset managers have already jumped on the trend. In recent weeks, Volatility Shares, Bitwise, ProShares, VanEck, Roundhill, and Valkyrie Investments have all applied for Ethereum futures ETFs. The Wall Street Journal identified Hashdex as another applicant; various other firms bring the number of applicants to at least 12.\n\nGrayscale is also pursuing a Bitcoin spot ETF\n\nGrayscale\u2019s attempts to obtain an ETF of any type are especially notable because the firm plans to convert its existing GBTC fund into a spot Bitcoin ETF. Though the SEC initially disapproved Grayscale\u2019s application in 2022, Grayscale gained a partial legal victory in August that will likely force the SEC to review the application.\n\nAs noted by the Wall Street Journal, judges in the D.C. Court of Appeals said that Grayscale\u2019s proposed ETF conversion is \u201cmaterially similar\u201d to other, previously approved Bitcoin futures ETFs \u2014 seemingly a nod in the company\u2019s favor.\n\nBut despite widespread optimism, that ruling will not necessarily require the SEC to approve Grayscale\u2019s proposed ETF. The SEC merely needs to review the application.\n\nOther firms are also pursuing Bitcoin spot ETFs closely modeled on a much-hyped application filed by BlackRock in June. Grayscale\u2019s own spot Bitcoin ETF application precedes and differs from BlackRock\u2019s application as it concerns an existing fund."

        "content": "Crypto analyst Benjamin Cowen is saying that Ethereum (ETH) is likely to significantly underperform Bitcoin (BTC) over the near term.\n\nCowen tells his 787,000 YouTube subscribers that a severe plunge by the Ethereum/Bitcoin (ETH/BTC) pair could mark the end of the downward movement of altcoin prices.\n\n\u201cI myself will flip bullish on the Ether/Bitcoin pair. it\u2019s just that at this phase of the cycle I think it\u2019s more likely to keep going down than to go up in the short term. That\u2019s my view\u2026\n\nWhen I look at this chart, it simply looks like there\u2019s a much more likely chance that it breaks to the downside\u2026\n\nAt some point in this fade, we likely get a more significant move to the downside to mark the end of the altcoin reckoning.\u201d\n\nAccording to the widely followed crypto analyst, if the ETH/BTC pair mimics the price action demonstrated during the 2018/2019 bear market, it could plunge by around 35% from its 2022 low.\n\n\u201cJust for the record 35% below that wick [2022 low] would put you at around 0.03200000 BTC.\n\nI think there\u2019s still reason to believe that something like that could happen, that the Ether/Bitcoin pair could see a significant sell-off into the end of the year where it completely takes out this wick [0.04908000 BTC] and a lot of people might think that that wick is going to be the low.

        "content": "As Ethereum (ETH) begins to reverse its gains, initiated by the cryptocurrency market recovery earlier this week, data suggests that dollar-cost averaging (DCA) by investing $100 per week in 2023 would not have been a profitable strategy for the second-largest cryptocurrency so far.\n\nSpecifically, DCA is a method that includes spreading out investments by buying at intervals and in roughly equal cash amounts, regardless of the price. It is popular among newcomers as it tries to minimize the impact of volatility and psychology on the overall investment, as opposed to timing the market.\n\nDCA-ing Ethereum\n\nHowever, despite these advantages, DCA has its shortcomings, as it relies on the notion that prices will, ultimately, always rise, but when this is not the case, such a strategy cannot protect the investor from declining market prices, as is evident in the case of Ethereum.\n\nIndeed, using this method on Ethereum in 2023, i.e., purchasing $100 worth of ETH each week since January 1, 2023, the $3,800 investment (38 weeks) would today be worth $3,618.97, or 4.76% less than the amount invested, according to the most recent data retrieved from cryptoDCA on September 20.\n\nEarlier, crypto analyst Benjamin Cowen shared his own calculations, albeit for the period leading up to August 3, 2023 (31 weeks), which hailed similar results as above, indicating that the investor using the weekly $100 DCA strategy on Ethereum would be at a loss by 4.67%, as he shared in an X post on September 19.\n\nEthereum weekly $100 dollar-cost averaging in 2023. Source: Benjamin Cowen\n\nOn the other hand, using the same method on Bitcoin (BTC), i.e., spending $3,800 over the course of 38 weeks on it, would have brought the participating investor into profit, providing a 5.69% return on investment as of September 19, with a DCA value of $4,016.30, as Finbold reported earlier.\n\nEthereum price analysis\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum was at the time of publication changing hands at the price of $1,627.05, recording a decline of 1.17% in the last 24 hours, a 1.7% gain across the past seven days, and a 2.62% drop during the previous month, as the latest charts suggest.\n\nEthereum 30-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nOn top of that, earlier data has demonstrated that Ethereum had lost $13 billion in net capital last week, according to the breakdown of the market realized value net capital change for the asset shared by crypto trading expert Ali Martinez on September 15, as Finbold reported at the time.\n\nThat said, global blockchain leader at Ernst & Young (EY), Paul Brody, has recently said that \u201cEthereum is going to eat the entire blockchain sector and everything that is not Ethereum will eventually become an Ethereum Layer 2,\u201d while its surge of specialization among key players could assist in possible price growth in the nearer future.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "content": "South Korea\u2019s second-largest city, Busan, is developing a public blockchain network compatible with mainstream blockchain platforms, such as Ethereum and Cosmos. The aim is to integrate blockchain-based services from various blockchain mainnets onto a single platform at the city level and develop Busan into a blockchain city.\n\nBusan City has allocated a 100-billion-Korean-won ($75 million) budget for open blockchain development compatible with global standards under the Blockchain Innovation Fund (BIF). The funds will be raised through investments from public financial institutions in Busan, with nearly 100 private companies showing interest. The BIF is a private fund that supports the development of Busan\u2019s blockchain industry and infrastructure construction, led by financial and public institutions in Busan.\n\nThe public blockchain development is being done under the Busan Digital Asset Exchange Establishment Promotion Plan and Future Schedule plan, with a focus on making Busan a blockchain city.\n\nBusan Blockchain City Development Plan. Source: News1\n\nThe official announcement noted that Busan City has been actively testing various use cases of blockchain technology in its trade-free zone; however, most of these projects were carried out on different blockchains, resulting in an \u201cuncomfortable\u201d experience for businesses. This was one of the key reasons for the city administration to zero in on a public blockchain at the city level that is compatible with global blockchain networks such as Ethereum.\n\nRelated: Coin Center responds to US lawmakers\u2019 request for crypto tax guidance\n\nBusan City is also involved in the process of establishing the Blockchain Trust Framework technology standard conducted by the Korea Internet & Security Agency.\n\nThe project aims to improve the quality of private services and encourage interconnection between services by presenting requirements such as blockchain technical system, performance and security level. The standard will also be utilized for public services within Busan City.\n\nThe long-term blockchain development plan also includes the development of the Busan digital asset exchange in the first half of 2024. The digital exchange will not only list digital assets but also tokenized securities, including precious metals and raw materials, such as gold, copper and oil. In the future, the administration behind the projects aims to tokenize and trade global intellectual property rights and carbon emissions rights.\n\nMagazine: Big Questions: Did the NSA create Bitcoin?"

Meanwhile, if you\u2019re interested in a more macro overview of Ripple\u2019s potential performance during the next bull run, check out our recent video on the matter:\n\nThat said, one well-known analyst is pinning XRP to the second-largest cryptocurrency by means of total market capitalization \u2013 Ethereum (ETH). Back in July, he outlined that XRP was on the verge of breaking a resistance against ETH that was in place since 2018.\n\nNow, the analyst, who goes by the X handle Dark Defender seems to believe that XRP is about to outperform ETH by a factor of 5x.\n\nThe reasoning is that XRP managed to complete a successful backtest of said resistance against Ethereum.\n\nXRP/ETH pair completed the back-test. XRP is expected to appreciate 5 times more than ETH. Watch Ethere. The Misty Pond got a new King.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that XRP outperforming ETH doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that it will flip in terms of price or market capitalization.

        "content": "Qadir Ak is the founder of Coinpedia. He has over a decade of experience writing about technology and has been covering the blockchain and cryptocurrency space since 2010. He has also interviewed a few prominent experts within the cryptocurrency space.\n\nGrayscale recently submitted a new application for an Ethe\u00adreum Futures ETF. Intere\u00adstingly, they submitted it under the Securities Act of 1933, typically used for commoditie\u00ads and Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nThis decision marks a shift from their initial application filed under the Investment Company Act of 1940, which primarily gove\u00adrns securities-based ETFs. Many spe\u00adculate about the underlying re\u00adasons behind this strategic move.\n\nGrayscale\u2019s Second Attempt at Ethereum Futures ETF\n\nGrayscale Inve\u00adstments, a prominent cryptocurrency investment sector player, has again entered the world of Ethereum futures ETFs. Yes, you heard it correctly\u2014their determination remains ste\u00adadfast as they make another atte\u00admpt.\n\nGrayscale has chosen a different regulatory path for its latest application. This time, they have submitted the application under the Securities Act of 1933, deviating from their previous approach.\n\nThe Initial Ethe\u00adreum futures ETF application was built on the foundation of the Investment Company Act of 1940, which serve\u00ads as a common framework for securities-base\u00add ETFs. However, the approach has now shifte\u00add towards aligning with the Securities Act of 1933, typically associate\u00add with commodities and Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nBitcoin futures ETFs have successfully registere\u00add and obtained approval under both regulatory acts. This suggests that this alternative approach may be an effort to enhance the chance\u00ads of approval.\n\nSpeculation Abounds as SEC Approaches Ethereum Futures ETF Approval\n\nThe Securitie\u00ads and Exchange Commission (SEC) is nearing approval for Ethe\u00adreum futures-based e\u00adxchange-traded funds (ETFs). Source\u00ads familiar with the matter further imply that product approval could occur early in October.\n\nThe Se\u00adcurities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is currently re\u00adviewing six applications for Ethereum future\u00ads-based exchange-trade\u00add funds (ETFs). These applications include the Bitwise Ethereum Strate\u00adgy ETF, Roundhill Ether Strategy ETF, VanEck\u2019s Ethere\u00adum Strategy ETF, ProShares Short Ether Strate\u00adgy ETF, and Grayscale Ethereum Future\u00ads ETF. Approval of these ETFs by the SEC seems imminent.\n\nSources sugge\u00adst that approval may be on the horizon, potentially as early as October, despite the SEC\u2019s silence on the matte\u00adr. The intense competition leaves uncertainty about which firms will secure the first approvals."

ETH again climbed above the $1,650 resistance but struggled to clear $1,660, unlike Bitcoin.\n\nThe price made two attempts to gain strength above $1,660 but failed.

And that will make the sequencers much more decentralized, censorship-resistant. But the problem with having a single sequencer on layer 2\u2019s right now is, the single sequencers are not censorship-resistant, right? It's just like, literally a server, and the server can refuse to process your transactions if it wants to. Like, I'm not trying to pick on anyone, like literally all of them are like this, but let's just take like Coinbase or Base as an example. Coinbase is literally running a server that is the sequencer for the Base chain. And if they want to reject your transaction, for whatever reason, they can do that. And, you know, I think they're trying to be as impartial as possible. And that's awesome. But that is not totally decentralized, I may say. And just to prove the point that I kind of understand most of the arguments at least, OK, there's a way to get around the censorship-resistance switches. Effectively, you can go back to layer 1, and send a transaction to layer 1 and be like, Oh, Coinbase, you have to include my transaction now because I went to the layer 1. But that's a terrible product experience, right? Like maybe that works for some edge cases, or if like the less than 1% of the time when, for some random reason somebody's being centralized by a sequencer. But if there's a good amount of opportunity for a sizable amount of the transactions to be censored on a given sequencer, for whatever reason, then this may not be something that you want for your network as much."

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH), a significant player in the crypto space, has recently come under scrutiny due to some concerning on-chain activities.\n\nNotably, the number of addresses holding significant amounts of Ethereum has declined, and some long-term holders appear to be liquidating their positions, potentially posing threats to Ethereum\u2019s value.\n\nWhale Watch: A Steep Decline In Ethereum Holdings\n\nOn-chain analytics have been instrumental in offering real-time insights into crypto market trends. Recent revelations have highlighted a downturn in Ethereum\u2019s holding patterns that might have deeper implications for the digital asset\u2019s value and the market.\n\nAccording to Glassnode, a leading on-chain analytic platform, the number of addresses holding 1,000 Ethereum (ETH) coins or more has plummeted to a 5-year low.\n\nPrecisely, these addresses, often termed \u2018whale addresses\u2019 in the crypto world, have decreased to 6,082. Such a sharp decline can be attributed to the liquidation activities of some of Ethereum\u2019s long-term holders.\n\nIt is worth noting that this contraction in whale holdings could potentially increase the susceptibility of Ethereum to market bears, potentially initiating a downward price trajectory.\n\nThe impact of such sales on the market is apparent. When large quantities of a cryptocurrency, such as Ethereum, are offloaded, it often leads to a considerable influx of selling pressure. This can cause panic among smaller investors, prompting further sales and possibly leading to a price drop.\n\nAdditional Pressures From Dormant Wallets\n\nInterestingly, another layer adds to Ethereum\u2019s selling pressure alongside the decrease in large-scale holdings. According to data from Lookonchain, a renowned on-chain data analysis firm, a dormant Ethereum wallet, untouched for around four years, has suddenly sprung into action.\n\nThe wallet in question liquidated its entire ETH holding, quickly pushing roughly $4.81 million worth of the altcoin into the market.\n\nA wallet that had been dormant for 4 years sold all 2,591 $ETH for $4.18M stablecoins 6 hours ago.https://t.co/et78rXHG5u pic.twitter.com/pJanMLxwA3 \u2014 Lookonchain (@lookonchain) September 20, 2023\n\nSuch unexpected sales from long-inactive wallets could raise alarms in the market. While the exact reasons behind such liquidations often remain concealed, they invariably amplify the selling pressures on the affected cryptocurrency, which, in this case, is Ethereum.\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum\u2019s price has seen a slight bullish trajectory over the past week, up 1.4%. The asset has moved from a low of $1,596 seen last Wednesday to trade above $1,650 on Monday before retracing to $1,626, at the time of writing down by 1.8% in the past 24 hours.\n\nFeatured image from Unpslah, Chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Digital currency investment company Grayscale is the latest firm to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a new Ether (ETH) futures exchange-traded fund (ETF)\n\nOn Sept. 19, Grayscale proposed listing and trading shares of the Grayscale Ethereum Futures Trust ETF under the New York Stock Exchange Arca Rule 8.200-E.\n\nThe proposal is pursuant to the provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and rule change submitted by NYSE to the SEC. The ETF is managed by Grayscale Advisors, also referred to as the \u201csponsor\u201d in the filing.\n\n\u201cThe Sponsor is in the process of becoming registered as a commodity pool operator with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and is in the process of becoming a member of the National Futures Association,\u201d the document reads. It also states that Grayscale Advisors has engaged Videnct Advisory as a subadviser to serve as the trust\u2019s commodity trading adviser.\n\nThe Grayscale Ethereum Futures Trust seeks to maintain its holdings in Ether futures contracts with a \u201croughly constant expiration profile,\u201d the filing reads, adding that it will \u201cnever carry futures positions all the way to cash settlement.\u201d\n\nThe nature of the Ether futures contracts in the ETF will not require the trust to use an Ether custodian, the filing reads, adding:\n\n\u201cThe trust will deposit an initial margin amount to initiate an open position in futures contracts. A margin deposit is like a cash performance bond. It helps assure the trader\u2019s performance of the futures contracts that he or she purchases or sells.\u201d\n\nThe news comes a few weeks after the digital asset management firm Valkyrie also filed for an Ether futures ETF with the SEC in mid-August, following several other firms filing for ETH futures ETFs. On Aug. 17, Bloomberg reported that the SEC was set to allow the first ETFs based on Ether futures, spurring much optimism regarding the Ethereum market.\n\nRelated: Grayscale officially abandons post-Merge PoW Ethereum tokens\n\nLast month, Grayscale scored a major, though partial, victory against the SEC in its efforts to convert its over-the-counter Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into a listed spot Bitcoin ETF. The SEC had rejected its GBTC application, after which Grayscale sued. The appeals court ordered that Grayscale\u2019s petition for review be granted and the SEC\u2019s order to deny the GBTC listing application be vacated. This victory, despite not guaranteeing the eventual listing of a Grayscale spot Bitcoin ETF, was still greeted with enthusiasm by the community.\n\nMagazine: DeFi Dad, Hall of Flame: Ethereum is \u2018woefully undervalued\u2019 but growing more powerful"

Discover SCENE\n\nGrayscale Investments has applied to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for a new crypto exchange-traded fund (ETF). Unlike the flurry of Bitcoin spot ETFs still sitting with the regulator, however, this one would be an Ethereum futures ETF.\n\nPaperwork filed by the firm on Tuesday showed that the fund would \"not transact in Ether and will not be required to retain an Ether custodian\" and instead would deal strictly in futures.\n\nGrayscale's filing comes after the asset manager last month scored a victory Wall Street's biggest regulator when a federal judge decided to overturn the SEC's decision to block Grayscale from converting its Bitcoin trust into a spot ETF.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNow, as Grayscale awaits approval for its Bitcoin ETF, it is hoping an Ethereum futures ETF will get the green light from the SEC.\n\nThe SEC first approved a Bitcoin futures ETF\u2014which allows investors to bet on the future price of digital assets\u2014 in 2021. Such investment vehicles track the price of cryptocurrencies but do not store crypto.\n\nInvestors are really hungry for spot crypto ETFs, and the SEC is currently reviewing a number of such applications\u2014including one from the world's top asset manager, BlackRock.\n\nA crypto ETF would give traditional investors exposure to the asset in a safer way: ETFs are investment vehicles that allow people to buy shares that track the price of an underlying asset, and a Bitcoin ETF would allow investors to invest in the asset without having to worry about storing and protecting their cryptocurrency holdings."

This particular Ethereum address, which appears to be linked to shemnon.eth (@shemnon), was part of the Ethereum Genesis and had initially received 200 ETH.\n\nThe sudden activity has piqued interest and speculation within the cryptocurrency community, particularly given the significant value appreciation of Ethereum since its inception.\n\nRecent stirrings of early ETH whales\n\nOver the past few months, several Ethereum addresses associated with the platform's initial coin offering (ICO) have shown activity after years of inaction. For instance, in July, an Ethereum ICO participant ended an eight-year hiatus, depositing an enormous 61,216 ETH, valued at roughly $116 million, into the cryptocurrency exchange, Kraken.\n\nFurthermore, in a separate incident aligning with Ethereum's eighth anniversary, another long-inactive wallet transferred 641 ETH and began staking, equating to a value of approximately $1.19 million.\n\nSuch transactions draw attention not just because of their substantial size, but due to the significant gains these early Ethereum supporters have seen.\n\nWith Ethereum's ICO price being a mere $0.31 per ETH and its current market price hovering around $1,623, early adopters have witnessed exponential growth in their investments.\n\nPossible reasons behind the moves\n\nThe sudden movement of significant amounts of Ethereum from wallets that have been inactive for years raises questions about the motives behind these transfers. Some might speculate that the original holders, seeing Ethereum's impressive price rally over the years, might be taking profits or diversifying their portfolios. Others might believe these moves could be related to the increasing popularity of Ethereum staking, allowing holders to earn rewards by participating in the network's security."

        "content": "The SVM\u2019s enhanced performance has made it Eclipse\u2019s preferred option over the EVM.\n\nEthereum would provide the support for validation on the network.\n\n\u201cBy boosting others, you will boost yourself. A little competition is a good thing, and severe competition is a blessing.\u201d This quote by Jacob Kindleberger seems to be the path that Solana [SOL] wants to follow based on the latest update provided by a new project.\n\nRead Solana\u2019s [SOL] Price Prediction 2023-2024\n\nSolana for scale, Ethereum for settlement\n\nThe rationale for this conclusion can be found in Eclipse mainnet\u2019s introduction of the Ethereum [ETH] SMV L2. As a modular rollup stack, Eclipse aims to provide settlement, data availability, and high-performance execution for its users.\n\nBecause of this, Solana, which was once dubbed the \u201cEthereum Killer\u201d now has to work in conjunction with Ethereum on Eclipse. According to the Eclipse mainnet disclosure, the SVM, a tag for the Solana Virtual Machine would be the best execution environment for its objective.\n\nIn quick summary, the SVM is the execution infrastructure that enables smart contracts/programs on the network. Unlike the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), the SVM provides enhanced performance than EVM, which is the dominant machine standard in the blockchain industry.\n\nSo, Eclipse mainnet concluded that Solana would be very important in enhancing the speed and scale of the project. With respect to fees, the project noted that Solana was the preferred option, explaining that,\n\n\u201cSolana\u2019s amazing work on local fee markets solves this cross-app state contention. In its current implementation, the scheduler prioritizes transactions without conflicts, allowing conflict-free transactions to go through with lower fees.\u201d\n\nTo back up its decision, Eclipse provided the image below, comparing Solana transfers and swaps with others.\n\nSolana wins this round\n\nHowever, the addition of Solana use cases to the Ethereum L2 does not mean that Ethereum would not play any important role in the overall functioning of the project. According to Eclipse, Ethereum\u2019s security and liquidity would be critical to settlement on the network.\n\nFurthermore, the post mentioned that Ethereum would provide the means of validating bridges using the canonical chain. For context, the canonical chain is the authoritative blockchain after a split or hard fork occurs. Eclipse noted that,\n\n\u201cThis allows our users to gain certain security properties from Ethereum. The bridge will validate all Eclipse transactions, preventing the submission of invalid states.\u201d\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check the SOL Profit Calculator\n\nAdditionally, Eclipse mentioned that it was not entirely ignoring the EVM. But it also noted that a more performant execution like Solana remains important to the project. While admitting its love for Ethereum innovation, Eclipse also hailed the other, saying,"

        "content": "On Sept. 19, Eclipse announced a new L2 architecture, which will leverage the Solana Virtual Machine while operating on Ethereum, hence bringing the advantage of the former\u2019s speed and scale in transaction settlement.\n\nThe newly promoted L2 architecture aims to redefine the scaling world by touching on areas like Ethereum settlement, execution using SVM, availing data with Celestia, and proving using RISC Zero.\n\nBringing SVM Experience to EVM\n\nAs per the press statement, Eclipse\u2019s new L2 architecture will use the Solana Execution environment, hence optimizing parallel execution implementing local fee markets, resulting in a reduction of chain-wide fee hikes caused by high-demand applications. This feature is afforded through Solana\u2019s parallelized runtime, designed to process conflict-free transactions with lower fees.\n\nAdditionally, Eclipse notes that despite leveraging the SVM, its mainnet will be powered by Neon EVM to bring full EVM support. Neon EVM is a smart contract that can be deployed on any SVM-focused chain to operate the EVM. Eclipse believes this will bring full EVM compatibility into Eclipse Mainnet. The press statement said,\n\n\u201cBecause each Neon EVM instance has its own local fee market, apps can just deploy their own contract to attain the benefits of an app chain without fragmenting UX, security, or liquidity.\u201d\n\nEclipse also mentioned using the Solang compiler to enable the \u201ccompilation of Solidity smart contracts code into SVM bytecode.\u201d\n\nMetamask\u2019s newly launched tech, MetaMask Snaps, will reportedly play a key role in onboarding EVM users to the SVM chain, as they will not need to switch wallets.\n\nFurthermore, Eclipse boasts solutions to some of EVM\u2019s state growth limitations. Unlike EVM, Solana does not need constant Merkle Tree updates for each state update. Every transaction can specify all states needed for execution. Hence, state size will not impact SVM execution.\n\nSeeing that this L2 is designed for Ethereum, the settlement of the Eclipse Mainnet will happen on Ethereum, reinforcing the security properties of Ethereum. Its bridge validates all Eclipse transactions, preventing the submission of invalid states while enhancing censorship resistance.\n\nAssets popular with Ethereum, like DeFi, NFTs, and more, will play a significant role in Eclipse Mainnet.\n\nData Availability and Proving\n\nData in this new system will be available only through Celestia, which extends beyond Ethereum\u2019s current bandwidth. Eclipse believes this will result in a higher TPS.\n\nAnother feature of the new mainnet is Proving similar to Anatoly\u2019s SVM fraud-proof SIMD to avoid reintroducing a Merkle tree into the SVM. The executor will post a list of inputs and outputs for every transaction, confirming that the commitment on Ethereum is correct.\n\nEclipse details more in-depth about the new product, which will bring a whole new meaning to the L2 scaling universe, as per the press statement."

        "content": "Tron transactions were five times that of Ethereum.\n\nBoth TVLs increased, but Ethereum maintained the top spot.\n\nThe number of transactions on the Tron [TRX] blockchain surpassed that of Ethereum [ETH] five-fold on 17 September, Tron DAO revealed. The DAO, which got its data from Nansen, showed that Tron\u2019s transactions on the said data were 4.5 million.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s TRX\u2019s market cap in ETH terms\n\nEthereum, on the other hand, registered a total of 880,000 transactions. The disparity in transactions meant that there were more people transacting on the Tron blockchain on 20 September, as compared to Ethereum.\n\nTime for a look at data from @nansen_ai. ? ?\ufe0f As of September 17th, daily transactions for TRON and ETH are as follows: TRON: 4.5M daily transactions\n\nETH: 880K daily transactions Lot's of people are using the TRON network! ? For more data, visit: https://t.co/RNkFqeoApH pic.twitter.com/WHRDEuV6Xk \u2014 TRON DAO (@trondao) September 19, 2023\n\n\u201cFast\u201d is the people\u2019s desire\n\nAlthough both blockchains make use of smart contracts, Tron edges out Ethereum with its vital function in gaming and gambling applications. Besides that, the underlying blockchain of Tron allows for faster transactions than Ethereum.\n\nThis capability is a major reason most stablecoin transactions, especially from Tether [USDT], pass through the TRC-20 token standard than Ethereum\u2019s ERC-20.\n\nFor instance, Tron\u2019s block length and transaction cost allow it to process 2,000 transactions per second. Meanwhile, Ethereum is far behind with higher gas fees and transaction speed that does not supersede the pace of Tron.\n\nAnother reason Tron has been able to beat Ethereum to the higher transaction number is its adoption rate in Asia. To back this up, a Chainalysis report in 2020 referred to East Asia as the world\u2019s biggest stablecoins market.\n\nAt that time, Tether, which is the largest stablecoin per market cap, was also the most used stablecoin in the region. While that has not changed, traders in the region also prefer to employ the TRC-20 model of transacting due to its lightning speed.\n\nAgain, Tron trumps Ethereum\n\nApart from leading Ethereum in terms of transactions, Tron has also been the driving force leading the revival of the DeFi TVL. For the uninitiated, DeFi\u2019s overall TVL has not been performing well over the last few weeks.\n\nThis was evident in the notable decrease in most protocols and chains. However, at press time, almost every chain had recorded a significant increase in TVL, with Tron\u2019s 20.74% increase being the highest in the last seven days\n\nThe TVL is a metric used to measure the total value of assets locked to staked in a particular platform. When the TVL increases, it means the project involved has become more trustworthy.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 TRXs worth today?\n\nHowever, a decrease in the TVL implies that market participants perceive the DeFi platform or dApp to be less trustworthy. Hence, this results in a decrease in smart contracts\u2019 liquidity attached to it.\n\nBut in Tron\u2019s case, its TVL rose to 6.66 billion, while Ethereum had a higher TVL of $21.18 billion. However, the latter only registered a 7.41% increase within the same timeframe, Tron increased by double digits."

The average gas fee at the time was around 10 gwei meaning that Binance spent $840,000 on gas fees in less than a day.\n\nThe crypto exchange ended up paying 530 Ether (ETH), according to a Dune dashboard, on what Scopescan described as consolidation from \u201clong-inactive deposit addresses\u201d by the Binance 14 Ethereum wallet.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/0xScopescan/status/1704799448294175173\n\nMartin K\u00f6ppelmann, co-founder of decentralized protocol Gnosis, seconded the consolidation explanation. Additionally, K\u00f6ppelmann threw color on some technical reasons why Binance transactions resulted in exorbitant gas fees.\n\nGas prices spiking because of a ton of regular ETH transfers related to Binance. They are using a really inefficient script to consolidate funds and are massively overpaying transaction costs. Martin K\u00f6ppelmann, Gnosis co-founder, on X\n\nK\u00f6ppelmann initially surmised that there might be something suspicious about the Binance 14 movements. However, the defi founder noted that big companies like crypto exchanges were prone to inefficiencies and bad engineering.\n\nA similar incident occurred in December 2022, as Coinbase director Conor Grogan pointed out at the time. Gas fees lept over 100 gwei after Binance consolidated $32 million in Tether\u2019s stablecoin USDT from 135,000 addresses.\n\nBinance consolidated around 135K USDT ETH addresses in a few hours. Was such a massive consolidation that total unique wallets holding USDT fell about 3%.\n\n\n\nUsually Binance does sweeps when gas is low. Here, gas spiked to 100+ gwei. My guess is this is ahead of its PoR audits. pic.twitter.com/qFnJDSJnIx \u2014 Conor (@jconorgrogan) December 9, 2022\n\nIn other Binance news, the crypto exchange remains embroiled in legal disputes with U.S. regulators over claims of law violations. Several employees including Brian Shroder, chief executive officer of Binance.US, resigned amid probes from the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nBinance CEO Changpeng \u2018CZ\u2019 Zhao disputed claims that he received a $250 million loan from BAM Management, the entity behind Binance\u2019s American crypto exchange.\n\nYou might also like: Is Binance in trouble?\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

movements of BTC, ETH, and XRP before highlighting an alternative coin that the AI model believes could be primed for significant growth soon.\n\nChatGPT Predicts Over 2x Return for Bitcoin by 2025\n\nFirst up is Bitcoin (BTC) \u2013 the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency, as measured by market cap.\n\nAlthough BTC\u2019s price is still up 59% since the start of the year, it has faced volatility in recent weeks, with several pullbacks testing the commitment of long-term holders.\n\nAt the time of writing, Bitcoin hovers around the $26,450 level, having rejected the support zone at $25,000 on September 12.\n\nInterestingly, ChatGPT predicts Bitcoin could rebound to $32,000 by the end of 2023, citing the pending spot BTC ETF filings as a potential catalyst.\n\nLooking ahead to 2024, if positive momentum continues alongside mainstream adoption, ChatGPT believes Bitcoin could hit $48,000.\n\nFinally, in 2025, assuming consistent growth and a favorable investment climate, ChatGPT speculates that Bitcoin may reach $60,000 \u2013 126% higher than today\u2019s price.\n\nChatGPT Predicts ETH Could Hit $4,500 in the Next Two Years\n\nEthereum (ETH), the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency with a market cap of $189 billion, has also had a rocky few weeks in the market.\n\nLike Bitcoin, Ethereum is up significantly since January 1, yet the token\u2019s price has been highly volatile of late, dropping 22% since mid-July.\n\nThis sustained drop has followed ETH\u2019s latest attempt to break the psychologically important $2,000 level, which hasn\u2019t been breached cleanly since April.\n\nHowever, ChatGPT believes that Ethereum could still climb to approximately $2,200 by the end of the year \u2013 assuming that broader market sentiment turns bullish.\n\nLooking to 2024, continued growth as a major DeFi platform may boost ETH\u2019s value to around $3,300, according to ChatGPT.\n\nBy the end of 2025, assuming sustained adoption and innovation, ChatGPT speculates that ETH could reach a valuation of $4,500 \u2013 187% higher than today\u2019s price.\n\nXRP Could Return to $1.10 by 2025, According to ChatGPT\n\nLastly, XRP (XRP) has had a rollercoaster ride in 2023, primarily due to the highly publicized legal battle with the SEC.\n\nBack in mid-July, Ripple Labs scored a partial victory against the SEC, which sent the XRP price rocketing over 100% in a matter of hours.\n\nUnfortunately, after weeks of speculation, the SEC announced that it plans to appeal the court\u2019s decision \u2013 prompting the XRP price to plummet over the following two months.\n\nAlthough uncertainty around XRP\u2019s prospects remains high, ChatGPT predicts that XRP could be about to rebound and hit $0.68 by the end of 2023.\n\nAdditionally, in 2024, a resolution in Ripple\u2019s favor or broader crypto growth could boost XRP to $0.85, based on ChatGPT\u2019s analysis.\n\nFinally, by the end of 2025, ChatGPT speculates that XRP could rise as high as $1.10, contingent on adoption within traditional financial systems, regulatory clarity, and favorable market conditions.\n\nWhich Other Cryptos is ChatGPT Bullish On?\n\nWhile ChatGPT sees potential in major coins like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP, the AI model is also optimistic about some lesser-known tokens.\n\nOne token that appears to have caught ChatGPT\u2019s eye is Bitcoin BSC \u2013 a Binance Smart Chain project that has raised over $4 million through its presale in just three weeks.\n\nTrending Bitcoin BSC Presale Fuels ChatGPT\u2019s Bullish Price Prediction\n\nBitcoin BSC (BTCBSC) is a stake-to-earn version of Bitcoin that uses the BEP-20 standard, a combination that has yet to be seen in the crypto market.\n\nBTCBSC aims to be a low-cost and scalable alternative to Bitcoin, with the same total supply of 21 million coins and a presale price of just $0.99.\n\nBy holding BTCBSC, investors can earn rewards released every 10 minutes, following the same schedule as Bitcoin\u2019s block rewards.\n\nAs outlined on Bitcoin BSC\u2019s staking dashboard, estimated yields are currently at 127% per year, with over 2 million tokens already staked.\n\nConsidering Bitcoin BSC\u2019s presale started less than three weeks ago, this figure indicates strong early interest from the crypto community.\n\nAdditionally, the presale has already reached its soft cap target of $4 million and is trending towards the $6 million hard cap goal.\n\nThese factors have created a rapidly growing buzz around BTCBSC, with over 7,500 people following the project\u2019s official X (formerly Twitter) account.\n\nGiven this context, ChatGPT predicts that Bitcoin BSC\u2019s powerful presale start and multiple influencer endorsements could push the token\u2019s value to $3.50 by the end of 2023.\n\nLooking ahead to 2024, as BTCBSC\u2019s staking protocol and DeFi integration expand, its price could climb to $7, per ChatGPT\u2019s analysis.\n\nLastly, by 2025, sustained adoption, innovation, staking rewards, and positive market sentiment could help drive BTCBSC to a value of $12 \u2013 a 12x increase from the current presale price.\n\nVisit Bitcoin BSC Presale"

        "title": "How To Buy Bitcoin With MetaMask Wallet - CCN.com",
        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nMetaMask is a self-custody wallet emphasizing internet privacy, consent, and association.\n\nThe MetaMask wallet connects users to the Ethereum blockchain ecosystem.\n\nMetaMask does not facilitate the acquisition of Bitcoin directly; however, it does allow transactions involving Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC).\n\nWBTC, an ERC-20 token, bridges Bitcoin\u2019s value to Ethereum\u2019s decentralized apps.\n\nMetaMask is a leading self-custody wallet made up of a dedicated team of developers and designers. The primary vision of the browser extension, Metamask, is to revolutionize how individuals interact with the internet, emphasizing consent, privacy, and free association. MetaMask is at the forefront of creating a more decentralized and equitable digital landscape.\n\nBeyond merely being a digital wallet, MetaMask acts as a bridge connecting users to the Ethereum blockchain and its vast ecosystem.\n\nPurchasing Bitcoin Via MetaMask\n\nWhile MetaMask primarily supports Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-based currencies, it doesn\u2019t allow direct Bitcoin purchases. Users may, however, exchange Ether (ETH) or other ERC-20 tokens for a Bitcoin-equivalent known as wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC).\n\nWhat Is Wrapped Bitcoin?\n\nShedding light on the innovative spirit of the cryptocurrency world, WBTC emerged in January 2019 as a bridge between Bitcoin and Ethereum\u2019s decentralized applications (DApps). This ERC-20 token, sitting on Ethereum\u2019s infrastructure, mirrors Bitcoin\u2019s value on a one-to-one basis.\n\nPrior to its inception, the utilization of Bitcoin in financial dealings was largely funneled through centralized avenues, centralized exchanges (CEXs). However, WBTC has ushered in a new era where decentralized exchanges (DEXs) facilitate its exchange, and it\u2019s increasingly leveraged as collateral across various financial platforms.\n\nStep-By-Step Guide To Using Metamask: Downloading and Installing the Browser Extension/App\n\nSteps For Users Who Wants To Access MetaMask Via Web Browsers\n\nWebsite navigation: Navigate to the official MetaMask website to ensure you\u2019re accessing the authentic platform.\n\nBrowser selection: Choose the version tailored for your specific browser, be it Chrome, Firefox, Brave , or Edge.\n\nInstallation prompt: Click on the \u201cInstall MetaMask\u201d option to initiate the installation process.\n\nExtension addition: You will be directed to your browser\u2019s extension/add-on page. From there, select \u201cAdd to [Your Browser]\u201d or \u201cInstall\u201d to continue.\n\nSuccessful installation: Post installation, you should easily spot the distinctive fox icon for MetaMask on your browser\u2019s toolbar, indicating a successful setup.\n\nSteps For Users Who Wants To Access MetaMask Via Mobile Devices\n\nApp store navigation: Visit the designated app store for your device, be it the App Store for iOS users or Google Play for those on Android.\n\nSearch function: In the search bar, type \u201cMetaMask\u201d to locate the official app.\n\nApp download: Download and initiate the installation process for the MetaMask application.\n\nSteps To Setting Up A New MetaMask Wallet\n\nApp launch: Tap on the MetaMask icon, recognized by its fox emblem, to open the app.\n\nInitial setup: Start by clicking \u201cGet Started\u201d.\n\nWallet creation: For those unfamiliar with MetaMask, select \u201cCreate a Wallet\u201d.\n\nData collection preference: A prompt regarding data collection may appear. Choose as per your comfort level and proceed.\n\nPassword setup: For your wallet\u2019s security, set a robust password.\n\nRecovery essentials: A \u201cSecret Recovery Phrase\u201d will be presented. Treat this with extreme caution, as it\u2019s crucial for future wallet retrieval.\n\nSteps To Fund Your MetaMask Wallet\n\nThe need for ether: Before delving into WBTC, ensure you have Ether (ETH) in your MetaMask. ETH covers transaction fees (often termed \u201cgas\u201d) and possibly the direct acquisition of WBTC.\n\nAccessing MetaMask: Click the MetaMask extension icon for easy access.\n\nAddress retrieval: To obtain your unique wallet address, click on the account name at the top.\n\nETH transfer: Send ETH to the copied address, either from another wallet or through an exchange.\n\nEngaging with a decentralized exchange (DEX)\n\nDEX choice: Although numerous platforms exist, one may utilize Uniswap for this illustration.\n\nUniswap Website Visit: Access Uniswap\u2019s official website.\n\nInitiating Uniswap: Click either \u201cUse Uniswap\u201d or \u201cLaunch App\u201d.\n\nWallet Connection: If MetaMask doesn\u2019t automatically sync, there should be a clear option allowing you to manually connect.\n\nSteps To Executing The ETH To WBTC Swap\n\nToken selection: The interface will present two dropdown menus. Select ETH in the first and in the second, pinpoint and choose WBTC.\n\nQuantity specification: Input the ETH quantity for swapping or the WBTC amount you\u2019re aiming to obtain.\n\nRate verification: Before proceeding, scrutinize the conversion rate and affirm its acceptability.\n\nInitiating the swap: Click on \u201cSwap\u201d or \u201cExchange\u201d.\n\nConfirmation: A window detailing the transaction, inclusive of gas fees, will emerge. Validate these details.\n\nFinal transaction approval: MetaMask will request a transaction confirmation, where gas fees can also be viewed and adjusted.\n\nAwaiting confirmation: Patiently wait as the Ethereum network validates the transaction. You can monitor this using MetaMask or through Ethereum block explorers like Etherscan.\n\nReviewing Your WBTC assets\n\nAccessing MetaMask: Reopen the MetaMask extension.\n\nWBTC display: If WBTC isn\u2019t visible among your assets, you might need to manually introduce it.\n\nToken inclusion: To add WBTC, click \u201cAdd Token\u201d and locate \u201cWBTC\u201d. Now, your WBTC balance should be evident.\n\nConclusion\n\nMetaMask stands as a tool in the modern digital landscape, underpinned by a vision of decentralization, privacy, and user empowerment. Beyond serving as a mere digital wallet, it provides a seamless conduit to the expansive Ethereum ecosystem, facilitating transactions like the acquisition of Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) \u2014 an innovative bridge linking Bitcoin and Ethereum\u2019s DApps.\n\nWith a user-friendly interface, clear installation guidelines, and a robust security framework, MetaMask is a testament to the evolving synergy between user experience and blockchain technology, ushering in a new era of digital interactions and financial exchanges.\n\nFAQs\n\nWhat is MetaMask?\n\nMetaMask is a renowned self-custody wallet developed by a dedicated team. It aims to transform online interactions, emphasizing consent, privacy, and free association, promoting a decentralized internet landscape.\n\nHow does MetaMask differ from other digital wallets?\n\nBeyond being a digital wallet, MetaMask serves as a gateway to the Ethereum blockchain and its extensive ecosystem, enabling users to explore a variety of decentralized applications and services.\n\nCan I buy Bitcoin directly with MetaMask?\n\nNo, MetaMask primarily supports EVM-based currencies and doesn\u2019t facilitate direct Bitcoin purchases. However, users can exchange Ethereum or other ERC-20 tokens for Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), an equivalent to Bitcoin on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nWhat is Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) and its significance?\n\nWBTC is an ERC-20 token on Ethereum that mirrors Bitcoin\u2019s value 1:1. Launched in January 2019, it enabled Bitcoin\u2019s use on Ethereum\u2019s decentralized applications, expanding Bitcoin\u2019s utility beyond centralized platforms like CEXs."

As veteran tokens like Ethereum and XRP adapt to shifting circumstances, new entrants quietly prepare to make their mark. In this vast ecosystem, understanding the moves of the old guard and the promise of the newcomers is crucial.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead on to explore the present market conditions of two prominent cryptocurrencies, ETH and XRP, and discover a novel contender, currently in its presale stage.\n\nScapesMania supporters can join presale here .\n\nEthereum (ETH) Navigates a Rocky Market Landscape\n\nEthereum, the decentralized platform that introduced smart contracts to the world, is facing some short-term market setbacks. In particular, the currency saw a -1.7% decline over the past month. Yet, looking at its historic journey from an ATL of $0.4209 to its ATH of $4,891.70, Ethereum's capability to overcome challenges and redefine paradigms is evident.\n\nEthereum's vision goes beyond its recent price fluctuations. Yet, the blockchain space is competitive, and emerging platforms offering faster transactions at reduced fees could threaten Ethereum's dominance.\n\nXRP in temporary lull\n\nRipple, often recognized for revolutionizing cross-border payments, is in a state of flux. With a 30-day decline of -7%, market watchers are keenly observing its moves. But diving deep into its history, where it soared from a mere $0.002802 to an ATH of $3.8419, XRP's resilience and potential come to the fore.\n\nRipple's allure stems from its global partnerships and its potential to make cross-border transactions seamless and cost-effective. However, the looming shadow of regulatory challenges and competition from both traditional financial systems and new crypto solutions is undeniable.\n\nScapesMania: Bridging the Gaming and Crypto Worlds\n\nScapesMania is a new game ecosystem that caters to both Web2 players and Web3 enthusiasts. As a gamer, you won\u2019t have to learn a thing about crypto to enjoy your favorite pastime.

        "content": "Press Releases are sponsored content and not a part of Finbold's editorial content. For a full disclaimer, please click here. If you encounter any issues, kindly report them to [email protected]. Crypto assets/products can be highly risky. Never invest unless you\u2019re prepared to lose all the money you invest.\n\nThe crypto market has been rebounding from the crypto winter this year, but it hasn\u2019t been a smooth ride upward for many tokens. Lately, every week of gains seems to be matched by a week of losses.\n\nThat\u2019s been especially true this week for major tokens like Ethereum and Litecoin. Ethereum is down 1.5% in the past 24 hours, eliminating the gains from an otherwise bullish week. Meanwhile, Litecoin is down 4.6%.\n\nThere doesn\u2019t appear to be breaking news or a significant tweet causing the decline in these market dominating tokens. Instead, the root of the slide appears to be a general bearishness about the crypto market over the past day.\n\nSideways Price Movement on the Horizon for Crypto Majors\n\nWhile prices have been hit hard in the past day, the news around crypto majors isn\u2019t all bad. Ethereum is only down 2.50% over the past month and Litecoin is down just 0.3%.\n\nHowever, the horizontal and slightly downward movement shows that a malaise remains that the crypto market is having trouble shaking.\n\nThe industry has been hit hard by rising interest rates, increasing regulatory scrutiny, and continuing fallout from major scandals like the collapse of crypto exchange FTX. Institutional investors remain wary of the crypto market and many firms appear to be sitting on the sidelines, waiting to see what happens next.\n\nThe sideways price trend could remain in place for a while to come. Both Ethereum and Litecoin are sitting in between support and resistance levels, so there isn\u2019t a consolidation happening before a potential breakout.\n\nAs the past month shows, prices are likely to keep oscillating in the absence of a major news event.\n\nBitcoin BSC Bucks Market Trend with $3.6 Million Raised, 92% Sold Out of Presale Soft Cap\n\nAlthough crypto majors are struggling, some emerging crypto tokens are faring better. Bitcoin BSC has raised more than $3.6 million through its ongoing crypto presale and is now 92% sold out of its soft cap.\n\nThe project\u2019s success is thanks in large part to the advantages it delivers over the original Bitcoin. Unlike BTC, which runs on the Bitcoin blockchain, Bitcoin BSC is built on Binance\u2019s BNB Smart Chain.\n\nThe BNB Smart Chain is hundreds of times faster than the Bitcoin blockchain at processing transactions, making it more suitable for DeFi, trading, and more. It\u2019s also far cheaper, enabling investors in Bitcoin BSC to send tokens without paying exorbitant blockchain fees.\n\nThe difference in price could allow Bitcoin BSC to be widely used for everyday peer-to-peer payments\u2014something that Bitcoin has long promised, but never fully achieved.\n\nAnother major benefit to Bitcoin BSC is that investors can stake the $BTCBSC token. This not only helps validate transactions on the network, but also offers stakers a chance to earn additional $BTCBSC.\n\nThe token is designed so that staking rewards are paid out every 10 minutes, on the same schedule as Bitcoin block mining rewards. Nearly 70% of the total token supply is locked for staking rewards, so Bitcoin BSC will pay out rewards until around 2140.\n\nThe amount of $BTCBSC stakers earn is directly proportional to their fraction of tokens in the staking pool. So, early investors can earn huge rewards when the circulating supply of $BTCBSC is still very small.\n\nBitcoin BSC is priced at only $0.99 during the presale, a price Bitcoin last touched in 2011. So, this is a chance to turn back the clock and invest early in a potentially huge cryptocurrency before its price skyrockets.\n\nInvestors have to hurry, though\u2014once Bitcoin BSC reaches its soft cap, the presale could close at any time.\n\nVisit Bitcoin BSC Presale"

        "content": "An Ethereum whale sold the majority of its holdings as large holders showed bearish sentiment.\n\nRegardless, developers continued to make network improvements.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s [BTC] recent price surge above $26,000 had a ripple effect on the Ethereum [ETH] market, driving a positive surge in price. However, whales remained uninterested.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nEthereum whales get cold feet\n\nEthereum whales, who had long held their positions, began to offload their holdings recently. Lookonchain\u2019s data highlighted a wallet that had been dormant for four years, suddenly selling off all 2,591 ETH for a substantial $4.18 million in stablecoins.\n\nA wallet that had been dormant for 4 years sold all 2,591 $ETH for $4.18M stablecoins 6 hours ago.https://t.co/et78rXHG5u pic.twitter.com/pJanMLxwA3 \u2014 Lookonchain (@lookonchain) September 20, 2023\n\nThe trend wasn\u2019t limited to isolated sales. Glassnode\u2019s data revealed a significant reduction in whale holdings. The number of addresses holding more than 1,000 ETH hit a five-year low, with just 6,082 such addresses remaining at press time.\n\nThis indicated a shift in strategy for major ETH holders.\n\nThis sudden shift in whale behavior raised questions about its potential impact on ETH\u2019s price. With large holders selling off, it could lead to downward pressure on ETH.\n\nDevelopers forge ahead\n\nMeanwhile, despite the whale-related concerns, Ethereum developers remained committed to improving the network. In a recent developer call, updates on Ethereum\u2019s Devnet-8, a test network centered around Dencun, were shared.\n\nThis testnet, near finalization, had various client teams, including Prysm, Besu, and Nethermind, actively pushing updates for experimentation.\n\nDevelopers also tackled network challenges head-on. They discussed a proposal to limit Ethereum\u2019s validator sets\u2019 growth rate, initially capping the churn limit at 12 validator entries but later adjusting it to eight.\n\nThis adjustment aimed to forestall potential issues arising from Ethereum\u2019s expanding staking system. With broad developer support, the proposal is set to be included in the upcoming Dencun update, with code finalization in progress.\n\nHow is Ethereum doing?\n\nAt the time of reporting, Ethereum\u2019s price was $1,634.14. However, trading volume had dipped by 16% in the preceding 24 hours, reflecting some uncertainty among traders.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s ETH\u2019s market cap in BTC\u2019s terms\n\nEthereum\u2019s DeFi activity also exhibited signs of a slowdown, particularly in its Total Value Locked (TVL). While Ethereum\u2019s price dynamics and whale activities remained in focus, the DeFi sector witnessed a notable reduction in TVL.\n\nThis indicated changing dynamics in the DeFi landscape that could have negative implications for Ethereum\u2019s role in decentralized finance in the future."

        "content": "Bitcoin and other crypto tokens were trading higher on Wednesday ahead of the Federal Reserve's policy meeting due later today, where the US central bank is expected to make no changes in the interest rates. The ether-to-bitcoin ratio dropped to a 14-month low. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, moved coins to crypto exchanges, possibly as a prelude to selling, said experts.\n\n\n\nBitcoin posted strong gains as the largest crypto token surged more than a per cent, regaining $27,000-levels. However, its largest peer Ethereum, inched up maringally, but did not race-past $1,650-mark. Price action in the altcoins remained on the positive side in the early hours.\n\n\n\nBitcoin is currently trading above the $27,000 mark, and this price surge could be because Japan's leading investment bank, Nomura, is making headlines by introducing a Bitcoin-based fund tailored specifically for institutional investors, said Edul Patel, CEO & Co-founder at Mudrex.\n\n\n\n\"Market sentiments currently range from neutral to bullish as all eyes remain fixed on the forthcoming US Federal Reserve\u2019s FOMC decision regarding federal interest rates.

        "content": "Wormhole has integrated Circle\u2019s Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP), allowing USD Coin (USDC) to be transferred between Ethereum, Avalanche, Arbitrum and Optimism via Wormhole-based bridges, according to a Sept. 20 announcement.\n\nThe new feature is available to end-users via the Portal bridge, and developers can integrate it into their own apps using Wormhole Connect.\n\nPortal USDC bridge. Source: Portal\n\nThe Wormhole team claimed that the new integration will reduce liquidity issues and user confusion. \u201cOn these new and emerging chains, multiple versions of these bridged USDC tokens can exist,\u201d it stated, \u201cwhich can lead to fragmented liquidity, poor pricing, and a confusing experience for users and developers alike.\u201d CCTP will help fix this problem by \u201ccreating a natively cross-chain USDC that can be burned and minted across connected chains,\u201d it stated.\n\nWhen Circle first issued USDC, it was only available on Ethereum. If a user wanted to transfer USDC to another chain, they needed to use a bridge to lock up their native USDC on Ethereum and mint a derivative version on the other chain. However, multiple bridging protocols with various derivative versions of USDC could sometimes cause confusion among end-users.\n\nIn 2021, Circle launched its stablecoin on a second chain, Stellar. It continued to launch on additional chains afterward, bringing the number of compatible networks to 14 as of Sept. 20.\n\nBut for a user to transfer native USDC from one network to another, they still needed to deposit their coins to a Circle partner\u2019s account and then withdraw them to another network using that account. Partially because of this complexity, many users continued to use bridged versions of the coin instead of its native version.\n\nRelated: Stablecoin depegging plagued USDC and DAI more than others: Analysts\n\nOn April 26, Circle launched CCTP, which is a set of smart contracts and an application programming interface (API) that can be used to burn USDC on one chain and have it be re-minted on another chain without the user needing to deposit to a Circle partner account.\n\nAt the time of its launch, CCTP only allowed transfers between Ethereum and Avalanche or vice-versa. Since then, it\u2019s been expanded to support Optimism and Arbitrum networks as well. Circle plans to add additional networks in 2023, according to the protocol\u2019s documents.\n\nThe Sept. 20 announcement states that CCTP has now been integrated into the Wormhole bridge interface, allowing Wormhole users to transfer native USDC between CCTP-supported chains for the first time. These networks currently include Ethereum, Optimism, Avalanche and Arbitrum.\n\nWormhole is not the only bridge that has implemented or intends to integrate with CCTP. Wanchan provides a similar feature, and according to Circle\u2019s April 26 announcement, Celer, Hyperlane, LayerZero and LI.FI have also stated that they intend to implement it soon."

        "content": "Dogecoin Shows Resilience Despite Setback, Ethereum Set to Surpass $2,300, and Tradecurve Markets Unveils Innovative Demo Platform\n\nThe New York Department of Finance Services (DFS) has removed popular digital tokens from the approved greenlist. One of them is Dogecoin (DOGE) and this has worried investors.\n\nAnalysts also project that Ethereum (ETH) could surge above $2,300 by the end of Q4 2023 and provide significant gains.

It\u2019s part of the ongoing VOLT initiative to strengthen oversight in the digital asset sector. However, Dogecoin (DOGE) was removed from the green list. Now, analysts are worried that this could impact how businesses operate in New York and how the future of the Dogecoin crypto will be affected.\n\nHowever, Dogecoin is up 10.2% on the annual chart. In addition, it has fallen under the 200-day average. This could signify that Dogecoin is prepared to continue its value growth. During the past week, the crypto had its low point at $0.060621, with its high point at $0.062816. At this rate, according to the Dogecoin price prediction, analysts project that it will climb to $0.098 by the end of 2023.\n\n>>Register For The Tradecurve Presale<<\n\nEthereum (ETH) to Break past the $1,700 Price Barrier and Surge Above $2,300 by the End of Q4, 2023\n\nThe Ethereum (ETH) crypto is trading at $1,647.49 and has risen by 25.6% in the past year. During the last week alone, the Ethereum price increased by 2.4%. During the previous week, Ethereum stood between $1,583.50 and $1,665.65. This signifies that it broke past the $1,640 price barrier and could soon spike above $2,000.\n\nNow, the $1,700 supply zone appears to be a tough barrier for the crypto over time. The Ethereum price has sealed below this level since the middle of August. Support from the wider market could be required to break past this barrier.\n\nHowever, a drop below the ascending trendline at $1,620 would suggest the inability of buyers to sustain these heights.

        "content": "Thu 21 Sep 2023 \u25aa 3 min of reading \u25aa by Fenelon L.\n\nThe dynamics of the crypto market are often influenced by major transactions. Recently, an investor who participated in Ethereum\u2019s 2014 ICO caused quite a stir by transferring a colossal amount of ETH to Kraken. Should we be concerned?\n\nAn Ethereum whale transfers $9.96 million worth of ETH to Kraken\n\nThe Ethereum universe recently witnessed a major transaction. According to information provided by Lookonchain, an investor who participated in Ethereum\u2019s 2014 ICO transferred 6,000 ETH, valued at $9.96 million, to the Kraken exchange.\n\nThis investor had purchased ETH during the ICO at a modest price of $0.31 per coin. Now, with the current price of Ethereum at $1,647 per unit, their investment has seen a staggering increase of 53,261% over nine years. This phenomenon eloquently illustrates Ethereum\u2019s dynamism and the tremendous potential of cryptocurrencies.\n\nFurthermore, the transaction cost is another aspect worth noting. To move this colossal sum, they only had to pay a modest fee of $2.80, according to data provided by Etherscan.\n\nHowever, despite this substantial transaction, the investor is not running dry. Their wallet still holds a reserve of approximately 49,070 ETH, which is roughly equivalent to $80.7 million.\n\nBearish turn among Ethereum whales\n\nThis financial move should not be viewed in isolation. It is part of a specific context in the crypto market. Santiment, in its recent analyses, points to a trend of selling among large Ethereum holders in recent quarters. Brian Quinlivan of Santiment provides some insights:\n\n\u201cWe have noted a decrease over a period of about 4 months in the holdings of addresses with between 10 and 10,000 ETH. These holders had accumulated heavily at the end of the previous year but have chosen to realize their gains, especially when ETH recently peaked at around $2,120.\u201d\n\nThis transaction to Kraken, carried out by such an iconic player, prompts reflection on the intentions and prospects of large Ethereum holders. While the horizon remains unclear, observers scrutinize every significant move in the crypto world, as it could indicate upcoming trends in the industry.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program!

        "content": "Ethereum price has steadied its bullish outlook this week despite worrying sentiments over a large transfer of the leading smart contracts token to a major exchange. After bagging 3% in gains over the last week, ETH trades at $1,634 on Wednesday.\n\nThe crypto market, which has surprisingly sustained a positive outlook, with Bitcoin soaring by 5% to trade at $27,156, is awaiting for the decision on the September monetary policy from the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting.\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum and Bitcoin have covered considerable upside ground since the release of the United States Consumer Price Index (CPI) a week ago, which revealed that inflation was still an issue.\n\nAn interest rate hike is the most likely option as the Federal Reserve seeks to curb the skyrocketing inflation mainly caused by a persistent increase in global crude oil prices.\n\nOn the other hand, the crypto market has over the last few months shown commendable resilience against interest rate hikes. Hence, investors are likely to keep a positive outlook regardless of the outcome of the FOMC meeting.\n\nThe Odds Of Ethereum Price Rallying To $3,325\n\nEthereum price bulls face one crucial stumbling block between $1,650 and$1,700. A successful break and hold would confirm the breakout to $1,800 and subsequently trigger a buying spree due to an enhanced market structure for gains past $2,000.\n\nAccording to the weekly chart, ETH now sits on top of one of the bullish market indicators; the 200-weekly Exponential Moving Average (EMA) (purple) at $1,626. Every time Ethereum price breaks above this level, a rally ensues before profit-booking activities dampen the uptrend.\n\nTraders must, however, realize that the 200-weekly EMA is not enough to launch Ethereum price into the anticipated rally. Therefore, it must be a collective effort among the bulls to defend the support at $1,600 and push for the repossession of the 21-weekly EMA (red) and the 100-weekly EMA (blue).\n\nWith all three moving averages serving as support, bulls will have a chance to push for a larger breakout above a forming ascending triangle pattern.\n\nA breakout from this pattern would occur after ETH price pushes above resistance at $2,100. It would be accompanied by a spike in volume, calling for buy orders placed above the resistance.\n\nThe breakout target, 58% to $3,325 is the distance equivalent to the height of the triangle extrapolated above the breakout point.\n\nSome traders may want to confirm the rally with a buy signal from the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator. Such a call manifests with the blue MACD line crossing above the red signal line and the momentum indicator generally slopes upward.\n\nLarge Holders Send ETH To Exchanges\n\nOn-chain transaction trackers have revealed a trend where whales aka large holders are sending large amounts of ETH to exchanges. Ethereum worth roughly $60 million has made it from rather dormant wallets to exchange platforms amid fears of the impact the transfers may have on the price.\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin is reported to have transferred 300 ETH worth approximately $492,000 to the Kraken exchange on Tuesday. Although this single transaction might not impact ETH price, it has spurred discussions among enthusiasts, considering Buterin\u2019s position in the community.\n\nAnother notable transfer worth around $50 million was deposited to several exchanges including OKX, Binance, and KuCoin over the last five days, according to the blockchain data tracker Lookonchain.\n\nA whale that had been dormant for 2 years woke up 4 days ago and transferred 10K $ETH ($16.5M) out. Then deposited 10K $ETH($16.5M) to #Binance, #OKX and #KuCoin via 3 addresses in the past 4 days. And the whale transferred 10K $ETH ($16.5M) out again just now. pic.twitter.com/YhuIJegPtv \u2014 Lookonchain (@lookonchain) September 19, 2023\n\nThat\u2019s not all, there was another transaction worth $10 million to Kraken by a crypto wallet that participated in the protocol\u2019s ICO 9 years ago.\n\nA whale deposited 6,000 $ETH ($9.96M) into #Kraken 50 minutes ago. This whale is an Ethereum ICO participant, receiving 254,908 $ETH($422.6M currently), the ETH ICO price is ~$0.31.https://t.co/f0Ob9tqPqc pic.twitter.com/n3aj96tA31 \u2014 Lookonchain (@lookonchain) September 18, 2023\n\nTransfers to exchanges often mean that investors are getting ready to sell, which explains the spike in speculation over the recent whale transfers.\n\nRelated Articles"

        "content": "Grayscale Investments recently submitted an application to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a novel cryptocurrency exchange-traded fund (ETF). This ETF, unlike the numerous Bitcoin spot ETFs awaiting approval, focuses on Ethereum futures. The company's filing, disclosed on a Tuesday, outlined that the fund would exclusively trade in futures and would not engage in Ether transactions or necessitate an Ether custodian, as reported by the Wall Street Journal.\n\nGrayscale's submission follows a favourable ruling obtained last month, where a federal judge overturned the SEC's previous decision blocking Grayscale from transforming its Bitcoin trust into a spot ETF, marking a triumph against the primary Wall Street regulator.\n\nAnticipating approval for its Bitcoin ETF, Grayscale is now seeking the SEC's endorsement for an Ethereum futures ETF.\n\nALSO READ: Bitcoin ETF: What Is It? Here\u2019s How It Lead To Recent Crypto Rally\n\nIn 2021, the SEC initially sanctioned a Bitcoin futures ETF, enabling investors to speculate on the future prices of digital assets. These investment products mirror cryptocurrency prices but don't involve direct crypto storage.\n\nThe investment community is keenly interested in spot crypto ETFs, with the SEC currently evaluating multiple applications, including one from BlackRock, the world's leading asset manager.\n\nA crypto ETF would offer conventional investors a safer way to gain exposure to this asset class. ETFs are investment instruments that permit individuals to purchase shares mirroring the underlying asset's price. A Bitcoin ETF would facilitate investment in the asset without the need to manage and secure cryptocurrency holdings.\n\nDisclaimer: Crypto products and NFTs are unregulated and can be highly risky.

        "content": "Grayscale, a leading cryptocurrency investment firm, has revealed its decision to relinquish all rights to the Ethereum tokens known as ETHPoW, which are associated with the post-merge proof-of-work (PoW) protocol. Effective from the record date of September 18, Grayscale permanently forfeited all rights to ETHPoW tokens on behalf of its shareholders.\n\nFollowing a thorough evaluation, Grayscale determined that these tokens lacked sufficient liquidity and lacked support from the custodian of the products. As a result, they stated, \u201cexercising the rights to acquire and sell the ETHPoW tokens was deemed impractical,\u201d and on behalf of the shareholders as of the record date, Grayscale is renouncing these rights to the assets.\n\nGrayscale\u2019s decision to relinquish rights for ETHPoW tokens comes just over a year after the Ethereum Merge, which shook up the Ethereum ecosystem on September 15, 2022. This transformative event marked a clear shift from the traditional proof-of-work (PoW) to the proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. As a result, the Ethereum blockchain underwent a division, paving the way for the main PoS-based Ether and the secondary PoW-based EthereumPoW (ETHW) tokens.\n\nIn contrast to Grayscale, some cryptocurrency investment firms, like ETC Group, attempted to introduce specialized exchange-traded products (ETPs) based on Ethereum\u2019s Proof of Work (PoW) system. However, ETC Group decided to discontinue its PoW-based ZETW ETP just six weeks after its launch, citing a lack of suitable custody providers as the reason.\n\nThe news of Grayscale\u2019s decision regarding ETHW came a day before they announced their intention to launch a new Ether (ETH) futures exchange-traded fund, with the ticker symbol ETH.\n\nOn September 19, the firm filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission to seek approval for listing and trading shares of the Grayscale Ethereum Futures Trust (ETH) ETF on the New York Stock Exchange under Arca Rule 8.200-E.\n\nRead more:\n\nAavegotchi unveils game center: a hub for Gotchi gaming\n\nFTX sues Sam Bankman-fried\u2019s parents for mishandling millions"

        "content": "The long-awaited approval of a Bitcoin ETF in the United States could have far-reaching implications for the cryptocurrency market. While Bitcoin undoubtedly takes center stage, the ripple effect of such approval could extend to other cryptocurrencies. Ethereum (ETH), Shiba Inu (SHIB) and the promising newcomer, Kangamoon (KANG) \u2013 may also experience significant surges.\n\nSummary\n\nShiba Inu positions itself for strong growth\n\nEthereum price prediction\n\nKangamoon projected to dominate the P2E NFT gaming market\n\nDon\u2019t Miss Out On The Kangamoon (KANG) Presale \u2013 Reserve Your Spot!\n\nShiba Inu (SHIB): Strong Growth Potential\n\nShiba Inu (SHIB) has made waves with its charismatic branding and an ever-growing community of supporters.\n\nThe approval of a Bitcoin ETF could further legitimize cryptocurrencies in the eyes of institutional investors and the general public. As a result, the broader crypto market, including meme coins like Shiba Inu, might experience increased attention and investment.\n\nThe strong community backing and exciting developments, such as Shibaswap 2.0 and the TREAT reward token, position the Shiba Inu coin for potential growth. Not only that, experts remain bullish for the Shiba Inu coin. In fact, they forecast that the Shiba Inu price will sit between $0.00000946 and $0.00001078 within Q4 of 2023.\n\nEthereum (ETH): A Crypto Giant\n\nEthereum (ETH) has always been pivotal in the crypto ecosystem. If a Bitcoin ETF gains approval, it could set a precedent for further cryptocurrency ETFs, potentially including Ethereum.\n\nEthereum\u2019s significance lies in its smart contract capabilities and vast ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps). An ETF approval could bring fresh investment into the Ethereum network, supporting its ongoing upgrades. Thus driving further Ethereum adoption.\n\nRegarding Ethereum price predictions, market analysts forecast that the value will surge to $2,335.71 by the end of 2023.\n\nKangamoon (KANG): A Meme Coin With a Unique Twist\n\nKangamoon (KANG) will be a newcomer who brings an innovative twist to meme coins. This upcoming project aims to merge gaming and cryptocurrency, offering a unique play-to-earn experience. If a Bitcoin ETF receives the green light, it could surge Kangamoon interest as well.\n\nIt takes its inspiration from the world of memes and infuses it with the adrenaline-pumping world of boxing. At the heart of this crypto sensation is Kangamoon, a spirited kangaroo with an insatiable passion for boxing. Taking on the role of Kangamoon, players embark on an all-immersive journey where they can fight with players from all over the globe.\n\nWhat sets Kangamoon apart is its commitment to the play-to-earn concept. In the Kangamoon gaming universe, players can earn virtual currency and rare in-game items through their skills and dedication. Winning matches and participating in special events are all avenues to accumulating rewards, which can be sold or traded on its marketplace.\n\nIn sum, Kangamoon will be fresh air in the crypto space. Currently, one KANG native token costs only $0.005. Unlike Shiba Inu and Ethereum, KANG taps into the gaming market (seeing $200B in yearly revenue as per Newzoo). Thus, its long-term growth potential is outstanding. As a result, market analysts predict a 22x value growth before its presale finishes.\n\nDiscover the Exciting Opportunities of the Kangamoon (KANG) Presale Today!\n\nWebsite: https://Kangamoon.com/\n\nJoin Our Telegram Community: https://t.me/Kangamoonofficial\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "Grayscale Investments, the world\u2019s largest digital currency asset manager, announced its decision to relinquish all rights to Ethereum\u2018s Proof-of-Work (PoW) tokens, known as ETHPoW. The announcement came on September 18, more than a year after Ethereum\u2019s transition from a PoW to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) system, an event known as the Ethereum Merge. Grayscale cited the lack of meaningful liquidity and custodial support for ETHPoW tokens as the primary reasons for this move.\n\nThe Ethereum Merge, which took place on September 15, 2022, was a significant milestone in the crypto industry. However, it marked Ethereum\u2019s full transition from a PoW to a PoS system, dividing the Ethereum blockchain into a main PoS-based Ether and a minor PoW-based EthereumPoW. Following this event, Grayscale spent an extended period evaluating whether to acquire EthereumPoW tokens on behalf of its record date shareholders.\n\nAfter a year-long deliberation, the firm decided against it, citing uncertainties regarding the support of these tokens by digital asset custodians and trading platforms.\n\nUnlike Grayscale, some investment firms like ETC Group attempted to launch dedicated EthereumPoW exchange-traded products (ETPs). However, these efforts were short-lived. ETC Group terminated its PoW-based ETP just six weeks after its launch due to the absence of eligible custody providers.\n\nThe future of Grayscale and Ethereum\n\nAccording to a Wall Street Journal report, Grayscale\u2019s decision to abandon ETHPoW comes at a time when the firm is reportedly launching a new Ether futures exchange-traded fund. Grayscale\u2019s move to relinquish rights to ETHPoW tokens could be seen as a strategic decision to focus on more promising and supported aspects of the Ethereum ecosystem. The market cap of the old ETHPoW is currently around $140 million, a figure that pales in comparison to Ethereum\u2019s PoS tokens.\n\nGrayscale\u2019s decision to abandon rights to ETHPoW tokens highlights the challenges and uncertainties that investment firms face in the ever-changing world of digital assets. With Ethereum\u2019s transition to a PoS system, the relevance of its older PoW tokens has diminished, leading major investment firms like Grayscale to reevaluate their strategies."

        "title": "Bitcoin OG Proposes Spiderchain: A Game-Changing Sidechain for BTC and Ethereum - Crypto News Flash",
        "content": "Spiderchain offers full Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) equivalence atop Bitcoin\u2019s secure layer without altering its base protocol.\n\nThis Layer 2 design is motivated by the rising demand for enhanced decentralized finance (DeFi) applications on Bitcoin.\n\nUnlocking Bitcoin\u2019s Potential: Introducing Spiderchain\n\nWhile Bitcoin remains the benchmark for cryptocurrency, its ecosystem has yet to capitalize fully on the massive growth of decentralized finance applications, predominantly seen on Ethereum. This discrepancy results in the Total Value Locked (TVL) in Bitcoin\u2019s second layers being less than 0.1% of its market cap. Conversely, the value of Bitcoin wrapped for Ethereum exceeds 2%.\n\nBotanix Labs has unveiled a solution: Spiderchain. This innovative Layer 2 protocol aims to amalgamate Bitcoin\u2019s unparalleled decentralization and security with Ethereum\u2019s dynamic ecosystem and smart contract capabilities.\n\nDiving Deep: Spiderchain\u2019s Unique Attributes\n\nA major differentiator for Spiderchain from other proposals, like drivechains or zero-knowledge rollups, is its capability to seamlessly integrate with Bitcoin without necessitating changes to the base layer protocol.\n\nWhy is this Integration Significant?\n\nEthereum\u2019s prominence in DeFi owes largely to its Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) that facilitates a myriad of applications. Spiderchain aims to tap into this goldmine by offering full EVM equivalence on Bitcoin. This not only introduces Ethereum\u2019s vast capabilities onto Bitcoin but also ensures that Bitcoin remains the secure and decentralized foundation.\n\nUnderstanding the Spiderchain Mechanism\n\nOrchestrators and Multisig Wallets: The Spiderchain protocol functions via a series of multisig wallets steered by Orchestrators. These individuals or entities deposit BTC collateral into these wallets to manage and facilitate the peg-in and peg-out requests. Their role is pivotal to maintaining the network\u2019s integrity by ensuring honest actions and constant activity.\n\nThe Spiderchain protocol functions via a series of multisig wallets steered by Orchestrators. These individuals or entities deposit BTC collateral into these wallets to manage and facilitate the peg-in and peg-out requests. Their role is pivotal to maintaining the network\u2019s integrity by ensuring honest actions and constant activity. Spiderchain Epochs: Spiderchain doesn\u2019t maintain a 1:1 relationship with Bitcoin blocks. Instead, it operates similarly to Ethereum with blocks created every 12 seconds. Whenever a new Bitcoin block emerges, a new epoch is birthed in Spiderchain, establishing finality for preceding transactions.\n\nBalancing Proof of Stake (PoS) with Proof of Work (PoW)\n\nIn the realm of blockchain, PoW is renowned for its security, while PoS offers scalability. Spiderchain, by leveraging Bitcoin\u2019s PoW attributes, aims to balance out the potential vulnerabilities typically associated with PoS, such as centralization or randomized validator selection. It operates on a foundational belief: as long as the honest Orchestrators outnumber adversarial ones by two-thirds or more, the protocol remains secure.\n\nSecurity at Spiderchain\u2019s Core\n\nThe meticulous design of Spiderchain ensures optimal security. For instance, funds are spread across numerous multisig wallets, negating significant losses in the rare event of a security breach. Various factors, such as the stake provided by Orchestrators or the total Bitcoin locked in Spiderchain, dictate its security levels.\n\nHowever, like any system, Spiderchain\u2019s security depends on some assumptions, notably:\n\nNo individual or entity controls over 50% of the staked funds.\n\nNo single multisig in Spiderchain contains a malicious or non-responding quorum exceeding 33%.\n\nAs the crypto world continues to evolve, the integration of Bitcoin\u2018s robustness with Ethereum\u2019s versatility through Spiderchain stands as a testament to the potential of blockchain technology, paving the way for a more integrated and holistic financial future."

        "title": "Developer Leverages ChatGP4 and AI for Autonomous Token deployment on Ethereum - Cryptopolitan",
        "content": "In a remarkable display of ingenuity and technological prowess, a developer has achieved an unprecedented feat by harnessing the power of ChatGP4 and AI to autonomously launch an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain. This groundbreaking endeavor not only pushes the boundaries of what AI can achieve in the world of blockchain technology but also opens up exciting possibilities for the future.\n\nThe integration of AI and blockchain\n\nIn a compelling fusion of artificial intelligence and blockchain technology, the developer embarked on a journey to explore the capabilities of ChatGP4 in conjunction with Ethereum\u2019s smart contracts. While it might seem improbable for an AI to directly deploy a token on the Ethereum network, the developer discovered a clever workaround using OpenAI\u2019s API. By integrating ChatGP4 into custom-built applications and connecting them to Ethereum via hardhat, the project gained the direction it needed.\n\nLeveraging the OpenAI API, the developer created a script that instructed ChatGP4 to initiate the creation of an ERC-20 token. This script, seamlessly connected to Ethereum, automated the token deployment process. With several hundred lines of code, the project started to take shape, marking a significant milestone in AI-driven blockchain innovation.\n\nThe core functionality of the script revolves around ChatGP4\u2019s ability to generate an ERC-20 token using Open Zeppelin standards. Parameters such as the token name and other essential details were passed to the script via values provided by ChatGP4 in the code\u2019s constructor. This laid the foundation for a truly AI-driven token creation process.\n\nTo further enhance the AI\u2019s involvement, the script introduced JSON objects named \u201cdataSupply\u201d and \u201cdataName.\u201d These objects initiated conversations with ChatGP4 to determine the desired token supply and name. The name generated by ChatGP4 was stored in a variable called \u201cnameGivenByAI,\u201d which played a pivotal role in the subsequent stages of token creation.\n\nBut the project didn\u2019t stop there. ChatGP4 was tasked with crafting a short description for the token, utilizing the \u201cdescriptionGivenByAI\u201d variable. This is where the involvement of another AI model, DALL-E, came into play. ChatGP4 fed its description to DALL-E, which generated end-to-end images based on the token\u2019s name. The results were promising but required further refinement.\n\nTo enhance ChatGP4\u2019s responses, the developer sought to provide it with a deeper understanding of the cryptocurrency landscape without introducing human bias. The solution came in the form of data, as the developer created a Dune Query to compile data on the top 10,000 traded tokens on Uniswap. A Python script cross-referenced these tokens with their market capitalization data from sources like CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko. By integrating this data into the AI\u2019s prompts, the quality of responses improved significantly.\n\nWith these adjustments, GPT-4 demonstrated a more profound understanding of crypto culture and offered more creative responses, bringing the project closer to its goal of autonomous ERC-20 token deployment.\n\nAddressing the human elements in autonomous token deployment\n\nWhile the project showcased remarkable progress in AI-driven token creation, it still faced a few lingering human elements. Questions arose regarding ownership of the private keys and contract ownership, which the developer ingeniously addressed with a simple yet effective solution.\n\nUpon deploying the contract, ownership was immediately revoked, ensuring that no human entity retained control over the token. Also, the developer took a bold step by adding 100% of the tokens alongside 2 ETH to liquidity on Uniswap upon creation. This move not only emphasized the project\u2019s commitment to autonomy but also introduced the token to the broader crypto community.\n\nIn total, the script comprised 876 lines of code, showcasing the complexity and sophistication of AI-driven token deployment. With this groundbreaking project, the developer has ushered in a new era where autonomous code and AI can collaborate to create and deploy ERC-20 tokens.\n\nAs the script was executed, it unveiled \u201cAstroPepeX\u201d ($APX), marking a significant milestone in AI-driven token creation.\n\nThe developer\u2019s innovative approach received praise from the crypto community, with one user commenting,\n\n\u201cAwesome read man and a job well done. \ud83e\udd1d We\u2019re only beginning to scratch the surface of what AI can do, and I\u2019m all here for it. Looking forward to the developments of the future and seeing how crypto/blockchain can integrate alongside it.\u201d\n\nThis remarkable project from the developer @CroissantEth highlights the immense potential of AI in the blockchain space. It demonstrates that with the right tools and creative thinking, AI can autonomously create and deploy tokens, pushing the boundaries of what\u2019s possible at the intersection of AI and blockchain technology. The open-sourcing of the project\u2019s code invites further exploration and innovation in this exciting field."

        "title": "BitTorrent crypto vs. Ethereum: Which will dominate the decentralized world? - CryptoNewsZ",
        "content": "This article will analyze the main competitors competing for supremacy in the decentralized tech universe, BitTorrent Crypto and Ethereum. We will be appraising these networks in terms of characteristics, expansiveness, and capability for innovation. Both structures are open-source and have a considerable following.\n\nTheir distinctiveness generates unparalleled prospects for companies seeking to utilize these potent technologies in new territories or augment current ones. They offer contrasting solutions concerning data security, tokenization, intelligent contracts, and other decisive facets of blockchain technology that must be considered when selecting a platform for conducting business operations.\n\nUltimately, companies must decide whether they prefer non-fungible tokens or native digital assets for their products.\n\nExploring BitTorrent\n\nBitTorrent Crypto (New) is a decentralized, P2P computer network protocol that enables users to exchange digital resources from one user to another. It operates based on blockchain technology; the distributed ledger system catalogs and monitors digital currency transactions with extreme security and precision.\n\nThe BitTorrent Crypto (New) platform facilitates quicker transactions than most popular cryptos, such as Bitcoin or Ethereum. This latest development allows Lightning Network micro-transactions, facilitating prompt payments much more minuscule than traditional Bitcoin transfers.\n\nThe service does not require any miner fees or supplementary costs of transaction administration \u2013 thereby nullifying the need for costly mining resources typically demanded of regular cryptocurrency networks like Sterlingcoin or TokenPay Networking Protocols.\n\nUnderstanding Ethereum\n\nEthereum 2.0 is an Ethereum blockchain upgrade that claims to increase scalability and performance throughout the whole network significantly.\n\nThe upgrade brought many significant changes, including the move from a Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus process to a new PoS algorithm dubbed Casper, the introduction of sharding to increase transaction speed, and the implementation of new security features such as data availability checks and cryptographic accumulators.\n\nThese modifications have potentially expanded Ethereum\u2019s capabilities on numerous layers significantly.\n\nBitTorrent V/S Ethereum: The Future Outlook\n\nAccording to professional studies, BTT has bright future potential largely because of its foundation in the most recent decentralized blockchain technology. On January 18, 2022, BTT achieved its greatest value of $0.000003054; on June 20, 2023, it reached its lowest value of $0.0000004568.\n\nBTT\u2019s performance has been largely consistent since the beginning of this year, with a few sporadic drops. For instance, BTT was selling for about $0.0000007708 on February 21. But soon after, it saw a decline and fell to a low of $0.000000466. The present price changes indicate that traders are now balancing optimism and prudence.\n\nAnticipations for 2023 forecast a towering high of BitTorrent at a cost of $0.00000101. BitTorrent coin future for 2025 asserts that the token could hover between $0.00000109 and $0.00000157 with an assumed worth of $0.00000133. Buoyed predictions for the forthcoming years show the value of BitTorrent could capriciously range between $0.00000381 and $0.00000549 by the year 2030.\n\nWhile Ethereum predictions anticipate that the token might close the year 2023 at around $3,904, at the same time, by the year 2025, it might have an average price of $5,561, and in 2030, the ETH token may have reached a maximum value of $20,643.\n\nThe crypto market seems to demonstrate a slight bearishness in sentiment. In the long run, though, projections for both BitTorrent and Ethereum are positive.\n\nPrice Predictions: The Expert Opinion\n\nDoes BitTorrent have a future? Let\u2019s find out what experts have to say:\n\nWallet Investor claims that investing in BTT can be dangerous and would not yield favorable results over a year. Although BitTorrent (New) is currently valued at $0.000000110, there is a chance that your investment will lose value in the future. While their ETH prediction reveals that the token might fall down to $737.47 by 2024.\n\nAccording to Bitnation, BitTorrent (New) may achieve a high price of $0.000001 as the market starts to recover. It is projected to have a minimum value of around $0.000000567 and an average trading price of approximately $0.0000007092. While they anticipate the token to have a maximum value of $6,230.51 by 2025.\n\nMany people hold Justin Sun\u2019s influence responsible for their optimism about the BitTorrent coin future. The BTT price prediction for 2030, according to Price Prediction, indicates that although there could be some short-term effects on the token\u2019s value, bullish momentum will eventually return. This may cause the price to soar to a stunning $0.00003610, causing investors to think about buying more BitTorrent (New).\n\nConclusion\n\nThe confrontation between BitTorrent Crypto and Ethereum will continue in the years ahead as the two platforms vie for supremacy as distributed applications. It is uncertain who will emerge victorious. However, the one that best demonstrates its capabilities regarding cost adequacy, flexibility, protection, and practitioner and user functionality will most likely rule the roost.\n\nAs interoperability attempts advance between these two networks, such as atomic trades, we\u2019ll only observe continuing progress from their conjoint effect on the blockchain domain in the future. Either way, both projects present incredibly optimistic fundamentals for a decentralized future; as a result, financiers must remain aware of which technologies are likely to have the necessary durability or competence they need to select a protocol or token to put money into."

        "title": "Ethereum Price Drops Below Crucial $1,600 Amid Declining Exchange Outflow: Are Bears Gaining Control? - Blockchain Reporter",
        "content": "As anticipated, the Federal Reserve confirmed today that it would keep its primary policy rate unchanged in its economic projections summary. Following this announcement, Ethereum\u2019s price appeared to respond favorably, sustaining its position above $1,600. However, over the last few hours, ETH price failed to maintain its rally above $1,600, dropping below Fib channels amid declining exchange outflows.\n\nEthereum Turns Bearish With Increasing Exchange Reserve\n\nRecent market trends have thrown a curveball: Ethereum\u2019s price has slipped below the pivotal $1,600 threshold. This drop, coupled with a decreasing exchange outflow, raises eyebrows and prompts the question: Are the bears starting to dominate the scene?\n\nAccording to Glassnode, the Ethereum exchange outflow has reached a 1-month low of 6709 ETH, which hints at an increasing exchange reserve. A decreasing outflow means that more Ethereum is finding its way back to exchanges as less amount of ETH is now being withdrawn from exchanges. This increase in exchange reserves suggests that there\u2019s more Ethereum available to be sold, which is typically a bearish sign.\n\nOn the flip side, increasing outflows indicate lower exchange reserves, which is bullish. It suggests that investors are withdrawing ETH from exchanges to cold wallets for accumulation purposes, possibly in anticipation of a price surge.\n\nThe combination of Ethereum\u2019s price drop and the declining exchange outflow paints a concerning picture. It suggests that not only are investors more willing to sell their Ethereum, but there might also be an increasing sentiment of uncertainty or lack of confidence in its short-term price potential.\n\nETH deposits have witnessed a notable surge recently. As of this moment, exchange deposits have surpassed 161,000, reaching a peak not seen in the past nine months. Before this surge, the chart\u2019s previous high was around 98,000 deposits, recorded back in January. This strengthens short-position holders\u2019 confidence.\n\nOver $5.7 Million Long-Positions Liquidated\n\nAfter reaching a high of $1,617, ETH\u2019s price took a downturn, and this decline was accompanied by a significant bearish indicator: a surge in long-liquidations. According to data sourced from Coinglass, a staggering $5.7 million worth of long positions were liquidated in a short span of a few hours.\n\nThis rapid liquidation is a clear sign of increased selling pressure, particularly as ETH approaches its resistance levels near $1,620. For those unfamiliar with the term, long-liquidation essentially means that traders who bet on the price increase had to exit their positions, often at a loss, due to the price moving against their predictions.\n\nThe open interest (OI) for ETH, which represents the total number of outstanding derivative contracts (like futures and options) that have not been settled, has also seen a significant spike. After the ETH price dropped below the $1,610 mark, Coinglass reported a sharp increase in OI by $200 million. An increase in open interest, especially during a price decline, can be interpreted as more traders entering the market, expecting further price drops or hedging against them.\n\nAfter ETH\u2019s price dipped to a low near $1,590, a notable development caught the attention of traders: a positive funding rate for ETH. The funding rate is a crucial metric for derivatives, particularly for perpetual futures contracts. In simple terms, it represents the fee paid by one side of the contract to the other. A positive funding rate means that long traders (those betting on the price to go up) are paying short traders (those betting on the price to go down).\n\nA positive funding rate often indicates that the majority of traders are bullish on the asset, expecting its price to rise. While a positive sentiment is a good sign, it\u2019s essential to note that a persistently high positive funding rate can make it expensive for traders to hold long positions.\n\nIn the short term, a positive funding rate can act as a counterbalance to bearish trends, suggesting that there\u2019s still significant confidence in ETH\u2019s potential to rebound. As of writing, ETH price trades at $1,594, declining over 2.2% from yesterday\u2019s rate."

        "content": "The news is official: Ethereum layer 2 Metis has launched a $5 million crypto incentive program for development on DeFi.\n\nThe Metis Journey has officially started\ud83d\ude80\n\n\n\nA $5,000,000 DeFi Incentive Program in collaboration with blue-chip DeFi dApps, starting off with @AaveAave, on the most scalable and cost-efficient Ethereum Layer 2.https://t.co/RkgrdGjXBU \u2014 Metis\ud83c\udf3f (@MetisDAO) September 19, 2023\n\nThe program is called Metis Journey, and it is designed to enhance new and existing DeFi applications on the Metis network, starting with the blue-chip Aave v3 protocol.\n\nThe Aave Protocol\n\nThe program begins with the strategic allocation of tokens specifically to Aave v3. Specifically, 100,000 METIS tokens will be allocated to incentivize liquidity pools for all assets available to Aave users on Metis, namely ETH, METIS, USDC, USDT, and DAI.\n\nThe goal is to attract a larger user base to the Metis platform, thanks precisely to Aave\u2019s involvement.\n\nAave is currently the third largest DeFi protocol in the world for TVL, with nearly $4.7 billion, enabling it to trail the second largest, Maker, at 4.9.\n\nIts token, AAVE, capitalizes less than $900 million, so only a fraction of the protocol\u2019s total TVL.\n\nAAVE\u2019s market value has risen 16% over the past seven days, but it has not performed particularly well during 2023. Nevertheless, it remains one of the most attractive DeFi tokens.\n\nIn addition to Metis, Aave also uses other Ethereum second layers, such as Polygon, Avalanche, and Optimism.\n\nEthereum: other crypto and DeFi projects in the Metis ecosystem\n\nThe Metis initiative also involves other DeFi projects\n\nFor example involved are Hummus, a combination of single-sided staking pools from Platypus Finance and bespoke pools enabled by Balancer, or Stargate, a cross-chain bridge that facilitates seamless asset transfers to and from the Metis network.\n\nSynapse, a platform offering cross-chain communication and yield farming capabilities, and Unimaia, or an alternative to Uniswap equipped with concentrated liquidity, are also involved.\n\nMetis Journey also extends incentives to regular users who contribute liquidity, engage in trading, and actively participate in the Metis ecosystem.\n\nThe initiative kicks off a series of strategic moves to catalyze exponential growth within the Metis ecosystem and community.\n\nThe MetisDAO token\n\nThe Metis project also has its own MetisDAO token, which, not surprisingly, is now registering +7% in the crypto markets.\n\nActually the bulk of the recent growth started a couple of days ago, so much so that the accumulated gain since Monday has been almost 20%.\n\nHowever compared to 30 days ago it is still down 8%, and the current price of $12 is still 25% lower than it was at the beginning of the year.\n\nThe token was launched in 2021 at the height of the bull run, reaching an all-time high in January 2022 at over $320. Since then it has plummeted to the $10 touched a few days ago, and is now -96% from the highs.\n\nIn such a situation it is more than normal that the project has decided to do something to lift the tokens\u2019 fortunes, and the Metis Journey initiative may have that purpose as well. It is no coincidence that Aave, which is one of the fittest and most widely used DeFi protocols in the world, was chosen as the first beneficiary.\n\nCrypto: the state of DeFi on Ethereum\u2019s L2, Metis\n\nThe bear-market of 2022 did real damage in DeFi, such as the implosion of the Terra/Luna ecosystem in May last year.\n\nIn addition, 2023, unlike the crypto markets, did not see a solid recovery\n\nThe highest ever TVL for the entire DeFi ecosystem was about $175 billion as of November 2021, while 2022 closed at $38 billion.\n\nIn other words, the loss was 78%, which is in line, for example, with the losses cumulated over essentially the same period by the price of Bitcoin or Ethereum.\n\nCurrently, DeFi\u2019s total TVL is only $39 billion, which is about the same as at the beginning of the year, despite the fact that Bitcoin\u2019s price is at +62% and Ethereum\u2019s at +36% instead.\n\nSo 2023 is not a year of revival, but a year of stagnation, which is still better than last year\u2019s bloodbath."

        "title": "Grayscale Investments applies to offer Ethereum Futures ETF - Gizmo Times",
        "content": "Grayscale Investments has applied to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for a new exchange-traded fund, and this time it isn\u2019t for the Bitcoin ETF, but the company has applied for the Ethereum Futures ETF. There have been a lot of Bitcoin spot ETFs that are pending an approval with the regulator, and this adds to the list but it isn\u2019t a spot ETF that has been applied.\n\nThe paperwork of the filing had mentioned that the transactions would not happen in Ether and there won\u2019t be any need to retain any Ether custodian. Instead, the ETH dealing would happen strictly in futures.\n\nGrayscale had earlier applied to convert its Bitcoin trust into a spot ETF, but the SEC had plans against it and the commission blocked it, until the Federal judge decide to overturn that decision. The approval for the Bitcoin spot ETF is yet to happen, but now, Grayscale will have to wait for the Ethereum Futures ETF approval as well.\n\nApplications for Bitcoin ETFs are not new, as the world\u2019s largest asset manager BlackRock had also applied for one and the application is pending review.\n\nAn Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) is a type of investment fund and exchange-traded product, with shares that are tradeable on a stock exchange. ETFs are designed to track the performance of a specific index, commodity, bond, or a basket of assets, and they are structured in a way that combines features of both mutual funds and individual stocks.\n\nETFs offer a convenient way for investors to gain exposure to a diversified portfolio of assets, and this exposure happens in a much safer way. ETFs are transparent, versatile, and cost-efficient, making them a better choice for the retail investors to safely trade the underlying asset without having to buy the asset directly."

        "title": "Eclipse unveils its Ethereum SVM L2 mainnet architecture - NameCoinNews",
        "content": "Eclipse has published details about the architectural structure of Ethereum SVM L2, Eclipse Mainnet. Per those details, the general purpose of L2 brings together the best of the modular stack. Ethereum Mainnet has been defined as the faster L2 solution of Ethereum that is powered by SVM.\n\nThe four elements that it brings together are:\n\nSettlement\n\nExecution\n\nData availability\n\nProving\n\nEclipse will use ETH as the gas token while settling Eclipse into Ethereum. This means that Ethereum will host the validating bridge. Execution will be handled by SVM, which is an acronym for Solana Virtual Machine. Eclipse will run the high-performing SVM as the execution environment. Data will be posted by Eclipse to Celestia. This will ensure scalability in data availability. Finally, Eclipse will deploy RISC Zero for zk proofs of fraud.\n\nOverall, three components are involved in the process, namely Eclipse SVM Mainnet, Celestia, and Ethereum.\n\nThe process begins with Eclipse SVM Mainnet L2 after it commences execution. The block is posted to Celestia, with the commitment being simultaneously posted to Ethereum. Celestia locks data availability, which is then rooted in Ethereum, which serves as a validating bridge and settlement section.\n\nEvery section digs deeper. For instance, Execution goes on to cover Optimized Parallel Execution, Local Fee Markets, and State Growth Management, to mention a few.\n\nAll the components come with benefits to the ecosystem. SVM is a highly performant parallelized VM. Similarly, Celestia has the advantage of DA scaling with DAS light node support.\n\nData availability is one specific section exploring Celestia\u2019s bandwidth and verifiability. Eclipse has said that it will leverage the capabilities of Celestia when it comes to data availability. Their partnership goes back to the time when Celestia was its ecosystem partner. Celestia has been chosen to extend the association as Ethereum currently does not support throughput and fees with its bandwidth.\n\nCelestia is expected to launch 2 MB blocks by the end of 2023. Blobspace will respond to this with an additional 8 MB of support shortly after the launch. DAS light nodes are imperative because they enable verification aspects for users and securely contribute to scalability.\n\nProving resembles Anatoly\u2019s SVM Fraud Proofs SIMD. Eclipse experimented with having Sparse Merkle Tree; however, it was constantly affecting the performance of every transaction that was being done. The final decision was made to fulfill the criteria of input commitment, transaction settlement, and substantial proof that executing a transaction again results in a different output.\n\nFaults that Eclipse Mainnet attempts to avoid are Incorrect Output and Incorrect Input.\n\nEthereum has been mainly chosen for its support of innovation. Moving forward, it plans to take on the aspects of delegation, execution, and innovation. Layer2 solutions can leverage Ethereum\u2019s network\u2019s abilities, including effects and settlement. SVM is expected to remain a standard for a while."
