        "content": "Investing in cryptocurrency and crypto assets is high risk. Don\u2019t invest unless you\u2019re prepared to lose all the money you invest. This is a high-risk investment, and you should not expect to be protected if something goes wrong. Investing in cryptocurrency and crypto assets is high risk. Don\u2019t invest unless you\u2019re prepared to lose all the money you invest. This is a high-risk investment, and you should not expect to be protected if something goes wrong.\n\nEthereum has become a popular cryptocurrency alternative to Bitcoin over the last year. However, unlike Bitcoin and rival currency Litecoin, Ethereum has been adopted by many companies and startups as a way to transact (and more). In the cryptocurrency wars, I like to view Ethereum like the diamond of the currencies - it has both a intrinsic value and an industrial value. Compare this to Bitcoin, which operates like gold - not much industrial value, but people buy it and sell it based on its intrinsic value to the holder. Given the popularity of Ethereum, many people are curious about what it actually is, how it's different than Bitcoin, and how to invest in it. It's also important to note the risks of investing, and the potential to mine it and create your own wealth of Ether (the actual monetary unit of Ethereum). Before we dive in, it's important to note that to look at, use, and transact in Ethereum, you need a digital wallet. We recommend Coinbase because it's free, has a great app, and they give you a bonus of $5 for opening a new account and making your first trade. Check it out.\n\nWhat Is Ethereum Ethereum is basically software that is decentralized and allows developers and programmers to run the code of any application. Wait, what? I thought Ethereum was money... well it has a monetary aspect. You see, Bitcoin uses a technology called blockchain specifically for conducting monetary transaction - it's a straight currency. Ethereum uses blockchain technology to allow the creation of applications that can be executed in the cloud, can be protected from manipulation, and much more (some stuff getting too technical for me here). However, a bi-product of this is that Ethereum uses a token called Ether, which is like Bitcoin, to transact. This is the monetary value portion of Ethereum. Because of its unique abilities, Ethereum has attracted all types of attention - from finance, to real estate, to investors, software developers, hardware manufacturers, and more. Plus, in September 2022, Ethereum converted from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake in an event known as \"The Merge\". This has given even more clout to the blockchain. Ripple is similar to Ethereum in that it's token XRP is also able to conduct real transactions. How Ethereum Is Different From Bitcoin As we mentioned above, Bitcoin was designed to be a currency. It uses the same underlying technology principles, but uses them to facilitate monetary transactions. Ethereum, on the other hand, was designed to facilitate software processing using a token system called Ether. That Ether has become more valuable as a result of people becoming interested in the technology. That Ether is what people want to invest in. However, there are a lot of apps being developed on Ethereum, and even some major financial companies are getting involved in the space. It could be interesting to see what develops from this over the next few years. Ethereum is also the basis for transacting in NFTs and other collectables online. So, if you want to buy an NBA Top Shot or other NFT, you need ETH. Finally, Ethereum is much cheaper than Bitcoin. Bitcoin currently trades for over $20,000 per unit, while Ether trades at closer to $1,000.\n\nHow To Buy Ethereum (ETH) If you're interested in investing in Ethereum, and specifically Ether, you need a digital wallet connected to a cryptocurrency exchange. Ethereum doesn't trade on any major stock platform. You can't go to your online discount broker and buy Ethereum. You have to convert it into your wallet. We recommend using Coinbase as a digital wallet because it's incredibly easy to use, allows you to invest in Bitcoin and Litecoin as well, and they will give you a bonus for signing up. If you sign up with this link you'll get a $5 in Bitcoin bonus if you open a new account and making your first trade. It's important to remember that Ether (ETH) is a currency, and should be treated as such by investors. You don't buy shares of Ether like you would stocks or ETFs. Instead, you are exchanging your dollars for Ether tokens. There are no dividends, no payouts. Your only hope is that in the future, other people on the Internet will pay you more for your tokens than you bought them for.\n\nIf you're not sure about using a digital wallet, and want to invest via an ETF, you can't do it yet. However, there is a Bitcoin ETF - GBTC, and you can invest in it or in Ethereum directly on eToro. You can also buy ethereum on a variety of platforms, including: Uphold\n\n\n\nBinance\n\nKraken\n\nHow To Sell Ethereum And Cash Out Once you own ETH, the selling of ethereum is just like the opposite of buying. You simply place a sell order on the exchange - like Coinase or Binance. It's important to note that you don't have to sell Ethereum and receive cash for it. On many exchanges, you can sell ETH and receive different cryptocurrency or USD. For example, you could sell ETH and receive USDC, USDT, or even BTC. If you are storing your ETH on a cold storage wallet (like a Ledger), you'll need to transfer the ETH back to an exchange to sell. You can use a centralized exchange like Coinbase or Binance, or a decentralized exchange like Sushiswap.\n\n\n\nHow To Transfer And Store ETH Once you buy and invest in Ethereum (ETH), it's a good idea to pull your crypto off the exchange and store it in your own cryptocurrency wallet that you control. There's several reasons for this, and there are some cons as well. Why you might want to store your ETH in your own wallet? Well, for starters, you don't control your private keys if you leave your crypto on an exchange like Coinbase. Furthermore, there are a lot of reports of exchanges banning accounts (without notification), and this could leave you trapped and unable to access your crypto. By moving your cryptocurrency, like Ethereum, to your own wallet, you have full control of your money. However, there is a big con - if you want to buy or sell more, you have an added step of either sending your ETH to an exchange to sell, or when you buy, you need to transfer it to your own wallet (and there could be an associated fee or gas charge with the move). It's up to you whether the added step is worth the security. Check out our list of recommended crypto wallets here."

Its exit leaves only four other major relay players to handle most Ethereum blocks and raises concern of potential problems, ranging from the censorship of transactions to stealing of other key operators\u2019 profits."

        "title": "Looking for the Next Ethereum? 2 Cryptocurrencies to Buy Now - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Since its launch in July 2015, Ethereum (ETH 2.65%) has been one of the best financial assets any investor could have owned, as the token's price has skyrocketed 53,000% over its roughly eight-year history (as of Sept. 27). The road hasn't been a smooth one, as the past couple years have shown, but it's hard to deny the rapid rise of this digital asset.\n\nWhile Ethereum might be on your radar as a potential buying opportunity today, especially since it's currently 67% below its peak price, it's worthwhile to consider two smaller cryptocurrencies to invest in.\n\nThe world's decentralized computer\n\nWhat makes Ethereum different from Bitcoin, the world's oldest and most valuable cryptocurrency network, is that it was the first blockchain to introduce smart contracts. These are software programs that automatically run when the stakeholders satisfy their ends of a particular agreement. Smart contracts are an innovative feature that underpin the promise that cryptocurrency could disrupt numerous industries by eliminating the need for middlemen.\n\nThis adds tremendous functionality to the Ethereum network, leading some to call it the world's biggest decentralized computing platform. In fact, Ethereum has become the undisputed leader in terms of decentralized applications, including for things like non-fungible tokens and decentralized finance protocols.\n\nEthereum's development pipeline is also indicative of the sheer number of computer programmers working on its advancement. An upgrade called the Merge transitioned the network to a proof-of-stake consensus system, which is more energy-efficient and an update that could set the blockchain up for better scalability. There are many more phases left on the horizon.\n\nIt might seem like a no-brainer decision to buy this crypto right now, but investors might want to look at these so-called \"Ethereum killers.\"\n\nThe case for Cardano\n\nAs the seventh-most-valuable cryptocurrency, Cardano (ADA 6.93%) immediately comes to mind as a formidable rival to Ethereum's dominance. Cardano was launched in 2017 by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson, and its token has climbed in value by 874% during that time.\n\nWhat makes Cardano unique is not that it also enables the implementation of smart contracts or that it runs a PoS consensus mechanism, but it's the blockchain's unique development approach. While many cryptos adopt the Silicon Valley mindset of \"go fast and break things,\" Cardano instead emphasizes being cautious and thoughtful when introducing changes to the network.\n\nThe current stage of development is known as Basho, which focuses on things like scaling and interoperability. This is the fourth of five parts, with the last stage focused on governance. Cardano relies on top researchers, computer scientists, and other academics from leading universities across the globe to help push it forward.\n\nCardano already has proven its ability to launch real-world enterprise-level solutions using its innovations. For example, it can better handle KYC/AML checks in the financial services industry. And it can help track supply chains in the agricultural sector.\n\nAs long as Cardano continues making progress on improving the network with new tech features, while also boosting utility in various industry settings, there's certainly the potential for its token to rise in value.\n\nThe case for Solana\n\nSolana (SOL 2.60%) was launched in 2020 by ex-Qualcomm engineer Anatoly Yakovenko. Its token has skyrocketed 1,890% since its founding, a wonderful gain. Currently, Solana carries a market cap of $7.8 billion, making it the ninth-most-valuable cryptocurrency in the world.\n\nLike Ethereum and Cardano, Solana also possesses functionality for smart contracts. And in addition to operating a PoS system, this blockchain also runs something known as proof-of-history (PoH). PoH basically eliminates the need to add timestamps to the data included in blocks, which can speed up transaction throughout. Solana is actually known as being the fastest crypto network, with a theoretical capacity to process 50,000 transactions per second (TPS). For comparison's sake, Ethereum can only handle less than 15 TPS right now.\n\nNaturally, this makes Solana a prime candidate to disrupt one of the most lucrative areas within the overall financial services space, and that's payments. In early 2022, Solana Pay was introduced. This innovative service allows a merchant and consumer to transact with each other directly, with instant settlement and virtually no fees. For businesses that run on thin margins, getting rid of the need to process costly credit card payments can lead to savings that flow straight to the bottom line.\n\nOf course, this puts Solana in direct competition with the likes of Visa and Mastercard. Even so, it's easy to get excited about the potential."

        "content": "Bitwise Asset Management announced the launch of two Ethereum-themed exchange-traded funds (ETFs), joining the growing list of asset managers looking to create Ethereum-based futures products after the SEC greenlit them.\n\nThe two funds will be called the Bitwise Ethereum Strategy ETF (AETH) and the Bitwise Bitcoin and Ether Equal Weight Strategy ETF (BTOP). Bitwise said the launch of these ETFs will facilitate investor access to Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Ether futures and further expand regulated and trusted investment avenues in the crypto sector.\n\nEthereum futures ETFs\n\nBitwise chief investment officer Matt Hougan noted the extensive portfolio opportunity Ethereum offers compared to Bitcoin, describing it as a blend of alternative and conventional growth investment. He added:\n\n\u201cSome investors view Ethereum as an alternative, while others perceive it as a conventional growth investment, encompassing attributes of both.\u201d\n\nThe launch comes as Ethereum continues to establish itself as a nexus of innovation and growth. It brings forth an ecosystem thriving with applications and developments, capturing the attention of millions of users and leading brands.\n\nBitwise CEO Hunter Horsley highlighted Ethereum\u2019s dynamic growth and the momentum it\u2019s gaining and said the ETFs are intended to be a gateway for investors to participate in Ethereum\u2019s expanding landscape through regulated avenues that inspire confidence.\n\nBroader landscape\n\nThe commencement of trading for Bitwise\u2019s ETFs is part of a larger trend, with numerous companies, including Invesco and Valkyrie, exploring Ethereum ETF offerings while awaiting approval for spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nThe decisions by the U.S. SEC on these applications are highly anticipated, with outcomes potentially being influenced by related developments such as the Grayscale lawsuit.\n\nThe crypto community is keenly observing what the SEC does, as approval decisions by the watchdog are poised to shape the trajectory of crypto investments in the U.S. for years to come.\n\nNotably, Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart revealed that nine Ethereum Futures ETFs, including Bitwise\u2019s, are set to receive expedited approval from the SEC for their launch on Monday, October 2, 2023."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nSupply dynamics in Ethereum are constantly being upended amid this year's dizzying drop in DeFi, NFT sales, and meme coin trading.\n\nDepending on which time frame you are looking at, Ethereum can be deflationary or inflationary: on a seven-day model, Ethereum becomes more scarce, whereas on a yearly framework, it issues more than it burns.\n\nWhat\u2019s going on with the network\u2019s supply dynamics, why are transaction fees prices dropping, and how does it look for the future of Ethereum?\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBack in August 2021, Ethereum implemented EIP-1559, which introduced a fee-burning mechanism. Since then, the supply has had a direct connection to gas prices. Higher gas prices mean more ETH getting burned and vice versa.\n\nThis set the table for last year\u2019s merge. The transition from proof-of-work to proof of stake ended up reducing the issuance of ETH by 90%, leading many to claim that the network was now \u201cultrasound money.\u201d\n\nBut that label has been put to the test amid dwindling gas prices and lesser transactional volume.\n\nTransaction fees stand at around $0.28 for sending ETH across the protocol. According to Etherscan data, a trade on Uniswap currently costs $2.76\u2014a far cry from its $4.17 price in early September and a level not seen since the collapse of FTX in late 2022.\n\nAmberdata\u2019s head of research, Chris Martin, told Decrypt that the reasons for declining gas prices are three-fold.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe Ethereum Foundation's focus on scaling with Ethereum 2.0 has had enormous benefits for the network, making it cheaper and more secure,\u201d was his first order of things. Martin then referred to the growth of Layer-2s, elucidating how the increase in these scaling solutions has \u201ctaken a lot of the volume off the mainchain.\u201d\n\nIn third place, said Martin, is the lack of narrative\u2013something the broader crypto market has been grappling with as of late. \u201cThe current market has left many waiting for the next big thing,\u201d he explained, adding that \u201cthere are opportunities, only these are less than in 2021.\u201d\n\nJulio Barragan, the director of education at Blocknative\u2014a Web3 tool that lets users price, preview and monitor transactions\u2014thinks the gas situation is only momentary. He told Decrypt that \u201cas soon as volume picks back up, so will competition for block space, and the network will automatically adjust gas prices accordingly.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s to come, then? For Barragan, it\u2019s a nebulous future.\n\n\u201cPredicting the future of Ethereum gas prices is further complicated by the gradual acceptance of ERC-4337,\u201d he told Decrypt. Also known as account abstraction, the upgrade will look to make crypto wallets as easy to use as email.\n\nBarragan added that it\u2019s unclear what the long-term impact account abstraction and further adoption of layer-2\u2019s will have on gas prices \u201dand therefore supply.\u201d\n\nHe concluded that lower fees can bring more users and activity on-chain, but \u201cmore users ultimately lead to more congestion.\u201d"

All ETF applicants might benefit from it, let alone the Binance (BNB) and Coinbase exchanges.\n\nGrayscale case will have \"ripple effect\" for crypto, lawyer says\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission would face new legal charges \u2014 similar to those it struggled with in the Graysale case \u2014 for denying approval requests for Ethereum futures exchange-traded funds. This forecast was published by top crypto lawyer Mike Selig on his X account yesterday, Sept. 29, 2023.\n\nThe ripple effect of the Grayscale decision is massive. SEC would have faced similar legal challenges for denying ETH futures ETFs. By approving an ETH futures ETF, the SEC effectively concedes ETH is not a security.

This is also crucial in the context of the Ethereum security status debate, he added.\n\nBy approving Ethereum futures ETF, the SEC effectively concedes that Ether, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain and the second-largest digital asset, is not a security.\n\nBesides Ethereum ETF progress, the U.S. Court verdict on the Grayscale v. SEC case will also affect the dynamics of the Coinbase and Binance (BNB) legal dramas.\n\nIn August 2023, a U.S. asset management heavyweight Grayscale scored an epic win over the U.S. SEC. The judge ruled that the SEC failed to provide a sufficient rationale for approving futures products while rejecting Grayscale's spot BTC ETF offering.\n\nNew generation of Ethereum futures ETFs kicks off\n\nAt the same time, the SEC postponed deadlines for all Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs approvals. As of today, Bitwise, Grayscale, 21Shares, Ark, Valkyrie, WisdomTree and other asset managers are waiting for the watchdog's verdicts.\n\nIn the meantime, the firms are launching new exchange-traded funds (ETFs) based on Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) futures. In the last days, Grayscale and Bitwise filed for futures-based ETF products releases.\n\nA new wave of investing products might go live as soon as Monday, Oct. 2, 2023, as covered by U.Today previously."

        "content": "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin published a blog post this week outlining his views on incorporating various ancillary protocols directly into the blockchain\u2019s base layer code.\n\nIn the post, Buterin specifically discussed account abstraction, zero-knowledge EVM engines, private transaction pools, code precompiles, and liquid staking. He favored tightly integrating some protocols, like ERC-4337 account abstraction, but adopting others, like mempools, requires more discretion.\n\nButerin noted that each integration proposal involves balancing centralization risks, development flexibility, and performance advantages. He concluded that protocol changes must evaluate these factors on a case-by-case basis as priorities shift over time.\n\nAlso read: Paradigm Accuses SEC of \u201cCircumventing Rulemaking\u201d in Binance Case\n\nVitalik Buterin raised concerns about liquid staking concentration\n\nThe co-founder also expressed concerns about the concentration of liquid staking in Ethereum\u2019s proof-of-stake model. He highlighted that leading providers Lido and Rocket Pool collectively represent over 32% of the staked ETH supply.\n\nWhile acknowledging safeguards adopted by dominant liquid staking firms, Buterin suggested further decentralization mechanisms could strengthen network security. Rather than relying solely on ethical pressures, he proposed ideas like protocol tweaks to diversify staking participation.\n\nButerin\u2019s viewpoints provide valuable insights into the Ethereum developer community\u2019s assessment of potential upgrades to the network\u2019s architecture. With the vision of decentralization, Buterin seeks to bring in notable alterations to the Ethereum network."

        "content": "September 15 2023 marked exactly one year since the Ethereum blockchain conducted the Merge, whereby becoming a full Proof-of-Stake (PoS) chain.\n\nBefore the transition, Ethereum utilized the same consensus mechanism as Bitcoin, which is called Proof-of-Work (PoW). This mechanism required miners to compete in solving complex mathematical puzzles, and in return for participating in the energy-intensive process, they were rewarded with cryptocurrency tokens.\n\nEnergy Consumption\n\nEthereum\u2019s shift to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) meant that validators, not miners, were required to stake Ethereum as collateral in exchange for network security and rewards. This change aimed to enhance energy efficiency and sustainability.\n\nA report from the Crypto Carbon Ratings Institute indicates that the network\u2019s carbon footprint decreased by 99.99% as a result of this transition.\n\n\"The merge will reduce worldwide electricity consumption by 0.2%\" \u2013 @drakefjustin \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) September 15, 2022\n\nStaked Ethereum\n\nAround 23% of the total $ETH supply is now staked. This puts the total staked at ~27.4 million ETH, equating to ~$45B. h/t @hildobby_ pic.twitter.com/iyadwg46ty \u2014 Binance (@binance) October 8, 2023\n\nSince Ethereum\u2019s PoS transition, the amount of Ethereum staked has nearly doubled. The total amount has grown by 93% to reach 26.5 million Ethereum, which is valued at nearly $43 billion. According to a dashboard on Dune created by Dragonfly Data Scientist, Hildebert Mouli\u00e9, this represents approximately one out of every five Ethereum tokens in circulation.\n\nCentralization\n\nIn the aftermath of the PoS upgrade, concerns about centralization and censorship were raised especially after it emerged that two entities, Lido and Coinbase, controlled 46.15% of validator nodes adding blocks to the Ethereum blockchain just hours after it transitioned to a full Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain.\n\nOne year later, Lido controls about 32% of total staked amount while Coinbase controls 8.3%, with the top ten list dominated by either staking pools or centralized exchanges.\n\nWhile not an exchange, the heavy utilization of Lido, a liquid staking solution, has been identified as a potential vulnerability in Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem in terms of decentralization.\n\nLido Staked Ethereum ($STETH) stands out prominently, boasting a market capitalization of $14 billion, as reported by CoinGecko.\n\nThe second-largest token representing staked Ethereum by market capitalization is Rocket Pool ETH ($RETH), with a market capitalization of $926 million.\n\nIncreased Impact of Scaling Solutions\n\nScaling solutions that seek to address Ethereum\u2019s limitations have also become more impactful, one year since the Merge.\n\nThe average transactions per second (TPS) across all Ethereum layer-2 networks has now exceeded 50, marking a substantial improvement from the previous year. This data, sourced from L2 Beat, reflects the increasing scalability and efficiency of layer-2 solutions on the Ethereum network.\n\nWhen you aggregate the total number of transactions over the past 30 days for popular layer-2 networks like zkSync Era, Optimism, and Arbitrum Nova, the count surpasses 61 million transactions. This figure is twice the number of transactions processed on the Ethereum network during the same time frame.\n\nETHEREUM |#Ethereum L2s are growing so much it doesn\u2019t make sense to build on anything else. pic.twitter.com/cqzyDFYGmJ \u2014 BitKE (@BitcoinKE) September 28, 2023\n\nReduction in Token Supply\n\nAnother notable effect of the Merge on Ethereum is a reduction in the token\u2019s overall supply. The shift in how new Ethereum is issued, along with the burning of transaction fees, has caused a 0.25% decrease in the total amount of Ethereum in circulation, according to sound.money.\n\nThis decrease in supply can impact Ethereum\u2019s overall scarcity and may have implications for its economic dynamics.\n\nPrice of Ethereum\n\nLast but not least, regarding Ethereum\u2019s price, it may seem that not much has changed since September 2022. Around the time of the transition, ETH was trading at approximately $1,600, which is roughly the same price it\u2019s trading at a year later, $1,586.09 at the time of writing.\n\nFollow us on Twitter for the latest posts and updates\n\n_____________________________________________\n\n_____________________________________________"

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nIllustration by Mitchell Preffer for Decrypt.\n\nWith each passing week, it\u2019s getting easier to talk about crypto\u2019s relative stability compared to its performance in recent history\u2014even just a year ago. A cursory glance at some of the headlines of this column over the year reveals we\u2019ve had more slow news weeks than otherwise in 2023.\n\nHowever, we\u2019ve still come a long way since New Year\u2019s Day, when market leader Bitcoin (BTC) sold for roughly $16.5K. The world\u2019s favorite cryptocurrency begins the last weekend of September at a significantly higher price: $26,972. While that's only 2% higher than last week, it's about 60% more valuable than at the start of the year.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe market\u2019s biggest contender, Ethereum (ETH), added 4.7% over the last seven days and currently trades for $1,672, or about 40% higher than its New Year's Day price of $1,200.\n\nThis week, the added boost to Ether\u2019s price likely had something to do with the fact that VanEck\u2019s Ethereum Futures Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) was officially confirmed on Thursday.\n\nETFs are regulated investment products that allow investors to gain exposure to crypto without the risks of directly purchasing and storing it. To date, not a single crypto spot ETF has been approved by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). That\u2019s because spot ETFs are tied to the underlying assets, which are so far unregulated, but various Bitcoin and Ethereum futures ETFs that utilize derivatives are currently trading.\n\nOn Thursday, the SEC delayed delivering a verdict on two pending Ethereum spot ETF applications until after Christmas: Ark Invest and VanEck. The agency also announced that it was putting four major Bitcoin spot ETFs on the backburner: BlackRock, Bitwise, Invesco Galaxy Digital, and Valkyrie.\n\nThe only notable price movements among the thirty biggest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization this week were those of Bitcoin Cash (BCH), which rallied 11.8% to $234.13, and Chainlink (LINK), which surged 14% to $7.72.\n\nLINK\u2019s rally was catalyzed by the news that the network has extended cross-chain capabilities to Coinbase\u2019s Ethereum layer-2 network Base. By integrating its Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) with Base, the two networks can now interact, send messages, transfer tokens, and perform other functions. Chainlink is also the primary oracle for the Base network.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn other news...\n\nIt was another slow week with relatively few political or institutional developments vis-\u00e0-vis crypto regulation and adoption.\n\nOn Monday, Hong Kong\u2019s Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) announced new measures to enhance transparency and security in the cryptocurrency space. The initiative comes as authorities in the semi-autonomous city-state grapple with the JPEX incident: a case of suspected fraud involving a Dubai-based crypto exchange operating in Hong Kong\u2019s turf without licensing.\n\nThere are thought to be at least 2,305 victims of the incident, who collectively have been defrauded of HK$1.43 billion ($182.9 million), making JPEX one of the largest cases of financial fraud in Hong Kong history.\n\nFinally, Stablecoin issuer Circle launched its fiat-backed euro-pegged EURC stablecoin on Stellar, the third blockchain to host the coin after Ethereum and Avalanche."

This looks very healthy.\n\nI think this is one of the few where you\u2019ll be able to blindly buy dips for in the coming weeks.\u201d\n\nLooking at his chart, the trader seems to think that INJ is in an uptrend and can eventually retest the resistance level at $9.88 first and then $14.\n\nInjective is trading for $7.50 at time of writing, up 3.3% in the last 24 hours.\n\nThe trader also weighs in on Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), predicting the largest crypto assets will likely soon see a significant upswing based on a historical pattern.\n\n\u201cSeasonality is really important to look for in crypto. BTC and ETH traditionally do extremely well sometime in Q4 or Q1 the following year.\n\nIt makes sense, people sell their stuff in December and then rebuy it in January. This happens even in the worst bear markets.\u201d\n\nLooking at his chart, the trader identifies the times when he believes BTC followed the seasonal sell-off and rally pattern with the last two surges occurring in late 2022 and early 2023.\n\nBitcoin is trading for $26,904 at time of writing, down 0.7% in the last 24 hours.\n\nThe trader is also looking at the seasonality of Ethereum, predicting an ETH rally in the coming months.\n\n\u201cETH is really pronounced as well. Sometimes the rally comes in December, sometimes in January\u2026sometimes in November.\n\nBut usually, it\u2019s a strong rally that lasts about one month and we get some mini altcoin runs during those times. I\u2019ll be longing hard in November personally.\u201d\n\nEthereum is trading for $1,666 at time of writing, up 0.5% in the last 24 hours.\n\nLastly, the trader says Solana is retesting a key resistance level but it remains unclear if SOL will succeed in flipping it into support.\n\n\u201cSOL: not a great spot to buy here in my opinion, [retesting] the 200-day EMA (exponential moving average) on the 4-hour [chart], but I think it\u2019s going to be really interesting to see where the next high is set. Could be a market structure shift if we get a higher high on the 4-hour [chart]. Watching but not excited yet.\u201d\n\nBased on his chart, the trader seems to think a bullish scenario would send SOL to the $21 range before a dip, while his bearish scenario has SOL revisiting the low $17 range.\n\nSolana is trading for $20.24 at time of writing, up 2.7% in the last 24 hours.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Ethereum price is up almost 5% in the last week while Bitcoin price is up a meager 3%.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum price outperforms Bitcoin on speculation that SEC may approve ETH futures ETF sooner\n\nIt comes as firms line up to launch their Ether futures ETFs come Monday, October 2. Bloomberg Intelligence analyst and ETF expert James Seyffart and colleague Eric Balchunas have given a list of possible ETH futures ETFs set to debut on Monday. The list of nine funds will be issued by VanEck, BitWise, ProShares, Valkyrie, Kelly ETFs, and Volatility Shares.\n\nETFs set for October 2 listing\n\nThis list bases on the assumption that they are all operationally ready to go and that there will not be any last-minute entrants. It is worth mentioning that Hashdex ought to have been on the list, but then the firm\u2019s partnership with Kelly will not be happening.\n\nAccording to Seyffart, the combined assets under management (AUM) for all the nine ETH futures ETF products could range between 100 and 200 million. Balchunas has given the same estimate for the total AUM for the nine issuers, basing his assumption on the logic that BTC futures did $1 billion while ETH funds globally have 20% the AUM of Bitcoin funds. The ETF expert also anticipates that issuers will tap their client list to get as much volume or flow as they can get early.\n\nWith expectations of an announcement early Monday around 9:30 AM, Balchunas says the simultaneous premiere will be unprecedented. Specifically, having this many ETFs doing the same thing launching same day will make for a \u201cfascinating experiment and great foreshadow or undercard to the spot race.\u201d\n\nNew record as 68 ETFs launched on September\n\nAs a side note, up to 68 ETFs have launched in September alone, without including the list of nine expected to debut on Monday. It translates to a pace of more than three per day. According to Balchunas, which is a new all-time record.\n\nSixty-eight ETFs launched in September"

In a latest, CoinGape reported that asset management firm Invesco is also interested in launching the Invesco Galaxy Ethereum ETF.\n\nBitcoin ETFs: More Delays\n\nEarlier, Bitwise was joined by the likes of Blackrock and Invesco in the list of firms who got a delay on decision from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) around the Bitcoin ETF filings. This meant that the probability of a spot Bitcoin ETF approval in the year 2023 is almost zero. However, the Grayscale lawsuit verdict in favor of the conversion of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into a Bitcoin ETF could turn out to be the game changer when the US SEC takes a decision sometime in 2024.

        "content": "Today, Lido Finance is the largest player in the Liquid Staking space. In fact, as of the end of August 2023, it accounts for 73.4% of all staked $ETH on LSD protocols. Now, with such a huge allocation, Lido Finance controls a ton of voting power over Ethereum.\n\nThis brings about certain \u201ccentralization\u201d concerns, which we discuss below. But before we dive in deeper, let us do a quick recap on what Lido Finance is.\n\nWhat Is Lido Finance?\n\nIn short, Lido is a Liquid Staking Derivative (LSD) protocol. It allows users like you and me to stake $ETH without a minimum limit. Contrast this to staking directly on Ethereum, where you need a 32 $ETH minimum stake.\n\nIn addition, staking on Lido allows you to get $stETH. This is an LSD token that represents your stake. Over time, it accrues staking rewards as well. With $stETH, you can participate in DeFi and provide liquidity. Also, you could transact your $stETH too! The recipient can then redeem the $stETH for $ETH directly with Lido.\n\nWhy Is Lido Finance \u201cCentralizing\u201d Ethereum?\n\nTo answer this question, let us refer to the following tweet. Here, Danny Ryan from the Ethereum Foundation voices his concerns over Lido\u2019s voting power.\n\n\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8 Danny Ryan of the Ethereum Foundation calls @LidoFinance a \"corporatization, a centralization and a system threat\" of Ethereum. \"What happens when a regulator realizes that 3 people control the vote? I got 3 doors to knock on, easy.\" \ud83d\udc40 pic.twitter.com/K3eDQl5SAm \u2014 Pledditor (@Pledditor) September 26, 2023\n\nFirstly, Danny, one of Ethereum\u2019s Founders, feels that Lido is like a Venture Capitalist (VC)-owned \u201ccartel\u201d. Many projects in the crypto space are similar too. VCs are important to help jump-start a project with funding. However, Danny raises issues with VCs due to their control over LSD projects.\n\nSecondly, Danny says that in Lido, only \u201c3 people control the vote\u201d. Indeed, this reflects the centralization aspect of Lido. This is dangerous for any project in crypto. As Danny clearly points out, regulators only \u201cgot 3 doors to knock on, easy\u201d. In turn, this means that Lido can easily be shut down by authorities.\n\nA Centralized Protocol Controlling a Decentralized Ethereum\n\nToday, Ethereum is decentralized to a large extent. There are many validators and LSDs tokens that stake on Ethereum. However, he is not happy with Lido\u2019s centralization. He claims that it\u2019s akin to layering \u201ca pretty centralized component\u201d atop Ethereum. If Lido shuts down, it could significantly affect the finality of the Ethereum chain.\n\nHow Do We Avoid a \u201cDisaster\u201d Scenario?\n\nHere, Danny believes that the issue with Lido\u2019s centralization is not a huge issue at the moment. He believes that the situation can be managed. However, it\u2019ll be very helpful to discuss such scenarios early on. By bringing these issues early to the table, precautions can be taken.\n\nNah i still take the stand Danny is right and lido is a problem However, his point is on 'decentralization' and MAV If Lido control's 33%, that's an issue Similarly if BNP pools, control 33% that's still an issue The problem is concentration and not permissionlessness \u2014 Juve (@notjuve) September 27, 2023\n\nMoreover, members of the Ethereum community seem to be heeding Danny\u2019s warnings. For sure, we all hope for a decentralized Web3 world. Ethereum is the main foundation for this. Hence, we hope that Lido\u2019s centralization won\u2019t cause problems down the road.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe information discussed by Altcoin Buzz is not financial advice.

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin recently discussed the possibility of integrating more features directly into the Ethereum protocol.\n\nHistorically, the Ethereum project has aspired to maintain a core protocol with minimal complexity, encouraging building applications and solutions on top of it, also known as Layer-2 solutions.\n\nButerin, however, offered important discussions regarding maintaining a balance between protocol simplicity and advanced feature integrations.\n\nPhilosophy behind minimalist\n\nFrom its inception, Ethereum has embraced a minimalist philosophy, seeking to create a clean and simple core protocol and allowing innovations and advanced features to be built on top of it by users. This philosophy aimed to maintain a decentralized and user-empowering approach.\n\nHowever, Buterin acknowledges the growing interest in enshrining more features within the core Ethereum protocol. Enshrining, in this context, implies integrating advanced features and functionalities directly into the Ethereum protocol, which could potentially increase user convenience but may also pose challenges related to protocol complexity and governance.\n\nBenefits and trade-offs of new features\n\nEnshrining more features into the core protocol could help avoid potential centralization and mitigate risks in other areas of the blockchain ecosystem. It could offer standardized solutions, avoid complications arising from diverse independent implementations and enhance user flexibility and experience. However, Buterin emphasizes the caution required in this approach. Over-enshrining can complicate the protocol, overextend its governance, and may not always align with the evolving needs of the users. Hence, a balanced approach that maintains Ethereum's credible neutrality and aligns with user needs is crucial."

Thanks to this, the term \u201cEthereum killer\u201d gained traction as a way to describe the many competitive layers aiming for the top spot by attempting to overthrow the network\u2019s dominance.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ETHs worth today?\n\nFast-forward to the present, and Ethereum is still the most dominant PoS blockchain in some key areas. Layer Blockchains like Solana [SOL] and Avalanche [AVAX] have thus failed to dethrone Ethereum.\n\nThe latter\u2019s secret weapon is arguably its Layer-2 networks, which have allowed it to overcome the previously-existing scalability limitations.\n\nA recent Grayscale analysis revealed that Optimism [OP], Base, and Arbitrum [ARB], three Ethereum Layer-2s, have surpassed Avalanche and Solana in TVL.\n\nThis is because Ethereum is already miles ahead of its competition in terms of adoption and the dApps that operate on its network.\n\n?Following a period of strong growth, top performing Layer 2s #Arbitrum, #Optimism and #BASE are surpassing Ethereum competitor Layer 1s like Solana and Avalanche in terms of total value locked (TVL) as of 9/25.\n\nHere\u2019s why that\u2019s important. (1/6) pic.twitter.com/DpTJyLQ5Nj \u2014 Grayscale (@Grayscale) September 29, 2023\n\nLayer-2 networks successfully assist Ethereum in bypassing its previous limitations. The L2s facilitate transaction processing, allowing the dApps to operate efficiently and cost effectively. There is one key component that has allowed Layer-2 networks to surpass some Layer-1 blockchains.\n\nWhile the latter have to build up their own dApps and clientele, Layer-2s benefit from Ethereum\u2019s already existing dApps, of which there are plenty. On top of that, the same Layer-2s are also able to attract dApps on their own.\n\nLayer 2 blockchains process transactions from dApps and then \u201cbatch\u201d them together before sending a compressed version back to the main network for settlement, acting as a side road or even a dedicated bus lane augmenting a major highway. (2/6) \u2014 Grayscale (@Grayscale) September 29, 2023\n\nCan Ethereum Layer-2s secure market cap dominance?\n\nThese observations confirmed that Ethereum was still able to command robust utility and demand at press time. But while its Layer-2 networks enjoyed robust TVL growth, they were still lagging behind Solana and Avalanche in terms of market cap.\n\nAccording to the latest data, Solana\u2019s market cap was slightly over $8.8 billion, while Avalanche had a market cap of $3.27 billion at the time of writing. The closest of the aforementioned Layer-1s was Arbitrum at $1.17 billion, followed by Optimism at $1.06 billion.\n\nBase had the lowest market cap among them, at $530 million.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nIt makes sense that the Layer-2s would have lower market caps, considering that their counterparts are Layer-1 networks that have been around for longer. Nevertheless, the Layer-2 market caps highlighted their rapid growth.\n\nJudging by these factors, it is possible that they will get closer to Solana and Avalanche. These numbers also highlight the fact that it is now more difficult to beat Ethereum than ever before."

According to Beiko, there was an All Core Developer Execution (ACDE) meeting. During the meeting, participants talked about various subjects and added some touches to the already-existing development.\n\nTo test that, and to have a devnet with a large enough validator count to trigger EIP-7514, we\u2019ll launch a short-lived devnet-10 after devnet-9.

But as of then, he focused on improving validator schemes and deploying nodes.\n\nThis time, the developer gave more information on the changes made which are also vital to the Beacon Chain users. He mentioned that the changes would allow contracts on the Beacon roots to be future-proof against block times. Beiko confirmed that other development firms apart from the Ethereum Foundation mentioned that there were no new issues with the contract.\n\n\u201cBoth ChainSecurity and Dedaub had representatives on the call and confirmed that no other issues had been brought up since the two mentioned in the initial review, which we covered previously.\u201d\n\nNext up is a difficult discussion\n\nFurthermore, Beiko mentioned that there were other activities that included testing the MEV-Boost. Known as the Maximal Extractable Value, the MEV-Boost is a middleware developed to allow validators to request blocks from a network of builders.\n\nHowever, Beiko mentioned that a large number of validators, development, and networking specialists to get the Boost to function on the Ethereum Mainnet as desired. He said,\n\n\u201cTo test that, and to have a devnet with a large enough validator count to trigger EIP-7514, we\u2019ll launch a short-lived devnet-10 after devnet-9. Having a large validator set there will allow us to test the new churn limits.\u201d\n\nOther topics discussed included whether Ethereum L1 Mainnet should be Zero-Knowledge (ZK) friendly. Beiko disclosed that the developers all agreed that it wasn\u2019t something to hastily decide. Also, some were not sure if the functionality is something that Ethereum should have.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s ETH\u2019s market cap in BTC terms\n\nFollowing the indecisiveness, the developers agreed to have their next ACDE meeting on 12 October at 14:00 UTC."

        "content": "KuCoin, one of the leading cryptocurrency exchanges, recently released its latest asset reserve certificate dated Sept. 29. The report shows a noticeable decrease in user assets across Bitcoin, Ethereum and Tether. Specifically, BTC assets dropped by 4% to 17,617.5, ETH assets decreased by 3% to 148,125, and USDT assets fell by 4% to 837 million, compared to the previous month's data.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to DefiLlama, KuCoin has experienced a net outflow of approximately $118 million in the past month. This outflow is significant and warrants a closer look at the current market dynamics that could be influencing these movements.\n\nKucoin released the latest (9-29) asset reserve certificate. The user's BTC assets were 17,617.5, a decrease of 4% from the last time (8-31); the user's ETH assets were 148,125, a decrease of 3%; the user's USDT assets were 837 million, 4% lower than last time.\u2026 \u2014 Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) October 1, 2023\n\nSeveral factors could be contributing to this trend. First, the overall market has been experiencing a period of uncertainty and volatility, which often leads to investors moving their assets to perceived safer havens.\n\nSecond, the regulatory landscape is becoming increasingly complex, with more countries tightening their grip on cryptocurrency exchanges. This could have led to a loss of confidence among KuCoin users, prompting them to withdraw their assets.\n\nAnother possibility is the rise of decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, which offer lucrative yield farming and staking opportunities. Investors might be reallocating their assets to these platforms in search of higher returns, thereby reducing their holdings on centralized exchanges like KuCoin.\n\nIt is also worth considering the impact of competition. With new exchanges and trading platforms entering the market, offering lower fees and additional features, users have more options than ever and may be exploring these alternatives."

This transfer was accomplished using Thorchain, a decentralized exchange enabling cross-chain swaps that allow the hacker to convert the ETH holdings into BTC.\n\nA massive hack\n\nThese transactions marked yet another movement of Ether held in the compromised wallet since the hack occurred nearly a year ago.\n\nFor the uninitiated, FTX suffered a major security breach on Nov. 11, with unauthorized withdrawals amounting to about $600 million. The attack was believed by some to be an inside job.\n\nThe exploit took place only hours after FTX filed for bankruptcy protection and founder Sam Bankman-Fried stepped down from his role.\n\nShortly after the hack, blockchain experts suggested the exploiter exhibited signs of panic, hastily moving and converting tokens in an attempt to avoid detection and sustaining significant losses in the process.\n\nSBF's impending trial\n\nFTX's turbulent downfall shocked the industry, with the rapid dissolution of Bankman-Fried\u2019s once-flourishing $40 billion crypto empire.\n\n\n\nBankman-Fried is scheduled to face trial starting from Oct. 3, with charges including fraud and conspiracy levied against him.

        "content": "Table of Contents\n\nEthereum recently broke out of its downward trend. Will the number 2 cryptocurrency take centre stage for the next leg of the crypto bull market?\n\nSigns are good\n\nThe signs are starting to look good for ethereum. A break to the upside and a shift in the ETH/BTC pair in favour of the former, as well as a spike in ETH dominance, are all contributing to ETH perhaps coming to the fore and beginning a decent run higher.\n\nETH ascendancy over BTC\n\nHowever, for ETH to go higher it needs to break through important resistances. Against BTC, ETH is at 0.062. A break here does look a good possibility. There is some bullish divergence on the weekly time frame, and ETH is still respecting an upward trendline since January 2020.\n\nOver quite some time now though bitcoin has been in the ascendency. Ever since ETH made a high in early December of 2021 it has generally moved sideways and downwards ever since.\n\nETH bullish against the US dollar\n\nLooking at the ETH/USD pair things look really bullish. A long term ascending triangle has been playing out since mid-June 2022. ETH is at a major resistance in this triangle right now, and a break here clears the path to the flat top of the triangle.\n\nAscending triangles are very bullish and considering the length of time that ethereum has been inside the triangle, a potential breakout to the upside is likely to be explosive.\n\nOne fakeout has already occurred in April of this year, with a strong weekly candle out but then straight back in the following week. Other than that there have been some wicks to the upside, but the upsloping underside of the triangle has been almost perfectly respected.\n\nPros and cons\n\nMany crypto analysts argue that ethereum has more to offer than bitcoin. Where bitcoin only really has the store of wealth use case (albeit an incredibly useful one) ethereum has many use cases and potentially provides the foundation for many more to be built on top of it.\n\nBitcoin purists will say that ethereum lost its ability to be decentralised as soon as it transitioned to the proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, leaving the proof-of-work consensus that bitcoin uses.\n\nThis leaves ethereum open to being controlled by just a few large token holders, making a potential attack by a very large entity, such as a government, more likely.\n\nIn the meantime, ETH does look very bullish, both against its bitcoin pairing as well as that of the dollar pairing. For the rest of the altcoin market to rise a strong ethereum will be needed. This still remains to be seen.\n\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

        "content": "Valkyrie pulls back on Ether futures merge with Bitcoin ETF\n\nValkyrie Funds LLC will suspend the purchase of Ether (ETH) futures contracts for its Valkyrie Bitcoin and Ether Strategy ETF (BTF.O). Additionally, the firm will unwind any positions in Ethereum that it has already acquired.\n\nThe move comes barely 24 hours after the asset manager said it secured approval to convert its existing bitcoin futures exchange traded fund (ETF) to a two-for-one investment vehicle. Valkyrie was the first firm to do so among several pending applications with the US securities regulator.\n\nThis approval was granted after Valkyrie updated its prospectus and risk disclosures regarding Ethereum futures. The company said yesterday it expects the ETF\u2019s conversion to become effective on October 3, 2023, or earlier depending on the SEC\u2019s registration statement.\n\n\u201cThe Fund will not purchase ether futures contracts until the effectiveness of an amendment to the Fund\u2019s registration statement contemplating the addition of ether futures contracts to the principal investment strategy of the Fund,\u201d Valkyrie said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. \u201cUntil such time, the Fund will unwind any existing positions in ether futures contracts.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, the SEC had not yet published a proposed rule change to allow the listing of a new Ethereum (ETH) futures ETF on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange. However, they did release an order related to \u201cadditional analysis\u201d regarding the listing of the Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund, which is a spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nValkyrie also submitted an S-1 application form with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a Bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund. The company aims to have its fund listed on the Nasdaq exchange using the ticker symbol BRRR.\n\nThe main objective of the Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund, as outlined in the application, is to offer investors a convenient and cost-effective avenue for investing in Bitcoin. The fund\u2019s investment strategy revolves around tracking the performance of the value of Bitcoin, specifically referencing the CME CF Bitcoin Reference Rate \u2013 New York Variant (the \u201cIndex\u201d).\n\nNotably, Valkyrie has a track record in Bitcoin-related ETFs. It introduced the Valkyrie Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BTF), the second BTC futures ETF in the US, in October 2021. In December of the same year, it launched the Valkyrie Balance Sheet Opportunities (VBB) fund, which was later liquidated in October 2022.\n\nValkyrie also manages the Valkyrie Bitcoin Miners ETF (WGMI), a fund that tracks the securities of companies involved in Bitcoin mining operations. The fund invests at least 80% of its net assets in securities of firms that derive a minimum of 50% of their profit from bitcoin mining. This includes mining farms and companies producing specialized chips, hardware and software or other services to companies engaged in bitcoin mining.\n\nValkyrie\u2019s mining fund is actively managed, but doesn\u2019t invest directly in bitcoin or companies with BTC on their corporate balance sheets."

        "title": "Sergey Nazarov: Only Bitcoin, Ethereum, Chainlink Truly Decentralized - CryptoGlobe",
        "content": "Sergey Nazarov, co-founder of Chainlink, has reignited the longstanding debate on decentralization within the crypto industry.\n\nAccording to Nazarov, the term \u201cdecentralization\u201d is often misused to attract investment rather than to describe a network\u2019s actual structure. During an interview with Decrypt, he argued that only three projects\u2014Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Chainlink\u2014can be considered meaningfully decentralized.\n\nNazarov\u2019s comments come in the wake of recent security breaches in various crypto projects, including Celsius, Voyager, FTX, and Mixin Network. He refers to these incidents as examples of \u201cdecentralization theater,\u201d where the term is used more as a marketing gimmick than a factual descriptor. Nazarov sees decentralization not just as a buzzword but as a critical security feature. He cites Chainlink\u2019s four-year track record without hacks and the secure transfer of $8.5 trillion in value as evidence of the benefits of a decentralized system.\n\nHowever, Ethereum, one of the projects Nazarov considers decentralized, is currently grappling with its own centralization issues. The Lido Finance cartel is perceived as a significant threat to Ethereum\u2019s network. Despite this, Nazarov maintains that decentralization serves as a security mechanism, safeguarding the network from various vulnerabilities.\n\nAccording to Decrypt, Chainlink itself has not been immune to scrutiny. Critics point out that the project\u2019s price oracle has a 4-of-9 multi-signature access, which could have unintended consequences in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. DeFi security expert Chris Blec expressed concerns about the lack of transparency regarding who controls these signatures. He emphasized that the potential for these signers to manipulate Ethereum\u2019s price could pose a risk to DeFi protocols relying on Chainlink\u2019s price feeds.\n\nNazarov also told Decrypt that he agrees with the idea that decentralization is a spectrum but accuses many blockchain projects of falsely presenting themselves as decentralized. He called for an end to the misuse of the term and urged both developers and consumers to focus on building and supporting systems that offer genuine security and reliability.\n\nYesterday, during an interview on CNBC\u2019s Crypto World, Nazarov explained what can help prevent another crypto firm failure ahead of the trial of the bankrupt crypto exchange\u2019s Co-Founder and former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF)\n\nNazarov emphasized that the collapse of FTX should not be viewed as a failure of blockchain technology. According to him, FTX was more of a traditional financial institution that happened to deal in crypto assets. The failure was due to mismanagement of assets by the institution, rather than any inherent flaw in blockchain systems.\n\nNazarov highlighted the importance of \u201cproof of reserves\u201d in the wake of the FTX collapse. Chainlabs is the largest provider of this service, which validates the balance sheet of financial entities dealing in crypto assets. Proof of reserves offers real-time, cryptographically verified information about an institution\u2019s solvency, which is a significant step up from traditional annual audits.\n\nWhile proof of reserves is crucial, Nazarov acknowledged that it only provides a snapshot of an entity\u2019s financial health. He mentioned that the industry is moving towards other types of proofs like \u201cproof of liabilities\u201d and \u201cproof of solvency\u201d to offer a more comprehensive view of an institution\u2019s financial standing.\n\nNazarov noted that although crypto crime has decreased, it is mainly because the industry\u2019s growth has slowed down. He stressed the need for genuine decentralization to prevent hacks and scams. According to him, many platforms claim to be decentralized but are not, which makes them vulnerable to attacks.\n\nWhen asked about the factors hindering mass adoption of crypto, Nazarov cited a combination of eroding trust due to institutional failures, security issues, and lack of regulatory clarity. He emphasized that the crypto industry is cyclical and that it\u2019s crucial for the infrastructure to be robust enough to handle the next wave of interest and investment."

        "title": "Post-Merge Ethereum Ecosystem: Far-Reaching Implications of Proof of Stake - Cryptopolitan",
        "content": "In the ever-evolving landscape of cryptocurrencies, milestones are marked not only by the value of digital assets but by the transformative shifts that redefine the underlying technology. Among these transformative moments in Ethereum\u2018s history, \u201cThe Merge\u201d stands as a significant turning point.\n\nThe Merge, which unfolded on September 15, 2022, wasn\u2019t just another upgrade for Ethereum; it was a seismic shift. It marked the culmination of Ethereum\u2019s transition from the energy-intensive Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism to the more sustainable and environmentally friendly Proof of Stake (PoS) system. This transition was not merely a technical upgrade; it was a profound reimagining of how Ethereum operated, with far-reaching implications for its supply dynamics, environmental impact, and decentralization.\n\nThis article dives into the repercussions of The Merge one year after its implementation. It explores the reduction in Ethereum\u2019s supply, the rise of Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs), and the challenges posed by the growing dominance of specific protocols. Join us on a journey through the post-Merge Ethereum ecosystem, where supply shrinks, deflation looms, and decentralization remains a critical concern.\n\nSupply Reduction and Deflationary Ethereum\n\nThe Merge brought about fundamental changes to Ethereum\u2019s economic landscape, reshaping the issuance of Ether (ETH) and setting the stage for a deflationary future.\n\nThe Merge\u2019s Supply Dynamics\n\nThe Merge, celebrated as Ethereum\u2019s leap into a greener and more sustainable future, achieved a substantial reduction in the issuance of new Ether. Prior to The Merge, Ethereum operated on the energy-intensive Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism, where miners were rewarded with freshly minted ETH for validating transactions.\n\nWith The Merge\u2019s transition to Proof of Stake (PoS), a remarkable transformation occurred. New daily Ether issuance plummeted by over 80%, from 13,500 ETH to a mere 2,300 ETH. This significant reduction reflects Ethereum\u2019s commitment to controlling inflation and managing its monetary policy with greater precision.\n\nThe Concept of Deflationary Ethereum\n\nThe notion of Ethereum becoming a deflationary asset gained traction after The Merge. The key driving force behind this shift is Ethereum\u2019s burn mechanism. Unlike the PoW era, where miners were rewarded with ETH, PoS validators earn their rewards primarily through transaction fees. Importantly, a portion of these fees is permanently burned, effectively taking ETH out of circulation.\n\nIn essence, Ethereum\u2019s economic model has evolved to prioritize the removal of ETH from circulation, creating a scenario where the supply of ETH is poised to shrink over time. This deflationary characteristic aligns with the broader economic principle that often underpins cryptocurrencies \u2013 a capped or diminishing supply.\n\nETH Permanently Removed from Supply\n\nOne year after The Merge, Ethereum has witnessed nearly 1 million ETH being permanently removed from its supply. This monumental reduction signifies the success of Ethereum\u2019s deflationary mission. To put it into perspective, this decrease translates to almost 300,000 fewer ETH in circulation than at the time of The Merge\u2019s implementation.\n\nIn the world of cryptocurrencies, where tokenomics play a crucial role in shaping investor sentiment, Ethereum\u2019s journey toward becoming a deflationary asset is a significant milestone. It underscores the network\u2019s commitment to sustainability and responsible monetary policy, setting Ethereum on a distinctive path in the ever-evolving crypto landscape.\n\nRise of Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs)\n\nThe evolution of Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem post-The Merge gave rise to a new breed of digital assets known as Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs), fundamentally altering the landscape of staked Ether.\n\nThe Role of The Merge and Ethereum\u2019s Shanghai Upgrade\n\nThe catalyst for the emergence of Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs) can be traced back to The Merge, Ethereum\u2019s monumental shift from Proof of Work (PoW) to Proof of Stake (PoS). This transition fundamentally changed how Ether (ETH) was secured and rewarded within the network. Additionally, the subsequent Ethereum Shanghai upgrade, implemented in April, enabled the withdrawal of staked ETH, setting the stage for the LST boom.\n\nUnderstanding Liquid Staking Tokens\n\nLSTs are a novel category of digital assets that represent underlying positions of staked Ether (ETH). They serve as a bridge between the world of staking and decentralized finance (DeFi). Essentially, when an individual stakes their ETH within the PoS system, they receive a corresponding amount of LSTs in return. These tokens can then be freely traded on cryptocurrency exchanges or utilized within various DeFi applications.\n\nLSTs offer a level of flexibility that traditional staked assets lack. Holders of LSTs can actively participate in DeFi activities, lend their assets, or simply trade them, all while their underlying staked ETH continues to earn staking rewards in the PoS system.\n\nAdoption of Liquid Staking Tokens\n\nThe adoption of Liquid Staking Tokens has witnessed remarkable growth, solidifying their place within the Ethereum ecosystem. At present, approximately 10.8 million ETH, equivalent to 42.5% of all staked Ether, is held within liquid staking protocols. This surge in adoption underscores the demand for LSTs and their pivotal role in expanding the utility of staked assets.\n\nKey Liquid Staking Protocols\n\nSeveral liquid staking protocols have garnered significant attention and adoption within the Ethereum community. Notable among these is Lido, which stands as one of the top LST providers. Lido\u2019s ecosystem has witnessed substantial growth, with ETH holdings increasing by an impressive 82%, reaching 8.6 million ETH since the beginning of the year.\n\nAdditionally, Coinbase\u2019s entry into the LST space with cbETH has added to the diversity of available options for users seeking to leverage their staked ETH. Rocket Pool\u2019s rETH also holds a notable position, with 450,000 ETH locked within the protocol.\n\nThe rise of Liquid Staking Tokens exemplifies Ethereum\u2019s capacity for innovation and adaptability. It has not only expanded the utility of staked assets but has also provided users with newfound flexibility and opportunities within the DeFi landscape. As the Ethereum ecosystem continues to evolve, Liquid Staking Tokens remain a prominent and dynamic element in this ever-changing blockchain narrative.\n\nLido\u2019s Dominance and Centralization Concerns\n\nWhile Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs) have ushered in a new era of flexibility and utility within the Ethereum network, concerns have arisen regarding the growing dominance of one particular protocol, Lido, and its implications for centralization.\n\nLido\u2019s Unprecedented Dominance\n\nLido, as one of the prominent players in the LST ecosystem, has seen remarkable growth in its holdings of staked Ether (ETH). Since the beginning of the year, Lido\u2019s ETH holdings have surged by an impressive 82%, skyrocketing from 4.6 million ETH to 8.6 million ETH. This staggering accumulation underscores Lido\u2019s dominance within the staking landscape.\n\nCentralization Concerns\n\nThe rapid ascent of Lido\u2019s ETH holdings has triggered valid concerns about centralization within the Ethereum network. The essence of blockchain technology lies in its decentralized nature, where decision-making power and control are distributed among a diverse set of participants. However, when a single entity or protocol amasses a substantial portion of staked assets, the delicate balance of decentralization is disrupted.\n\nGovernance Challenges and Potential Attacks\n\nLido\u2019s dominance raises a critical question: What happens when a protocol becomes a major stakeholder within the network? Centralization of this nature can potentially lead to governance challenges, where a single entity wields disproportionate influence over network decisions, creating an environment ripe for conflicts of interest.\n\nFurthermore, if Lido\u2019s dominance remains unchecked, it could facilitate governance attacks against the Ethereum network. In such a scenario, a protocol with significant influence could push for changes that primarily serve its own interests, undermining the principles of decentralization that Ethereum holds dear.\n\nVitalik Buterin\u2019s Recommendations\n\nRecognizing the need to maintain a balanced and decentralized ecosystem, Ethereum\u2019s co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, has offered recommendations. Buterin proposed that staking providers controlling more than 15% of staked ETH should actively raise user fees to deter adoption until their dominance falls below this threshold.\n\nThis recommendation serves as a proactive measure to prevent excessive centralization and to encourage a diverse and inclusive staking environment. It emphasizes the importance of maintaining the ethos of decentralization that is at the core of blockchain technology.\n\nThe Path Forward\n\nWith The Merge marking a significant milestone in Ethereum\u2019s history, it\u2019s crucial to assess the achievements and challenges that lie ahead.\n\nAchievements of The Merge\n\nThe implementation of The Merge brought forth a transformative shift for Ethereum. It drastically reduced the supply of new Ether (ETH) through an 80% reduction in daily issuance, steering Ethereum toward deflationary territory. The burn mechanism, combined with Proof of Stake (PoS), paved the way for Ethereum to become a more environmentally sustainable and cost-efficient network.\n\nAddressing Decentralization and Governance\n\nWhile Ethereum has made substantial progress in reducing supply and environmental impact, it has not been without its share of concerns. Centralization and governance issues, exemplified by Lido\u2019s dominance, have come to the forefront.\n\nEthereum recognizes the need to strike a delicate balance between innovation and decentralization. Vitalik Buterin\u2019s recommendations, aimed at curbing excessive dominance by staking providers, serve as a step toward preserving the network\u2019s democratic nature.\n\nOngoing Developments and Upgrades\n\nEthereum\u2019s journey does not end with The Merge. The network remains committed to enhancing efficiency and the user experience. Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP)-4844, known as \u201cproto-danksharding,\u201d is on the horizon.\n\nThis upgrade is poised to reduce gas fees and increase transaction throughput, addressing one of the pressing concerns of the Ethereum community. By introducing data blobs that efficiently process and store data, Ethereum seeks to remain at the forefront of blockchain innovation.\n\nThe Future of Ethereum\n\nAs Ethereum navigates the path forward, its future holds great promise. The network has weathered challenges, adapted to evolving landscapes, and remained a stalwart in the cryptocurrency world.\n\nEthereum\u2019s role extends beyond being a blockchain; it is a platform for innovation, a catalyst for change, and a beacon of decentralization. In the ever-evolving cryptocurrency landscape, Ethereum remains poised to lead the charge, offering solutions to real-world problems and reshaping the way we envision the future of finance and technology.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn the aftermath of Ethereum\u2019s momentous transition, known as The Merge, several pivotal takeaways have emerged, steering the course of this pioneering blockchain network.\n\nThe Merge ushered in a significant shift in Ethereum\u2019s history, manifesting an impressive 80% reduction in daily Ether issuance. This transformation catapulted Ethereum towards a deflationary future. Concurrently, the introduction of Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs) unveiled a new layer of versatility. LSTs empower users to engage in trading and delve into DeFi applications, leveraging their staked Ether. Nonetheless, concerns have arisen due to Lido\u2019s prominent stature within the LST ecosystem, raising valid apprehensions regarding centralization and governance.\n\nThe ascent of Lido\u2019s ETH holdings has underscored a pressing concern \u2013 centralization within the Ethereum network. The intricate balance of decentralization, a cornerstone of blockchain technology, risks disruption when a singular entity amasses substantial control.

        "title": "Ethereum Has Over 10x Full-Time Developers Than Cardano: Will ADA Ever Catch Up? - Bitcoinist",
        "content": "Ethereum is the most popular smart contract platform if the number of full-time developers is anything to go by. Based on the Developer Report, sourcing their data from GitHub, Ethereum had 1,889 full-time developers, more than 10X those working on Cardano (153), a competing platform, and more than triple those working on Polkadot (621), as of October 1.\n\n\n\nDevelopers Prefer Ethereum: Competitors Struggling\n\nNotably, more developers are contributing code for the Bitcoin blockchain (340) than those working on Solana (268) and the BNB Chain (163). These platforms should technically have more code requirements because they support the launch of decentralized applications (dapps).\n\nDeveloper Report defines a \u201cfull-time developer\u201d as someone who submits code at least ten times monthly. Looking at trends and based on commits submitted at each of the top blockchain\u2019s source code at GitHub, there are at least 1,889 developers who have been actively offering code, and enhancing Ethereum. Based on this data, Ethereum appears to be cementing itself as a choice platform for developers and competing protocols, including Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA), could struggle to match.\n\nEthereum, Solana, Cardano, Bitcoin, and other popular networks are public ledgers. As such, their code is continuously improved by the community. Since they are public, the number of developers submitting code and actively revamping how the platform operates is critical.\n\nUsually, developer count will not only measure how healthy the protocol is but also the level of activity. Whenever there are multiple developers submitting codes, it indicates that the blockchain is garnering interest, which can contribute towards the release of a robust and secure network that can anchor innovation. This can also decentralize the platform from a developer perspective because no individual is relied on to improve the source code.\n\nCardano Is Building, Why Is ADA Trailing?\n\nEthereum is drawing more activity despite its competitor reaching a critical point in their development. For example, Cardano is at the Basho phase, where Charles Hoskinson, the founder, and Input-Output Global (IOG), the development wing of the blockchain, are building to enhance performance and scale.\n\nSome of the key features the team plans to launch eventually include Hydra, the layer-2 scaling solution being tested, and sidechains like Milkomeda and Atala PRISM, which are being tested.\n\nDespite these developments, Ethereum continues to dominate decentralized finance (DeFi) activity, looking at total value locked (TVL) according to DeFiLlama. As of October 31, Ethereum manages over $22 billion worth of assets, while Cardano controls roughly $198 million.\n\nOn to the charts, ADA is also struggling against ETH. ADA is down approximately 40% versus ETH from 2023 highs. Nonetheless, prices have been stable over the past three months, looking at price action in the daily chart.\n\nFeature image from Canva, chart from TradingView"
