        "title": "How To Invest In Ethereum (And Is It Too Late) - The College Investor",
        "content": "Investing in cryptocurrency and crypto assets is high risk. Don\u2019t invest unless you\u2019re prepared to lose all the money you invest. This is a high-risk investment, and you should not expect to be protected if something goes wrong. Investing in cryptocurrency and crypto assets is high risk. Don\u2019t invest unless you\u2019re prepared to lose all the money you invest. This is a high-risk investment, and you should not expect to be protected if something goes wrong.\n\nEthereum has become a popular cryptocurrency alternative to Bitcoin over the last year. However, unlike Bitcoin and rival currency Litecoin, Ethereum has been adopted by many companies and startups as a way to transact (and more). In the cryptocurrency wars, I like to view Ethereum like the diamond of the currencies - it has both a intrinsic value and an industrial value. Compare this to Bitcoin, which operates like gold - not much industrial value, but people buy it and sell it based on its intrinsic value to the holder. Given the popularity of Ethereum, many people are curious about what it actually is, how it's different than Bitcoin, and how to invest in it. It's also important to note the risks of investing, and the potential to mine it and create your own wealth of Ether (the actual monetary unit of Ethereum). Before we dive in, it's important to note that to look at, use, and transact in Ethereum, you need a digital wallet. We recommend Coinbase because it's free, has a great app, and they give you a bonus of $5 for opening a new account and making your first trade. Check it out.\n\nWhat Is Ethereum Ethereum is basically software that is decentralized and allows developers and programmers to run the code of any application. Wait, what? I thought Ethereum was money... well it has a monetary aspect. You see, Bitcoin uses a technology called blockchain specifically for conducting monetary transaction - it's a straight currency. Ethereum uses blockchain technology to allow the creation of applications that can be executed in the cloud, can be protected from manipulation, and much more (some stuff getting too technical for me here). However, a bi-product of this is that Ethereum uses a token called Ether, which is like Bitcoin, to transact. This is the monetary value portion of Ethereum. Because of its unique abilities, Ethereum has attracted all types of attention - from finance, to real estate, to investors, software developers, hardware manufacturers, and more. Plus, in September 2022, Ethereum converted from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake in an event known as \"The Merge\". This has given even more clout to the blockchain. Ripple is similar to Ethereum in that it's token XRP is also able to conduct real transactions. How Ethereum Is Different From Bitcoin As we mentioned above, Bitcoin was designed to be a currency. It uses the same underlying technology principles, but uses them to facilitate monetary transactions. Ethereum, on the other hand, was designed to facilitate software processing using a token system called Ether. That Ether has become more valuable as a result of people becoming interested in the technology. That Ether is what people want to invest in. However, there are a lot of apps being developed on Ethereum, and even some major financial companies are getting involved in the space. It could be interesting to see what develops from this over the next few years. Ethereum is also the basis for transacting in NFTs and other collectables online. So, if you want to buy an NBA Top Shot or other NFT, you need ETH. Finally, Ethereum is much cheaper than Bitcoin. Bitcoin currently trades for over $20,000 per unit, while Ether trades at closer to $1,000.\n\nHow To Buy Ethereum (ETH) If you're interested in investing in Ethereum, and specifically Ether, you need a digital wallet connected to a cryptocurrency exchange. Ethereum doesn't trade on any major stock platform. You can't go to your online discount broker and buy Ethereum. You have to convert it into your wallet. We recommend using Coinbase as a digital wallet because it's incredibly easy to use, allows you to invest in Bitcoin and Litecoin as well, and they will give you a bonus for signing up. If you sign up with this link you'll get a $5 in Bitcoin bonus if you open a new account and making your first trade. It's important to remember that Ether (ETH) is a currency, and should be treated as such by investors. You don't buy shares of Ether like you would stocks or ETFs. Instead, you are exchanging your dollars for Ether tokens. There are no dividends, no payouts. Your only hope is that in the future, other people on the Internet will pay you more for your tokens than you bought them for.\n\nIf you're not sure about using a digital wallet, and want to invest via an ETF, you can't do it yet. However, there is a Bitcoin ETF - GBTC, and you can invest in it or in Ethereum directly on eToro. You can also buy ethereum on a variety of platforms, including: Uphold\n\n\n\nBinance\n\nKraken\n\nHow To Sell Ethereum And Cash Out Once you own ETH, the selling of ethereum is just like the opposite of buying. You simply place a sell order on the exchange - like Coinase or Binance. It's important to note that you don't have to sell Ethereum and receive cash for it. On many exchanges, you can sell ETH and receive different cryptocurrency or USD. For example, you could sell ETH and receive USDC, USDT, or even BTC. If you are storing your ETH on a cold storage wallet (like a Ledger), you'll need to transfer the ETH back to an exchange to sell. You can use a centralized exchange like Coinbase or Binance, or a decentralized exchange like Sushiswap.\n\n\n\nHow To Transfer And Store ETH Once you buy and invest in Ethereum (ETH), it's a good idea to pull your crypto off the exchange and store it in your own cryptocurrency wallet that you control. There's several reasons for this, and there are some cons as well. Why you might want to store your ETH in your own wallet? Well, for starters, you don't control your private keys if you leave your crypto on an exchange like Coinbase. Furthermore, there are a lot of reports of exchanges banning accounts (without notification), and this could leave you trapped and unable to access your crypto. By moving your cryptocurrency, like Ethereum, to your own wallet, you have full control of your money. However, there is a big con - if you want to buy or sell more, you have an added step of either sending your ETH to an exchange to sell, or when you buy, you need to transfer it to your own wallet (and there could be an associated fee or gas charge with the move). It's up to you whether the added step is worth the security. Check out our list of recommended crypto wallets here."

Projections about the validator set featured in the chart above are based on two key assumptions. The first assumption is that Cancun/Deneb is activated in January 2024. The second assumption is that the staking appetite by Ethereum holders is sustained above the maximum churn for the next several months. This may not be the case given that the number of validators in the entry queue has been declining. The following chart depicts the total number of Ethereum validators in the entry queue since the Merge upgrade last year:"

        "content": "Ethereum ETH -2.47% dominates web3 developer activity across the U.S., while BNB -2.41% Chain leads the market in Europe and Asia, according to a report from crypto infrastructure provider Chainstack.\n\nWeb3 app developers utilize nodes hosted on traditional cloud platforms like Amazon Web Services. Chainstack examined its user infrastructure data to determine their usage patterns.\n\nChainstack runs nodes on behalf of its users, who can make requests to the nodes when wanting to make transactions or receive blockchain information. By analyzing node dominance and protocol preferences in 2023, Chainstack gained insight into web3 infrastructure trends and the popularity of various protocols by region and node type.\n\nProtocol preferences by region\n\nEthereum dominated in terms of protocol preferences in the U.S., with 18.8 billion (38.9%) of node requests, followed by BNB Chain with 31.3% and Polygon with 17.2%. Interest in Avalanche and Solana was also notable, accounting for 4.8% and 2.4% of node requests, respectively.\n\nIn Europe, BNB Chain led developer activity, registering 5.4 billion node requests (24.4%), closely followed by Polygon and Avalanche with 22.8% and 22.6%, respectively. Ethereum came in fourth place at 18.3%, with Arbitrum accounting for 8.6% and Solana 4.5%.\n\nBNB Chain also dominated in Asia, registering 3.4 billion requests, 72.1% of node infrastructure. Ethereum followed at 25.4%, with Polygon and Arbitrum generating 4.5% and 4.3% of requests, respectively.\n\nFull versus archive nodes\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nFull nodes dominated the market across all regions compared to archive nodes. Full nodes, in many crypto ecosystems, provide a more efficient solution by trimming blockchain data \u2014 compared to maintaining a full archive of transaction history state.\n\nThe preference was particularly notable in Asia, accounting for 99.5% of total requests. Full nodes served 65.8% of requests in the U.S. and 71% in Europe.\n\nWhen it comes to cost-effectiveness and scalability, elastic nodes were largely preferred. Elastic nodes can be accessed by multiple users and applications simultaneously, as opposed to dedicated nodes deployed for a single use or application.\n\nElastic nodes were again strongly preferred in Asia, registering 89.6% of requests. They also dominate in Europe at 61%. However, in the U.S., dedicated nodes lead with 52.6% of total requests.\n\nChainstack says it supports over 25 of the largest blockchain networks, including Ethereum, Bitcoin, Polygon and BNB Chain, enabling developers to deploy, manage and scale their dapps and used by projects such as 1inch, TheGraph, Chainlink, LayerZero and Trust Wallet."

        "title": "SEC drags on with spot Bitcoin ETFs, Ethereum futures get a nod - InvestmentNews",
        "content": "The SEC gave a big present to crypto ETF firms late last week ahead of the government shutdown that appeared inevitable, reportedly granting approval for a number of ethereum futures strategies that could start trading soon.\n\nFirst on its list appears to be Valkyrie Funds, which had filed with the regulator to add ethereum futures to its existing Bitcoin Strategy ETF. Another firm, VanEck, announced Thursday that it would soon launch its Ethereum Futures ETF, declining to give a precise date. And according to reporting by Reuters, the biggest bitcoin futures ETF shop, ProShares, was also granted approval. That firm similarly announced on its site that its three ETFs featuring ethereum futures would be available soon.\n\nThe development, much as any previous indications that the SEC might be moving forward with approval of crypto-themed funds, led to a mass of additional filings for products. Other firms that essentially got in line for approval by the SEC include Kelly ETFs and Bitwise.\n\nBut the apparent approvals of ethereum futures ETF followed news that likely upset crypto fund proponents, with the SEC indicating a further delay in approving spot bitcoin products. Since Grayscale Investments\u2019 recent court win over the SEC\u2019s denial of its application, there has been mounting pressure on the agency to begin approving spot bitcoin ETFs.\n\n\u201cThe SEC has been clearing their desks ahead of the possible government shutdown, which means issuing delays for spot bitcoin ETF filings while likely allowing ether future ETFs to potentially begin trading early next week,\u201d Roxanna Islam, head of sector and industry research at VettaFi, said in an email. \u201cIt\u2019s likely that these products will be accelerated to launch sooner than later before the government shutdown occurs.\u201d\n\nThat shutdown was temporarily averted on Saturday, with Congress approving a spending bill that will continue to keep the government open for 45 days.\n\nOn Friday, Valkyrie filed an update with the SEC in which it appeared to back away from an immediate launch of an ethereum futures strategy within its bitcoin ETF.\n\n\u201cEffectively immediately, the fund will not purchase ether futures contracts until the effectiveness of an amendment to the fund\u2019s registration statement contemplating the addition of ether futures contracts to the principal investment strategy of the fund. Until such time, the fund will unwind any existing positions in ether futures contracts,\u201d the company stated.\n\nWhile the approvals are a step forward for crypto ETF providers, it\u2019s only a minor development compared with the eventual launch of spot products, demand for which is expected to quickly eclipse that of crypto futures ETFs.\n\nAlthough there has been significant interest in the biggest bitcoin futures ETF, the $952 million ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF, advisors who want crypto funds are waiting for spot products, said Tyrone Ross, CEO and co-founder of Turnqey Labs.\n\n\u201cFinancial advisors have no interest in futures ETFs. Most advisors want a spot bitcoin or spot ethereum ETF,\u201d Ross said. \u201cAs far as advisors go, it\u2019s a miss.\u201d\n\nThere could be demand among retail investors and hedge funds, but the complicated nature of futures products, on top of the crypto asset class that many people do not understand, make them a tough sell to advisors, he said.\n\n\u201cCrypto is hard enough. But now I have to explain a crypto futures product?\u201d Ross said, adding that the fees for the products can also be discouraging. \u201cFrom a compliance standpoint, it\u2019s going to be hard to get a futures product [approved].\u201d\n\nRoss is not a fan of ETFs for crypto in any form, but said that the \u201cbroader wealth management space is a little giddy\u201d as the ethereum futures ETF approvals \u201cmeans more pressure is being put on [SEC Chair] Gary Gensler and that we are closer to approval of a spot ETF.\u201d\n\nGiven that anyone who wants to hold ethereum can do so through a U.S. exchange, the futures ETFs approval \u201cis kind of a nothingburger,\u201d said Mike Alfred, whose hedge fund Alpine Fox focuses on bitcoin and bitcoin-related equities.\n\n\u201cIt may be bullish for ethereum traders in the short term,\u201d as the approvals mean another avenue of quasi access to it, he said.\n\nSpot products will offer lower fees compared with those of futures products, Alfred said.\n\n\u201cThe real embedded cost of owning a futures product is a lot higher,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the risk of underperforming the actual asset is high.\u201d\n\nFor example, while the price of bitcoin has increased by 62% so far this year, the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF has returned less than 32%.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think an ethereum futures [ETF] approval is much of a watershed moment,\u201d Alfred said. \u201cIf anything, it shows how backwards-thinking the SEC is on this.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s note: This story was updated to reflect the temporary spending bill passed on Saturday by Congress."

        "title": "Looking for the Next Ethereum? 2 Cryptocurrencies to Buy Now - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Since its launch in July 2015, Ethereum (ETH -0.21%) has been one of the best financial assets any investor could have owned, as the token's price has skyrocketed 53,000% over its roughly eight-year history (as of Sept. 27). The road hasn't been a smooth one, as the past couple years have shown, but it's hard to deny the rapid rise of this digital asset.\n\nWhile Ethereum might be on your radar as a potential buying opportunity today, especially since it's currently 67% below its peak price, it's worthwhile to consider two smaller cryptocurrencies to invest in.\n\nThe world's decentralized computer\n\nWhat makes Ethereum different from Bitcoin, the world's oldest and most valuable cryptocurrency network, is that it was the first blockchain to introduce smart contracts. These are software programs that automatically run when the stakeholders satisfy their ends of a particular agreement. Smart contracts are an innovative feature that underpin the promise that cryptocurrency could disrupt numerous industries by eliminating the need for middlemen.\n\nThis adds tremendous functionality to the Ethereum network, leading some to call it the world's biggest decentralized computing platform. In fact, Ethereum has become the undisputed leader in terms of decentralized applications, including for things like non-fungible tokens and decentralized finance protocols.\n\nEthereum's development pipeline is also indicative of the sheer number of computer programmers working on its advancement. An upgrade called the Merge transitioned the network to a proof-of-stake consensus system, which is more energy-efficient and an update that could set the blockchain up for better scalability. There are many more phases left on the horizon.\n\nIt might seem like a no-brainer decision to buy this crypto right now, but investors might want to look at these so-called \"Ethereum killers.\"\n\nThe case for Cardano\n\nAs the seventh-most-valuable cryptocurrency, Cardano (ADA 6.69%) immediately comes to mind as a formidable rival to Ethereum's dominance. Cardano was launched in 2017 by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson, and its token has climbed in value by 874% during that time.\n\nWhat makes Cardano unique is not that it also enables the implementation of smart contracts or that it runs a PoS consensus mechanism, but it's the blockchain's unique development approach. While many cryptos adopt the Silicon Valley mindset of \"go fast and break things,\" Cardano instead emphasizes being cautious and thoughtful when introducing changes to the network.\n\nThe current stage of development is known as Basho, which focuses on things like scaling and interoperability. This is the fourth of five parts, with the last stage focused on governance. Cardano relies on top researchers, computer scientists, and other academics from leading universities across the globe to help push it forward.\n\nCardano already has proven its ability to launch real-world enterprise-level solutions using its innovations. For example, it can better handle KYC/AML checks in the financial services industry. And it can help track supply chains in the agricultural sector.\n\nAs long as Cardano continues making progress on improving the network with new tech features, while also boosting utility in various industry settings, there's certainly the potential for its token to rise in value.\n\nThe case for Solana\n\nSolana (SOL 14.20%) was launched in 2020 by ex-Qualcomm engineer Anatoly Yakovenko. Its token has skyrocketed 1,890% since its founding, a wonderful gain. Currently, Solana carries a market cap of $7.8 billion, making it the ninth-most-valuable cryptocurrency in the world.\n\nLike Ethereum and Cardano, Solana also possesses functionality for smart contracts. And in addition to operating a PoS system, this blockchain also runs something known as proof-of-history (PoH). PoH basically eliminates the need to add timestamps to the data included in blocks, which can speed up transaction throughout. Solana is actually known as being the fastest crypto network, with a theoretical capacity to process 50,000 transactions per second (TPS). For comparison's sake, Ethereum can only handle less than 15 TPS right now.\n\nNaturally, this makes Solana a prime candidate to disrupt one of the most lucrative areas within the overall financial services space, and that's payments. In early 2022, Solana Pay was introduced. This innovative service allows a merchant and consumer to transact with each other directly, with instant settlement and virtually no fees. For businesses that run on thin margins, getting rid of the need to process costly credit card payments can lead to savings that flow straight to the bottom line.\n\nOf course, this puts Solana in direct competition with the likes of Visa and Mastercard. Even so, it's easy to get excited about the potential."

Bitwise said the launch of these ETFs will facilitate investor access to Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Ether futures and further expand regulated and trusted investment avenues in the crypto sector.\n\nEthereum futures ETFs\n\nBitwise chief investment officer Matt Hougan noted the extensive portfolio opportunity Ethereum offers compared to Bitcoin, describing it as a blend of alternative and conventional growth investment. He added:\n\n\u201cSome investors view Ethereum as an alternative, while others perceive it as a conventional growth investment, encompassing attributes of both.\u201d\n\nThe launch comes as Ethereum continues to establish itself as a nexus of innovation and growth. It brings forth an ecosystem thriving with applications and developments, capturing the attention of millions of users and leading brands.\n\nBitwise CEO Hunter Horsley highlighted Ethereum\u2019s dynamic growth and the momentum it\u2019s gaining and said the ETFs are intended to be a gateway for investors to participate in Ethereum\u2019s expanding landscape through regulated avenues that inspire confidence.\n\nBroader landscape\n\nThe commencement of trading for Bitwise\u2019s ETFs is part of a larger trend, with numerous companies, including Invesco and Valkyrie, exploring Ethereum ETF offerings while awaiting approval for spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nThe decisions by the U.S. SEC on these applications are highly anticipated, with outcomes potentially being influenced by related developments such as the Grayscale lawsuit.\n\nThe crypto community is keenly observing what the SEC does, as approval decisions by the watchdog are poised to shape the trajectory of crypto investments in the U.S. for years to come.\n\nNotably, Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart revealed that nine Ethereum Futures ETFs, including Bitwise\u2019s, are set to receive expedited approval from the SEC for their launch on Monday, October 2, 2023."

The asset has recently seen a significant rebound, raising eyebrows and hopes alike. While the exact numbers cannot be obtained at this moment, general sentiment around Ethereum is turning bullish.\n\nAccording to recent data, ETH is priced at $1,619.41, with a 1.79% increase, hinting at a positive momentum shift. This rebound is particularly noticeable as ETH managed to break through the 21-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), a crucial technical indicator. Although the market remains unpredictable and there is a possibility for ETH to experience a downturn, this rapid growth spurt is a positive signal. It hints at the potential recovery of this widely used network, stirring optimism among investors.\n\nHowever, it is crucial to approach this with a balanced perspective. While the recent uptick is undoubtedly a positive sign, it does not entirely rule out the possibility of a downturn. The crypto market is notoriously volatile, and Ethereum is no exception to this rule.\n\nWhat makes this rebound particularly noteworthy is its timing. Ethereum's network is the most utilized in the crypto space, serving as the backbone for countless decentralized applications and smart contracts. A resurgence in Ethereum's price could signify a broader recovery of the crypto market, given its integral role in the ecosystem.\n\nIn summary, Ethereum's recent price performance is a glimmer of optimism in a market that has been craving good news. The breakthrough of the 21 EMA is a positive technical indicator, but it is essential to remain cautious. The asset could still experience setbacks, but its rapid growth is a sign that the most used network in the crypto space might be waking up from its slumber.\n\nShiba Inu trying to break through\n\nIn recent days, Shiba Inu (SHIB) has showcased a resilient stride toward reclaiming its position in the market, endeavoring to breach what once was a support level. A mere two days ago, the asset encountered a setback, dipping below the trendline support level, which, to many, signaled a potential acceleration of its fall.\n\nHowever, the latest market data suggests that Shiba Inu is still aiming for a prominent move upward.\n\nThe descent below the trendline was a blow to SHIB, but the subsequent activity brings a silver lining. The real-time price data unfolds a narrative of mild resurgence, but whether this is a harbinger of a bullish trend or a temporary respite remains under scrutiny.\n\nA close inspection of the price action reveals a skirmish between the bulls and bears at the former support level, now a resistance point. The tug of war underlines the crucial phase SHIB is traversing, with every tick potentially altering the course. The fervent community, undeterred by the recent slump, rallies behind initiatives aimed at propelling SHIB back to favorable waters.\n\nCrypto under DXY's pressure\n\nThe rising tide of the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) is casting long shadows over the cryptocurrency market, signaling a disquieting phase in market dynamics. This growth of the dollar, often seen as a refuge during turbulent times, underscores the tumult currently besieging the crypto sphere.\n\nA deep dive into real-time data reveals a stark contrast in the market's pulse. The dollar's ascendancy coincides with a discernible tremor running through the crypto market's spine. Each uptick in the DXY seemingly douses the fiery allure of cryptocurrencies, painting a picture of a market at a crossroads. The dwindling liquidity coupled with reduced volatility is morphing into a repellent, shooing away investors who once flocked to the crypto market in search of lucrative ventures.\n\nThe narrative spun by the growing strength of the dollar is not just a tale of two markets but a reflection of global economic shifts. As traditional and digital financial realms intertwine, the repercussions of movements in one echo in the other. The dollar's current trajectory is a glaring sign of the crypto market's tribulations, further fueled by a cocktail of regulatory uncertainties and market sentiment swayed by macroeconomic winds."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nSupply dynamics in Ethereum are constantly being upended amid this year's dizzying drop in DeFi, NFT sales, and meme coin trading.\n\nDepending on which time frame you are looking at, Ethereum can be deflationary or inflationary: on a seven-day model, Ethereum becomes more scarce, whereas on a yearly framework, it issues more than it burns.\n\nWhat\u2019s going on with the network\u2019s supply dynamics, why are transaction fees prices dropping, and how does it look for the future of Ethereum?\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBack in August 2021, Ethereum implemented EIP-1559, which introduced a fee-burning mechanism. Since then, the supply has had a direct connection to gas prices. Higher gas prices mean more ETH getting burned and vice versa.\n\nThis set the table for last year\u2019s merge. The transition from proof-of-work to proof of stake ended up reducing the issuance of ETH by 90%, leading many to claim that the network was now \u201cultrasound money.\u201d\n\nBut that label has been put to the test amid dwindling gas prices and lesser transactional volume.\n\nTransaction fees stand at around $0.28 for sending ETH across the protocol. According to Etherscan data, a trade on Uniswap currently costs $2.76\u2014a far cry from its $4.17 price in early September and a level not seen since the collapse of FTX in late 2022.\n\nAmberdata\u2019s head of research, Chris Martin, told Decrypt that the reasons for declining gas prices are three-fold.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe Ethereum Foundation's focus on scaling with Ethereum 2.0 has had enormous benefits for the network, making it cheaper and more secure,\u201d was his first order of things. Martin then referred to the growth of Layer-2s, elucidating how the increase in these scaling solutions has \u201ctaken a lot of the volume off the mainchain.\u201d\n\nIn third place, said Martin, is the lack of narrative\u2013something the broader crypto market has been grappling with as of late. \u201cThe current market has left many waiting for the next big thing,\u201d he explained, adding that \u201cthere are opportunities, only these are less than in 2021.\u201d\n\nJulio Barragan, the director of education at Blocknative\u2014a Web3 tool that lets users price, preview and monitor transactions\u2014thinks the gas situation is only momentary. He told Decrypt that \u201cas soon as volume picks back up, so will competition for block space, and the network will automatically adjust gas prices accordingly.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s to come, then? For Barragan, it\u2019s a nebulous future.\n\n\u201cPredicting the future of Ethereum gas prices is further complicated by the gradual acceptance of ERC-4337,\u201d he told Decrypt. Also known as account abstraction, the upgrade will look to make crypto wallets as easy to use as email.\n\nBarragan added that it\u2019s unclear what the long-term impact account abstraction and further adoption of layer-2\u2019s will have on gas prices \u201dand therefore supply.\u201d\n\nHe concluded that lower fees can bring more users and activity on-chain, but \u201cmore users ultimately lead to more congestion.\u201d"

Their ambition is to redefine the landscape of what is popularly known as the \u201cinternet of blockchains.\u201d\n\nAt the core of this 50-page document lies Cosmos\u2019 commitment to blockchain modularity and interoperability, concepts that are fundamental to the network.\n\nThese underline Cosmos\u2019 aim to serve as a conduit, connecting various blockchain protocols, allowing seamless communication and transaction processes without necessitating token wrapping.\n\nThe emphasis on Ethereum(ETH) rollups reveals a clear intention: to cater to developers who have found layer-2 solutions restricting.\n\n1/ Unveiling the #IBC rebrand!\n\n\n\nRealigning the Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol to its core mission:\n\n\n\n\u2018\u2019Provide a universal framework for blockchains to communicate, laying the foundation for developers to build without boundaries.\u2019\u2019 pic.twitter.com/N4FHzTu6zY \u2014 Interchain Foundation (@interchain_io) September 28, 2023\n\nA pivotal element in Cosmos\u2019 strategy is its Inter-Blockchain Communication protocol (IBC).\n\nIn 2024, the primary goal of IBC is to integrate it with zero-knowledge and optimistic rollup frameworks, expanding its horizons further.\n\nAlongside, Cosmos\u2019 Software Developer Kit (SDK) emphasizes the platform\u2019s edge over Ethereum, particularly in terms of customizability.\n\nYou might also like: Noble and Celestia partner to introduce native Cosmos stablecoin\n\nThis distinct advantage is attributed to Cosmos\u2019 inherent flexibility, a byproduct of its modularity, which delineates blockchain functionalities.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s essential to note, as Cosmos SDK admits, that while their software is theoretically modular, practical application is somewhat challenging.\n\nMaria Gomez, Interchain Foundation\u2019s managing director, said Cosmos has found it challenging to appeal to developers, primarily due to the absence of a native token which could serve as a financial incentive.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Vitalik Buterin, for instance, presents roadmaps that, even if not realized, stir excitement and foster conversations.\n\nThis narrative-driven engagement is what Cosmos aspires to replicate with its 2024 roadmap.

        "content": "The SEC has approved asset manager Valkyrie to begin trading Ether futures.\n\nThe regulator moved to delay its decision on a spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nA potential government shutdown may impact ETF approvals, analysts said.\n\nHappy Friday!\n\nUS investors now have access to Ether futures through an exchange traded fund. Asset manager Valkyrie was approved to add Ethereum futures to its existing Bitcoin ETF. The move comes as analysts predict pending Ether futures ETFs will be given the green light imminently.\n\nHere\u2019s why that matters.\n\nGreen lights\n\nValkyrie will begin to add Ether futures to its existing Bitcoin strategy ETF on Friday. The asset manager will allocate 10% of its fund to Ether initially, increasing this to 50% on Monday.\n\nStay ahead of the game with our weekly newsletters Subscribe\n\nThe decision is expected to be quickly followed by approval of a host of Ether futures ETFs.\n\nVanEck, another asset manager vying for approval, released a video Thursday promoting its Ether futures ETF, which it said was \u201ccoming soon.\u201d\n\nEthereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalisation, has gained 2.7% since Thursday.\n\nETFs offer investors an affordable and convenient way to bet on the performance of stocks, commodities, and cryptocurrencies. They also tend to be highly liquid.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nThe products are therefore expected to bring increased investment to the sector, although futures products are not as keenly sought after as are spot ones.\n\nFutures contracts give investors a chance to speculate on what the price of an asset will be in a few months time.\n\nEther futures ETFs have been sought out by the crypto industry to allow investors to gain exposure to crypto assets without going through the difficulty of setting up crypto-specific infrastructure, such as wallets.\n\nWhile Bitcoin futures ETFs have been available in the US for some time, an ETF that invests in spot Bitcoin has yet to be approved by the SEC.\n\nThe agency recently delayed its decisions on applications from Cathie Wood\u2019s ARK Invest and fund manager Global X. Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst James Seyffart stated that he expected all remaining applications to be delayed before an expected government shutdown on October 1.\n\nThis would push back the deadline for most Bitcoin spot ETF applications to January \u2014 except for Global X\u2019s application, which is set for review in November.\n\nEther futures ETF approvals may also have been accelerated to get in ahead of the shutdown, according to Eric Balchunas, an ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence.\n\nA US appeals court ruled that the SEC erred by denying Grayscale\u2019s application for such an offering. That decision could pave the way for a spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nMike Novogratz, founder of crypto trading platform Galaxy Digital, recently said the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF is a matter of \u201cwhen, not if.\u201d\n\nCrypto market movers\n\nBitcoin flirted with levels around $27,000 after it gained 2% since Thursday.\n\nEthereum jumped 3.3% as it traded around $1,670.\n\nSolana\u2019s SOL and Ripple\u2019s XRP rallied overnight, up 5.5% and 7.4% respectively.\n\nWhat we\u2019re reading\n\nAdam Morgan McCarthy is DL News\u2019 London-based Markets Correspondent.

        "content": "Cosmos, a blockchain where developers can create custom chains that interconnect and communicate, has revealed its roadmap for 2024. According to an X post on September 25, the roadmap centers on increasing modularity, improving the developer experience, addressing \u201ctechnical debt,\u201d and driving user adoption. With this, Cosmos developers plan to take on the more established platform, Ethereum.\n\nAt the heart of Cosmos are features such as Tendermint, a consensus system that anchors blockchains such as the BNB Chain; Cosmos SDK, a software developer kit that allows coders to build fluid and custom blockchains; and the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC), from where all deployed custom Cosmos chains can connect and communicate, effectively driving interoperability.\n\nCosmos Wants To Repay The Technical Debt And Make Its SDK More Modular\n\nIn 2024, reading from the roadmap, Cosmos aims to solidify its position by attracting developers from competing platforms as they repay the \u201ctechnical debt.\u201d In app development, technical debt leads to extra work and can be caused by resource constraints and shifting code requirements.\n\nCosmos will expand its developer base to repay this debt and make the Cosmos SDK more modular. Although the team claims the SDK has been modular in theory, swapping and modifications have made practical implementation more challenging.\n\nTherefore, to tackle these challenges, the work already done on Cosmos SDK will continue into 2024. Then, the goal will be to make the kit more modular at the core. This will make it more adaptable and flexible, meeting developer requirements.\n\nEthereum Is Still Dominant\n\nIt is yet to be seen whether this will be achievable in 2024 and whether Cosmos will grow as dominant as Ethereum. Currently, Ethereum is the leading smart contract platform, based on its market cap and the total value locked (TVL) in decentralized finance (DeFi). Additionally, its ecosystem of layer-2s has been increasing, with more protocols and blockchains connecting to Ethereum to take advantage of the network\u2019s pioneering activity.\n\nDeFiLlama data on September 29 shows that all the top 10 bridges are connected to Ethereum. To illustrate, Stargate\u2013by Cosmos, is connected to Ethereum and multiple blockchains, including Avalanche and the BNB Chain.\n\nBesides Stargate, other bridges are Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible and predominantly connect to Ethereum layer-2s and Polygon, the sidechain. For example, the zkSync Era, Base, Arbitrum, Polygon, and the Optimism Gateway, are plugged into Ethereum. Cumulatively, these bridges move millions of dollars worth of tokens to and from Ethereum at any instance.\n\nFeature image from Canva, chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "The launch of Ethereum futures ETFs heralds cautious optimism in the crypto world. Here is everything you need to know.\n\nThe U.S. financial markets are buzzing with excitement as, for the first time in the country, an Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded fund (ETF) stands on the brink of introduction.\n\nOn September 28, asset management company VanEck dropped a significant announcement, confirming the debut of their VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF (EFUT). Investors can expect to see EFUT shares listed on the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE), with the listing date still kept under wraps by VanEck.\n\nBut here\u2019s the twist. While Ethereum futures ETFs like EFUT are seeing the green light, their counterparts that focus on actual cryptocurrencies, known as crypto spot ETFs, are still stuck at the regulatory crossroads.\n\nThe Ethereum ETF by VanEck is just the tip of the iceberg, leading a convoy of 14 other proposals knocking on the SEC\u2019s door, each hoping to launch their version of this product.\n\nWhat does this all mean for investors? Here is everything you need to know about Ethereum ETFs.\n\nYou might also like: What is Bitcoin ETF and which companies applied for it in the US?\n\nEthereum ETFs and their types\n\nAn ETF is a type of investment fund that\u2019s traded on stock exchanges, similar to individual stocks. Essentially, it\u2019s a basket of assets \u2013 whether that\u2019s stocks, commodities, or other investment types \u2013 that offers diversification and accessibility to investors.\n\nTaking that concept into the realm of cryptocurrency, an Ethereum ETF mirrors the behavior of Ethereum. By purchasing Ethereum ETF shares, investors get exposure to Ethereum\u2019s price fluctuations without actually owning ETH coins.\n\nThere are two kinds of Ethereum ETFs: spot and future.\n\nSpot ETFs\n\nSpot ETFs are essentially funds that directly purchase and hold Ethereum tokens. When you buy a share of a Spot ETF, you\u2019re buying a piece of an actual Ethereum token, but it\u2019s the fund that holds it for you.\n\nKey characteristics\n\nDirect exposure : With spot ETFs, your investment\u2019s value moves directly with the price of Ether. When Ethereum\u2019s price goes up, so does the value of your investment, and vice versa.\n\n\n\n: With spot ETFs, your investment\u2019s value moves directly with the price of Ether. When Ethereum\u2019s price goes up, so does the value of your investment, and vice versa. Storage : Unlike individual investors in cryptocurrency who need to manage digital wallets and remember cryptographic keys, spot ETF investors don\u2019t have to deal with these technicalities. The ETF handles the storage and security of the Ethereum tokens.\n\n\n\n: Unlike individual investors in cryptocurrency who need to manage digital wallets and remember cryptographic keys, spot ETF investors don\u2019t have to deal with these technicalities. The ETF handles the storage and security of the Ethereum tokens. Liquidity management: Because these funds hold the actual Ethereum cryptocurrency (ETH), managing the ability to quickly buy or sell can sometimes be more complex, especially in volatile markets.\n\nFutures ETFs\n\nFutures ETFs are a bit different. They don\u2019t buy or hold Ethereum directly. Instead, they invest in futures contracts. These are agreements to buy or sell Ethereum at a set price on a certain future date. It\u2019s like agreeing today on the price for something you\u2019ll buy or sell later.\n\nKey characteristics\n\nIndirect exposure : Futures ETFs are influenced by both the current price of Ethereum and predictions about its future price.\n\n\n\n: Futures ETFs are influenced by both the current price of Ethereum and predictions about its future price. No physical handling : These ETFs deal with contracts about Ethereum, not the cryptocurrency itself. This means the funds don\u2019t have to manage the storage or security of actual Ethereum tokens.\n\n\n\n: These ETFs deal with contracts about Ethereum, not the cryptocurrency itself. This means the funds don\u2019t have to manage the storage or security of actual Ethereum tokens. Rolling contracts: Futures contracts have expiration dates. So, when one contract\u2019s end date approaches, the ETF\u2019s managers have to replace it (or \u201croll it over\u201d) with a new contract. This process can influence the ETF\u2019s returns, especially if future prices are significantly different from current ones.\n\nPros and cons of ETH ETFs\n\nWhile Ethereum ETFs offer some exciting advantages, they come with their set of challenges.\n\nAdvantages of Ethereum ETFs\n\nDiversification: Ethereum ETFs are an excellent tool for those looking to broaden their investment portfolio. By providing exposure to Ethereum\u2019s price performance, these ETFs can act as a hedge, potentially mitigating risks inherent in other asset classes.\n\nRegulatory compliance: Ethereum ETFs operate under established financial regulations, which can be a huge confidence booster. It\u2019s a way of ensuring you\u2019re not diving into murky waters.\n\nLiquidity: Ethereum ETFs enjoy the advantage of being traded on well-established stock exchanges. This means investors can easily buy or sell their shares, capitalizing on market trends and ensuring ease of entry and exit.\n\nDisadvantages of Ethereum ETFs\n\nCounterparty risk: Every investment has risks. With Ethereum ETFs, there\u2019s the looming shadow of issuer credit risk. If the entity replicating Ethereum\u2019s price movements falters, it could spell trouble for the ETF\u2019s performance.\n\nLimited control: When you invest in an Ethereum ETF, you\u2019re placing trust in the fund manager\u2019s hands. Unlike direct investments, where you control your destiny, here, you ride shotgun, relying on the manager\u2019s expertise and decisions.\n\nFees: While convenience is great, it comes at a price. Management fees can eat into your returns over time. It\u2019s crucial to weigh the costs against the potential benefits.\n\nMarket dynamics: Sometimes, the ETF\u2019s performance might not exactly mirror Ethereum\u2019s market moves. Discrepancies can arise due to a range of factors, potentially affecting returns.\n\nYou might also like: U.S. government shutdown looms, creating uncertainty in crypto market\n\nHow Ethereum ETFs could impact the crypto market?\n\nEthereum ETFs are a relatively new addition to the financial ecosystem, and understanding their potential impact on the crypto market requires a deeper examination, juxtaposing the traditional ETF dynamics with the nuances of the crypto landscape.\n\nETFs\u2019 unique structure, as pointed out by BlackRock, offers dual liquidity \u2013 from the primary market of underlying assets and the secondary on-exchange trades. Translating this to Ethereum ETFs, they could amplify the liquidity of Ethereum, making it more accessible to a wider range of investors.\n\nBut liquidity is just the start. While traditional ETFs have proven not to be major influencers of market direction, Ethereum ETFs operate in a different ecosystem. The crypto market is more volatile and less mature than traditional markets. As a result, large inflows or outflows from Ethereum ETFs might have more pronounced effects on Ethereum\u2019s price, at least in the short term.\n\nOne of the principal benefits ETFs bring to traditional markets is stability. With their ability to act as \u201cshock absorbers\u201d during volatile sessions, Ethereum ETFs could introduce a new level of stability to the crypto sector, making it more resilient to sudden market swings.\n\nLastly, Ethereum ETFs\u2019 potential role in price discovery cannot be understated. The crypto market could benefit from the reflective nature of ETFs, offering clearer indications of genuine investor sentiment.\n\nThis becomes particularly significant when considering the scale of the global ETF market, which, at over $10 trillion as of June 2023, towers over the $1 trillion crypto market where Ethereum holds a substantial $200 billion share. Thus, the introduction of Ethereum ETFs can be transformative and far-reaching, influencing not just its volatility but also propelling crypto into the mainstream.\n\nThe road ahead\n\nThe green signal for the Ethereum futures ETF has sent ripples of positive sentiment throughout the crypto world. This sentiment is evident in the broader market\u2019s response, as many assets trade in the green after a period of dormancy.\n\nHowever, this newfound optimism should be approached with a measured mindset. The world of ETFs, though promising, is not devoid of risks. Especially in the crypto domain, where volatility is a given, sudden market corrections can be swift and severe.\n\nIn line with this, a golden rule in investment remains timeless: never commit more funds than you can afford to lose. As the market continues to evolve, cautious optimism should be your guiding principle.\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nMike Selig, cryptocurrency and finance lawyer at Willkie Farr & Gallagher LLP and former CFTC official, is sure that the midterm effects of Grayscale's legal win over the SEC should not be underestimated. All ETF applicants might benefit from it, let alone the Binance (BNB) and Coinbase exchanges.\n\nGrayscale case will have \"ripple effect\" for crypto, lawyer says\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission would face new legal charges \u2014 similar to those it struggled with in the Graysale case \u2014 for denying approval requests for Ethereum futures exchange-traded funds. This forecast was published by top crypto lawyer Mike Selig on his X account yesterday, Sept. 29, 2023.\n\nThe ripple effect of the Grayscale decision is massive. SEC would have faced similar legal challenges for denying ETH futures ETFs. By approving an ETH futures ETF, the SEC effectively concedes ETH is not a security. This will no doubt impact the Coinbase and Binance litigation. \u2014 Mike Selig (@MikeSeligEsq) September 29, 2023\n\nThat's why the \"ripple effect\" of Grayscale's legal triumph can be massive for many actors of cryptocurrency markets. This is also crucial in the context of the Ethereum security status debate, he added.\n\nBy approving Ethereum futures ETF, the SEC effectively concedes that Ether, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain and the second-largest digital asset, is not a security.\n\nBesides Ethereum ETF progress, the U.S. Court verdict on the Grayscale v. SEC case will also affect the dynamics of the Coinbase and Binance (BNB) legal dramas.\n\nIn August 2023, a U.S. asset management heavyweight Grayscale scored an epic win over the U.S. SEC. The judge ruled that the SEC failed to provide a sufficient rationale for approving futures products while rejecting Grayscale's spot BTC ETF offering.\n\nNew generation of Ethereum futures ETFs kicks off\n\nAt the same time, the SEC postponed deadlines for all Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs approvals. As of today, Bitwise, Grayscale, 21Shares, Ark, Valkyrie, WisdomTree and other asset managers are waiting for the watchdog's verdicts.\n\nIn the meantime, the firms are launching new exchange-traded funds (ETFs) based on Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) futures. In the last days, Grayscale and Bitwise filed for futures-based ETF products releases.\n\nA new wave of investing products might go live as soon as Monday, Oct. 2, 2023, as covered by U.Today previously."

Bitwise stated that this move will enable investors to access Chicago Mercantile Exchange Ether futures.\n\nThe firm\u2019s chief investment officer, Matt Hougan, said:\n\n\u201cEthereum offers a more extensive portfolio opportunity compared to Bitcoin. Some investors view Ethereum as an alternative, while others perceive it as a conventional growth investment, encompassing attributes of both.\u201c\n\nNumerous companies awaiting approval for a spot Bitcoin ETF have also entered the Ethereum ETF race.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nIllustration by Mitchell Preffer for Decrypt.\n\nWith each passing week, it\u2019s getting easier to talk about crypto\u2019s relative stability compared to its performance in recent history\u2014even just a year ago. A cursory glance at some of the headlines of this column over the year reveals we\u2019ve had more slow news weeks than otherwise in 2023.\n\nHowever, we\u2019ve still come a long way since New Year\u2019s Day, when market leader Bitcoin (BTC) sold for roughly $16.5K. The world\u2019s favorite cryptocurrency begins the last weekend of September at a significantly higher price: $26,972. While that's only 2% higher than last week, it's about 60% more valuable than at the start of the year.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe market\u2019s biggest contender, Ethereum (ETH), added 4.7% over the last seven days and currently trades for $1,672, or about 40% higher than its New Year's Day price of $1,200.\n\nThis week, the added boost to Ether\u2019s price likely had something to do with the fact that VanEck\u2019s Ethereum Futures Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) was officially confirmed on Thursday.\n\nETFs are regulated investment products that allow investors to gain exposure to crypto without the risks of directly purchasing and storing it. To date, not a single crypto spot ETF has been approved by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). That\u2019s because spot ETFs are tied to the underlying assets, which are so far unregulated, but various Bitcoin and Ethereum futures ETFs that utilize derivatives are currently trading.\n\nOn Thursday, the SEC delayed delivering a verdict on two pending Ethereum spot ETF applications until after Christmas: Ark Invest and VanEck. The agency also announced that it was putting four major Bitcoin spot ETFs on the backburner: BlackRock, Bitwise, Invesco Galaxy Digital, and Valkyrie.\n\nThe only notable price movements among the thirty biggest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization this week were those of Bitcoin Cash (BCH), which rallied 11.8% to $234.13, and Chainlink (LINK), which surged 14% to $7.72.\n\nLINK\u2019s rally was catalyzed by the news that the network has extended cross-chain capabilities to Coinbase\u2019s Ethereum layer-2 network Base. By integrating its Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) with Base, the two networks can now interact, send messages, transfer tokens, and perform other functions. Chainlink is also the primary oracle for the Base network.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn other news...\n\nIt was another slow week with relatively few political or institutional developments vis-\u00e0-vis crypto regulation and adoption.\n\nOn Monday, Hong Kong\u2019s Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) announced new measures to enhance transparency and security in the cryptocurrency space. The initiative comes as authorities in the semi-autonomous city-state grapple with the JPEX incident: a case of suspected fraud involving a Dubai-based crypto exchange operating in Hong Kong\u2019s turf without licensing.\n\nThere are thought to be at least 2,305 victims of the incident, who collectively have been defrauded of HK$1.43 billion ($182.9 million), making JPEX one of the largest cases of financial fraud in Hong Kong history.\n\nFinally, Stablecoin issuer Circle launched its fiat-backed euro-pegged EURC stablecoin on Stellar, the third blockchain to host the coin after Ethereum and Avalanche."

Seyffart also speculates that the VanEck Ethereum ETF might launch in the upcoming week, given that the asset manager has filed an updated prospectus.\n\nEric Balchunas, a Bloomberg analyst, responded to Seyffart's conjecture that since the document says 60 days after filing, a Monday launch might be possible, but this remains speculation.

He favored tightly integrating some protocols, like ERC-4337 account abstraction, but adopting others, like mempools, requires more discretion.\n\nButerin noted that each integration proposal involves balancing centralization risks, development flexibility, and performance advantages. He concluded that protocol changes must evaluate these factors on a case-by-case basis as priorities shift over time.\n\nAlso read: Paradigm Accuses SEC of \u201cCircumventing Rulemaking\u201d in Binance Case\n\nVitalik Buterin raised concerns about liquid staking concentration\n\nThe co-founder also expressed concerns about the concentration of liquid staking in Ethereum\u2019s proof-of-stake model. He highlighted that leading providers Lido and Rocket Pool collectively represent over 32% of the staked ETH supply.\n\nWhile acknowledging safeguards adopted by dominant liquid staking firms, Buterin suggested further decentralization mechanisms could strengthen network security. Rather than relying solely on ethical pressures, he proposed ideas like protocol tweaks to diversify staking participation.\n\nButerin\u2019s viewpoints provide valuable insights into the Ethereum developer community\u2019s assessment of potential upgrades to the network\u2019s architecture. With the vision of decentralization, Buterin seeks to bring in notable alterations to the Ethereum network."

This looks very healthy.\n\nI think this is one of the few where you\u2019ll be able to blindly buy dips for in the coming weeks.\u201d\n\nLooking at his chart, the trader seems to think that INJ is in an uptrend and can eventually retest the resistance level at $9.88 first and then $14.\n\nInjective is trading for $7.50 at time of writing, up 3.3% in the last 24 hours.\n\nThe trader also weighs in on Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), predicting the largest crypto assets will likely soon see a significant upswing based on a historical pattern.\n\n\u201cSeasonality is really important to look for in crypto. BTC and ETH traditionally do extremely well sometime in Q4 or Q1 the following year.\n\nIt makes sense, people sell their stuff in December and then rebuy it in January. This happens even in the worst bear markets.\u201d\n\nLooking at his chart, the trader identifies the times when he believes BTC followed the seasonal sell-off and rally pattern with the last two surges occurring in late 2022 and early 2023.\n\nBitcoin is trading for $26,904 at time of writing, down 0.7% in the last 24 hours.\n\nThe trader is also looking at the seasonality of Ethereum, predicting an ETH rally in the coming months.\n\n\u201cETH is really pronounced as well. Sometimes the rally comes in December, sometimes in January\u2026sometimes in November.\n\nBut usually, it\u2019s a strong rally that lasts about one month and we get some mini altcoin runs during those times. I\u2019ll be longing hard in November personally.\u201d\n\nEthereum is trading for $1,666 at time of writing, up 0.5% in the last 24 hours.\n\nLastly, the trader says Solana is retesting a key resistance level but it remains unclear if SOL will succeed in flipping it into support.\n\n\u201cSOL: not a great spot to buy here in my opinion, [retesting] the 200-day EMA (exponential moving average) on the 4-hour [chart], but I think it\u2019s going to be really interesting to see where the next high is set. Could be a market structure shift if we get a higher high on the 4-hour [chart]. Watching but not excited yet.\u201d\n\nBased on his chart, the trader seems to think a bullish scenario would send SOL to the $21 range before a dip, while his bearish scenario has SOL revisiting the low $17 range.\n\nSolana is trading for $20.24 at time of writing, up 2.7% in the last 24 hours.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

It\u2019s likely that some or all of them are just not going to bother.\u201d\n\nAccording to Seyffart, the reason the ETFs are likely launching early is due to the fear of a looming government shutdown.\n\nLast month, global investment manager VanEck announced that it\u2019s preparing to roll out its ETH futures ETF, which the company stated would not be investing in Ethereum itself but rather in standardized, cash-settled ETH futures contracts traded on registered commodity exchanges.\n\nAt the time, VanEck said that the fund \u2013 which will be listed on the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) \u2013 intends only to invest in ETH futures traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.\n\nAlso in September, VanEck released a statement saying that they expect \u201ceffectiveness to occur upon the earlier of October 3, 2023, or the time at which the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) accelerates [the] effectiveness of the registration statement.\u201d\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Ethereum recently completed a community event, ACDE 171, discussing how to bring several transformative elements that could shape the future of the network, possibly bolstering security and privacy.\n\nThe event covered several broad topics, including Dencun Devnets, extensive audits, the much-awaited launch of Holesky, a pioneering proposal for private ETH transfers, and significant changes to the EIP-6780 specification.\n\nThe Enhancement of Privacy and Security\n\nTim Beiko, a popular member of the Ethereum community, gave a detailed recap of these events on X. The topics he highlighted include the development of devnet-9, the focus on blob transaction gossip, audits of the EIP-4788 contract bytecode, and the relaunch of Holesky.\n\nPer the X posts, the event\u2019s highlight was the introduction of EIP-7503, a proposition that, according to Beiko, will redefine private transfers on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nThe authors of EIP 7503 were allowed to present the idea. According to Ethereum\u2019s documentation, EIP 7503 was discovered when the developers were exploring ways to offer more privacy and applications of ZKP.\n\nEIP-7501 introduces a new approach called \u201cBurn and Remint,\u201d which allows private transfers by burning and reminting ETH. By burning, individuals send the ETH to an unspendable address \u201cand later build a ZK proof showing that some amount of tokens has been burnt in a transaction in an older block, without revealing the transaction.\u201d The merger of ZKP, in this case, is designed to enhance privacy and security.\n\nBeiko also shed some light on the audits for the EIP-4788 contract bytecode. It was reported that three independent auditors, including ChainSecurity, Dedaub, and Trail of Bits, have been contracted to scrutinize it. Representatives from both ChainSecurity and Dedaub confirmed on a call that no other issues were identified beyond those mentioned in the initial review.\n\nAuditors reviewed changes, such as explicitly dealing with 0 being passed as a timestamp and changing the buffer length to be 100% used regardless of block time, and found no problems with the fixes. However, they highlighted two aspects that users of the beacon roots contract should be aware of.\n\nOther Minor Issues Noted\n\nDevnet 9 was also a matter of question at the event, and Beiko reported that the teams are already preparing and working to navigate various test cases. Other Devnets, which will be short-lived for testing purposes, were discussed.\n\nFurthermore, a small proposed change under EIP-6780 would deactivate SELFDESTRUCT, except in the same transaction as contract creation.\n\nThe Execution Layer Meeting 171 comes just two weeks after Meeting 170, which was held on Sept. 14. As per the reports, the new ACDE meeting is scheduled for Oct. 12 at 14:00 UTC."

Also, influential Ethereans saw the demonstration of zero-knowledge wormholes, a cutting-edge privacy concept for all of Ethereum (ETH).\n\nHolesky finally launched, EIP-4788 three audits, MEV Boost: Ethereum Core Devs Meeting #171 highlights\n\nYesterday, on Sept. 28, 2023, Ethereum ACDE #171 participants gathered to discuss Dencun devnets, EIP-4788 audits, Holesky's launch and a completely new private Ether transfer mechanism. A recap of the meeting was published by Ethereum Foundation's Tim Beiko on X.\n\n.@ethereum ACDE 171 happened earlier today, covering Dencun devnets, 4788 audits, Holesky's launch, a new private ETH transfer proposal, and changes to the EIP-6780 spec.\n\n\n\nAgenda: https://t.co/JHZuJtoOw9\n\nStream: https://t.co/2XToaM0ADv\n\nRecap below \ud83d\ude04 https://t.co/3hZpsxp4Bw \u2014 timbeiko.eth \u2600\ufe0f (@TimBeiko) September 28, 2023\n\nFirst, Ethereans confirmed the successful launch of Holesky testnet designed to replace Goerli. The testnet kicked off on its second attempt, while the first one failed due to synchronization on the anniversary of the Merge.\n\nAs covered by U.Today, Holesky works with the largest set of validators in Ethereum's (ETH) history and will not be exposed to the shortage of testnet ETH tokens.\n\nAlso, Ethereum (ETH) is proceeding toward Devnet 9 and Devnet 10, two short-lived testnets designed to emulate the activation of the Deneb-Cancun upgrade with Proto-Danksharding. To stress test the consensus design, Ethereum (ETH) developers will focus on the maximum number of testnet validators involved. Testing the MEV-boost mechanism will also kick off soon.\n\nEIP-4788, designed to expose the roots of Beacon Chain blocks inside the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), will be audited by three teams: ChainSecurity, Dedaub and Trail of Bits.\n\nEthereum (ETH) bets big on privacy as zero-knowledge wormholes introduced\n\nThe core developers of Ethereum (ETH) saw the demo of EIP-7503, or zero-knowledge wormholes, prepared by its creators Keyvan Kambakhsh, Hamid Bateni and Amir Kahoori. In short, this concept allows Ethereum (ETH) holders to secretely remint the Ethers they previously burned.\n\nThe novelty employs zero-knowledge tech: an ETH user can later build a ZK proof to show that some amount of tokens has been burnt in a transaction on an older block, without revealing the transaction details.\n\nAs such, in a frictionless manner, Ethereum (ETH) holders can create a privacy-centric pool of Ethers that would include the entire circulating Ethereum (ETH) supply, the devs said in the proposal."

Ethereum price is up almost 5% in the last week while Bitcoin price is up a meager 3%.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum price outperforms Bitcoin on speculation that SEC may approve ETH futures ETF sooner\n\nIt comes as firms line up to launch their Ether futures ETFs come Monday, October 2. Bloomberg Intelligence analyst and ETF expert James Seyffart and colleague Eric Balchunas have given a list of possible ETH futures ETFs set to debut on Monday. The list of nine funds will be issued by VanEck, BitWise, ProShares, Valkyrie, Kelly ETFs, and Volatility Shares.\n\nETFs set for October 2 listing\n\nThis list bases on the assumption that they are all operationally ready to go and that there will not be any last-minute entrants. It is worth mentioning that Hashdex ought to have been on the list, but then the firm\u2019s partnership with Kelly will not be happening.\n\nAccording to Seyffart, the combined assets under management (AUM) for all the nine ETH futures ETF products could range between 100 and 200 million. Balchunas has given the same estimate for the total AUM for the nine issuers, basing his assumption on the logic that BTC futures did $1 billion while ETH funds globally have 20% the AUM of Bitcoin funds. The ETF expert also anticipates that issuers will tap their client list to get as much volume or flow as they can get early.\n\nWith expectations of an announcement early Monday around 9:30 AM, Balchunas says the simultaneous premiere will be unprecedented. Specifically, having this many ETFs doing the same thing launching same day will make for a \u201cfascinating experiment and great foreshadow or undercard to the spot race.\u201d\n\nNew record as 68 ETFs launched on September\n\nAs a side note, up to 68 ETFs have launched in September alone, without including the list of nine expected to debut on Monday. It translates to a pace of more than three per day. According to Balchunas, which is a new all-time record.\n\nSixty-eight ETFs launched in September"

        "content": "Ethereum developers have launched the Holesky testnet.\n\nHolesky will replace Goerli as the main testnet for protocol-level changes.\n\nFind out how Holesky trumps its predecessor.\n\nEthereum is the most used blockchain in the world primarily due to its pioneering smart contract capabilities, making it a popular venue for Web3 and decentralized application (DApp) development.\n\nAs the demand for the network continues to grow, so does the complexity of upgrades required to meet this demand, creating the need for robust testing environments. In response to this need, on Thursday, September 28, developers launched a new test network (testnet) for Ethereum called Holesky to allow for more rigorous testing of network upgrades.\n\nWith Holesky set to replace Goerli as the largest Ethereum testnet, we discuss what Holesky is and how it improves on its predecessor.\n\nWhat Is Ethereum\u2019s Holesky?\n\nHolesky is a network designed to serve as a sandbox for future Ethereum upgrades, specifically as regards the network\u2019s staking infrastructure and other protocol-level iterations.\n\nWelcome to the world #Holesky \ud83d\ude00\n\nThe largest public testnet we've had to date!\n\n\n\nFYI: Hole\u0161ovice has two train stations, fits that we had to launch the testnet twice \ud83d\ude00\n\nphoto credits: @skylenet pic.twitter.com/wPSR4Gbhtq \u2014 parithosh | \ud83d\udc3c\ud83d\udc49\ud83d\udc48\ud83d\udc3c (@parithosh_j) September 28, 2023\n\nDevelopers named the latest Ethereum testnet after the Hole\u0161ovice train station, which is viewed as the second most important railway station in Prague, known for its proximity to the famous Hole\u0161ovice market, art galleries, and the Vltava, the longest river in the Czech Republic.\n\nHolesky is the first Ethereum testnet to ship merged and is compatible with the Shapella upgrade. The testnet is billed to replace Goerli as the main Ethereum sandbox for protocol-level changes.\n\nHow Is Holesky Better Than Goerli?\n\nLaunched in 2019, Goerli has been the main Ethereum testnet for infrastructure and core protocol upgrades for the past four years. However, as more developers piled in and upgrade complexities surged, failings of the testnet became obvious. Most notably, the capped supply of Goerli ETH (goETH), tokens used to pay for gas on the testnet.\n\nInitially designed to be free and obtained through faucets, goETH scarcity led to the creation of a market where developers looking to test changes are forced to pay to secure these tokens to test out changes, increasing development costs. Additionally, developers worried that the smaller validator set on Goerli (512,000) compared to the Ethereum mainnet (700,000) could allow for scaling issues to arise on the mainnet first.\n\nAddressing the failings of Goerli, Holesky comes out of the box with a significantly larger testnet token supply and validator set. Specifically, Holesky boasts a 1.6 billion testnet token supply and a validator size of 1.4 million. For comparison, that is twice as many validators as the mainnet.\n\nHolesky is happening soon! We crowdsourced requests for running genesis validators and created a genesis state that's 1,460,000 validators: Roughly 2x mainnet! Genesis will happen in less than a month \ud83d\ude00 https://t.co/hh9OmABjoR \u2014 parithosh | \ud83d\udc3c\ud83d\udc49\ud83d\udc48\ud83d\udc3c (@parithosh_j) August 22, 2023\n\nThe latest testnet will play a key role in preparations for Dencun, Ethereum\u2019s next major upgrade, which will introduce the long-anticipated proto-danksharding that will reduce costs for users of Layer 2 networks. Developers believe Holesky can serve as the main Ethereum testnet for three to five years.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nThe initial Holesky launch failed on September 15, forcing developers to return to the drawing board.\n\nGoerli will continue to run till early 2024.\n\nSepolia remains the Ethereum sandbox for testing DApps, smart contracts, and EVM functionality.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nEthereum\u2019s growing demand and complexity require that developers have robust testing environments to try out upgrades before launching on the mainnet. The launch of Holesky promises to meet this demand for at least the next three years.\n\nRead this to learn more about testnets and their usefulness in crypto:\n\nTestnets in Crypto: How To Use Test Networks to Earn Cryptocurrency\n\n\n\nFind out what Ethereum blobs are and their role in scaling the network:\n\nWhat Are Ethereum Blobs, and How Do They Boost Scalability?"

This meant that the probability of a spot Bitcoin ETF approval in the year 2023 is almost zero. However, the Grayscale lawsuit verdict in favor of the conversion of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into a Bitcoin ETF could turn out to be the game changer when the US SEC takes a decision sometime in 2024. On August 29, 2023, a US Court cleared the way for approval of the Grayscale spot Bitcoin ETF, rejecting the agency\u2019s argument.\n\nMeanwhile, James Seyffart, a Bloomberg analyst, shared the full list of 9 Ethereum Futures ETFs that will be given SEC accelerated approval to launch on Monday, October 2, 2023.\n\nAlso Read: Elon Musk Finally Pushes X (Twitter) Towards Profitability"

This comprised efforts in research, implementation, testing, coordination and other areas.\n\nMany \"protocol guild\" members are currently focused on EIP-4844 (\"proto-danksharding\"); according to VanEck, this improvement will reduce the cost of Layer 2s and, perhaps, move Ethereum closer to greater accessibility.\n\nVanEck noted that communities like Lido Finance, Uniswap, Arbitrum and Optimism have given back to these core ETH developers in the past and that it is now its turn to pay back to this community of ETH contributors.\n\nIn a Sept. 28 release, VanEck announced the imminent launch of the VanEck Ethereum xStrategy ETF (EFUT). EFUT will invest in standardized, cash-settled ETH futures contracts rather than directly in ETH or other digital assets.\n\nThe global investment manager expresses hope for Ethereum's mainstream adoption in the future via the upcoming EFUT fund.\n\nThe fund became effective on Sept. 29, 2023, according to VanEck; however, it is not available for trading yet. VanEck promises to offer additional updates regarding its progress.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart, the upcoming week might be crucial in the Ethereum ETF journey. A potential nine ETFs with ETH futures trading might launch this coming Monday, according to Seyffart."

        "title": "How Is Ethereum Liquid Staking Doing in 2023? CoinGecko Report - DeFi - Altcoin Buzz",
        "content": "Remember the times when Ethereum was a proof-of-work Blockchain? Well, if you\u2019ve been keeping tabs on the crypto space, you\u2019d know that those days are long gone.\n\nToday, you can stake $ETH directly on its new chain.\n\nWhat is Ethereum Liquid Staking?\n\nEthereum Liquid Staking refers to a user staking $ETH, and receiving another token in return. This token is proof that represents your stake. Said token is also known as a Liquid Staking Derivative (LSD).\n\nWith this LSD token, you\u2019re now free to participate in DeFi. You can provide liquidity, deposit the token as collateral, or even transact your token. At any time, the holder of the LSD can withdraw the staked $ETH. To do this, you exchange the LSD token for your initial stake and accrued rewards.\n\nAbove are some examples of LSD protocols. They could be custodial or non-custodial. But the main principle remains. LSD protocols help you unlock the value of your staked assets.\n\nHow Is Ethereum Liquid Staking Doing in 2023?\n\nTo answer this question, we\u2019ll be analyzing the details from CoinGecko\u2019s report here. In short, this has been growing with strength since its inception. Let\u2019s look at how that is so below.\n\n#1 \u2013 Total Staked $ETH Across LSD Protocols\n\nLet\u2019s look at the first bullish sign for this trend. As you can see above, the amount of $ETH staked on LSD protocols have been on a solid uptrend. This is since the launch of Ethereum staking in December 2020.\n\nTo add on, LSD protocols hold a market share of 43.7% for staked $ETH. That\u2019s a pretty huge number. At the end of August 2023, 11.3 million $ETH lies on LSD protocols, with Lido being the dominant player. If you want to learn more about how to stake your $ETH on Lido, you can refer to our previous guide here.\n\n#2 \u2013 $ETH Inflows Across LSD Protocols\n\n2/ Despite $ETH withdrawals being enabled with Shapella, LSD protocols as a whole experienced net $ETH inflows post-upgrade. Yet, there were heavy outflows from @Coinbase and RocketPool on several days. Meanwhile, Lido, the leading LSD player, saw daily net inflows of +18K ETH. pic.twitter.com/vUDc0icvKQ \u2014 CoinGecko (@coingecko) September 26, 2023\n\nIndeed, since LSDs have been created, many of them had large $ETH deposits. Over time, the entire sector has had net inflows. This means that $ETH deposits outweigh withdrawals. In turn, this shows confidence from the crypto space towards LSD protocols.\n\n#3 \u2013 $ETH Staking Rewards For LSD Protocols\n\nAnother bullish sign for the liquid staking trend is the allocation of $ETH rewards. From the above, $ETH rewards for LSD protocols have been on an uptrend. Naturally, you need to stake more $ETH to get more rewards. Again, this uptrend reflects confidence from the public towards LSDs.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about something else interesting in the above chart. You can see that Lido\u2019s $stETH (in teal) is losing dominance. It\u2019s still the market leader though, but its competitors are catching up. This means the space is heating up. Hey, competition\u2019s good for us right? With competition comes innovation, and the space can progress as a whole.\n\n#4 \u2013 Other Bullish Signs\n\nSome other bullish signs that reflect the rise of LSD adoption include:\n\n$ETH validator queues reaching highs of 45 days. In comparison, the exit queue takes 10 days. This shows interest in $ETH staking in general, including that from LSD protocols.\n\nYields from staking $ETH on LSD protocols are expected to decrease. This reflects the increased interest of $ETH staking in general as well. With more people and protocols staking $ETH, yields will naturally decrease.\n\nThe amount of staking fees earned from LSD protocols is on an uptrend. LSD protocols charge a fee when you stake your $ETH with them. Since they\u2019re earning more, this shows that the amount of $ETH staked with them is growing.\n\nFor sure, the signs are clear that Ethereum Liquid Staking is growing. In the next section, we take a look at some projects that are leveraging this trend.\n\nLSDFi Projects \u2013 What Are They?\n\nLSDFi projects focus on the LSD niche. Usually, they use DeFi to increase the value of LSD tokens. In the tweet below, you can see who are the leading LSDFi projects, by Total Value Locked (TVL).\n\n5/ Total Value Locked (TVL) in LSDFi protocols grew 5,870% (58.7X) since January 2023 and has reached $919.3M at the end of August 2023. \ud83d\udcc8 The Top 10 LSDFi Protocols by TVL \ud83d\udc47 pic.twitter.com/53htX8AHmY \u2014 CoinGecko (@coingecko) September 26, 2023\n\nAs you can see, LSDFi projects are gaining adoption as well. That\u2019s because they\u2019re building on a growing trend. In turn, LSDFi could turn out to be a strong niche in today\u2019s crypto market too!\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in learning more about LSDFi projects, we\u2019ve shortlisted some great ones here.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe answer\u2019s clear. Ethereum Liquid Staking is growing with strength. Despite this bear market, we can still tell that many are confident in the future of Ethereum. Aside from that, it\u2019ll be wise to keep tabs on the LSD and LSDFi landscape. As this is a pretty new niche, there are plenty of opportunities to earn yield or to scoop up some gems.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe information discussed by Altcoin Buzz is not financial advice.

After years of building and putting in collective efforts, the first public ISC chain on a network that has an actual token, the Shimmer EVM, was birthed.\n\nShimmer, a network with token SMR created to advance major innovations in IOTA, took to X to announce the historic milestone. \"Fully EVM-Compatible Smart Contracts are now available in the public ShimmerEVM chain. the first step to programmability on Shimmer and IOTA,\" it stated in a tweet.\n\nIOTA cofounder Dominik Schiener is excited about the possibilities brought about by this new chain, taking to X to celebrate the milestone of Shimmer becoming an \"L1 network with real utility and a thriving ecosystem.\"\n\nSchiener spoke more about the new Ethereum-compatible chain, describing it as \"fully EVM-compatible to support DeFi, GameFi, and IOTA's push in the market.Now we work together to grow it into one of the largest Web3 ecosystems.\"\n\nMore on Shimmer EVM chain\n\nAs stated in a blog post, the ShimmerEVM chain is the first in a multichain environment, allowing the processing of smart contracts as well as bridgeless L2 cross-chain value transfers.\n\nUsers would be able to send their SMR tokens and, in the future, NFTs and custom Native Assets to the ShimmerEVM through Firefly with no special bridge needed.\n\nThis initial chain should pave the way for more chains to emerge. ShimmerEVM operates on the most recent version of ISC and hence inherits all of its features.\n\nThe new ShimmerEVM initially launched as a public chain, but over time, the IOTA Foundation will hand over the reins of control of the chain to the community. To decentralize the chain further, a supermajority of validators will gradually be given to the community."

They are designed to unlock new \"crypto-based\" investing opportunities for users who hold no \"physical\" crypto, amid increased regulatory uncertainty.\n\nBitwise introduces two Ethereum (ETH) futures ETFs: Details\n\nBlue-chip U.S. asset management heavyweight Bitwise introduced two new products today. Bitwise Ethereum Strategy ETF (AETH) and the Bitwise Bitcoin and Ether Equal Weight Strategy ETF (BTOP) are set to go live on Monday, Oct. 2, 2023.

Read the full press release here: https://t.co/73FvSKgfwu \u2014 Bitwise (@BitwiseInvest) September 29, 2023\n\nIn order to get new products registered, Bitwise just filed with the SEC two Form 8-As.

The Bitwise Bitcoin and Ether Equal Weight Strategy ETF (BTOP) will be able to invest with equal exposure to regulated CME Bitcoin futures and CME Ether futures.\n\nFor both products, Bank of New York Mellon was chosen as the custody provider, with a cumulative expense ratio of 0.85%.\n\nAs covered by U.Today previously, Bitwise also submitted an amended registration request for its hotly anticipated Bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nSegment waiting for SEC verdicts; regulator postponed deadlines yet again\n\nBitwise is among the most crypto-friendly U.S.-incorporated asset management funds. Its NYSE-traded Crypto Industry Innovators ETF (BITQ) crossed $100 million in AUM last July.\n\nThis week the U.S. SEC delayed verdict deadlines for all requests for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) spot-based exchange-traded funds. Most likely, the approval of ETFs will not happen in 2023.\n\nThe regulator postponed the decisions regarding the documents submitted by Grayscale, Ark, 21Shares, BlackRock, Invesco, Bitwise and Valkyrie, top-tier U.S. asset managers."

While Invesco is the sponsor, Galaxy Digital is its \u201cexecution agent,\u201d which will sell ETH to pay the Trust\u2019s expenses.\n\nThis marks the fourth Ethereum spot ETF application to land in the SEC\u2019s mailbox in recent weeks, following similar filings from Ark Invest/21Shares, VanEck, and Hashdex earlier this month.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe industry has maintained that a spot ETF is the next logical milestone for crypto investment in the U.S. now that an Ethereum futures product looks all but guaranteed to launch next week.\n\nVanEck and Valkyrie have already been approved this week, but Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart noted they could be joined by Bitwise, ProShares, Hashdex, and Volatility Shares in launching as early as Monday, October 2.\n\nInitially Valkyrie announced its Ethereum ETF would start trading on Friday. But the firm ran into trouble with the SEC for purchasing Ether futures contracts before it released the news. It has since agreed to unwind its current position in ETH futures and will repurchase contracts only after the fund goes live next week.\n\nThe plot thickens, Valkyrie just put out 497 that they are in fact not going to buy Ether futures until they are live (prob Tue) and are going to sell the Eth futures they bought (in an effort to jump line a bit).

According to Beiko, there was an All Core Developer Execution (ACDE) meeting. During the meeting, participants talked about various subjects and added some touches to the already-existing development.\n\nTo test that, and to have a devnet with a large enough validator count to trigger EIP-7514, we\u2019ll launch a short-lived devnet-10 after devnet-9.

This is the execution layer, which oversees smart contract execution, and the consensus layer, centered on blockchain consensus via staking.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-2024\n\nNo more troubles\n\nBeiko mentioned that there were some audits for the EIP-4788 contract during the meeting. For context, the EIP-4788 is the hash tree root in the Beacon Chain that allows verification of data from the consensus layer.\n\nTwo weeks ago, Beiko also shared some updates regarding the Dencun upgrade. But as of then, he focused on improving validator schemes and deploying nodes.\n\nThis time, the developer gave more information on the changes made which are also vital to the Beacon Chain users. He mentioned that the changes would allow contracts on the Beacon roots to be future-proof against block times. Beiko confirmed that other development firms apart from the Ethereum Foundation mentioned that there were no new issues with the contract.\n\n\u201cBoth ChainSecurity and Dedaub had representatives on the call and confirmed that no other issues had been brought up since the two mentioned in the initial review, which we covered previously.\u201d\n\nNext up is a difficult discussion\n\nFurthermore, Beiko mentioned that there were other activities that included testing the MEV-Boost. Known as the Maximal Extractable Value, the MEV-Boost is a middleware developed to allow validators to request blocks from a network of builders.\n\nHowever, Beiko mentioned that a large number of validators, development, and networking specialists to get the Boost to function on the Ethereum Mainnet as desired.

Also, some were not sure if the functionality is something that Ethereum should have.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s ETH\u2019s market cap in BTC terms\n\nFollowing the indecisiveness, the developers agreed to have their next ACDE meeting on 12 October at 14:00 UTC."

        "content": "Asset managers keep pursuing digital asset products, with Invesco and Galaxy Digital reportedly filing for a spot Ether (ETH) exchange-traded fund (ETF) on Sept. 29.\n\nBloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart disclosed the filing on X (formerly Twitter), even though the application hadn\u2019t been uploaded to the SEC\u2019s public database at the time of writing.\n\nInvesco Galaxy just filed for a spot Ether ETF, I think this is the 3rd of 4th one of these, have to check tho.. pic.twitter.com/SIJVu8VzFk \u2014 Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) September 29, 2023\n\nA spokesperson for Invesco declined to confirm the application, stating that products still being registered cannot be commented on. Cointelegraph reached out to Galaxy but did not immediately receive a response.\n\nWith the Sept. 29 filing, Invesco and Galaxy join a growing line of investment managers seeking regulatory approval for a spot ETH ETF. On Sept. 27, the SEC delayed decisions on previous applications from ARK 21Shares and VanEck, extending the deadline until Dec. 25\u201326. \u201cThe Commission finds it appropriate to designate a longer period within which to take action on the proposed rule change so that it has sufficient time to consider the proposed rule change and the issues raised therein,\u201d said the SEC.\n\nAlthough a spot Ether ETF may not be available for a while, futures-based Ether ETFs should be available as soon as next week. On Sept. 28, investment firms started gearing up to add ETH futures vehicles to their portfolios. VanEck, for instance, published a statement about its upcoming Ethereum Strategy ETF \u2014 tickered EFUT \u2014 which will be listed on the Chicago Board Options Exchange in the coming days.\n\nAnother company debuting a futures crypto ETF is Valkyrie. The asset manager will begin offering exposure to Ether futures through its existing Bitcoin Strategy ETF, now rebranded as Valkyrie Bitcoin and Ether Strategy ETF. A Valkyrie spokesperson told Cointelegraph that the firm\u2019s Bitcoin Strategy ETF will allow investors access to Ether and Bitcoin (BTC) futures \u201cunder one wrapper.\u201d\n\nLikewise, Bitwise submitted an updated prospectus for their equal-weight Bitcoin and Ether futures ETF on Sept. 28, which is also expected to go live next week. According to Seyffart, Proshares also applied and Kelly ETFs partnered with Hashdex to deliver futures Ether ETFs in the coming days.\n\nEther is trading in the green at the time of writing at $1,666, driven by euphoria over the debut of futures ETFs.\n\nMagazine: Are DAOs overhyped and unworkable?

        "content": "Bitcoin BTC/USD was consolidating during Friday\u2019s 24-hour trading session after the Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) Price Index report showed core PCE for August cooled to its lowest point since September 2021.\n\nEthereum and Dogecoin were trading slightly stronger than Bitcoin, rising above Thursday\u2019s high-of-day, while Bitcoin formed an inside bar pattern.\n\nAn inside bar pattern indicates a period of consolidation and is usually followed by a continuation move in the direction of the current trend.\n\nAn inside bar pattern has more validity on larger time frames (four-hour chart or larger). The pattern has a minimum of two candlesticks and consists of a mother bar (the first candlestick in the pattern) followed by one or more subsequent candles. The subsequent candle(s) must be completely inside the range of the mother bar, and each is called an \"inside bar.\"\n\nA double, or triple inside bar can be more powerful than a single inside bar. After the break of an inside bar pattern, traders want to watch for high volume for confirmation the pattern was recognized.\n\nWant direct analysis? Find me in the BZ Pro lounge! Click here for a free trial.\n\nThe Bitcoin Chart: Bitcoin regained the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) on Thursday, which has been acting as heavy resistance since July 26. On Friday, the stock was consolidating above the 50-day SMA and forming an inside bar, which is bullish for price action over the weekend.\n\nBullish traders want to see Bitcoin break up from Thursday\u2019s mother bar on higher-than-average volume, which could confirm a new uptrend. If that happens, the crypto is likely to find resistance at the 200-day SMA.\n\nBearish traders want to see big bearish volume come in and knock Bitcoin back under the 50-day, which would suggest Thursday\u2019s price action was a bull trap and the downtrend will continue.\n\nBitcoin has resistance above at $27,133 and at $28,690 and support below at $25,772 and at $24,206.\n\nLike Bitcoin, Ethereum and Dogecoin have been unable to negate their downtrends with the formation of either a higher high or a higher low. If the cryptos retrace over the weekend but hold above the moving averages that were mentioned, higher lows will form, which would set Ethereum and Dogecoin into possible uptrends.\n\nEthereum has resistance above at $1,717 and at $1,825 and support below at $1,615 and at $1,564.\n\nDogecoin has resistance above at $0.061 and at $0.065 and support below at 6 cents and at the $0.057 mark.\n\nRead Next: EXCLUSIVE: Yusko Calls Out Warren Buffett, 'The Reason Warren Wants To P--- On Bitcoin Is...'\n\nPhoto: Shutterstock"

        "content": "The crypto market turned bullish on Thursday as traders capitalized on the hype growing around exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Ethereum price repositioned itself above $1,600 support and climbed sharply toward $1,700 but stalled on hitting $1,670.\n\nThe second-largest crypto is up 3% on Friday to $1,648, with $12.2 billion in trading volume streaming in, although its market capitalization still hovers slightly below the $200 billion mark.\n\nadvertisement\n\nValkyrie\u2019s Application To Seek Exposure To Ethereum Futures Contracts Approved\n\nValkyrie, the company specializing in alternative asset management with a focus on the intersection of the cryptocurrency market and traditional finance, has received the green light to start seeking exposure to Ether futures contracts within its operational Bitcoin futures ETF product.\n\n\u201cToday, the Valkyrie Bitcoin Strategy ETF (Nasdaq: $BTF) began adding exposure to Ether futures contracts, making it the first US ETF to provide exposure to Ether and Bitcoin futures contracts under one wrapper,\u201d a spokesperson said in a written statement to CoinDesk.\n\nAccording to the spokesperson, Valkyrie beat other investment firms in the race to offer ETH futures ETF because it \u201csupplemented its prospectus and updated risk disclosures related to Ether futures.\u201d\n\nThis new approval means that Valkyrie will offer the two distinct futures contracts in one ETF product starting October 3. The product\u2019s name will change to Valkyrie Bitcoin and Ether Strategy ETF, and trade under the same ticker BTF.\n\nMeanwhile, another asset management firm, VanEck confirmed on Thursday the imminent launch of its VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF (EFUT).\n\n\u201cThe Fund will invest in standardized, cash-settled ETH futures contracts traded on commodity exchanges registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC),\u201d VanEck via a press release.\n\nShares of the actively managed fund will trade on the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE). However, VanEck did not say when exactly the listing will take place.\n\nNEW: Ether futures ETFs could be trading as early as Tuesday as SEC looks to speed things up in order to get it done bf looming shutdown, just like they sped up delays on spot bitcoin ETFs. If so, issuers likely in mad scramble as we speak to update docs.

There have been frequent dips below $1,600 support where ETH has tested support areas at $1,530 (a price level seen last in March) and the most recent support at $1,564.\n\nThe futures ETF-driven rebound boosted Ethereum price above $1,600, affirming the level as a short-term support but its momentum faded on touching $1,670. On the bright side, ETH holds above all three applied moving averages, including the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) (red), the 100-day EMA (blue), and the 200-day EMA (purple).\n\nA cup and handle pattern formed since the beginning of September is on the verge of a breakout likely to propel Ethereum to $1,785. To achieve this target, bulls must bring down the resistance at $1,670 (the pattern\u2019s neckline resistance) to validate the cup and handle.\n\nNew long positions should be opened slightly above the neckline with the stop loss at $1,650 or the 200 EMA currently at $1,635. The bullish outlook from the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator shows that buyers have the upper and the path with the least resistance is to the upside.\n\nRelated Articles"

        "content": "In the last seven days, Ethereum outperformed Bitcoin , rising 5 per cent to $1,673.84 as compared to a 1.66 per cent jump in the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalisation. According to experts, this was due to the increasing likelihood of Ethereum futures gaining approval from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\n\"This was a trend reversal, as the possibilities for an ETH Futures ETF getting approval became higher, leading to a surge in prices,\" said Parth Chaturvedi, investments lead at CoinSwitch Ventures.\n\nAdditionally, according to Edul Patel, co-founder and chief executive officer of Mudrex, \"This positive price movement could be attributed to Valkyrie Funds LLC, an investment manager, receiving regulatory approval from the SEC to introduce Ethereum futures to its existing Bitcoin futures exchange-traded fund.\"\n\nApart from Ethereum, almost all major crypto coins traded within a narrow range over the past week.\n\n\"It's worth noting that the SEC has postponed its decision on Bitcoin ETFs from Blackrock, Bitwise, Invesco, and Valkyrie. These delays occurred two weeks ahead of the expected deadline of 16\u201319 October,\" said the CoinDCX research team.\n\nThe market was also muted due to the rise in treasury bond rates and household mortgage rates. There was uncertainty around inflation, and the US Federal Reserve indicated that it may continue to raise rates for longer than anticipated.\n\n\"There's also a looming uncertainty about the Federal Reserve's interest rate hike, which is creating a cautious approach in the market,\" said Rajagopal Menon, vice president at WazirX.\n\nHe added that the market also looks bearish due to the possibility of a US government shutdown. Notably, if funding is not approved, the US government will shut down on 1 October, leaving millions without their salaries.\n\nIf that occurs, regulatory developments in the Web3 ecosystem may be further delayed, Menon said.\n\n\"The main event to watch out for is the weekly and monthly options expiry this Friday, with $4.8 billion worth of Bitcoin and Ethereum options expiring on key derivatives exchange Deribit. Option traders remain uncertain about the directional momentum in prices,\" Chaturvedi added.\n\nMeanwhile, Coinbase received regulatory approval in Bermuda to offer crypto derivatives (Perps) to non-US retail clients globally."

        "content": "Shiba Inu (SHIB) Adoption Surges, Ethereum (ETH) Hits New Milestone, and Everlodge (ELDG) Enters Exciting Stage 4 of Presale!\n\nDigital currencies, or cryptocurrencies, continually expand into new areas. As they do, they make headlines. Shiba Inu (SHIB) is breaking new ground in its adoption processes, Ethereum (ETH) marks a significant financial milestone, and Everlodge (ELDG) is capturing the attention of investors as it advances through its presale stages. The following article will explore these exciting developments and what they mean for crypto.\n\nJoin the Everlodge presale and win a luxury holiday to the Maldives\n\nShiba Inu (SHIB): Sheds Light on Solar Payments\n\nIn a groundbreaking move, Texans can now pay their solar panel bills using Shiba Inu (SHIB). This newfound utility emerged through a partnership between FCF Pay and Chariot Energy, a Houston-based solar energy company. The collaboration marks a significant step towards mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies like the Shiba Inu coin in practical applications.\n\nHowever, FCF Pay also clarified that this feature is only available in Texas and does not insulate users from dangers. Nevertheless, as more real-world use cases for Shiba Inu unfold, it demonstrates the growing acceptance of digital assets.\n\nAnalysts\u2019 predictions for the Shiba Inu price reaching $0.00001078 by the end of 2023 reflect the increasing interest and adoption in the SHIB ecosystem.\n\nEthereum (ETH): Celebrates $10B in Cumulative Revenue\n\nThe crypto giant Ethereum (ETH) recently achieved a mini turning point. Since its launch in 2015, it surpassed $10B in cumulative revenue. This achievement shows the incredible success and widespread adoption of Ethereum\u2019s blockchain technology, a revolutionary technology in the world of dApps.\n\nAdditionally, Ethereum\u2019s rapid growth has outpaced significant tech giants like Microsoft Corp and Adobe Inc. They took 19 and 20 years to achieve similar revenue milestones, respectively.\n\nAs Ethereum continues to grow, market analysts are closely monitoring its price. Some of them have even made a bullish Ethereum price prediction. They suggest the Ethereum price could range between $2,048.41 and $2,335.71 within Q4 of 2023, further solidifying its position as a dominant force in the crypto space.\n\nEverlodge (ELDG): Soars Through Presale Stages\n\nEverlodge (ELDG), the blockchain-based real estate platform, is making significant strides in its presale. As it enters Stage 4, investor interest grows as the ELDG native token has already provided early buyers a 90% ROI. Essentially, Everlodge offers solutions to longstanding challenges in the real estate market.\n\nFor instance, one of the most significant hurdles in real estate investment is the high barrier to entry. Everlodge is breaking down this barrier by fractionalizing real estate assets into NFTs. Through the Everlodge platform, investors can purchase and own fractional shares of hotels, villas, and more for prices as low as $100.\n\nHey, Lodgers! \ud83c\udfe1\n\nDo you know? \ud83e\udd14\n\nWith $ELDG, enjoy the warmth of passive income, monthly surprises, and exclusive club access.\n\nPlus, who can resist sweet discounts?\n\nDive into a token that feels like home. \ud83d\udc99\n\nJoin the presale: https://t.co/kIufYkD05d#Presale pic.twitter.com/9yzt5hZhul \u2014 Everlodge (@EverlodgeHQ) September 26, 2023\n\nNot only that, real estate investments are known for their illiquidity. Selling a property or extracting equity can take weeks. Everlodge addresses this issue by introducing a secondary marketplace for their property-backed NFTs. Investors can buy, sell, or trade these NFTs, providing liquidity never seen in the real estate market.\n\nThe ELDG token now costs only $0.019. What sets ELDG apart is its low market cap, which often allows smaller projects to experience exponential growth. Experts predict that it has the potential to surge by 280% before the conclusion of its presale. This surge would place it on a trajectory that could outpace even Shiba Inu and Ethereum.\n\nFind out more about the Everlodge (ELDG) Presale\n\nWebsite: https://www.everlodge.io/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/everlodge\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Sergey Nazarov: Only Bitcoin, Ethereum, Chainlink Truly Decentralized - CryptoGlobe",
        "content": "Sergey Nazarov, co-founder of Chainlink, has reignited the longstanding debate on decentralization within the crypto industry.\n\nAccording to Nazarov, the term \u201cdecentralization\u201d is often misused to attract investment rather than to describe a network\u2019s actual structure. During an interview with Decrypt, he argued that only three projects\u2014Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Chainlink\u2014can be considered meaningfully decentralized.\n\nNazarov\u2019s comments come in the wake of recent security breaches in various crypto projects, including Celsius, Voyager, FTX, and Mixin Network. He refers to these incidents as examples of \u201cdecentralization theater,\u201d where the term is used more as a marketing gimmick than a factual descriptor. Nazarov sees decentralization not just as a buzzword but as a critical security feature. He cites Chainlink\u2019s four-year track record without hacks and the secure transfer of $8.5 trillion in value as evidence of the benefits of a decentralized system.\n\nHowever, Ethereum, one of the projects Nazarov considers decentralized, is currently grappling with its own centralization issues. The Lido Finance cartel is perceived as a significant threat to Ethereum\u2019s network. Despite this, Nazarov maintains that decentralization serves as a security mechanism, safeguarding the network from various vulnerabilities.\n\nAccording to Decrypt, Chainlink itself has not been immune to scrutiny. Critics point out that the project\u2019s price oracle has a 4-of-9 multi-signature access, which could have unintended consequences in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. DeFi security expert Chris Blec expressed concerns about the lack of transparency regarding who controls these signatures. He emphasized that the potential for these signers to manipulate Ethereum\u2019s price could pose a risk to DeFi protocols relying on Chainlink\u2019s price feeds.\n\nNazarov also told Decrypt that he agrees with the idea that decentralization is a spectrum but accuses many blockchain projects of falsely presenting themselves as decentralized. He called for an end to the misuse of the term and urged both developers and consumers to focus on building and supporting systems that offer genuine security and reliability.\n\nYesterday, during an interview on CNBC\u2019s Crypto World, Nazarov explained what can help prevent another crypto firm failure ahead of the trial of the bankrupt crypto exchange\u2019s Co-Founder and former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF)\n\nNazarov emphasized that the collapse of FTX should not be viewed as a failure of blockchain technology. According to him, FTX was more of a traditional financial institution that happened to deal in crypto assets. The failure was due to mismanagement of assets by the institution, rather than any inherent flaw in blockchain systems.\n\nNazarov highlighted the importance of \u201cproof of reserves\u201d in the wake of the FTX collapse. Chainlabs is the largest provider of this service, which validates the balance sheet of financial entities dealing in crypto assets. Proof of reserves offers real-time, cryptographically verified information about an institution\u2019s solvency, which is a significant step up from traditional annual audits.\n\nWhile proof of reserves is crucial, Nazarov acknowledged that it only provides a snapshot of an entity\u2019s financial health. He mentioned that the industry is moving towards other types of proofs like \u201cproof of liabilities\u201d and \u201cproof of solvency\u201d to offer a more comprehensive view of an institution\u2019s financial standing.\n\nNazarov noted that although crypto crime has decreased, it is mainly because the industry\u2019s growth has slowed down. He stressed the need for genuine decentralization to prevent hacks and scams. According to him, many platforms claim to be decentralized but are not, which makes them vulnerable to attacks.\n\nWhen asked about the factors hindering mass adoption of crypto, Nazarov cited a combination of eroding trust due to institutional failures, security issues, and lack of regulatory clarity. He emphasized that the crypto industry is cyclical and that it\u2019s crucial for the infrastructure to be robust enough to handle the next wave of interest and investment."

        "title": "Post-Merge Ethereum Ecosystem: Far-Reaching Implications of Proof of Stake - Cryptopolitan",
        "content": "In the ever-evolving landscape of cryptocurrencies, milestones are marked not only by the value of digital assets but by the transformative shifts that redefine the underlying technology. Among these transformative moments in Ethereum\u2018s history, \u201cThe Merge\u201d stands as a significant turning point.\n\nThe Merge, which unfolded on September 15, 2022, wasn\u2019t just another upgrade for Ethereum; it was a seismic shift. It marked the culmination of Ethereum\u2019s transition from the energy-intensive Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism to the more sustainable and environmentally friendly Proof of Stake (PoS) system. This transition was not merely a technical upgrade; it was a profound reimagining of how Ethereum operated, with far-reaching implications for its supply dynamics, environmental impact, and decentralization.\n\nThis article dives into the repercussions of The Merge one year after its implementation. It explores the reduction in Ethereum\u2019s supply, the rise of Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs), and the challenges posed by the growing dominance of specific protocols. Join us on a journey through the post-Merge Ethereum ecosystem, where supply shrinks, deflation looms, and decentralization remains a critical concern.\n\nSupply Reduction and Deflationary Ethereum\n\nThe Merge brought about fundamental changes to Ethereum\u2019s economic landscape, reshaping the issuance of Ether (ETH) and setting the stage for a deflationary future.\n\nThe Merge\u2019s Supply Dynamics\n\nThe Merge, celebrated as Ethereum\u2019s leap into a greener and more sustainable future, achieved a substantial reduction in the issuance of new Ether. Prior to The Merge, Ethereum operated on the energy-intensive Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism, where miners were rewarded with freshly minted ETH for validating transactions.\n\nWith The Merge\u2019s transition to Proof of Stake (PoS), a remarkable transformation occurred. New daily Ether issuance plummeted by over 80%, from 13,500 ETH to a mere 2,300 ETH. This significant reduction reflects Ethereum\u2019s commitment to controlling inflation and managing its monetary policy with greater precision.\n\nThe Concept of Deflationary Ethereum\n\nThe notion of Ethereum becoming a deflationary asset gained traction after The Merge. The key driving force behind this shift is Ethereum\u2019s burn mechanism. Unlike the PoW era, where miners were rewarded with ETH, PoS validators earn their rewards primarily through transaction fees. Importantly, a portion of these fees is permanently burned, effectively taking ETH out of circulation.\n\nIn essence, Ethereum\u2019s economic model has evolved to prioritize the removal of ETH from circulation, creating a scenario where the supply of ETH is poised to shrink over time. This deflationary characteristic aligns with the broader economic principle that often underpins cryptocurrencies \u2013 a capped or diminishing supply.\n\nETH Permanently Removed from Supply\n\nOne year after The Merge, Ethereum has witnessed nearly 1 million ETH being permanently removed from its supply. This monumental reduction signifies the success of Ethereum\u2019s deflationary mission. To put it into perspective, this decrease translates to almost 300,000 fewer ETH in circulation than at the time of The Merge\u2019s implementation.\n\nIn the world of cryptocurrencies, where tokenomics play a crucial role in shaping investor sentiment, Ethereum\u2019s journey toward becoming a deflationary asset is a significant milestone. It underscores the network\u2019s commitment to sustainability and responsible monetary policy, setting Ethereum on a distinctive path in the ever-evolving crypto landscape.\n\nRise of Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs)\n\nThe evolution of Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem post-The Merge gave rise to a new breed of digital assets known as Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs), fundamentally altering the landscape of staked Ether.\n\nThe Role of The Merge and Ethereum\u2019s Shanghai Upgrade\n\nThe catalyst for the emergence of Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs) can be traced back to The Merge, Ethereum\u2019s monumental shift from Proof of Work (PoW) to Proof of Stake (PoS). This transition fundamentally changed how Ether (ETH) was secured and rewarded within the network. Additionally, the subsequent Ethereum Shanghai upgrade, implemented in April, enabled the withdrawal of staked ETH, setting the stage for the LST boom.\n\nUnderstanding Liquid Staking Tokens\n\nLSTs are a novel category of digital assets that represent underlying positions of staked Ether (ETH). They serve as a bridge between the world of staking and decentralized finance (DeFi). Essentially, when an individual stakes their ETH within the PoS system, they receive a corresponding amount of LSTs in return. These tokens can then be freely traded on cryptocurrency exchanges or utilized within various DeFi applications.\n\nLSTs offer a level of flexibility that traditional staked assets lack. Holders of LSTs can actively participate in DeFi activities, lend their assets, or simply trade them, all while their underlying staked ETH continues to earn staking rewards in the PoS system.\n\nAdoption of Liquid Staking Tokens\n\nThe adoption of Liquid Staking Tokens has witnessed remarkable growth, solidifying their place within the Ethereum ecosystem. At present, approximately 10.8 million ETH, equivalent to 42.5% of all staked Ether, is held within liquid staking protocols. This surge in adoption underscores the demand for LSTs and their pivotal role in expanding the utility of staked assets.\n\nKey Liquid Staking Protocols\n\nSeveral liquid staking protocols have garnered significant attention and adoption within the Ethereum community. Notable among these is Lido, which stands as one of the top LST providers. Lido\u2019s ecosystem has witnessed substantial growth, with ETH holdings increasing by an impressive 82%, reaching 8.6 million ETH since the beginning of the year.\n\nAdditionally, Coinbase\u2019s entry into the LST space with cbETH has added to the diversity of available options for users seeking to leverage their staked ETH. Rocket Pool\u2019s rETH also holds a notable position, with 450,000 ETH locked within the protocol.\n\nThe rise of Liquid Staking Tokens exemplifies Ethereum\u2019s capacity for innovation and adaptability. It has not only expanded the utility of staked assets but has also provided users with newfound flexibility and opportunities within the DeFi landscape. As the Ethereum ecosystem continues to evolve, Liquid Staking Tokens remain a prominent and dynamic element in this ever-changing blockchain narrative.\n\nLido\u2019s Dominance and Centralization Concerns\n\nWhile Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs) have ushered in a new era of flexibility and utility within the Ethereum network, concerns have arisen regarding the growing dominance of one particular protocol, Lido, and its implications for centralization.\n\nLido\u2019s Unprecedented Dominance\n\nLido, as one of the prominent players in the LST ecosystem, has seen remarkable growth in its holdings of staked Ether (ETH). Since the beginning of the year, Lido\u2019s ETH holdings have surged by an impressive 82%, skyrocketing from 4.6 million ETH to 8.6 million ETH. This staggering accumulation underscores Lido\u2019s dominance within the staking landscape.\n\nCentralization Concerns\n\nThe rapid ascent of Lido\u2019s ETH holdings has triggered valid concerns about centralization within the Ethereum network. The essence of blockchain technology lies in its decentralized nature, where decision-making power and control are distributed among a diverse set of participants. However, when a single entity or protocol amasses a substantial portion of staked assets, the delicate balance of decentralization is disrupted.\n\nGovernance Challenges and Potential Attacks\n\nLido\u2019s dominance raises a critical question: What happens when a protocol becomes a major stakeholder within the network? Centralization of this nature can potentially lead to governance challenges, where a single entity wields disproportionate influence over network decisions, creating an environment ripe for conflicts of interest.\n\nFurthermore, if Lido\u2019s dominance remains unchecked, it could facilitate governance attacks against the Ethereum network. In such a scenario, a protocol with significant influence could push for changes that primarily serve its own interests, undermining the principles of decentralization that Ethereum holds dear.\n\nVitalik Buterin\u2019s Recommendations\n\nRecognizing the need to maintain a balanced and decentralized ecosystem, Ethereum\u2019s co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, has offered recommendations. Buterin proposed that staking providers controlling more than 15% of staked ETH should actively raise user fees to deter adoption until their dominance falls below this threshold.\n\nThis recommendation serves as a proactive measure to prevent excessive centralization and to encourage a diverse and inclusive staking environment. It emphasizes the importance of maintaining the ethos of decentralization that is at the core of blockchain technology.\n\nThe Path Forward\n\nWith The Merge marking a significant milestone in Ethereum\u2019s history, it\u2019s crucial to assess the achievements and challenges that lie ahead.\n\nAchievements of The Merge\n\nThe implementation of The Merge brought forth a transformative shift for Ethereum. It drastically reduced the supply of new Ether (ETH) through an 80% reduction in daily issuance, steering Ethereum toward deflationary territory. The burn mechanism, combined with Proof of Stake (PoS), paved the way for Ethereum to become a more environmentally sustainable and cost-efficient network.\n\nAddressing Decentralization and Governance\n\nWhile Ethereum has made substantial progress in reducing supply and environmental impact, it has not been without its share of concerns. Centralization and governance issues, exemplified by Lido\u2019s dominance, have come to the forefront.\n\nEthereum recognizes the need to strike a delicate balance between innovation and decentralization. Vitalik Buterin\u2019s recommendations, aimed at curbing excessive dominance by staking providers, serve as a step toward preserving the network\u2019s democratic nature.\n\nOngoing Developments and Upgrades\n\nEthereum\u2019s journey does not end with The Merge. The network remains committed to enhancing efficiency and the user experience. Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP)-4844, known as \u201cproto-danksharding,\u201d is on the horizon.\n\nThis upgrade is poised to reduce gas fees and increase transaction throughput, addressing one of the pressing concerns of the Ethereum community. By introducing data blobs that efficiently process and store data, Ethereum seeks to remain at the forefront of blockchain innovation.\n\nThe Future of Ethereum\n\nAs Ethereum navigates the path forward, its future holds great promise. The network has weathered challenges, adapted to evolving landscapes, and remained a stalwart in the cryptocurrency world.\n\nEthereum\u2019s role extends beyond being a blockchain; it is a platform for innovation, a catalyst for change, and a beacon of decentralization. In the ever-evolving cryptocurrency landscape, Ethereum remains poised to lead the charge, offering solutions to real-world problems and reshaping the way we envision the future of finance and technology.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn the aftermath of Ethereum\u2019s momentous transition, known as The Merge, several pivotal takeaways have emerged, steering the course of this pioneering blockchain network.\n\nThe Merge ushered in a significant shift in Ethereum\u2019s history, manifesting an impressive 80% reduction in daily Ether issuance. This transformation catapulted Ethereum towards a deflationary future. Concurrently, the introduction of Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs) unveiled a new layer of versatility. LSTs empower users to engage in trading and delve into DeFi applications, leveraging their staked Ether. Nonetheless, concerns have arisen due to Lido\u2019s prominent stature within the LST ecosystem, raising valid apprehensions regarding centralization and governance.\n\nThe ascent of Lido\u2019s ETH holdings has underscored a pressing concern \u2013 centralization within the Ethereum network. The intricate balance of decentralization, a cornerstone of blockchain technology, risks disruption when a singular entity amasses substantial control. In response to these challenges, Vitalik Buterin\u2019s recommendations for staking providers aim to mitigate the looming risk and preserve Ethereum\u2019s democratic essence.\n\nThe Merge signifies not an endpoint but rather a transformative milestone in Ethereum\u2019s journey. It signifies a reduction in supply, an augmentation of environmental sustainability, and a clarion call to address decentralization challenges. Ethereum\u2019s role transcends mere blockchain; it embodies innovation, metamorphosis, and decentralization.\n\nAs Ethereum continues its evolutionary path, it becomes imperative for stakeholders and enthusiasts to remain well-informed and ardently engaged. The ongoing developments and governance decisions within Ethereum will unequivocally sculpt its trajectory in the months ahead. The cryptocurrency domain thrives on dynamism, and Ethereum stands as a paragon of innovation and change."

        "content": "Solana is making its mark once again as the majority of cryptocurrencies turn green in terms of their price movement, crypto investment products have finally seen a net inflow of capital for the first time in the past six weeks.\n\nAccording to the new CoinShares report, most of this inflow is attributed to Bitcoin, as the majority of the altcoin market registered outflows last week. But as Bitcoin starts to regain inflow momentum, Solana has continued to shine, trumping altcoin investment products with inflows of $5 million.\n\nSolana Digital Investment Products Leaves Ethereum In The Dust\n\nSolana has been on an epic run this year and has done better than most altcoins in terms of interest from institutional investors. The crypto continues to reiterate its climbing position among investors with 27 weeks of inflows and just 4 weeks of outflows this year. But while altcoins like Solana and XRP have also had inflows in recent weeks, Ethereum, in particular, has struggled to gain momentum from institutions.\n\nCoinShares\u2019 data reveals investor interest in Ethereum is rather low. Although Ethereum is still the dominant platform for DeFi and smart contracts, its investment products registered outflows of $1.5 million last week, taking its trend of outflows for the 6th consecutive week.\n\nOther altcoins like Litecoin, XRP, and Tron had no net inflows/outflows, but short Bitcoin and Multi-asset investment products also registered outflows of $1.5 million and $1.4 million, respectively.\n\nSOL price holds above $24 | Source: SOLUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nFactors Influencing The Inflow\n\nThe report from Coinshares attributes the inflows into Bitcoin to a reaction to a combination of positive price momentum and fears over US government debt prices, considering most of the inflow came in late in the week. Amid these influences, Solana has seen growth in other aspects of its ecosystem that may have attracted institutional investors.\n\nFor one, Solana has had one of the best TVL performances in recent months, overtaking Ethereum in terms of growth. Data from DefiLlama shows Solana\u2019s total value locked just reached a new high from the year at $336.77 million. This represents a growth of 64% from its $205.11 million TVL at the beginning of the year.\n\nData from Coinmarketcap shows Solana has benefited the most from the ongoing bullish momentum in the wider crypto market. As a result, Solana managed to overtake Dogecoin and Cardano to become the seventh-largest crypto by market cap.\n\nAt the time of writing, Solana has increased by 24.13% in a 7-day timeframe. Solana\u2019s current price action is approaching resistance at $24.5, which could force another downside correction.\n\nFeatured image from Guarda Wallet, chart from Tradingview.com"

A wedge pattern is a technical chart pattern characterized by converging trendlines, often signaling a potential breakout in the future. If this pattern holds, it could suggest an upward breakout for Ethereum early next year, potentially altering its trajectory compared to Bitcoin.\n\nIn contrast to Ethereum, Dave the Wave employs his own version of logarithmic growth curves (LGCs) to assess Bitcoin\u2019s long-term market cycles. These curves aim to filter out the noise and volatility that can obscure the bigger picture in cryptocurrency markets.\n\nETHUSD trading at $1,724 today. Chart: TradingView.com\n\nAccording to his analysis using LGCs, Bitcoin is on track to outperform traditional assets like stock indices for at least another decade. He predicts that Bitcoin will continue to grow in value and maintain its status as the primary vehicle for wealth creation. This outlook aligns with the growing acceptance of cryptocurrencies as an alternative asset class with long-term potential.\n\nBitcoin: Current Market Snapshot\n\nAs of the latest data, Bitcoin is trading at $28,072 with a 24-hour gain of 3.3% and a seven-day surge of 7.2%. Ethereum, on the other hand, has a current price of $1,720, boasting a 24-hour increase of 2.4% and a seven-day rally of 9.1%. These figures reflect the ongoing volatility and potential for quick price fluctuations in the crypto market.\n\nDave the Wave\u2019s analysis sparks an interesting discussion about the future of Ethereum and Bitcoin. While Ethereum may be on the cusp of a significant breakout, Bitcoin\u2019s long-term promise remains robust.\n\nCrypto enthusiasts and investors will undoubtedly keep a close eye on these developments, as the battle for dominance in the cryptocurrency space continues to evolve.\n\nFeatured image from Phemex"

        "content": "VanEck, investment manager, is intensifying its promotional activities for its imminent Ether (ETH $1,656) futures exchange-traded fund (ETF), anticipated by some experts to be launched as early as October 2. The firm has recently unveiled two \u201cEnter the Ether\u201d-themed TV commercials, indicating that its Ethereum Strategy ETF, labeled EFUT, is on the horizon.\n\nOn September 28, the commercials were released concurrently with a press statement from VanEck about the forthcoming EFUT. The statement disclosed that the ETF would be listed on the Chicago Board Options Exchange and overseen by Greg Krenzer, the head of active trading at VanEck.\n\nAnalysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart from Bloomberg ETF speculate that the commercials might signify that the launch of Ether futures ETFs is approaching faster than anticipated. Despite documents from September 29 suggesting a 60-day waiting period before the ETF takes effect, Seyffart anticipates a launch on Monday. He attributes this to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) possibly hastening approvals for such financial products.\n\nThe promotional materials from VanEck include a 15-second video with actors maintaining a deadpan expression, accompanied by unusual, alien-like background music. The message \u201cEthereum. Now in an ETF form. Coming soon\u201d is conveyed, followed by another actor stating, \u201cOh, and hodl or fork off,\u201d before concluding with the \u201cEnter the Ether\u201d message.\n\nA second, more conventional 30-second advertisement implies an impending \u201cshift\u201d and suggests that Ethereum\u2019s gravitational pull \u201cwill draw everyone in.\u201d Balchunas anticipates intensified marketing endeavors from other ETF issuers, especially when spot Bitcoin (BTC $26,960) ETFs receive approval.\n\nMoreover, Valkyrie, a financial services firm, has stated that it plans to offer exposure to Ether through its existing Bitcoin Strategy ETF. This move positions Valkyrie as one of the pioneering firms to provide such exposure amidst numerous pending applications with the SEC.\n\nSeyffart, on September 28, hinted at the possibility of the SEC approving several Ethereum futures ETFs in the upcoming week, potentially due to an imminent U.S. government shutdown. Currently, nine issuers have 15 Ether futures ETFs awaiting launch.\n\nAdditionally, the market is bracing for a marketing battle as ETFs gain approval, with multiple issuers launching similar products on the same day. This situation is unprecedented and is expected to reshape the competitive landscape of ETF offerings."

        "title": "Dan Gambardello on Cardano's Market Potential and Comparison to Ethereum - CryptoGlobe",
        "content": "Introduction\n\nCrypto influencer Dan Gambardello, founder of Crypto Capital Venture, recently shared his insights on Cardano (ADA) in a comprehensive video. He explored Cardano\u2019s market position, and technological advancements, and drew several comparisons with Ethereum, highlighting why he believes Cardano is a strong contender in the crypto space.\n\nCardano\u2019s Market Position\n\nGambardello starts by emphasizing that Cardano remains a top-five cryptocurrency, even amidst market volatility. He notes that Cardano is \u201cready to go\u201d for the next bull cycle, maintaining its market position despite bearish sentiment.\n\nCardano and Ethereum: Market Cycles\n\nGambardello draws a parallel between the market cycles of Cardano and Ethereum. He points out that both cryptocurrencies had similar first bull markets, with Ethereum reaching a $125 billion market cap and Cardano close behind at $93 billion. Both also experienced significant drops in their bear markets, with Ethereum falling around 94% and Cardano around 91%.\n\nTechnological Advancements: Cardano vs. Ethereum\n\nGambardello argues that Cardano is not \u201clate to the party\u201d in terms of technological advancements. He cites the launch of Alonzo smart contracts and the emergence of DeFi platforms like Sunday Swap as evidence that Cardano is on a similar but potentially more advanced technological path compared to Ethereum.\n\nTotal Value Locked (TVL) and Staking\n\nDiscussing the concept of Total Value Locked (TVL), Gambardello suggests that if staked ADA were considered in Cardano\u2019s TVL, it would rank much higher. He argues that Cardano\u2019s innovative staking mechanism, which allows ADA to remain in the user\u2019s wallet, should be considered an asset and included in TVL calculations.\n\nMarket Cap Projections\n\nGambardello speculates that even if Cardano doesn\u2019t reach Ethereum\u2019s $546 billion market cap, a more conservative estimate of $350 billion would still result in a $10 ADA. He clarifies that this is not a price prediction but a starting point for discussion.\n\nDeFi and Total Value Locked\n\nGambardello highlights that Ethereum had almost no total value locked (TVL) back in November 2018, just after its first bull market. In contrast, Cardano already has around a million dollars in TVL as of January 2022, thanks to the launch of DeFi platforms like Sunday Swap. He argues that this demonstrates Cardano\u2019s potential to catch up with or even surpass Ethereum in the future.\n\nThe Importance of Staking in TVL\n\nGambardello questions why staked ADA is not considered in Cardano\u2019s TVL. He argues that Cardano\u2019s staking mechanism is innovative and should be included in TVL calculations. He cites a tweet stating that if staked ADA were considered, Cardano would be second in terms of TVL with $5.5 billion.\n\nConclusion\n\nGambardello believes that Cardano is a strong contender in the crypto space for various reasons, including its technological advancements and market resilience. While acknowledging that Cardano has its flaws, he emphasizes that it is doing a great job in terms of security, decentralization, and scalability.
