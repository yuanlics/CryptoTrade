        "title": "The State of Staking: 5 Takeaways a Year After Ethereum's Merge - CoinDesk",
        "content": "Most notably, the upgrade made ETH \u201cdeflationary\u201d for the first time, meaning that the overall supply of the token is now decreasing rather than increasing. The circulating supply of ETH today is .24% lower than it was a year ago. The decrease in supply stemmed in part from EIP-1559, a network upgrade that preceded the Merge by about a year. That upgrade began \u201cburning\u201d some ETH with every transaction on the network, but ETH didn\u2019t become net-deflationary until the Merge made additional cuts to the rate at which new ETH is issued."

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s latest update hasn\u2019t quite panned out as expected, according to JPMorgan Chase.\n\nA team of analysts at the bank, led by managing director Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, said in a note late last week that although Ethereum\u2019s Shanghai upgrade in April made important changes to the network, the update has in other ways shown to be lackluster.\n\n\u201cThe Ethereum supply is shrinking and staking rose sharply (with the amount of ether staked up by 50% since the Shanghai upgrade),\u201d the note said, adding that \u201cthe increase in network activity has been rather disappointing.\u201d\n\nThe Shanghai update enabled users to withdraw staked Ether that was put up following last year\u2019s much-ballyhooed Merge, which reduced the blockchain\u2019s energy footprint by 99% by transitioning the network to proof of stake from the more energy-intensive proof of work.\n\nSince the Shanghai upgrade, daily transactions on Ethereum have fallen by 12%, while the number of daily active addresses and the total value locked on the network have dropped 20% and 8%, respectively, according to JPMorgan.\n\n\u201cWhile staking has jumped by 50% since the Shanghai upgrade, which helps to improve network security, the share of liquid staking protocols such as Lido remains uncomfortably high, raising questions about centralization,\u201d the analysts wrote.\n\nThe next major update to Ethereum is the planned EIP-4844 upgrade, also known as \u201cprotodanksharding,\u201d which is scheduled to be completed by the end of the year. It aims to allow Ethereum to process more data than it could previously.\n\nThe analysts wrote that they hoped this update would help turn the tide for activity on Ethereum, but \u201ccontinued bearish crypto forces remain a headwind.\u201d"

        "title": "Implement a CI/CD pipeline for Ethereum smart contract development on AWS \u2013 Part 2 | Amazon Web Services - AWS Blog",
        "content": "This post discusses the implementation details of an Ethereum smart contract CI/CD pipeline as outlined in a previous post, which is considered a prerequisite to the topics discussed in this post. Part 1 highlighted some of the challenges faced by a multi-developer team implementing a decentralized application (dApp) and how CI/CD can help address those challenges. Part 1 also provided an overview of all the AWS services needed to implement a CI/CD pipeline. In this post, we discuss those services in detail and the AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) stack to install and configure those services.\n\nSolution overview\n\nThe AWS CDK code in this post is built on the solution architecture from Part 1, which is depicted in the following diagram.\n\nThe AWS CDK code is available in the AWS Sample GitHub repository. The README file in the GitHub repository has instructions on how to deploy the AWS CDK stack so it creates all the resources shown in the architecture. When you deploy the stack in your AWS account, after installing and configuring all the AWS services, it will also run the CI/CD pipeline.\n\nAWS CDK project code organization\n\nThe following screenshot shows how the AWS CDK project implementing our CI/CD pipeline is laid out.\n\nAll the AWS CDK constructs are defined in the cdk-stack.ts file. The three folders, DataSyncTaskExec , ECSTaskExec , and EFSManagement , contain AWS Lambda code that supports the AWS CDK custom resources in the cdk-stack.ts file. All the various configurations and .zip files needed in the stack are in the resources folder. ShareToWin-dApp has the implementation of a sample decentralized application and is used as a base application for the CI/CD pipeline. We discuss some of these files in detail later in this post.\n\nEthereum development network: Hyperledger Besu\n\nAs discussed in the first part of this series, an Ethereum development network allows an unlimited supply of Ethers for testing and debugging purposes and therefore is widely used during the development phase. To support a multi-developer team, this development network needs to be run on an infrastructure that allows multiple developers to connect to it. The sample CI/CD infrastructure discussed in this post uses Hyperledger Besu as the development network and is installed on AWS Fargate with Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) configured as the container volume. To support the Besu network, the sample AWS CDK stack creates an Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) cluster and defines a task definition that will run a single container of the Besu image. The following code is the ECS task definition construct that runs the Besu container:\n\nlet besuNetworkTaskDef = new ecs.FargateTaskDefinition(this, \"AMB-CICD-Blog-BesuNetworkTaskDef\", { cpu: 2048, executionRole: besuECSExecRole, family: \"AMB-CICD-Blog-BesuDevNetwork\", memoryLimitMiB: 4096, runtimePlatform: { operatingSystemFamily: ecs.OperatingSystemFamily.LINUX }, taskRole: besuECSExecRole, volumes: [ { name: \"EfsBesuNodeStorage\", efsVolumeConfiguration: { fileSystemId: elasticFileSys.fileSystemId, rootDirectory: \"/\", transitEncryption: \"ENABLED\", authorizationConfig: { accessPointId: efsBesuDirAccessPoint.accessPointId, iam: \"ENABLED\" } } } ] });\n\nThere are two configuration files, dev.json and config.toml , that Besu reads at the time of starting the Besu node. Both files are copied from Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) to Amazon EFS by AWS DataSync. The following screenshot shows the AWS CDK construct of the Besu container.\n\nThe dev.json file, which is provided as the genesis file, creates 10 test Ethereum addresses. Its public and private keys are provided in the dev.json file. These addresses are based on a hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallet and are the same addresses that are configured on the dApp. The AWS CDK project provides a mnemonic string that is used to generate these addresses. These addresses are included for convenience to experiment within this solution. The GitHub repository also provides a utility in the Mnemonic-Generator folder that randomly creates a new mnemonic phrase and 10 accounts with its public and private key pairs that you can use to create your own accounts. The README file of the GitHub repository has detailed steps of how to run this utility.\n\nNote: Do not use the mnemonic provided in the AWS CDK project or any public or private key derived from this mnemonic string in any production CI/CD pipeline you create using this solution. The mnemonics and addresses derived from them should solely be used for learning purposes in a development network where no real Ethers are associated with them.\n\nStoring mnemonics and other secrets\n\nThe CI/CD pipeline requires certain security-related parameters, like an Amazon Managed Blockchain billing token, mnemonic strings for the address generation to deploy to various Testnet and Mainnet networks, and access keys and secret keys for AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) authentication. These secrets are stored in AWS Secrets Manager and the AWS CDK stack creates the following construct for Secrets Manager:\n\nlet secMgrSecrets=new secretsmanager.Secret(this, \"AMB-CICD-Blog-Secrets\", { secretName: \"AMB-CICD-Blog-Secrets\", description: \"Captures all the secrets required by CodeBuild and ShareToWinLambda\", removalPolicy: cdk.RemovalPolicy.DESTROY, secretObjectValue:{ \"/CodeBuild/BesuMnemonicString\":cdk.SecretValue.unsafePlainText(\"default mnemonic provided as part of the sample code\"), \"/CodeBuild/GeorliMnemonicString\":cdk.SecretValue.unsafePlainText(\"To be entered\"), \"/CodeBuild/MainnetMnemonicString\":cdk.SecretValue.unsafePlainText(\"To be entered\"), \"/CodeBuild/AccessKey\":cdk.SecretValue.unsafePlainText(\"To be entered\"), \"/CodeBuild/SecretKey\":cdk.SecretValue.unsafePlainText(\"To be entered\"), \"/CodeBuild/BillingTokenUrl\":cdk.SecretValue.unsafePlainText(\"To be entered\"), } });\n\nDo not use the preceding mnemonic for any purpose other than testing on development networks.\n\nIn the preceding code, only the mnemonics associated with the development network are provided; the rest of the secrets are left to be entered by the user after the AWS CDK stack is created. The AWS CDK resource only provides the placeholders for these secrets.\n\nS3 bucket\n\nThe AWS CDK stack creates a S3 bucket called amb-cicd-blog-s3bucket and copies all the files located in the resources/BucketFiles folder of the AWS CDK project on the GitHub repo. The files in the BucketFiles folder are as follows:\n\nBlockchainDevLayer.zip \u2013 This .zip file is used to create Lambda layer for the dependencies of Lambda that are part of the deployed dApp.\n\n\u2013 This .zip file is used to create Lambda layer for the dependencies of Lambda that are part of the deployed dApp. config.toml \u2013 This is the configuration file of the Besu node.\n\n\u2013 This is the configuration file of the Besu node. deploy.js \u2013 This file is needed to deploy the smart contract to Ethereum networks.\n\n\u2013 This file is needed to deploy the smart contract to Ethereum networks. dev.json \u2013 This is the genesis file of the Besu network.\n\n\u2013 This is the genesis file of the Besu network. hardhat.config.js \u2013 The CI/CD pipeline internally uses Hardhat to compile and deploy the smart contract. The networks of both Besu and Goerli are defined in this file.\n\n\u2013 The CI/CD pipeline internally uses Hardhat to compile and deploy the smart contract. The networks of both Besu and Goerli are defined in this file. ShareToWinLambda.zip \u2013 This .zip file contains the source code for the Lambda function that is created to support the dApp.\n\nCustom resource providers\n\nTo configure and run the Besu development network, the AWS CDK defines three custom resource providers. These providers are configured with Lambda functions to run at the time of creation, update, and deletion of the AWS CloudFormation stack.\n\nEFS folder creation\n\nThe Besu node requires a certain folder structure on the file system. After the EFS volume is created by the AWS CDK stack, Lambda functions defined in lib/EFSManagement folder are run that create the config and data folders on the EFS volume. The config folder contains the files that are needed at the time of running the Besu node, and the data folder contains the ledger database, key, and other files needed by the Besu node. The locations of both of these folders are provided as commands when the Besu node is started.\n\nFiles copied from Amazon S3 to Amazon EFS\n\nThe custRsrcDataSyncTaskLambdaExec custom resource is responsible for copying files from Amazon S3 to Amazon EFS via a DataSync task. The AWS CDK stack defines a DataSync task that has Amazon S3 as the source location and Amazon EFS as the destination location. The Lambda functions associated with this custom resource, located in lib/DataSyncTaskExec , run the DataSync task, which copies config.toml and dev.json files before the Besu node on the ECS cluster can be started.\n\nECS task to run Besu node\n\nThe Fargate task created by the AWS CDK stack that launches Besu node is started by a custom resource called custRsrcEcsTaskLambdaExec . Its associated Lambda functions are located in the lib/ECSTaskExec folder. The ECS task is started with the public IP enabled. This public IP is an output parameter of the AWS CDK stack and also is configured as an environment variable for other AWS CDK constructs that we discuss later.\n\nCode repository for the decentralized application\n\nThe GitHub repo of this post provides a sample dApp that is used as the basis for creating a CI/CD pipeline. This sample application consists of a smart contract AssetToken.sol in the ShareToWin-dApp/SmartContractCode/contracts folder and a Lambda function in the ShareToWin-dApp/LambdaCode/index.mjs file that invokes functions in the smart contract. This sample dApp is the same as discussed in Develop a Full Stack Serverless NFT Application with Amazon Managed Blockchain \u2013 Part 1.\n\nMultiple developers working on the same or different smart contracts are only required to upload their smart contract file (*.sol) to the contract folder in this repository. This way, they are free to use any IDE tool and extension of their choice in their local development environment and only push the unit tested .sol file to the GitHub repository to be integrated in the CI/CD pipeline. Developers should also add any npm dependencies of their smart contract in the project.json file of the smart contract code so the CI/CD can inject those dependencies at the time of building and deploying the smart contract.\n\nA .zip file containing all the code of the dApp is created and is stored in the resources/ShareToWinCode folder to make it available to the AWS CDK stack. The stack creates an AWS CodeCommit construct that creates a git repository and copies the smart contract code and the Lambda code in it. Any change in the smart contract code in this repository triggers the CI/CD pipeline.\n\nCodeBuild projects\n\nThe AWS CDK stack has two AWS CodeBuild projects defined, one for building and deploying the smart contract on the Besu development network, and the other for the Goerli network using Managed Blockchain. The buildspec files associated with these CodeBuild projects are located in the resources/StaticFiles folder. The buildspec file for the Besu CodeBuild project is called besubuildspec.yml , and the buildspec file for the Goerli CodeBuild project is called goerlibuildspec.yml . The following screenshot shows the code snippet of the besubuildspec.yml file, which we discuss in more detail.\n\nCodeBuild uses Hardhat to compile and deploy the smart contract. The choice of Hardhat is a personal preference and it can be easily replaced by Truffle or Foundry. It first gets the smart contract source code from the CodeCommit GitHub repo, then it installs all the npm packages that are listed as dependencies for the smart contract. It also installs all the required Hardhat packages that are needed to build and deploy the smart contract. Hardhat expects the various blockchain network that it needs to interact with in the hardhat.config.js file. This file is part of this AWS CDK project and is uploaded to Amazon S3 to be made available to CodeBuild. The following code in the buildspec file downloads these two files from Amazon S3 to be made available to the CodeBuild environment:\n\naws s3 cp s3://amb-cicd-blog-s3bucket/deploy.js . aws s3 cp s3://amb-cicd-blog-s3bucket/hardhat.config.js .\n\nThe following screenshot shows the various blockchain network configurations as defined in the hardhat.config.js file.\n\nThe next step in the build process is to compile and deploy the smart contract to the Besu network, which is accomplished by running the following two commands:\n\nnpx hardhat compile CONTRACTSADDRESS=$(npx hardhat run --network besudev deploy.js)\n\nAfter running these commands, the CodeBuild environment has access to both the newly deployed smart contract address as well as the smart contract\u2019s application binary interface (ABI) file that is generated as an output of the compilation command.\n\nThe next step in the build and deploy process is that CodeBuild runs test scripts that are provided in the smart contract code repository. If the test scripts fail, the entire build pipeline is rolled back and the pipeline is in a failed state.\n\nWhen the test script is successful, it takes the smart contract\u2019s ABI along with the Lambda code in the dApp Lambda repository and creates a new .zip file that is used to deploy a new version of the Lambda code. It also updates the dApp Lambda environment variable to point to the newly deployed smart contract address. The following code snippet shows how this is done in the buildspec file:\n\ncd .. && mkdir lambda-build && cd lambda-build cp ../SmartContractCode/artifacts/contracts/AssetToken.sol/AssetToken.json . cp ../LambdaCode/index.mjs . zip -r ShareToWinLambda.zip . aws lambda update-function-code --function-name AMB-CICD-Blog-ShareToWinLambda --zip-file fileb://ShareToWinLambda.zip aws lambda wait function-updated-v2 --function-name AMB-CICD-Blog-ShareToWinLambda aws lambda update-function-configuration --function-name AMB-CICD-Blog-ShareToWinLambda --environment \"Variables={CONTRACTADDRESS=$CONTRACTSADDRESS\n\nAt this time, the CI/CD pipeline is in the manual approval stage. Before approving this stage, make sure the Managed Blockchain billing token URL and Goerli-related mnemonic string in Secrets Managers are updated; otherwise, the Goerli build project will fail because it can\u2019t retrieve these secrets.\n\nThis sample code uses the Managed Blockchain billing token to access the Ethereum node on Managed Blockchain. There are two ways to access the Managed Blockchain node: via the billing token or via SigV4. For more information about these methods, refer to Using token based access to make Ethereum API calls to Ethereum nodes in Amazon Managed Blockchain (AMB) and the video Connecting to an Ethereum node on Amazon Managed Blockchain.\n\nClean up\n\nTo terminate the resources that we created in this post, run the following:\n\ncdk destroy\n\nConclusion\n\nIn this post, we expanded on Part 1 and discussed the implementation details of an Ethereum smart contract CI/CD pipeline. This entire CI/CD pipeline implementation is provided as an AWS CDK project and is available on GitHub.\n\nTry out the sample code and reach out to us with your feedback in the comments.\n\nAbout the Authors\n\nRafia Tapia is a Blockchain Specialist Solution Architecture.

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nEthereum\u2019s co-founder Vitalik Buterin deposited $630,000 worth of ETH into Coinbase.\n\nObservers are uncertain if transactions reflect a broader strategy or just portfolio management.\n\nCrypto market has been volatile recently.\n\nAny significant moves by key players can impact market dynamics.\n\nVitalik Buterin, Ethereum\u2019s co-founder, recently deposited a substantial amount of ETH, approximately $0.63 million, into Coinbase during a volatile crypto market. This move has left his intentions and strategy unclear, adding suspense to his cryptocurrency actions.\n\nButerin is one of the most well-known individuals in the cryptocurrency industry. While the cryptocurrency market struggles with unpredictability, Buterin\u2019s moves have generated interest and rumors.\n\nA Standard Transaction?\n\nData from the Ethereum blockchain scanning tool Etherscan show that Buterin made the most recent transfer into Coinbase on Monday, depositing 400 ETH worth approximately $630,000. Many in the crypto world are considering the consequences of this shift.\n\nMeanwhile, Buterin\u2019s ongoing cryptocurrency deposits follow a recent pattern of transactions, adding intrigue to his intentions. His wallet has seen significant ETH movements in the past week, leaving uncertainty about whether this is routine portfolio management or part of a larger strategy.\n\nLooking at Buterin\u2019s most recent transactions, the mystery surrounding his transfer activity intensifies. His wallet address delivered 300 ETH to Kraken, another well-known cryptocurrency exchange, in addition to the 400 ETH put on Coinbase. Additionally, 200 ETH moved from his wallet into USDC, a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar.\n\nPossible Consequences for the Crypto Market\n\nVitalik Buterin\u2019s recent actions are drawing significant attention, particularly in a volatile market. As an Ethereum co-founder, his moves can sway investor sentiment, yet his intentions remain unclear.\n\nEthereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, saw a 3.5% drop last week amidst market turbulence. Key players\u2019 actions can profoundly impact the overall market narrative in such conditions.\n\nHis activities and transactions are being intently watched by market participants and enthusiasts who are trying to determine how they might affect Ethereum and the larger cryptocurrency market.\n\nIn a recent interview , Buterin mentioned that Ethereum might be better equipped to resist government intervention, especially with the current implementation of a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism.\n\nButerin clarified that proof-of-stake offers better anonymity and resistance to shutdown attempts than proof-of-work. He pointed out that proof-of-work relies on extensive physical infrastructure and high energy consumption, areas where law enforcement has experience in detection.\n\nIn the midst of market turmoil, Buterin\u2019s recent transactions have sparked interest in the crypto community. Ethereum\u2019s one-day trading volume surged to $4.7 billion, while its price dipped by 0.6% to $1,630.61 at the time of writing, all while his intentions and strategies remain uncertain.\n\nHacked Twitter Account Results in Theft Of $700K\n\nA cyber attacker successfully breached Vitalik Buterin\u2019s official X account, resulting in a loss exceeding $690,000, as detailed by blockchain investigator ZachXBT.\n\nThe hacking method involved compromising Buterin\u2019s account and posting on his behalf, marking the introduction of Proto-Danksharding to the Ethereum platform.\n\nIn a now-infamous post, Buterin shared his intentions to release a series of commemorative NFTs from ConsenSys. Regrettably, the post included a malicious URL and was sent to his 4.9 million followers, resulting in some falling victim to the deception."

        "title": "Ethereum Funding Rate Turns Negative; Is A Short Squeeze Ahead? - CoinGape",
        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) started the week on a somber note, extending its losses from Sunday. Concerns escalated earlier on Monday as reports emerged of Vitalik Buterin\u2019s transfer of approximately 400 ETH to Coinbase, intensifying fears of further price declines.\n\nThe second largest cryptocurrency has recently been caught in a web of tight price consolidation after several rejections at the $1,650 resistance level, causing concern among traders and sparking a surge in negative funding rates in the cryptocurrency futures market.\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum Negative Funding Rates Surges\n\nCryptocurrency funding rates mirror market sentiment, signifying periodic payments between traders to align perpetual futures contract prices with underlying assets. Positive rates signal bullishness, while negative rates indicate bearishness. Ethereum\u2019s recent narrow trading range has resulted in persistently negative funding rates, fostering a pessimistic outlook as traders brace for potential ETH price drops.\n\nNotably, \u201cGreatest Trader\u201d a pseudonymous analyst with popular crypto analytics firm CryptoQuant emphasized this trend in a post shared by the firm today.\n\nThe Potential for a Short Squeeze\n\nWhile prolonged periods of negative funding rates typically suggest a bearish market, they can also set the stage for a short squeeze, or a scenario where short sellers are forced to buy back their positions to cover their losses, resulting in a sudden price rebound. \u201cGreatest Trader\u201d further underscored the likelihood of such a sequence, explaining, \u201cConsistent negative funding rates bear the potential to initiate a chain reaction of short liquidations, which, in turn, could catalyze an abrupt price rebound.\u201d\n\nWhales and Traditional Investors Prepare for Volatility\n\nIn a related development, Ethereum options on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) have hit a record high of $352 million in open interest, signalling a spike in interest from traditional investors. This coincides with rising expectations of an Ethereum futures Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) approval scheduled for next week.\n\nThis surge in open interest indicates investor positioning for a potential bullish outcome, with data from Santiment showing Ethereum whales holding between 100,000 ETH and 1,000,000 ETH accumulating just over 1 million ETH after the September 11 price dip. Afterwards, the cryptocurrency witnessed a noteworthy uptick indicating significant accumulation by big investors.\n\nAt press time, Ethereum price was trading at $1,574 after a 1.19% drop over the past 24 hours according to CoinMarketCap data."

        "title": "Ethereum Founder Vitalik Buterin Reveals The Challenges Of The Network - NewsBTC",
        "content": "The Ethereum blockchain is notable for its smart contract functionality and various other things. However, many might not be conversant with the challenges the network encounters. In a recent interview, Ethereum\u2019s founder, Vitalik Buterin, revealed the biggest of them all.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Biggest Challenge\n\nSpeaking with CNBC, Buterin mentioned that the biggest challenge that the \u201cEthereum ecosystem\u201d faces is ensuring that it builds products that provide value to its users. According to him, the last decade was test-running, but now Ethereum needs to provide utility.\n\nEthereum is known to host some of the biggest decentralized applications (dApps), including prominent decentralized exchanges (DEXs) like Uniswap, Curve Finance, and Sushiswap. The network has also grown massively to the extent that several Ethereum layer-2 networks have sprung up in a bid to scale the network.\n\nDespite this, it seems that Buterin believes that there is more to be done, even as Ethereum has asserted itself as the go-to network for dApps and other decentralized solutions. Meanwhile, ETH, its native token, is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap.\n\nButerin also spoke about how cryptocurrencies enjoy greater use in less-developed countries as people use crypto tokens to make payments and for savings.\n\nCryptocurrencies have long been touted as a hedge against inflation, and it would seem that crypto is being put to use where it is needed most. A recent report by Chainalysis showed that the highest-ranked countries for crypto adoption are being plagued with a devaluing fiat currency.\n\nThe Ethereum founder also stated that centralized entities like Binance need to take a back seat for crypto adoption to move forward. While he appreciates these entities\u2019 role in growing the crypto industry, he believes crypto needs to become more decentralized.\n\nHis reason for saying this isn\u2019t far-fetched as he noted that these entities are vulnerable to \u201cboth pressure from the outside and to themselves being corrupted.\u201d Truly, centralized entities have taken many hits this past year, which has had far-reaching consequences on the industry.\n\nLast year, one of the biggest crypto exchanges, FTX, collapsed, which had several ripple effects on the crypto industry and market. Meanwhile, the two largest crypto exchanges by trading volume, Binance, and Coinbase, are currently embroiled in legal battles against the SEC.\n\nETH price sits at $1,578 | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nThe Future Of Ethereum\n\nLast year, Ethereum transitioned from a proof-of-work consensus mechanism to proof-of-stake following the Merge. Buterin stated this move has made the network more decentralized as it is \u201charder to shut down\u201d than a proof-of-work network.\n\nHe also banished the idea that the network was heavily reliant on him, which many had identified as a weakness as the government could easily go after him to clamp down on the network.\n\nRelated Reading: What The Drop In Spot And Derivatives Volumes Means For The Price Of Bitcoin\n\nAccording to him, Ethereum has grown to become independent of him and the Ethereum Foundation. He points out how several independent applications on the blockchain have taken the workload off him and made the network more autonomous.\n\nAs to Ethereum\u2019s future plans and projects, he said that the network is focused on privacy and scaling with the help of zero-knowledge (ZK) rollups. ZK rollups are layer-2 scaling solutions that help scale the Ethereum network by moving computation off-chain, thereby reducing the computing workload on the network. It also promotes privacy, as one can verify transactions without knowing what it is about.\n\nFeatured image from Bloomberg, chart from Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "Best Ethereum Wallet in 2024 - Top 8 Ethereum Wallets - Latest Cryptocurrency Prices & Articles",
        "content": "The crypto industry has much more to offer than Bitcoin if you take your time to dive deeper. An excellent example is the Ethereum network with its native crypto, the 2nd most traded crypto whose ecosystem impacted more sectors.\n\nSo, while planning your investments for the next year, make sure that you keep Ethereum on top of your mind because ETH has been set on an upward trend and shows a strong investment potential.\n\nTo keep your ETH secure, finding the best Ethereum wallet that will serve your needs and offer you peace of mind is crucial for any crypto investor, regardless of their crypto knowledge.\n\nIn this article, we discuss the best ETH wallets to secure your digital assets, addressing security aspects, supported cryptocurrencies, transactional fees, and other vital factors that need to be considered.\n\nWhat is an Ethereum Wallet?\n\nDepending on your preferred choice, the Ethereum Wallet may consist of a software wallet or a hardware one that allows users to interact with the Ethereum blockchain. The wallet also allows users to securely manage their Ethereum account, thus performing transactions, enabling the creation of smart contracts (smart contract wallet), engaging with dApps, and many other activities.\n\nEthereum wallets are managed via a private key only the owner should know, but sharing sensitive data or poorly storing it may result in theft or fraud. Usually, the setup process involves downloading or writing down the private key, enabling users to manage their crypto wallets and digital assets.\n\nIt is important to remember that crypto wallets, either for Ethereum, Bitcoin, or any other crypto, do not hold your currencies but a pass or code that you will use to access your assets. This brings us to point No. 2: how many types of Ethereum wallets are there?\n\nBy understanding the several types of Ethereum wallets, you can securely store your digital assets, thus enjoying your journey without being held back.\n\nTypes of Ethereum Wallets\n\nDepending on your crypto management style, there are 2 types of crypto wallets: hardware (cold) and software (hot) wallets. The software wallets need a secure internet connection, rather than the hardware models, which work with cold storage.\n\nWe have to give credit to the hot ones for their accessibility and ease of use compared to the cold wallets . However, the offline ones are more secure due to their nature: they limit access to malware attacks.\n\nNow that we\u2019ve learned the 2 main crypto wallet categories, we can divide them further: hot wallets can be mobile, desktop, browser, and web, while cold wallets are only hardware and paper. Also, we recommend the complete guide to pick your cryptocurrency wallet for a more comprehensive overview.\n\nWhat Makes a Good Ethereum Wallet?\n\nUsually, there are several things you must consider before choosing an ETH wallet, but for now, we are discussing the most important ones:\n\n1. Safety: As you check all the critical terms and conditions before buying a gadget or choosing a platform, you must go through all the safety protocols the wallet follows;\n\n2. Compatibility: A few wallets still do not support ETH, so you must go through the list of supported cryptocurrencies the wallet offers in advance. Otherwise, the wallet will not be helpful in your case;\n\n3. User Interface: The best wallet for you will be the one that offers an excellent user interface that is easy to understand and provides seamless usability;\n\n4. Privacy: No crypto user wants to be required to share too much information. When dealing with crypto, you may still be a little scared by all the attacks and thefts happening in the industry. So, you might not want to share that much information about you, but only what is truly relevant for trading crypto on various platforms.\n\nTop 8 Ethereum Wallets\n\nBest Ethereum Wallets for Beginners\n\n1.

It goes without saying, but before you can start, you must own some ETH \u2013 otherwise, you\u2019ll need to buy Ethereum before you can start.\n\nCreate an account: If you haven't already, sign up for an account on the poker site you wish to use. Ensure that the poker site accepts Ethereum or the specific cryptocurrency you want to deposit. Verify your account: Some poker sites may require you to complete a verification process, which usually involves providing identification documents to comply with regulatory requirements. Access your poker wallet: Once your account is verified and you're logged in, navigate to the wallet or cashier section of the poker site. This is where you'll manage your deposits and withdrawals. Select Ethereum as your deposit method: In the cashier section, look for the option to deposit funds. Choose Ethereum or the cryptocurrency you want to use as your deposit method. Generate a deposit address: The poker site should provide you with a unique Ethereum wallet address. This address is where you will send your Ethereum to make a deposit. Copy this address carefully. Transfer Ethereum: Open your preferred cryptocurrency wallet (it could be a hardware wallet, software wallet, or exchange wallet) where you hold Ethereum. Initiate a transfer of the desired amount of Ethereum to the deposit address provided by the poker site. Be sure to double-check the address to avoid any errors. Confirm the transaction: After sending the Ethereum, the transaction may take some time to be confirmed on the blockchain. You can track its progress using a blockchain explorer. Wait for confirmation: Once the transaction is confirmed, the funds should appear in your poker site account. This may take a few minutes to several hours, depending on network congestion and confirmation times. Start playing: With your Ethereum deposited, you're now ready to join poker games on the site. You can choose from various tables and tournaments based on your preferences. Withdrawal (Optional): If you wish to withdraw your winnings or remaining funds, you can typically do so by going to the cashier section and selecting the withdrawal option. Follow the site's instructions to complete the withdrawal process.\n\nRemember that transaction times and fees may vary depending on the Ethereum network's congestion and the poker site's policies. Always make sure to check the site's terms and conditions, as well as any fees associated with deposits and withdrawals.

Here are some of the most popular choices among poker players and crypto casino users:\n\nCryptocurrency Poker & Crypto Casinos Support Poker & Crypto Casinos Use Cases Key Features and Considerations Ethereum (ETH) Widely accepted at poker sites and casinos. Commonly used for betting and gambling. Smart contracts allow for provably fair games and automated payouts. Faster transaction confirmation compared to Bitcoin. Bitcoin (BTC) Accepted at virtually all poker sites and crypto casinos. Popular choice for gambling and betting. Wide adoption, liquidity, and availability. Transactions can sometimes be slower and more expensive due to network congestion. Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Some poker sites and casinos accept BCH. Increasingly used in crypto casinos. Faster transaction confirmation compared to Bitcoin. Larger block size may lead to lower fees. XRP (XRP) Less commonly accepted, but some poker sites and casinos may support XRP. Less popular for gambling, but some casinos accept it. Fast transactions with low fees. Centralized nature and regulatory concerns may affect adoption. Litecoin (LTC) Accepted at select poker sites and crypto casinos. Some casinos offer LTC betting options. Faster confirmation times and lower fees compared to Bitcoin. Offers a balance between security and speed. Dogecoin (DOGE) Less commonly accepted, limited options. Available at some crypto casinos. Known for its low fees and quick transactions. Mostly used for fun and novelty rather than serious gambling. Tether (USDT) Widely used for poker and gambling. Commonly used as a stablecoin in crypto casinos. Provides stability as it's pegged to the US dollar. Offers protection against cryptocurrency price volatility.\n\nThe bottom line: An increasing number of online poker sites support ETH and other cryptos\n\nWhile traditional poker sites like PokerStars and Party Poker don\u2019t support crypto, there\u2019s a growing list of crypto poker sites that allow users to play poker with Ethereum, Bitcoin, and other cryptocurrencies. Crypto poker sites are mostly known for their great bonus offerings and modern software. It is worth noting, however, that the amount of traffic still lags behind some of the bigger traditional poker platforms.\n\nA similar trend can be observed in online casino and sportsbook platforms as well, which are becoming ever more inclined to support a growing number of cryptos due to their ease of use, fast transaction times, and increased privacy.

        "content": "One measure of how ETH staking has been incorporated by institutions is the difference between ETH and BTC basis (i.e., the difference between futures and spot prices) in the CME, a venue used exclusively by institutional investors. The reason is simple: Given that ETH now derives a native yield and BTC does not, the difference between the BTC and the ETH basis should approximate this yield because it reduces the futures contract carry cost."

        "content": "Ethereum holders have been subject to uncertainty over the last few months as bulls and bears have struggled for control. With the bears winning at a much higher rate than the bulls, Ethereum holders have found their holdings have continued to lose value. This time around, the plunge has sent the number of investors losing money to a new all-time high.\n\nNumber Of Ethereum Addresses In Loss At ATH\n\nOn-chain data tracker Glassnode Alerts on X (formerly Twitter) has revealed a shocking development regarding Ethereum addresses. According to the tracker, the number of addresses seeing losses on a 7-day moving average (MA) has jumped to its highest level ever.\n\nThis metric takes note of the price at which the ETH coins being held on addresses were last moved. Then it is compared to the current price of the altcoin to figure out if the addresses are seeing gains or losses. The metric had been rapidly climbing in 2023 due to the bear market, culminating in a new all-time high.\n\nAccording to Glassnode\u2019s report, the total number of addresses in loss is now sitting at 49,939,211.006, rising from its previous all-time high of 49,921,736.464 that was reached on September 15. If the price of ETH continues to drop, then this figure will likely hit another all-time high soon.\n\nNumber of addresses in loss hit new all-time high Source: Glassnode\n\nOther ETH Metrics Flashing Bearish\n\nEthereum\u2019s open interest in perpetual futures contracts had also taken a hit with the price struggles. It dropped to a one-month low $445,789,354, just weeks after hitting a previous one-month low of $450,965,900 on September 13.\n\nAccumulation also seems to be dropping among mid-sized investors in the meantime. Glassnode also reports that the number of addresses holding at least 10 ETH had plunged to a 3-month low of 347,825. This suggests that these investors may be offloading their holdings to prevent more losses.\n\nSmall investors are also not left out of this trend. Another metric that tracks the number of Ethereum addresses holding at least 0.1 ETH also showed a decline in recent months. This has led to a 5-month low for the metric, with only 5,120,950 addresses holding 0.1+ ETH.\n\nThese declines come as no surprise as the ETH price had lost support above $1,600. With the bears dragging the price below $1,600, the losses for holders had climbed rapidly as the altcoin\u2019s price fell to two-week lows.\n\nFounder Vitalik Buterin had also made transactions carrying a significant amount of ETH toward centralized exchanges. This has sparked speculations that the founder is selling, which in turn could influence investors to sell as well.\n\nETH bears take control of price | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nFeatured image from Blockchair, chart from Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nJordan Belfort, otherwise known as the Wolf of Wall Street, once dismissed all major cryptocurrencies as scams.\n\nHe has since changed his mind with regard to Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nHowever, he remains skeptical of other crypto assets.\n\nWhen Jordan Belfort emerged as a vocal Bitcoin critic in 2018, dismissing the entire crypto sector as a big scam, advocates of the technology didn\u2019t pay him much attention.\n\nOn the one hand, such claims have dogged the space for years, but have done little to discourage believers. On the other, who wants to take investment advice from a convicted fraudster?\n\nYet in the past year, the Wolf of Wall Street, as Belfort is also known, has done a complete u-turn on Bitcoin and Ethereum, although he\u2019s still skeptical of other crypto assets.\n\nWolf of Wall Street Embraces Bitcoin\n\nBack in 2018, Belfort predicted \u201cthe beginning of the end\u201d for Bitcoin. Although he acknowledged that blockchain technology would likely revolutionize the financial sector, he characterized the world\u2019s preeminent cryptocurrency as a scam and an example of the greater fool theory in action.\n\nBut these days, Belfort has had a change of heart.\n\nIn April 2022, the American fraudster-cum-entrepreneur hosted a workshop exploring \u201cthe latest cutting-edge investment strategies for all things crypto, DeFi, and the Metaverse.\u201d Guests paid to take part with Bitcoin. And the tickets weren\u2019t cheap at 1 BTC each!\n\nAs an investor, Belfort has backed a motley selection of crypto projects including Pawtocol , a blockchain-powered platform for pet owners, and the squirrel Web3 wallet.\n\nHowever, in a recent interview with Benzinga, he insisted he hasn\u2019t completely abandoned his initial skepticism. \u201cMy views on crypto were dead on, balls accurate,\u201d he claimed\n\nContinuing, he said \u201cI think I was right with most, the 99% of crypto,\u201d adding that \u201cI was wrong about Bitcoin, and Ethereum, and maybe one other.\u201d\n\nBelfort Was Once Hacked for $300K in Crypto\n\nIn a previous life, Jordan Belfort was charged with defrauding investors out of hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nBut in his new guise as a blockchain advocate, he has occasionally lost money, falling victim to the pitfalls of crypto investing.\n\nAccording to the New York Times, Belfort once had $300,000 worth of Ohm tokens hacked from his cryptocurrency wallet."

Since the Shapella upgrade of the Ethereum network, users can stake and unstake their ether (ETH) at will, significantly de-risking staked ETH from a liquidity standpoint. This has been reflected in the staked ether, or stETH, discount to ETH, barely dipping past 30 bps since Ethereum\u2019s last major upgrade. Before the Shapella upgrade, stETH was a poor collateral asset due to its illiquidity and discount volatility. Now that stETH has been derisked, we have seen it overtake ETH as the primary collateral asset throughout DeFi."

Discover SCENE\n\nIllustration by Mitchell Preffer for Decrypt.\n\nPrices of leading cryptocurrencies stayed stable over the last seven days. Market leader Bitcoin (BTC) held the fort at $26,569, more or less exactly the same price as last week, while Ethereum (ETH) dropped a slight 2.8% to trade for $1,592.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt was another of crypto\u2019s relatively less volatile weeks, which seem to be occurring more frequently this year. There were no major price swings among any of the forty biggest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization\u2014except for Chainlink.\n\nHolders of LINK found their stashes swell by 12% this week to hit $7 on Saturday.\n\nOn Wednesday, Toncoin (TON) was posting seven-day gains of 31%, but the coin\u2019s rapid rally\u2014which ran for just over a week on news that parent company Telegram had integrated a TON self-custodial wallet into the messaging app\u2014appears to have cooled off by the weekend.\n\nToncoin enters Saturday just 3.7% up at $2.33.\n\nAdoption news\n\nThis week\u2019s Fed policy meeting concluded with no new interest rate hikes, positively contributing to stabilizing crypto prices. The more difficult it is to borrow, the more people offload speculative assets like stocks and cryptocurrencies.\n\nThere were more headlines indicating that global crypto adoption is continuing apace.\n\nOn Monday, banking giant Citigroup launched a digital token service utilizing blockchain and smart contract technology to facilitate rapid cross-border payments between institutions.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOn Wednesday, PayPal announced that Venmo users will be able to purchase the payments giant\u2019s dollar-pegged Ethereum-based stablecoin PYUSD \u201cin the coming weeks.\u201d\n\nPolitics\n\nThere were also several political developments with regard to crypto this week.\n\nThe former chair of the leading British regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), confessed at a conference on Tuesday that during his tenure (2018\u20132022), the FCA faced \u201cpolitical pressure\u201d to accept several of the 43 firms currently approved to offer crypto services in the UK. He further said that \u201call the evidence\u201d suggested that it \u201cwasn\u2019t a very good idea.\u201d\n\nLater in the week, the FCA publicly urged British crypto companies to register with existing financial promotions legislation. All companies promoting crypto in the UK, whether based in the territory or not, have to make an application and pay a fee to get approved or promote their services through approved parties.\n\n\u201cWe are concerned by the poor engagement from many unregistered, overseas crypto asset firms who have U.K. customers on this important change,\u201d the FCA wrote in its statement.\n\nIn the States on Wednesday, the House Financial Services Committee (HFSC) passed the CBDC Anti-Surveillance State Act, laying the groundwork for a future vote on the legislation on the House floor.\n\nProposed by crypto-friendly Congressman Tom Emmer (R-MN), the legislation hopes to block the Federal Reserve from issuing a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) to individuals. Emmer has called CBDCs \u201cfinancial surveillance tools.\u201d Presidential candidates Ron DeSantis and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. have opposed CBDCs for similar reasons."

        "content": "Ethereum traders have been contemplating their next steps as the second-largest crypto slid below $1,600 and revisited support at $1,564. While a knee-jerk reaction is anticipated, it is not guaranteed, considering the state of the crypto market \u2013 low volatility.\n\nThe hype to buy the dip with the possibility of a relief rally has faded since June. Investors prefer to watch from the sidelines afraid of capitulation at least until the crypto market generally improves.\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum Open Interest Soars To $5.31B\n\nInterest in Ethereum derivatives has been growing over the past few days, with Coinglass showing the open interest up 4.1% to $5 billion. In total, volume is up 332% to $10.35 billion. Liquidations over the last 24 hours rekt $5.55 million in short positions and $3.88 million in long positions.\n\nIf interest keeps growing ahead of the anticipated approval of the futures ETF in October, Ethereum price could launch the run-up to $1,800 and eventually bring down the psychological resistance at $2,000.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction: ETH Set To Reclaim $1,600 Support\n\nEthereum swept through fresh liquidity at $1,564, paving the way for two bullish successive candles on the four-hour chart. Due to this rebound, a breakout from a short-term falling wedge pattern has been validated.\n\nThe falling wedge, formed by connecting a series of lower lows and lower highs using two trendlines is a reversal pattern that shows the downtrend has come to an end and bulls are ready to take the reins.\n\nA wedge pattern alone does not affect the trend until Ethereum price makes it above the resistance trendline. Traders would notice a spike in volume following the breakout as the signal to place their buy orders marginally above the trendline. It is often recommended to wait for a retest of the resistance trendline to confirm the breakout.\n\nA buy signal from the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) could boost the bulls\u2019 growing presence in the market as buyers increase their exposure to Ethereum. Such a call to buy ETH manifests with the blue MACD line crossing above the red signal line while the momentum indicator generally slopes upward toward the mean line (0.00) and into the positive region.\n\nBased on the Fibonacci levels, ETH price will likely rebound 61.8% from support at $1,564 to $1,628, especially if bulls retake the $1,600 resistance.\n\nETH Price to Make A Comeback In October\n\nMoreover, market-moving events have been scarce apart from the push for the spot and futures-based Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs). There have been reports that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is going to greenlight a futures-based ETH ETF in October.\n\nFutures-based Bitcoin ETF products have been in existence for more than two years, allowing investors, especially institutional to seek exposure to crypto without having to buy and store BTC.\n\nFollowing the approval of the first BTC ETF product, Bitcoin price rallied by over 60%. Hence, the positive outlook investors have for Ethereum price in October.\n\nRelated Articles"

He added that the exchange has implemented real-time monitoring mechanisms to prevent such losses.\n\nSun did not provide additional information about the fund. HTX has yet to respond to CryptoSlate\u2019s request for additional commentary on the fund\u2019s composition as of press time.\n\nOn Sept. 25, Sun confirmed that the exchange suffered a hack that resulted in a $7.9 million worth of Ethereum (ETH) loss. HTX offered 5% of the stolen amount ($400,000 ) as a reward to encourage the hacker to return the stolen funds, adding that the hacker would be hired as a security white hat advisor if the fund is returned.\n\nSun assures of HTX security\n\nSun further reiterated HTX\u2019s security measures in the post on the social media platform X. He added that the platform \u201calways prioritizes the security of user assets.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur multi-backup, multi-signature cold wallet system ensures 100% security,\u201d Sun said. \u201cSecurity is an ongoing commitment, and we will continually update and iterate on security measures to ensure that our users\u2019 assets remain the safest in the industry.\u201d\n\nData from DeFillama shows that HTX holds about $2.77 billion worth of digital assets, including Tron (TRX), Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum, and others."

        "content": "Arbitrum DAO needs to be careful how it allocates its $42 million ecosystem grant.\n\nBinance's gas spending spree confuses onlookers.\n\nThe debate over DAO risk management heats up.\n\nA version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Read this and our other newsletters before your friends do by signing up here.\n\nHey, Tim here.\n\nI\u2019m looking at two big onchain spenders this week \u2014 Arbitrum DAO and Binance, and how these two organisations are splashing their cash.\n\nAs Osato Avan-Nomayo explored, Arbitrum DAO voted to give away $42 million from its coffers to help boost ecosystem growth on the layer 2 blockchain.\n\nStay ahead of the game with our weekly newsletters Subscribe\n\nIn a bull market, such news would barely make headlines. But right now, few DAOs are in a position to be giving away millions.\n\nOptimism, Arbitrum\u2019s biggest rival, unveiled a surprise sale of $157 million worth of its OP token without a DAO vote, in what appeared to be a desperate bid to raise cash.\n\nThe sale \u2014 undemocratic as it was \u2014 left the Optimism community and token holders understandably miffed.\n\nIn comparison, Arbitrum is looking strong.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nThe battle for Ethereum\u2019s layer 2 will likely be a winner-takes-all scenario.\n\nLiquidity begets liquidity, and right now, Arbitrum\u2019s not just in pole position, it\u2019s dominating the competition.\n\nArbitrum Arbitrum (green) outstrips Optimism (blue), Base (magenta), zkSync (yellow) and Polygon zkEVM (red) in total value locked. (DefiLlama/DefiLlama)\n\nBut Arbitrum needs to be careful.\n\nHow its community decides to allocate the $42 million will be crucial to keeping its momentum. DAO ecosystem funding has a disastrous history of abuse and misuse \u2014 just ask Harmony.\n\nAlso spending big is Binance, but in a very different way. The top centralised exchange blew over $840,000 on Ethereum gas fees in just 20 minutes shuffling tokens between its wallets.\n\nSo why did Binance submit hundreds of simultaneous transactions and pump gas fees to insane levels? We\u2019re not even sure Binance itself knows.\n\nThe exchange told us the transactions were part of a \u201croutine consolidation,\u201d and that the impact to gas prices was \u201cunintentional.\u201d\n\nOnlookers, including Gnosis CEO Martin K\u00f6ppelmann, were quick to point out that Binance had overpaid for the transactions. If the exchange had spread those transactions out, it could\u2019ve avoided spiking Ethereum gas and paid a lot less.\n\nGas prizes spiking because of a ton of regular ETH transfers related to Binance.\n\na) they are using a really inefficient script to consolidate funds and are massively overpaying transaction costs\n\nb) something fishy is going on \u2014 Martin K\u00f6ppelmann \ud83e\udd89\ud83d\udcb3 (@koeppelmann) September 21, 2023\n\nSuch wasteful actions really aren\u2019t a good look for Binance, which has a few other problems on its plate.\n\nIf intentional, it shows the exchange doesn\u2019t care about blowing close to a million dollars for no good reason.\n\nOn the other hand, if the transactions were unintentional, it implies Binance\u2019s operations are disorganised and chaotic \u2014 which would be pretty worrying for an exchange handling over $56 billion of customer assets.\n\nIn other news, I talked DAO risk management with B.Protocol\u2019s Eitan Katchka and Synthetix Spartan Council member Millie.\n\nB.Protocol wants to help fledgling DAOs better manage their risk with algorithms, helping create a safer DeFi ecosystem. But Millie argued that risk management requires in-depth knowledge of specific protocols and so should only be handled by humans.\n\nRisk management is super important for DAOs to get right, as the situation with Michael Egerov\u2019s CRV-backed loans on Aave recently revealed.\n\nThere are compelling arguments both for and against the automation of risk management.\n\nJoin Millie, B.Protocol\u2019s Yaron Velner and me on a Wednesday X Spaces where we\u2019ll continue the humans vs code debate.\n\nData of the week\n\nArbitrum distributed over $100 million worth of ARB tokens to protocols building on the layer 2 as part of its token airdrop earlier this year. As the chart shows, the value of ARB held by protocols has dropped about 40%.\n\nHow much of this decline was due to these protocol selling their ARB is unclear.\n\nBut it\u2019s no secret that Arbitrum DAOs $42 million worth of ecosystem grants will put additional selling pressure on the ARB token.\n\nArbitrum DAO ecosystem holdings (Dune/@shogun)\n\nThis week in DeFi governance\n\nPROPOSAL: Blockworks Research suggests changes to ATOM tokenomics\n\nPROPOSAL: Kindnesss.eth builds new token database on ENS\n\nVOTE: Aave to greenlight v3 deployment on Gnosis Chain\n\nPost of the week\n\nThere\u2019s a new top-valued Friend.tech user this week after @vombatus_eth spent almost 1,000 Ether, or $150,000, to buy 326 of his own keys.\n\nNo one really knows why Vombatus spent so much to pump the price of his key, but the event caused quite a stir on social media.\n\nCrypto cartoonist BoldLeonidas thinks Vombatus might just be following some sound advice a little too literally.\n\nWhat we\u2019re watching\n\nStill zero visibility on when season 2 will end.\n\n\n\nAnd another 49mn $BLUR ($8.3mn) was paid out to insiders (investors, advisors, team) last week while farmers wait.\n\n\n\nFarmers who bought NFTs via Blur bids have over 45,000 ETH of realized losses since Season 2 started.\n\n\n\nThe\u2026 pic.twitter.com/E9ApoYsX43 \u2014 NFTstats.eth (@punk9059) September 19, 2023\n\nAfter dethroning OpenSea as the top NFT marketplace in early 2022, Blur could be running out of steam.

        "title": "Ethereum Open Interest Barrels Past $5.2 Billion, Is It Time To Buy? - NewsBTC",
        "content": "The Ethereum open interest has been on an upward trajectory that has culminated in it crossing the $5.2 billion mark. This surge is important to Ethereum\u2019s native token ETH in a number of ways as it could point to how investors are viewing the cryptocurrency at this point.\n\nEthereum Open Interest Sees Rapid Rise\n\nData from Coinglass shows that the Ethereum open interest has risen rapidly in recent times. Over the last week, the open interest has grown, eventually crossing $5.2 billion at a time when the crypto market continues to struggle to loosen the grip of bears.\n\nOne thing about open interest is that it can point to how investors are viewing the cryptocurrency and whether they are bearish or bullish. When open interest rises, it points to investors becoming more bullish. On the other hand, a drop in open interest suggests that investors are more bearish and expect prices to drop.\n\nETH open interest jumps above $5.2 billion | Source: Coinglass\n\nThis time around, with the open interest being on the rise, it suggests that crypto investors are turning bullish once more. This reflects the Crypto Fear & Greed Index showing that investor sentiment has been improving during the same time period.\n\nThe chart above shows that the ETH price has often rallied when open interest has surged, which could happen in this case. If this holds true, then the ETH price could be looking at a rise toward the $1,700 level once more.\n\nETH Could Rally With Crypto Market\n\nThe turn to bullishness marked by the increase in Ethereum open interest is not limited to the cryptocurrency alone. Looking at the long/short ratio on Coinglass shows that long volumes have begun to recover while short volume has plummeted.\n\nEthereum long volumes are currently sitting at $574 million compared to $548 million for short. This comes out to 51.28% for longs with 48.72% for shorts. And while these differences are not especially significant, it does show that crypto investors are betting more on a recovery for the cryptocurrency.\n\nLiquidations have also shown that short traders are losing more in the market. Ethereum currently has a 24-hour liquidation volume of $6.63 million. $1.57 million of this is long positions while $5.06 million is accounted for by short traders.\n\nThe ETH price is sitting at $1,588 at the time of writing. It\u2019s seeing small gains of 0.84% in the last day but nursing 3.59% losses on the weekly chart.\n\nETH price remains volatile | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "The Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the United States Department of the Treasury has added a crypto wallet allegedly connected to a major international crime syndicate to its list of Specially Designated Nationals.\n\nIn a Sept. 26 announcement, the U.S. Treasury said it had sanctioned 10 individuals, including many tied to the Sinaloa Cartel. Among those added was Mexican national Mario Alberto Jimenez Castro through an Ethereum wallet.\n\n\u2018[Jimenez Castro] reports directly to a Chapitos deputy and operates a money laundering organization that uses virtual currency and wire transfers, among other methods, to transfer proceeds from illicit fentanyl sales in the United States to Sinaloa Cartel leaders in Mexico,\u201d said Treasury. \u201cJimenez Castro has directed U.S.-based couriers to pick up cash in the United States and deposit it into various virtual currency wallets for payment directly to the Chapitos and for reinvestment in fentanyl production.\u201d\n\nAccording to data from Etherscan, the wallet had a balance of roughly 0.018 Ether (ETH) \u2014 $28.22 \u2014 at the time of publication, with the latest activity more than 200 days ago. No other wallet addresses were included in OFAC\u2019s most recent sanctions, which the Treasury said were in response to \u201cillicit fentanyl trafficking\u201d affecting the crisis surrounding opioid use in the United States.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s actions show that Treasury and the Administration will continue to relentlessly target the criminal enterprises threatening international security and flooding our communities with fentanyl and other deadly drugs,\u201d said Brian Nelson, under secretary of the Treasury for terrorism and financial intelligence.\n\nToday, @USTreasury sanctioned 10 individuals, including several Sinaloa Cartel affiliates and fugitives responsible for a significant portion of the illicit fentanyl and other deadly drugs trafficked into the United States. https://t.co/eb5zLjmaEb \u2014 Under Secretary Brian Nelson (@UnderSecTFI) September 26, 2023\n\nRelated: Sen.

The U.S. Treasury also cited Lazarus as part of its reasons for adding crypto mixer Tornado Cash to its list of Specially Designated Nationals in August 2022. U.S. authorities arrested Tornado Cash co-founder Roman Storm in August 2023 for charges related to money laundering and sanctions violations.\n\nMany industry leaders and policymakers criticized the Treasury\u2019s actions against Tornado Cash. Six individuals backed by crypto exchange Coinbase filed a lawsuit against Treasury over the sanctions, but in August, a judge largely sided with the U.S. government in a motion for summary judgment.\n\nMagazine: Tornado Cash 2.0: The race to build safe and legal coin mixers"

        "content": "Ethereum liquid staking platforms are making waves in the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. Recent on-chain reports have revealed that liquid staking protocols have recorded a new milestone in the number of Ether (ETH) staked, reaching a staggering 12 million ETH mark in just a few days.\n\nEthereum Liquid Staking Gains Momentum\n\nWith Ethereum 2.0 thriving, liquid staking protocols in the DeFi ecosystem have been growing rapidly despite recent market volatility.\n\nResearch data from DeFi TVL aggregator, Defillama, revealed on Monday, September 25, the tremendous growth of Ethereum holdings in liquid staking platforms. According to the data, the ETH in liquid staking protocols has risen to approximately 12.31 million and may continue rising.\n\nReports uncovered that a staggering 370,000 ETH were staked in just five days, allowing liquid staking protocols to reach their current 12 million mark. Liquid staking platforms like Lido, Rocket Pool, Coinbase, and Binance are among the list of prominent protocols that led to the recent upsurge in Ether staking.\n\nAccording to Defillama TVL rankings, Lido holds the top spot for the amount of Ethereum staked with a TVL of $13.997 billion in liquid staking. The protocol secured over 8 million Ether on September 20, and another 30,000 after that.\n\nLido Finance dominates ETH liquid staking | Source: DeFiLlama\n\nCoinbase is presently ranked second in Defillama\u2019s TVL rankings, holding approximately $2.155 billion, a significant gap from Lido\u2019s TVL.\n\nCoinbase has about 1.3 million Ether presently in its reserve. Whereas, Rocket Pool holds the third position in TVL rankings and has increased its Ether holdings from 940,496 to 945,402.\n\nBinance Liquid Staking Platform Takes The Lead\n\nBinance liquid staking platform has been the driving force behind the recent spike in ether influx in liquid staking protocols in the DeFi ecosystem.\n\nAccording to reports, Binance added a startling amount of ether to its already substantial ether reserves. The liquid staking platform which previously recorded 445,000 ETH in its reserve, added 318,605 ETH and now holds 764,105 ETH. Research data have revealed that Binance amassed a considerable amount of ETH tokens to support its staking token, Wrapped Beacon ETH (WBETH).\n\nIn the last three months, the DeFi ecosystem recorded a liquid staking valuation above $20 billion evaluating various protocols in the DeFi ecosystem. Following this, Defillama\u2019s September data revealed liquid staking protocols now hold $20.5 billion in assets, increasing by a staggering 293% from previous lows in June 2022.\n\nAlthough the key protocols steering the surge are Lido, Binance, and Rocket Pool. Other upcoming liquid staking protocols like Davos and InQubeta are persisting, driven by the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade and investors desire to maximize their earnings through Ethereum staking.\n\nETH price at $1,587 as liquid staking surges | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nFeatured image from iStock, chart from Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Michael Saylor-owned data intelligence firm MicroStrategy Inc MSTR, which currently holds the largest number of Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) could have been more profitable if they had invested in Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH), data from a statistics platform shows.\n\nWhat Happened: According to archived statistics on blockchaincenter.net, Microstrategy\u2019s portfolio could have been more profitable if it had invested in ETH instead of BTC.\n\nSoftware developer MicroStrategy (MSTR) purchased nearly $150 million worth of Bitcoin (BTC) between Aug.1 and Sept.24, it said in a Monday regulatory filing.\n\n\u201cMicroStrategy, together with its subsidiaries, acquired approximately 5,445 bitcoins for approximately $147.3 million in cash, at an average price of approximately $27,053 per bitcoin, inclusive of fees and expenses,\u201d the company said in the filing.\n\nMicroStrategy now holds approximately 158,245 BTC, which were acquired at an aggregate purchase price of approximately $4.68 billion at an average purchase price of roughly $29,582 per bitcoin.\n\nThe creator of the data set, Holger from blockchaincenter.net, a self-proclaimed \u201cdata nerd,\u201d said he collected these metrics and painted an entirely different picture of what might have been for Microstrategy.\n\nSee More: Everything You Need to Know About Ethereum\n\nIf Microstrategy had invested the money in ETH at different points, it would now be holding 3,971,678 ETH ETH and its portfolio would be valued at $6.320 billion, yielding a 34% increase against BTC. Compared with a 12% loss from its BTC investment, investing in ETH would have brought a profit of $2.255 billion to the company.\n\nBy staking its Ether stash, the firm could have also potentially earned an additional 371,355 ETH, bringing in a staking profit of about $591.0 million annually at an annual percentage rate (APR) of 4%.\n\nWhy It Matters: Holger\u2019s data also reveals that if Microstrategy were to trade its BTC for ETH today, the company would receive 2,619,368 ETH as per today\u2019s exchange rates. This ETH portfolio would generate an estimated $208 million annually from staking.\n\nDespite the compelling data, Saylor holds BTC in the highest esteem as can be seen from his tweets, making switching to ETH highly unlikely.\n\nPrice Action: At the time of writing, BTC was trading at $26,331.32 and ETH at $1,591.49, according to Benzinga Pro.\n\nRead Next: Why Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin Are Soaring Today?

This growth rate outpaces many of the largest software companies in history according to a new report by crypto brokerage firm Caleb & Brown.\n\nIt took Ethereum around 7.5 years to reach $10 billion in annual revenue, faster than Meta (formerly Facebook), which reached that milestone in a little over 7.5 years, and Microsoft, which took 19 years.\n\nEthereum reached the $10 billion revenue milestone through fees collected on transactions and other activities on its network. This includes payments for using decentralized finance apps, minting and trading NFTs, sending cryptocurrency payments, and more.\n\nHowever, Ethereum\u2019s revenue has fallen more than 77% from the previous year along with the overall crypto market downturn. The decentralized network has revenue of $1.7 billion so far this year, according to data from crypto analytics firm Token Terminal. A recent valuation by VanEck suggests Ethereum\u2019s network revenue could rise from $2.6 billion annually to $51 billion by 2030 if adoption continues."

        "content": "Data shows the Ethereum funding rates have been quite negative in recent days. Here\u2019s what this could mean for the cryptocurrency\u2019s price.\n\nEthereum Funding Rates Have Been Under The Zero Mark Recently\n\nAs explained by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, a short squeeze may be a possibility for the asset currently. The \u201cfunding rate\u201d is an indicator that keeps track of the periodic fees that traders on the futures market are exchanging with each other.\n\nWhen the value of this metric is positive, it means that the long contract holders are paying a premium to the short holders right now. Such a trend implies the longs outweigh the shorts currently, and hence, a bullish mentality is the dominant force in the sector.\n\nOn the other hand, negative values suggest the majority of the futures market users share a bearish sentiment at the moment as the shorts are the ones paying a fee.\n\nNow, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Ethereum funding rates over the past week:\n\nLooks like the value of the metric has been quite negative in recent days | Source: CryptoQuant\n\nAs displayed in the above graph, the Ethereum funding rates had been positive until just a couple of days back, implying that the majority of the futures traders had been betting on the asset\u2019s price to go up.\n\nThe metric\u2019s value has plunged to the negative zone during the past day or so, however, suggesting that a complete flip in mentality has occurred among the investors.\n\nThis bearish sentiment, though, may not necessarily be bad for the price. This is because the more the mentality has become skewed in one direction historically, the more probable the price of the cryptocurrency has become to show a sharp move in the opposite direction.\n\nOne major reason why this happens is that mass liquidation events, which are popularly called \u201csqueezes,\u201d are more likely to involve the dominant side of the futures market.\n\nDuring a squeeze, a sudden swing in the price ends up liquidating a large amount of contracts at once. Such liquidations only provide fuel for the price move that caused them, thus amplifying it further. This can lead to a cascade of more liquidations.\n\nAs shorts have piled up in the Ethereum futures market recently, the probability of a short squeeze occurring would be elevated. Naturally, if such an event does take place, the asset\u2019s value could see a sharp rebound.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t necessarily have to happen, of course, and if it does, it may not be soon. From the chart, it\u2019s visible that the funding rate had remained at notable positive values for a while before the ETH price finally registered its plunge.\n\nETH Price\n\nEthereum has taken a hit of more than 3% during the past week as the asset\u2019s price is now trading under the $1,600 level.\n\nETH has gone down in the last few days | Source: ETHUSD on TradingView\n\nFeatured image from Kanchanara on Unsplash.com, charts from TradingView.com, CryptoQuant.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Share:\n\nBitcoin price could attempt a move to the 50% retracement level, between the $28,208 and $28,815 range.\n\nEthereum price coils up for a move north and could test the $1,650 resistance level in a 5% climb.\n\nRipple price deliberates the next move after rejection from the mean threshold at $0.5337; the odds still favor bulls.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price is pushing north, but the headwinds continue to oppose the recovery rally. However, the odds still favor the upside, though only narrowly. On the other side, Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) investors and traders have a lot going on with both price actions leaving longs and shorts a lot to ponder over. Generally, the market has a lot to decipher, with a quick rally in the cards, according to experts.\n\nAlso Read: Week Ahead: No ETFs, but crypto markets might be preparing for a quick rally ahead of Powell's speech\n\nBitcoin price could test the 50% Fib\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price is in an overall uptrend, in what appears to be a recovery rally, with the $26,000 psychological level holding forte for the flagship crypto even as profit takers engage the load-shedding gear. Increased buying pressure above this level could send BTC north, confronting the resistance confluence between the 200- and 50-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) at around 26,933, before heading up to the 100-day EMA at $26,962.\n\nHowever, it would take more than just buying pressure to drive Bitcoin price north, considering the low volatility in the market. With the Relative Strength Index (RSI) moving north, momentum is growing. With such bullish interest, BTC bulls could launch a subsequent attack at the range limit presented by the EMAs before the next breakout.\n\nTraders must also put off their profit-taking appetite, with a confirmed break and close above the $27,771 likely to fuel optimism that could send BTC to the 50% Fibonacci retracement level around the $28,208 to $28,215 range.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-day chart\n\nConversely, selling pressure from the supplier congestion zones indicated by the EMAs could extend the downtrend for Bitcoin price, with a likely retest of the $25,613 range. In the dire case, the slump could extrapolate to the $25,100 support level, last tested during mid-June. Such a move would constitute a 5% slide.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin price action culls $30 million longs ahead of Fed Chairman speech\n\nEthereum price could make a move north\n\nEthereum (ETH) price appears due for a move north, supported by the promising outlook of the RSI, which is about to signal a call to buy as its edges closer to the signal line (yellow band) in the rising trajectory.\n\nTraders heeding this call could send Ethereum price north, likely to the $1,650 resistance level. In a highly bullish case, the gains could extend to the 50-day EMA at $1,672. Such a move would constitute a 5% ascent above the current level.\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the flip side, profit-taking could send Ethereum price back towards $1,551 or lower to collect the sell-side liquidity resting underneath.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum whales prepare ahead of futures Ethereum ETF approval on October 2\n\nRipple price rejected from the supply zone\n\nRipple (XRP) price was rejected from the mean threshold of the supply zone order block at $5,337. This was expected, considering the zone is characterized by aggressive selling. With the 50-, 100- and 200-day EMAs at $0.5300, 0.5468, and 0.5391, all resting within the supply zone, the bears have the advantage.\n\nHowever, the RSI is showing rising momentum, while the Parabolic SAR continues to track XRP from below, acting as support at $0.4760. These are both bullish indicators, likely to give Ethereum price the pivot for its move north.\n\nXRP/USDT 1-day chart\n\nIn the same way, the token has been recording lower highs and lower lows, indicating growing seller momentum. This could see ETH break below $0.4191 or in the dire case, send ETH below the $0.4600 to tag to mid-July.\n\nAlso Read: Ripple Price Forecast: Declining network growth and underwater XRP holders suggest more downside for XRP price"

        "content": "In a day marked by significant cryptocurrency transfers, Bitcoin (BTC), XRP and Ethereum (ETH) have become subjects of interest as transactions worth hundreds of millions of dollars took place in rapid succession, leaving the crypto community intrigued.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to data tracked by WhaleAlert, the day kicked off with a bang as a staggering 2,907 BTC, equivalent to a jaw-dropping $76.44 million, found their way onto Coinbase. However, just a few hours later, 2,533 BTC, valued at $66.5 million, were withdrawn from a no less esteemed exchange, Kraken. The cryptic, multidirectional movement of Bitcoin, in such staggering volumes, has left crypto enthusiasts scratching their heads.\n\nXRP, on the other hand, provided a somewhat clearer picture. An impressive 30.3 million tokens, amounting to $15.3 million, embarked on a journey to the Bitstamp exchange. This is not the first time such significant activity has occurred, and it appears to be correlated with the exponential growth of usage of Ripple Payments (formerly ODL).\n\nBitstamp, a key payment corridor for Ripple, and its partial ownership by the crypto company, hint at a deeper narrative. Moreover, these substantial transfers have not triggered a drop in XRP's price, leading to thought that selling intentions may be absent.\n\nEthereum also made headlines with a notable transfer of 15,000 ETH, valued at $23.85 million, to Coinbase. It seems that someone followed the example of Vitalik Buterin, the founder of Ethereum, who has recently been actively moving his holdings to various exchanges."

        "title": "The State of Ethereum Liquid Staking Derivatives (LSDs): Report - BSC NEWS",
        "content": "Key highlights and takeaways from CoinGecko's recent report on the state of the Ethereum Liquid-Staking Industry.\n\nThe world of cryptocurrency is vast and ever-evolving. Among its numerous facets, one that has garnered significant attention post-2020 is the introduction and subsequent boom of Liquid Staking Derivatives (LSDs) in the Ethereum ecosystem. CoinGecko's recent report on the state of the liquid staking industry sheds valuable light on one of few verticals to have boomed during recent months.\n\nWhat are Liquid Staking Derivatives (LSDs)?\n\nLiquid Staking Derivatives, commonly known as LSDs, are tokenized receipts individuals obtain when they stake their assets in liquid staking protocols. These receipts are a testament to the ownership of their staked assets.\n\nThe beauty of these LSDs is that they can be traded on different exchanges for other assets or even be used as collateral for loans.\n\nEach LSD protocol has its own method of operation. Some might employ permissioned node operators, whereas others operate on a permissionless basis. They also differ in terms of fee structures and the distribution of staking rewards.\n\nBut what is notably fascinating is the emergence of Liquid Staking Derivatives Finance (LSDFi), which is a new breed of protocols focusing on building and innovating the existing LSDs.\n\nThe Origin and Growth of LSDs\n\nLSDs and pooled staking saw the light of day with the inception of Ethereum\u2019s Beacon chain in 2020. This chain allowed validators to earn staking rewards, but there was a catch\u2014they had to stake a whopping 32 ETH. LSDs became a game-changer, letting validators dive into staking with much smaller amounts of ETH and ensuring liquidity.\n\nPost the Shapella upgrade, the popularity of LSD staking saw a substantial rise. As highlighted by CoinGecko, the top 8 LSDs have been offering an average Annual Percentage Yield (APY) of 4.4% since January 2022.\n\nLSDs\u2019 Significant Contribution\n\nAccording to CoinGecko's detailed report, LSD protocols are responsible for a significant 43.7% of the total ETH staked. From November 2020 to August 2023, an impressive 11.3 million ETH got staked in LSD protocols. This is a significant portion of the total 26.4 million ETH staked on the entire network. Lido, an LSD platform, has been particularly dominant, claiming 73.4% of all the ETH staked in LSDs.\n\nFurthermore, approximately 100,000 ETH in staking rewards are distributed by LSDs every quarter. These figures have steadily risen, capturing up to 52.4% of all ETH emissions in the third quarter of 2023.\n\nA Glimpse at LSDFi Protocols\n\nThe year 2023 has been phenomenal for LSDFi protocols, especially for the top 10. Their Total Value Locked (TVL) saw a staggering growth of 5,870% from January to August. By the end of August 2023, this figure stood at $919 million.\n\nTop 10 LSD protocols by TVL. Source: CoinGecko\n\nTwo names that shine the brightest in the LSDFi domain are Lybra and EigenLayer. Lybra, post its Shapella launch, quickly climbed the ladder to become the leading LSDFi protocol. By August's end, it commanded 39.1% of TVL or $359.0M. EigenLayer, although a late entrant with its June 2023 launch, has been catching up fast, boasting $245.0M in TVL.\n\nThe Yield Game\n\nYield is a significant factor for those involved in staking. Since January 2022, the top 8 LSDs have seen an average APY of 4.4%. Frax\u2019s sfrxETH has led this race with an average yield of 6.2% from October 2022 to August 2023. Lido\u2019s stETH and StakeWise\u2019s SETH2 follow closely, offering yields of 4.6% and 4.5%, respectively. Ankr\u2019s ankrETH, unfortunately, trails at the end with an average yield of 3.5%, the lowest among its competitors.\n\nLDS Yields Have Averaged 4.4% Since January 2022. Source: CoinGecko\n\nAs of August 2023, with 26.4 million staked ETH, the average yield across these top 8 LSD protocols stands at about 3.28%. The yield might see a downtrend as the number of staked ETH continues to climb.\n\nTo conclude, the world of LSDs is still in its relative infancy but has shown the potential to revolutionize staking in the Ethereum ecosystem. With continuous innovations and upgrades in the offing, the future looks promising for Liquid Staking Derivatives."

        "content": "Disclaimer: The information presented does not constitute financial, investment, trading, or other types of advice and is solely the writer\u2019s opinion.\n\nEthereum has a bearish market structure across multiple timeframes.\n\nThe psychological support level at $1500 could face a retest in the coming weeks.\n\nEthereum [ETH] has been in a rough spot on the price charts since early August when the price slipped below the $1850 level. The trend pointed downward even on the higher timeframe price charts and the buyers could have a torrid time correcting this course.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nReports that the SEC acknowledged review of the Ethereum ETF applications from VanEck and Ark Invest was a positive development in the long run. The falling transaction fees were also a talking point as the network could enter a phase of inflation.\n\nThe bearish structure would likely see ETH fall to $1500\n\nThe 1-day price chart above showcased Ethereum forming a series of lower highs and lower lows since early August. This characterized a downtrend. The Fibonacci retracement levels from mid-March showed that the $1533 level was the 78.6% retracement level.\n\nIt was tested as support on 11 September, and consequently, ETH bounced to the $1663 resistance. The bulls met with failure at that level and took losses over the past few days. As a result, the market structure was bearish on the lower timeframe charts such as 4-hour.\n\nThe RSI has been below neutral 50 on the daily chart since mid-July and signaled a downtrend in progress. The OBV has also shown no intent of breaking its downtrend from June, which meant buying pressure remained weak.\n\nHence, even though the $1533 was technically significant and was close to the $1500 psychological support, buying ETH in that region could be risky.\n\nThe metrics showed recovery was possible but is another wave of selling imminent?\n\nThe mean coin age took a large hit on 11 September as holders exited the market in large numbers. It had been in an uptrend since June and resumed its upward trajectory over the past two weeks.\n\nThis showed an accumulation of the token across the network. The MVRV ratio was negative and showed the token was likely undervalued.\n\nHow much are 1, 10, or 100 ETH worth today?\n\nThese findings were encouraging for buyers but the exchange flow balance metric saw a large spike on 23 September, Saturday. The positive spike conveyed 65.4k ETH tokens arriving in exchange wallets, amounting to $100 million.\n\nWhile every such spike does not mean a sell-off will occur within a week, it was strong evidence that ETH could post further losses on the price chart. Therefore the $1500 support level could see a retest."

        "content": "Questionable trading bedevils NFT market, particularly on the Ethereum network where it accounts for half the trading volume.\n\nA fifth of the trading volume on Blur, a leading NFT marketplace, over the past three months was attributed to wash trading.\n\nHappy Monday!\n\nAbout half of the NFT trading activity on Ethereum in the past day is linked to wash trading. While trading volumes are up for popular collections including CryptoPunks and Bored Ape Yacht Club, it\u2019s hard to discern what is real what isn\u2019t.\n\nLet\u2019s dig in!\n\nWash trades\n\nWhile not unique to crypto, wash trading has proliferated in recent years, particularly when it comes to nonfungible tokens.\n\nStay ahead of the game with our weekly newsletters Subscribe\n\nNFT wash sales on Ethereum were up 30% to $4.7 million in the last 24 hours, according to CryptoSlam data. This accounts for about 50% of all NFT sales on the blockchain since Sunday.\n\nWash trading occurs when one person buys and sells the same assets simultaneously to artificially increase activity. It\u2019s a form of market manipulation, and is designed to mislead market participants.\n\nA recent report on wash trading on decentralised exchanges has been hotly contested.\n\nThe study seemed to uncover genuine wash-trading in long-tail assets, Nagaking, a Curve Finance grantee who studies DeFi market structure, told DL News. Its results were \u201cfar from generalizable to DEXs more broadly,\u201d he added.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nWash-trading isn\u2019t a profitable strategy for the large majority of tokens, Nagaking said. Volumes on these DEXs tend to be dominated by arbitrage and directional betting.\n\nWhen it comes to NFTs, the landscape is a lot different \u2014 and incentives on burgeoning exchange\u2019s play a role.\n\nWash trading accounted for just over 40% of trades on NFT marketplace Blur over the past week, according to DeFiLlama data. This is a stark contrast to archrival OpenSea, which recorded only 0.5% of these questionable transactions.\n\nWash trades continue to plague NFT space and Blur marketplace (Rita Fortunato/DL News/Rita Fortunato/DL News)\n\nSince July, 20% of the total trading volume on the Blur, which lanuched little more than a year ago, was attributed to wash trading, according to a Dune Dashboard by Hildobby, a data scientist at crypto venture fund Dragonfly. That\u2019s about $220 million.\n\nWhile questionable trades account for a fifth of the total volume on Blur, it doesn\u2019t dominate individual trades. Only 3.5% of trades on Blur are attributed to wash trading by Hildobby\u2019s dashboard.\n\nBlur incentivised users to trade on its platform by promising a token airdrop. Its top users would receive free tokens, which they could then sell on the secondary market and profit from their activity on the platform. Users have since started to \u201cpoint farm\u201d in anticipation of the platform\u2019s next airdrop.\n\nThis led some users to trade collections like Bored Ape Yacht Club in order to increase their activity.\n\nWhile NFT activity is up on the Ethereum blockchain, it continues to be plagued by wash trading.\n\nCrypto market movers\n\nBitcoin fell 2% in the past day.\n\nEthereum is down 1.6% since the weekend.\n\nAltcoins fell at a sharper pace, with Ripple\u2019s XRP down 3% and Polygon\u2019s MATIC losing 2.2%.\n\nToncoin continues to fall after it was catapulted into the top ten cryptocurrencies by market capitalisation on CoinGecko. The token is down about 2% since Sunday, and over 11% in the last week.\n\nWhat we\u2019re reading\n\nAdam Morgan McCarthy is DL News\u2019 London-based Markets Correspondent. Got a tip?

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEthereum finds itself at a crucial juncture. Currently trading at around $1,576, it is teetering just $26 above the significant support level of approximately $1,552. This particular price point has been a magnet for whale accumulation, making it a critical level to watch.\n\nThe trading volume for Ethereum has been on a downward trajectory, which often serves as a precursor to heightened volatility. This declining volume, coupled with the asset's proximity to a key support level, creates a tension-filled atmosphere. Market participants are keenly watching to see if the support will hold or give way to further price depreciation.\n\nSource: TradingView\n\nAdding another layer of complexity is the long-ago occurrence of the death cross, a bearish indicator where the 50-day moving average crosses below the 200-day moving average. This technical event often signals a continuation of downward pressure, and in Ethereum's case, it has yet to prove otherwise.\n\nThe Ethereum network has been a hotbed of innovation, particularly in the DeFi sector. However, despite its technological advancements, the asset is not immune to market forces. The current technical setup suggests that Ethereum could be in for more downside, unless a significant catalyst alters its course.\n\nIn essence, Ethereum is at a crossroads. The confluence of descending trading volume, a critical support level and a lingering death cross creates a complex tapestry of factors that traders and investors must navigate. The asset's next move could very well set the tone for its short to medium-term trajectory.\n\nCardano meets triangle\n\nCardano (ADA) finds itself in a precarious position, navigating the narrowing straits of a descending triangle. As ADA approaches the triangle's apex, market participants are bracing for a volatility explosion. Currently, ADA is priced at approximately $0.2447, according to recent data.\n\nThe descending triangle is a pattern that often signals a bearish continuation. However, it is crucial to note that the pattern can break either way \u2014 up or down. The key is to watch for a decisive move on significant volume. Speaking of volume, ADA's trading activity has been relatively subdued, which often precedes a burst of volatility.\n\nThe Cardano network has been a subject of admiration for its focus on rigorous academic research and a peer-reviewed approach to blockchain development. Yet, despite its lofty ideals, Cardano has not been immune to the broader market's lethargy.\n\nThe convergence of moving averages further substantiates the notion of impending volatility. When moving averages converge, they often indicate a period of market indecision, a tussle between the bulls and the bears. Once one side gains the upper hand, the asset usually makes a strong move in that direction.\n\nShiba Inu's unexpected dynamics\n\nA closer look at the Shiba Inu data reveals a surprising twist: SHIB is actually on an upward trajectory. While the longer-term price picture might suggest otherwise, the asset has been subtly climbing, albeit with some volatility.\n\nThe current price movement of Shiba Inu hints at a \"bearish flag\" formation. A bearish flag is generally a continuation pattern that indicates a potential downward breakout. However, it is essential to note that these patterns are not set in stone and can sometimes defy expectations.\n\nA pivotal moment for Shiba Inu came when it faced a strong price rejection at the 21 Exponential Moving Average (EMA), a commonly used technical indicator. This rejection led to a 3% price reversal for SHIB, adding another layer of intrigue to its price action. While a 3% move might not sound groundbreaking, in the high-stakes world of cryptocurrency trading, even small percentage changes can have a significant impact.\n\nWhat does this all mean for Shiba Inu? The asset finds itself in a complex situation. On one hand, the bearish flag formation and the 21 EMA rejection point toward a potential downside. On the other hand, the asset has been quietly trending upward, defying broader bearish sentiment."

Given the extra risks and rewards, Berryman says strategy for bigger players is \u201cis to put 10% into Rocket Pool [or Lido] because they like that bit of extra yield, and they understand the risks associated with it.\u201d"

As a result, the Bitcoin rally last week proved to be short-lived. See the previous update that highlighted the possibility of a rebound \u201cHave Bitcoin & Ethereum Capitulated? BTC/USD & ETH/USD Price Setups,\u201d published September 18.\n\nBTC/USD 240-Minute Chart\n\nChart Created by Manish Jaradi Using TradingView\n\nThe subsequent fall below crucial converged support at the September 15 low of 26250, coinciding with the lower edge of the Ichimoku cloud and the 89-period moving average on the 240-minute charts confirms that the upward pressure has faded. The break below support has opened up the possibility of two scenarios. BTC/USD could settle in a 24750-27500 range; the second scenario involves a retest of the June low of 24750.\n\nBTC/USD Daily Chart\n\nChart Created by Manish Jaradi Using TradingView\n\nOn the upside, unless Bitcoin is able to cross above the end-August high of 28150, the path of least resistance remains sideways to down. From a big-picture perspective, any break below 24750 could spell further weakness toward the March low of 19500.\n\nETHEREUM: Falters at key resistance\n\nEthereum charts probably stand out and clarify the inability of Bitcoin to rise toward the August high. Ethereum has succumbed to strong resistance on the 200-period moving average, coinciding with the early-September high of 1660, and a downtrend line from August.\n\nETH/USD 240-Minute Chart\n\nChart Created by Manish Jaradi Using TradingView\n\nThe retreat from key resistance coupled with the subsequent fall below a horizontal trendline support at 1600 keeps the bearish bias intact \u2013as highlighted in the previous update. ETH/USD risks a retest of the August low of 1550. Below the August low, the next support is on the lower edge of a downtrend channel since April (now at about 1485). A break below the 1475-1550 region could pave the way toward the October low of 1370.\n\nETH/USD Weekly Chart\n\nChart Created by Manish Jaradi Using TradingView\n\nAs noted earlier this month, ETH/USD has been under the influence of the bearish Ichimoku cloud cover on the weekly charts. Furthermore, in recent weeks, ETH/USD has been snowed under the Ichimoku cloud on the daily charts. On the upside, Ethereum needs to surpass 1660 at the very least for the downward pressure to begin easing.\n\nRecommended by Manish Jaradi Improve your trading with IG Client Sentiment Data Get My Guide\n\n--- Written by Manish Jaradi, Strategist for DailyFX.com\n\n--- Contact and follow Jaradi on Twitter: @JaradiManish"

        "content": "Bitcoin and other crypto tokens were nursing their wounds on Tuesday amid the volatility in the riskier asset class. The ongoing week looks slow for cryptocurrencies due to few macroeconomic updates. After a flat and dull trade, the market is looking for signals to take a direction.\n\n\n\nAfter the recent bout of weakness, Bitcoin was back in buying momentum as the largest crypto token surged about a per cent to hold above $26,000-levels. Its largest peer Ethereum also gained on the similar lines but did not race-past $1,600-mark. Price action in the altcoins remained on the positive side in the early hours.\n\n\n\nThe crypto market has traded sideways with slight buying pressure. Continuing its oscillation between the neutral and fear zones, the crypto fear and greed index is back in the fear zone with a score of 46/100 after shedding off a point since yesterday. Markets are currently dealing with the rate hike concerns and rising treasury yields, said Shubham Hudda, Senior Manager, CoinSwitch Markets Desk.\n\n\n\n\"In an interesting take, data compiled by Token Terminal shows that Ethereum has generated over $10 billion in revenue in a record seven years,\" he added. \"MicroStrategy, in its recent regulatory filing disclosed that the company has purchased BTC worth approximately $150 million since August 01. Total BTC holdings currently sum up to nearly $4.7 billion.\"\n\n\n\nBarring a few exceptions, all top crypto tokens were trading higher on Tuesday. Polkadot and Polygon gained about 2 per cent each, while BNB and Cardano added more than a per cent each. Among the laggards, Toncoin dropped more than 2 per cent, while Shiba Inu was down about a per cent. Solana was also seen in red.\n\n\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market cap was trading slightly higher, rising to $1.05 trillion-mark, as it rose about a per cent in the last 24 hours. However, the total trading volumes jumped about 10 per cent to $22.73 billion.\n\n\n\n\n\nTech View by WazirX Trade Desk\n\nChainlink(LINK) serves as a blockchain abstraction layer, facilitating seamless connectivity for smart contracts across various platforms.

However, since the past few weeks, the price is on an upward trajectory with the chart breaking above the 20-week moving average and approaching the upper trendline. The next resistance is expected at 8.78 USDT and an immediate support is expected at 6.46 USDT.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Views and recommendations given in this section are the analysts' own and do not represent those of Business Today.

        "title": "Ethereum Price Prediction: Will ETH Break the $2000 Barrier Soon? - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "After rising above $1,600 and staying above this level since September 12 reaching out toward $1,670, the Etherum price finally dropped on Wednesday, September 20. The drop came after the coin spent several days fluctuating between $1,550 and $1,670, its primary resistance preventing it from going up to $1700.\n\nAs the price dropped, it encountered support at around $1,575, briefly stopping the coin from sinking. However, the selling pressure was too intense, and the coin did not bounce back up. Instead, the bearish wave pushed further down, sending it to $1,570.\n\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $1,578, down 0.8% on the day. Ether\u2019s trading activity has increased significantly over the last 24 hours, rising by 108% to $4 billion, according to data from CoinMarketCap.\n\nOn the weekly timeframe, ETH remains bearish after dropping 2.75% over the last seven days. It is also down 4.5% and 11% over the last 30 days and six months respectively.\n\nAs a result of the losses, altcoin\u2019s 14-week RSI fell to the support level at 38. The price strength is 40, and experts believe it will reach 30. If this happens, chances are good that ETH will see an additional price drop that might take it below $1,500 toward $1,200.\n\nETH/USD Weekly Chart\n\nIt is worth noting that some believe that this is an excellent opportunity to take a long position. This is supported by the bullish SuperTrend indicator. This trend-following chart overlay indicator is still green after turning bullish and moving below the price in April. As long as this indicator continues to trail the price, the largest altcoin by market capitalization will remain bullish on the weekly timeframe.\n\nAs such, if ETH manages to breach the current resistance and move up to the one sitting around between $16,44 and $1,774, embraced by the 100-weekly Simple Moving Average (SMA) and the 50-weekly SMA respectively.\n\nOvercoming this level would see Ethereum rise above the $2,000 psychological level to reach the optimistic target of a symmetrical triangle at $2,050. This would represent a 30% ascent from the current price.\n\nThis positive narrative is also supported by on-chain data from blockchain analytics platform Santiment which said that the odds are good that Ethereum will soon bounce back. According to the company, one factor could make this happen. The platform noted that Ethereum\u2019s network fees had dropped to its lowest levels this year.\n\n\u201cEthereum network fees have dropped down to its lowest level of 2023, at just $1.15 per transaction. Historically, we see utility begin rising as $ETH becomes more affordable to circulate. Increased utility can then lead to recovering market cap levels.\u201d\n\n\ud83e\udd11 #Ethereum network fees have dropped down to its lowest level of 2023, at just $1.15 per transaction.

With the presale entering Stage 6, excitement is building around this project. It has already onboarded 18,000 users, released a demo platform, and raised $6M. Its innovative approach to online trading has drawn global attention.\n\nOne of the most significant issues in online trading is the lack of transparency, leaving traders in the dark. Tradecurve Markets tackles this head-on by implementing its own Proof of Reserves, a feature notably absent from platforms like Coinbase. This ensures that users can access real-time information about their assets, promoting trust and transparency.\n\n:large_green_circle:Exciting news\n\nThe #TradeCurve Demo Platform is NOW LIVE!\n\nDive in, explore, and experience the future of trading. We value your insights \u2013 sign up, give it a whirl, and share your feedback with us.\n\nLet\u2019s shape the future together! :point_right::skin-tone-4:https://t.co/nuKSMkeh21#Cryptotrading pic.twitter.com/HuMKbBeI7D \u2014 Tradecurve (@Tradecurveapp) September 11, 2023\n\nNot only that, Tradecurve Markets goes a step further by eliminating sign-up KYC checks. Unlike many exchanges that require users to go through lengthy and intrusive identity verification processes, this platform prioritizes privacy. This user-friendly approach allows traders to start trading without compromising their personal information.\n\nAt the core of this platform is the TCRV native token, which is now worth just $0.025. However, when Stage 6 arrives, this value will surge to $0.03. With a lower market cap, TCRV may grow faster than Shiba Inu and Ethereum. Thus, experts forecast a 50x value surge before its presale ends.\n\nFor more information about the Tradecurve Markets (TCRV) presale:\n\nWebsite: https://tradecurvemarkets.com/\n\nBuy presale: https://app.tradecurvemarkets.com/sign-up\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Tradecurveapp\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Ethereum Clients More Diversified Than Bitcoin, Is This Good? - Bitcoinist",
        "content": "Justin Bons, the chief investment officer (CIO) and founder of Cyber Capital, one of Europe\u2019s oldest crypto funds, is convinced Ethereum is the most \u201crobust\u201d network, considering its level of client diversity.\n\nBons pointed out the distribution of full nodes across various Ethereum clients as evidence of the network\u2019s \u201cunparalleled\u201d level of decentralization. The expert believes decentralization is often overlooked in crypto, but Ethereum sets \u201cthe bar high.\u201d\n\nClient Diversity: Impact On Security And Reliability\n\nBons compared the number of clients in Ethereum and the dominance of Bitcoin core in Bitcoin. Although Bitcoin and Ethereum are legacy blockchains, the approach taken by developers to avail clients is evident.\n\nClient diversity is critical as it can show how well full node operators prefer a given client rail over another. Ethereum, like Bitcoin and other public chains, is decentralized and depends on a community of validators to keep the network secure.\n\nValidators, or miners in Bitcoin, operate full nodes to keep the network operations. However, the blockchain is broken without a client. A client is a software that implements the public network\u2019s specification, enabling secure and effective peer-to-peer (P2P) communication between nodes.\n\nClient diversity is important for the security and resilience of public networks. To illustrate, if all node operators were to use the same client or software implementation, a bug could cause a network outage or even cause other disruptions. With more clients, it becomes harder to halt network operations even if there is a bug, improving reliability.\n\nThe improved reliability from diversity and distribution of clients also means better security. An attacker wishing to disrupt operations has to disable all the available clients used by node operators before proceeding.\n\nEthereum Versus Bitcoin Full Node Distribution\n\nAs of September 25, there were multiple Ethereum clients, including Geth, Besu, Erigon, and Nethermind. However, more than half of all Ethereum full node operators prefer Geth, which has a 55.35% market share. Other popular options are Nethermind and Erigon, with a share of 23.48% and 12.03%, respectively.\n\nOf all the nodes in operation, over 74% have synced with the Ethereum network, while around 26% are still syncing.\n\nLooking at full node concentration, most are operated from the United States, at over 43%, and a bigger percentage from Germany, at roughly 13%. A small concentration of full Ethereum nodes from the United Kingdom, Singapore, and France exists.\n\nOn the other hand, Bitcoin full node operators mostly exclusively depend on Bitcoin core. According to statistics, 16,681 nodes are mainly distributed globally. There is no country from which over 10% of Bitcoin\u2019s full nodes are operated.\n\nFeature image from Canva, chart from TradingView"
