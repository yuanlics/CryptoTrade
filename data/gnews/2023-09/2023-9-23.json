        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s next major upgrade, Dencun, will likely see a delayed launch according to statements from developers during a meeting on Sept. 21.\n\nThough Dencun is largely complete, it is still under development and in need of testing. Tim Beiko, a member of the Ethereum Foundation, said that Dencun still must be deployed to a testnet. He added that the timing of this step could delay Cancun\u2019s launch on the Ethereum mainnet \u2014 where real transactions occur \u2014 into the new year.\n\nBeiko said during the meeting:\n\n\u201cI think the implication is, if we don\u2019t do a test net before Devconnect [Nov. 13-18] \u2026 it\u2019s probably unlikely we can do mainnet before the \u2026 Christmas holidays \u2026 and people being gone so that\u2019s probably not the best time for committment.\u201d\n\nDevelopers previously did not give Dencun a definite date, but most previous estimates suggested that the upgrade would go live before the end of 2023.\n\nDevs consider target testnet\n\nNews of a possible Dencun delay comes shortly after Ethereum\u2019s Holesky testnet experienced launch issues. Holesky continues to wait for a relaunch.\n\nDuring the current meeting, Developers addressed whether the Holesky testnet will be available for Dencun testing prior to Devconnect in November. Ethereum Foundation member Parithosh Jayanthi said that Holesky\u2019s relaunch is set to take place on Sept. 28 and will be ready for Dencun testing before the upcoming conference.\n\nJayanthi nevertheless suggested testing Dencun\u2019s first fork on an older testnet, Goerli, which will soon be discontinued. He noted that the end of Goerli\u2019s lifespan means that any issues related to Dencun will be isolated to that testnet.\n\nJayanthi additionally suggested that Dencun\u2019s second and third forks could be tested on the new Holesky testnet at a later date. \u201cIf [Dencun] goes badly on Holesky, then we have to figure out how to save it,\u201d Jayanthi concluded.\n\nDencun will combine two upgrades, Deneb and Cancun, and will bring various new features. The most notable of those features is proto-danksharding, which will improve Ethereum\u2019s scalability when finally arrives on mainnet."

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) co-founder Vitalik Buterin believes that privacy and decentralization should be key priorities for the blockchain network going forward.\n\nButerin cautioned that centralized entities like custodial exchanges are \u201cvulnerable\u201d and can be corrupted. Users should be able to transact directly on the Ethereum blockchain, he argues.\n\nHere\u2019s what the 29-year-old entrepreneur told CNBC at a recent crypto developer conference in Prague:\n\nWe need the experience on-chain to actually be good for regular people to use. [\u2026] We need it to actually be possible to do Ethereum payments in a way where the transaction fee is less than five cents. Vitalik Buterin \u2014 Ethereum co-founder\n\nButerin believes Ethereum can realize its greatest utility in emerging economies by enabling payments, savings and access to the global economy. He said crypto adoption is already spreading in countries like Argentina.\n\nYou might also like: Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin exits MakerDAO position\n\nI literally got recognized on the streets of Buenos Aires more often than I got recognized in San Francisco. Vitalik Buterin \u2014 Ethereum co-founder\n\nHowever, he warned that centralized actors like Binance still dominate crypto usage in many developing nations. Buterin said Ethereum must become more decentralized and secure for regular users.\n\nPeople need to have wallets that are actually secure, where if they lose the keys, they\u2019re not going to lose everything. Vitalik Buterin \u2014 Ethereum co-founder\n\nButerin also advocated for more privacy technology such as zero-knowledge proof implementations. He argued that Ethereum\u2019s move to proof-of-stake consensus makes it \u201ceasier to anonymize.\u201d\n\nProof-of-stake is actually easier to anonymize and harder to shut down than proof-of-work is. [\u2026] Proof-of-work requires huge amounts of physical equipment and requires huge amounts of electricity. These are exactly the kinds of things that drug enforcement agencies have decades of experience detecting. Vitalik Buterin \u2014 Ethereum co-founder\n\nHe dismissed concerns about his own prominent role in Ethereum, noting that the network is now self-governing, with several independent organizations contributing. Buterin said his goal has always been for the Ethereum Foundation to foster independent ecosystems. Buterin said there are \u201cdiverging interests\u201d between governments who want to crack down on crypto and developers who want to build with strong encryption.\n\nThe ecosystem does need to find a way to fight hard for the right to continue to build things with the kinds of privacy that we\u2019ve been used to for thousands of years. Vitalik Buterin \u2014 Ethereum co-founder\n\nEven mainstream countries are growing more concerned for privacy technology developers, Buterin warns, citing the charges against Tornado Cash developers by the U.S. and Netherlands as an example.\n\nTornado Cash is an Ethereum mixing service used to enhance privacy. But law enforcement has targeted Tornado Cash developers rather than just bad actors misusing the tool.\n\nButerin argued this sets a dangerous precedent. He said crypto developers should have the right to build privacy-focused products without fear of prosecution.\n\nAccording to Buterin, privacy is essential for realizing the decentralization and censorship resistance that are foundational to blockchain networks like Ethereum. He contends that users should be able to transact peer-to-peer without relying on or being blocked by centralized intermediaries.\n\nRead more: Vitalik Buterin throws shade at XRP centralization\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "title": "How High Will Ethereum Go? - CoinGape",
        "content": "The biggest cryptocurrency of all time, Bitcoin, gained much traction much after its inception. The reason is simple, anything new with potential finally makes it to the top. Following the trend, Ethereum, a similar type but with a much improved concept, was soon to climb the ladder of fame.\n\nThe evolution of Ethereum also spiked traders\u2019 interests. Over the years, Ethereum has become the second largest cryptocurrency in the world. However, despite the technological spike, the coin couldn\u2019t surpass Bitcoin. Will it ever? How high will Ethereum go? Let\u2019s delve into the topic and understand where this coin is going in the future.\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum Price History\n\nLet us take a quick look at Ethereum\u2019s historical price performance before getting into price prediction. The price of Ethereum (ETH) has fluctuated significantly since its launch in 2015. ETH first surpassed the $10 threshold in March 2016, despite experiencing a sizable surge after its launch.\n\nThe price of ETH increased more noticeably in late 2016 and early 2017 as a result of the Ethereum network\u2019s rising popularity, which was largely brought on by the proliferation of initial coin offerings (ICOs). The price of Ethereum skyrocketed past $1,000, peaking at about $1,400 in January 2018.\n\nHowever, this price increase came after a significant decline during the ensuing crypto winter. ETH\u2019s cost plunged to an all-time low of $80 in December 2018. However, with the start of the subsequent bullish market cycle, Ethereum started to climb steadily, occasionally experiencing minor corrections, eventually reaching a new peak of about $2,000 in May 2021.\n\nAs the bull market came to an end in November 2021, the price of ETH hit an all-time high of $4,891.70. Unfortunately, numerous crypto disasters, bankruptcies, and an unfavourable global macroeconomic environment all served to exacerbate the bear market.\n\nHow High Will Ethereum Go?\n\nAs the chart indicates, Ethereum has been receiving long term support since 2020. However, a major resistance was also created around $2038. It is the same period, when Ethereum was seen touching its all time high of $4868.\n\nHowever, Ethereum suffered a lot in 2022. In, 2023 is here with all the positive news, starting with the upgrade and switch to proof of stake (PoS). While writing the price prediction, Ethereum was at $1,858. There is a $222,970,691,577 USD market cap. The maximum supply is not known, but there are 120,245,588 ETH coins in circulation.\n\nIn the coming years, Ethereum price is predicted to range as high as $4,204.12 and $5,063.95, respectively. The typical anticipated trading expense is $4,355.45. By 2030, the price can rise up to $15,000.\n\nThe anticipations about Ethereum is quite positive. The coming period for the coin holds high expectations from traders, as well as, developers.\n\nMarket cap $196,632,048,264 ROI 65610.57% All Time High (Nov 16, 2021) $4,891.70 All Time Low (Oct 21, 2015) $0.4209\n\nUnderstanding the Idea Behind Creating Ethereum\n\nBitcoin was launched to test two main features that were missing in the financial system \u2013 permissionless transactions and cryptography. It sought to use the stern tenacity of cryptography to investigate the potential of the decentralized database. It could send values across the world without the involvement of intermediaries. However, it was missing an important feature of turning into a complete scripting language. But, do you know who had the solution? Yes, you guessed it right, Ethereum.\n\nThe idea behind Ethereum was to make it simplest, even though there might be data storage incompetence or higher time usage. As envisioned, Ethereum soon received the deserved reaction among the technological prophets. And now, after more than a decade, it has evolved into a technology that is more meticulous than Bitcoin.\n\nEthereum has played a pivotal role in the development of the blockchain and cryptocurrency ecosystem, and it has been the foundation for a multitude of decentralized applications and projects in areas like decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and more. Its continued evolution and upgrades are aimed at addressing scalability and security concerns to ensure its long-term viability as a blockchain platform.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, Ethereum is a transformative digital currency that has disrupted traditional finance. Its underlying blockchain technology has the potential to revolutionize various industries. As you embark on your journey into the world of Ethereum, remember to stay informed, practice security measures, and explore the endless possibilities this cryptocurrency offers.\n\n1. Is Ethereum Legal? Yes, Ethereum is legal in most countries. However, it\u2019s essential to check your local regulations.\n\n2. How Do I Acquire Ethreum? You can acquire Ethreum through exchanges, mining, or by accepting it as payment for goods and services."

It stated that the average Ethereum transaction fee has dropped to $1.15, the lowest since Dec. 26, 2022.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSantiment emphasizes the historical significance of this as Ethereum's network fees reach yearly lows. Based on historical precedents, utility may begin to rise as ETH becomes less costly to circulate.

Historically, we see utility begin rising as ETH becomes more affordable to circulate. Increased utility can then lead to recovering market cap levels,\" Santiment tweeted.\n\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum was trading near $1,594, just below $1,600. If the utility that arises from decreased fees impacts prices, ETH may attempt an upside move that targets the $1,692 and $1,804 levels next.\n\nIf this is accomplished, Ethereum may retest the $2,000 mark last seen in July. ETH, on the other hand, is gaining support just below its current level of $1,540.\n\nETH total fees drop to nine-month lows\n\nAccompanying the drop in average fees, Ethereum network fees, which refer to the sum of total fees spent to utilize the blockchain, also fell to a nine-month low of $22.1 million in the week.\n\nPer IntoTheBlock data, total fees on Ethereum fell during the week by 9.3%, while ETH saw negative exchange flows of $130 million, a decrease of $20 million. The net amount of inflows minus outflows of a certain crypto-asset going in or out of centralized exchanges is referred to as exchange netflows.\n\nEthereum's falling fees, which are being driven in part by L2 adoption, might be putting some pressure on the second-largest crypto asset, as its supply has been increasing over the last month, reversing its deflationary trend."

        "content": "In recent weeks, Ethereum (ETH), one of the most valuable assets in the cryptocurrency market, has not enjoyed favorable sentiment due to its struggling price and unstable on-chain performance. The general market condition has not offered much reprieve either, as most altcoins have failed to maintain an upward momentum. Fortunately, the latest on-chain revelation offers some hope for the price of Ethereum.\n\nEthereum Average Fee Drops To Lowest Level In 2023\n\nOn-chain analytics have been helpful in providing real-time insights into crypto market trends. And the latest on-chain revelations have highlighted a plunge in Ethereum network fees, which might prove to be a turning point for the cryptocurrency\u2019s market value and performance.\n\nAccording to the on-chain analytics platform, Santiment, the Ethereum network fees have dropped to their lowest levels in 2023, with each transaction averaging about $1.15 as of this writing. This reflects a significant fall from the huge fees seen in 2021 and 2022, with demand for processing power causing the average fees to reach above $50.\n\nHistorically, such a decline in fees is a positive sign for Ethereum\u2019s utility and adoption, as lower costs make it more profitable and worthwhile to use the network. Santiment also noted that rising utility is often the case due to Ether tokens becoming more affordable to circulate.\n\nIt is worth noting that the impact of this development can spread to the overall market value of the digital asset. Increased utility and adoption can contribute to the recovery of Ethereum\u2019s market capitalization and value.\n\nThe Effect On ETH Price?\n\nIndeed, the plunging network fees positively benefit Ethereum and its users, especially as it can improve other network metrics and parameters. However, this development has not significantly impacted ETH price, as it seems to be struggling to break out from under the current selling pressure.\n\nOn Thursday, September 21, the cryptocurrency fell beneath the psychological $1,600 level for the second time this month. And the Ether token continues to trade below this price mark, with a roughly 2.6% decline in the past three days.\n\nInvestors will be watching to see if Ethereum can build positive network momentum while fees are low. However, it remains to be seen whether this will be enough to propel the ETH price out of consolidation, especially as there are no signs of buying pressure from Ethereum whales.\n\nThere are no signs of buying pressure from #Ethereum whales yet! pic.twitter.com/oqBbdbaOlb \u2014 Ali (@ali_charts) September 21, 2023\n\nMoreover, the dwindling number of major ETH holders adds zero optimism to this scenario. This is because such a decline in whale holdings can make the Ethereum price increasingly susceptible to downward pressure.\n\nAccording to CoinGecko data, the Ether token trades for $1,593, reflecting a 2.6% price dip in the past week. Ethereum is currently the second-largest cryptocurrency, with a market capitalization of $191.6 billion.\n\nEthereum price trading below $1,600 on the daily timeframe | Source: TOTAL chart on TradingView\n\nFeatured image from The Economic Times, chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "ETH Burn Mechanism Struggles Amid Interest Gain Projection - DailyCoin",
        "content": "Cryptocurrency markets have responded cautiously to hints of a Federal Reserve rate hike.\n\nCrypto capitalization has experienced a $30 billion reduction amid uncertain economic signals.\n\nEthereum\u2019s burn mechanism has encountered challenges as new ETH has entered the supply.\n\nIn response to the Federal Reserve\u2019s recent hints at a potential interest rate hike later this year, the digital asset market experienced a tentative sell-off this week. Despite the Fed\u2019s decision to maintain current interest rates on Wednesday, the prospect of an impending hike has cast uncertainty over the market.\n\nCrypto Market Sheds $30B as Fed Proposes Interest Rate Rise\n\nThe central bank\u2019s projections, unveiled alongside their announcement, indicate a median interest rate of 5.6% by the end of this year. This marks an uptick from the current range of 5.25% to 5.5%. The proposed rate increase received support from 12 Federal Reserve officials, while 9 opposed the idea.\n\nAccording to data from CoinMarketCap, the cryptocurrency market witnessed a decline of $30 billion in its overall capitalization. As a result, the combined capitalization now stands at $1.05 trillion, following a 3% retracement. Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) experienced a 2.5% and 3% drop, respectively, after the news, although they managed to regain roughly 1% since.\n\nETH\u2019s Burning Mechanism Challenged by Increase in Supply\n\nAdding to the situation\u2019s complexity, the close of September will also coincide with the expiration of $3 billion worth of quarterly Bitcoin options and $1.8 billion in contracts linked to ETH.\n\nEthereum\u2019s on-chain activity in September has been the weakest throughout the year. According to Ultra Sound Money, over 13,000 ETH (equivalent to $21 million) has been introduced into Ethereum\u2019s supply since the beginning of the month.\n\nThis suggests that Ethereum\u2019s burn mechanism has failed to counterbalance the influx of new ETH entering the supply as rewards for validators, particularly during this period of reduced activity.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nWhile the crypto market did see a retracement following the Fed\u2019s announcement, factors beyond the interest rate decision could have influenced their prices.\n\nEthereum\u2019s on-chain activity may have declined in September, but this could be attributed to various factors, including market sentiment and investor behavior, rather than solely the failure of the burn mechanism.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nThe Federal Reserve\u2019s potential interest rate hike and the resultant market fluctuations underscore the vulnerability of digital assets to macroeconomic shifts. This is a stark reminder of the crypto market\u2019s interconnectedness with traditional financial systems and the need for vigilance among crypto enthusiasts and investors.\n\nTo learn more about the challenges Ethereum faces amidst record-low fees, read here:\n\nETH Price Struggles Continue Despite Record-Low Network Fees\n\n\n\nTo stay updated on the recent mysterious XRP transfers involving millions, click here:\n\nMillions of XRP Moved in Mysterious Internal Transfers"

        "content": "Polygon Labs has suggested that the Celo blockchain community consider utilizing its Chain Development Kit (CDK) to streamline the intended layer-2 migration on the Ethereum network.\n\nThe proposal comes after cLabs, the primary development team behind Celo, unveiled an alternative strategy in July to transition its layer-1 into an Ethereum-compatible layer-2 solution by utilizing Optimism\u2019s OP Stack. OP Stack is a similar customizable toolkit that leverages Optimism\u2019s \u201coptimistic\u201d technology.\n\nMove to Ethereum Layer-2 Via Polygon CDK\n\nPolygon Labs\u2019 co-founder Sandeep Nailwal presented a proposal to the Celo community this week recommending that the blockchain ecosystem consider implementing Polygon\u2019s Chain Development Kit, which is a codebase enabling developers to build customized layer-2 chains leveraging zero-knowledge (ZK) technology.\n\nThe proposal on the Celo governance forum stated,\n\n\u201cPolygon Labs is excited to welcome Celo home to Ethereum in the chain\u2019s transition from an independent EVM-compatible L1 to an Ethereum L2. As Ethereum devotees obsessed with scaling, we are beyond excited to see Celo expand into an emerging and thriving Ethereum ecosystem and help extend Ethereum blockspace.\u201d\n\nNailwal explained that this shift would enable Celo to fully leverage the benefits of operating as an Ethereum layer-2 solution while preserving the fundamental traits that initially propelled the chain to success.\n\nThe exec further emphasized that the transition represents a significant technical enhancement, \u201cthat should come with built-in Ethereum alignment and as-close-as-possible developer experience, without compromising security.\u201d\n\nPolygon CDK\n\nThe Polygon CDK toolkit was released in August, designed to allow developers to build blockchain networks with the help of ZK proofs. This open-source codebase offers developers the ability to interconnect chains through a ZK-based bridge, creating a unified ecosystem referred to as the \u201cValue Layer.\u201d\n\nSubsequently, Cosmos-based layer-1 blockchain, Canto, announced migrating to a zero-knowledge layer-2 on Ethereum via Polygin CDK. The platform explained that this transition is in line with its objectives to build a blockchain dedicated to real-world assets(RWA).\n\nBesides Canto, pther projects such as Astar, Gnosis, and IDEX, have already announced plans to build ZK layer-2 solutions utilizing the toolkit."

        "content": "John Deaton, the attorney who represents the over 70,000 XRP token holders in the Ripple Vs U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) lawsuit, had kept the crypto community guessing about this announcement. However, there were hints that the announcement involved Steven Nerayoff, who was an early adviser in the Ethereum network project.\n\nThe attorney revealed that a major part of the announcement was about some of the very interesting claims made by Nerayoff, describing him as the most talked about person within the XRP community currently. Nerayoff claimed to have evidence of wrongdoings during the Ethereum initial coin offering in 2014.\n\nadvertisement\n\nAlso Read: Tether CTO Slams WSJ Article On Restarting Loans\n\nWho Is Steven Nerayoff?\n\nIn May 2023, a New York judge dismissed criminal extortion charges against the Ethereum early advisor. He was accused of extorting a crypto startup that he was consulted to assist in an ICO process. However, the federal prosecutors had admitted that they were unable to prove the charges in the indictment beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nThe Big Announcement: We\u2019re Getting Closer\n\nIn a massive revelation, Deaton claimed that he had personally seen some of the receipts that Nerayoff claims to have, in relation to the allegations he made on the Ethereum ICO, although the attorney did not exclusively name the crypto project due to attorney client privilege. He concluded based on the records he saw that the insiders of the Ethereum ICO were not telling the truth.\n\n\u201cI have seen some of the receipts Nerayoff claims to have. I understand that he was targeted by some people at a cryptocurrency project (ETH) and I understand why he feels that. I can conclude that people who distanced from Nerayoff are not telling the truth.\u201d\n\nIn the recent days, Nerayoff had been making allegations about the irregularities involved in the Ethereum initial coin offering (ICO) and the corrupt practices at the US SEC. In a tweet dated September 17, 2023, Nerayoff revealed about someone at Etheruem hiding the real number of ETH ICO buyers. \u201cWhales could disguise their large positions during the ICO,\u201d he revealed. More importantly, he admitted to having some documental proofs about the same.\n\n\u201cI might have the doc versions by the author of the TOS (Terms of Use) amongst countless documents, recordings, etc. all stored in a number of locations.\u201d\n\nAlso Read: El Salvador Bitcoin Critic Sen Menendez Indicted for Corruption\n\nImpact Of The Records On XRP Lawsuit\n\nAttorney Deaton further explained that if the trial against Ripple chief executive officer Brad Garlinghouse and the company\u2019s co-founder Christian Larsen goes forward, the cross examination of Bill Hinman records will be super difficult for the US SEC. The federal regulatory agency\u2019s December 22, 2020 complaint in the XRP lawsuit also charged the two top executives for allegedly raising capital through the sale of XRP in the form of unregistered securities. Earlier, CoinGape reported there was a change of attorney representing the CEO in this regard.\n\n\u201cTruth Will Come Out\u201d\n\nDeaton said he was not able to reveal many other details due to legal restrictions but concluded saying that as a community, \u201cWe\u2019re getting closer\u201d in the fight against regulators. \u201cThe truth will come out and we are getting closer,\u201d he said.\n\nIn this context, CoinGape had earlier reported that an Ethereum ICO participant sold as many as 6,000 ETH tokens worth around $10 million. In August, it was reported that an address labled with the name of Ethereum cofounder Vitalik Buterin saw a transfer of 3,000 ETH. Compared to a month ago, the ETH price is trading around 0.80% lower at the time of writing.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum On-Chain Metrics Tank After Shanghai Upgrade, Should Investors Worry?"

They are trading near $26,500 and $1,600, respectively, with an intriguing neutrality, potentially influenced by a tempered trading volume.\n\nSuch a tight trading range can often serve as a harbinger for a breakout, and as investors eagerly scrutinize each shift, it becomes paramount to understand the underlying sentiments.\n\nAt the same time, the Fear & Greed Index remains neutral, suggesting indecision among investors. This could be one of the reasons behind the neutral trading bias in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nLet\u2019s now dive into the technical aspects of the BTC/USD and ETH/USD pairs.\n\nBitcoin Price\n\nAs of the latest update, Bitcoin is priced at $26,557, boasting a 24-hour trading volume of $10 billion. Reflecting a modest decline, the digital asset has depreciated by 0.31% over the past day.\n\nIt retains its premier position on CoinMarketCap, supported by a live market capitalization of approximately $517.69 billion.\n\nThe available circulating supply registers at 19,493,312 BTC coins, approaching its predefined maximum of 21,000,000 BTC coins\n\nBitcoin Price Prediction\n\nFrom a technical perspective, Bitcoin demonstrates increased market sensitivity, recently surpassing the critical support level pegged at $26,600.\n\nThis benchmark previously acted as a resistance point. However, consistent confirmations, most notably on the 4-hour chart, have elevated its significance as a robust support zone for the cryptocurrency.\n\nFollowing its descent below the $26,650 mark, Bitcoin seems to gravitate towards an immediate support level of $26,300.\n\nAs evidenced on the 4-hour chart, the cryptocurrency now positions itself beneath the 50-day exponential moving average and has deviated from its prior ascending trajectory.\n\nBitcoin Price Chart \u2013 Source: Tradingview\n\nShould this downward trend continue, Bitcoin\u2019s next target could potentially be the $25,511 mark.\n\nConversely, overcoming the $27,000 threshold might set Bitcoin on a trajectory towards $27,500.\n\nThis $27,000 juncture, underscored by the 50-day average, is a decisive pivot point dictating Bitcoin\u2019s forthcoming market direction.\n\nEthereum Price\n\nEthereum is currently trading for $1,593, accompanied by a 24-hour trading volume of $3 billion.

        "content": "While Ethereum struggles with challenges, an intriguing on-chain revelation has emerged.\n\nNetwork fees for Ethereum have experienced a sharp decline, hitting their lowest levels in 2023.\n\nDespite these developments, Ethereum\u2019s price has grappled with substantial selling pressure.\n\nIn recent weeks, Ethereum (ETH), a prominent asset in the cryptocurrency market, has faced a downturn in sentiment, primarily due to its struggling price performance and the instability witnessed in its on-chain operations.\n\nUnfortunately, this unfavorable situation has extended to most other altcoins, with few sustaining upward momentum. However, a glimmer of hope is on the horizon, courtesy of a recent on-chain revelation.\n\nEthereum Average Fee Hits a New Low for 2023\n\nSantiment, a platform specializing in on-chain data analytics, has revealed a pivotal moment for Ethereum\u2019s performance. The intelligence firm has noted that the network\u2019s fees have fallen significantly, reaching their lowest levels in 2023, with each transaction now averaging around $1.15 at press time.\n\n\ud83e\udd11 #Ethereum network fees have dropped down to its lowest level of 2023, at just $1.15 per transaction. Historically, we see utility begin rising as $ETH becomes more affordable to circulate. Increased utility can then lead to recovering market cap levels. https://t.co/MpOLfMYKUp pic.twitter.com/JI8ZLhmb4p \u2014 Santiment (@santimentfeed) September 23, 2023\n\nThis sharp decline starkly contrasts the huge fees witnessed in 2021 and 2022, where the surge in demand for processing power drove average fees well above the $50 mark. Historically, such a fee reduction bodes well for Ethereum\u2019s practicality and adoption, as lower transaction costs render the network more enticing and economically viable for users.\n\nSantiment has also underscored that enhanced utility often accompanies these reduced costs as ether tokens become more accessible for circulation. The utility and increased adoption of the Ethereum network have the potential to contribute to the recovery of its market capitalization and overall value.\n\nEthereum Price Struggles Despite Network Fee Decline\n\nWhile the decline in network fees brings tangible benefits to Ethereum and its user base, the impact on ETH\u2019s price has remained relatively muted, with the cryptocurrency struggling to break free from the ongoing selling pressure.\n\nOn Thursday, September 21st, ETH dipped below the significant psychologically $1,600 threshold for the second time this month, and it continues to hover below this benchmark, exhibiting a modest 2.6% decline over the past week.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nThe drop in Ethereum network fees may be driven by decreased network activity rather than increased efficiency.\n\nWith the rise of alternative blockchain networks offering lower fees and faster transaction times, Ethereum may face challenges in retaining its user base and attracting new users.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nThe significant drop in Ethereum\u2019s network fees holds substantial implications for the cryptocurrency community. This fee reduction not only enhances Ethereum\u2019s utility and adoption but also has the potential to contribute to the recovery of its market capitalization and overall value, offering a glimmer of hope amid recent market challenges.\n\nTo learn more about Ethereum\u2019s anticipated upgrade delay and its impact on the crypto community, read here:\n\nEthereum\u2019s Next Major Upgrade Likely to Be Delayed: Core Devs\n\n\n\nFor insights into the recent $31 million move involving an ETH ICO wallet and its connections to Ethereum\u2019s key figures, check out this article:\n\nETH ICO Wallet Linked to Dev Joins Buterin, Whales in $31M Move"

The community has long wondered whether Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum, had a genuine fascination with Ripple.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis talk follows earlier comments by Matt Hamilton, the former director of developer relations at Ripple, who revealed that Buterin had sought an internship opportunity at Ripple and had even slept on the couch of the company's CTO, David Schwartz.\n\nNerayoff, who had conversations with Buterin, shared some insights into Buterin's thought process. He mentioned that Buterin had once expressed a desire to implement smart contracts on the Bitcoin network. However, his proposal was met with resistance from developers, which may have led him to explore other blockchain projects.\n\nRegarding Ripple, Nerayoff explained that his discussions with Buterin about the company were based on his encounters with Ripple representatives, whom he himself viewed as exemplars of effective operational practices within the blockchain industry.\n\nNo idea. He told me he wanted to implement smart contracts on Bitcoin but the devs didn\u2019t want it. I spoke to him about Ripple but that was bc I had met the Ripple folks and used them as an example of how a company should be operated in this space. Ripple has been following me\u2026 \u2014 Steven Nerayoff (@StevenNerayoff) September 23, 2023\n\nNerayoff also recalled an incident from 2015 when he attended a conference where he encountered Chris Larson, a co-founder of Ripple, and another member of the Ripple team. During this event, questions related to XRP were directed to only one specific individual within the organization.\n\nNerayoff's insights have reignited the debate surrounding Vitalik Buterin's true interests and intentions during his interactions with Ripple. The question remains: Did Ethereum founder harbor a genuine interest in Ripple and XRP, or were there more nuanced factors at play behind the scenes?"

        "content": "The crypto market participants have in recent days began engaging in the debate around Ethereum Gate, which refers to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) allegedly giving preferential treatment to Ethereum Foundation. With XRP attorney John Deaton revealing that he had seen documents related to the alleged wrongdoings, it is being speculated that these developments mark just the beginning of a long drawn expose.\n\nAlso Read: OpenSea Reportedly Suffers Leak After Nansen Breach\n\nadvertisement\n\nAttorney Client Privilege: What It Means?\n\nThe talk around Ethereum Gate intensified as Steven Nerayoff, an early advisor at the Ethereum Foundation, said in a September 17, 2023 tweet that people at the Foundation were hiding the real number of ETH buyers during the cryptocurrency\u2019s 2014 initial coin offering (ICO). Earlier, CoinGape reported XRP lawyer John Deaton\u2019s revelation that he had seen some of the \u2018receipts\u2019 that may uncover truth about the ICO numbers.\n\nWhile agreeing to have seen the records, the lawyer apparently indicated Ethereum when he said he was not able to reveal the names as he was bounded by attorney client privilege. This means Nerayoff entered into an engagement agreement with attorney Deaton. This could essentially mean Deaton representing the former ETH advisor in the court if required.\n\nFred Rispoli, another attorney, clarified that the attorney client privilege could mean huge implications coming ahead. He warned that the partnership could lead to massive implications with \u201cVery big things to come.\u201d Does this mean Nerayoff suing the Ethereum Foundation over framing of fraud charges?\n\nXRP Lawsuit Impact\n\nAttorney Deaton, is known for his views that the US SEC favored Ethereum while making Ripple (XRP) project a scapegoat with the enforcement actions. Hence, a potential lawsuit filing on behalf of Nerayoff could be in the making over the next few months.\n\nAlso Read: Is Terra Co-Founder Do Kwon Coming To US? SEC Files Motion In Court"

        "title": "Ethereum has been disappointing since Shanghai upgrade, Hong Kong to release Stablecoin Regulations - Tekedia",
        "content": "JPMorgan, one of the largest banks in the world, has issued a report criticizing Ethereum\u2019s recent network upgrade, dubbed Shanghai. The report claims that the upgrade, which was supposed to improve scalability, security and efficiency, has failed to deliver on its promises and has instead resulted in higher fees, lower throughput and increased complexity.\n\nAccording to JPMorgan, Shanghai has not addressed the fundamental challenges that Ethereum faces, such as the trade-off between decentralization and performance, the vulnerability to congestion and attacks, and the lack of interoperability with other blockchains. The report also questions the viability of Ethereum 2.0, the long-awaited transition to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism that aims to solve many of these issues.\n\nThe Ethereum community was eagerly awaiting the Shanghai upgrade, which was supposed to bring significant improvements to the network\u2019s scalability, security and efficiency. However, the upgrade has turned out to be a disappointment, as it failed to deliver on its promises and introduced new problems.\n\nOne of the main features of the Shanghai upgrade was the implementation of sharding, a technique that splits the network into smaller pieces, or shards, that can process transactions in parallel. This was expected to increase the network\u2019s throughput and reduce congestion and fees. However, sharding has also created new challenges, such as increased complexity, coordination costs and security risks. Moreover, sharding has not solved the scalability issue completely, as the network still relies on a single shard, called the beacon chain, to coordinate the other shards and ensure consensus.\n\nAnother feature of the Shanghai upgrade was the transition from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS), a consensus mechanism that replaces miners with validators who stake their ether to secure the network. PoS was supposed to make the network more secure, efficient and environmentally friendly, as it eliminates the need for costly and energy-intensive mining. However, PoS has also introduced new vulnerabilities, such as the possibility of validator collusion, censorship and attacks. Furthermore, PoS has not made the network more efficient, as it requires validators to run nodes 24/7 and keep their ether locked in a long period of time.\n\nThe Shanghai upgrade was also supposed to improve the network\u2019s efficiency by implementing EIP-1559, a proposal that changes the fee structure of Ethereum transactions. EIP-1559 was designed to make fees more predictable and fairer, by introducing a base fee that adjusts dynamically according to network demand and a tip that users can pay to prioritize their transactions. EIP-1559 was also expected to reduce the supply of ether by burning a portion of the base fee. However, EIP-1559 has not achieved its goals, as fees remain high and volatile, users still overpay for transactions and ether inflation is not significantly affected.\n\nJPMorgan\u2019s report is not the first time that the bank has expressed skepticism about Ethereum and its prospects. In 2017, JPMorgan\u2019s CEO Jamie Dimon famously called Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency and Ethereum\u2019s main rival, a \u201cfraud\u201d and said that he would fire any employee who traded it. However, since then, JPMorgan has softened its stance on crypto and has even launched its own digital currency, JPM Coin, which runs on a private version of Ethereum.\n\nThe report has sparked a heated debate among crypto enthusiasts and experts, who have different opinions on Ethereum\u2019s performance and potential. Some agree with JPMorgan\u2019s assessment and argue that Ethereum is losing its edge to newer and more innovative platforms, such as Solana, Cardano and Polkadot. Others disagree and defend Ethereum\u2019s achievements and vision, pointing out that it is still the most widely used and developed blockchain in the world, with a vibrant ecosystem of applications, developers and users.\n\nThe Shanghai upgrade has failed to deliver on its promises of improving scalability, security and efficiency of the Ethereum network. Instead, it has introduced new problems and trade-offs that undermine the network\u2019s performance and user experience. The Ethereum community should reconsider its roadmap and priorities and focus on finding solutions that can truly address the network\u2019s challenges and fulfill its potential.\n\nHong Kong looks to release Stablecoin Regulations by mid-2024\n\nHong Kong is planning to introduce a regulatory framework for stablecoins by the middle of 2024, according to a lawmaker who is involved in the drafting process. Stablecoins are digital tokens that are pegged to a fiat currency or other assets and are widely used in the cryptocurrency sector for trading and payments.\n\nStablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency that are designed to maintain a stable value relative to a fiat currency, a commodity, or a basket of assets. They are often seen as a way to reduce the volatility and risk of holding cryptocurrencies, as well as to facilitate payments and remittances across borders. However, stablecoins also pose significant challenges and risks for the crypto industry and the broader financial system.\n\nThe lawmaker, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that the Hong Kong government is aware of the growing popularity and potential risks of stablecoins, especially after the launch of Diem, the rebranded version of Facebook\u2019s Libra project, which aims to create a global payment system based on a basket of currencies and assets.\n\nOne of the main challenges of stablecoins is ensuring that they are fully backed by the underlying assets or reserves that they claim to represent. This requires a high level of transparency, auditability, and regulation, which may not always be present or consistent across different stablecoin issuers and jurisdictions. For example, in 2019, the New York Attorney General accused Tether, one of the largest and most popular stablecoins, of misleading investors and regulators about its reserve backing and its relationship with Bitfinex, a crypto exchange that had suffered a massive hack.\n\nThis raised doubts about the credibility and solvency of Tether and its ability to maintain its peg to the US dollar. Similarly, in 2020, the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) banned CryptoSpend, a crypto debit card provider that used Wirecard as its payment processor, after Wirecard filed for insolvency amid allegations of fraud and accounting irregularities. This left CryptoSpend users unable to access their funds, which were partly denominated in stablecoins.\n\nAnother challenge of stablecoins is managing the trade-off between stability and decentralization. Some stablecoins, such as DAI, are algorithmically governed by smart contracts and rely on overcollateralization and market incentives to maintain their peg. However, this also makes them vulnerable to technical glitches, governance disputes, and market shocks that could disrupt their stability or functionality. For instance, in March 2020, DAI experienced a sudden spike in demand and price due to the market crash caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThis resulted in undercollateralized loans, liquidation penalties, and governance issues that threatened the viability of the DAI system. On the other hand, some stablecoins, such as USDC and GUSD, are centrally issued and regulated by reputable entities and follow strict compliance standards. However, this also exposes them to legal and regulatory risks, such as censorship, seizure, or sanctions by authorities that may not be favorable to crypto.\n\nA third challenge of stablecoins is balancing the benefits and costs of interoperability and innovation. Stablecoins offer a unique opportunity to bridge the gap between traditional finance and crypto, as well as to enable new use cases and applications for both sectors. For example, stablecoins can facilitate cross-border payments and remittances, enhance financial inclusion and access, enable decentralized lending and borrowing platforms, and support tokenization and digitalization of real-world assets. However, stablecoins also introduce new complexities and uncertainties for the crypto industry and the wider financial system.\n\nFor example, stablecoins could pose systemic risks if they become widely adopted and interconnected with other financial instruments or infrastructures, such as exchanges, wallets, or payment networks. Stablecoins could also create regulatory arbitrage or fragmentation if they operate across different jurisdictions or regimes without adequate coordination or oversight. Stablecoins could also disrupt or compete with existing monetary policies or currencies if they challenge the sovereignty or dominance of central banks or governments.\n\nThe Hong Kong lawmaker said that the government is studying the experiences and best practices of other jurisdictions, such as Singapore, the UK and the EU, which have already proposed or implemented regulations for stablecoins. The lawmaker added that the government is also consulting with the industry and the public on the matter and expects to release a consultation paper by the end of this year.\n\nThe lawmaker said that the main objectives of the regulation are to ensure the stability and security of stablecoins, to protect consumers and investors, and to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing. The lawmaker said that the regulation will likely cover issues such as licensing, governance, capital requirements, disclosure, auditing, risk management and consumer protection.\n\nThe lawmaker said that the regulation will apply to both centralized and decentralized stablecoins, as well as to domestic and cross-border transactions. The lawmaker said that the regulation will not stifle innovation or competition in the sector, but rather provide clarity and certainty for the market participants.\n\nStablecoins are a fascinating and promising innovation that have the potential to transform the crypto industry and the global financial system. However, they also entail significant challenges and risks that need to be carefully addressed and managed by all stakeholders involved. As the stablecoin market grows and evolves, it is crucial to foster a balanced and collaborative approach that ensures stability, security, transparency, compliance, innovation, and inclusion for all.\n\nThe lawmaker said that Hong Kong is well-positioned to become a hub for stablecoin innovation and adoption, given its status as a global financial center and its proximity to mainland China, where digital yuan trials are underway. The lawmaker said that Hong Kong can leverage its existing strengths in fintech and blockchain to attract more stablecoin projects and investors to the city.\n\nHong Kong is planning to introduce a regulatory framework for stablecoins by the middle of 2024, according to a lawmaker who is involved in the drafting process.

        "content": "The world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency Ethereum (ETH) has once again come under strong selling pressure and is trading under $1,600. While the Ether (ETH) price has struggled to keep up with the upside momentum, some network parameters like the gas fees are showing signs of cooling down.\n\nOn-chain data provider Santiment explained that the fees on the Ethereum network have reached their lowest point in 2023, with transaction costs now at just $1.15. This reduction in fees historically corresponds to an increase in Ethereum\u2019s utility, as lower fees make it more cost-effective to use the network. As utility rises, it can contribute to the recovery of market capitalization levels.\n\nadvertisement\n\nWhile this is a positive development concerning the on-chain metrics, the Ethereum price continues to be under selling pressure. Earlier this week, on September 19th, Ethereum (ETH) encountered its third rejection from a descending trendline, signaling the formation of successively lower highs on the daily chart, which strongly suggests a prevailing bearish sentiment.\n\nOver the past three days, ETH, the second-largest cryptocurrency, has declined by 3.8%, currently priced at $1596. If this bearish trend persists, there is a possibility of Ethereum experiencing an additional 4% decline, potentially targeting the $1460 support level.\n\nAlso, the massive transfer of $31 million ETH through Vitalik Buterin\u2019s wallet has stirred excitement within the Ethereum community. But on-chain data shows that there\u2019s no buying pressure from the whales to lead to any kind of reversal on the upside.\n\nThere are no signs of buying pressure from #Ethereum whales yet! pic.twitter.com/oqBbdbaOlb \u2014 Ali (@ali_charts) September 21, 2023\n\nConcerns Around Ethereum Staking\n\nMembers of the Ethereum community have shared concerns over a major drop in the staking inflows along with the major concentration of Ethereum staking.\n\nThe staking inflow total, which quantifies the unique addresses transferring coins to the official Beacon Chain deposit address for staking, displayed a consistent growth trajectory, surging from approximately 5,952 on April 3 to 404,704 on June 1.\n\nThis remarkable increase was notably fueled by the activation of the Shapella upgrade on April 12. For instance, between April 12 and June 1, the staking inflow total escalated from 16,736 to 404,704, marking an astonishing more than 25-fold surge. But as seen in the below image, the total ETH staked has been consistently dropping since May 2023.\n\nAs reported by CoinGape, several on-chain metrics for Ethereum, including network activity, have dropped since the Shapella upgrade. Furthermore, there\u2019s a massive concentration of ETH staking in the hands of a few liquid staking protocols like Lido Finance."

In contrast, Bitcoin [BTC] and Ethereum [ETH], the two largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, have remained relatively flat over the same period.\n\n? As #Bitcoin remains in its $26K to $27K range, more #altcoins are spiking following whale accumulation and network growth. $LINK has notably climbed to $7.08, and $EXRD surged up to $0.067.

This represented a 44% jump from the 551 new addresses created on 10 September.\n\nRegarding the daily count of unique addresses that have been active on the Chainlink network either as a sender or receiver, it has also rallied by 41% in the past two weeks.\n\nNo holds barred for LINK\n\nReadings made from LINK\u2019s price movements on a daily chart confirmed the bullish momentum in the alt\u2019s market. Key momentum indicators rested above their respective center lines at press time, suggesting that spot traders have continued to accumulate the token.\n\nFor example, LINK\u2019s Relative Strength Index (RSI) was 64.88. Its Money Flow Index (MFI) at 81.55 suggested that the token might even be overbought due to increased accumulation pressure.\n\nIts Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) \u2013 which tracks an asset\u2019s buying and selling pressure over a period of time \u2013 was positioned above the zero line at 0.23. CMF values above the zero line indicate that there is more buying pressure than selling pressure.\n\nIn LINK\u2019s futures market, bullish sentiment was also spotted. The token\u2019s Open Interest has risen by 69% since 17 September, according to data from Coinglass. At press time, this was $181 million.\n\nLikewise, the token\u2019s funding rates across exchanges have been predominantly positive within the same period. While there have been days marked by negative funding rates, most traders in LINK\u2019s futures market have continued to place bets in favor of a price rally.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s LINK\u2019s market cap in BTC\u2019s terms\n\nNot ready to sell\n\nAn assessment of the alt\u2019s exchange activity revealed a decline in sell-off activity in the past few days. After a period of increased sell-offs, the past few days have seen a decline in profit-taking activity.\n\nData from Glassnode showed LINK\u2019s Net Transfer Volume from/to Exchanges to be negative since 22 September, suggesting that more LINK tokens have since been transferred off exchanges than onto exchanges."

        "title": "Vitalik Buterin Warns CBDCs Moving in Wrong Direction, Calls Them \u2018Front Ends\u2019 for the Banking System: Report - The Daily Hodl",
        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) co-creator Vitalik Buterin reportedly says that central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) are not developing in the way he had once hoped for.\n\nIn a new interview with CNBC, Buterin says that he was once more optimistic about CBDCs, but now he believes they have mostly become \u201cfront ends\u201d for the traditional banking system.\n\n\u201c[The CBDC] space is where I think I had somewhat more hope, probably naively, five years ago, because there were a lot of people who wanted to do things like make them blockchain-friendly, give actual transparency and verifiability guarantees, and some kind of level of actual privacy\u2026\n\nAs each and every one of those projects come to a certain maturity, [they] all sort of fall away as the thing comes closer and closer to being a 1.0. We get systems that are not actually much better than existing payment systems because they just basically end up being different front-ends for the existing banking system.\u201d\n\nAccording to Buterin, CBDCs likely won\u2019t be private digital assets. Instead, he says CBDCs will allow the government and corporations to monitor the financial transactions of those who use them.\n\n\u201cThey end up being even less private and basically break down all of the existing barriers against both corporations and the government at the same time.\u201d\n\nThe former billionaire goes on to say that Ethereum may be more likely to stand up to government interference, especially now that the leading smart contract protocol is running a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism.\n\n\u201cProof-of-stake is actually easier to anonymize and harder to shut down than proof-of-work is. Proof-of-work requires huge amounts of physical equipment and requires huge amounts of electricity. These are exactly the kinds of things that drug enforcement agencies have decades of experience detecting.\u201d\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "In a recent interview with CNBC\u2019s MacKenzie Sigalos in Prague, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin shared his thoughts on a range of topics, from the platform\u2019s future to the regulatory landscape affecting the crypto industry.\n\nButerin began by discussing his nomadic lifestyle, stating that he avoids certain countries, including his native Russia, due to the risks associated with his work in cryptocurrency. He emphasized that the primary challenge for Ethereum is to offer genuine value to its users. According to him, the platform has spent the last decade experimenting and must now focus on building applications that people will actually use.\n\nButerin also touched upon his public persona. Despite not actively seeking fame, he stated that his primary focus is creating a world where people have equitable access to financial resources, irrespective of location. He added that his transparent communication style and willingness to engage in profound philosophical discussions have made him a trusted thought leader within the crypto community.\n\nDiscussing the utility of cryptocurrencies, Buterin said they are most useful in emerging economies where they can solve real-world problems like payments and savings. He cited his experiences in countries like Argentina, where crypto adoption is high, as evidence of its practical utility.\n\nOn the topic of regulatory shifts, Buterin observed that as U.S. regulators intensify their scrutiny of the crypto sector, the industry\u2019s focus is shifting overseas. He noted that while U.S. investors often view crypto as a speculative asset, people in developing countries use it for practical purposes.\n\nButerin expressed concerns about the reliance on centralized platforms like Binance for crypto transactions. He argued that these centralized entities are vulnerable to external pressures and corruption. He also emphasized the importance of privacy and security in the Ethereum ecosystem, stating that people need to have wallets that are secure, and if they lose the keys, they shouldn\u2019t lose everything.\n\nRegarding Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), Buterin stated that they end up being even less private and break down existing barriers against both corporations and the government. He also revealed that Ethereum is focusing on enhancing privacy and scalability through technologies like zero-knowledge rollups.\n\nButerin mentioned that Ethereum\u2019s shift to a proof-of-stake model is more likely to withstand government intervention, as it is easier to anonymize and harder to shut down. He added that Ethereum has evolved into a self-governing ecosystem, resilient enough to function even if he or the Ethereum Foundation were targeted. He emphasized that there are entire companies that maintain Ethereum clients, making the platform resilient with no single point of failure."

        "content": "In the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrency, Ethereum has long stood as a beacon of innovation and success. However, recent accusations by a former advisor, Steven Nerayoff, have cast a shadow of doubt over the integrity of its operations, particularly during its formative years. As Ethereum has grown in stature and market capitalization, so too have the complexities surrounding its inner workings and the characters at its helm.\n\nThe latest revelations brought forth by Nerayoff not only challenge the ethos upon which Ethereum was built but also pit key figures in the crypto world against one another, threatening to unearth secrets that could shake the very foundations of the community.\n\nFraud allegations and character assassination claims\n\nNerayoff has brought to light a coordinated attack against him, accusing both Vitalik Buterin and his father, Dmitry Buterin, of a concerted effort to tarnish his reputation. As evidence, he cited a video in which Vitalik can be heard alleging that Nerayoff was involved in significant fraudulent activities connected to the extortion of an ICO.\n\nIn a statement, Nerayoff said, \u201cThis is a Father/Son coordinated & scripted character assassination to make me their fall guy. Vitalik Buterin falsely accused me of committing a \u2018huge amount of fraud\u2019 \u2013 or was he just diverting attention from himself?\u201d\n\nControversial revelations surrounding the Ethereum ICO\n\nThe controversy doesn\u2019t end there. XRP lawyer, John Deaton, has recently revealed that he has seen some of the receipts held by Nerayoff, suggesting inconsistencies during Ethereum\u2019s initial coin offering (ICO) in 2014. This claim adds another layer to the ongoing tensions and suspicions around Ethereum\u2019s early days.\n\nPreviously reported claims by both Nerayoff and Deaton suggesting the possession of documents that reveal malpractices within the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as well as during the Ethereum ICO. There are suggestions that certain individuals at the Ethereum Foundation might not have been entirely truthful concerning the accusations against Nerayoff. As the drama unfolds, Deaton alluded to more significant revelations on the horizon, stating, \u201cThe truth will come out, and we are getting closer.\u201d\n\nEthereum foundation accused of abandoning Staff following North Korea incident\n\nAdding more fuel to the fire, Nerayoff has alleged that the Ethereum Foundation, under the guidance of Vitalik Buterin, turned its back on one of its senior researchers and developers, Virgil Griffith, following his arrest. Griffith was accused and subsequently \u201cConvicted of helping North Korea evade sanctions.\u201d This significant incident was highlighted by a 2019 article from Trust Nodes, which reported that the Ethereum Foundation seemed to distance itself entirely from the Griffith arrest ordeal.\n\nNerayoff commented on the matter, emphasizing that the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s apparent lack of support for Griffith after his arrest was a stark display of their true colors, leaving one of their own to face serious charges without any backing or support.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe world of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, despite its promise of transparency and decentralized operations, is not free from controversies and internal conflicts. The allegations against Vitalik Buterin and the Ethereum Foundation, brought forth by Steven Nerayoff and supported by John Deaton\u2019s recent revelations, paint a picture of potential intrigue and alleged misconduct in the early days of one of the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrencies."

        "title": "Ripple: Overall transactions exceed those of Ethereum - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "The Cryptonomist conducted an interview with Markus Infanger of RippleX during the annual APEX Dev Summit that was held in September in Amsterdam, to talk about the latest news about Ripple\u2019s development and more.\n\nWhat is the latest news for RippleX?\n\nIn a nutshell, we are working on growth and innovation. The community is growing, we have more developers compared to last year, during this Apex Dev Summit we have hundreds of projects that are starting to build on the XRP Ledger, we have different programs like the grants program, new hackathons. All of this in a period where Web3 mainnets are probably not gaining but losing their hype.\n\nRegarding XRP Ledger, from a technical point of view, we are super excited about the AMM amendment voting that is gonna be up on the network in a couple of days. That was proposed by RippleX engineers and we will be able to introduce a native AMM that is gonna to bring interesting features with it. The community is super excited about that, about how seamlessly it has been integrated in a decentralized protocol and it can bring liquidity on the network overall.\n\nAlso in terms of interoperability we have a few things in the pipeline as a crosschain bridge proposal which should be later this year. We have the root network as well, which is basically a separate project building a metaverse oriented network that integrates with the NFT standard to the XRP Ledger using XRP gas token. So you can see in multiple directions that there are a lot of innovative things happening on the root network but on XRPL as well.\n\nHow decisive do you think tokenization will be in the coming years and how will it impact the web3 world?\n\nTokenization has a massive role. It\u2019s the entrance gate from the world we know into Web3. When you look at the total sum of existing real world financial assets at large, we are talking about over a quadrillion dollars which in terms of total of the rest of the market is massive.\n\nBlockchain technology can really pave the way to remove the frictions within the traditional financial market and bring efficiency, reducing costs and making it more seamless for everybody to move, manage and store these types of assets.\n\nEven the larger top 20 banks in the world are having an active blockchain strategy and tokenization is one of the key areas they are looking into. Even BlackRock said this is gonna be the next generation for the financial market.\n\nHow are you working to accelerate the development of the XRP ledger infrastructure?\n\nTogether with this community. There are programs that drive community growth, whether it\u2019s the one billion XRP fund to support the grant program or the XRP accelerator program which Ripple helps to run together with the community who review projects.\n\nI think there are more than a thousand of projects on the XRPL. There are also some key stakeholders that really help around the ledger performance such as XRP Labs that is helping to support a lot of infrastructure elements, and the XRPL Foundation.\n\nWhat are the scalability and interoperability limits of XRP ledger?\n\nI would say one of the key differences for the XRP Ledger is that it is a very efficient and scalable blockchain. That was really one of the design principles since the beginning: transactions happen in 3 to 5 seconds, very reliably for over a decade now. There are over a million transactions a day now and 2.6 billion transactions have been facilitated on the XRP Ledger. That is more than Ethereum by the way. From the outset it\u2019s a very efficient blockchain.\n\nOf course XRPL impact on the real economy increases and so increasing performance will be an important aspect. So this ongoing work in terms of usage, improving fundamentally infrastructures, is something that Ripple X is focused on but is also something that the community is working on.\n\nCredefi.Finance 2.0 has just gone live on XRPL. How does the protocol make \u201cinnovative lending\u201d? Could you summarize how the platform works for our readers?\n\nI would describe this as a Web 2.0 or CeFi solution so what is basically does is that stablecoin holders on the XRPL can lend their stablecoins on a centralized platform, Credefi, which has a rigorous risk management structure and it has zero failure so far and basically it gets fund, so whatever real world needs to have capital because they are struggling having capitals by the existing banking system. I think they are mainly focusing on the manufacturing areas."

The blockchain is not only speedy but also has incredible access.\n\nThe blockchain, when combined with the NFT landscape, offers a new recipe that is more delicious than ever. The blending of Solana with the NFT is highly appreciated, offering mass adoption. Based on the recent news, the blockchain has rocked the NFT stage with its outstanding performance. However, Ethereum NFTs are also performing well in the NFT industry, giving tough competition to Solana and other blockchains.\n\nCurrent Performance and Stats\n\nThe continuous ups and downs in the numbers just seek the attention of individuals towards the NFT space.\n\nAccording to DeFiLlama, one of the biggest analytics panels for various DeFi protocols, Solana\u2019s present total value locked (TVL) is around $306.8 Million. Solana is performing well, as per the recent analysis and reports.\n\nFocusing on the current value, 1 SOL is priced around $18, representing a speed of growth and resilience. However, the price is not at its all-time high, but it\u2019s still good when compared with other players in the NFT industry.\n\nSolana NFT space is becoming more popular among NFT enthusiasts, providing a one-stop shop for all things Solana. In addition, anti-FUD measures taken by Solana enthusiasts to battle the upcoming FTX liquidation can be another reason for Solana\u2019s rising popularity.\n\nHowever, Ethereum, a decentralized open-source blockchain system featuring its own cryptocurrency, is a major competitor of Solana when talking about NFT. Ethereum holds a powerful and unbeatable position in the NFT industry, offering updated NFT marketplaces. Solana, on the other hand, is a growing NFT marketplace and is expected to achieve much more in the near future.\n\nConsidering the current price, the SOL price is $19.55, a hike of 2.52% in the past 24 hours, with a market cap of $8 Billion and a 24-hour volume of $192 Million.\n\nConclusion\n\nSolana, one of the most efficient, scalable, decentralized, and secure blockchain platforms, is all set to shake the NFT industry in the near future. Solana\u2019s #1 NFT Market beat the NFT industry running on the Ethereum network. Solana\u2019s current TVL stands at $306.8 Million and is predicted to achieve new heights. Ethereum, on the other hand, is also performing well and is expected to give tough competition to Solana."

        "title": "Much-Awaited Dencun Upgrade of Ethereum Maybe Behind Schedule - The Coin Republic",
        "content": "Ethereum announced a major upgrade called \u201cDeneb-Cancun\u201d or \u201cDencun\u201d a while ago. Reportedly, it was supposed to fix the scalability issues while implementing an improvement proposal named EIP-4844. However, the development team recently revealed that the much-awaited upgrade may get delayed. Before getting into the nitty-gritty of it, let\u2019s learn what Dencun really is.\n\nWhat Makes Dencun So Significant?\n\nAs mentioned above, the upgrade will help Ethereum to be more scalable. It will bring changes across the network\u2019s two mainnet layers: the execution layer and the consensus layer. While the former will supervise smart contract execution, the latter will take care of consensus via staking. Moreover, the upgrade will be implemented in a categorized fashion.\n\nThe one that will be applied to the execution layer will be called Cancun. On the other hand, the consensus one will be known as the moniker Deneb. Thus, together they are called Deneb-Cancun. The most notable feature of this upgrade is the Ethereum Improvement Proposal 4844. Also known as proto-danksharding, this proposal will accelerate the network\u2019s scalability.\n\nMoreover, it will take the existing capabilities of Layer 2 solutions ahead. The EIP-4844 will activate the retrieval of off-chain data and temporary storage by Ethereum nodes. By doing so, it will address the storage and data requirements of various blockchain applications. Also, developers are expecting that EIP-4844 will bring down the transaction costs on Layer 2 rollup solutions. Programs like Arbitrum and Optimism will benefit from this update.\n\nWhat is the Reason Behind the Delay?\n\nOn September 21, Ethereum\u2019s consensus-layer team held a meeting to discuss the launch plan for Dencun. The moderator of the meeting, Tim Beiko from the Ethereum Foundation, expressed concerns about the delay. He said that the upgrade lacks exposure to public testnets like Holesky, Goerli, and Sepolia. He also underlined the significance of Dencun\u2019s launch before Devconnect, an Ethereum-focused developer conference slated for November 2023.\n\nBeiko said that if Dencun isn\u2019t launched before the conference, its mainnet activation may not happen this year. According to him, it could impact some other plans of the network as well. Nevertheless, he took cognizance of the current situation and accepted the impending eventuality. He said that there are many technicalities to reckon with and the time is not sufficient. So, probably, the Dencun\u2019s deployment on the mainnet will happen after Christmas.\n\nAdditionally, he explained that Dencun\u2019s seamless deployment will depend on different factors. From the readiness of client teams to consensus layers and software code, everything will have to be perfect. Additionally, they all have to be tested on public testnets. This exercise will take plenty of time. Currently, the upgrade work is going through the \u201cdevnet phase\u201d.\n\nDuring the conclave, developers talked about a localized developer network called \u201cDevnet 9\u201d. The developers want to use this framework to assess the functionality of Dencun. The testing on Devnet 9 will probably happen next week before it goes to the public testnet phase. While the upgrade may get delayed, users would rather wait than use subpar functionalities."
