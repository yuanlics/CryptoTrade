        "title": "Ethereum Node and Client: A Complete Guide - crypto.news",
        "content": "Ethereum nodes and clients play a pivotal role in the ongoing transformation of the crypto landscape. Ethereum, a cryptocurrency that has captured the attention of enthusiasts for months, is poised to surpass Bitcoin as the industry\u2019s leading digital currency. Vitalik Buterin, the visionary creator of Ethereum, and the dedicated team of developers have been diligently working on a series of upgrades leading up to the eagerly anticipated main merge.\n\nEthereum nodes and clients form the backbone of this groundbreaking network. They are responsible for validating transactions, executing smart contracts, and ensuring the overall security and decentralization of the Ethereum ecosystem. In this article, we will delve deeper into the world of Ethereum nodes and clients, exploring their significance, functionality, and integral role in shaping the future of blockchain technology.\n\nThe Origin Story of Ethereum\n\nIn 2014, Vitalik Buterin published a white paper introducing Ethereum. The following year, 2015, saw the launch of the Ethereum platform by Buterin and Joe Lubin. Joe is also the founder of ConsenSys \u2013 a blockchain software company.\n\nEthereum has changed and improved a lot since it was first created, and all of these changes have led to one goal: making Ethereum the best crypto blockchain on the internet. Its operations are insanely good, and investors can trust that they are investing in a good project.\n\nIts ecosystem is made up of a variety of different specifications. Let\u2019s take a look at some of its finest features: Ethereum Nodes and Clients.\n\nThe Ethereum Ecosystem\n\nIn simple terms, Ethereum is a decentralized platform that runs smart contracts. Smart contracts are basically application code that is executed and verified by the network. Ethereum has become the go-to platform for DeFi (decentralized finance) and NFTs (non-fungible tokens).\n\nEthereum was created to be scalable, programmable, secure, and decentralized. It\u2019s the blockchain of choice for those who are creating technology on top of it. This blockchain is essential for these DeFi applications to develop and bring about a financial revolution.\n\nEthereum provides a highly flexible platform on which developers can create dApps using the native Solidity programming language and Ethereum Virtual Machine. The founders of Ethereum saw blockchain technology\u2019s potential for more than just creating a secure virtual payment method. Now, Ethereum is changing from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS).\n\nWhat Is an Ethereum node?\n\nA node on the Ethereum network is any computer that runs the software required to interact with it. Nodes communicate with one another to validate transactions and store data about the blockchain\u2019s state.\n\nDepending on your needs, whether a dApp or a wallet, any client can run three types of nodes: full, light, and archive. Each node will uniquely evaluate data and provide various synchronization methods. This refers to how quickly your node can get new information so that you can use it.\n\nFull Nodes: Full nodes are jam-packed with data. They keep and distribute all of the blockchain data from the Ethereum network. A full node will also participate in block validation.\n\nA full node can interact directly with any smart contract on a public blockchain. In addition, nodes can also deploy new smart contracts onto the same type of blockchain. However, running a full node may be costly in terms of hardware and bandwidth. Obtaining all of the data can be very time-consuming.\n\nLight Nodes: Light nodes are similar to full nodes. However, they handle significantly less information. The light node keeps track of the header chain. This is the most basic information in a block, such as a timestamp and the previous block\u2019s hash.\n\nLight nodes are blockchain clients that only request data as needed. They can verify the validity of data, but they don\u2019t participate in block validation. Remote clients often use light nodes.\n\nArchive Nodes: A archive node is a node that keeps all of the data that a full node does and creates an archive of past blockchain states. Even after a client has finished synchronizing, archive nodes will store historical data.\n\nOn the other hand, full and light nodes will \u201cprune\u201d the historical blockchain data. This means they can rebuild it but do not retain this information. Archive nodes may not be of much use to the average user. However, they\u2019ve been instrumental in creating block explorers, wallet providers, and chain analytics applications.\n\nWhat Are Clients in Ethereum?\n\nIn computing, a \u201cclient\u201d is software downloaded to your computer that helps you interact with another type of software or service provided by a server. An Ethereum client is a program that enables Ethereum nodes to read blocks on the Ethereum blockchain and smart contracts. You\u2019ll need to download an Ethereum client software to run a node.\n\nWith Ethereum, many different clients can be created using various programming languages. However, they all follow the same protocol and rules. This allows them to interact with each other on the Ethereum network.\n\nThe most popular functions of Ethereum clients include transaction and mining interfaces, but their applications extend far beyond basic blockchain operations. The Ethereum Foundation maintains the following Ethereum clients:\n\n\u00b7 Geth (Go)\n\n\u00b7 OpenEthereum (Rust)\n\n\u00b7 Nethermind (C#, .NET)\n\n\u00b7 Besu (Java)\n\n\u00b7 Erigon (Go/Multi)\n\nIf the Ethereum Foundation doesn\u2019t support your go-to programming language, don\u2019t worry\u2013numerous third-party Ethereum clients can provide you with the language support you need. There are 3 types of Ethereum clients.\n\nFull Client: Full clients enable any node on the network to complete all tasks, such as mining, transactions, validating block headers, and running smart contracts.\n\nFull clients enable any node on the network to complete all tasks, such as mining, transactions, validating block headers, and running smart contracts. Light Client: Light clients are a subset of client functionality. Because they do not keep the entire Ethereum blockchain, light clients can offer quicker speeds and free up data storage space over full clients.\n\nLight clients are a subset of client functionality. Because they do not keep the entire Ethereum blockchain, light clients can offer quicker speeds and free up data storage space over full clients. Remote Client: A remote client is a third kind of client that resembles a light client. The primary distinction is that a remote client does not keep its copy of the blockchain and does not validate transactions or block headers.\n\nRather than running a full client, remote clients simply connect to the Ethereum blockchain network via a light or full client. These clients are most often used as wallets for sending and receiving transactions.\n\nThe Difference Between Ethereum Nodes and Clients?\n\nAlthough nodes and clients are often used interchangeably, they serve different purposes in accessing the Ethereum network. It may help to think of nodes and clients like a computer accessing the internet: the node would be an operating system, such as Windows or iOS, while the client is the physical computer.\n\nYou can tap into the node operating system using a client computer. From there, you gain access to the internet\u2013regardless of which type of computer or operating system you use.\n\nBottom Line\n\nNodes and clients are frequently equated, although they are not the same thing. The Clients and Nodes play vital roles in keeping the Ethereum blockchain functioning correctly. In short, an Ethereum node and client depend on each other to keep the Ethereum network functioning."

        "title": "2 Cryptocurrencies That Could Dwarf Ethereum - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Ethereum (ETH -1.09%) remains the second-most valuable cryptocurrency in the world by market capitalization, trailing only Bitcoin (BTC -0.71%). Given Ethereum's dominant position in so many key areas of the blockchain world, it can be hard to imagine any other cryptocurrency ever surpassing it.\n\nBut for the past few years, a long line of rivals have attempted to do exactly that. Many of them have been described as \"Ethereum killers,\" due to their superior performance metrics and rapidly growing blockchain ecosystems. And two that particularly stand out right now are Cardano (ADA 4.66%) and Solana (SOL 8.56%). Let's take a closer look at how they might eventually surpass Ethereum over the long haul.\n\n1. Cardano\n\nWith a market cap of nearly $9 billion, Cardano ranks as the seventh-largest cryptocurrency in the world. That might sound impressive, but Ethereum has a market cap of almost $200 billion, so Cardano needs to increase in value by a multiple of 20 to 25 just to reach Ethereum's current size. To dwarf Ethereum, Cardano would likely need to 50x in value.\n\nThat's a big ask, so it's important that the founder of Cardano, Charles Hoskinson, also happens to be one of the co-founders of Ethereum. If there's anyone who knows how to out-Ethereum Ethereum, it's Hoskinson. He's been very vocal about the structural flaws of Ethereum in the past, arguing that Cardano has superior blockchain technology. This summer, he even suggested that Cardano would eventually surpass Ethereum and Bitcoin to become the top cryptocurrency in the world.\n\nFrom my perspective, it all starts with decentralized finance (DeFi). But in 2021, Cardano upgraded its blockchain to support the smart contracts required for DeFi, and it has continually made new improvements and upgrades since then. This year, for example, Cardano saw the launch of its first stablecoin, as well as a burst of new activity on decentralized exchanges. If Cardano's DeFi ecosystem continues to grow quickly, this could lead to rapid gains in valuation.\n\nMoreover, growth in emerging markets could send Cardano soaring. As Hoskinson outlined in a recent interview, Cardano is looking for blockchain partners across Africa, South America, Asia, and the Middle East. If Cardano becomes the most popular blockchain network in these regions, then it could have a massive impact on its future valuation.\n\n2. Solana\n\nSimilar in size to Cardano, Solana has a market cap of $8 billion. So it will need the same types of growth catalysts as Cardano to ever surpass Ethereum. In short, Solana needs a big, think-outside-the-box idea to drive 50-fold valuation gains.\n\nAnd that big idea might just be mobile crypto. Back in summer 2022, Solana first unveiled its strategic vision for mobile crypto, including a new flagship Android-based mobile device optimized for crypto and a software development kit to help developers around the world build for mobile crypto. It sounded like a lot of hype, but this spring, Solana finally launched its Saga crypto phone. The concept was simple but brilliant: Everything you do on your phone involving crypto should be simple and intuitive, and you should be able to bring crypto with you wherever you go.\n\nThe problem is that the collapse of FTX last year had disastrous implications for Solana, which had extensive links to former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried. All the fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) swirling around Solana since the FTX meltdown has taken a toll on the Solana ecosystem. Some high-profile NFT collections, for example, decided to migrate to other blockchains this year, and overall activity on the Solana ecosystem has just started to regain its previous footing. The good news is that Solana is up more than 100% for the year, so the worst may be behind it.\n\nWhat are the chances of overtaking Ethereum?\n\nFor either Cardano or Solana to ever overtake Ethereum, a lot has to go right. The fact that there have been so many purported \"Ethereum killers,\" and none of them have ever managed to unseat Ethereum tells you a lot. The bottom line is that it's very difficult to overtake a market leader with a first-mover advantage, especially within the tech sector.\n\nIf forced to choose between Cardano and Solana, I'd pick Solana. This is a crypto that is not just trying to out-Ethereum Ethereum, it's actually proposing a new approach to blockchain technology based around mobile. For me, that's an exciting concept and a big reason why I think Solana might just pull off what many people think is impossible."

        "title": "Ethereum's proto-danksharding to make rollups 10x cheaper \u2014 Consensys zkEVM Linea head - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Zero-knowledge (ZK) proof solutions have proved critical in helping scale the Ethereum ecosystem, but proto-danksharding is expected to drastically reduce the cost of rollups, according to Consensys\u2019 zkEVM Linea head Nicolas Liochon.\n\nSpeaking exclusively to Cointelegraph Magazine editor Andrew Fenton during Korea Blockchain Week, Liochon estimated that proto-danksharding could further reduce rollup costs by 10 times.\n\nProto-danksharding, also known by its Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) identifier EIP-4844, is aimed at reducing the cost of rollups, which typically batch transactions and data off-chain and submit computational proof to the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation has yet to nail down an expected launch date for proto-danksharding, but development and testing are still ongoing.\n\nAs Liochon explained, Linea delivers 15 times cheaper transactions compared to those made on Ethereum\u2019s layer 1, but rollups are still limited by the fact that transactions are posted in call data in Ethereum blocks.\n\nAccording to Ethereum\u2019s documentation, rollups are still expensive in terms of their potential because call data is processed by all Ethereum nodes and the data is stored on-chain indefinitely despite the fact that the data only needs to be available for a short period of time.\n\nEIP-4844 will introduce data blocks that can be sent and attached to blocks. The data stored in blocks is not accessible to the Ethereum Virtual Machine and will be deleted after a certain time period, which is touted to drastically reduce transaction costs.\n\n\u201cIn reality, the cost of rollups is down to data availability. We are writing all the data to layer 1, which is why we have exactly the same security. But it\u2019s expensive; it represents 95% of the cost.\u201d\n\nLiochon said that Linea\u2019s prover, which essentially handles the off-chain computation that verifies, bundles, and then creates a cryptographic proof of the combined transactions, only represents a fifth of the cost.\n\nThis highlights the major hurdle in making ZK-rollups the go-to scaling solution for the Ethereum ecosystem as opposed to other solutions like Optimistic Rollups.\n\nLiochon also said that Linea aims to be a general-purpose ZK-rollup that will be used for a variety of decentralized applications and solutions within the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\n\u201cWe are a generic rollup. We don\u2019t want to have a specific use case or specific domain. It\u2019s quite important to support all types of applications, including DeFi, gaming and social.\u201d\n\nAs Cointelegraph previously reported, Consensys completed the launch of Linea in August 2023, having onboarding over 150 partners and bridging more than $26 million in Ether (ETH).\n\nMagazine: Here\u2019s how Ethereum\u2019s ZK-rollups can become interoperable"

        "content": "In a recent keynote address at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore, Ethereum cofounder Vitalik Buterin offered a candid assessment of blockchain's key challenges and the strides made in addressing them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nButerin centered his speech on Ethereum's persistent challenges: privacy, consensus, smart contract security and scalability. These issues, he emphasized, have remained constant over the past six years.\n\nBack in 2017, Ethereum took a significant step toward enhancing privacy by introducing zero-knowledge proofs like zk-SNARKs. Fast forward to 2023, and Ethereum has made substantial progress in this domain. Advanced technologies like STARK, Zero-Knowledge rollups and Cairo are now part of the Ethereum landscape. Nevertheless, privacy remains a concern, mainly due to legal and acceptance issues surrounding tokens generated by privacy systems, as exemplified by the Tornado Cash case, concluded the developer.\n\nButerin introduced the concept of proof-of-innocence, a means to validate tokens within privacy systems without revealing transaction origins. This concept underscores the importance of privacy and ongoing efforts to optimize zk-SNARKs for seamless integration into mainstream finance.\n\nCentralization and hacks\n\nShifting to consensus security, Ethereum has fully embraced a consensus mechanism, but challenges endure. These include simplifying the protocol, addressing centralization concerns and streamlining participation, notably through proof of stake.\n\nIn the realm of smart contract security, notable efforts have been made since 2017. Fast forward to 2023, and Ethereum has made significant progress in this arena. Buterin noted that the frequency of hacking incidents has dramatically decreased since the notorious DAO hack. Improved security measures and heightened awareness within the Ethereum community have played a pivotal role in mitigating risk.\n\nIn summary, Vitalik Buterin's keynote address shed valuable light on Ethereum's journey over the years. While recognizing ongoing challenges, his speech was aimed at demonstrating Ethereum's focus on practical solutions, mainstream adoption and enhancing user benefits."

Discover SCENE\n\nIllustration by Mitchell Preffer for Decrypt.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) started the weekend with slightly higher prices than seven days ago.\n\nThe world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency currently trades for $25,815, which is an increase of about 0.6% over the week, while its closest runner-up grew 0.8% to change hands at $1,630.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMany other leading cryptocurrencies have also posted similar small gains. There are no substantial changes to the price of any of the top thirty cryptocurrencies by market capitalization from last weekend, except Stellar (XLM).\n\nXLM holders saw their stash grow 10% over the week, and the token now trades for $0.124846. The rally appears to have been caused by a tweet from the Stellar team, posted on Saturday, that says, \u201cSomething cool is dropping in 10 days.\u201d\n\nIn the news\u2026\n\nAfter the slow news cycles of the last fortnight, this week saw a return to the usual slew of adoption announcements, although any indication of political breakthroughs for crypto over in Washington was pretty thin on the ground.\n\nOn Monday, the London Stock Exchange Group announced that it is using blockchain technology to build an exchange offering tokenized versions of traditional financial assets. LSEG is currently in talks with multiple regulatory bodies about it, including the UK government and HM Treasury.\n\nThat day, European Central Bank executive board member Fabio Panetta took aim at stablecoins issued by private companies like PayPal, which launched its own dollar-pegged PayPal USD (PYUSD) last month.\n\nSpeaking at the European Parliament\u2019s Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs meeting on Monday, Panetta said his main criticism of PYUSD and similar coins is that \u201cprivate providers of payment services, including PayPal, have no incentive to limit the take-up of their stablecoins or the range of services they provide. Quite the opposite: their objective is to expand their customer base and gain market share.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOn the other hand, Panetta thinks the proposed European central bank digital currency (CBDC), the digital euro, \u201cwould pay due attention to orderly adjustments in the financial sector while offering payment service providers a platform for innovations with pan-euro area reach,\u201d he said.\n\nOn Tuesday, top-five South Korean financial conglomerate Hana Financial Group announced a partnership between its KEB Hana Bank and crypto custodian BitGo for late 2024.\n\nThe new deal ties a major domestic financial player to the crypto industry, although KEB Hana Bank has already taken steps into blockchain when it opened a digital branch in metaverse platform The Sandbox.\n\nCrypto-friendly payments giant Visa said on Tuesday that it has now expanded its settlement options to include USDC on the Solana blockchain. The company also announced that it was working with merchant acquirers Worldpay and Nuvei to allow them to settle using USDC instead of fiat.\n\nOn Wednesday, The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)\u2014recognized by the SEC as the designated accounting standard setter for public companies\u2014voted unanimously to change how companies disclose crypto holdings in order to give greater transparency to the trade. The new rules take effect in 2025.\n\nTwo global financial regulators, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the G20\u2019s risk watchdog, the Financial Stability Board (FSB), on Thursday released a white paper outlining their plans for coordinated action to ensure that there is a \u201ccomprehensive policy and regulatory response for crypto-assets [as it] is necessary to address the risks of crypto-assets to macroeconomic and financial stability.\u201d\n\nWhile the paper\u2019s authors acknowledge that crypto doesn\u2019t currently pose a risk to the financial system, they argue that widespread adoption would undermine the effectiveness of monetary policy.\n\nThe paper recommends constituencies \u201csafeguard monetary sovereignty and strengthen monetary policy frameworks, guard against excessive capital flow volatility and adopt unambiguous tax treatment of crypto-assets\u201d to protect themselves from risks.\n\nAD\n\nAD"

        "content": "S-1 and 19b-4 filings have been made for the spot Ethereum ETF approval.\n\nETH saw a mild reaction to the news of the filings.\n\nThe race to launch an Ethereum [ETH] ETF began on 6 September, with Ark Investment and 21 Shares filing applications. How does this type of ETF differ from futures-based ETH ETFs, and what potential impact could it have on the price and adoption of Ethereum (ETH)?\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ETHs worth today?\n\nCountdown begins for Ethereum spot ETF decision\n\nIn a recent filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on 6 September, asset management firms ARK Invest and 21Shares have submitted requests for regulatory approval to launch an exchange-traded fund (ETF), specifically designed to hold ETH.\n\nThis ETF marks the initial effort to introduce such a fund in the United States.\n\nAlso, as explained by James Seyffart on X (formerly Twitter), the initial filing made by Ark 21Shares was classified as an S-1 filing. This type of filing doesn\u2019t trigger an immediate countdown for SEC approval.\n\nTold you guys to expect some 19b-4's!! haha. Look for even more tomorrow and Friday. https://t.co/zlxzjzP7yP \u2014 James Seyffart (@JSeyff) September 6, 2023\n\nHowever, a subsequent document, categorized as a 19b-4 filing, was submitted by the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) on 6 September. In this 19b-4 filing, the CBOE formally requested that the ARK 21Shares and the VanEck Ethereum ETF investment products be listed on CBOE\u2019s BZX Exchange.\n\nJames Seyffart pointed out that the 19b-4 filings, in contrast to the earlier S-1 filings, signified that the SEC\u2019s decision-making process is now in motion. Also, it started the countdown for a final decision.\n\nHow does this differ from a futures Ethereum ETF?\n\nFutures-based Ethereum ETFs differ significantly from spot Ethereum ETFs. In futures-based ETFs, ETH itself is not held as an asset. Instead, these ETFs utilize derivative contracts, particularly futures contracts, as their underlying assets. As a result, the value of these ETFs is directly tied to the performance of ETH futures contracts and may not necessarily track the real-time spot price of ETH.\n\nMoreover, the liquidity of futures ETFs is contingent upon the liquidity of the ETH futures contracts they are based on. If the futures contracts themselves lack liquidity, it can impact the liquidity and trading of the ETF.\n\nConversely, spot Ethereum ETFs hold actual ETH as their underlying asset. This means that they closely follow the spot price of ETH, which is the current market price of Ethereum. Also, the liquidity of spot Ethereum ETFs is determined by ETH\u2019s availability and trading volume.\n\nHow these filings could impact Ethereum\n\nIntroducing an Ethereum ETF would simplify gaining exposure to ETH for a wider spectrum of investors. This enhanced accessibility has the potential to stimulate greater demand for Ethereum.\n\nMoreover, ETFs are renowned for their high liquidity, and establishing an Ethereum ETF could enhance liquidity in the Ethereum market. This increased liquidity can draw in more traders and investors, potentially resulting in elevated trading volumes.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s ETH\u2019s market cap in BTC\u2019s terms\n\nHow ETH reacted to the ETF news\n\nThe 4-hour timeframe chart of Ethereum displayed a modest price uptick on 6 September. By the close of trading, ETH was trading at approximately $1,632, showing a slight price increase on a daily timeframe.\n\nHowever, as of this writing, it had retraced some of these gains and was trading at around $1,630. This suggested that the recent ETF-related news had a minimal impact on its ongoing price trend. However, this could change once news of ETF approval emerges."

        "content": "The price of Ethereum seems to be back under the influence of the current market sentiment despite enjoying a relatively positive week. On Wednesday, September 6, Ark Invest filed for the first Ethereum spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States.\n\nThis ETF application had a tame impact on the price of Ether, with the cryptocurrency only climbing to $1,650 the following day. Moreover, the token has almost fully reversed the minor gains from the significant development.\n\nEthereum Price Registers 0.1% Rise Last Week \u2013 Here\u2019s Why\n\nEthereum currently changes hands at about $1,628, according to data from CoinGecko. A negligible 0.1% price increase in the last seven days underscores the struggling market performance of the second-largest cryptocurrency.\n\nA spot ETH exchange-traded fund is an investment vehicle that tracks the price of Ethereum on the spot market, allowing investors to buy and sell the crypto asset via a brokerage account. A product of this kind is expected to boost interest and investment in the Ether token.\n\nNevertheless, the price of ETH has remained relatively unmoved this week despite the optimistic news. A recent report by blockchain analytics firm IntoTheBlock has provided insight into why the news barely impacted the price of Ethereum.\n\n\u2018Supply & Demand Balance\u2019\n\nAccording to the data analytics platform, the current supply and demand balance is one of the primary reasons why the ETH price continues to move sideways. \u201cLarge holdings are concentrated close to ETH\u2019s current price, consolidating prices in a tight range,\u201d IntoTheBlock said.\n\nSource: IntoTheBlock\n\nIntoTheBlock data shows that a total of 5.1 million ETH was acquired below the $1,600 mark to create support, while a total of 6.5 million ETH was purchased at a price above this level to establish resistance. The blockchain analytics firm concluded that traders agree to transact within a narrow range with a large concentration of ETH positions.\n\n\u2018Automated Buying, Discretionary Selling\u2019\n\nAdditionally, IntoTheBlock believes that while bullish traders seemed to have bought the news, \u201cdiscretionary sellers\u201d overtook the narrative not too long after.\n\n\u201cA key factor behind the discretionary selling is likely to be FTX\u2019s upcoming liquidation of reportedly $3B in crypto holdings,\u201d the report read.\n\nWhile FTX has yet to disclose when it intends to execute these liquidations, it is likely that recent activity on the exchange\u2019s wallets alarmed the market.\n\nThis sentiment also seems to be reflected in the performance of SOL after global payment giant VISA disclosed that it will use the Solana network for payment settlements. While the value of SOL jumped by more than 5% to trade above $20 immediately after the announcement, the cryptocurrency is back trading beneath $19.5.\n\nWith the Ethereum and Solana tokens constituting a significant portion of FTX\u2019s holdings, it is likely that the slow market performance of these assets is driven by traders being cautious because of the impending liquidation.\n\nETH price continues to move sideways on the daily timeframe | Source: ETHUSDT chart on TradingView\n\nFeatured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "OnChainMonkey Embarks on a Bold Migration from Ethereum to Bitcoin, Citing Enhanced Security - NFT Culture",
        "content": "In an announcement that\u2019s shaking up the NFT space, OnChainMonkey NFT collection is making a daring transition. The collection is moving its comprehensive array of 10,000 NFTs from Ethereum to Bitcoin. As first reported by Cointelegraph, this massive transition is set to span several months and is a testament to the overwhelming trust the community has in Bitcoin\u2019s unparalleled security and decentralization mechanisms.\n\nDeciphering the Bold Move\n\nDanny Yang, CEO of Metagood, unveiled this impending transition on September 7th. He emphasized that their prime collection, OCM Genesis, will transition from Ethereum\u2019s realm to that of Bitcoin. Originally launched on Ethereum in September 2021, the OnChainMonkey collection is making this stride mainly because of the community\u2019s unanimous sentiment. They resoundingly believe in the security and decentralization features Bitcoin Ordinals offers over Ethereum.\n\nHighlighting this sentiment, Yang stated, \u201cThe Bitcoin Ordinal protocol distinctly outshines the Ethereum NFT protocol in areas of decentralization and security. This paves the way for high-caliber NFTs to truly shine on Bitcoin.\u201d A monumental 99% of OnChainMonkey tokenholders endorsed this shift, spotlighting their shared conviction in the benefits of Bitcoin.\n\nHowever, transitioning isn\u2019t a cakewalk. Metagood anticipates a sizable expenditure, which might exceed $1 million, to ensure this migration is hiccup-free.\n\nBitcoin Ordinals is a big deal. I\u2019ve been building on Bitcoin for over ten years, and Ordinals is the most significant development in recent years. Don\u2019t get distracted by the monkey JPEGs talk, and do learn why the Ordinals Protocol is important. \ud83d\udc47\ud83e\uddf5 \u2014 danny huuep (@huuep) June 20, 2023\n\nPreserving Legacy and Authenticity\n\nAmidst the intricacies of this process, every newly crafted OnChainMonkey on Bitcoin promises to have a clear lineage traced back to its Ethereum counterpart. To effectuate this, holders will be awarded the corresponding Bitcoin Ordinal once they\u2019ve decommissioned their Ethereum NFT.\n\nYang also revisited Metagood\u2019s prior ventures to showcase their proficiency in handling such tasks. He remarked, \u201cOur trailblazing endeavors include inscribing 10,000 images of a collection on Bitcoin, initiating a parent-child collection with OCM Dimensions 300, and pioneering recursive inscriptions on Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nYet, Ethereum continues to reign supreme in the NFT marketplace. As per CryptoSlam\u2019s recent data, Ethereum is leagues ahead with a whopping $236.8 million in NFT deals over the past month. Bitcoin, while making commendable strides, is currently placed sixth with $11.1 million.\n\nYang, however, is buoyant about Bitcoin\u2019s prospects. He envisions a vibrant Bitcoin-centric NFT ecosystem and believes that both Bitcoin and Ethereum have the potential to co-exist and prosper.\n\nOrdinals is an elegant protocol, and like Bitcoin, is both simple and powerful.\n\nSnapshot of the Present Market\n\nPresently, OnChainMonkey NFTs are traded at an average baseline price of 1.10 Ether (ETH). They\u2019ve accumulated an impressive transaction volume exceeding 20,550 ETH since debuting on the illustrious NFT marketplace, OpenSea, in September 2021. Notably, a hefty 31% of the 2,900 OnChainMonkey NFT aficionados are unique, as stated by OpenSea.\n\nThe transition was further facilitated by the inception of Ordinals and BRC-20 tokens at the beginning of this year, a development following the successful Taproot soft fork in November 2021.\n\nTL;DR: As first spotlighted by Cointelegraph, OnChainMonkey NFT collection is transitioning its entire assortment of 10,000 NFTs from Ethereum to Bitcoin. The community\u2019s faith in Bitcoin\u2019s security and decentralization features fuels this move."

The outlook leaves investors cautious and the circumspect could extend into the weekend, which is known for low trading volume.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin Weekly Forecast: BTC could revisit $21,000 as sell signals multiply ahead of US CPI.\n\nBitcoin price lacks directional bias, make-or-break support nearby\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price is moving west, consolidating within a narrow range after breaking below a crucial support level during the August 17 crash. With weekends known to be rather lulled, the odds of a move north are slim unless large holders act.\n\nThe $24,995 support level is a \u2018make-or-break\u2019 for Bitcoin price. A decisive break below would send BTC to the psychological $24,000 and mark a bearish shift in trend. In the dire case, seller momentum could see the king of crypto hit $21,915, levels last seen around mid-March.\n\nBoth the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator and the RSI recently gave buy signals. The RSI rose out of oversold territory at the end of August and the MACD line crossed above its signal line in negative territory at the same time. Despite these signals only reflecting a brief dead-cat bounce in price that quickly fell back at the start of September, there is still a possibility of a recovery evolving.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-day chart\n\nA resurgence by the bulls could provide such an impetus for Bitcoin price, fueling a recovery to the upside. Such a move could send BTC above the 200-, 50-, and eventually the 100-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $27,066, $27,414, and $27,763 levels before ultimately restoring above the support offered by the ascending trendline at $29,692.\n\nIn a highly ambitious case, Bitcoin price could foray into the zone above the psychological $30,000 before tagging $31,518. While the possibility for a northbound move remains bleak in the near term, it would constitute a 20% climb above current levels.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin all-time high in 2025?

The ascension could extend, possibly reaching the area where the 200- and 100-day EMAs appear to converge at $1,762 and $1,773, respectively.\n\nWith the right momentum, inspired by a strong move by Bitcoin, the price could see Ethereum price hit $1,841, an area last tested on August 15.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum whales accumulate ETH as researchers explore scaling beyond EIP-4844.\n\nRipple price breaks out from a bearish trend, decisive?\n\nRipple (XRP) price has broken out from a descending parallel channel after the exhaustion blow-off move lower on August 17. These are both bullish signs that the downtrend has finished. Further confirmation would be provided should the remittance token record a daily candlestick close above the 200-day EMA at $0.5233.\n\nXRP/USDT 1-day chart\n\nIf sidelined investors or late buyers come in, the increased buying momentum could see Ripple price tag, or in a highly bullish case, overcome the resistance presented by the confluence resistance area between the 100-day and 50-day EMAs at $0.5547 and $0.5580 levels respectively.\n\nOvercoming these hurdles could clear the way for Ripple price to reach the psychological $0.7000 level. This would indicate a 15% drop.\n\nFrom a bearish perspective, there is still a risk Ripple price could slip back below the upper boundary of the descending channel and potentially extend to the July 13 lows around $0.4600. This would represent an 8% fall. In a dire case, Ripple price could extend to the midline of the bearish technical formation at $0.4191.\n\nAlso Read: XRP price likely to slump as pro-XRP attorney Deaton analyzes the Howey memo and Hinman speech"

        "content": "Bitcoin was struggling to hold some gains on Friday. All eyes are set on India's G-20 presidency, where crypto regulations are likely to be discussed. Just banning cryptocurrency won't eliminate its risks, a joint policy roadmap published by global standard setters Thursday said.\n\n\n\nA joint policy paper on crypto published by the IMF and FSB warned jurisdictions against implementing blanket bans to mitigate risks associated with the sector, and recommended targeted restrictions and sound monetary policy instead. Targeted restrictions might come in handy for emerging economies in particular, it said.\n\n\n\nBitcoin posted smart gains on Friday as the largest crypto token rose more than 2 per cent to regain $26,300-levels. Its largest peer, Ethereum, also moved about a per cent up to hover around $1,650-mark. Price action in the altcoins remained on the positive lines with mild gains.\n\n\n\nBitcoin's value is currently trading around the $26,200 level. This positive price movement might be because of a paper that came out yesterday from the IMF and the G20\u2019s Financial Stability Board, said Edul Patel, CEO & Co-Founder at Mudrex.\n\n\n\n\"The paper said that banning all cryptocurrencies wouldn't work well in the long term and suggested using targeted restrictions and a comprehensive monetary strategy instead. Ethereum, on the other hand, is trading above the $1600 level,\" he said.\n\n\n\nBarring a few exceptions, all top crypto tokens were trading slightly higher on Friday. However, the gains were capped. Other than Bitcoin, Solana gained about 2 per cent. BNB, Polkadot and Litecoin added about a per cent each. Among the losers, Toncoin and Polygon shed about 2 per cent.\n\n\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market cap was trading significantly higher, rising to $1.05 trillion-mark, as it gained more than one per cent in the last 24 hours. However, the total trading volumes dropped as much as 7 per cent to $24.98 billion.\n\n\n\nThe crypto market has picked up for the second consecutive day. The fear and greed index also jumped 5 points since yesterday and is currently in the fear zone with a score of 46/100. Most of the top 10 cryptos by market capitalization are trading in the green, said Parth Chaturvedi, Investments Lead at CoinSwitch Ventures.\n\n\n\n\"The investor sentiment seems to have been slightly boosted after news about JPMorgan exploring a blockchain-based payment and settlement system,\" he added. \"The much-awaited synthesis paper that has been jointly prepared by FSB and IMF was published for the public yesterday, which underlines the importance of a global regulatory framework.\"\n\n\n\nImage: Crypto-chart-price\n\n\n\nTech View by Giottus Crypto Platform\n\nEthereum is currently attempting a rebound after failing to break the $1,675 resistance level.After recording short-term gains last month, the asset has declined 9.2% since mid-August.The price action has been registering short line candles in the daily chart, indicating that ETH will continue moving sideways in medium term.\n\n\n\nImage: Chart-ETH\n\n\n\nThe asset is currently trading below its 20-day moving average of $1,670 which acts as an immediate resistance level.Its RSI reading is currently at 40, slightly in oversold territory.If ETH is unable to break through the $1,700 barrier this week, the price may consolidate around $1,650 levels for a while.\n\n\n\nMajor Levels:\n\nSupport: $1,625,$1,585\n\nResistance: $1,670, $1,700, $1,735\n\n\n\n\n\n(Views and recommendations given in this section are the analysts' own and do not represent those of Business Today.

        "content": "Bitrock takes the lead among Ethereum sidechains and layer-2 networks with great features that significantly improve ETH scalability.\n\nEthereum is the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap and one of the world\u2019s most popular crypto assets. However, like a few other blockchains, the Ethereum network is plagued with its fair share of limitations that hamper its growth and adoption. Over the years, this problem has motivated developers and blockchain engineers to create solutions in the form of sidechains or layer-2 (L2) blockchains. Sidechains and L2 blockchains help to extend the capabilities of Layer-1 (L1) blockchains like Ethereum and improve scalability.\n\nThere are several L2 networks and sidechains that enhance L1 blockchains. One of the most effective sidechains for the ETH network is the Bitrock blockchain. In July 2023, Bitrock had a stealth launch that, unlike other options, had no private sale or presale. The sidechain is now a contender in the ETH space with the following advantages working in its favor:\n\nOriginality: The Bitrock blockchain is original. Unlike some other options that forked out of running blockchains, the Bitrock team created the network and built it piece by piece. This means that Bitrock can operate as it deems fit and offer unmatched efficiency without any limitations as may be present in forked networks.\n\nPoA: Instead of using proof-of-work (PoW) or proof-of-stake (PoS), Bitrock uses the proof-of-authority consensus algorithm, which enables authorized entities to validate transactions. Using PoA makes Bitrock faster, cheaper, more secure, and more scalable than other options.\n\nCheap Gas Fees and Fast Transactions: Bitrock is effective with scaling the Ethereum blockchain as it boasts a 2-second block time and up to 12,000 transactions per second. In addition, gas fees on Bitrock are meager, costing $0.00001 per transaction.\n\nAudit: Bitrock has completed a CTDSEC blockchain and contract audit. The team engaged CTDSec to audit its infrastructure and find security flaws in design and implementation. According to CTDSec, Bitrock passed all tests with no issues.\n\nKYC Verification: Bitrock\u2019s core team has gone through a know-your-customer (KYC) process with Assure DeFi, a high-level service that has worked with the US Attorney\u2019s Office, the FBI, and several other government entities and jurisdictions.\n\nSimple Tokenomics: Bitrock\u2019s tokenomics feature total supply equal to the token\u2019s circulating supply. There are no locked or vested tokens and no plans for dilution. Consequently, investors, stakeholders, and members of the Bitrock community can rest assured that what they see is what they get.\n\nService Expansion: Bitrock will continuously onboard new features to provide better offerings to users. As part of its roadmap, Rockswap, Bitrock\u2019s live official chain DEX, plans to support multiple chains. Upon implementation, users can use Rockswap to trade tokens on native chains like ETH but pay gas in native Bitrock instead. Rockswap has been very successful so far, moving its market cap to $1.6 million from $5,000 in only three minutes. Also, in its first 24 hours, Rockswap\u2019s volume hit $1.8 million.\n\nToken Builder: Bitrock created an in-house token builder that anyone can use to launch a token using a standard preloaded contract. Bitrock has made this process easy, as interested persons can use this tool without any technical or coding knowledge.\n\nAttractive Staking: Users can also enjoy impressive returns from staking on Bitrock. On the Ethereum side, stakers get a 30% annual percentage yield (APY), and 60% on its mainnet. More than 40% of the entire token supply is currently staked on both sides combined.\n\nIntegrations: For improved and flexible service offers, Bitrock has completed integrations with several tools and platforms, including Bitmart, Dextools, Dexview, Gechoterminal, Pinksale, Avedex, and Trustwallet. There are also integrations with Sphynx Labs and all of its dApp and ecosystem utilities, with Dexscreener and other wallet integrations launching soon.\n\nThe Bitrock sidechain has several existing impressive features and many more in the offing. The L2 network will compete favorably with other L2 ETH options, especially with its impressive security measures, transaction speed, transparency, and its already remarkable list of integrations."

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nPseudonymous cryptocurrency researcher Hildobby, data scientist at Dragonfly VC fund, demonstrates the most generous gas spenders on the Ethereum (ETH) network. Besides \"technical\" addresses associated with wallets controlled by largest CEXes, the operator of an MEV bot becomes the #1.\n\n$70 million for 1.26 million transactions: Meet largest gas spender on Ethereum (ETH)\n\nThe Ethereum (ETH) wallet associated with a maximal extractable value (MEV) bot dubbed Jared From Subway (jaredfromsubway.eth) spent almost 38,000 Ethers (ETH) on gas, or over $70 million in equivalent. The bot initiated 1.26 million on-chain transactions, as demonstrated on a Dune dashboard created by Dragonfly's Hildobby.\n\njaredfromsubway.eth has now spent 37k ETH ($70m) on gas, the most of any address on Ethereum \ud83e\udd2f\n\n\n\nsrc: https://t.co/Ftl9QzMJPr pic.twitter.com/TdAeRvvzjJ \u2014 hildobby (@hildobby_) September 8, 2023\n\nAs such, this bot becomes the largest Ethereum (ETH) wallet in terms of gas spending. To provide context, the second position is occupied by one of Binance-controlled wallets with over 7.73 million transactions. It spends on gas less than half of what Jared From Subway transferred to Ethereum (ETH) validators.\n\nIt should also be noted that the Ethereum (ETH) gas price inches closer to multi-month lows. The current gas price is 9.39 Gwei, which means that one Uniswap (UNI) exchange is charged with approximately a $4 fee, as per Etherscan.\n\nThe Ethereum (ETH) community is thrilled by such impressive statistics of an Ethereum MEV bot. Meanwhile, the net profit or PnL data for the account are yet to be calculated.\n\nAs covered by U.Today previously, MEV bots are responsible for the majority of trading activity on DEXes. For instance, 80% of Uniswap's (UNI) trading volume across all pairs is generated by AI-powered MEV bots.\n\nWhat is special about MEV bot by JaredFromSubway?\n\nMEV bots are automated mechanisms designed to frontrun pending trades in the Ethereum (ETH) mempool by corrupting validators with higher fees. Once the bot identifies a large transaction, it can manipulate the price of this or that asset and execute the deal with a more attractive price.\n\nThe first signs of activity from the jaredfromsubway.eth-backed bot were registered in February 2023. Experts say that its algorithms are more sophisticated: It managed to have its transactions included in over 60% of Ethereum (ETH) blocks. In April 2023, it was spending over $1.1 million on gas daily.\n\nThe net number of jaredfromsubway.eth victims might exceed hundreds of thousands of DEX traders.\n\nThe bot is named after Jared Scott Fogle, a spokesperson of the American fast food chain Subway. Fogle advertised the restaurants for 15 years before being arrested for child sex tourism and child pornography storage in 2015."

        "content": "The co-creator of Ethereum (ETH) is detailing a mechanism by which dishonest crypto users can be rooted out of crypto mixing protocols.\n\nIn a new paper, Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin and four additional authors detail how privacy pools can be useful in weeding out unscrupulous crypto traders.\n\nA privacy pool is a smart contract-based privacy project that lets users generate new ETH addresses not associated with their prior transactions.\n\nAs stated in the abstract of the paper,\n\n\u201cThe core idea of the proposal is to allow users to publish a zero-knowledge proof, demonstrating that their funds (do not) originate from (un)lawful sources without publicly revealing their entire transaction graph. This is achieved by proving membership in custom association sets that satisfy certain properties, required by regulation or social consensus.\u201d\n\nIn a lengthy thread, one of the co-authors of the paper, Ameen Soleimani of Privacy Pools, further explains how the protocol works and how it could help the issues experienced by users of sanctioned crypto mixer Tornado Cash, which was deemed a national security threat in 2022 and banned in the US.\n\n\u201cPrivacy Pools is an open source project attempting to fix the most important flaw in Tornado Cash: Tornado Cash users were not able to provably dissociate from illicit funds \u2013 except by revealing their entire transaction history \u2013 which only a few did\u2026\n\nWith Privacy Pools, users can publish zero-knowledge proofs that their withdrawal originated from an \u2018association set\u2019 that excludes known illicit deposits. In theory, this allows users to prove regulatory compliance and still maintain privacy while using public blockchains.\u201d\n\nSoleimani says he plans on meeting with US regulators, such as the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) and and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), to see how the pools can be used to help bolster national security and combat money laundering.\n\nThe paper concludes that privacy and regulation may be compatible despite generally being perceived as contradictory.\n\n\u201cFor instance, suppose users can demonstrate that their funds have no ties to deposits from known illicit sources, or prove that the funds are part of a specific set of deposits, without revealing any further information.\n\nSuch a setup can generate a separating equilibrium, where honest users are strongly incentivized to prove membership in a given, compliant association set, while still enjoying privacy within that set. Conversely, for dishonest users, it is impossible to provide such a proof.\u201d\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "On-chain data showed that ETH was undervalued at press time.\n\nEthereum\u2019s application in traditional sectors could drive up demand for ETH.\n\nPredicting how much one would make from investing in cryptocurrencies is a Herculean task. While some have been successful in the venture, the volatility of the market, macroeconomic factors, and sometimes manipulation have put some experts out of business.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-2024\n\nFor Ethereum [ETH], it has been a long ride since 2014. Those who got in early and held for some years surely have their stars to thank for betting on the altcoin. According to CoinMarketCap, ETH\u2019s all-time performance was a staggering 58,014% increase.\n\nCloser to the green than red\n\nBut after almost hitting $5,000 in 2021, the altcoin was back below $2,000. Now, it has a 66.47% drawdown from its All-Time High (ATH). Despite the decline, many market players believe that ETH is a cryptocurrency to keep an eye on for the future.\n\nThis is because several opinions have tried to explain how undervalued the altcoin was.\n\nHowever, being undervalued can be subjective. For some, you only have to consider historical data. For others, one needs to be on the lookout for major development. In Ethereum\u2019s case, it seems like a combination of all.\n\nSo, this article will aim to assess if ETH could be profitable using on-chain data, and development that impact the altcoin price.\n\nA look at the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Z-Score seems like a great metric to begin with. The MVRV Z-Score compares the market value to realized value to evaluate whether an asset is overvalued or undervalued relative to its \u201cfair value.\u201d\n\nTypically, a significantly higher market value than the realized value signals a market top (red area). Conversely, a significantly lower market value than the realized value has often indicated market bottoms (green area).\n\nAccording to Glassnode, ETH\u2019s MVRV Z-Score was 0.36. This value was very close to the green zone and far away from the red region. A simple interpretation of this state meant that ETH was undervalued at press time.\n\nDemand to push up the price?\n\nInterestingly, this was also the conclusion Fidelity Investments made in its 30 August research. Titled \u201cEthereum Investment Thesis,\u201d the financial planning firm provided an in-depth evaluation of the Ethereum blockchain. It also assessed the blockchain\u2019s connection with its token ETH.\n\nFidelity admitted that Ethereum\u2019s fee volatility was a stumbling block to its adoption and may not supersede Bitcoin [BTC] as a monetary tool. However, the report did not fail to mention that ETH\u2019s potential as a yield-generating asset should not be questioned, noting that Ethereum\u2019s smart contract feature could help increase its demand in the long term.\n\nFidelity explained,\n\n\u201cMainstream applications being used on top of Ethereum would, by default, lead to demand for ether, which is why this longer-term trend could be one of the most compelling cases for ether as an aspiring alternative money.\u201d\n\nThe firm also used the ability to purchase treasuries, bonds, and money market funds on the Ethereum blockchain as reasons why ETH\u2019s demand could surge in the future. As a store of value, Fidelity noted that ETH\u2019s issuance reduction has made it a scarce asset, and one to significantly increase.\n\nFurthermore, the report considered the stock-to-flow ratio and compared it with Bitcoin. The stock-to-flow ratio compares the existing amount of a cryptocurrency to the flow of a new amount mined within a specific year.\n\nAs of July, Ethereum\u2019s stock-to-flow ratio was higher than Bitcoin\u2019s. This means that ETH could prove to be a better store of value than the king coin going forward.\n\nETH: Hit $2,000 first, then go parabolic\n\nFor ETH\u2019s short-term projection, AMBCrypto spoke with Gracy Chen, Managing Director at Bitget. Chen agreed that ETH has a higher value proposition than BTC in the long term.\n\nShe admitted that Bitcoin\u2019s current dominance in the market makes ETH weak, but also mentioned some positives around staking liquidity flow and deflation. As for ETH\u2019s potential price in September,\n\nChen said,\n\n\u201cIf BTC successfully breaks through $29,000, it\u2019s anticipated that a surge in altcoin market activity will occur, and ETH might attempt to surpass its previous resistance level of around $2,141.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Fidelity also considered Ethereum\u2019s burn mechanism\u2019s connection to the ETH value. Using the Shanghai/Capella upgrade as a reference, the firm noted that ETH\u2019s unstable supply could prove to be an obstacle. And at the same time, it could be an advantage.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ETHs worth today?\n\nAs a pro, the report noted that the narrative around ETH being an ultrasound money could pick up steam, improve the demand, and in turn the price. But this would require the supply to be consistent, like other assets acting as a store of value.\n\nApart from these mentioned above, Fidelity concluded Ethereum\u2019s role in various protocol upgrades and scaling solutions also gives it an edge to yield good gains in the future. However, market participants would need to watch out for consistency in this regard."

        "title": "Ether Whales\u2019 Offloading Sparks Concerns of Asset\u2019s Price Trajectory - ZyCrypto",
        "content": "Advertisement\n\nEthereum continued to trade in the volatile waters of the cryptocurrency market last week, with a deeper analysis revealing that some big players may be offloading their bags.\n\nFor most of last month, the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization traded around $1,600, reflecting weeklong fluctuations after a sudden drop earlier this month that left investors and analysts questioning its immediate trajectory.\n\nNotably, the actions of Ethereum whales or entities that possess substantial quantities of the cryptocurrency have prompted both intrigue and apprehension within the crypto community.\n\nOver the weekend, renowned crypto analyst Ali Martinez took to Twitter to share his insights. In a tweet, he highlighted a compelling correlation between the number of whales holding 10,000 or more ETH and the overall price movement of the asset.\n\n\u201cNotice the strong correlation between the number of whales holding 10,000+ ETH and its price trajectory. If seasoned investors are offloading, it prompts the question: Is now the right time to buy or to short ETH?\u201d wrote Martinez.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMartinez\u2019s observation underlines these significant holders\u2019 influence over Ethereum\u2019s market dynamics. Martinez went on to make a compelling remark, saying, \u201cI\u2019ll be watching these whales closely before I buy ETH!\u201d\n\nThe decision of established investors to liquidate portions of their holdings raises concerns about a potential downward trajectory. Yet, it also opens doors for those seeking strategic entry points into the market.\n\nNotably, the analyst\u2019s sentiments appear to have influenced his trading strategy. In a separate tweet, Martinez revealed another noteworthy metric in the cryptocurrency realm: the Ethereum MVRV Ratio.\n\nCompared to the 180-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), this ratio offers insights into broader market trends. The MVRV Ratio surpassing the 180-day SMA historically indicates macro uptrends, while a ratio below suggests potential downtrends. Martinez shared an image showing the recent decline in ETH\u2019s price led to the MVRV Ratio dipping beneath the 180-day SMA, raising caution flags for bullish investors.\n\nThat said, Ethereum\u2019s ongoing battle to breach the $1,700 resistance has intensified the focus on the critical $1,630 support level. Should this level be breached, the price could plunge toward approximately $1,440, a threshold aligned with a significant daily support trend line.\n\nConversely, a successful close above the $1,700 mark could propel Ethereum\u2019s value beyond the $2,000 milestone. On the other hand, Ethereum\u2019s price continues to perch above the ascending 200-week moving average, while a bottoming-out of the daily RSI introduces a hidden bullish divergence, albeit with prudent caution."

Today, his investment portfolio includes close to $135,000 in retirement and brokerage accounts, as well as ownership of two houses.\n\nHowever, Nguonly reveals that his journey to financial success was not without a significant misstep.\n\nNguonly in an interview with CNBC disclosed that between November 2021 and June 2022, he faced losses of approximately $80,000 due to his involvement in margin investing with cryptocurrencies. This figure encompassed $30,000 of his original investment capital and an estimated $50,000 in unrealized gains.\n\nEthan Nguonly, a 22-year-old software engineer, began investing in the stock market with the guidance of his parents before he even reached his teenage years.

By leveraging borrowed money, investors can potentially amplify their returns if their investments perform well. However, it\u2019s important to note that margin investing also increases the risk of losses, as any downturn in the market can magnify the impact on the borrowed funds\n\nDespite already having invested around $40,000 in prominent cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) and Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH), alongside a few hundred dollars in altcoins like Shiba Inu (CRYPTO: SHIB) and Dogecoin (CRYPTO: DOGE), he decided to venture further.

        "title": "Can Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Ethereum (ETH) Bulls Triumph? Everlodge (ELDG) Price Soars by 60% - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "The cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility and ever-shifting dynamics, and recent developments have stirred up excitement for both Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Ethereum (ETH) investors. However, amidst the frenzy, Everlodge (ELDG) has quietly emerged as a dark horse, experiencing a significant price surge.\n\nJoin the Everlodge presale and win a luxury holiday to the Maldives\n\nShiba Inu (SHIB): A Familiar Rally\n\nShiba Inu (SHIB), referred to as the \u201cDogecoin killer,\u201d has a history of making headlines with its sudden price rallies. Recently, it experienced a surge in value driven by renewed interest and positive sentiment within the Shiba Inu community.\n\nThe anticipated Shibarium relaunch, which promised more utility for the Shiba Inu coin, was the leading cause for this rally. Furthermore, Lucie, the Shiba Inu marketing officer, drew attention to the deflationary aspect of SHIB. But Lucie warns that this does not guarantee that the Shiba Inu price will rise.\n\nDespite this, experts remain bullish for Shiba Inu as they forecast a surge to $0.00001078 by the end of 2023.\n\nEthereum (ETH): The Pioneer\u2019s Momentum\n\nEthereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has witnessed renewed momentum. In recent Ethereum news, several of its liquid staking providers have voluntarily imposed self-limit rules. Thus pledging not to accumulate more than 22% of the Ethereum staking market.\n\nThis initiative clearly demonstrates the Ethereum community\u2019s dedication to maintaining a decentralized network. As a result, this movement aligns with the core ethos of cryptocurrency \u2013 decentralization.\n\nEthereum\u2019s adaptability and commitment to its core principles make it an attractive choice in the crypto landscape for long-term investors. Due to all these reasons, many analysts in the field predict that the Ethereum price could sit between $2,048.41 and $2,335.71 within Q4 of 2023.\n\nEverlodge (ELDG): The Surprising Contender\n\nAmidst the buzz surrounding Shiba Inu and Ethereum, Everlodge (ELDG) has silently surged by an impressive 60%. Everlodge\u2019s unique approach to real estate investments has caught the attention of traders seeking alternatives in this market.\n\nThis groundbreaking platform aims to revolutionize the real estate industry by removing persistent issues. For instance, Investing in real estate often means being confined to one\u2019s geographical location. Everlodge opens the door to global real estate opportunities by digitizing and minting high-end properties into NFTs from regions worldwide.\n\nMoreover, Everlodge then fractionalizes these NFTs. As a result, even small-scale investors can become fractional owners of vacation homes for prices as low as $100. Once the property value increases, the NFT price will also rise \u2013 providing you with passive income.\n\nAt the core of this platform lies the ELDG native token, now in Stage 2 of its presale. It has already pumped from its starting price of $0.01 and is worth only $0.016. Those looking to obtain staking rewards, access to free nightly property stays, and more are now flooding the presale. In fact, demand is so high that experts foresee a $0.035 price before its launch.\n\nFind out more about the Everlodge (ELDG) Presale\n\nWebsite: https://www.everlodge.io/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/everlodge\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Is Solana EVM Compatible and What Does It Actually Mean? - AMBCrypto Blog",
        "content": "Solana (SOL), a rapidly growing blockchain platform, has been turning heads in the crypto industry because of its remarkable scalability and transaction speed. However, one aspect that has grabbed particular attention is Solana\u2019s compatibility with Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). If you also want to know whether Solana is EVM compatible, then keep reading.\n\nThis exhaustive piece explores what Solana EVM compatibility means, its advantages, and practical applications.\n\nUnderstanding EVM\n\nThe EVM is the runtime environment for executing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. It is a decentralized computer featuring a sandboxed environment, meaning that it operates independently of the host computer system.\n\nThe EVM allows for the deployment and execution of arbitrary algorithms in a series of opcodes. Moreover, it provides the backbone for the decentralized apps (dApps) that are the hallmark of the Ethereum network.\n\nIn simpler terms, the EVM serves as a large, global, decentralized computer. Each smart contract is like a \u201cprogram\u201d that runs on this computer. Every Ethereum node runs its own EVM instance. This ensures that all computations are performed consistently. Consequently, the state of the blockchain remains synchronized across all nodes.\n\nWhy would you only learn about blockchains when you could be building one? Get started today.\n\nSolana and EVM: A compatible match\n\nThe Solana EVM serves as a bridge, letting dApps and transactions designed for the Ethereum network run seamlessly on the Solana blockchain as well. This compatibility layer means that Ethereum developers can transition their dApps to Solana without modifying any code.\n\nBuilt on the high-speed Solana blockchain, which can handle as many as 65,000 transactions per second, the Solana EVM offers far greater speed and scalability compared to Ethereum\u2019s 15 transactions per second.\n\nWhy is Solana\u2019s user activity plunging lower? Find out today.\n\nEVM compatibility: A game changer for Solana\n\nEVM compatibility is a significant breakthrough for Solana. This interoperability is a much-needed step towards addressing one of the biggest challenges that the crypto industry faces today.\n\nEVM compatibility brings about time savings, reduces knowledge transfer costs, and cuts back on development requirements. It attracts users, talent, and innovation from the Ethereum ecosystem to other blockchain platforms.\n\nThe boons of Solana EVM\n\nSolana EVM offers various benefits, including:\n\nEfficient scaling: Thanks to the Solana network, Web 3 developers can enjoy low gas fees and high throughput. This is due to its parallel processing (Sealevel) and unique innovations like Proof-of-History. The mechanism enables 400ms block times.\n\nIntegration with Solana ecosystem: Ethereum developers and creators have the opportunity to leverage Solana\u2019s robust ecosystem. This includes its developer community, decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, and non-fungible token (NFT) marketplaces. They can either migrate to or expand their applications with the use of Solana EVM.\n\nUsing familiar tools: EVM developers can continue using tools that they are already comfortable with. These include tools like MetaMask, Truffle, and Waffle, ensuring a seamless developer experience.\n\nAdapting smart contracts easily: Existing Ethereum dApps can be ported over to Solana Programs (i.e., Solana smart contracts) without any reconfiguration of the underlying smart contracts.\n\nDemocratizing access: Lastly, by using a Solana EVM, the users, talent, and innovation of the Ethereum ecosystem can easily adapt to projects on both blockchains.\n\nThe force behind Solana EVM\n\nNeon Labs is the company that developed the first EVM on Solana. The Neon EVM is a cross-chain solution that allows dApp developers to leverage the benefits of Solana to expand their services, offering new products like arbitrage or high-frequency trading, growing their user base, and reducing costs where possible, including gas fees.\n\nIts ERC-20/SPL wrapper is an implementation of the ERC-20 interface for SPL tokens that ensures Solana applications interact with Neon EVM contracts.\n\nGetting started with Neon EVM\n\nTo kickstart your journey with Neon EVM, the fastest route is to set up MetaMask and link it to the NeonEVM devnet either via Chainlist or by manual configuration. Developers eager to delve deeper can consult the Neon EVM documentation for further insights, and they can acquire test NEON tokens by utilizing either the NeonFaucet website or its API.\n\nThe future of blockchain with Solana EVM\n\nThe emphasis on EVM compatibility is poised to catalyze a new wave of multi-chain applications, strengthen network collaboration, and elevate the user experience as the focus shifts toward more scalable solutions. As the landscape evolves, the union of Solana and Ethereum ecosystems via EVM compatibility offers an intriguing glimpse into the future of blockchain tech. For developers keen on harnessing Solana\u2019s capabilities, the timing couldn\u2019t be better to delve into this cutting-edge platform and discover its vast potential.\n\nConclusion\n\nTo sum it up, Solana being EVM compatible signifies a significant leap in the blockchain ecosystem. It brings together the robustness of Ethereum with the efficiency of Solana.\n\nAs the crypto industry strives to resolve its scalability and interoperability issues, the advent of Solana EVM might just be the solution it needs. The future of blockchain technology looks promising with such innovative approaches. Lastly, it\u2019s exciting to see what\u2019s next on the horizon."

        "title": "Ethereum And Cosmos Compatible With A City, South Korea Wants To Make It Happen - Bitcoinist",
        "content": "A local report confirmed that Busan, the second most populous city in South Korea, plans to use the Ethereum and Cosmos for its project \u201cBlockchain City.\u201d The Asian city has been developing its blockchain capabilities for a while and plans to double down on its efforts.\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s Blockchain City To Operate On Ethereum And Cosmos\n\nThe report claims the project is expected to be completed by 2026 as part of the Busan Digital Asset Exchange (BDAE) and Future Schedule Plan. The South Korean city has been experimenting with different implementations of blockchain technology.\n\nBusan is looking for ways to offer services, such as digital vouchers and others, and for ways businesses can operate on the blockchain. However, the experiments hit an obstacle due to the difference between the networks and \u201cuncomfortable user experience (UX).\u201d\n\nAs crypto users know, operating on Ethereum and its many sidechains differs greatly from applications running on Cosmos, Cardano, Tezos, Solana, and other networks. These blockchains have transaction costs and speed and require tools many are unwilling to master.\n\nTherefore, Busan decided to concentrate on Ethereum and Cosmos to standardize its blockchain initiatives. Implementing this \u201cBlockchain City\u201d will cost around 100 billion Korean won or $74 million US dollars. The project will operate around the BDAE.\n\nBusan City\u2019s Efforts To Contribute With Blockchain Technology\n\nAccording to the report, the BDAE was launched in November 2022 but is yet to roll out operations. The company will disclose its business plans in an upcoming event this November.\n\nThe trading venues will provide users access to commodities, raw materials, and other assets via tokenized products. In the long term, the BDAE plans also to offer access to other assets, including tokenized global intellectual property (IP) rights.\n\nTokenized assets and related financial products have been gaining attention from different sectors. Banks, exchanges, and financial service providers have noted the potential benefits of implementing these products.\n\nIn a paper published on September 8, the US Federal Reserve (Fed) stated the following regarding the potential benefits of tokenization:\n\nthe programmability of crypto tokens and the ability to leverage smart contracts, allows for additional features that can be embedded into the tokenized asset which might also benefit markets for the underlying reference assets. For example, liquidity saving mechanisms could be implemented in the settlement of the tokenized asset even if they are not implementable for its real-world counterpart.26 These attributes might lower barriers to entry for a wider set of investors, resulting in more competitive and liquid markets, and better price discovery.\n\nIn addition to the \u201cBlockchain City\u201d and the BDAE, Busan will launch a blockchain innovation fund. The initiative will support the development of blockchain technology and related infrastructure.\n\nAs of this writing, Ethereum (ETH) trades at around $1,600 and faces considerable selling pressure on short timeframes.\n\nCover image from Unsplash, chart from Tradingview"

        "title": "How Bitcoin Spark Emerges as a Stronger Mining Alternative to Ethereum - Crypto News Flash",
        "content": "There\u2019s been a need for careful governance and design considerations in the quest for a scalable and sustainable blockchain infrastructure. And Bitcoin Spark has emerged as a stronger alternative to Ethereum in this respect.\n\nHow to stake Ethereum\n\nEthereum staking came as a result of Ethereum\u2019s move from a Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) through what was known as The Merge. This transition was aimed at addressing the scalability issues that PoW systems face. In a PoS system, validators are chosen to create new blocks and validate transactions based on the number of coins they hold and are willing to stake as collateral rather than by solving complex mathematical puzzles, as in PoW. To stake Ethereum, you need to have a minimum amount of 32 ETH and run a compatible staking node. You can also opt to use a staking service provided by various platforms.\n\nThe move to PoS did address some of the scalability issues related to PoW, such as the energy and time used for block confirmation. However, there are still concerns with this system since small holders may need help to compete with those with significant amounts of ETH, leading to a concentration of power and influence in the hands of a few individuals, compromising on decentralization.\n\nWhat is Bitcoin Spark?\n\nBitcoin Spark is a new Bitcoin fork that aims to solve its predecessor\u2019s limitations while carving out a distinct path for itself.\n\nThe Bitcoin Spark network offers faster and more cost-efficient transactions than traditional blockchain networks. It also offers a more scalable platform for building smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps) through its multiple-layered design.\n\nBitcoin Spark is currently in its Initial Coin Offering (ICO) stage, offering investors a chance to get BTCS before the network\u2019s official launch. The project\u2019s team has allocated 19.05% of its maximum supply of 21 million to the ICO. BTCS will launch at $10 but is currently selling BTCS at $2.25, accompanied by a 10% bonus in Phase 4 of the ICO.\n\nHow to mine Bitcoin Spark\n\nThe Bitcoin Spark network introduces a novel consensus mechanism known as Proof-of-Process (PoP). The PoP combines elements of Proof-of-Stake and Proof-of-Work, requiring miners/validators to provide a stake and processing power to the network in order for them to confirm blocks and earn rewards. Bitcoin Spark combines the PoP with an algorithm that exponentially reduces rewards per additional stake and processing power to ensure rewards can be distributed more fairly between smaller and larger network participants. This, combined with a massive number of network nodes, allows Bitcoin Spark to have a greater number of miners/validators.\n\nThe Bitcoin Spark development team will launch the Bitcoin Spark application before making the network\u2019s repository public for developers to create their own mining software. To mine BTCS, you will need to install the application and grant it access to your device\u2019s processing unit. The app will be lightweight and compatible with Windows, Android, iOS, Linux, and Mac OS. Once granted access, the application will create a virtual environment separate from the device\u2019s operating system functions to ensure security. Miners will be able to choose the number of device resources permitted for mining use, although the app itself can automatically adjust itself to the resources it can use on the device to account for overheating, battery life, and simultaneous usage requirements.\n\nThe miners/validators\u2019 contributed power will be rented to organizations and individuals requiring significant amounts of remote computational power. Those using this service will be required to pay with BTCS, providing a unique real-world application for the Bitcoin Spark ecosystem. Unlike PoW and PoS systems, Bitcoin Spark miners/validators will be rewarded with newly minted BTCS coins, transaction fees, and income from renting out their processing power.\n\nBitcoin Spark\u2019s approach greatly reduces the power and work required for mining. This promotes true decentralization by opening up the validation process to many more individual miners while increasing the blockchain\u2019s security.\n\nConclusion\n\nBitcoin Spark\u2019s focus on energy efficiency, scalability, sustainability, and inclusivity in its validation process positions it as a better alternative.\n\nFor more on Bitcoin Spark:\n\nWebsite: https://bitcoinspark.org/\n\nBuy BTCS: https://network.bitcoinspark.org/register"
