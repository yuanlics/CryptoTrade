        "content": "This constant stream of new staking participants \u2014 the current number of validators sits at about 800,000 \u2014 has been so substantial that it has even led some to propose a hard cap on the number of new validators that can enter the pool on any given day. The rationale being that the current \u201cchurn\u201d limit of 12 new validators per epoch, (which equates to 2,700 validators, 86,400 ETH, or roughly $138,000,000 per day), is unsustainable long term. A queue controls how many can join at any given time and the capacity of that queue increases as the network grows*, which could eventually stress the functionality of the network."

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nDespite uncertainty and a YoY decline, Ethereum has generated $10Bn in income in seven years.\n\nIt surpassed software giants such as Microsoft and Facebook.\n\nAs per sources, Ethereum\u2019s network revenue could grow to $51Bn per year by 2030 from the current $2.6Bn.\n\nSince its inception in 2015, Vitalik Buterin\u2019s cryptocurrency, Ethereum, has amassed $10 billion in income, beating Facebook and Microsoft in terms of growth rate.\n\nIn practice, whereas Ethereum would have taken 7.5 years to reach the $10 billion revenue milestone, Facebook (now Meta) appears to have taken somewhat longer and Microsoft a full 19 years.\n\nAs Crypto Portfolio Manager at cryptocurrency brokerage firm Caleb & Brown points out , such a result suggests that crypto protocols, like software, may be the next to become worldwide.\n\nFactors Influencing Ethereum\u2019s Earnings\n\nEthereum\u2019s popularity is driven by its versatility. Unlike Bitcoin, which primarily serves as a secure transactional network, Ethereum distinguishes itself by enabling the deployment of complex protocols across diverse industries. This adaptability makes Ethereum a preferred platform for applications in finance, gaming, art, and more.\n\nAs of September 26, Ethereum\u2019s native cryptocurrency, ETH was trading at approximately $1,625, with the Ethereum network boasting a market capitalization exceeding $195 billion.\n\nEthereum primarily generates revenue through transaction fees, denominated in gas. The cost of these fees varies depending on the complexity of the transaction.\n\nBasic transfers have lower fees, while smart contract-based transactions, which ensure trustless execution, are usually more expensive. Transaction costs increase with the complexity of network transactions.\n\nEthereum\u2019s transaction fee revenue goes to validators, who secure the network and confirm transactions. They earn block rewards and transaction fees for their role, incentivizing them to maintain network integrity and smooth operations.\n\nPositive ETH Price Outlook\n\nPositive predictions on the price of Ethereum (ETH) appear to be prevalent in September 2023.\n\nThese projections are based on ETH\u2019s past performance in comparison to BTC and its four-year halving cycle.\n\nIn reality, it appears that ETH has outperformed BTC during bull markets, but during bear markets, ETH looks to suffer more than BTC.\n\nAt the time of writing, the price of ETH had increased by more than 15% over the previous year. In fact, ETH is currently valued $1.627 . However, by mid-April 2023, ETH had reached an annual price high of more than $2,000.\n\nA $51 Billion Revenue Projection by 2030\n\nIn conclusion, the projected revenue potential of reaching $51 billion by 2030 not only underscores the untapped opportunities within the Ethereum network but also signifies the promising growth prospects that decentralized platforms may experience in the years ahead.\n\nDespite market uncertainties, Ethereum\u2019s versatility and applications position it for sustained growth, showcasing blockchain\u2019s transformative potential across industries"

        "content": "Concerns about increased centralization on the Ethereum network have intensified, following Blocknative\u2019s decision to discontinue its MEV-boost relay on Tuesday.\n\nRelayers play a pivotal role in settling transactions on Ethereum. They ensure timely and efficient processing, bridging the gap between users and the blockchain by batching and broadcasting transactions. With the exit of Blocknative, the relayer landscape is becoming increasingly concentrated. At time of writing, only four relayers remain active on the network.\n\nFollowing Ethereum\u2019s transition to proof-of-stake, the roles of block proposing and block building became distinct processes. MEV-boost software was developed to facilitate an efficient market between these proposers, which submit transaction bundles to validators, and builders, which organize the transactions in a specific order.\n\nFollowing the Merge, a group of well-resourced Ethereum block builders, formerly including Blocknative, began running their own relays.\n\nToday, nearly all Ethereum transactions use MEV-boost relays. 93% of Ethereum blocks created in the past 14 days made use of MEV-boost, according to data compiled on mevboost.pics. At the time that data was compiled, five entities were responsible for relaying 98% of the MEV-boosted transactions, per relayscan.io.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nAccording to Blocknative, it dropped its MEV-boost relay because continuing was no longer economically viable. The four remaining relayers collect no fees for their services, making this core piece of Ethereum infrastructure unprofitable for its operators. A recent Flashbots community proposal aims to start a \u201cPBS Guild\u201d which would solicit Ethereum community donations in part to reward relayers.\n\nUri Klarman, CEO of relaying entity Bloxroute, believes that a relayer fee mechanism should be activated, however. He suggests that block validators anticipate this move.\n\n\u201cI heard from multiple validators, like, \u2018yeah, we don\u2019t understand how you [haven\u2019t charged] us until this point,\u2019\u201d Klarman told Blockworks.\n\nKlarman said relayer fees would require some level of consensus between the remaining relaying entities and, ideally, the Ethereum community. If the economic incentive problem isn\u2019t fixed, though, Klarman thinks the perceived centralization of MEV-boost relays could grow worse.\n\n\u201cIn a year, if everything stays the same [\u2026] I think it\u2019s very reasonable that there will be [fewer] relays than there are today,\u201d Klarman said.\n\nElias Simos, the CEO of Ethereum data platform Rated, told Blockworks he is ambivalent toward a future where Ethereum continues to rely on its four major relayers.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re demonstrably long-term actors in the space, so they have a lot to lose [if Ethereum is harmed],\u201d Simos said. \u201cBut at the same time, is that enough?\u201d\n\nUpdated Sept. 28, 2023 at 10:22 am ET: Updated to clarify that Ethereum transactions are now handled by four relayers.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "Ethereum OFAC compliance dips to 45% post-Merge upgrade - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The historic Merge upgrade from Sept. 2022 \u2014 which marked Ethereum\u2019s transition from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS) \u2014 resulted in the overall decline in compliance with standards laid down by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC).\n\nEthereum blocks adhering to OFAC compliance censor certain transactions, which has a negative impact on the neutrality of the Ethereum ecosystem. In early August 2022, OFAC sanctioned Tornado Cash and several Ether (ETH) addresses associated with it due to its ability to mask and anonymize transactions.\n\nBefore the Merge upgrade, Ethereum\u2019s OFAC compliance increased exponentially as entities such as crypto exchanges opted to run censoring MEV-Boost relays on their validators. The list of top censorship offenders is populated by popular platforms such as Binance, Celsius Network, Bitfinex, Ledger Live, Huobi (HTX) and Coinbase, according to MEV Watch data.\n\nList of entities running censoring MEV relays on their validators are actively harming Ethereum\u2019s credible neutrality. Source: MEV Watch\n\nHowever, the overall OFAC compliance of Ethereum blocks has declined significantly. In November 2022, 78% of the total Ethereum blocks complied with OFAC regulations. As of today, Sept. 27, Ethereum\u2019s OFAC compliance dropped to 30%, recording an overall reduction of 57%.\n\nPost-Merge daily OFAC-compliant Ethereum blocks. Source: MEV Watch\n\nCountering OFAC compliance requires operators to use relays that do not censor according to OFAC compliance requirements. There are seven major MEV-boost relays that are most commonly used: Flashbots, BloXroute Max Profit, BloXroute Ethical, BloXroute Regulated, BlockNative, Manifold and Eden. However, not all systems adhere to OFAC compliance, according to MEV Watch:\n\n\u201cOf the 7 available major relays only 3 do not censor according to OFAC compliance requirements.\u201d\n\nIt is also important to note that not all blocks built by OFAC-compliant relays are censoring; however, all blocks built by OFAC-compliant relays will censor when non-compliant transactions are broadcast to the network.\n\nWhile OFAC regulations primarily target United States-based organizations, validators outside the U.S. must consider running non-censoring relays for the benefit of the network.\n\nRelated: US Treasury sanctions Ethereum wallet tied to cartel over \u2018illicit fentanyl trafficking\u2019\n\nAmid Ethereum\u2019s reduced OFAC compliance, Grayscale made the decision to abandon all the rights to PoW Ethereum tokens (ETHPoW). However, the decision was attributed to a lack of liquidity in the market. According to an official announcement:\n\n\u201cAs such, it is not possible to exercise the rights to acquire and sell the ETHPoW tokens, and on behalf of the record date shareholders, Grayscale is abandoning the rights to these assets.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, some cryptocurrency investment firms like ETC Group have attempted to launch dedicated EthereumPoW exchange-traded products (ETPs).\n\nMagazine: \u2018AI has killed the industry\u2019: EasyTranslate boss on adapting to change"

        "content": "Will Ethereum Recover? A Deep Dive into the Future of ETH\n\nCryptocurrencies have taken the financial world by storm, and Ethereum (ETH) has been at the forefront of this revolution.\n\nAs one of the largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, Ethereum has gained significant attention from investors, traders, and enthusiasts alike.\n\nHowever, the recent market volatility and regulatory concerns have left many wondering: Will Ethereum recover and continue its upward trajectory?\n\nIn this article, we will explore the future of Ethereum, analyzing key factors such as its transition to a proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain, price forecasts, and the overall market sentiment.\n\nAlso read: Cloud & Crypto-Based Gaming the End for Xbox, PlayStation?\n\nSource: CNN\n\nUnderstanding Ethereum\u2019s Current Challenges\n\nBefore diving into Ethereum\u2019s recovery potential, it\u2019s essential to understand its current challenges.\n\nOne of the main concerns is the transition from a proof-of-work (PoW) to a proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain, also known as the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade.\n\nThis transition addresses scalability issues and reduces energy consumption, making the network more sustainable.\n\nThe shift to PoS introduces a new consensus mechanism where validators are chosen to create new blocks based on the number of coins they hold and are willing to \u201cstake\u201d as collateral.\n\nWhile PoS has several advantages over PoW, such as increased security and scalability, the transition process has been complex and time-consuming.\n\nAs a result, Ethereum has faced delays and uncertainty, causing some investors to question its future prospects.\n\nAdditionally, the crypto market has experienced significant volatility, with prices of many cryptocurrencies fluctuating wildly.\n\nConcerns over regulatory actions and potential bans in certain countries have also added to the uncertainty surrounding Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies. These challenges have led to price fluctuations and dampened investor sentiment.\n\nAlso read: Crypto-Friendly Banks in Europe?\n\nThe Potential of Proof-of-Stake (PoS) Blockchain\n\nOne of the key factors driving Ethereum\u2019s ability to recover is the transition to a PoS blockchain. PoS has several advantages over PoW, including reduced energy consumption, increased security, and improved scalability.\n\nPoS allows for a more sustainable and environmentally friendly blockchain network by eliminating the need for resource-intensive mining.\n\nThe shift to PoS is a vital Ethereum milestone, addressing network scalability issues.\n\nAdditionally, PoS will reward users for staking their ETH in the network.\n\nThe PoS shift will introduce staking rewards for users who participate by staking their ETH.\n\nThis incentivizes users to hold and stake their coins, potentially reducing selling pressure and increasing demand for ETH. As more users participate in staking, the network\u2019s security is strengthened, further enhancing Ethereum\u2019s appeal to investors.\n\nPrice Forecasts: What the Experts Say\n\nSource: Forbes\n\nPrice forecasts can provide valuable insights into the future performance of Ethereum.\n\nWhile it\u2019s important to approach these forecasts cautiously, they can help inform investment decisions and shape market sentiment.\n\nLet\u2019s look at some of the price predictions made by experts and analysts.\n\nCoinCodex Study\n\nAccording to a study by CoinCodex, Ethereum could recover to a price of $28,700 by the end of 2025. This analysis considers Ethereum\u2019s price volatility and the cyclical nature of Bitcoin halvings, which historically put upward pressure on the entire crypto market.\n\nCrypto trader Kaleo has predicted that Ethereum could hit $3,000 in 2023. Kaleo has a track record of successful market trend predictions, although predictions should be cautiously approached.\n\nRenowned investor Cathie Wood, CEO of Ark Invest, is massively bullish on Ethereum. She has estimated that Ethereum could reach all-time highs of between $170,000 and $180,000 by 2030.\n\nWood is optimistic because Ethereum can disrupt traditional finance and underpins the DeFi ecosystem.\n\nThese predictions highlight the potential for Ethereum\u2019s price to rise significantly in the coming years. However, it\u2019s important to remember that the crypto market is highly volatile and subject to various external factors, so caution should always be exercised when making investment decisions.\n\nIs Ethereum a Good Investment?\n\nWhether Ethereum is a good investment depends on various factors, including your risk tolerance, investment goals, and market outlook.\n\nWhile Ethereum has shown significant growth and a strong track record, it\u2019s essential to consider both the potential rewards and risks of investing in this cryptocurrency.\n\nOne of the key advantages of Ethereum is its position as the leading smart contract platform. Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with predefined conditions, enabling decentralized applications to run on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nThe widespread adoption of smart contracts has opened up various possibilities, from decentralized finance to non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and decentralized exchanges (DEXs).\n\nFurthermore, the transition to a PoS blockchain with Ethereum 2.0 has the potential to increase the network\u2019s scalability and security significantly. This upgrade could attract more developers and users to the Ethereum ecosystem, driving demand for ETH and potentially increasing its value.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s important to consider the risks associated with investing in Ethereum. The crypto market is highly volatile, and prices can fluctuate rapidly. Regulatory actions and government interventions can also impact the market sentiment and the value of cryptocurrencies.\n\nAdditionally, technological risks, such as potential vulnerabilities in smart contracts or security breaches, should be considered.\n\nWhether Ethereum is a good investment depends on your circumstances and risk tolerance.\n\nDoing thorough research, consulting with financial advisors, and only investing what you can afford to lose is always recommended.\n\nThe Future of Ethereum: Eth Price Around the Merge\n\nSource: Reuters\n\nOne of the most anticipated events for Ethereum is the upcoming merge, which will combine the existing PoW chain with the new PoS chain.\n\nThis merger aims to bring together the best of both worlds, combining the security and decentralization of PoW with the efficiency and sustainability of PoS.\n\nThe merge is expected to impact the Ethereum network and its price significantly.\n\nAs the network transitions to a more energy-efficient and scalable PoS consensus mechanism, it could attract more investors and developers to the ecosystem. This increased interest and participation could drive up the demand for ETH and positively impact its price.\n\nMoreover, the merger will also introduce changes to the Ethereum supply dynamics. With PoS, users can stake their ETH and earn staking rewards.\n\nThis process incentivizes users to hold onto their coins, potentially reducing the selling pressure and increasing demand for ETH. As the supply of ETH on exchanges decreases, it could create upward pressure on the price.\n\nWhile predicting the exact price movements around the merger is challenging, the general sentiment is optimistic. The market anticipates the merger will unlock new potential for Ethereum, positioning it as a leading blockchain platform and potentially driving its price higher.\n\nTechnical Analysis and Price Forecasts\n\nTechnical analysis can provide valuable insights into the future price movements of Ethereum based on historical data and market trends.\n\nAnalysts can make predictions about the future direction of ETH\u2019s price by analyzing price charts and using various indicators.\n\nBased on artificial intelligence-assisted technical analysis, some price forecasts suggest that Ethereum could experience significant growth in the coming years.\n\nThese forecasts consider historical price patterns, trading volume, and market sentiment.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s important to remember that technical analysis is not foolproof and should be used with other forms of analysis and information.\n\nThe crypto market is highly volatile and can be influenced by various factors, including market sentiment, regulatory actions, and global economic conditions.\n\nLong-Term Ethereum Price Outlook\n\nLooking beyond the short-term price fluctuations, the long-term outlook for Ethereum to recover remains promising. As one of the most established cryptocurrencies with a robust ecosystem, Ethereum is well-positioned to continue its growth and innovation.\n\nGrowing dApp use, DeFi growth, and Ethereum\u2019s industry integration boost its long-term potential.\n\nEthereum\u2019s smart contracts and scalability enhancements attract developers and users alike.\n\nEthereum\u2019s solid foundation and blockchain\u2019s rising appeal hint at a resilient and thriving future despite future challenges.\n\nSource: Pixabay\n\nConclusion: The Future of Ethereum\n\nThis article explores Ethereum\u2019s chance to recover and its future, hinging on PoS transition, price predictions, and market sentiment.\n\nWhile Ethereum faces challenges and uncertainties, it also presents significant opportunities for investors and enthusiasts.\n\nThe shift to a PoS blockchain with Ethereum 2.0 has the potential to address scalability issues, increase security, and reduce energy consumption, making the network more efficient and sustainable.\n\nPrice forecasts and technical analysis suggest that Ethereum could experience significant growth in the coming years, driven by increased adoption, staking rewards, and market sentiment.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s important to cautiously approach investing in Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe crypto market is highly volatile, and prices can fluctuate rapidly. Regulatory actions and technological risks should also be considered. Conduct thorough research, seek advice from financial professionals, and only invest what you can afford to lose.\n\nIn conclusion, while the future of Ethereum is not without challenges, its strong fundamentals, growing ecosystem, and innovation potential make it an exciting cryptocurrency to watch.\n\nAs the crypto market evolves, Ethereum\u2019s recovery and growth potential will be shaped by technological advancements, market dynamics, and investor sentiment."

        "content": "In May 2022, Protos predicted that Ethereum\u2019s major Merge to proof-of-stake would encourage centralization. Yesterday, Ethereum Foundation\u2019s Danny Ryan admitted to a \u201ccorporatization, a centralization, and a systemic threat.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat happens when a regulator realizes that three people control the vote?\u201d Ryan wondered, adding, \u201cI got three doors to knock on. Easy.\u201d The three \u2018doors\u2019 in question are the three validators who now control over 85% of Ethereum\u2019s liquid staking validation: Lido, Coinbase, and Binance.\n\nIncredibly, in May 2022, Vitalik Buterin believed no liquid staking service would exceed 15%. With three services now owning 85%, well, that ship has clearly sailed.\n\nLido is Ethereum\u2019s largest known validator. It is three times larger than the next-largest validator, Coinbase, and seven times larger than Binance. Ryan has admitted concern that Lido, Coinbase, and Binance could eventually gain control over one-third of Ethereum\u2019s entire validator set \u2014 both liquid stakes and traditional, illiquid stakes.\n\nLido is the most powerful validator on Ethereum\n\nLido ascended to preeminence by helping users evade Ethereum\u2019s lockup time commitment for proof-of-stake validation rewards. Rather than requiring users to stake ETH into a regular validator for months without access to their capital, Lido allows users to have their cake and eat it too. Specifically, Lido accepted ETH from depositors and immediately gives them its proprietary version of ETH, stETH, that it pledges to honor at a 1:1 peg.\n\nObviously, most users prefer to receive their capital back and invest it elsewhere, rather than surrender their capital entirely. Even better, Lido passes along most of the staking rewards that it earns from staking its ETH to stETH holders through a blockchain process called rebasing.\n\nThe current market distribution of Validators:\n\n\n\nThe issue isn't just where stake is deposited; it's about who controls it.\n\n\n\nEthereum faces a pressing challenge: a limited set of node operators controlled by centralized entities.\n\n\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f Implications for Ethereum:\n\n\n\n\u2013 Systemic risks\u2026 pic.twitter.com/sznSz5c5Xo \u2014 Mohak Agarwal (@mohakagr) September 21, 2023\n\nRead more: Uncovering Ethereum\u2019s close ties to Chinese money\n\nFinally and as if its offer was not already appealing enough, Lido is a full-service offering that allows everyday users to earn proof-of-stake rewards that are inaccessible to non-technically savvy ETH holders. Lido simplifies all of the complex hardware, software, and internet requirements of Ethereum validation into a simple interface: deposit ETH and receive 1:1 pegged stETH that automatically rebases to reward you. Voil\u00e0.\n\nSo, in summary, not only does Lido give users instant liquidity (stETH) for locked-up capital (staked ETH), but it also rewards stETH holders with generous APRs: currently 3.6%. Even better, Lido simplifies this entire process to a few website clicks.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Lido has grown consistently since launch, powered by its generous offers, resilience, and stETH:ETH peg with deep liquidity. Its governance token boasts a $1.3 billion market capitalization. Its flagship liquid staking token, stETH, is worth $13.9 billion \u2014 the seventh largest crypto asset in the world.\n\nLido\u2019s two tokens are approximately twice the size of Dogecoin. Excluding stablecoins, Lido is the world\u2019s fifth-largest crypto asset. It controls 7% of all circulating ETH and two-thirds of all liquid-staked ETH.\n\nETH in Layer 2s are custodied in small multi-sig teams\n\nWorse, other areas of proof-of-stake Ethereum are also centralizing. Blockchair lead developer Nikita Zhavoronkov also bemoaned Ethereum roll-ups, also known as layer 2s. \u201cThe said L2 \u2018revolution\u2019 is just a bunch of private companies trying to take over cryptos,\u201d he posted on X (formerly Twitter) on Monday.\n\nIndeed, all ETH in the three largest Ethereum layer 2s \u2014 Arbitrum, Optimism, and Base \u2014 are custodied in multisig wallets controlled by trusted, corporate signers. All three have promised to decentralize the these wallets into their community\u2026 sometime in the future.\n\nZhavoronkov continued, \u201cEthereum\u2019s scaling plan is now a pile of centralized rollups with admin keys. Scaling layer 1 yields the true decentralization.\u201d\n\nRead more: Ethereum since Shanghai is worse on at least a half dozen benchmarks\n\nHe similarly expressed concern about Ethereum centralization in layer 2s. \u201cEthereum got stuck the same way Bitcoin did: its blocks became full, the devs refused to increase the gas limit. Just like Bitcoin got corrupted by centralized L2s (Lightning), Ethereum now has L2s with admin keys of its own.\u201d\n\nCrypto Coffee also questioned the decentralization of layer 2s. \u201cCentralized L2s are a psyop for mainstream sellout.\u201d\n\nAttorney Preston Byrne agreed that most Ethereum protocols are vulnerable to subpoenas and legal action due to their centralized operators.\n\nGot a tip?

These are called the checksummed and non-checksummed versions.\n\nHere\u2019s an example of the same address as a:\n\nEthereum Non-checksummed version :\n\n0x12ae66cdc592e10b60f9097a7b0d3c59fce29876\n\n: 0x12ae66cdc592e10b60f9097a7b0d3c59fce29876 Ethereum Checksummed version:\n\n0x12AE66CDc592e10B60f9097a7b0D3C59fce29876\n\nThis case sensitivity is used for checksum validation. The address is compared against the raw binary keccak-256 hash of the address bytes, and where there are letters in the same corresponding place as a \u201c1\u201d bit, the letter is capitalized.\n\nIn simpler terms, checksum validation is a way to tell if an address is valid and doesn\u2019t contain any typos. While both addresses are viable and lead to the same destination, using the checksummed version is always preferable.\n\nIt might seem redundant to anyone who only copy-pastes addresses (which you should always do and never enter a hexadecimal address by hand), if even one character of an address is off, any tokens or coins sent to the wrong address will be lost forever.\n\nThis is not something to be taken lightly and soft errors in your RAM, the switch of a bit from a 0 to a 1, caused by occurrences like cosmic rays, do happen. Unbeknownst to you, the address stored in your clipboard could be different from the one you copied. Such unfortunate situations can easily be prevented with checksum.\n\nHow to perform checksum and prevent sending tokens to the wrong Ethereum address?\n\nWith the importance of Ethereum checksum addresses outlined in the paragraphs above, you are now probably wondering how to checksum your own Ethereum address. There are multiple services that convert non-checksummed Ethereum addresses to checksummed addresses, but we found the easiest way is to use etherscan.io:\n\n1. Go to etherscan.io\n\nUse your preferred internet browser to navigate to ethererscan.io. It is worth noting that you can use any of the other Ethereum blockchain explorer services\u2013like Ethplorer and Etherchain, for instance\u2013to checksum a blockchain address.\n\n2. Insert your Ethereum address in the search field\n\nEnter an Ethereum address you wish to convert to a checksum version in the search box located at the top of the webpage. As a side note, we\u2019ve blurred out the last five digits of the Ethereum address used in the guide for privacy reasons.\n\n3. You will be taken to an overview of the inputted address\n\nAfter searching for the Ethereum address entered in the search field, you will be taken to an overview page showing various publicly available data\u2013like current ETH balance, transaction history, and more\u2013pertaining to the address you\u2019ve searched for. In the upper left corner of the page, you can see the blockchain address (highlighted in red in the image below).\n\n4. Your checksummed Ethereum address can be found at the top of the page\n\nA checksummed version of the Ethereum address is listed on the address overview page. This can be verified by checking if it contains capital letters.\n\nThat's it \u2014 you\u2019ve successfully checksummed your Ethereum address and helped avoid losing funds by mistakenly sending coins to the incorrect address.\n\nWhy Ethereum doesn\u2019t use checksummed blockchain addresses by default?\n\nYou might be asking yourself why don\u2019t Ethereum addresses already come with checksum as standard, which is the case with Bitcoin wallet addresses?\n\nNot too long ago, Ethereum addresses did not have any checksum at all, and it was only in 2016 that Ethereum co-founder and lead developer Vitalik Buterin implemented the function due to popular demand.\n\nHis reasoning as to why Ethereum addresses did not come with checksum implemented at the get-go is that users should never have to interact with the hexadecimal version of the addresses at all, as Ethereum is supposed to eventually transition to actual domain names like \u201cBobsEtherAddress.eth\u201d for Ethereum addresses and ICAP address versions, compatible with systems using the International Bank Account Number or IBAN conventions.\n\nIt is worth noting that in late 2021, the Ethereum Name Service, a decentralized name system built on Ethereum, started providing users the option to attach easy-to-remember domain names to their ETH addresses. ENS, which was initially developed by Ethereum Foundation programers Nick Johnson and Alex Van de Sande, is designed to work similarly to Domain Naming Service (DNS), which maps domain names (e.g. coincodex.com) to IP addresses. In principle similar to DNS, ENS allows users to use domain names (e.g. coincodex.eth) instead of a long string of numbers and letters when transferring ETH and ERC20 tokens.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nDue to the nature of cryptocurrencies, you are the sole owner of your address and your funds. There is no higher authority to appeal to in the event of a mistake. While some services can\u2019t read checksum addresses, they will simply ignore the capital letters and process your address as normal, meaning there is no disadvantage to always using a checksummed address.\n\nIf you're looking to learn about other interesting topics related to Ethereum, make sure to check out our article exploring the concept of the Ethereum triple halving and why it could make Ethereum a good investment over the long term."

Ethereum reached $10B in revenue faster than Facebook.\n\nAnd Microsoft. And Shopify. And Zoom. And Salesforce.\n\nIn fact, the only company to do it faster is\u2026 Google.\n\nThe cool thing is Ethereum isn\u2019t even a company.\n\nIt\u2019s a decentralized network. So, all that revenue goes back to network stakers that help keep Ethereum up and running.\n\nIt\u2019s a win-win for everyone.\n\nCrypto custody is a lot like building a home: there\u2019s no cutting corners.\n\nThe big difference? There\u2019s no easy fix at the store if you lose your digital assets.\n\nThat\u2019s why you need solid infrastructure from the start.

And at a time when hacks and scammers are more prevalent than ever, you can never be too careful.\n\nHave confidence in your crypto custody!\n\nCRYPTO\u2019S BILLION-DOLLAR OPPORTUNITY: CS SKINS \ud83d\udc40\n\nCounter-Strike (CS) is one of the most popular video games out there.\n\n~900,000 active players on the game, right at this very second.\n\n~6M active players over the last month.\n\n~44M hours of Counter-Strike content has been watched on Twitch over the last 30 days.\n\nIt\u2019s huge. And one of the things that makes it so popular is\u2026 skins.\n\nThese are in-game assets that have no functional purpose, but they make you look cool.\n\nSkins are in a lot of games (like Fortnite and Call of Duty) but there\u2019s a big difference with Counter-Strike\u2026 the skins can be traded.\n\nAnd the market is lucrative. My researchers tell me some of these Counter-Strike skins are going for $100K+.\n\nThe most expensive one? This knife skin had a $1.5M bid on it last year. (btw, the bid was rejected)\n\nAs a result, trading Counter-Strike skins has turned into a billion-dollar market.\n\nWell, turns out that one of the most popular trading platforms is actually a blockchain-based marketplace, called DMarket.\n\nIt uses the Mythos blockchain\n\nUsers purchase a skin and get an on-chain receipt which can be used to redeem the asset in-game\n\nAssets are technically off-chain, but the receipts are recorded on-chain\n\nAccording to CryptoSlam, DMarket has seen $220M+ in total sales volume, with most of it coming from Counter-Strike skins.\n\nWhy this matters: Gamers HATE anything (and everything) related to crypto.\n\nBlockchains. NFTs. Web3.\n\nYou name it. They despise it.\n\nThe funny thing is that NFTs and digital collectibles are pretty similar.\n\nBut when gamers see NFTs, they freak the f*ck out. (in a bad way)\n\nWhen they see digital collectibles, they also freak the f*ck out. (but in a good way)\n\nSo, what DMarket is doing is pretty clever. It\u2019s what I call a Trojan Horse.\n\nInstead of throwing fancy buzzwords at gamers, they created a Web2 user experience on the front end and hid all blockchain technology in the back end.\n\nIt\u2019s like when my mom used to make me mac & cheese growing up. She always said it was made from scratch and with love. Lots of love.\n\nThen when I got older, she told me the secret\u2026\n\nI\u2019d been eating Kraft Easy Mac my whole life. She just hid the boxes it came in.\n\nWell, the same thing is happening with DMarket and Counter-Strike skins.\n\nThe result? People are trading hundreds of millions of dollars worth of digital collectibles using a blockchain-based platform \u2013 and they have no idea.\n\nCheckmate.\n\nRIDE THIS BIKE AND GET PAID IN BITCOIN \ud83d\udeb2\n\nCheck it out.

        "content": "More and more Ethereum blockchain operators have complied with sanctions from the OFAC, raising censorship concerns among decentralization proponents and network participants.\n\nToni Wahrst\u00e4tter, an Ethereum researcher, noted that five of the six largest block builders on Ethereum\u2019s blockchain actively censor certain transactions in line with the Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) directives.\n\nMost of these censored transactions originate from decentralized mixer Tornado Cash, according to Wahrst\u00e4tter, a protocol blacklisted by the Treasury Department due to its use by bad actors, including the North Korean hacker organization Lazarus.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/nero_eth/status/1706594750155931953\n\nWahrst\u00e4tter\u2019s research further pointed to censorship across three pivotal players that keep Ethereum\u2019s network running \u2013 validators, relays, and block builders.\n\nCensorship has been a front-boiler topic as blockchain technology advanced and crypto adoption spread worldwide. Decentralized network proponents frequently voice unease regarding centralized entities and the power they have over decentralized operations.\n\nEthereum OFAC compliance | Source: Toni Wahrst\u00e4tter\n\nThese concerns were raised by Wahrst\u00e4tter, who noted that obstacles rooted in the concentration of power by a few network participants pose a threat to blockchain ecosystems.\n\n\u201cCensorship resistance is key for political neutrality in blockchains. No single entity should control 2/3 of a blockchain\u2019s content. Decentralization is essential; centralization at any layer of the stack may harm the whole ecosystem,\u201d Toni Wahrst\u00e4tter stated.\n\nYou might also like: Payments shouldn\u2019t be handled on the Ethereum and Bitcoin networks | Opinion\n\nIn a bid to combat rising censorship and centralization on Ethereum (ETH), Wahrst\u00e4tter suggested two solutions.\n\nThe first is an inclusion list to aid censoring entities in handling OFAC-sanctioned transactions. This solution also recommends booting out non-compliant operators. Notably, this inclusion list was designed by Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin and developer Mike Neuder in August 2023.\n\nSecondly, the researcher proposed encrypted mempools that would make it impossible for entities to censor on-chain transactions based on their origin or content.\n\nButerin, a long-standing advocate for privacy and decentralization, remarked that censorship resistance is a bedrock for any blockchain, crypto.news previously reported.\n\nThe Ethereum creator has also criticized the U.S. for its approach to crypto regulations and how they affect networks like Solana (SOL).\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "content": "Arbitrum DAO needs to be careful how it allocates its $42 million ecosystem grant.\n\nBinance's gas spending spree confuses onlookers.\n\nThe debate over DAO risk management heats up.\n\nA version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Read this and our other newsletters before your friends do by signing up here.\n\nHey, Tim here.\n\nI\u2019m looking at two big onchain spenders this week \u2014 Arbitrum DAO and Binance, and how these two organisations are splashing their cash.\n\nAs Osato Avan-Nomayo explored, Arbitrum DAO voted to give away $42 million from its coffers to help boost ecosystem growth on the layer 2 blockchain.\n\nStay ahead of the game with our weekly newsletters Subscribe\n\nIn a bull market, such news would barely make headlines. But right now, few DAOs are in a position to be giving away millions.\n\nOptimism, Arbitrum\u2019s biggest rival, unveiled a surprise sale of $157 million worth of its OP token without a DAO vote, in what appeared to be a desperate bid to raise cash.\n\nThe sale \u2014 undemocratic as it was \u2014 left the Optimism community and token holders understandably miffed.\n\nIn comparison, Arbitrum is looking strong.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nThe battle for Ethereum\u2019s layer 2 will likely be a winner-takes-all scenario.\n\nLiquidity begets liquidity, and right now, Arbitrum\u2019s not just in pole position, it\u2019s dominating the competition.\n\nArbitrum Arbitrum (green) outstrips Optimism (blue), Base (magenta), zkSync (yellow) and Polygon zkEVM (red) in total value locked. (DefiLlama/DefiLlama)\n\nBut Arbitrum needs to be careful.\n\nHow its community decides to allocate the $42 million will be crucial to keeping its momentum. DAO ecosystem funding has a disastrous history of abuse and misuse \u2014 just ask Harmony.\n\nAlso spending big is Binance, but in a very different way. The top centralised exchange blew over $840,000 on Ethereum gas fees in just 20 minutes shuffling tokens between its wallets.\n\nSo why did Binance submit hundreds of simultaneous transactions and pump gas fees to insane levels? We\u2019re not even sure Binance itself knows.\n\nThe exchange told us the transactions were part of a \u201croutine consolidation,\u201d and that the impact to gas prices was \u201cunintentional.\u201d\n\nOnlookers, including Gnosis CEO Martin K\u00f6ppelmann, were quick to point out that Binance had overpaid for the transactions. If the exchange had spread those transactions out, it could\u2019ve avoided spiking Ethereum gas and paid a lot less.\n\nGas prizes spiking because of a ton of regular ETH transfers related to Binance.\n\na) they are using a really inefficient script to consolidate funds and are massively overpaying transaction costs\n\nb) something fishy is going on \u2014 Martin K\u00f6ppelmann \ud83e\udd89\ud83d\udcb3 (@koeppelmann) September 21, 2023\n\nSuch wasteful actions really aren\u2019t a good look for Binance, which has a few other problems on its plate.\n\nIf intentional, it shows the exchange doesn\u2019t care about blowing close to a million dollars for no good reason.\n\nOn the other hand, if the transactions were unintentional, it implies Binance\u2019s operations are disorganised and chaotic \u2014 which would be pretty worrying for an exchange handling over $56 billion of customer assets.\n\nIn other news, I talked DAO risk management with B.Protocol\u2019s Eitan Katchka and Synthetix Spartan Council member Millie.\n\nB.Protocol wants to help fledgling DAOs better manage their risk with algorithms, helping create a safer DeFi ecosystem. But Millie argued that risk management requires in-depth knowledge of specific protocols and so should only be handled by humans.\n\nRisk management is super important for DAOs to get right, as the situation with Michael Egerov\u2019s CRV-backed loans on Aave recently revealed.\n\nThere are compelling arguments both for and against the automation of risk management.\n\nJoin Millie, B.Protocol\u2019s Yaron Velner and me on a Wednesday X Spaces where we\u2019ll continue the humans vs code debate.\n\nData of the week\n\nArbitrum distributed over $100 million worth of ARB tokens to protocols building on the layer 2 as part of its token airdrop earlier this year. As the chart shows, the value of ARB held by protocols has dropped about 40%.\n\nHow much of this decline was due to these protocol selling their ARB is unclear.\n\nBut it\u2019s no secret that Arbitrum DAOs $42 million worth of ecosystem grants will put additional selling pressure on the ARB token.\n\nArbitrum DAO ecosystem holdings (Dune/@shogun)\n\nThis week in DeFi governance\n\nPROPOSAL: Blockworks Research suggests changes to ATOM tokenomics\n\nPROPOSAL: Kindnesss.eth builds new token database on ENS\n\nVOTE: Aave to greenlight v3 deployment on Gnosis Chain\n\nPost of the week\n\nThere\u2019s a new top-valued Friend.tech user this week after @vombatus_eth spent almost 1,000 Ether, or $150,000, to buy 326 of his own keys.\n\nNo one really knows why Vombatus spent so much to pump the price of his key, but the event caused quite a stir on social media.\n\nCrypto cartoonist BoldLeonidas thinks Vombatus might just be following some sound advice a little too literally.\n\nWhat we\u2019re watching\n\nStill zero visibility on when season 2 will end.\n\n\n\nAnd another 49mn $BLUR ($8.3mn) was paid out to insiders (investors, advisors, team) last week while farmers wait.\n\n\n\nFarmers who bought NFTs via Blur bids have over 45,000 ETH of realized losses since Season 2 started.\n\n\n\nThe\u2026 pic.twitter.com/E9ApoYsX43 \u2014 NFTstats.eth (@punk9059) September 19, 2023\n\nAfter dethroning OpenSea as the top NFT marketplace in early 2022, Blur could be running out of steam.

        "content": "Sponsored\n\nExpanding Ethereum\u2019s Virtual Machine With Cartesi And Testing Rollup Security Infrastructure With The Honeypot Challenge\n\nBy: Jeremy Nation \u2022 Loading...\n\nDeFi Explainers\n\nEthereum is an open source blockchain featuring smart contract functionality that uses the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), where many computers act as nodes to ensure consensus and execute code and confirm network status.\n\nTo enhance the capabilities of the EVM, Layer 2 (L2) rollups provide a computational environment that alleviates the pressure on the base layer chains they interface with. Among these L2 solutions, Cartesi distinguishes itself by offering increased computational scalability, equating to more processing power, rather than concentrating solely on data availability.\n\nCartesi now celebrates the launch of Honeypot, a rollup dApp on Ethereum\u2019s main net, crafted to serve as a gamified developer hacking challenge that evaluates the robustness of Cartesi's infrastructure. Honeypot safeguards real assets, rewarding those skillful enough to breach it.\n\nEthereum developers are invited to participate in this gamified contest for a shot at a growing pool of 35,000 CTSI, identify flaws, test, and collaboratively enhance Cartesi's security.\n\nEVM\u2019s Limits\n\nEthereum\u2019s architecture offers a number of robust traits in terms of cryptographic security, immutability, and lack of single points of failure. Unlike traditional networks where a single or stack of servers store and propagate network changes to multiple machines, in Ethereum all the nodes on the network concurrently store, track, and maintain the updated network status.\n\nHowever Ethereum is not without limitations. It takes roughly 12 seconds, based on network conditions, to update the EVM, and limitations on the computation capacity, or the amount of things that can be updated at a time, presents a bottleneck for Ethereum.\n\nIn addition, the primary language for writing smart contacts on the EVM \u2013 Solidity \u2013 is still relatively young. As a result developers must interact with the EVM using a relatively rudimentary set of tools and inputs.\n\nAddressing these constraints, Cartesi\u2019s Optimistic Rollups enable dApps to perform intricate off-chain computations and deliver verifiable results on-chain without compromising decentralization. Running on top of those rollups is the Cartesi Virtual Machine (CVM), a Linux environment that seamlessly integrates with Web2 tools and libraries previously inaccessible in the context of Web3 development.\n\nScaling With Cartesi\n\nCartesi provides a solution for Ethereum developers with application specific rollups that allow computers that participate in the shared EVM network to use their own processors to manage network updates. Cartesi then batches those changes and sends them to Ethereum, vastly expanding the amount of information that can be processed in the amount of time it takes for the network to process blocks.\n\nDeFi Alpha Premium Content DeFi Daily | Weekdays\n\nDeFi Alpha Letter | Weekly\n\nDefiant Podcast Transcript | Weekly\n\nInbox Dump | Saturday\n\nWeekly Recap | Sunday Looking for Alpha?

Start for free\n\nCompared to the EVM's native capacity of processing 10 million network changes per block\u2014akin to the computational might of a pocket calculator\u2014Cartesi Rollups enable connected computers to process updates at orders of magnitude higher, accommodating over 3.6 billion updates within the same time to finality.\n\nSo, with Cartesi Rollups, it\u2019s possible to maintain a decentralized network on any EVM compatible blockchain while integrating mechanisms that more closely emulate the efficiency and rapid update capabilities characteristic of Web2 server architectures.\n\nWeb3 Linux Bridge\n\nAlthough solidity-based smart contracts offer significant base-layer programmability to dApp developers, the language itself features a very basic lexicon for instructing the machine, which can be restrictive for engineers.\n\nWith the Cartesi Virtual Machine, Ethereum developers can design their apps in a Linux environment, vastly expanding the engineering lexicon. This also affords access to a vast array of established tools and libraries that application builders have relied on for years.\n\nRather than have developers teach the EVM processes already standardized across the previously iterated stack of Web2, Cartesi bridges the gap, affording access to a computing environment where the computer already knows such processes. It lets developers use familiar building blocks in a conventional setting.\n\nHack and Win\n\nTo rigorously stress test the Cartesi Rollup architecture, developers are invited to partake in a collective gamified hacking challenge to identify vulnerabilities and thereby claim a pot of tokens secured within the Honeypot dApp. By engaging in this challenge, participants not only play a crucial role in fortifying Cartesi's infrastructure but also stand a chance to earn rewards for their insights and breakthroughs.\n\nThe challenge is simple. Honeypot\u2019s code only allows a designated wallet address to withdraw funds from the dApp. Developers are assigned the task of breaking the code and successfully withdrawing funds in the Honeypot dApp to their own account.\n\nThe initial pot of rewards up for grabs in the dApp will be set at 35,000 CTSI which will grow with compounding 8% weekly allocations from the Cartesi Foundation.\n\nCheck out the Honeypot challenge by visiting the official launch site to learn more about the contest\u2019s official rules, and get started hacking by referring to the dApp\u2019s Github documentation.\n\nTo get more involved in the Cartesi community, check out the project on X, and drop by the project\u2019s official Discord server."

        "title": "Best Ethereum Wallet in 2024 - Top 8 Ethereum Wallets - Latest Cryptocurrency Prices & Articles",
        "content": "The crypto industry has much more to offer than Bitcoin if you take your time to dive deeper. An excellent example is the Ethereum network with its native crypto, the 2nd most traded crypto whose ecosystem impacted more sectors.\n\nSo, while planning your investments for the next year, make sure that you keep Ethereum on top of your mind because ETH has been set on an upward trend and shows a strong investment potential.\n\nTo keep your ETH secure, finding the best Ethereum wallet that will serve your needs and offer you peace of mind is crucial for any crypto investor, regardless of their crypto knowledge.\n\nIn this article, we discuss the best ETH wallets to secure your digital assets, addressing security aspects, supported cryptocurrencies, transactional fees, and other vital factors that need to be considered.\n\nWhat is an Ethereum Wallet?\n\nDepending on your preferred choice, the Ethereum Wallet may consist of a software wallet or a hardware one that allows users to interact with the Ethereum blockchain. The wallet also allows users to securely manage their Ethereum account, thus performing transactions, enabling the creation of smart contracts (smart contract wallet), engaging with dApps, and many other activities.\n\nEthereum wallets are managed via a private key only the owner should know, but sharing sensitive data or poorly storing it may result in theft or fraud. Usually, the setup process involves downloading or writing down the private key, enabling users to manage their crypto wallets and digital assets.\n\nIt is important to remember that crypto wallets, either for Ethereum, Bitcoin, or any other crypto, do not hold your currencies but a pass or code that you will use to access your assets. This brings us to point No. 2: how many types of Ethereum wallets are there?\n\nBy understanding the several types of Ethereum wallets, you can securely store your digital assets, thus enjoying your journey without being held back.\n\nTypes of Ethereum Wallets\n\nDepending on your crypto management style, there are 2 types of crypto wallets: hardware (cold) and software (hot) wallets. The software wallets need a secure internet connection, rather than the hardware models, which work with cold storage.\n\nWe have to give credit to the hot ones for their accessibility and ease of use compared to the cold wallets . However, the offline ones are more secure due to their nature: they limit access to malware attacks.\n\nNow that we\u2019ve learned the 2 main crypto wallet categories, we can divide them further: hot wallets can be mobile, desktop, browser, and web, while cold wallets are only hardware and paper. Also, we recommend the complete guide to pick your cryptocurrency wallet for a more comprehensive overview.\n\nWhat Makes a Good Ethereum Wallet?\n\nUsually, there are several things you must consider before choosing an ETH wallet, but for now, we are discussing the most important ones:\n\n1. Safety: As you check all the critical terms and conditions before buying a gadget or choosing a platform, you must go through all the safety protocols the wallet follows;\n\n2. Compatibility: A few wallets still do not support ETH, so you must go through the list of supported cryptocurrencies the wallet offers in advance. Otherwise, the wallet will not be helpful in your case;\n\n3. User Interface: The best wallet for you will be the one that offers an excellent user interface that is easy to understand and provides seamless usability;\n\n4. Privacy: No crypto user wants to be required to share too much information. When dealing with crypto, you may still be a little scared by all the attacks and thefts happening in the industry. So, you might not want to share that much information about you, but only what is truly relevant for trading crypto on various platforms.\n\nTop 8 Ethereum Wallets\n\nBest Ethereum Wallets for Beginners\n\n1.

        "content": "One measure of how ETH staking has been incorporated by institutions is the difference between ETH and BTC basis (i.e., the difference between futures and spot prices) in the CME, a venue used exclusively by institutional investors. The reason is simple: Given that ETH now derives a native yield and BTC does not, the difference between the BTC and the ETH basis should approximate this yield because it reduces the futures contract carry cost."

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nJordan Belfort, otherwise known as the Wolf of Wall Street, once dismissed all major cryptocurrencies as scams.\n\nHe has since changed his mind with regard to Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nHowever, he remains skeptical of other crypto assets.\n\nWhen Jordan Belfort emerged as a vocal Bitcoin critic in 2018, dismissing the entire crypto sector as a big scam, advocates of the technology didn\u2019t pay him much attention.\n\nOn the one hand, such claims have dogged the space for years, but have done little to discourage believers. On the other, who wants to take investment advice from a convicted fraudster?\n\nYet in the past year, the Wolf of Wall Street, as Belfort is also known, has done a complete u-turn on Bitcoin and Ethereum, although he\u2019s still skeptical of other crypto assets.\n\nWolf of Wall Street Embraces Bitcoin\n\nBack in 2018, Belfort predicted \u201cthe beginning of the end\u201d for Bitcoin. Although he acknowledged that blockchain technology would likely revolutionize the financial sector, he characterized the world\u2019s preeminent cryptocurrency as a scam and an example of the greater fool theory in action.\n\nBut these days, Belfort has had a change of heart.\n\nIn April 2022, the American fraudster-cum-entrepreneur hosted a workshop exploring \u201cthe latest cutting-edge investment strategies for all things crypto, DeFi, and the Metaverse.\u201d Guests paid to take part with Bitcoin. And the tickets weren\u2019t cheap at 1 BTC each!\n\nAs an investor, Belfort has backed a motley selection of crypto projects including Pawtocol , a blockchain-powered platform for pet owners, and the squirrel Web3 wallet.\n\nHowever, in a recent interview with Benzinga, he insisted he hasn\u2019t completely abandoned his initial skepticism. \u201cMy views on crypto were dead on, balls accurate,\u201d he claimed\n\nContinuing, he said \u201cI think I was right with most, the 99% of crypto,\u201d adding that \u201cI was wrong about Bitcoin, and Ethereum, and maybe one other.\u201d\n\nBelfort Was Once Hacked for $300K in Crypto\n\nIn a previous life, Jordan Belfort was charged with defrauding investors out of hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nBut in his new guise as a blockchain advocate, he has occasionally lost money, falling victim to the pitfalls of crypto investing.\n\nAccording to the New York Times, Belfort once had $300,000 worth of Ohm tokens hacked from his cryptocurrency wallet."

        "content": "This shift, which made it so validators are rewarded with both protocol emissions and priority transaction fees, also unlocked something perhaps less obvious but absolutely groundbreaking for Ethereum: the introduction of a native interest rate. Staking ether (ETH), the ecosystem\u2019s native token, now pays an interest rate. This forms a sort of bedrock layer \u2013 similar to the role interest rates play in traditional finance \u2013 that could power a new, global staking economy. For this to work, though, there must be a reference rate, so investors know what the benchmark is at any given time \u2013 a reliable number derived by observing the mean, annualized returns across a comprehensive validator population."

        "content": "Ethereum price is attempting a recovery wave from $1,565 against the US Dollar. ETH could struggle to recover above $1,600 and might resume its decline.\n\nEthereum is slowly moving higher toward the $1,600 resistance zone.\n\nThe price is trading below $1,600 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere is a major bearish trend line forming with resistance near $1,595 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair could start a fresh decline if it fails to clear the $1,600 resistance zone.\n\nEthereum Price Struggles Below $1,600\n\nEthereum\u2019s price started a fresh decline below the $1,620 and $1,600 levels. ETH even declined to a new weekly low below the $1,580 level, unlike Bitcoin.\n\nIt traded as low as $1,565 and recently started a short-term upside correction. There was a move above the $1,580 level. The price climbed above the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent drop from the $1,600 swing high to the $1,565 low.\n\nHowever, the bears are still active near the $1,600 resistance. The price is struggling to clear the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the recent drop from the $1,600 swing high to the $1,565 low.\n\nEther is now trading below $1,600 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is also a major bearish trend line forming with resistance near $1,595 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $1,595 level.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nThe next major resistance is $1,600. A push above $1,600 might send Ethereum toward $1,620. If the bulls succeed in clearing the $1,620 hurdle, the price could start a decent increase toward the $1,650 resistance. Any more gains might open the doors for a move toward $1,700.\n\nMore Losses in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $1,600 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,580 level.\n\nThe next key support is $1,565, below which the price could test the $1,540 support. A downside break below $1,540 might push the price further into a bearish zone. In the stated case, there could be a drop toward the $1,500 level.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bearish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now above the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $1,565\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $1,600\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

It goes without saying, but before you can start, you must own some ETH \u2013 otherwise, you\u2019ll need to buy Ethereum before you can start.\n\nCreate an account: If you haven't already, sign up for an account on the poker site you wish to use. Ensure that the poker site accepts Ethereum or the specific cryptocurrency you want to deposit. Verify your account: Some poker sites may require you to complete a verification process, which usually involves providing identification documents to comply with regulatory requirements. Access your poker wallet: Once your account is verified and you're logged in, navigate to the wallet or cashier section of the poker site. This is where you'll manage your deposits and withdrawals. Select Ethereum as your deposit method: In the cashier section, look for the option to deposit funds. Choose Ethereum or the cryptocurrency you want to use as your deposit method. Generate a deposit address: The poker site should provide you with a unique Ethereum wallet address. This address is where you will send your Ethereum to make a deposit. Copy this address carefully. Transfer Ethereum: Open your preferred cryptocurrency wallet (it could be a hardware wallet, software wallet, or exchange wallet) where you hold Ethereum. Initiate a transfer of the desired amount of Ethereum to the deposit address provided by the poker site. Be sure to double-check the address to avoid any errors. Confirm the transaction: After sending the Ethereum, the transaction may take some time to be confirmed on the blockchain. You can track its progress using a blockchain explorer. Wait for confirmation: Once the transaction is confirmed, the funds should appear in your poker site account. This may take a few minutes to several hours, depending on network congestion and confirmation times. Start playing: With your Ethereum deposited, you're now ready to join poker games on the site. You can choose from various tables and tournaments based on your preferences. Withdrawal (Optional): If you wish to withdraw your winnings or remaining funds, you can typically do so by going to the cashier section and selecting the withdrawal option. Follow the site's instructions to complete the withdrawal process.\n\nRemember that transaction times and fees may vary depending on the Ethereum network's congestion and the poker site's policies. Always make sure to check the site's terms and conditions, as well as any fees associated with deposits and withdrawals. Additionally, exercise caution when sharing your wallet address and ensure you're using a secure and reputable poker site.\n\nHere are some of the benefits of using Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies to play poker online:\n\nFast and secure transactions: Ethereum transactions are very fast and secure.

Many online poker sites and platforms now accept Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies as a form of payment for buying chips and participating in poker games. This provides users with an additional and often more convenient option for funding their poker accounts.\n\nTo get started, you'll need to find a reputable poker site that accepts Ethereum. Once you've registered an account on such a platform, you can usually deposit Ethereum into your poker wallet and use it to play poker games. Remember that the availability of cryptocurrencies like Ethereum may vary from one poker site to another, so it's important to choose a platform that aligns with your preferences and offers the games and features you desire.\n\nIt is worth noting that Ethereum is not the only cryptocurrency that you can use to play poker. Here are some of the most popular choices among poker players and crypto casino users:\n\nCryptocurrency Poker & Crypto Casinos Support Poker & Crypto Casinos Use Cases Key Features and Considerations Ethereum (ETH) Widely accepted at poker sites and casinos. Commonly used for betting and gambling. Smart contracts allow for provably fair games and automated payouts. Faster transaction confirmation compared to Bitcoin. Bitcoin (BTC) Accepted at virtually all poker sites and crypto casinos. Popular choice for gambling and betting. Wide adoption, liquidity, and availability. Transactions can sometimes be slower and more expensive due to network congestion. Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Some poker sites and casinos accept BCH. Increasingly used in crypto casinos. Faster transaction confirmation compared to Bitcoin. Larger block size may lead to lower fees. XRP (XRP) Less commonly accepted, but some poker sites and casinos may support XRP. Less popular for gambling, but some casinos accept it. Fast transactions with low fees. Centralized nature and regulatory concerns may affect adoption. Litecoin (LTC) Accepted at select poker sites and crypto casinos. Some casinos offer LTC betting options. Faster confirmation times and lower fees compared to Bitcoin. Offers a balance between security and speed. Dogecoin (DOGE) Less commonly accepted, limited options. Available at some crypto casinos. Known for its low fees and quick transactions. Mostly used for fun and novelty rather than serious gambling. Tether (USDT) Widely used for poker and gambling. Commonly used as a stablecoin in crypto casinos. Provides stability as it's pegged to the US dollar. Offers protection against cryptocurrency price volatility.\n\nThe bottom line: An increasing number of online poker sites support ETH and other cryptos\n\nWhile traditional poker sites like PokerStars and Party Poker don\u2019t support crypto, there\u2019s a growing list of crypto poker sites that allow users to play poker with Ethereum, Bitcoin, and other cryptocurrencies. Crypto poker sites are mostly known for their great bonus offerings and modern software. It is worth noting, however, that the amount of traffic still lags behind some of the bigger traditional poker platforms.\n\nA similar trend can be observed in online casino and sportsbook platforms as well, which are becoming ever more inclined to support a growing number of cryptos due to their ease of use, fast transaction times, and increased privacy.

        "content": "Bitcoin price is up 30% versus Ethereum (ETH) in 2023, and bulls appear not to be slowing down, looking at the performance in the weekly chart. BTC is on the brink of pushing ETH lower at spot rates, registering new 2023 lows and extending gains from early this year.\n\nThe Downtrend Remains: Will Bitcoin Extend Rally?\n\nBitcoin bulls are in the driving seat. Candlestick arrangement in the weekly chart shows that BTC pushed on, extending its rally against the second most valuable coin despite attempts for higher highs in mid-August.\n\nIn the second week of August, ETH added roughly 7% versus BTC. Notably, this expansion was after a period of horizontal consolidation as momentum shifted in favor of ETH. However, bears reversed gains and continued the primary trend established since the beginning of the year.\n\nThe medium trajectory seems to be guided by events in mid-March 2023. Then, ETH prices devalued drastically versus Bitcoin, forming a bearish engulfing bar marked by a spike in trading volume. The surging demand for BTC saw prices reverse progress in late October 2022.\n\nBitcoin bulls have since extended gains versus Ethereum. However, one notable formation is that BTC is rallying at the back of light trading volume. Since the rally of BTC in Q1 2023 versus ETH, trading volume has been contracting despite prices printing lower lows.\n\nRegulatory Pressure, Hacks In Focus, Will Halving Spark Demand?\n\nIt cannot be immediately ascertained whether the current draw-down will continue. The level of participation has significantly decreased in the last six months as sentiment dipped.\n\nOver the past two quarters, the involvement of regulators, including the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), seems to have negatively impacted activity.\n\nIn early June, the SEC sued Coinbase and Binance, two of the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency exchanges. The regulator cited various claims, accusing Coinbase of listing unregistered securities and Binance of, among other charges, manipulation and violating different securities laws. Binance and Coinbase plan to defend themselves against the SEC.\n\nBesides regulations, the broader community remains cautious, considering the number of hacks targeting multiple exchanges and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. Some of these exploits have been linked to the Lazarus Group, a notorious cell allegedly sponsored by North Korea.\n\nDespite the general market lull, traders look forward to the upcoming Bitcoin halving event in 2024. The event will create a supply shock, making BTC scarcer. Whether this will see BTC press ETH even lower back to June 2022 lows is yet to be seen.\n\nFeature image from Canva, chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "At the end of 2022, clients of banks had cryptocurrency positions of roughly \u20ac91 billion ($96bn), according to the Basel Committee. Yesterday it released data for bank capital ratios for the second half of 2022. However, bank direct exposures to crypto-assets and digital asset custody dropped significantly and were already tiny. A combination of the Basel crypto rules and regulatory frictions are having an impact.\n\nThe $96 billion was the figure for \u2018other exposures\u2019 under the Basel rules, which mainly includes positions on behalf of clients. Seven banks in the Americas made up the whole amount. No other banks globally reported on this category. Prior periods show zero \u2018other exposures\u2019, implying banks have radically increased their client activity.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to compare across periods because the banks included in the figures may not be the same. And gathering data on the topic is still in its infancy. That said, we only compared June 2022 with December 2022 and the number of reporting banks in each region was the same.\n\nUnsurprisingly, banks don\u2019t touch \u2018alt coins\u2019. Bitcoin linked exposures represent $57.5bn and Ethereum linked products $36.5 billion. The remaining balance was in products linked to Ethereum Classic.\n\nDirect bank exposure declines sharply\n\nIn contrast, the direct exposure of banks to crypto-assets was just \u20ac343 million globally across 13 banks, a decline of 69%. And more than a third of that was not cryptocurrency. Two banks in the Rest of the World (likely Asia) held \u20ac125 million in tokenized securities. Tokenized assets made up 98% of the Rest of World exposure, the only region that didn\u2019t fall sharply.\n\nThe number of European banks with direct crypto exposure dropped from four to two and from more than \u20ac300 million to negligible figures.\n\nThere were seven reporting banks in the Americas across both periods and the exposure dropped by 70% in the last six months to \u20ac200 million.\n\nBank digital asset custody also drops\n\nDigital asset custody dropped by 40% in Asia, with two banks reporting for both periods. Europe fell a little, but the Americas reported zero crypto-assets under custody.\n\nIn late March 2022, the U.S. SEC introduced an accounting rule that required all crypto-assets under custody to appear as an asset and liability on the balance sheet. Assets under custody belong to clients, so usually they are not included in the balance sheet.\n\nU.S. banks interpreted this as requiring capital to be set aside under Basel rules \u2013 even though the international Basel crypto rules do not require this.\n\nIn a recent Senate hearing, SEC Chair Gary Gensler said that impacting Basel treatment was not the SEC\u2019s intent. Decisions on that are up to the banking regulators."

        "content": "In today\u2019s digital world, crypto transactions come at a steep privacy cost. The minute you send assets to a friend, your entire financial history is exposed on the blockchain for anyone to see. But what if you could take back control? Enter DOP \u2014 the Data Ownership Protocol.\n\nDOP is a revolutionary protocol built on Ethereum that leverages zero knowledge cryptography to give users total control over their data. With DOP, you get to decide what information you share, who you share it with, and what remains private.\n\nImportantly, DOP will implement safeguards like zero-knowledge KYC and a governance committee to prevent bad actors from abusing the network. Users can transact freely without worrying about who they are interacting with.\n\nThe first phase of DOP enables fully private crypto transactions on Ethereum. Send and receive assets without publicly disclosing balances or transaction details. The technology is already complete and ready to empower users to transact freely without fear of exposing their financial activity.\n\nBut DOP is about more than just privacy. It\u2019s about giving you back control of your data. In the next phase, DOP will allow you to choose exactly what holdings and activity you want to reveal \u2014 on a case by case basis. Search for your wallet on Etherscan and it will show nothing, but look it up on DOPscan and you can disclose a customized profile showing approved info like NFTs, token balances or transaction history.\n\nDOP doesn\u2019t stop there. Future phases will enable developers to build apps on top of the protocol, allow decentralized lending and trading while maintaining privacy, and even facilitate an entire internal DOP ecosystem with NFT markets, ICO platforms and DEXs.\n\nThe vision behind DOP is bringing crypto to the mainstream by letting users control their data. No more forced transparency at the hands of public blockchains.\n\nDOP is already making waves. Last month, they sponsored a Binance Campus event introducing DOP to top influencers in Latin America. In November, DOP will be a highlight sponsor of Binance Blockchain Week, exposing the protocol to thousands of new potential users.\n\nVentureBeat newsroom and editorial staff were not involved in the creation of this content."

        "title": "Ethereum Liquid Staking Protocols Hit New Milestone Following Massive Inflows - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Ethereum liquid staking platforms are making waves in the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. Recent on-chain reports have revealed that liquid staking protocols have recorded a new milestone in the number of Ether (ETH) staked, reaching a staggering 12 million ETH mark in just a few days.\n\nEthereum Liquid Staking Gains Momentum\n\nWith Ethereum 2.0 thriving, liquid staking protocols in the DeFi ecosystem have been growing rapidly despite recent market volatility.\n\nResearch data from DeFi TVL aggregator, Defillama, revealed on Monday, September 25, the tremendous growth of Ethereum holdings in liquid staking platforms. According to the data, the ETH in liquid staking protocols has risen to approximately 12.31 million and may continue rising.\n\nReports uncovered that a staggering 370,000 ETH were staked in just five days, allowing liquid staking protocols to reach their current 12 million mark. Liquid staking platforms like Lido, Rocket Pool, Coinbase, and Binance are among the list of prominent protocols that led to the recent upsurge in Ether staking.\n\nAccording to Defillama TVL rankings, Lido holds the top spot for the amount of Ethereum staked with a TVL of $13.997 billion in liquid staking. The protocol secured over 8 million Ether on September 20, and another 30,000 after that.\n\nLido Finance dominates ETH liquid staking | Source: DeFiLlama\n\nCoinbase is presently ranked second in Defillama\u2019s TVL rankings, holding approximately $2.155 billion, a significant gap from Lido\u2019s TVL.\n\nCoinbase has about 1.3 million Ether presently in its reserve. Whereas, Rocket Pool holds the third position in TVL rankings and has increased its Ether holdings from 940,496 to 945,402.\n\nBinance Liquid Staking Platform Takes The Lead\n\nBinance liquid staking platform has been the driving force behind the recent spike in ether influx in liquid staking protocols in the DeFi ecosystem.\n\nAccording to reports, Binance added a startling amount of ether to its already substantial ether reserves. The liquid staking platform which previously recorded 445,000 ETH in its reserve, added 318,605 ETH and now holds 764,105 ETH. Research data have revealed that Binance amassed a considerable amount of ETH tokens to support its staking token, Wrapped Beacon ETH (WBETH).\n\nIn the last three months, the DeFi ecosystem recorded a liquid staking valuation above $20 billion evaluating various protocols in the DeFi ecosystem. Following this, Defillama\u2019s September data revealed liquid staking protocols now hold $20.5 billion in assets, increasing by a staggering 293% from previous lows in June 2022.\n\nAlthough the key protocols steering the surge are Lido, Binance, and Rocket Pool. Other upcoming liquid staking protocols like Davos and InQubeta are persisting, driven by the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade and investors desire to maximize their earnings through Ethereum staking.\n\nETH price at $1,587 as liquid staking surges | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nFeatured image from iStock, chart from Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "The Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the United States Department of the Treasury has added a crypto wallet allegedly connected to a major international crime syndicate to its list of Specially Designated Nationals.\n\nIn a Sept. 26 announcement, the U.S. Treasury said it had sanctioned 10 individuals, including many tied to the Sinaloa Cartel. Among those added was Mexican national Mario Alberto Jimenez Castro through an Ethereum wallet.\n\n\u2018[Jimenez Castro] reports directly to a Chapitos deputy and operates a money laundering organization that uses virtual currency and wire transfers, among other methods, to transfer proceeds from illicit fentanyl sales in the United States to Sinaloa Cartel leaders in Mexico,\u201d said Treasury. \u201cJimenez Castro has directed U.S.-based couriers to pick up cash in the United States and deposit it into various virtual currency wallets for payment directly to the Chapitos and for reinvestment in fentanyl production.\u201d\n\nAccording to data from Etherscan, the wallet had a balance of roughly 0.018 Ether (ETH) \u2014 $28.22 \u2014 at the time of publication, with the latest activity more than 200 days ago. No other wallet addresses were included in OFAC\u2019s most recent sanctions, which the Treasury said were in response to \u201cillicit fentanyl trafficking\u201d affecting the crisis surrounding opioid use in the United States.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s actions show that Treasury and the Administration will continue to relentlessly target the criminal enterprises threatening international security and flooding our communities with fentanyl and other deadly drugs,\u201d said Brian Nelson, under secretary of the Treasury for terrorism and financial intelligence.\n\nToday, @USTreasury sanctioned 10 individuals, including several Sinaloa Cartel affiliates and fugitives responsible for a significant portion of the illicit fentanyl and other deadly drugs trafficked into the United States. https://t.co/eb5zLjmaEb \u2014 Under Secretary Brian Nelson (@UnderSecTFI) September 26, 2023\n\nRelated: Sen.

The U.S. Treasury also cited Lazarus as part of its reasons for adding crypto mixer Tornado Cash to its list of Specially Designated Nationals in August 2022. U.S. authorities arrested Tornado Cash co-founder Roman Storm in August 2023 for charges related to money laundering and sanctions violations.\n\nMany industry leaders and policymakers criticized the Treasury\u2019s actions against Tornado Cash. Six individuals backed by crypto exchange Coinbase filed a lawsuit against Treasury over the sanctions, but in August, a judge largely sided with the U.S. government in a motion for summary judgment.\n\nMagazine: Tornado Cash 2.0: The race to build safe and legal coin mixers"

        "content": "The Ethereum open interest has been on an upward trajectory that has culminated in it crossing the $5.2 billion mark. This surge is important to Ethereum\u2019s native token ETH in a number of ways as it could point to how investors are viewing the cryptocurrency at this point.\n\nEthereum Open Interest Sees Rapid Rise\n\nData from Coinglass shows that the Ethereum open interest has risen rapidly in recent times. Over the last week, the open interest has grown, eventually crossing $5.2 billion at a time when the crypto market continues to struggle to loosen the grip of bears.\n\nOne thing about open interest is that it can point to how investors are viewing the cryptocurrency and whether they are bearish or bullish. When open interest rises, it points to investors becoming more bullish. On the other hand, a drop in open interest suggests that investors are more bearish and expect prices to drop.\n\nETH open interest jumps above $5.2 billion | Source: Coinglass\n\nThis time around, with the open interest being on the rise, it suggests that crypto investors are turning bullish once more. This reflects the Crypto Fear & Greed Index showing that investor sentiment has been improving during the same time period.\n\nThe chart above shows that the ETH price has often rallied when open interest has surged, which could happen in this case. If this holds true, then the ETH price could be looking at a rise toward the $1,700 level once more.\n\nETH Could Rally With Crypto Market\n\nThe turn to bullishness marked by the increase in Ethereum open interest is not limited to the cryptocurrency alone. Looking at the long/short ratio on Coinglass shows that long volumes have begun to recover while short volume has plummeted.\n\nEthereum long volumes are currently sitting at $574 million compared to $548 million for short. This comes out to 51.28% for longs with 48.72% for shorts. And while these differences are not especially significant, it does show that crypto investors are betting more on a recovery for the cryptocurrency.\n\nLiquidations have also shown that short traders are losing more in the market. Ethereum currently has a 24-hour liquidation volume of $6.63 million. $1.57 million of this is long positions while $5.06 million is accounted for by short traders.\n\nThe ETH price is sitting at $1,588 at the time of writing. It\u2019s seeing small gains of 0.84% in the last day but nursing 3.59% losses on the weekly chart.\n\nETH price remains volatile | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "My view is if a U.S. spot bitcoin ETF gets approved, there should be little argument for holding up a spot ether ETF. And Grayscale itself has said it plans to convert ETHE and other products to ETFs. I wouldn\u2019t hold your breath when it comes to SOL, ATOM or any other smaller crypto asset, but we have first-hand knowledge that ETH ETFs work. In fact, ethereum ETFs launched within weeks of the first bitcoin ETF. Regulators in Canada were comfortable with the product because there is a regulated futures market for ETH, allowing market makers to hedge risk while creating and redeeming units. I suspect that following a BTC approval, an ETH approval would not be far behind. ETHE\u2019s discount is greater than GBTC\u2019s, meaning a far greater arbitrage opportunity. Also, ETH markets are less liquid than BTC, so the incremental buying from an ETF could have a more material impact on price. And, in my view, ETH has better upside as the leading platform for Web3 development."

        "content": "Ethereum has been trading below $1600. On the daily timeframe chart, the asset\u2019s price recently created lower lows. At the same time, its RSI formed higher lows, resulting in a bullish divergence. Conventionally, this situation depicts that bears are losing power and bulls are gearing up to control the market again. More often than not, bullish divergences are followed by relief rallies.\n\nIn the weekly timeframe, ETH continues to remain engulfed within its macro-rising wedge. Technically, this structure is bearish in nature. However, given the current sentiment flip in the short term, there are more odds of a bounce back from the lower trendline instead of registering a breakdown from that level. Consequentially, this has the potential to trigger a 12% uptick for ETH.\n\nAlso Read: JPMorgan: Stablecoin Issuers Might Shatter Funding Market\n\nEthereum\u2019s Path Up is Filled with Obstacles: Investors, Beware!\n\nThat being said, ETH might not register a spike straight off the bat. The ascent will be gradual because profit booking has already started. The exchange net flows have been in green over the last couple of days. Specifically, on Sept. 26, 2023, the reading of this metric flashed a value of +54,246.33. This means there are more people selling ETH by sending them to exchanges currently.\n\nAlso Read: China: Billionaire Chairman of Evergrande Arrested\n\nAlongside, data from IntoTheBlock revealed that wallets with zero balance have risen by roughly 13% over the past week. This means a significant number of users have transferred out all of their tokens, ringing another bell of caution. Thus, if the pressure on these two ends continues to escalate, ETH could end up dropping to $1422 over the medium term. At press time, the $191 billion-worth asset was seen exchanging hands at $1591.6.\n\nSource: Mint\n\nAlso Read: SBF Documentary \u2018Downfall of the Crypto King\u2019 Goes Live on BBC"

        "content": "Michael Saylor-owned data intelligence firm MicroStrategy Inc MSTR, which currently holds the largest number of Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) could have been more profitable if they had invested in Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH), data from a statistics platform shows.\n\nWhat Happened: According to archived statistics on blockchaincenter.net, Microstrategy\u2019s portfolio could have been more profitable if it had invested in ETH instead of BTC.\n\nSoftware developer MicroStrategy (MSTR) purchased nearly $150 million worth of Bitcoin (BTC) between Aug.1 and Sept.24, it said in a Monday regulatory filing.\n\n\u201cMicroStrategy, together with its subsidiaries, acquired approximately 5,445 bitcoins for approximately $147.3 million in cash, at an average price of approximately $27,053 per bitcoin, inclusive of fees and expenses,\u201d the company said in the filing.\n\nMicroStrategy now holds approximately 158,245 BTC, which were acquired at an aggregate purchase price of approximately $4.68 billion at an average purchase price of roughly $29,582 per bitcoin.\n\nThe creator of the data set, Holger from blockchaincenter.net, a self-proclaimed \u201cdata nerd,\u201d said he collected these metrics and painted an entirely different picture of what might have been for Microstrategy.\n\nSee More: Everything You Need to Know About Ethereum\n\nIf Microstrategy had invested the money in ETH at different points, it would now be holding 3,971,678 ETH ETH and its portfolio would be valued at $6.320 billion, yielding a 34% increase against BTC. Compared with a 12% loss from its BTC investment, investing in ETH would have brought a profit of $2.255 billion to the company.\n\nBy staking its Ether stash, the firm could have also potentially earned an additional 371,355 ETH, bringing in a staking profit of about $591.0 million annually at an annual percentage rate (APR) of 4%.\n\nWhy It Matters: Holger\u2019s data also reveals that if Microstrategy were to trade its BTC for ETH today, the company would receive 2,619,368 ETH as per today\u2019s exchange rates. This ETH portfolio would generate an estimated $208 million annually from staking.\n\nDespite the compelling data, Saylor holds BTC in the highest esteem as can be seen from his tweets, making switching to ETH highly unlikely.\n\nPrice Action: At the time of writing, BTC was trading at $26,331.32 and ETH at $1,591.49, according to Benzinga Pro.\n\nRead Next: Why Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin Are Soaring Today?

This growth rate outpaces many of the largest software companies in history according to a new report by crypto brokerage firm Caleb & Brown.\n\nIt took Ethereum around 7.5 years to reach $10 billion in annual revenue, faster than Meta (formerly Facebook), which reached that milestone in a little over 7.5 years, and Microsoft, which took 19 years.\n\nEthereum reached the $10 billion revenue milestone through fees collected on transactions and other activities on its network. This includes payments for using decentralized finance apps, minting and trading NFTs, sending cryptocurrency payments, and more.\n\nHowever, Ethereum\u2019s revenue has fallen more than 77% from the previous year along with the overall crypto market downturn. The decentralized network has revenue of $1.7 billion so far this year, according to data from crypto analytics firm Token Terminal. A recent valuation by VanEck suggests Ethereum\u2019s network revenue could rise from $2.6 billion annually to $51 billion by 2030 if adoption continues."

        "content": "Ethereum is generally sliding in a wide descending trendline amid extremely low volatility and dwindling trading volumes. It has become increasingly difficult for bulls to sustain the uptrend since June, with recovery attempts quickly giving back accrued gains. The latest dip below $1,600 saw ETH plunging to $1,564 before a minor rebound to $1,598 on Monday.\n\nCoingape\u2019s live market tracking software shows Ethereum price trading at $1,592, 0.3% higher on Wednesday, with $3.1 billion in 24-hour trading volume and $192 billion in market capitalization.\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum Price Prediction: Are Bulls Capitalizing On Falling Wedge Pattern Breakout?\n\nA short-term falling wedge formed on the daily chart allowed Ethereum to bounce off support at $1,564 before stalling at $1,598. As a reversal pattern, the falling wedge forms toward the end of the downtrend.\n\nIt signals that the downtrend is ending and a trend reversal is nigh. However, the price must swing above the wedge to validate the breakout accompanied by an increase in trading volume.\n\nDespite the slow recovery momentum, Ethereum is mainly in bullish hands. The 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level provides much-needed immediate support. This support coupled with the bullish outlook from the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator confirms ETH is ready for a rebound.\n\nA buy signal manifesting with the blue MACD line holding above the red signal line will continue to call upon traders to hold onto their long positions. Demand for ETH must increase to build the required momentum to start a new recovery phase above $1,600.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) is gradually recovering from August\u2019s oversold conditions and this signals that odds are in favor of Ethereum price climbing into the $1,600 range. Note that bulls will continue to struggle under the overbearing sellers until ETH rockets out of the descending channel to mark the beginning of a new bullish era.\n\nResistance at $1,600 is quite elaborate on the four-hour chart, reinforced by the 50-day EMA (red). The On-Balance Volume indicator confirms the lack of volume which explains why bulls have been struggling to break above this crucial level despite the MACD maintaining the bullish outlook.\n\nEthereum TVL Tanks $10 Billion From 2023 High\n\nThe largest smart contracts token has experienced a massive drop in its decentralized finance (DeFi) Total Value Locked (TVL) from approximately $31 billion to the current $21 billion.\n\nTVL is a metric used to track the total value of digital assets that are staked in a DeFi protocol like Ethereum, Solana, or Cardano.\n\nA persistent drop in the TVL could signal increasing selling pressure and vice versa. This means that investors are getting restless with the crypto winter and are withdrawing their staked digital assets from the Ethereum protocol in favor of other staking protocols or assets.\n\nRelated Articles"

The wallet currently contains just 0.017 ETH ($27), but has facilitated transfers in stablecoins like Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC) worth tens of thousands of dollars.\n\nMuch of its transaction history includes inbound transfers from Coinbase, followed by outbound transfers to Binance\u2014two of the world\u2019s largest exchanges that were both sued by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in June.

        "title": "The State of Ethereum Liquid Staking Derivatives (LSDs): Report - BSC NEWS",
        "content": "Key highlights and takeaways from CoinGecko's recent report on the state of the Ethereum Liquid-Staking Industry.\n\nThe world of cryptocurrency is vast and ever-evolving. Among its numerous facets, one that has garnered significant attention post-2020 is the introduction and subsequent boom of Liquid Staking Derivatives (LSDs) in the Ethereum ecosystem. CoinGecko's recent report on the state of the liquid staking industry sheds valuable light on one of few verticals to have boomed during recent months.\n\nWhat are Liquid Staking Derivatives (LSDs)?\n\nLiquid Staking Derivatives, commonly known as LSDs, are tokenized receipts individuals obtain when they stake their assets in liquid staking protocols. These receipts are a testament to the ownership of their staked assets.\n\nThe beauty of these LSDs is that they can be traded on different exchanges for other assets or even be used as collateral for loans.\n\nEach LSD protocol has its own method of operation. Some might employ permissioned node operators, whereas others operate on a permissionless basis. They also differ in terms of fee structures and the distribution of staking rewards.\n\nBut what is notably fascinating is the emergence of Liquid Staking Derivatives Finance (LSDFi), which is a new breed of protocols focusing on building and innovating the existing LSDs.\n\nThe Origin and Growth of LSDs\n\nLSDs and pooled staking saw the light of day with the inception of Ethereum\u2019s Beacon chain in 2020. This chain allowed validators to earn staking rewards, but there was a catch\u2014they had to stake a whopping 32 ETH. LSDs became a game-changer, letting validators dive into staking with much smaller amounts of ETH and ensuring liquidity.\n\nPost the Shapella upgrade, the popularity of LSD staking saw a substantial rise. As highlighted by CoinGecko, the top 8 LSDs have been offering an average Annual Percentage Yield (APY) of 4.4% since January 2022.\n\nLSDs\u2019 Significant Contribution\n\nAccording to CoinGecko's detailed report, LSD protocols are responsible for a significant 43.7% of the total ETH staked. From November 2020 to August 2023, an impressive 11.3 million ETH got staked in LSD protocols. This is a significant portion of the total 26.4 million ETH staked on the entire network. Lido, an LSD platform, has been particularly dominant, claiming 73.4% of all the ETH staked in LSDs.\n\nFurthermore, approximately 100,000 ETH in staking rewards are distributed by LSDs every quarter. These figures have steadily risen, capturing up to 52.4% of all ETH emissions in the third quarter of 2023.\n\nA Glimpse at LSDFi Protocols\n\nThe year 2023 has been phenomenal for LSDFi protocols, especially for the top 10. Their Total Value Locked (TVL) saw a staggering growth of 5,870% from January to August. By the end of August 2023, this figure stood at $919 million.\n\nTop 10 LSD protocols by TVL. Source: CoinGecko\n\nTwo names that shine the brightest in the LSDFi domain are Lybra and EigenLayer. Lybra, post its Shapella launch, quickly climbed the ladder to become the leading LSDFi protocol. By August's end, it commanded 39.1% of TVL or $359.0M. EigenLayer, although a late entrant with its June 2023 launch, has been catching up fast, boasting $245.0M in TVL.\n\nThe Yield Game\n\nYield is a significant factor for those involved in staking. Since January 2022, the top 8 LSDs have seen an average APY of 4.4%. Frax\u2019s sfrxETH has led this race with an average yield of 6.2% from October 2022 to August 2023. Lido\u2019s stETH and StakeWise\u2019s SETH2 follow closely, offering yields of 4.6% and 4.5%, respectively. Ankr\u2019s ankrETH, unfortunately, trails at the end with an average yield of 3.5%, the lowest among its competitors.\n\nLDS Yields Have Averaged 4.4% Since January 2022. Source: CoinGecko\n\nAs of August 2023, with 26.4 million staked ETH, the average yield across these top 8 LSD protocols stands at about 3.28%. The yield might see a downtrend as the number of staked ETH continues to climb.\n\nTo conclude, the world of LSDs is still in its relative infancy but has shown the potential to revolutionize staking in the Ethereum ecosystem. With continuous innovations and upgrades in the offing, the future looks promising for Liquid Staking Derivatives."

        "content": "Steven Nerayoff, an active participant in Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) Initial Coin Offering (ICO), who is believed to know where the \u201cbodies are buried,\u201d has made further revelations in the ongoing ETH Gate saga, which boils on whether or not the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) gave Ethereum a \u2018regulatory free pass.\u2019\n\nLubin\u2019s Piece Of Paper Appears In ETH Gate\n\nAfter being pressured by a member of the XRP community to release the dirt that he claims to have, Nerayoff released a follow-up tweet that contained transcripts from an email that Ethereum\u2019s co-founder Joseph Lubin sent to him personally on July 21, 2014. Lubin (whom Nerayoff now also refers to as #CrookedElbowJoe) also copied Fry, Bertrand, Vitalik Buterin, and Jeffrey Alberts in the mail.\n\nIn the mail, Fry, Bertrand (there is an assumption that \u2018Fry, Bertrand\u2019 is one person rather than separate individuals) stated that the \u201copinion letter\u201d was being put on a letterhead and would be forwarded to Lubin after.\n\nFollowing the revelation of this mail, a video clip surfaced where pro-XRP legal expert John Deaton gave his opinion on the mail. In the clip, Deaton suggested that the \u2018opinion paper\u2019 mentioned in the mail was the same one Lubin had referred to when he said he had a \u201cpiece of paper\u201d in his pocket before the ETH ICO. Deaton also stated that Nerayoff got that piece of paper in Lubin\u2019s pocket and that this series of events was extremely significant.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that Deaton might already have first-hand information as to what might have transpired between the SEC and Ethereum and how deep the irregularities run, as he has already been in communication with Nerayoff (under the Attorney-Client privilege communication). This is something that he revealed during his \u201cannouncement\u201d last week.\n\nIn an earlier tweet, Nerayaoff had also suggested that the ETH Gate was beyond just former SEC Director William Hinman\u2019s speech, where he stated that Ethereum wasn\u2019t a security. He said, \u201cThey\u2019re hiding more than the motives behind the speech by #DirtyHinman.\u201d He also used the hashtags #CryptoJudas (what he refers to Vitalik as) and #CrookedElbowJoe (Joseph Lubin).\n\nWhat Is This Lubin\u2019s Piece Of Paper?\n\nAttorney Bill Morgan seemed to suggest that Nerayoff was indicating that Jeffrey Alberts and Fry Bertrand (who co-authored the piece \u2018Is Bitcoin A Security?\u2019 in 2015) were the same persons who wrote the opinion letter (which Deaton suggested was the same piece of paper Lubin spoke about before the ETH ICO).\n\nIf so, he could be driving at the fact that Alberts and Bertrand (who happen to be lawyers) may have written this opinion letter to convince the SEC that Ethereum wasn\u2019t a security before the ICO.\n\nMeanwhile, Nerayoff reposted a tweet which had a similar theory. In the tweet, the X (formerly Twitter) user highlighted a part in Alberts\u2019 bio where he was said to have \u201chelped structure the initial public sale of ether.\u201d\n\nThe bio alluded to the fact that the SEC had concluded that Bitcoin and Ether weren\u2019t securities, adopting the \u201clegal interpretation Alberts had articulated years ago.\u201d\n\nThe user also noted the relationship between Alberts and Marc Berger (who charged Ripple) as they worked together at the Manhattan US Attorney Office\u2019s securities and commodities fraud task force. Marc Berger is said to be working with Bill Hinman now.\n\nETH bulls defeat bears to cross $1,600 | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nFeatured image from Fasset, chart from Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nDecentralized finance (DeFi) lending has changed\u2014especially following the collapse of major companies like Three Arrows Capital (3AC) last year\u2014and managing risk is now key for the industry\u2019s success, according to Maple Finance CEO Sidney Powell.\n\nPowell, who co-founded DeFi lender Maple Finance, told Decrypt at Messari Mainnet 2023 this week that the DeFi lending space has matured over the past year. Not that it\u2019s had much choice. The implosion of crypto hedge fund 3AC in June 2022, and the contagion that has spread throughout the market since, has forced traders and lenders to reevaluate what is realistically possible.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cBorrowers and lenders are now saying, \u2018I\u2019d rather take a pretty sure 8% [return], rather than a speculative 20%\u2019,\u201d said Powell. \u201cSo we\u2019re seeing much more emphasis on what is the risk-adjusted yield rather than what is the absolute yield,\u201d he added.\n\nYield in DeFi and traditional finance refers to cash earned on an investment over time. In the experimental world of DeFi, investors can lock-up funds and earn rewards.\n\nA little over a year ago, crypto lenders were still promising borrowers astronomical returns on deposits, in some cases over 20%. But those days are now over, in large part due to the collapse of the crypto project Terra in May of last year.\n\nTerra in its hey-day was a massive ecosystem with lots of apps largely focused on algorithmic stablecoins. At one point, it was perhaps the most talked-about DeFi blockchain and the second biggest after Ethereum; its native cryptocurrency, LUNA, was in its prime one of the top biggest digital assets by market cap.\n\nTerra\u2019s most popular app, Anchor, facilitated risky lending and borrowing and enabled crypto degens to deposit Terra\u2019s UST stablecoin and at times earn in excess of 20% returns in the form of more UST.\n\nBut when the music finally stopped, Terra imploded, taking hedge funds that were invested in the project down along with it.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSingapore-based cryptocurrency hedge fund 3AC was just one firm hit hard by the chaos. The firm promised big things to clients wanting to invest in new digital asset ventures. And to do so, it used crypto lenders promising big returns.\n\nFollowing Terra\u2019s blow-up and the subsequent plunge in crypto prices, 3AC filed for bankruptcy\u2014leaving many crypto lenders waiting on their cash.\n\nNow, says Powell, crypto lenders are much more sensitive to \u201ccounterparty risk management.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe lessons taken away [from the collapse of 3AC] are counterparty risk management, managing contagion, and kind of siloing the risk to the individual borrowers that a lender is facing,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that \u201cseeing what is happening with funds\u201d is now necessary so lenders can control it and a borrower cannot \u201ctrade itself into insolvency like 3AC did.\u201d\n\nMaple Finance is a credit marketplace which helps provide loans to institutions. It stands out in the DeFi space because it provides undercollateralized loans and puts them \u201con chain.\u201d\n\nFollowing the collapse of major crypto lenders, Maple in June launched a direct lending desk, Maple Direct, offering overcollaterized loans.\n\nPowell also told Decrypt at Mainnet that debt is a better asset to tokenize than equities.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHe said that this is because it is easier to monitor, while equity is difficult to track on-chain, in part due to its \u201cchanging valuation\u201d and difficulty to track cash flows."

        "content": "A surprising development over the past month has seen the NEAR Protocol outperform Ethereum and its layer-2 competitors in terms of daily active addresses, indicating future changes to the crypto ecosystem.\n\nDaily active addresses in crypto are an important metric that shows how many activities are going on within a project. Let\u2019s discover what is happening with NEAR.\n\nNEAR is Getting Mass Adoption?\n\nData from Artemis, an institutional data site for digital assets, revealed that the number of daily active addresses on the NEAR Protocol surpassed the 400,000 level in September. This demonstrates NEAR\u2019s growing user base.\n\nWhat's happening on Near? Daily active addresses for select blockchains yesterday\ud83d\udcca\ud83d\udc65 \u2022 650k \u2013 Near\n\n\u2022 302k \u2013 Ethereum\n\n\u2022 292k \u2013 Polygon\n\n\u2022 178k \u2013 Solana\n\n\u2022 128k \u2013 Arbitrum\n\n\u2022 77k \u2013 Optimism\n\n\u2022 71k \u2013 Base According to both @Artemis__xyz and @tokenterminal, the Near blockchain\u2026 pic.twitter.com/EcUxtnr7E0 \u2014 Thor\u26a1\ufe0fHartvigsen (@ThorHartvigsen) September 24, 2023\n\nMid-September saw a spike in the number of daily active Ethereum addresses. But those figures have since fallen to less than 400,000. This declining trend was also present in Arbitrum, which declined from approximately 200,000 in late June to 150,000 by September 25.\n\nNEAR\u2019s numbers increased dramatically from around 40,000 in late June to over 400,000. Additionally, as a result of this upsurge, the daily transaction volume on the NEAR Protocol has surpassed that of Ethereum.\n\nOne take \u2013 they are being very multi-chain friendly; deploy any EVm front-end on NEAR (BOS), partnerships within zkEVM, Mantle, etc. while also signing *and putting into production* large web 2.5 deals that onboard tons of users (even if they don\u2019t now it). These deals are case\u2026 \u2014 AVB | alejandro.near (@AvbNear) September 25, 2023\n\nBlockchains like NEAR and Ethereum often rely on a community that regularly transacts, moves value, or validates the network. However, the number of daily active addresses can offer important information about a network\u2019s well-being.\n\nAside from showing an increase in user adoption, the number of daily active addresses can indicate a shift in market sentiment, which could have a big impact on prices.\n\nNEAR Price Stays Down\n\nNEAR\u2019s impressive network activity is yet to extend to its native token. The NEAR token currently trades at $1.10 and has had a 1% decline in the past seven days. In addition, NEAR has dropped by over 60% from its 2023 high. In this tweet, there is an answer to this increase:\n\nNEAR Foundation has been on a relatively quiet but aggressive onboarding of Web 2.5 deals (18+ announced). Just Cosmose (KaiKai) broke ath daily txs and pushed us to top daily active wallets, #1 app. Focus should be on the tech and UX that enable mass, frictionless onboarding \u2014 AVB | alejandro.near (@AvbNear) September 25, 2023\n\nNEAR\u2019s increased user activity is a good sign. However, Near only generates about $2k per day from this large number of users.\n\nSo we advise investors to exercise caution, taking into account the differences in network activity, price movement, and reduced DEX volume on the NEAR Protocol.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe information discussed by Altcoin Buzz is not financial advice.

The rise in US Treasury yields also pushed the riskier asset class lower. The global macroeconomic cues will guide the markets going ahead.\n\n\n\nBitcoin was back in the downward trajectory as the largest crypto token declined about half-a-per cent but managed to hold above $26,000-levels.

        "title": "A Timeline and History of Blockchain Technology - TechTarget",
        "content": "Blockchain was officially introduced in 2009 with the release of its first application -- the Bitcoin cryptocurrency -- but its roots reach back several decades. Many of the technologies that form the basis for blockchain today were in the works long before the emergence of Bitcoin.\n\nStill, blockchain most identifies with Bitcoin -- for better or worse. In the wild and raucous years that followed Bitcoin's debut, blockchain earned a reputation akin to the Wild West. Its decentralized, peer-to-peer (P2P) architecture allowed just about anyone to participate in the process, making it seem too risky for business use. That started to change in 2016 when a burgeoning open source community began developing complete enterprise platforms.\n\nSince then, the technology has taken on a life of its own, with interest coming from many quarters, despite the sometimes scary cryptocurrency headlines of late. Governments, businesses and other organizations are researching and deploying blockchain technology to meet needs that have nothing to do with digital currency. In the face of proliferating cyberthreats and government data privacy regulations, blockchain offers security, immutability, traceability and transparency across a distributed network, making it well suited for use cases that have become difficult to support and protect with traditional infrastructures.\n\nWhat is blockchain? Blockchain is a type of database that's a public ledger for recording transactions without the need for a third party to validate each activity. It's distributed across a P2P network and consists of data blocks linked together to form a continuous chain of immutable records. Each computer in the network maintains a copy of the ledger to avoid a single point of failure. Blocks are added in sequential order, and they're permanent and tamperproof. This article is part of Blockchain for businesses: The ultimate enterprise guide Which also includes:\n\nTop 10 benefits of blockchain for business\n\nTop 10 benefits of blockchain for business What are the 4 different types of blockchain technology?\n\nWhat are the 4 different types of blockchain technology? 7 must-have blockchain developer skills Download 1 Download this entire guide for FREE now! A blockchain starts with an initial block -- often referred to as the Genesis block -- that records the first transactions. The block is also assigned an alphanumeric string called a hash, which is based on the block's timestamp. Blocks are added to the chain sequentially. Each block uses the hash from the previous block to create its own hash, thus linking the blocks together. Blockchain also uses a computational process called consensus to validate a block's authenticity before it can be added to the chain. As part of this process, most of the nodes on the blockchain network must agree that the new block's hash has been calculated correctly. Consensus ensures that all copies of the distributed ledger are in the same state. Initially, blockchain provided a distributed public ledger to support Bitcoin, so transactions could be recorded without the need for a central authority to establish trust in a trustless environment. Not only were transactions more efficient, but also the costs typically associated with third-party verification were eliminated. Blockchain also provided greater transparency, traceability and security than conventional approaches to handling distributed transactions.\n\nBlockchain's historical building blocks Although blockchain as an entity has a relatively short history, its influence today is widespread and its applications wide-ranging and growing. Through the decades, blockchain's development and evolution include some of the following notable developments: Pioneers like Merkle and his tree, Chaum and digital cash, Haber and timestamping, Dwork and proof of work (PoW), Black and hashcash, Finney and reusable PoW dotted the early years of the pre-blockchain landscape.\n\nThe presumed pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto was created to introduce the concept of cryptocurrency and blockchain. Shortly thereafter, cryptocurrency was launched and Nakamoto conducted the first bitcoin transaction, a bitcoin exchange was established and a programmer paid 10,000 bitcoin for two pizzas.\n\nBitcoin's price soared from pennies to tens of thousands of dollars, all the while draped in controversies, shutdowns, crackdowns, bankruptcies, scams, scandals and arrests.\n\nBlockchain started to somewhat divorce itself from Bitcoin when the decentralized blockchain platform Ethereum eventually became one of the biggest applications of blockchain technology and opened the door to numerous business applications beyond cryptocurrencies.\n\nAnd buoyed by AI, IoT, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), decentralized finance (DeFi) and smart contracts, as well as initiatives by the likes of Walmart and Amazon, blockchain has gained legitimacy as a safe, viable alternative to traditional methods of conducting business and individual transactions. Block-by-block description of blockchain's inner workings.\n\n1979 One of the early pre-blockchain technologies is the Merkle tree, named after computer scientist and mathematician Ralph Merkle. He described an approach to public key distribution and digital signatures called tree authentication in his Ph.D. thesis for Stanford University. Merkle eventually patented this idea as a method for providing digital signatures. The Merkle tree provides a data structure for verifying individual records.\n\n1982 In his Ph.D. dissertation for the University of California, Berkeley, David Chaum described a vault system for establishing, maintaining and trusting computer systems among mutually suspicious groups. The system embodied many of the elements that comprise a blockchain. Chaum is also credited with inventing digital cash, and in 1989, he founded the company DigiCash.\n\n1991 Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta published an article describing how to timestamp digital documents to prevent users from backdating or forward-dating electronic documents. The goal was to maintain the document's complete privacy without requiring record-keeping by a timestamping service. Haber and Stornetta updated the design to incorporate Merkle trees, which enabled multiple document certificates to live on a single block.\n\n1993 The beginnings of the PoW concept were published in a paper by Cynthia Dwork and Moni Naor to provide \"a computational technique for combatting junk mail, in particular, and controlling access to a shared resource, in general.\"\n\n1997 Adam Black introduced hashcash, a PoW algorithm that provided denial-of-service countermeasures.\n\n1999 Markus Jakobsson and Ari Juels published the term proof of work. Also, the P2P network was popularized by the now defunct peer-to-peer file sharing application Napster. Some argued that Napster was not a true P2P network because it used a centralized server. But the service still helped breathe life into the P2P network, making it possible to build a distributed system that could benefit from the compute power and storage capacity of thousands of computers.\n\n2000 Stefan Konst introduced the concept of cryptographically secured chains in his paper \"Secure Log Files Based on Cryptographically Concatenated Entries.\" His model, which showed that entries in the chain can be traced back from the Genesis block to prove authenticity, was the basis for today's blockchain models.\n\n2004 Hal Finney introduced reusable PoW, a mechanism for receiving a non-exchangeable -- or non-fungible -- hashcash token in return for an RSA-signed token. The PoW approach today plays a vital role in Bitcoin mining. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Litecoin use PoW, and Ethereum shifted to the proof-of-stake protocol to secure a network using a fraction of the energy that PoW uses.\n\n2008 Satoshi Nakamoto, thought to be a pseudonym used by an individual -- or group of individuals -- published a white paper introducing the concept of cryptocurrency and blockchain and helped develop the first Bitcoin software. Blockchain infrastructure, according to the white paper, would support secure, P2P transactions without the need for trusted third parties such as banks or governments. Nakamoto's real identity remains a mystery, but there has been no shortage of theories. The Bitcoin/blockchain architecture was introduced and built on technologies and concepts from the previous three decades. Nakamoto's design also presented the concept of a \"chain of blocks,\" making it possible to add blocks without requiring them to be signed by a trusted third party. Nakamoto defined an electronic coin as a \"chain of digital signatures,\" in which each owner transfers the coin to the next owner by \"digitally signing a hash of the previous transaction and the public key of the next owner and adding these to the end of the coin.\"\n\n2009 Cryptocurrency was launched during the Great Recession, when the government pumped large amounts of money into the economy. Bitcoin was worth less than a penny then. Nakamoto mined the first Bitcoin block, validating the blockchain concept. The block contained 50 bitcoin and was known as the Genesis block -- aka block 0. Nakamoto released Bitcoin v0.1 to the web service SourceForge as open source software. Bitcoin is now on GitHub. The first Bitcoin transaction took place when Nakamoto sent Hal Finney 10 bitcoin in block 170. The Bitcoin-dev channel was created on the text-based instant messaging system Internet Relay Chat for Bitcoin developers. The first Bitcoin exchange -- Bitcoin Market -- was established, enabling people to exchange paper money for bitcoin. Nakamoto launched the Bitcoin Talk forum to share Bitcoin-related news and information. In the spirit of cryptocurrency as money with fixed supply, Nakamoto set up a system to ensure the number of bitcoin mined won't ever exceed 21 million. Blockchain's evolution through the years has been intimately tied to cryptocurrencies, namely Bitcoin.\n\n2010 On May 22, Bitcoin made history when a programmer Laszlo Hanyecz paid 10,000 bitcoin for two delivered Papa John's pizzas. The two pizzas back then were valued at about $40, a transaction that would balloon to a value of more than $260 million at today's bitcoin price level. A short time later that year, programmer Jed McCaleb launched Mt. Gox, a Tokyo-based Bitcoin exchange. Mt. Gox was short for Magic: The Gathering Online eXchange -- a carryover from a fantasy card game. At its peak, Mt. Gox handled more than 70% of all Bitcoin transactions. But in August, a hacker exploited a bug in the blockchain code and created more than 184 billion bitcoin in block 74,638, tarnishing Bitcoin's reputation. Nakamoto published a new version of the Bitcoin software, but by the end of the year, he disappeared from the Bitcoin scene completely.\n\n2011 One-fourth of the 21 million bitcoin had been mined. By early February, the value of a bitcoin was equal to the U.S. dollar. Shortly thereafter, McCaleb sold Mt. Gox to Mark Karpel\u00e8s. And soon after that, the bitcoin reached parity with the euro and British pound sterling. WikiLeaks started accepting bitcoin donations. However, Mt. Gox was hacked and bitcoin were stolen, causing an artificial drop in value and resulting in suspension of trading. Litecoin was released in October, representing one of the earlier Bitcoin spinoffs and considered the first alternative cryptocurrency.\n\n2012 The interest in cryptocurrencies solidified. Bitcoin's price hovered around $5 for most of the year with several fluctuations. Early that year, Mihai Alisie and Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin launched Bitcoin Magazine and published their first issue in May. A few months later, the Bitcoin Foundation was established to promote Bitcoin and restore public perceptions of cryptocurrency after several scandals. McCaleb and Chris Larsen founded OpenCoin, which led to the development of the Ripple transaction protocol for currency transactions and real-time payments. Coinbase raised more than $600,000 in its crowd-funded seed round on its way to becoming one of the top Bitcoin exchanges.\n\n2013 Bitcoin's upward trajectory continued. In February, Coinbase reported selling $1 million worth of bitcoin in a single month at more than $22 each. By the end of March, with 11 million bitcoin in circulation, the currency's total value exceeded $1 billion. And in October, the first reported bitcoin ATM launched in a Vancouver, B.C., coffee shop. But it wasn't all good news for digital currency. Both Thailand and China banned cryptocurrencies. The U.S. Federal Court seized Mt. Gox's funds in the U.S. for transmitting money without a license. And the FBI shut down the dark web marketplace Silk Road, confiscating about 144,000 bitcoin worth more than $1 billion and resulting in a life prison sentence for the owner Ross Ulbricht for a litany of crimes, including drug trafficking, computer hacking and money laundering.\n\n2014 Despite setbacks, one of the more important milestones in blockchain's history occurred when Bitcoin Magazine co-founder Buterin published a white paper proposing a decentralized application platform, leading to the creation of Ethereum and the Ethereum Foundation. Ethereum paved the way for blockchain technology to be used for applications other than cryptocurrency. It introduced smart contracts and provided developers with a platform for building decentralized applications. Financial institutions and other industries began to recognize and explore blockchain's potential, shifting their focus from digital currency to the development of blockchain technologies. But Bitcoin stayed in the spotlight -- for better and worse. The Mt. Gox Bitcoin exchange filed for bankruptcy. The Bitcoin Foundation vice chairperson was arrested for money laundering. And the U.K. tax authority classified bitcoin as private money. Yet several companies accepted bitcoin by year's end, including the Chicago Sun-Times, Overstock.com, Microsoft, PayPal and Expedia. Bitcoin's acceptance only added fuel to blockchain's fire.\n\n2015 The Ethereum Frontier network launched, enabling developers to write smart contracts and decentralized apps that could be deployed to a live network. Ethereum was on its way to becoming one of the biggest applications of blockchain technology. It drew in an active developer community that continues to this day. In addition, Nasdaq initiated a blockchain trial. The Linux Foundation launched the Hyperledger project. And nine major investment banks joined forces to form the R3 consortium, exploring how blockchain could benefit their operations. Within six months, the consortium grew to more than 40 financial institutions.\n\n2016 The term blockchain gained acceptance as a single word, rather than being treated as two concepts, as they were in Nakamoto's original paper. The Chamber of Digital Commerce and the Hyperledger project announced a partnership to strengthen industry advocacy and education. A bug in the Ethereum decentralized autonomous organization code was exploited, resulting in a \"hard fork\" in the Ethereum network. The Bitfinex cryptocurrency exchange was hacked and nearly 120,000 bitcoin were stolen -- a bounty worth about $66 million.\n\n2017 Bitcoin hit a record high of nearly $20,000. Japan recognized bitcoin as legal currency. Seven European banks formed the Digital Trade Chain Consortium to develop a trade finance platform based on blockchain. The Block.one software company introduced the EOS blockchain operating system, based on the EOS cryptocurrency and designed to support commercial decentralized applications. About 15% of global banks used blockchain technology in some capacity.\n\n2018 Entering its 10th year, bitcoin's value continued to drop, ending the year at about $3,800. The online payment firm Stripe stopped accepting bitcoin payments. Google, Twitter and Facebook banned cryptocurrency advertising. South Korea banned anonymous cryptocurrency trading but announced it would invest millions in blockchain initiatives. The European Commission launched the Blockchain Observatory and Forum to accelerate the development of blockchain. Baidu introduced its blockchain-as-a-service platform.\n\n2019 Walmart launched a supply chain system based on the Hyperledger platform. Amazon announced the general availability of its Amazon Managed Blockchain service on AWS to help users build resilient Web 3.0 applications on public and private blockchains. Ethereum network transactions exceeded one million per day. Blockchain research and development took center stage as organizations embraced blockchain technology and decentralized applications for a variety of use cases.\n\n2020 A Deloitte survey revealed that nearly 40% of respondents incorporated blockchain into production, and 55% viewed blockchain as a top strategic priority. Ethereum launched the Beacon Chain in preparation for Ethereum 2.0. Stablecoins, whose value is tied to another asset class, rose significantly because they promised more stability than traditional cybercurrencies. Interest increased in combining blockchain with AI to optimize business processes.\n\n2021 Bitcoin reached an all-time high of $68,789.63 on Nov. 10, 2021. During its bull run, the bitcoin market cap surpassed $3 trillion. Coinbase went public and was acknowledged as the seventh biggest new listing of all time on the U.S. stock exchange. The DeFi market offering services through smart contracts on blockchain grew a whopping 600% from the previous year, reaching a value of $200 billion. And NFT artwork made headlines, selling for more than $69 million in Ethereum at the auction house Christie's. Well-known entrepreneurs and athletes attempted to capture the meteoric rise in bitcoin's value, including Elon Musk initially accepting cryptocurrency as payment on new Tesla vehicles and Aaron Rogers taking a portion of his multimillion-dollar NFL salary in bitcoin. Interest in using blockchain for applications other than cryptocurrency continued as governments and enterprises considered blockchain for a variety of use cases, including voting, real estate, fitness tracking, intellectual rights, IoT and vaccine distribution in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, multiple cloud providers now offered blockchain as a service, and the demand for qualified blockchain developers was greater than ever. The global blockchain technology market was valued at nearly $6 billion in 2021 and seen surpassing a trillion dollars by 2030, according to market researcher Statista. Blockchain's business applications spread far and wide beyond cryptos.\n\n2022 NFTs continued their ascent, eco-friendly blockchain networks emerged and blockchain applications increased among companies. Bitcoin mining crept closer to Nakamoto's 21 million coin limit, reaching 19 million and leaving less than 10% of bitcoin to be mined. All-time high prices for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies plummeted in the spring due to investor concerns about inflation and the new COVID-19 Omicron variant. Some cryptocurrency exchanges went bankrupt. The collapse of the FTX exchange and arrest of its CEO Sam Bankman-Fried amplified fears about cryptocurrency's riskiness. The open source blockchain platform Terra also collapsed. Speculation of new U.S. government regulation of cryptocurrency added to the uncertainty but at the same time was thought to help legitimize the industry. Globally, Danish shipping company Maersk announced the shutdown of the blockchain-based TradeLens digital ledger it co-developed with IBM because of a lack of player participation. And the Australian Stock Exchange scrapped a seven-year plan to move its trading platform to blockchain. More than 100 countries were involved in the creation of their own central bank digital currencies, according to Statista. CBDCs are digital versions of real-world fiat money to eventually help speed cross-border retail transactions on blockchain in contrast to the slower speeds and price volatility of cryptocurrency. Blockchain's vaunted claims of imperviousness came under attack -- and not just figuratively. Blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis identified nearly 200 cryptocurrency or blockchain hacks, resulting in losses of $3.8 billion. The most noteworthy incident occurred when the video game blockchain Ronin Network reported the theft of $625 million worth of Ether and USDC stablecoins. The U.S. Treasury Department blamed a North Korean hacker collective for the attack.\n\n2023 The bad news for cryptocurrency continued as the SEC indicted executives at the Coinbase and Binance exchanges and filed charges against crypto-asset entrepreneur Justin Sun and three of his wholly owned companies for the unregistered offer and sale of crypto-asset securities. Businesses are still moving ahead with blockchain, but they're proceeding with greater caution. While blockchain technology has been mostly applicable to finance services and banking, other viable applications include gaming, media and entertainment, real estate, healthcare, cybersecurity, smart contracts, NFTs, IoT, transportation, supply chain management and the government. But the latest iteration of the internet, Web 3.0, with its offer of decentralization and data security, may well be the greatest driver of blockchain technology. Bitcoin for now has found some relatively solid footing in the $25,000 to $30,000 range. Bitcoin mining should reach Nakamoto's 21 million limit sometime around 2140."

Currently trading at around $1,576, it is teetering just $26 above the significant support level of approximately $1,552. This particular price point has been a magnet for whale accumulation, making it a critical level to watch.\n\nThe trading volume for Ethereum has been on a downward trajectory, which often serves as a precursor to heightened volatility. This declining volume, coupled with the asset's proximity to a key support level, creates a tension-filled atmosphere. Market participants are keenly watching to see if the support will hold or give way to further price depreciation.\n\nSource: TradingView\n\nAdding another layer of complexity is the long-ago occurrence of the death cross, a bearish indicator where the 50-day moving average crosses below the 200-day moving average. This technical event often signals a continuation of downward pressure, and in Ethereum's case, it has yet to prove otherwise.\n\nThe Ethereum network has been a hotbed of innovation, particularly in the DeFi sector. However, despite its technological advancements, the asset is not immune to market forces. The current technical setup suggests that Ethereum could be in for more downside, unless a significant catalyst alters its course.\n\nIn essence, Ethereum is at a crossroads. The confluence of descending trading volume, a critical support level and a lingering death cross creates a complex tapestry of factors that traders and investors must navigate. The asset's next move could very well set the tone for its short to medium-term trajectory.\n\nCardano meets triangle\n\nCardano (ADA) finds itself in a precarious position, navigating the narrowing straits of a descending triangle. As ADA approaches the triangle's apex, market participants are bracing for a volatility explosion. Currently, ADA is priced at approximately $0.2447, according to recent data.\n\nThe descending triangle is a pattern that often signals a bearish continuation. However, it is crucial to note that the pattern can break either way \u2014 up or down. The key is to watch for a decisive move on significant volume. Speaking of volume, ADA's trading activity has been relatively subdued, which often precedes a burst of volatility.\n\nThe Cardano network has been a subject of admiration for its focus on rigorous academic research and a peer-reviewed approach to blockchain development. Yet, despite its lofty ideals, Cardano has not been immune to the broader market's lethargy.\n\nThe convergence of moving averages further substantiates the notion of impending volatility. When moving averages converge, they often indicate a period of market indecision, a tussle between the bulls and the bears. Once one side gains the upper hand, the asset usually makes a strong move in that direction.\n\nShiba Inu's unexpected dynamics\n\nA closer look at the Shiba Inu data reveals a surprising twist: SHIB is actually on an upward trajectory. While the longer-term price picture might suggest otherwise, the asset has been subtly climbing, albeit with some volatility.\n\nThe current price movement of Shiba Inu hints at a \"bearish flag\" formation. A bearish flag is generally a continuation pattern that indicates a potential downward breakout. However, it is essential to note that these patterns are not set in stone and can sometimes defy expectations.\n\nA pivotal moment for Shiba Inu came when it faced a strong price rejection at the 21 Exponential Moving Average (EMA), a commonly used technical indicator. This rejection led to a 3% price reversal for SHIB, adding another layer of intrigue to its price action. While a 3% move might not sound groundbreaking, in the high-stakes world of cryptocurrency trading, even small percentage changes can have a significant impact.\n\nWhat does this all mean for Shiba Inu? The asset finds itself in a complex situation. On one hand, the bearish flag formation and the 21 EMA rejection point toward a potential downside. On the other hand, the asset has been quietly trending upward, defying broader bearish sentiment."

        "content": "Bitcoin and other crypto tokens were nursing their wounds on Tuesday amid the volatility in the riskier asset class. The ongoing week looks slow for cryptocurrencies due to few macroeconomic updates. After a flat and dull trade, the market is looking for signals to take a direction.\n\n\n\nAfter the recent bout of weakness, Bitcoin was back in buying momentum as the largest crypto token surged about a per cent to hold above $26,000-levels. Its largest peer Ethereum also gained on the similar lines but did not race-past $1,600-mark. Price action in the altcoins remained on the positive side in the early hours.\n\n\n\nThe crypto market has traded sideways with slight buying pressure. Continuing its oscillation between the neutral and fear zones, the crypto fear and greed index is back in the fear zone with a score of 46/100 after shedding off a point since yesterday. Markets are currently dealing with the rate hike concerns and rising treasury yields, said Shubham Hudda, Senior Manager, CoinSwitch Markets Desk.\n\n\n\n\"In an interesting take, data compiled by Token Terminal shows that Ethereum has generated over $10 billion in revenue in a record seven years,\" he added. \"MicroStrategy, in its recent regulatory filing disclosed that the company has purchased BTC worth approximately $150 million since August 01. Total BTC holdings currently sum up to nearly $4.7 billion.\"\n\n\n\nBarring a few exceptions, all top crypto tokens were trading higher on Tuesday. Polkadot and Polygon gained about 2 per cent each, while BNB and Cardano added more than a per cent each. Among the laggards, Toncoin dropped more than 2 per cent, while Shiba Inu was down about a per cent.

        "content": "Elena is an expert in technical analysis and risk management in cryptocurrency market. She has 10+year experience in writing - accordingly she is avid journalists with a passion towards researching new insights coming into crypto erena.\n\nIn a move that has left the cryptocurrency community buzzing, famous crypto influencer Mr. Huber took to Twitter to express his disbelief over the recent legal proceedings against Steven Nerayoff, a former Ethereum advisor. \u201cThis stinks to high heaven,\u201d Huber tweeted, addressing the U.S. Department of Justice\u2019s (DOJ) seemingly paradoxical stance in the case.\n\nWhy I believe Nerayoff: You have to imagine how strange this is. He and Hladys are charged with extortion. Hladys pleads guilty and in his confession states that he agreed to Nerrayoff's idea of extortion. And what happens afterwards? The DOJ then goes on in the very same\u2026 pic.twitter.com/UjfzMriy9U \u2014 Mr. Huber\ud83d\udd25\ud83e\udd85\ud83d\udd25 (@Leerzeit) September 27, 2023\n\nA Brief Background:\n\nOn January 10, 2020, Nerayoff and Hlady were charged with Hobbs Act Extortion Conspiracy, among other allegations, for extorting money and Ethereum (ETH) from a Seattle-based cryptocurrency business called Company 1. These charges covered their dealings with the company, leading up to its ICO in November 2017, and a 10,000 ETH loan from Company 1 in March 2018.\n\nMichael Hlady pled guilty and openly confessed his agreement with Nerayoff to extort Company 1. This act usually would seal the fate of a co-defendant, especially when the plea involves admitting to conspiracy.\n\nBut the DOJ made an extraordinary move. On February 13, 2023, the department filed a motion that aimed to dismiss the indictment against Nerayoff.\n\nNerayoff Strikes Back:\n\nSteven Nerayoff didn\u2019t sit quietly, either. He took to Twitter to present his view that the SEC and the government attempted to co-opt the cryptocurrency industry. He also mentioned he was one of the very few people who had a list of ETH contributors, subtly hinting at the leverage he holds.\n\nTo fuel the fire, Nerayoff leaked email conversations dating back to July 21, 2014, which involved Ethereum co-founders Vitalik Buterin and Joseph Lubin. Tagging them as \u201c#CryptoJudas\u201d and \u201c#CrookedElbowJoe\u201d respectively, he appeared to assert that his contributions to Ethereum were being discredited.\n\nUnanswered Questions:\n\nWhy would the DOJ reject its case despite having a co-defendant\u2019s guilty plea?\n\nWhat are the broader implications of Nerayoff\u2019s potential \u201ccontributor list\u201d?\n\nIs there a more extensive conspiracy in the Ethereum and wider crypto community?\n\nIs Ethereum facing a karmic reckoning? Long perceived to have received a regulatory \u201cfree pass\u201d compared to other cryptocurrencies like XRP\u2014which faced intense scrutiny despite its arguably superior technology\u2014Ethereum now grapples with its controversies, including scalability issues and governance dilemmas. Only time will tell if this is a small bump in the road or a sign that Ethereum\u2019s luck is running out."

        "title": "Ethereum (ETH) Transaction Fees Declining To A Yearly Low, Shiba Budz (BUDZ) Emerges with Unique Features - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) has been a prominent player, driving innovation and revolutionizing the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. However, one persistent challenge that has hindered the widespread adoption of Ethereum-based tokens is the high transaction fees. Fortunately, there is good news on the horizon as Ethereum (ETH) transaction fees have hit a yearly low, opening up new possibilities for projects like Shiba Budz (BUDZ) to emerge with their unique features and empower decentralized gaming. Ethereum Transaction Fees Hit a Yearly Low\n\nOne of the biggest hurdles for users transacting on the Ethereum (ETH) network has been the exorbitant fees associated with each transaction. These fees have limited the accessibility and usability of the network, making it less attractive for new users and hindering the growth of decentralized applications (DApps) built on top of Ethereum (ETH).\n\nHowever, recent data from blockchain analytics firm Santiment reveals a significant drop in Ethereum (ETH) transaction fees. The average transaction fee has plummeted to $1.15, the lowest level since last December. This decline can be attributed to the decrease in on-chain activity and the recent transition of Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) supply back to an inflationary phase.\n\nThe Benefits for Shiba Budz and the Decentralized Gaming Ecosystem\n\nShiba Budz (BUDZ), a project that aims to revolutionize the gaming industry through blockchain technology, stands to benefit greatly from the decline in Ethereum (ETH) transaction fees. By leveraging the reduced fees, Shiba Budz (BUDZ) can create a seamless and cost-effective gaming experience for its users.\n\nSimplifying Accessibility with TreeHouse Wallet\n\nOne of the unique features of Shiba Budz (BUDZ) is its TreeHouse Wallet, a non-custodial wallet that provides users with complete control over their private keys. This decentralized approach not only enhances security but also simplifies accessibility to the digital infrastructure needed for participating in TreeHouse Gaming. The wallet will be easily accessible on application stores like Google Play and the App Store, allowing new users to enter the crypto world with confidence.\n\nEmpowering Decentralized Gaming with TreeHouse Gaming\n\nShiba Budz (BUDZ) aims to empower decentralized gaming by integrating blockchain technology and the BUDZ token into its TreeHouse Gaming platform. By doing so, the project creates a play-to-earn model, where gamers can earn real-world value through blockchain tokens by participating in games and contributing to the community. The tokenization of in-game assets ensures transparency and establishes verifiable ownership, revolutionizing the traditional monetization model in the gaming industry. Enhanced Liquidity and Community Participation\n\nWith the decline in Ethereum (ETH) transaction fees, Shiba Budz (BUDZ) can attract a larger user base and encourage more community participation. Lower fees make it more affordable for users to transact and engage with the Shiba Budz (BUDZ) ecosystem, boosting liquidity and fostering a vibrant gaming community. This increased participation benefits not only Shiba Budz (BUDZ) but also the overall Ethereum (ETH) network, as more users contribute to the ecosystem.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe decrease in Ethereum (ETH) transaction fees to a yearly low is a significant milestone for the network and opens new opportunities for projects like Shiba Budz (BUDZ) to thrive. By leveraging reduced fees, Shiba Budz (BUDZ) can create a cost-effective gaming experience, attract new users, and contribute to the growth of the decentralized gaming ecosystem. As Ethereum (ETH) evolves and addresses scalability challenges, more innovative projects like Shiba Budz (BUDZ) can emerge and reshape the gaming industry.\n\nSign Up and Join the community via the website:https://shibabudz.org/ and Social media links: https://t.me/ShibaBudzP2E, https://twitter.com/ShibaBudz\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization Ethereum ($ETH) has seen its protocol revenue surpass the $10 billion mark after significant growth that has seen it overtake tech titans like Microsoft and Adobe in reaching the milestone.\n\nAccording to a report from cryptocurrency brokerage firm Caleb & Brown, it took Ethereum around 7.5 years to reach $10 billion in annual revenue, while it took Microsoft and Above 19 and 20 years to reach that milestone, respectively.\n\nThe data further shows that Ethereum reached the $10 billion mark through fees collected on transactions and other network activities, which include payments for using decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, minting and trading ERC-20 tokens and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and more.\n\n\ud83d\udca5 #Ethereum surpasses $10B Revenue in 7 years!$ETH has generated US$16.8 billion in fees since 2015, with over 60.0% of this converting into revenue. \ud83d\udc40 pic.twitter.com/MxQdY0uezu \u2014 RR2Capital (@RR2Capital) September 26, 2023\n\nEthereum\u2019s network revenue has notably plummeted by over 77% since last year, amid a wider crypto market slump. The decentralized platform has earned $1.7 billion in 2023 so far, according to Token Terminal, a crypto analytics company.\n\nHowever, a VanEck valuation projects that Ethereum could increase its annual revenue from $2.6 billion to $51 billion by 2030, if it continues to grow its user base. Notably, a recent JPMorgan report suggests that after the Shanghai upgrade, Ethereum failed to meet expectations and attract institutional interest.\n\nEthereum\u2019s key performance indicators, such as daily transactions, active user addresses, and the total value locked in decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, have all apparently seen a downturn after an underwhelming boost in network activity.\n\nThe amount of Ether staked has increased by 50% since the Shanghai upgrade, but this has not translated into heightened network activity, partly over the recent collapse of cryptocurrency ecosystems like Terra and of crypto exchange FTX.\n\nCurrent data from Etherscan reveals that Ethereum facilitated over 883,000 transactions on September 24, 2023. However, this was a decline from the 1.93 million transactions recorded on December 9. At present, the mean transaction fee hovers around $0.74.\n\nFeatured image via Pixabay."
