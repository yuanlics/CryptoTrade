        "content": "One year after its historic transition to proof of stake, Ethereum has seen a massive reduction in energy use and a marked improvement in access to the network, however, a number of technical issues still mark the road ahead.\n\nThe Merge was executed on Sept. 15, 2022 \u2014 an event that saw the Ethereum mainnet merging with a separate proof-of-stake blockchain called the Beacon Chain.\n\nThe most noticeable improvement to Ethereum post-merge was the seismic shift from an energy-guzzling proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism to PoS, which saw the Ethereum network drastically reduce its total power consumption.\n\nAccording to data from The Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance, the Ethereum network has seen its energy use drop more than 99.9% from the approximately 21 terawatt hours of electricity it used while running under PoW.\n\nThe Merge has reduced Ethereum's power consumption by more than 99%. Source: CCAF\n\nEthereum turns deflationary\n\nOutside of using less power, The Merge also saw the Ethereum network become economically deflationary, meaning that the number of new Ether (ETH) issued to secure the network has been outpaced by the amount of ETH removed from supply forever.\n\nAccording to data from the Ethereum data provider ultrasound.money, a little more than 300,000 ETH (worth $488 million at current prices) has been burned since the Merge. At current burn rates, the total supply of ETH is being reduced at a rate of 0.25% per year.\n\nChange in ETH supply since the Merge. Source: Ultrasound Money\n\nWhile many proponents believed that the price of Ethereum would surge in response to this new deflationary pressure, the hopes of a dramatic increase in the price of ETH were buffeted by a series of macroeconomics headwinds such as the banking crisis and spiking inflation.\n\nNotably, the growth of ETH paled in comparison to the growth in the price of Bitcoin (BTC) in the first quarter of this year, with the flagship crypto asset seeming to benefit from much of the traditional financial instability brought about by the banking crisis.\n\nPrice action aside, the central theme of the proof-of-stake upgrade was the introduction of stakers in place of miners to secure the network.\n\nThe subsequent Shapella upgrade in April 2023 drove ETH in huge droves toward staking. The top beneficiaries of this shift were the liquid staking providers such as Lido and Rocket Pool.\n\nLiquid staking takes over\n\nSince the Merge, liquid staking providers have come to dominate the Ethereum landscape, with more than $19.5 billion worth of ETH currently staked by way of liquid staking protocols, according to data from DefiLlama.\n\nAt the time of publication, Lido is by far the largest staking provider, accounting for 72% of all staked ETH.\n\nLido currently accounts for 72% of all staking on Ethereum. Source: DeFiLlama\n\nHowever, while many Ethereum advocates, including Labrys CEO Lachlan Feeney, have praised the switch to staking for removing the barriers of expensive, sophisticated hardware for mining, one of the primary concerns with the rise of liquid staking has been the level of control granted to staking providers, in particular Lido Finance.\n\n\u201cLiquid staking is ultimately good for the network as it ensures that the governance of the network is not restricted only to the wealthy. However, it has also led to the rise of its own problems,\u201d Feeney told Cointelegraph.\n\nAt least five Ethereum liquid staking providers working towards imposing a 22% limit rule, in a move to ensure the Ethereum network remains decentralized \u2014 though Lido voted not to take part.\n\nRelated: Ethereum\u2019s active addresses second-highest in history: Analysts\n\nNotably, Lido voted by a 99.81% majority not to self-limit back in June, leading Ethereum advocate Superphiz to declare that the the staking providers had \u201cexpressed an intention to control the majority of validators on the beacon chain.\u201d\n\nLido voted by a 99.81% majority not to self-limit. They have expressed an intention to control the majority of validators on the beacon chain.https://t.co/T16rTdM3gm \u2014 superphiz.eth \ufe0f (@superphiz) August 31, 2023\n\nThis move has led to widespread concerns over the potential centralization of validation on Ethereum.\n\n\u201cLido presently controls 32.26% of all staked Ether on the network worth over $14 billion. In the long run, I am confident that Ethereum is better off with liquid staking than without it; however, there are many challenges that still need to be overcome,\u201d Feeney concluded.\n\nFeeny also noted that the most pressing concern for Ethereum in the immediate future was the growing regulatory pressure against crypto and blockchain in the United States more broadly.\n\n\u201cRegulatory bodies, particularly in the U.S., appear to be hellbent at the moment on eliminating the U.S.-based blockchain industry,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt would be devastating for Ethereum and the global blockchain community if it becomes too difficult for blockchain companies to operate in the U.S.\u201d\n\nOutside of staking, client diversity also remains a central issue. On Sept. 5, Vitalik Buterin took to the stage at Korea Blockchain Week to discuss the six key problems that need addressing to solve the problem of centralization.\n\nCurrently, the majority of the 5,901 active Ethereum nodes are being run through centralized web providers like Amazon Web Services, which many experts claim leaves the Ethereum blockchain exposed to a centralized point of failure.\n\nDistribution of Ethereum nodes from web service providers. Source: Ethernodes\n\nIn Buterin\u2019s view, in order for Ethereum to remain sufficiently decentralized in the long-term it needs to be easier for everyday people to run nodes, which means drastically reducing costs and hardware requirements for node operators.\n\nButerin\u2019s primary solution was the concept of statelessness, which removes the reliance on centralized servers by reducing data requirements for node operators to near-zero.\n\n\u201cToday, it takes hundreds of gigabytes of data to run a node. With stateless clients, you can run a node on basically zero.\u201d\n\nWhile this was Buterin\u2019s most prominent concern for the centralization issue, he explained that these problems may not be solved for another 10 to 20 years.\n\nCollect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space.\n\nMagazine: NFT collapse and monster egos feature in new Murakami exhibition"

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nA new update to the Ethereum network, known as EIP-7514, is a game-changer, and here's why it matters to every investor out there.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFirst off, what's an EIP? It stands for Ethereum Improvement Proposal, a term for a planned update. This particular one, EIP-7514, is part of the Ethereum Dencun upgrade. Its main goal? To slow down how quickly people are staking their Ethereum (ETH) and give the community more time to figure out the best way to reward those who do.\n\nWhy slow down staking? Well, if everyone rushes to stake their ETH, we could hit a point where half of all ETH is staked by May 2024, three-quarters by September 2024 and \u2014 hold your breath \u2014 100% by December 2024. While that might sound like a good thing, it is not. Too much staking can strain the network and does not necessarily make it more secure. Plus, rewards for staking could become so small that they are not worth the effort.\n\nThe update changes how many new validators (people who process transactions and create new blocks) can join the network. Before, this number could grow exponentially, but now it will increase at a more controlled, linear rate. This is crucial because more validators mean more messages and data to handle, which could slow things down.\n\nBut what about rewards for staking? That is still up for debate. The Ethereum community is buzzing with discussions on how to best incentivize people to stake their ETH. This update buys time for those conversations to happen and for researchers to explore better solutions.\n\nSo, what's the takeaway? EIP-7514 is similar to hitting the \"pause\" button. It gives the Ethereum community a chance to catch its breath, reassess and make more informed decisions about the future. And for a network that has seen explosive growth and change since its inception, a moment to pause and reflect is not just welcome; it is essential."

        "title": "One Year After the Merge: Where Does Ethereum Stand? - Decrypt",
        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nThe crypto zeitgeist evolves so quickly that Ethereum\u2019s so-called merge feels like forever ago. But it\u2019s been exactly one year since the network fully transitioned to using proof of stake and there have been notable shifts since the change.\n\nIn terms of Ethereum\u2019s price, not much may appear to have changed since last September. A day before the transition took place, ETH traded hands at around $1,600\u2014approximately the same price it\u2019s trading at a year later.\n\nHowever, under the hood and on-chain, there have been substantial developments, whether that\u2019s a decrease in Ethereum\u2019s overall supply or a sharp increase in the amount of Ethereum that\u2019s staked, just to name a few.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEnergy Consumption\n\nPrior to the shift, Ethereum verified on-chain transactions with the same consensus mechanism as Bitcoin: proof of work. It requires miners to compete to solve complex mathematical equations. In exchange for participating in the energy-intensive process, they earn rewards.\n\nBut when Ethereum shifted to proof of stake, it meant validators, not miners, needed to pledge Ethereum to secure the network in exchange for rewards. One of the most notable impacts was a reduction in Ethereum\u2019s energy use. The network\u2019s carbon footprint shrank by 99.99%, according to a report from the Crypto Carbon Ratings Institute.\n\nCrypto has garnered a mainstream reputation for consuming lots of energy. And Canadian investor Kevin O'Leary is among those who have highlighted ESG concerns as one of the main things holding crypto adoption back. Financial institutions from BlackRock to Fidelity have caught flack for crypto moves due to environmental concerns with crypto as well.\n\nIt\u2019s significant that the merge rendered those anti-crypto criticisms moot for the industry\u2019s second-largest coin, Dermot O'Riordan, director of the Pocket Network Foundation told Decrypt.\n\n\u201cPeople were like, \u2018This seems fun and cool, but you\u2019re all bucking around while the Earth is burning,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a genuine drag on the believability and credibility of the technology.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLiquid Staking\n\nSince Ethereum\u2019s transition, the amount of Ethereum staked has nearly doubled. The total has grown 93% to 26.5 million Ethereum worth close to $43 billion, according to a dashboard on Dune created by Dragonfly Data Scientist Hildebert Mouli\u00e9. That equates to one out of every five Ethereum.\n\nAt the same time, centralization and censorship concerns have been raised in the upgrade\u2019s wake. That\u2019s because people fear control over verifying the network\u2019s transactions could become isolated in the hands of a few, whether that\u2019s a firm like an exchange or projects that make it easier for users to pool funds together and earn staking rewards.\n\nAhead of the merge, some were particularly concerned about exchanges like Coinbase becoming involved in staking due to U.S. sanctions against Tornado Cash, the coin-mixing service. The worry that centralized entities would censor transactions to stay compliant made decentralized applications like Lido Finance a better bet in terms of decentralization.\n\nHowever, the heavy use of Lido, a liquid staking solution, has garnered particular attention as of late. It\u2019s now been identified as a potential weak point for Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem in terms of decentralization because Lido now supports 32% of all Ethereum staked, according to Mouli\u00e9\u2019s dashboard.\n\nWhen it comes to liquid staking tokens, Lido Staked Ethereum ($STETH) looms large, with a market capitalization of $14 billion, according to CoinGecko. For reference, the second largest token by market capitalization representing staked Ethereum is Rocket Pool ETH ($RETH), with a market capitalization of $926 million.\n\nDespite concerns, O'Riordan noted that liquid staking tokens have been a major source of growth for decentralized finance.\n\nLiquid staking enables Ethereum holders to pledge their tokens for a reward, and still be able to leverage the value of that Ethereum with a respective token that\u2019s issued and pegged to its price. Even though decentralized exchanges have seen a dip in value for associated assets since the merge, liquid staking continues to flourish.\n\nWhen the merge took place, there wasn\u2019t a way for people to withdraw staked Ethereum, making services like Lido especially attractive. But Ethereum\u2019s Shanghai upgrade in April enabled staking withdrawals, effectively sealing the network\u2019s transition to proof of stake.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nScaling Solutions\n\nIn order for Ethereum to achieve significant adoption, the network needs to be able to process lots of transactions in a timely way\u2014so the logic goes.\n\nThe merge wasn't intended to improve Ethereum\u2019s speed, and as a result, Ethereum\u2019s average transactions per second has mostly hovered in the teens since last September, according to the analytics site L2 Beat. Still, it set the stage for what\u2019s next.\n\nThe \u201csurge,\u201d a suite of upgrades slated to follow the merge, is expected to improve Ethereum\u2019s scalability, according to a vision for Ethereum\u2019s roadmap articulated by co-founder Vitalik Buterin ahead of the merge last July.\n\nHowever, scaling solutions that seek to address Ethereum\u2019s current limitations have also become more present in crypto. Average transactions per second between all Ethereum layer-2 networks has now surpassed 50, a significant improvement from last year, according to L2 Beat.\n\nWhen combined, the total number of transactions over the past 30 days for popular layer-2 networks zkSync Era, Optimism, and Arbitrum Nova totals over 61 million. That\u2019s twice the number of transactions on Ethereum during the same span.\n\nThe recent proliferation of layer-2 tech is partly due to a foundation the merge created in terms of security at Ethereum\u2019s base level, Nebojsa Urosevic, co-founder of infrastructure solutions provider Tenderly told Decrypt.\n\n\u201cThe merge indeed laid foundational bricks for further scalability enhancements,\u201d he said. \u201cPost-merge, we've seen a bolstered commitment to layering approaches, with layer-2 solutions coming to the forefront.\u201d\n\nThe SEC\n\nMeanwhile, staking has emerged as a regulatory flashpoint in the U.S., where the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has gone after several crypto exchanges for offering services to help users earn network rewards.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nKraken's settlement with the SEC in February, involving a $30 million fine, stemmed from allegations that its staking-as-a-service program constituted an unregistered securities offering. Similar claims were raised against Coinbase and Binance in lawsuits over their respective staking products.\n\nWhile the SEC has ensnared several tokens in its lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase, alleging they are examples of unregistered securities, some have noticed and questioned why the regulator hasn\u2019t called out tokens that use proof of work as illicitly issued assets.\n\nBut U.S. regulators are still at odds over how to classify Ethereum. The result is an apparent turf war between two of the largest financial watchdogs: The SEC and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).\n\nCFTC Chairman Rostin Behnam said Ethereum is a commodity in March. A month before, SEC Chair Gary Gensler had suggested that \u201ceverything but Bitcoin\u201d is a security, and then he sidestepped questions regarding Ethereum in April.\n\nSupply & Direction\n\nAnother notable impact the merge has had on Ethereum is a decrease in the token\u2019s overall supply. The way the shift has changed how new Ethereum is issued versus how often it's removed from circulation\u2014a process known as burning\u2014has resulted in a 0.25% decrease in the total amount of Ethereum in circulation, according to sound.money.\n\nIn retrospect, the merge may seem like a footnote in crypto\u2019s history books compared to the turbulence and corporate blow-ups that defined crypto markets in 2022. But in terms of the future, O'Riordan compared it to a beacon that illuminates Ethereum\u2019s overall direction.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a renewed belief in confidence that Ethereum can actually pull off these major technical upgrades and do ambitious things,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile Ethereum can be slower than we\u2019d all like it to be, it\u2019s ultimately moving forward and staying true to its values at the same time.\u201d\n\nDevelopers have been hammering out plans for one of Ethereum\u2019s next big upgrades, dubbed \u201cDencun,\u201d core developer Mario Havel told Decrypt in July. It includes the introduction of a feature called proto-danksharding, which is expected to scale Ethereum to over 100,000 transactions per second once it\u2019s fully realized.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOther features in the works, such as account abstraction, would effectively make managing a crypto wallet as easy as managing an email account. And earlier this month Buterin talked about a feature called stateless clients, which would make running Ethereum nodes on smartphones feasible down the line."

        "content": "Ethereum developers launched a new test network, Holesky, on Friday that they say will improve the largest smart-contracts blockchain\u2019s testing capability \u2013 by making it twice as big, at least based on one metric, than the main network.\n\nThe first blocks proposed on the new test network were visible on Friday via a new blockchain explorer set up specifically to monitor Holesky, on the website beaconcha.in.\n\nThe launch of Holesky was selected to mark the first anniversary of Ethereum completing the \"Merge,\" its historic transition to a \"proof-of-stake\" blockchain, from the original and more energy-hungry \"proof-of-work\" model that Bitcoin uses.\n\nTestnets are copies of a blockchain \u2013 in this case Ethereum \u2013 used specifically for testing new applications and smart contracts in a low-stakes environment.\n\nEthereum developers expect Holesky to eventually replace the Goerli testnet, targeted for sunset in early 2024.\n\nBiggest testnet for Ethereum\n\nEthereum core developer Parithosh Jayanthi told CoinDesk that Holesky is expected to become the biggest testnet for Ethereum, and should have 1.4 million validators to help address scalability problems with mainnet. That's double the 700,000 on Ethereum.\n\nGoerli and Sepolia, another Ethereum testnet, are operated by a smaller subset of \u201cvalidators\u201d than the main Ethereum chain, and some developers think these smaller validator sets pose a problem.\n\nBy making Holesky bigger, developers will theoretically be able to test infrastructure and upgrades under more rigorous conditions, meaning tests that go smoothly on Holesky should be less likely to face unforeseen issues on mainnet.\n\n\u201cWe don't want to hit a scaling issue that could happen first on mainnet,\u201d Jayanthi told CoinDesk prior to Holesky's debut. \u201cWe want to catch [scaling issues] on testnet, which means we have to have a testnet that's bigger\u201d than the main Ethereum chain.\n\nRead more: Hello Holesky, Ethereum\u2019s Newest Testnet"

        "title": "The Merge one year on: Ethereum no longer a 'wanton environmental polluter' but centralisation issues remain - DLNews",
        "content": "Ethereum celebrates the one year anniversary of its transition to Proof-of-Stake on Friday.\n\nUnder Proof-of-Stake, the network has reduced global electricity demand by an amount equal to that of entire countries such as Myanmar and Slovakia.\n\nBut the Merge has done little to help some existing problems, such as a lack of client diversity.\n\nA year on from the Merge, Ethereum\u2019s landmark upgrade has bolstered the blockchain\u2019s public image and enhanced its green credentials. But issues of centralisation and technical diversity remain, according to developers and DeFi builders.\n\nSeptember 15 marks the one-year anniversary of the Merge, which, among other things, transitioned the leading smart contract network from the energy-intensive Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism to the greener Proof-of-Stake.\n\nUnder Proof-of-Stake, Ethereum has reduced global electricity demand by an amount equal to that of entire countries such as Myanmar and Slovakia in the year since the Merge.\n\nThat\u2019s according to data from The Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance, which says Ethereum\u2019s energy use dropped 99.99%, down from the estimated 21.41 terawatt hours of electricity it used the year before the Merge under Proof-of-Work.\n\nStay ahead of the game with our weekly newsletters Subscribe\n\nEthereum\u2019s new green credentials have had the biggest impact in the year since the transition.\n\n\u201cThe discussion changed a lot,\u201d Ethereum core developer Marius van der Wijden told DL News. \u201cIf you discussed crypto or Ethereum before the Merge, it immediately went to energy consumption and emissions.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow we can have good discussions about the merits of blockchain without having to discuss the environmental impacts,\u201d he added.\n\nNOW READ: Vesta Finance token soars 150% as DeFi protocol is rocked by rage quit proposal\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nAnd Van der Wijden isn\u2019t the only one to say so.\n\n\u201cNo longer being a wanton environmental polluter is a significant improvement to the blockchain\u2019s public image,\u201d Nick Ashley, marketing manager at Ether liquid staking provider Rocket Pool, told DL News. \u201cInstitutions can take Ethereum more seriously, with the option to earn a return on their holdings while complying with ESG policies.\u201d\n\nAshley also noted the increasing interest from universities, which are now more eager to participate in Ethereum\u2019s security and contribute to ongoing research and education.\n\nHowever, while many predicted that Ethereum might see increased investment interest after the Merge thanks in part to its energy use reduction, this has yet to materialise.\n\nData from Coinshares shows that institutional investment into Ethereum actually decreased by $108 million since the start of the year. In a September 11 report, Coinshares noted that Ethereum was the \u201cleast loved digital asset amongst exchange traded products investors this year.\u201d\n\nEconomic improvements\n\nAside from cutting carbon emissions, The Merge also cut issuance of Ethereum\u2019s native cryptocurrency Ether by about 95%. Under Proof-of-Work, the network paid out around 13,000 Ether a year to miners for securing the network. Under Proof-of-Stake, this figure dropped to 1,600 Ether annually.\n\nAccording to Ashley, this \u201csolved one of the most important problems of all by ensuring that Ethereum can remain sustainable in the long term.\u201d If the pre-Merge issuance continued, the supply of Ether would have grown indefinitely, diluting the market and providing stakers little incentive to lock up their Ether to secure the network.\n\nThe reduced emissions, combined with a previous upgrade which enabled the Ethereum network to burn a portion of transaction fees, has made Ether disinflationary over the past year \u2014 even more so during times of high network activity when more transaction fees are burned.\n\nWith Ether burned from transactions outpacing new emissions since the Merge, projections from Ethereum data platform ultrasound.money show the Ether supply is likely to find equilibrium at around 73 million, if the current yearly usage continues.\n\nSince the Merge, the Ethereum network has burned 300,000 Ether, worth approximately $480 million.\n\nEther supply since the Merge. (ultrasound.money/ultrasound.money)\n\nDiversity issues\n\nDespite the improvements to Ethereum\u2019s energy consumption and economic structure brought by the Merge, it also exacerbated an existing problem.\n\nAccording to Ethereum core developer Preston Van Loon, the lack of Ethereum client diversity following the Merge has been \u201cprominently discussed\u201d in developer circles.\n\nEthereum clients are pieces of software that run Ethereum and communicate over the network with other clients.\n\nVan Loon explained how shortly after the Merge, the Prysm client became dominant and exceeded a super majority above two-thirds of the entire Ethereum network.\n\nNOW READ: Compound founder Robert Leshner says \u2018institutions aren\u2019t coming\u2019 to DeFi\n\n\u201cHaving a single client representing more than two-thirds of the network was a considerable risk,\u201d Van Loon said. \u201cThe client could have a bug that may become finalised with the remaining third in disagreement.\u201d\n\n\u201cDiversity has improved significantly, but there is still room to improve, especially on the execution layer where Go Ethereum is an overwhelmingly dominant client,\u201d Van Loon added.\n\nAn Ether staking surge\n\nThe Merge, and the subsequent April 2023 Shanghai upgrade, also drove billions worth of Ether into staking \u2014 particularly liquid staking services such as those offered by Lido and Rocket Pool.\n\n\u201cEthereum\u2019s transition to Proof-of-Stake can be broken down into two phases, the Merge in September of last year and the Shanghai upgrade back in April,\u201d Marin Tvrdi\u0107, a business development contributor at Lido DAO, told DL News.\n\n\u201cThe biggest impact of this transition is the rapid growth of the liquid staking economy,\u201d he said.\n\nSince the Merge, deposits to liquid staking protocols have more than doubled. According to DefiLlama data, over $19 billion worth of Ether is currently staked through liquid staking protocols, with the biggest protocol, Lido, accounting for 73% of the market.\n\nLido dominates liquid staking derivatives with a 73% share of the market.\n\nTvrdi\u0107 also noted that the Merge has allowed staking protocols to focus on expanding access to staking, helping to consolidate Ethereum\u2019s overall decentralisation.\n\nVan Loon also highlighted how the switch to Proof-of-Stake has helped open up Ether staking not just for liquid staking protocols, but also for individuals by lowering barriers to entry. Under Proof-of-Work, only entities with sufficient hash power or operating mining pools had the privilege of building new blocks and verifying transactions.\n\nNOW READ: Speed-trading giant borrows Coinbase playbook in slamming Gary Gensler after SEC lawsuit\n\nNow, he explained, anyone with ordinary hardware and 32 Ether can become a block producer.\n\n\u201cUltimately, the switch has made Ethereum a more decentralised network,\u201d he said.\n\nTim Craig is DL News\u2019 Edinburgh-based DeFi Correspondent.

        "content": "Hong Kong Legislative Council member Johnny Ng has invited Ethereum (ETH) co-founder Vitalik Buterin to the region so that he can gain insights into its approach to cryptocurrency projects, according to a Sept. 15 post on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nOn Sept. 14, Buterin, speaking at the Web3 Transitions Summit in Singapore, reportedly advised cryptocurrency projects to carefully assess the stability of Hong Kong\u2019s crypto regulatory environment, noting that the complex relationship between the city-state and Mainland China could pose challenges for ventures operating in the region.\n\nAccording to Buterin, he has difficulty judging if the current level of friendliness towards crypto could be sustained for a long time, considering China\u2019s open antagonism to the emerging industry.\n\nNg replies to Buterin.\n\nIn response, Ng attempted to address Buterin\u2019s concerns by emphasizing that the region cannot abruptly reverse its established policies because \u201cevery policy or legislation in Hong Kong will go through a period of discussion, including government policy writing, public consultation, discussions in multiple committees of the Legislative Council and the General Assembly.\u201d\n\nHe added:\n\n\u201cHong Kong\u2019s policies and laws will not change overnight. All relevant strategies and regulations have gone through major social consensus and complete procedures. Therefore, I can tell Mr. Vitalik that Hong Kong\u2019s policies are very stable.\u201d\n\nThe lawmaker also explained the relationship between the region and China, saying they practice a \u201cone country, two systems\u201d policy that allows Hong Kong to \u201cformulate policies on virtual assets and welcomes global compliance companies to develop\u201d under their jurisdiction. According to Ng, there are no \u201ccomplications\u201d in this unique relationship.\n\nHong Kong is actively drawing crypto firms, including CoinEx, OKX, and others, to its jurisdiction by establishing frameworks for their compliant operations.\n\nThe region\u2019s financial watchdog, Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), encouraged banking giants to accept crypto exchanges as clients and revealed intentions to implement a comprehensive regulatory framework for stablecoins."

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nHead of Research at CoinShares, James Butterfill, revealed some concerning news in the latest European digital asset manager report. With a $59 million outflow in the past week, tensions are high in the crypto market. While Bitcoin was the asset that had the greatest losses, it seems Ethereum is headed for more pain, while overall trading volumes dropped by 73% from the previous week.\n\nInstitutional Outflows Remain High\n\nWhile XRP saw inflows of $0.7 million, ETH outflows totalled $4.8 million, bringing the year\u2019s total to $108 million. Butterfill said the lacklustre performance made ETH \u201cthe least loved digital asset amongst ETP investors this year.\u201d\n\nETP, which stands for \u2018Exchange-Traded Product\u2019, includes a wide range of investment products designed to expose investors to various assets, such as ETFs, exchange-traded notes (ETN), and exchange-traded mutual funds (ETFM).\n\nThe recent FTX scare about a massive sell-off of tokens, which could potentially trigger larger price drops, further causes concerns. FTX lawyers asked the court to allow the liquidation of $3.4 billion in crypto assets. The Delaware Bankruptcy Court approved on September 13, but the proposal would only allow for an initial release of $100 million in funds per week. This would not likely trigger massive price movements as some initially feared.\n\nCould ETH Slide Below the Crucial $1,000 Mark?\n\nIn a report named \u2018The Altcoin Crash is Coming\u2019, research platform Matrixport suggests a grim outlook for Ethereum. It said: \u201cA decline below $1,500 could bring back the idea that Ether could decline to $1,000 \u2014 a level that would appear justified based on the revenue projection from the Ethereum ecosystem.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the upside, Cathie Wood\u2019s Ark Invest recently applied for Spot Ethereum ETF. While it remains to be seen if this gets approval, given the many Spot Bitcoin ETFs currently in limbo, it sends an overall bullish signal that the second-largest cryptocurrency is still popular. As per CoinMarketCap, Ethereum is currently trading at $1619, down about 13.85% month-on-month.\n\nSource: CoinMarketCap\n\nThe report by Matrixport also highlights that the current ETH price is below the 50-day moving average, which is considered a bearish signal. Of course, ETH is not the only cryptocurrency experiencing losses; the overall market is trending downward with few exceptions. This makes ETH losses less about Ethereum\u2019s fundamentals and more about overall market sentiment."

        "title": "What is the Future of Ethereum? We Analyze its Roadmap - Altcoin Buzz",
        "content": "The Ethereum network, which supports a sizable ecosystem of decentralized applications (dapps), has advanced significantly over the last couple of years.\n\nEthereum has been the pioneering force behind smart contracts, leading to ground-breaking innovations including DeFi), NFTs, the metaverse, and blockchain gaming. However, the rise in Ethereum\u2019s popularity led to problems such as high costs, high energy consumption, and scalability. In this article, we\u2019ll analyze Ethereum\u2019s Roadmap to know how the future will be for this important blockchain.\n\nA Journey of Upgrades\n\nEthereum\u2019s developers devised a grand plan to address these problems. They called that plan \u201cEthereum 2.0,\u201d which is a set of upgrades on the network. With these improvements, the network should become more resilient, scalable, safe, and effective for practical applications.\n\nSo, the changes in Ethereum 2.0 are intended to improve the performance of the Ethereum network in a number of areas. The adventure started in December 2020 with the Beacon Chain\u2019s launch. This update in particular introduced the concept of the Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism to the network.\n\nEthereum\u2019s developers didn\u2019t stop there. They proceeded with other enhancements. Next on their list were the Berlin and London upgrades, which came in 2021. These upgrades optimized gas fees and introduced Ethereum Improvement Proposal 1559 (EIP-1559).\n\n\ud83d\udfe0 The merge Ethereum merge merged the proof-of-stake testnet with the proof-of-work mainnet, converting the latter to PoS. The merge finished on 15 September 2022. And the last merge-related upgrade (Shanghai-Capella) concluded last week. 2/ https://t.co/N1RjRgJj4T \u2014 satvik.shm \u039e (@7vik_writes) April 17, 2023\n\nEthereum developers took things a notch higher in 2022 with the launch of the Gray Glacier, Bellatrix, and Paris upgrades\u2014collectively referred to as \u201cThe Merge\u201d. These effectively converted Ethereum from Proof of Work (PoW) to Proof of Stake (PoS), where validators who staked ETH took over from miners as the source of blocks. Here are some of the benefits of the merger:\n\nMinimized energy consumption.\n\nDecreased the net issuance of ETH.\n\nReduced block times (13.3s \u2192 12s).\n\nIt led to stronger finality.\n\nIntroduced yield.\n\nDistributed Validator Technology(DVT). This resulted in better decentralization.\n\nImproved security.\n\nCurious about what lies ahead for #Ethereum? In our latest #Binance Research report, we take a closer look at Ethereum's roadmap, highlighting some of the key phases and upgrades worth keeping an eye on. Read about them here \u2b07\ufe0fhttps://t.co/WNXegI1bhE \u2014 Binance Research (@BinanceResearch) September 4, 2023\n\nThe Shanghai Upgrade.\n\nThe Shanghai Upgrade in April 2023 was the most recent Ethereum update. This upgrade, which also included EIP-4895, enabled ETH validators to unlock their network-staked ETH. It improved ETH liquidity since it enabled people to access staked ETH and related rewards.\n\nNow let\u2019s look at what Ethereum\u2019s future looks like based on its roadmap.\n\nThe Surge\n\nThe surge intends to improve the Ethereum network\u2019s scalability and decentralization. It features the implementation of EIP-4944, also known as Proto Danksharding. This will enable a new format of transaction via \u201cdata blobs\u201d that can be seamlessly integrated into nodes and their processes.\n\n\ud83d\udfe0 The surge The Ethereum surge is a set of upgrades that will increase the speed of the blockchain and its L2 counterparts. This increase in scalability would solve the blockchain trilemma without compensating for network security. The main upgrade here will be sharding: 3/ https://t.co/HtkGxjCdOt \u2014 satvik.shm \u039e (@7vik_writes) April 17, 2023\n\nThe sharding method used by Ethereum divides transactions into numerous smaller batches, scaling the network horizontally, a process that is significantly simpler than enhancing a single machine.\n\nFor instance, it is more effective for 20 validators to validate five batches of 20 transactions each than it is for 100 validators to validate 1,000 transactions one at a time. Additionally, EIP-4844 establishes the foundation for transactions based on roll-up technology as well as resources that make it easier to create zero-knowledge scaling solutions. This phase will increase the scalability of the Ethereum network from 15 TPS to 100,000 TPS.\n\nThe Scrouge\n\nThe Scrouge upgrade seeks to prioritize decentralization and address protocol risks related to Maximum Extractable Value (MEV). It is the highest possible value that can be obtained from manipulating the order of transactions in a block above the recognized gas fees and block reward.\n\nMany in #DePin space have suggested the future will be nodes run from mob devices. @VitalikButerin advocating stateless clients to unlock this. End result is more decentralisation. This is what the future internet looks like and why we are building #Web3https://t.co/0AseX6hcEg \u2014 marklittle.eth (@mark_little2) September 6, 2023\n\nOne of the ways to tackle this MEV issue is through the implementation of PBS (Proposer Builder Separation). PBS addresses the centralization risk posed by MEV and also offers an anti-censorship solution\n\nThe Verge\n\nAccording to Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin, the Verge will reduce the amount of data validators store on their machines. It will accomplish this by introducing Verkle trees. Buterin claims this is an improvement over Merkle proofs that enables substantially reduced proof sizes.\n\n\ud83d\udcf1\ud83d\ude80 Vitalik Buterin believes that future upgrades to Ethereum could allow full nodes to run on mobile devices, making the network more decentralized. #Ethereum #VitalikButerin #mobile #decentralization \u2014 CubeCoin | News (@CubeCoinCrypto) September 7, 2023\n\nThe Verkle trees are one component of a larger roadmap for making Ethereum stateless, a difficult idea that is still being developed. In simple terms, the proposal seeks to establish stateless clients, in which validating nodes don\u2019t need to store state data before block verification.\n\nThe Purge\n\nThe Purge upgrade contains a number of improvements to get rid of outdated network history and gradually clean up the network. It will minimize Ethereum\u2019s technical debt and historical data storage requirements. This will reduce the storage requirements for node operators.\n\nThe Purge also plans to introduce history expiration (EIP-4444), which will allow some node operators to skip storing some of the data from earlier blocks. Validators will simply store one year\u2019s worth of history rather than the entire blockchain\u2019s history.\n\nEIP-4444 also aims to remove excessive or unneeded functions from the Ethereum Virtual Machine, optimize the protocol, minimize technical complexity, and lower the cost of participating in the network. The major objective is to reduce network traffic and increase transaction speed.\n\nThe Splurge\n\nThe Splurge upgrade, which is the final stage, is intended to solve all outstanding issues in the network. This upgrade will only be used for research and to guarantee the proper execution and implementation of previous processes.\n\nvery concerned about what will happen after the Ethereum Merge, Surge, and Verge because then we're just left with rhymes like the Purge, Scourge, or Dirge pic.twitter.com/z2INpfQ9UN \u2014 Molly White (@molly0xFFF) September 17, 2022\n\nThe phases contained in Ethereum\u2019s roadmap will improve the network once they each go live. They will also lead to more liquidity and earning opportunities. However, these upgrades could possibly affect the price of ETH. But we can\u2019t say in what direction that will happen. Instead, it will depend on several factors, including market trends.\n\n\u2013 For more cryptocurrency news, check out the Altcoin Buzz YouTube channel.\n\n\u2013 Unlock the key to managing your crypto portfolio like a PRO!

As validators process transactions and add new blocks to the blockchain, they earn rewards.\n\nThough various metrics signal clear growth in the segment, hurdles such as regulatory uncertainty and the macroeconomic environment are keeping many institutions on the sidelines, industry participants told Blockworks.\n\nThe number of Ethereum network validators has increased from roughly 400,000 to nearly 800,000 since the so-called Merge, according to data from staking company Attestant.\n\nAbout 210,000 of those validators were added to the network after the Shapella upgrade in April \u2014 an event that allowed stakers with locked-up ether to retrieve their deposits from the network\u2019s smart contract.\n\nRead more: Shapella upgrade could reignite institutional interest in blockchain\n\nThere was roughly 29.4 million ETH deposited in the Beacon smart contract, Compass Point Research & Trading analysts said in a Sept. 8 research note. This accounts for nearly a quarter of ether\u2019s circulating supply.\n\nLido has the largest percentage of staked ETH, with a roughly 29% share, the data shows. Centralized exchanges hold 20% of staked ether, with Coinbase accounting for about half of that.\n\nThe percentage of ETH supply that is staked could move to between 30% and 40%, Compass Point analysts added, noting that is more in line with other proof-of-stake chains.\n\nBen Dean, director of digital assets at WisdomTree in Europe, told Blockworks in the days leading up to the Merge that Ethereum\u2019s switch to proof-of-stake \u201ccompletely changes the investment case for ether.\u201d\n\nA February survey by Nickel Digital Asset Management found that 77% of institutions believed the Merge would increase ether adoption. Roughly 40% of respondents said they expected ETH\u2019s price to be at least $2,000 by the end of 2023.\n\nEther\u2019s price was about $1,620 at 9 am ET on Friday \u2014 up 35% year to date but down 11% in the last month.\n\nHurdles in the way of broader adoption\n\nMore than 40% of the institutions that hold ether with Anchorage Digital also stake the ETH on its crypto platform, according to a company spokesperson. Anchorage has seen the amount of ETH staked on its platform increase by four times since the end of 2022.\n\nBut sweeping adoption remains to be seen, as demand for staking ETH remains the highest among crypto funds, Anchorage Digital co-founder Diogo M\u00f3nica said.\n\n\u201cMany crypto-native players approach Ethereum with a long-term horizon, so actively participating by staking is the next logical step,\u201d he told Blockworks in an email.\n\nSome venture capital funds \u2014 especially those with redemption requirements \u2014 do not stake all of their ETH due to liquidity concerns, M\u00f3nica added. Some corporations that hold ether are waiting for more tax guidance before fully jumping into staking, he noted.\n\n\u201cInstitutions are also watching the continued evolution of the Ethereum ecosystem,\u201d M\u00f3nica explained. \u201cAll eyes are on sharding as the next major upgrade, which would significantly increase the scalability of the network.\u201d\n\nRegulatory uncertainty is another hurdle, said Brian Mosoff, CEO of Ether Capital.\n\nWhile Ether Capital is actively staking 97% of its treasury, they are in the clear minority.\n\nThe bulk of post-Merge ether adoption is coming from retail investors through exchanges and individual at-home stakers, rather than institutions, Mosoff added.\n\n\u201cInfrastructure in the crypto space has improved, but there is still a need for regulatory clarification, especially in the United States,\u201d he said. \u201cQuestions remain about how these services should be offered and whether staking providers will require specific registrations.\u201d\n\nCrypto exchange Bitstamp is set to end ether staking for US customers later this month, citing \u201ccurrent regulatory dynamics\u201d in the country.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission targeted the staking services of Coinbase and Binance in June lawsuits against the companies. Kraken stopped its staking services in February as part of a settlement with the regulator.\n\nAside from regulatory uncertainty, another factor affecting ETH staking demand is the macroeconomic environment, Mosoff noted. The rise in interest rates has led some traditional finance investors to consider safer or more familiar investments like Treasury bills, he added.\n\n\u201cMainstream education is still necessary to help people understand that Ethereum exposure should not be solely motivated by yield,\u201d Mosoff said. \u201cThose interested in staking yield must first recognize the importance of having ETH exposure in their portfolio as a long-term growth asset before appreciating the benefits of a 3% to 5% risk-free rate.\u201d\n\nDespite some of the current barriers around demand, staking highlights ether\u2019s \u201cproductivity as an asset,\u201d he noted.\n\nRead more: Vitalik Buterin previews a future built on Ethereum\n\n\u201cWill we see more people be able to participate in sequencing and security on layer-2?\u201d Mosoff said. \u201cWhat about EigenLayer providing security for specific apps or other chains?\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cWe are only beginning to scratch the surface of a post-Merge world.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "Through an examination of Ether\u2019s (ETH) on-chain activity, market intelligence platform Santiment has published a report indicating that the count of daily active Ether addresses experienced a notable increase, reaching around 1,089,893 on Sept. 13.\n\nThis recent upsurge represents the second-highest number of daily active addresses ever recorded in Ethereum\u2019s history. The highest count was registered on Dec. 9, 2022, aligning with Ether\u2019s reevaluation following its losses from the post-2021 bear market.\n\nAs a result, analysts at Santiment suggest that the Ether market may experience increased volatility, potentially leading to a recovery. Additionally, this uptick in on-chain activity indicates a growing demand for the underlying asset.\n\nThe #Ethereum network just saw 1,089,893 unique wallets acting as a sender or receiver of $ETH on Wednesday, the 2nd highest amount in the asset's 8+ year history. This historic anomaly could be the capitulation signal needed for prices to rebound. https://t.co/JF0g8vvBWs pic.twitter.com/1dRnPCjxcA \u2014 Santiment (@santimentfeed) September 14, 2023\n\nEthereum, whose native crypto, ETH, is the second-largest by market capitalization, is presently encountering immediate market instability after a recent price decline that pushed it below the $1,700 threshold. Nevertheless, Ethereum maintains its position in the decentralized finance ecosystem and smart contract arena, securing around $20 billion in total value locked.\n\nEthereum remains attractive to institutional investors, as seen in the growing interest in spot exchange-traded funds. Additionally, the Ethereum network holds a central role in numerous blockchains due to its Ethereum Virtual Machine network. As a result, Ethereum\u2019s prospects seem largely optimistic, supported by the network\u2019s significant valuation, liquidity and strong trading activity.\n\nWhen it comes to analyzing Ether\u2019s price, it\u2019s worth noting that, despite being a prominent altcoin with unique fundamentals, ETH\u2019s price movement is still considerably impacted by Bitcoin (BTC). Throughout history, September, particularly before a halving event, has been recognized as a bearish period for the cryptocurrency market.\n\nRelated: Nasdaq\u2019s Hashdex mixed Ether ETF filing joins crypto ETF race\n\nThis might suggest that Ether\u2019s price will continue its decline in the upcoming weeks, potentially nearing the next support level at approximately $1,500. In addition, the cryptocurrency is encountering significant selling pressure as both weekly and daily death crosses form between the 50- and 200-day moving averages.\n\nCollect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space.\n\nMagazine: Ethereum is \u2018woefully undervalued\u2019 but growing more powerful: DeFi Dad, Hall of Flame"

        "content": "Criticisms aimed at the perceived centralization of Ether (ETH) staking pools may finally be quelled by an alternative staking infrastructure that aims to improve private key security and reduce validator downtimes and slashing penalties.\n\nSpeaking exclusively to Cointelegraph, SSV.network founder Alon Muroch outlined how the platform\u2019s distributed validator technology (DVT), developed in partnership with the Ethereum Foundation, can help decentralize ETH staking pools and validators.\n\nSSV.network launched its public mainnet with more than 10 staking decentralized applications deploying their platforms on the network on Sept. 14. DVT is intended to decentralize the current landscape of staking providers, which is currently dominated by a handful of ETH staking pools that command a significant share of ETH locked in the Eth2 staking contract.\n\nRelated: SSV launches $50M ecosystem fund to support ETH staking tech\n\nAccording to Muroch, the technology is an approach to validator security that spreads out key management and signing responsibilities across multiple parties, reducing single points of failure and increasing validator resiliency.\n\nThe technology splits a private key used to secure a validator across a cluster of computers. This increases security and allows for some nodes of a validator cluster to go offline, which also reduces single points of failure from the network and makes validator sets more robust.\n\n\u201cBy splitting keyshares between a diverse set of nodes in a cluster, validators become much more decentralized. Staking pools that use DVT can decentralize their own infrastructure or delegate it to SSV.network node operators.\u201d\n\nData from blockchain analytics firm Nansen shows that Lido Finance accounts for 32% of ETH locked in the Beacon Chain deposit contract. ETH staking pools offered by Coinbase (8%) and Binance (4%) also command a significant share of staked ETH.\n\nAn overview of the largest ETH staking entities. Source: Nansen Eth2 deposit contract\n\nAs SVV noted in an announcement marking the mainnet launch, centralized exchanges such as Coinbase, Binance and Kraken hold around 18% of the total staked ETH, while liquid-taking pools like Lido, RocketPool, Stader and Stakewise account for over 36% of the total market share.\n\nLiquid staking pools became hugely popular in the build-up to Ethereum\u2019s anticipated Shanghai upgrade in July 2023. The event introduced the ability for Ethereum users to withdraw staked ETH from the Beacon contract for the first time.\n\nSSV intends to offer alternative liquid and centralized staking pools, which it describes as \u201cfundamentally centralized and custodial\u201d. Muroch added that SSV can significantly increase validator private key security and maximize rewards through high performance and a fault-tolerant setup that stops slashing penalties for offline validators.\n\nSSV.network grabbed headlines in January 2023 when it launched a $50 million ecosystem fund to support other projects developing using DVT. The technology was previously highlighted as an important aspect of Ethereum\u2019s scaling roadmap laid out by co-founder Vitalik Buterin in December 2021.\n\nMagazine: Are DAOs overhyped and unworkable?

However, the network failed to launch due to a misconfiguration and will require a relaunch.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nSunsetting a blockchain is a typical process.

The token isn\u2019t meant to have real-world value and exists so developers can pay gas fees when testing their products.\n\nBut with its limited supply, individual wallets began hoarding the token. This made it more difficult for developers to test their applications on the testnet.\n\nHole\u0161ky is designed to be much larger than Goerli, allowing validators to test in a more realistic on-chain environment and resolve the goETH supply issues.\n\nAccording to Parithosh Jayanthi, a developer at the Ethereum Foundation, Hole\u0161ky will be able to handle a client size three times larger than that of Ethereum mainnet today.\n\n\u201cWe need to launch Holesky with such a large number of validators in order to ensure we can test the limits of the beaconchain in a safe manner,\u201d Jayanthi tweeted.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "Ethereum Surges Ahead Of Bitcoin In Active Addresses, What Does This Mean? - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Since its inception, Ethereum has continuously been compared to Bitcoin with the former being hailed as a better option to the latter in some cases. As the years have flown by, the competition has gotten even fiercer, especially with ETH growing rapidly. Eventually, Ethereum seems to be catching up with Bitcoin, especially in terms of active addresses.\n\nEthereum Active Addresses Surpass Bitcoin\n\nOn Thursday, September 14, on-chain data tracker Santiment revealed a surprising update on the fierce rivalry between Bitcoin and Ethereum. In the X post, the tracker revealed that the number of unique addresses that were transaction on the network had reached its second-highest daily figure of all time.\n\nWhile this is significant on the part of the blockchain alone, it is also significant in terms of the competition between the two largest assets in the space. To put this in perspective, the 1,089,893 figure reported by Santiment puts Ethereum ahead of Bitcoin in terms of this metric alone.\n\nThe last time that the daily unique active addresses on the network hit its new all-time high was back in December 2022. So it has been almost a year since the metric was this high, suggesting a unique driving factor behind it.\n\nThis report is also in line with the report from Artemis Terminal that shows that Ethereum was right in front of Bitcoin in terms of daily active addresses.\n\nETH active addresses surpass BTC on Wednesday | Source: Artemis Terminal\n\nArtemis reports that on September 13, Ethereum saw a total of 1.03 million daily addresses compared to Bitcoin\u2019s 743,800 addresses in the same time period. However, this figure has since retracted and Bitcoin has pulled in front of Ethereum once more as of September 14.\n\nWhat Does This Mean?\n\nWhile Ethereum\u2019s surge on Wednesday was impressive, it does not mean much since the network has been unable to sustain the growth. Also, the surge could be easily explained by the rise in the popularity of the Friend.Tech decentralized finance social media platform based on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nFriend.Tech had seemingly come back from the death to reach a new all-time high in its number of daily users. Since an ETH address is required to participate in the platform, it is no surprise there was an uptick in the number of ETH addresses active on the network.\n\nThe spike in the number of daily active addresses also seems to have had little impact on the price of the cryptocurrency itself. ETH\u2019s price is still struggling to hold above $1,600, with small gains of 0.35% in the last day and losses of 1.15% in the last week.\n\nETH price still holding above $1,600 | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nFollow Best Owie on Twitter for market insights, updates, and the occasional funny tweet\u2026 Featured image from CBS News, chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "Layer 2 solution Arbitrum drives Ethereum ecosystem's growth, suggests Pantera Capital - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "According to the latest Pantera Capital Blockchain Letter, the crypto market may finally turn a corner after a brutal bear market in 2022, and leading Ethereum layer 2 solution Arbitrum is emerging as one of the biggest beneficiaries.\n\nAs Pantera\u2019s letter illustrates,\n\n\u201cArbitrum is a massive share taker within the Ethereum ecosystem, and Ethereum, in turn, has itself been a massive share taker across all of crypto.\u201d\n\nFurthering this point, Pantera reports that Arbitrum has single-handedly fueled 100% of the incremental growth in Ethereum\u2019s transaction volume this year, even as other layer 2 solutions and competitors stayed largely stagnant.\n\nPantera\u2019s fundamentals-based investing.\n\nPrincipally focusing on fundamentals-based investing, Pantera acknowledges the significant bottlenecks Ethereum has grappled with due to its scalability constraints. Reflecting on Ethereum\u2019s predicament, the letter indicates that layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum are surfacing as preferred solutions, promising faster and cheaper transactions while retaining Ethereum\u2019s robust security measures and wide-ranging application support.\n\nDrawing from Pantera\u2019s analysis, Arbitrum\u2019s critical edge lies in its capacity to process transactions that are 40x faster and 20x cheaper than the base Ethereum layer. This superiority has propelled Arbitrum to considerable growth, both in absolute terms and in contrast to its peers, making it one of the fastest-expanding layer 2 solutions on Ethereum and enabling it to seize a substantial proportion of Ethereum\u2019s transaction market share over the past year.\n\nPantera notes that Arbitrum has consistently grown in transaction volume despite a bearish trend across the crypto market this year. Citing available data, Pantera\u2019s letter reveals that Arbitrum has been instrumental in the Ethereum ecosystem\u2019s growth this year, contributing to 100% of its incremental growth.\n\nArbitrum growth and expanding user base.\n\nThe letter further explores the driving factors behind Arbitrum\u2019s growth, spotlighting its expanding user base and the subsequent rise in developers keen to build new applications on its platform. This virtuous upward spiral, as Pantera notes, is critical to Arbitrum\u2019s continued evolution. However, the firm underscores that the pivotal concern for fundamental value investors resides in the potential revenue from this increasing activity.\n\nAmplifying its distinctiveness in the market, Arbitrum stands out as a profitable protocol in Pantera Capital\u2019s analysis. The platform generates revenue by amassing transaction fees on its network, assembling these transactions into larger bundles, and consigning them to the Ethereum base layer. This mechanism implies a gross profit of about 10 cents per transaction for Arbitrum.\n\nWith a product that has found a market fit and a viable unit economics model, Pantera Capital deems Arbitrum\u2019s valuation as defensible. Per Pantera\u2019s letter, the protocol has consistently grown quarter-over-quarter since its launch, with transactions nearing 90 million per quarter and revenue hitting $23 million in Q2. The gross profit for the same period approached nearly $5 million, equivalent to an annualized $20 million.\n\nThe letter illustrates that Arbitrum, with about 2.5 million monthly average users and roughly 350 million transactions yearly, is nearly a $100 million annual revenue business, generating around $50 million of standardized gross profit.\n\nArbitrum market capitalization.\n\nRegarding market capitalization, Arbitrum currently boasts a $5 billion figure on an issued shares basis. This represents an appealing prospect to Pantera, particularly when compared to similar market capitalizations of other layer 1 and layer 2 protocols, given Arbitrum\u2019s superior usage, revenue, and profit statistics.\n\nFrom a growth and valuation perspective, the letter suggests Arbitrum could potentially scale to a transaction run rate of over 1 billion at 10 cents profit per transaction over the next year. This projection implies about a hundred million in earnings and, at a $5 billion market capitalization, infers a valuation of roughly 50 times forward earnings. Despite appearing expensive on an absolute basis, Pantera considers this valuation reasonable for an asset still growing in the triple digits.\n\nPantera Capital\u2019s Blockchain Letter presents Arbitrum as a rapidly evolving protocol that has found a product-market fit, demonstrates profitability, and trades at a reasonable valuation relative to its growth, other crypto assets, and traditional financial assets."

        "title": "3 key Ether price metrics suggest that ETH is gearing up for volatility - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Ether\u2019s price has been dealing with some strong headwinds, and on Sept. 11, the price of the altcoin endured a critical test when it plunged to the $1,530 support level. In the days that followed, Ether (ETH) managed to stage an impressive recovery by surging 6%. This resurgence may signal a pivotal moment, following a month that had seen ETH endure losses of 16%.\n\nEven with the somewhat swift recovery, Ether\u2019s price performance raises questions among investors about whether it has the potential to climb back to $1,850, and ETH derivatives and network activity might hold the key to this puzzle.\n\nEther/USD price index, 1-day. Source: TradingView\n\nMacroeconomic factors have played a significant role in mitigating investor pessimism, given that inflation in the United States accelerated for the second consecutive month, reaching 3.7%, according to the most recent Consumer Price Index report. Such data reinforces the belief that the U.S. government\u2019s debt will continue to surge, compelling the Treasury to offer higher yields.\n\nScarce assets are poised to benefit from the inflationary pressure and the expansive monetary policies aimed at bridging the budget deficit. However, the cryptocurrency sector is grappling with its own set of challenges.\n\nRegulatory uncertainty and high network fees limit investors\u2019 appetite\n\nThere\u2019s the looming possibility of Binance facing indictment by the U.S. Department of Justice. Furthermore, Binance.US has found itself entangled in legal battles with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, leading to layoffs and top executives departing from the company.\n\nBesides the regulatory hurdles faced by cryptocurrencies, the Ethereum network has witnessed a notable decline in its smart contract activity, which is at the core of its original purpose. The network still grapples with persistently high average fees, hovering above the $3 mark.\n\nEthereum network DApps rank by active addresses. Source: DappRadar\n\nOver the past 30 days, the top Ethereum decentralized applications (DApps) have seen an average 26% decrease in the number of active addresses. An exception to this trend is the Lido liquid staking project, which saw a 7% increase in its total value locked (TVL) in ETH terms during the same period. It\u2019s worth mentioning that Lido\u2019s success has been met with criticism due to the project\u2019s dominance, accounting for a substantial 72% of all staked ETH.\n\nVitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum, has acknowledged the need for Ethereum to become more accessible for everyday people to run nodes in order to maintain decentralization in the long term. However, Buterin does not anticipate a viable solution to this challenge within the next decade. Consequently, investors have legitimate concerns about centralization, including the influence of services like Lido.\n\nETH futures and options show reduced interest from leveraged longs\n\nA look at derivatives metrics will better explain how Ether\u2019s professional traders are positioned in the current market conditions. Ether monthly futures typically trade at a 5 to 10% annualized premium \u2014 a situation known as contango, which is not unique to crypto markets.\n\nEther 2-month futures annualized premium. Source: Laevitas\n\nThe premium for Ether futures hit its lowest point in three weeks, standing at 2.2%, indicating a lack of demand for leveraged long positions. Interestingly, not even the 6% gain following the retest of the $1,530 support level on Sept. 11 managed to push ETH futures into the 5% neutral threshold.\n\nOne should look at the options markets to better gauge market sentiment, as the 25% delta skew can confirm whether professional traders are leaning bearish. In short, if traders expect a drop in Ether\u2019s price, the skew metric will rise above 7%, while periods of excitement typically have a -7% skew.\n\nEther 30-day options 25% delta skew. Source: Laevitas\n\nOn Sept. 14, the Ether 25% delta skew indicator briefly shifted to a bullish stance. This shift was driven by put (sell) options trading at an 8% discount compared to similar call (buy) options. However, this sentiment waned on Sept. 15, with both call and put options trading at a similar premium. Essentially, Ether derivatives traders are displaying reduced interest in leveraged long positions, despite the successful defense of the $1,530 price level.\n\nOn one hand, Ether has potential catalysts, including requests for a spot ETH exchange-traded fund and macroeconomic factors driven by inflationary pressure. However, the dwindling use of DApps and ongoing regulatory uncertainties create a fertile ground for FUD \u2014 fear, uncertainty and doubt. This is likely to continue exerting downward pressure on Ether\u2019s price, making a rally to $1,850 in the short to medium term appear unlikely.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

        "content": "Ethereum developers launched a new testnet on Sept. 15. Called \u201cHole\u0161ky,\u201d the network is expected to be used for staking, infrastructure and protocol development, according to its developer documents. Sepolia will remain the dominant network for application development.\n\nAn initial supply of 1.6 billion Hole\u0161ky testnet Ether (HETH) will be allocated to validators on Hole\u0161ky\u2019s launch day to bootstrap the network into operation, according to Ethereum developer Tim Beiko. This represents 10 times the amount of Ether (ETH) present on mainnet. Beiko stated that developers were comfortable with producing this amount because \u201cdevnets [are] regularly using 10B supply.\u201d\n\nPreviously, the Goerli testnet was used to test new staking, infrastructure and protocol developments. Goerli is the oldest Ethereum testnet in operation, having been launched in 2018. In October, protocol developers began complaining that Goerli had too low of a supply of Goerli ETH to adequately handle testing needs. Given its large initial supply of HETH, Hole\u0161ky is expected to help alleviate this problem.\n\nRelated: Ethereum Merge anniversary \u2014 99% energy drop but centralization fears linger\n\nSince Sepolia was launched in 2021, the Ethereum team has been urging application developers to move from Goerli to Sepolia, leaving only protocol developers remaining on the old network prior to the launch of Hole\u0161ky. The team plans to deprecate Goerli in January 2024. After deprecation, Goerli will be maintained for another year, then shut down entirely, according to its documentation.\n\nHole\u0161ky could see a lot of use, as Ethereum devs have an ambitious roadmap ahead of them. They intend to implement proto-danksharding, danksharding and other features they believe will reduce fees, as well as features like Verkle trees, which are intended to make running a node less expensive. Each of these features will need to be trialed on a testnet before being implemented on mainnet."

        "content": "Data from the Artemis Terminal reveals that Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest blockchain network by market capitalization, has surpassed Bitcoin (BTC) in terms of daily active addresses.\n\nAccording to the latest statistics, Ethereum boasts 1.03 million daily active addresses, while Bitcoin stands at 743,800.\n\nSantiment\u2019s Insights into Ethereum\u2019s On-Chain Activity\n\nAccording to a report by market intelligence platform Santiment, Ethereum\u2019s on-chain activity analysis reveals a surge in daily active addresses for Ether.\n\nOn Sept. 13, the number of daily active addresses reached approximately 1,089,893. Notably, this surge represents the second-highest daily active address count in Ethereum\u2019s history, with the highest count recorded on Dec. 9, 2022, coinciding with Ether\u2019s retest of its post-2021 bear market losses.\n\nData from Artemis Terminal also indicates that Ethereum now has more daily active addresses than Bitcoin, boasting 1.03 million daily active addresses, while the latter has 743,800.\n\nData from Etherscan reveals that the number of daily transactions on the Ethereum network has recorded a new all-time high, with Sept. 13 seeing 1,627,860 transactions, reflecting a growing interest and optimism. The previous peak was recorded on Sept. 17, 2020, reaching about 1,406,000.\n\nAnalysts at Santiment suggest that this increase in on-chain activity could pave the way for enhanced market volatility and potentially a recovery in the Ether market. Despite Ethereum\u2019s recent market instability, which pushed its price below the $1,700 threshold, the cryptocurrency remains an important player in the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem and the smart contract space, boasting approximately $20 billion in total value locked.\n\nEthereum Price Analysis\n\nWhile Ethereum maintains its status as a major altcoin with unique fundamentals, it remains significantly influenced by Bitcoin\u2019s price movements. Historically, September, particularly before Bitcoin halving events, has been identified as a bearish month for the cryptocurrency market.\n\nAs a result, Ethereum\u2019s price is expected to continue its descent in the upcoming weeks, possibly approaching the next support level of around $1.5k. Additionally, the digital asset faces substantial selling pressure due to the occurrence of weekly and daily death crosses between the 50 and 200 Moving Averages (MA)."

        "content": "Ethereum is trading in the $1,600 range, and the asset is finding it hard to gather momentum to breach the $2,000 mark. ETH has fluctuated between the $1,500 and $2,000 mark in 2023. The world\u2019s second-biggest cryptocurrency is treading cautiously in the indices and is down nearly 15% since last month.\n\nHowever, leading cryptocurrency analyst Nicholas Merten warned that Ethereum could crash and fall below the $1,000 mark. According to his prediction, ETH could trade in three digits on the charts and plummet to $890 levels.\n\nAlso Read: XRP Could Reach $10,000 For Its Role in CBDCs, Predicts Analyst\n\nEthereum: ETH Could Be Poised For a Crash & Trade Below $1,000, Predicts Analyst\n\nSource: CNN\n\nMerten explained to his half-million subscribers on YouTube that Ethereum had more than a year to break out of an ascending triangle pattern. He said that ETH\u2019s inability to climb above its resistance in the bullish formation makes the cryptocurrency weak and most likely headed for a crash.\n\nAlso Read: \u2018Solana a Solid Bet for the Next Bull Run\u2019 Predicts Analyst\n\nSource: YouTube DataDash / Nicholas Merten\n\n\u201cEthereum cannot show up to the plate.

But eventually, you\u2019ve got to be able to either break out to the upside or if you break through the ascending line of support to the downside, that spells bad news. That is a failed technical pattern,\u201d he said.\n\nThe analyst explained that things could get worse for ETH from here and might go below the $1,000 mark. \u201cSo if we are not going to catch a bid here, then that means we\u2019re probably going to revisit $1,100. The previous support range, or come down to $890 like we were back here in June.\u201d\n\nAlso Read: Dogecoin: How Much Could You Earn if You Invested $1,000 5 Years Ago?\n\nAt press time, Ethereum was trading at $1,616 and was up 1.7% in the 24-hour day trade.

        "content": "A closely followed crypto trader says that one mid-cap altcoin is primed for a significant rally in price.\n\nPseudonymous trader Altcoin Sherpa tells his 196,300 followers on the social media platform X that blockchain oracle Chainlink (LINK) will likely break out of a months-long trading range in the next bull market cycle.\n\n\u201cLINK: 500 days of accumulation/chop/ranging for one of the best crypto projects that is the core infrastructure for thousands of projects.

A retest would actually be healthy too.\u201d\n\nLooking at his chart, the trader suggests Bitcoin is likely to break out to $26,700 and then retest the $26,300 level before continuing a rally to $28,000 by September 18th.\n\nBitcoin is trading for $26,666 at time of writing, up 1.3% in the last 24 hours.\n\nThe trader also weighs in on the scaling solution Polygon (MATIC).

        "content": "Transactions on the blockchain spiked as ETH\u2019s trading volume fell.\n\nNetwork growth also decreased as ETH held on to the $1,600 region.\n\nTen months after FTX collapsed, the exchange was on the lips of many players in the market again, as the court approved the liquidation of a sizable part of its assets. This reappearance ensured that the social volume and dominance around FTX jumped.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-2024\n\nETH takes second place\n\nHowever, according to Santiment, conversations surrounding FTX were not the only metric that rose. Interestingly, Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] on-chain activity also reached its second-highest ever in history on 14 September.\n\n? Conversations related to #FTX have hit a 5-month high after the exchange received approval to liquidate $3.4B in #crypto. #Ethereum, in particular, has seen odd #onchain activity since, including its 2nd largest activity day of all time yesterday. https://t.co/fFXYKicnMx pic.twitter.com/lnrqYW9hmy \u2014 Santiment (@santimentfeed) September 14, 2023\n\nAs the name suggests, on-chain activity refers to blockchain transactions that exist and have been verified by validators or miners. Although on-chain activity increased, the daily trading volume of ETH fell.\n\nAt press time, Santiment showed that Ethereum\u2019s trading volume was down to 4.73 billion. The trading volume is a different metric from on-chain volume, in the sense that the trading volume only considers transactions on exchanges.\n\nHowever, on-chain volume measures transactions involving external wallets. Therefore, the decrease in trading volume means that most of the activity on Ethereum occurred outside the shores of exchanges.\n\nTo buttress the on-chain activity point, active addresses was one metric to go to. Active addresses show the number of unique addresses involved in transactions daily. In tracking this data, this metric indicates the daily level of crowd interaction (or speculation) with a token.\n\nAs of 14 September, there were over 1.1 million active addresses on the Ethereum blockchain. This meant that a lot of distinct addresses participated in the transfer of assets over the network.\n\nOverlooked by the new entrants\n\nUnfortunately, the rise in active addresses could not save Ethereum\u2019s network growth from a notable fall. At the time of writing, the network growth was down to 27,500. Network growth measures the number of new addresses interacting with a network.\n\nTherefore, the chart above means new addresses were not the main players in the rise in on-chain activity. The decrease also means that user adoption of ETH was very low. For ETH, the increase in network activity did not do much to change its price action.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nAt press time, ETH\u2019s price was $1,627, similar to what it was at the beginning of the week. Also, it is also interesting to see that the FUD around ETH, being one of the cryptocurrencies listed for FTX liquidation, has failed to materialize into a price plunge.\n\nHowever, market participants may need to watch out for the timeframe FTX sets for liquidation. As it stood at press time, it was likely that ETH would continue to consolidate around $1,600."

Per Santiment analysts, this striking upsurge might be \"the capitulation signal needed for prices to rebound.\"\n\nThe most active day in Ethereum's (ETH) history was registered on Dec. 9, 2022, after the collapse of the FTX/Alameda ecosystem. It preceded a painful Ethereum (ETH) price decline to its multimonth low below $1,160. More than 1.42 million of Ethereum (ETH) accounts transacted in a record-breaking day.\n\nAs covered by U.Today previously, yesterday, a whopping amount of 640,000 Ethers (ETH) was withdrawn by users of centralized exchanges. Experts foresee volatility coming, as major Ethereum (ETH) activity metrics are rocketing.\n\nEthereum (ETH) close to having first \"inflationary\" week in a long time\n\nDespite this mini-rally, net activity on the Ethereum (ETH) network remains very low.

Meanwhile, only 11,762.10 Ethers (ETH) were destroyed in the corresponding period.\n\nAs such, Ethereum (ETH) lost its deflationary status that used to excite network enthusiasts. As of today, Ethereum (ETH) is subject to 0.167% per year inflation.\n\nEthereum (ETH) is changing hands at $1,619 on major spot platforms, up 1.3% in the last 24 hours."

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nEthereum, the world's second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has seen roughly $13 billion exit its market in the past few days, raising questions about investor sentiment toward the digital asset.\n\nThis comes amid a broader downturn for Ethereum, which has witnessed four consecutive weeks of declining prices.\n\nMajor shift in capital flows\n\nThe $13 billion outflow is backed by data from Glassnode's Market Realized Value Net Capital Change Breakdown metric. This metric offers a 30-day net position change for dominant assets on the cryptocurrency market, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) and stablecoins like Tether (USDT), USD Coin (USDC) and Binance USD (BUSD).\n\nThe Realized Cap, a key component of this metric, values each coin at its last transacted price. This offers a more accurate portrayal of capital flows by considering the liquidity of each coin and filtering out speculative off-chain trading. The sudden capital outflow could signal bearish sentiment among investors, prompting caution.\n\nBullish turnaround?\n\nHowever, there is another side to the story. Cryptocurrency analysts are paying close attention to a particular chart pattern on Ethereum \u2014 a hammer candle on its weekly chart.\n\nAs reported by U.Today, Jake Wujastyk, among other market watchers, points out that this formation typically appears at the end of a downtrend.\n\nA hammer candle is characterized by a short body and a long lower wick, suggesting that the asset's price may have found a market bottom and could be poised for an upward reversal.\n\nDespite the four-week slide, the hammer candle has injected a sense of optimism into the investor community, which is now discussing the possibility of a bullish turnaround."

Nearly one million ETH have been burned, compared to the 680,000 ETH issued.\n\nIt's been one year since the historic Ethereum merge.\n\n\n\nHere's a look at some of the key stats following the switch to proof-of-stake. pic.twitter.com/3bpNPuDQ5E \u2014 Binance (@binance) September 15, 2023\n\nAccording to the Ethereum analytics dashboard, Ultrasound Money, Ethereum has burned 980,377 ETH while minting 680,455 ETH. Consequently, supply has decreased by nearly 300,000 ETH since the switch to proof of stake.\n\nMore than 22% of ETH is now staked. Gas fees, although they were not impacted by the Merge upgrade, stood on average at 24.9 gwei.\n\nEthereum has slashed its energy requirements by 99.99%. The PoS mechanism burns a percentage of the transaction fees collected from users. Validators are paid a priority fee or a top that users add to the base to persuade validators to favor transactions. Meanwhile, the base fee is consumed, removing Ether from circulation.\n\nEthereum researcher \"Sassal ETH\" took to X to celebrate the milestones achieved by the largest smart contract network since the Merge. Aside from 980,000 ETH burned since the upgrade, 11.6 million ETH have been staked, and 362,000 new validators have been added.\n\nOn the other hand, ETH's price is only slightly up 1.9% yearly, according to CoinGecko data, and currently trades at $1,621.\n\nIn positive news, Ethereum is set to welcome its newest testnet, Holesky, as the Goerli testnet nears sunset."

She has 10+year experience in writing - accordingly she is avid journalists with a passion towards researching new insights coming into crypto erena.\n\nStory Highlights XRP has become Japan's preferred cryptocurrency, outpacing Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nThis is due to Ripple's strategic partnerships with Japanese companies, such as SBI Holdings.\n\nXRP is also gaining popularity in South Korea, where it often outperforms Bitcoin on major exchanges.\n\nA recent study conducted by the City University of Hong Kong has revealed that XRP has swiftly become Japan\u2019s preferred cryptocurrency, outpacing both Bitcoin and Ethereum. This digital currency, closely associated with Ripple, has not only showcased significant trading volumes but has also begun to redefine Japan\u2019s cryptocurrency landscape.\n\nXRP Takes the Lead!\n\nIn February, a significant shift occurred in Japan\u2019s crypto market, XRP emerged as the frontrunner, boasting an impre\u00adssive trading volume of 1.36 billion units. This surge can be attributed to Ripple\u2019s strategic partne\u00adrship with SBI Holdings, Japan\u2019s largest venture capital fund.\n\nStrategic Partnerships for the Win\n\nRipple\u2019s strategic alliances haven\u2019t just strengthened its foothold in Japan; they have also bolstered the allure of XRP. A noteworthy development has arisen with SBI Remit, a subsidiary of SBI VC Trade, planning to utilize XRP for cross-border payments. This move further enhances the utility of this digital asset.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that while Bitcoin still maintains a larger trading volume in yen terms, XRP\u2019s significant ascent is undeniable.\n\nRead More: Has Japan Adopted Cryptocurrency the Same Way as the West?\n\nEveryone is Gaga Over XRP\n\nBITMAX, a Japan-based e\u00adxchange, conducted a survey re\u00advealing that 25% of respondents now re\u00adgard XRP as their preferred cryptocurrency. This surge in popularity can be attributed to the ripple effect of expanding global partnerships among major corporations and government endorsements for its swift and secure cross-border payment transactions.\n\nIn addition, the survey results reveal that Bitcoin has a slight le\u00adad at 26%, whereas Ethere\u00adum significantly trails behind with only 9% of respondents favoring it as their preferred digital asse\u00adt. This emerging pattern strongly suggests that Japanese investors are actively expanding their cryptocurre\u00adncy portfolios.\n\nXRP\u2019s Impact Extends to South Korea\n\nXRP\u2019s influence goes beyond Japan, highlighting its strong presence and consistent trading volumes in South Korea. In fact, it often outperforms Bitcoin on major South Korean crypto e\u00adxchanges, solidifying XRP as a global player in the cryptocurre\u00adncy arena.\n\nXRP\u2019s surging trading volumes and growing favor among inve\u00adstors are reshaping the crypto landscape by challenging the established dominance of Bitcoin and Ethere\u00adum.\n\nRead More: Top Reasons Why XRP is About to Become Way Bigger Than Everyone Thinks"

        "title": "Ethereum Leverage Ratio Is Rising, What Does It Mean? - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Data shows the Ethereum leverage ratio has been going up recently, something that may lead to higher volatility for the asset\u2019s price.\n\nEthereum Estimated Leverage Ratio Has Risen To 23% Now\n\nAs explained by an analyst in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, the Ethereum leverage ratio is pointing at increased risk in the market. The \u201cestimated leverage ratio\u201d (ELR) refers to the ratio between the Ethereum open interest and derivative exchange reserve.\n\nThe former of these, the \u201copen interest,\u201d keeps track of the total amount of positions that are currently open in the ETH futures market, while the latter metric, the derivative exchange reserve, simply measures the number of tokens sitting in the wallets of all centralized derivative exchanges.\n\nThe ELR basically tells us about how much leverage the average user on the futures market is currently opting for. When this indicator has a high value, it means that the open interest has a significant value compared to the exchange reserve, and so, the average contract is going for a high amount of leverage.\n\nOn the other hand, low values imply that the futures market users aren\u2019t willing to take risks at the moment as they haven\u2019t taken any significant amount of leverage.\n\nNow, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Ethereum ELR over the last few years:\n\nThe value of the metric seems to have been heading up in recent days | Source: CryptoQuant\n\nHistorically, whenever the ELR has gone up, the price of the cryptocurrency has become more likely to show volatility. This is due to the fact that a higher amount of leverage means that the average contract becomes more likely to get liquidated.\n\nA large amount of liquidations happening at once can lead to chaos in the market, and since this is more likely to happen when the ELR is high, the price can naturally have a greater chance of turning volatile.\n\nAs displayed in the above graph, the Ethereum ELR had risen to some high values in August. As it usually plays out, this overleveraged market condition resulted in sharp price action for the asset, which, in this case, occurred in the form of a steep crash from the $1,800 level to the $1,600 level.\n\nThe ELR quickly cooled down to relatively low values with the crash, as the positions with the most leverage were weeded out. For a while, the metric moved sideways at these lows, but recently, the indicator has once again started to rise.\n\nAt present, the metric has a value of 23%, which isn\u2019t as high as the pre-August crash value, but is still notable nonetheless. Huobi, Derbit, and OKX appear to have a disproportionate amount of leverage as compared to the wider sector, as the ELR for the platforms is currently 88%, 73%, and 43%, respectively.\n\n\u201cWhen ELR increases, volatility tends to follow the same path,\u201d notes the quant. \u201cIn this sense, Ethereum may be heading towards a period of increased turbulence.\u201d\n\nETH Price\n\nEthereum had declined towards $1,500 at the start of the week but has since made recovery back above the $1,600 mark.\n\nETH has returned back to its consolidation level | Source: ETHUSD on TradingView\n\nFeatured image from Kanchanara on Unsplash.com, charts from TradingView.com, CryptoQuant.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "It has been tough two years for Ethereum (ETH), losing around 65% of its value since 2021\u2019s all-time high, and some holders could have been feeling it harder these days, with \u2018capitulation signs\u2019 amid six-month lows for ETH price, noted by analysts.\n\nHowever, after the capitulation, there is usually a price rebound \u2013 at least, this is what most experts will agree upon on market cycle theories.\n\nIn that sense, analysts from the Santiment\u2019s Sanbase PRO reported on September 14 another major capitulation signal in what they called a \u201chistoric anomaly\u201d observed in the Ethereum Network.\n\nAs reported, Ethereum hit over 1 million Daily Active Addresses (DAA) in a single day, which makes this the second all-time high for this metric in the network\u2019s 8-year history.\n\nETH Daily Active Addresses \u201cEthereum has a massive spike in unique addresses interacting on Network, 2nd largest of all time\u201d. Source: Santiment\n\nCapitulation signal on Ethereum\u2019s Daily Active Addresses\n\nSantiment\u2019s analysts believe this \u201chistoric anomaly\u201d could be seen as a huge \u201ccapitulation signal needed for prices to rebound\u201d. This supports the thesis that ETH price could see a recovery in the near future, as many holders had to realize losses in what could be the end of a cycle.\n\nDAA measures the number of unique addresses becoming active in a single day. Calculated by summing up sending and receiving transactions from these unique addresses, being more reliable data for the market\u2019s sentiment than overall transaction activities, that could be inflated by a few addresses performing multiple sendings.\n\nNotably, Glassnode spotted an increase in this general data, as the number of sending addresses also hit an 8-month high of 17,364 this morning.\n\nETH number of sending addresses (hourly chart, 7d MA).

        "content": "When Fidelity Investments rolled out its crypto service in 2021, it introduced digital assets for the first time to the company's approximately 40 million individual clients.\n\nCrypto isn't for everyone \u2014 it's risky, volatile and can be hard to navigate. Fidelity's product has simplified the process, largely by starting investors with just a few crypto options.\n\nFidelity Crypto could be appealing for investors who are curious about cryptocurrency and already know and trust Fidelity with their investments.\n\nBut if you\u2019re already a hardcore crypto investor, chances are you\u2019re not going to be interested in switching for these new offerings alone. While Fidelity\u2019s low trading costs are competitive with some of the leading crypto exchanges, the selection and crypto functionality announced by the firm are not yet up to par.\n\nFor instance, Fidelity offers only two cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin and Ethereum. And users can't send or receive cryptocurrency from their accounts, a must for users who want to use crypto for payments or to access blockchain-based services on the web. You can sell crypto for fiat money, though.\n\n\u00bb Learn more: Read our review of Fidelity's brokerage.\n\nAdvertisement Charles Schwab Interactive Brokers IBKR Lite Webull NerdWallet's ratings are determined by our editorial team.

Learn More Learn More Learn More\n\nWhy you might want to sign up\n\nHere are a few factors to consider as you evaluate Fidelity's crypto offerings.\n\nCrypto trading fees\n\nFidelity is offering customers what it describes as \u201ccommission-free\u201d crypto trading. That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean trading is free. The company says it takes a spread of up to 1% on crypto trades.\n\nStill, that\u2019s relatively good compared with other crypto services reviewed by NerdWallet. Coinbase, the largest U.S.-based exchange focused solely on crypto, often charges a fee of $2.99 on simple transactions, which would exceed 1% on small purchases.\n\nOther crypto services can have significantly higher fees, with some upward of 10% depending on how you pay.\n\nFunding and minimums\n\nFunding a Fidelity Crypto account could be easy if you already have a brokerage or cash management account with the company. You\u2019ll be able to move money from Fidelity accounts into Fidelity Crypto.\n\nThere\u2019s no minimum deposit to open a crypto trading account. And the minimum crypto purchase is $1, Fidelity says. These factors put the company on even footing with most other leading exchanges.\n\nIf you don\u2019t have a Fidelity account, making purchases will require you to create and fund an account such as a brokerage or cash management account.\n\nWhy you might want to use another exchange\n\nAvailability\n\nFidelity Crypto is initially available 35 states. If you can\u2019t access the service in your state, you\u2019ll have to go with another option.\n\nCrypto selection\n\nFidelity Crypto\u2019s offerings are on the low end among cryptocurrency platforms reviewed by NerdWallet. Granted, Bitcoin and Ethereum are the two most valuable cryptocurrencies, which means they are widely used and relatively well-established in this emerging sector.\n\nHowever, cryptocurrency traders often look at more options when they are buying and selling. Crypto.com, another major cryptocurrency exchange, has more than 300 cryptocurrencies for sale. Other brokerages also have more crypto options. SoFi, for example, has about 20.\n\nIt may turn out that Fidelity follows the path of other brokerages, such as Robinhood, which started with limited crypto offerings, then expanded over time.\n\nFunctionality\n\nFidelity Crypto does not offer some of the advanced features available on competing exchanges. It doesn't allow staking, a process that allows owners of some cryptocurrencies to earn rewards similar to interest.\n\nAnd unlike some other crypto exchanges, Fidelity Crypto does not offer round-the-clock crypto transactions, with trading limited to 4 a.m. to 12 a.m. Eastern time.\n\nFinally, the company says it does not allow customers to transfer cryptocurrency out of their accounts or to external crypto wallets.\n\nTransfers are crucial if you want to do anything with cryptocurrency other than hold it in hopes that it will increase in value. You won\u2019t be able to use crypto purchased through Fidelity on decentralized finance products, for instance.\n\nTrack your finances all in one place.

        "content": "In brief Wrapped tokens are a way to use cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Dogecoin on blockchains other than the blockchain they were originally built on.\n\nWrapped tokens are backed 1:1 by their underlying asset, which is stored in a digital vault.\n\nWrapped tokens are a solution to the problem of blockchain interoperability.\n\nYour Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nOne way to understand blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum is as separate distributed databases. As blockchains are separate, they can\u2019t communicate easily with each other.\n\nYou can\u2019t use your Bitcoin directly on the Ethereum blockchain, because only the Bitcoin blockchain \u201cknows\u201d that you hold Bitcoin.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWrapped tokens were created as a solution to this problem. With wrapped tokens, you can effectively move assets between blockchains and use them across the crypto ecosystem.\n\nWhat are wrapped tokens?\n\nWrapped tokens are assets that allow the value of a native asset from one blockchain to transfer to another blockchain. One of the best-known wrapped tokens is Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC). WBTC is pegged 1:1 to the price of Bitcoin (BTC), so that one WBTC should always equal one BTC. But unlike BTC, WBTC is available as ERC-20 or TRC-20 tokens, which means it can be used and traded on the Ethereum and Tron blockchains.\n\nIn a way, wrapped tokens are similar to stablecoins such as USDT, which follow the price of the U.S. dollar. Just as one WBTC is pegged to the price of one BTC, one USDT is pegged to the price of $1.\n\nWhat makes a wrapped token a wrapped token, though, is not just whether it is pegged 1:1 to the price of another asset. It's the technology behind it and the way in which its value is backed and maintained.\n\nDid you know? On January 14, 2021, CoinMarketCap briefly (and erroneously) listed the market cap of WBTC as 432 quadrillion US dollars, or more than 1,000 times the total estimated wealth in the world, according to the\n\nFinancial Times.\n\nHow do wrapped tokens work?\n\nWrapped tokens are created and destroyed by a process called \u201cminting\u201d and \u201cburning.\u201d To mint a wrapped token such as WBTC, the underlying asset, in this case BTC, is sent to a custodian who stores the BTC in a digital vault. Once the underlying BTC has been locked away, an equivalent amount of WBTC can be minted.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis process can also be understood as \u201cwrapping.\u201d The underlying asset is \u201cwrapped up\u201d in a digital vault using a smart contract, and a newly wrapped asset is minted for use on another blockchain.\n\nTo burn WBTC, the same process is followed, but in reverse. The WBTC is removed from circulation, and the equivalent amount of BTC is released from the digital vault and allowed back into circulation.\n\nJust as minting wrapped tokens can be thought of as \u201cwrapping\u201d the underlying asset to create a token of equivalent value for use on another blockchain, burning wrapped tokens can be thought of as \u201cunwrapping\u201d the underlying asset.\n\nThis process of minting and burning, or wrapping and unwrapping, means that all wrapped tokens, from WBTC to renDOGE (a wrapped form of Dogecoin), are backed by an equivalent amount of their underlying currency. For every 100 renDOGE that has been minted, 100 DOGE are being held to back the value of the wrapped token.\n\nWhat\u2019s so special about wrapped tokens?\n\nWrapped tokens such as WBTC offer interoperability between blockchains so that people can move assets easily and take advantage of features and applications on other blockchains. Those advantages might be faster transaction times, lower fees, or yield farming opportunities.\n\nWhile the amount of WBTC in circulation has been steadily increasing, bridges\u2014a solution which allows you to wrap your own tokens to move them across blockchains\u2014have been proliferating.\n\nThis comes with some risks: bridges have been the target of a number of hacks, and Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin wrote in January 2022 that their security vulnerabilities were why he is \"pessimistic about cross-chain applications.\"\n\nExamples of wrapped tokens\n\n\ud83c\udf81\u20bf WBTC - Project that wraps BTC for use on the Ethereum blockchain; operated by the WBTC DAO and started jointly by Kyber, Ren, and BitGo\n\n\ud83c\udf81\u039e WETH - Wrapped ETH, or WETH, was created by a group of projects run by 0x labs and is an ERC-20 version of Ethereum that can be used as an asset on DeFi protocols\n\n\ud83d\udc15 renDOGE - Wrapped version of Dogecoin that can be minted using the RenBridge on the RenVM protocol\n\nThe future of wrapped tokens\n\nAchieving interoperability between different blockchains is a challenge for the industry.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOne problem is that as more blockchains are created, the number of bridges needed to ensure that assets on a blockchain can easily transfer to every other blockchain increases exponentially.\n\nSolutions are being developed to try to make bridging assets between blockchains easier and more efficient. One way to do this is with a bridge hub, which refers to a central bridge that all other blockchains bridge to. An example of this is Darwinia, a cross-chain bridge hub being built on Substrate.\n\nFor the foreseeable future, at least, bridges and wrapped tokens are set to continue to be a central part of the solution for interoperability."

EIP-7514, in particular, aims to decelerate the rate at which ETH holders are staking their assets.\n\nIf the current rate of staking continues unabated, the Ethereum network could potentially reach a point where half of its Ether is staked by May 2024. More alarmingly, that number could hit 100% by December 2024. While this may seem like robust community participation, it brings along its own set of problems\u2014increased network strain and diluted staking rewards, which could disincentivize long-term staking.\n\nRead More: Ethereum Daily Active Addresses Surge: ETH Price to Rebound Soon?\n\nBefore EIP-7514, the number of validators (these are the good folks who process your transactions and create new blocks) could grow exponentially. However, more validators mean more messages and data to process, which could bottleneck the network.\n\nEthereum Community Response\n\nCrypto influencer Dankard Feist tweeted in favor, arguing that the lower churn limit afforded by the EIP would give the community the time needed to research, debate, and implement solutions.\n\nMy reasoning on why I'm for EIP-7514. It is currently unclear if (especially liquid) staking will keep growing indefinitely. In the case that the withdrawal queue does not empty over the next few months, the lower churn limit will give the Ethereum community the time needed to\u2026 \u2014 Dankrad Feist (@dankrad) September 14, 2023\n\nOn the flip side, Ethereum investor Ryan Berckman criticized the rushed nature of the proposal, claiming it could compromise the network\u2019s neutrality.\n\nMy understanding is that EIP-7514 was considered too quickly, and the proposed urgency to cap validator growth doesn't align with the steadily shrinking activation queue.\n\n\n\nEIP-7514 should be excluded https://t.co/l2yK5srNN9 pic.twitter.com/ZMu4BoiR00 \u2014 Ryan Berckmans ryanb.eth\ud83e\udd87\ud83d\udd0a (@ryanberckmans) September 14, 2023\n\nThe Ethereum network has been on a roller-coaster ride since its inception, and EIP-7514 could be considered as hitting the \u201cpause\u201d button. It grants the Ethereum community the breathing room needed to make more informed decisions about its future.\n\nAlso Read: How did Bitcoin and Ethereum React to the CPI Report?\n\nBut, as with all things crypto, there\u2019s a downside. Fast-tracking changes to staking parameters could compromise Ethereum\u2019s commitment to maximum neutrality, a unique asset in an increasingly competitive crypto landscape."

How has this surge affected other important metrics?\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nEthereum active addresses witness a brief spike\n\nAccording to an analysis of the active user metric, Ethereum\u2019s surge to 1 million active addresses was a stark contrast to the typical average of approximately 300,000 active users that Ethereum had been experiencing prior to the spike.\n\nSomething weird is going on with daily active Ethereum addresses. from their usual 300-400K to over 1M yesterday. pic.twitter.com/nXgW6ydCES \u2014 Patrick Scott | Dynamo DeFi (@Dynamo_Patrick) September 14, 2023\n\nHowever, as of this writing, the number of active users had returned to its previous range. The observable count of active addresses stood at over 350,000 at press time. Was there any impact on other metrics?\n\nEthereum\u2019s transactions and volume analysis\n\nAccording to the transaction data from DefiLlama, there was a noticeable increase in the number of active Ethereum users that correlated with a surge in transactions.\n\nThe transaction chart indicated that on the same day as the spike in active users, the number of transactions surged to over 1.6 million. Prior to this surge, the transaction count typically ranged from 800,000 to 1 million.\n\nNotably, this peak marked the highest transaction volume recorded so far this year.\n\nHowever, similar to the active users, the transaction count has since decreased. As of this writing, the number of transactions was approximately 1 million.\n\nInterestingly, a review of the volume trend revealed that it remained relatively unaffected by the spike in active users and transactions. It displayed a stable, non-spiky pattern and currently stands at around $754 million.\n\nETH on an uptrend of its own\n\nExamining ETH\u2019s price trend using a daily timeframe chart revealed that it has been following its upward trajectory. The chart indicated a four-day streak of consecutive gains, following a period of stagnant movement and a significant dip.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ETHs worth today?\n\nAs of this writing, Ethereum was trading at approximately $1,630, showing a slight uptick of less than 1%. It\u2019s worth noting that although the Relative Strength Index (RSI) still indicated a position below the neutral line, the ongoing price uptrend had pushed it higher.\n\nHowever, as of the time of this update, the exact cause behind the surge in transactions and active users remained unknown."

        "content": "Thu 14 Sep 2023 \u25aa 3 min of reading \u25aa by Fenelon L.\n\nMarket predictions in the crypto space often lead to spirited debates among investors. Recently, Benjamin Cowen, a respected analyst in the field, made some waves by forecasting a significant downturn for Ethereum (ETH) and Cardano (ADA).\n\nAlarming Projections for Ethereum and the Crypto Market\n\nFollowing the recent tumble of Bitcoin, which dragged down a large portion of the crypto market with it, renowned analyst Benjamin Cowen is anticipating an extended winter period for Ethereum and Cardano.\n\nIn a video, Cowen paints a bleak future for Ethereum. According to him, not only could Ethereum\u2019s price decline, but it could also drop below the critical threshold of $800.\n\nHis analysis doesn\u2019t stop there; he even envisions a potential drop to levels of $600, $500, or even $400.\n\nOutlining a trajectory for Ethereum, Cowen anticipates a mix of gradual declines and brief rallies, fueling an atmosphere of uncertainty. This volatility could persist until the end of the year, raising doubts among both optimistic and pessimistic investors. In such a context, significant losses could loom for market participants.\n\nCardano (ADA): Heading for an Imminent Decline?\n\nCowen\u2019s outlook for Cardano, another major player in the crypto space, is equally gloomy. He draws parallels between a potential downturn in Cardano and a 50% drop in the Nasdaq. According to his estimations, Cardano could plummet to less than $0.20, down from a previous position of $0.37.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t stop there. If Cardano were to fall by 27% from its current level, we could see a price near $0.16, a level last seen in August 2020. To bolster his analysis, Cowen also recalls other historical milestones for Cardano, including a peak at $0.11 in 2019 and pre-pandemic prices ranging from $0.07 to $0.08.\n\nFaced with this uncertainty, Cowen expresses reservations about the short-lived rebounds of Cardano, which could deceive investors and lead them to adopt risky strategies.\n\nCowen\u2019s analysis serves as a reminder of the importance of exercising caution in the world of cryptocurrencies. However, it\u2019s worth noting that these are his personal forecasts, which may or may not materialize. Meanwhile, the crypto sphere is holding its breath, anticipating the SEC\u2019s resolution regarding the Ethereum Futures ETF. Its approval could potentially catalyze an upward trend for ETH and the entire crypto market.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program!

This comes after the cryptocurrency has been hit by waves of regulatory boards demanding the tightening and transparency of crypto commodities, tokens and intermediaries.\n\nLubin stated:\n\nAmerica will see that decentralized protocols, blockchain, and cryptocurrency are aligned with the philosophies of the U.S. And I think much of the rest of the world will follow suit.\n\nIn March, Lubin told CNBC:\n\nPeople buy barrels of oil with the expectation of profit \u2013 I stand by my conviction that ether is a commodity.\n\nEthereum is not the only crypto company to face duress; Binance, Ripple, and Coinbase are also under the watchful eye of the SEC for violating security laws by selling native cryptocurrency XRP without registering it with the SEC.\n\nDon\u2019t miss out the latest news, subscribe to LeapRate\u2019s newsletter\n\nHowever, many crypto leaders have warned the SEC that their laws and regulations lack clear instructions. CEO of Binance, Changpeng Zhao indicated that the company would remove itself from U.S. users if the SEC does not implement better-outlined laws. This would damage the U.S. reputation as the global leader in crypto-related movement."

        "content": "Cryptocurrencies have done modestly well this week, with Bitcoin rebounding above $26,000 and the market cap of all digital coins soaring to $1.06 trillion. This happened after Franklin Templeton applied for its spot Bitcoin ETF, joining other companies like Blackrock, Invesco, and WisdomTree that are waiting for their approvals.\n\nCryptocurrencies reacted mildly to the strong US retail sales and inflation numbers that raised the possibility of more Fed tightening. The headline consumer price index (CPI) jumped to 3.7% in August, the biggest increase in months. Retail sales continued soaring, signaling that the American consumer is still strong.\n\nThe next key macro news that will move cryptocurrency prices will be the UAW strike in the United States. More than 150k workers will go to a strike after negotiations with the Big Three auto companies failed.\n\nThese workers, through their unions, are seeking several things, including a 40% pay increase, healthcare coverage, and job guarantees. Auto companies like Ford, GM, and Stellantis believe that these requests are extreme. Stellantis has even warned that it will relocate manufacturing of its trucks to Mexico.\n\nThis strike will have a major impact depending on how it lasts. First, the automobile sector is a major job creator in the United States. As such, a long strike will hurt the economy, the three auto companies, and their suppliers.\n\nMost importantly, this strike will lead to low new vehicle supplies in the US, which will lead to higher prices for new and used cars. Vehicles are some of the most important contributors of inflation in the US.\n\nHigher inflation, also because of soaring crude oil prices, will force the Federal Reserve to consider hiking interest rates in the coming meetings. In most periods, cryptocurrency prices tend to underperform in a period of high-interest rates.\n\nMeanwhile, millions of Americans are scheduled to restart paying their student debts later this month. And with the M2 money supply falling, there is a likelihood that these repayments will hit the economy and crypto prices.\n\nTherefore, the outlook of key cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, Cosmos ATOM, Algorand, and Jasmy is bearish. These coins will likely see weaker demand as people move to the relatively safe and high-yielding US dollar.\n\nRead more: How to buy Algorand.\n\nAccording to Crane Data, money market funds by companies like Western Asset, Federated Hermes, State Street, and Allspring Heritage are yielding over 5.45%. As such, many people will likely move to these liquid and safe assets as hopes of more Fed hikes rise."

        "content": "Everlodge (ELDG), now in its presale phase, is carving an impressive path that makes it stand shoulder-to-shoulder with established giants Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL). This piece delves into the journey of Everlodge, outlining its rise and the potential to reshape the future of DeFi.\n\nJoin the Everlodge presale\n\nEverlodge (ELDG): An 80% Price Surge and Global Anticipation\n\nWith just $100, you could own a stake in an upscale New York hotel, a coveted Airbnb in London's center, or a serene Maldivian villa. But how is this possible?\n\nThe Everlodge vision is to transmute these properties into divisible NFTs available for trade on the blockchain, making high-end real estate investments accessible to many without hefty initial investments.\n\nAnchored on the Ethereum blockchain, these NFTs embody trust, clarity, genuineness, and an unmatched level of investor authority. Notably, the NFT metadata encapsulates every critical property detail to avoid the limitations of traditional real estate investments.\n\nEverlodge's idea is a game-changing one. Its potential lies in that real estate investments usually limited to investors with deep pockets, can now be purchased as fractional shares at low prices. Thus, Everlodge allows smaller-sized investors to benefit from the industry's growth without paying exorbitant fees or settling for lower returns.\n\nThe fervor surrounding Everlodge's presale is palpable, with millions of investors clamoring for the last remaining ELDG tokens selling for $0.018 in phase 3. The current price represents an 80% pump as the price rises throughout the presale event.\n\nGiven that the vacation rental market is valued at a staggering $82.6 billion and is poised for a 4.7% CAGR from 2023-2030, change is unmistakably in the wind. The upside for Everlodge is immense, prompting early investors to look at the project's promise in anticipation.\n\nAnalysts project Everlodge not merely as a participant but potentially as a game-changer in the real estate landscape, with whispers of ELDG's value skyrocketing by a whopping 30x once the full platform launches.\n\nEthereum (ETH)'s Fluctuations between $2,000 and $2,100\n\nOver the past few months, Ethereum has attempted to break free from the $2,000 to $2,100 range. However, a swift 12% descent over the past few weeks to the $1,600 level has further dampened Ethereum's momentum.\n\nSo, what's curbing Ethereum's potential? Despite its strong fundamentals and a $21 billion TVL, Ethereum remains chained to Bitcoin's price movements. As Bitcoin grapples with its own market hurdles, Ethereum is caught in the ensuing ripple effect, leading traders to seek more stable grounds.\n\nBut the Bitcoin link is just one facet. Diminishing network activity and looming apprehensions of massive sell-offs further darken the horizon. This sentiment is mirrored in Ethereum's TVL, which witnessed a sharp 50% drop since mid-April.\n\nYet, for Ethereum's major stakeholders, the landscape isn't entirely bleak. Many draw parallels between the early promise they saw in Ethereum in 2017 and the potential they now see in Everlodge. This budding interest, amplified by the enticing offers in the Everlodge presale, is steering Ethereum traders to venture into this emerging realm.\n\nSolana (SOL): Shifting Investor Focus to New Horizons like Everlodge (ELDG)\n\nSolana's price recently surged from $8 to an admirable $32. A combination of factors fueled this ascent: Solana's recovery from the FTX debacle, the success of the Ripple/SEC legal case, and its ability to overcome minor technical glitches that once dampened its appeal.\n\nHowever, despite this strong trajectory, Solana could not breach the $32 resistance point. Its current standing at $18.95 marks a considerable 40% slide in just two months. While analysts hold the conviction that the $16 mark offers staunch support, the precipitous drop undeniably jolted the faith of Solana enthusiasts.\n\nYet, experts continue to spotlight Solana's promise as a frontrunner in layer-1 technology and the DeFi realm. Since the year's outset, the platform's 50% augmentation in TVL is a testament to its bullish prospects.\n\nThat said, it's undeniable that Solana, much like its counterparts, has been swayed by the overarching bearish market mood. Consequently, some investors are setting their sights on fresher prospects, with Everlodge emerging as a shining beacon in the darkness.\n\nFind out more about the Everlodge (ELDG) Presale\n\nWebsite: https://www.everlodge.io/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/everlodge\n\nDisclaimer:\n\nThis is an advertorial.

        "content": "Polygon Labs\u2019 vision of an interconnected layer-2 Ethereum ecosystem powered by zero-knowledge cryptography begins in earnest following three inaugural improvement proposals that will begin the transition to Polygon 2.0.\n\nThe scaling technology firm unveiled Polygon 2.0 in June 2023, outlining plans for a scaling ecosystem made up of four protocol layers. The staking, interop, execution and proving layers all play a role in creating an interconnected ecosystem of chains that enable fast value transfer and information sharing.\n\n1/ The wait is over. Polygon 2.0 implementation kicks off now with the release of 3 Polygon Improvement Proposals (PIPs), and a roadmap for Phase 0.https://t.co/gk7FW0zCpc pic.twitter.com/YJo3BtQy4y \u2014 Polygon (Labs) (@0xPolygonLabs) September 14, 2023\n\nPolygon co-founder Sandeep Nailwal recently unpacked how the ecosystem aims to become the value layer of the internet by using zero-knowledge (ZK) technology to provide low-fee, high-throughput performance to the wider Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nPolygon released three Polygon Improvement Proposals (PIPs) on Sept. 14 for community consideration and voting that are earmarked to begin taking place in the final quarter of 2023.\n\nRelated: Polygon\u2019s \u2018holy grail\u2019 Ethereum-scaling zkEVM beta hits mainnet\n\nThe PIPs outline technical details for \u201cPhase 0\u201d of the establishment of a network of interconnected ZK-powered layer-2 chains that scale Ethereum. This includes a proposal for the transition and specifications that will see MATIC (MATIC) tokens become POL tokens, which will become the Polygon proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol\u2019s native token.\n\nPIP-17 will include the initiation of the upgrade from MATIC to POL. This includes its transition to POL as the native gas token and staking token for the Polygon ecosystem, as well as the launch of the staking layer and migration of Polygon public chains.\n\nPIP-18 includes the technical description of POL tokens as well as accompanying contracts that will handle emission and token migrations. POL tokens can be migrated at a 1:1 ratio from existing MATIC tokens. The PIP notes an initial supply of 10 billion and a yearly emission of 2% equally distributed between validator staking rewards and a community treasury.\n\nLastly, PIP-19 proposes the update of the native gas token on Polygon PoS from MATIC to POL while ensuring maximum backwards compatibility.\n\nPolygon\u2019s announcement notes that PIP-19 will not change contracts on Polygon PoS, while the properties of the protocol\u2019s native token will not change either. However, contracts on Ethereum that are awaiting MATIC from the native MATIC bridge may be affected by the upgrade.\n\nMagazine: Here\u2019s how Ethereum\u2019s ZK-rollups can become interoperable"

        "content": "The crypto market seems to be stuck in a puzzling state right now. It\u2019s like everyone\u2019s waiting for something big to happen. But you know what? Many top analysts are still bullish about Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Solana (SOL). They believe these cryptos could pull off some serious 10X growth, which is pretty impressive.\n\nAnd even better, if these big players make it big, it could give a boost to the entire altcoin scene. Some analysts have their eyes on coins like Wall Street Memes ($WSM), Bitcoin BSC ($BTCBSC), and Launchpad XYZ ($LPX), expecting them to go 10X, too. But first, let\u2019s see why top analysts expect BTC, ETH, and SOL to grow 10X.\n\n>>>Buy Wall Street Memes Now<<<\n\n10X Growth on the Horizon \u2013 Insights from Top Analysts on Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana\n\nWhile the current crypto market might seem a bit shaky, some top analysts are actually quite bullish on Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana.\n\nStarting with Bitcoin, top analysts like Bill Miller and Cathie Wood are optimistic, even predicting a 10X surge. Their confidence stems from Bitcoin\u2019s limited supply and the growing interest from institutional investors, both of which could lead to some serious gains. They firmly believe that Bitcoin\u2019s role as a store of value is set to drive its value way up.\n\nEthereum is also on analysts\u2019 radar, especially the renowned investment firm VanEck. The company is eyeing a potential 10X return on Ethereum investments. In its view, Ethereum\u2019s upcoming 2.0 upgrade, the explosive adoption of DeFi applications, and its real-world applications could drive its value up.\n\nMeanwhile, other analysts are also bullish on Solana, predicting a remarkable 10X increase in its value. They attribute this potential surge to Solana\u2019s lightning-fast and cost-effective transactions. Solana\u2019s strategic collaborations, such as with Visa, have experts excited about the possibility of substantial gains in the near future.\n\nWhile top analysts are focusing on Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana, others are paying close attention to altcoins like Wall Street Memes, Bitcoin BSC, and Launchpad XYZ and predicting that these coins will surge 10X or even more. So, let\u2019s dig into what makes these coins special.\n\n>>>Buy Wall Street Memes Now<<<\n\n1. Wall Street Memes ($WSM) \u2013 Dubbed as the 10X Meme Coin of 2023 by Top Analyst\n\nWall Street Memes ($WSM) is undoubtedly the hottest meme coin of 2023, and it\u2019s an exciting opportunity for you to get massive gains as top analysts are buzzing about its potential for 10X gains! This coin is riding the meme wave and encapsulating the rebellious spirit of WallStreetBets within the crypto realm.\n\nSince the beginning, WSM\u2019s presale has been phenomenal, having now surpassed $25 million! Moreover, WSM is doing its tokenomics right. They\u2019ve allocated 50% of the tokens to the presale, ensuring community engagement and thwarting rug pulls. Another 30% goes into community rewards, keeping the community motivated and involved. The remaining 20% is for liquidity.\n\n>>>Buy Wall Street Memes Now<<<\n\nBut what truly sets WSM apart is it boasts a massive following of over a million dedicated supporters, and Elon Musk has interacted with them. Plus, there\u2019s an exciting $50K airdrop to keep the frenzy going.\n\nTop crypto analysts like Michael Wrubel are optimistic regarding WSM\u2019s potential for 10X growth. He is thrilled about WSM\u2019s established community, which gives it a significant edge over other meme coin launches.\n\nThe presale is wrapping up, and less than 20 days are left until WSM hits tier-1 exchanges. Analysts are buzzing about potential 10X gains, so don\u2019t wait too long \u2013 jump on board now.\n\n>>>Buy Wall Street Memes Now<<<\n\n2. Bitcoin BSC ($BTCBSC) \u2013 Top Analyst Predicts 10X Surge Due to Innovative Staking\n\nBitcoin BSC ($BTCBSC) is a new player in the crypto scene that could potentially give you a shot at Bitcoin-like gains. Why? Well, it draws inspiration from Bitcoin but takes advantage of the Binance Smart Chain, making it more efficient. Plus, top analysts like Jacob Bury are talking about a possible 10X surge in its value.\n\n>>> Buy Bitcoin BSC Now<<<\n\nCurrently priced at $0.99, it harks back to Bitcoin\u2019s initial price parity with the dollar back in 2013 before its meteoric rise. The $BTCBSC presale has already raked in over a million dollars in just a short time. Its presale supply mirrors Bitcoin\u2019s 2013 numbers but boasts a unique feature \u2013 a Stake-to-Earn model instead of resource-intensive mining.\n\nJacob Bury underlines the significance of staking rewards, advocating for long-term holding and growth. Every 10 minutes, a generous 69% of the remaining 14 million+ tokens are distributed to stakers. This greener alternative to mining has experts excited about a potential 10X surge for $BTCBSC.\n\nAs top analysts foresee 10X growth for Bitcoin, it\u2019s expected that clones like Bitcoin BSC will experience a significant uptick in value, and the unique staking mechanism could propel $BTCBSC even further. The presale is filling up fast, so it\u2019s wise to jump in early to potentially ride that 10X wave.\n\n>>> Buy Bitcoin BSC Now<<<\n\n3. Launchpad XYZ ($LPX) \u2013 The Web3 Powerhouse Eyed for 10X Gains by Top Analyst\n\nLaunchpad XYZ is a crypto project that\u2019s creating quite a buzz, and experts like Conor Kenny are calling it a potential 10X winner. Launchpad XYZ is on a mission to bring together all the crucial Web3 tools you need for smarter trading and investment decisions, all under one roof.\n\n>>> Buy Launchpad XYZ Now<<<\n\nTheir platform boasts some exciting features, such as an AI assistant that combines sentiment analysis, the latest news, and insights from pro traders. They also have a dedicated charting platform, watchlists to keep an eye on the hottest tokens, and an automated project rating system to make your life easier.\n\nTo access the Launchpad XYZ platform, you will need the native $LPX token, which is currently available in presale for $0.0445 per token, nearly 40% off the list price of $0.07. The presale has already pulled in over $1.6 million, but time is running out, so it\u2019s a smart move to get in early.\n\nKenny is particularly impressed with Launchpad XYZ\u2019s suite of trading tools and exclusive access, seeing them as key factors that could potentially drive it to a 10X growth.\n\n>>> Buy Launchpad XYZ Now<<<\n\nConclusion\n\nAs top analysts anticipate the growth for BTC, ETH, and SOL, coins like $WSM, $BTCBSC, and $LPX could achieve 10X even faster. These tokens have gained attention due to their distinctive attributes, strong communities, and innovative staking systems. Importantly, these coins are currently in presale, presenting a timely opportunity to get involved.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Where is Best to Stake My ETH? - BSC NEWS",
        "content": "This article explores the top Ethereum staking platforms, both centralized and decentralized, providing insights into their features and rewards.\n\nETH Staking: A Secure Path to Passive Income in Crypto\n\nIn the ever-evolving landscape of cryptocurrencies, one question looms large for Ethereum investors seeking to maximize their returns: \"Where is best to stake my ETH?\"\n\nStaking, a process involving supporting the blockchain network and validating transactions, has emerged as an enticing option for those seeking passive rewards. Among the myriad choices available, Ethereum (ETH) staking stands out as a beacon of security and reliability, promising a steady income derived from protocol revenue.\n\nIn the realm of proof-of-stake consensus mechanisms, validators take a pivotal role by locking up a specific amount of cryptocurrency as collateral. This collateral serves as the bedrock upon which new blocks are created, and transactions are validated.\n\nIn return for their commitment, those staking their Ethereum tokens actively contribute to enhancing the security and decentralization of the Ethereum network while enjoying rewards as a token of appreciation.\n\nWhat sets staking Ethereum apart from the traditional mining process is its significantly reduced energy consumption, which minimizes its environmental footprint.\n\nListed below are six platforms you can use to stake your ETH. These platforms not only excel in offering remarkable staking rewards but also serve as strategic assets for astute investors navigating the dynamic and ever-evolving realm of Decentralized Finance (DeFi).\n\nSource: Ethereum Twitter\n\nLets discover the best places to stake your Ethereum and see how your investments can flourish in the burgeoning world of DeFi.\n\n\u200d\n\nTop Decentralized ETH Staking Platforms\n\nWhile staking Ethereum (ETH), choosing the right platform is paramount. Here, we present the top decentralized Ethereum staking platforms that offer unique advantages, each catering to different user preferences and requirements.\n\n1. Lido: Unleashing the Power of Liquidity\n\nLido takes the lead as a premier Ethereum staking platform, offering a seamless, efficient, and decentralized staking experience. One of its standout features is its remarkable liquidity, boasting over $1.5 billion provided on Curve. This liquidity empowers users with the flexibility to easily convert their staked ETH (stETH) tokens into other assets, opening doors to diverse opportunities within the DeFi ecosystem.\n\nStaking with Lido yields stETH tokens, representing staked ETH and earned rewards, with an impressive current APR of 3.8%.\n\nLido has a firm commitment to security, decentralization, and user-friendliness, combined with substantial liquidity, making it one of the best platform to stake ETH coins and contribute to ETH's robustness and growth.\n\n2. RocketPool: Decentralization at its Core\n\nRocketPool secures the second spot as a top Ethereum (ETH) staking platform, championing a decentralized approach to ETH 2.0 staking. As a decentralized staking pool, RocketPool allows users to stake 8, 16, or 32 ETH, receiving rETH tokens in return.\n\nUtilizing a network of node operators, RocketPool ensures the trifecta of security, decentralization, and trustlessness, making it a favored option among those in search of a more decentralized staking solution. While offering ETH rewards at a current 3.27% APR, it's worth noting that RocketPool is better suited for advanced on-chain users due to its complexity.\n\nRocketPool's decentralized nature reduces dependence on a single point of failure, enhancing its overall security.\n\n3. Frax Finance: Innovating Ethereum Staking with Frax Ether\n\nFrax Finance introduces a pioneering Ethereum staking DeFi platform, Frax Ether (frxETH), designed to maximize staking yields and simplify the Ethereum staking process. Frax Ether's liquid staking removes the technical barriers and the 32 ETH requirement associated with solo staking, making it accessible to a broader range of users.\n\nThis platform offers a unique twist by combining three primary components\u2014Frax Ether (frxETH), Staked Frax Ether (sfrxETH), and the Frax ETH Minter.\n\nFrxETH acts as a stablecoin loosely pegged to ETH, providing a seamless entry point into the Frax ecosystem. Users unlock staking yields by exchanging frxETH for sfrxETH, which can be redeemed when converting sfrxETH back to frxETH.\n\nWith potential earnings of up to 6% APR in interest on their ETH holdings, liquid staking with Frax Ether offers users flexibility and composability within the DeFi landscape.\n\nSource: Frax Finance Twiiter\n\n\u200d\n\nTop ETH Centralized Staking Platforms\n\nWhile decentralized staking platforms offer unique advantages, centralized alternatives provide a simplified and user-friendly approach to Ethereum (ETH) staking. Here, we delve into the top centralized Ethereum staking platforms, each offering its blend of convenience and rewards.\n\n1. Binance: Streamlined Staking with Binance Staked Ethereum (BETH)\n\nBinance is a robust centralized Ethereum (ETH) staking platform, providing a user-friendly interface for staking ETH and earning a current 3.42% APR in rewards through Binance Staked Ethereum (BETH). Binance excels at simplifying the staking process, catering to users with varying levels of technical expertise. However, it's important to note that Binance offers comparatively lower yields when compared to alternatives like Bybit.\n\nDespite this, Binance's immense user base and stringent security measures make it an appealing choice for Ethereum staking. Users can conveniently stake their ETH holdings and enjoy competitive rewards with minimal complexity.\n\n2. Bybit: Global Leader in Ethereum Staking\n\nBybit emerges as the premier choice for Ethereum (ETH) staking across more than 180 countries, thanks to its user-friendly integration of ETH 2.0 staking and support for stETH. By locking up your ETH as collateral, you actively contribute to the validation of the Ethereum network while earning up to 7% APR in rewards.\n\nBybit's automatic conversion of staked ETH to stETH at 1:1 ensures that users begin accruing daily rewards based on their stETH holdings. The platform's Unified Trading Account goes a step further, allowing you to trade using your stETH tokens as collateral, granting access to both the Spot market and the ability to withdraw your stETH holdings.\n\nWith its user-centric approach and generous rewards, Bybit firmly establishes itself as a key player in Ethereum staking.\n\nSource: ByBit Twitter\n\n3. Coinbase: A Top Exchange Embraces Staking\n\nCoinbase, a publicly traded company and one of the largest crypto exchanges globally offers Ethereum staking with a competitive 3.27% APY.\n\nNotably, Coinbase does not impose a lock-up period, though users may need to wait for the unstaking process to complete as per the protocol before accessing their crypto. Staking ETH on Coinbase follows a straightforward process akin to staking other cryptocurrencies. Similar to Lido DAO, Coinbase offers a synthetic staked ETH token, cbETH, allowing users to earn an additional yield.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that Coinbase's rigorous KYC requirements translate to a more extended sign-up process, demanding additional verification steps. Nonetheless, for users seeking a familiar and trusted exchange to stake their ETH and other assets, Coinbase presents a compelling choice.\n\n\u200d\n\nThe Path to Secure and Rewarding Ethereum Staking\n\nAs with any investment, caution and prudence are paramount. Ethereum staking presents its considerations and risks, ranging from smart contract vulnerabilities to centralization concerns.\n\nSmart contract risk is a focal point, as once your ETH is staked within a PoS smart contract, it's no longer under your direct custody and becomes susceptible to potential hacking attempts.\n\nMoreover, the consequences of a significant smart contract breach could extend beyond the immediate loss of funds. It could have a cascading effect on the entire Ethereum ecosystem, impacting the value of unstaked ETH held in self-custody.\n\nAdditionally, there are considerations related to slashing penalties and rule violations by some lesser-known staking platforms.\n\nAs regulatory bodies like the SEC explore the classification of PoS cryptos as securities, it becomes vital for stakers to stay informed about potential regulatory changes.\n\nNevertheless, the allure of passive rewards on one of the most promising assets of recent years provides an avenue for compounding crypto gains.\n\nBefore embarking on the journey of crypto staking, it is essential to be well-informed and diligent. Conduct thorough research, select reputable platforms, and stay attuned to the evolving regulatory landscape. By taking these precautions, users can confidently navigate the world of Ethereum staking, contributing to the network's security and growth while enjoying its rewards."

        "content": "Cybersecurity firms Forta Network and Blockfence have disclosed how a sophisticated scam, coined \u201csleepdropping,\u201d has cost Ethereum users $11.5 million since its first detection in December 2022. The insidious operation centers on ERC-1155 tokens, often disguised as legitimate NFTs. Alarmingly, these fraudulent airdrops have reached over 500,000 addresses. The tactics deployed by the scammers expose the Achilles\u2019 heel of smart contracts, even as they continue to gain mainstream acceptance.\n\nA critical facet of this scam is the fraudulent website that deceives users into engaging in risky financial transactions. On the surface, these websites are legitimate platforms. However, once users engage with these sites, their funds end up in the pockets of unknown fraudsters. Over 20,000 users have already fallen prey to this intricate scam.\n\nInterestingly, the scammers have even replicated a genuine Lido NFT token as a \u201cbadge\u201d for a supposed airdrop, extending the web of deceit. While the NFT itself poses no direct risk to the user\u2019s financial assets, the real danger lies in the secondary interactions it encourages. Users who believe the airdrop is genuine may claim harmful tokens on phishing sites. The scam transforms a harmless token into a lure that pulls users into a financial trap.\n\nWhat complicates the matter further is the seemingly authentic nature of the smart contracts used to disseminate these tokens. In some instances, these contracts mimicked legitimate airdrops from reputable sources, such as those that rewarded early Lido stakers in 2021. According to Forta Network, an observant user might even see the tokens coming from a legitimate source, highlighting the depths these scammers are willing to feign authenticity.\n\nThe research conducted by Forta and Blockfence has identified more than a hundred unique smart contracts connected to this scam. These contracts share similar deployment characteristics, providing clues to the scam\u2019s modus operandi. The scam unfolds in three main stages, which are as follows: fraudulent airdrop operations, deceptive websites, and malicious contracts that ultimately siphon off users\u2019 funds."
