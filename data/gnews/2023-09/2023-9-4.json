It offers cryptocurrencies a touchpoint with dividend-paying stocks, and helps reduce the immateriality of crypto. For many, crypto is entirely untethered from reality \u2013 prices fluctuate randomly, and most people never encounter blockchains while going about their lives. In fact, one of the most popular complaints of crypto is the supposed lack of intrinsic value to any of these assets."

        "title": "These Problems Need to be Solved to Fix Ethereum\u2019s Centralization Issues: Vitalik Buterin - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has listed several problems that need to be handled to fix the issue of centralization on the leading smart contract blockchain.\n\nDuring the ongoing Korea Blockchain Week (KBW), Buterin revealed that the centralization of nodes is one of the major problems. He recommended that the challenge be fixed by reducing the cost of running nodes and making such activities less difficult.\n\nFixing Ethereum\u2019s Centralization Issues\n\nData from Ethereum mainnet statistics shows that most of the network\u2019s nodes are run through centralized entities \u2013 roughly 60% handled by Amazon Web Services (AWS) and 6% run by Google Cloud. This means that AWS runs 1,810 nodes out of the 5,901 active Ethereum nodes while Google Cloud handles 186.\n\nThe centralization issue has raised concerns about the Ethereum blockchain facing the challenge of a single point of failure. Some industry experts have also warned that Amazon founder Jeff Bezos could shut down Ethereum-based decentralized applications by simply turning off AWS.\n\nSpeaking at the KBW event, Buterin said the node centralization problem is a \u201cbig piece of the puzzle\u201d to make sure Ethereum remains decentralized in the long run. He explained that statelessness is an essential technology in making it easier for people to run nodes.\n\nAs the Ethereum Foundation noted in a report about statelessness, decentralization is impossible if the benefits of running a node are only available to users with expensive hardware. Statelessness involves the ability of a network to validate blocks without relying on any centralized service providers.\n\n\u201cToday, it takes hundreds of gigabytes of data to run a node. With stateless clients, you can run a node on basically zero\u2026 In the longer term there\u2019s a plan to maintain fully verified Ethereum nodes where you could literally run it on your phone,\u201d Buterin said, disclosing that Ethereum will take significant steps towards statelessness during the upcoming Verge and Purge upgrades.\n\nEthereum Statelessness to be Fixed in 20 Years\n\nWhile statelessness is a major part of the Ethereum roadmap, the network\u2019s founder mentioned that the issue would most likely be fixed in ten to twenty years.\n\nNevertheless, Buterin outlined other steps that can be taken to enhance Ethereum\u2019s decentralization, including easing documentation, eliminating barriers to distributed staking, and making staking more secure and convenient.\n\nMeanwhile, the computer programmer stated that achieving higher levels of scalability is currently the most pressing concern for the Ethereum network."

        "content": "\u201cFor those of us who\u2019ve been paying attention to crypto over the last couple of years, hacks are still incredibly real,\u201d says Mike Ippolito.\n\nSecurity in crypto ecosystems is often judged by what\u2019s called the Lindy effect: The longer a technology hasn\u2019t failed, the more likely it is to continue to not fail.\n\nWith all the potential value swirling around in liquid staking, such ecosystems tend to be attractive targets for unscrupulous attacks. Lido stands alone as the liquid staking leader on Ethereum, at least in part thanks to its history of maintaining solid security in a self-fulfilling Lindy loop.\n\n\u201cIn order for you to justify not using the product or service of a leader,\u201d Ippolito says on the Bell Curve podcast (Spotify/Apple), \u201cthe [competing] product has to be an order [or] two orders of magnitude better, and there\u2019s just not that much to really differentiate within liquid staking.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s this \u201cLindy-ness\u201d that leads to liquidity, Ippolito says, which is ultimately what users want from a liquid staking protocol.\n\nSolana\u2019s liquid staking game\n\nDue to the history of successful security on Lido, Ippolito expects it to remain the dominant liquid staking system on Ethereum. But he doesn\u2019t necessarily expect this pattern to carry over to other blockchains. \u201cLido made a pretty unsuccessful play into Solana a while ago,\u201d he says.\n\nReferring to a conversation with Chorus One chief information officer Xavier Meegan, Ippolito explains that Lido\u2019s network effects on Ethereum failed to travel to the Solana ecosystem. He expects to see a liquid staking provider eventually \u201ctake off\u201d on Solana in a similar way that Lido has on Ethereum. \u201cMaybe that\u2019s JitoSOL. Maybe it\u2019s Marinade. I think they\u2019re the front-runner today,\u201d he says.\n\nIn the conversation Ippolito had with Meegan, the CIO described the chicken-egg problem that Solana faces with liquid staking popularity, currently experiencing much lower DeFi traffic and total value locked (TVL) than Ethereum enjoys.\n\nBut the lack of \u201cLindy-ness\u201d \u2014 a long history of network security \u2014 coincides with more opportunities for growth in a younger system that sees more competitors vying for dominance in a less established market, Meegan said.\n\nAssociate at the advisory and investment firm Reverie, Myles O\u2019Neil doesn\u2019t expect to see any \u201cbig technical disruption\u201d that would unseat the existing incumbents in liquid staking\u2019s near future on Ethereum. He suggests that yield is one area in which up-and-comers could attempt to compete, but says it\u2019s \u201cunclear exactly where that stacks up versus brand, security and Lindy.\u201d\n\nOffering one or two extra percentage points yield does not \u201cmove the needle enough to unseat Lido,\u201d O\u2019Neil argues, noting that the service\u2019s liquid staking token (LST) is \u201cnot the highest yielding LST\u201d by a large margin, yet it has managed to maintain dominance in Ethereum.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see a lot of winners here,\u201d O\u2019Neil says.\n\n\u201cLido is really well positioned for Ethereum,\u201d he says, adding that he is less certain of how the liquid staking game plays out on Solana. \u201cIt is a little bit more fragmented over there,\u201d he says, with more possibilities for competition.\n\nIppolito notes that liquid staking on Solana won\u2019t necessarily ever attract the same kind of activity as it does on Ethereum. A major reason for this difference, Ippolito says, is the blockchain\u2019s unique ability to be more liquid than Ethereum in the first place. \u201cThe more the protocol does on its own, the less opportunity there is available for external liquid staking providers.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "Can Ethereum Reach $3,000? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Despite a rocky end to the summer, Ethereum (ETH -1.21%) is still up 37% for the year. But it has largely disappointed crypto investors who were expecting it to skyrocket in value after a key event this time last year.\n\nAfter surging past the $2,000 mark in mid-April, Ethereum has had a difficult time regaining the $2,000 level over the past four months, and bullish sentiment around the digital currency is clearly fading.\n\nCan Ethereum mount another rally to hit the $3,000 level? There are three key factors to consider. If it can deliver on all three, then the chances for a bull market rally become much higher. Let's take a closer look.\n\n1. Remain the market leader\n\nThe good news is that Ethereum continues to be the market leader in just about every niche of the blockchain and crypto world.\n\nTake non-fungible tokens (NFTs), for example. This is the one area where Ethereum first burst into prominence for many crypto investors, thanks to the emergence of best-selling NFT collections such as the Bored Ape Yacht Club and CryptoPunks.\n\nBased on current NFT sales data, these two collections continue to remain among the most valuable, and Ethereum continues to remain the No. 1 player in the NFT world on the basis of overall sales volume.\n\nIt's much the same story in decentralized finance (DeFi), another key niche of the blockchain world. Based on the latest data for total value locked (TVL), the leading metric used to assess overall DeFi strength, Ethereum remains No. 1 in DeFi as well.\n\nIn fact, it accounts for an astounding 57% of all TVL in the blockchain world. Yes, new entrants such as Base, the new blockchain from Coinbase Global, have been getting a lot of buzz of late, but no other blockchain even comes close to Ethereum.\n\n2. Deliver on a new strategic plan\n\nThat being said, I'm not expecting Ethereum to rest on its laurels. Yes, the change to a proof-of-stake model, known colloquially as \"The Merge,\" was by all accounts a technical tour de force, and yes, the crypto remains the market leader in many categories. But there are plenty of top-tier rivals nipping at its heels. So there is a need to continue to produce innovations and new market opportunities.\n\nThat's why I've been keeping a close eye on Ethereum's post-Merge road map, which can be thought of as its long-term strategic plan. It suggests that the crypto is hardly finished when it comes to updating, improving, and expanding the range of functionality of its blockchain.\n\nIn fact, co-founder Vitalik Buterin has outlined five new stages of development that outline upcoming technical changes to the Ethereum blockchain and what they will mean in terms of future performance.\n\nFor example, one of the next goals is to boost processing speeds on the blockchain to 100,000 transactions per second. That could create new opportunities to make it a world-class payments network, on par with today's top credit-card processing networks.\n\n3. Stay clear of regulators\n\nLastly, there's the issue of the ongoing regulatory crackdown on cryptocurrency. In February, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) started looking into crypto staking, which is vital to any proof-of-stake blockchain such as Ethereum.\n\nThen, in June, the SEC spooked the markets with lawsuits filed against top cryptocurrency exchanges Coinbase Global and Binance. And the SEC continues to hunt for cryptos that it believes to be unregistered securities.\n\nThrough it all, Ethereum has remained relatively unscathed. The problem, though, is that regulatory risk is never going to go away completely. SEC head Gary Gensler has never specifically targeted Ethereum, but he has sent plenty of signals that he might want to take a closer look at staking on the platform.\n\nThe long-term outlook\n\nAs long as Ethereum retains its leadership in key markets, delivers on its strategic plan, and remains free and clear of crypto's regulatory crackdown, I'm highly confident that it has the potential to reach the $3,000 mark.\n\nThat might sound like an aggressive goal, given that it represents a nearly 80% hike from today's price, but just keep in mind that Ethereum's all-time high from just two years ago is $4,891.70. For now, I'm both short-term and long-term bullish on Ethereum's prospects."

        "title": "What Is Ethereum Sharding? A Beginner's Guide - Unchained - Unchained",
        "content": "Read through this guide to learn what Ethereum sharding is and why it is important to help scale the Ethereum network.\n\nThe Ethereum developer community has been keen to address the blockchain\u2019s prevalent scalability challenges via development updates. Following the shift to proof of stake (PoS), the next scalability step is Ethereum sharding.\n\nRead on as we define sharding, explain how it works on the Ethereum network, and highlight its importance.\n\nWhat Is Sharding?\n\nSharding is a scaling solution aimed at improving the Ethereum network\u2019s capacity and transaction speed.\n\nThe Ethereum \u201cmainnet\u201d is divided into smaller, interconnected networks called \u201cshards.\u201d Each shard processes its own transactions and smart contracts parallel to the others, significantly increasing the network\u2019s throughput and helping to reduce gas fees.\n\nSharding also helps to decentralize the Ethereum network as it reduces the load on individual nodes by distributing the transaction load across many nodes.\n\nHow Does Ethereum Sharding Work?\n\nEthereum sharding starts with the division of the network into multiple sections. Each shard handles a set of nodes that process transactions. Consequently, the nodes in each shard process transactions that belong to that shard. The validators on each shard verify the transactions and maintain the state.\n\nAllocation to a shard is random and requires validators to have a stake to participate. Under the proof of stake consensus mechanism, a validator stakes a certain amount of ETH for their participation.\n\nThe sharding technique departs from the current transaction processing format, where all nodes are involved in every transaction. Cross-shard communication prevents role duplication, with shards sharing information about their transactions.\n\nCurrently, full nodes take up plenty of space and continually increase in size as more users join the platform. Sharding reduces node sizes since users only need to store a part of Ethereum\u2019s transactional information.\n\nBenefits and Drawbacks of Sharding Ethereum\n\nSharding Ethereum presents various benefits and drawbacks. Here\u2019s a look at the most significant ones.\n\nPros\n\nIncreased Efficiency & Scalability\n\nInstead of a single chain processing transaction, sharding enables parallel processing, which increases the number of transactions. This will go a long way in rivaling Web2 transaction speeds. Payment systems such as MasterCard and Visa process up to 24,000 transactions per second (TPS), while Ethereum currently stands at 20-30 TPS.\n\nIncreased Participation\n\nSharding offers the opportunity to scale without compromising transaction security. Ultimately, people can validate transactions without specialized hardware or high electricity consumption.\n\nCons\n\nAttack Vulnerabilities\n\nWith transaction processing broken down to the shards level, attackers could potentially target a single unit. If such an action were successful, the bad actors could share information on invalid transactions with other shards, potentially compromising the entire network\u2019s security.\n\nCentralization Concerns\n\nThe possibility of collusion arises with the splitting of nodes into smaller groups. Such collusion could potentially lead to a form of centralization that goes against the ethos of Web3.\n\nHowever, danksharding is a possible solution to the challenge of ensuring diversity and randomness in the composition of the committee members.\n\nSmart Contract Compatibility\n\nDevelopers may need to modify their smart contract codes since not all may be compatible with sharding. For those already live on the network with no upgrade option, that may present a challenge in their execution due to the incompatibility.\n\nWhy Is Sharding Important?\n\nSharding offers a solution to the high gas fees and low transaction speeds that hinder the use of the Ethereum mainchain from mass adoption.\n\nOverly optimistic projections suggest sharding could help hit 100,000 transactions per second. Such speeds would present Ethereum as a convenient payment infrastructure that could rival mainstream payment rails.\n\nWith the number of participating nodes increasing, the power distribution also increases (provided there\u2019s no collusion). This would lead to increased security as a highly decentralized network lacks a single point of failure.\n\nSuccessful sharding implementation could open up new use cases for Ethereum as more businesses could choose to embrace the fast and secure transactions the network could provide. However, the successful implementation of sharding relies on the Ethereum developer community identifying potential challenges and developing solutions."

        "content": "Less than a week after Vitalik Buterin, one of the co-founders of Ethereum, sold his Maker (MKR) stash for ETH, one crypto whale has done the opposite. On-chain data on September 4 shows that one Ethereum holder sold 694 ETH, worth roughly $1.13 million when writing, for 1,010 MKR. At the time of the swap, MKR was changing hands at $1,122.\n\nWhale Swaps ETH For MKR\n\nAs of September 4, the address, \u201c0x3737,\u201d had over $20.37 million worth of assets. While the whale trades against Vitalik and doubles down on MKR, zooming in on the address\u2019s portfolio shows that the largest holding is ETH.\n\nThe address holds 10,000 ETH worth $16.3 million at spot rates, representing over 75% of the total portfolio. Meanwhile, some of his other major holdings include Arbitrum (ARB), worth $2.9 million, and MKR, worth $1.1 million.\n\nMKR, the token issued by MakerDAO, the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that controls the minting of DAI, a stablecoin on Ethereum, has been ripping higher in the last few months.\n\nMKR plays a key role in stabilizing DAO and is used as a last resort. Holders participate in governance, voting on proposals that best stabilize the algorithmic stablecoin, deciding collateral types accepted, stability fee adjustments, and others.\n\nFrom June, MKR has more than doubled, rising 125% to peak at around $1,300 in early August. It is now trading at over $1,100, up 13% from August lows.\n\nMaker Presents Endgame\n\nThe token\u2019s surge has been attributed to multiple factors, specifically the release of the \u201cEndgame\u201d roadmap. Under this plan, MakerDAO plans to, among other things, release their blockchain, rebrand, and introduce two more tokens.\n\nThis move is significant because MakerDAO is among the first decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. According to DeFiLlama data, the protocol has a total value locked (TVL) of over $5 billion. It is the largest decentralized money market in the world.\n\nMeanwhile, DAI, its algorithmic yield-earning stablecoin, has been stable recently and is the largest in Ethereum. At press time, DAI had a market cap of $5.3 billion, perched at 12th on the leaderboard. At this pace, DAI is the third-largest stablecoin after USDT and USDC.\n\nVitalik Buterin, despite the stellar performance of MKR relative to the broader crypto market, liquidated $580,000 worth of MKR after MakerDAO\u2019s co-founder, Rune Christensen, said it was considering launching a new blockchain bridging to Ethereum that\u2019s based on Solana\u2019s code. The new blockchain, dubbed NewChain, is part of MakerDAO\u2019s roadmap, \u201cEndgame\u201d.\n\nFeature image from Canva, chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEthereum's price has been doing this intriguing dance lately, and if you are not paying close attention, you might just miss the beat. The spotlight here is on a less-talked-about but potent indicator: the RSI divergence. Now, RSI or relative strength index tells you how fast or slow the price is moving. And right now, it is whispering something worth listening to.\n\nSo, let's get into the nitty-gritty. Ethereum is currently priced at around $1,631.95. Not too shabby, but here's where it gets interesting. The RSI is climbing up the ladder, while Ethereum's price is taking the elevator down. It's like they are at a crossroads, waving at each other from opposite directions. This divergence is a classic reversal pattern. If this plays out, Ethereum could be making a U-turn toward its next resistance level.\n\nBut investors should not get carried away. The RSI divergence is a strong hint, but it is not set in stone. So, while the RSI is giving us a hopeful wink, it is wise to keep both feet on the ground.\n\nXRP takes another chance\n\nJust when you think it's down for the count, XRP surprises you. Despite the recent plunge below the 200 EMA, XRP is showing signs of life. As of the latest data, it is trading at approximately $0.50, a modest but noteworthy uptick.\n\nNow, let's add some context. Remember the SEC v. Ripple case? XRP had a moment in the sun when the outcome swung in its favor. But fast-forward to today, and it's like that victory never happened. The asset has shed all its gains, painting a rather grim picture of both the market and itself. But here is the kicker: XRP is not throwing in the towel.\n\nThe current price level might not be headline-grabbing, but it is a start. It's like XRP is gathering its energy, eyeing the resistance level as if it is the final boss in a video game. And in a market that has been less than kind, even a small win counts.\n\nSo, what's the takeaway here? XRP is in a challenging spot, no doubt. But it is also showing the kind of resilience that you cannot ignore. It's like the asset is whispering, \"Hey, I'm still here, and I'm not going anywhere.\" Whether this is the beginning of a significant rally or just a brief respite is anyone's guess.\n\nShiba Inu's future invalidated\n\nShiba Inu (SHIB) is like that mysterious character in a thriller novel; just when you think you have figured it out, it throws a curveball. Case in point: the recent invalidation of its symmetrical triangle pattern. For those who have been tracking SHIB, this pattern was a road map, a guide to where the asset might head next. But now, it's like someone just ripped that page out of the book. As of the latest data, SHIB is trading at approximately $0.00000779.\n\nBut let's not get lost in the maze. The invalidation of the pattern is not the end of the story; it is more like a plot twist. While the price might seem stagnant, there is a pulse beneath the surface. The Shiba Inu network's burn rate has skyrocketed by 500%. That is not just a number; it is a heartbeat, a sign of growing network activity.\n\nNow, let's add another layer to this narrative. The crypto market is a fickle beast, swayed by everything from global events to investor sentiment. In such a volatile landscape, the invalidated pattern could either be a stumbling block or a stepping stone for SHIB. It's like the asset is at a crossroads, and it is anyone's guess which path it will take."

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s network has witnessed an astonishing surge, with over 467,000 unique address interactions in a single day, marking the highest activity level since the frenzy of Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) announcements began back on June 16th, Santiment reported.\n\nETH Unique Addresses Rises After ETH ETF Filings\n\nThis surge in activity comes after the anticipation surrounding the potential approval of Ethereum ETFs by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). ETFs, which show that cryptocurrencies are becoming widely accepted, have the potential to make it simpler for institutional and ordinary investors to purchase Ethereum (ETH) and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nadvertisement\n\nIncreased activity as a result of this extensive adoption frequently raises the asset\u2019s worth. ETH is trading at $1,639.36, with a 0.36% increase in the last 24 hours.\n\nIn a recent SEC filing on August 24th, Ark Invest and 21Shares were listed as sub-advisors for a joint Ethereum ETF product. The filing highlighted that Ethereum\u2019s future value hinges on its widespread adoption, emphasizing that any changes in this aspect could significantly impact its price.\n\nThe possibility that the SEC may approve the introduction of Ether ETFs as early as October has recently emerged, adding to the frenzy. A recent Bloomberg report further fuelled optimism, indicating that the SEC is leaning towards allowing the first exchange-traded funds based on Ether futures. This prospective action is viewed as a major triumph by numerous businesses who have long sought the chance to provide such products.\n\nNotably, nearly a dozen companies, including Volatility Shares Trust, Bitwise Ethereum Strategy ETF, Roundhill Ether Strategy ETF, VanEck\u2019s Ethereum Strategy ETF, ProShares Short Ether Strategy ETF, and the Grayscale Ethereum Futures ETF, are all waiting for approval from the SEC. However, Bitwise has submitted a request to withdraw its ETF application for the Bitcoin and Ethereum Market Cap Strategy.\n\nAlso Read: Crypto Prices Today: Market Mostly Bullish With Pepe Coin, XLM And SNX Showing Gains\n\nGood Road Ahead For ETH\n\nThe surge in unique address interactions on the Ethereum network is not merely a statistical blip; it signifies a powerful indicator of heightened utility. In the realm of cryptocurrencies, the value of assets like Ethereum is intrinsically linked to their utility.\n\nThe cryptocurrency community anxiously anticipates a potential inflow of investors and more activity that could further lift the value of Ethereum and set the way for an exciting new chapter in the world of digital assets as the SEC\u2019s decision on Ethereum ETFs approaches.\n\nAlso Read: Next Massive Shibarium Updates Teased by Top Developer"

        "content": "The centralization of nodes is one of the biggest problems facing the Ethereum network and should be addressed by making the running of nodes cheaper and easier, according to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin.\n\nCurrently, the majority of the 5,901 active Ethereum nodes are being run through centralized web providers like Amazon Web Services, which many experts claim leaves the Ethereum blockchain exposed to a centralized point of failure.\n\nDistribution of Ethereum nodes from web service providers. Source: Ethernodes\n\nSpeaking at Korea Blockchain Week, Buterin outlined six key problems that need addressing to solve centralization but highlighted that the node issue was a \u201cbig piece of the puzzle\u201d to ensure the Ethereum network remains decentralized in the long run.\n\n\u201cOne of those six things is making it technically easier for people to run nodes and statelessness is one of the really important technologies in doing that right,\u201d he explained.\n\n\u201cToday, it takes hundreds of gigabytes of data to run a node. With stateless clients, you can run a node on basically zero.\u201d\n\nThe concept of statelessness refers to removing the reliance on centralized service providers to verify activity on the network. According to the Ethereum Foundation, true decentralization is not possible until node operators can run Ethereum on modest and inexpensive hardware.\n\nAs Buterin noted, statelessness forms a key component of the Ethereum roadmap, with major steps towards statelessness being made in \u201cThe Verge\u201d and \u201cThe Purge\u201d stages:\n\n\u201cIn the longer term there\u2019s a plan to maintain fully verified Ethereum nodes where you could literally it on your phone.\u201d\n\nDespite statelessness forming a core part of the Ethereum roadmap, Buterin admitted that these highly-technical concerns were unlikely to be addressed any time in the immediate future.\n\n\u201cThese technical problems will have to be addressed eventually \u2014 maybe a 10-year timescale, maybe a 20-year timescale,\u201d he said.\n\nRelated: Ethereum staking services agree to 22% limit of all validators\n\nOutside of statelessness, Buterin said the next most significant moves toward decreasing Ethereum centralization included making documentation easier, lowering barriers to distributed staking, ensuring staking was more secure and more broadly, making it more convenient to stake Ether (ETH) in general.\n\nUltimately however, Buterin concluded that the most time-sensitive and pressing concern for Ethereum as whole was achieving higher levels of scalability.\n\nAt present, Ethereum scaling protocols dominate the use of zero-knowledge (ZK) rollups.\n\nZK-rollups have been lauded by many within the Ethereum community as a key tool to achieving scalability, as ZK-rollups work to improve throughput on the main Ethereum chain by moving computation and state storage off-chain.\n\nCollect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space.\n\nMagazine: Here\u2019s how Ethereum\u2019s ZK-rollups can become interoperable"

Discover SCENE\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalk Buterin believes that future upgrades to the network could make it possible to run full nodes on mobile devices, helping to decentralize the network and improve its scalability.\n\nSpeaking during Korea Blockchain Week, Buterin addressed the decentralization and scalability challenges facing the Ethereum mainnet, as initially reported by CoinTelegraph.\n\n\u201cIn the longer term there\u2019s a plan to maintain fully verified Ethereum nodes where you could literally run it on your phone,\u201d Buterin told the conference, reiterating a point on the Ethereum roadmap.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFull nodes are computing devices that validate and verify all transactions and smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nCurrently, a full node requires hardware specifications including a solid state drive (SSD) larger than 2TB, along with 16 GB RAM. These requirements have increased the level of centralization, with most full nodes run on centralized servers like Amazon Web Services.\n\nButerin highlighted six key problems that must be addressed in order to solve centralization of the Ethereum network, calling full nodes a \u201cbig piece of the puzzle\u201d in the pursuit of greater decentralization on Ethereum.\n\nHe pointed to Ethereum\u2019s roadmap, which includes \u201cstateless clients\u201d using \u201cVerkle Trees,\u201d as a means of significantly reducing the hardware requirements for running full nodes on the network. He noted that, \u201cToday, it takes hundreds of gigabytes of data to run a node. With stateless clients, you can run a node on basically zero.\u201d\n\nStatelessness involves reducing the network\u2019s reliance from all nodes needing to store the entire state of the Ethereum blockchain to only requiring limited space for validating transactions. In a recent blog post, the Ethereum Foundation outlined the concept of weak statelessness, in which only block producers need access to full state data, while verifiers don\u2019t require the entire data.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHowever, Buterin also mentioned that implementation of statelessness comes with \u201ctechnical problems,\u201d which may be resolved in a \u201c10-year timescale, maybe a 20-year timescale.\u201d\n\nDistribution of staked ETH\n\nButerin also tackled other centralization concerns, including the need for a more widespread distribution of staked ETH and making documentation easier for developers and users.\n\nIn a recent message posted to the Reflexer Finance Discord community, he recommended adding \"non-dominant forms of staked ETH (excluding Lido)\" as new collateral options on the stablecoin lending platform.\n\nLido currently accounts for more than one-third of the total staked ETH, which has raised centralization concerns.\n\nLastly, Buterin emphasized that scalability remains the most pressing issue, with progress being made through the adoption of rollup solutions, especially those based on zero-knowledge proofs."

This indicated that the altcoin\u2019s futures market has become rife with more sell orders than buy orders.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nThe taker buy-sell ratio is a metric that measures the ratio between the buy volume and sell volume in an asset\u2019s futures market. A value greater than 1 indicates more buy volume than sell volume, while a value less than 1 indicates more sell volume than buy volume.\n\nAccording to a recently published report by CryptoQuant analyst who goes by the pseudonym \u2018Greatest_Trader,\u2019 ETH\u2019s taker buy-sell ratio has spent the past few months in a \u201cdownward trajectory\u201d to reach a yearly low at the end of last month.\n\nThe analyst said,\n\n\u201cThis consistent behavior underscores the dominant bearish sentiment among futures traders participating in Ethereum\u2019s market.\u201d\n\nThrough it all, market participants have continued to \u201clong\u201d ETH\n\nAn assessment of ETH\u2019s futures open interest confirms the trend. At $4.67 billion at press time, the coin\u2019s open interest was at its lowest mark so far this year. It began its descent on 19 April and has since fallen by 36%, data from Coinglass revealed.\n\nSince the open interest decline began, ETH has fallen from its $2000 psychological price level and has since failed to reclaim it. In the last 138 days, the coin has mostly traded in a tight range between $1600 and $1800.\n\nWith the context of recent market movements in mind, ETH\u2019s price consolidation and the attendant decline in its open interest show that the alt\u2019s holders have spent the past few months unwinding their large speculative positions as sentiment grows poorer.\n\nThe fall in open interest can also be due to cyclical factors, such as summer doldrums. Since June, the general market has traded sideways, with very few periods of price jumps.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nHowever, while the daily count of open positions in ETH\u2019s futures market has dwindled in the past few months, funding rates across leading cryptocurrency exchanges have been significantly positive.\n\nApart from the severe decline experienced on 12 March, ETH\u2019s funding rates have been positive for most of the year. This suggests that long positions have continued to outpace short positions in spite of sideways price movements."

He has also interviewed a few prominent experts within the cryptocurrency space.\n\nStory Highlights Ethereum is facing a problem with node centralization.\n\nVitalik Buterin proposed a solution called stateless clients.\n\nStatelessness will be introduced gradually into Ethereum's ecosystem.\n\nEthereum is facing a big issue. Too many of its computer servers, known as nodes, are run by a few big companies. This goes against the idea of decentralization that blockchain aims for. Addressing this issue, Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum\u2019s co-founder, took the spotlight at Korea Blockchain Week to outline potential solutions.\n\nHere\u2019s what happened.\n\nToo Many Eggs in One Basket?\n\nRight now, big service providers like Amazon host more than 5900 of Ethereum\u2019s nodes. This is risky because if Amazon has a problem, Ethereum could too. Buterin says it\u2019s crucial to make it easier and cheaper for regular people to run these nodes.\n\nVitalik Buterin's concerns about node centralization on Ethereum are valid and highlight a critical issue in the blockchain space. Centralization of nodes on services like AWS could potentially make the network more vulnerable to outages and censorship. The timeline of up to 20\u2026 \u2014 Crypto Simon (@TheCryptoSimon) September 5, 2023\n\nButerin introduced a revolutionary concept to tackle this issue\u2014statelessness. Running an Ethereum node currently demands an extensive storage capacity of hundreds of gigabytes. Stateless clients aim to drastically reduce these resource requirements. This approach not only encourages wider individual participation but also bolsters Ethereum\u2019s resilience against centralization risks.\n\nA Glimpse into \u2018The Verge\u2019 and \u2018The Purge\u2019\n\nButerin is known for his long-view approach, and he did not disappoint. Unveiling stages with names straight out of a sci-fi novel\u2014\u201cThe Verge\u201d and \u201cThe Purge\u201d\u2014he described how statelessness will be incrementally introduced into Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem.

He cited zero-knowledge (ZK) rollups, a technology designed to move computations off-chain, as a pivotal element in resolving Ethereum\u2019s throughput bottlenecks.\n\nTo round off a week of compelling developments, Buterin also made some notable transfers of Ether and Maker tokens. These financial maneuvers have stirred speculation, adding yet another layer to the complex narrative surrounding Ethereum\u2019s future.\n\nThe road ahead\n\nWhile immediate solutions may be elusive, the groundwork laid at Korea Blockchain Week reflects a depth of understanding and a commitment to long-term viability.

        "title": "Ethereum: Buy the Dip? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Almost exactly one year since it pulled off The Merge, Ethereum (ETH -1.20%) seems to be falling out of favor with crypto investors. After a fast start to the year, Ethereum is now down 10% over the past 30 days and more than 20% from its mid-April highs. Moreover, some investors are warning that Ethereum could have further to fall before it recovers to the $2,000 price level.\n\nFor investors thinking about \"buying the dip\" on Ethereum, there are two major points of concern to consider. Let's take a closer look.\n\nDrop in user activity and transaction volume\n\nFirst and most importantly, there has been a significant decline in transaction volume and overall activity taking place directly on the Ethereum blockchain. For example, transaction volume recently hit a nine-month low, while daily transaction fees recently hit an eight-month low. The growing consensus seems to be that users have lost interest in the Ethereum blockchain, and that they may be moving elsewhere.\n\nIf true, that could be worrisome, because it could mean a long-term decline in areas such as non-fungible tokens (NFTs), where Ethereum has historically been dominant. Using any type of valuation model, you would then need to downgrade Ethereum's future prospects, resulting in a lower long-term price target.\n\nHowever, there could be a plausible explanation for the drop-off in transaction activity: Users are simply choosing to execute their transactions on faster, cheaper Layer 2 blockchains that sit on top of the core Layer 1 Ethereum blockchain. As a result, all Ethereum-related activity is simply not being captured by traditional metrics.\n\nFor example, the buzziest blockchain of the summer was Base, the new blockchain project from Coinbase Global (COIN 1.38%). Well, Base just so happens to be a Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum. And there are several other Layer 2 blockchains that are performing well right now, suggesting the overall Ethereum ecosystem is still in good shape.\n\nSelling by insiders and whales\n\nThe other major factor to consider is the sudden turn in investor sentiment about Ethereum that started to take place around mid-April. At the time, Ethereum was trading around $2,140, and was up big for the year. But there has been a steady wave of selling by so-called Ethereum \"whales\" (those holding between 10 ETH and 10,000 ETH in their crypto wallets) over the past four months. Theoretically, these whales are the smart money in the crypto market. If they are selling, what do they know that we don't?\n\nPerhaps even more worrisome, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin could be among those who are selling off their Ethereum positions. After monitoring the multiple public wallets that Buterin uses, crypto tracking services have found that Buterin has transferred nearly $6 million in Ethereum to other crypto wallets over the past month. Some have interpreted this to be a red flag, similar to corporate insiders selling their shares when they know the price is headed down.\n\nBut, again, I think there's a plausible explanation here. The sell-off in mid-April also coincided with the Shapella tech upgrade, which made it possible for investors to remove their staked Ethereum for the first time. In March and April, there were numerous concerns that this could lead to selling pressure on Ethereum, as many early Ethereum backers locked in profits on their positions. That's probably what's happening now.\n\nAnd what about Buterin? I hardly think he's panicking about the price of Ethereum. Instead, a better explanation is that he's simply redistributing his funds among different crypto wallets in order to protect them from hackers and cyber criminals. This is standard practice in the crypto industry.\n\nIs the market overreacting?\n\nOverall, I think this could be a classic \"buy the dip\" opportunity for Ethereum. From my perspective, the crypto market seems to be overreacting to the downside, viewing each new piece of news as more proof that Ethereum has suddenly lost its mojo.\n\nBut guess what? Ethereum is still best-in-class in just about every business segment, including NFTs and decentralized finance (DeFi). It is still seeing a strong upswing in developer activity, and Buterin has already shared a long-term roadmap for Ethereum that contains even more upgrades, improvements, and performance tweaks. And while Bitcoin (BTC -1.05%) may be getting all the attention from institutional investors now due to the imminent launch of a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund, that doesn't mean that they have forgotten about Ethereum.\n\nAs a long-term investment play, then, Ethereum still makes a lot of sense. If you believe that the market is overreacting right now, buying the dip now could be a way to add to your Ethereum position at a lower price."

        "title": "Ether price risks losing the $1.6K support as multiple ETH price metrics decline - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Ether's price surged by 31.3% from March 10 to March 18, coinciding with the Federal Reserve\u2019s injection of $300 billion to address the insolvency of Silicon Valley Bank. Since then, Ether\u2019s (ETH) price has consistently maintained a daily closing price above $1,600.\n\nHowever, investors are now casting doubt on Ether\u2019s ability to sustain this support level, given the prevailing bearish sentiment in the cryptocurrency space and declining metrics on the Ethereum network.\n\nOver the past six months, the cryptocurrency sector has been plagued by negative developments. Notably, the Digital Currency Group (DCG), the owner of the Grayscale mutual fund manager, has faced financial troubles. Concerns are mounting that a portion of the $4.8 billion worth of ETH deposits held in the Grayscale Ethereum Trust could be liquidated to address DCG's debts.\n\nFurthermore, two major global exchanges, Binance and Coinbase, are currently facing legal action from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Additionally, investors initially expressed excitement when several requests for futures-based Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) surfaced in early August. However, it's important to note that these instruments, unlike spot ETFs, would not involve actual ETH coins if approved.\n\nOn-chain metrics point to declining demand\n\nAside from a handful of unfavorable market conditions, Ethereum\u2019s on-chain metrics point to a stagnation in demand, both in terms of ETH investments and smart contract transactions.\n\nNumber of Ethereum addresses with a minimum $1,000 deposit in ETH. Source: Coin Metrics\n\nNotably, the number of Ethereum addresses holding a minimum of $1,000 worth of ETH deposits has reached its lowest level in nearly six months. This is concerning, considering that Ether\u2019s price reached a peak of $2,130 in mid-April, which should have attracted new investors.\n\nPart of the lack of investor interest can be attributed to the fact that Ethereum\u2019s average transaction fee has remained above $4 for the past six months. Consequently, despite fluctuations in network staking metrics, there appears to be no increase in the total number of investors when using the $1,000 threshold as a proxy.\n\nMoreover, data on decentralized application (DApps) activity on the Ethereum network corroborates the notion of a dearth of new users.\n\nEthereum network top DApps, 30-day active addresses. Source: DappRadar\n\nEven excluding the significant 60% decline in the Uniswap NFT Aggregator, the average number of active addresses across the top Ethereum network DApps decreased by 4% compared to the previous month.\n\nFrom cryptocurrency games to decentralized exchanges, nonfungible token marketplaces and Web3 services, every sector has witnessed a decline in the number of active users, according to DappRadar. Regarding token activity on the network, with the exception of stablecoins and Wrapped ETH, no project has recorded more than 13,000 unique receiver addresses over the past week.\n\nTop token by unique receivers, last 7 days. Source: Etherscan\n\nThis analysis underscores the fact that Ethereum\u2019s network is currently constrained by its relatively high transaction fees, which limits the number of active users. Without an uptick in network activity, the catalysts for a price recovery are lacking, such as potential network upgrades and implementations that could lead to lower costs or enhanced user privacy.\n\nCompetitors are benefiting from the stablecoin volumes\n\nIn the meantime, recent developments have left Ethereum enthusiasts somewhat disappointed. Visa, the payment processor, has incorporated Solana blockchain settlement capabilities, following Circle\u2019s USD Coin (USDC) introducing native accounts and transfers on the Base chain. In response, Coinbase promptly announced its intention to assist partners in converting old, bridged versions of USDC to the new format.\n\nFurthermore, Rune Christensen, co-founder of MakerDAO, has put forth a proposal to develop the decentralized finance project's upcoming native chain based on Solana's codebase despite its longstanding affiliation with Ethereum.\n\nIn light of the prevailing bearish sentiment in the cryptocurrency market, which includes exchanges facing legal challenges from the SEC and diminishing interest in cryptocurrencies, as indicated by the latest Google Trends data, the likelihood of Ether\u2019s price dipping below the $1,600 support level has increased.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

        "content": "Matter Labs co-founder and CEO Alex Gluchowski has proposed an Ethereum court system resembling a hierarchical court system similar to the real world.\n\nIn a Sept. 2 post on X (Twitter), Gluchowski floated the idea for an \u201cEthereum Supreme Court\u201d \u2014 which would work similarly to the United States Supreme Court \u2014 serving as a final stop for parties to dispute smart contract issues rather than needing to take matters to a traditional lawyer or court.\n\n\u201cThe most important function of such a system will be to protect protocols against political inference from the outside. It will serve as a great deterrence mechanism, and will elevate the role of Ethereum as a powerful network state,\u201d said Gluchowski.\n\nSmart contract implementation risks remain the biggest unsolved problem of Defi. L2s are equally affected.\n\n\n\nLet me pitch an idea: L1 Fork as the Court of Final Appeal.\n\n\n\nFirst, why existing solutions don't work:\n\n\n\n1) Time-locked upgrades are great for scheduled changes, but\u2026 pic.twitter.com/EcaogkZBH9 \u2014 Alex G. \u220e (@gluk64) September 2, 2023\n\nAccording to Gluchowski\u2019s concept, disputes and emergency upgrades would be handled by a hierarchical system of on-chain courts. The final stop, however, would be an Ethereum layer-1 soft fork as the \u201cCourt of Final Appeal.\u201d\n\nGluchowski said that in this system, every protocol would have its own governance with normal and emergency upgrade mechanisms, and would also designate a special contract which can trigger an appeal.\n\nWhen there is an emergency upgrade to a protocol, there would be an appeal period, during which any user can submit a challenge to the higher court. However, they\u2019ll have to put up a pre-defined bail deposit.\n\nEach court specifies the higher court to appeal to, with the Ethereum Supreme Court serving as the final destination for challengers, Gluchowski said.\n\nLet's chat. The main idea of the post: no human-driven court should be able to say the last word. The final appeal must always be an L1 fork. \u2014 Alex G. \u220e (@gluk64) September 2, 2023\n\nAn example court heirachy would see protocols like Aave and Uniswap would contest matters in a court such as CourtUnchained or JusticeDAO. After those courts reach a decision, a party can appeal to the Ethereum Supreme Court.\n\nHowever, there would need to be a strong social consensus for the on-chain court system to work, Gluchowski acknowledged.\n\nHe added that it would be expensive so that only \u201ctruly extraordinary\u201d cases will be brought before it.\n\n\u201c[It will need to be] worthy of the attention of the entire Layer-0 (the social consensus) of Ethereum. Think of a bug in @Uniswap, a major L2, a Defi protocol with a systemic risk, etc.\u201d\n\nRelated: On-chain tool to seize crypto is a purist\u2019s nightmare but a must, says CEO\n\nGluchowski noted there were several existing solutions to such disputes already but argued that they aren\u2019t effective.\n\nFor example, enabling time-locked features on smart contracts isn\u2019t suitable in emergency situations and introducing a security council can mitigate the problem, but won\u2019t solve it, while carrying its own risks.\n\n\u201cA security council could only freeze the contract temporarily, requiring a token governance approval for an emergency upgrade. But now a malicious majority of undercollaterized stakers could perform an evil take-over upgrade and steal all the assets,\u201d he explained.\n\nGluchowski said that he and the team at zkSync \u2014 an Ethereum layer 2 scaling solution created by Matter Labs \u2014 will happily fund research into the proposal.\n\nCollect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space.\n\nMagazine: \u2018Moral responsibility\u2019 \u2014 Can blockchain really improve trust in AI?"

        "title": "Ethereum: Of staking, Lido\u2019s dominance, and rising concerns - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "ETH staked was over 28 million at press time.\n\nLikewise, ETH staked through Lido stood at over 8 million.\n\nEthereum [ETH] staking has seen a consistent rise in participation since its inception. With the increasing popularity of ETH staking, Lido\u2019s [LDO] share of the staking market has also expanded, leading to certain concerns.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nEthereum staking and Lido\u2019s dominance keeps rising\n\nAccording to Ethereum\u2019s staking chart on CryptoQuant, the press time amount of ETH staked exceeded 28 million. What\u2019s particularly notable in the chart was the significant surge in Ethereum staking, with this upward trend becoming evident around April.\n\nAdditionally, data from Dune Analytics indicated that the total ETH staked accounted for approximately 22% of the total ETH in circulation.\n\nHowever, the most intriguing aspect emerged when the percentage of ETH staked through Lido was examined. According to Dune Analytics, Lido commanded 32.4% of the total ETH staked, amounting to more than 8 million ETH.\n\nIn comparison, the closest competing platform had approximately 2 million ETH staked as of this writing.\n\nGiven Lido\u2019s pronounced dominance in the Ethereum staking landscape, concerns regarding the centralization of the Ethereum network have recently arisen.\n\nLido\u2019s Ethereum staking dominance sparks concerns\n\nRyan Berckmans has expressed concern that the increasing dominance of Lido may lead to Ethereum being viewed as a centralized platform.\n\nBerckmans cautioned that this growing centralization could potentially damage Ethereum\u2019s reputation, particularly in the eyes of corporations and governments, and undermine its aspirations of becoming a globally recognized settlement layer within the financial system.\n\nimo, the realistic worst-case scenario for Lido's uncapped dominance isn't network disruption. It's that Ethereum develops a reputation among corporations and governments as having been \"captured\" or \"not actually that decentralized relative to other chains\". If this were to\u2026 \u2014 Ryan Berckmans ryanb.eth?? (@ryanberckmans) September 1, 2023\n\nSuch a perception could adversely affect Ethereum, which has gained popularity due to its multitude of decentralized applications (dApps) hosted on the network.\n\nLDO not as dominant\n\nAn examination of Lido on a daily timeframe chart revealed that it was not as dominant as its staking share. As of this writing, LDO was trading at approximately $1.5, experiencing a modest price increase of over 1%.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 LDOs worth today?\n\nIn the days leading up to the observed trading session, LDO had been downward for five consecutive days.\n\nThe bearish trend was further corroborated by the positioning of its long and short Moving Averages (yellow and blue lines). The price was trending below the yellow line, acting as a resistance level in the range of $1.8 to $1.9."

        "title": "Visa Expands Stablecoin Settlement Capabilities to Merchant Acquirers - Business Wire",
        "content": "SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Visa (NYSE: V), a global leader in payments, announced its next step in modernizing cross-border money movement. Visa is expanding its stablecoin settlement capabilities to the high-performing Solana blockchain and is working with merchant acquirers Worldpay and Nuvei.\n\nThrough live pilots with issuers and acquirers, Visa has already moved millions of USDC between its partners over the Solana and Ethereum blockchain networks to settle fiat-denominated payments authorized over VisaNet.\n\nWhen consumers use Visa cards to make a purchase at any of the millions of Visa-accepting merchant locations around the world, they can experience the convenience of nearly instant payment authorizations. But what they don\u2019t see is that the funds used for their purchase need to move between their bank (the issuer) and the merchant\u2019s bank (the acquirer). This is where Visa\u2019s treasury and settlement systems enable the clearing, settlement and movement of billions in transactions a day, making sure the correct amount in the preferred currency is received from the issuer and sent to the acquirer. This process happens seamlessly between nearly 15K financial institutions and across more than 25 currencies globally.\n\n\u201cBy leveraging stablecoins like USDC and global blockchain networks like Solana and Ethereum, we're helping to improve the speed of cross-border settlement and providing a modern option for our clients to easily send or receive funds from Visa\u2019s treasury,\u201d said Cuy Sheffield, Head of Crypto, Visa. \u201cVisa is committed to being on the forefront of digital currency and blockchain innovation and leveraging these new technologies to help improve the way we move money.\u201d\n\nBuilding on the Crypto.com Pilot\n\nIn 2021, Visa began testing how USDC could be used inside its treasury operations which led to a pilot with Crypto.com, making Visa one of the first major payments networks to test stablecoin settlement on the issuance side. This work led to a successful pilot leveraging USDC and the Ethereum blockchain to receive payments from Crypto.com for cross-border volume on their live card program in Australia. Crypto.com now uses USDC to fulfill its settlement obligations on the Visa card in Australia and intends to roll out this capability in other markets.\n\nBefore that pilot, settlement for cross-border purchases made on Crypto.com Visa cards required a days-long currency conversion process and costly international wire transfers. Now, Crypto.com can send USDC cross-border over the Ethereum blockchain directly to a Visa treasury managed Circle account which helps reduce the time and complexity of international wire transfers.\n\n\u201cWe are excited about the USDC use cases Visa and its partners are driving to create fundamental blockchain innovation,\u201d said Jeremy Allaire, Co-founder and CEO, Circle. \u201cCircle built USDC to provide a functional digital dollar that could move at the speed of the internet to facilitate secure, reliable payments. Expanding the pilot exemplifies how pairing USDC with Visa\u2019s innovation opens up the future of payments, commerce and financial applications.\u201d\n\nMoving from Issuers to Acquirers\n\nWhile Visa\u2019s treasury operation continues to test receiving funds onchain from multiple issuer partners, with these new settlement options Visa can send funds onchain to acquirers like Worldpay and Nuvei to help speed up settlement times for their merchants.\n\nWorldpay and Nuvei are global acquirers serving merchants worldwide from a diverse range of sectors. This includes a growing number of merchants interacting with the blockchain and crypto economy including on-ramp providers, games, and NFT marketplaces who may prefer to receive stablecoins over traditional fiat currencies for the card payments they accept. Using Visa\u2019s own Circle account, Visa can now manage settlement payouts in USDC to Worldpay and Nuvei who can then route these payments in USDC to their end merchants.\n\nAdding Support for the Solana Blockchain Network\n\nAs Visa looked to expand this capability to additional clients, there has been significant demand to leverage newer, high performance blockchains that can send and receive stablecoins with higher speed and lower costs. For these reasons, Visa chose to add support for Solana as a high performance blockchain that its partners can choose to send or receive USDC settlement payments. This makes Visa one of the first major payments companies at scale to directly utilize Solana for live settlement payments between its clients. The Solana blockchain sees 400 millisecond block times, averages 400 transactions per second (TPS) and typically surges to more than 2K TPS1 across a variety of use cases during periods of peak demand.\n\nForging New Partnerships\n\nWith an eye towards the future in an increasingly digital financial landscape, Visa is forging ahead with new partnerships and embracing the innovative potential of digital currencies. Visa\u2019s work with Worldpay and Nuvei represents a significant stride in this direction.\n\n\u201cVisa's USDC settlement capability enables Worldpay to bring more of our treasury operations in-house and allows us to offer merchants more choices for receiving funds,\u201d said Jim Johnson, President of Worldpay Merchant Solutions, FIS. \u201cDiversifying funding options and increasing flexibility is critical to serving the changing needs of global merchants in today\u2019s rapidly evolving commerce landscape.\u201d\n\n\u201cStablecoins like USDC are cutting edge payments technology that can enable online businesses around the world to accelerate their growth,\u201d said Philip Fayer, Chair and CEO, Nuvei. \u201cOptimizing cross-border transactions is only one use case where stablecoins can benefit businesses. As a leading global payments company, we are constantly focused on innovation, and we\u2019re excited to work with Visa to bring these capabilities to our partners.\u201d\n\nAbout Visa\n\nVisa (NYSE: V) is a world leader in digital payments, facilitating transactions between consumers, merchants, financial institutions and government entities across more than 200 countries and territories. Our mission is to connect the world through the most innovative, convenient, reliable and secure payments network, enabling individuals, businesses and economies to thrive. We believe that economies that include everyone everywhere, uplift everyone everywhere and see access as foundational to the future of money movement.

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) co-founder Vitalik Buterin has sold off the rest of his Maker (MKR) tokens after not making any moves for two years, on-chain data shows.\n\nFirst spotted by blockchain tracking firm Lookonchain, Etherscan data shows Buterin\u2019s Ethereum address trading 500 MKR for 353 ETH, worth about $580,000.\n\nThe trade came 861 days after Buterin\u2019s last move, which was a 100 ETH donation to an Indian Covid Relief program.\n\nMKR is the governance token that supports the stablecoin DAI.\n\nButerin\u2019s trade came just two days after Rune Christensen, the founder of MakerDAO and DAI, issued a statement proposing plans to build a new native chain for the Maker ecosystem on a Solana (SOL) fork.\n\nChristensen, who made the proposal as part of the \u201cEndGame\u201d for Maker, said that Solana offered high efficiency and resiliency with a history of being successfully forked.\n\nSaid Christensen,\n\n\u201cThe first reason is the technical quality of the Solana codebase, as it is highly optimized for the purpose of operating a singular, highly efficient blockchain, which is what NewChain requires. The Solana codebase is engineered well and benefits from being designed long after the bottlenecks and challenges of blockchains were already well understood, which fits nicely with the objective of NewChain itself in fixing the technical debt of Maker. Solana also already has two client implementations, which is crucial for resilience.\n\nThe second reason is that the Solana ecosystem has proven its resilience by having gone through the FTX blowup. Despite all of the issues and hardships, the project still has a thriving developer community. This means that it has a significant Lindy Effect and is likely to stick around long term and means that the costs for development and maintenance will be much lower and that there will always be a high-quality pool of talent available for Maker to access and contribute to.\n\nThe third reason is that there already exists examples of the Solana codebase being forked and adapted to act as appchains. Most notable is the Pyth project which runs its own adapted version of Solana to act as its backend.\u201d\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Anatoly Yakovenko, the co-founder of the Solana (SOL) network, could be considered your stereotypical \u2018dude-programmer.\u2019 Depending on who you talk to, \u2018Toly\u2019 is just as likely to be found catching waves off the coast of California than hunched over a desk, surfing the blockchain.\n\nBut make no mistake; cycling and surfing trips aren\u2019t stolen afternoons of leisure for Anatoly Yakovenko. The Solana Labs co-founder credits these moments of distracted enjoyment with giving birth to his brightest and best ideas.\n\nWith a growing range of popular Solana dApps, the ecosystem is establishing itself as the most performant Layer One blockchain in the Web3 world. Let\u2019s look at the software engineer who made it all possible.\n\nWho is Anatoly Yakovenko?\n\nWhile newcomers to the world of blockchain technology might recognize him better as an X shapeshifter who sports a different Solana NFT profile picture each week, Anatoly Yakovenko is more than just a name on a whitepaper.\n\nA Ukrainian computer engineer turned American entrepreneur, Solana Labs co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko is the mastermind behind the Solana blockchain and the Proof-of-History consensus mechanism. This unique approach to securing decentralized networks gives Solana its trademark transaction speeds and unmatched scalability.\n\nBut did a humble software engineer go from a small-time tech startup to sitting at the helm of the cryptocurrency\u2019s leading Ethereum (ETH) Killer?\n\nEarly Life and Education\n\nBorn in what is now Ukraine in the late 1970s, Anatoly Yakovenko was a child of the Soviet era, a time when the mere thought of decentralized systems would\u2019ve certainly ruffled a few feathers.\n\nYakovenko was a tech enthusiast from a tender age. He later moved to the United States, where he pursued his passion, completing a bachelor of computer science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. It might seem ridiculous now, but some professors advised against this line of study, given the unwinding collapse of the dot-com bubble.\n\nPre-Crypto Era\n\nBefore diving headfirst into the blockchain whirlpool, Anatoly Yakovenko was already dipping his toes in the tech industry. According to LinkedIn, he co-founded Alescere following his studies, a Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) service. The short-lived startup inspired a young Yakovenko hungry for building innovative technologies.\n\nYakovenko joined Qualcomm, a global leader in wireless tech innovation, to develop his skills faster and climb the tech world ranks. He began his Qualcomm tenure as a software engineer but quickly made a name for himself, eventually becoming the company\u2019s Senior Staff Engineering Manager.\n\nWhile at Qualcomm, Yakovenko was deeply involved in hardcore engineering work, from operating systems to virtual and augmented reality products. But the blockchain bug had already bitten him. Around 2013, he became an early adopter of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum, keeping a close eye on the burgeoning industry.\n\nThe Birth of Solana\n\nThe year was 2017, and Yakovenko had just left Qualcomm. He dabbled in a few other tech gigs, including stints at Mesosphere and Dropbox, but something was missing. The blockchain space was calling, and Yakovenko was captivated by its possibilities.\n\nAnatoly Yakovenko was fascinated by Bitcoin and Ethereum but couldn\u2019t help pondering the limitations of existing blockchain technologies. While gas fees were less of an issue in 2017 than now, legacy networks were still excruciatingly slow.\n\nTo solve this lingering problem, the co-founder of Solana conceived the Proof-of-History consensus mechanism. This novel method of verifying blockchain transactions and data promises to optimize the scalability of decentralized networks, making blockchain technology a suitable platform for the masses.\n\nAlongside Raj Gokal and fellow Qualcomm alumni Greg Fitzgerald and Stephen Akridge, Yakovenko got to work and laid the necessary foundations for the world\u2019s fastest blockchain and smart contract platform. All it needed now was a name, but the team didn\u2019t need to look far for inspiration.\n\nTheir revolutionary network would be named after Solana Beach in California, where the team regularly surfed and worked through ideas together, away from the confines of their computer screens.\n\nYakovenko\u2019s Stirring Defence of Solana\n\nDespite its meteoric rise, Solana has had its fair share of critics. Decentralization enthusiasts dragged The network through the mud, claiming that Solana\u2019s predatory tokenomics, venture capitalist allocations, and expensive validator requirements would be a bloodbath for retail investors.\n\nAdding to Solana\u2019s mounting woes during 2021-2022, the blockchain suffered several network outages. While this discredited a network supposedly designed for \u2018high performance,\u2019 it also showed that demand for the network and its rapidly growing DeFi and NFT ecosystems attracted huge numbers of users.\n\nThe straw that broke the camel\u2019s back came in November 2022 during the collapse of the FTX cryptocurrency exchange. Sam Bankman-Fried was a strong advocate of Solana, and both FTX and Alameda Research still hold large amounts of SOL tokens.\n\nResponding to these criticisms, Yakovenko acknowledges some of these flaws. Speaking with Blockworks, he and Raj Gokal reflected that it was \u2018a bittersweet thing\u2019. While FTX\u2019s unraveling caused significant damage to SOL\u2019s price, it also freed the network from the influence of a large stakeholder.\n\nThe pair also reflected that every major network has had catastrophic moments like the Ethereum DAO Hack or Bitcoin\u2019s Mt. Gox collapse. In an interview with Fortune, Yakovenko concluded that it felt \u2018like \u2018ripping the bandaid.\u2019\n\nSince the collapse, Solana has enjoyed consistent growth in almost every metric. Yakovenko maintains Solana Breakpoint attendees are doubling yearly while on-chain transactions, validator nodes, and active wallet addresses continue to rise.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next for Anatoly Yakovenko?\n\nWhile Solana continues to grow in market cap and ecosystem development, Anatoly Yakovenko is far from done. He\u2019s actively involved in pushing the boundaries of what Solana can achieve.\n\nFiredancer, Solana\u2019s next big infrastructure upgrade, is a new independent validator client expected to help Solana reach a maximum transaction throughput of 0.6-1.2 million TPS (Transactions per second).\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nThe crypto world loves cult icons like Vitalik Buterin, Charles Hoskinson, and Satoshi Nakamoto. It seems a shame to highlight Anytoly Yakavenko alone when celebrating Solana\u2019s achievements since a collective of engineers and entrepreneurs co-founded Solana Labs.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nThe Solana network is one of the largest and most popular Layer-1 blockchains and smart contract platforms in the cryptocurrency industry. With a vision of onboarding the masses through familiar products like Web3 smartphones, Solana is a leading contender to usurp Ethereum\u2019s reign.\n\nFAQs"

        "content": "MakerDAO is going to roll out their NewChain. It\u2019s part of their Endgame, a long-term strategic project. So, Rune Christensen, the MakerDAO CEO, considers Solana codebase as the foundation.\n\nThis can be massive news for Solana. Christensen only sees Cosmos as another option. So, what is this NewChain from MakerDAO? And why would they choose Solana? Let\u2019s find out more.\n\nWhat Is the MakerDAO NewChain and Why Solana?\n\nNewChain is part of the MakerDAO upgrade. This upgrade takes place in five parts. This is the final part and is part of their \u2018Endgame\u2019. However, this final part may well take another three years to complete. It will see MakerDAO in a new and stand-alone blockchain.\n\nThe last phase of Endgame is the launch of a native blockchain for Maker with the codename NewChain It will make the ecosystem more secure and efficient After some research, I believe the Solana codebase should be considered as the basis for NewChainhttps://t.co/KyGxBBGlVH \u2014 Rune (@RuneKek) September 1, 2023\n\nThis should become a fork on the Solana codebase. Christensen mentioned that he investigates a variety of chains. This included, for instance, Sui and Aptos. However, he didn\u2019t find them compatible compared to what Solana and Cosmos have to offer.\n\nCurrently, Solana seems to have the best cards. Christensen gave three reasons why he picked Solana.\n\nTechnical quality \u2013 \u2018 it is highly optimized for operating a singular, efficient blockchain \u2018. Resilient ecosystem \u2013 Solana managed to deal with the FTX debacle. There\u2019s still a thriving developer community. The Solana codebase proved itself \u2013 \u2018 It has already forked. It also adapted to act as appchains \u2018.\n\nChristensen sees these as the main reasons. That\u2019s why he wants to explore Solana as the most promising codebase. He aims to build a symbiotic relationship with Solana\u2019s current ecosystem.\n\nMore About MakerDAO\u2019s Decision\n\nThis is a break with MakerDAO\u2019s current ties with Ethereum and the EVM. Christensen sees the Solana backend as more in line with what NewChain needs. However, he still recognizes that EVM is crucial for user-facing applications.\n\nCosmos is another consideration. However, this doesn\u2019t have a centralized foundation. At its core, it does not prioritize efficiency. This can result in higher maintenance expenses. On the back of this news, Vitalik Buterin sold off $500,000 worth of MKR tokens. It\u2019s not clear if this news relates to each other.\n\nSource: MakerDAO Forum\n\nConclusion\n\nIn a rather surprising move, MakerDAO seems to be looking for a Solana fork for their NewChain. Co-founder Rune Christensen gave three compelling reasons why he picked Solana. Building the new chain may take another three years, though. It\u2019s a significant break with Maker\u2019s current Ethereum and EVM ties.\n\n\u2013 For more cryptocurrency news, check out the Altcoin Buzz YouTube channel.\n\n\u2013 Unlock the key to managing your crypto portfolio like a PRO!

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nAs volatility and price dynamics of major cryptocurrencies demonstrate pale performance, another important indicator, Google Trends' activity, reaches multiyear lows for a number of crypto-related search requests.\n\nSearches for Ethereum (ETH) dropped to November 2020 lows\n\nThe number of searches for the Ethereum (ETH) cryptocurrency tracked by the Google Trends instrument, plummeted to levels unseen since early November 2020. For the \"DeFi\" request, this indicator dropped below four-year lows, data shows.\n\nImage by Google Trends\n\nAs of the last seven days, the metric for \"Ethereum\" plunged to 8/100. The last time it was so low was in November 2020. This means that amid the hottest weeks of the crypto euphoria in 2021, internet users were searching for \"Ethereum\" 12x more often.\n\nFor \"DeFi,\" this indicator is sitting at 26/100, but it has not been so low since mid-July 2019.\n\nLocal low for \"Bitcoin\" search count was registered one month ago. For \"crypto\" and \"cryptocurrency\" requests, the indicators are also as low as they were in October 2020.\n\nGameFi-, NFT- and metaverse-related searches are also targeting multiyear lows.\n\nAs covered by U.Today previously, Glassnode analysts characterized sentiment on crypto markets as a \"stage of extreme apathy and exhaustion\" on Aug. 14, 2023.\n\nRipple searches decline as well, what about XRP?\n\nCryptocurrency bulls should brace themselves for even more pain ahead, analyst Miles Deutscher shared in his recent X announcement.\n\nMeanwhile, in the Ripple and XRP communities, the situation looks slightly different. For Ripple, the performance is even more dramatic. In Q1, 2023, Ripple-associated searches dropped to lows unseen since 2016 but then slightly recovered.\n\nHowever, XRP looks almost 3x as popular as it was year ago. In September 2022, the activity of searches dropped to 6/100, while today it is about 17/100.\n\nThe better performance of Ripple and XRP's searches can be attributed to the interim legal win of Ripple in its lawsuit against the SEC."

        "content": "Solana\u2019s (SOL) co-founder, Anatoly Yakovenko, has cautioned the blockchain community against harboring resentment towards Ethereum (ETH) following recent praise from MakerDAO\u2019s (MKR) CEO, Rune Christensen.\n\nMakerDAO is considering Solana\n\nIn a recent blog post, Christensen unveiled the MakerDAO Endgame plan\u2019s final phase, revealing a comprehensive reimagining of the DeFi protocol on a novel forked version of Solana, which will be named NewChain.\n\nChristensen highlighted Solana\u2019s technical prowess and optimization as factors that make it ideal for his platform\u2019s blockchain network. Additionally, he noted that Solana has demonstrated impressive resilience despite the issues it faced due to FTX\u2019s collapse, bolstering its position with a thriving developer community. This robust ecosystem reduces development and maintenance costs and guarantees a consistent pool of top-tier talent.\n\nChristensen further hinted that NewChain could serve as a vital bridge connecting Ethereum and Solana. He wrote:\n\n\u201cBecause we benefit from the core Solana ecosystem being resilient, it would be strategically beneficial to ensure there is a Two-Stage Gravity Bridge from NewChain to Solana alongside the bridge from NewChain to Ethereum.\u201d\n\nYakovenko says Maker plan is a \u2018win for open source\u2019\n\nFollowing the revelation, some crypto community members interpreted Maker\u2019s choice as a victory for Solana while simultaneously mocking Ethereum.\n\nHowever, Yakovenko urged caution, saying Maker\u2019s consideration was a win for open-source technology and had \u201cnothing to do with Solana\u2019s mainnet or sol vs. eth.\u201d He added:\n\n\u201cEthereum is awesome. Solana wasn\u2019t built in a vacuum, and tons and tons of things that make Solana special were built based on Ethereum\u2019s r&d.\u201d\n\nButerin dumps all MKR tokens\n\nOn the other hand, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin sold all his MKR tokens for 353 ETH, around $581,000, through CoW protocol DEX, according to Arkham Intelligence\u2019s dashboard.\n\nMany are pondering the underlying motive for the sale, with many speculating that this might be a retaliatory action. However, this seems unlikely, considering Buterin\u2019s prior endorsements of the Solana network.\n\nNevertheless, the action has attracted attention from prominent figures in the crypto community, including Justin Sun, the founder of the Tron Network."

While many remain hopeful of an eventual blessing from the agency, the optimism isn\u2019t being reflected on the technical charts of BTC/USD just yet.\n\nBTC/USD Weekly Chart\n\nChart Created by Manish Jaradi Using TradingView\n\nBTC/USD is now testing key support at the June low of 24750 \u2013 this support is crucial as a break below would disrupt the higher-highs-higher-lows sequence since late 2022. Furthermore, such a break would trigger a double top (the April and July highs), pointing to a deeper retracement toward the March low of 19550.\n\nBTC/USD Daily Chart\n\nChart Created by Manish Jaradi Using TradingView\n\nThe recent weakness follows an inability to rise past the upper edge of the Ichimoku cloud on the weekly charts, roughly coinciding with a slightly upward-sloping trendline from 2021 and the 89-week moving average.

This support is crucial for the broader recovery from the end of 2022 to continue. Any break below would confirm that the bullish bias had dissipated. Such a fall would initially open the way toward the March low of 1370, with major support at the 2022 low of 880.\n\nETH/USD Daily Chart\n\nChart Created by Manish Jaradi Using TradingView\n\nLike Bitcoin, ETH/USD has been under the influence of the bearish Ichimoku cloud cover on the weekly charts. In recent months, Ethereum hasn\u2019t been able to clear past the upper edge of the cloud on the weekly charts, roughly coinciding with a slightly upward sloping trendline from 2021. ETH/USD's inability to rise toward the top of the cloud cover, in comparison with BTC/USD, reflects its relative weakness. For more discussion, see \u201cIs the Rally Over in Bitcoin & Ethereum?

The financial and market information provided on U.Today is intended for informational purposes only. U.Today is not liable for any financial losses incurred while trading cryptocurrencies. Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nEthereum's recent journey through a death cross has left traders and investors with mixed feelings. Currently Ethereum is changing hands at approximately $1,634.86, a price point that has been scrutinized for its potential implications. But here's the twist: the death cross, despite its ominous name, is not necessarily the harbinger of doom it is often made out to be.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe death cross is often viewed as an ultimate bearish signal. It occurs when a short-term moving average crosses below a long-term moving average.\n\nYet, Ethereum's trading history suggests that both golden crosses (the opposite of death crosses) and death crosses can be misleading. They are not the be-all-end-all indicators many consider them to be. In fact, they often serve as mere blips in the grander scheme of market movements.\n\nNow, let's delve into the liquidity aspect. Ethereum, like many other cryptocurrencies, has been grappling with a lack of market traction. The volume and liquidity are not exactly painting a rosy picture. However, this is not a fundamental issue with Ethereum itself but rather a symptom of broader market conditions.\n\nOn the flip side, Ethereum has been showing signs of life in other areas. For instance, its Total Value Locked (TVL) has been on an upward trajectory, indicating that the network is far from stagnant. This suggests that the fundamentals are strong, even if the market indicators are currently less than ideal.\n\nSo, what's the takeaway here? Ethereum's recent death cross does not spell disaster. It is merely a chapter in a longer narrative that includes other factors like liquidity, volume and fundamental strength. While the market may be in a state of flux, Ethereum's underlying technology and adoption metrics are robust."

The asset\u2019s price is down 10.8% in the past 30 days, struggling to reclaim the $1,700 price level, according to data from CoinGecko at the time of writing.\n\nAmid the asset\u2019s price struggles, significant ETH transfers to Coinbase have stoked the flames of uncertainty. Is a price dump incoming?\n\nRoutine Internal Movement of Funds or Impending Selloff?\n\nOn Monday, September 4, blockchain tracker Whale Alert sent ripples through the crypto community by revealing that unknown whales had sent approximately 300k ETH to Coinbase in two equal transactions of about 150k ETH.\n\nThe large ETH transfers to Coinbase highlighted by Whale Alert. Source: Twitter\n\nReporting the huge and startling transfers on Tuesday, September 5, Wu Blockchain revealed that Arkham Intelligence data labeled the wallets as Coinbase cold wallets, noting that after the initial deposit to the exchange, the funds had been split into tranches of 4282 ETH sent to multiple addresses. While this increases the likelihood that it is a routine internal movement of funds, doubts remain.\n\nAccording to Whale Alert, about 300,000 ETH (approximately $488 million) was transferred from two wallets to Coinbase. The two wallet addresses are both Coinbase cold wallet addresses. After being transferred to the Coinbase hot wallet, they were transferred to multiple addresses\u2026 \u2014 Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) September 5, 2023\n\nChiming in, Santiment noted that the transfers are among the largest of 2023 and have led to the most significant on-chain transaction spike since June 13. Still, the firm maintained that the move might not impact the price action of ETH.\n\nETH\u2019s Price Reaction\n\nDespite initial fears, ETH\u2019s price has yet to react to the development. The asset is trading for $1,637 at the time of writing, up 0.7% in the last 24 hours, per data from CoinGecko.\n\nAt the same time, the asset\u2019s market cap has also experienced a mild bump.

        "content": "Alameda Research Ltd., UTXO Management, and Balch and Bingham LLP today announced the launch of Grayscale Litigation, where shareholders of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust and Grayscale Ethereum Trust (together, \u201cthe trusts\u201d) can join as co-plaintiffs in the previously announced litigation against Grayscale Investments, LLC filed by Alameda, a debtor affiliate of FTX Trading Ltd. and its affiliated debtors (together, \u201cthe FTX debtors\u201d).\n\nAccording to Grayscale, this effort cannot proceed unless current shareholders collectively owning at least 10% of all shares join as co-plaintiffs in litigation. Shareholders are encouraged to provide their information to participate by Sept. 6, 2023 at GrayscaleLitigation.com. Balch and Bingham LLP is prepared to represent eligible shareholders for zero out-of-pocket cost.\n\nJohn Ray, CEO and chief restructuring officer of the FTX debtors, said, \u201cFor years, Grayscale has been depriving shareholders of billions of dollars in value through extracting exorbitant management fees in violation of the trust agreements and hiding behind contrived excuses to prevent shareholders from redeeming their shares. We are pleased to date with the outpouring of support we have received from other shareholders in the trusts who want to join Alameda in its fight to hold Grayscale accountable for its egregious violations. Shareholders of the trusts are determined to recover lost value and demand justice for Grayscale\u2019s consistent failure to protect shareholders\u2019 interests. We urge others to sign on and join to ensure our case can proceed.\u201d\n\nSince Alameda first filed in March, it\u2019s received overwhelming support from trust shareholders. In addition, numerous funds, family offices and individual shareholders have expressed interest in joining, including:\n\nFir Tree Partners\n\nSaba Capital\n\nOwl Creek Asset Management\n\nAristides Capital\n\n\u201cSince last year, Fir Tree Partners has been seeking to hold Grayscale accountable for its massive ongoing destruction of shareholder value at GBTC,\u201d said Sachin Gupta, managing director at Fir Tree Partners. \u201cWe strongly support this effort by Alameda and dozens of other shareholders to recover the exorbitant management fees that have been extracted from the Grayscale Bitcoin and Ethereum Trusts and to force Grayscale to allow redemptions so that the trusts\u2019 long-time discount to NAV can finally be reversed.\u201d\n\n\u201cGrayscale has enriched itself at shareholders\u2019 expense,\u201d said David Bailey, general partner at UTXO Management. \u201cWe\u2019re not standing for it any longer and neither should any other shareholder. We\u2019ve joined this lawsuit to recover the value in our digital assets and we encourage other shareholders to sign on too. It\u2019s time to band together so we can get back the money that belongs to Grayscale shareholders, not Grayscale\u2019s principals.\u201d\n\nBackground\n\nOn March 6, 2023, Alameda filed a lawsuit in the Delaware Court of Chancery against Grayscale and its controllers, seeking to:\n\nRecoup Grayscale\u2019s historically excessive fees.\n\nReduce fees to a reasonable rate going forward.\n\nOpen redemptions so that shares once again track the trusts\u2019 asset values consistent with the investment purpose of each trust.\n\nAlameda\u2019s seeking the repayment of hundreds of millions of dollars to the trusts and a ruling that Grayscale and its controllers have breached their obligations under the trust documents and Delaware law by failing to ensure Grayscale\u2019s sponsor\u2019s fees are competitive and by failing to open a shareholder redemption program that could reverse the discount at which the trusts are trading. The changes Alameda seeks would maximize the trusts\u2019 assets into the future and cause share values to better reflect the value of the trusts\u2019 holdings.\n\nIn response, Grayscale has argued that the trusts\u2019 governing documents require Alameda\u2019s litigation to be brought collectively by shareholders currently owning a minimum of 10% of the shares of each trust. As a result, Alameda and other shareholders are seeking support from current shareholders in the trusts prepared to join the effort to ensure this litigation proceeds.\n\nAdvisors\n\nThe FTX debtors are represented in this action by Quinn Emanuel Urquhart and Sullivan, LLP as legal counsel, and Abrams and Bayliss LLP as Delaware counsel. In their chapter 11 cases, the FTX debtors are also represented by Sullivan and Cromwell LLP as legal counsel, and Landis Rath and Cobb LLP as Delaware counsel. UTXO Management and its affiliates are represented in this action by Balch and Bingham LLP as legal counsel, and Ashby and Geddes, P.A. as Delaware counsel.\n\nBalch & Bingham LLP also represents most shareholders who have agreed to join the suit to date on a contingency basis and will represent additional co-plaintiffs who seek to join the suit on the same basis. Shareholders represented by Balch and Bingham will also be represented in Delaware by Ashby and Geddes, P.A. Meanwhile, Fir Tree Partners, which has expressed strong interest in joining Alameda\u2019s lawsuit as a co-plaintiff, is represented by Willkie Farr and Gallaher LLP as well as Potter Anderson and Corroon LLP.\n\nSource: Alameda Research Ltd., UTXO Management, and Balch and Bingham LLP"

It is as if he is playing a high-stakes game of chess, moving pieces across the board, but his endgame remains unclear. Let's delve into the specifics.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA Buterin-associated Ethereum address (0xD04d...8fd7) recently transferred around 999 ETH, roughly equivalent to $1.64 million, to another address (0x5567\u202631B1). This is not the first rendezvous between these two addresses. About 20 days ago, the same recipient address received approximately 1,701 ETH from Buterin's address and then funneled those funds into a Bitstamp deposit.\n\n#PeckShieldAlert Vitalik-related address (0xD04d...8fd7) recently transferred ~999 $ETH (equivalent to ~$1.64M) to address 0x5567\u202631B1 ~20 days ago, this address 0x5567 previously received ~1,701 $ETH from Vitalik-related address (0xD04d\u20268fd7) and subsequently moved these funds\u2026 pic.twitter.com/n7jrKotsXq \u2014 PeckShieldAlert (@PeckShieldAlert) September 4, 2023\n\nBut wait, there is more to this intricate web. Last year, the Buterin-related address in question received a staggering 70,000 ETH from another address labeled \"Vb 3.\" The deposits were split into two tranches: about 30,000 ETH on May 6, 2022, and another 40,000 ETH on Nov. 24, 2022. Since then, this address has been like a philanthropist, distributing 31,000 ETH across four different addresses, including a 300 ETH deposit to Bitstamp.\n\nSo, what is the narrative here? Why is Buterin moving these substantial sums? One theory could be portfolio diversification. It is as if Buterin is rearranging his financial furniture, perhaps to invest in other ventures or to cash out some of his holdings. Another angle could be strategic partnerships or funding rounds that are yet to be disclosed. It is as if he is planting seeds, but we do not yet know what kind of forest he is aiming to grow.\n\nHowever, these transactions also raise questions about market influence. When a figure as pivotal as Buterin makes such moves, it is like sending ripples across a still pond; the effects can be far-reaching. Is he aware of market trends that the average investor is not privy to? Or is this just routine financial housekeeping on a grand scale?"

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nSeasoned Ethereum (ETH) enthusiast and investor Ryan Berckmans published a thread to stress the main opportunities unlocked by noncustodial bridge mechanisms between various second-layer solutions. They are resilient to unexpected hardforks and can be far more resource efficient.\n\nInter-L2 bridges are more reliable and cheaper than competitors from L1s, Ryan Berckmans says\n\nBridges between different Ethereum-based L2 scalers have already established themselves as less risky and more gas-optimized systems compared to cross-L1 bridges. In future, their supremacy is set to become even more obvious, Berckmans opined in his thread yesterday on X.\n\nInter-L2 bridges are already better than cross-L1 bridges and are guaranteed to continue improving vs. cross-L1, with no research risk.\n\n\n\nLet me try to explain why.\n\n\n\nIt's fair to say that today's L2s have heavy training wheels, including security councils and admin multisigs. Many\u2026 \u2014 Ryan Berckmans ryanb.eth\ud83e\udd87\ud83d\udd0a (@ryanberckmans) September 3, 2023\n\nFor instance, once the underlying L1 hard forks, both L2s on its top and their bridges are automatically migrated. Meanwhile, a bridge between two L1s need manual migration initiated. When a paternal L1 reorganizes, all of its L2s follow; there's no need for any additional action.\n\nAlso, systems of interconnected L2 protocols can be more gas efficient compared to bridges from previous generations thanks to the integration of zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs):\n\nA third benefit is that inter-L2 bridges can have their messages bundled into the same aggregated verification that powers the L2s themselves. For example, bridging activity can be included in the same zk proof used to settle a zk L2's internal activity at no additional L1 gas cost.\n\nCross-L1 bridges can be considered immutable only if we assume that both start and target L1 blockchains will never undergo hardforks.\n\nBerckmans mentioned Hop Protocol, Across, Connext and Socket apps among the pioneering cross-L2 decentralized bridges.\n\nArbitrum strengthens its dominance in L2 scene with Stylus launched\n\nHowever, the teams of L2 bridges have a lot of work to do, Berckmans concluded. In future, they will be of paramount importance for the global value transfer system:\n\nIn short, inter-L2 bridges are guaranteed to be more reliable and cheaper than cross-L1 bridges. That's why the Ethereum Trade Network will be the primary vehicle for the multichain network economy.\n\nAs of today, 90% of Ethereum's L2s ecosystem is controlled by two blockchains, i.e., Arbitrum One (ARB) and Optimism (OP). As covered by U.Today previously, Arbitrum introduced Stylus, an instrument for programmers working in non-EVM languages.\n\nWith Stylus, developers can run smart contracts and tokens written in WASM languages (C, C++ and Rust) in EVM-compatible blockchains without limitations."

        "content": "Share:\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price is back to consolidation after the recent Grayscale-infused data provided market impales. Ethereum (ETH) price is following in a path almost similar to BTC, but Ripple (XRP) price would not yield.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin price likely to fall 10% from current levels this September, crypto analyst says\n\nCryptocurrency metrics FAQs What is circulating supply? The developer or creator of each cryptocurrency decides on the total number of tokens that can be minted or issued. Only a certain number of these assets can be minted by mining, staking or other mechanisms. This is defined by the algorithm of the underlying blockchain technology. Since its inception, a total of 19,445,656 BTCs have been mined, which is the circulating supply of Bitcoin. On the other hand, circulating supply can also be decreased via actions such as burning tokens, or mistakenly sending assets to addresses of other incompatible blockchains. What is market capitalization? Market capitalization is the result of multiplying the circulating supply of a certain asset by the asset\u2019s current market value. For Bitcoin, the market capitalization at the beginning of August 2023 is above $570 billion, which is the result of the more than 19 million BTC in circulation multiplied by the Bitcoin price around $29,600. What is trading volume? Trading volume refers to the total number of tokens for a specific asset that has been transacted or exchanged between buyers and sellers within set trading hours, for example, 24 hours. It is used to gauge market sentiment, this metric combines all volumes on centralized exchanges and decentralized exchanges. Increasing trading volume often denotes the demand for a certain asset as more people are buying and selling the cryptocurrency. What is funding rate? Funding rates are a concept designed to encourage traders to take positions and ensure perpetual contract prices match spot markets. It defines a mechanism by exchanges to ensure that future prices and index prices periodic payments regularly converge. When the funding rate is positive, the price of the perpetual contract is higher than the mark price. This means traders who are bullish and have opened long positions pay traders who are in short positions. On the other hand, a negative funding rate means perpetual prices are below the mark price, and hence traders with short positions pay traders who have opened long positions.\n\nBitcoin price back to consolidation\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price has fallen back to its longstanding range bound movement, coiling up around the $25,824 level. Two outcomes are likely after such a move, a break north or south. Currently, the odds favor the downside and BTC could draw nearer to the $24,995 support level and extend the losses to the psychological $24,000.\n\nIn the dire case, Bitcoin price could dip into the demand zone between $21,711 and $20,155. This outlook draws inspiration from the Relative Strength Index (RSI), currently declining to show falling momentum. Similarly, the histogram bars of the Awesome Oscillator flash red to suggest a presence of bears in the market.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-day chart\n\nConversely, a renaissance by the bulls could alter the impending fate for Bitcoin price, with a possible foray back above the psychological $28,000, level last tested on August 29. Increased buyer momentum could send the flagship crypto past the $29,692 barricade, or in a highly bullish case, shatter the $31,518 obstacle.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin investors expect more downside, Vitalik Buterin sells his MKR holdings\n\nEthereum price tests $1,630 support level\n\nEthereum (ETH) price is barely holding above the $1,630 support level, even as BTC shows weakness. Increased seller momentum could send the price lower, potentially breaching the $1,522 support level. A decisive flip of this buyer congestion level into resistance would solidify the downtrend for the short term and mark a 5% landslide.\n\nLike BTC, the momentum indicators point to a similar outcome as momentum is steadily declining and the RSI could soon activate a signal to sell ETH when it crosses below the signal line (yellow band). Traders heeding this call would bode poorly for ETH.\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the other hand, late or sidelined investors could salvage Ethereum price from the impending slump, with a possible move above the $1,701 resistance level. Increased buying pressure from this level could see ETH ascend to confront the mid-August highs around $1,835, or in the highly ambitious cases, attempt to break from current gloom by making a strong reach above $2,008.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum Cancun upgrade development is on track, testing phase comes next\n\nRipple price goes AWOL\n\nRipple (XRP) price is nurturing a uptrend that could materialize if early profit takers keep their profit appetite in check. The token boasts three successive green candlesticks, pointing to bulls gaining ground.\n\nIncreased buying pressure could sustain the uptrend, sending Ripple price above the immediate hurdle at $0.5667, which stands as multi-month resistance level barring two equal highs and therefore significant.\n\nHigher, Ripple price would have a shot at reclaiming the ground lost after the July 13 ascent, first breaching the $0.6840 level before taking back control with a solid move above the $0.8193 resistance level.\n\nNoteworthy the RSI had executed a bullish crossover, moving above the signal line in an attempt to siren a buy signal. Traders harkening to this call could enhance the uptrend for Ripple price. The AO makes the bullish outlook stronger, with the histogram bars soaking in green and edging toward the midline. This adds credence to the bullish outlook.\n\nXRP/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the other side, early profit takers from XRP holders who are incurring losses at current price or breaking even and looking for early exits to escape losses could sell the remittance token, so much so that the demand zone between $0.5040 and $0.4600 fails to hold as support. A decisive break below the mean threshold (midline of demand zone marked in blue) would invalidate the bullish thesis, exposing XRP to an extrapolated slump toward the $0.4191 support level.\n\n\n\nBreaking: Ripple files opposition to SEC\u2019s motion to certify interlocutory appeal"

        "content": "Maker has revealed plans to move its backend to a new chain, likely based on Solana.\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has expressed opposition to Maker\u2019s new trajectory.\n\nDespite Buterin\u2019s misgivings, the plan intends to make the Maker protocol more resilient.\n\nMaker appears to have fallen out of favor with Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin. After MakerDAO CEO Rune Christensen outlined plans for a Solana-integrated future, the Ethereum co-founder dumped his MKR holdings and questioned the project\u2019s direction.\n\nButerin Slams Christensen\u2019s Plan\n\nIn a MakerDAO forum post on Friday, September 1, Christensen outlined his vision for Maker\u2019s Endgame\u2019s fifth and final stage. The long-term plan will see the backend of the Maker Protocol move to a new blockchain dubbed NewChain, with Christensen suggesting the Solana stack as the codebase, a significant shift from Maker\u2019s Ethereum roots.\n\nThe Maker chief\u2019s plan appears to have rubbed Ethereum\u2019s Buterin the wrong way. After Christensen released the forum post, Buterin dumped the last of his MKR holdings, exchanging 500 MKR for 353 ETH (approximately $580k) on Saturday, September 2.\n\nMoreover, in a Discord message shared by Wu Blockchain on Sunday, September 3, Buterin bashed Maker\u2019s planned trajectory as \u201cweird.\u201d Further, he appeared to champion Maker\u2019s RAI over DAI due to minimized governance in light of Christensen\u2019s new plans.\n\n\"If MakerDAO is torpedoing itself in weird directions Then it makes natural sense for RAI to move somewhat closer to that middle category IMO not all the way; I think there is value in maintaining some kind of norm of 'ETH is the collateral'\" Buterin argued.\n\nWith the Ethereum co-founder disavowing the Maker protocol, it becomes necessary to understand why Maker intends to move its backend to a separate chain and why Christensen has hailed Solana as a strong contender.\n\nThe Idea Behind NewChain\n\nAccording to Christensen, with NewChain, the Maker protocol is expected to become more resilient to governance attacks and technical failures using hard forks. At the same time, the move will also allow developers more freedom to rebuild Maker components to serve better the purposes they were designed.\n\nTo circumvent the complexities of building a blockchain from scratch, Maker intends to fork an existing Layer 1 chain, with Christensen tipping the Solana stack as \u201cthe most promising codebase.\u201d The Maker co-founder cited three reasons for this choice: technical quality and optimization, the network\u2019s resilience after the FTX collapse, and the success of existing Solana forks like the Pyth Network.\n\nAside from Solana, Christensen highlighted that Cosmos was a leading contender, touting the ecosystem\u2019s large talent pool and multiple app chains. Nonetheless, he contended that Solana maintained the edge in efficiency, arguing that Cosmos chains required more capital to maintain.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nChristensen\u2019s plan remains in the proposal phase, and the Maker co-founder estimates that the project could take at least three years to finish.\n\nMaker\u2019s front end will remain on Ethereum and Ethereum Layer 2 chains , connected to the backend through a bridge.\n\nVitalik Buterin\u2019s stance does not appear to have impacted the price of MKR. At the time of writing, the asset is trading for about $1,120, representing a negligible 0.51% decline in the past 24 hours per CoinMarketCap data.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nMaker is the second-largest protocol on the Ethereum blockchain by TVL, with $5.06 billion per Defi Llama data at the time of writing. Moves made by the protocol could have spillover effects on the leading blockchain.\n\nRead this to learn more about Maker\u2019s recent strides:\n\nDeFi Pioneer MakerDAO (MKR) Enters Lending Market with New Spark Protocol\n\nFind out what expert analysts are saying about Bitcoin\u2019s latest dip:\n\nDoes BTC\u2019s Dip Below $26K Present a Buying Opportunity?

        "title": "OnlyFans' CEO Puts $20M in Ethereum; Could These Altcoins Be Its Next? - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "The world of crypto continues to attract attention from various industries, with Fenix, OnlyFans\u2019 parent company, making the list. In a new development, Fenix announced a significant crypto holding\u2014$20 million in Ethereum purchased between 2021 and 2022. This development has sent ripples through the market and shows the institutional attention digital assets are gaining. Amidst this, speculation has risen about the next altcoin to experience similar attention. In particular, Solana (SOL) and InQubeta (QUBE) have emerged as two altcoins to watch. This article will delve into the details of OnlyFans\u2019 Ethereum investment and what makes Solana and InQubeta potential altcoins to be accumulated by this company. Continue reading to learn more.\n\nInQubeta (QUBE): The Next Altcoin to Experience Institutional Support\n\nInQubeta is another altcoin generating buzz in the crypto landscape despite being a new entrant. Its combination of two of the world\u2019s most disruptive innovations, blockchain and AI, has earned it institutional and retail interest. As a result, there has been massive participation in its presale, with its fundraising event surpassing $2.5 million so far. This makes it one of the best cryptos to buy.\n\nInQubeta\u2019s blend of AI and blockchain will see it become the world\u2019s first blockchain-based crowdfunding platform for AI startups through cryptocurrency. This move seeks to reshape the fundraising scene within the AI industry, providing an alternative and seamless fundraising experience for startups.\n\nAt the heart of its ecosystem will be a custom-built NFT marketplace and its utility token, QUBE. AI-based startups can raise funds by minting investment opportunities as equity-based NFTs. These AI investment-backed NFTs will be fragmented into fractional NFTs, thereby allowing investors to hold stakes in promising AI ventures with as little as they can afford. This completely democratizes access to what\u2019s arguably the most disruptive and profitable industry in the world, with investors set to earn immense profits.\n\nTo become an early investor in this trailblazing project, enthusiasts can participate in the ongoing presale. It is currently in presale stage three at a token price of $0.0112. Meanwhile, according to experts, the token is poised to skyrocket, with a forecast of a 25x increase before the end of 2023.\n\nA Growing Interest in Crypto: Ethereum (ETH) as a Case Study\n\nCryptocurrency has been finding its way into the mainstream, evident in recent accumulations from big players, with many yet to be known. In recent developments, OnlyFans, via its parent company, Fenix International, revealed the company\u2019s adventure into cryptocurrency during its financial filing to the UK corporate registry. The company revealed that it invested almost $20 million in Ethereum between 2021 and 2022.\n\nThis development highlights the convergence of crypto with mainstream businesses, its growing adoption, and institutional attention. With crypto set to experience even more adoption as its potential becomes more prevalent, top altcoins like Ethereum, Solana, and InQubeta will likely experience significant accumulation and growth.\n\nSolana (SOL): A Top Altcoin\n\nSolana is an open-source project that leverages blockchain technology and its core values to provide DeFi (decentralized finance) solutions. The Solana protocol is designed to facilitate the creation of dApps (decentralized applications) and is widely known for its high throughput and low transaction costs.\n\nSolana is popularly known as Ethereum\u2019s competitor. Hence, its growing popularity has raised questions about whether it could become the best cryptocurrency to invest in for investors seeking alternatives to Ethereum. Moreover, it is a top ten cryptocurrency, which makes it a viable investment opportunity.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe crypto landscape is evolving at a rapid pace, which the recent investment move by OnlyFan highlights. Amidst this, the spotlight has shifted to Solana and InQubeta after the substantial investment in Ethereum by OnlyFans. Their appeal has piqued the interest of institutions and retail investors alike, making them the best cryptos to buy now.\n\nVisit InQubeta Presale\n\nJoin The InQubeta Communities\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Ethereum (ETH), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Everlodge (ELDG) emerge as the Three Bullish Cryptocurrencies to Invest in Now - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "After the decline of Bitcoin, which saw the popular cryptocurrency slump from $30,000 to $26,000 a few weeks ago, many cryptocurrencies have followed the bearish trends with a noticeable downtrend recorded. However, analysts are bullish on Ethereum (ETH), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Everlodge (ELDG) and are adding them among the top cryptos to watch out for in Q4 of 2023. These three tokens are showing signs of bullish momentum. One of the tokens is seeing a huge inflow of investors based on its use case. Let\u2019s see which token is that.\n\nSummary\n\nEthereum is predicted to reach $2000 before the end of 2023.\n\nShiba Inu sets for bullish trends.\n\nEverlodge tokens price is projected to rise to $0.035 by the end of the presale.\n\nJoin the Everlodge presale and win a luxury holiday to the Maldives\n\nEthereum (ETH) Remains Bullish Despite Market Inconsistencies\n\nWhile Bitcoin has pioneered the revolution of the financial system, Ethereum (ETH) goes one step further by serving as a network where developers can build a host of decentralized applications. Because of this excellent innovation, Ethereum has emerged as the go-to network for developers looking to build security-based applications.\n\nWith the recent victory of Grayscale over the SEC in a lawsuit allegation, ETH has pumped up in the last few days, crossing the $1700 threshold. Analysts are increasingly confident of the bullish performance of Ethereum and are backing it to reach the $2000 mark in the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nThe technical analysis shows that ETH is experiencing an uptrend. Crypto prediction platforms are also predicting a bull run for the coin. Ambcrypto forecast the coin to trade at an average price of $2,244 before the end of the year. This makes ETH one of the top cryptos to watch out for in Q4 of 2023.\n\nShiba Inu (SHIB) Enjoys Bullish Trends After Overcoming the Bear Market\n\nNormalcy is returning to the crypto market after the recent downturn witnessed in the market. Many of the cryptos are currently showing bullish momentum. Having lost considerably to bear pressure in the last few months, Shiba Inu (SHIB) is back with bullish signals, with impressive price increases over the last few days.\n\nWhile it is too early to predict whether Shiba Inu is heading to the bull market, the present performance gives cause for optimism. The SHIB token has gained 2% in the last few days. Also, the green lines are very active in the market chart, which could be a signal of a bull run coming soon.\n\nWith the series of developments going on across the Shiba Inu ecosystem, the token is poised for a monumental surge. As a result, analysts like Javon Marks are predicting that SHIB potential surge may reach a new all-time high and a record-breaking SHIB price that would provide a big leap for investors. It is one of the tokens to watch out for in the last quarter of the year.\n\nEverlodge (ELDG) \u2013 Disrupting the Traditional Real Estate Industry\n\nAlthough Ethereum and Shiba Inu are experiencing an upsurge, they can\u2019t catch up with the bullish momentum of Everlodge . Everlodge, the new platform that aims to open up the real estate industry to everyday people.\n\nTo invest in the real estate industry is usually costly, with investors expected to bring out huge amounts of money to be a real estate owner. Now, Everlodge is decentralizing the industry with the introduction of fractional ownership of real estate through property-backed NFTs. With just $100, investors can become fractional property owners of real estate on the blockchain.\n\nTo ensure the safety of investors\u2019 funds, Everlodge has been deemed safe and secure by the audits conducted by InterFi Network and BlockAudit. The liquidity of the token will be locked for eight years, while the team token will be locked for two years.\n\nThe utility token of the Everlodge platform is sold for only $0.012. With its affiliation with real estate, crypto experts have projected the ELDG token price to reach $0.035 before the end of the presale.\n\nFind out more about the Everlodge (ELDG) Presale\n\nWebsite: https://www.everlodge.io/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/everlodge\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "Matter Labs co-founder, Alex Gluchowski has proposed an idea to implement onchain judiciary into the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem.\n\nSmart contract implementation risks remain the biggest unsolved problem of Defi. L2s are equally affected.\n\n\n\nLet me pitch an idea: L1 Fork as the Court of Final Appeal.\n\n\n\nFirst, why existing solutions don't work:\n\n\n\n1) Time-locked upgrades are great for scheduled changes, but\u2026 pic.twitter.com/EcaogkZBH9 \u2014 Alex G. (\u220e, \u2206) (@gluk64) September 2, 2023\n\nAlex Gluchowski is also the developer entity behind Ethereum layer 2 rollup zkSync. In his latest post, Alex addresses the issue of deploying risk-mitigating smart contracts for DeFi protocols and Layer 2 networks.\n\nThe DeFi developer identifies that existing solutions such as time-locked upgrades or converting applications into an alternative system is not an ideal solution while protocol is infected. Onchain security councils or governance are useful but it has certain limitations.\n\n\u201cL1s don\u2019t face the same problem because they are forkable. [ ]\u2026 This doesn\u2019t work for L2s and Defi protocols, unfortunately, because we can\u2019t fork underlying native assets bridged from L1 (such as ETH),\u201d Alex said while describing the core of the problem.\n\nAs an ideal solution, Alex proposes an onchain judiciary between the DeFi ecosystem which will be similar to the real world judiciary system. It consists of higher courts and the Ethereum Supreme Court being at the top.\n\nIt is suggested that every protocol must have a smart contract for court appealing alongside governance controlled emergency upgrades. Whenever a protocol executes an emergency upgrade, anyone can appeal to the court to propose upgrade cancellation.\n\n\u201cThis court can then cancel the emergency upgrade (and do nothing else). Different courts will have different members, prices and reputation, in a completely decentralized manner,\u201d said Alex.\n\nFurthermore, Alex explains that each court will have to specify to its higher court if the decision can be appealed until the final appeal reaches the Ethereum Supreme Court. The decision here is determined by the soft-fork of the network.\n\nTo prevent misuse of this novel idea, the developer said to form a social consensus around it while adding \u2018canonical\u2019 tags on courts to identify its authority.\n\n\u201cThe most important function of such a system will be to protect protocols against political inference from the outside.\u201d Alex said, adding \u201cIt will serve as a great deterrence mechanism, and will elevate the role of Ethereum as a powerful network state.\u201d"

        "content": "Tue 05 Sep 2023 \u25aa 3 min of reading \u25aa by Mikaia A.\n\nVitalik Buterin, whose crypto portfolio is worth around 244,000 ETH, has recently disposed of several thousand tokens. No explanation for this voluminous transfer of cryptocurrencies from the Ethereum co-founder. Would he need them to develop other projects? Or simply to cover personal expenses? No one knows what he\u2019s up to. Crypto-enthusiasts are panicking. Let\u2019s find out!\n\nIn brief:\n\nVitalik Buterin has just transferred 31,000 ETH to Bitstamp and other addresses\n\n10 days ago, he already sent 300 ETH to Coinbase\n\nThe prince of cryptos dropped to $1,637.94 on the occasion, or -0.09%\n\n31,000 ETH out of Vitalik Buterin\u2019s crypto wallet\n\nTen days ago, Vitalik Buterin\u2019s crypto wallet saw a voluminous transfer of ethers. Specifically, on August 21, the Ethereum co-founder sent 600 ETH to Coinbase. He offered no explanation for this initiative. As a consolation, the crypto community engaged in speculation as to the reasons for this transfer.\n\n#PeckShieldAlert Vitalik-related address (0xD04d\u20268fd7) recently transferred ~999 $ETH (equivalent to ~$1.64M) to address 0x5567\u202631B1 ~20 days ago, this address 0x5567 previously received ~1,701 $ETH from Vitalik-related address (0xD04d\u20268fd7) and subsequently moved these funds\u2026 pic.twitter.com/n7jrKotsXq \u2014 PeckShieldAlert (@PeckShieldAlert) September 4, 2023 Details of Vitalik Buterin\u2019s latest ETH transactions\n\nEarlier this morning, PeckShieldAlert revealed another ETH transaction by Vitalik Buterin. The amount designated by Coin Edition leaves crypto analysts baffled: 31,000 ETH.\n\nMultiplying this amount by the current ether price, $1,633.87 on CoinGecko, gives us $50.623 million.\n\nAs usual, cryptocurrency investors have shown their concern over this dubious transfer.\n\nWhat are the reasons for these ETH crypto transfers?\n\nAccording to U\u00b0Today, these spaced-out exercises don\u2019t actually represent anything serious. The most plausible theory is \u201cportfolio diversification\u201d. In other words, Vitalik Buterin is cleaning up his own financial ecosystem.\n\nAnd if this isn\u2019t the case, we can\u2019t rule out the theory that he\u2019s developing a new project or cashing in his crypto holdings.\n\nWhat if he\u2019s trying to establish new strategic partnerships? Or preparing for future rounds of financing?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like he\u2019s planting seeds, but we don\u2019t yet know what kind of forest he wants to grow,\u201d reads the columns of this crypto media outlet.\n\nLastly, analysts have suggested that Vitalik Buterin is being forced to transfer ETH en masse in order to create positive ripples in the cryptocurrency market. In other words, the decline in bitcoin, as well as ether, won\u2019t last as long as druids like Buterin are around.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program!

Credit: DaLiu via Shutterstock.\n\nIn a tale of two fledgling blockchain phones, one, the Solana Saga, has slashed its selling price while the other, the Ethereum Phone, is preparing to begin shipping.\n\nBoth devices are generally aimed at fusing mobility with Web3, the third iteration of the internet that incorporates open-source software, blockchain transaction ledgers, decentralized governance, and native payments based on token-based economics.\n\nThe saga of the Saga\n\nSaga is a creation of Solana Labs, which created the Solana blockchain platform in 2020, and in June 2022 announced Solana Mobile as a subsidiary aimed at creating a Web3-focused smartphone, Saga, which debuted in the US market during April 2023.\n\nSaga is a flagship Android handset, created and built by development company OSOM, and is tightly integrated with the Solana blockchain in order to make cryptocurrency transactions and management of digital assets such as tokens and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) easily accessible via phone rather than computer, which is the more typical method. Saga represents an attempt to not only compete with established smartphone brands like Apple and Samsung but also to extend the influence of Solana, which competes with larger blockchains such as Ethereum. Both Solana and Ethereum also have their own cryptocurrencies \u2013 Solana (SOL) and ether (ETH), respectively.\n\nSolana Labs and its Solana blockchain platform are known primarily within the cryptocurrency community. Solana Mobile and the Saga phone have even less mass market name recognition. It seemed probable that Solana\u2019s Saga would struggle to attract buyers, so it wasn\u2019t a surprise that after launching at a cost of $1,000, Saga\u2019s price was slashed to $599 in August 2023. Some Saga buyers who paid the original price only to see it slashed by 40% just four months after the phone\u2019s debut have publicly expressed their displeasure, not exactly a good sign for a nascent product that needs to build goodwill.\n\nBlockchain and a Web3 ethOS\n\nSome observers attribute Saga\u2019s price reduction to the impending arrival of new competition from a company based in Delaware (US), Freedom Factory. Like many blockchain and cryptocurrency projects, Freedom Factory is a community-led effort with global reach. Its small team developed both ethOS, a free, open-source native mobile operating (OS) system, and the new Ethereum Phone, also called ethOS.\n\nHow well do you really know your competitors?

Its backers assert that ethOS, designed to be decentralized and permissionless like the Ethereum blockchain, will foster novel economics and experiences through new apps, tokens based on ERC20 (the technical standard for fungible tokens created using the Ethereum blockchain), and NFTs.\n\nPeople can already load ethOS onto select unlocked Google Pixel 3, 3XL, or 5a smartphones, but the Ethereum Phone is designed to provide a turnkey option for side-loading ethOS onto a device. The Ethereum Phone is actually a flashed version of Google\u2019s Pixel 7a using GrapheneOS 13, which is an Android fork with hardened security.\n\nPreorders for the first 50 Ethereum Phones began on August 22, 2023, and sold out in 24 hours. Particular NFTs worth 0.39 Ethers (ETH), or nearly $650, had to be minted to qualify for a preorder, which means the phone was selling at a premium, given that a regular Google Pixel 7A retails for $499 in the US. After preorders begin shipping, regular orders are slated to open in fall 2023.\n\nLooking ahead with blockchain\n\nThe promise of blockchain phones to fuse mobility and Web3 is captivating. Though it\u2019s unclear whether there will ever be a substantial market for these niche devices, their Web3-oriented features and functionalities could migrate to smartphones that are marketed to a broader swath of the mass market."

        "content": "In a recent video on her highly popular YouTube channel \u201cCrypto Tips,\u201d Heidi Chakos, a well-known crypto educator and influencer, discussed the increasing influence of Lido, a liquid staking platform, on the Ethereum network.\n\nAccording to Heidi, Lido currently controls 29% of the staking power on the Ethereum network. She pointed out that Ethereum has recently transitioned from a proof-of-work to a proof-of-stake model, which means that entities with significant staking power could have considerable influence over the network.\n\nHeidi emphasized that in Ethereum\u2019s new proof-of-stake model, a 33% staking power is akin to the 51% power in Bitcoin\u2019s proof-of-work blockchains. She warned that if any node gains 33% staking power, it could potentially compromise the network\u2019s neutrality and immutability. She clarified that Lido is not acting with malicious intent but has gained this level of influence due to being an early market player.\n\nHeidi noted that Lido offers a 10% commission rate, significantly lower than other staking options like Rocket Pool and Coinbase, which charge 15% and 25%, respectively. She attributed Lido\u2019s rapid market share growth to this competitive advantage and its user-friendly staking process, which requires only a MetaMask or a hardware wallet like Trezor.\n\nHeidi warned that if Lido encounters a bug or other issues, the entire Ethereum network could be at risk. This would affect decentralized exchanges, DeFi platforms, NFTs, and layer-two solutions. She had initially thought that centralized exchanges would pose the most significant risk of centralized control over Ethereum, but Lido has proven her wrong.\n\nAccording to Heidi, Lido is actively working to become more decentralized. She explained that when users stake through Lido, their stakes are dispersed across multiple staking operators, not just those connected to Lido. She also mentioned that Lido offers a robust bug bounty program, with up to $2 million for the discovery of any code vulnerabilities.\n\nHeidi revealed that she and her partner Toby have been staking their Ethereum on Lido, inadvertently contributing to the platform\u2019s growing influence. However, they are now considering other staking options, taking into account factors like commission rates and ease of use. She also mentioned that she would discuss other staking options in a future video.\n\nHeidi encouraged her viewers to subscribe to her channel for updates on other staking options and to join the CT Club for exclusive content. She emphasized that if Lido\u2019s influence becomes a significant concern, they would consider withdrawing their stakes, and CT Club members would be the first to know.\n\nFeatured Image via Pixabay"

        "content": "In a groundbreaking move that could reshape the landscape of blockchain governance and security, Matter Labs co-founder and CEO Alex Gluchowski has unveiled a visionary concept: an \u201cEthereum Supreme Court.\u201d This proposal envisions a hierarchical court system within the Ethereum network, mirroring real-world legal structures, and aims to provide a final recourse for parties embroiled in disputes related to smart contracts.\n\nGluchowski\u2019s motivation behind this audacious idea is to create a formidable deterrent against malicious actors and external political interference while elevating Ethereum\u2019s status as a robust network state. In this news article, we delve deeper into the concept of the Ethereum Supreme Court, exploring its mechanics, potential benefits, and the challenges it may face.\n\nThe Ethereum Supreme Court concept\n\nAt its core, the Ethereum Supreme Court concept revolves around establishing a series of on-chain courts responsible for adjudicating disputes and managing emergency upgrades within the Ethereum ecosystem. Like a traditional court system, these on-chain courts would operate hierarchically, with the ultimate authority vested in the \u201cCourt of Final Appeal\u201d at the Ethereum layer-1 level. Here\u2019s a breakdown of how this innovative proposal would function:\n\nHierarchical On-Chain courts\n\nGluchowski\u2019s vision begins with introducing hierarchical on-chain courts. Each protocol within the Ethereum network would have its governance structure, complete with mechanisms for routine and emergency upgrades. Additionally, protocols would designate a unique contract capable of triggering an appeal process.\n\nEmergency upgrade appeals\n\nAn appeal period would be initiated when a protocol necessitates an emergency upgrade. Any Ethereum user could submit a challenge to the higher court relevant to the protocol during this window. However, submitting a challenge would require a predetermined bail deposit, ensuring that only serious and well-founded disputes make it through.\n\nThe on-chain court system would be designed as a chain of appeals, with each court specifying the higher court to which appeals can be made. For instance, protocols like Aave or Uniswap might first contest matters in courts like CourtUnchained or JusticeDAO. If dissatisfied with the outcome, a party could escalate the dispute to the Ethereum Supreme Court, serving as the final destination for challengers.\n\nThe rationale behind Ethereum Supreme Court\n\nGluchowski\u2019s proposal is more than just a novel experiment in blockchain governance. It seeks to address several critical concerns within the Ethereum ecosystem while fostering a more secure and reliable network. The key motivations behind the Ethereum Supreme Court concept are as follows:\n\nOne of the primary objectives is to safeguard Ethereum protocols from external political interference. The network can insulate itself from undue influence by establishing a robust on-chain court system, thereby preserving its integrity and autonomy.\n\nThe Ethereum Supreme Court is a potent deterrence mechanism against bad actors. The threat of facing a comprehensive and impartial on-chain legal process is expected to discourage malicious intent and enhance overall network security.\n\nThis proposal aims to elevate Ethereum to a powerful network state. Ethereum can bolster its reputation as a dependable and resilient blockchain platform by providing a reliable mechanism for dispute resolution and emergency upgrades.\n\nChallenges and considerations\n\nWhile the Ethereum Supreme Court concept is undoubtedly ambitious and innovative, it has challenges and considerations. For the on-chain court system to be effective, there must be a strong social consensus within the Ethereum community. Achieving this consensus may prove challenging, as it would necessitate widespread support and adoption of the proposed framework.\n\nGluchowski acknowledges that the Ethereum Supreme Court would be expensive. Only exceptional cases warranting the attention of the entire Ethereum Layer-0 (the social consensus) would be brought before it to ensure its viability. Striking the right balance between accessibility and cost-effectiveness will be crucial.\n\nWhile the Ethereum Supreme Court represents a revolutionary idea, it\u2019s essential to acknowledge existing solutions for dispute resolution and emergency upgrades within the Ethereum ecosystem. Gluchowski argues that these solutions are less effective than the proposed on-chain court system, but the debate around their efficacy persists.\n\nConclusion\n\nAlex Gluchowski\u2019s audacious proposal for an \u201cEthereum Supreme Court\u201d has the potential to redefine how blockchain networks handle disputes and governance. Ethereum could fortify its security, protect against external influence, and enhance its reputation as a robust network state by introducing a hierarchical on-chain court system. However, the path to implementation is riddled with challenges, including the need for strong social consensus and managing the cost implications of such a system."

        "content": "A wallet linked to the now-bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange FTX has initiated a substantial migration of digital assets, transferring them from the Solana network to Ethereum.\n\nThis move, detected by blockchain analytics firm Arkham Intelligence, has raised alarm bells within the cryptocurrency community, as it may signal the onset of a series of token selloffs amid FTX\u2019s ongoing bankruptcy proceedings.\n\nSince August 31, this wallet has orchestrated the transfer of assets totaling a staggering $10.23 million, comprising $6.23 million in Ethereum and over $4 million in various altcoins.\n\nAmong the assets on the move, $1.2 million worth of FTX Token (FTT), $1.8 million in Uniswap (UNI), $1.3 million of HXRO (HXRO), $550,000 in SushiSwap (SUSHI), and $260,000 worth of Frontier Token (FRONT) have been shifted to another FTX wallet, employing the Wormhole Bridge for the transfer.\n\nThe sudden and sizable transfer of these assets has fueled speculations about the motivations and implications behind FTX\u2019s actions as it grapples with financial turmoil. Market observers are closely monitoring the situation for further developments.\n\nSolscan data reveals that FTX, despite its bankruptcy nearly a year ago, still possesses approximately seven million SOL tokens stored in cold storage wallets. These tokens are currently valued at roughly $135 million.\n\nSolana Co-Creator Advocates For Fair SOL Token Redistribution from FTX\n\nSolana\u2019s co-creator, Anatoly Yakovenko (commonly known as Toly), has advocated redistributing these SOL tokens to the former customers of the bankrupt crypto exchange.\n\nIn a Twitter exchange, Adam Cochran sought clarification, mentioning SBF\u2019s statement about some of the locked Sol tokens being contractually restricted. Yakovenko responded by expressing his desire for the Solana tokens to be directly distributed to all FTX customers, considering it the most favorable outcome.\n\n.@adamscochran if you have any influence with the ftx estate, my wish would be to distribute the sol to all the ftx customers directly. Probably the least worse outcome for everyone. \u2014 toly \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@aeyakovenko) August 31, 2023\n\nWhile acknowledging his lack of direct influence, Cochran suggested contacting relevant contacts to explore alternatives, pointing out that selling the tokens in liquidation might result in a suboptimal price.\n\nYakovenko further emphasized the potential benefits of distributing the tokens to a wider user base, estimating that this action could positively impact the network in the long run. He also argued that allowing each user to make individual decisions regarding their share could streamline the process and reduce legal complications.\n\nHowever, in a somewhat resigned tone, Yakovenko expressed his dissatisfaction with the alternative, alluding to the possibility of legal complications and unfavorable outcomes.\n\nRelated Reading | Stablecoins Market Cap Rises After 18 Months of Decline"

        "content": "On-chain analytics platform Arkham Intelligence has discovered 500 crypto wallets linked to the \u2018Grayscale Ethereum Trust\u2019.\n\nThe Trust, which offers its investors passive exposure to the price of ETH, is the second largest entity in the world by tokens held, with an AUM of $4.9 billion.\n\nThe trust is currently trading at a 30% discount to its net asset value (NAV). In June alone, the discount was 55%.\n\nSee full details below.\n\nArkham Intelligence and Grayscale discover Ethereum Trust crypto wallet\n\nLast week, Arkham Intelligence, one of the industry\u2019s most advanced on-chain analysis platforms, made a sensational discovery by finding 500 crypto wallets linked to the Grayscale Ethereum Trust.\n\nThese are the words of Arkham\u2019s insiders after the result:\n\n\u201cWe were able to identify the addresses by analysing activity and cross-referencing with Grayscale\u2019s public balances.\u201d\n\nThe fund, run by Michael Sonnenshein, is the second largest holder of ETH tokens, with a value of around $4.9 billion.\n\nArkham, in its tracking operations that led back to Grayscale\u2018s tokens, noted that a maximum of $30 million is held on each address, with a total of 2.987 million ETH in the 500 crypto wallets.\n\nThe reason for this extreme diversification is probably for security reasons, so that even if a wallet were hacked and emptied, the fund would only lose 1% of the assets managed in the trust.\n\nOther non-Ethereum ERC-20 tokens were also found in Grayscale\u2019s various wallets, including 301,488 LINK, 263,888 UNI, 5.826 million BAT, 338.47 MKR, 4,999 AAVE, 91,488 SNX and 297,523 CRV.\n\nThe fund had only $65 million in ETH at the beginning of 2020, while by the end of the year it had grown to $2.2 billion.\n\nThe growth of the crypto market and the bullish outlook for Ethereum in 2020 attracted many investors who wanted to protect themselves from the adversities of the digital asset world and embrace a regulated and safe financial product.\n\nIn 2021, the fund continued to grow like crazy, with only a small dip in AUM in May, only to recover within a few months. The year ended with assets of USD 12 billion, although the all-time high of USD 15 billion was reached in November.\n\nOn the other hand, 2022, a bearish year for the entire crypto sector, led to a capital flight for Grayscale, which lost USD 8.3 billion.\n\nIn 2023, we see a brief recovery of $1.2 billion, supported by the rally in BTC and ETH at the beginning of the year and the latest market growth in June.\n\nGrayscale Ethereum Trust: Trading at a 30% discount to NAV\n\nThe Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE), which offers passive exposure to the price of ETH, is currently trading at a 30.14% discount to its net asset value (NAV).\n\nTypically, an investment trust or exchange traded fund (ETF), while indirectly replicating the value of an asset, experiences a fluctuating price of its shares due to a variety of factors.\n\nIn general, if there is a belief that the market can explode upwards, the fund will trade at a premium, while if there is mistrust, it will trade at a discount.\n\nAt the moment, the Grayscale Trust is trading at a discount to its \u2018fair value\u2019 due to the obstacles in getting a spot ETF approved and the unstable conditions in the crypto sector.\n\nHowever, it should be noted that the discount was only 55% in mid-June, compared with 60% in January.\n\nProgress has therefore been made since the beginning of the year, reflecting increased investor confidence and a sentiment that, while still negative, is moving towards the positive.\n\nThe entry of BlackRock and other asset management funds into the sector and the various applications for a spot ETF on bitcoin and ethereum have certainly influenced the small rise in ETHE in 2023.\n\nMichael Sonnenshein\u2019s fund, which currently trades at an ETH price to market ratio of USD 10.68, could see a NAV premium of more than 100% by the end of 2020.\n\nAt one point, the value was as high as 947% above the cryptocurrency\u2019s market price.\n\nThe downside came in early 2021, when the first negative discounts to NAV were recorded as the trust\u2019s AUM grew.\n\nThe reasons for this steep decline are varied, but certainly related in part to the trust\u2019s difficulty in \u2018transforming\u2019 into a full-fledged Exchange Traded fund and investor fears due to regulatory pressures in the US.\n\nGrayscale\u2019s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), currently trading at a 20% discount to NAV, is following the same fate.\n\nIn December 2022, the trust\u2019s managers had said they would look at various situations to return money to investors if they failed to get an ETF approved.\n\nIf the SEC approves the applications from BlackRock, VanEck, Wisdom Tree, Invesco and other hedge funds, we could expect to see a pumping up of the price of these funds, resulting in a discount to NAV and a possible return to a premium.\n\nIt is also worth noting that a few days ago Grayscale won a major court battle against the SEC, which is now obliged to reconsider Sonnenschein\u2019s fund application.\n\nHowever, it is too early to declare victory: Gary Gensler and his team can postpone their decisions for a few more months and devise strategies to reject the various fund applications.\n\nThe war is still on."
