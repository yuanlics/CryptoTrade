        "content": "This constant stream of new staking participants \u2014 the current number of validators sits at about 800,000 \u2014 has been so substantial that it has even led some to propose a hard cap on the number of new validators that can enter the pool on any given day. The rationale being that the current \u201cchurn\u201d limit of 12 new validators per epoch, (which equates to 2,700 validators, 86,400 ETH, or roughly $138,000,000 per day), is unsustainable long term. A queue controls how many can join at any given time and the capacity of that queue increases as the network grows*, which could eventually stress the functionality of the network."

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nDespite uncertainty and a YoY decline, Ethereum has generated $10Bn in income in seven years.\n\nIt surpassed software giants such as Microsoft and Facebook.\n\nAs per sources, Ethereum\u2019s network revenue could grow to $51Bn per year by 2030 from the current $2.6Bn.\n\nSince its inception in 2015, Vitalik Buterin\u2019s cryptocurrency, Ethereum, has amassed $10 billion in income, beating Facebook and Microsoft in terms of growth rate.\n\nIn practice, whereas Ethereum would have taken 7.5 years to reach the $10 billion revenue milestone, Facebook (now Meta) appears to have taken somewhat longer and Microsoft a full 19 years.\n\nAs Crypto Portfolio Manager at cryptocurrency brokerage firm Caleb & Brown points out , such a result suggests that crypto protocols, like software, may be the next to become worldwide.\n\nFactors Influencing Ethereum\u2019s Earnings\n\nEthereum\u2019s popularity is driven by its versatility. Unlike Bitcoin, which primarily serves as a secure transactional network, Ethereum distinguishes itself by enabling the deployment of complex protocols across diverse industries. This adaptability makes Ethereum a preferred platform for applications in finance, gaming, art, and more.\n\nAs of September 26, Ethereum\u2019s native cryptocurrency, ETH was trading at approximately $1,625, with the Ethereum network boasting a market capitalization exceeding $195 billion.\n\nEthereum primarily generates revenue through transaction fees, denominated in gas. The cost of these fees varies depending on the complexity of the transaction.\n\nBasic transfers have lower fees, while smart contract-based transactions, which ensure trustless execution, are usually more expensive. Transaction costs increase with the complexity of network transactions.\n\nEthereum\u2019s transaction fee revenue goes to validators, who secure the network and confirm transactions. They earn block rewards and transaction fees for their role, incentivizing them to maintain network integrity and smooth operations.\n\nPositive ETH Price Outlook\n\nPositive predictions on the price of Ethereum (ETH) appear to be prevalent in September 2023.\n\nThese projections are based on ETH\u2019s past performance in comparison to BTC and its four-year halving cycle.\n\nIn reality, it appears that ETH has outperformed BTC during bull markets, but during bear markets, ETH looks to suffer more than BTC.\n\nAt the time of writing, the price of ETH had increased by more than 15% over the previous year. In fact, ETH is currently valued $1.627 . However, by mid-April 2023, ETH had reached an annual price high of more than $2,000.\n\nA $51 Billion Revenue Projection by 2030\n\nIn conclusion, the projected revenue potential of reaching $51 billion by 2030 not only underscores the untapped opportunities within the Ethereum network but also signifies the promising growth prospects that decentralized platforms may experience in the years ahead.\n\nDespite market uncertainties, Ethereum\u2019s versatility and applications position it for sustained growth, showcasing blockchain\u2019s transformative potential across industries"

        "title": "How Much Ethereum is There? - Watcher Guru",
        "content": "How Much Ethereum is There?: Exploring the Circulating and Total Supply\n\nAs the popularity of Ethereum continues to soar, many enthusiasts are curious about the supply of this cryptocurrency.\n\nHow many Ethereum are in circulation? What is the total amount of Ethereum available?\n\nIn this comprehensive guide, we will delve into the intricacies of Ethereum\u2019s supply, its unique economic model, and the future prospects of this groundbreaking blockchain platform.\n\nAlso read: Will Ethereum Recover?\n\nSource: MARCA\n\nUnderstanding Ethereum: An Overview\n\nBefore we dive into the details of ETH supply, let\u2019s first establish a basic understanding of this revolutionary blockchain platform.\n\nCreated by the visionary developer Vitalik Buterin, ETH is not just a digital currency but a robust blockchain that enables users to execute smart contracts and build decentralized applications (DApps).\n\nUnlike Bitcoin, which primarily serves as a digital currency, ETH capabilities extend far beyond simple transactions.\n\nAt the heart of Ethereum lies the ETH Virtual Machine (EVM), a digital machine that allows code execution on the blockchain.\n\nThis code consists of smart contracts, which are self-executing agreements with predefined terms and conditions.\n\nThese smart contracts enable various applications, from decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to supply chain management and decentralized social networks.\n\nHow Many Ethereum Are There in Circulation?\n\nWhen it comes to the supply, it\u2019s important to note that ETH has adopted a different approach from Bitcoin.\n\nWhile Bitcoin has a maximum supply of 21 million coins, Ethereum\u2019s supply is not capped. This strategic decision by Vitalik Buterin aimed to create a network with infinite coins, allowing for greater flexibility and scalability.\n\nEthereum\u2019s initial distribution took place in a 2015 crowd sale, resulting in the mining of roughly 72 million coins in the Genesis block.\n\nThese coins were used for various purposes, including funding the platform\u2019s development and rewarding miners for validating transactions.\n\nSince then, the circulating supply has continued to increase.\n\nAs of April 2022, the circulating supply of ETH has exceeded 120 million coins. This means that over 120 million ETH tokens are currently in circulation and actively being traded on various cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Ethereum\u2019s mining process is notably faster than Bitcoin, producing a new block every 13-15 seconds.\n\nThis allows for a more rapid expansion of Ethereum\u2019s supply compared to Bitcoin.\n\nSource: Pixabay\n\nThe Total Supply of Ethereum\n\nWhile the circulating supply of ETH provides insights into the number of coins actively in circulation, the total supply of ETH encompasses all the coins that have been mined or will be mined in the future.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, ETH does not have a maximum supply, distinguishing it from Bitcoin\u2019s finite supply. This key difference has important implications for the economics and long-term prospects of ETH.\n\nBecause ETH doesn\u2019t have a capped supply, it\u2019s crucial to grasp how new coins enter the ecosystem.\n\nAlso read: US Excess Savings Depleted, Will it Impact Stocks And Crypto?\n\nEthereum proof-of-work (PoW)\n\nCurrently, ETH operates on a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism, similar to Bitcoin. Miners use computational power to solve complex mathematical problems and validate transactions on the Ethereum network.\n\nMiners receive newly minted ETH coins, called block rewards, as a reward for their efforts.\n\nHowever, ETH is in the process of transitioning from the PoW consensus mechanism to a proof-of-stake (PoS) model.\n\nThis upgrade, known as Ethereum 2.0, aims to enhance scalability, security, and sustainability. Under the PoS model, validators are selected to create new blocks and validate transactions based on the number of Ethereum tokens they hold and are willing to \u201cstake\u201d as collateral.\n\nThe shift to PoS will have significant implications for the supply of ETH. Unlike PoW, where mining constantly mints new coins, PoS doesn\u2019t create new coins as block rewards.\n\nInstead, users of the Ethereum network reward validators with transaction fees.\n\nThis change in the incentive structure may lead to a reduction in the rate of Ethereum supply growth over time.\n\nThe Impact of ETH Upgrades on Supply\n\nThe transition to Ethereum 2.0 and the PoS consensus mechanism has sparked much speculation about the future supply of Ethereum.\n\nExperts predict slower supply growth due to no block rewards, possibly causing ETH price deflationary pressure.\n\nEIP-1559, Ethereum\u2019s recent upgrade, burns part of transaction fees paid on the network.\n\nThis burning of coins reduces the overall supply of ETH, further contributing to potential deflationary effects. The upgrade also aims to improve the user experience by making transaction fees more predictable and efficient.\n\nThese upgrades will affect supply, but they\u2019re ongoing, and their full effects remain unseen.\n\nHowever, they represent significant milestones in Ethereum\u2019s evolution and demonstrate the platform\u2019s commitment to scalability, sustainability, and innovation.\n\nThe Future of Ethereum\u2019s Supply\n\nAs Ethereum continues to evolve and adapt to the changing landscape of blockchain technology, the future of its supply remains uncertain.\n\nEthereum\u2019s supply surpasses 120 million, but upgrades and PoS could make it more controlled and deflationary.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that the supply of Ethereum is not the sole determinant of its value.\n\nEthereum\u2019s price relies on its demand for decentralized apps and diverse uses, making demand a key factor.\n\nEthereum leads in DeFi, NFTs, and innovation, attracting users and investors with its strong value proposition.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the supply of ETH is a dynamic and ever-evolving aspect of this groundbreaking blockchain platform.\n\nWhile Ethereum\u2019s supply is not capped like Bitcoin, the ongoing upgrades and transition to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism may have significant implications for its future supply growth.\n\nAs ETH continues to revolutionize the world of decentralized applications and smart contracts, its supply dynamics will undoubtedly play a crucial role in shaping its long-term success."

        "content": "Ethereum sharding promises to scale the Ethereum network significantly.\n\nProto-danksharding, the first upgrade in the sharding roadmap, introduces a new concept called blobs.\n\nThis article explains what blobs are and how they improve Ethereum\u2019s scalability.\n\nSeveral years later, scalability remains a major pain point for the Ethereum network. Multiple solutions have been proposed to solve this problem, including sharding the network.\n\nSharding involves splitting the Ethereum network into smaller units that act as smaller blockchains secured by a rotating set of validators, lightening the cost of storing data on the blockchain. While having the potential to improve the scalability of the network exponentially, sharding requires multiple complex upgrades, which can be risky if done all at once.\n\nEnter proto-danksharding, also known as EIP-4844. Proto-danksharding introduces most of the changes needed for actual sharding without sharding the network. The core part of this upgrade introduces a new concept called blobs, from which the alternative name Shard Blob Transactions is derived. In this article, DailyCoin explores blobs and how they help scale the Ethereum network.\n\nWhat Is an Ethereum Blob?\n\nBlobs are inexpensive and temporary memory carrying data about transactions, called blob-carrying transactions. These blobs are designed to make the verification of these transactions more efficient.\n\nInstead of verifying each transaction in the block, the network will only have to confirm that the blob attached to the block carries the correct data. The transactions in these blob-carrying blocks will typically be related to Layer 2 networks, like Optimism, which stores data on Ethereum to share in its security guarantees. The temporary nature of these blobs ensures that they do not perpetually occupy space on the Ethereum network.\n\nWhat Does This Mean for Ethereum Scalability?\n\nMost of the fees on Layer 2 networks go to storing data on Ethereum. However, with blobs, the amount of work necessary to keep this data on the Ethereum network is significantly reduced, allowing faster processing and cheaper costs.\n\nWith the implementation of EIP-4844, two different fee marketplaces will be created, one for Layer 1 execution and another for blobs, as the blob data does not fit into the current Ethereum fee market. While the additional fee market will work like the current fee market in line with EIP-1559, the separation means that congestion on the Ethereum network will not affect fees for blobs, allowing for low fees even during peak network congestion.\n\nThe proto-danksharding upgrade, which will introduce blobs, was previously expected later this year with Dencun. But, in a recent call, core developers highlighted that they might be forced to delay the Dencun upgrade till 2024. Following the implementation of EIP-4844 on the Ethereum network, Layer 2 networks will also have to carry out upgrades to support blobs.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nEthereum Layer 2 users will feel the most significant effect of introducing blobs.\n\nLayer 2 networks must still implement separate upgrades to support the new feature.\n\nDevelopers assert that full sharding will take years.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nEthereum\u2019s scalability concerns have long served as a severe bottleneck. Introducing blobs with EIP-4844 takes the network closer to full sharding, which promises to scale the network exponentially while immediately bringing down costs on Layer 2s.\n\nRead this to learn more about Ethereum\u2019s Dencun upgrade:\n\nEthereum\u2019s Next Major Upgrade Likely to Be Delayed: Core Devs\n\n\n\nWorried about the imminent government shutdown.

        "content": "The historic Merge upgrade from Sept. 2022 \u2014 which marked Ethereum\u2019s transition from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS) \u2014 resulted in the overall decline in compliance with standards laid down by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC).\n\nEthereum blocks adhering to OFAC compliance censor certain transactions, which has a negative impact on the neutrality of the Ethereum ecosystem. In early August 2022, OFAC sanctioned Tornado Cash and several Ether (ETH) addresses associated with it due to its ability to mask and anonymize transactions.\n\nBefore the Merge upgrade, Ethereum\u2019s OFAC compliance increased exponentially as entities such as crypto exchanges opted to run censoring MEV-Boost relays on their validators. The list of top censorship offenders is populated by popular platforms such as Binance, Celsius Network, Bitfinex, Ledger Live, Huobi (HTX) and Coinbase, according to MEV Watch data.\n\nList of entities running censoring MEV relays on their validators are actively harming Ethereum\u2019s credible neutrality. Source: MEV Watch\n\nHowever, the overall OFAC compliance of Ethereum blocks has declined significantly. In November 2022, 78% of the total Ethereum blocks complied with OFAC regulations. As of today, Sept. 27, Ethereum\u2019s OFAC compliance dropped to 30%, recording an overall reduction of 57%.\n\nPost-Merge daily OFAC-compliant Ethereum blocks. Source: MEV Watch\n\nCountering OFAC compliance requires operators to use relays that do not censor according to OFAC compliance requirements. There are seven major MEV-boost relays that are most commonly used: Flashbots, BloXroute Max Profit, BloXroute Ethical, BloXroute Regulated, BlockNative, Manifold and Eden. However, not all systems adhere to OFAC compliance, according to MEV Watch:\n\n\u201cOf the 7 available major relays only 3 do not censor according to OFAC compliance requirements.\u201d\n\nIt is also important to note that not all blocks built by OFAC-compliant relays are censoring; however, all blocks built by OFAC-compliant relays will censor when non-compliant transactions are broadcast to the network.\n\nWhile OFAC regulations primarily target United States-based organizations, validators outside the U.S. must consider running non-censoring relays for the benefit of the network.\n\nRelated: US Treasury sanctions Ethereum wallet tied to cartel over \u2018illicit fentanyl trafficking\u2019\n\nAmid Ethereum\u2019s reduced OFAC compliance, Grayscale made the decision to abandon all the rights to PoW Ethereum tokens (ETHPoW).

        "content": "In May 2022, Protos predicted that Ethereum\u2019s major Merge to proof-of-stake would encourage centralization. Yesterday, Ethereum Foundation\u2019s Danny Ryan admitted to a \u201ccorporatization, a centralization, and a systemic threat.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat happens when a regulator realizes that three people control the vote?\u201d Ryan wondered, adding, \u201cI got three doors to knock on. Easy.\u201d The three \u2018doors\u2019 in question are the three validators who now control over 85% of Ethereum\u2019s liquid staking validation: Lido, Coinbase, and Binance.\n\nIncredibly, in May 2022, Vitalik Buterin believed no liquid staking service would exceed 15%. With three services now owning 85%, well, that ship has clearly sailed.\n\nLido is Ethereum\u2019s largest known validator. It is three times larger than the next-largest validator, Coinbase, and seven times larger than Binance. Ryan has admitted concern that Lido, Coinbase, and Binance could eventually gain control over one-third of Ethereum\u2019s entire validator set \u2014 both liquid stakes and traditional, illiquid stakes.\n\nLido is the most powerful validator on Ethereum\n\nLido ascended to preeminence by helping users evade Ethereum\u2019s lockup time commitment for proof-of-stake validation rewards. Rather than requiring users to stake ETH into a regular validator for months without access to their capital, Lido allows users to have their cake and eat it too. Specifically, Lido accepted ETH from depositors and immediately gives them its proprietary version of ETH, stETH, that it pledges to honor at a 1:1 peg.\n\nObviously, most users prefer to receive their capital back and invest it elsewhere, rather than surrender their capital entirely. Even better, Lido passes along most of the staking rewards that it earns from staking its ETH to stETH holders through a blockchain process called rebasing.\n\nThe current market distribution of Validators:\n\n\n\nThe issue isn't just where stake is deposited; it's about who controls it.\n\n\n\nEthereum faces a pressing challenge: a limited set of node operators controlled by centralized entities.\n\n\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f Implications for Ethereum:\n\n\n\n\u2013 Systemic risks\u2026 pic.twitter.com/sznSz5c5Xo \u2014 Mohak Agarwal (@mohakagr) September 21, 2023\n\nRead more: Uncovering Ethereum\u2019s close ties to Chinese money\n\nFinally and as if its offer was not already appealing enough, Lido is a full-service offering that allows everyday users to earn proof-of-stake rewards that are inaccessible to non-technically savvy ETH holders. Lido simplifies all of the complex hardware, software, and internet requirements of Ethereum validation into a simple interface: deposit ETH and receive 1:1 pegged stETH that automatically rebases to reward you. Voil\u00e0.\n\nSo, in summary, not only does Lido give users instant liquidity (stETH) for locked-up capital (staked ETH), but it also rewards stETH holders with generous APRs: currently 3.6%. Even better, Lido simplifies this entire process to a few website clicks.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Lido has grown consistently since launch, powered by its generous offers, resilience, and stETH:ETH peg with deep liquidity. Its governance token boasts a $1.3 billion market capitalization. Its flagship liquid staking token, stETH, is worth $13.9 billion \u2014 the seventh largest crypto asset in the world.\n\nLido\u2019s two tokens are approximately twice the size of Dogecoin. Excluding stablecoins, Lido is the world\u2019s fifth-largest crypto asset. It controls 7% of all circulating ETH and two-thirds of all liquid-staked ETH.\n\nETH in Layer 2s are custodied in small multi-sig teams\n\nWorse, other areas of proof-of-stake Ethereum are also centralizing. Blockchair lead developer Nikita Zhavoronkov also bemoaned Ethereum roll-ups, also known as layer 2s. \u201cThe said L2 \u2018revolution\u2019 is just a bunch of private companies trying to take over cryptos,\u201d he posted on X (formerly Twitter) on Monday.\n\nIndeed, all ETH in the three largest Ethereum layer 2s \u2014 Arbitrum, Optimism, and Base \u2014 are custodied in multisig wallets controlled by trusted, corporate signers. All three have promised to decentralize the these wallets into their community\u2026 sometime in the future.\n\nZhavoronkov continued, \u201cEthereum\u2019s scaling plan is now a pile of centralized rollups with admin keys. Scaling layer 1 yields the true decentralization.\u201d\n\nRead more: Ethereum since Shanghai is worse on at least a half dozen benchmarks\n\nHe similarly expressed concern about Ethereum centralization in layer 2s. \u201cEthereum got stuck the same way Bitcoin did: its blocks became full, the devs refused to increase the gas limit. Just like Bitcoin got corrupted by centralized L2s (Lightning), Ethereum now has L2s with admin keys of its own.\u201d\n\nCrypto Coffee also questioned the decentralization of layer 2s. \u201cCentralized L2s are a psyop for mainstream sellout.\u201d\n\nAttorney Preston Byrne agreed that most Ethereum protocols are vulnerable to subpoenas and legal action due to their centralized operators.\n\nGot a tip?

Trading volumes have doubled over the past two days as analyst\u2019s speculate over the potential approval of Ethereum futures exchange-traded funds in the US.\n\nLet\u2019s dig in.\n\nBullish buying\n\nInvestors are keen on Ethereum as analysts predict futures ETFs could go live from early October.\n\nStay ahead of the game with our weekly newsletters Subscribe\n\nThe second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalisation is up more than 2% since a week ago. It bucked a slump in crypto prices which has seen Bitcoin shed 0.7% and Ripple\u2019s XRP drop 1% in the same period.\n\nEthereum trading volume has perked up this week, too. Daily volumes doubled from about $200 million on Tuesday to over $430 million on Thursday.\n\nInstitutional investors have also become more optimistic on the cryptocurrency. FalconX\u2019s head of research, David Lewant, detailed investor activity on the platform over the past week.\n\n\u201cOur Ethereum flow also tilted more bullish,\u201d he said, noting that 59% of the firm\u2019s flow was on the buy side, compared to 50% for Bitcoin. Ethereum buying was up from 42% the previous week, Bitcoin was unchanged.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nWhile Bitcoin continues to be more popular, doing 1.6 times the volume of Ethereum, its supremacy has fallen. This was the first time in nine weeks that it was lower than twice Ethereum\u2019s volume.\n\nAn Ethereum futures ETF could be approved as soon as this week, according to speculation from ETF analysts.\n\nReports in August said the US Securities and Exchange Commission may approve Ethereum futures ETFs as soon as October.\n\nThe government shutdown in the US may speed up the process.\n\nThere\u2019s a 90% chance Ethereum futures ETFs launch in October, according to a note from Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst\u2019s Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart.\n\nThe pair expect these products will start trading from the week of October 9.\n\nCrypto market movers\n\nBitcoin fell 1% over the last day, down 0.5% over the past week.\n\nEthereum was flat since Wednesday, but has added over 2% in the past week as sentiment improved.\n\nAltcoins were down across the board.

        "title": "Ethereum Address Checksum Explained - Checksummed vs non-Checksummed ETH Address - CoinCodex",
        "content": "Ethereum addresses can be written in two ways - in a non-checksummed variety with all lower case letters and checksummed version that includes capital letters. Checksummed addresses are preferable to their non-checksummed counterparts since they ensure address validity and prevent potential typos. Ethereum addresses can be easily checksummed using any of the popular blockchain explorer services.\n\nWhat is the ETH checksum function and why do capital letters matter in crypto addresses?\n\nEthereum address checksum validation is a cryptographic function that allows users to verify their blockchain addresses to ensure they are valid and don't contain any typos. Your Ethereum address\u2013as well as every other Ethereum address in existence\u2013has two versions - one that includes uppercase letters and one that doesn\u2019t. These are called the checksummed and non-checksummed versions.\n\nHere\u2019s an example of the same address as a:\n\nEthereum Non-checksummed version :\n\n0x12ae66cdc592e10b60f9097a7b0d3c59fce29876\n\n: 0x12ae66cdc592e10b60f9097a7b0d3c59fce29876 Ethereum Checksummed version:\n\n0x12AE66CDc592e10B60f9097a7b0D3C59fce29876\n\nThis case sensitivity is used for checksum validation. The address is compared against the raw binary keccak-256 hash of the address bytes, and where there are letters in the same corresponding place as a \u201c1\u201d bit, the letter is capitalized.\n\nIn simpler terms, checksum validation is a way to tell if an address is valid and doesn\u2019t contain any typos. While both addresses are viable and lead to the same destination, using the checksummed version is always preferable.\n\nIt might seem redundant to anyone who only copy-pastes addresses (which you should always do and never enter a hexadecimal address by hand), if even one character of an address is off, any tokens or coins sent to the wrong address will be lost forever.\n\nThis is not something to be taken lightly and soft errors in your RAM, the switch of a bit from a 0 to a 1, caused by occurrences like cosmic rays, do happen. Unbeknownst to you, the address stored in your clipboard could be different from the one you copied. Such unfortunate situations can easily be prevented with checksum.\n\nHow to perform checksum and prevent sending tokens to the wrong Ethereum address?\n\nWith the importance of Ethereum checksum addresses outlined in the paragraphs above, you are now probably wondering how to checksum your own Ethereum address. There are multiple services that convert non-checksummed Ethereum addresses to checksummed addresses, but we found the easiest way is to use etherscan.io:\n\n1. Go to etherscan.io\n\nUse your preferred internet browser to navigate to ethererscan.io. It is worth noting that you can use any of the other Ethereum blockchain explorer services\u2013like Ethplorer and Etherchain, for instance\u2013to checksum a blockchain address.\n\n2. Insert your Ethereum address in the search field\n\nEnter an Ethereum address you wish to convert to a checksum version in the search box located at the top of the webpage. As a side note, we\u2019ve blurred out the last five digits of the Ethereum address used in the guide for privacy reasons.\n\n3. You will be taken to an overview of the inputted address\n\nAfter searching for the Ethereum address entered in the search field, you will be taken to an overview page showing various publicly available data\u2013like current ETH balance, transaction history, and more\u2013pertaining to the address you\u2019ve searched for. In the upper left corner of the page, you can see the blockchain address (highlighted in red in the image below).\n\n4. Your checksummed Ethereum address can be found at the top of the page\n\nA checksummed version of the Ethereum address is listed on the address overview page. This can be verified by checking if it contains capital letters.\n\nThat's it \u2014 you\u2019ve successfully checksummed your Ethereum address and helped avoid losing funds by mistakenly sending coins to the incorrect address.\n\nWhy Ethereum doesn\u2019t use checksummed blockchain addresses by default?\n\nYou might be asking yourself why don\u2019t Ethereum addresses already come with checksum as standard, which is the case with Bitcoin wallet addresses?\n\nNot too long ago, Ethereum addresses did not have any checksum at all, and it was only in 2016 that Ethereum co-founder and lead developer Vitalik Buterin implemented the function due to popular demand.\n\nHis reasoning as to why Ethereum addresses did not come with checksum implemented at the get-go is that users should never have to interact with the hexadecimal version of the addresses at all, as Ethereum is supposed to eventually transition to actual domain names like \u201cBobsEtherAddress.eth\u201d for Ethereum addresses and ICAP address versions, compatible with systems using the International Bank Account Number or IBAN conventions.\n\nIt is worth noting that in late 2021, the Ethereum Name Service, a decentralized name system built on Ethereum, started providing users the option to attach easy-to-remember domain names to their ETH addresses. ENS, which was initially developed by Ethereum Foundation programers Nick Johnson and Alex Van de Sande, is designed to work similarly to Domain Naming Service (DNS), which maps domain names (e.g. coincodex.com) to IP addresses. In principle similar to DNS, ENS allows users to use domain names (e.g. coincodex.eth) instead of a long string of numbers and letters when transferring ETH and ERC20 tokens.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nDue to the nature of cryptocurrencies, you are the sole owner of your address and your funds. There is no higher authority to appeal to in the event of a mistake. While some services can\u2019t read checksum addresses, they will simply ignore the capital letters and process your address as normal, meaning there is no disadvantage to always using a checksummed address.\n\nIf you're looking to learn about other interesting topics related to Ethereum, make sure to check out our article exploring the concept of the Ethereum triple halving and why it could make Ethereum a good investment over the long term."

Ethereum reached $10B in revenue faster than Facebook.\n\nAnd Microsoft. And Shopify. And Zoom. And Salesforce.\n\nIn fact, the only company to do it faster is\u2026 Google.\n\nThe cool thing is Ethereum isn\u2019t even a company.\n\nIt\u2019s a decentralized network. So, all that revenue goes back to network stakers that help keep Ethereum up and running.\n\nIt\u2019s a win-win for everyone.\n\nCrypto custody is a lot like building a home: there\u2019s no cutting corners.\n\nThe big difference? There\u2019s no easy fix at the store if you lose your digital assets.\n\nThat\u2019s why you need solid infrastructure from the start.

And one of the things that makes it so popular is\u2026 skins.\n\nThese are in-game assets that have no functional purpose, but they make you look cool.\n\nSkins are in a lot of games (like Fortnite and Call of Duty) but there\u2019s a big difference with Counter-Strike\u2026 the skins can be traded.\n\nAnd the market is lucrative. My researchers tell me some of these Counter-Strike skins are going for $100K+.\n\nThe most expensive one? This knife skin had a $1.5M bid on it last year. (btw, the bid was rejected)\n\nAs a result, trading Counter-Strike skins has turned into a billion-dollar market.\n\nWell, turns out that one of the most popular trading platforms is actually a blockchain-based marketplace, called DMarket.\n\nIt uses the Mythos blockchain\n\nUsers purchase a skin and get an on-chain receipt which can be used to redeem the asset in-game\n\nAssets are technically off-chain, but the receipts are recorded on-chain\n\nAccording to CryptoSlam, DMarket has seen $220M+ in total sales volume, with most of it coming from Counter-Strike skins.\n\nWhy this matters: Gamers HATE anything (and everything) related to crypto.\n\nBlockchains. NFTs. Web3.\n\nYou name it. They despise it.\n\nThe funny thing is that NFTs and digital collectibles are pretty similar.\n\nBut when gamers see NFTs, they freak the f*ck out. (in a bad way)\n\nWhen they see digital collectibles, they also freak the f*ck out. (but in a good way)\n\nSo, what DMarket is doing is pretty clever. It\u2019s what I call a Trojan Horse.\n\nInstead of throwing fancy buzzwords at gamers, they created a Web2 user experience on the front end and hid all blockchain technology in the back end.\n\nIt\u2019s like when my mom used to make me mac & cheese growing up. She always said it was made from scratch and with love. Lots of love.\n\nThen when I got older, she told me the secret\u2026\n\nI\u2019d been eating Kraft Easy Mac my whole life. She just hid the boxes it came in.\n\nWell, the same thing is happening with DMarket and Counter-Strike skins.\n\nThe result?

        "content": "Ethereum price is attempting a fresh increase above $1,620 against the US Dollar. ETH must settle above $1,620 and $1,650 to start a decent increase.\n\nEthereum is attempting a recovery wave above the $1,600 level.\n\nThe price is trading above $1,600 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere is a key bullish trend line forming with support near $1,600 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair could start a decent increase if there is a close above $1,620 and $1,650.\n\nEthereum Price Holds Ground\n\nEthereum\u2019s price remained well-supported above the $1,580 level. ETH formed a base above $1,600 and recently moved a few points higher, like Bitcoin.\n\nThere was a move above the $1,620 level but upsides were limited. A high was formed near $1,633 before there was a strong bearish reaction. The price trimmed most gains and revisited the $1,580 zone. A low is formed near $1,583 and the price is now rising.\n\nEthereum is trading above $1,600 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is also a key bullish trend line forming with support near $1,600 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.\n\nOn the upside, the price might face resistance near the $1,608 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $1,633 swing high to the $1,583 low. The next major resistance is $1,620. It is close to the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $1,633 swing high to the $1,583 low.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nA push above $1,620 might send Ether further higher in the coming sessions. The main hurdle is still near the $1,650 and $1,660 levels. If the bulls succeed in clearing the $1,660 hurdle, the price could start a decent increase toward the $1,720 resistance. Any more gains might open the doors for a move toward $1,800.\n\nAnother Drop in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $1,620 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,600 level and the trend line.\n\nThe next key support is $1,580, below which the price could test the $1,540 support. A downside break below the $1,540 support might spark strong bearish moves. In the stated case, there could be a drop toward the $1,450 level.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bearish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now above the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $1,580\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $1,620\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "Ethereum Name Service is getting easier and cheaper to use, says founder - Blockworks",
        "content": "It was only a year after the launch of the Ethereum mainnet that Nick Johnson began building the Ethereum Name Service, or ENS \u2014 a tool for assigning human-readable names to otherwise-complicated sequences of letters and numbers that describe Ethereum addresses.\n\n\u201cIt was one of the first projects I started working on at the Ethereum Foundation and then spun out to its own organization,\u201d he says, \u201cand we\u2019ve been building it ever since.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m incredibly impressed with what we\u2019ve achieved,\u201d he says, \u201cbut, you know, it\u2019s only the beginning of what we\u2019re working on.\u201d\n\nOn the 0xResearch podcast (Spotify/Apple), Johnson details his vision for the future of the service, with plans to make the service \u201ceven more useful\u201d with layer-2 support, an improved user interface and greater functionality.\n\nOne priority, Johnson says, is that a user should expect to be able to enter an ENS name anywhere that an ether (ETH) address can be entered. A user should \u201cbe surprised when it isn\u2019t supported rather than having to check that it is,\u201d he says. \u201cI think we\u2019re close, but not there yet for that.\u201d\n\nAnother crucial element of the vision involves increasing transparency and lowering costs. \u201cThat\u2019s our big focus at the moment.\u201d\n\nThis work involves rolling out layer-2s for low-cost registrations, Johnson explains, as well as adding enhancements that make it easier for users to issue subnames. These improvements would enable organizations like Coinbase to use either a layer-2 or \u201chost names entirely off-chain.\u201d\n\nWith these improvements, name owners would have greater control over the \u201ctrust model\u201d of how their names and subdomains are managed, Johnson says. \u201cWe\u2019re focusing on that mostly at the moment by building tooling that makes it easier for people to work on [layer-2],\u201d he says.\n\nDo you know Google\u2019s IP address?\n\nJohnson adds that while it\u2019s been possible to host names on layer-2 for more than a year, it needs to be easier to set up. \u201cWhat\u2019s been missing is the easy plug and play tooling that makes it trivial for someone to do that,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cAt the moment, the integration overhead is a bit higher,\u201d he admits. \u201cSo that\u2019s our main focus on the back end. And then on the front end, it\u2019s all corresponding work to make the usability meet the feature set on the back end.\u201d\n\nJohnson says the company has been speaking to wallet providers to enable the naming of wallets, \u201cwhich has always been a long term vision of mine.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe wallet sign-up flow should include naming the wallet,\u201d he says. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have to even know or care what your Ethereum address is any more than you do what your IP address is.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I asked you what Google\u2019s IP address was, you couldn\u2019t tell me because there\u2019s no reason you would know that \u2014 and there\u2019s no reason you would want to know that,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd IP addresses are a lot shorter than Ethereum addresses. They\u2019re a lot easier to memorize.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe same degree of usability ought to apply to Ethereum, to crypto in general.\u201d\n\nSetting up a wallet should involve picking a name, Johnson says, that can be pseudonymous and disconnected from other wallets to ensure privacy. \u201cUltimately, we create accounts because we want to transact with them,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cAt some point, that involves giving that address to someone else or some third party or site or whatever, and this just makes that an order of magnitude easier.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "Will Ethereum Recover? A Deep Dive into the Future of ETH\n\nCryptocurrencies have taken the financial world by storm, and Ethereum (ETH) has been at the forefront of this revolution.\n\nAs one of the largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, Ethereum has gained significant attention from investors, traders, and enthusiasts alike.\n\nHowever, the recent market volatility and regulatory concerns have left many wondering: Will Ethereum recover and continue its upward trajectory?\n\nIn this article, we will explore the future of Ethereum, analyzing key factors such as its transition to a proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain, price forecasts, and the overall market sentiment.\n\nAlso read: Cloud & Crypto-Based Gaming the End for Xbox, PlayStation?\n\nSource: CNN\n\nUnderstanding Ethereum\u2019s Current Challenges\n\nBefore diving into Ethereum\u2019s recovery potential, it\u2019s essential to understand its current challenges.\n\nOne of the main concerns is the transition from a proof-of-work (PoW) to a proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain, also known as the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade.\n\nThis transition addresses scalability issues and reduces energy consumption, making the network more sustainable.\n\nThe shift to PoS introduces a new consensus mechanism where validators are chosen to create new blocks based on the number of coins they hold and are willing to \u201cstake\u201d as collateral.\n\nWhile PoS has several advantages over PoW, such as increased security and scalability, the transition process has been complex and time-consuming.\n\nAs a result, Ethereum has faced delays and uncertainty, causing some investors to question its future prospects.\n\nAdditionally, the crypto market has experienced significant volatility, with prices of many cryptocurrencies fluctuating wildly.\n\nConcerns over regulatory actions and potential bans in certain countries have also added to the uncertainty surrounding Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies. These challenges have led to price fluctuations and dampened investor sentiment.\n\nAlso read: Crypto-Friendly Banks in Europe?\n\nThe Potential of Proof-of-Stake (PoS) Blockchain\n\nOne of the key factors driving Ethereum\u2019s ability to recover is the transition to a PoS blockchain. PoS has several advantages over PoW, including reduced energy consumption, increased security, and improved scalability.\n\nPoS allows for a more sustainable and environmentally friendly blockchain network by eliminating the need for resource-intensive mining.\n\nThe shift to PoS is a vital Ethereum milestone, addressing network scalability issues.\n\nAdditionally, PoS will reward users for staking their ETH in the network.\n\nThe PoS shift will introduce staking rewards for users who participate by staking their ETH.\n\nThis incentivizes users to hold and stake their coins, potentially reducing selling pressure and increasing demand for ETH. As more users participate in staking, the network\u2019s security is strengthened, further enhancing Ethereum\u2019s appeal to investors.\n\nPrice Forecasts: What the Experts Say\n\nSource: Forbes\n\nPrice forecasts can provide valuable insights into the future performance of Ethereum.\n\nWhile it\u2019s important to approach these forecasts cautiously, they can help inform investment decisions and shape market sentiment.\n\nLet\u2019s look at some of the price predictions made by experts and analysts.\n\nCoinCodex Study\n\nAccording to a study by CoinCodex, Ethereum could recover to a price of $28,700 by the end of 2025. This analysis considers Ethereum\u2019s price volatility and the cyclical nature of Bitcoin halvings, which historically put upward pressure on the entire crypto market.\n\nCrypto trader Kaleo has predicted that Ethereum could hit $3,000 in 2023. Kaleo has a track record of successful market trend predictions, although predictions should be cautiously approached.\n\nRenowned investor Cathie Wood, CEO of Ark Invest, is massively bullish on Ethereum. She has estimated that Ethereum could reach all-time highs of between $170,000 and $180,000 by 2030.\n\nWood is optimistic because Ethereum can disrupt traditional finance and underpins the DeFi ecosystem.\n\nThese predictions highlight the potential for Ethereum\u2019s price to rise significantly in the coming years. However, it\u2019s important to remember that the crypto market is highly volatile and subject to various external factors, so caution should always be exercised when making investment decisions.\n\nIs Ethereum a Good Investment?\n\nWhether Ethereum is a good investment depends on various factors, including your risk tolerance, investment goals, and market outlook.\n\nWhile Ethereum has shown significant growth and a strong track record, it\u2019s essential to consider both the potential rewards and risks of investing in this cryptocurrency.\n\nOne of the key advantages of Ethereum is its position as the leading smart contract platform. Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with predefined conditions, enabling decentralized applications to run on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nThe widespread adoption of smart contracts has opened up various possibilities, from decentralized finance to non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and decentralized exchanges (DEXs).\n\nFurthermore, the transition to a PoS blockchain with Ethereum 2.0 has the potential to increase the network\u2019s scalability and security significantly. This upgrade could attract more developers and users to the Ethereum ecosystem, driving demand for ETH and potentially increasing its value.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s important to consider the risks associated with investing in Ethereum. The crypto market is highly volatile, and prices can fluctuate rapidly. Regulatory actions and government interventions can also impact the market sentiment and the value of cryptocurrencies.\n\nAdditionally, technological risks, such as potential vulnerabilities in smart contracts or security breaches, should be considered.\n\nWhether Ethereum is a good investment depends on your circumstances and risk tolerance.\n\nDoing thorough research, consulting with financial advisors, and only investing what you can afford to lose is always recommended.\n\nThe Future of Ethereum: Eth Price Around the Merge\n\nSource: Reuters\n\nOne of the most anticipated events for Ethereum is the upcoming merge, which will combine the existing PoW chain with the new PoS chain.\n\nThis merger aims to bring together the best of both worlds, combining the security and decentralization of PoW with the efficiency and sustainability of PoS.\n\nThe merge is expected to impact the Ethereum network and its price significantly.\n\nAs the network transitions to a more energy-efficient and scalable PoS consensus mechanism, it could attract more investors and developers to the ecosystem. This increased interest and participation could drive up the demand for ETH and positively impact its price.\n\nMoreover, the merger will also introduce changes to the Ethereum supply dynamics. With PoS, users can stake their ETH and earn staking rewards.\n\nThis process incentivizes users to hold onto their coins, potentially reducing the selling pressure and increasing demand for ETH. As the supply of ETH on exchanges decreases, it could create upward pressure on the price.\n\nWhile predicting the exact price movements around the merger is challenging, the general sentiment is optimistic. The market anticipates the merger will unlock new potential for Ethereum, positioning it as a leading blockchain platform and potentially driving its price higher.\n\nTechnical Analysis and Price Forecasts\n\nTechnical analysis can provide valuable insights into the future price movements of Ethereum based on historical data and market trends.\n\nAnalysts can make predictions about the future direction of ETH\u2019s price by analyzing price charts and using various indicators.\n\nBased on artificial intelligence-assisted technical analysis, some price forecasts suggest that Ethereum could experience significant growth in the coming years.\n\nThese forecasts consider historical price patterns, trading volume, and market sentiment.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s important to remember that technical analysis is not foolproof and should be used with other forms of analysis and information.\n\nThe crypto market is highly volatile and can be influenced by various factors, including market sentiment, regulatory actions, and global economic conditions.\n\nLong-Term Ethereum Price Outlook\n\nLooking beyond the short-term price fluctuations, the long-term outlook for Ethereum to recover remains promising. As one of the most established cryptocurrencies with a robust ecosystem, Ethereum is well-positioned to continue its growth and innovation.\n\nGrowing dApp use, DeFi growth, and Ethereum\u2019s industry integration boost its long-term potential.\n\nEthereum\u2019s smart contracts and scalability enhancements attract developers and users alike.\n\nEthereum\u2019s solid foundation and blockchain\u2019s rising appeal hint at a resilient and thriving future despite future challenges.\n\nSource: Pixabay\n\nConclusion: The Future of Ethereum\n\nThis article explores Ethereum\u2019s chance to recover and its future, hinging on PoS transition, price predictions, and market sentiment.\n\nWhile Ethereum faces challenges and uncertainties, it also presents significant opportunities for investors and enthusiasts.\n\nThe shift to a PoS blockchain with Ethereum 2.0 has the potential to address scalability issues, increase security, and reduce energy consumption, making the network more efficient and sustainable.\n\nPrice forecasts and technical analysis suggest that Ethereum could experience significant growth in the coming years, driven by increased adoption, staking rewards, and market sentiment.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s important to cautiously approach investing in Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe crypto market is highly volatile, and prices can fluctuate rapidly. Regulatory actions and technological risks should also be considered. Conduct thorough research, seek advice from financial professionals, and only invest what you can afford to lose.\n\nIn conclusion, while the future of Ethereum is not without challenges, its strong fundamentals, growing ecosystem, and innovation potential make it an exciting cryptocurrency to watch.\n\nAs the crypto market evolves, Ethereum\u2019s recovery and growth potential will be shaped by technological advancements, market dynamics, and investor sentiment."

        "content": "Concerns about increased centralization on the Ethereum network have intensified, following Blocknative\u2019s decision to discontinue its MEV-boost relay on Tuesday.\n\nRelayers play a pivotal role in settling transactions on Ethereum. They ensure timely and efficient processing, bridging the gap between users and the blockchain by batching and broadcasting transactions. With the exit of Blocknative, the relayer landscape is becoming increasingly concentrated. At time of writing, only four relayers remain active on the network.\n\nFollowing Ethereum\u2019s transition to proof-of-stake, the roles of block proposing and block building became distinct processes. MEV-boost software was developed to facilitate an efficient market between these proposers, which submit transaction bundles to validators, and builders, which organize the transactions in a specific order.\n\nFollowing the Merge, a group of well-resourced Ethereum block builders, formerly including Blocknative, began running their own relays.\n\nToday, nearly all Ethereum transactions use MEV-boost relays. 93% of Ethereum blocks created in the past 14 days made use of MEV-boost, according to data compiled on mevboost.pics. At the time that data was compiled, five entities were responsible for relaying 98% of the MEV-boosted transactions, per relayscan.io.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nAccording to Blocknative, it dropped its MEV-boost relay because continuing was no longer economically viable. The four remaining relayers collect no fees for their services, making this core piece of Ethereum infrastructure unprofitable for its operators. A recent Flashbots community proposal aims to start a \u201cPBS Guild\u201d which would solicit Ethereum community donations in part to reward relayers.\n\nUri Klarman, CEO of relaying entity Bloxroute, believes that a relayer fee mechanism should be activated, however. He suggests that block validators anticipate this move.\n\n\u201cI heard from multiple validators, like, \u2018yeah, we don\u2019t understand how you [haven\u2019t charged] us until this point,\u2019\u201d Klarman told Blockworks.\n\nKlarman said relayer fees would require some level of consensus between the remaining relaying entities and, ideally, the Ethereum community. If the economic incentive problem isn\u2019t fixed, though, Klarman thinks the perceived centralization of MEV-boost relays could grow worse.\n\n\u201cIn a year, if everything stays the same [\u2026] I think it\u2019s very reasonable that there will be [fewer] relays than there are today,\u201d Klarman said.\n\nElias Simos, the CEO of Ethereum data platform Rated, told Blockworks he is ambivalent toward a future where Ethereum continues to rely on its four major relayers.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re demonstrably long-term actors in the space, so they have a lot to lose [if Ethereum is harmed],\u201d Simos said. \u201cBut at the same time, is that enough?\u201d\n\nUpdated Sept. 28, 2023 at 10:22 am ET: Updated to clarify that Ethereum transactions are now handled by four relayers.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "Next month, Buenos Aires will begin rolling out a blockchain-based and open-source digital identity protocol, QuarkID, in an effort to streamline citizen access to public services.\n\nBuenos Aires citizens will be able to download the protocol\u2019s native wallet to claim essential personal documents such as birth and marriage certificates, according to a statement on Wednesday.\n\nThe move is being touted as a \u201cfirst\u201d in Latin America, in collaboration with on-chain digital identity solutions firm Extrimian and Matter Labs, the company behind Ethereum layer-2 blockchain zkSync Era.\n\nQuarkID\u2019s service intends to operate on the principle of self-sovereignty, allowing individuals complete control over their personal data. While documentation will initially be limited, the Buenos Aires government is planning a phased introduction of various official credentials.\n\nStarting in November, citizens will be able to access proof of income and academic attendance certificates \u2014 key documents for benefits claims \u2014 within their digital wallets.\n\nFor the initial rollout, Buenos Aires citizens will need to complete the existing biometric know-your-customer procedures for identity verification to create a QuarkID wallet.\n\nThe full roadmap for QuarkID, set to be released by year-end, aims to extend the service to over 2.5 million users by expanding the list of available credentials, per the statement.\n\nDiego Fernandez, Secretary of Innovation of the Buenos Aires City Government, described the initiative as a digital trust framework serving as a \u201cpublic good.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith this development, Buenos Aires becomes the first city in Latin America and one of the first in the world to integrate and promote this new technology,\u201d he said.\n\nBuilt atop Matter Labs\u2019 tech stack, the QuarkID wallet takes advantage of zkSync Era\u2019s blockchain framework for consolidated document storage. ZkSync Era serves as the settlement layer for the QuarkID platform, ensuring the proper ownership of each stored document.\n\nAdoption incoming?\n\nBuilding on prior efforts since 2022, the Secretariat of Innovation and Digital Transformation in Buenos Aires has been working with Extrimian and other tech companies, including IOV Labs, OScity and Xcapit, as well as the local community.\n\nTogether, they are aiming to advance the development decentralized digital identity, seeking to evolve the current paradigm of e-government services across Latin America.\n\nThe region itself is fast becoming a hotbed for blockchain use case adoption, demonstrating a willingness to employ censorship-resistant technologies for official government business and record keeping.\n\nCitizens across the region are also increasingly warming to the idea of transacting using crypto, ever since El Salvador became the first nation in the world to adopt bitcoin (BTC) as an official form of currency, alongside the US dollar, in 2021.\n\nA Ripple survey last year found that 74% of Latin Americans are more likely to transact with businesses that accept crypto, compared with just 41% of Europeans. A separate survey by Mastercard in June of that year found more than half of Latin Americans reported having already paid for goods and services using digital assets.\n\nChainalysis\u2019 latest figures from its Global Crypto Adoption Index show Brazil, Mexico and Argentina rank within the top 20 countries globally, besting the likes of Japan and Bangladesh.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

Coinbase is joining as one of the core dev teams working on the OP Stack to ensure it\u2019s a public good available to everyone.\n\nWhen Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 4844, which focused on proto-danksharding, was introduced in 2022, Coinbase recognized it as a building block needed to achieve cost savings of up to 100x for Ethereum users. This improvement to the Ethereum blockchain would make the crypto economy on Ethereum more affordable for mainstream users. Coinbase and the OP Stack team have worked closely with the core Ethereum development community over the last year to accelerate EIP-4844.\n\nWhy is Base important for the crypto space?\n\nThere are several reasons why Base is a compelling choice for developers and users:\n\nSecurity\n\nBase is secured by Ethereum, which means that it leverages the underlying security of one of the world\u2019s securest blockchain platforms.\n\nScalability\n\nBase is able to process transactions much faster and cheaper than Ethereum\u2019s layer 1, making it ideal for a wide range of applications, including decentralized finance (DeFi), gaming and nonfungible tokens (NFTs).\n\nDeveloper-friendly\n\nBase is designed to be easy for developers to build on. It is fully Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible, meaning that developers can deploy their existing Ethereum smart contracts to Base seamlessly.\n\nAccess\n\nBase is integrated with Coinbase, making it easy for users to get started with on-chain applications. Users can on-ramp to Base directly from Coinbase, and they can also use their Coinbase Wallet to interact with Base decentralized applications (DApps).\n\nBase architecture\n\nBase is a layer 2 rollup on the Ethereum L1 infrastructure, which means that it bundles transactions together and submits them to the Ethereum chain for settlement. This allows Base to process transactions much faster and more cheaply than Ethereum L1.\n\nBase uses a sequencer to bundle transactions and submit them to the L1. The sequencer is a trusted party that is responsible for ensuring that transactions are executed correctly. Coinbase is currently operating the Base sequencer, but it plans to decentralize this role over time. The lack of centralization of sequencers has been debated heavily by the industry. Therefore, several L2 platforms are looking at decentralizing their sequencers over time.\n\nBase is also working on a fraud proof system to ensure that transactions are valid. If a user disputes a transaction, the sequencer must provide fraud proof to the L1 network. If the fraud proof is valid, the transaction is reversed. Base is an optimistic rollup that accepts a transaction if more than two thirds of the validators sign off on it.\n\nThe vision for L2-focused ecosystem growth is to create a superchain that has many hubs of ecosystems that operate independently at first. As interoperability across these hubs based on L2s improves, they would effectively form a mesh, or \u201csuperchain,\u201d that would help scale Ethereum. The Ethereum blockchain could become a superchain where certain operations happen on specialist L2 platforms and are settled back on the main chain.\n\nBase advantages\n\nBase offers a number of advantages that make it a compelling choice for developers and users:\n\nFull EVM equivalence: Base is fully EVM-compatible, meaning that DApps can be deployed from their existing Ethereum smart contracts to Base without any friction.\n\nLow gas fees: Base\u2019s gas fees are significantly lower than Ethereum\u2019s gas fees. This makes Base ideal for a wide range of applications, including DeFi, gaming and NFTs.\n\nFast transaction times: Base\u2019s transaction times are much faster than Ethereum transaction times. This makes Base ideal for applications where users need to interact with the blockchain quickly.\n\nEase of use: Base is integrated with Coinbase, making it easy for users to get started with on-chain applications. Users can on-ramp to Base directly from Coinbase, and they can also use their Coinbase Wallet to interact with Base DApps.\n\nHow to get started with Base\n\nTo get started with Base, users will need a Coinbase Wallet. Further steps are listed below:\n\nUsers can create a Coinbase Wallet for free on the Coinbase website or via the mobile app.\n\nOnce a user has a Coinbase Wallet, they can on-ramp to Base directly from Coinbase.\n\nOnce the user moves funds into their Base wallet, they can start interacting with Base DApps.\n\nBase DApps details are available on the Base website.\n\nThe Base website lists a number of popular Base DApps, such as Aave, Uniswap and OpenSea.\n\nBase ecosystem\n\nThe Base ecosystem is still under development, but it is growing rapidly. A number of projects are already being built on Base, including:\n\nThanks to a healthy ecosystem of applications, the total value locked (TVL) on Base has skyrocketed in the last two months. While the TVL in August was at $175 million, September has seen Base become the ninth largest blockchain with a TVL of $370 million.\n\nBase roadmap\n\nCoinbase is committed to making Base the best possible L2 platform for developers and users. The Base roadmap includes a number of important milestones. The L2 ecosystem on Ethereum suffers from centralized sequencers, and that needs to be fixed if Base wants to achieve its goal of global adoption. Coinbase plans to decentralize the sequencer role over time, making it securer and more resistant to censorship.\n\nCoinbase also plans to support more Ethereum features on Base, such as account abstraction and sharding. This will make Base even more scalable on Ethereum and will allow developers to build more innovative and user-friendly applications.\n\nFinally, Coinbase is working to attract more projects to build on Base. The developer community is critical to achieving the network effects needed to grow any blockchain ecosystem. The ultimate goal is to make Base the most vibrant and diverse L2 ecosystem.\n\nWritten by Arunkumar Krishnakumar"

        "title": "Why Cryptocurrencies Like Bitcoin and Ethereum Surged Today - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "What happened\n\nThursday was a fine day for cryptocurrencies nearly across the board, with the sector's leaders driving the rally. No. 1 and No. 2 -- respectively, Bitcoin (BTC -2.07%) and Ethereum (ETH -0.29%) -- were trading around 3% higher over the 24 hours preceding late afternoon.\n\nAs the top dogs go, the remaining pack typically follows, so a host of other coins, tokens, and related assets also moved higher, albeit at different paces. Fellow crypto Aave (AAVE 3.89%) was enjoying a nearly 9% surge, while miner Riot Platforms (RIOT -9.78%) was defying gravity at a nearly 5% clip.\n\nSo what\n\nThe trajectory of cryptocurrencies (and stocks closely tied to them, like Riot Platforms) frequently depends on the performance of low-risk assets. When the latter start to weaken, this emboldens certain investors to stack up on the riskier goodies, and coins and tokens are still considered to be model high-risk plays.\n\nOn Thursday, those safe havens weren't looking infallible. The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury bond, considered by many to be the most secure investment on the scene, weakened from a 16-year high on Thursday.\n\nMeanwhile, everybody's favorite fossil fuel investment, crude oil, also saw a price retreat (in its case, from year-to-date highs). Finally, the reserve currency of this planet (the U.S. dollar) lost a bit of its value too.\n\nThese weren't the only factors driving Bitcoin, Ethereum, and their many relatives higher on the day.\n\nIn a post on X (formerly Twitter) late Wednesday, Bloomberg reporter Eric Balchunas wrote that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is making moves to accelerate the rollout of certain Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Specifically, according to Balchunas, the SEC has requested ETF filers to update their applications in an effort to get those instruments up and running for trading next week.\n\nWhile this apparently only concerns Ethereum ETFs, it's easy to imagine that if the regulator is ready to turn on the light for that crypto, it's ready to do so for a host of other coins and tokens. There still is much crypto resistance in official corners -- particularly at the SEC, ahem -- but at least to some degree, it seems to be melting a bit.\n\nNow what\n\nOther factors playing in the background are also contributing to the current crypto bullishness. The equity market continues to be generally frothy, which not only fuels optimism for riskier assets but also gets investors to consider non-stock plays like cryptocurrencies. Interest rates remain relatively high and look set to stay that way for some time or even rise. So, we likely haven't seen the last good day for coins and tokens."

        "content": "Could bullish Ethereum news related to the launch of an ETH futures ETF be the catalyst that triggers a massive breakout of a nearly 16-month long ascending triangle pattern?\n\nIf the pattern is valid, the target is roughly $4,000 per ETH and a revisit to former all-time highs from the last bull market.\n\nVanEck Announces ETH Futures ETF\n\nGlobal asset manager VanEck, known best for its ETFs and Mutual Funds, today revealed the upcoming launch of the VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF (ETUF).\n\nETUF will be \u201can actively managed ETF designed to seek capital appreciation by investing in Ether (ETH) futures contracts.\u201d\n\nRather than investing in spot ETH, the Fund will trade Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) ETH futures, and will be managed by the firm\u2019s Head of Active Trading, Greg Krenzer.\n\nETUF will trade on CBOE alongside VanEck\u2019s Bitcoin Strategy ETF (XBTF). And although its inception of November 15, 2021 marked the end of the bull market in crypto, the introduction of Ethereum futures has the potential to kickstart the next bull run.\n\nEther's target is $4,000 based on the measure rule | ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nEthereum News Catalyst Could Trigger Ascending Triangle Breakout\n\nShow me the chart and I\u2019ll tell you the news, is a famous quote from the late Bernard Baruch. The message reflects the fact that the largest technical moves tend to coincide with a news catalyst and vice-versa.\n\nEssentially, the a bullish chart pattern could possibly appear before positive news \u2013 such as the launch of an ETH futures ETF \u2013 while the news itself is the catalyst for a strong breakout.\n\nThis is precisely what appears to be brewing in ETHUSD charts since June of 2022. Unlike Bitcoin which put in a bottom late in 2022, Ethereum found support about halfway through the year. Since then, Ether has consistently made higher lows, forming a potential ascending triangle chart pattern.\n\nNow, the ascending triangle pattern is nearing the two-thirds point from its apex. This increases the chances of a breakout occurring as an Ethereum futures ETF gets launched have increased significantly. All that\u2019s required is a breakout above $2,000 per ETH on higher than normal volume. Based on the measure rules, reaching the target objective could push prices to over $4,000.\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nDecentralization is the holy grail of blockchain buzzwords.\n\nAlthough it is endlessly touted by crypto advocates far and wide, another hack on the weekend unveiled a not-so-decentralized reality, reviving the industry\u2019s oldest debate.\n\nWhat does decentralization really mean?\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe are using the word for adoption rather than actual decentralization,\u201d says Sergey Nazarov, the co-founder of the decentralized oracle network Chainlink.\n\nFor Nazarov, who alluded to the collapse of Celsius, Voyager, FTX, and most recently Mixin Network as examples of a \u201cdecentralization theater,\u201d the buzzword is mostly being used \u201cto attract capital.\u201d\n\nChainlink\u2019s co-founder told Decrypt he sees only a handful of projects as meaningfully decentralized, naming only Chainlink, Bitcoin, and Ethereum.\n\nThe latter, it\u2019s important to point out, is going through its own set of centralization problems, with the so-called Lido Finance cartel posing an existential threat to the network.\n\nFor Nazarov, though, decentralization is a \u201csecurity mechanism.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHe pointed to Chainlink\u2019s four-year record without hacks, \u201cwhile transferring $8.5 trillion in value,\u201d as a case in point. \u201cSystems that are decentralized remain secure,\u201d he said.\n\nChainlink has not been exempt from its own criticism regarding centralization, however. The price oracle has a 4-of-9 multi-signature access that could have unforeseen\u2013and undesired\u2013effects in the DeFi space.\n\nDeFi security expert Chris Blec spoke to Decrypt about his mounting concerns regarding the multi-sig.\n\nFor him, the issue isn\u2019t necessarily the number of signers, but rather that the administrative access exists, and that the industry doesn\u2019t know who operates them.\n\n\u201cThe fact that these signers can \u2018nuke\u2019 the price of Ethereum is a problem,\u201d he said. And Blec pointed to the large number of DeFi protocols currently using Chainlink\u2019s price feeds which could also see issues were the multi-sig to be compromised.\n\nMat\u00edas Barrios, a security researcher for Solana, thinks the issue isn\u2019t necessarily the multi-sig, but rather key management. \u201cYou can have a 19/20 but if the keys aren\u2019t well managed, it won\u2019t be more secure than a 2/9,\u201d he said.\n\nEven so, Blec places the emphasis on what he calls a lack of transparency. \u201cPeople need to be aware of the risks,\u201d he explained, especially those who put their life savings into the DeFi protocols feeding off Chainlink\u2019s feeds.\n\nAll that said, the DeFi security expert did claim that \u201cNobody has figured out how to feed prices without a centralized mechanism,\u201d not naming any competitors that might be working towards that goal.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHe also referred to the recently launched Chainlink Cross-chain Protocol (CCIP), as getting closer to achieving decentralization, although there is much work to be done.\n\nDecentralization: Apples and oranges\n\nDecentralization, however, expands beyond security. For others, it can even take on a more democratic hue.\n\nMat\u00edas Barrios, a security researcher for Solana, told Decrypt, that the concept is \u201cthe ability a system has to distribute voting power.\u201d For him, voting power can also mean \u201cexecution,\u201d in that no one person has the capability of censoring or allowing changes to occur.\n\nThat said, Barrios pointed to a reality that is sometimes easily overlooked: \u201cDecentralization is a spectrum.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am a massive believer in the decentralized spectrum idea,\u201d agrees Nazarov. However, he pointed to many chains as \u201cmasquerading\u201d their decentralized reality.\n\nOne such protocol, countering Nazarov\u2019s decentralization tag, is Ethereum. It has come under fire of late, due to the outsized footprint of Lido Finance and its staking pools.\n\nDanny Ryan, an Ethereum Foundation member, addressed these concerns and didn\u2019t hold back.\n\nRyan explained that Lido is short-circuiting the economics of the network by \u201cShoving a governance token owned by a bunch of VCs into the center of the protocol.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHe expanded on the presence of VCs in crypto, and how these pose systemic threats to overall decentralization. \u201cThe majority of token distributions these days are VC owned,\u201d he claimed, characterizing them as \u201cShitty re-instantiations of corporations on chain.\u201d\n\nBlec echoed these sentiments, and tacks on the outsized footprint that stablecoins have on the protocol. \u201cAny fork will be at the mercy of these products,\u201d he thinks, adding that if they don\u2019t approve, the network could implode.\n\nIf Ethereum goes through these types of threats, what\u2019s left for the rest of the industry?\n\nFor Nazarov, there are two ways to address the issues surrounding decentralization.\n\nFirst, \u201cwe need to end the buzzword cycle,\u201d and focus on building systems that offer proper security and reliability.\n\nThat\u2019s mainly for builders and companies in the space, however.\n\nChainlink\u2019s co-founder reckons there is a responsibility on the individual as well. \u201cWe need to become more educated consumers,\u201d he said.\n\nAs the crypto industry continues to battle the ongoing bear market, the decentralization debate is more alive than ever.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhether it is a means to better security systems or more democratic governance, is up for each individual, or entity, to discern.\n\nWhat is for sure, however, is that crypto seems to be falling short of its number one goal."

However, the process encountered hiccups just a few hours after it launched.\n\nDiederick Loerakker, an Ethereum researcher, narrated that the wrong data was imputed from parts of the Genesis files.\n\nSomeone put 0x686f77206d7563682069732074686520666973683f (\u201chow much is the fish?\u201d) as extra data in the EL Holesky genesis.json, and not in the CL genesis.ssz Misconfiguration, the network failed to launch.\n\nAlso, some other fork params in releases are rumored to mismatch too. Need to relaunch. Not an issue with network-size at least.\u201d\n\nBeaconchain.eth and other observers noted that despite the delay, no damage will be done as that is the whole point of a testnet.\n\nShould everything go as planned with Holesky, Ethereum is billed to widen the gap between competitors in the creation of decentralized applications (dApps) as the new testnet will attract huge projects with effective scalability."

        "title": "VanEck Prepares to Launch Ethereum Futures ETF (EFUT) - Business Wire",
        "content": "NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--VanEck today announced the upcoming launch of the VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF (EFUT), an actively managed ETF designed to seek capital appreciation by investing in Ether (ETH) futures contracts. EFUT does not invest in ETH or other digital assets directly.\n\nThe Fund will invest in standardized, cash-settled ETH futures contracts traded on commodity exchanges registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Currently, the only ETH futures the Fund intends to invest in are those traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.\n\nEFUT will be listed on CBOE and will be actively managed by Greg Krenzer, Head of Active Trading for VanEck. Mr. Krenzer joined the firm in 1994 and has more than two decades of experience trading in a host of asset categories, including the futures space.\n\nEFUT joins the VanEck Bitcoin Strategy ETF (XBTF) in providing futures-focused exposure to key digital assets. Like XBTF, EFUT is structured as a C-Corp., an approach that may provide a more efficient tax experience for long-term investors. XBTF does not invest in BTC or other digital assets directly.\n\nVanEck will be posting updates on EFUT on X (formerly Twitter): @vaneck_us.\n\nAbout VanEck\n\nVanEck has a history of looking beyond the financial markets to identify trends that are likely to create impactful investment opportunities. We were one of the first U.S. asset managers to offer investors access to international markets. This set the tone for the firm\u2019s drive to identify asset classes and trends \u2013 including gold investing in 1968, emerging markets in 1993, and exchange traded funds in 2006 \u2013 that subsequently shaped the investment management industry.\n\nToday, VanEck offers active and passive strategies with compelling exposures supported by well-designed investment processes. As of August 31, 2023, VanEck managed approximately $80.8B in assets, including mutual funds, ETFs and institutional accounts. The firm\u2019s capabilities range from core investment opportunities to more specialized exposures to enhance portfolio diversification. Our actively managed strategies are fueled by in-depth, bottom-up research and security selection from portfolio managers with direct experience in the sectors and regions in which they invest. Investability, liquidity, diversity, and transparency are key to the experienced decision-making around market and index selection underlying VanEck\u2019s passive strategies.\n\nSince our founding in 1955, putting our clients\u2019 interests first, in all market environments, has been at the heart of the firm\u2019s mission.\n\nImportant Disclosures\n\nThe information contained in the registration statement for VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF is not complete and may be changed. Van Eck may not sell these securities until the registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d) becomes effective. The prospectus and statement of additional information contained in the registration statement is not an offer to sell the securities referenced therein and is not soliciting an offer to buy these securities in any state where the offer or sale is not permitted.\n\nThe value of Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC) and the Funds\u2019 Futures holdings, could decline rapidly, including to zero. You should be prepared to lose your entire investment. The Funds do not invest in BTC, ETH or other digital assets directly.\n\nThe further development and acceptance of digital asset networks, which is part of a new and rapidly changing industry, is subject to a variety of factors that are difficult to evaluate, the slowing, stopping or reversing of the development or acceptance of the digital asset networks may adversely affect the price of digital assets and therefore cause the Funds to suffer losses, regulatory changes or actions may alter the nature of an investment in digital assets or restrict the use of digital assets or the operations of the digital asset networks or venues on which digital assets trade in a manner that adversely affects the price of digital assets and, therefore, the Funds\u2019s digital asset Futures. Digital assets generally operate without central authority (such as a bank) and are not backed by any government, digital assets are not legal tender and federal, state and/or foreign governments may restrict the use and exchange of digital assets, and regulation in the United States is still developing.\n\nFutures Contract Risk. The use of futures contracts involves risks that are in addition to, and potentially greater than, the risks of investing directly in securities and other more traditional assets. The market for digital asset Futures may be less developed, and potentially less liquid and more volatile, than more established futures markets. Digital asset Futures are subject to collateral requirements and daily limits that may limit the Fund\u2019s ability to achieve its target exposure. Margin requirements for digital asset Futures traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (\u201cCME\u201d) may be substantially higher than margin requirements for many other types of futures contracts. Futures contracts exhibit \u201cfutures basis,\u201d\u201d which refers to the difference between the current market value of the underlying digital asset (the \u201cspot\u201d price) and the price of the cash-settled futures contracts.\n\nThis risk may be adversely affected by \u201cnegative roll yields\u201d in \u201ccontango\u201d markets. The Funds will \u201croll\u201d out of one futures contract as the expiration date approaches and into another futures contract on a digital asset with a later expiration date. The \u201crolling\u201d feature creates the potential for a significant negative effect on the Fund\u2019s performance that is independent of the performance of the spot prices of the digital asset. A market where futures prices are generally greater than spot prices is referred to as a \u201ccontango\u201d market. Therefore, if the futures market for a given commodity is in contango, then the value of a futures contract on that commodity would tend to decline over time (assuming the spot price remains unchanged), because the higher futures price would fall as it converges to the lower spot price by expiration. Extended period of contango may cause significant and sustained losses.\n\nAn investment in the VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF (EFUT) may be subject to risks which include, but are not limited to, risks related to market and volatility, investment (in ETH futures), ETH and ETH futures, futures contract, derivatives, counterparty, investment capacity, target exposure and rebalancing, borrowing and leverage, credit, interest rate, liquidity, investing in other investment companies, management, new fund, non-diversified, operational, portfolio turnover, regulatory, repurchase agreements, tax, cash transactions, authorized participant concentration, no guarantee of active trading market, trading issues, fund shares trading, premium/discount risk and liquidity of fund shares, U.S. government securities, debt securities, municipal securities, money market funds, securitized/mortgage-backed securities, sovereign bond, ETH-related company, ETH-related concentration, and equity securities risks, all of which could significantly and adversely affect the value of an investment in the Fund.\n\nAn investment in the VanEck Bitcoin Strategy ETF (XBTF) may be subject to risks which include, among others market and volatility, investment, futures contract, derivatives, investments related to bitcoin and bitcoin futures, derivatives, counterparty, investment capacity, target exposure and rebalancing, borrowing and leverage, indirect investment, credit, interest rate, illiquidity, investing in other investment companies, management, new fund, non-diversified, operational, portfolio turnover, regulatory, repurchase agreements, tax, of cash transactions, authorized participant concentration, no guarantee of active trading market, trading issues, fund shares trading, premium/discount and liquidity of fund shares, U.S. government securities, debt securities, municipal securities, money market funds, securitized/asset-backed securities, and sovereign bond risks, all of which could significantly and adversely affect the value of an investment in the Fund.\n\nInvesting involves substantial risk and high volatility, including possible loss of principal. An investor should consider the investment objective, risks, charges and expenses of a Fund carefully before investing. To obtain a prospectus and summary prospectus, which contain this and other information, call 800.826.2333 or visit vaneck.com.

        "title": "Bitcoin Price Up 30% Versus Ethereum, New 2023 Lows Incoming? - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Bitcoin price is up 30% versus Ethereum (ETH) in 2023, and bulls appear not to be slowing down, looking at the performance in the weekly chart. BTC is on the brink of pushing ETH lower at spot rates, registering new 2023 lows and extending gains from early this year.\n\nThe Downtrend Remains: Will Bitcoin Extend Rally?\n\nBitcoin bulls are in the driving seat. Candlestick arrangement in the weekly chart shows that BTC pushed on, extending its rally against the second most valuable coin despite attempts for higher highs in mid-August.\n\nIn the second week of August, ETH added roughly 7% versus BTC. Notably, this expansion was after a period of horizontal consolidation as momentum shifted in favor of ETH. However, bears reversed gains and continued the primary trend established since the beginning of the year.\n\nThe medium trajectory seems to be guided by events in mid-March 2023. Then, ETH prices devalued drastically versus Bitcoin, forming a bearish engulfing bar marked by a spike in trading volume. The surging demand for BTC saw prices reverse progress in late October 2022.\n\nBitcoin bulls have since extended gains versus Ethereum. However, one notable formation is that BTC is rallying at the back of light trading volume. Since the rally of BTC in Q1 2023 versus ETH, trading volume has been contracting despite prices printing lower lows.\n\nRegulatory Pressure, Hacks In Focus, Will Halving Spark Demand?\n\nIt cannot be immediately ascertained whether the current draw-down will continue. The level of participation has significantly decreased in the last six months as sentiment dipped.\n\nOver the past two quarters, the involvement of regulators, including the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), seems to have negatively impacted activity.\n\nIn early June, the SEC sued Coinbase and Binance, two of the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency exchanges. The regulator cited various claims, accusing Coinbase of listing unregistered securities and Binance of, among other charges, manipulation and violating different securities laws. Binance and Coinbase plan to defend themselves against the SEC.\n\nBesides regulations, the broader community remains cautious, considering the number of hacks targeting multiple exchanges and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. Some of these exploits have been linked to the Lazarus Group, a notorious cell allegedly sponsored by North Korea.\n\nDespite the general market lull, traders look forward to the upcoming Bitcoin halving event in 2024. The event will create a supply shock, making BTC scarcer. Whether this will see BTC press ETH even lower back to June 2022 lows is yet to be seen.\n\nFeature image from Canva, chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

The Ethereum price chart displayed an impressive green daily candle, indicating a notable increase of over 2.3%. At present, ETH is trading at $1,635.8 per token, reaching its highest value in the last eight days.\n\nThroughout this week, Ethereum has enjoyed remarkable gains, with its price surging by 4.6% since the beginning of the week. The current rise has made this week the most profitable for the altcoin since July.\n\nETH to USD by CoinMarketCap\n\nMondays are for Ethereum ETFs\n\nHowever, the excitement surrounding Ethereum extends beyond its price movement. There is a growing anticipation within the crypto community about the potential launch of Ethereum Futures ETFs as early as next week. Eric Balchunas, a senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg, hinted at such a development.\n\nAccording to the analyst, the SEC is reportedly eager to expedite the launch of Ethereum Futures ETFs. He suggested that the security regulator has asked ETF filers to update their documentation by Friday evening so that they can become effective on Monday and commence trading on Tuesday.\n\nUPDATE: Hearing the SEC wants to accelerate the launch of Ether futures ETFs (bc they want it off their plate bf shutdown) so they've asked the filers to update their docs by Fri pm (no small task to jam into 48hrs, esp for indie issuers), so they can go eff Mon and trade Tue. https://t.co/gKyQFK12aM \u2014 Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) September 28, 2023\n\nWhile the crypto community eagerly awaits the launch of futures ETFs, the situation is more complex for spot instruments. The SEC recently deferred its decision on Ethereum Spot ETFs from ARK Invest and VanEck, setting new deadlines for both entities \u2014 Dec. 26 for ARK Invest and Dec. 25 for VanEck."

        "title": "Banking clients had $96 billion in crypto positions in 2022 - Ledger Insights",
        "content": "At the end of 2022, clients of banks had cryptocurrency positions of roughly \u20ac91 billion ($96bn), according to the Basel Committee. Yesterday it released data for bank capital ratios for the second half of 2022. However, bank direct exposures to crypto-assets and digital asset custody dropped significantly and were already tiny. A combination of the Basel crypto rules and regulatory frictions are having an impact.\n\nThe $96 billion was the figure for \u2018other exposures\u2019 under the Basel rules, which mainly includes positions on behalf of clients. Seven banks in the Americas made up the whole amount. No other banks globally reported on this category. Prior periods show zero \u2018other exposures\u2019, implying banks have radically increased their client activity.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to compare across periods because the banks included in the figures may not be the same. And gathering data on the topic is still in its infancy. That said, we only compared June 2022 with December 2022 and the number of reporting banks in each region was the same.\n\nUnsurprisingly, banks don\u2019t touch \u2018alt coins\u2019. Bitcoin linked exposures represent $57.5bn and Ethereum linked products $36.5 billion. The remaining balance was in products linked to Ethereum Classic.\n\nDirect bank exposure declines sharply\n\nIn contrast, the direct exposure of banks to crypto-assets was just \u20ac343 million globally across 13 banks, a decline of 69%. And more than a third of that was not cryptocurrency. Two banks in the Rest of the World (likely Asia) held \u20ac125 million in tokenized securities. Tokenized assets made up 98% of the Rest of World exposure, the only region that didn\u2019t fall sharply.\n\nThe number of European banks with direct crypto exposure dropped from four to two and from more than \u20ac300 million to negligible figures.\n\nThere were seven reporting banks in the Americas across both periods and the exposure dropped by 70% in the last six months to \u20ac200 million.\n\nBank digital asset custody also drops\n\nDigital asset custody dropped by 40% in Asia, with two banks reporting for both periods. Europe fell a little, but the Americas reported zero crypto-assets under custody.\n\nIn late March 2022, the U.S. SEC introduced an accounting rule that required all crypto-assets under custody to appear as an asset and liability on the balance sheet. Assets under custody belong to clients, so usually they are not included in the balance sheet.\n\nU.S. banks interpreted this as requiring capital to be set aside under Basel rules \u2013 even though the international Basel crypto rules do not require this.\n\nIn a recent Senate hearing, SEC Chair Gary Gensler said that impacting Basel treatment was not the SEC\u2019s intent. Decisions on that are up to the banking regulators."

        "content": "After sinking roughly 30% from 2023 highs, Ethereum appears to be bouncing off from the pits of the crypto winter. Looking at candlestick arrangements in the daily and weekly charts, the coin has primary support at around $1,500 and is firm, bouncing off with decent trading volume.\n\nAt spot rates, ETH is up approximately 3% following positive developments sparked by the increasing adoption of its layer-2 scaling solution and the recent news that VanEck, a player managing billions of assets, is preparing to launch an Ethereum derivatives product.\n\nEthereum Layer-2 Solutions Exploding\n\nTaking to X on September 28, Alex Masmej, the founder of Showtime, believes that Ethereum\u2019s layer-2 ecosystem has expanded to such an extent that it no \u201clonger makes sense to build on other platforms.\u201d\n\nThe development and deployment of Ethereum layer-2 solutions took center stage following network congestion, which forced gas fees to spike to record highs in the last bull run.\n\nDevelopers have responded to the network co-founder Vitalik Buterin\u2019s urging. The expert believes they are quickly constructing and deploying safe, universal platforms that have gained widespread popularity.\n\nLayer-2 platforms bundle transactions off-chain before confirming them on-chain, allowing for faster and more cost-effective operations while benefiting from the security of Ethereum. As of September 28, there were over 827,000 validators whose job is to confirm transactions and ensure that the network is secure, thanks in part to their geographic distribution.\n\nMost layer-2 solutions use optimistic rollups, including Arbitrum, Base, and OP Mainnet. However, Masmej also said that once ZK rollups, which utilize zero-knowledge proofs to validate transactions without revealing sensitive data, are available, it will end the scalability trilemma, further boosting the capabilities of layer-2 solutions.\n\nIn the founder\u2019s assessment, high throughput options, including Solana, will be a hedge. At the same time, Cosmos, which drives blockchain interoperability, will act as a long-term source of inspiration. Meanwhile, Ethereum will continue to flourish as Layer-2 options gain traction.\n\nRising TVL And ETH Complex Products Launching\n\nAccording to l2Beat data, popular solutions like Arbitrum and Base, which offer faster and cheaper processing environments while remaining coupled with Ethereum and enjoying the pioneer network\u2019s fast-move advantage, have larger total value locked (TVL). As of September 28, layer-2 platforms have a TVL of over $10.6 billion, more than Solana\u2019s market cap, which stood at $8 billion, according to CoinMarketCap.\n\nBeyond layer-2 adoption, ETH is being catalyzed by the news that VanEck, a global asset manager, is preparing to introduce its Ethereum futures exchange-traded fund (ETF). Specifically, the VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF (EFUT) will invest in ETH futures contracts provided by exchanges approved by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).\n\nLike the Bitcoin Futures ETF product, which is already being offered, the Ethereum derivative product will allow institutions to gain exposure, boosting liquidity.\n\nFeature image from Canva, chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Share:\n\nBitcoin price could make a 5% climb to $27,771 if it overcomes resistance confluence between 50- and 200-EMA at 26,948.\n\nEthereum price could breach the $1,648 barricade if rising momentum activates the pending bullish call.\n\nRipple price\u2019s recovery rally threatened by massive seller accumulation within the $0.5145 and $0.5536 order block.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price is trying to lead the rest of the market i nto recovery. However, it faces a key obstacle, same case for Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) positioning the top three cryptocurrencies in a muddle.\n\nAlso Read: This short-term Bitcoin holder indicator forecasts another rally for BTC\n\nBitcoin price tests key confluence hurdle\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price is working out a recovery, but the upside potential remains limited by a descending trend line from a big picture point of view. More closely, the king of crypto is trapped under the foothold of the three Exponential Moving Averages (EMA), making it a Catch-22 moment or complication for investors.\n\nIn today\u2019s trading session, Bitcoin price climbed almost 3%, escaping above the trendline before a strong rejection from the resistance confluence presented by the 50- and 200-day EMA at $26,948.\n\nThe overall outlook of the Relative Strength Index (RSI) shows that while momentum appears to be rising, it remains rather weak. The red histogram bars of the Awesome Oscillator paint the same picture, moving narrowly above the midline. This increases the odds for Bitcoin price falling.\n\nHowever, bulls still have a chance to push north, considering the RSI is tipping up and the AO is positive. The onus, therefore, is on bulls to increase their buying pressure, with a break and close above the 100-day EMA at $27,330 confirming the breakout.\n\nIn a highly bullish case, Bitcoin price could extend above the $27,771 resistance level, last tested in late August.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-day chart\n\nConversely, traders are likely to start cashing in after Bitcoin price\u2019s failed attempt at a breakout. The ensuing selling pressure could send BTC below the $26,000 psychological level to test the demand zone at around $25,856. A break and close below its mean threshold at $25,527 will confirm the downtrend, likely leading BTC to the September 11 lows at $24,899. This would constitute a 5% slump from current levels.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin Ordinals creator proposes \u201cRunes\u201d, a replacement for BRC-20 standard\n\nEthereum price has a pending bullish call that needs activation\n\nEthereum (ETH) price is in an upwards spiral, with the current move, if sustained, likely to send ETH past the $1,648 resistance level. This roadblock has been in play since the onset of the month. If bulls activate the pending bullish call indicated by the RSI attempting to cross above the signal line (yellow band), the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) token could finally break through. A solid move above the 50-day EMA at $1,666 would confirm the breakout.\n\nThe green shade of the AO supports this outlook as it points to bullish dominance over the bears.\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the other hand, a rejection from the $1,648 resistance level could send Ethereum price south, potentially tagging the support floor at $1,551. In the dire case, the losses could extrapolate for a quick liquidity sweep, with the daily chart showing a bit of sell-side liquidity residing underneath.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum Restaking - The next big thing after liquid staking?\n\nRipple price faces massive seller accumulation\n\nRipple (XRP) price recovery could be overpowered by seller momentum from the supply zone between $0.5536 and $0.5145. This order block is populated by strong sellers, with the 100-, 200, and 50-day EMAs at $0.5376, $0.5193, and $0.5278 all converging within it. As such, it is likely that XRP could fall, potentially going as low as the $0.4622 support level. In the dire case, the fall could extend to the support floor at $0.4191, with the move denoting a 15% fall from current levels.\n\nThe RSI is inclined south, suggesting falling momentum, invigorated by the red histogram bars of the AO. This tips the odds further in favor of the bears.\n\nXRP/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the flipside, sidelined investors could inspire a move north, sending Ripple price into the supply zone. A break and close above the midline of this order block, coinciding with the 50-day EMA at $0.5278 would confirm the climb. In a highly bullish case, XRP could shatter the upper boundary of the order block at $0.5536, clearing the path for a continuation to the $0.6098 level. Such a move would denote 20% ascension.\n\nAlso Read: Ripple and Coinbase lead the big fight as US crypto firms advocate for regulatory overhaul"

        "title": "Ethereum Price Prediction: Bulls Hold Firmly Despite ETF News - CoinGape",
        "content": "Ethereum has steadied the uptrend following the dip to $1,564 earlier this week. The formation of a short-term falling wedge, as discussed in the previous ETH price prediction boosted the bulls\u2019 presence and confidence in the market.\n\nThe largest smart contracts crypto, although barely unchanged on Thursday toward the end of the Asia session is trading at $1,603. There was a sharp but brief breakout to $1,633 during the American session but news about the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) delaying the decision on two spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) triggered a minor pullback.\n\nadvertisement\n\nSEC Postpones Decisions on ETFs From Ark, VanEck\n\nThe SEC announced on Wednesday that it is delaying the decision on ARK 21Shares Ethereum ETF until December 26. According to the agency, the delay is necessary as it allows taking \u201caction on proposed rule change\u201d and considering the rule change and concerns that emerge from it.\n\n\u201cThe Commission finds it appropriate to designate a longer period within which to take action on the proposed rule change so that it has sufficient time to consider the proposed rule change and the issues raised therein,\u201d the SEC filing stated.\n\nIt is barely a month since Cathie Wood\u2019s Ark Invest and 21Shares filed with the SEC. The move by the two companies was welcomed with open arms amid issues of extremely low volatility across the crypto market.\n\nAmidst fears of a government shutdown in the US, the SEC also delayed the decisions on another proposal, VanEck Ethereum ETF, which will be considered again on December 25.\n\nOn Tuesday, the agency announced the delayed decision to approve or reject the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF, which will be considered again in 2024 with the deadline set for January 10.\n\nEthereum Price Bullish Comeback\n\nThe delays on Ethereum spot ETFs triggered a minor retracement but support provided by the 23.6% Fibonacci level gave bulls another chance to reaffirm the uptrend. Ethereum currently holds above the 50 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) (red) at $1,600 and this is a positive short-term signal.\n\nFor Ethereum price to carry on with the uptrend, bulls must reclaim the 100 EMA (blue) support/resistance at $1,610 and do the same with the 200 EMA (purple) at $1,640.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) reinforces the strength of the uptrend as it seeks support above the midline following a rebound from near-oversold conditions earlier this week.\n\nTraders can also sit tight with confidence that ETH\u2019s recovery will continue to $1,700 and later to $1,800 based on the positive outlook of the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator.\n\nA buy signal sent on September 25 encouraged traders to seek exposure to Ethereum longs. With the blue MACD line above the red signal line, the path with the least resistance will remain to the upside.\n\nRelated Articles"

        "content": "Ethereum price is eyeing a recovery wave from $1,565 against the US Dollar. ETH could rise steadily if it settles above $1,600 and $1,620.\n\nEthereum is attempting a recovery wave above the $1,580 level.\n\nThe price is trading above $1,590 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere was a break above a major bearish trend line with resistance near $1,590 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair could start a recovery wave if there is a close above $1,600 and $1,620.\n\nEthereum Price Signals Recovery\n\nEthereum\u2019s price remained well-bid above the $1,565 level. ETH seems to be forming a base above $1,565 and is slowly moving higher, like Bitcoin.\n\nThe price was able to recover above the $1,580 and $1,590 levels. There was a move above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1,669 swing high to the $1,565 low. Besides, there was a break above a major bearish trend line with resistance near $1,590 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.\n\nEthereum is now trading above $1,590 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $1,600 level.\n\nThe next major resistance is $1,620. It is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1,669 swing high to the $1,565 low. A push above $1,620 might send Ether further higher and there are chances of a steady increase.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nThe next major resistance is near $1,650 and $1,660. If the bulls succeed in clearing the $1,660 hurdle, the price could start a decent increase toward the $1,720 resistance. Any more gains might open the doors for a move toward $1,800.\n\nAnother Drop in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $1,620 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,580 level.\n\nThe next key support is $1,565, below which the price could test the $1,540 support. If the bulls fail to protect the $1,540 support, there could be a sharp decline. In the stated case, there could be a drop toward the $1,440 level.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bearish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now above the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $1,565\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $1,620\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "My view is if a U.S. spot bitcoin ETF gets approved, there should be little argument for holding up a spot ether ETF. And Grayscale itself has said it plans to convert ETHE and other products to ETFs. I wouldn\u2019t hold your breath when it comes to SOL, ATOM or any other smaller crypto asset, but we have first-hand knowledge that ETH ETFs work. In fact, ethereum ETFs launched within weeks of the first bitcoin ETF. Regulators in Canada were comfortable with the product because there is a regulated futures market for ETH, allowing market makers to hedge risk while creating and redeeming units. I suspect that following a BTC approval, an ETH approval would not be far behind. ETHE\u2019s discount is greater than GBTC\u2019s, meaning a far greater arbitrage opportunity. Also, ETH markets are less liquid than BTC, so the incremental buying from an ETF could have a more material impact on price. And, in my view, ETH has better upside as the leading platform for Web3 development."

        "content": "Ethereum has been trading below $1600. On the daily timeframe chart, the asset\u2019s price recently created lower lows. At the same time, its RSI formed higher lows, resulting in a bullish divergence. Conventionally, this situation depicts that bears are losing power and bulls are gearing up to control the market again. More often than not, bullish divergences are followed by relief rallies.\n\nIn the weekly timeframe, ETH continues to remain engulfed within its macro-rising wedge. Technically, this structure is bearish in nature. However, given the current sentiment flip in the short term, there are more odds of a bounce back from the lower trendline instead of registering a breakdown from that level. Consequentially, this has the potential to trigger a 12% uptick for ETH.\n\nAlso Read: JPMorgan: Stablecoin Issuers Might Shatter Funding Market\n\nEthereum\u2019s Path Up is Filled with Obstacles: Investors, Beware!\n\nThat being said, ETH might not register a spike straight off the bat. The ascent will be gradual because profit booking has already started. The exchange net flows have been in green over the last couple of days. Specifically, on Sept. 26, 2023, the reading of this metric flashed a value of +54,246.33. This means there are more people selling ETH by sending them to exchanges currently.\n\nAlso Read: China: Billionaire Chairman of Evergrande Arrested\n\nAlongside, data from IntoTheBlock revealed that wallets with zero balance have risen by roughly 13% over the past week. This means a significant number of users have transferred out all of their tokens, ringing another bell of caution. Thus, if the pressure on these two ends continues to escalate, ETH could end up dropping to $1422 over the medium term. At press time, the $191 billion-worth asset was seen exchanging hands at $1591.6.\n\nSource: Mint\n\nAlso Read: SBF Documentary \u2018Downfall of the Crypto King\u2019 Goes Live on BBC"

Source: DefiLlama\n\nNotably, while the Ethereum Foundation is mostly holding Ethereum (ETH), Mantle has a more diversified Treasury, from which DefiLlama classifies as:\n\nMajors (BTC, ETH): $440.83 million\n\nOwn Tokens (BIT): $1.19 billion\n\nOthers (MNT, USDC, USDT, etc.): $1.15 billion\n\nTotal excluded own tokens: $1.83 billion\n\nTotal treasury: $3.02 billion\n\nMantle Treasury (BIT) chart. Source: DefiLlama\n\nWhat is the Mantle Protocol?\n\nDespite being associated with the BitDAO (BIT) token by DefiLlama, the Mantle Network has Mantle (MNT) as its native token used for governance, on-chain fees, and staking rewards. Nevertheless, the association occurs due to the network being incubated by the BitDAO community.\n\nInterestingly, the Mantle Network is described as a rollup layer-2 blockchain for the Ethereum ecosystem, similar to Polygon (MATIC), Optimism (OP), and Arbitrum (ARB), totally compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) \u2014 which makes it possible to bridge ERC-20 tokens to Mantle.\n\nAs with other competitors, this protocol intends to offer more scalability to Ethereum\u2019s led Web3, more efficiency to smart contracts deployment, and affordability to decentralized app developers.\n\nThe $3 billion treasury operations are deemed transparent by the team, with on-chain monitoring and reports.\n\nFunding for Mantle and BitDAO treasuries\n\n2023 has been one of the worst periods for fundraising \u2014 either looking at public sales (IDO/ICO/IEO), or private rounds data.\n\nTotal Raise and Number of Public Sales, plus Fundraising Activity charts.

Raising $230 million in a single private funding round, over $379 million with its IDO, and $14 million in an IEO on Bybit. All that happening respectively in July, August, and September of 2021.

With its dynamic ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps), including DeFi protocols, play-to-earn (P2E) games, NFT marketplaces, and beyond, Ethereum has redefined the possibilities of blockchain technology. However, to truly immerse yourself in this bustling blockchain universe and ensure the safe storage, transfer, and management of Ether (ETH) and other Ethereum-based assets, a reliable Ethereum wallet is an absolute necessity.\n\nJoin us as we embark on a journey to discover the best Ethereum wallet in 2024, each designed to not only safeguard your crypto holdings but also seamlessly connect you to the ever-expanding world of Ethereum dApps through smart contract integration.\n\nCryptoWallet.com \u2013 Best wallet to spend ETH\n\nCryptoWallet.com is the best Ethereum wallet for daily use. You can send and receive ETH with ease, along with 800+ other cryptocurrencies. You can also spend ETH directly from your wallet using our Crypto Card. Ledger Nano X \u2013 Best hardware wallet\n\n\u2013 Best hardware wallet MetaMask \u2013 Best for For Interacting with dApps\n\n\u2013 Best for For Interacting with dApps Trust Wallet \u2013 Best mobile wallet\n\n\u2013 Best mobile wallet Exodus \u2013 Best desktop wallet\n\nWhat is an Ethereum Wallet?\n\nAn Ethereum wallet or ETH wallet is a digital tool or application that allows users to securely store, manage, send, and receive Ethereum (ETH) and other Ethereum-based cryptocurrencies, tokens, and assets. Ethereum wallets are essential for anyone looking to participate in the Ethereum blockchain ecosystem, which is known for its smart contract functionality and decentralized applications (dApps).\n\nWith an ETH wallet, you can send ETH or receive it from other users using the Ethereum wallet address. You can easily check your Ethereum balance within the wallet, so you always know how much ETH you have.\n\nHere are the key functions and features found on some of the best Ethereum wallets:\n\nStorage: ETH wallets store the private keys and public addresses associated with your Ethereum holdings. Private keys are crucial because they are used to sign transactions and access your funds. It\u2019s essential to keep your private keys secure, as they provide control over your assets.\n\nSending and Receiving: With an Ethereum wallet, you input the recipient\u2019s Ethereum address and the amount you want to send, and the wallet handles the transaction for you. Similarly, you can receive it from other users using your Ethereum wallet address.\n\nToken Support: Many Ethereum wallets also support Ethereum-based tokens, such as ERC-20 tokens. This feature allows you to store and manage a wide range of digital assets beyond just Ether.\n\nInteraction with dApps: Some Ethereum wallets are equipped to interact directly with decentralized applications (dApps) on the Ethereum blockchain. This functionality enables you to participate in DeFi platforms, NFT marketplaces, games, and other Ethereum-based applications.\n\nHow to Choose The Best Ethereum Wallet?\n\nEthereum cold wallets and hot wallets are two distinct categories of cryptocurrency wallets, each designed with different levels of security and accessibility in mind. Let\u2019s explore the differences between them:\n\nEthereum Hot Wallet\n\nHot wallets are online or software-based wallets that are constantly connected to the internet. They are designed for convenience and easy access, making them suitable for day-to-day transactions and activities.\n\nHot ETH wallets are ideal for users who need quick access to their Ethereum holdings for trading, sending, or receiving transactions. They are commonly used for activities like making online purchases, participating in decentralized exchanges (DEXs), and interacting with decentralized applications (dApps) in real time.\n\nWhile hot wallets come with security features like PIN codes and encryption, they are more susceptible to hacking attempts and online threats compared to cold wallets. Since they are connected to the internet, there is a risk that they can be compromised if the user\u2019s device or online accounts are compromised.\n\nExamples: CryptoWallt.com, MetaMask, MyEtherWallet (when used as an online wallet), and most mobile and desktop wallets fall into the category of hot wallets.\n\nEthereum Cold Wallet\n\nEthereum Cold wallets (which are mostly Hardware wallets), as the name suggests, are offline wallets designed primarily for long-term storage of Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies. They are not connected to the internet, which significantly reduces the risk of online attacks or hacking attempts. This makes cold wallets one of the most secure options for storing crypto assets.\n\nCold ETH wallets are not suitable for frequent transactions or immediate access to funds. They are best used for securely storing large amounts of Ethereum as a long-term investment or as a safeguard against online threats.\n\nExamples: These are physical devices, often resembling USB drives, that store the user\u2019s private keys offline. Popular examples include Ledger Nano X and Trezor Model T.\n\nBest Ethereum Wallet of 2024\n\nCryptoWallet.com\n\nCryptoWallet.com was designed specifically to solve the pain points seen with other wallets. It\u2019s a full suite of financial services including a buy/sell, virtual IBAN, onramps and offramps for businesses, and even a crypto card that supports direct spending and over 800 cryptos!\n\nCryptoWallet.com offers the best wallet for spending ETH directly. We call our custodial Ethereum wallet \u201cEthereum Account\u201d where you can hold your ETH and spend it anywhere with our Crypto Card.\n\nCryptoWallet.com includes a built-in cryptocurrency exchange feature, allowing users to trade one cryptocurrency for another directly within the wallet interface. This can simplify the process of managing your crypto portfolio.\n\nYou can buy Ethereum with credit card or debit card and use it for banking and payments \u2013 such as making bank transfers using your ETH funds, spending it online with a crypto card, or converting it to fiat instantly at any ATM.\n\nType of wallet: Mobile\n\nMobile Purchase cost: Free\n\nFree Own exchange incorporated: Yes\n\nYes Ease of Use: Very easy\n\nPros \ud83d\udc4d\n\nUsers can spend their crypto on real goods and products through the CryptoWallet.com card, finally allowing people to use crypto as real money. It\u2019s rare to find a crypto wallet with card features, bridging the gap between crypto and the rest of the world!\n\nYou can pay your bills or go shopping with your Ethereum funds, and then add more ether later from the built-in exchange. You can earn money with CryptoWallet.com by referring users, as you\u2019ll be paid a portion of their debit card transaction fees. It\u2019s easy to use, and brings all the most common user needs and wants together in a simple user interface.\n\nCons \ud83d\udc4e\n\nAs with non-custodial wallets (for example Coinbase DeFi wallet), users don\u2019t control their own keys with CryptoWallet.com. Again, this is a personal preference. Users with hardware wallets or other non-custodial solutions have sole access to their keys.\n\nHowever, for our CryptoWallet.com card, you can link non-custodial wallets and spend funds directly from them if you wish, instead of the CryptoWallet.com wallets.\n\nOf course, self-custody means no exchange, no debit card, no customer support, no community, and no rewards program. We offer an enterprise-grade level of security, as well as all the perks mentioned above. We\u2019re happy to put our name forward as the best Ethereum wallet out there for users looking for an all-in-one ETH wallet solution.\n\nTrezor Model T\n\nThe Trezor Model T is a popular hardware wallet that provides a secure and user-friendly way to store, manage, and interact with various cryptocurrencies, including ETH wallet (Ether and Ethereum-based tokens).\n\nThe Trezor Model T is designed to keep your private keys offline, which greatly enhances the security of your Ethereum holdings.

You can use it with popular wallets like MyEtherWallet (MEW), Exodus, and MyCrypto.\n\nTrezor is designed to be kept offline and away from internet-connected servers. This offline storage significantly reduces the risk of remote hacking, making it a safe option for long-term investors and those holding a substantial amount of Ethereum.\n\nType of wallet: Hardware\n\nHardware Purchase cost: \u00a3190 or \u20ac219\n\n\u00a3190 or \u20ac219 Own exchange incorporated: No\n\nNo Ease of Use: Beginners\n\nPros \ud83d\udc4d\n\nTrezor is the best hardware Ethereum wallet that offers robust security features, making it an excellent choice for long-term Ethereum investors and individuals concerned about the safety of their assets. Trezor offers support for a growing number of currencies and is compatible with certain online wallets.\n\nCons \ud83d\udc4e\n\nDespite its security features, Trezor does have some drawbacks. Sending tokens from a Trezor wallet can be cumbersome because it requires direct access to the physical device. Additionally, Trezor is not free; it comes at a cost.\n\nMetaMask\n\nMetaMask is a popular Ethereum wallet and browser extension that allows users to manage, store, and interact with Ethereum and decentralized applications (DApps) directly from their web browsers.\n\nMetaMask is one of the best ETH wallets that supports a variety of Ethereum-based tokens, such as Ethereum (ETH) itself and various ERC-20 and ERC-721 tokens.

MetaMask also offers a mobile app for managing cryptocurrencies on the go.\n\nType of wallet: Web\n\nWeb Purchase cost: Free\n\nFree Own exchange incorporated: No\n\nNo Ease of use: Intermediate\n\nPros \ud83d\udc4d\n\nUsers can connect their MetaMask wallet to decentralized applications (DApps), enabling them to participate in various blockchain-based activities such as decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and more.\n\nMetaMask ETH wallet has gained popularity as a user-friendly gateway to the world of blockchain and decentralized applications. It simplifies the process of interacting with Ethereum and other compatible blockchains, making it the best Ethereum wallet that accessible to both beginners and experienced users in the crypto space.\n\nCons \ud83d\udc4e\n\nMetaMask was originally designed for Ethereum, although it currently offers only limited support for other well-known blockchains and cryptocurrencies.\n\nLedger Nano X\n\nThe Ledger Nano X is another amazing hardware wallet that is compatible with your mobile (via Bluetooth). It provides a highly secure and user-friendly way to store, manage, and interact with Ethereum (ETH) and a wide range of other cryptocurrencies. It can store multiple cryptocurrency accounts simultaneously. Private keys are stored offline within the device\u2019s secure element chip, making it resistant to hacking attempts.\n\nOne of the distinguishing features of the Ledger Nano X is its Bluetooth connectivity.

Users can set up the Ledger software on their desktop computer and plug in the Ledger Nano X as a USB flash drive into a computer to transfer cryptocurrencies.\n\nCons \ud83d\udc4e\n\nSetting up the software on a computer can be a cumbersome process. If a user notices a sudden trading opportunity and their funds are all offline, it\u2019s possible that the opportunity will pass them by before they can connect the wallet and bring their funds online.\n\nIf a user loses their seed phrase, the funds are vulnerable to the destruction or loss of the physical wallet.\n\nCoinbase Wallet (DeFi)\n\nCoinbase Wallet is a non-custodial solution, which operates independently of the Coinbase exchange wallet. This DeFi wallet does not require users to create an account on the Coinbase exchange platform.\n\nCoinbase DeFi is one of the best Ethereum wallet \u2013 ideal for beginners due to its user-friendly interface and strong security features.

The nature of blockchain technology means that transactions cannot usually be reversed or cancelled after sending. Typical banking services such as \u201cchargeback\u201d do not apply to crypto. It can also be very difficult to trace stolen or missing crypto funds.\n\nFor those reasons, protecting the funds at the source is important, and that means choosing a good wallet.\n\nTypes of Ethereum Wallets\n\nEthereum wallets come in various types, each with its own characteristics, features, and use cases. Here are the main types of Ethereum wallets:\n\nSoftware ETH Wallets\n\nDesktop Wallets: These are applications installed on your computer. They offer good security and control but are only as secure as your computer. Examples include MyEtherWallet (MEW), Exodus, and Electrum.\n\nMobile Wallets: These are wallet apps designed for smartphones and tablets. They are convenient for on-the-go transactions. Examples include Trust Wallet and Coinbase Wallet.\n\nWeb Wallets: Web wallets are accessible through a web browser and are hosted on a website. They are convenient but come with varying degrees of security. For example CryptoWallet.com\n\nBrowser Extension Wallets: These wallets are browser extensions that integrate with your web browser. They are designed to interact with decentralized applications (dApps) and often offer secure ways to store and manage Ethereum and tokens. Examples include MetaMask and Forta Wallet.\n\nHardware ETH Wallets\n\nHardware wallets are physical devices designed solely for cryptocurrency storage and transactions. They are considered one of the most secure options because they keep your private keys offline. Examples include Ledger Nano X and Trezor Model T\n\nIt\u2019s important to choose the type of Ethereum wallet that best suits your needs and security preferences. Security should always be a top priority, especially when dealing with cryptocurrency assets. Consider factors like ease of use, mobility, and the level of control and security provided by each wallet type when making your choice. Many users also employ a combination of wallet types for different purposes, such as using a hardware wallet for long-term storage and a mobile wallet for everyday transactions.\n\nTop Hardware Wallets for Cryptocurrency\n\nHardware wallets such as Trezor Model T and Ledger Nano X are suitable for users who want to keep large sums of cryptocurrency \u201coffline\u201d to add an additional layer of security. Of course, it takes longer to move funds from a hardware wallet than a software wallet. Many users choose to keep some in a web, mobile, or desktop wallet for trading or spending, storing the rest in a hardware wallet.\n\nHardware wallets are the safest way to store Ethereum. A hardware or \u201ccold\u201d wallet is a physical offline device that stores your keys. This makes them extremely difficult to hack. To access and use your Ether you\u2019ll need to connect your wallet to an online device like a computer or phone. This ensures the safety of your funds, however, some investors can find this inconvenient for quick trading. This is why many traders use an assured software wallet like CryptoWallet.com for convenience.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to choose the best Ethereum wallet, it\u2019s important to find one that suits your needs. Trezor and Ledger manufacture a variety of tried-and-tested hardware wallets. Both companies offer wallets with a range of different features that might suit you depending on your budget and needs.\n\nTrezor wallets must be connected using a USB cable and the Trezor Wallet desktop app. Android users may be able to connect their wallet using WebUSB but iPhone owners will have to use a computer. This can be inconvenient for traders who wish to capitalize on sudden market changes. Trezor is an ideal choice for security-concerned users.\n\nLedger is Bluetooth-enabled and comes with both a desktop and mobile app (for Android and iPhone) called Ledger Live. This makes it slightly more convenient to use especially if this is your first hardware wallet.\n\nFinal Verdict: Best Ethereum Wallet\n\nChoosing the best Ethereum wallet for your needs involves considering various factors, including security, convenience, and your specific use case. Here are some recommendations based on different scenarios:\n\nBest for Daily Use: CryptoWallet.com is an excellent choice for daily Ethereum use. It supports multiple cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum and Bitcoin. The standout feature is the Crypto Card, which allows you to spend ETH and Ethereum tokens directly from your wallet, making it easy to use for everyday transactions, including cash withdrawals at traditional ATMs. Most Secure Wallet: If security is your top priority, hardware wallets like Ledger Nano X or Trezor are the way to go. They store your private keys offline in a physical device, making them highly resistant to hacking. However, they require a computer or mobile connection to use. Balanced Security and Convenience: Software wallets offer a balance between security and convenience. They are accessible online and suitable for most users. However, they may be less secure than hardware wallets. Reputable exchanges often insure assets held in their hot wallets to enhance security. Consider using well-known software wallets like CryptoWallet.com or Trust Wallet For Interacting with dApps Online: If you want to actively interact with Ethereum-powered decentralized applications (dApps) online, MetaMask and Guarda browser extensions are excellent choices. They provide easy access to the Ethereum ecosystem directly through your web browser. Best Mobile Wallet: Trust Wallet is ideal if you prefer to access dApps, DeFi applications, and NFT marketplaces on the go. It\u2019s a mobile wallet that offers a user-friendly experience for Ethereum-based activities on your smartphone. For Active Portfolio Management: CryptoWallet.com is suitable for those actively managing their crypto portfolios. It comes with a built-in exchange, allowing you to trade various Ethereum-based tokens conveniently as well as spend them anywhere with crypto card. As a non-custodial alternative, Exodus Wallet is worth considering if you are looking to diversify your holdings. Advanced Use and Smart Contracts: If you require advanced functionality, such as deploying Ethereum smart contracts, MyEtherWallet is an excellent choice. It offers a more technical interface, making it suitable for users who want to engage in Ethereum\u2019s development and smart contract capabilities.\n\nCryptoWallet.com \u2013 The Best Ethereum Wallet to Spend ETH\n\nCryptoWallet.com is not just a crypto wallet, it\u2019s a crypto neo bank that allows you to store your Ethereum and ERC20 tokens.

Ethereum is a decentralized, open-source blockchain platform that was created to enable the development of decentralized applications (DApps) and smart contracts. It was proposed by Vitalik Buterin in late 2013 and development began in early 2014, with the network going live on July 30, 2015. Ether (ETH) is the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum platform. It is used to pay for transaction fees, computational services, and as a store of value. It\u2019s also commonly traded as a digital asset. Here are some key aspects of Ethereum: Smart Contracts: Ethereum allows developers to write and deploy smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller directly written into code. Smart contracts can automatically execute actions when predefined conditions are met, without the need for intermediaries. Decentralization: Ethereum is built on a decentralized network of computers (nodes) that collectively maintain the blockchain. This means there\u2019s no central authority or single point of control, making it resistant to censorship and tampering. DApps: Ethereum has become a hub for the development of decentralized applications (DApps) across various industries, including finance, gaming, supply chain, and more. DApps run on the Ethereum blockchain and often have their own tokens. What is Ethereum 2.0? Ethereum 2.0, also known as Eth2 or Serenity, is a significant upgrade to the Ethereum blockchain. It includes a transition from energy-intensive Proof of Work (PoW) to the more efficient Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. Eth2 introduces sharding, which divides the blockchain into smaller parts to increase scalability and parallel processing. The Beacon Chain, launched in Phase 0, coordinates validators and manages PoS. Crosslinks ensure the security of shard chains. Ethereum 2.0 aims to enhance scalability, sustainability, and security while introducing eWASM for smart contract execution. The upgrade is being rolled out in multiple phases. What is a Ethereum Wallet? An Ethereum wallet is used to hold ETH cryptocurrency tokens. Rather than being a bank account, an Ethereum wallet is an application that stores the information you need to access and use your ether funds. You need a crypto wallet to conduct transactions with your ether coins. The wallet lets you interact with your ether funds on the Ethereum blockchain. It lets you read your balance, make transactions and connect to dApps. An Ethereum wallet includes a public key, similar to a bank account number and a private key, similar to a password. When you want to send ether you\u2019ll use your private key , and when you want to receive crypto, you\u2019ll need to provide your public key to others. If you lose your private key, you lose access to your crypto funds which is why it\u2019s important to keep your private key secure or use a custodial wallet like CryptoWallet.com that will keep your private key safe. There are many different types of wallets to store ETH. The main two types are online or \u201chot\u201d wallets where you can access your funds on the web or using a mobile phone or desktop and, secondly, offline or \u201ccold\u201d wallets which are physical devices used to store the information needed to access your holdings. How to Get an Ethereum Wallet? There are many ways to get an Ethereum wallet. It can be as easy as installing an application on your mobile phone or desktop. Many wallets are also available as an extension for your web browser. With just a few clicks your software wallet will be automatically created and you can start receiving and using your ether right away. Mobile wallets let you carry your ETH wherever you go and spend it easily online and in store. With CryptoWallet.com, payments can be made using the mobile application or with a crypto debit card meaning you will always have access to your ethereum. Setting up your Cryptowallet takes a matter of seconds and you can purchase ETH using fiat money meaning you can start using your ether right away! You can also purchase a hardware or \u201ccold\u201d wallet online. A hardware wallet is a small portable device that can be plugged in or connected with bluetooth to access your ETH funds. Once you\u2019ve purchased your wallet it will be shipped to you for setup. With a hardware wallet, your information is kept securely offline which makes it less susceptible to hacks and keeps your private key safe. Some Ethereum wallets can involve a lengthy setup or waiting period before you can use your ether. Hardware wallets often involve an advanced knowledge of the technology behind cryptocurrency. We\u2019ve compiled a range of the best crypto wallets so you can choose the best cryptocurrency wallet for you. Is Hardware ETH Wallet Worth Investing in? Hardware wallets are ideal for users who hold a large amount of cryptocurrency and want an additional layer of security to keep their funds safe. A hardware wallet is a small portable device that can be connected to access your funds. With a hardware Ethereum wallet, your information is kept securely offline which makes your ETH less susceptible to cyber attacks. Choosing the best hardware crypto wallet can be difficult with a wide range available and it is important that you purchase one from a trusted vendor. Otherwise your wallet could come preloaded with viruses and you could lose your ether. We\u2019ve included some of the top ethereum hardware wallets in our list. Once you purchase a hardware wallet it will be shipped to you for setup. Some hardware wallets will connect you to their website to set up your hardware wallet but others can involve an extensive knowledge of blockchain technology. Your private key will be secured by a pin or passphrase. This means that if anyone else gains access to your hardware wallet, your funds will remain safe! While a hardware wallet is one of the most secure options out there, the cost of purchasing a hardware wallet is much greater than any software wallet. It also takes longer to move your funds using a hardware wallet and can be inconvenient to use. Is Ethereum Wallet Free? Not every ethereum wallet is free to access and use! There is a cost involved with the hardware of an offline wallet and some online wallets will involve a flat or fixed fee for usage. An ether hardware wallet can cost up to $200 for the device but can be a more secure way of storing your funds. For users who wish to access their funds quickly for trading or store smaller amounts of cryptocurrency, a software wallet will be more convenient and cheaper. Software wallets are available online for much less. Often exchanges will provide their own wallet for a small flat fee or even free. However, often these wallets are custodial meaning that the exchange manages your funds. This makes it important to know that your funds are strongly protected. With CryptoWallet.com, you can be comfortable in the knowledge that all your eth are insured and protected by BitGo, a leading digital asset protection company. We believe we\u2019ve created one of the best free mobile wallets available today! What is the best Ethereum wallet? Every ETH wallet will have unique features and levels of protection. Some wallets emphasize convenience, while others prioritize security above all. The best crypto wallet will be the one that meets your needs. If you want the most secure Ethereum wallet, a hardware wallet is the way to go. These are physical devices that store your keys offline. As a result, they are less vulnerable to hackers or viruses. To fully utilize your assets, you will need to link them to an internet device, which could be inconvenient. As your keys are stored online and you can access your assets from anywhere, software wallets provide far more convenience. They are often simpler to use and set up than hardware wallets. Their constant online connection, on the other hand, leaves them more vulnerable to cyberattacks.\n\nRead More:\n\nBest USDT Wallet\n\nBest Bitcoin wallet"

        "title": "Metis Proposes Migration to Ethereum Mainnet for Enhanced Data Availability - Blockchain.News",
        "content": "Metis, an Ethereum Layer 2 network, has proposed migrating its data availability back to the Ethereum mainnet. The move aims to simplify the launch of a decentralized sequencer pool and enhance data availability. The proposal is open for community feedback and will be subject to a Snapshot vote.\n\nMetis, a Layer 2 network built on Ethereum, announced a significant proposal on September 27, 2023. The proposal aims to migrate its data availability mechanism back to the Ethereum mainnet by switching from its current off-chain storage layer to its original Optimistic Rollup architecture. This move is seen as a strategic step to facilitate the launch of the Metis sequencer pool, a groundbreaking decentralized sequencer initiative.\n\nIn the spring of 2022, Metis entered into a partnership with Memo Labs to develop an off-chain storage layer. This collaboration enabled Metis to transact on its Layer 2 network at a lower cost by reducing the amount of data pushed to Layer 1 Ethereum. While this approach has been cost-effective, it has raised concerns about data availability.\n\nData availability is a cornerstone in the blockchain ecosystem. It ensures that all transaction data are readily available for reconstruction by validators and users. The Optimistic Rollup architecture, which Metis originally employed, batches this transaction data to Layer 1, thereby enhancing data availability. The current off-chain storage model, while cost-effective, relies on Memo Labs, a third-party entity, which could potentially compromise the robustness of data availability.\n\nMetis aims to become the first Layer 2 network to decentralize its sequencer by launching a first-of-its-kind sequencer pool. This move would eliminate the single-point-of-failure risk associated with relying on a single sequencer entity. It would also open up new staking opportunities for METIS token holders, who would need to stake METIS to become eligible sequencers.\n\nSwitching to the Optimistic Rollup architecture would offer several benefits:\n\n* Simplification of the Metis architecture, thereby facilitating the sequencer pool's launch.\n\n* Enhanced data availability, which is crucial for the sequencer pool.\n\n* Decentralization and security upgrades through the sequencer pool.\n\nHowever, the move comes with a trade-off: Metis would lose its current cost advantage, as transaction fees would align with those of other Layer 2 networks.\n\nThe proposal is currently open for community feedback. Once a consensus is reached, it will proceed to the Snapshot stage for a community vote. If the vote garners a 51% \"YES,\" Metis will implement the proposed changes. The community also has the option to revert to the off-chain storage model after the sequencer pool's successful launch, subject to further evaluation and voting.\n\nDisclaimer & Copyright Notice: The content of this article is for informational purposes only and is not intended as financial advice.

        "content": "Ethereum is generally sliding in a wide descending trendline amid extremely low volatility and dwindling trading volumes. It has become increasingly difficult for bulls to sustain the uptrend since June, with recovery attempts quickly giving back accrued gains. The latest dip below $1,600 saw ETH plunging to $1,564 before a minor rebound to $1,598 on Monday.\n\nCoingape\u2019s live market tracking software shows Ethereum price trading at $1,592, 0.3% higher on Wednesday, with $3.1 billion in 24-hour trading volume and $192 billion in market capitalization.\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum Price Prediction: Are Bulls Capitalizing On Falling Wedge Pattern Breakout?\n\nA short-term falling wedge formed on the daily chart allowed Ethereum to bounce off support at $1,564 before stalling at $1,598. As a reversal pattern, the falling wedge forms toward the end of the downtrend.\n\nIt signals that the downtrend is ending and a trend reversal is nigh. However, the price must swing above the wedge to validate the breakout accompanied by an increase in trading volume.\n\nDespite the slow recovery momentum, Ethereum is mainly in bullish hands. The 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level provides much-needed immediate support. This support coupled with the bullish outlook from the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator confirms ETH is ready for a rebound.\n\nA buy signal manifesting with the blue MACD line holding above the red signal line will continue to call upon traders to hold onto their long positions. Demand for ETH must increase to build the required momentum to start a new recovery phase above $1,600.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) is gradually recovering from August\u2019s oversold conditions and this signals that odds are in favor of Ethereum price climbing into the $1,600 range. Note that bulls will continue to struggle under the overbearing sellers until ETH rockets out of the descending channel to mark the beginning of a new bullish era.\n\nResistance at $1,600 is quite elaborate on the four-hour chart, reinforced by the 50-day EMA (red). The On-Balance Volume indicator confirms the lack of volume which explains why bulls have been struggling to break above this crucial level despite the MACD maintaining the bullish outlook.\n\nEthereum TVL Tanks $10 Billion From 2023 High\n\nThe largest smart contracts token has experienced a massive drop in its decentralized finance (DeFi) Total Value Locked (TVL) from approximately $31 billion to the current $21 billion.\n\nTVL is a metric used to track the total value of digital assets that are staked in a DeFi protocol like Ethereum, Solana, or Cardano.\n\nA persistent drop in the TVL could signal increasing selling pressure and vice versa. This means that investors are getting restless with the crypto winter and are withdrawing their staked digital assets from the Ethereum protocol in favor of other staking protocols or assets.\n\nRelated Articles"

        "content": "ETH\u2019s supply outpaced tokens burned in the last 30 days.\n\nTransaction by new addresses on the blockchain decreased, while active addresses increased.\n\nEthereum\u2019s [ETH] supply has increased over the last 30 days despite the blockchain\u2019s transition to Proof-of-Stake (PoS). This led to speculation that ETH could become deflationary again.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ETHs worth today?\n\nETH will be back\n\nAccording to Benjamin Cowen, ETH may soon return to its deflationary status. He, however, opined that it could take a \u201cmore accommodative monetary policy\u201d to achieve the same.\n\nSince the merge, there has still been more $ETH burned than issued. pic.twitter.com/g2hNbW7I4X \u2014 Benjamin Cowen (@intocryptoverse) September 26, 2023\n\nThis was also one of the objectives behind the 15 September 2022 Merge and the burning mechanism of the EIP-1559.\n\nWhen ETH is considered deflationary, it means that there has been an overall decrease in the ETH token supply. This is usually a result of tokens being burned or completely removed from circulation.\n\nBut when ETH is inflationary, it implies an increase in supply, which seems to be the current state.\n\nPreviously, miners on the Ethereum blockchain ran the execution layer. Also, validators were in charge of the consensus layer. However, the Merge allowed for both layers to unify. This then allowed for the tax on each transaction to be automatically removed from circulation.\n\nNonetheless, Cowen also revealed that the hike in circulation did not help the number of ETH issued to outweigh those burned since the Merge.\n\nOver the last 30 days, the supply of $ETH has gone up. As the tourists leave and demand drops, not as much ETH is burned. I suspect ETH will return to being deflationary again, but it might take more accommodative monetary policy for that to happen. pic.twitter.com/DX8zxIvfFR \u2014 Benjamin Cowen (@intocryptoverse) September 26, 2023\n\nFrom Glassnode\u2019s data, Ethereum\u2019s burn rate, also known as the base fee, has decreased incredibly. At press time, it was 852.95. The metric represents the pace at which ETH is being burned.\n\nBy tracking the base fee, users can gain insight into the deflationary or inflationary pressure on Ethereum, and the effect on the network\u2019s long-term economics. Therefore, the decrease in the base fee confirms the notion that more ETH had been issued than they had been burned lately.\n\nNewbies hide, but others show up\n\nIn another terrain, Santiment showed that ETH\u2019s network growth had tanked. Network growth shows the number of new addresses that transferred a coin or token for the first time. When this metric increases, it means that the project has gained a lot of traction.\n\nOn the other hand, a decrease suggests a decline in adoption. At 36,100, ETH\u2019s decrease in network growth means that new addresses have refrained from making transactions on the Ethereum network.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s ETH\u2019s market cap in BTC\u2019s terms\n\nHowever, active addresses on the Ethereum blockchain increased in the last 24 hours. At the time of writing, the metric had increased to 413,000. The metric indicates the level of crowd interaction with a token.\n\nTherefore, the increase means that the number of unique addresses speculation around ETH and transferring the asset climbed."

        "content": "Share this article URL Copied\n\nThe Ethereum developer community successfully launched a new test network called Holesky today, aiming to enhance testing capabilities for the blockchain\u2019s ecosystem.\n\nHolesky joins the existing Goerli and Sepolia testnets, which function as copies of Ethereum\u2019s main blockchain primarily for testing new applications and smart contracts.\n\nHolesky lauched and the chain is finalizing! Shoutout to all the teams running validators, a beaconchain testnet with 1.46 *million* signing validators is no small feat! Aggregating 3800 BLS signatures per second \ud83e\udd2f https://t.co/ScGlxnVPs3 \u2014 proto.eth (@protolambda) September 28, 2023\n\nHolesky was originally scheduled to launch on September 15, marking the one-year anniversary of Ethereum\u2019s transition to proof-of-stake consensus. However, the testnet failed to go live on that date due to a configuration error.\n\nWith 1.4 million validators, Holesky is positioned to become Ethereum\u2019s largest testnet and address the scalability issues facing the mainnet, which has around 700,000 validators currently.\n\nBy increasing the size of the testnet, developers hope to simulate real-world conditions more accurately. Decentralized apps tested on Holesky should face fewer unexpected hurdles when deployed on the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nEthereum developers eventually expect Holesky to replace Goerli, which is slated for sunset in early 2024. Goerli\u2019s capped supply of testnet ether (gETH) led to shortages this year, causing gETH prices to briefly spike above $1.60. Holesky launched with a more abundant 1.6 billion ETH supply to avoid similar access issues."

        "content": "Steven Nerayoff, an active participant in Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) Initial Coin Offering (ICO), who is believed to know where the \u201cbodies are buried,\u201d has made further revelations in the ongoing ETH Gate saga, which boils on whether or not the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) gave Ethereum a \u2018regulatory free pass.\u2019\n\nLubin\u2019s Piece Of Paper Appears In ETH Gate\n\nAfter being pressured by a member of the XRP community to release the dirt that he claims to have, Nerayoff released a follow-up tweet that contained transcripts from an email that Ethereum\u2019s co-founder Joseph Lubin sent to him personally on July 21, 2014. Lubin (whom Nerayoff now also refers to as #CrookedElbowJoe) also copied Fry, Bertrand, Vitalik Buterin, and Jeffrey Alberts in the mail.\n\nIn the mail, Fry, Bertrand (there is an assumption that \u2018Fry, Bertrand\u2019 is one person rather than separate individuals) stated that the \u201copinion letter\u201d was being put on a letterhead and would be forwarded to Lubin after.\n\nFollowing the revelation of this mail, a video clip surfaced where pro-XRP legal expert John Deaton gave his opinion on the mail. In the clip, Deaton suggested that the \u2018opinion paper\u2019 mentioned in the mail was the same one Lubin had referred to when he said he had a \u201cpiece of paper\u201d in his pocket before the ETH ICO. Deaton also stated that Nerayoff got that piece of paper in Lubin\u2019s pocket and that this series of events was extremely significant.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that Deaton might already have first-hand information as to what might have transpired between the SEC and Ethereum and how deep the irregularities run, as he has already been in communication with Nerayoff (under the Attorney-Client privilege communication). This is something that he revealed during his \u201cannouncement\u201d last week.\n\nIn an earlier tweet, Nerayaoff had also suggested that the ETH Gate was beyond just former SEC Director William Hinman\u2019s speech, where he stated that Ethereum wasn\u2019t a security. He said, \u201cThey\u2019re hiding more than the motives behind the speech by #DirtyHinman.\u201d He also used the hashtags #CryptoJudas (what he refers to Vitalik as) and #CrookedElbowJoe (Joseph Lubin).\n\nWhat Is This Lubin\u2019s Piece Of Paper?\n\nAttorney Bill Morgan seemed to suggest that Nerayoff was indicating that Jeffrey Alberts and Fry Bertrand (who co-authored the piece \u2018Is Bitcoin A Security?\u2019 in 2015) were the same persons who wrote the opinion letter (which Deaton suggested was the same piece of paper Lubin spoke about before the ETH ICO).\n\nIf so, he could be driving at the fact that Alberts and Bertrand (who happen to be lawyers) may have written this opinion letter to convince the SEC that Ethereum wasn\u2019t a security before the ICO.\n\nMeanwhile, Nerayoff reposted a tweet which had a similar theory. In the tweet, the X (formerly Twitter) user highlighted a part in Alberts\u2019 bio where he was said to have \u201chelped structure the initial public sale of ether.\u201d\n\nThe bio alluded to the fact that the SEC had concluded that Bitcoin and Ether weren\u2019t securities, adopting the \u201clegal interpretation Alberts had articulated years ago.\u201d\n\nThe user also noted the relationship between Alberts and Marc Berger (who charged Ripple) as they worked together at the Manhattan US Attorney Office\u2019s securities and commodities fraud task force. Marc Berger is said to be working with Bill Hinman now.\n\nETH bulls defeat bears to cross $1,600 | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nFeatured image from Fasset, chart from Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Bitcoin and other crypto tokens were trading mixed on Thursday as s rising interest rates and macroeconomic factors made market sentiments jittery. US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler continued his combative stance against crypto in congressional testimony on Wednesday.\n\n\n\nBitcoin managed to post some gains as the largest crypto token added about half-a-per cent but managed to hover around $26,500-levels. However, its largest peer, Ethereum, inched up about a per cent to once again top $1,600-mark. Price action in the altcoins remained on the mixed side.\n\n\n\nBitcoin is currently priced above the $26,300 mark. This surge coincides with the US dollar index achieving a new 10-month high at 106.48. Meanwhile, Ethereum has been hovering around the $1,600 threshold. In other news, Ethereum has reached a remarkable milestone by surpassing $10 billion in revenue within seven years, said Edul Patel, Co-Founder & CEO at Mudrex.\n\n\n\nAll top crypto tokens were trading mixed on Thursday. Among the gainers, Toncoin jumped more than 2 per cent each, while Solana added about a per cent each. On the contrary, Litecoin, XRP and Polygon shed about a per cent each, while BNB and Dogecoin were down half-a-per cent each.\n\n\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market cap was trading slightly higher, falling to $1.05 trillion-mark, as it rose about half-a-per cent in the last 24 hours. However, the total trading volumes rallied more than 48 per cent to $28.87 billion.\n\n\n\nBitcoin showed a small pump in the last 24-hours for a brief period before facing resistance at its 50-DEMA. The markets are calling for a $30,000 level for BTC soon. However, a support level at $26,000 has to be maintained to expect an upside movement in the short term, said Shubham Hudda, Senior Manager at CoinSwitch Markets Desk.\n\n\n\n\"Terra's LUNA has been pumping. This price action is being attributed to LUNA\u2019s community passing a proposal that makes them move away with the minting of new USTC stablecoins, which was the supposed-to-be stable coin of the Terra Luna ecosystem,\" he added. \"This is happening in the wake of its founder Do Kwon's lawyers having replied to his extradition request from the US authorities.\"\n\n\n\nImage: Crypto-chart-price\n\n\n\nTech View by WazirX Trade Desk\n\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) is a decentralized cryptocurrency designed as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system, striving to establish itself as a reliable global currency with swift transactions, minimal fees, enhanced privacy features, and an increased block size. This cryptocurrency operates without the need for any trusted third parties due to its permissionless nature.\n\n\n\nImage: Chart-BTCash\n\n\n\nOn the daily time-frame, the BCH/USDT trend has come out of its consolidation phase as the chart breaks out of a long-formed triangle pattern with significant buying volumes. The daily price momentum indicator or the RSI has crossed 65 for the first time in nearly 3 months. The next resistance is expected at 250 USDT and an immediate support is expected at 207 USDT.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Views and recommendations given in this section are the analysts' own and do not represent those of Business Today.

        "title": "How the Three Arrows Collapse Changed Ethereum DeFi Lending - Decrypt",
        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nDecentralized finance (DeFi) lending has changed\u2014especially following the collapse of major companies like Three Arrows Capital (3AC) last year\u2014and managing risk is now key for the industry\u2019s success, according to Maple Finance CEO Sidney Powell.\n\nPowell, who co-founded DeFi lender Maple Finance, told Decrypt at Messari Mainnet 2023 this week that the DeFi lending space has matured over the past year. Not that it\u2019s had much choice. The implosion of crypto hedge fund 3AC in June 2022, and the contagion that has spread throughout the market since, has forced traders and lenders to reevaluate what is realistically possible.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cBorrowers and lenders are now saying, \u2018I\u2019d rather take a pretty sure 8% [return], rather than a speculative 20%\u2019,\u201d said Powell. \u201cSo we\u2019re seeing much more emphasis on what is the risk-adjusted yield rather than what is the absolute yield,\u201d he added.\n\nYield in DeFi and traditional finance refers to cash earned on an investment over time. In the experimental world of DeFi, investors can lock-up funds and earn rewards.\n\nA little over a year ago, crypto lenders were still promising borrowers astronomical returns on deposits, in some cases over 20%. But those days are now over, in large part due to the collapse of the crypto project Terra in May of last year.\n\nTerra in its hey-day was a massive ecosystem with lots of apps largely focused on algorithmic stablecoins. At one point, it was perhaps the most talked-about DeFi blockchain and the second biggest after Ethereum; its native cryptocurrency, LUNA, was in its prime one of the top biggest digital assets by market cap.\n\nTerra\u2019s most popular app, Anchor, facilitated risky lending and borrowing and enabled crypto degens to deposit Terra\u2019s UST stablecoin and at times earn in excess of 20% returns in the form of more UST.\n\nBut when the music finally stopped, Terra imploded, taking hedge funds that were invested in the project down along with it.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSingapore-based cryptocurrency hedge fund 3AC was just one firm hit hard by the chaos. The firm promised big things to clients wanting to invest in new digital asset ventures. And to do so, it used crypto lenders promising big returns.\n\nFollowing Terra\u2019s blow-up and the subsequent plunge in crypto prices, 3AC filed for bankruptcy\u2014leaving many crypto lenders waiting on their cash.\n\nNow, says Powell, crypto lenders are much more sensitive to \u201ccounterparty risk management.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe lessons taken away [from the collapse of 3AC] are counterparty risk management, managing contagion, and kind of siloing the risk to the individual borrowers that a lender is facing,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that \u201cseeing what is happening with funds\u201d is now necessary so lenders can control it and a borrower cannot \u201ctrade itself into insolvency like 3AC did.\u201d\n\nMaple Finance is a credit marketplace which helps provide loans to institutions. It stands out in the DeFi space because it provides undercollateralized loans and puts them \u201con chain.\u201d\n\nFollowing the collapse of major crypto lenders, Maple in June launched a direct lending desk, Maple Direct, offering overcollaterized loans.\n\nPowell also told Decrypt at Mainnet that debt is a better asset to tokenize than equities.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHe said that this is because it is easier to monitor, while equity is difficult to track on-chain, in part due to its \u201cchanging valuation\u201d and difficulty to track cash flows."

        "title": "Why Did NEAR Had More Active Users Than Ethereum in September? - Altcoin Buzz",
        "content": "A surprising development over the past month has seen the NEAR Protocol outperform Ethereum and its layer-2 competitors in terms of daily active addresses, indicating future changes to the crypto ecosystem.\n\nDaily active addresses in crypto are an important metric that shows how many activities are going on within a project. Let\u2019s discover what is happening with NEAR.\n\nNEAR is Getting Mass Adoption?\n\nData from Artemis, an institutional data site for digital assets, revealed that the number of daily active addresses on the NEAR Protocol surpassed the 400,000 level in September. This demonstrates NEAR\u2019s growing user base.\n\nWhat's happening on Near? Daily active addresses for select blockchains yesterday\ud83d\udcca\ud83d\udc65 \u2022 650k \u2013 Near\n\n\u2022 302k \u2013 Ethereum\n\n\u2022 292k \u2013 Polygon\n\n\u2022 178k \u2013 Solana\n\n\u2022 128k \u2013 Arbitrum\n\n\u2022 77k \u2013 Optimism\n\n\u2022 71k \u2013 Base According to both @Artemis__xyz and @tokenterminal, the Near blockchain\u2026 pic.twitter.com/EcUxtnr7E0 \u2014 Thor\u26a1\ufe0fHartvigsen (@ThorHartvigsen) September 24, 2023\n\nMid-September saw a spike in the number of daily active Ethereum addresses. But those figures have since fallen to less than 400,000. This declining trend was also present in Arbitrum, which declined from approximately 200,000 in late June to 150,000 by September 25.\n\nNEAR\u2019s numbers increased dramatically from around 40,000 in late June to over 400,000. Additionally, as a result of this upsurge, the daily transaction volume on the NEAR Protocol has surpassed that of Ethereum.\n\nOne take \u2013 they are being very multi-chain friendly; deploy any EVm front-end on NEAR (BOS), partnerships within zkEVM, Mantle, etc. while also signing *and putting into production* large web 2.5 deals that onboard tons of users (even if they don\u2019t now it). These deals are case\u2026 \u2014 AVB | alejandro.near (@AvbNear) September 25, 2023\n\nBlockchains like NEAR and Ethereum often rely on a community that regularly transacts, moves value, or validates the network. However, the number of daily active addresses can offer important information about a network\u2019s well-being.\n\nAside from showing an increase in user adoption, the number of daily active addresses can indicate a shift in market sentiment, which could have a big impact on prices.\n\nNEAR Price Stays Down\n\nNEAR\u2019s impressive network activity is yet to extend to its native token. The NEAR token currently trades at $1.10 and has had a 1% decline in the past seven days. In addition, NEAR has dropped by over 60% from its 2023 high. In this tweet, there is an answer to this increase:\n\nNEAR Foundation has been on a relatively quiet but aggressive onboarding of Web 2.5 deals (18+ announced). Just Cosmose (KaiKai) broke ath daily txs and pushed us to top daily active wallets, #1 app. Focus should be on the tech and UX that enable mass, frictionless onboarding \u2014 AVB | alejandro.near (@AvbNear) September 25, 2023\n\nNEAR\u2019s increased user activity is a good sign. However, Near only generates about $2k per day from this large number of users.\n\nSo we advise investors to exercise caution, taking into account the differences in network activity, price movement, and reduced DEX volume on the NEAR Protocol.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe information discussed by Altcoin Buzz is not financial advice.

        "title": "A Timeline and History of Blockchain Technology - TechTarget",
        "content": "Blockchain was officially introduced in 2009 with the release of its first application -- the Bitcoin cryptocurrency -- but its roots reach back several decades. Many of the technologies that form the basis for blockchain today were in the works long before the emergence of Bitcoin.\n\nStill, blockchain most identifies with Bitcoin -- for better or worse. In the wild and raucous years that followed Bitcoin's debut, blockchain earned a reputation akin to the Wild West. Its decentralized, peer-to-peer (P2P) architecture allowed just about anyone to participate in the process, making it seem too risky for business use. That started to change in 2016 when a burgeoning open source community began developing complete enterprise platforms.\n\nSince then, the technology has taken on a life of its own, with interest coming from many quarters, despite the sometimes scary cryptocurrency headlines of late. Governments, businesses and other organizations are researching and deploying blockchain technology to meet needs that have nothing to do with digital currency. In the face of proliferating cyberthreats and government data privacy regulations, blockchain offers security, immutability, traceability and transparency across a distributed network, making it well suited for use cases that have become difficult to support and protect with traditional infrastructures.\n\nWhat is blockchain? Blockchain is a type of database that's a public ledger for recording transactions without the need for a third party to validate each activity. It's distributed across a P2P network and consists of data blocks linked together to form a continuous chain of immutable records. Each computer in the network maintains a copy of the ledger to avoid a single point of failure. Blocks are added in sequential order, and they're permanent and tamperproof. This article is part of Blockchain for businesses: The ultimate enterprise guide Which also includes:\n\nTop 10 benefits of blockchain for business\n\nTop 10 benefits of blockchain for business What are the 4 different types of blockchain technology?\n\nWhat are the 4 different types of blockchain technology? 7 must-have blockchain developer skills Download 1 Download this entire guide for FREE now! A blockchain starts with an initial block -- often referred to as the Genesis block -- that records the first transactions. The block is also assigned an alphanumeric string called a hash, which is based on the block's timestamp. Blocks are added to the chain sequentially. Each block uses the hash from the previous block to create its own hash, thus linking the blocks together. Blockchain also uses a computational process called consensus to validate a block's authenticity before it can be added to the chain. As part of this process, most of the nodes on the blockchain network must agree that the new block's hash has been calculated correctly. Consensus ensures that all copies of the distributed ledger are in the same state. Initially, blockchain provided a distributed public ledger to support Bitcoin, so transactions could be recorded without the need for a central authority to establish trust in a trustless environment. Not only were transactions more efficient, but also the costs typically associated with third-party verification were eliminated. Blockchain also provided greater transparency, traceability and security than conventional approaches to handling distributed transactions.\n\nBlockchain's historical building blocks Although blockchain as an entity has a relatively short history, its influence today is widespread and its applications wide-ranging and growing. Through the decades, blockchain's development and evolution include some of the following notable developments: Pioneers like Merkle and his tree, Chaum and digital cash, Haber and timestamping, Dwork and proof of work (PoW), Black and hashcash, Finney and reusable PoW dotted the early years of the pre-blockchain landscape.\n\nThe presumed pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto was created to introduce the concept of cryptocurrency and blockchain. Shortly thereafter, cryptocurrency was launched and Nakamoto conducted the first bitcoin transaction, a bitcoin exchange was established and a programmer paid 10,000 bitcoin for two pizzas.\n\nBitcoin's price soared from pennies to tens of thousands of dollars, all the while draped in controversies, shutdowns, crackdowns, bankruptcies, scams, scandals and arrests.\n\nBlockchain started to somewhat divorce itself from Bitcoin when the decentralized blockchain platform Ethereum eventually became one of the biggest applications of blockchain technology and opened the door to numerous business applications beyond cryptocurrencies.\n\nAnd buoyed by AI, IoT, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), decentralized finance (DeFi) and smart contracts, as well as initiatives by the likes of Walmart and Amazon, blockchain has gained legitimacy as a safe, viable alternative to traditional methods of conducting business and individual transactions. Block-by-block description of blockchain's inner workings.\n\n1979 One of the early pre-blockchain technologies is the Merkle tree, named after computer scientist and mathematician Ralph Merkle. He described an approach to public key distribution and digital signatures called tree authentication in his Ph.D. thesis for Stanford University. Merkle eventually patented this idea as a method for providing digital signatures. The Merkle tree provides a data structure for verifying individual records.\n\n1982 In his Ph.D. dissertation for the University of California, Berkeley, David Chaum described a vault system for establishing, maintaining and trusting computer systems among mutually suspicious groups. The system embodied many of the elements that comprise a blockchain. Chaum is also credited with inventing digital cash, and in 1989, he founded the company DigiCash.\n\n1991 Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta published an article describing how to timestamp digital documents to prevent users from backdating or forward-dating electronic documents. The goal was to maintain the document's complete privacy without requiring record-keeping by a timestamping service. Haber and Stornetta updated the design to incorporate Merkle trees, which enabled multiple document certificates to live on a single block.\n\n1993 The beginnings of the PoW concept were published in a paper by Cynthia Dwork and Moni Naor to provide \"a computational technique for combatting junk mail, in particular, and controlling access to a shared resource, in general.\"\n\n1997 Adam Black introduced hashcash, a PoW algorithm that provided denial-of-service countermeasures.\n\n1999 Markus Jakobsson and Ari Juels published the term proof of work. Also, the P2P network was popularized by the now defunct peer-to-peer file sharing application Napster. Some argued that Napster was not a true P2P network because it used a centralized server. But the service still helped breathe life into the P2P network, making it possible to build a distributed system that could benefit from the compute power and storage capacity of thousands of computers.\n\n2000 Stefan Konst introduced the concept of cryptographically secured chains in his paper \"Secure Log Files Based on Cryptographically Concatenated Entries.\" His model, which showed that entries in the chain can be traced back from the Genesis block to prove authenticity, was the basis for today's blockchain models.\n\n2004 Hal Finney introduced reusable PoW, a mechanism for receiving a non-exchangeable -- or non-fungible -- hashcash token in return for an RSA-signed token. The PoW approach today plays a vital role in Bitcoin mining. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Litecoin use PoW, and Ethereum shifted to the proof-of-stake protocol to secure a network using a fraction of the energy that PoW uses.\n\n2008 Satoshi Nakamoto, thought to be a pseudonym used by an individual -- or group of individuals -- published a white paper introducing the concept of cryptocurrency and blockchain and helped develop the first Bitcoin software. Blockchain infrastructure, according to the white paper, would support secure, P2P transactions without the need for trusted third parties such as banks or governments. Nakamoto's real identity remains a mystery, but there has been no shortage of theories. The Bitcoin/blockchain architecture was introduced and built on technologies and concepts from the previous three decades. Nakamoto's design also presented the concept of a \"chain of blocks,\" making it possible to add blocks without requiring them to be signed by a trusted third party. Nakamoto defined an electronic coin as a \"chain of digital signatures,\" in which each owner transfers the coin to the next owner by \"digitally signing a hash of the previous transaction and the public key of the next owner and adding these to the end of the coin.\"\n\n2009 Cryptocurrency was launched during the Great Recession, when the government pumped large amounts of money into the economy. Bitcoin was worth less than a penny then. Nakamoto mined the first Bitcoin block, validating the blockchain concept. The block contained 50 bitcoin and was known as the Genesis block -- aka block 0. Nakamoto released Bitcoin v0.1 to the web service SourceForge as open source software. Bitcoin is now on GitHub. The first Bitcoin transaction took place when Nakamoto sent Hal Finney 10 bitcoin in block 170. The Bitcoin-dev channel was created on the text-based instant messaging system Internet Relay Chat for Bitcoin developers. The first Bitcoin exchange -- Bitcoin Market -- was established, enabling people to exchange paper money for bitcoin. Nakamoto launched the Bitcoin Talk forum to share Bitcoin-related news and information. In the spirit of cryptocurrency as money with fixed supply, Nakamoto set up a system to ensure the number of bitcoin mined won't ever exceed 21 million. Blockchain's evolution through the years has been intimately tied to cryptocurrencies, namely Bitcoin.\n\n2010 On May 22, Bitcoin made history when a programmer Laszlo Hanyecz paid 10,000 bitcoin for two delivered Papa John's pizzas. The two pizzas back then were valued at about $40, a transaction that would balloon to a value of more than $260 million at today's bitcoin price level. A short time later that year, programmer Jed McCaleb launched Mt. Gox, a Tokyo-based Bitcoin exchange. Mt. Gox was short for Magic: The Gathering Online eXchange -- a carryover from a fantasy card game. At its peak, Mt. Gox handled more than 70% of all Bitcoin transactions. But in August, a hacker exploited a bug in the blockchain code and created more than 184 billion bitcoin in block 74,638, tarnishing Bitcoin's reputation. Nakamoto published a new version of the Bitcoin software, but by the end of the year, he disappeared from the Bitcoin scene completely.\n\n2011 One-fourth of the 21 million bitcoin had been mined. By early February, the value of a bitcoin was equal to the U.S. dollar. Shortly thereafter, McCaleb sold Mt. Gox to Mark Karpel\u00e8s. And soon after that, the bitcoin reached parity with the euro and British pound sterling. WikiLeaks started accepting bitcoin donations. However, Mt. Gox was hacked and bitcoin were stolen, causing an artificial drop in value and resulting in suspension of trading. Litecoin was released in October, representing one of the earlier Bitcoin spinoffs and considered the first alternative cryptocurrency.\n\n2012 The interest in cryptocurrencies solidified. Bitcoin's price hovered around $5 for most of the year with several fluctuations. Early that year, Mihai Alisie and Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin launched Bitcoin Magazine and published their first issue in May. A few months later, the Bitcoin Foundation was established to promote Bitcoin and restore public perceptions of cryptocurrency after several scandals. McCaleb and Chris Larsen founded OpenCoin, which led to the development of the Ripple transaction protocol for currency transactions and real-time payments. Coinbase raised more than $600,000 in its crowd-funded seed round on its way to becoming one of the top Bitcoin exchanges.\n\n2013 Bitcoin's upward trajectory continued. In February, Coinbase reported selling $1 million worth of bitcoin in a single month at more than $22 each. By the end of March, with 11 million bitcoin in circulation, the currency's total value exceeded $1 billion. And in October, the first reported bitcoin ATM launched in a Vancouver, B.C., coffee shop. But it wasn't all good news for digital currency. Both Thailand and China banned cryptocurrencies. The U.S. Federal Court seized Mt. Gox's funds in the U.S. for transmitting money without a license. And the FBI shut down the dark web marketplace Silk Road, confiscating about 144,000 bitcoin worth more than $1 billion and resulting in a life prison sentence for the owner Ross Ulbricht for a litany of crimes, including drug trafficking, computer hacking and money laundering.\n\n2014 Despite setbacks, one of the more important milestones in blockchain's history occurred when Bitcoin Magazine co-founder Buterin published a white paper proposing a decentralized application platform, leading to the creation of Ethereum and the Ethereum Foundation. Ethereum paved the way for blockchain technology to be used for applications other than cryptocurrency. It introduced smart contracts and provided developers with a platform for building decentralized applications. Financial institutions and other industries began to recognize and explore blockchain's potential, shifting their focus from digital currency to the development of blockchain technologies. But Bitcoin stayed in the spotlight -- for better and worse. The Mt. Gox Bitcoin exchange filed for bankruptcy. The Bitcoin Foundation vice chairperson was arrested for money laundering. And the U.K. tax authority classified bitcoin as private money. Yet several companies accepted bitcoin by year's end, including the Chicago Sun-Times, Overstock.com, Microsoft, PayPal and Expedia. Bitcoin's acceptance only added fuel to blockchain's fire.\n\n2015 The Ethereum Frontier network launched, enabling developers to write smart contracts and decentralized apps that could be deployed to a live network. Ethereum was on its way to becoming one of the biggest applications of blockchain technology. It drew in an active developer community that continues to this day. In addition, Nasdaq initiated a blockchain trial. The Linux Foundation launched the Hyperledger project. And nine major investment banks joined forces to form the R3 consortium, exploring how blockchain could benefit their operations. Within six months, the consortium grew to more than 40 financial institutions.\n\n2016 The term blockchain gained acceptance as a single word, rather than being treated as two concepts, as they were in Nakamoto's original paper. The Chamber of Digital Commerce and the Hyperledger project announced a partnership to strengthen industry advocacy and education. A bug in the Ethereum decentralized autonomous organization code was exploited, resulting in a \"hard fork\" in the Ethereum network. The Bitfinex cryptocurrency exchange was hacked and nearly 120,000 bitcoin were stolen -- a bounty worth about $66 million.\n\n2017 Bitcoin hit a record high of nearly $20,000. Japan recognized bitcoin as legal currency. Seven European banks formed the Digital Trade Chain Consortium to develop a trade finance platform based on blockchain. The Block.one software company introduced the EOS blockchain operating system, based on the EOS cryptocurrency and designed to support commercial decentralized applications. About 15% of global banks used blockchain technology in some capacity.\n\n2018 Entering its 10th year, bitcoin's value continued to drop, ending the year at about $3,800. The online payment firm Stripe stopped accepting bitcoin payments. Google, Twitter and Facebook banned cryptocurrency advertising. South Korea banned anonymous cryptocurrency trading but announced it would invest millions in blockchain initiatives. The European Commission launched the Blockchain Observatory and Forum to accelerate the development of blockchain. Baidu introduced its blockchain-as-a-service platform.\n\n2019 Walmart launched a supply chain system based on the Hyperledger platform. Amazon announced the general availability of its Amazon Managed Blockchain service on AWS to help users build resilient Web 3.0 applications on public and private blockchains. Ethereum network transactions exceeded one million per day. Blockchain research and development took center stage as organizations embraced blockchain technology and decentralized applications for a variety of use cases.\n\n2020 A Deloitte survey revealed that nearly 40% of respondents incorporated blockchain into production, and 55% viewed blockchain as a top strategic priority. Ethereum launched the Beacon Chain in preparation for Ethereum 2.0. Stablecoins, whose value is tied to another asset class, rose significantly because they promised more stability than traditional cybercurrencies. Interest increased in combining blockchain with AI to optimize business processes.\n\n2021 Bitcoin reached an all-time high of $68,789.63 on Nov. 10, 2021. During its bull run, the bitcoin market cap surpassed $3 trillion. Coinbase went public and was acknowledged as the seventh biggest new listing of all time on the U.S. stock exchange. The DeFi market offering services through smart contracts on blockchain grew a whopping 600% from the previous year, reaching a value of $200 billion. And NFT artwork made headlines, selling for more than $69 million in Ethereum at the auction house Christie's. Well-known entrepreneurs and athletes attempted to capture the meteoric rise in bitcoin's value, including Elon Musk initially accepting cryptocurrency as payment on new Tesla vehicles and Aaron Rogers taking a portion of his multimillion-dollar NFL salary in bitcoin. Interest in using blockchain for applications other than cryptocurrency continued as governments and enterprises considered blockchain for a variety of use cases, including voting, real estate, fitness tracking, intellectual rights, IoT and vaccine distribution in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, multiple cloud providers now offered blockchain as a service, and the demand for qualified blockchain developers was greater than ever. The global blockchain technology market was valued at nearly $6 billion in 2021 and seen surpassing a trillion dollars by 2030, according to market researcher Statista. Blockchain's business applications spread far and wide beyond cryptos.\n\n2022 NFTs continued their ascent, eco-friendly blockchain networks emerged and blockchain applications increased among companies. Bitcoin mining crept closer to Nakamoto's 21 million coin limit, reaching 19 million and leaving less than 10% of bitcoin to be mined. All-time high prices for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies plummeted in the spring due to investor concerns about inflation and the new COVID-19 Omicron variant. Some cryptocurrency exchanges went bankrupt. The collapse of the FTX exchange and arrest of its CEO Sam Bankman-Fried amplified fears about cryptocurrency's riskiness. The open source blockchain platform Terra also collapsed. Speculation of new U.S. government regulation of cryptocurrency added to the uncertainty but at the same time was thought to help legitimize the industry. Globally, Danish shipping company Maersk announced the shutdown of the blockchain-based TradeLens digital ledger it co-developed with IBM because of a lack of player participation. And the Australian Stock Exchange scrapped a seven-year plan to move its trading platform to blockchain. More than 100 countries were involved in the creation of their own central bank digital currencies, according to Statista. CBDCs are digital versions of real-world fiat money to eventually help speed cross-border retail transactions on blockchain in contrast to the slower speeds and price volatility of cryptocurrency. Blockchain's vaunted claims of imperviousness came under attack -- and not just figuratively. Blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis identified nearly 200 cryptocurrency or blockchain hacks, resulting in losses of $3.8 billion. The most noteworthy incident occurred when the video game blockchain Ronin Network reported the theft of $625 million worth of Ether and USDC stablecoins. The U.S. Treasury Department blamed a North Korean hacker collective for the attack.\n\n2023 The bad news for cryptocurrency continued as the SEC indicted executives at the Coinbase and Binance exchanges and filed charges against crypto-asset entrepreneur Justin Sun and three of his wholly owned companies for the unregistered offer and sale of crypto-asset securities. Businesses are still moving ahead with blockchain, but they're proceeding with greater caution. While blockchain technology has been mostly applicable to finance services and banking, other viable applications include gaming, media and entertainment, real estate, healthcare, cybersecurity, smart contracts, NFTs, IoT, transportation, supply chain management and the government. But the latest iteration of the internet, Web 3.0, with its offer of decentralization and data security, may well be the greatest driver of blockchain technology. Bitcoin for now has found some relatively solid footing in the $25,000 to $30,000 range. Bitcoin mining should reach Nakamoto's 21 million limit sometime around 2140."

        "content": "Want to jump straight to how to buy Wrapped Ethereum (WETH)? You can buy ETH on eToro, Webull or Robinhood and swap it for WETH.\n\nAre you looking to make an offer on the non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace OpenSea? Or do you want to stake WETH in a yield farming platform? To do so, you will first need to buy WETH, the wrapped version of Ether (WETH). Wrapped ETH (WETH) has a wider range of use cases than ETH.\n\nget started Limited Time Offer: Trade $100, Get $10 Buy $100 worth of crypto and get a $10 bonus! get started Disclosure: eToro supports the following currencies: BTC, ADA, DASH, DOGE, EOS, ETH, LTC, NEO, XLM, XTZ, TRX, ZEC. eToro USA LLC; Investments are subject to market risk, including the possible loss of principal.

Show More\n\nWhat is the Difference Between WETH and ETH?\n\nEther (ETH) is the native token of the Ethereum blockchain. If you are looking to use the ERC-20 standard of ETH, you may need to turn your ETH into WETH. This guide shows you how to buy Wrapped Ethereum (WETH).\n\nWhat is WETH?\n\nWrapped Ethereum (WETH) is an ERC-20 token pegged to Ethereum\u2019s native token ETH. The ERC-20 token standard allows for the capability of smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. A smart contract is a computer program that enforces the terms of an agreement. ERC-20 tokens allow for all kinds of things. Since both are pegged to Ethereum, ETH and WETH have the same price. If you want to access a service paid for using an ERC-20 token, you need to wrap your ETH. Some platforms automatically swap it for you as a first step in the transaction, but in other cases, you need to do it yourself. WETH is the tradable version of ETH and is frequently used on decentralized finance (DeFi) and decentralized application (dApp) platforms.\n\nBrief History of WETH\n\nWETH launched in 2017 and was pegged to ETH. ETH is the second largest cryptocurrency in the world and may even contest Bitcoin for the top spot. You can check out ETH\u2019s price history here.\n\nETH is unable to be exchanged directly with ERC-20 tokens that live on the Ethereum blockchain. To exchange ETH for these tokens you first wrap it, creating WETH. One of the main reasons WETH was created in the first place was to use dApps in the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nHow to Buy WETH\n\nBefore you learn how to buy WETH, you need ETH.\n\nStep 1: Open an Online Account.\n\nStep 1: Open an Online Account\n\nThe first step in getting WETH is to open an account on a crypto exchange to purchase ETH. To open an account, you\u2019ll need to provide things such as:\n\nYour full legal name\n\nYour address\n\nYour phone number and email address\n\nA government-issued ID (includes driver\u2019s license, passport or military ID)\n\nA password of your choice\n\nDepending on the exchange, you may need to provide more personal info. It's a good idea to have the information ready to go when opening an account. Most exchanges allow you to open an account in as little as a few minutes; however, some exchanges may take longer to verify your ID. Once your identity has been verified, you\u2019re ready to begin investing.\n\nPurchase ETH. Being the second largest cryptocurrency by market cap, many popular crypto trading platforms support Ethereum. Some of your best options include eToro, Webull and Robinhood Markets Inc. (NASDAQ: HOOD).\n\nStep 2: Buy or Download a Wallet (Optional).\n\nTo obtain WETH, you\u2019ll need a wallet that supports the token. You can choose from two main types of crypto wallets: hardware wallets and software wallets. Software wallets are often easier and faster to use but are less secure than their hardware counterparts. Some of the best options for software wallets on the market right now are the Exodus wallet and MetaMask. Then, you will be able to obtain WETH by connecting your wallet to a decentralized exchange (DEX) like Uniswap and swapping your ETH for WETH in a liquidity pool.\n\nBest Hardware Wallet: Ledger\n\nLedger is one of the top hardware wallets on the market. It is easy to use and supports sending and receiving WETH. Once you have purchased a Ledger hardware wallet, you download its software onto your computer and create an account.\n\nYou\u2019ll be assigned a wallet address (typically a long string of letters and numbers), and then you can send and receive thousands of cryptocurrencies through the wallet. Hardware wallets offer an extra level of security as opposed to software wallets, but they cost money, while software wallets are typically free. Additionally, Ledger provides the convenience of connecting to software wallets such as MetaMask to check your account balance while maintaining absolute custody of your wallet address.\n\nBest Software Wallet: MetaMask\n\nBest For: Ethereum wallet securely through MetaMask's website Get Started with MetaMask\n\nMetaMask is a free and widely used online wallet for Ethereum. It\u2019s available as an extension on Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Brave and Microsoft Edge browsers. It also has an app on iOS and Android phones.\n\nAllows you to swap ETH for WETH directly in the wallet.\n\nClick the wallet extension icon in upper right-hand of Google Chrome.\n\nClick Swap.\n\nSwap as much ETH for WETH as you'd like to.\n\nStep 3: Swap for WETH Through a DEX\n\nLaunch Uniswap.\n\nConnect your wallet with the \u201cConnect Wallet\u201d button in the upper right-hand corner.\n\nSelect ETH on the top and WETH on the bottom as shown below.\n\nEnter the desired amount of ETH you'd like to swap for WETH.\n\nPress Wrap, complete the transaction in the wallet window and in a few seconds your WETH should show up in your wallet\n\nNote: If you don't see your WETH after the swap goes through, you may need to add the token to MetaMask (or whichever wallet you are using). To do this all you need to do is scroll down in the Assets tab in the MetaMask window and click import tokens. You can either search for WETH there or copy and paste the token address from a site like CoinMarketCap.\n\nTrade, Sell or Convert Your ETH to WETH\n\nDeciding on whether to trade, sell or convert your crypto is based on your personal goals and preferences. If you are looking to take profits on WETH, a common strategy is to sell a portion of your WETH on the way up and keep a portion to hold long term to eliminate some risk. Most exchanges allow you to sell your crypto for cash or trade it for USDC, a stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar. If you are trying to accumulate more crypto long term, taking profits when crypto prices go up could allow you to accumulate more when prices go back down.\n\nBy following the steps above, you can convert your ETH to WETH using Uniswap. If you are looking to place an offer on OpenSea, you will need to convert your ETH to WETH. If you want to sell your WETH for cash, it's easiest to first convert it back to ETH.\n\nCurrent Crypto Prices\n\nSince reaching all-time highs in November 2021, crypto prices have dropped. In November 2021, Bitcoin saw its all-time high of over $69,000, and Ethereum saw its all-time high of over $4,800. However, in June of 2022, Bitcoin and Ethereum hit multi-year lows. Bitcoin went to $17,601.58, and Ethereum reached $883.15. In 2023, both tokens have been able to rally, putting Bitcoin around $25,000 and Ethereum around $1,700. Crypto prices seem to be holding on macro levels.\n\nIs WETH a Good Investment?\n\nWETH can be a good investment if you are looking to have tradable ETH to do things like make bids on OpenSea. However, since it is pegged to the price of ETH, its price will follow suit. To read more about if ETH is a good investment please visit here.\n\nClaim Now Get up to $200 in rewards with Coinbase!

If you encounter any issues, kindly report them to [email protected]. Crypto assets/products can be highly risky. Never invest unless you\u2019re prepared to lose all the money you invest.\n\nMicrosoft AI has now unveiled its top three crypto predictions, and they are Ethereum (ETH), Filecoin (FIL), and Everlodge (ELDG). According to it, these tokens show positive market trends, adoption rates, and technological advancements. So, if you\u2019re looking for the next big crypto opportunities, read on to find out what makes these tokens appealing.\n\nSummary\n\nEthereum open interest on the rise\n\nFilecoin partners up with Brave\n\nEverlodge to solve long-standing real estate market issues\n\nJoin the Everlodge presale and win a luxury holiday to the Maldives\n\nEthereum (ETH): Open Interest Soars\n\nMicrosoft AI\u2019s selection of Ethereum (ETH) as a top token for the upcoming year aligns with the growing interest and activity surrounding this leading blockchain platform. In recent Ethereum news, data indicates a surge in interest in its derivatives, with open interest soaring by 4.1% to an impressive $5B on September 25th.\n\nFurthermore, the trading volume for Ethereum derivatives has experienced a remarkable 332% increase, surging to $10.35B. This surge in derivatives activity shows the significance of Ethereum in the crypto ecosystem, highlighting its relevance not just for developers but also for traders and investors.\n\nMarket analysts are closely watching Ethereum at the moment. They forecast that the Ethereum price will range from $2,048.41 to $2,335.71 within the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nFilecoin (FIL): New Partnership With Brave\n\nFilecoin (FIL) is another top token picked by Microsoft AI. This pick is supported by its involvement in a high-profile partnership to enhance privacy features for the Brave browser. To clarify, in collaboration with Zcash developer Electric Coin Company (ECC), the Filecoin Foundation is set to introduce innovative privacy features.\n\nThese features will leverage the Zcash protocol\u2019s shielded transactions for enhanced privacy and security. Additionally, the partnership will further harness the power of Filecoin\u2019s InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) to improve the Brave browser\u2019s decentralized nature.\n\nAs per Microsoft AI, this strategic collaboration positions Filecoin as a critical player in developing privacy-focused technologies. Regarding price predictions, market analysts are keeping a close eye on its potential, and they forecast the Filecoin price to reach $5.46 by December 2023.\n\nEverlodge (ELDG): Transforming Real Estate with Blockchain\n\nEverlodge (ELDG), a rising star in the crypto world, has also piqued the curiosity of Microsoft AI. This groundbreaking property marketplace has set its sights on revolutionizing the real estate market. By leveraging blockchain technology, Everlodge aims to solve long-standing issues such as transparency, liquidity, and accessibility in the real estate sector.\n\nFor instance, traditional real estate investment is often reserved for the wealthy due to high entry costs. Everlodge eliminates this barrier by allowing fractional ownership of properties. By digitizing and minting hotels and villas into NFTs that are then fractionalized, investors can buy fractions of properties, making real estate investment accessible.\n\nHey, Lodgers! :house_with_garden:\n\n\n\nDo you know? :thinking_face:\n\nWith $ELDG, enjoy the warmth of passive income, monthly surprises, and exclusive club access.\n\nPlus, who can resist sweet discounts?\n\n\n\nDive into a token that feels like home. :blue_heart:\n\n\n\nJoin the presale: https://t.co/kIufYkD05d#Presale pic.twitter.com/9yzt5hZhul \u2014 Everlodge (@EverlodgeHQ) September 26, 2023\n\nAdditionally, Everlodge lending is a pioneering feature that facilitates property developers in raising capital from the community for new real estate developments. This unique approach benefits developers by providing them with a source of funding and opens doors for users to participate in promising projects at their early stages.\n\nDue to all these reasons, Microsoft AI claims that Everlodge is the token to watch in 2023. It also has real-world ties to the $4.5T worth of hospitality industry. The ELDG native token is now worth just $0.019 as it is in Stage 4 of its presale. In fact, experts foresee a 30x pump on its launch day after a Tier-1 CEX listing.\n\nFind out more about the Everlodge (ELDG) Presale\n\nWebsite: https://www.everlodge.io/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/everlodge"

She has 10+year experience in writing - accordingly she is avid journalists with a passion towards researching new insights coming into crypto erena.\n\nIn a move that has left the cryptocurrency community buzzing, famous crypto influencer Mr. Huber took to Twitter to express his disbelief over the recent legal proceedings against Steven Nerayoff, a former Ethereum advisor. \u201cThis stinks to high heaven,\u201d Huber tweeted, addressing the U.S. Department of Justice\u2019s (DOJ) seemingly paradoxical stance in the case.\n\nWhy I believe Nerayoff: You have to imagine how strange this is. He and Hladys are charged with extortion. Hladys pleads guilty and in his confession states that he agreed to Nerrayoff's idea of extortion. And what happens afterwards? The DOJ then goes on in the very same\u2026 pic.twitter.com/UjfzMriy9U \u2014 Mr. Huber\ud83d\udd25\ud83e\udd85\ud83d\udd25 (@Leerzeit) September 27, 2023\n\nA Brief Background:\n\nOn January 10, 2020, Nerayoff and Hlady were charged with Hobbs Act Extortion Conspiracy, among other allegations, for extorting money and Ethereum (ETH) from a Seattle-based cryptocurrency business called Company 1. These charges covered their dealings with the company, leading up to its ICO in November 2017, and a 10,000 ETH loan from Company 1 in March 2018.\n\nMichael Hlady pled guilty and openly confessed his agreement with Nerayoff to extort Company 1. This act usually would seal the fate of a co-defendant, especially when the plea involves admitting to conspiracy.\n\nBut the DOJ made an extraordinary move. On February 13, 2023, the department filed a motion that aimed to dismiss the indictment against Nerayoff.\n\nNerayoff Strikes Back:\n\nSteven Nerayoff didn\u2019t sit quietly, either. He took to Twitter to present his view that the SEC and the government attempted to co-opt the cryptocurrency industry. He also mentioned he was one of the very few people who had a list of ETH contributors, subtly hinting at the leverage he holds.\n\nTo fuel the fire, Nerayoff leaked email conversations dating back to July 21, 2014, which involved Ethereum co-founders Vitalik Buterin and Joseph Lubin. Tagging them as \u201c#CryptoJudas\u201d and \u201c#CrookedElbowJoe\u201d respectively, he appeared to assert that his contributions to Ethereum were being discredited.\n\nUnanswered Questions:\n\nWhy would the DOJ reject its case despite having a co-defendant\u2019s guilty plea?\n\nWhat are the broader implications of Nerayoff\u2019s potential \u201ccontributor list\u201d?\n\nIs there a more extensive conspiracy in the Ethereum and wider crypto community?\n\nIs Ethereum facing a karmic reckoning? Long perceived to have received a regulatory \u201cfree pass\u201d compared to other cryptocurrencies like XRP\u2014which faced intense scrutiny despite its arguably superior technology\u2014Ethereum now grapples with its controversies, including scalability issues and governance dilemmas. Only time will tell if this is a small bump in the road or a sign that Ethereum\u2019s luck is running out."

Most seem to believe the Ethereum price could reach high four figures, or around $8000, by the end of 2023. Many believe the general trend of crypto adoption around the world will carry the overall crypto market, including Ethereum, higher and higher each year.\n\nEthereum price prediction 2024\n\nCopy link to section\n\nWhat will Ethereum be worth in 2024? It\u2019s believed that the price of Ethereum may dip below $8000 in 2024. Reasons for this vary but it seems to point to a potential bear Ethereum market or a consolidation period. After that, though, the ETH price prediction starts to turn back upwards for a bull run after that period of consolidation.\n\nEthereum price prediction 2025\n\nCopy link to section\n\nWhat will Ethereum be worth in 2025? By 2025 the Ethereum price could be around $14,000. By then, the Ethereum blockchain could be host to a huge range of businesses and that the total crypto market capitalisation could be well over $10 trillion.\n\nEthereum price prediction 2030\n\nCopy link to section\n\nWhat will Ethereum be worth in 2030? By the end of 2030 it\u2019s generally accepted that the Ethereum price could reach $30,000. Alongside Ethereum, the price of bitcoin could be in the high six-figure range and the total crypto market capitalisation will be eye-watering.\n\nWhat affects the price of Ethereum?\n\nCopy link to section\n\nThe fundamentals of the Ethereum network along with the health of the overall market factor into Ethereum prices. Any Ethereum forecast assumes that it continues to maintain its position as the primary blockchain network, and that the smart contract functionality continues to improve to attract new people, businesses, and developers to create on the network.\n\nHere are the key factors that affect the Ethereum price.\n\nThe fundamentals\n\nCopy link to section\n\n\u2018Fundamental\u2019 factors refer to the underlying reasons why people might want to use Ethereum technology.\n\nThe Ethereum network has helped to revolutionise the crypto space, providing a home for decentralised applications that can bring a large number of everyday tasks onto the blockchain. The largest sector is decentralised finance (DeFi), where apps built on Ethereum offer financial services, such as loans, interest payments, and lending.\n\nPlenty of other crypto sectors are primarily based on the Ethereum blockchain, including crypto gaming (GameFi) and some metaverse platforms. As the largest blockchain network that boasts smart contract functionality, Ethereum allows developers a great deal of freedom in creating a code base that can support a large volume of users on a complex system.\n\nFor the consensus Ethereum price prediction to be accurate over the long term, it needs to maintain its place as the dominant blockchain network. It needs to continue developing its technology, so that it becomes more scalable. The Ethereum merge helped towards this goal by reducing gas fees and ensuring the network can process more transactions.\n\nOther smart contract blockchains, like Polkadot, Solana, and Cardano, are poised to challenge Ethereum\u2019s dominance and put a dent in its market cap if it slacks on any of these issues.\n\nThe technicals\n\nCopy link to section\n\nTechnical analysis involves studying the Ethereum price history using various chart indicators to try and predict what the ETH price will do over a period of time. Technical analysis can be useful in finding the right time to buy or sell an asset, and it is these chart impacts that usually guide the Ethereum price fluctuations in the short term.\n\nYou can use these analysis techniques to try to judge whether Ethereum\u2019s price is under or overvalued, and thus whether it represents a good time to buy or not.\n\nThe Moving Average, for example, is an indicator that can show the median price of a specific number of candles on a candle chart. Another technical skill is to take notice of an asset\u2019s trading volume. Traders can use volume to monitor its activity and predict whether a move to the downside or upside may kick in soon.\n\nEthereum price history\n\nCopy link to section\n\nThe Ethereum price has followed the same pattern as many other cryptocurrencies, in that it surged to all time highs in late 2021 before falling off in 2022. In 2020 it hit a low of about $85 and a little over a year later was trading at over $4000. The chart below shows how its price has changed over time.\n\nSource: Tradingview\n\nKey levels to watch\n\nCopy link to section\n\nDepending on the market sentiment the Ethereum price could reach lows of around $3000 before ranging until mid to late 2023 and breaking its all-time high of $4,878 after that.\n\nThis relies on the performance of the American and western financial markets as well as levels of inflation in \u2018fiat\u2019 currencies (such as the US Dollar), and interest rate rises in traditional finance markets. Although they\u2019re not directly crypto-related, the performance of the stock market can influence the price of cryptocurrency assets because so many institutions are now involved in crypto.\n\nEthereum\u2019s low $2000 range during the May 2021 crash could be a psychological support level that the market will be eyeing closely if there was to be another similar event. A $2000 and $4000 bracket would be a reasonable range for the ETH price to consolidate in after a rise before breaking on up above its all time high.\n\nIs ETH a good long term investment?\n\nCopy link to section\n\nWhether Ethereum 2.0 will be successful or not will determine the accuracy of these Ethereum forecasts. There are many potential \u201cEthereum killers\u201d in the market but none have come close to toppling the giant. If Ethereum fails to solve its scaling issues, then other coin\u2019s will fight for the top spot underneath Bitcoin. Hopefully, Ethereum 2.0 will be a success and live up to its promises.\n\nThe market overall will go through many peaks and troughs. The troughs may last months and the peaks could be short-lived, but the general trajectory of the overall market is likely to be upwards.\n\nAll Ethereum needs to do is build and continue to be the capital of DeFi. If you\u2019re a believer that the Ethereum team can deliver ETH2 effectively, then investing in Ethereum will be a great long-term investment for years to come.\n\nKey takeaways\n\nCopy link to section\n\nThere is no guarantee that these Ethereum price predictions may come true. Every Ethereum price forecast should be taken with a grain of salt. The crypto market is ever-changing, and nobody can be spot on with their predictions for such a long-time frame. Despite this, it\u2019s generally accepted that the Ethereum price can reach $6000 soon, and then $10,000 shortly afterwards.\n\nWhat is Ethereum worth in 2023? The Ethereum (ETH) price has ranged between $1,000 and $2,000 in 2024. Ethereum prices move all the time, but have stayed within that range for the majority of 2024. What is Ethereum\u2019s all time high? ETH\u2019s all time high is $4951. It reached its maximum price in November 2021. In December of the same year it almost reached that level again but has fallen off since. Can Ethereum reach $10,000 Yes. According to analyst forecasts Ethereum\u2019s price will be $10,000 between 2024 \u2013 2025. What will Ethereum be worth in 2030? $30,000 is the forecasted price a number of experts have given for 2030. What are Ethereum\u2019s key price levels? Its all time high at $4950 is a strong level that will have the attention of traders and analysts. Round levels such as $2000, $3000, and $4000 are also important levels to keep an eye on. Is now a good time to buy Ethereum? It could be. If you agree with the analyst predictions on this page then buying Ethereum in 2023 could be a good idea. All leading experts believe its price will rise with some predicting substantial gains in the coming years. Buying now could be a good way to ride the anticipated bull trend.\n\nSources & references Our editors fact-check all content to ensure compliance with our strict editorial policy.

The markets are calling for a $30,000 level for BTC soon. However, a support level at $26,000 has to be maintained to expect an upside movement in the short term. On the other hand, the (in)famous coin Terra LUNA or LUNA2 (+20.5 percent) has been pumping. This price action is being attributed to LUNA\u2019s community passing a proposal that makes them move away with the minting of new USTC stablecoins, which was the supposed-to-be stable coin of the Terra Luna ecosystem, UST. This is happening in the wake of LUNA founder Do Kwon's lawyers having replied to his extradition request from the United States authorities.\u201d\n\nRajagopal Menon, Vice President, WazirX, said, \u201cBitcoin and Ethereum have shown recovery in prices. The market dynamics are set to shift as China slowly starts embracing crypto. The US government shutdown might disrupt ongoing plans for interest rates by the Fed, prompting a whole new approach. The government\u2019s decisions on crypto regulations might also see a shift or delay with impending developments.\u201d\n\nSathvik Vishwanath, CEO and co-founder of Unocoin, said, \u201cBitcoin is showing a bullish bias as it has recently failed to hold above $26,750. It bounced off the $26,000 support, a crucial psychological level, on the 4-hour chart. The $26,779 mark formed a strong double-top pattern that acted as resistance. Although it has bounced back from this level, it remains above the $22,000 support. A hold above $26,000 could target $26,750 and potentially $27,450. Leading indicators show mixed sentiment with 50-day EMA around $26,300 and BTC price fluctuating, RSI in the sell zone but MACD presenting bullish signals. The pivotal $26,000 level will dictate Bitcoin's bullish or bearish tendencies for investors to watch closely.\u201d\n\nShivam Thakral, CEO of BuyUcoin, said, \u201cThe overall crypto market cap witnessed a jump of 0.5 percent and touched the $1.5 trillion mark. BTC and ETH witnessed marginal fluctuation in their value and are currently trading at $26,330.60 and $1,603.02 levels respectively. The rate hike fears may keep traders away from riskier assets for some time but the situation may change if macroeconomic factors turn favourable.\u201d\n\nSubscribe And Follow ABP Live On Telegram: t.me/officialabplive\n\nDisclaimer: Crypto products and NFTs are unregulated and can be highly risky.

This comes amid mounting anticipation of a possible US government shutdown.\n\nFirst Ethereum Futures ETF Could Launch Monday\n\nBloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas provided significant insight on this development in a tweet: \u201cUPDATE: Hearing the SEC wants to accelerate the launch of Ether futures ETFs (bc they want it off their plate bf shutdown) so they\u2019ve asked the filers to update their docs by Fri pm (no small task to jam into 48hrs, esp for indie issuers), so they can go eff Mon and trade Tue.\u201d\n\nLooking like the SEC is gonna let a bunch #Ethereum futures ETFs go next week potentially https://t.co/YoBD1d1ay8 \u2014 James Seyffart (@JSeyff) September 28, 2023\n\nHis colleague, Bloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffart, confirmed the sentiment, noting that it\u2019s \u201clooking like the SEC is gonna let a bunch Ethereum futures ETFs go next week potentially.\u201d Although a recent report from Bloomberg had posited that Ethereum futures ETFs held a 90% chance of launching in October, these latest updates seem to reinforce the immediate timeline.\n\nAs per the previous forecast, Valkyrie\u2019s Bitcoin futures ETF (BTF) was set to be the first to incorporate Ethereum exposure on Oct. 3, with a strategy shift that will see the inclusion from Oct. 4. Volatility Shares, another issuer, was anticipated to be the first to exclusively offer Ethereum futures exposure, expected to take effect on Oct. 11, facilitating a launch on Oct. 12. Due to the impending US government shutdown, launch approvals by the SEC could already be pushed forward to next week.\n\nBut as Bloomberg notes, out of the 15 Ethereum futures ETFs filed by nine issuers, not all are expected to be given the green light. Notable issuers in the queue encompass VanEck, ProShares, Grayscale, Volatility Shares, Bitwise, Direxion, and Roundhill.\n\nImplications Of The Decision\n\nScott Johnsson, a finance lawyer at Davis Polk, commented on the SEC\u2019s eleventh-hour approach: \u201cI want everyone to realize Gensler waited until now (giving the issuers 48 hours) because he didn\u2019t want to answer questions about this at the HFSC hearing earlier today. You know, just functional agency things.\u201d\n\nJohnsson highlighted significant ramifications, including the implicit confirmation from Gensler\u2019s SEC that CME ETH futures are not security futures, thereby solidifying Ethereum\u2019s status outside the purview of being a security. The move could lay the groundwork for spot-traded ETFs, as it would mean an approval that SEC Chairman Gensler will not withdraw Bitcoin futures approvals to prevent a spot ETF. Johnson had discussed this possibility in the past.\n\nThe looming US government shutdown, set for 12:01 am ET on Oct. 1 if Congress doesn\u2019t finalize a new fiscal year\u2019s funding, threatens to disrupt operations across federal agencies, including financial regulators. This urgency seems to underscore the SEC\u2019s push for expedited ETF approvals.\n\nThough the Ethereum futures ETFs\u2019 potential introduction has stirred the crypto sphere, it\u2019s crucial to note that the excitement surrounding these instruments doesn\u2019t match the fervor seen for their spot-based counterparts. The US has already hosted Bitcoin futures ETFs since 2021.\n\nAt press time, the ETH price was at $1,609, showing no reaction to the positive news so far.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock, chart from TradingView.com"

        "title": "Surprise: BIS Used Ethereum Testnet And Curve Finance's Code In CBDC Pilot - Bitcoinist",
        "content": "Project Mariana, an initiative whose goal was to explore the application of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) in enhancing the efficiency and security of cross-border payments, has been successfully concluded, the Bank of France has confirmed.\n\nEven as this pilot comes to an end, one developer notes that the Bank of International Settlements (BIS) reportedly utilized the public Ethereum Sepolia testnet and Curve Finance\u2019s smart contracts as the base of Project Mariana, testing and measuring the efficacy of cross-border Forex automated market maker (AMM) pilot.\n\nThe CBDC project depended on Curve Finance\u2019s code. Even so, the BIS wanted to keep the use of Curve\u2019s framework private. So far, there has been no comment from Curve Finance or any Ethereum core developers regarding Project Mariana\u2019s use of decentralized finance (DeFi) code or architecture.\n\nHowever, looking at Curve Finance\u2019s experience in enabling stablecoin movement and swapping, their expertise could have been valuable. DeFiLlama data on September 28 shows that Curve Finance had over $2.1 billion in total value locked (TVL).\n\nCurve Finance is a decentralized exchange (DEX) for trading stablecoins, tokenized fiat, issued privately by entities such as Circle or Tether Holdings. The protocol depends on an automated market maker (AMM) model to draw liquidity and ensure price discovery at low slippage.\n\nProject Mariana, a platform by the BIS and multiple central banks such as the Bank of France and the Swiss National Bank, used the same architecture for the same goals as in Curve Finance: access liquidity and achieve price discovery.\n\nIt is unclear which versions of Vyper were used to code the smart contracts in this pilot. However, it is worth noting that Curve Finance experienced a hack in late July, resulting in over $60 million loss. This happened due to a vulnerability in older versions of Vyper that was exploited through a re-entrancy attack.\n\nAnti-CBDC Bill Supported By Republicans In The United States\n\nWhile the BIS says central banks should first create a CBDC framework, the anti-CBDC bill, or the CBDC Anti-Surveillance State Act, introduced by pro-crypto Congressman Tom Emmer in February 2023, was recently considered by the House Financial Services Committee on September 20, 2023. The bill is yet to be voted by the full House of Representatives.\n\nIf adopted, the act will bar the Federal Reserve, the US central bank, from issuing a digital version of the dollar. The bill is widely supported by Republicans and opposed by Democrats. Supporters are concerned about abuse, claiming that CBDCs give \u201cgovernments more power and infringe on privacy rights.\u201d\n\nFeature image from Canva, chart from TradingView"

        "content": "The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization Ethereum ($ETH) has seen its protocol revenue surpass the $10 billion mark after significant growth that has seen it overtake tech titans like Microsoft and Adobe in reaching the milestone.\n\nAccording to a report from cryptocurrency brokerage firm Caleb & Brown, it took Ethereum around 7.5 years to reach $10 billion in annual revenue, while it took Microsoft and Above 19 and 20 years to reach that milestone, respectively.\n\nThe data further shows that Ethereum reached the $10 billion mark through fees collected on transactions and other network activities, which include payments for using decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, minting and trading ERC-20 tokens and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and more.\n\n\ud83d\udca5 #Ethereum surpasses $10B Revenue in 7 years!$ETH has generated US$16.8 billion in fees since 2015, with over 60.0% of this converting into revenue. \ud83d\udc40 pic.twitter.com/MxQdY0uezu \u2014 RR2Capital (@RR2Capital) September 26, 2023\n\nEthereum\u2019s network revenue has notably plummeted by over 77% since last year, amid a wider crypto market slump. The decentralized platform has earned $1.7 billion in 2023 so far, according to Token Terminal, a crypto analytics company.\n\nHowever, a VanEck valuation projects that Ethereum could increase its annual revenue from $2.6 billion to $51 billion by 2030, if it continues to grow its user base. Notably, a recent JPMorgan report suggests that after the Shanghai upgrade, Ethereum failed to meet expectations and attract institutional interest.\n\nEthereum\u2019s key performance indicators, such as daily transactions, active user addresses, and the total value locked in decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, have all apparently seen a downturn after an underwhelming boost in network activity.\n\nThe amount of Ether staked has increased by 50% since the Shanghai upgrade, but this has not translated into heightened network activity, partly over the recent collapse of cryptocurrency ecosystems like Terra and of crypto exchange FTX.\n\nCurrent data from Etherscan reveals that Ethereum facilitated over 883,000 transactions on September 24, 2023. However, this was a decline from the 1.93 million transactions recorded on December 9. At present, the mean transaction fee hovers around $0.74.\n\nFeatured image via Pixabay."

A daily close above the $1,665 level and the 50-day simple moving average could start a fresh increase in October 2023.\n\nThe next resistance might be $1,750 in October 2023, above which the price could rise toward $1,880. Any more gains could open the doors for a move toward $2,000.\n\nConversely, Ethereum might fail to clear the $1,620 and $1,665 resistance levels. In the stated case, the ETH price might decline below the $1,580 level in October 2023. Initial support is near the $1,550 level. The main breakdown support is near the $1,530 level.\n\nA daily close below the $1,530 level might lead to a strong decline. In the stated case, Ethereum may perhaps drop toward the $1,440 support in October 2023. Any more losses could open the doors for a move toward the $1,380 support zone.\n\nOverall, Ether\u2019s price attempts an upside break above the $1,620 resistance in October 2023. To start a fresh rally, the bulls must push ETH price above $1,620 and $1,665. Conversely, the price might decline heavily below $1,530."

        "title": "Understanding EIP-4844: Ethereum's Upgrade Focusing On Blobs - Blockzeit",
        "content": "The notoriously high gas fees in the Ethereum blockchain have been one of the greatest deterrents to its mass adoption. However, after the Merge and Shanghai upgrades comes the next big ticket item on Ethereum\u2019s development roadmap, which is the Ethereum Improvement proposal (EIP) 4844, called Proto-sharding.\n\nEIP-4844 introduces a new transaction type called blobs. We explain what EIP-4844 is all about and understand what blobs are.\n\nEthereum Cancun Upgrade\n\nEthereum Cancun-Deneb, also identified as Dencun or EIP-4844, is the new upcoming upgrade to the Ethereum blockchain. The upgrade is aimed at enhancing the network\u2019s scalability, security, and usability.\n\nThe major feature of the upgrade is the inception of Proto-Danksharding, which signifies a changing phase towards full Danksharding. This move is expected to significantly reduce gas fees and increase transaction throughput by utilizing data \u2018blobs.\u2019\n\nBloc-carrying transactions are like any normal Ethereum transaction but have some extra set of data called a blob. The blobs are considerably large and cheaper than the celldata they currently have.\n\nWhile rollups have helped to scale Execution, Proto-Danksharding (PDS, with EIP-4844) is on track to help scale data availability with blobs. Blobs comes as a new type of gas-saving vehicle where rollups can park transactions and proof data efficiently.\n\nWhat is Sharding, Danksharding, and Proto-Danksharding?\n\nSharding is a method mostly used by blockchain networks to enhance capacity and performance. This method is easily achieved through partitioning the network into smaller units called shards. These partitions are capable of processing transactions independently.\n\nParallel processing, in turn, boosts the efficiency of any network, which in turn lowers network congestion and, as a result, reduces gas fees. Sharding, introduced by Ethereum, is a critical step towards making the network more scalable and accessible.\n\nDanksharding is the current mechanism on the Ethereum blockchain, utilizing Binary Large Objects (blobs), which signify large amounts of data that help further increase transaction throughput. This type of sharding is a full realization of how Ethereum rollups will achieve scalability, and it was created to help in the lowering of transaction costs on the Ethereum network.\n\nProto-Danksharding is a transitional phase towards full Danksharding. With the introduction of blobs, Proto-Danksharding\u2019s goal is to prepare the Ethereum network for full Danksharding in the coming days. Proto-Danksharding is the main focus of the new Ethereum upgrade (EIP-4844).\n\nHow EIP-4844 Helps in Reducing Gas Fees\n\nBlob-carrying transactions, in EIP-4844 act more like sidecars attached to Ethereum transactions. However, they include some additional pieces of information. The blobs are large in size (some up to 128kb) but are inexpensive when compared to the current celldata. As such, they are a cost-effective solution for reducing gas fees.\n\nBlob data is cheaper as the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) cannot access it. The EVM can only view a commitment to the blob.\n\nWhen EIP-4844 temporarily stores these blobs on the Ethereum consensus layer, EIP-4844 aims at significantly reducing the cost of data from rollups to the Ethereum base layer, hence lowering transaction fees.\n\nThe actual gas savings realized by EIP-4844 will depend on the degree to which blobs are adopted, but rough initial estimates show a 10-100x improvement for rollup transaction costs.\n\nBesides the blob-carrying transactions, the new Ethereum Cancun Upgrade will also include the implementation of execution-layer logic, verification rules, and a two-dimensional fee market, all of which are necessary for full Danksharding.\n\nExpected Launch Date of the Ethereum Cancun Upgrade\n\nThe Ethereum Devnet-9 is set to launch on September 27, 2023. This testnet will play a crucial role as it will feature a number of changes for the upcoming Cancun upgrade. Some of the EIPs, like EIP-7514 and EIP-7516, will be live for the first time in Devnet-9.\n\nThere still needs to be clarity as to when the upgrade will go live on the mainnet.\n\nEIP-4844 will implement some parts of full Danksharding. One part will be a new transaction type with the same format that will exist in full sharding. Also, it will introduce all the execution-layer logic necessary in full sharding, and also the execution/cross-verification logic, and a self-adjusting gas price for blobs.\n\nHowever, proof-of-custody or any similar in-protocol requirement to verify sharded data in each block will remain pending.\n\nThe Advantages of Ethereum Cancun\n\nThe Ethereum Cancun upgrade will bring in several benefits to the network, which will include:\n\nBoosted scalability: Introducing Proto-Danksharding automatically means that there will be a higher volume of transactions and a quicker processing rate. As a result, it will enhance Layer 2 solutions, which operate on top of the main blockchain.\n\nReduced Gas Fees: utilizing data blobs and implementing EIP-4844, the upgrade will, in turn, cut down the gas fees, a move that will benefit Layer 2 solutions, making transactions more affordable.\n\nTop-notch Security: Ethereum\u2019s security infrastructure will be fortified, which will, in turn, safeguard user data and investments.\n\nIn a nutshell, the Cancun upgrade is set to make the Ethereum network more adaptable, secure, and user-friendly, which pushed its position in the crypto space.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nEthereum\u2019s journey towards addressing its long-standing issue of high gas fees takes a significant step forward with the introduction of Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 4844, also known as Proto-Danksharding. This upgrade, part of the Ethereum Cancun-Deneb release, promises to enhance the Ethereum network in multiple ways, ultimately making it more scalable, secure, and user-friendly.\n\nThe primary feature of EIP-4844 is the introduction of \u201cblobs,\u201d a new transaction type that carries substantial amounts of data at a much lower cost than the current cell data. As the Ethereum network continues evolving and improving, upgrades like EIP-4844 will play a crucial role in enhancing the network\u2019s capabilities as it expands closer to a platform for global transactions."
