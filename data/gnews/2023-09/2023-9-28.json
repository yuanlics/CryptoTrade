The second assumption is that the staking appetite by Ethereum holders is sustained above the maximum churn for the next several months. This may not be the case given that the number of validators in the entry queue has been declining.

        "content": "Ethereum ETH -1.55% dominates web3 developer activity across the U.S., while BNB -1.87% Chain leads the market in Europe and Asia, according to a report from crypto infrastructure provider Chainstack.\n\nWeb3 app developers utilize nodes hosted on traditional cloud platforms like Amazon Web Services. Chainstack examined its user infrastructure data to determine their usage patterns.\n\nChainstack runs nodes on behalf of its users, who can make requests to the nodes when wanting to make transactions or receive blockchain information. By analyzing node dominance and protocol preferences in 2023, Chainstack gained insight into web3 infrastructure trends and the popularity of various protocols by region and node type.\n\nProtocol preferences by region\n\nEthereum dominated in terms of protocol preferences in the U.S., with 18.8 billion (38.9%) of node requests, followed by BNB Chain with 31.3% and Polygon with 17.2%. Interest in Avalanche and Solana was also notable, accounting for 4.8% and 2.4% of node requests, respectively.\n\nIn Europe, BNB Chain led developer activity, registering 5.4 billion node requests (24.4%), closely followed by Polygon and Avalanche with 22.8% and 22.6%, respectively. Ethereum came in fourth place at 18.3%, with Arbitrum accounting for 8.6% and Solana 4.5%.\n\nBNB Chain also dominated in Asia, registering 3.4 billion requests, 72.1% of node infrastructure. Ethereum followed at 25.4%, with Polygon and Arbitrum generating 4.5% and 4.3% of requests, respectively.\n\nFull versus archive nodes\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nFull nodes dominated the market across all regions compared to archive nodes. Full nodes, in many crypto ecosystems, provide a more efficient solution by trimming blockchain data \u2014 compared to maintaining a full archive of transaction history state.\n\nThe preference was particularly notable in Asia, accounting for 99.5% of total requests. Full nodes served 65.8% of requests in the U.S. and 71% in Europe.\n\nWhen it comes to cost-effectiveness and scalability, elastic nodes were largely preferred. Elastic nodes can be accessed by multiple users and applications simultaneously, as opposed to dedicated nodes deployed for a single use or application.\n\nElastic nodes were again strongly preferred in Asia, registering 89.6% of requests. They also dominate in Europe at 61%. However, in the U.S., dedicated nodes lead with 52.6% of total requests.\n\nChainstack says it supports over 25 of the largest blockchain networks, including Ethereum, Bitcoin, Polygon and BNB Chain, enabling developers to deploy, manage and scale their dapps and used by projects such as 1inch, TheGraph, Chainlink, LayerZero and Trust Wallet."

        "title": "SEC drags on with spot Bitcoin ETFs, Ethereum futures get a nod - InvestmentNews",
        "content": "The SEC gave a big present to crypto ETF firms late last week ahead of the government shutdown that appeared inevitable, reportedly granting approval for a number of ethereum futures strategies that could start trading soon.\n\nFirst on its list appears to be Valkyrie Funds, which had filed with the regulator to add ethereum futures to its existing Bitcoin Strategy ETF. Another firm, VanEck, announced Thursday that it would soon launch its Ethereum Futures ETF, declining to give a precise date. And according to reporting by Reuters, the biggest bitcoin futures ETF shop, ProShares, was also granted approval. That firm similarly announced on its site that its three ETFs featuring ethereum futures would be available soon.\n\nThe development, much as any previous indications that the SEC might be moving forward with approval of crypto-themed funds, led to a mass of additional filings for products. Other firms that essentially got in line for approval by the SEC include Kelly ETFs and Bitwise.\n\nBut the apparent approvals of ethereum futures ETF followed news that likely upset crypto fund proponents, with the SEC indicating a further delay in approving spot bitcoin products. Since Grayscale Investments\u2019 recent court win over the SEC\u2019s denial of its application, there has been mounting pressure on the agency to begin approving spot bitcoin ETFs.\n\n\u201cThe SEC has been clearing their desks ahead of the possible government shutdown, which means issuing delays for spot bitcoin ETF filings while likely allowing ether future ETFs to potentially begin trading early next week,\u201d Roxanna Islam, head of sector and industry research at VettaFi, said in an email. \u201cIt\u2019s likely that these products will be accelerated to launch sooner than later before the government shutdown occurs.\u201d\n\nThat shutdown was temporarily averted on Saturday, with Congress approving a spending bill that will continue to keep the government open for 45 days.\n\nOn Friday, Valkyrie filed an update with the SEC in which it appeared to back away from an immediate launch of an ethereum futures strategy within its bitcoin ETF.\n\n\u201cEffectively immediately, the fund will not purchase ether futures contracts until the effectiveness of an amendment to the fund\u2019s registration statement contemplating the addition of ether futures contracts to the principal investment strategy of the fund. Until such time, the fund will unwind any existing positions in ether futures contracts,\u201d the company stated.\n\nWhile the approvals are a step forward for crypto ETF providers, it\u2019s only a minor development compared with the eventual launch of spot products, demand for which is expected to quickly eclipse that of crypto futures ETFs.\n\nAlthough there has been significant interest in the biggest bitcoin futures ETF, the $952 million ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF, advisors who want crypto funds are waiting for spot products, said Tyrone Ross, CEO and co-founder of Turnqey Labs.\n\n\u201cFinancial advisors have no interest in futures ETFs. Most advisors want a spot bitcoin or spot ethereum ETF,\u201d Ross said. \u201cAs far as advisors go, it\u2019s a miss.\u201d\n\nThere could be demand among retail investors and hedge funds, but the complicated nature of futures products, on top of the crypto asset class that many people do not understand, make them a tough sell to advisors, he said.\n\n\u201cCrypto is hard enough. But now I have to explain a crypto futures product?\u201d Ross said, adding that the fees for the products can also be discouraging. \u201cFrom a compliance standpoint, it\u2019s going to be hard to get a futures product [approved].\u201d\n\nRoss is not a fan of ETFs for crypto in any form, but said that the \u201cbroader wealth management space is a little giddy\u201d as the ethereum futures ETF approvals \u201cmeans more pressure is being put on [SEC Chair] Gary Gensler and that we are closer to approval of a spot ETF.\u201d\n\nGiven that anyone who wants to hold ethereum can do so through a U.S. exchange, the futures ETFs approval \u201cis kind of a nothingburger,\u201d said Mike Alfred, whose hedge fund Alpine Fox focuses on bitcoin and bitcoin-related equities.\n\n\u201cIt may be bullish for ethereum traders in the short term,\u201d as the approvals mean another avenue of quasi access to it, he said.\n\nSpot products will offer lower fees compared with those of futures products, Alfred said.\n\n\u201cThe real embedded cost of owning a futures product is a lot higher,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the risk of underperforming the actual asset is high.\u201d\n\nFor example, while the price of bitcoin has increased by 62% so far this year, the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF has returned less than 32%.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think an ethereum futures [ETF] approval is much of a watershed moment,\u201d Alfred said. \u201cIf anything, it shows how backwards-thinking the SEC is on this.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s note: This story was updated to reflect the temporary spending bill passed on Saturday by Congress."

        "content": "How Much Ethereum is There?: Exploring the Circulating and Total Supply\n\nAs the popularity of Ethereum continues to soar, many enthusiasts are curious about the supply of this cryptocurrency.\n\nHow many Ethereum are in circulation? What is the total amount of Ethereum available?\n\nIn this comprehensive guide, we will delve into the intricacies of Ethereum\u2019s supply, its unique economic model, and the future prospects of this groundbreaking blockchain platform.\n\nAlso read: Will Ethereum Recover?\n\nSource: MARCA\n\nUnderstanding Ethereum: An Overview\n\nBefore we dive into the details of ETH supply, let\u2019s first establish a basic understanding of this revolutionary blockchain platform.\n\nCreated by the visionary developer Vitalik Buterin, ETH is not just a digital currency but a robust blockchain that enables users to execute smart contracts and build decentralized applications (DApps).\n\nUnlike Bitcoin, which primarily serves as a digital currency, ETH capabilities extend far beyond simple transactions.\n\nAt the heart of Ethereum lies the ETH Virtual Machine (EVM), a digital machine that allows code execution on the blockchain.\n\nThis code consists of smart contracts, which are self-executing agreements with predefined terms and conditions.\n\nThese smart contracts enable various applications, from decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to supply chain management and decentralized social networks.\n\nHow Many Ethereum Are There in Circulation?\n\nWhen it comes to the supply, it\u2019s important to note that ETH has adopted a different approach from Bitcoin.\n\nWhile Bitcoin has a maximum supply of 21 million coins, Ethereum\u2019s supply is not capped. This strategic decision by Vitalik Buterin aimed to create a network with infinite coins, allowing for greater flexibility and scalability.\n\nEthereum\u2019s initial distribution took place in a 2015 crowd sale, resulting in the mining of roughly 72 million coins in the Genesis block.\n\nThese coins were used for various purposes, including funding the platform\u2019s development and rewarding miners for validating transactions.\n\nSince then, the circulating supply has continued to increase.\n\nAs of April 2022, the circulating supply of ETH has exceeded 120 million coins. This means that over 120 million ETH tokens are currently in circulation and actively being traded on various cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Ethereum\u2019s mining process is notably faster than Bitcoin, producing a new block every 13-15 seconds.\n\nThis allows for a more rapid expansion of Ethereum\u2019s supply compared to Bitcoin.\n\nSource: Pixabay\n\nThe Total Supply of Ethereum\n\nWhile the circulating supply of ETH provides insights into the number of coins actively in circulation, the total supply of ETH encompasses all the coins that have been mined or will be mined in the future.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, ETH does not have a maximum supply, distinguishing it from Bitcoin\u2019s finite supply. This key difference has important implications for the economics and long-term prospects of ETH.\n\nBecause ETH doesn\u2019t have a capped supply, it\u2019s crucial to grasp how new coins enter the ecosystem.\n\nAlso read: US Excess Savings Depleted, Will it Impact Stocks And Crypto?\n\nEthereum proof-of-work (PoW)\n\nCurrently, ETH operates on a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism, similar to Bitcoin. Miners use computational power to solve complex mathematical problems and validate transactions on the Ethereum network.\n\nMiners receive newly minted ETH coins, called block rewards, as a reward for their efforts.\n\nHowever, ETH is in the process of transitioning from the PoW consensus mechanism to a proof-of-stake (PoS) model.\n\nThis upgrade, known as Ethereum 2.0, aims to enhance scalability, security, and sustainability. Under the PoS model, validators are selected to create new blocks and validate transactions based on the number of Ethereum tokens they hold and are willing to \u201cstake\u201d as collateral.\n\nThe shift to PoS will have significant implications for the supply of ETH. Unlike PoW, where mining constantly mints new coins, PoS doesn\u2019t create new coins as block rewards.\n\nInstead, users of the Ethereum network reward validators with transaction fees.\n\nThis change in the incentive structure may lead to a reduction in the rate of Ethereum supply growth over time.\n\nThe Impact of ETH Upgrades on Supply\n\nThe transition to Ethereum 2.0 and the PoS consensus mechanism has sparked much speculation about the future supply of Ethereum.\n\nExperts predict slower supply growth due to no block rewards, possibly causing ETH price deflationary pressure.\n\nEIP-1559, Ethereum\u2019s recent upgrade, burns part of transaction fees paid on the network.\n\nThis burning of coins reduces the overall supply of ETH, further contributing to potential deflationary effects. The upgrade also aims to improve the user experience by making transaction fees more predictable and efficient.\n\nThese upgrades will affect supply, but they\u2019re ongoing, and their full effects remain unseen.\n\nHowever, they represent significant milestones in Ethereum\u2019s evolution and demonstrate the platform\u2019s commitment to scalability, sustainability, and innovation.\n\nThe Future of Ethereum\u2019s Supply\n\nAs Ethereum continues to evolve and adapt to the changing landscape of blockchain technology, the future of its supply remains uncertain.\n\nEthereum\u2019s supply surpasses 120 million, but upgrades and PoS could make it more controlled and deflationary.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that the supply of Ethereum is not the sole determinant of its value.\n\nEthereum\u2019s price relies on its demand for decentralized apps and diverse uses, making demand a key factor.\n\nEthereum leads in DeFi, NFTs, and innovation, attracting users and investors with its strong value proposition.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the supply of ETH is a dynamic and ever-evolving aspect of this groundbreaking blockchain platform.\n\nWhile Ethereum\u2019s supply is not capped like Bitcoin, the ongoing upgrades and transition to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism may have significant implications for its future supply growth.\n\nAs ETH continues to revolutionize the world of decentralized applications and smart contracts, its supply dynamics will undoubtedly play a crucial role in shaping its long-term success."

        "content": "Ethereum sharding promises to scale the Ethereum network significantly.\n\nProto-danksharding, the first upgrade in the sharding roadmap, introduces a new concept called blobs.\n\nThis article explains what blobs are and how they improve Ethereum\u2019s scalability.\n\nSeveral years later, scalability remains a major pain point for the Ethereum network. Multiple solutions have been proposed to solve this problem, including sharding the network.\n\nSharding involves splitting the Ethereum network into smaller units that act as smaller blockchains secured by a rotating set of validators, lightening the cost of storing data on the blockchain. While having the potential to improve the scalability of the network exponentially, sharding requires multiple complex upgrades, which can be risky if done all at once.\n\nEnter proto-danksharding, also known as EIP-4844. Proto-danksharding introduces most of the changes needed for actual sharding without sharding the network. The core part of this upgrade introduces a new concept called blobs, from which the alternative name Shard Blob Transactions is derived. In this article, DailyCoin explores blobs and how they help scale the Ethereum network.\n\nWhat Is an Ethereum Blob?\n\nBlobs are inexpensive and temporary memory carrying data about transactions, called blob-carrying transactions. These blobs are designed to make the verification of these transactions more efficient.\n\nInstead of verifying each transaction in the block, the network will only have to confirm that the blob attached to the block carries the correct data. The transactions in these blob-carrying blocks will typically be related to Layer 2 networks, like Optimism, which stores data on Ethereum to share in its security guarantees. The temporary nature of these blobs ensures that they do not perpetually occupy space on the Ethereum network.\n\nWhat Does This Mean for Ethereum Scalability?\n\nMost of the fees on Layer 2 networks go to storing data on Ethereum. However, with blobs, the amount of work necessary to keep this data on the Ethereum network is significantly reduced, allowing faster processing and cheaper costs.\n\nWith the implementation of EIP-4844, two different fee marketplaces will be created, one for Layer 1 execution and another for blobs, as the blob data does not fit into the current Ethereum fee market. While the additional fee market will work like the current fee market in line with EIP-1559, the separation means that congestion on the Ethereum network will not affect fees for blobs, allowing for low fees even during peak network congestion.\n\nThe proto-danksharding upgrade, which will introduce blobs, was previously expected later this year with Dencun. But, in a recent call, core developers highlighted that they might be forced to delay the Dencun upgrade till 2024. Following the implementation of EIP-4844 on the Ethereum network, Layer 2 networks will also have to carry out upgrades to support blobs.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nEthereum Layer 2 users will feel the most significant effect of introducing blobs.\n\nLayer 2 networks must still implement separate upgrades to support the new feature.\n\nDevelopers assert that full sharding will take years.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nEthereum\u2019s scalability concerns have long served as a severe bottleneck. Introducing blobs with EIP-4844 takes the network closer to full sharding, which promises to scale the network exponentially while immediately bringing down costs on Layer 2s.\n\nRead this to learn more about Ethereum\u2019s Dencun upgrade:\n\nEthereum\u2019s Next Major Upgrade Likely to Be Delayed: Core Devs\n\n\n\nWorried about the imminent government shutdown.

Trading will begin in the coming weeks, Coinbase said in a blog post announcing the Bermuda news.\n\n\u201cWe chose to build our business and become a public company in the U.S. believing that the U.S. should be at the forefront of efforts to update our financial system,\u201d wrote the exchange.\n\nCoinbase\u2019s move to open up its international exchange to small investors is the latest in the company\u2019s ongoing efforts to expand its footprint beyond the U.S. where it has faced growing regulatory scrutiny.\n\nFollowing the collapse of competing exchange FTX and the arrest of its now-disgraced CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, the Securities and Exchange Commission soon cracked down on a slew of high-profile crypto companies and founders, including Genesis, Gemini, Justin Sun, the crypto celebrity behind TRON, and Do Kwon, creator of the so-called stablecoin TerraUSD.\n\nIn March, Coinbase, which has long styled itself as the white knight of the crypto industry, revealed that it has also become the target of impending SEC litigation after it received a so-called Wells Notice, which informs companies that they are the targets of soon-to-be litigation.\n\nShortly after, the U.S.-based exchange, headed by CEO Brian Armstrong, announced that it had received regulatory approval in Bermuda to operate an offshore exchange, and in May, the publicly traded company unveiled Coinbase International Exchange for the use of institutional investors.\n\nThe SEC eventually filed an outright lawsuit against Coinbase in June, but that hasn\u2019t stopped billions of dollars of crypto from flowing through both its domestic and offshore entities.

The asset has recently seen a significant rebound, raising eyebrows and hopes alike. While the exact numbers cannot be obtained at this moment, general sentiment around Ethereum is turning bullish.\n\nAccording to recent data, ETH is priced at $1,619.41, with a 1.79% increase, hinting at a positive momentum shift. This rebound is particularly noticeable as ETH managed to break through the 21-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), a crucial technical indicator. Although the market remains unpredictable and there is a possibility for ETH to experience a downturn, this rapid growth spurt is a positive signal. It hints at the potential recovery of this widely used network, stirring optimism among investors.\n\nHowever, it is crucial to approach this with a balanced perspective. While the recent uptick is undoubtedly a positive sign, it does not entirely rule out the possibility of a downturn. The crypto market is notoriously volatile, and Ethereum is no exception to this rule.\n\nWhat makes this rebound particularly noteworthy is its timing. Ethereum's network is the most utilized in the crypto space, serving as the backbone for countless decentralized applications and smart contracts. A resurgence in Ethereum's price could signify a broader recovery of the crypto market, given its integral role in the ecosystem.\n\nIn summary, Ethereum's recent price performance is a glimmer of optimism in a market that has been craving good news. The breakthrough of the 21 EMA is a positive technical indicator, but it is essential to remain cautious. The asset could still experience setbacks, but its rapid growth is a sign that the most used network in the crypto space might be waking up from its slumber.\n\nShiba Inu trying to break through\n\nIn recent days, Shiba Inu (SHIB) has showcased a resilient stride toward reclaiming its position in the market, endeavoring to breach what once was a support level. A mere two days ago, the asset encountered a setback, dipping below the trendline support level, which, to many, signaled a potential acceleration of its fall.\n\nHowever, the latest market data suggests that Shiba Inu is still aiming for a prominent move upward.\n\nThe descent below the trendline was a blow to SHIB, but the subsequent activity brings a silver lining. The real-time price data unfolds a narrative of mild resurgence, but whether this is a harbinger of a bullish trend or a temporary respite remains under scrutiny.\n\nA close inspection of the price action reveals a skirmish between the bulls and bears at the former support level, now a resistance point. The tug of war underlines the crucial phase SHIB is traversing, with every tick potentially altering the course. The fervent community, undeterred by the recent slump, rallies behind initiatives aimed at propelling SHIB back to favorable waters.\n\nCrypto under DXY's pressure\n\nThe rising tide of the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) is casting long shadows over the cryptocurrency market, signaling a disquieting phase in market dynamics. This growth of the dollar, often seen as a refuge during turbulent times, underscores the tumult currently besieging the crypto sphere.\n\nA deep dive into real-time data reveals a stark contrast in the market's pulse. The dollar's ascendancy coincides with a discernible tremor running through the crypto market's spine. Each uptick in the DXY seemingly douses the fiery allure of cryptocurrencies, painting a picture of a market at a crossroads. The dwindling liquidity coupled with reduced volatility is morphing into a repellent, shooing away investors who once flocked to the crypto market in search of lucrative ventures.\n\nThe narrative spun by the growing strength of the dollar is not just a tale of two markets but a reflection of global economic shifts. As traditional and digital financial realms intertwine, the repercussions of movements in one echo in the other. The dollar's current trajectory is a glaring sign of the crypto market's tribulations, further fueled by a cocktail of regulatory uncertainties and market sentiment swayed by macroeconomic winds."

        "content": "Ethereum price is attempting a fresh increase above $1,620 against the US Dollar. ETH must settle above $1,620 and $1,650 to start a decent increase.\n\nEthereum is attempting a recovery wave above the $1,600 level.\n\nThe price is trading above $1,600 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere is a key bullish trend line forming with support near $1,600 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair could start a decent increase if there is a close above $1,620 and $1,650.\n\nEthereum Price Holds Ground\n\nEthereum\u2019s price remained well-supported above the $1,580 level. ETH formed a base above $1,600 and recently moved a few points higher, like Bitcoin.\n\nThere was a move above the $1,620 level but upsides were limited. A high was formed near $1,633 before there was a strong bearish reaction. The price trimmed most gains and revisited the $1,580 zone. A low is formed near $1,583 and the price is now rising.\n\nEthereum is trading above $1,600 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is also a key bullish trend line forming with support near $1,600 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.\n\nOn the upside, the price might face resistance near the $1,608 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $1,633 swing high to the $1,583 low. The next major resistance is $1,620. It is close to the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $1,633 swing high to the $1,583 low.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nA push above $1,620 might send Ether further higher in the coming sessions. The main hurdle is still near the $1,650 and $1,660 levels. If the bulls succeed in clearing the $1,660 hurdle, the price could start a decent increase toward the $1,720 resistance. Any more gains might open the doors for a move toward $1,800.\n\nAnother Drop in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $1,620 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,600 level and the trend line.\n\nThe next key support is $1,580, below which the price could test the $1,540 support. A downside break below the $1,540 support might spark strong bearish moves. In the stated case, there could be a drop toward the $1,450 level.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bearish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now above the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $1,580\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $1,620\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "The Interchain Foundation has revealed its 2024 roadmap for Cosmos, prioritizing blockchain modularity, interoperability, and attracting Ethereum ecosystem developers.\n\nThe Interchain Foundation, a non-profit with a mission to bolster the adoption of Cosmos, recently unveiled its roadmap for 2024. Their ambition is to redefine the landscape of what is popularly known as the \u201cinternet of blockchains.\u201d\n\nAt the core of this 50-page document lies Cosmos\u2019 commitment to blockchain modularity and interoperability, concepts that are fundamental to the network.\n\nThese underline Cosmos\u2019 aim to serve as a conduit, connecting various blockchain protocols, allowing seamless communication and transaction processes without necessitating token wrapping.\n\nThe emphasis on Ethereum(ETH) rollups reveals a clear intention: to cater to developers who have found layer-2 solutions restricting.\n\n1/ Unveiling the #IBC rebrand!\n\n\n\nRealigning the Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol to its core mission:\n\n\n\n\u2018\u2019Provide a universal framework for blockchains to communicate, laying the foundation for developers to build without boundaries.\u2019\u2019 pic.twitter.com/N4FHzTu6zY \u2014 Interchain Foundation (@interchain_io) September 28, 2023\n\nA pivotal element in Cosmos\u2019 strategy is its Inter-Blockchain Communication protocol (IBC).\n\nIn 2024, the primary goal of IBC is to integrate it with zero-knowledge and optimistic rollup frameworks, expanding its horizons further.\n\nAlongside, Cosmos\u2019 Software Developer Kit (SDK) emphasizes the platform\u2019s edge over Ethereum, particularly in terms of customizability.\n\nYou might also like: Noble and Celestia partner to introduce native Cosmos stablecoin\n\nThis distinct advantage is attributed to Cosmos\u2019 inherent flexibility, a byproduct of its modularity, which delineates blockchain functionalities.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s essential to note, as Cosmos SDK admits, that while their software is theoretically modular, practical application is somewhat challenging.\n\nMaria Gomez, Interchain Foundation\u2019s managing director, said Cosmos has found it challenging to appeal to developers, primarily due to the absence of a native token which could serve as a financial incentive.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Vitalik Buterin, for instance, presents roadmaps that, even if not realized, stir excitement and foster conversations.\n\nThis narrative-driven engagement is what Cosmos aspires to replicate with its 2024 roadmap. As Gomez puts it, they\u2019re aiming to capture developers\u2019 imaginations in a manner similar to Ethereum.\n\nData from Token Terminal reveals that there were 660 changes to the Cosmos Hub, the foundational blockchain of Cosmos, in September.\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "content": "It was only a year after the launch of the Ethereum mainnet that Nick Johnson began building the Ethereum Name Service, or ENS \u2014 a tool for assigning human-readable names to otherwise-complicated sequences of letters and numbers that describe Ethereum addresses.\n\n\u201cIt was one of the first projects I started working on at the Ethereum Foundation and then spun out to its own organization,\u201d he says, \u201cand we\u2019ve been building it ever since.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m incredibly impressed with what we\u2019ve achieved,\u201d he says, \u201cbut, you know, it\u2019s only the beginning of what we\u2019re working on.\u201d\n\nOn the 0xResearch podcast (Spotify/Apple), Johnson details his vision for the future of the service, with plans to make the service \u201ceven more useful\u201d with layer-2 support, an improved user interface and greater functionality.\n\nOne priority, Johnson says, is that a user should expect to be able to enter an ENS name anywhere that an ether (ETH) address can be entered. A user should \u201cbe surprised when it isn\u2019t supported rather than having to check that it is,\u201d he says. \u201cI think we\u2019re close, but not there yet for that.\u201d\n\nAnother crucial element of the vision involves increasing transparency and lowering costs. \u201cThat\u2019s our big focus at the moment.\u201d\n\nThis work involves rolling out layer-2s for low-cost registrations, Johnson explains, as well as adding enhancements that make it easier for users to issue subnames. These improvements would enable organizations like Coinbase to use either a layer-2 or \u201chost names entirely off-chain.\u201d\n\nWith these improvements, name owners would have greater control over the \u201ctrust model\u201d of how their names and subdomains are managed, Johnson says. \u201cWe\u2019re focusing on that mostly at the moment by building tooling that makes it easier for people to work on [layer-2],\u201d he says.\n\nDo you know Google\u2019s IP address?\n\nJohnson adds that while it\u2019s been possible to host names on layer-2 for more than a year, it needs to be easier to set up. \u201cWhat\u2019s been missing is the easy plug and play tooling that makes it trivial for someone to do that,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cAt the moment, the integration overhead is a bit higher,\u201d he admits. \u201cSo that\u2019s our main focus on the back end. And then on the front end, it\u2019s all corresponding work to make the usability meet the feature set on the back end.\u201d\n\nJohnson says the company has been speaking to wallet providers to enable the naming of wallets, \u201cwhich has always been a long term vision of mine.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe wallet sign-up flow should include naming the wallet,\u201d he says. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have to even know or care what your Ethereum address is any more than you do what your IP address is.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I asked you what Google\u2019s IP address was, you couldn\u2019t tell me because there\u2019s no reason you would know that \u2014 and there\u2019s no reason you would want to know that,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd IP addresses are a lot shorter than Ethereum addresses. They\u2019re a lot easier to memorize.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe same degree of usability ought to apply to Ethereum, to crypto in general.\u201d\n\nSetting up a wallet should involve picking a name, Johnson says, that can be pseudonymous and disconnected from other wallets to ensure privacy. \u201cUltimately, we create accounts because we want to transact with them,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cAt some point, that involves giving that address to someone else or some third party or site or whatever, and this just makes that an order of magnitude easier.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "The launch of Ethereum futures ETFs heralds cautious optimism in the crypto world. Here is everything you need to know.\n\nThe U.S. financial markets are buzzing with excitement as, for the first time in the country, an Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded fund (ETF) stands on the brink of introduction.\n\nOn September 28, asset management company VanEck dropped a significant announcement, confirming the debut of their VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF (EFUT). Investors can expect to see EFUT shares listed on the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE), with the listing date still kept under wraps by VanEck.\n\nBut here\u2019s the twist. While Ethereum futures ETFs like EFUT are seeing the green light, their counterparts that focus on actual cryptocurrencies, known as crypto spot ETFs, are still stuck at the regulatory crossroads.\n\nThe Ethereum ETF by VanEck is just the tip of the iceberg, leading a convoy of 14 other proposals knocking on the SEC\u2019s door, each hoping to launch their version of this product.\n\nWhat does this all mean for investors? Here is everything you need to know about Ethereum ETFs.\n\nYou might also like: What is Bitcoin ETF and which companies applied for it in the US?\n\nEthereum ETFs and their types\n\nAn ETF is a type of investment fund that\u2019s traded on stock exchanges, similar to individual stocks. Essentially, it\u2019s a basket of assets \u2013 whether that\u2019s stocks, commodities, or other investment types \u2013 that offers diversification and accessibility to investors.\n\nTaking that concept into the realm of cryptocurrency, an Ethereum ETF mirrors the behavior of Ethereum. By purchasing Ethereum ETF shares, investors get exposure to Ethereum\u2019s price fluctuations without actually owning ETH coins.\n\nThere are two kinds of Ethereum ETFs: spot and future.\n\nSpot ETFs\n\nSpot ETFs are essentially funds that directly purchase and hold Ethereum tokens. When you buy a share of a Spot ETF, you\u2019re buying a piece of an actual Ethereum token, but it\u2019s the fund that holds it for you.\n\nKey characteristics\n\nDirect exposure : With spot ETFs, your investment\u2019s value moves directly with the price of Ether. When Ethereum\u2019s price goes up, so does the value of your investment, and vice versa.\n\n\n\n: With spot ETFs, your investment\u2019s value moves directly with the price of Ether. When Ethereum\u2019s price goes up, so does the value of your investment, and vice versa. Storage : Unlike individual investors in cryptocurrency who need to manage digital wallets and remember cryptographic keys, spot ETF investors don\u2019t have to deal with these technicalities. The ETF handles the storage and security of the Ethereum tokens.\n\n\n\n: Unlike individual investors in cryptocurrency who need to manage digital wallets and remember cryptographic keys, spot ETF investors don\u2019t have to deal with these technicalities. The ETF handles the storage and security of the Ethereum tokens. Liquidity management: Because these funds hold the actual Ethereum cryptocurrency (ETH), managing the ability to quickly buy or sell can sometimes be more complex, especially in volatile markets.\n\nFutures ETFs\n\nFutures ETFs are a bit different. They don\u2019t buy or hold Ethereum directly. Instead, they invest in futures contracts. These are agreements to buy or sell Ethereum at a set price on a certain future date. It\u2019s like agreeing today on the price for something you\u2019ll buy or sell later.\n\nKey characteristics\n\nIndirect exposure : Futures ETFs are influenced by both the current price of Ethereum and predictions about its future price.\n\n\n\n: Futures ETFs are influenced by both the current price of Ethereum and predictions about its future price. No physical handling : These ETFs deal with contracts about Ethereum, not the cryptocurrency itself. This means the funds don\u2019t have to manage the storage or security of actual Ethereum tokens.\n\n\n\n: These ETFs deal with contracts about Ethereum, not the cryptocurrency itself. This means the funds don\u2019t have to manage the storage or security of actual Ethereum tokens. Rolling contracts: Futures contracts have expiration dates. So, when one contract\u2019s end date approaches, the ETF\u2019s managers have to replace it (or \u201croll it over\u201d) with a new contract. This process can influence the ETF\u2019s returns, especially if future prices are significantly different from current ones.\n\nPros and cons of ETH ETFs\n\nWhile Ethereum ETFs offer some exciting advantages, they come with their set of challenges.\n\nAdvantages of Ethereum ETFs\n\nDiversification: Ethereum ETFs are an excellent tool for those looking to broaden their investment portfolio. By providing exposure to Ethereum\u2019s price performance, these ETFs can act as a hedge, potentially mitigating risks inherent in other asset classes.\n\nRegulatory compliance: Ethereum ETFs operate under established financial regulations, which can be a huge confidence booster. It\u2019s a way of ensuring you\u2019re not diving into murky waters.\n\nLiquidity: Ethereum ETFs enjoy the advantage of being traded on well-established stock exchanges. This means investors can easily buy or sell their shares, capitalizing on market trends and ensuring ease of entry and exit.\n\nDisadvantages of Ethereum ETFs\n\nCounterparty risk: Every investment has risks. With Ethereum ETFs, there\u2019s the looming shadow of issuer credit risk. If the entity replicating Ethereum\u2019s price movements falters, it could spell trouble for the ETF\u2019s performance.\n\nLimited control: When you invest in an Ethereum ETF, you\u2019re placing trust in the fund manager\u2019s hands. Unlike direct investments, where you control your destiny, here, you ride shotgun, relying on the manager\u2019s expertise and decisions.\n\nFees: While convenience is great, it comes at a price. Management fees can eat into your returns over time. It\u2019s crucial to weigh the costs against the potential benefits.\n\nMarket dynamics: Sometimes, the ETF\u2019s performance might not exactly mirror Ethereum\u2019s market moves. Discrepancies can arise due to a range of factors, potentially affecting returns.\n\nYou might also like: U.S. government shutdown looms, creating uncertainty in crypto market\n\nHow Ethereum ETFs could impact the crypto market?\n\nEthereum ETFs are a relatively new addition to the financial ecosystem, and understanding their potential impact on the crypto market requires a deeper examination, juxtaposing the traditional ETF dynamics with the nuances of the crypto landscape.\n\nETFs\u2019 unique structure, as pointed out by BlackRock, offers dual liquidity \u2013 from the primary market of underlying assets and the secondary on-exchange trades. Translating this to Ethereum ETFs, they could amplify the liquidity of Ethereum, making it more accessible to a wider range of investors.\n\nBut liquidity is just the start. While traditional ETFs have proven not to be major influencers of market direction, Ethereum ETFs operate in a different ecosystem. The crypto market is more volatile and less mature than traditional markets. As a result, large inflows or outflows from Ethereum ETFs might have more pronounced effects on Ethereum\u2019s price, at least in the short term.\n\nOne of the principal benefits ETFs bring to traditional markets is stability. With their ability to act as \u201cshock absorbers\u201d during volatile sessions, Ethereum ETFs could introduce a new level of stability to the crypto sector, making it more resilient to sudden market swings.\n\nLastly, Ethereum ETFs\u2019 potential role in price discovery cannot be understated. The crypto market could benefit from the reflective nature of ETFs, offering clearer indications of genuine investor sentiment.\n\nThis becomes particularly significant when considering the scale of the global ETF market, which, at over $10 trillion as of June 2023, towers over the $1 trillion crypto market where Ethereum holds a substantial $200 billion share. Thus, the introduction of Ethereum ETFs can be transformative and far-reaching, influencing not just its volatility but also propelling crypto into the mainstream.\n\nThe road ahead\n\nThe green signal for the Ethereum futures ETF has sent ripples of positive sentiment throughout the crypto world. This sentiment is evident in the broader market\u2019s response, as many assets trade in the green after a period of dormancy.\n\nHowever, this newfound optimism should be approached with a measured mindset. The world of ETFs, though promising, is not devoid of risks. Especially in the crypto domain, where volatility is a given, sudden market corrections can be swift and severe.\n\nIn line with this, a golden rule in investment remains timeless: never commit more funds than you can afford to lose. As the market continues to evolve, cautious optimism should be your guiding principle.\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "content": "Next month, Buenos Aires will begin rolling out a blockchain-based and open-source digital identity protocol, QuarkID, in an effort to streamline citizen access to public services.\n\nBuenos Aires citizens will be able to download the protocol\u2019s native wallet to claim essential personal documents such as birth and marriage certificates, according to a statement on Wednesday.\n\nThe move is being touted as a \u201cfirst\u201d in Latin America, in collaboration with on-chain digital identity solutions firm Extrimian and Matter Labs, the company behind Ethereum layer-2 blockchain zkSync Era.\n\nQuarkID\u2019s service intends to operate on the principle of self-sovereignty, allowing individuals complete control over their personal data. While documentation will initially be limited, the Buenos Aires government is planning a phased introduction of various official credentials.\n\nStarting in November, citizens will be able to access proof of income and academic attendance certificates \u2014 key documents for benefits claims \u2014 within their digital wallets.\n\nFor the initial rollout, Buenos Aires citizens will need to complete the existing biometric know-your-customer procedures for identity verification to create a QuarkID wallet.\n\nThe full roadmap for QuarkID, set to be released by year-end, aims to extend the service to over 2.5 million users by expanding the list of available credentials, per the statement.\n\nDiego Fernandez, Secretary of Innovation of the Buenos Aires City Government, described the initiative as a digital trust framework serving as a \u201cpublic good.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith this development, Buenos Aires becomes the first city in Latin America and one of the first in the world to integrate and promote this new technology,\u201d he said.\n\nBuilt atop Matter Labs\u2019 tech stack, the QuarkID wallet takes advantage of zkSync Era\u2019s blockchain framework for consolidated document storage. ZkSync Era serves as the settlement layer for the QuarkID platform, ensuring the proper ownership of each stored document.\n\nAdoption incoming?\n\nBuilding on prior efforts since 2022, the Secretariat of Innovation and Digital Transformation in Buenos Aires has been working with Extrimian and other tech companies, including IOV Labs, OScity and Xcapit, as well as the local community.\n\nTogether, they are aiming to advance the development decentralized digital identity, seeking to evolve the current paradigm of e-government services across Latin America.\n\nThe region itself is fast becoming a hotbed for blockchain use case adoption, demonstrating a willingness to employ censorship-resistant technologies for official government business and record keeping.\n\nCitizens across the region are also increasingly warming to the idea of transacting using crypto, ever since El Salvador became the first nation in the world to adopt bitcoin (BTC) as an official form of currency, alongside the US dollar, in 2021.\n\nA Ripple survey last year found that 74% of Latin Americans are more likely to transact with businesses that accept crypto, compared with just 41% of Europeans. A separate survey by Mastercard in June of that year found more than half of Latin Americans reported having already paid for goods and services using digital assets.\n\nChainalysis\u2019 latest figures from its Global Crypto Adoption Index show Brazil, Mexico and Argentina rank within the top 20 countries globally, besting the likes of Japan and Bangladesh.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "The SEC has approved asset manager Valkyrie to begin trading Ether futures.\n\nThe regulator moved to delay its decision on a spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nA potential government shutdown may impact ETF approvals, analysts said.\n\nHappy Friday!\n\nUS investors now have access to Ether futures through an exchange traded fund. Asset manager Valkyrie was approved to add Ethereum futures to its existing Bitcoin ETF. The move comes as analysts predict pending Ether futures ETFs will be given the green light imminently.\n\nHere\u2019s why that matters.\n\nGreen lights\n\nValkyrie will begin to add Ether futures to its existing Bitcoin strategy ETF on Friday. The asset manager will allocate 10% of its fund to Ether initially, increasing this to 50% on Monday.\n\nStay ahead of the game with our weekly newsletters Subscribe\n\nThe decision is expected to be quickly followed by approval of a host of Ether futures ETFs.\n\nVanEck, another asset manager vying for approval, released a video Thursday promoting its Ether futures ETF, which it said was \u201ccoming soon.\u201d\n\nEthereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalisation, has gained 2.7% since Thursday.\n\nETFs offer investors an affordable and convenient way to bet on the performance of stocks, commodities, and cryptocurrencies. They also tend to be highly liquid.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nThe products are therefore expected to bring increased investment to the sector, although futures products are not as keenly sought after as are spot ones.\n\nFutures contracts give investors a chance to speculate on what the price of an asset will be in a few months time.\n\nEther futures ETFs have been sought out by the crypto industry to allow investors to gain exposure to crypto assets without going through the difficulty of setting up crypto-specific infrastructure, such as wallets.\n\nWhile Bitcoin futures ETFs have been available in the US for some time, an ETF that invests in spot Bitcoin has yet to be approved by the SEC.\n\nThe agency recently delayed its decisions on applications from Cathie Wood\u2019s ARK Invest and fund manager Global X. Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst James Seyffart stated that he expected all remaining applications to be delayed before an expected government shutdown on October 1.\n\nThis would push back the deadline for most Bitcoin spot ETF applications to January \u2014 except for Global X\u2019s application, which is set for review in November.\n\nEther futures ETF approvals may also have been accelerated to get in ahead of the shutdown, according to Eric Balchunas, an ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence.\n\nA US appeals court ruled that the SEC erred by denying Grayscale\u2019s application for such an offering. That decision could pave the way for a spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nMike Novogratz, founder of crypto trading platform Galaxy Digital, recently said the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF is a matter of \u201cwhen, not if.\u201d\n\nCrypto market movers\n\nBitcoin flirted with levels around $27,000 after it gained 2% since Thursday.\n\nEthereum jumped 3.3% as it traded around $1,670.\n\nSolana\u2019s SOL and Ripple\u2019s XRP rallied overnight, up 5.5% and 7.4% respectively.\n\nWhat we\u2019re reading\n\nAdam Morgan McCarthy is DL News\u2019 London-based Markets Correspondent.

        "content": "Cosmos, a blockchain where developers can create custom chains that interconnect and communicate, has revealed its roadmap for 2024. According to an X post on September 25, the roadmap centers on increasing modularity, improving the developer experience, addressing \u201ctechnical debt,\u201d and driving user adoption. With this, Cosmos developers plan to take on the more established platform, Ethereum.\n\nAt the heart of Cosmos are features such as Tendermint, a consensus system that anchors blockchains such as the BNB Chain; Cosmos SDK, a software developer kit that allows coders to build fluid and custom blockchains; and the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC), from where all deployed custom Cosmos chains can connect and communicate, effectively driving interoperability.\n\nCosmos Wants To Repay The Technical Debt And Make Its SDK More Modular\n\nIn 2024, reading from the roadmap, Cosmos aims to solidify its position by attracting developers from competing platforms as they repay the \u201ctechnical debt.\u201d In app development, technical debt leads to extra work and can be caused by resource constraints and shifting code requirements.\n\nCosmos will expand its developer base to repay this debt and make the Cosmos SDK more modular. Although the team claims the SDK has been modular in theory, swapping and modifications have made practical implementation more challenging.\n\nTherefore, to tackle these challenges, the work already done on Cosmos SDK will continue into 2024. Then, the goal will be to make the kit more modular at the core. This will make it more adaptable and flexible, meeting developer requirements.\n\nEthereum Is Still Dominant\n\nIt is yet to be seen whether this will be achievable in 2024 and whether Cosmos will grow as dominant as Ethereum. Currently, Ethereum is the leading smart contract platform, based on its market cap and the total value locked (TVL) in decentralized finance (DeFi). Additionally, its ecosystem of layer-2s has been increasing, with more protocols and blockchains connecting to Ethereum to take advantage of the network\u2019s pioneering activity.\n\nDeFiLlama data on September 29 shows that all the top 10 bridges are connected to Ethereum. To illustrate, Stargate\u2013by Cosmos, is connected to Ethereum and multiple blockchains, including Avalanche and the BNB Chain.\n\nBesides Stargate, other bridges are Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible and predominantly connect to Ethereum layer-2s and Polygon, the sidechain. For example, the zkSync Era, Base, Arbitrum, Polygon, and the Optimism Gateway, are plugged into Ethereum. Cumulatively, these bridges move millions of dollars worth of tokens to and from Ethereum at any instance.\n\nFeature image from Canva, chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "What happened\n\nThursday was a fine day for cryptocurrencies nearly across the board, with the sector's leaders driving the rally. No. 1 and No. 2 -- respectively, Bitcoin (BTC -2.07%) and Ethereum (ETH -0.29%) -- were trading around 3% higher over the 24 hours preceding late afternoon.\n\nAs the top dogs go, the remaining pack typically follows, so a host of other coins, tokens, and related assets also moved higher, albeit at different paces. Fellow crypto Aave (AAVE 3.89%) was enjoying a nearly 9% surge, while miner Riot Platforms (RIOT -9.78%) was defying gravity at a nearly 5% clip.\n\nSo what\n\nThe trajectory of cryptocurrencies (and stocks closely tied to them, like Riot Platforms) frequently depends on the performance of low-risk assets. When the latter start to weaken, this emboldens certain investors to stack up on the riskier goodies, and coins and tokens are still considered to be model high-risk plays.\n\nOn Thursday, those safe havens weren't looking infallible. The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury bond, considered by many to be the most secure investment on the scene, weakened from a 16-year high on Thursday.\n\nMeanwhile, everybody's favorite fossil fuel investment, crude oil, also saw a price retreat (in its case, from year-to-date highs). Finally, the reserve currency of this planet (the U.S. dollar) lost a bit of its value too.\n\nThese weren't the only factors driving Bitcoin, Ethereum, and their many relatives higher on the day.\n\nIn a post on X (formerly Twitter) late Wednesday, Bloomberg reporter Eric Balchunas wrote that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is making moves to accelerate the rollout of certain Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Specifically, according to Balchunas, the SEC has requested ETF filers to update their applications in an effort to get those instruments up and running for trading next week.\n\nWhile this apparently only concerns Ethereum ETFs, it's easy to imagine that if the regulator is ready to turn on the light for that crypto, it's ready to do so for a host of other coins and tokens. There still is much crypto resistance in official corners -- particularly at the SEC, ahem -- but at least to some degree, it seems to be melting a bit.\n\nNow what\n\nOther factors playing in the background are also contributing to the current crypto bullishness. The equity market continues to be generally frothy, which not only fuels optimism for riskier assets but also gets investors to consider non-stock plays like cryptocurrencies. Interest rates remain relatively high and look set to stay that way for some time or even rise. So, we likely haven't seen the last good day for coins and tokens."

        "content": "Could bullish Ethereum news related to the launch of an ETH futures ETF be the catalyst that triggers a massive breakout of a nearly 16-month long ascending triangle pattern?\n\nIf the pattern is valid, the target is roughly $4,000 per ETH and a revisit to former all-time highs from the last bull market.\n\nVanEck Announces ETH Futures ETF\n\nGlobal asset manager VanEck, known best for its ETFs and Mutual Funds, today revealed the upcoming launch of the VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF (ETUF).\n\nETUF will be \u201can actively managed ETF designed to seek capital appreciation by investing in Ether (ETH) futures contracts.\u201d\n\nRather than investing in spot ETH, the Fund will trade Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) ETH futures, and will be managed by the firm\u2019s Head of Active Trading, Greg Krenzer.\n\nETUF will trade on CBOE alongside VanEck\u2019s Bitcoin Strategy ETF (XBTF). And although its inception of November 15, 2021 marked the end of the bull market in crypto, the introduction of Ethereum futures has the potential to kickstart the next bull run.\n\nEther's target is $4,000 based on the measure rule | ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nEthereum News Catalyst Could Trigger Ascending Triangle Breakout\n\nShow me the chart and I\u2019ll tell you the news, is a famous quote from the late Bernard Baruch. The message reflects the fact that the largest technical moves tend to coincide with a news catalyst and vice-versa.\n\nEssentially, the a bullish chart pattern could possibly appear before positive news \u2013 such as the launch of an ETH futures ETF \u2013 while the news itself is the catalyst for a strong breakout.\n\nThis is precisely what appears to be brewing in ETHUSD charts since June of 2022. Unlike Bitcoin which put in a bottom late in 2022, Ethereum found support about halfway through the year. Since then, Ether has consistently made higher lows, forming a potential ascending triangle chart pattern.\n\nNow, the ascending triangle pattern is nearing the two-thirds point from its apex. This increases the chances of a breakout occurring as an Ethereum futures ETF gets launched have increased significantly. All that\u2019s required is a breakout above $2,000 per ETH on higher than normal volume. Based on the measure rules, reaching the target objective could push prices to over $4,000.\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nDecentralization is the holy grail of blockchain buzzwords.\n\nAlthough it is endlessly touted by crypto advocates far and wide, another hack on the weekend unveiled a not-so-decentralized reality, reviving the industry\u2019s oldest debate.\n\nWhat does decentralization really mean?\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe are using the word for adoption rather than actual decentralization,\u201d says Sergey Nazarov, the co-founder of the decentralized oracle network Chainlink.\n\nFor Nazarov, who alluded to the collapse of Celsius, Voyager, FTX, and most recently Mixin Network as examples of a \u201cdecentralization theater,\u201d the buzzword is mostly being used \u201cto attract capital.\u201d\n\nChainlink\u2019s co-founder told Decrypt he sees only a handful of projects as meaningfully decentralized, naming only Chainlink, Bitcoin, and Ethereum.\n\nThe latter, it\u2019s important to point out, is going through its own set of centralization problems, with the so-called Lido Finance cartel posing an existential threat to the network.\n\nFor Nazarov, though, decentralization is a \u201csecurity mechanism.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHe pointed to Chainlink\u2019s four-year record without hacks, \u201cwhile transferring $8.5 trillion in value,\u201d as a case in point. \u201cSystems that are decentralized remain secure,\u201d he said.\n\nChainlink has not been exempt from its own criticism regarding centralization, however. The price oracle has a 4-of-9 multi-signature access that could have unforeseen\u2013and undesired\u2013effects in the DeFi space.\n\nDeFi security expert Chris Blec spoke to Decrypt about his mounting concerns regarding the multi-sig.\n\nFor him, the issue isn\u2019t necessarily the number of signers, but rather that the administrative access exists, and that the industry doesn\u2019t know who operates them.\n\n\u201cThe fact that these signers can \u2018nuke\u2019 the price of Ethereum is a problem,\u201d he said. And Blec pointed to the large number of DeFi protocols currently using Chainlink\u2019s price feeds which could also see issues were the multi-sig to be compromised.\n\nMat\u00edas Barrios, a security researcher for Solana, thinks the issue isn\u2019t necessarily the multi-sig, but rather key management. \u201cYou can have a 19/20 but if the keys aren\u2019t well managed, it won\u2019t be more secure than a 2/9,\u201d he said.\n\nEven so, Blec places the emphasis on what he calls a lack of transparency. \u201cPeople need to be aware of the risks,\u201d he explained, especially those who put their life savings into the DeFi protocols feeding off Chainlink\u2019s feeds.\n\nAll that said, the DeFi security expert did claim that \u201cNobody has figured out how to feed prices without a centralized mechanism,\u201d not naming any competitors that might be working towards that goal.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHe also referred to the recently launched Chainlink Cross-chain Protocol (CCIP), as getting closer to achieving decentralization, although there is much work to be done.\n\nDecentralization: Apples and oranges\n\nDecentralization, however, expands beyond security. For others, it can even take on a more democratic hue.\n\nMat\u00edas Barrios, a security researcher for Solana, told Decrypt, that the concept is \u201cthe ability a system has to distribute voting power.\u201d For him, voting power can also mean \u201cexecution,\u201d in that no one person has the capability of censoring or allowing changes to occur.\n\nThat said, Barrios pointed to a reality that is sometimes easily overlooked: \u201cDecentralization is a spectrum.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am a massive believer in the decentralized spectrum idea,\u201d agrees Nazarov. However, he pointed to many chains as \u201cmasquerading\u201d their decentralized reality.\n\nOne such protocol, countering Nazarov\u2019s decentralization tag, is Ethereum. It has come under fire of late, due to the outsized footprint of Lido Finance and its staking pools.\n\nDanny Ryan, an Ethereum Foundation member, addressed these concerns and didn\u2019t hold back.\n\nRyan explained that Lido is short-circuiting the economics of the network by \u201cShoving a governance token owned by a bunch of VCs into the center of the protocol.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHe expanded on the presence of VCs in crypto, and how these pose systemic threats to overall decentralization. \u201cThe majority of token distributions these days are VC owned,\u201d he claimed, characterizing them as \u201cShitty re-instantiations of corporations on chain.\u201d\n\nBlec echoed these sentiments, and tacks on the outsized footprint that stablecoins have on the protocol. \u201cAny fork will be at the mercy of these products,\u201d he thinks, adding that if they don\u2019t approve, the network could implode.\n\nIf Ethereum goes through these types of threats, what\u2019s left for the rest of the industry?\n\nFor Nazarov, there are two ways to address the issues surrounding decentralization.\n\nFirst, \u201cwe need to end the buzzword cycle,\u201d and focus on building systems that offer proper security and reliability.\n\nThat\u2019s mainly for builders and companies in the space, however.\n\nChainlink\u2019s co-founder reckons there is a responsibility on the individual as well. \u201cWe need to become more educated consumers,\u201d he said.\n\nAs the crypto industry continues to battle the ongoing bear market, the decentralization debate is more alive than ever.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhether it is a means to better security systems or more democratic governance, is up for each individual, or entity, to discern.\n\nWhat is for sure, however, is that crypto seems to be falling short of its number one goal."

        "content": "Ethereum Developers Make Second Attempt to Launch Holesky Testnet After Previous Flop\n\nPixabay\n\nEthereum developers have relaunched the Holesky test network after a previous attempt earlier this month failed.\n\nOn Thursday, Ethereum devs relaunched Holesky in what appeared to be a successful process in the early hours of the livestream.\n\nA developer commented on the initial success recorded so far while another joked that there will not be a third build.\n\n\u201cIt looks like the launch is successful\u201d \u201cNot going to have to build a third one!\u201d\n\nIn crypto spaces, the digital asset community lauded the efforts put in place to usher in Holesky. X (formerly Twitter) user \u201c sassal.eth\u201d wrote : \u201cThe newest and largest Ethereum testnet by validator count, Holesky, is now live!\n\nKudos to all the people who worked on getting this launched.\u201d\n\nHolesky testnet was designed to aid the largest smart contract projects with a capacity greater than Ethereum\u2019s present test networks: Goerli and Sepolia.\n\nThe network is expected to have about 1.4 million validators, double the size of Ethereum, and will put an end to virtually all scaling issues present on the testnet.\n\nThe decision to postpone the launch after the glitch was due to the vital nature of the testnet for the future of the platform described as a solution that will live for years and will be important in the rollout of Dencun hardfork\n\nWhat happened?\n\nHoleskey was scheduled to launch on Sept 15 to mark the first anniversary of the Ethereum Merge which saw the network transition to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism getting rid of miners.\n\nThe event was highly anticipated as it was billed to eventually phase out the Goerli testnet by 2024. However, the process encountered hiccups just a few hours after it launched.\n\nDiederick Loerakker, an Ethereum researcher, narrated that the wrong data was imputed from parts of the Genesis files.\n\nSomeone put 0x686f77206d7563682069732074686520666973683f (\u201chow much is the fish?\u201d) as extra data in the EL Holesky genesis.json, and not in the CL genesis.ssz Misconfiguration, the network failed to launch.\n\nAlso, some other fork params in releases are rumored to mismatch too. Need to relaunch. Not an issue with network-size at least.\u201d\n\nBeaconchain.eth and other observers noted that despite the delay, no damage will be done as that is the whole point of a testnet.\n\nShould everything go as planned with Holesky, Ethereum is billed to widen the gap between competitors in the creation of decentralized applications (dApps) as the new testnet will attract huge projects with effective scalability."

Whereas Futures ETFs use futures contracts to speculate on the future price of the asset.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg\u2019s ETF experts, Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart, the SEC could approve an Ethereum future ETF as early as next week.\n\nBalchunas said that according to his sources, the SEC \u201cwants to accelerate the launch of Ether futures ETFs\u201d and has asked \u201cthe filers to update their docs by Friday\u201d to make an announcement by next week.\n\nThe rush is motivated by the potential U.S. government shutdown starting October 1, which will suspend government services and agencies like the SEC.\n\nThe Senate will hold another vote on its government spending bill today to decide whether a shutdown will take effect.\n\nCurrently, there are fourteen proposals pending with the SEC for an Ethereum futures ETF from firms like Bitwise, Grayscale, Valkyrie, and VanEck among others.\n\nAD\n\nAD"

        "title": "VanEck Prepares to Launch Ethereum Futures ETF (EFUT) - Business Wire",
        "content": "NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--VanEck today announced the upcoming launch of the VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF (EFUT), an actively managed ETF designed to seek capital appreciation by investing in Ether (ETH) futures contracts. EFUT does not invest in ETH or other digital assets directly.\n\nThe Fund will invest in standardized, cash-settled ETH futures contracts traded on commodity exchanges registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Currently, the only ETH futures the Fund intends to invest in are those traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.\n\nEFUT will be listed on CBOE and will be actively managed by Greg Krenzer, Head of Active Trading for VanEck. Mr. Krenzer joined the firm in 1994 and has more than two decades of experience trading in a host of asset categories, including the futures space.\n\nEFUT joins the VanEck Bitcoin Strategy ETF (XBTF) in providing futures-focused exposure to key digital assets. Like XBTF, EFUT is structured as a C-Corp., an approach that may provide a more efficient tax experience for long-term investors. XBTF does not invest in BTC or other digital assets directly.\n\nVanEck will be posting updates on EFUT on X (formerly Twitter): @vaneck_us.\n\nAbout VanEck\n\nVanEck has a history of looking beyond the financial markets to identify trends that are likely to create impactful investment opportunities. We were one of the first U.S. asset managers to offer investors access to international markets. This set the tone for the firm\u2019s drive to identify asset classes and trends \u2013 including gold investing in 1968, emerging markets in 1993, and exchange traded funds in 2006 \u2013 that subsequently shaped the investment management industry.\n\nToday, VanEck offers active and passive strategies with compelling exposures supported by well-designed investment processes. As of August 31, 2023, VanEck managed approximately $80.8B in assets, including mutual funds, ETFs and institutional accounts. The firm\u2019s capabilities range from core investment opportunities to more specialized exposures to enhance portfolio diversification. Our actively managed strategies are fueled by in-depth, bottom-up research and security selection from portfolio managers with direct experience in the sectors and regions in which they invest. Investability, liquidity, diversity, and transparency are key to the experienced decision-making around market and index selection underlying VanEck\u2019s passive strategies.\n\nSince our founding in 1955, putting our clients\u2019 interests first, in all market environments, has been at the heart of the firm\u2019s mission.\n\nImportant Disclosures\n\nThe information contained in the registration statement for VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF is not complete and may be changed. Van Eck may not sell these securities until the registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d) becomes effective. The prospectus and statement of additional information contained in the registration statement is not an offer to sell the securities referenced therein and is not soliciting an offer to buy these securities in any state where the offer or sale is not permitted.\n\nThe value of Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC) and the Funds\u2019 Futures holdings, could decline rapidly, including to zero. You should be prepared to lose your entire investment. The Funds do not invest in BTC, ETH or other digital assets directly.\n\nThe further development and acceptance of digital asset networks, which is part of a new and rapidly changing industry, is subject to a variety of factors that are difficult to evaluate, the slowing, stopping or reversing of the development or acceptance of the digital asset networks may adversely affect the price of digital assets and therefore cause the Funds to suffer losses, regulatory changes or actions may alter the nature of an investment in digital assets or restrict the use of digital assets or the operations of the digital asset networks or venues on which digital assets trade in a manner that adversely affects the price of digital assets and, therefore, the Funds\u2019s digital asset Futures. Digital assets generally operate without central authority (such as a bank) and are not backed by any government, digital assets are not legal tender and federal, state and/or foreign governments may restrict the use and exchange of digital assets, and regulation in the United States is still developing.\n\nFutures Contract Risk. The use of futures contracts involves risks that are in addition to, and potentially greater than, the risks of investing directly in securities and other more traditional assets. The market for digital asset Futures may be less developed, and potentially less liquid and more volatile, than more established futures markets. Digital asset Futures are subject to collateral requirements and daily limits that may limit the Fund\u2019s ability to achieve its target exposure. Margin requirements for digital asset Futures traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (\u201cCME\u201d) may be substantially higher than margin requirements for many other types of futures contracts. Futures contracts exhibit \u201cfutures basis,\u201d\u201d which refers to the difference between the current market value of the underlying digital asset (the \u201cspot\u201d price) and the price of the cash-settled futures contracts.\n\nThis risk may be adversely affected by \u201cnegative roll yields\u201d in \u201ccontango\u201d markets. The Funds will \u201croll\u201d out of one futures contract as the expiration date approaches and into another futures contract on a digital asset with a later expiration date. The \u201crolling\u201d feature creates the potential for a significant negative effect on the Fund\u2019s performance that is independent of the performance of the spot prices of the digital asset. A market where futures prices are generally greater than spot prices is referred to as a \u201ccontango\u201d market. Therefore, if the futures market for a given commodity is in contango, then the value of a futures contract on that commodity would tend to decline over time (assuming the spot price remains unchanged), because the higher futures price would fall as it converges to the lower spot price by expiration. Extended period of contango may cause significant and sustained losses.\n\nAn investment in the VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF (EFUT) may be subject to risks which include, but are not limited to, risks related to market and volatility, investment (in ETH futures), ETH and ETH futures, futures contract, derivatives, counterparty, investment capacity, target exposure and rebalancing, borrowing and leverage, credit, interest rate, liquidity, investing in other investment companies, management, new fund, non-diversified, operational, portfolio turnover, regulatory, repurchase agreements, tax, cash transactions, authorized participant concentration, no guarantee of active trading market, trading issues, fund shares trading, premium/discount risk and liquidity of fund shares, U.S. government securities, debt securities, municipal securities, money market funds, securitized/mortgage-backed securities, sovereign bond, ETH-related company, ETH-related concentration, and equity securities risks, all of which could significantly and adversely affect the value of an investment in the Fund.\n\nAn investment in the VanEck Bitcoin Strategy ETF (XBTF) may be subject to risks which include, among others market and volatility, investment, futures contract, derivatives, investments related to bitcoin and bitcoin futures, derivatives, counterparty, investment capacity, target exposure and rebalancing, borrowing and leverage, indirect investment, credit, interest rate, illiquidity, investing in other investment companies, management, new fund, non-diversified, operational, portfolio turnover, regulatory, repurchase agreements, tax, of cash transactions, authorized participant concentration, no guarantee of active trading market, trading issues, fund shares trading, premium/discount and liquidity of fund shares, U.S. government securities, debt securities, municipal securities, money market funds, securitized/asset-backed securities, and sovereign bond risks, all of which could significantly and adversely affect the value of an investment in the Fund.\n\nInvesting involves substantial risk and high volatility, including possible loss of principal.

The Ethereum price chart displayed an impressive green daily candle, indicating a notable increase of over 2.3%. At present, ETH is trading at $1,635.8 per token, reaching its highest value in the last eight days.\n\nThroughout this week, Ethereum has enjoyed remarkable gains, with its price surging by 4.6% since the beginning of the week. The current rise has made this week the most profitable for the altcoin since July.\n\nETH to USD by CoinMarketCap\n\nMondays are for Ethereum ETFs\n\nHowever, the excitement surrounding Ethereum extends beyond its price movement. There is a growing anticipation within the crypto community about the potential launch of Ethereum Futures ETFs as early as next week. Eric Balchunas, a senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg, hinted at such a development.\n\nAccording to the analyst, the SEC is reportedly eager to expedite the launch of Ethereum Futures ETFs. He suggested that the security regulator has asked ETF filers to update their documentation by Friday evening so that they can become effective on Monday and commence trading on Tuesday.\n\nUPDATE: Hearing the SEC wants to accelerate the launch of Ether futures ETFs (bc they want it off their plate bf shutdown) so they've asked the filers to update their docs by Fri pm (no small task to jam into 48hrs, esp for indie issuers), so they can go eff Mon and trade Tue. https://t.co/gKyQFK12aM \u2014 Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) September 28, 2023\n\nWhile the crypto community eagerly awaits the launch of futures ETFs, the situation is more complex for spot instruments. The SEC recently deferred its decision on Ethereum Spot ETFs from ARK Invest and VanEck, setting new deadlines for both entities \u2014 Dec. 26 for ARK Invest and Dec. 25 for VanEck."

        "title": "Is The Ethereum Winter Over? L2 Exploding, ETH Futures ETF Launches - NewsBTC",
        "content": "After sinking roughly 30% from 2023 highs, Ethereum appears to be bouncing off from the pits of the crypto winter. Looking at candlestick arrangements in the daily and weekly charts, the coin has primary support at around $1,500 and is firm, bouncing off with decent trading volume.\n\nAt spot rates, ETH is up approximately 3% following positive developments sparked by the increasing adoption of its layer-2 scaling solution and the recent news that VanEck, a player managing billions of assets, is preparing to launch an Ethereum derivatives product.\n\nEthereum Layer-2 Solutions Exploding\n\nTaking to X on September 28, Alex Masmej, the founder of Showtime, believes that Ethereum\u2019s layer-2 ecosystem has expanded to such an extent that it no \u201clonger makes sense to build on other platforms.\u201d\n\nThe development and deployment of Ethereum layer-2 solutions took center stage following network congestion, which forced gas fees to spike to record highs in the last bull run.\n\nDevelopers have responded to the network co-founder Vitalik Buterin\u2019s urging. The expert believes they are quickly constructing and deploying safe, universal platforms that have gained widespread popularity.\n\nLayer-2 platforms bundle transactions off-chain before confirming them on-chain, allowing for faster and more cost-effective operations while benefiting from the security of Ethereum. As of September 28, there were over 827,000 validators whose job is to confirm transactions and ensure that the network is secure, thanks in part to their geographic distribution.\n\nMost layer-2 solutions use optimistic rollups, including Arbitrum, Base, and OP Mainnet. However, Masmej also said that once ZK rollups, which utilize zero-knowledge proofs to validate transactions without revealing sensitive data, are available, it will end the scalability trilemma, further boosting the capabilities of layer-2 solutions.\n\nIn the founder\u2019s assessment, high throughput options, including Solana, will be a hedge. At the same time, Cosmos, which drives blockchain interoperability, will act as a long-term source of inspiration. Meanwhile, Ethereum will continue to flourish as Layer-2 options gain traction.\n\nRising TVL And ETH Complex Products Launching\n\nAccording to l2Beat data, popular solutions like Arbitrum and Base, which offer faster and cheaper processing environments while remaining coupled with Ethereum and enjoying the pioneer network\u2019s fast-move advantage, have larger total value locked (TVL). As of September 28, layer-2 platforms have a TVL of over $10.6 billion, more than Solana\u2019s market cap, which stood at $8 billion, according to CoinMarketCap.\n\nBeyond layer-2 adoption, ETH is being catalyzed by the news that VanEck, a global asset manager, is preparing to introduce its Ethereum futures exchange-traded fund (ETF). Specifically, the VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF (EFUT) will invest in ETH futures contracts provided by exchanges approved by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).\n\nLike the Bitcoin Futures ETF product, which is already being offered, the Ethereum derivative product will allow institutions to gain exposure, boosting liquidity.\n\nFeature image from Canva, chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "Ethereum\u2019s EIP-7503 Takes Privacy to New Heights at Execution Layer Summit - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "Ethereum recently completed a community event, ACDE 171, discussing how to bring several transformative elements that could shape the future of the network, possibly bolstering security and privacy.\n\nThe event covered several broad topics, including Dencun Devnets, extensive audits, the much-awaited launch of Holesky, a pioneering proposal for private ETH transfers, and significant changes to the EIP-6780 specification.\n\nThe Enhancement of Privacy and Security\n\nTim Beiko, a popular member of the Ethereum community, gave a detailed recap of these events on X. The topics he highlighted include the development of devnet-9, the focus on blob transaction gossip, audits of the EIP-4788 contract bytecode, and the relaunch of Holesky.\n\nPer the X posts, the event\u2019s highlight was the introduction of EIP-7503, a proposition that, according to Beiko, will redefine private transfers on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nThe authors of EIP 7503 were allowed to present the idea. According to Ethereum\u2019s documentation, EIP 7503 was discovered when the developers were exploring ways to offer more privacy and applications of ZKP.\n\nEIP-7501 introduces a new approach called \u201cBurn and Remint,\u201d which allows private transfers by burning and reminting ETH. By burning, individuals send the ETH to an unspendable address \u201cand later build a ZK proof showing that some amount of tokens has been burnt in a transaction in an older block, without revealing the transaction.\u201d The merger of ZKP, in this case, is designed to enhance privacy and security.\n\nBeiko also shed some light on the audits for the EIP-4788 contract bytecode. It was reported that three independent auditors, including ChainSecurity, Dedaub, and Trail of Bits, have been contracted to scrutinize it. Representatives from both ChainSecurity and Dedaub confirmed on a call that no other issues were identified beyond those mentioned in the initial review.\n\nAuditors reviewed changes, such as explicitly dealing with 0 being passed as a timestamp and changing the buffer length to be 100% used regardless of block time, and found no problems with the fixes. However, they highlighted two aspects that users of the beacon roots contract should be aware of.\n\nOther Minor Issues Noted\n\nDevnet 9 was also a matter of question at the event, and Beiko reported that the teams are already preparing and working to navigate various test cases. Other Devnets, which will be short-lived for testing purposes, were discussed.\n\nFurthermore, a small proposed change under EIP-6780 would deactivate SELFDESTRUCT, except in the same transaction as contract creation.\n\nThe Execution Layer Meeting 171 comes just two weeks after Meeting 170, which was held on Sept. 14. As per the reports, the new ACDE meeting is scheduled for Oct. 12 at 14:00 UTC."

        "title": "Top 3 Price Prediction: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple: BTC, ETH, XRP at catch 22 moment - FXStreet",
        "content": "Share:\n\nBitcoin price could make a 5% climb to $27,771 if it overcomes resistance confluence between 50- and 200-EMA at 26,948.\n\nEthereum price could breach the $1,648 barricade if rising momentum activates the pending bullish call.\n\nRipple price\u2019s recovery rally threatened by massive seller accumulation within the $0.5145 and $0.5536 order block.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price is trying to lead the rest of the market i nto recovery. However, it faces a key obstacle, same case for Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) positioning the top three cryptocurrencies in a muddle.\n\nAlso Read: This short-term Bitcoin holder indicator forecasts another rally for BTC\n\nBitcoin price tests key confluence hurdle\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price is working out a recovery, but the upside potential remains limited by a descending trend line from a big picture point of view. More closely, the king of crypto is trapped under the foothold of the three Exponential Moving Averages (EMA), making it a Catch-22 moment or complication for investors.\n\nIn today\u2019s trading session, Bitcoin price climbed almost 3%, escaping above the trendline before a strong rejection from the resistance confluence presented by the 50- and 200-day EMA at $26,948.\n\nThe overall outlook of the Relative Strength Index (RSI) shows that while momentum appears to be rising, it remains rather weak. The red histogram bars of the Awesome Oscillator paint the same picture, moving narrowly above the midline. This increases the odds for Bitcoin price falling.\n\nHowever, bulls still have a chance to push north, considering the RSI is tipping up and the AO is positive. The onus, therefore, is on bulls to increase their buying pressure, with a break and close above the 100-day EMA at $27,330 confirming the breakout.\n\nIn a highly bullish case, Bitcoin price could extend above the $27,771 resistance level, last tested in late August.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-day chart\n\nConversely, traders are likely to start cashing in after Bitcoin price\u2019s failed attempt at a breakout. The ensuing selling pressure could send BTC below the $26,000 psychological level to test the demand zone at around $25,856. A break and close below its mean threshold at $25,527 will confirm the downtrend, likely leading BTC to the September 11 lows at $24,899. This would constitute a 5% slump from current levels.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin Ordinals creator proposes \u201cRunes\u201d, a replacement for BRC-20 standard\n\nEthereum price has a pending bullish call that needs activation\n\nEthereum (ETH) price is in an upwards spiral, with the current move, if sustained, likely to send ETH past the $1,648 resistance level. This roadblock has been in play since the onset of the month. If bulls activate the pending bullish call indicated by the RSI attempting to cross above the signal line (yellow band), the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) token could finally break through. A solid move above the 50-day EMA at $1,666 would confirm the breakout.\n\nThe green shade of the AO supports this outlook as it points to bullish dominance over the bears.\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the other hand, a rejection from the $1,648 resistance level could send Ethereum price south, potentially tagging the support floor at $1,551. In the dire case, the losses could extrapolate for a quick liquidity sweep, with the daily chart showing a bit of sell-side liquidity residing underneath.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum Restaking - The next big thing after liquid staking?\n\nRipple price faces massive seller accumulation\n\nRipple (XRP) price recovery could be overpowered by seller momentum from the supply zone between $0.5536 and $0.5145. This order block is populated by strong sellers, with the 100-, 200, and 50-day EMAs at $0.5376, $0.5193, and $0.5278 all converging within it. As such, it is likely that XRP could fall, potentially going as low as the $0.4622 support level. In the dire case, the fall could extend to the support floor at $0.4191, with the move denoting a 15% fall from current levels.\n\nThe RSI is inclined south, suggesting falling momentum, invigorated by the red histogram bars of the AO. This tips the odds further in favor of the bears.\n\nXRP/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the flipside, sidelined investors could inspire a move north, sending Ripple price into the supply zone. A break and close above the midline of this order block, coinciding with the 50-day EMA at $0.5278 would confirm the climb. In a highly bullish case, XRP could shatter the upper boundary of the order block at $0.5536, clearing the path for a continuation to the $0.6098 level. Such a move would denote 20% ascension.\n\nAlso Read: Ripple and Coinbase lead the big fight as US crypto firms advocate for regulatory overhaul"

        "title": "Ethereum Price Prediction: Bulls Hold Firmly Despite ETF News - CoinGape",
        "content": "Ethereum has steadied the uptrend following the dip to $1,564 earlier this week. The formation of a short-term falling wedge, as discussed in the previous ETH price prediction boosted the bulls\u2019 presence and confidence in the market.\n\nThe largest smart contracts crypto, although barely unchanged on Thursday toward the end of the Asia session is trading at $1,603. There was a sharp but brief breakout to $1,633 during the American session but news about the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) delaying the decision on two spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) triggered a minor pullback.\n\nadvertisement\n\nSEC Postpones Decisions on ETFs From Ark, VanEck\n\nThe SEC announced on Wednesday that it is delaying the decision on ARK 21Shares Ethereum ETF until December 26. According to the agency, the delay is necessary as it allows taking \u201caction on proposed rule change\u201d and considering the rule change and concerns that emerge from it.\n\n\u201cThe Commission finds it appropriate to designate a longer period within which to take action on the proposed rule change so that it has sufficient time to consider the proposed rule change and the issues raised therein,\u201d the SEC filing stated.\n\nIt is barely a month since Cathie Wood\u2019s Ark Invest and 21Shares filed with the SEC. The move by the two companies was welcomed with open arms amid issues of extremely low volatility across the crypto market.\n\nAmidst fears of a government shutdown in the US, the SEC also delayed the decisions on another proposal, VanEck Ethereum ETF, which will be considered again on December 25.\n\nOn Tuesday, the agency announced the delayed decision to approve or reject the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF, which will be considered again in 2024 with the deadline set for January 10.\n\nEthereum Price Bullish Comeback\n\nThe delays on Ethereum spot ETFs triggered a minor retracement but support provided by the 23.6% Fibonacci level gave bulls another chance to reaffirm the uptrend. Ethereum currently holds above the 50 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) (red) at $1,600 and this is a positive short-term signal.\n\nFor Ethereum price to carry on with the uptrend, bulls must reclaim the 100 EMA (blue) support/resistance at $1,610 and do the same with the 200 EMA (purple) at $1,640.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) reinforces the strength of the uptrend as it seeks support above the midline following a rebound from near-oversold conditions earlier this week.\n\nTraders can also sit tight with confidence that ETH\u2019s recovery will continue to $1,700 and later to $1,800 based on the positive outlook of the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator.\n\nA buy signal sent on September 25 encouraged traders to seek exposure to Ethereum longs. With the blue MACD line above the red signal line, the path with the least resistance will remain to the upside.\n\nRelated Articles"

Also, influential Ethereans saw the demonstration of zero-knowledge wormholes, a cutting-edge privacy concept for all of Ethereum (ETH).\n\nHolesky finally launched, EIP-4788 three audits, MEV Boost: Ethereum Core Devs Meeting #171 highlights\n\nYesterday, on Sept. 28, 2023, Ethereum ACDE #171 participants gathered to discuss Dencun devnets, EIP-4788 audits, Holesky's launch and a completely new private Ether transfer mechanism. A recap of the meeting was published by Ethereum Foundation's Tim Beiko on X.\n\n.@ethereum ACDE 171 happened earlier today, covering Dencun devnets, 4788 audits, Holesky's launch, a new private ETH transfer proposal, and changes to the EIP-6780 spec.\n\n\n\nAgenda: https://t.co/JHZuJtoOw9\n\nStream: https://t.co/2XToaM0ADv\n\nRecap below \ud83d\ude04 https://t.co/3hZpsxp4Bw \u2014 timbeiko.eth \u2600\ufe0f (@TimBeiko) September 28, 2023\n\nFirst, Ethereans confirmed the successful launch of Holesky testnet designed to replace Goerli. The testnet kicked off on its second attempt, while the first one failed due to synchronization on the anniversary of the Merge.\n\nAs covered by U.Today, Holesky works with the largest set of validators in Ethereum's (ETH) history and will not be exposed to the shortage of testnet ETH tokens.\n\nAlso, Ethereum (ETH) is proceeding toward Devnet 9 and Devnet 10, two short-lived testnets designed to emulate the activation of the Deneb-Cancun upgrade with Proto-Danksharding. To stress test the consensus design, Ethereum (ETH) developers will focus on the maximum number of testnet validators involved. Testing the MEV-boost mechanism will also kick off soon.\n\nEIP-4788, designed to expose the roots of Beacon Chain blocks inside the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), will be audited by three teams: ChainSecurity, Dedaub and Trail of Bits.\n\nEthereum (ETH) bets big on privacy as zero-knowledge wormholes introduced\n\nThe core developers of Ethereum (ETH) saw the demo of EIP-7503, or zero-knowledge wormholes, prepared by its creators Keyvan Kambakhsh, Hamid Bateni and Amir Kahoori. In short, this concept allows Ethereum (ETH) holders to secretely remint the Ethers they previously burned.\n\nThe novelty employs zero-knowledge tech: an ETH user can later build a ZK proof to show that some amount of tokens has been burnt in a transaction on an older block, without revealing the transaction details.\n\nAs such, in a frictionless manner, Ethereum (ETH) holders can create a privacy-centric pool of Ethers that would include the entire circulating Ethereum (ETH) supply, the devs said in the proposal."

        "title": "EigenLayer's Sreeram Kannan on the Hot (and Risky) Ethereum Trend of 'Restaking' - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Sreeram Kannan was a professor at the University of Washington, Seattle, when he started working for its blockchain research lab in 2017.\n\nIt was there while working at the lab that he founded his company, EigenLabs, the organization behind EigenLayer \u2013 a blockchain protocol considered a pioneer in a just-now-arriving trend in the Ethereum ecosystem known as restaking. The idea is to repurpose ETH tokens staked on the Ethereum blockchain for double duty, using them to provide security for other applications.\n\nThis article is featured in the latest issue of The Protocol, our weekly newsletter exploring the tech behind crypto, one block at a time. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.\n\nEigenLayer has been in the news lately, as the restaking ecosystem starts to take shape. Some top Ethereum figures have also raised flags about the risks; Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin at one point cautioned that the new feature could ultimately pose systemic risks to the main blockchain\u2019s stability.\n\nWe spoke with Kannan last week, where we asked him questions about EigenLayer and restaking. Some highlights include:\n\nOn Kannan\u2019s response to Buterin\u2019s concerns about staking: \u201cAnything that restaking can do, already liquid staking can do.\u201d\n\nOn Ethereum\u2019s plan to slow the rate of new validators coming on line, via the EIP-7514 proposal: \u201cThis is a super important thing for Ethereum to be conservative and not have an overflow.\u201d\n\nOn whether Ethereum will ever reach its maximum capacity for shared security: \u201cThere's absolutely a limit.\u201d\n\nQ: I saw Vitalik\u2019s blog post about overloading the consensus layer, and how restaking, in his view, could pose systemic risks to Ethereum. I'm curious to hear your take on his take?\n\nKannan: One of the things I think he wants to kind of lay out is that, \u201cHey don't externalize, and don't create something that, assuming that if the protocol goes wrong, Ethereum is going to fork around it.\u201d\n\nI think that is a pretty reasonable position from Ethereum, that you build protocols and the protocols have to internalize social consensus rather than externalize it to Ethereum.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo I read it as to not overload Ethereum social consensus, which is used only for forking the chain. And don't assume that you can build a protocol that, and because you're too big to fail, Ethereum can fork around that. So that's how I read it.\n\nAnd I think it's a pretty obvious statement in our view. But I think it has to be said, somebody has to say it, so it's good that Vitalik went out and said it.\n\nBecause what we don't want is for calls to deploy code that is not properly audited, doesn't have internal security controls, and then the Ethereum community has to now work hard to figure out how to retrieve it.\n\nI think a lot of people after reading the article have been talking a lot about restaking risks.\n\nI want to make it super clear: anything that restaking can do, already liquid staking can do, so I view restaking as a lesser risk than liquid staking.\n\nQ: Can you expand on that?\n\nKannan: Basically, you can take a liquid staking token and then deposit it into complex DeFi protocols, or you could just deposit it into validating a new layer 2, or a new oracle or any of these things.\n\nSo anything that restaking can do, liquid staking can already do. Because you know, you have the LSD [short for liquid staking derivative] token, and you can do anything with it. And one particular thing you could do with that is, of course, go and validate another network.\n\nSo I view restaking as just one particular use case of liquid staking, but actually reducing the risk of that one particular use case.\n\nQ: Why do you think restaking is having a moment in the news?\n\nKannan: I don't know. I'm glad people are talking about it. Of course, anything that adds new rewards to stakers is something interesting.\n\nI said anything that could be done with EigenLayer could be done with LSTs, but people didn't know what to do with these LSTs.\n\nThey were doing exactly the same thing that people are doing with ether, which is lending, borrowing, the same set of DeFi parameters.\n\nI think one thing that EigenLayer did is by creating this new category, that validation, if I can borrow the Ethereum trust network to do new things: I can build a new layer 1, I can build a new like oracle network, I can build a new data availability system, I can build any system on top of the Ethereum trust network, so it internalizes all the innovation back into Ethereum, or aggregates all the innovation back into Ethereum, rather than each innovation requiring a whole new system.\n\nSo I think that narrative is quite attractive.\n\nQ: I was just reading the news about EIP-7514, which is a short term solution for solving the overcrowdedness of validators, by limiting entries of new validators. How does that affect an EigenLayer?\n\nKannan: I think mostly, it means the same thing for EigenLayer that it means for liquid staking protocols, that there is going to be a smaller rate at which new validators can enter.\n\nThere's a long entry queue right now, and people don't want to wait that long.\n\nAnd making it slower is going to just make the new growth of LSTs slower. But I understand fully that this is a super important thing for Ethereum to be conservative and not have an overflow of validators that may not be able to be handled by the consensus layer.\n\nBut in the long term, if the total staking of Ethereum cannot grow, one of the things that happens is the total yield or the return that stakers are getting is bounded by the Ethereum staking, whereas in the presence of restaking there is a possibility for them to get some of these additional rewards. Other than that, it's pretty similar.\n\nQ: You were making the point that EigenDA is just like in-house AVS (actively validated service) \u2013 explain what it is:\n\nKannan: What we decided is, in order to keep this system of shared security, in order to keep EigenLayer as decentralized as possible, we want to make sure that there is a highly scalable data system at its backbone. And that's what EigenDA is, it's a highly scalable data availability system, built on the same ideas that underpin the Ethereum roadmap, particularly what is called danksharding.\n\nOur view is that building an Ethereum-adjacent data availability layer requires first principles thinking, whereas Celestia and Avail are built to be chains by themselves.\n\nIf you're building a data availability system adjacent to Ethereum, you'd want Ethereum validators to participate. So that's just one part of the story. Of course, EigenLayer enables that.\n\nBut then you go beyond that, and then you see, \u201cOh, it's not just you want to get the Ethereum nodes to participate.\u201d\n\nEthereum already has consensus built in, and Ethereum gives you the ordering of the various transactions. So you should build the data availability system, which doesn't need its own ordering.\n\nWhereas all the existing other protocols like Celestia and Avail, are basically chains that have to do their own ordering; we built a system which doesn't have internal ordering; all ordering is done on Ethereum.\n\nQ: Liquid restaking tokens - once your liquid staking tokens are locked on EigenLayer, they become illiquid?\n\nKannan: That\u2019s correct, the problem that the liquid restaking tokens are trying to solve is, can I just have a restaked position, and then still keep it liquid. So you can take that receipt token of liquid restaking and then transfer it.\n\nWe are not building this kind of liquid restaking but other people are building liquid restaking on top of them.\n\nQ: I think your comment was, you want to use the Ethereum shared security for as many things as possible. I'm curious, now that there's also people building on the back of what y'all are doing, is there a natural limit to how much that you know, Ethereum can support?\n\nKannan: This is a similar kind of question that one could ask already at the application layer of Ethereum: How many applications on Ethereum are smart contracts and how many smart contracts can be built on top of Ethereum?\n\nSo it's the same thing with EigenLayer because people staking and running new applications, but now they do it much more flexibly and programmably with these aliases on top of EigenLayer, all contribute back to Ethereum. Their ETH staking increases rewards, ETH itself potentially increases in value because of all these additional use cases.\n\nSo over time, this can start to accommodate more and more.\n\nBut there's absolutely a limit."

        "content": "Ethereum developers have launched the Holesky testnet.\n\nHolesky will replace Goerli as the main testnet for protocol-level changes.\n\nFind out how Holesky trumps its predecessor.\n\nEthereum is the most used blockchain in the world primarily due to its pioneering smart contract capabilities, making it a popular venue for Web3 and decentralized application (DApp) development.\n\nAs the demand for the network continues to grow, so does the complexity of upgrades required to meet this demand, creating the need for robust testing environments. In response to this need, on Thursday, September 28, developers launched a new test network (testnet) for Ethereum called Holesky to allow for more rigorous testing of network upgrades.\n\nWith Holesky set to replace Goerli as the largest Ethereum testnet, we discuss what Holesky is and how it improves on its predecessor.\n\nWhat Is Ethereum\u2019s Holesky?\n\nHolesky is a network designed to serve as a sandbox for future Ethereum upgrades, specifically as regards the network\u2019s staking infrastructure and other protocol-level iterations.\n\nWelcome to the world #Holesky \ud83d\ude00\n\nThe largest public testnet we've had to date!\n\n\n\nFYI: Hole\u0161ovice has two train stations, fits that we had to launch the testnet twice \ud83d\ude00\n\nphoto credits: @skylenet pic.twitter.com/wPSR4Gbhtq \u2014 parithosh | \ud83d\udc3c\ud83d\udc49\ud83d\udc48\ud83d\udc3c (@parithosh_j) September 28, 2023\n\nDevelopers named the latest Ethereum testnet after the Hole\u0161ovice train station, which is viewed as the second most important railway station in Prague, known for its proximity to the famous Hole\u0161ovice market, art galleries, and the Vltava, the longest river in the Czech Republic.\n\nHolesky is the first Ethereum testnet to ship merged and is compatible with the Shapella upgrade. The testnet is billed to replace Goerli as the main Ethereum sandbox for protocol-level changes.\n\nHow Is Holesky Better Than Goerli?\n\nLaunched in 2019, Goerli has been the main Ethereum testnet for infrastructure and core protocol upgrades for the past four years. However, as more developers piled in and upgrade complexities surged, failings of the testnet became obvious. Most notably, the capped supply of Goerli ETH (goETH), tokens used to pay for gas on the testnet.\n\nInitially designed to be free and obtained through faucets, goETH scarcity led to the creation of a market where developers looking to test changes are forced to pay to secure these tokens to test out changes, increasing development costs. Additionally, developers worried that the smaller validator set on Goerli (512,000) compared to the Ethereum mainnet (700,000) could allow for scaling issues to arise on the mainnet first.\n\nAddressing the failings of Goerli, Holesky comes out of the box with a significantly larger testnet token supply and validator set. Specifically, Holesky boasts a 1.6 billion testnet token supply and a validator size of 1.4 million. For comparison, that is twice as many validators as the mainnet.\n\nHolesky is happening soon! We crowdsourced requests for running genesis validators and created a genesis state that's 1,460,000 validators: Roughly 2x mainnet! Genesis will happen in less than a month \ud83d\ude00 https://t.co/hh9OmABjoR \u2014 parithosh | \ud83d\udc3c\ud83d\udc49\ud83d\udc48\ud83d\udc3c (@parithosh_j) August 22, 2023\n\nThe latest testnet will play a key role in preparations for Dencun, Ethereum\u2019s next major upgrade, which will introduce the long-anticipated proto-danksharding that will reduce costs for users of Layer 2 networks. Developers believe Holesky can serve as the main Ethereum testnet for three to five years.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nThe initial Holesky launch failed on September 15, forcing developers to return to the drawing board.\n\nGoerli will continue to run till early 2024.\n\nSepolia remains the Ethereum sandbox for testing DApps, smart contracts, and EVM functionality.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nEthereum\u2019s growing demand and complexity require that developers have robust testing environments to try out upgrades before launching on the mainnet. The launch of Holesky promises to meet this demand for at least the next three years.\n\nRead this to learn more about testnets and their usefulness in crypto:\n\nTestnets in Crypto: How To Use Test Networks to Earn Cryptocurrency\n\n\n\nFind out what Ethereum blobs are and their role in scaling the network:\n\nWhat Are Ethereum Blobs, and How Do They Boost Scalability?"

If a shutdown occurs, just 8% of SEC staff will stay on the job.\n\nA Bloomberg reported first teased yesterday:\n\nHearing the SEC wants to accelerate the launch of Ether futures ETFs (bc they want it off their plate bf shutdown) so they've asked the filers to update their docs by Fri pm (no small task to jam into 48hrs, esp for indie issuers), so they can go eff Mon and trade Tue.\n\nThe scoop was seemingly confirmed by VanEck, who put out a press release today about the 'upcoming launch' of their ether ETF, even offering up a symbol (EFUT).\n\nI would be careful chasing the headlines around an approval, as it largely looks priced in now and there might be speculation that a spot bitcoin ETF is also being pushed out (I'd say that's highly unlikely). At this point, a better bet is that this is a sell-the-fact trade, though if there's a nice run in risk assets it could run."

As the allure of Ethereum continues to captivate investors and enthusiasts alike, the demand for secure Ethereum wallets has surged to unprecedented heights.\n\nIn 2024, navigating the Ethereum landscape has never been more exciting or complex. With its dynamic ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps), including DeFi protocols, play-to-earn (P2E) games, NFT marketplaces, and beyond, Ethereum has redefined the possibilities of blockchain technology. However, to truly immerse yourself in this bustling blockchain universe and ensure the safe storage, transfer, and management of Ether (ETH) and other Ethereum-based assets, a reliable Ethereum wallet is an absolute necessity.\n\nJoin us as we embark on a journey to discover the best Ethereum wallet in 2024, each designed to not only safeguard your crypto holdings but also seamlessly connect you to the ever-expanding world of Ethereum dApps through smart contract integration.\n\nCryptoWallet.com \u2013 Best wallet to spend ETH\n\nCryptoWallet.com is the best Ethereum wallet for daily use. You can send and receive ETH with ease, along with 800+ other cryptocurrencies. You can also spend ETH directly from your wallet using our Crypto Card. Ledger Nano X \u2013 Best hardware wallet\n\n\u2013 Best hardware wallet MetaMask \u2013 Best for For Interacting with dApps\n\n\u2013 Best for For Interacting with dApps Trust Wallet \u2013 Best mobile wallet\n\n\u2013 Best mobile wallet Exodus \u2013 Best desktop wallet\n\nWhat is an Ethereum Wallet?\n\nAn Ethereum wallet or ETH wallet is a digital tool or application that allows users to securely store, manage, send, and receive Ethereum (ETH) and other Ethereum-based cryptocurrencies, tokens, and assets. Ethereum wallets are essential for anyone looking to participate in the Ethereum blockchain ecosystem, which is known for its smart contract functionality and decentralized applications (dApps).\n\nWith an ETH wallet, you can send ETH or receive it from other users using the Ethereum wallet address. You can easily check your Ethereum balance within the wallet, so you always know how much ETH you have.\n\nHere are the key functions and features found on some of the best Ethereum wallets:\n\nStorage: ETH wallets store the private keys and public addresses associated with your Ethereum holdings. Private keys are crucial because they are used to sign transactions and access your funds. It\u2019s essential to keep your private keys secure, as they provide control over your assets.\n\nSending and Receiving: With an Ethereum wallet, you input the recipient\u2019s Ethereum address and the amount you want to send, and the wallet handles the transaction for you. Similarly, you can receive it from other users using your Ethereum wallet address.\n\nToken Support: Many Ethereum wallets also support Ethereum-based tokens, such as ERC-20 tokens. This feature allows you to store and manage a wide range of digital assets beyond just Ether.\n\nInteraction with dApps: Some Ethereum wallets are equipped to interact directly with decentralized applications (dApps) on the Ethereum blockchain. This functionality enables you to participate in DeFi platforms, NFT marketplaces, games, and other Ethereum-based applications.\n\nHow to Choose The Best Ethereum Wallet?\n\nEthereum cold wallets and hot wallets are two distinct categories of cryptocurrency wallets, each designed with different levels of security and accessibility in mind. Let\u2019s explore the differences between them:\n\nEthereum Hot Wallet\n\nHot wallets are online or software-based wallets that are constantly connected to the internet. They are designed for convenience and easy access, making them suitable for day-to-day transactions and activities.\n\nHot ETH wallets are ideal for users who need quick access to their Ethereum holdings for trading, sending, or receiving transactions. They are commonly used for activities like making online purchases, participating in decentralized exchanges (DEXs), and interacting with decentralized applications (dApps) in real time.\n\nWhile hot wallets come with security features like PIN codes and encryption, they are more susceptible to hacking attempts and online threats compared to cold wallets. Since they are connected to the internet, there is a risk that they can be compromised if the user\u2019s device or online accounts are compromised.\n\nExamples: CryptoWallt.com, MetaMask, MyEtherWallet (when used as an online wallet), and most mobile and desktop wallets fall into the category of hot wallets.\n\nEthereum Cold Wallet\n\nEthereum Cold wallets (which are mostly Hardware wallets), as the name suggests, are offline wallets designed primarily for long-term storage of Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies. They are not connected to the internet, which significantly reduces the risk of online attacks or hacking attempts. This makes cold wallets one of the most secure options for storing crypto assets.\n\nCold ETH wallets are not suitable for frequent transactions or immediate access to funds. They are best used for securely storing large amounts of Ethereum as a long-term investment or as a safeguard against online threats.\n\nExamples: These are physical devices, often resembling USB drives, that store the user\u2019s private keys offline. Popular examples include Ledger Nano X and Trezor Model T.\n\nBest Ethereum Wallet of 2024\n\nCryptoWallet.com\n\nCryptoWallet.com was designed specifically to solve the pain points seen with other wallets. It\u2019s a full suite of financial services including a buy/sell, virtual IBAN, onramps and offramps for businesses, and even a crypto card that supports direct spending and over 800 cryptos!\n\nCryptoWallet.com offers the best wallet for spending ETH directly. We call our custodial Ethereum wallet \u201cEthereum Account\u201d where you can hold your ETH and spend it anywhere with our Crypto Card.\n\nCryptoWallet.com includes a built-in cryptocurrency exchange feature, allowing users to trade one cryptocurrency for another directly within the wallet interface. This can simplify the process of managing your crypto portfolio.\n\nYou can buy Ethereum with credit card or debit card and use it for banking and payments \u2013 such as making bank transfers using your ETH funds, spending it online with a crypto card, or converting it to fiat instantly at any ATM.\n\nType of wallet: Mobile\n\nMobile Purchase cost: Free\n\nFree Own exchange incorporated: Yes\n\nYes Ease of Use: Very easy\n\nPros \ud83d\udc4d\n\nUsers can spend their crypto on real goods and products through the CryptoWallet.com card, finally allowing people to use crypto as real money. It\u2019s rare to find a crypto wallet with card features, bridging the gap between crypto and the rest of the world!\n\nYou can pay your bills or go shopping with your Ethereum funds, and then add more ether later from the built-in exchange. You can earn money with CryptoWallet.com by referring users, as you\u2019ll be paid a portion of their debit card transaction fees. It\u2019s easy to use, and brings all the most common user needs and wants together in a simple user interface.\n\nCons \ud83d\udc4e\n\nAs with non-custodial wallets (for example Coinbase DeFi wallet), users don\u2019t control their own keys with CryptoWallet.com. Again, this is a personal preference. Users with hardware wallets or other non-custodial solutions have sole access to their keys.\n\nHowever, for our CryptoWallet.com card, you can link non-custodial wallets and spend funds directly from them if you wish, instead of the CryptoWallet.com wallets.\n\nOf course, self-custody means no exchange, no debit card, no customer support, no community, and no rewards program.

The wallet doesn\u2019t support fiat currencies like GBP or USD, only crypto tokens.\n\nBest Ethereum Wallet: Why is Security so Important in the Crypto World?\n\nSecurity is paramount in crypto. The nature of blockchain technology means that transactions cannot usually be reversed or cancelled after sending. Typical banking services such as \u201cchargeback\u201d do not apply to crypto. It can also be very difficult to trace stolen or missing crypto funds.\n\nFor those reasons, protecting the funds at the source is important, and that means choosing a good wallet.\n\nTypes of Ethereum Wallets\n\nEthereum wallets come in various types, each with its own characteristics, features, and use cases. Here are the main types of Ethereum wallets:\n\nSoftware ETH Wallets\n\nDesktop Wallets: These are applications installed on your computer. They offer good security and control but are only as secure as your computer. Examples include MyEtherWallet (MEW), Exodus, and Electrum.\n\nMobile Wallets: These are wallet apps designed for smartphones and tablets. They are convenient for on-the-go transactions. Examples include Trust Wallet and Coinbase Wallet.\n\nWeb Wallets: Web wallets are accessible through a web browser and are hosted on a website. They are convenient but come with varying degrees of security. For example CryptoWallet.com\n\nBrowser Extension Wallets: These wallets are browser extensions that integrate with your web browser. They are designed to interact with decentralized applications (dApps) and often offer secure ways to store and manage Ethereum and tokens. Examples include MetaMask and Forta Wallet.\n\nHardware ETH Wallets\n\nHardware wallets are physical devices designed solely for cryptocurrency storage and transactions. They are considered one of the most secure options because they keep your private keys offline. Examples include Ledger Nano X and Trezor Model T\n\nIt\u2019s important to choose the type of Ethereum wallet that best suits your needs and security preferences. Security should always be a top priority, especially when dealing with cryptocurrency assets. Consider factors like ease of use, mobility, and the level of control and security provided by each wallet type when making your choice. Many users also employ a combination of wallet types for different purposes, such as using a hardware wallet for long-term storage and a mobile wallet for everyday transactions.\n\nTop Hardware Wallets for Cryptocurrency\n\nHardware wallets such as Trezor Model T and Ledger Nano X are suitable for users who want to keep large sums of cryptocurrency \u201coffline\u201d to add an additional layer of security. Of course, it takes longer to move funds from a hardware wallet than a software wallet. Many users choose to keep some in a web, mobile, or desktop wallet for trading or spending, storing the rest in a hardware wallet.\n\nHardware wallets are the safest way to store Ethereum. A hardware or \u201ccold\u201d wallet is a physical offline device that stores your keys. This makes them extremely difficult to hack. To access and use your Ether you\u2019ll need to connect your wallet to an online device like a computer or phone. This ensures the safety of your funds, however, some investors can find this inconvenient for quick trading. This is why many traders use an assured software wallet like CryptoWallet.com for convenience.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to choose the best Ethereum wallet, it\u2019s important to find one that suits your needs. Trezor and Ledger manufacture a variety of tried-and-tested hardware wallets. Both companies offer wallets with a range of different features that might suit you depending on your budget and needs.\n\nTrezor wallets must be connected using a USB cable and the Trezor Wallet desktop app. Android users may be able to connect their wallet using WebUSB but iPhone owners will have to use a computer. This can be inconvenient for traders who wish to capitalize on sudden market changes. Trezor is an ideal choice for security-concerned users.\n\nLedger is Bluetooth-enabled and comes with both a desktop and mobile app (for Android and iPhone) called Ledger Live. This makes it slightly more convenient to use especially if this is your first hardware wallet.\n\nFinal Verdict: Best Ethereum Wallet\n\nChoosing the best Ethereum wallet for your needs involves considering various factors, including security, convenience, and your specific use case. Here are some recommendations based on different scenarios:\n\nBest for Daily Use: CryptoWallet.com is an excellent choice for daily Ethereum use. It supports multiple cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum and Bitcoin. The standout feature is the Crypto Card, which allows you to spend ETH and Ethereum tokens directly from your wallet, making it easy to use for everyday transactions, including cash withdrawals at traditional ATMs. Most Secure Wallet: If security is your top priority, hardware wallets like Ledger Nano X or Trezor are the way to go. They store your private keys offline in a physical device, making them highly resistant to hacking. However, they require a computer or mobile connection to use. Balanced Security and Convenience: Software wallets offer a balance between security and convenience. They are accessible online and suitable for most users. However, they may be less secure than hardware wallets. Reputable exchanges often insure assets held in their hot wallets to enhance security. Consider using well-known software wallets like CryptoWallet.com or Trust Wallet For Interacting with dApps Online: If you want to actively interact with Ethereum-powered decentralized applications (dApps) online, MetaMask and Guarda browser extensions are excellent choices. They provide easy access to the Ethereum ecosystem directly through your web browser. Best Mobile Wallet: Trust Wallet is ideal if you prefer to access dApps, DeFi applications, and NFT marketplaces on the go. It\u2019s a mobile wallet that offers a user-friendly experience for Ethereum-based activities on your smartphone. For Active Portfolio Management: CryptoWallet.com is suitable for those actively managing their crypto portfolios. It comes with a built-in exchange, allowing you to trade various Ethereum-based tokens conveniently as well as spend them anywhere with crypto card. As a non-custodial alternative, Exodus Wallet is worth considering if you are looking to diversify your holdings. Advanced Use and Smart Contracts: If you require advanced functionality, such as deploying Ethereum smart contracts, MyEtherWallet is an excellent choice. It offers a more technical interface, making it suitable for users who want to engage in Ethereum\u2019s development and smart contract capabilities.\n\nCryptoWallet.com \u2013 The Best Ethereum Wallet to Spend ETH\n\nCryptoWallet.com is not just a crypto wallet, it\u2019s a crypto neo bank that allows you to store your Ethereum and ERC20 tokens.

Ethereum is a decentralized, open-source blockchain platform that was created to enable the development of decentralized applications (DApps) and smart contracts. It was proposed by Vitalik Buterin in late 2013 and development began in early 2014, with the network going live on July 30, 2015. Ether (ETH) is the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum platform. It is used to pay for transaction fees, computational services, and as a store of value. It\u2019s also commonly traded as a digital asset. Here are some key aspects of Ethereum: Smart Contracts: Ethereum allows developers to write and deploy smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller directly written into code. Smart contracts can automatically execute actions when predefined conditions are met, without the need for intermediaries. Decentralization: Ethereum is built on a decentralized network of computers (nodes) that collectively maintain the blockchain. This means there\u2019s no central authority or single point of control, making it resistant to censorship and tampering. DApps: Ethereum has become a hub for the development of decentralized applications (DApps) across various industries, including finance, gaming, supply chain, and more. DApps run on the Ethereum blockchain and often have their own tokens. What is Ethereum 2.0? Ethereum 2.0, also known as Eth2 or Serenity, is a significant upgrade to the Ethereum blockchain. It includes a transition from energy-intensive Proof of Work (PoW) to the more efficient Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. Eth2 introduces sharding, which divides the blockchain into smaller parts to increase scalability and parallel processing. The Beacon Chain, launched in Phase 0, coordinates validators and manages PoS. Crosslinks ensure the security of shard chains. Ethereum 2.0 aims to enhance scalability, sustainability, and security while introducing eWASM for smart contract execution. The upgrade is being rolled out in multiple phases. What is a Ethereum Wallet? An Ethereum wallet is used to hold ETH cryptocurrency tokens. Rather than being a bank account, an Ethereum wallet is an application that stores the information you need to access and use your ether funds. You need a crypto wallet to conduct transactions with your ether coins. The wallet lets you interact with your ether funds on the Ethereum blockchain. It lets you read your balance, make transactions and connect to dApps. An Ethereum wallet includes a public key, similar to a bank account number and a private key, similar to a password. When you want to send ether you\u2019ll use your private key , and when you want to receive crypto, you\u2019ll need to provide your public key to others. If you lose your private key, you lose access to your crypto funds which is why it\u2019s important to keep your private key secure or use a custodial wallet like CryptoWallet.com that will keep your private key safe. There are many different types of wallets to store ETH. The main two types are online or \u201chot\u201d wallets where you can access your funds on the web or using a mobile phone or desktop and, secondly, offline or \u201ccold\u201d wallets which are physical devices used to store the information needed to access your holdings. How to Get an Ethereum Wallet? There are many ways to get an Ethereum wallet. It can be as easy as installing an application on your mobile phone or desktop. Many wallets are also available as an extension for your web browser. With just a few clicks your software wallet will be automatically created and you can start receiving and using your ether right away. Mobile wallets let you carry your ETH wherever you go and spend it easily online and in store. With CryptoWallet.com, payments can be made using the mobile application or with a crypto debit card meaning you will always have access to your ethereum. Setting up your Cryptowallet takes a matter of seconds and you can purchase ETH using fiat money meaning you can start using your ether right away! You can also purchase a hardware or \u201ccold\u201d wallet online. A hardware wallet is a small portable device that can be plugged in or connected with bluetooth to access your ETH funds. Once you\u2019ve purchased your wallet it will be shipped to you for setup. With a hardware wallet, your information is kept securely offline which makes it less susceptible to hacks and keeps your private key safe. Some Ethereum wallets can involve a lengthy setup or waiting period before you can use your ether. Hardware wallets often involve an advanced knowledge of the technology behind cryptocurrency. We\u2019ve compiled a range of the best crypto wallets so you can choose the best cryptocurrency wallet for you. Is Hardware ETH Wallet Worth Investing in? Hardware wallets are ideal for users who hold a large amount of cryptocurrency and want an additional layer of security to keep their funds safe. A hardware wallet is a small portable device that can be connected to access your funds. With a hardware Ethereum wallet, your information is kept securely offline which makes your ETH less susceptible to cyber attacks. Choosing the best hardware crypto wallet can be difficult with a wide range available and it is important that you purchase one from a trusted vendor. Otherwise your wallet could come preloaded with viruses and you could lose your ether. We\u2019ve included some of the top ethereum hardware wallets in our list. Once you purchase a hardware wallet it will be shipped to you for setup. Some hardware wallets will connect you to their website to set up your hardware wallet but others can involve an extensive knowledge of blockchain technology. Your private key will be secured by a pin or passphrase. This means that if anyone else gains access to your hardware wallet, your funds will remain safe! While a hardware wallet is one of the most secure options out there, the cost of purchasing a hardware wallet is much greater than any software wallet. It also takes longer to move your funds using a hardware wallet and can be inconvenient to use. Is Ethereum Wallet Free? Not every ethereum wallet is free to access and use! There is a cost involved with the hardware of an offline wallet and some online wallets will involve a flat or fixed fee for usage. An ether hardware wallet can cost up to $200 for the device but can be a more secure way of storing your funds. For users who wish to access their funds quickly for trading or store smaller amounts of cryptocurrency, a software wallet will be more convenient and cheaper. Software wallets are available online for much less. Often exchanges will provide their own wallet for a small flat fee or even free. However, often these wallets are custodial meaning that the exchange manages your funds. This makes it important to know that your funds are strongly protected. With CryptoWallet.com, you can be comfortable in the knowledge that all your eth are insured and protected by BitGo, a leading digital asset protection company. We believe we\u2019ve created one of the best free mobile wallets available today! What is the best Ethereum wallet? Every ETH wallet will have unique features and levels of protection. Some wallets emphasize convenience, while others prioritize security above all. The best crypto wallet will be the one that meets your needs. If you want the most secure Ethereum wallet, a hardware wallet is the way to go. These are physical devices that store your keys offline. As a result, they are less vulnerable to hackers or viruses. To fully utilize your assets, you will need to link them to an internet device, which could be inconvenient. As your keys are stored online and you can access your assets from anywhere, software wallets provide far more convenience. They are often simpler to use and set up than hardware wallets. Their constant online connection, on the other hand, leaves them more vulnerable to cyberattacks.\n\nRead More:\n\nBest USDT Wallet\n\nBest Bitcoin wallet"

        "title": "How Is Ethereum Liquid Staking Doing in 2023? CoinGecko Report - DeFi - Altcoin Buzz",
        "content": "Remember the times when Ethereum was a proof-of-work Blockchain? Well, if you\u2019ve been keeping tabs on the crypto space, you\u2019d know that those days are long gone.\n\nToday, you can stake $ETH directly on its new chain.\n\nWhat is Ethereum Liquid Staking?\n\nEthereum Liquid Staking refers to a user staking $ETH, and receiving another token in return. This token is proof that represents your stake. Said token is also known as a Liquid Staking Derivative (LSD).\n\nWith this LSD token, you\u2019re now free to participate in DeFi. You can provide liquidity, deposit the token as collateral, or even transact your token. At any time, the holder of the LSD can withdraw the staked $ETH. To do this, you exchange the LSD token for your initial stake and accrued rewards.\n\nAbove are some examples of LSD protocols. They could be custodial or non-custodial. But the main principle remains. LSD protocols help you unlock the value of your staked assets.\n\nHow Is Ethereum Liquid Staking Doing in 2023?\n\nTo answer this question, we\u2019ll be analyzing the details from CoinGecko\u2019s report here. In short, this has been growing with strength since its inception. Let\u2019s look at how that is so below.\n\n#1 \u2013 Total Staked $ETH Across LSD Protocols\n\nLet\u2019s look at the first bullish sign for this trend. As you can see above, the amount of $ETH staked on LSD protocols have been on a solid uptrend. This is since the launch of Ethereum staking in December 2020.\n\nTo add on, LSD protocols hold a market share of 43.7% for staked $ETH. That\u2019s a pretty huge number. At the end of August 2023, 11.3 million $ETH lies on LSD protocols, with Lido being the dominant player. If you want to learn more about how to stake your $ETH on Lido, you can refer to our previous guide here.\n\n#2 \u2013 $ETH Inflows Across LSD Protocols\n\n2/ Despite $ETH withdrawals being enabled with Shapella, LSD protocols as a whole experienced net $ETH inflows post-upgrade. Yet, there were heavy outflows from @Coinbase and RocketPool on several days. Meanwhile, Lido, the leading LSD player, saw daily net inflows of +18K ETH. pic.twitter.com/vUDc0icvKQ \u2014 CoinGecko (@coingecko) September 26, 2023\n\nIndeed, since LSDs have been created, many of them had large $ETH deposits. Over time, the entire sector has had net inflows. This means that $ETH deposits outweigh withdrawals. In turn, this shows confidence from the crypto space towards LSD protocols.\n\n#3 \u2013 $ETH Staking Rewards For LSD Protocols\n\nAnother bullish sign for the liquid staking trend is the allocation of $ETH rewards. From the above, $ETH rewards for LSD protocols have been on an uptrend. Naturally, you need to stake more $ETH to get more rewards. Again, this uptrend reflects confidence from the public towards LSDs.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about something else interesting in the above chart. You can see that Lido\u2019s $stETH (in teal) is losing dominance. It\u2019s still the market leader though, but its competitors are catching up. This means the space is heating up. Hey, competition\u2019s good for us right? With competition comes innovation, and the space can progress as a whole.\n\n#4 \u2013 Other Bullish Signs\n\nSome other bullish signs that reflect the rise of LSD adoption include:\n\n$ETH validator queues reaching highs of 45 days. In comparison, the exit queue takes 10 days. This shows interest in $ETH staking in general, including that from LSD protocols.\n\nYields from staking $ETH on LSD protocols are expected to decrease. This reflects the increased interest of $ETH staking in general as well. With more people and protocols staking $ETH, yields will naturally decrease.\n\nThe amount of staking fees earned from LSD protocols is on an uptrend. LSD protocols charge a fee when you stake your $ETH with them. Since they\u2019re earning more, this shows that the amount of $ETH staked with them is growing.\n\nFor sure, the signs are clear that Ethereum Liquid Staking is growing. In the next section, we take a look at some projects that are leveraging this trend.\n\nLSDFi Projects \u2013 What Are They?\n\nLSDFi projects focus on the LSD niche. Usually, they use DeFi to increase the value of LSD tokens. In the tweet below, you can see who are the leading LSDFi projects, by Total Value Locked (TVL).\n\n5/ Total Value Locked (TVL) in LSDFi protocols grew 5,870% (58.7X) since January 2023 and has reached $919.3M at the end of August 2023. \ud83d\udcc8 The Top 10 LSDFi Protocols by TVL \ud83d\udc47 pic.twitter.com/53htX8AHmY \u2014 CoinGecko (@coingecko) September 26, 2023\n\nAs you can see, LSDFi projects are gaining adoption as well. That\u2019s because they\u2019re building on a growing trend. In turn, LSDFi could turn out to be a strong niche in today\u2019s crypto market too!\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in learning more about LSDFi projects, we\u2019ve shortlisted some great ones here.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe answer\u2019s clear. Ethereum Liquid Staking is growing with strength. Despite this bear market, we can still tell that many are confident in the future of Ethereum. Aside from that, it\u2019ll be wise to keep tabs on the LSD and LSDFi landscape. As this is a pretty new niche, there are plenty of opportunities to earn yield or to scoop up some gems.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe information discussed by Altcoin Buzz is not financial advice.

Bitwise Ethereum Strategy ETF (AETH) and the Bitwise Bitcoin and Ether Equal Weight Strategy ETF (BTOP) are set to go live on Monday, Oct. 2, 2023.

The Bitwise Bitcoin and Ether Equal Weight Strategy ETF (BTOP) will be able to invest with equal exposure to regulated CME Bitcoin futures and CME Ether futures.\n\nFor both products, Bank of New York Mellon was chosen as the custody provider, with a cumulative expense ratio of 0.85%.\n\nAs covered by U.Today previously, Bitwise also submitted an amended registration request for its hotly anticipated Bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nSegment waiting for SEC verdicts; regulator postponed deadlines yet again\n\nBitwise is among the most crypto-friendly U.S.-incorporated asset management funds. Its NYSE-traded Crypto Industry Innovators ETF (BITQ) crossed $100 million in AUM last July.\n\nThis week the U.S. SEC delayed verdict deadlines for all requests for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) spot-based exchange-traded funds.

JPMorgan\u2019s head of Onyx Digital Assets, Tyrone Lobban, noted that the public Ethereum chain has evolved significantly over time, from the proof-of-work consensus mechanism to proof-of-stake. (The former is more energy-intensive and has made Bitcoin a bete noire of environmentalists, giving ESG-conscious banks reason to prefer the latter.)

        "content": "Metis, an Ethereum Layer 2 network, has proposed migrating its data availability back to the Ethereum mainnet. The move aims to simplify the launch of a decentralized sequencer pool and enhance data availability. The proposal is open for community feedback and will be subject to a Snapshot vote.\n\nMetis, a Layer 2 network built on Ethereum, announced a significant proposal on September 27, 2023. The proposal aims to migrate its data availability mechanism back to the Ethereum mainnet by switching from its current off-chain storage layer to its original Optimistic Rollup architecture. This move is seen as a strategic step to facilitate the launch of the Metis sequencer pool, a groundbreaking decentralized sequencer initiative.\n\nIn the spring of 2022, Metis entered into a partnership with Memo Labs to develop an off-chain storage layer. This collaboration enabled Metis to transact on its Layer 2 network at a lower cost by reducing the amount of data pushed to Layer 1 Ethereum. While this approach has been cost-effective, it has raised concerns about data availability.\n\nData availability is a cornerstone in the blockchain ecosystem. It ensures that all transaction data are readily available for reconstruction by validators and users. The Optimistic Rollup architecture, which Metis originally employed, batches this transaction data to Layer 1, thereby enhancing data availability. The current off-chain storage model, while cost-effective, relies on Memo Labs, a third-party entity, which could potentially compromise the robustness of data availability.\n\nMetis aims to become the first Layer 2 network to decentralize its sequencer by launching a first-of-its-kind sequencer pool. This move would eliminate the single-point-of-failure risk associated with relying on a single sequencer entity. It would also open up new staking opportunities for METIS token holders, who would need to stake METIS to become eligible sequencers.\n\nSwitching to the Optimistic Rollup architecture would offer several benefits:\n\n* Simplification of the Metis architecture, thereby facilitating the sequencer pool's launch.\n\n* Enhanced data availability, which is crucial for the sequencer pool.\n\n* Decentralization and security upgrades through the sequencer pool.\n\nHowever, the move comes with a trade-off: Metis would lose its current cost advantage, as transaction fees would align with those of other Layer 2 networks.\n\nThe proposal is currently open for community feedback. Once a consensus is reached, it will proceed to the Snapshot stage for a community vote. If the vote garners a 51% \"YES,\" Metis will implement the proposed changes. The community also has the option to revert to the off-chain storage model after the sequencer pool's successful launch, subject to further evaluation and voting.\n\nDisclaimer & Copyright Notice: The content of this article is for informational purposes only and is not intended as financial advice.

Cointelegraph reached out to Galaxy but did not immediately receive a response.\n\nWith the Sept. 29 filing, Invesco and Galaxy join a growing line of investment managers seeking regulatory approval for a spot ETH ETF. On Sept. 27, the SEC delayed decisions on previous applications from ARK 21Shares and VanEck, extending the deadline until Dec. 25\u201326. \u201cThe Commission finds it appropriate to designate a longer period within which to take action on the proposed rule change so that it has sufficient time to consider the proposed rule change and the issues raised therein,\u201d said the SEC.\n\nAlthough a spot Ether ETF may not be available for a while, futures-based Ether ETFs should be available as soon as next week. On Sept. 28, investment firms started gearing up to add ETH futures vehicles to their portfolios. VanEck, for instance, published a statement about its upcoming Ethereum Strategy ETF \u2014 tickered EFUT \u2014 which will be listed on the Chicago Board Options Exchange in the coming days.\n\nAnother company debuting a futures crypto ETF is Valkyrie. The asset manager will begin offering exposure to Ether futures through its existing Bitcoin Strategy ETF, now rebranded as Valkyrie Bitcoin and Ether Strategy ETF. A Valkyrie spokesperson told Cointelegraph that the firm\u2019s Bitcoin Strategy ETF will allow investors access to Ether and Bitcoin (BTC) futures \u201cunder one wrapper.\u201d\n\nLikewise, Bitwise submitted an updated prospectus for their equal-weight Bitcoin and Ether futures ETF on Sept. 28, which is also expected to go live next week. According to Seyffart, Proshares also applied and Kelly ETFs partnered with Hashdex to deliver futures Ether ETFs in the coming days.\n\nEther is trading in the green at the time of writing at $1,666, driven by euphoria over the debut of futures ETFs.\n\nMagazine: Are DAOs overhyped and unworkable?

        "content": "ETH\u2019s supply outpaced tokens burned in the last 30 days.\n\nTransaction by new addresses on the blockchain decreased, while active addresses increased.\n\nEthereum\u2019s [ETH] supply has increased over the last 30 days despite the blockchain\u2019s transition to Proof-of-Stake (PoS). This led to speculation that ETH could become deflationary again.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ETHs worth today?\n\nETH will be back\n\nAccording to Benjamin Cowen, ETH may soon return to its deflationary status. He, however, opined that it could take a \u201cmore accommodative monetary policy\u201d to achieve the same.\n\nSince the merge, there has still been more $ETH burned than issued. pic.twitter.com/g2hNbW7I4X \u2014 Benjamin Cowen (@intocryptoverse) September 26, 2023\n\nThis was also one of the objectives behind the 15 September 2022 Merge and the burning mechanism of the EIP-1559.\n\nWhen ETH is considered deflationary, it means that there has been an overall decrease in the ETH token supply. This is usually a result of tokens being burned or completely removed from circulation.\n\nBut when ETH is inflationary, it implies an increase in supply, which seems to be the current state.\n\nPreviously, miners on the Ethereum blockchain ran the execution layer. Also, validators were in charge of the consensus layer. However, the Merge allowed for both layers to unify. This then allowed for the tax on each transaction to be automatically removed from circulation.\n\nNonetheless, Cowen also revealed that the hike in circulation did not help the number of ETH issued to outweigh those burned since the Merge.\n\nOver the last 30 days, the supply of $ETH has gone up. As the tourists leave and demand drops, not as much ETH is burned. I suspect ETH will return to being deflationary again, but it might take more accommodative monetary policy for that to happen. pic.twitter.com/DX8zxIvfFR \u2014 Benjamin Cowen (@intocryptoverse) September 26, 2023\n\nFrom Glassnode\u2019s data, Ethereum\u2019s burn rate, also known as the base fee, has decreased incredibly. At press time, it was 852.95. The metric represents the pace at which ETH is being burned.\n\nBy tracking the base fee, users can gain insight into the deflationary or inflationary pressure on Ethereum, and the effect on the network\u2019s long-term economics. Therefore, the decrease in the base fee confirms the notion that more ETH had been issued than they had been burned lately.\n\nNewbies hide, but others show up\n\nIn another terrain, Santiment showed that ETH\u2019s network growth had tanked. Network growth shows the number of new addresses that transferred a coin or token for the first time. When this metric increases, it means that the project has gained a lot of traction.\n\nOn the other hand, a decrease suggests a decline in adoption. At 36,100, ETH\u2019s decrease in network growth means that new addresses have refrained from making transactions on the Ethereum network.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s ETH\u2019s market cap in BTC\u2019s terms\n\nHowever, active addresses on the Ethereum blockchain increased in the last 24 hours. At the time of writing, the metric had increased to 413,000. The metric indicates the level of crowd interaction with a token.\n\nTherefore, the increase means that the number of unique addresses speculation around ETH and transferring the asset climbed."

        "content": "Share this article URL Copied\n\nThe Ethereum developer community successfully launched a new test network called Holesky today, aiming to enhance testing capabilities for the blockchain\u2019s ecosystem.\n\nHolesky joins the existing Goerli and Sepolia testnets, which function as copies of Ethereum\u2019s main blockchain primarily for testing new applications and smart contracts.\n\nHolesky lauched and the chain is finalizing! Shoutout to all the teams running validators, a beaconchain testnet with 1.46 *million* signing validators is no small feat! Aggregating 3800 BLS signatures per second \ud83e\udd2f https://t.co/ScGlxnVPs3 \u2014 proto.eth (@protolambda) September 28, 2023\n\nHolesky was originally scheduled to launch on September 15, marking the one-year anniversary of Ethereum\u2019s transition to proof-of-stake consensus. However, the testnet failed to go live on that date due to a configuration error.\n\nWith 1.4 million validators, Holesky is positioned to become Ethereum\u2019s largest testnet and address the scalability issues facing the mainnet, which has around 700,000 validators currently.\n\nBy increasing the size of the testnet, developers hope to simulate real-world conditions more accurately. Decentralized apps tested on Holesky should face fewer unexpected hurdles when deployed on the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nEthereum developers eventually expect Holesky to replace Goerli, which is slated for sunset in early 2024. Goerli\u2019s capped supply of testnet ether (gETH) led to shortages this year, causing gETH prices to briefly spike above $1.60. Holesky launched with a more abundant 1.6 billion ETH supply to avoid similar access issues."

        "content": "Bitcoin and other crypto tokens were trading mixed on Thursday as s rising interest rates and macroeconomic factors made market sentiments jittery. US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler continued his combative stance against crypto in congressional testimony on Wednesday.\n\n\n\nBitcoin managed to post some gains as the largest crypto token added about half-a-per cent but managed to hover around $26,500-levels. However, its largest peer, Ethereum, inched up about a per cent to once again top $1,600-mark. Price action in the altcoins remained on the mixed side.\n\n\n\nBitcoin is currently priced above the $26,300 mark. This surge coincides with the US dollar index achieving a new 10-month high at 106.48. Meanwhile, Ethereum has been hovering around the $1,600 threshold. In other news, Ethereum has reached a remarkable milestone by surpassing $10 billion in revenue within seven years, said Edul Patel, Co-Founder & CEO at Mudrex.\n\n\n\nAll top crypto tokens were trading mixed on Thursday. Among the gainers, Toncoin jumped more than 2 per cent each, while Solana added about a per cent each. On the contrary, Litecoin, XRP and Polygon shed about a per cent each, while BNB and Dogecoin were down half-a-per cent each.\n\n\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market cap was trading slightly higher, falling to $1.05 trillion-mark, as it rose about half-a-per cent in the last 24 hours. However, the total trading volumes rallied more than 48 per cent to $28.87 billion.\n\n\n\nBitcoin showed a small pump in the last 24-hours for a brief period before facing resistance at its 50-DEMA. The markets are calling for a $30,000 level for BTC soon. However, a support level at $26,000 has to be maintained to expect an upside movement in the short term, said Shubham Hudda, Senior Manager at CoinSwitch Markets Desk.\n\n\n\n\"Terra's LUNA has been pumping. This price action is being attributed to LUNA\u2019s community passing a proposal that makes them move away with the minting of new USTC stablecoins, which was the supposed-to-be stable coin of the Terra Luna ecosystem,\" he added. \"This is happening in the wake of its founder Do Kwon's lawyers having replied to his extradition request from the US authorities.\"\n\n\n\nImage: Crypto-chart-price\n\n\n\nTech View by WazirX Trade Desk\n\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) is a decentralized cryptocurrency designed as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system, striving to establish itself as a reliable global currency with swift transactions, minimal fees, enhanced privacy features, and an increased block size.

        "content": "Want to jump straight to how to buy Wrapped Ethereum (WETH)? You can buy ETH on eToro, Webull or Robinhood and swap it for WETH.\n\nAre you looking to make an offer on the non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace OpenSea? Or do you want to stake WETH in a yield farming platform? To do so, you will first need to buy WETH, the wrapped version of Ether (WETH). Wrapped ETH (WETH) has a wider range of use cases than ETH.\n\nget started Limited Time Offer: Trade $100, Get $10 Buy $100 worth of crypto and get a $10 bonus! get started Disclosure: eToro supports the following currencies: BTC, ADA, DASH, DOGE, EOS, ETH, LTC, NEO, XLM, XTZ, TRX, ZEC. eToro USA LLC; Investments are subject to market risk, including the possible loss of principal. T&Cs apply. *The bonus is available to Benzinga readers in the US for open states only. Served by eToro USA LLC. Show More\n\nWhat is the Difference Between WETH and ETH?\n\nEther (ETH) is the native token of the Ethereum blockchain. If you are looking to use the ERC-20 standard of ETH, you may need to turn your ETH into WETH. This guide shows you how to buy Wrapped Ethereum (WETH).\n\nWhat is WETH?\n\nWrapped Ethereum (WETH) is an ERC-20 token pegged to Ethereum\u2019s native token ETH. The ERC-20 token standard allows for the capability of smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. A smart contract is a computer program that enforces the terms of an agreement. ERC-20 tokens allow for all kinds of things. Since both are pegged to Ethereum, ETH and WETH have the same price. If you want to access a service paid for using an ERC-20 token, you need to wrap your ETH. Some platforms automatically swap it for you as a first step in the transaction, but in other cases, you need to do it yourself. WETH is the tradable version of ETH and is frequently used on decentralized finance (DeFi) and decentralized application (dApp) platforms.\n\nBrief History of WETH\n\nWETH launched in 2017 and was pegged to ETH. ETH is the second largest cryptocurrency in the world and may even contest Bitcoin for the top spot. You can check out ETH\u2019s price history here.\n\nETH is unable to be exchanged directly with ERC-20 tokens that live on the Ethereum blockchain. To exchange ETH for these tokens you first wrap it, creating WETH. One of the main reasons WETH was created in the first place was to use dApps in the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nHow to Buy WETH\n\nBefore you learn how to buy WETH, you need ETH.\n\nStep 1: Open an Online Account.\n\nStep 1: Open an Online Account\n\nThe first step in getting WETH is to open an account on a crypto exchange to purchase ETH. To open an account, you\u2019ll need to provide things such as:\n\nYour full legal name\n\nYour address\n\nYour phone number and email address\n\nA government-issued ID (includes driver\u2019s license, passport or military ID)\n\nA password of your choice\n\nDepending on the exchange, you may need to provide more personal info. It's a good idea to have the information ready to go when opening an account. Most exchanges allow you to open an account in as little as a few minutes; however, some exchanges may take longer to verify your ID. Once your identity has been verified, you\u2019re ready to begin investing.\n\nPurchase ETH. Being the second largest cryptocurrency by market cap, many popular crypto trading platforms support Ethereum. Some of your best options include eToro, Webull and Robinhood Markets Inc. (NASDAQ: HOOD).\n\nStep 2: Buy or Download a Wallet (Optional).\n\nTo obtain WETH, you\u2019ll need a wallet that supports the token. You can choose from two main types of crypto wallets: hardware wallets and software wallets. Software wallets are often easier and faster to use but are less secure than their hardware counterparts. Some of the best options for software wallets on the market right now are the Exodus wallet and MetaMask. Then, you will be able to obtain WETH by connecting your wallet to a decentralized exchange (DEX) like Uniswap and swapping your ETH for WETH in a liquidity pool.\n\nBest Hardware Wallet: Ledger\n\nLedger is one of the top hardware wallets on the market. It is easy to use and supports sending and receiving WETH. Once you have purchased a Ledger hardware wallet, you download its software onto your computer and create an account.\n\nYou\u2019ll be assigned a wallet address (typically a long string of letters and numbers), and then you can send and receive thousands of cryptocurrencies through the wallet. Hardware wallets offer an extra level of security as opposed to software wallets, but they cost money, while software wallets are typically free. Additionally, Ledger provides the convenience of connecting to software wallets such as MetaMask to check your account balance while maintaining absolute custody of your wallet address.\n\nBest Software Wallet: MetaMask\n\nBest For: Ethereum wallet securely through MetaMask's website Get Started with MetaMask\n\nMetaMask is a free and widely used online wallet for Ethereum. It\u2019s available as an extension on Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Brave and Microsoft Edge browsers. It also has an app on iOS and Android phones.\n\nAllows you to swap ETH for WETH directly in the wallet.\n\nClick the wallet extension icon in upper right-hand of Google Chrome.\n\nClick Swap.\n\nSwap as much ETH for WETH as you'd like to.\n\nStep 3: Swap for WETH Through a DEX\n\nLaunch Uniswap.\n\nConnect your wallet with the \u201cConnect Wallet\u201d button in the upper right-hand corner.\n\nSelect ETH on the top and WETH on the bottom as shown below.\n\nEnter the desired amount of ETH you'd like to swap for WETH.\n\nPress Wrap, complete the transaction in the wallet window and in a few seconds your WETH should show up in your wallet\n\nNote: If you don't see your WETH after the swap goes through, you may need to add the token to MetaMask (or whichever wallet you are using). To do this all you need to do is scroll down in the Assets tab in the MetaMask window and click import tokens. You can either search for WETH there or copy and paste the token address from a site like CoinMarketCap.\n\nTrade, Sell or Convert Your ETH to WETH\n\nDeciding on whether to trade, sell or convert your crypto is based on your personal goals and preferences. If you are looking to take profits on WETH, a common strategy is to sell a portion of your WETH on the way up and keep a portion to hold long term to eliminate some risk. Most exchanges allow you to sell your crypto for cash or trade it for USDC, a stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar. If you are trying to accumulate more crypto long term, taking profits when crypto prices go up could allow you to accumulate more when prices go back down.\n\nBy following the steps above, you can convert your ETH to WETH using Uniswap. If you are looking to place an offer on OpenSea, you will need to convert your ETH to WETH. If you want to sell your WETH for cash, it's easiest to first convert it back to ETH.\n\nCurrent Crypto Prices\n\nSince reaching all-time highs in November 2021, crypto prices have dropped. In November 2021, Bitcoin saw its all-time high of over $69,000, and Ethereum saw its all-time high of over $4,800. However, in June of 2022, Bitcoin and Ethereum hit multi-year lows. Bitcoin went to $17,601.58, and Ethereum reached $883.15. In 2023, both tokens have been able to rally, putting Bitcoin around $25,000 and Ethereum around $1,700. Crypto prices seem to be holding on macro levels.\n\nIs WETH a Good Investment?\n\nWETH can be a good investment if you are looking to have tradable ETH to do things like make bids on OpenSea. However, since it is pegged to the price of ETH, its price will follow suit. To read more about if ETH is a good investment please visit here.\n\nClaim Now Get up to $200 in rewards with Coinbase!

The pattern has a minimum of two candlesticks and consists of a mother bar (the first candlestick in the pattern) followed by one or more subsequent candles. The subsequent candle(s) must be completely inside the range of the mother bar, and each is called an \"inside bar.\"\n\nA double, or triple inside bar can be more powerful than a single inside bar. After the break of an inside bar pattern, traders want to watch for high volume for confirmation the pattern was recognized.\n\nWant direct analysis? Find me in the BZ Pro lounge! Click here for a free trial.\n\nThe Bitcoin Chart: Bitcoin regained the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) on Thursday, which has been acting as heavy resistance since July 26. On Friday, the stock was consolidating above the 50-day SMA and forming an inside bar, which is bullish for price action over the weekend.\n\nBullish traders want to see Bitcoin break up from Thursday\u2019s mother bar on higher-than-average volume, which could confirm a new uptrend. If that happens, the crypto is likely to find resistance at the 200-day SMA.\n\nBearish traders want to see big bearish volume come in and knock Bitcoin back under the 50-day, which would suggest Thursday\u2019s price action was a bull trap and the downtrend will continue.\n\nBitcoin has resistance above at $27,133 and at $28,690 and support below at $25,772 and at $24,206.\n\nLike Bitcoin, Ethereum and Dogecoin have been unable to negate their downtrends with the formation of either a higher high or a higher low. If the cryptos retrace over the weekend but hold above the moving averages that were mentioned, higher lows will form, which would set Ethereum and Dogecoin into possible uptrends.\n\nEthereum has resistance above at $1,717 and at $1,825 and support below at $1,615 and at $1,564.\n\nDogecoin has resistance above at $0.061 and at $0.065 and support below at 6 cents and at the $0.057 mark.\n\nRead Next: EXCLUSIVE: Yusko Calls Out Warren Buffett, 'The Reason Warren Wants To P--- On Bitcoin Is...'\n\nPhoto: Shutterstock"

        "title": "Microsoft AI's Jaw-Dropping Top Three Crypto Predictions: Everlodge (ELDG), Ethereum (ETH), Filecoin (FIL) - Finbold - Finance in Bold",
        "content": "Press Releases are sponsored content and not a part of Finbold's editorial content. For a full disclaimer, please click here. If you encounter any issues, kindly report them to [email protected]. Crypto assets/products can be highly risky. Never invest unless you\u2019re prepared to lose all the money you invest.\n\nMicrosoft AI has now unveiled its top three crypto predictions, and they are Ethereum (ETH), Filecoin (FIL), and Everlodge (ELDG). According to it, these tokens show positive market trends, adoption rates, and technological advancements. So, if you\u2019re looking for the next big crypto opportunities, read on to find out what makes these tokens appealing.\n\nSummary\n\nEthereum open interest on the rise\n\nFilecoin partners up with Brave\n\nEverlodge to solve long-standing real estate market issues\n\nJoin the Everlodge presale and win a luxury holiday to the Maldives\n\nEthereum (ETH): Open Interest Soars\n\nMicrosoft AI\u2019s selection of Ethereum (ETH) as a top token for the upcoming year aligns with the growing interest and activity surrounding this leading blockchain platform. In recent Ethereum news, data indicates a surge in interest in its derivatives, with open interest soaring by 4.1% to an impressive $5B on September 25th.\n\nFurthermore, the trading volume for Ethereum derivatives has experienced a remarkable 332% increase, surging to $10.35B. This surge in derivatives activity shows the significance of Ethereum in the crypto ecosystem, highlighting its relevance not just for developers but also for traders and investors.\n\nMarket analysts are closely watching Ethereum at the moment. They forecast that the Ethereum price will range from $2,048.41 to $2,335.71 within the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nFilecoin (FIL): New Partnership With Brave\n\nFilecoin (FIL) is another top token picked by Microsoft AI. This pick is supported by its involvement in a high-profile partnership to enhance privacy features for the Brave browser. To clarify, in collaboration with Zcash developer Electric Coin Company (ECC), the Filecoin Foundation is set to introduce innovative privacy features.\n\nThese features will leverage the Zcash protocol\u2019s shielded transactions for enhanced privacy and security. Additionally, the partnership will further harness the power of Filecoin\u2019s InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) to improve the Brave browser\u2019s decentralized nature.\n\nAs per Microsoft AI, this strategic collaboration positions Filecoin as a critical player in developing privacy-focused technologies. Regarding price predictions, market analysts are keeping a close eye on its potential, and they forecast the Filecoin price to reach $5.46 by December 2023.\n\nEverlodge (ELDG): Transforming Real Estate with Blockchain\n\nEverlodge (ELDG), a rising star in the crypto world, has also piqued the curiosity of Microsoft AI. This groundbreaking property marketplace has set its sights on revolutionizing the real estate market. By leveraging blockchain technology, Everlodge aims to solve long-standing issues such as transparency, liquidity, and accessibility in the real estate sector.\n\nFor instance, traditional real estate investment is often reserved for the wealthy due to high entry costs. Everlodge eliminates this barrier by allowing fractional ownership of properties. By digitizing and minting hotels and villas into NFTs that are then fractionalized, investors can buy fractions of properties, making real estate investment accessible.\n\nHey, Lodgers! :house_with_garden:\n\n\n\nDo you know? :thinking_face:\n\nWith $ELDG, enjoy the warmth of passive income, monthly surprises, and exclusive club access.\n\nPlus, who can resist sweet discounts?\n\n\n\nDive into a token that feels like home. :blue_heart:\n\n\n\nJoin the presale: https://t.co/kIufYkD05d#Presale pic.twitter.com/9yzt5hZhul \u2014 Everlodge (@EverlodgeHQ) September 26, 2023\n\nAdditionally, Everlodge lending is a pioneering feature that facilitates property developers in raising capital from the community for new real estate developments. This unique approach benefits developers by providing them with a source of funding and opens doors for users to participate in promising projects at their early stages.\n\nDue to all these reasons, Microsoft AI claims that Everlodge is the token to watch in 2023. It also has real-world ties to the $4.5T worth of hospitality industry. The ELDG native token is now worth just $0.019 as it is in Stage 4 of its presale. In fact, experts foresee a 30x pump on its launch day after a Tier-1 CEX listing.\n\nFind out more about the Everlodge (ELDG) Presale\n\nWebsite: https://www.everlodge.io/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/everlodge"

The novel concept lets users secretly re-mint the ETH they previously burned by furnishing cryptographic proofs without exposing transaction details.\n\nIf implemented, the provable burn-and-remint process would facilitate a privacy-preserving Ether subset. Ethereum leaders believe the technology holds promise for introducing confidential transactions without compromising security.\n\nIn other updates, auditing continues for code changes as the Shanghai upgrade draws nearer. Tentatively slated for early 2023, Shanghai will implement low-risk improvements while more complex merges are refined."

        "content": "The crypto market turned bullish on Thursday as traders capitalized on the hype growing around exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Ethereum price repositioned itself above $1,600 support and climbed sharply toward $1,700 but stalled on hitting $1,670.\n\nThe second-largest crypto is up 3% on Friday to $1,648, with $12.2 billion in trading volume streaming in, although its market capitalization still hovers slightly below the $200 billion mark.\n\nadvertisement\n\nValkyrie\u2019s Application To Seek Exposure To Ethereum Futures Contracts Approved\n\nValkyrie, the company specializing in alternative asset management with a focus on the intersection of the cryptocurrency market and traditional finance, has received the green light to start seeking exposure to Ether futures contracts within its operational Bitcoin futures ETF product.\n\n\u201cToday, the Valkyrie Bitcoin Strategy ETF (Nasdaq: $BTF) began adding exposure to Ether futures contracts, making it the first US ETF to provide exposure to Ether and Bitcoin futures contracts under one wrapper,\u201d a spokesperson said in a written statement to CoinDesk.\n\nAccording to the spokesperson, Valkyrie beat other investment firms in the race to offer ETH futures ETF because it \u201csupplemented its prospectus and updated risk disclosures related to Ether futures.\u201d\n\nThis new approval means that Valkyrie will offer the two distinct futures contracts in one ETF product starting October 3. The product\u2019s name will change to Valkyrie Bitcoin and Ether Strategy ETF, and trade under the same ticker BTF.\n\nMeanwhile, another asset management firm, VanEck confirmed on Thursday the imminent launch of its VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF (EFUT).\n\n\u201cThe Fund will invest in standardized, cash-settled ETH futures contracts traded on commodity exchanges registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC),\u201d VanEck via a press release.\n\nShares of the actively managed fund will trade on the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE). However, VanEck did not say when exactly the listing will take place.\n\nNEW: Ether futures ETFs could be trading as early as Tuesday as SEC looks to speed things up in order to get it done bf looming shutdown, just like they sped up delays on spot bitcoin ETFs. If so, issuers likely in mad scramble as we speak to update docs. Stay tuned. @JSeyff pic.twitter.com/onTpS3r53m \u2014 Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) September 28, 2023\n\nEthereum Price Flaunts Impending Cup and Handle Breakout\n\nEthereum price wobbled a lot in September with little upside action due to the seller congestion between $1,650 and $1,710. There have been frequent dips below $1,600 support where ETH has tested support areas at $1,530 (a price level seen last in March) and the most recent support at $1,564.\n\nThe futures ETF-driven rebound boosted Ethereum price above $1,600, affirming the level as a short-term support but its momentum faded on touching $1,670. On the bright side, ETH holds above all three applied moving averages, including the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) (red), the 100-day EMA (blue), and the 200-day EMA (purple).\n\nA cup and handle pattern formed since the beginning of September is on the verge of a breakout likely to propel Ethereum to $1,785. To achieve this target, bulls must bring down the resistance at $1,670 (the pattern\u2019s neckline resistance) to validate the cup and handle.\n\nNew long positions should be opened slightly above the neckline with the stop loss at $1,650 or the 200 EMA currently at $1,635. The bullish outlook from the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator shows that buyers have the upper and the path with the least resistance is to the upside.\n\nRelated Articles"

Most seem to believe the Ethereum price could reach high four figures, or around $8000, by the end of 2023. Many believe the general trend of crypto adoption around the world will carry the overall crypto market, including Ethereum, higher and higher each year.\n\nEthereum price prediction 2024\n\nCopy link to section\n\nWhat will Ethereum be worth in 2024? It\u2019s believed that the price of Ethereum may dip below $8000 in 2024. Reasons for this vary but it seems to point to a potential bear Ethereum market or a consolidation period. After that, though, the ETH price prediction starts to turn back upwards for a bull run after that period of consolidation.\n\nEthereum price prediction 2025\n\nCopy link to section\n\nWhat will Ethereum be worth in 2025? By 2025 the Ethereum price could be around $14,000. By then, the Ethereum blockchain could be host to a huge range of businesses and that the total crypto market capitalisation could be well over $10 trillion.\n\nEthereum price prediction 2030\n\nCopy link to section\n\nWhat will Ethereum be worth in 2030? By the end of 2030 it\u2019s generally accepted that the Ethereum price could reach $30,000.

Any Ethereum forecast assumes that it continues to maintain its position as the primary blockchain network, and that the smart contract functionality continues to improve to attract new people, businesses, and developers to create on the network.\n\nHere are the key factors that affect the Ethereum price.\n\nThe fundamentals\n\nCopy link to section\n\n\u2018Fundamental\u2019 factors refer to the underlying reasons why people might want to use Ethereum technology.\n\nThe Ethereum network has helped to revolutionise the crypto space, providing a home for decentralised applications that can bring a large number of everyday tasks onto the blockchain. The largest sector is decentralised finance (DeFi), where apps built on Ethereum offer financial services, such as loans, interest payments, and lending.\n\nPlenty of other crypto sectors are primarily based on the Ethereum blockchain, including crypto gaming (GameFi) and some metaverse platforms. As the largest blockchain network that boasts smart contract functionality, Ethereum allows developers a great deal of freedom in creating a code base that can support a large volume of users on a complex system.\n\nFor the consensus Ethereum price prediction to be accurate over the long term, it needs to maintain its place as the dominant blockchain network. It needs to continue developing its technology, so that it becomes more scalable. The Ethereum merge helped towards this goal by reducing gas fees and ensuring the network can process more transactions.\n\nOther smart contract blockchains, like Polkadot, Solana, and Cardano, are poised to challenge Ethereum\u2019s dominance and put a dent in its market cap if it slacks on any of these issues.\n\nThe technicals\n\nCopy link to section\n\nTechnical analysis involves studying the Ethereum price history using various chart indicators to try and predict what the ETH price will do over a period of time. Technical analysis can be useful in finding the right time to buy or sell an asset, and it is these chart impacts that usually guide the Ethereum price fluctuations in the short term.\n\nYou can use these analysis techniques to try to judge whether Ethereum\u2019s price is under or overvalued, and thus whether it represents a good time to buy or not.\n\nThe Moving Average, for example, is an indicator that can show the median price of a specific number of candles on a candle chart. Another technical skill is to take notice of an asset\u2019s trading volume. Traders can use volume to monitor its activity and predict whether a move to the downside or upside may kick in soon.\n\nEthereum price history\n\nCopy link to section\n\nThe Ethereum price has followed the same pattern as many other cryptocurrencies, in that it surged to all time highs in late 2021 before falling off in 2022. In 2020 it hit a low of about $85 and a little over a year later was trading at over $4000. The chart below shows how its price has changed over time.\n\nSource: Tradingview\n\nKey levels to watch\n\nCopy link to section\n\nDepending on the market sentiment the Ethereum price could reach lows of around $3000 before ranging until mid to late 2023 and breaking its all-time high of $4,878 after that.\n\nThis relies on the performance of the American and western financial markets as well as levels of inflation in \u2018fiat\u2019 currencies (such as the US Dollar), and interest rate rises in traditional finance markets. Although they\u2019re not directly crypto-related, the performance of the stock market can influence the price of cryptocurrency assets because so many institutions are now involved in crypto.\n\nEthereum\u2019s low $2000 range during the May 2021 crash could be a psychological support level that the market will be eyeing closely if there was to be another similar event. A $2000 and $4000 bracket would be a reasonable range for the ETH price to consolidate in after a rise before breaking on up above its all time high.\n\nIs ETH a good long term investment?\n\nCopy link to section\n\nWhether Ethereum 2.0 will be successful or not will determine the accuracy of these Ethereum forecasts. There are many potential \u201cEthereum killers\u201d in the market but none have come close to toppling the giant. If Ethereum fails to solve its scaling issues, then other coin\u2019s will fight for the top spot underneath Bitcoin. Hopefully, Ethereum 2.0 will be a success and live up to its promises.\n\nThe market overall will go through many peaks and troughs. The troughs may last months and the peaks could be short-lived, but the general trajectory of the overall market is likely to be upwards.\n\nAll Ethereum needs to do is build and continue to be the capital of DeFi. If you\u2019re a believer that the Ethereum team can deliver ETH2 effectively, then investing in Ethereum will be a great long-term investment for years to come.\n\nKey takeaways\n\nCopy link to section\n\nThere is no guarantee that these Ethereum price predictions may come true. Every Ethereum price forecast should be taken with a grain of salt. The crypto market is ever-changing, and nobody can be spot on with their predictions for such a long-time frame. Despite this, it\u2019s generally accepted that the Ethereum price can reach $6000 soon, and then $10,000 shortly afterwards.\n\nWhat is Ethereum worth in 2023? The Ethereum (ETH) price has ranged between $1,000 and $2,000 in 2024. Ethereum prices move all the time, but have stayed within that range for the majority of 2024. What is Ethereum\u2019s all time high? ETH\u2019s all time high is $4951. It reached its maximum price in November 2021. In December of the same year it almost reached that level again but has fallen off since. Can Ethereum reach $10,000 Yes. According to analyst forecasts Ethereum\u2019s price will be $10,000 between 2024 \u2013 2025. What will Ethereum be worth in 2030? $30,000 is the forecasted price a number of experts have given for 2030. What are Ethereum\u2019s key price levels? Its all time high at $4950 is a strong level that will have the attention of traders and analysts. Round levels such as $2000, $3000, and $4000 are also important levels to keep an eye on. Is now a good time to buy Ethereum? It could be. If you agree with the analyst predictions on this page then buying Ethereum in 2023 could be a good idea. All leading experts believe its price will rise with some predicting substantial gains in the coming years. Buying now could be a good way to ride the anticipated bull trend.\n\nSources & references Our editors fact-check all content to ensure compliance with our strict editorial policy.

        "content": "In the last seven days, Ethereum outperformed Bitcoin , rising 5 per cent to $1,673.84 as compared to a 1.66 per cent jump in the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalisation. According to experts, this was due to the increasing likelihood of Ethereum futures gaining approval from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\n\"This was a trend reversal, as the possibilities for an ETH Futures ETF getting approval became higher, leading to a surge in prices,\" said Parth Chaturvedi, investments lead at CoinSwitch Ventures.\n\nAdditionally, according to Edul Patel, co-founder and chief executive officer of Mudrex, \"This positive price movement could be attributed to Valkyrie Funds LLC, an investment manager, receiving regulatory approval from the SEC to introduce Ethereum futures to its existing Bitcoin futures exchange-traded fund.\"\n\nApart from Ethereum, almost all major crypto coins traded within a narrow range over the past week.\n\n\"It's worth noting that the SEC has postponed its decision on Bitcoin ETFs from Blackrock, Bitwise, Invesco, and Valkyrie. These delays occurred two weeks ahead of the expected deadline of 16\u201319 October,\" said the CoinDCX research team.\n\nThe market was also muted due to the rise in treasury bond rates and household mortgage rates. There was uncertainty around inflation, and the US Federal Reserve indicated that it may continue to raise rates for longer than anticipated.\n\n\"There's also a looming uncertainty about the Federal Reserve's interest rate hike, which is creating a cautious approach in the market,\" said Rajagopal Menon, vice president at WazirX.\n\nHe added that the market also looks bearish due to the possibility of a US government shutdown. Notably, if funding is not approved, the US government will shut down on 1 October, leaving millions without their salaries.\n\nIf that occurs, regulatory developments in the Web3 ecosystem may be further delayed, Menon said.\n\n\"The main event to watch out for is the weekly and monthly options expiry this Friday, with $4.8 billion worth of Bitcoin and Ethereum options expiring on key derivatives exchange Deribit. Option traders remain uncertain about the directional momentum in prices,\" Chaturvedi added.\n\nMeanwhile, Coinbase received regulatory approval in Bermuda to offer crypto derivatives (Perps) to non-US retail clients globally."

        "content": "Shiba Inu (SHIB) Adoption Surges, Ethereum (ETH) Hits New Milestone, and Everlodge (ELDG) Enters Exciting Stage 4 of Presale!\n\nDigital currencies, or cryptocurrencies, continually expand into new areas. As they do, they make headlines. Shiba Inu (SHIB) is breaking new ground in its adoption processes, Ethereum (ETH) marks a significant financial milestone, and Everlodge (ELDG) is capturing the attention of investors as it advances through its presale stages. The following article will explore these exciting developments and what they mean for crypto.\n\nJoin the Everlodge presale and win a luxury holiday to the Maldives\n\nShiba Inu (SHIB): Sheds Light on Solar Payments\n\nIn a groundbreaking move, Texans can now pay their solar panel bills using Shiba Inu (SHIB). This newfound utility emerged through a partnership between FCF Pay and Chariot Energy, a Houston-based solar energy company. The collaboration marks a significant step towards mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies like the Shiba Inu coin in practical applications.\n\nHowever, FCF Pay also clarified that this feature is only available in Texas and does not insulate users from dangers. Nevertheless, as more real-world use cases for Shiba Inu unfold, it demonstrates the growing acceptance of digital assets.\n\nAnalysts\u2019 predictions for the Shiba Inu price reaching $0.00001078 by the end of 2023 reflect the increasing interest and adoption in the SHIB ecosystem.\n\nEthereum (ETH): Celebrates $10B in Cumulative Revenue\n\nThe crypto giant Ethereum (ETH) recently achieved a mini turning point. Since its launch in 2015, it surpassed $10B in cumulative revenue. This achievement shows the incredible success and widespread adoption of Ethereum\u2019s blockchain technology, a revolutionary technology in the world of dApps.\n\nAdditionally, Ethereum\u2019s rapid growth has outpaced significant tech giants like Microsoft Corp and Adobe Inc. They took 19 and 20 years to achieve similar revenue milestones, respectively.\n\nAs Ethereum continues to grow, market analysts are closely monitoring its price. Some of them have even made a bullish Ethereum price prediction. They suggest the Ethereum price could range between $2,048.41 and $2,335.71 within Q4 of 2023, further solidifying its position as a dominant force in the crypto space.\n\nEverlodge (ELDG): Soars Through Presale Stages\n\nEverlodge (ELDG), the blockchain-based real estate platform, is making significant strides in its presale. As it enters Stage 4, investor interest grows as the ELDG native token has already provided early buyers a 90% ROI. Essentially, Everlodge offers solutions to longstanding challenges in the real estate market.\n\nFor instance, one of the most significant hurdles in real estate investment is the high barrier to entry. Everlodge is breaking down this barrier by fractionalizing real estate assets into NFTs. Through the Everlodge platform, investors can purchase and own fractional shares of hotels, villas, and more for prices as low as $100.\n\nHey, Lodgers! \ud83c\udfe1\n\nDo you know? \ud83e\udd14\n\nWith $ELDG, enjoy the warmth of passive income, monthly surprises, and exclusive club access.\n\nPlus, who can resist sweet discounts?\n\nDive into a token that feels like home. \ud83d\udc99\n\nJoin the presale: https://t.co/kIufYkD05d#Presale pic.twitter.com/9yzt5hZhul \u2014 Everlodge (@EverlodgeHQ) September 26, 2023\n\nNot only that, real estate investments are known for their illiquidity. Selling a property or extracting equity can take weeks. Everlodge addresses this issue by introducing a secondary marketplace for their property-backed NFTs. Investors can buy, sell, or trade these NFTs, providing liquidity never seen in the real estate market.\n\nThe ELDG token now costs only $0.019. What sets ELDG apart is its low market cap, which often allows smaller projects to experience exponential growth. Experts predict that it has the potential to surge by 280% before the conclusion of its presale. This surge would place it on a trajectory that could outpace even Shiba Inu and Ethereum.\n\nFind out more about the Everlodge (ELDG) Presale\n\nWebsite: https://www.everlodge.io/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/everlodge\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH), the most popular cryptocurrency after Bitcoin (BTC), managed to climb above the $1,600 mark for the first time in over a week. BTC, on the other hand, dwelled within the $26,000 range. Other popular altcoins \u2014 including the likes of Dogecoin (DOGE), Solana (SOL), Ripple (XRP), and Litecoin (LTC) \u2014 traded sideways across the board. Bitcoin Cash (BCH) became the biggest gainer, with a 24-hour jump of over 6 percent. The Immutable (IMX) token emerged to be the biggest loser, with a 24-hour dip of nearly 4 percent.\n\nThe global crypto market cap stood at $1.05 trillion at the time of writing, registering a 24-hour gain of 0.32 percent.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) Price Today\n\nBitcoin price stood at $26,342.12, registering a 24-hour gain of 0.29 percent, as per CoinMarketCap. According to Indian exchange WazirX, BTC price stood at Rs 22.65 lakh.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Price Today\n\nETH price stood at $1,603.74, marking a 24-hour jump of 0.57 percent at the time of writing. As per WazirX, Ethereum price in India stood at Rs 1.38 lakh.\n\nDogecoin (DOGE) Price Today\n\nDOGE registered a 24-hour dip of 0.47 percent, as per CoinMarketCap data, currently priced at $0.06044. As per WazirX, Dogecoin price in India stood at Rs 5.23.\n\nLitecoin (LTC) Price Today\n\nLitecoin saw a 24-hour loss of 1.01 percent. At the time of writing, it was trading at $63.30. LTC price in India stood at Rs 5,400.54.\n\nRipple (XRP) Price Today\n\nXRP price stood at $0.4974, seeing a 24-hour dip of 1.01 percent. As per WazirX, Ripple price stood at Rs 42.65.\n\nSolana (SOL) Price Today\n\nSolana price stood at $19.21, marking a 24-hour gain of 1.02 percent. As per WazirX, SOL price in India stood at Rs 1,664.99.\n\nTop Crypto Gainers Today (September 28)\n\nAs per CoinMarketCap data, here are the top five crypto gainers over the past 24 hours:\n\nBitcoin Cash (BCH)\n\nPrice: $229.40\n\n24-hour gain: 6.82 percent\n\nMaker (MKR)\n\nPrice: $1,485.66\n\n24-hour gain: 5.42 percent\n\nTerra Classic (LUNC)\n\nPrice: $0.00006447\n\n24-hour gain: 5.14 percent\n\nChainlink (LINK)\n\nPrice: $7.66\n\n24-hour gain: 4.56 percent\n\nPepe (PEPE)\n\nPrice: $0.0000007358\n\n24-hour gain: 4.35 percent\n\nTop Crypto Losers Today (September 28)\n\nAs per CoinMarketCap data, here are the top five crypto losers over the past 24 hours:\n\nImmutable (IMX)\n\nPrice: $0.5587\n\n24-hour loss: 3.76 percent\n\nCurve DAO Token (CRV)\n\nPrice: $0.5109\n\n24-hour loss: 2.37 percent\n\n1inch Network (1INCH)\n\nPrice: $0.2627\n\n24-hour loss: 2.17 percent\n\nCasper (CSPR)\n\nPrice: $0.03089\n\n24-hour loss: 2.04 percent\n\nMultiversX (EGLD)\n\nPrice: $23.82\n\n24-hour loss: 2.02 percent\n\nWhat Crypto Exchanges Are Saying About Current Market Scenario\n\nShubham Hudda, Senior Manager, CoinSwitch Markets Desk, said, \u201cBitcoin (BTC, +0.3 percent), in the last 24 hours, showed a small pump, breaking over $26,500 for a brief period before facing resistance at its 50-Day Exponential Moving Average (50EMA). The markets are calling for a $30,000 level for BTC soon. However, a support level at $26,000 has to be maintained to expect an upside movement in the short term. On the other hand, the (in)famous coin Terra LUNA or LUNA2 (+20.5 percent) has been pumping. This price action is being attributed to LUNA\u2019s community passing a proposal that makes them move away with the minting of new USTC stablecoins, which was the supposed-to-be stable coin of the Terra Luna ecosystem, UST. This is happening in the wake of LUNA founder Do Kwon's lawyers having replied to his extradition request from the United States authorities.\u201d\n\nRajagopal Menon, Vice President, WazirX, said, \u201cBitcoin and Ethereum have shown recovery in prices. The market dynamics are set to shift as China slowly starts embracing crypto. The US government shutdown might disrupt ongoing plans for interest rates by the Fed, prompting a whole new approach. The government\u2019s decisions on crypto regulations might also see a shift or delay with impending developments.\u201d\n\nSathvik Vishwanath, CEO and co-founder of Unocoin, said, \u201cBitcoin is showing a bullish bias as it has recently failed to hold above $26,750. It bounced off the $26,000 support, a crucial psychological level, on the 4-hour chart. The $26,779 mark formed a strong double-top pattern that acted as resistance. Although it has bounced back from this level, it remains above the $22,000 support. A hold above $26,000 could target $26,750 and potentially $27,450. Leading indicators show mixed sentiment with 50-day EMA around $26,300 and BTC price fluctuating, RSI in the sell zone but MACD presenting bullish signals. The pivotal $26,000 level will dictate Bitcoin's bullish or bearish tendencies for investors to watch closely.\u201d\n\nShivam Thakral, CEO of BuyUcoin, said, \u201cThe overall crypto market cap witnessed a jump of 0.5 percent and touched the $1.5 trillion mark. BTC and ETH witnessed marginal fluctuation in their value and are currently trading at $26,330.60 and $1,603.02 levels respectively. The rate hike fears may keep traders away from riskier assets for some time but the situation may change if macroeconomic factors turn favourable.\u201d\n\nSubscribe And Follow ABP Live On Telegram: t.me/officialabplive\n\nDisclaimer: Crypto products and NFTs are unregulated and can be highly risky.

        "content": "The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is reportedly fast-tracking the launch of Ethereum futures exchange-traded funds (ETFs), with a potential trading debut as early as next week. This comes amid mounting anticipation of a possible US government shutdown.\n\nFirst Ethereum Futures ETF Could Launch Monday\n\nBloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas provided significant insight on this development in a tweet: \u201cUPDATE: Hearing the SEC wants to accelerate the launch of Ether futures ETFs (bc they want it off their plate bf shutdown) so they\u2019ve asked the filers to update their docs by Fri pm (no small task to jam into 48hrs, esp for indie issuers), so they can go eff Mon and trade Tue.\u201d\n\nLooking like the SEC is gonna let a bunch #Ethereum futures ETFs go next week potentially https://t.co/YoBD1d1ay8 \u2014 James Seyffart (@JSeyff) September 28, 2023\n\nHis colleague, Bloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffart, confirmed the sentiment, noting that it\u2019s \u201clooking like the SEC is gonna let a bunch Ethereum futures ETFs go next week potentially.\u201d Although a recent report from Bloomberg had posited that Ethereum futures ETFs held a 90% chance of launching in October, these latest updates seem to reinforce the immediate timeline.\n\nAs per the previous forecast, Valkyrie\u2019s Bitcoin futures ETF (BTF) was set to be the first to incorporate Ethereum exposure on Oct. 3, with a strategy shift that will see the inclusion from Oct. 4. Volatility Shares, another issuer, was anticipated to be the first to exclusively offer Ethereum futures exposure, expected to take effect on Oct. 11, facilitating a launch on Oct. 12. Due to the impending US government shutdown, launch approvals by the SEC could already be pushed forward to next week.\n\nBut as Bloomberg notes, out of the 15 Ethereum futures ETFs filed by nine issuers, not all are expected to be given the green light. Notable issuers in the queue encompass VanEck, ProShares, Grayscale, Volatility Shares, Bitwise, Direxion, and Roundhill.\n\nImplications Of The Decision\n\nScott Johnsson, a finance lawyer at Davis Polk, commented on the SEC\u2019s eleventh-hour approach: \u201cI want everyone to realize Gensler waited until now (giving the issuers 48 hours) because he didn\u2019t want to answer questions about this at the HFSC hearing earlier today. You know, just functional agency things.\u201d\n\nJohnsson highlighted significant ramifications, including the implicit confirmation from Gensler\u2019s SEC that CME ETH futures are not security futures, thereby solidifying Ethereum\u2019s status outside the purview of being a security. The move could lay the groundwork for spot-traded ETFs, as it would mean an approval that SEC Chairman Gensler will not withdraw Bitcoin futures approvals to prevent a spot ETF. Johnson had discussed this possibility in the past.\n\nThe looming US government shutdown, set for 12:01 am ET on Oct. 1 if Congress doesn\u2019t finalize a new fiscal year\u2019s funding, threatens to disrupt operations across federal agencies, including financial regulators. This urgency seems to underscore the SEC\u2019s push for expedited ETF approvals.\n\nThough the Ethereum futures ETFs\u2019 potential introduction has stirred the crypto sphere, it\u2019s crucial to note that the excitement surrounding these instruments doesn\u2019t match the fervor seen for their spot-based counterparts. The US has already hosted Bitcoin futures ETFs since 2021.\n\nAt press time, the ETH price was at $1,609, showing no reaction to the positive news so far.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock, chart from TradingView.com"

        "content": "Project Mariana, an initiative whose goal was to explore the application of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) in enhancing the efficiency and security of cross-border payments, has been successfully concluded, the Bank of France has confirmed.\n\nEven as this pilot comes to an end, one developer notes that the Bank of International Settlements (BIS) reportedly utilized the public Ethereum Sepolia testnet and Curve Finance\u2019s smart contracts as the base of Project Mariana, testing and measuring the efficacy of cross-border Forex automated market maker (AMM) pilot.\n\nThe CBDC project depended on Curve Finance\u2019s code. Even so, the BIS wanted to keep the use of Curve\u2019s framework private. So far, there has been no comment from Curve Finance or any Ethereum core developers regarding Project Mariana\u2019s use of decentralized finance (DeFi) code or architecture.\n\nHowever, looking at Curve Finance\u2019s experience in enabling stablecoin movement and swapping, their expertise could have been valuable. DeFiLlama data on September 28 shows that Curve Finance had over $2.1 billion in total value locked (TVL).\n\nCurve Finance is a decentralized exchange (DEX) for trading stablecoins, tokenized fiat, issued privately by entities such as Circle or Tether Holdings. The protocol depends on an automated market maker (AMM) model to draw liquidity and ensure price discovery at low slippage.\n\nProject Mariana, a platform by the BIS and multiple central banks such as the Bank of France and the Swiss National Bank, used the same architecture for the same goals as in Curve Finance: access liquidity and achieve price discovery.\n\nIt is unclear which versions of Vyper were used to code the smart contracts in this pilot. However, it is worth noting that Curve Finance experienced a hack in late July, resulting in over $60 million loss. This happened due to a vulnerability in older versions of Vyper that was exploited through a re-entrancy attack.\n\nAnti-CBDC Bill Supported By Republicans In The United States\n\nWhile the BIS says central banks should first create a CBDC framework, the anti-CBDC bill, or the CBDC Anti-Surveillance State Act, introduced by pro-crypto Congressman Tom Emmer in February 2023, was recently considered by the House Financial Services Committee on September 20, 2023. The bill is yet to be voted by the full House of Representatives.\n\nIf adopted, the act will bar the Federal Reserve, the US central bank, from issuing a digital version of the dollar. The bill is widely supported by Republicans and opposed by Democrats. Supporters are concerned about abuse, claiming that CBDCs give \u201cgovernments more power and infringe on privacy rights.\u201d\n\nFeature image from Canva, chart from TradingView"

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) is on the spotlight with predictions suggesting it could soon overshadow Bitcoin (BTC) in terms of long-term performance, courtesy of insights shared by prominent crypto analyst and trader Dave the Wave.\n\nWhile this may seem like a bold prediction, Dave the Wave\u2019s analysis offers intriguing insights into the evolving dynamics of the crypto market.\n\nIn a recent post, he emphasized the importance of taking a longer view when assessing the performance of cryptocurrencies. He noted that analyzing a multi-year timeframe reveals a more nuanced picture of the Ethereum-Bitcoin pair. While a shorter timeframe might show a series of lower highs and lows, a broader perspective indicates the potential for a different narrative.\n\nETH/ BTC Careful of [shorter-term] hindsight bias \u2013 it\u2019s a series of lower highs until it\u2019s not. The longer time-frame trumps the shorter\u2026. and helps to predict future price action, which is what speculation is all about, as opposed to simply describing recent past price\u2026 pic.twitter.com/kMrqN3istb \u2014 dave the wave\ud83c\udf0a\ud83c\udf13 (@davthewave) September 29, 2023\n\nEthereum\u2019s Long-Term Perspective\n\nDave the Wave pointed out that the Ethereum-Bitcoin pair seems to be approaching the end of a significant wedge pattern. A wedge pattern is a technical chart pattern characterized by converging trendlines, often signaling a potential breakout in the future. If this pattern holds, it could suggest an upward breakout for Ethereum early next year, potentially altering its trajectory compared to Bitcoin.\n\nIn contrast to Ethereum, Dave the Wave employs his own version of logarithmic growth curves (LGCs) to assess Bitcoin\u2019s long-term market cycles. These curves aim to filter out the noise and volatility that can obscure the bigger picture in cryptocurrency markets.\n\nETHUSD trading at $1,724 today. Chart: TradingView.com\n\nAccording to his analysis using LGCs, Bitcoin is on track to outperform traditional assets like stock indices for at least another decade. He predicts that Bitcoin will continue to grow in value and maintain its status as the primary vehicle for wealth creation. This outlook aligns with the growing acceptance of cryptocurrencies as an alternative asset class with long-term potential.\n\nBitcoin: Current Market Snapshot\n\nAs of the latest data, Bitcoin is trading at $28,072 with a 24-hour gain of 3.3% and a seven-day surge of 7.2%. Ethereum, on the other hand, has a current price of $1,720, boasting a 24-hour increase of 2.4% and a seven-day rally of 9.1%. These figures reflect the ongoing volatility and potential for quick price fluctuations in the crypto market.\n\nDave the Wave\u2019s analysis sparks an interesting discussion about the future of Ethereum and Bitcoin. While Ethereum may be on the cusp of a significant breakout, Bitcoin\u2019s long-term promise remains robust.\n\nCrypto enthusiasts and investors will undoubtedly keep a close eye on these developments, as the battle for dominance in the cryptocurrency space continues to evolve.\n\nFeatured image from Phemex"

        "content": "VanEck, investment manager, is intensifying its promotional activities for its imminent Ether (ETH $1,656) futures exchange-traded fund (ETF), anticipated by some experts to be launched as early as October 2. The firm has recently unveiled two \u201cEnter the Ether\u201d-themed TV commercials, indicating that its Ethereum Strategy ETF, labeled EFUT, is on the horizon.\n\nOn September 28, the commercials were released concurrently with a press statement from VanEck about the forthcoming EFUT. The statement disclosed that the ETF would be listed on the Chicago Board Options Exchange and overseen by Greg Krenzer, the head of active trading at VanEck.\n\nAnalysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart from Bloomberg ETF speculate that the commercials might signify that the launch of Ether futures ETFs is approaching faster than anticipated. Despite documents from September 29 suggesting a 60-day waiting period before the ETF takes effect, Seyffart anticipates a launch on Monday. He attributes this to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) possibly hastening approvals for such financial products.\n\nThe promotional materials from VanEck include a 15-second video with actors maintaining a deadpan expression, accompanied by unusual, alien-like background music. The message \u201cEthereum. Now in an ETF form. Coming soon\u201d is conveyed, followed by another actor stating, \u201cOh, and hodl or fork off,\u201d before concluding with the \u201cEnter the Ether\u201d message.\n\nA second, more conventional 30-second advertisement implies an impending \u201cshift\u201d and suggests that Ethereum\u2019s gravitational pull \u201cwill draw everyone in.\u201d Balchunas anticipates intensified marketing endeavors from other ETF issuers, especially when spot Bitcoin (BTC $26,960) ETFs receive approval.\n\nMoreover, Valkyrie, a financial services firm, has stated that it plans to offer exposure to Ether through its existing Bitcoin Strategy ETF. This move positions Valkyrie as one of the pioneering firms to provide such exposure amidst numerous pending applications with the SEC.\n\nSeyffart, on September 28, hinted at the possibility of the SEC approving several Ethereum futures ETFs in the upcoming week, potentially due to an imminent U.S. government shutdown. Currently, nine issuers have 15 Ether futures ETFs awaiting launch.\n\nAdditionally, the market is bracing for a marketing battle as ETFs gain approval, with multiple issuers launching similar products on the same day. This situation is unprecedented and is expected to reshape the competitive landscape of ETF offerings."

        "title": "Dan Gambardello on Cardano's Market Potential and Comparison to Ethereum - CryptoGlobe",
        "content": "Introduction\n\nCrypto influencer Dan Gambardello, founder of Crypto Capital Venture, recently shared his insights on Cardano (ADA) in a comprehensive video. He explored Cardano\u2019s market position, and technological advancements, and drew several comparisons with Ethereum, highlighting why he believes Cardano is a strong contender in the crypto space.\n\nCardano\u2019s Market Position\n\nGambardello starts by emphasizing that Cardano remains a top-five cryptocurrency, even amidst market volatility. He notes that Cardano is \u201cready to go\u201d for the next bull cycle, maintaining its market position despite bearish sentiment.\n\nCardano and Ethereum: Market Cycles\n\nGambardello draws a parallel between the market cycles of Cardano and Ethereum. He points out that both cryptocurrencies had similar first bull markets, with Ethereum reaching a $125 billion market cap and Cardano close behind at $93 billion. Both also experienced significant drops in their bear markets, with Ethereum falling around 94% and Cardano around 91%.\n\nTechnological Advancements: Cardano vs. Ethereum\n\nGambardello argues that Cardano is not \u201clate to the party\u201d in terms of technological advancements. He cites the launch of Alonzo smart contracts and the emergence of DeFi platforms like Sunday Swap as evidence that Cardano is on a similar but potentially more advanced technological path compared to Ethereum.\n\nTotal Value Locked (TVL) and Staking\n\nDiscussing the concept of Total Value Locked (TVL), Gambardello suggests that if staked ADA were considered in Cardano\u2019s TVL, it would rank much higher. He argues that Cardano\u2019s innovative staking mechanism, which allows ADA to remain in the user\u2019s wallet, should be considered an asset and included in TVL calculations.\n\nMarket Cap Projections\n\nGambardello speculates that even if Cardano doesn\u2019t reach Ethereum\u2019s $546 billion market cap, a more conservative estimate of $350 billion would still result in a $10 ADA. He clarifies that this is not a price prediction but a starting point for discussion.\n\nDeFi and Total Value Locked\n\nGambardello highlights that Ethereum had almost no total value locked (TVL) back in November 2018, just after its first bull market. In contrast, Cardano already has around a million dollars in TVL as of January 2022, thanks to the launch of DeFi platforms like Sunday Swap. He argues that this demonstrates Cardano\u2019s potential to catch up with or even surpass Ethereum in the future.\n\nThe Importance of Staking in TVL\n\nGambardello questions why staked ADA is not considered in Cardano\u2019s TVL. He argues that Cardano\u2019s staking mechanism is innovative and should be included in TVL calculations. He cites a tweet stating that if staked ADA were considered, Cardano would be second in terms of TVL with $5.5 billion.\n\nConclusion\n\nGambardello believes that Cardano is a strong contender in the crypto space for various reasons, including its technological advancements and market resilience. While acknowledging that Cardano has its flaws, he emphasizes that it is doing a great job in terms of security, decentralization, and scalability. He encourages viewers to share their thoughts and subscribe to his channel for more insights.\n\nFeatured Image via Unsplash"

        "content": "Ethereum Classic price prediction stays bullish for the long term till ETC crypto sustains above $14.00. It suggests a significant rise is possible in the coming months.\n\nETC price is trying to break out of the 50-day EMA hurdle to reverse the short-term trend in an upward direction. If buyers succeed then it will increase the probability of reaching the $18.00 level.\n\nEthereum Classic price is forming a double bottom pattern and buyers are trying to break the neckline hurdle.\n\nThe price is below the 200-day EMA so the positional trend is in a downward direction. So, the ETC crypto price needs to break the neckline hurdle as well as the 200-day EMA to regain the confidence of investors.\n\nIn the last few weeks, ETC price traded in a narrow range and formed a strong base. So, the downside risk looks limited. The price pattern of ETC shows that the price is near to the demand zone and minor retracement will be easily bought up.\n\nEthereum Classic price is trading at $15.77 with an intraday decline of 0.24%. The 24-hour volume to market cap ratio is 3.60%.\n\nEthereum Classic Price Looks Cheap at Current Levels\n\nETC/USDT daily chart by TradingView\n\nEthereum Classic price prediction is favoring the bulls and suggests buyers are returning back to track. ETC crypto showed a short-term recovery but the price still lacks positive momentum.\n\nUntil the price breaks the $18.00 hurdle it is expected to continue the consolidation in the existing range. The direction in the ETC crypto will be visible after the $18.00 breakout.\n\nThe price behavior of this crypto is quite stable indicating that the speculators are less active. Therefore, if any breakout attempt comes then the probability of sustaining the higher levels will remain high.\n\nETC Price is Reversing Upward; Genuine Buyers Needed\n\nETC price is reversing upward and buyers are trying their best to rebound. If the crypto leader BTC and ETH price recovers in the coming months. Then it might positively impact the prices of ETC as well as other altcoins.\n\nThe MACD curve is sloping upward and the histogram bar is on the rise. It indicates bulls are getting active and recovery is likely to continue. The RSI at 55 denotes the strength of the bulls and more room for upside is open.\n\nConclusion\n\nEthereum Classic price prediction is bullish for the long term. It formed a strong base near $15.00 so the downside looks limited. The analysis suggests that the ETC price is turning bullish and the possibility of reaching $18.00 by October ends is high.\n\nTechnical levels\n\nResistance levels: $18.00 and $20.43\n\nSupport levels: $15.00 and $13.57\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe views and opinions stated by the author, or any people named in this article, are for informational purposes only.

        "title": "Understanding EIP-4844: Ethereum's Upgrade Focusing On Blobs - Blockzeit",
        "content": "The notoriously high gas fees in the Ethereum blockchain have been one of the greatest deterrents to its mass adoption. However, after the Merge and Shanghai upgrades comes the next big ticket item on Ethereum\u2019s development roadmap, which is the Ethereum Improvement proposal (EIP) 4844, called Proto-sharding.\n\nEIP-4844 introduces a new transaction type called blobs. We explain what EIP-4844 is all about and understand what blobs are.\n\nEthereum Cancun Upgrade\n\nEthereum Cancun-Deneb, also identified as Dencun or EIP-4844, is the new upcoming upgrade to the Ethereum blockchain. The upgrade is aimed at enhancing the network\u2019s scalability, security, and usability.\n\nThe major feature of the upgrade is the inception of Proto-Danksharding, which signifies a changing phase towards full Danksharding. This move is expected to significantly reduce gas fees and increase transaction throughput by utilizing data \u2018blobs.\u2019\n\nBloc-carrying transactions are like any normal Ethereum transaction but have some extra set of data called a blob. The blobs are considerably large and cheaper than the celldata they currently have.\n\nWhile rollups have helped to scale Execution, Proto-Danksharding (PDS, with EIP-4844) is on track to help scale data availability with blobs. Blobs comes as a new type of gas-saving vehicle where rollups can park transactions and proof data efficiently.\n\nWhat is Sharding, Danksharding, and Proto-Danksharding?\n\nSharding is a method mostly used by blockchain networks to enhance capacity and performance. This method is easily achieved through partitioning the network into smaller units called shards. These partitions are capable of processing transactions independently.\n\nParallel processing, in turn, boosts the efficiency of any network, which in turn lowers network congestion and, as a result, reduces gas fees. Sharding, introduced by Ethereum, is a critical step towards making the network more scalable and accessible.\n\nDanksharding is the current mechanism on the Ethereum blockchain, utilizing Binary Large Objects (blobs), which signify large amounts of data that help further increase transaction throughput. This type of sharding is a full realization of how Ethereum rollups will achieve scalability, and it was created to help in the lowering of transaction costs on the Ethereum network.\n\nProto-Danksharding is a transitional phase towards full Danksharding. With the introduction of blobs, Proto-Danksharding\u2019s goal is to prepare the Ethereum network for full Danksharding in the coming days. Proto-Danksharding is the main focus of the new Ethereum upgrade (EIP-4844).\n\nHow EIP-4844 Helps in Reducing Gas Fees\n\nBlob-carrying transactions, in EIP-4844 act more like sidecars attached to Ethereum transactions. However, they include some additional pieces of information. The blobs are large in size (some up to 128kb) but are inexpensive when compared to the current celldata. As such, they are a cost-effective solution for reducing gas fees.\n\nBlob data is cheaper as the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) cannot access it. The EVM can only view a commitment to the blob.\n\nWhen EIP-4844 temporarily stores these blobs on the Ethereum consensus layer, EIP-4844 aims at significantly reducing the cost of data from rollups to the Ethereum base layer, hence lowering transaction fees.\n\nThe actual gas savings realized by EIP-4844 will depend on the degree to which blobs are adopted, but rough initial estimates show a 10-100x improvement for rollup transaction costs.\n\nBesides the blob-carrying transactions, the new Ethereum Cancun Upgrade will also include the implementation of execution-layer logic, verification rules, and a two-dimensional fee market, all of which are necessary for full Danksharding.\n\nExpected Launch Date of the Ethereum Cancun Upgrade\n\nThe Ethereum Devnet-9 is set to launch on September 27, 2023. This testnet will play a crucial role as it will feature a number of changes for the upcoming Cancun upgrade. Some of the EIPs, like EIP-7514 and EIP-7516, will be live for the first time in Devnet-9.\n\nThere still needs to be clarity as to when the upgrade will go live on the mainnet.\n\nEIP-4844 will implement some parts of full Danksharding. One part will be a new transaction type with the same format that will exist in full sharding. Also, it will introduce all the execution-layer logic necessary in full sharding, and also the execution/cross-verification logic, and a self-adjusting gas price for blobs.\n\nHowever, proof-of-custody or any similar in-protocol requirement to verify sharded data in each block will remain pending.\n\nThe Advantages of Ethereum Cancun\n\nThe Ethereum Cancun upgrade will bring in several benefits to the network, which will include:\n\nBoosted scalability: Introducing Proto-Danksharding automatically means that there will be a higher volume of transactions and a quicker processing rate. As a result, it will enhance Layer 2 solutions, which operate on top of the main blockchain.\n\nReduced Gas Fees: utilizing data blobs and implementing EIP-4844, the upgrade will, in turn, cut down the gas fees, a move that will benefit Layer 2 solutions, making transactions more affordable.\n\nTop-notch Security: Ethereum\u2019s security infrastructure will be fortified, which will, in turn, safeguard user data and investments.\n\nIn a nutshell, the Cancun upgrade is set to make the Ethereum network more adaptable, secure, and user-friendly, which pushed its position in the crypto space.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nEthereum\u2019s journey towards addressing its long-standing issue of high gas fees takes a significant step forward with the introduction of Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 4844, also known as Proto-Danksharding. This upgrade, part of the Ethereum Cancun-Deneb release, promises to enhance the Ethereum network in multiple ways, ultimately making it more scalable, secure, and user-friendly.\n\nThe primary feature of EIP-4844 is the introduction of \u201cblobs,\u201d a new transaction type that carries substantial amounts of data at a much lower cost than the current cell data. As the Ethereum network continues evolving and improving, upgrades like EIP-4844 will play a crucial role in enhancing the network\u2019s capabilities as it expands closer to a platform for global transactions."
