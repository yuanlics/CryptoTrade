        "content": "Vitalik Buterin doesn\u2019t want Ethereum to rest on its laurels, but to keep pressing forward with new ideas and approaches to old problems.\n\nLooking around at the app landscape today, Buterin sees chutes of the future sprouting, but even the newest of the new is \u201cnot imaginative enough,\u201d he told the Permissionless audience in Austin, Texas, during an interview with David Hoffman.\n\nDeFi \u201cis cool,\u201d NFTs are a new primitive but \u201can extension of something that has a history,\u201d and using crypto for payments is good, but also familiar. These are \u201cindividual pieces that are designed to fit into an ecosystem that\u2019s otherwise the same as before,\u201d Buterin said.\n\nWhat he\u2019s excited about is decentralized social, repeatedly name-dropping Farcaster, a Twitter-like protocol built on the OP mainnet with a companion Warpcast mobile app that is currently in invite-only alpha release.\n\nAlong with Lens, developed by Aave-founder Stani Kulechov and running on Polygon\u2019s proof-of-stake chain, Farcaster and similar social experiences are using crypto tools to compete with centralized platforms.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s see how far we can push things in that direction,\u201d Buterin said. \u201cBut where I see the longer term future here is it really can plug into all of the other stuff that we\u2019ve been doing as a space.\u201d\n\nBuilding Sybil-resistance for example, so that \u201cthe 894 likes are 894 people, and not 894 accounts that are all controlled by the Kremlin.\u201d\n\nCrypto-based solutions have the potential to be more decentralized, privacy-preserving and secure than the current Web2 landscape, according to Buterin, citing building blocks such as ENS, various proof-of-humanity ideas, and POAPs \u2014 or a next generation version using zero-knowledge technology that will be even better \u2014 and Gitcoin Passport, as examples.\n\n\u201cThe big dream here is to like, really create an independent open tech stack,\u201d Buterin said. Something to compete with the likes of Google and Twitter, without going down a closed, centralized system such as China\u2019s tight integration of Wechat, Alipay and increasingly CBDC.\n\nButerin envisions a gradual on-ramping process for new Web3 users to create an Ethereum address, initially controlled by a familiar service like Gmail, but using account abstraction, giving people the ability to take ownership when they are ready to use more crypto-native approaches.\n\n\u201cBasically, give people the opportunity to slide down the decentralization ladder and then, at the end of it, really properly be in this totally independent stack that actually works together \u2014 all the different pieces inside it,\u201d he said.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nToday, the cryptocurrency market witnessed noteworthy activity as significant amounts of Ethereum's native token, ETH, flowed into major exchanges. According to WhaleAlert reports, a total of 21,938 ETH, valued at approximately $34.78 million, landed in Coinbase's wallets. Shortly thereafter, another 32,500 ETH, equivalent to around $51.3 million, was deposited into OKX, another prominent crypto exchange.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSuch substantial transfers have historically been interpreted as bearish signals in the crypto space. This common perspective suggests that large holders send their assets to exchanges with the intent to sell, which can exert downward pressure on prices.\n\nIt is crucial to recognize that this interpretation is not absolute and can be subject to market complexities and nuances.\n\nCautious optimism\n\nMeanwhile, Santiment, a notable analytics firm, has provided valuable insights through on-chain analysis. According to Santiment analysis, Ethereum has experienced a shift in the movement of older coins, coinciding with a dip in Ethereum's price to $1,540, its lowest point since March 12. During this period, substantial amounts of previously inactive ETH have begun moving from their long-held wallets.\n\nSantiment's analysis suggests that this shift could signify capitulation, potentially foreshadowing market reversals. This observation adds an interesting perspective to Ethereum's current situation, hinting at a possible price rebound in the future.\n\nWhile the cryptocurrency market remains unpredictable, the influx of ETH into OKX and Coinbase, combined with Santiment's analysis, leaves room for cautious optimism among investors and enthusiasts. In the days ahead, further developments will shed more light on Ethereum's price trajectory and the motives driving these significant transfers."

        "content": "A Matrixport analyst envisions a scenario, where Ethereum price can \u201cmaterially drop lower\u201d by the end of the year.\n\nEthereum (ETH) price can go down to the $1,000 mark should the cryptocurrency decline below $1,500 amid a possible sell-off initiated by FTX creditors. A Matrixport analyst said in a recent research report that FTX creditors could trigger an \u201coverhang for altcoins for the rest of the year\u201d if they get a green light from a US court.\n\n\u201cA decline below $1,500 could bring back the idea that Ether could decline to $1,000 \u2014 a level that would appear justified based on the revenue projection from the Ethereum ecosystem.\u201d Matrixport analyst\n\nThe analyst notes ETH at current prices is below the 50d MA, which is a bearish sign. Besides, Ethereum is underperforming Bitcoin as the trend (20d) MA shows ETH/BTC ratio is decreasing, the analyst added. As of press time, ETH is trading at $1,611, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nSolana funding rate | Source: Matrixport\n\nHowever, ETH is not the only crypto vulnerable to adverse movements in anticipation of FTX sales. Solana\u2019s native cryptocurrency SOL is facing a negative funding rate (-14% annualized) and could decline even further, which makes the analyst put significant target levels at $15 and $10. Currently, SOL is trading at $18,4.\n\nYou might also like: FTX looks to claw back millions paid to Shaq\n\nThe FTX drama can even affect Bitcoin (BTC) price. The largest by market capitalization cryptocurrency might squeeze if the August Consumer Price Index (CPI) rises further and the collapsed crypto firm FTX gets approval for liquidation.\n\nAccording to CrypNuevo, the market analyst on X (formerly Twitter), there might be a market-wide \u201cbloodbath\u201d if both events, set for Sept. 13, happen together. Yet, Santiment data indicates investor sentiment is still optimistic for Bitcoin as the ratio of BTC transactions in profit to loss is still positive.\n\nAs crypto.news earlier reported, FTX bankruptcy estate manages a $3.6 billion portfolio in crypto, including around $1.16 billion in SOL and $560 million in BTC.\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "content": "Credit card giant Visa says that one Ethereum (ETH) competitor has unique technological advantages over other blockchains as a payments platform.\n\nIn a new company blog post, the financial services titan says that smart contract platform Solana (SOL) has distinctive features that set it apart from its rivals, such as low and predictable transfer fees, high throughput rates and significant node support.\n\nAccording to Visa, Solana even has the upper hand against the king crypto Bitcoin (BTC) and ETH in some aspects.\n\n\u201cSolana\u2019s transaction fees are not only affordable, usually less than $0.001, but predictable. This level of low-cost predictability helps make it an attractive network to explore efficiencies and cost savings for existing payment operations.\n\nIn [the figure] below, Solana clearly stands out from a cost perspective compared to Bitcoin and Ethereum, whose fees can fluctuate unpredictably based on demand for transactions to execute on the network. A network with unpredictable transaction costs can be more difficult for payment companies to manage within their products and can lead to confusing consumer experiences.\u201d\n\nVisa goes on to say that because of Solana\u2019s efficiency, they have decided to expand their stablecoin settlement program to include Solana as a means of testing the blockchain\u2019s capacity to meet the financial demands of modern corporations.\n\n\u201cSolana\u2019s unique technological advantages, including high throughput with parallel processing, low cost with localized fee markets and high resiliency with a significant number of nodes and multiple node clients, work together to create a scalable blockchain platform with a compelling value proposition for payments.\n\nThese are some of the reasons that we decided to expand our stablecoin settlement pilot to include transactions over the Solana network. As we pilot our stablecoin settlement functionality on Solana, we plan to test whether Solana has the ability to meet the demands of modern corporate treasury operations.\u201d\n\nSolana is trading for $18.39 at time of writing, a 2.19% increase during the last 24 hours.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "According to the blockchain intelligence platform Glassnode, the percentage of Ethereum addresses currently in profit has dropped to approximately 53.5%.\n\nThe downtrend is attributed to Ether\u2019s market performance, whose price has fallen by approximately 13% in the past 30 days.\n\nGlassnode estimated that the last time Ethereum addresses in profit dipped below 54% was on January 12, 2023. The percentage was even less towards the end of 2022 and the first few days of the ongoing year.\n\nOn the other hand, the figure spiked above 70% in May when ETH was inching closer to the $2,000 price tag and in July when the second-biggest digital asset by market capitalization hit that milestone.\n\nMost recently, Ether\u2019s valuation has consolidated at around $1,600 and, similar to many other cryptocurrencies, seems to await a major development to show signs of revival.\n\nHalting the Fed\u2019s aggressive interest rate policy, a decisive win for Ripple in its lawsuit against the US SEC, or the official approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF in America are some events that could cause a bull rally in the entire market.\n\nAssuming this happens in the near future, the overall percentage of ETH addresses in profit could spike well above the 70% level.\n\nHowever, the ongoing bearish trend might stay a bit more or even intensify, meaning the Ethereum addresses sitting on paper losses could rise."

        "content": "ETH could drop below $1,500 as many old coins changed wallets.\n\nThe sentiment remained bearish, but ETH\u2019s burn mechanism could rescue the altcoin in the long-term.\n\nEthereum\u2019s [ETH] plunge to $1,540 has been accompanied by interesting changes that could push the altcoin into capitulation, Santiment revealed. The on-chain analytic platform, in its 12 September post on X (formerly Twitter), noted that a large number of ETH have been transferred from old wallets.\n\n? #Ethereum dropped to $1,540 for the first time since March 12th, and this coincided with large quantities of stagnant $ETH moving away from old wallets. A continued dip in mean $ age while prices drop is a capitulation sign, which foreshadows reversals. https://t.co/50jK2C7aLi pic.twitter.com/4RhtlVX3rr \u2014 Santiment (@santimentfeed) September 12, 2023\n\nOldies leave their former abode\n\nThe post focused on using the Mean Coin Age (MCA) to decipher the possibility. The MCA is the sum of a coin\u2019s Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) alive at the time of coin creation.\n\nAs a long-term indicator, a drop in the MCA implies a massive movement of UTXOs that have been immobile for a long period.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-2024\n\nAt the time of writing, ETH\u2019s 90-day MCA had decreased to 41.07. This further affirmed Santiment\u2019s position that a big fall could be close. Although the 90-day dormant circulation has now reduced, the surge to 634,000 on 11 September reinforced the notion that old coins were moving in droves.\n\nSo, the spike implies that it\u2019s not just the two to five years dormant coins on Ethereum that are moving. Those who have remained stagnant for just three months joined the party.\n\nPreviously, AMBCrypto had explained why ETH\u2019s price action could remain bearish. However, Santiment mentioned that after the rain comes sunshine, noting that relief could come to ETH after the projected price drop.\n\nIs light at the end of the tunnel?\n\nHowever, traders do not expect the recovery to be anytime soon, as shown by the funding rate. As of this writing, ETH\u2019s funding rate was -0.003%. Since perpetual futures contracts can be held indefinitely, it becomes very necessary to have the funding rate.\n\nFunding rate is the amount of an asset paid between long and short-positioned traders with open contracts. When the funding rate is positive, it means that longs are paying too short to keep their position. In this case, traders\u2019 sentiment is bullish.\n\nBut a negative funding rate means that shorts are paying longs a funding fee. Here, like it was with ETH, the sentiment is bearish. So, the broader bias was for ETH to drop much below $1,500.\n\nFor now, Ethereum may need to depend on other metrics besides its market-based indicators in the hope of recovery. One metric that comes to mind is the Ethereum burned supply.\n\nThis Ethereum burned supply represents the cumulative sum of ETH incinerated since the implementation of the EIP-1559. For context, the EIP-1559 was implemented during the London Hard Fork\u2014 the same period Ethereum began the burn mechanism.\n\nIn EIP-1559, the base for transactions is not sent to any miner/validator. Rather, it is burned as a means to reduce ETH\u2019s supply and improve its value in the long term.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nLately, ETH turned inflationary, which could be a cause for concern. However, the burned supply of Ethereum had also increased to 4.25 million (as displayed above).\n\nIf the number continues to increase, then ETH may get back its deflationary pressure, and in the long term, could be profitable for its price."

        "title": "Scaling Ethereum's virtual machine is a 'solvable problem,' says Monad Labs' Galler - Blockworks",
        "content": "The Ethereum scaling story tends to center around layer-2 rollups, but what about the EVM itself? Does the virtual machine suffer from limitations that are inherent to the execution layer of the system, or can developers overcome them?\n\nWhile rollups take the computation load off the Ethereum mainchain, Blockworks co-founder Michael Ippolito wondered how the computation that occurs directly on Ethereum could be more \u201cperformant.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo rollups solve all of our scalability challenges, or is there still work to be done on the execution layer?\u201d he asked during the Permissionless II conference in Austin, Texas.\n\nMonad Labs developer relations engineer Kevin Galler replied: \u201cA lot of the current limitations of the EVM we know today are actually more of a side effect of how the backend computer of this EVM has been constructed up until now,\u201d but are not inherent to the interface or the bytecode.\n\n\u201cYou can actually design parallelism and stuff into this,\u201d he said, acknowledging that \u201cthere\u2019s stuff you have to work around to maintain backwards compatibility.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s like, 20 years of high performance computing research on how to do these things,\u201d he said, \u201cso, it\u2019s a very solvable problem.\u201d\n\nOffchain Labs senior software engineer Raul Jordan admitted that the current implementation of the EVM is \u201cfairly slow for many reasons,\u201d adding \u201cthere are many things we can do to power that up.\u201d\n\nJordan noted that developers are already accustomed to being able to build DeFi primitives and other \u201creally cool applications\u201d with the EVM as it stands today, but wondered \u201chow can we give them superpowers to build something greater than they have before?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow can we empower them?\u201d he asked. \u201cShould we make the EVM faster, or can we introduce new constructs that allow them to do things that weren\u2019t possible before?\u201d\n\nCan\u2019t cheat physics\n\nSomani expressed concerns with the possibility of an excess of layer-2 protocols. \u201cThe issue with the single threaded EVM\u2026is that it results in a lot of rollups.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s people suggesting there should be millions of rollups or something,\u201d Somani continued. \u201cThat\u2019s going to lead to a lot of issues with liquidity fragmentation and end-to-user experience.\u201d\n\n\u201cSufficiently advanced virtual machines\u201d have local fee markets, Somani said, \u201cso that if there\u2019s a lot of activity on one app, it doesn\u2019t congest all those.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo bringing that [virtual machine] to Ethereum can lead to this highly parallelized [layer-2] that doesn\u2019t really need all these other robots to exist,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t cheat physics,\u201d Galler interjected. \u201cBandwidth is fundamentally what limits how fast a lot of these blockchains can run.\u201d\n\nReflecting on scaling challenges, Jordan referred to the example of Arbitrum Stylus, noting that the product allows developers to write code in common programming languages like Rust and C++, compiling to a special instruction format called WebAssembly. \u201cYou can actually execute this side by side with EVM smart contracts.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo we ended up realizing that the EVM is not the ceiling,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s actually the floor.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can do a lot more than you thought was possible while still maintaining the same guarantees.\u201d\n\nScalability at the execution layer \u201chas a long way to go,\u201d Jordan added, \u201cand we\u2019re trying to get there.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "A widely followed crypto analyst believes that a monumental collapse is in the cards for the smart contract platform Ethereum (ETH).\n\nIn a new video, analyst Nicholas Merten tells his 512,000 YouTube subscribers that Ethereum had more than a year to break out from an ascending triangle pattern.\n\nAccording to Merten, Ethereum\u2019s inability to convincingly move above the resistance of the bullish formation suggests that ETH is weak and likely headed to much lower levels.\n\n\u201cEthereum cannot show up to the plate. It keeps getting shot down [at around] $2,000, and that\u2019s okay for a while. But eventually, you\u2019ve got to be able to either break out to the upside or if you break through the ascending line of support to the downside, that spells bad news. That is a failed technical pattern\u2026\n\nSo if we are not going to catch a bid here, then that means we\u2019re probably going to revisit $1,100 \u2013 the previous support range \u2013 or come down to $890 like we were back here in June.\n\nOr maybe even worse: perhaps our scenario of anywhere from $300 to $500 Ethereum is not too bearish at all. Perhaps is not too far off.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, Ethereum is trading for $1,597, slightly below the diagonal support of Merten\u2019s ascending triangle pattern.\n\nMerten is not the only analyst sounding the alarm about a possible Ethereum crash. Crypto strategist Benjamin Cowen previously said that it is in the realm of possibility for ETH to nosedive to as low as $400.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a good chance that [there will] be a lower low, and it might not be a much lower low, maybe it just goes down to just below $800. It could go lower. It could go to $600 or $500 or $400, but that is in the cards for Ethereum.\u201d\n\nI\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Last week, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission charged three decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms \u2013 Opyn, Inc., ZeroEx (0x), Inc. and Deridex, Inc. \u2013 with operating illegal derivatives trading services. Notably, the CFTC reprimanded the smart-contract based trading platforms for supporting tokens that were issued by third-parties.

The CFTC charges were significant in the context of the wider U.S. regulatory landscape. For several years now, the CFTC and Securities and Exchange Commission have been in a jurisdictional turf war over who should regulate the U.S. crypto industry. The industry has generally lobbied in favor of oversight by the CFTC, which holds a reputation as the less strict agency, but last week\u2019s aggressive CFTC actions drew long-standing assumptions about the regulator into doubt. On the other hand, CFTC Commissioner Caroline Pham did pitch a relatively crypto-friendly, \u201ctime-limited\u201d program last week to pave the way for regulated crypto markets and tokenization."

From its mid-August peak at $1,850, Ethereum\u2019s price has been on a consistent downward trajectory.\n\nToday, on September 12, the digital asset reached its lowest point in half a year, raising concerns and questions about the factors driving this extended slump.\n\nSpecifically, ETH tumbled to as low as $1,540 at one point in the past 24 hours, marking the first time the cryptocurrency crashed to this price since March 12.\n\nETH\u2019s price drop coinciding with a drop in the coin age. Source: Santiment\n\nAccording to the behavior analytics platform Santiment, Ethereum\u2019s latest dip \u201ccoincided with large quantities of stagnant ETH moving away from old wallets.\u201d\n\n\u201cA continued dip in mean [coin] age while prices drop is a capitulation sign, which foreshadows reversals.\u201d \u2013 Santiment concluded.\n\nWhy is ETH down today?\n\nPer Santiment, \u2018mean coin age\u2019 refers to the average age of all coins or tokens on a blockchain. Meanwhile, \u2018mean dollar invested age\u2019 is a metric that gauges the average age of all coins/tokens on a blockchain weighted by the purchase price.\n\nETH being offloaded by older wallets underscores the drop in confidence in the world\u2019s second-largest crypto asset, which continues to underperform Bitcoin (BTC) and several other major altcoins in 2023.\n\nEthereum price analysis\n\nAt press time, ETH was changing hands at $1,580, down 1.5%, marking a slight recovery from the 6-month low it hit earlier in the day.\n\nETH 1-day price chart.

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nEthereum continued to trade in a tight consolidation Tuesday, with increasing manifestations of weakness. Last Thursday, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization witnessed a flash crash that dropped its price by about 14% to $1,550 in under 24 hours.\n\nThe decline, primarily triggered by Bitcoin, occurred amidst speculation that SpaceX, helmed by Elon Musk, might have liquidated its entire BTC portfolio. This speculation arose following reports that SpaceX had marked down the value of its Bitcoin holdings by $373 million the previous year. Furthermore, the market sentiment was dampened by news that the SEC had postponed its decision on Bitcoin ETF approvals until 2024.\n\nMeanwhile, following Ether\u2019s unexpected drop, market participants have been trying to speculate about the future of its price, with some predicting the worst is yet to come. On Sunday, prominent cryptocurrency analyst Ali Martinez raised apprehensions regarding Ethereum\u2019s future direction. Through a tweet, Martinez shed light on Ethereum\u2019s fundamental network aspects, which he claimed exhibited bearish tendencies.\n\n\u201cEthereum network fundamentals are still lagging, signaling a bearish trend!\u201d, he said.\n\nNotably, he singled out a crucial metric\u2014the monthly average of active Ethereum addresses. Martinez\u2019s observation unveiled that this metric fell short of its yearly counterpart, indicating a marked absence of on-chain activity. In Martinez\u2019s analysis, this occurrence bore the classic traits of signalling a frail network state and limited utilization.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a subsequent tweet today, the pundit pinpointed a specific price range that he believed could trigger a significant downturn for Ethereum. According to him, \u201cEthereum slipping beneath the $1,600 \u2013 $1,550 bracket for $ETH might set the stage for a significant 37% \u2013 45% correction, targeting $1,000.\u201d\n\nThis projection implied that Ethereum might experience a considerable decline in value, possibly reaching levels last seen in October 2022.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s worth noting that Ethereum\u2019s technical indicators remain solid, as evidenced by its ability to establish higher highs on the daily timeframe consistently. According to an X user and crypto chartist called Haituando, price is likely to bounce off of the support trendline (black), bouncing back higher.\n\n\u201cTechnical indicators suggest a bullish trend on the horizon. With key resistance levels broken and a series of higher lows, ETH appears poised for an upward trajectory. Keep an eye on developments like EIP-1559 and ETH 2.0 as potential catalysts,\u201d he tweeted.\n\nEther traded at $1,587 at press time after a 2.17% increase in the past 24 hours. On the other hand, its rival, Bitcoin, traded at $25,948, up 3.41% over the same period."

This ETF is designed to include a combination of spot ether holdings and futures contracts in its portfolio and pioneering a new approach to cryptocurrency investment within the regulatory framework.\n\nKnown as the Hashdex Nasdaq Ethereum ETF, this investment fund is the first '33 Act Ethereum futures filing of futures Ethereum under the \u201833 Act and is overseen and supervised by Toroso Investments. Toroso Investments is registered as a commodity pool operator with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and is also a member of the National Futures Association.\n\nThe current surge in cryptocurrency ETF applications has placed significant emphasis on whether the proposed funds intend to include futures contracts or spot assets. While the SEC has granted approval for the former, the latter remains unapproved. Fund managers appear to be exploring a middle-ground option, testing their chances in this regulatory landscape.\n\nThe primary investment goal of the Hashdex fund is to ensure that its shares mirror the daily fluctuations in the Nasdaq Ether Reference Price. To achieve this objective, the fund intends to allocate its assets to investments in ether, ether futures contracts traded on the CME, as well as cash and cash equivalents. Nasdaq said in the 19b-4 form:\n\n\"Instead of holding 100% spot Ether, which could make it more susceptible to price manipulation in the spot market, the Fund will hold a mix of Spot Ether, Ether Futures Contracts, and cash,\"\n\nThe Fund aims to decrease its reliance on the spot market and address worries regarding potential manipulation in unregulated Ether spot exchanges by including Ether Futures Contracts and cash in its holdings, it elaborated.\n\nRelated: Franklin Templeton files for spot Bitcoin ETF\n\nHashdex joined the competition for a spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund in the United States. However, Hashdex\u2019s approach differs from recent filings as it won\u2019t depend on the Coinbase surveillance sharing agreement, opting to acquire spot Bitcoin from physical exchanges within the CME market.\n\nIn the previous week, both Ark Invest and 21Shares submitted applications to the SEC for a spot ether ETF, a type of ETF also being pursued by VanEck. The SEC has thus far deferred its determinations on all the applications it has received for spot cryptocurrency funds.\n\nCollect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space.\n\nMagazine: Crypto regulation: Does SEC Chair Gary Gensler have the final say?"

        "content": "Ethereum increased the Churn Limit to 12, aiming to enhance network scalability and security.\n\nThe price of ETH declined along with its volume.\n\nEthereum[ETH], despite its recent struggles in achieving positive price momentum, has been actively working on network improvements. One notable development was the increase in Ethereum\u2019s Churn Limit, which saw a recent rise from 11 to 12. This adjustment is part of ongoing efforts to enhance the network\u2019s efficiency and scalability.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nRising Churn Limit\n\nThe Churn Limit plays a crucial role in Ethereum\u2019s blockchain, as it regulates the number of validators allowed to join or exit the network within a specific timeframe. By increasing this limit, Ethereum aims to accommodate more validators, thereby strengthening network security and decentralization.\n\nYesterday, the churn limit increased from 11 to 12. Next churn limit increase projected to occur around October 4! H/t: @dapplion pic.twitter.com/ftwhRxbGFE \u2014 Christine Kim (@christine_dkim) September 11, 2023\n\n\n\nHowever, it\u2019s essential to consider the Ethereum entry queue\u2019s behavior. This queue, which represents validators waiting to join the network, has been gradually decreasing since its peak on 10 June. The ongoing trend suggested that if no new validators join the network by the end of September, the number of pending validators could return to zero.\n\nDespite these challenges, Ethereum has been making notable improvements in terms of its Churn Rate, reflecting the network\u2019s dedication to optimization. Furthermore, the number of Ethereum validators also grew from 880,000 to 924,024, showcasing a continued interest in supporting the network\u2019s security and operations.\n\nState of the validators\n\nValidator Attestations, vital for confirming transactions and maintaining Ethereum\u2019s blockchain integrity, witnessed a decline in the past month. These attestations serve as a critical aspect of Ethereum\u2019s security framework and require careful monitoring to ensure the network\u2019s reliability.\n\nHowever, daily validator income has shown limited growth, with an average daily income of $0.000236 ETH. This income level may not be attractive enough to incentivize potential validators to participate actively, potentially slowing down network expansion.\n\nIn parallel to these technical challenges, Ethereum\u2019s market performance has faced hurdles. The price of Ethereum remains below $1,623, and trading volume also decreased. Thus, contributing to the overall uncertainty within the Ethereum community.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s ETH\u2019s market cap in BTC\u2019s terms\n\nFurthermore, Ethereum experienced a setback when Vitalik Buterin\u2019s Twitter account was compromised in a security breach.

        "content": "The world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency Ethereum has once again come under major selling pressure with the ETH price tanking over 2% and dropping all the way to $1,540 levels. While the Ethereum bulls tried to put up a major fight above the $1,600 level, they failed to regain the lost ground.\n\nOn-chain data provider Santiment reported: \u201cEthereum experienced a drop to $1,540, a price level not seen since March 12th. During this period, a significant amount of dormant ETH moved from older wallets. This decrease in the average age of ETH holdings while prices are declining is indicative of capitulation, often signaling potential reversals in the market\u201d.\n\nadvertisement\n\nOn the downside, the major support levels for ETH to watch for are $1,550 and $1,370. These are the key support levels where the probabilities of bounce back are higher.\n\nAs of press time, the ETH price did bounce back from the first support zone and is trading at $1,579 with a market cap of $189 billion. On the other hand, if the BTC price continues to fall, the Ethereum price can fall further to $1,407.\n\nOn the flip side, should Bitcoin\u2019s price experience a rebound, it could exert an upward pressure on Ethereum\u2019s price, potentially turning the $1,575 resistance level back into a solid support zone. This could pave the way for Ethereum to surpass the $1,800 mark and reach the significant psychological milestone of $2,000.\n\nEthereum Weighted Sentiment Drops\n\nSantiment\u2019s data indicated an increase in the age consumed metric earlier this month, but it has remained relatively stable since then. This lack of significant selling activity from long-term holders in recent days has been notable.\n\nThe overall market sentiment appeared pessimistic, and there was a decline in the mean coin age. These factors collectively underscored the bearish sentiment in the market and suggested that ETH was likely not in an accumulation phase.\n\nOn August 23rd, there was a substantial outflow of ETH from exchanges, although there haven\u2019t been many noteworthy outflows since that time."

        "content": "Ethereum Layer 2 projects, such as Optimism, Arbitrum, and zkSync, aim to increase transaction throughput and reduce costs while maintaining security and decentralization properties. L2 solutions operate atop the existing blockchain, allowing for off-chain processing and a more scalable approach. They offer lower transaction costs, improved transaction capacity, and maintained security. Types of L2 solutions include rollups, state channels, and plasma. Projects like Arbitrum, Optimism, and zkSync are pioneering the L2 space, aiming to improve Ethereum's efficiency and scalability.\n\nCommon Ethereum Layer 2 projects include Optimism, Arbitrum and zkSync. Tokens from some of these projects, such as ARB (Arbitrum) and OP (Optimism), have been available for trading. This article aims to explain the concept of Layer 2 in straightforward terms.\n\nAs blockchain technology continues to evolve, Ethereum has established itself as a leader in smart contracts and decentralized applications . However, its growing popularity has brought about challenges, particularly in terms of scalability and transaction costs. To address these issues, Layer 2 (L2) solutions were introduced, designed specifically to navigate these hurdles.\n\nWhat is Layer 2 (L2)?\n\nLayer 2, often abbreviated as L2, refers to a secondary framework or protocol built atop the existing blockchain (Layer 1 or L1). The primary objective of L2 solutions is to increase transaction throughput and reduce associated costs, all while maintaining the security and decentralization properties of the main chain.\n\nThe Basics: Layer 1 vs. Layer 2\n\nLayer 1 (L1) is the foundational blockchain layer. Think of Ethereum or Bitcoin; these are L1 blockchains. They form the bedrock upon which L2 solutions are constructed. L1 handles the core consensus, maintains the network's security, and records all transactions.\n\nLayer 2 (L2), on the other hand, operates atop L1 and can process transactions off-chain or in a more scalable manner. The results are then settled back onto the main chain, ensuring the security and immutability of the primary blockchain.\n\nThe Promise of Layer 2\n\nLowered Transaction Costs: L2 solutions, by handling numerous transactions off-chain and consolidating them into one L1 transaction, can markedly decrease the expense of each transaction.\n\nImproved Transaction Capacity: Compared to conventional L1 blockchains, L2 solutions are capable of processing a greater volume of transactions every second (TPS), tackling a primary concern in the world of cryptocurrency.\n\nMaintained Security: Even though transactions might be processed off-chain, they eventually settle on the main chain, inheriting the security properties of L1.\n\nDiving Deeper: Types of Layer 2 Solutions\n\n1. Rollups: These are a popular L2 solution where transactions are processed off-chain and then bundled or \"rolled up\" into a single transaction that's recorded on L1. There are two main types of rollups:\n\nOptimistic Rollups: Transactions are assumed to be valid unless proven otherwise. If a transaction appears suspicious, it can be challenged and verified.\n\nZero-Knowledge Rollups (ZK-Rollups): These use cryptographic proofs to validate transactions off-chain. Only the proof, which is much smaller in size, is submitted to L1.\n\n2. State Channels: These are off-chain corridors where multiple transactions can occur between participants. Once the series of transactions is complete, the final state is settled on the main chain.\n\n3. Plasma: A framework that allows for the creation of child chains branching from the main chain. These child chains can operate independently and report back to the parent chain periodically.\n\nLayer 2 in Action\n\nSeveral projects are pioneering the L2 space:\n\nArbitrum: An Optimistic Rollup solution aiming to make Ethereum transactions more cost-effective.\n\nOptimism: Another Optimistic Rollup, focusing on scaling Ethereum and enhancing its overall efficiency.\n\nzkSync: A ZK-Rollup platform that offers a scalable, low-cost solution for Ethereum transactions.\n\nConclusion\n\nLayer 2 solutions represent a promising step forward in addressing the scalability and cost issues associated with current blockchain networks. As these solutions continue to evolve and mature, they could pave the way for broader adoption of blockchain technologies and a more efficient decentralized future.\n\nDisclaimer & Copyright Notice: The content of this article is for informational purposes only and is not intended as financial advice.

        "content": "Nasdaq, the renowned stock exchange, has officially filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to list an Ethereum ETF in partnership with Brazilian asset manager Hashdex, who expressed interest in holding both spot ether and futures contracts.\n\nNasdaq Partners with Hashdex on ETH ETF Application\n\nThe partnership will result in the creation of the Hashdex Nasdaq Ethereum ETF, managed and controlled by Toroso Investments. As a registered commodity pool operator with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and a member of the National Futures Association, Toroso Investments holds an influential position in this venture.\n\nThe proposed Ether ETF has gotten attention for its intention to hold both futures contracts and spot funds. This strategic move is in response to the SEC\u2019s approval of futures contracts while rejecting spot products.\n\nAccording to the 19b-4 form, the Hashdex fund aims to reflect daily changes in the Nasdaq Ether Reference Price and will invest in ETH, Ether futures contracts listed on the CME, cash, and cash equivalents.\n\nThe fund will diversify its holdings across Spot Ether, Ether Futures Contracts, and cash. This approach intends to lessen the fund\u2019s reliance on the spot market, thereby mitigating potential manipulation concerns in unregulated Ether spot exchanges. Instead, the fund will rely on Ether Futures Contracts and Ether futures EFPs traded on the regulated CME Market, ensuring high transparency and oversight levels.\n\nHashdex\u2019s CEO Confident in Future Spot BTC ETF Approval\n\nEarlier this year, Marcelo Sampaio, the CEO and co-founder of Hashdex, stated that his firm prefers to cooperate with regulators rather than take legal action against them. This was a reference to Grayscale Investments, who won a lawsuit against the SEC after its proposed spot bitcoin ETF was rejected. Sampaio also expressed confidence in the eventual approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF, although the timeline and circumstances are still uncertain.\n\nMeanwhile, Ark Invest and 21Shares made a pioneering application last week with the SEC for this initiative to launch the ARK 21Shares Ethereum ETF. This product is set to become the first US ETF backed by Ethereum, the second most valuable cryptocurrency after Bitcoin.\n\nThe applications occur amidst a growing competition to approve the first US spot Bitcoin ETF. Despite multiple rejections due to fraud and price manipulation concerns, many analysts view Grayscale Investments\u2019 recent lawsuit victory against the SEC as a potential catalyst for future approvals of such funds."

        "content": "In its latest prediction, Matrixport, a financial services network, released a report forecasting a dramatic dip in Ethereum\u2019s prices, potentially to $1K, catalyzed by FTX creditor liquidation.\n\nPer Matrixport, ETH revenues have been disappointing, as the coin broke below the $1,650 and $1,600 supports. Matrixport cautioned of possible decline towards and below $1,500, potentially heralding a nosedive to $1,000, based on the Ethereum ecosystem\u2019s revenue projections.\n\nThe network mentioned FTX creditor\u2019s altcoin sales among the primary drivers of Ether\u2019s price dip to $1K.\n\nEthereum Supply Shock to Drive Plunges\n\nFTX holds at least $90 million worth of Ethereum, translating into over 56K ETH. The injection of these myriads of ETH in the market will cause a supply shock, possibly driving the asset to $1K.\n\nPer the report, Ethereum saw an issuance of 15K ETH last week, more than the number of tokens burned 11K. The data implies an increase in the total number of circulating ETH last week. In the last 30 days, the number of issued and burned ETH was 799K and 783K, respectively, suggesting a 0.01% growth in supply.\n\nThrowing the FTX ETH sales into the mix alongside the already surging supply could add fuel to the fire, tipping the scales towards a forecasted price plunge.\n\nDespite holding $3.4 billion in crypto assets, reports indicate that FTX will liquidate about $200 million weekly. This means not all the 56K ETH will be released in the market in a single shot.\n\nAs Matrixport hints of looming price declines, Ethereum has been rallying today, gaining 1.3% in the past 24 hours. ETH is currently trading at $1,613, having touched a 24-hour low of $1,539. The $1,600 mark has turned from support to resistance.\n\nIn light of Matrixport\u2019s forecast, the more likely scenario once FTX begins to liquidate is a nosedive, thrusting ETH below the support points at $1504 and $1400 and effectively sending Ethereum towards the $1K mark.\n\nIncoming Altcoin Crash?\n\nAside from Ethereum, Matrixport\u2019s outlook predicted that other altcoins could suffer major plunges. For instance, Solana, which recently broke below the $19 support level, shows signs of further strains.\n\nFTX currently holds approximately $685 million in Solana. Significant sell-offs have the potential to push the coin\u2019s value below $15 and towards $10.\n\nThe firm has also expressed concern about the upcoming ApeCoin (APE) unlocks, allowing insiders to sell another 11% of the tokens this week."

        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction as $10 Billion Trading Volume Comes In \u2013 Can ETH Reach $10,000?\n\nETH Chart / Source: TradingView\n\nEther (ETH), the cryptocurrency that powers the world\u2019s largest and most widely used smart-contract-enabled layer 1 blockchain Ethereum, has been nudging higher in recent trade and was last changing hands around 0.5% higher in the last 24 hours in the $1,610 area, now up close to 5% from earlier weekly lows in the $1,530s.\n\nCrypto markets have seen a broad recovery since jitters regarding FTX\u2019s plans to sell $3.4 billion in digital assets weighed on sentiment earlier in the week.\n\nDigital asset investment firm Arca\u2019s CIO Jeff Dorman was quoted in the crypto press on Tuesday as saying that the market reaction to potential FTX sales was an overreaction.\n\n\u201cThe way crypto market makers and traders are front-running the FTX supply shows a complete misunderstanding of how a syndicated sale process works,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cthis isn\u2019t an every-man-for-himself VC unlock\u2026 This is a court-ordered process that Galaxy will sell very slowly and opportunistically\u201d.\n\n24-hour trading volumes of nearly $10 billion in the Ether market, as per CoinGecko, suggest potential dip buying activity.\n\nUS Inflation Continues to Fall\n\nElsewhere, US inflation data, despite the headline YoY and Core MoM numbers coming in a little above expected, may also be cushioning sentiment.\n\nThat\u2019s because the YoY rate of Core inflation posted a big decline to 4.3% from 4.7%, easing pressure on the Fed to continue hiking interest rates.\n\nThe US central bank embarked on a historic interest rate hiking cycle last March and has since lifted interest rates 525 bps to 5.25-5.5%.\n\nCore inflation is more closely monitored by the Fed as, according to them, it gives a better representation of price pressures in the US economy than the headline figures, which can be easily buffeted by volatile food and energy prices.\n\nWith interest rates already well above the Core inflation rate, meaning a positive real interest rate, the Fed will want to avoid tightening financial conditions too much, as they still hope to achieve a \u201csoft-landing\u201d scenario for the US economy, defined as bringing inflation under control without causing a recession.\n\nPrice Prediction \u2013 Where Next for Ether (ETH)?\n\nRecent Ether price stabilization will not assuage fears about a price drop to sub-$1,500 levels, given the cryptocurrency\u2019s still unfavorable near-term technical outlook.\n\nEther remains stuck below its 21DMA, which has been offering strong resistance recently, as well as below a downtrend that began in August.\n\nA break above these resistance levels will be needed for the short-term outlook to improve.\n\nFor now, with Ether in the process of forming a bearish descending triangle structure, a drop to sub-$1,500 levels remains a strong possibility.\n\nA potential retest of the March lows around $1,370 remains a strong possibility.\n\nArguably, the fundamental outlook doesn\u2019t warrant a decline back to such levels, so strong dip buying would be likely.\n\nEther future ETF approvals in the US are likely in the next few months, with spot ETF approvals likely next year.\n\nMeanwhile, Ether has for now been able to avoid the US SEC\u2019s wrath of being labeled as a security (unlike major rivals like BNB, SOL and ADA).\n\nIt seems likely that after 2022\u2019s slump, Ether remains in the early accumulation stages of a new bull market that is yet to really get going.\n\nCan ETH Reach $10,000?\n\nIf Ether is in the early stages of a new bull market, big gains could lie ahead.\n\nETH posted gains of 5,700% from its December 2018 bear market lows of around $70 to its 2021 record highs in the $4,800s.\n\nWith the market has matured and higher market caps achieved over time, Ether is unlikely to post another 5,700% gain from its 2022 lows at $880 this bull market, which would take its price to over $50,000 and market cap to over $11 trillion.\n\nBut could ETH rally 11x from its 2022 lows to rise above $10,000 in the coming years?\n\nAbsolutely, assuming the Ethereum blockchain is able to maintain its rapid adoption and position as the dominant Web3 infrastructure provider.\n\nRemember, ETH is deflationary thanks to its token burn mechanism, more ETH are constantly being removed from supply as ETH staking gains ground, and one of the fastest areas of crypto growth is in the Ethereum layer-2 protocol space (the likes of Arbitrum, Optimism, Base and Polygon), all of which rely on Ethereum\u2019s underlying security.\n\nEthereum will also be undergoing major network upgrades to address scalability concerns in the coming quarters, further boosting its use case, such as danksharding.\n\nA price of $10,000 at the current supply of just over 120 million ETH tokens would imply a market cap of around $1.2 trillion, which seems very reasonable and attainable in the coming years, assuming a broad crypto bull market that also sees the likes of Bitcoin rally into the $100,000s per coin.\n\nAlternatives to Consider\n\nIt\u2019s always smart for crypto investors to hedge their bets, given the unpredictability of the market.\n\nOne excellent Ether (ETH) alternative that crypto investors should consider is a new coin being launched by Wall Street Memes, one of the internet\u2019s largest retail investing communities.\n\nWall Street Memes, with its over 1 million following across various social media channels, has traditionally described itself as \u201cthe king of stonks\u201d (stocks for the uninitiated), but is also looking to claim the crown of being \u201cthe king of crypto\u201d, with the launch of its very own meme coin token $WSM.\n\nThe presale of $WSM has been a resounding success, with over $25 million raised, and dozens of major crypto industry influencers and analysts backing the coin for major success.\n\nAnd investors are running out of time to get involved, with the presale scheduled to end in under 14 days.\n\nGet in now on a token that could match or even surpass the likes of Pepe Coin, Dogecoin and Shiba Inu.\n\nBuy $WSM Here\n\nDisclaimer: Crypto is a high-risk asset class.

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nA recent data dump from IntoTheBlock reveals a puzzling trend: a whopping 640,000 ETH has exited exchanges. This mass exodus of Ethereum from trading platforms was not exactly on anyone's bingo card, especially given Ethereum's recent market performance. As of the latest data, Ethereum is priced at approximately $1,598.67. So, what is fueling this unexpected dynamic?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFirst, accumulation. The outflow could be a bullish sign, indicating that investors are hoarding Ethereum for the long haul. However, it is essential to note that Ethereum's long-term performance has been bearish. This makes the accumulation theory a bit shaky but still plausible. Investors might be seeing this as an opportune moment to stock up on Ethereum at a lower price point.\n\nSource: TradingView\n\nAnother angle to consider is portfolio de-risking. Some whales might be liquidating their Ethereum holdings \u2014 not because they have lost faith in the asset, but perhaps to diversify their portfolios. In a volatile market, putting all your eggs in one basket is rarely a good idea.\n\nThe sudden drop in exchange reserves also opens up a conversation about liquidity. Reduced liquidity could lead to increased volatility, which traders should keep an eye on.\n\nWhile the reasons behind this massive outflow remain speculative, the data do not lie. Ethereum is seeing a significant shift, and whether it is for accumulation or diversification, the impact on the market will be worth monitoring.\n\nIs this the calm before a storm, or is it a storm in itself? Only time will tell. But one thing is certain: the Ethereum landscape is shifting, which might lead to an unexpected surge of volatility."

        "content": "The popular Web3 wallet has officially unveiled a novel feature called \u2018Snaps,\u2019 which paves the way for its expansion beyond the confines of Ethereum.\n\nThis marks a new dawn for developers and users of Metamask, who will benefit from interoperability and compatibility for different non-EVM blockchains.\n\nThe inception of this feature traces back to a proposal by Dan Finlay, the co-lead developer in Metamask, to construct a platform welcoming developers to build permissionless solutions that integrate with the wallet.\n\nFollowing significant advancement, the concept envisioned by Dan Finlay is becoming a reality with the introduction of Metamask Snaps in Extension v11.0+.\n\nMetamask defines Snaps as novel features developed by third parties that users can directly install into their wallets without permission. The project offers a functionality allowing anyone to add features from other independent developers straight into their Metamask wallet.\n\nAccording to Metamask;\n\n\u201cSnaps run in a sandboxed environment and use a permissions model to protect your data and respect your consent. Snaps do not have access to your MetaMask account data. When installing a Snap, make sure you understand what permissions you are granting.\u201d\n\nSources indicate that Metamask engaged with about 150 different devs in developing this new functionality. The launch of Snaps is a giant leap forward for innovation grounded in Metamask, propelling the decentralization movement into a new era.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvVwXoep9oE&t=1s&ab_channel=CryptoPotato\n\nSnaps Welcome Interoperability with non-EVM Blockchains\n\nAs indicated in Metamask\u2019s snap directory, 34 snaps are integrated and ready to use by crypto investors at launch. Based on Metamask, one of the primary classes of the allowlisted \u2018Snaps\u2019 focuses on the interoperability and compatibility of Metamask with non-EVM blockchains, including Solana, Bitcoin, Algorand, Cosmos, and more. There are two Solana-focused, 1-Algorand-focused, and 1 Bitcoin-focused Snaps.\n\nThe BTCSnap is the first-ever product allowing users to manage BTC directly within Metamask without wrapping the tokens.\n\nAlgorand Foundation now has an Algorand Snap, which allows people to manage, swap, and transfer accounts directly with Metamask.\n\nSolflare Wallet and Drift Labs have launched different integrations of Solana wallets so investors can swap, stake, connect to Solana Dapps, and even bridge from EVM to SOL with utmost ease.\n\nMore interoperability-focused snaps already launched include Tezos-Metamask-Snap, CubeSigner, Cosmosnap, Consensys/Starknet Snap, and Mina Portal, etc.\n\nNotification and Transaction Insight Snaps\n\nAside from the interoperability Snaps, Metamasks brought the Notification and Transaction insights the new feature as well. Notification snaps bring with them chat features and notifications provided directly into Metamask. Examples of such tools include Push Snap by Push V1, Walletchat-Metamask Snap, and more.\n\nTransaction Insight Snaps are features that bring clear and in-depth analysis of blockchain transactions. Such Snaps include Forta network-Metamask Snap, risk detect-snap, Blockfence-insights, Tenderly Snap, and Wallet Guard."

        "content": "WOOFi, a decentralized exchange platform owned by Woo Network, has announced a strategic shift from the NEAR Protocol to Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible networks. The move aims to develop a version 2.0 omnichain DEX, integrating centralized finance and decentralized finance sectors. WOOFi Pro will offer a mobile-friendly interface, gasless orderbook trading, and integration with Orderly Network's order books. The platform is set to launch with 10 crypto trading pairs in October.\n\nWOOFi, a leading decentralized exchange platform owned by Woo Network, has announced its strategic shift from the NEAR Protocol to Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible networks. This transition is aimed at the development of its version 2.0 omnichain DEX.\n\nWOOFi's decision to transition was unveiled at TOKEN 2049. Jack Tan, WOO's Founder and CEO, emphasized that this move is indicative of a more robust offering in both centralized finance (CeFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi) sectors. Tan envisions a seamless integration between the two crypto exchange realms in the upcoming bull run. WOOFi's objective is to amalgamate major chains, centralize liquidity, and foster a cooperative ecosystem. This will enable WOOFi Pro users to trade across their preferred applications and blockchain networks. For instance, a trader on Arbitrum can execute trades against counterparts on chains like Polygon or Optimism without exiting Arbitrum.\n\nWOOFi Pro's design leverages the platform's extensive experience in developing trading products. It promises a mobile-friendly interface, allowing traders to conduct transactions seamlessly. WOO X, WOOFi's centralized exchange counterpart, boasts a daily trading volume ranging between $150 million to $500 million. It has been at the forefront of several industry innovations, including the introduction of a live transparency dashboard. This initiative is geared towards preserving the trust of its expanding community of professional traders. One of the standout features of WOOFi Pro is its gasless orderbook trading, which eradicates transaction fees. This not only enhances accessibility for users but also negates the requirement for Know Your Customer (KYC) verification. Furthermore, users maintain complete autonomy over their funds, eliminating dependence on external custodians.\n\nAnother noteworthy integration is with Orderly Network's institutional-grade order books. This ensures that users have consistent access to a substantial liquidity pool. Orderly Network, a decentralized liquidity network, has garnered support from notable backers such as Pantera, Dragonfly Capital, and Sequoia Capital China.\n\nTan highlighted the synergy between WOO X and WOOFi, stating, \"The combination of WOO X and WOOFi provides users with a fully-featured off-chain or on-chain orderbook trading system.\" He further observed an uptick in traders seeking both traditional and cryptocurrency trading avenues. This trend has been particularly evident in the recent cycle, with a pronounced inclination towards Real World Assets (RWAs).\n\nWOOFi Pro is set to debut with 10 crypto trading pairs in its October mainnet launch. However, there are plans to diversify its asset offerings, potentially including cryptocurrencies, stocks, commodities, and forex. To date, WOOFi has successfully facilitated over 2.9 million cross-chain swaps. With the platform's user-friendly interface, it is anticipated that this number will surge as users can effortlessly navigate the ecosystem and diversify their asset portfolio with a single click.\n\nDisclaimer & Copyright Notice: The content of this article is for informational purposes only and is not intended as financial advice.

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nVitalik Buterin said that a SIM swap assault was the cause of the hack of his X account.\n\nThe incident occurred on September 9 and resulted from con artists advertising a false NFT giveaway, which cost victims more than $690,000.\n\nButerin stressed the value of Twitter account security and the advantages of decentralized social platforms for security.\n\nVitalik Buterin, a co-founder of Ethereum, has verified that a SIM-swap assault was the cause of his hacked X (Twitter) account.\n\nSwitch the Phone Number Immediately\n\nOn September 12, Buterin said that he had finally regained control of his T-Mobile account after the hacker had succeeded in taking over the account through a SIM swap attack.\n\nHe announced the decentralized social media network Farcaster.\n\nHe said, \u201cA phone number is sufficient to password reset a Twitter account even if not used as 2FA,\u201d noting that users may \u201ccompletely remove [a] phone from Twitter.\u201d\n\n\u201cI had seen the \u2018phone numbers are insecure, don\u2019t authenticate with them\u2019 advice before, but I did not realize this.\u201d\n\nA false NFT giveaway was made on Buterin\u2019s X account on September 9 by scammers, who tricked users into clicking a dangerous link, causing them to lose over $691,000 as a result.\n\nWARNING! I JUST LOST A FEW PUNKS! DON'T INTERACT! pic.twitter.com/lS4VvlHdVa \u2014 luckytimes.eth beautifuldaytobealive.eth (@BokkyPooBah) September 9, 2023\n\nOn September 10, Ethereum engineer Tim Beiko strongly advised turning on 2FA and eliminating phone numbers from X accounts. He told the platform\u2019s owner, Elon Musk, \u201cSeems like a no-brainer to have this default on, or to default turn it on when an account reaches, say, >10k followers.\u201d\n\nTwitter opsec PSA: If you have a phone number linked on your account, even with other 2FA, it can be used to reset your PW. Need to specifically disable it + remove phone #. If your Twitter account pre-dates crypto, strongly recommend double-checking, and adding strong 2FA! pic.twitter.com/uXrvHYhQvJ \u2014 timbeiko.eth \u2600\ufe0f (@TimBeiko) September 9, 2023\n\nUsing a SIM-swap or simjacking assault, hackers can take over a victim\u2019s mobile phone number. Scammers can utilize two-factor authentication (2FA) to access social media, bank, and cryptocurrency accounts if they have possession of the number.\n\nThe Buterin family has been hacked on Twitter previously.\n\nNatalia Ameline, Vitalik\u2019s mother, was involved in a Twitter scam in August of this year. Ameline oversees investor relations and general DAC operations for Metis, an Ethereum layer-2 scaling solution. On Twitter, the project was hijacked and used to send fraudulent links that allowed some followers\u2019 wallets to be stolen.\n\nCyber Threats Lurking at Every Turn\n\nThe use of this attack vector by T-Mobile has occurred previously. The telecom corporation was sued in 2020 for allegedly allowing a series of SIM-swap hacks that resulted in the theft of $8.7 million worth of cryptocurrency.\n\nIn February 2021, a client who had suffered a second SIM-swap attack and lost $450,000 in Bitcoin sued T-Mobile again and in July, T-Mobile was again being sued over claims that it did not take adequate precautions to prevent a SIM switch scam that cost one client $55,000 in lost Bitcoin.\n\nSIM-swap attacks increased in 2022, according to the Federal Bureau of Investigations . Over $72 million in losses were caused by this attack vector, an increase of $4 million from the previous year. The heart of the hack attack is when a perpetrator fools cellular service representatives, obtains crucial personal information and then redirects a victim\u2019s mobile number to their device.\n\nFeds Want $5.2 Million in Bitcoin Stolen in Sim Swap\n\nLast week, a federal judge approved an order, requiring Ahmad Wagaafe Hared to hand over $5.2 million in Bitcoin that he stole back in 2016. Hared and two accomplices devised a SIM-swapping operation between 2016 and 2018 that resulted in the theft of the automobile and the Bitcoin.\n\nMillions of dollars\u2019 worth of Bitcoin that were taken from crypto industry executives four years ago by a teen hacker are now being seized by the U.S. Department of Justice. The sports automobile he purchased with the stolen Bitcoin is also being sought after by the prosecution.\n\nIn 2016, Harred, who was 18 at the time and was a resident of Tucson, Arizona, collaborated with Nevada-based co-conspirator Matthew Gene Ditman to deceive customer service agents of cell phone companies into divulging information about the SIM cards linked to the accounts of cryptocurrency executives in northern California.\n\n2019 saw the end of the scam after the FBI tracked down Harred and Ditman and apprehended them. The two have not yet received sentences.\n\nCrypto Executive Faces $6.3 Million Loss in Audacious SIM-Swap Attack\n\nBart Stephens, a pioneer in the cryptocurrency sector and managing partner of Blockchain Capital, filed a lawsuit against an unnamed bad guy last month. Stephens claimed he was the victim of a SIM-swap attack that resulted in a $6.3 million cryptocurrency hack.\n\nThis lawsuit served as yet another somber reminder of the ongoing cyber risks that prominent crypto advocates must deal with.\n\nIn the official complaint, the hacker, who goes by the alias Jane Doe, planned a complex SIM-swap attack against Stephens on May 14.\n\nThe criminal was able to bypass security measures with Stephens\u2019 cell service provider by using data obtained from the dark web and other online sources. Finally, Stephens\u2019 cell phone number was forwarded to a new device by the hacker.\n\nAfter the successful SIM switch, the hacker wasted no time in moving on.\n\nBy using Stephens\u2019 mobile number as a backdoor, they were able to reset the passwords for numerous crypto wallets by getting over two-factor authentication restrictions. The hacker boldly transferred $6.3 million in digital assets from these to individual cryptocurrency vaults.\n\nCryptocurrency owners and the general public must exercise caution in a climate where cyber heists, particularly SIM-swap assaults, are on the rise.\n\nOne can combat such malevolent activities by adhering to FBI suggestions , such as avoiding oversharing financial details online and using strong multi-factor authentication techniques."

        "content": "Share:\n\nBitcoin price has risen above the $25,586 resistance level as it gingerly treads a recovery higher.\n\nEthereum price recoups losses, but the $1,800 psychological level could be difficult to overcome.\n\nRipple price decisively breaks above a bearish channel at $0.4600, but growing headwinds leave a lot to be determined.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price is leading the rest of the market, including Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) prices, north, with momentum indicators painting a bullish picture. However, investors must exercise caution from here on out, with a lot still to be determined.\n\nAlso Read: US CPI annual inflation comes in above expectations at 3.7%, Bitcoin price rests above $26,000\n\nBitcoin price forging an uptrend\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price is forging an uptrend after two successive green candlesticks. While the outlook appears promising, investors should exercise caution lest the recovery prove fake.\n\nFor the bullish perspective, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) moving north points to rising momentum, which is corroborated by the green candlesticks of the Awesome Oscillator (AO). Furthermore, RSI is converging bullishly with Bitcoin price adding weight to prospects of an uptrend. This is indicated by BTC price\u2019s recent streak of lower lows, which were not mirrored by the RSI.\n\nFurthermore, BTC has retained above the last higher low of the previous uptrend \u2013 the June lows at $24,800. Given this key level has held, the market structure remains long-term positive, making a recovery a real possibility.\n\nIn an uptrend scenario, Bitcoin price could break past the resistance confluence between the 50- and 200-day Simple Moving Averages (SMA) before confronting the 100-day SMA, with the three moving averages converging around the psychological $28,000. This makes this obstacle a formidable one. A confirmed breach above the $28,838 resistance level would increase the odds for a continuation north.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the flipside, a strong resistance barricade hovers above Bitcoin price, indicated by the 50-day SMA (short-term moving average) crossing below the 200-day SMA (longer-term moving average). Any move up to this cluster of MAs will likely be met with technical selling pressure.\n\nThis technical formation is also what is known as a \u2018death cross\u2019 which is when the 50-day SMA crosses below the 200-day SMA, and signals oncoming bearishness in the market. However, it is not a textbook version of the pattern as the 200-day SMA is rising as the 50 crosses below it. Ideally, for a five-star set-up, both MAs should be falling.\n\nA bearish reversal could, nevertheless, send Bitcoin price back below $25,586, or in a dire case, to test the $24,000 psychological range. The June lows at $24,800 are a key make-or-break level, and if breached could flip the script for the lead crypto.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin price rise pulls crypto market cap above $1 trillion; US headline CPI forecast to rise; core to fall\n\nEthereum price could have trouble overcoming the $1,800 hurdle\n\nEthereum (ETH) price is recovering, like BTC, but overhead pressure seems to be gathering up. To the upside, the 50-day SMA could reject ETH, or worse, the confluence between the 100- and 200-day SMA, at around the $1,800 psychological level, present a formidable resistance level. A break above this hurdle could see ETH tag $1,919 \u2013 levels last tested around mid-July.\n\nThe RSI is northbound, converging bullishly with price, and bolstered by the green bars of the AO\u2019s histograms, adding credence to the bullish thesis.\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the other hand, Ethereum price still risks a correction, considering the pattern of lower lows and lower highs since the April highs were lost. Bears still have a presence in the ETH market, as indicated by the mixed AO histogram.\n\nShould the optimistic forecast fail, Ethereum price could break below the $1,552 support level, or in the dire case, extend toward the $1,407 support level, thereby reclaiming the March 11 lows. This would indicate a 12% slump below current levels.\n\nAlso Read: Total Crypto market cap falls below $1 trillion as whales dump Bitcoin and Ethereum\n\nRipple price faces strong headwinds after a bullish breakout\n\nRipple (XRP) price successfully broke out from a bearish falling channel, which it then pulled back for a retest and final leg-up goodbye. If it continues to hold above this channel for the second consecutive day it could turn the upper boundary of the descending channel into support at $0.4600.\n\nHowever, Ripple price faces strong opposition, with the 200-, 100-, and 50-day SMAs, acting as resistance levels to cap the upside potential for XRP at $0.5107, $0.5666, and $0.5753 levels respectively.\n\nXRP/USDT 1-day chart\n\nConversely, early profit takers could cut the budding uptrend short, sending Ripple price back into the confines of the descending channel. A decisive break below the midline of the channel at $0.4191 would invalidate the bullish outlook, possibly sending XRP to the channel\u2019s lower boundary at $0.3562. Such a move would indicate a 25% crash below current levels.\n\nAlso Read: Ripple Price Forecast: XRP holders need to prepare for 25% crash"

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEthereum's price has been a roller coaster lately, but a recent uptick has everyone scratching their heads. As of the latest data, ETH is priced at $1,582.21. What is fueling this unexpected bounce?\n\nSome market watchers believe we are seeing the effects of mass capitulation among bearish traders. The theory goes like this: the recent price plummet that sent Bitcoin below $25,000 and Ethereum under $1,600 triggered a buying frenzy. Retail traders, sensing an opportunity, swooped in to snap up assets at bargain-basement prices.\n\nBut let's not get carried away. While the capitulation theory holds some water, it is crucial to remember that the crypto market is a complex beast. Multiple factors, often interlinked, contribute to price movements. So, while retail buying power might be a factor, it is unlikely to be the sole driver of Ethereum's recent price uptick.\n\nWhat is clear, however, is that the market is in a state of flux. Volatility is the name of the game, and Ethereum is no exception. Whether this bounce is a temporary blip or the start of a more sustained recovery remains to be seen. But for now, at least, Ethereum investors have a little something to smile about.\n\nXRP loses important support\n\nXRP's recent tumble below the pivotal $0.5 mark has traders on edge. This price level was not just a number; it served as a psychological bulwark, a line in the sand that many hoped would not be crossed. Yet here we are, with XRP currently trading at approximately $0.4776, according to the latest data.\n\nWhy does the $0.5 level matter so much? It is not just about the number itself but the sentiment it carries. When XRP held above this level, it was a sign of relative stability and investor confidence. Now that it has been breached, the market's mood has shifted, and not for the better. The RSI (Relative Strength Index) is also in oversold territory, adding another layer of concern.\n\nWhat is the next line of defense? If we look back at the price action in June and April of this year, the $0.45 level stands out as a robust support point. During those periods, the asset showed strong consolidation around this price, making it a likely candidate for the next battleground.\n\nThe breach of the $0.5 level could serve as a catalyst for further downward movement, especially if the market fails to recover swiftly. The next few trading sessions will be crucial in determining whether XRP can regain its footing or if it will continue its descent into more precarious territory.\n\nShiba Inu investors waking up\n\nWhile Shiba Inu's price might not be painting the rosiest picture \u2014 hovering around $0.00000722 according to recent data \u2014 the meme token is quietly making waves in another department. Specifically, its trading volume on Binance has skyrocketed by a staggering 200%, reaching a colossal three trillion. What's the story behind this volume surge?\n\nOne of the main reasons could be the increased activity of whales, which suggests a possible accumulation phase. Whales often have the foresight and resources to buy low and sell high, and their heightened activity could be a precursor to a future price uptick.\n\nSecondly, this volume explosion is not happening in a vacuum; it coincides with a market-wide price drop. This juxtaposition could imply that savvy traders are seizing the opportunity to buy the dip, anticipating a rebound. The surge in trading volume, especially during a market downturn, could be a bullish indicator disguised as a bearish trend."

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nNasdaq has filed an SEC application to list an ETF that invests in both spot Ether markets and Ether futures.\n\nThe proposed fund would be issued by the Brazilian digital asset manager Hashdex.\n\nThe SEC has so far resisted spot crypto funds but endorsed their futures-based equivalents.\n\nCould mixed spot/futures ETFs could overcome the impasse?\n\nThe US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has so far resisted allowing Exchange-Traded Funds (ETF) to directly hold cryptocurrencies. Yet, since 2021, several funds that invest in cryptocurrency futures markets have been approved.\n\nWith the SEC currently stalling its decision on several spot Bitcoin ETF applications, Nasdaq has proposed listing a mixed spot/futures fund as a novel third path.\n\nAssuaging SEC Concerns Over Market Manipulation\n\nOn Tuesday, September 12, Nasdaq filed an SEC application to list an ETF that invests in both spot Ether markets and Ether futures. The fund would be issued by Hashdex, a Brazilian firm specializing in digital asset management.\n\nThe decision to mix direct cryptocurrency investments with crypto futures is framed in terms that are designed to appease the SEC\u2019s objections to spot crypto ETFs. Namely, the Commission\u2019s concerns that spot cryptocurrency markets are vulnerable to manipulation.\n\nNasdaq\u2019s filing argues that \u201cinstead of holding 100% spot Ether, which could make it more susceptible to price manipulation in the spot market, the Fund will hold a mix of Spot Ether, Ether Futures Contracts, and cash.\u201d\n\nSecuring a Role for the CME\n\nTo the SEC, allowing crypto futures ETFs is justified because futures contracts are issued by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME).\n\nCrypto spot trades, on the other hand, are facilitated by exchanges that the SEC hasn\u2019t sanctioned. (And which it therefore views illegal, according to the SEC\u2019s classification of the majority of cryptocurrencies as securities.)\n\nIn response, to the SEC\u2019s stance on spot crypto ETFs, the Nasdaq\u2013Hashdex application insists that the fund will incorporate \u201cdynamic investment restrictions,\u201d designed to mitigate the risk of market manipulation.\n\nAs the filing notes, the fund would ensure that the CME is the only \u201cmarket of significant size\u2019\u201d facilitating investments for the proposed ETF.\n\nOvercoming the ETF Impasse\n\nUltimately, critics have argued that the SEC\u2019s logic is flawed and it has been questioned by US courts.\n\nRegardless of how much oversight the SEC exercises over the CME, crypto futures are still bound by the price of the underlying assets they track. They are thus subject to the same manipulation and volatility risks of crypto markets.\n\nThat being said, if they help appease the SEC and weaken its resistance to allowing ETFs to directly hold cryptocurrency, mixed funds could overcome a regulatory hurdle that has constrained the growth of crypto investment in the US."

        "title": "Top 3 Recent Price Predictions: Bitcoin (BTC), Ripple (XRP), Ethereum (ETH) - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "It is safe to assume that crypto investors are quite intrigued by the future price of some of the most popular digital currencies. Being among the largest by market capitalization, Bitcoin (BTC), Ripple (XRP), and Ethereum (ETH) have gathered much of the interest.\n\nIn the following lines, we will take a closer look at some of the recent price predictions regarding the aforementioned crypto assets.\n\nWhat Does the Future Hold for Bitcoin?\n\nNumerous finance experts and crypto proponents have supported the thesis that the primary cryptocurrency will surpass the $100,000 milestone sooner or later. Such examples are Robert Kiyosaki (the author of the best-seller Rich Dad, Poor Dad), Adam Back (CEO of Blockstream), Tom Lee (Managing Partner at Fundstrat), Anthony Scaramucci (former White House official), and many others.\n\nOne of the most recent forecasts came from analysts of Pantera Capital, who predicted that the leading digital asset could tap almost $150,000 sometime next year. According to them, the driving factor for the price increase will be the BTC halving that will take place in 2024.\n\nOther events that could prompt a rally are the potential approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF in the US, the Fed halting its aggressive interest rate policy, adoption from a leading corporation (such as Apple, for example), etc.\n\nHow About XRP?\n\nThe native token of Ripple has also been in the spotlight lately (especially after the crypto firm secured a partial victory in its lawsuit against the SEC in July). Back then, XRP skyrocketed above $0.80 while many bulls expected to see the price surpassing the $1 mark.\n\nHowever, the asset failed to keep the momentum and plunged in the following months to its current level of approximately $0.48 (per CoinGecko\u2019s data).\n\nThe popular cryptocurrency analyst Shannon Thorp recently made the bold forecast that XRP could reach $500 in the next four years, considering that the total value of cross-border payments tap $250 trillion by 2027.\n\nIf the coin indeed explodes to such a level, it would mean that its market capitalization will stand at around $260 trillion (about 260 times greater than the current market cap of the entire crypto industry).\n\nAnother fact that shows how prosperous this forecast might sound is the sector\u2019s condition during the bull market in 2021. Back then, BTC hit an all-time high price of almost $70K, whereas the total market capitalization of the industry was nearly $3 billion at its peak (120 times shy of the target envisioned by Thorp).\n\nETH Might Plummet\n\nThe latest Matrixport analysis (reported by CryptoPotato) estimated that the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap could nosedive to $1,000 (or drop to a 15-month high) based on the ecosystem\u2019s revenue projections.\n\nThe entity also touched upon FTX and its creditor\u2019s plan to sell billions in crypto assets, including ETH. It believes this could be another factor pushing the coin\u2019s valuation south."

        "content": "The cryptocurrency market soared in late 2021 with many coins hitting all-time highs. Ethereum ETH/USD and Bitcoin BTC/USD were among the cryptocurrencies that hit all-time highs in November 2021.\n\nOne of the top company executives in the world shared a bullish take on cryptocurrency in 2021. Unfortunately, it coincided with the near peak of valuations, which could have been an inopportune moment for investors to place their bets.\n\nWhat Happened: Several companies added Bitcoin to their balance sheets in 2021, which was among the catalysts that helped propel the price forward. One company that was often rumored to get more friendly with cryptocurrency was Apple Inc AAPL.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook revealed that he personally owned cryptocurrency, without specifying which cryptocurrencies he owned or how much.\n\n\u201cI do, yeah, I think it\u2019s reasonable to own it as part of a diversified portfolio,\u201d Cook told Andrew Ross Sorkin at the DealBook Conference when asked if he owned Bitcoin or Ethereum.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been interested in it for a while,\" he added.\n\nCook said he had been researching cryptocurrency for a while, but shut down a notion that Apple would be adding crypto to its balance sheet.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t go invest in crypto, not because I wouldn\u2019t in my own money, but because I don\u2019t think people buy Apple stock to get exposure to crypto.\u201d\n\nAside from investing in crypto, Sorkin asked Cook about the possibility of accepting cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin for products like Apple Pay.\n\n\"It's something that we are looking at,\" he said, however, \"it's not something we have immediate plans to do.\"\n\nRelated Link: 5 Things You Might Not Know About Apple CEO Tim Cook\n\nInvesting $1,000 in Bitcoin, Ethereum, Apple Stock: Many cryptocurrency investors and fans of the sector buy based on specific events and catalysts. Hearing that the CEO of the biggest company in the world was bullish on cryptocurrency and owned Bitcoin or Ethereum was a catalyst that could send the price higher.\n\nUnfortunately, Cook\u2019s comments came almost to the day of the all-time high prices for Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nAn investor could have bought 0.0149 Bitcoin with $1,000 on Nov. 9, 2021. The Bitcoin would be worth $390.52 today, down 60.9% from the original purchase price.\n\nAn investor could have bought 0.2119 Ethereum with $1,000 on Nov. 9, 2021. The Ethereum would be worth $340.32 today, down 65.0% from the original purchase price.\n\nFor comparison, an investor could have purchased 6.6979 shares of Apple stock with $1,000 at the same time. The investment in Apple stock would be worth $1,193.03 today. This represents a positive return of 19.3% over the last nearly two years.\n\nAn investor who put the same $1,000 in the SPDR S&P 500 Global ETF Trust SPY, which tracks the S&P 500 Index, would have an investment worth $981.85 today, down 1.8% over the last nearly two years.\n\nBitcoin hit its all-time high of $68,789.63 on Nov. 10, 2021, one day after Cook\u2019s comments.\n\nEthereum hit its all-time high of $4,891.70 on Nov. 16, 2021, shortly after Cook\u2019s comments.\n\nRead Next: If You Invested $1,000 In Apple Stock When Tim Cook Became The CEO, Here's How Much You'd Have Today\n\nImage: Shutterstock"

        "content": "Ethereum price extended the down leg below the previous support at $1,600 \u2013 a move that saw declines sweep through levels seen last in March. The leading smart contracts token traded new weekly lows of $1,540 before launching an ongoing rebound seeking to reclaim the ground above $1,600.\n\nDormant ETH Finally On The Move\n\nThe sell-off on Monday also coincided with a spike in the movement of previously dormant tokens away from old wallets. According to the Age Consumed on-chain metric by Santiment, there was a noticeable increase in the most dormant ETH over three months.\n\nadvertisement\n\n\u201cA continued dip in mean $ age while prices drop is a capitulation sign, which foreshadows reversals.\u201d\n\nThe rollback to March price levels could attract more long traders, who by taking advantage of the dips, are targeting short-term profits as ETH price rebounds to close the gap to $2,000. This uptake of Ethereum means fresh momentum is brewing for the next rally, first above $1,600 then to $1,800, and later to $2,000.\n\nA sustained break past $2,000 could signal the start of a much-awaited bull market in 2024 going into 2025.\n\nThis current bullish outlook cannot be depended on until ETH price clocks highs above the lower ascending trendline or closes the day beyond the pivotal $1,600 level.\n\nUpholding support at $1,600 could help ease the potential selling pressure likely to follow the confirmation of a death cross pattern. This bearish chart formation occurs with a short-term moving average such as the 50-day EMA (red) crosses below a long-term one like the 200-day EMA (purple).\n\nThe death cross adds credence to the bearish outlook, implying that sellers have the upper hand and the ongoing downtrend is far from over.\n\nUnless investors put the fear of uncertainty aside and rally behind Ethereum, the Money Flow Index (MFI) will drop into the oversold region, which will validate another sell-off to $1,450.\n\nWill ETH Price Drop To $1,000 Before The Bull Market?\n\nAnalysts at Matrixport in their latest report on the performance of altcoins, said that \u201cwith Ether being close to the psychologically important $1,600 level, a break could carry prices lower, especially as revenue growth disappoints.\u201d\n\nThe longer the price stays below the $1,600 level, the higher will increase the chances of another sell-off trimming gains and forcing investors to capitulate. Matrixport believes it is too early to rule out a potential drop to $1,000 \u2013 \u201ca level that would appear justified based on the revenue projection from the Ethereum ecosystem.\u201d\n\nRelated Articles"

        "content": "Polygon co-founder Sandeep Nailwal believes the layer-2 blockchain firm is reaping the benefits of allocating $1 billion to develop zero-knowledge (ZK) proof-powered scaling solutions for the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nSpeaking at a keynote address during the latest edition of the Token2049 conference in Singapore, Nailwal touched on the development of \u201cPolygon 2.0\u201d scaling efforts and the promise of recursive ZK-proof technology to create a seamless interoperable blockchain ecosystem.\n\nPolygon co-founder Sandeep Nailwal at Token2049 in Singapore.\n\nNailwal highlighted how Web2 and Web3 are similar in form and function, with the former serving as the internet of information with \u201cpractically unlimited scalability\u201d as well as the ability to transfer or convey information in various forms seamlessly across the world at great speeds.\n\nRelated: Polygon\u2019s \u2018holy grail\u2019 Ethereum-scaling zkEVM beta hits mainnet\n\nWeb3, meanwhile, represents the \u201cinternet of value,\u201d which, according to Nailwal, will require two capabilities to become ubiquitous.\n\n\u201cFirstly, infinite, unlimited, unbounded scalability and unified liquidity for value to be transferred, there cannot be 100 chains with the value distributed across them, and they cannot interoperate.\u201d\n\nIn order to tap into the characteristics that have made Web2 able to become the internet of information, Nailwal pointed to the importance of an aggregator or interoperability layer to amalgamate ZK-proofs of different chains into a common layer.\n\n\u201cThe moment those two proofs are submitted on Ethereum layer, we have a mechanism where we have a global state route on Ethereum, and then any kind of liquidity can move across the chain without coming to Ethereum.\u201d\n\nRecursive ZK-proof technology holds the key to this aggregator layer, which Nailwal expects to be deployed in the coming months. The technology will allow different blockchains to submit ZK-proofs of their network state to the aggregator, which then submits a proof of these combined attestations to the Ethereum network.\n\n\u201cOur goal is that this proving will eventually go down to, like, probably two seconds. So, every chain is submitting a proof of whatever has happened on their ecosystem or on their chain every two seconds to this aggregator layer.\u201d\n\nThe Polygon co-founder believes that cross-chain transactions could be executed in four to five seconds, one third of an Ethereum block time, which will begin to feel \u201clike one single big block space.\u201d\n\nNailwal highlights the potential benefit of having high liquidity chains like their zkEVM and proof-of-stake chain to share value to applications while noting that larger layer-1 blockchain platforms have expressed interest in tapping into an interoperable layer.\n\n\u201cAnybody can join this layer, and it\u2019s a mutual win-win because everybody benefits from each other\u2019s liquidity.\u201d\n\nPolygon zkEVM\u2019s beta hit mainnet in March 2023, allowing developers to deploy smart contracts and decentralized applications that benefit from faster throughput and lower costs than Ethereum\u2019s layer 1.\n\nThe company also recently launched its Chain Development Kit, which allows developers to build, customize and deploy layer-2 chains connected to the wider Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nCollect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space.\n\nMagazine: Recursive inscriptions: Bitcoin \u2018supercomputer\u2019 and BTC DeFi coming soon"

        "content": "Tue 12 Sep 2023 \u25aa 3 min of reading \u25aa by Fenelon L.\n\nThe eventual validation of the Ether Futures ETF by the US SEC could shake up the crypto sector. Beyond Ethereum, iconic Ethereum network currencies such as Polygon and Uniswap could feel significant impacts.\n\nThe anticipated impact of the Ethereum Futures ETF on Polygon\n\nPolygon, known for its key role in optimizing the Ethereum blockchain, could gain momentum following the potential approval of the Ethereum Futures ETF. If this ETF is validated, it would underline the crucial importance of scalability solutions, such as that offered by Polygon, which could boost the value of MATIC, its flagship currency.\n\nReports are circulating that the SEC is on the verge of approving Ethereum-Futures ETFs. Indeed, leading companies such as Volatility Shares, Bitwise, Roundhill and ProShares are already in the running with their applications. If informants close to the matter are to be believed, the SEC could give the go-ahead to several of them as early as October.\n\nGrowing interest in Ethereum, amplified by this ETF, could propel Polygon\u2019s technology to the forefront. Mihailo Bjelic, co-founder of Polygon, recently highlighted the innovation of their zkEVM solution. If Ethereum becomes more attractive, Polygon\u2019s technology could become indispensable, putting MATIC in the spotlight.\n\nAlso worth noting: Shiba Inu plans to use Polygon\u2019s zkEVM to optimize its blockchain network. And forecasts remain optimistic for MATIC, suggesting a value of $0.87 at the end of 2023.\n\nUniswap and the Ethereum ETF effect\n\nUniswap, the leading DEX on Ethereum, is ideally positioned to benefit from the eventual approval of the Ethereum Futures ETF. Such approval could lead to a massive influx of investors into Ethereum, boosting liquidity and trading volumes on Uniswap.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the forthcoming introduction of Uniswap V4 promises users even greater flexibility and performance. Nevertheless, some experts anticipate that the price of a UNI token could fluctuate between $7.69 and $8.44 by the end of 2023.\n\nThe endorsement of an Ethereum Futures ETF could mark a major evolution in the crypto universe. Platforms such as Polygon and Uniswap could grow in popularity. The future of cryptocurrency looks bright, and developments such as these could accentuate that brightness.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program!

        "content": "Vitalik Buterin, a computer programmer who co-founded the popular cryptocurrency Ethereum, is clearing the air after his account on Twitter (now known as X) was hacked this weekend. The hack involved a post touting a commemorative NFT that was actually a cryptocurrency wallet drainer.\n\nThe Biggest Crypto Heists of 2022\u2026So Far CC Share Subtitles Off\n\nEnglish view video The Biggest Crypto Heists of 2022\u2026So Far\n\n\u201cFinally got back my T-mobile account (yes, it was a sim swap, meaning that someone socially-engineered T-mobile itself to take over my phone number),\u201d Buterin wrote. \u201cMain learning re twitter was: > A phone number is sufficient to password reset a Twitter account even if not used as 2FA. Can completely remove phone from Twitter.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nButerin revealed that a SIM swap attack was the method for the hack in a post on the decentralized social media platform Farcast, as reported by Decrypt. The outlet says that the swap allowed the hackers to take over Buterin\u2019s Twitter account by manually resetting his password using his phone as well as using the number to bypass the platform\u2019s two-factor authentication. The Ethereum co-founder boasts a big 4.9 million followers on the platform, and the hack resulted in an estimated $650,000 worth of NFTs being stolen from unsuspecting victims.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis weekend, the hackers took control of Buterin\u2019s account to post a phony link to a limited edition NFT, which was advertised to commemorate the release of proto-danksharding for Ethereum. Proto-danksharding is an upcoming update to the cryptocurrency\u2019s digital infrastructure, which developer Mario Havel told Decrypt was in its last stages of development before release, seemingly in the next few months. The new update will use so-called \u201cdata blobs,\u201d allowing the Ethereum network to expand and handle up to 100,000 daily transactions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cTo celebrate the Proto-Darksharding coming to Ethereum, @Consensys is marking the moment with a commemorative NFT. \u2018Proto honors the work of the devs who made this possible. The collection is free for the next 24 hours, \u201d the alleged hackers posted on Buterin\u2019s account, followed by a link to a webpage where users were encouraged to claim the NFT. The tweet was posted and subsequently removed over the course of 20 minutes."

Prior to Buterin's explanation, it was speculated that the hackers exploited a SIM swap vulnerability to gain access to his account.\n\nSIM swaps and cyber traps\n\nButerin has since regained control of his T-Mobile account and clarified the situation via his X account. He confirmed that the hacking was due to a SIM swap attack, stating that someone \"socially engineered\" T-Mobile itself to gain access to his phone number.\n\nButerin also shared a cautionary note on the vulnerability of phone numbers as an authentication method. He mentioned that even if a phone number is not used for two-factor authentication (2FA), it can still be exploited for password resetting on X. In hindsight, Buterin acknowledged that he had been advised against using phone numbers for authentication but did not heed the warning until this incident.\n\nThe hack has prompted Buterin to transition to \"farcaster,\" a platform where account recovery is tied to Ethereum addresses, thus offering enhanced security.\n\nButerin has moved to a more secure platform, but the incident serves as a cautionary tale for both public figures and average users in the crypto community."

BNB Smart Chain also claims that the platform achieved a peak of 4,000 transactions per second during a stress test of its capabilities.\n\nRelated: Can the Optimism blockchain win the battle of the rollups?\n\nBNB Chain senior solution architect Arno Bauer highlighted scalability and security as top priorities for the scaling solution while meeting stringent criteria:\n\n\u201cThis included high availability, 4K transactions per second, rigorous stress testing, reduced gas costs under 0.2 gwei, fast finality under 1 second and enhanced security with multiple external audits.\u201d\n\nAs Cointelegraph previously reported, opBNB is based on the Optimism OP Stack and is EVM-compatible, allowing it to interact with Ethereum-based smart contracts, networks and ERC-20 token standards.\n\nThis solution makes use of optimistic rollups to scale transactions by assuming that transaction data proven off-chain is valid until proven otherwise. The technology has been important in helping the Ethereum network scale, but critics highlight the week-long lockup of funds in these protocols, while validation checks are processed.\n\nOptimism has seen significant growth in daily transaction volumes processed and an increasing number of active daily addresses, suggesting that the layer-2 solution continues to offer value to users and DApps.\n\nA number of major decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols have also deployed on Optimism to harness its scaling capabilities. This includes the likes of Uniswap, Aave, 1inch Network, SushiSwap and Curve Finance.\n\nCointelegraph has reached out to BNB Chain to ascertain further details of opBNB\u2019s development and other scaling solutions that may have been considered by the ecosystem.\n\nCollect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space.\n\nMagazine: Recursive inscriptions: Bitcoin \u2018supercomputer\u2019 and BTC DeFi coming soon"

Users can also bridge Ethereum to Manta to begin exploring its development environment.\n\nRelated: Manta Network developer raises $25M in Series A, launches layer 2 for ZK apps\n\nWith industry peers, including the likes of Consensys\u2019 Linea zkEVM, Polygon zkEVM, Starknet, Coinbase\u2019s Base and zkSync Era, there are a number of ZK-proof L2 solution options available to Web3 developers.\n\nSpeaking to Cointelegraph following the mainnet launch, Manta Network core contributor Kenny Li said that the different ZK-rollup L2s offer different value propositions that aim to solve significant problems faced by developers.\n\n\u201cWe think that, in the mid- to long term, the market will converge to a small number of available solutions that are focused on making it as easy as possible for developers to build and deploy ZK-enabled applications.\u201d\n\nLi added that the Web2 world of technology followed a similar evolution with the success of software-as-a-service models where a plug-and-play approach was taken:\n\n\u201cThis is crucial when zero-knowledge is involved, whereby developers do not have to worry about the infrastructure, as the complexity of cryptography can be abstracted away.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Manta Network core contributor, Manta Pacific has been in development for nine months, while its testnet launch in July 2023 has seen the creation of 150,000 wallets and over 3.5 million transactions.\n\nManta raised $25 million from investors in July 2023, aimed at scaling the project\u2019s network and use cases with an eye on driving adoption in the Asian market.\n\nCollect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space.\n\nMagazine: Here\u2019s how Ethereum\u2019s ZK-rollups can become interoperable"

        "title": "Ethereum Price Prediction: Where Next As ETH Drops to March Levels - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) dropped below $1,600 on Monday dropping to $1,530, levels last seen in March. The largest altcoin by market capitalization briefly regained the $1,600 ground on Tuesday before dropping back to the current price at $1,589.\n\nThe drop in Ether\u2019s price on Monday coincided with a surge in the movement of previously dormant ETH tokens away from old wallets, according to Santiment. The on-chain and social metrics intelligence platform posted the following chart on the social media platform X showing a noticeable increase in the most dormant ETH over three months, according to its Age Consumed on-chain metric.\n\n\u201cA continued dip in mean $ age while prices drop is a capitulation sign, which foreshadows reversals\u201d, the post read.\n\nThe decline to March levels could attract more buyers, who could take advantage of the dips and buy more ETH at a discount, targeting short-term profits once ETH rebounds toward the $2,000 psychological level. This means Ethereum is building up fresh momentum for a sustained recovery.\n\nEthereum Could Reach $2,000 in the Short Term\n\nIncreased buying from the $1,500 demand zone could push ETH first above $1,600 then to $1,800, and later to $2,000. A sustained break past $2,000 could usher Ethereum into a bull run that could take place between 2024 and 2025.\n\nThe RSI is pointing upwards and moving away from the oversold region. This suggested that the buyers had begun returning to the scene.\n\nETH/USD Daily Chart\n\nUpholding support at $1,600 could help ease the potential selling pressure that has continued to build up after the confirmation of a death cross pattern. This bearish signal occurred on September 1 when the short-term moving average, the 50-day SMA (yellow) crossed below a long-term 200-day sMA (purple).\n\nThe death cross adds credence to the bearish outlook, implying that sellers have the upper hand and the ongoing downtrend is far from over.\n\nUnless investors put the fear of uncertainty aside and rally behind Ethereum, the RSI will drop back into the oversold region, which will validate another sell-off to $1,450.\n\nNote that the longer the price stays below the $1,600 level, the higher the chances of another sell-off trimming gains and forcing investors to capitulate.\n\nAnalysts believe it is too early to rule out a potential drop to $1,000 \u2013 a level that would appear justified based on the revenue projection from the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Shiba Inu's Ethereum Connection: What Does It Mean for Everlodge? - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "As an ERC-20 token, SHIB is connected to the Ethereum blockchain, and similarly, Everlodge operates within the Ethereum network. So, what implications does this hold? Let\u2019s delve into the details.\n\nJoin the Everlodge presale and win a luxury holiday to the Maldives\n\nShiba Inu\u2019s Link with Ethereum\n\nShiba Inu takes the form of an ERC20 token, effectively entwining its operations, including the Shiba Inu burning mechanism and the Shibarium platform, with the Ethereum blockchain. With the transition to Proof of Stake (PoS), Ethereum mining\u2019s relevance has waned, replaced by Ethereum staking for transaction validation. This shift implies that Shiba Inu transactions will undergo validation via an alternative method. Furthermore, there\u2019s speculation that the Ethereum price\u2019s fluctuations could influence the entire array of tokens inherent to the Ethereum chain.\n\nThis connection might hold particular significance for certain SHIB holders. Despite a recent temporary shutdown of Shibarium, the Shiba Inu developer team asserts that the blockchain is primed for a re-release, eagerly anticipated by the Shiba Inu community. Recent enhancements have introduced safety measures and a monitoring system to avert potential disruptions. The initial launch of Shibarium led to a suspension of transactions, rendering $2.5 million in bridge assets temporarily inaccessible and affecting the value of Shiba Inu.\n\nWith its revival, an increased number of validators come online to bolster security on the Layer-2 system. Shibarium\u2019s goal is to curtail gas fees for users, and the public beta phase is slated to commence before September\u2019s end.\n\nThe fact that Shiba Inu and the Shibarium are bulit on Ethereum means that they benefit from the security and decentralisation of Ethereum.\n\nEverlodge: Co-Ownership of Luxurious Vacation Properties\n\nEverlodge is also built on Ethereum, and is offering a unique opportunity for individuals to invest in high-end vacation properties across the globe. The whitepaper is available on the official Everlodge website, expounding on the mission of Everlodge.\n\nThe crux of Everlodge\u2019s business model revolves around acquiring and transforming luxury properties into NFTs. This transformation confers legal ownership via the blockchain, with the fractionalization making it accessible to potential investors. Thanks to the nature of blockchain technology, all pertinent details are stored on the chain, publicly accessible, and the participation process is user-friendly.\n\nEverlodge is aiming to democratize the real estate market, making it accessible to investors irrespective of their background, nationality, or financial circumstances. Everlodge will introduce a decentralized NFT marketplace for real-world properties.\n\nAs global financial uncertainties rise, confidence in the traditional financial system wanes, compelling investors to explore alternative avenues.\n\nThrough Everlodge, investors can profit from rental income and the appreciation in property values. In addition to earning rewards through staking the Everlodge token, ELDG, which offers a 10% APR. Issued on Ethereum, the ELDG token remains within the influence of the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nHolders of Everlodge tokens are poised to enjoy incentives such as complimentary stays in vacation properties. The ongoing Everlodge presale presents the opportunity to acquire ELDG on the official Everlodge website, with prices starting at a mere $0.012. Notably, the token\u2019s projected minimum launch price stands at $0.38.\n\nFind out more about the Everlodge (ELDG) Presale\n\nWebsite: https://www.everlodge.io/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/everlodge\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

The company has introduced a new co-ownership model that uses blockchain technology to simplify the process of investing in vacation homes. Here, properties are tokenized to enable fractional ownership and facilitate easy trading of the tokens between investors.\n\nGet started in just a few taps: create your account, link your DeFi wallet with Everlodge, and immerse yourself in a kaleidoscope of listings spanning upscale villas, boutique hotels, and serene vacation spots across the globe.

With a tiered pricing approach, each presale stage is poised to elevate the token's market value as demand increases.\n\nEthereum (ETH) reaches crucial price level\n\nThe evolution of Ethereum has been nothing short of fascinating. As the pioneering force behind smart contracts, Ethereum has firmly established its reign since its inception in 2014. Some even believe that Ethereum might touch the lofty $10,000 mark by 2025.\n\nHowever, the journey to such heights isn't devoid of challenges. Ethereum's scalability issues, long a thorn in its side, threaten to bottleneck its growth. The 50% drop in TVL since April shows that the lingering issue is starting to take its toll.\n\nTechnically speaking, the $2,000 resistance looms large for the Ethereum price. Should it manage to pierce this resistance, Ethereum could quickly ascend toward $2,500, before a larger move to $10,000.\n\nLitecoin (LTC) Completes Halving Event\n\nSimilar to Ethereum, Litecoin has managed to remain a top-tier asset to date. The world's first 'silver' cryptocurrency has held its own against the likes of Bitcoin Cash and Ripple over the years.\n\nHowever, interest in Litecoin is dropping to record-low levels in 2023. This was showcased during the most recent Litecoin halving event, which saw the Litecoin price pump from $65 to $114 in months, only for it to crash just as quickly. Litecoin now trades at $62.91.\n\nFind out more about the Everlodge (ELDG) Presale\n\nWebsite: https://www.everlodge.io/"

She revealed that a developer within the Milady ecosystem had successfully diverted approximately $1 million in generated fees away from Remilia Corporation.\n\nI am heartbroken that there were people within this brilliant, loving community with so much wealth and enrichment for everyone involved that would scheme from within for short term profit at the expense of everything we have built together.

        "content": "Within the dynamic and constantly shifting realm of cryptocurrencies, Ethereum has risen to prominence as a standout participant, commanding the interest not just of individual traders but also of institutional stakeholders. The trend of institutional investment in Ethereum has swiftly grown to become a pivotal force over recent years, wielding the power to mold market behaviors and imprint a lasting mark on the expansive cryptocurrency landscape.\n\nThis comprehensive article delves extensively into the ascendancy of institutional involvement in Ethereum, meticulously dissecting the fundamental trends propelling this phenomenon forward, while also meticulously analyzing the far-reaching consequences and ramifications it bears upon the wider cryptocurrency market. Trying to cash in on the latest crypto wave? Ethereum is the leading contender, and the AI trading system makes purchasing it easier.\n\nThe Institutional Shift\n\nThe transition towards embracing institutional investment within the Ethereum ecosystem signifies a moment of profound significance in the trajectory of cryptocurrencies. While the cryptocurrency realm has conventionally been associated with tech aficionados and individual retail traders, the incursion of institutional entities introduces a distinct echelon of credibility and steadiness to the Ethereum market.\n\nThis influx of institutional investors, spanning a spectrum from hedge funds to corporate entities, is motivated by the alluring prospects of substantial returns, the strategic diversification of their portfolios, and the invaluable opportunity to gain exposure to the transformative potential of blockchain technology.\n\nDriving Factors\n\nSeveral driving factors have paved the way for institutional interest in Ethereum:\n\nGrowing Acceptance and Recognition\n\nEthereum\u2019s recognition as more than just a speculative asset has grown steadily. Its underlying smart contract capabilities have found utility in various sectors, such as decentralized finance (DeFi), supply chain management, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). This broader usability enhances Ethereum\u2019s appeal to institutional investors looking for tangible use cases.\n\nMarket Maturation\n\nAs the cryptocurrency market matures, regulatory clarity and improved infrastructure have become more pronounced. This has created a conducive environment for institutional investors, who often require regulatory certainty and robust custodial solutions before entering a market.\n\nPotential for Diversification\n\nInstitutional investors are always seeking avenues to diversify their portfolios. Ethereum, with its distinct market dynamics and correlation patterns, offers a unique opportunity for diversification, reducing the overall risk exposure of institutional investment portfolios.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Influence\n\nBitcoin, often dubbed digital gold, initially captured institutional interest. As Ethereum\u2019s narrative expanded beyond being solely a cryptocurrency, it drew the attention of investors who were looking for exposure to blockchain technology beyond just a store of value.\n\nImpact on the Market\n\nThe influx of institutional investment in Ethereum has far-reaching implications for the cryptocurrency market:\n\nPrice Stability\n\nInstitutional investors, known for their long-term investment strategies, contribute to reducing price volatility. Their substantial investments can help dampen the extreme price swings commonly associated with cryptocurrencies, making Ethereum a more attractive option for risk-averse investors.\n\nMainstream Adoption\n\nInstitutional involvement acts as a bridge to mainstream adoption. As reputable institutions allocate funds to Ethereum, it piques the interest of a wider audience, fostering greater acceptance and understanding of cryptocurrencies in general.\n\nEnhanced Market Capitalization\n\nThe injection of institutional capital inevitably leads to an increase in Ethereum\u2019s market capitalization. This, in turn, bolsters Ethereum\u2019s position in the cryptocurrency rankings and solidifies its status as a pivotal player in the digital asset space.\n\nRegulatory Scrutiny\n\nWhile institutional investment lends credibility, it also invites increased regulatory scrutiny. Regulators are paying closer attention to Ethereum as institutional involvement grows, potentially shaping the regulatory framework surrounding cryptocurrencies.\n\nFuture Outlook\n\nThe trajectory of institutional investment in Ethereum is poised for a continued and intricate evolution. As a growing number of institutions grasp the profound possibilities offered by blockchain technology and decentralized applications, it is anticipated that their attraction towards Ethereum will gain even more momentum.\n\nThis heightened interest holds the potential to catalyze additional phases of market maturation, spur heightened efforts in infrastructure enhancement, and stimulate the creation of a more diverse range of investment offerings meticulously designed to align with the distinct requirements of institutional investors.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe infusion of institutional investment has brought a revitalizing surge of activity to the Ethereum ecosystem. This rejuvenation is the result of a powerful synergy between cutting-edge technological advancements, heightened awareness of Ethereum\u2019s capabilities, and the facilitative role. Bolstered by robust institutional engagement, Ethereum has transitioned into a transformative phase, embarking on a new trajectory of development and innovation.\n\nAs the broader cryptocurrency landscape undergoes dynamic transformations, Ethereum confidently assumes a pioneering position, propelled by the momentum generated through unwavering institutional support and its boundless inherent potential.\n\nAdvertisements Ready to elevate your brand through Trade Brains?

        "title": "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin falls victim to SIM-swap attack - Cryptopolitan",
        "content": "In an era where digital security has become paramount, the recent breach experienced by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin serves as a stark reminder of the lurking vulnerabilities. Buterin confirmed that his Twitter account, a platform with millions of users and significant influence, was compromised due to a SIM-swap attack. This incident underscores the risks associated with mobile-based security measures and emphasizes the need for heightened awareness and proactive measures, especially in sectors like cryptocurrency and social media platforms.\n\nThe intricacies of the SIM-swap attack\n\nA SIM-swap, or sim jacking, is a malicious technique where hackers manipulate telecom providers to gain control over a victim\u2019s mobile phone number. Once they control the number, these cybercriminals can bypass two-factor authentication (2FA) measures, granting them access to many personal accounts ranging from social media to banking and cryptocurrency wallets.\n\nButerin\u2019s experience with this attack method was particularly alarming. Speaking on the decentralized social media network Farcaster on September 12, he detailed how the attacker managed to engineer T-Mobile socially, leading to the unauthorized takeover of his phone number. He stated, \u201cYes, it was a SIM swap, meaning that someone socially engineered T-Mobile itself to take over my phone number.\u201d\n\nThis breach had severe consequences. On September 9, the hacker, having gained control over Buterin\u2019s Twitter account, posted a deceptive NFT giveaway. Unsuspecting users were lured into clicking a malicious link, ultimately leading to a collective loss of over $691,000.\n\nThe aftermath and lessons learned\n\nButerin\u2019s ordeal with the SIM swap attack highlighted some critical security insights. He emphasized the potential risks associated with linking phone numbers to online platforms, especially when they aren\u2019t used as a part of the 2FA process. \u201cA phone number is sufficient to password reset a Twitter account even if not used as 2FA,\u201d Buterin warned. He further advised users to consider removing their phone numbers from platforms like Twitter, admitting, \u201cI had seen the \u2018phone numbers are insecure, don\u2019t authenticate with them\u2019 advice before, but did not realize this.\u201d\n\nFollowing the incident, Ethereum developer Tim Beiko echoed Buterin\u2019s sentiments, strongly advocating removing phone numbers from Twitter accounts. He also emphasized the importance of enabling 2FA. Addressing platform owner Elon Musk, Beiko suggested, \u201cSeems like a no-brainer to have this default on, or to default turn it on when an account reaches, say, >10k followers.\u201d\n\nT-Mobile\u2019s troubled history with SIM-swap attacks\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first instance of T-Mobile being entangled in controversies related to SIM-swap attacks. The telecom giant has faced legal challenges due to similar security breaches. In 2020, T-Mobile was embroiled in a lawsuit for allegedly facilitating the theft of a staggering $8.7 million cryptocurrency through a series of SIM-swap attacks. The troubles didn\u2019t end there. In February 2021, another lawsuit was filed against the company when a customer lost $450,000 in Bitcoin again due to a SIM-swap attack.\n\nConclusion\n\nThese incidents serve as a stark reminder of the evolving nature of cyber threats and the importance of robust security measures. As technology continues to advance, so do the methods employed by cybercriminals. It\u2019s imperative for individuals and corporations alike to stay informed and vigilant, ensuring that their digital assets and personal information remain secure."

        "content": "Vitalik Buterin, who co-founded Ethereum, may have a plan for his ETH holdings, according to Spotonchain; a community on CoinMarketCap which is the crypto analysis website. He might deposit more ETH to Bitstamp, a crypto exchange platform, based on his wallet and transaction analysis. His move could have various effects such as increasing liquidity, reducing volatility, or preparing for a major announcement.\n\nEthereum crypto plummeted by 2.04% in market value and surged by 89.94% in trading volume in the last 24 hours as per CoinMarketCap which is a crypto data and information website. Its market value is $189,854,788,251 and its trading volume is $8,707,931,879. There are 120,221,729 ETH in circulation.\n\nTechnical Analysis of ETH on 1-D Time Frame\n\nETH has been on a rising trend since November 2022 even before 2023 began. The ETH price found strong support around $1070 and was bought heavily at that time. The price climbed steadily without breaking the trendline from $1070 to $2140, reaching the yearly high by April 16th, 2023. The price also followed the Fibonacci levels and respected them effectively as seen on the charts.\n\nHowever, the ETH turned bearish by April 19th and broke the most important trendline that it was following faithfully on August 17th, 2023. The current market price is between the Fibo 50.00% and 61.80% level trying to hold but it slipped below the previous low. The market character will change due to this and turn the overall trend bearish as well.\n\nTherefore, to continue its uptrend, the price must treat this as a pullback and then it might rise up or beyond resistance levels of $1665 and $1735.\n\nHowever, if the price falls below the previous low then the change of character might lead to a downfall and the supports will be $1490 and $1397.\n\nSource: ETH/USD.1D.BITSTAMP by TradingView\n\nAt the time of publishing, Ethereum (ETH) is trading below the 20 and 50-day EMA, showing positive signs on daily charts. RSI is around 34, and below the neutral line whereas MACD indicates bearishness to consolidation as the gap is lean. Collectively, the indicators say that the prices may consolidate with a bearish bias.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe ETH crypto price prediction shows a neutral to negative outlook from investors and traders in the daily time frame. Ethereum price action reveals a neutral to downward trend at the time of writing. Moreover, the daily chart shows that the price might either consolidate or keep going down, according to the RSI, EMA, and MACD.\n\nTechnical Levels\n\nSupport levels: The nearest support levels are $1490 and $1397\n\nThe nearest support levels are $1490 and $1397 Resistance levels: The nearest resistance levels are $1665 and $1735\n\nDisclaimer\n\nIn this article, the views and opinions stated by the author, or any people named are for informational purposes only, and they don\u2019t establish the investment, financial, or any other advice.

        "content": "Justin Sun has revealed plans to buy up FTX\u2019s holding tokens so as to relieve the market of the selling pressure.\n\nInvestors have been dumping ahead of a possible approval for FTX to liquidate its holding tokens later this week.\n\nTron founder Justin Sun has revealed his plans to save the crypto market from a possible price bloodbath. FTX bankruptcy filings have recently revealed that the collapsed exchange seeks to liquidate its holding tokens. With a court approval likely to be granted on September 13th, investors are concerned that billions worth of assets will be dumped on the market.\n\nAn updated FTX asset report shows that the exchange holds around $3.4 billion worth of assets. The biggest holding asset is Solana (SOL) worth around $1.16 billion. Bitcoin (BTC) is a little over $500 million and nearly $192 million in Ethereum (ETH). As for Tron (TRX), the stash accounts for 12 percent of the total, around $33 million.\n\nMarket experts have been quick to stop ongoing fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) that the exchange will dump all the assets upon approval. Contrary, the exchange will not flood the market with all the assets. There will be a structured framework to sell these tokens, such as $200m a week. In the case of SOL, the tokens are locked for years, OTC buyers will get FTX\u2019s vesting contract. Additionally, a majority of tokens will not be sold on the open market but will be sold on OTC or gradually via market makers.\n\nIt is unlikely that Sun would be able to buy the whole stash but his efforts will help shield the market from a plunge. This will go a long way to ensuring market stability during a potentially turbulent phase. Sun will likely buy the TRX stash first before making an offer for the rest of the tokens.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/justinsuntron/status/1701265627741335573?\n\nCrypto Market Reaction to FTX Liquidation\n\nSince the reports of the liquidation emerged, the crypto market has entered into a bearish trend. In the last 7 days, SOL which has been the greatest loser has lost nearly 7 percent. However, the altcoin has begun the week stronger, marking a marginal positive gain.\n\nTRX has responded positively to the news of its founder saving the market and has recorded a 2 percent gain in the last 24 hours.\n\nWith much of the uncertainty now addressed, investors are now more confident and have stopped dumping their stash on fears that the market will be flooded. As a result, the market is showing signs of revival with a majority of cryptocurrencies trading in the green. If the market can sustain the positive momentum, altcoins can climb back above key supports breached during liquidation woes.\n\nNoteworthy, on top of its crypto stash, FTX and its executives own 38 properties in the Bahamas which were all appraised at $199 million."

        "content": "Buterin Regains Control of T-Mobile Account, Unearths SIM-Swap Culprit\n\nEthereum co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, has uncovered the truth behind the recent hack of his X (Twitter) account. In a revelation made on the decentralized social media platform Farcaster on September 12, Buterin confirmed that a SIM-swap attack was the cause of the breach.\n\nLessons Learned and Security Implications\n\nThe tech luminary, who has since regained control of his T-Mobile account, shed light on the incident. \"Yes, it was a SIM swap, meaning that someone socially-engineered T-Mobile itself to take over my phone number,\" explained Buterin.\n\nReflecting on the episode, Buterin shared valuable lessons and insights with the community. He emphasized that a phone number alone can serve as the gateway to resetting a Twitter account's password, even without being used as two-factor authentication (2FA). He urged users to consider removing their phone numbers entirely from their Twitter profiles, noting that he had previously underestimated the vulnerability associated with phone numbers in this context.\n\nScammers Exploit the Hack for a Fake NFT Giveaway\n\nThe security breach occurred on September 9, when Buterin's X account was commandeered by scammers. They used the account to orchestrate a fraudulent NFT giveaway, luring victims to click on a malicious link. Unfortunately, this scheme resulted in collective losses exceeding $691,000 for those who fell victim to the deception.\n\nIndustry Recommendations for Enhanced Security\n\nIn the wake of this incident, Ethereum developer Tim Beiko urged users to remove their phone numbers from their X accounts and activate 2FA as an additional layer of security. Beiko suggested that it should be standard practice for accounts with substantial followings, proposing an automatic activation of 2FA when an account reaches a certain follower threshold, such as 10,000 followers. These recommendations were conveyed to platform owner Elon Musk.\n\nTwitter opsec PSA:\n\n\n\nIf you have a phone number linked on your account, even with other 2FA, it can be used to reset your PW. Need to specifically disable it + remove phone #.\n\n\n\nIf your Twitter account pre-dates crypto, strongly recommend double-checking, and adding strong 2FA! pic.twitter.com/uXrvHYhQvJ \u2014 timbeiko.eth \u2600\ufe0f (@TimBeiko) September 9, 2023\n\nSIM-Swap Attacks: A Persistent Threat\n\nA SIM-swap attack, also known as simjacking, is a technique employed by hackers to take control of a victim's mobile phone number. With access to the victim's number, scammers can manipulate two-factor authentication (2FA) processes, potentially gaining access to social media, banking, and cryptocurrency accounts.\n\nThis is not the first instance of T-Mobile being linked to such attacks. In 2020, the telecommunications giant faced a lawsuit over allegations that it enabled the theft of $8.7 million worth of cryptocurrency through a series of SIM-swap attacks. T-Mobile was once again embroiled in a legal dispute in February 2021 when a customer lost $450,000 in Bitcoin due to another SIM-swap attack."
